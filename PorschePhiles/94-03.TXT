Subject: Monthly Update for Porschephiles

March 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

This list continues to grow at about 6% per month, compounded. Think 
about it...

My transition to Northern New Jersey Region of the PCA has gone well.
Great bunch of people, good events. Even if you have needed a dog sled to get
to a couple of them.

I'm still suffering Porsche Withdrawal. My rather abbreviated visit to 
Houston only made it that much worse. Hopefully, we'll have that at least
partially fixed after UniForum.

Speaking of which: I'm still planning on being at Tech Tactics this upcoming
weekend, but Warbonnet  is a bit off the beaten path this year. And I'll
still be in the San Fran Bay Area from March 21st through 28th. Pam Collopy
(collopy@leland.stanford.edu) is arranging a get-together for the weekend
so send her mail if you  can attend. If you can't, shoot me a note and
maybe I can break free some eveening or something... And, if you need
"get in free" passes for UniForum, I still have a bout a crate of them left...
just be sure to come by my booth!

And that's about it from the frozen north...

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.
P.O. Box 10402
Alexandria VA 22310

Does take non-US membership. You *MUST* have a Porsche VIN number to join.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy.
Or they'll send you an application which you can mail in with your check.

National membership chairman is Nann Weissenberger who is reachable via

get her to send you an application as well. 


Porsche Club of Great Britain

Northleach
Gloucestershire

Specialty clubs:

356 Registry Inc.
27244 Ryan Rd. 
Warren, MI, 48092

For 356 enthusiasts around the world. $20 per year and cheap at twice the 
price. (Vic Skirmants' racing column is worth that, as are the classifieds...) 
5000 happy members can't be wrong! 

P.S. You *DON'T* have to own a 356 to join, and if you think you want to
own one, this is the best place to buy. No one seems to expect concours
prices for their cars unless they have a real concours car.

914 Owner's Association
100 South Sunrise Way, Suite 116
Palm Springs CA 92262

Over 2000 members in over 20 countries. Dennis Deeds published the club
newsletter, Mid-Engined Views, quarterly. Membership is $22 a year.
Again, they don't require you own an 914 to join, but they are interested
in the lowest and highest serial numbers known for each year model.

"S" Registry

Contact Vern Lyle, Box 363,
West Point, PA 19486 (tele (215) 652-7011 (day), (215) 287-5083 (eve). 
Dues are $20/yr with a quarterly newsletter. Dedicated to all early
911S models.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Howdy Lou, 
 
I have no direct experience  on 356 exhaust systems but I have researched it a 
bit because it is on my "list of things to do" to my production racer.  Two 
independent sources, including Duane Spencer recommends Horsepower Engineerings 
Bursch exhaust system.  This system is tuned for high-end output in the 125-160 
hp range.  This is available both a stinger and the supertrap muffler for 
tracks with noise restrictions.  This will require the removal of the heater 
boxed (which is a good idea on a racer).  A lesser alternative is the Sebring 
system.  This is tuned as well and uses the stock J tubes so the heater system 
is left intact.  Both are available from Performance Products.  For more 
information call them at 800-423-3173.

I just purchased, in December, a 1980 911SC.  The car is lowered with

for weekends at the track so, needless to say, the current tires are
not suitable for anything but dry conditions.  I'd appreciate any
advise on best alternatives for everyday driving (excluding winters)
while sacrificing as little as possible in handling.

I can't remember how many blades are on a 74 fan, but if it's less than eleven
you should try that upgrade first -- spouse needs to approve only $150, less
if you search carefully.  From the work you've done, it sounds as though you
would certainly be capable of DIY installation of the Terbatrol kit, which
helped a lot on my 77.  Unless you've got a relative who owns a wrecking yard,
I can't imagine you would save much by buying pieces rather than the complete
kit, and the Terbatrol cooler is said to be MUCH more effective than the trom-
bone.
Good luck!

Do any of you out there have any ideas? He realizes
that his son will have to take core math and physics
programs, but he's afraid that the kid will lose 
interest if he doesn't see anything with wheels and
an engine until graduate school."

Is GMI (General Motors Institute) in Detroit still in business?  They are (or
were) very highly specialized...automotive engineering and nothing but. 
However, they got good reviews from people I have met who graduated from there,
and/or worked with their graduates.  I heard a couple of years ago that they
had either drastically reduced their program, or closed down completely.  So
that may not be an option.

Please Reid, I am sure that if I think hard enough I can come up with many 
examples of both Marketing failures and Engineering "mis-designs" in the 
automotive world. In the 70, if it had not been for the engineering departments 
of Detroit that resulted in poor fit, poor quality, poor ergonomics, poor 
reliability, poor designs, and outdated manufacturing, the Japanese companies 
would not be where they are now. We can also blame the Marketing departments of 
the same Detroit companies for not recognizing that the customers were willing 
to pay more for all those missing attributes. So, please spare me (a Marketing 
guy) the normal flame from an engineering guy (maybe like yourself) that all 
failures in the market place can be attributed to Marketing. It just isn't true.


Minh.

P.S. I also hold a graduate degree in Engineering so I am entitled to speak out 
of both sides of my mouth.

Subject: Oil usage ('87 951)

The subject of oil usage has come up on the net several times. I understand that 
factory limits are rather liberal in allowing up to 1 Qt./600 miles. If I 
understand this correctly, if no gross leaks are present, oil burning occurs:
	via used valve guides
	blow-by if piston rings are worn
	via turbo bearings if worn.

I am using now about 1 qt/750 Miles and am wondering how to determine what I 
should do (at 67,500 miles):
	1. Nothing
	2. Top end rebuild
	3. Check Turbo (HOW)
	4. Major rebuild with re-ringing. Compression test is well within spec, 
does that mean anything in this setting ?

Anyone knows the logcal approach ?? THANKS

Subject: RE: 2.7 liter overheating


In reply to the person inquiring about the Terbatrol oil cooler, I can offer
these comments.

A couple years back, I was having serious problems with over-heating at the
track (SIR).  I'd make about 4 or 5 hot laps and then my engine would be so
hot, it would start cutting out (there are pressure relief valves in the SC oil
systme which can cause this).  The first time it happened, I thought I'd blown
my engine!  But after a 10 minute cool down, it started right up and ran fine.

Anyway, I had a friend with a Terbatrol on his 930.  He wanted even more
cooling so he bought a big behind-the-front-valance cooler so he sold me his
Terbatrol for a good price.  Since I had an SC, I already had the plumbing to
the front for the old trombone.  This made installation of the Terbatrol a
snap!  I did have to remove the horn which was in the way but other than that,
it was about a 2 hour project.  I'd classify myself as mechanically inclined.

The cooler did the job out on the track.  I still get warm on the track but
nowhere near where it use to get.  Sounds like it might be your solution.

Good luck,

______________________________________________________________________________
 		THE TEN BEST TOOLS OF ALL TIME
 		By J. William Lam, Stockton, CA
 
 There are only ten things in this world you need to fix any car, any
 place, any time.
 
 Forget the Snap-On Tools truck; it's never there when you need it.
 Besides, there are only ten things in this world you need to fix any
 car, any place, any time.
 
 1.  Duct Tape: Not just a tool, a veritable Swiss Army knife in stickum
 and plastic.  It's safety wire, body material, radiator hose,
 upholstery, insulation, tow rope, and more in one easy-to-carry
 package. Sure, there's a prejudice  surrounding  duct  tape  in
 concourse competitions, but in the real world everything from Le Mans -
 winning Porsches to Atlas rockets uses it by the yard.  The only thing
 that can get you out of more scrapes is a quarter and a phone booth.
 
 2.  Vice-Grips:  Equally adept as a wrench, hammer, pliers, baling wire
 twister, breaker-off of frozen bolts, and wiggle-it-till-it-falls off
 tool. The heavy artillery of your toolbox, Vice Grips are the only tool
 designed expressly to fix things screwed up beyond repair.
 
 3. Spray Lubricants: A considerably cheaper alternative to new doors,
 alternators, and other squeaky items.  Slicker than pig phlegm.
 Repeated soakings of WD-40 will allow the main hull bolts of the Andrea
 Dora to be removed by hand. Strangely enough, an integral part of these
 sprays is the infamous little red tube that flies out of the nozzle if
 you look at it cross-eyed, one of the ten worst tools of all time.
 
 4. Margarine Tubs With Clear Lids: If you spend all your time under
 the hood looking for a frendle pin that caromed off the peedle valve
 when you knocked both off the air cleaner, it's because you eat
 butter.  Real mechanics consume pounds of tasteless vegetable oil
 replicas, just so they can use the empty tubs for parts containers
 afterward.  (Some, of course, chuck the butter-colored goo altogether
 or use it to repack wheel bearings.) Unlike air cleaners and radiator
 lips, margarine tubs aren't connected by a time/space wormhole to the
 Parallel Universe of Lost Frendle Pins.
 
 5. Big Rock At The Side Of The Road: Block up a tire.  Smack corroded
 battery terminals.  Pound out a dent.  Bop nosy know-it-all types on
 the noodle.  Scientists have yet to develop a hammer that packs the raw
 banging power of granite or limestone. This is the only tool with which
 a "made in India" emblem is not synonymous with the user's maiming.
 
 6., Plastic Zip Ties: After twenty years of lashing down stray hoses
 and wired with old bread ties, some genius brought a slightly
 slicked up version to the auto parts market. Fifteen zip ties can
 transform a hulking mass of amateur-quality rewiring from a working
 model of the Brazilian rain forest into something remotely resembling a
 wiring harness.  Of course, it works both ways. When buying used cars,
 subtract $ 100.00 for each zip tie under the hood.
 
 7. Ridiculously Large Standard Screwdriver With Lifetime Guarantee:
 Let's admit it. There's nothing better for prying, chiseling, lifting,
 breaking, splitting, or mutilating than a huge flat-bladed screwdriver,
 particularly when wielded with gusto and a big hammer. This is also the
 tool of choice for oil filters so insanely located they can only be
 removed by driving a stake in one side and out the other. If you break
 the screwdriver - and you will, just like Dad or your shop teacher said
 - who cares? It's guaranteed.
 
 8.  Bailing Wire:  Commonly known as MG muffler brackets, bailing wire
 holds anything that's too hot for tape or ties. Like duct tape, it's
 not recommended for concourse contenders since it works so well you'll
 never replace it with the right thing again.  Bailing wire is a
 sentimental favorite in some circles, particularly with MG, Triumph,
 and flathead Ford set.
 
 9.  Bonking Stick: - This monstrous tuning fork with devilishly pointy
 ends is technically known as a tie-rod- end separator, but how often do
 you separate tie-ends?  Once every decade, if you're lucky. Other than
 medieval combat, its real use is the all purpose application of undue
 force, not unlike that of the huge flat-bladed screwdriver. Nature
 doesn't know the bent metal panel or frozen exhaust pipe that can stand
 up to a good bonking stick. (Can also be used to separate tie-rod ends
 in a pinch, of course, but does a lousy job of it).
 
 10. A Quarter and a Phone Booth:
       See #1 above.

After seeing in, the pictures don't really do it justice.  They had a mint 
green 968 cabiolet with mint green Carrera Cup wheels, grey interior, which 
was probably the ugliest color I've seen.  We were there for about 1.5 
hours, and there was about 6 test drives in the 993.  The other thing that 
was interesting was if you want a different chip or a 3 inch exhaust, you 
just order it from Porsche.  All in all, a great way to spend a rainy

GM Institute is *really* good.  University of Illinois - probably, but *hard* to

Subject: street/autocross alignment for a 924 turbo


Hi.

I am new to this list, so please tell me if I am doing anything 
inappropriate.

About a year ago, I bought a 924 turbo, and a friend of mine has
now gotten me interested in autocross. I am told that alignment
can make a big difference in terms of this, and I would like to 
hear any recommendations from those who might know as to the 
preferred camber, caster, toe-in/toe-out, etc. for this car.

Please note that I still plan to use this car on the street.

If anyone is particularily enthusiastic, I would also appreciate
general comments about other things I should consider in terms
of caring for the car and making it better for autocross.

Thanks in advance,

Tobias

914 2.0 Questions
I seeketh the wisdom of the Mighty Net:
    I've noticed some things about my NEW (to me) '74 914 2.0L
(YAAAAY!) that I don't think I like.  I just had some electrical
work done on it, but the voltmeter in the center console still
exhibits behavior that bothers me.  In daylight, with no load on
the electrical system (except the radio, which doesn't seem to
affect anything...) the gauge reads about 13V (or just under if
the engine is at idle).  Each light turned on seems to drop that
reading by around a volt.  If it's night, the headlights are on,
and you're stopped (brake lights) about to make a left turn (turn
signal), the gauge jumps from about 10V to 11V in time with the
blinker.
    I have been told that this is normal behavior--i.e., that
Porsche put the leads for this meter in a really stupid place.
Is this correct?
    My other problem is with deceleration.  When you let off the
gas and take the car out of gear, the RPMs drop to nothing.  The
car almost stalls, then comes back and idles normally.  What could
be causing this?
    Advice always appreciated.

  I kicked the windshield out of my friend's VW beetle on account of hornets.
We wuz at a stop lite and one flew in and buzzed me before hiding behind
the visor, i took a swipe at it but missed only enough to piss him off.
So I followed up with a karate kick that not only took out the hornet, but
also the visor and windshield which flopped out on the hood, gasket and all.
  When the lite changed we went on to find a place to park and get it 
together, but before we made it the remains of the screen caught wind and
flew up over the car and smashed to bits behind.  This brought tears to
my friend...
A beetle is fairly airtite, so driving at more than 30 mph downright HURTS!

Subject: 914: The Saga of '76 continues..

  914'ers:   
  While you all were out partying with Stan the man, I bean busting my head
under my 914 (i got the bumps to prove it).  Seems both rear axle bearings
were shot and i got elected to do the new ones.  Yesterday i finally got the
swing arm off the battery side...the suspension console had rustholes in it!
And the bolt hole for the inner swingarm mount was wallered out a quarter
inch.  One less thing to worry about when I'm through.
  
  Since the powertrain is out, this whole job was just made easier but it
is still tough if the CV joints wont separate from the axle flange, or
the axle nut wont bust loose.  Even then its still cheesy trying to get that
big bearing out of the swingarm after eighteen years of snug.  Getting the
bearing off the flange shaft is pretty hard too.  Last time I did this, the
shop shattered the old bearing.  Oddly enough, putting the new bearings on  
did not require a press (i froze the shaft and heated the bearing to slip
it on) -it worked-.  Pressing in piston pins this way works too (heat the 
piston, freeze the pin).

  Thanks to Stan, Mike, and Reid...
  I've decided not to port/polish heads, but it is tempting to go with the
38/40mm valves since these heads are so butchered.  FAT does offer cams for
carburetion OR injection, but Greg sez one cam wont work for both.  I betcha
it dont matter that much for a street warrior like me.

  I've discovered Castrol SUPER CLEAN! 
Much cheaper than OIL-FLO ($8/gal vs. $30/gal) works cold, does not STINK!
Biodegradeable (Feh), water wash, dilutable to 1/16th.
Makes a grungy case squeaky clean, seems to strip oils off so well that
steel will start to rust before the parts are dry.  Super surfactant!

  So now i have a pair of clean and complete 2 liter engines torn down
(cranks -n- cams everwhere) and one complete operational 2 liter waiting
for shoehorning in.  These engines look strange fully dressed, its a shame 
they lose their balanced appearance when the tins and housings go on.
  Its impressive assembling one of these...i used an
engine lift to hold the weight of the engine/trans while resting partly on
a foldable 'Workmate 200' (wt. limit 350lbs).  This made working on it
the best conditions i have ever had. An engine stand is too low to the floor. 

  I took the opportunity to replace the leaking pushrod tube oil seals
and readjust the valve clearances.  The other day i went to Sam's to buy
their 3ton truck jack...this model has the removable saddle.  I made a steel
cradle to lift the powertrain up and into the engine bay...the cradle has
a post for fitting into the jack so the weight wont shift -its great.
At a grand total of $65, I no longer rent jacks.
  So at least i have joined the twentieth century -no more bear-hide slings
and stone fulcrums for me!!

  It nearly cost me my marriage, but i saved hundreds of bux buying parts
at the close of last year.  I suppose it was worth it, such a scorning!
And soon (c'mon real soon) I'm gonna be motoring to OKC's warbonnet session
in this bloody car!  Its FOUR years since I been over ten miles in a P-car.

   Several people mentioned the fan - alas, the car already is running 
the 11 blade fan.  No easy relief.  The engine was rebuilt in '83, and
has about 45K on it since.  And by hot, it does reach the "too damn hot"

   The oil cooler has been cleaned, and I've cleaned under the engine

   Sounds like installing any external cooler will help.  The for sale

Subject: Tire Wear on a 951S vs. an NSX

On my 951S, rear tires with a treadwear rating of 190-200 last about
20,000 miles.   I love to accelerate hard which naturally wears out the
tires on the driving wheels.  The NSX is a different story; it doesn't pull 
hard enough to wear down the rear tires as quickly as my 951S.  But the car
encourages drifting around corners.  At TWS, a race car driver took
me for a ``hot lap'' in an NSX.  He gleefully drifted through every corner.
(But he still only reached 125 mph on the straightway, 10 mph less
than I manage in my 951S despite a slow entry speed and very
early braking approaching Turn 1 and 2.)

A friend of mine who owns an NSX tried replacing his Yoko A022 tires
with Dunlop SP 8000's (tread wear rating of 200) but he claimed
they introduced an annoying vibration.  He took them back to the
tire dealer and exchanged them for a new set of Yoko A022's despite 
their poor tread life.  He can afford it; he's planning to trade
his NSX on a Ferrari 348 or 512 TR.

The 68 911S was very similar to the 1967 911S. It had Webers (40 IDS 3C1,
if I recollect, rather than the standard 911's 40 IDA - The IDS series
added a high speed mixture enrichment nozzle). The 2.0 L. 911S with
mechanical injection was introduced in 1969. The 911S was not officially
imported in 1968, although some reasonable number of them seem to have
come in privately. The reason was the introduction of the next level
of emission controls, effective in 1968 (really the first series of
tailpipe emission controls, as opposed to crankcase breathers and such).
The significant valve timing overlap of the 911S made it very difficult
to meet the requirements. Plug fouling was a bit of a hassle (at least
on my 67), but by no means insurmountable. I used platinum plugs
(the old Bosch type) without a CD. Ten minutes of stop and go traffic
would sometimes foul a plug, but it would clear itself out once the
traffic cleared, most of the time. It was never enough of a hassle to
make me spend the time to install a CD system.

I assume you are aware that '68 911's were still short wheelbase cars.
If you are looking for a track car (I'm not sure what you meant by a
"sports car"), that may be an issue. Some people swear by the short
wheelbase cars, but I think a larger group swears at them. By all means
gather more opinions if you plan to use it as a track car. If you own
a 74 911 I wouldn't see this as any issue for street driving.

I also assume that if you own a 74 911, you are all too aware of where
to look for rust in the chassis.

What we are going to try on my girlfriends car ('81 sc) is this:

22mm non-adjustable factory 'sway bar from '84 carerra in front (this
is the "sport" bar).

19mm adjustable aftermarket 'sway bar in the back.

I currently have 22mm weltmeister (adjustable) bars on my '80 sc.  

They work fine, but you have to drill holes in the car to mount the 
front bar, they are noisy, and the ride is pretty hard (stock torsion 
bars and bilstein shocks).

My thinking is that the rubber mounts for the 22mm factory bar will be 
soft enough that a 19mm adjustable (weltmesiter?) bar will provide 
a good balance.

Any comments appreciated.

	I have to agree with Ben on this one - though (as one of the 3 UK
porschephiles), I'd expect to have the car for 4 months each year :-)

	I also wouldn't rush to AFN - The Sunday Times normally has
adverts for up to half a dozen 959s. I've certainly seen one in my local
dealers, Lancasters, though it was a bit overshadowed (in my eyes) by the
Ferrari F40 parked beside it.

Subject: DD's 914 problems

    DD

    You mentioned that when you declerate your 914 the RPMs drop to
    zero and then come back up to idle.  First of all, I know very
    little about 914s so please take what I say subject to whatever
    verification you deem necessary. But, your problem sounds similar
    to a distributor advance problem I've seen on a few 911s.  I think
    what happens is that the springs and bearings in the distributors
    wear out and thus the timing doesn't remain accurate when
    you drop from high revs (thus the revs drop to zero and slowly
    climb back up after the weak springs, etc. are finally able to get
    the curve back to where it is supposed to be).  The cure for this
    problem in the 911 is to rebuild the distributor or to find a new
    one.  Perhaps it is the same cure for the 914.  There might be a
    simpler solution such as timing or something, but not that I know
    of.

    I hope this helps.  Please let us know how you solve the problem.

    I do not plan on converting my 911 to hydrogen-powered, but might
    be interested in doing it to another car.

Subject: oil  cooler for 911


Chuck Benz wrote about overheating problems on his 77 911 and about adding a 
turbatrol oil cooler.

several years ago i installed one on my 83SC.  it was relatively easy to do 
since SC's already have the oil lines running to the front fender well.  it 
worked fairly well in phoenix but not as well as i wanted (it does tend to 
get a tad warmer here than most places).  B&B Fabrications made a stainless 
steel racing-style cooler for me which i installed in place of the 
turbatrol.  it was a direct replacement for the turbatrol so installation 
was easy.  it also weighs a little less.  it took around 5 degrees more off 
the temperature so i'm happy with it.   bill boat has since further refined 
the design and i now see it advertised in pano and excellence.  i don't know 
what the price is but he told me it was competitive with turbatrol.

you might want to check it out along with turbatrol.  B&B's phone number is 
602-842-1234.

the factory late model carrera oil cooler includes a fan which also works 
well.

i've since sold the turbatrol to a list member.  turbatrol, IMHO, is also a 
good product.  either way you will see some noticable improvement.

I guess we will need to add "lift-rheostat oversteer" to our vocabulary...

P-philers,

I have a friend whose son is entering college next
year, and they've been looking for a school with an
automotive engineering program.

Do any of you out there have any ideas?

Thanks,

Reid (zeigler@merck.com)
=============================

Dear Reid:

I don't believe there is a spcific BS program that is
ABET approved for 'automotive engineering'

Automotive engineering is so diverse that all types 
of engineers are involved.  Primarilly Mechanical
types althogh there are many industrial, chemical,
ceramic, electrical, and so on.

I would suggest he get into a engineering program in an
area that most interests him.  Be sure
to be at a university with a very strong   SAE  chapter
        (society of automotive engineers)^^^^^^
to be involved with there car building programs.

Remember the wash out rate in engineering is about 60%+++
so it will take a very good student
that is dead set on engineering, and willing to go through
much pain, to make it to the BS.  (and then its
only a matter of luck to get into an automotive company.

good luck

Subject: Re: oil  cooler for 911

Now that we know that Chucks car hits 250F or more, what do folks think
about his problem?  Is this common for a 2.7L?  I only ask because
while an oil cooler should certainly reduce operating temps, should
he be searching further for some root cause?  250F seems pretty hot
to me.  I realize the comparison isn't completely valid, but my 
2.2L T rarely gets above 180F in varied street driving.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM
CST, or Stan may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to
mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX
"uncompress" program, or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is available in the tta.com archives in /pub/porschephiles?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

Subject: Heat dissipation qualities of paint

In repainting the sheet metal for my 2.2, I used a gloss black
engine paint.  It wasn't until I had completed the job that I
began to wonder if this were the best color for the job. (I 
know, not the best time to think of this!)
The original color was black, but I was unable to tell if
it were gloss, flat or powder.  Does it matter?  Is the 
difference so subtle as to be no difference?  Any help
would be appreciated.

Subject: 911 piston condition

While cleaning and inspecting the pistons on my 2.2, I 
noticed something that has me concerned.  Although the
ring grooves meet spec for wear and appear to be in good
shape, there is some minor pitting between the 2nd and 3rd
ring groove. It doesn't affect the overall piston diameter,
but should I be concerned about this?  Everything else
about the pistons seem to be ok.

Any help would be appreciated.

From: tilden@kea.Data-IO.COM (John Tilden)
Subject: 911 Alternator Repair, Long

	Having received only one response to my query on Alternator
	Bearing replacement, I thought I'd share what I have learned
	in the last month.
	At this point, I have installed a rebuilt, and replaced it with
	a new unit provided by Porsche when the rebuilt failed (shorted
 	stator coil). So I've been in there twice. Comment in earlier
	post on rebuilt quality is right on! Porsche is offering a new unit
	manufactured by Valeo as an alternative to the rebuilt unit.
	Much better part! See end of commentary for part nos.

911 Carrera '84-'89 Alternator Replacement/Repair:

	This all began when I noticed an eratic rumble from the engine
	while idling. Bearing Noise. 
	The Alternator had been trouble free, no electrical problems,
	and now at 95,000 miles, the pulley end bearing is failing. 
	Checking with the dealer, there is no listing for any internal 
	parts for the alternator, especially the bearings.
	$US239.95 for a rebuilt Alternator seemed a bit steep for just
	replacing the front bearing, I thought, so I called around to the 
	bearing houses and was referred to a local Auto-Electric Shop
	who had a cross listing, and the parts in stock!
	$30.00 for both bearings and replacement brushes. That's about right 
	for this job. I'd rebuilt alternators before, so no Big Deal.

	Note that you can also purchase a new brush holder/regulator
	assembly for approx $35.00, Slip Ring Assembly approx $15.00 and 
	Diode Sets, cost unkown.
	Another alternative to the Dealer is to have your local Auto-Electric
	Shop rebuild your Alterantor, typical cost is about $150.00.

	Alternator Removal:

	1) Disconnect the battery to prevent any electrical damage.
	2) Remove the belts, both the Alternator and the Air Conditioning.
	3) Disconnect Ingition wires to cylinders 4,5,and 6 from the 
	   distributor end, remove distributor cap and rotor.
	4) Remove bolts securing the ignition wire harness to the Fan Housing
	   and lay the wires to the right side, over the AC Pump.
	5) Remove the bolt next to the distributor holding the shroud to the
	   Fan Housing.
	6) Remove Bolt thru the strap which clamps the Fan Housing to the
	   Engine Block. 
	7) Lift/ Pull the Fan Housing out of the cradle, and tilt it
	   out to gain access to the back side of the Alternator.
		Note: The Back of the Alternator has a sheild/deflector
		      covering the terminals. Pretty nifty aerodynamics
		      here, but the thing has to come off to remove the
		       wires!
	8) Remove three nuts which hold the deflector to the back of the 
	   Fan Housing, (8mm wrench/socket) slide the deflector away
	   to reveal the wire terminals.
	9) Remove the three wire terminal nuts/washers from the back of the
	   Alternator. 
		Caution: Do not drop anything into the Engine at this
	   		 point, as they will be hard to recover!
	10) Remove the Fan Housing/Alternator Assembly from the Engine.
		Note: Use Caution when putting the Alternator Assembly
		      on the bench so as not to damage any wires or 
		      connectors on the Back Side of the Alternator.	
		      Use Wood Blocks (2X4) to support it off the bench.

	11) Pull Fan off the Alternator Shaft.
	12) Flip Assembly over, (Blocks Again) remove the remaining three
	    Nuts securing the Alternator Assembly to the Fan Housing.
	13) Push/Punch Alternator from the Fan Housing. It is a tight
	    fit, I used an aluminum punch and hammer to start the 
	    Alternator moving out of the housing.

	If you are merely replacing the old Alternator with a New or 
	Rebuilt, you are half way done.

	If you are intent on rebuilding your own alternator, ie, no electrical
 	problems, then first inspect the Slip Rings on the back side of 
	the alternator, see below:

	Alternator Dissambly:
		Tools Needed:
			Bearing/Gear puller, Three jaw, Small.
			Arbor Press (Not mandatory).
			6 inch Lathe (for slip ring replacement).

	1) Remove Brush Holder/Regulator Assembly. Two bolts on back of
	   Alternator retaining a Black Plastic Housing with an Aluminum 
	   Heat Sink, immediately above the rear bearing housing. Remove two
	   push on connectors from the Diode Arrays on either side.

		Note: The Holder is snapped over catches on the bearing 
		housing. Pry the ends, adjacent to the bearing housing, 
		with screw driver and push it out in a radial 
		direction.

	2) Inspect the Slip Rings (Copper Rings immediately in front
	   of rear bearing) for wear, visable thru opening for Brush Holder.
	   Allowable wear is a .010 deep groove, the width of the brushes.

		If Wear is greater than this, Stop Dissambly Now, and
		order a rebuilt or new from you favorite source.
		Slip Rings can be Turned Down and polished on a Lathe,
		but there isn't much material to work with, about .030 inches,
 		so if the wear is severe it should be replaced.
		If you have a well equipped shop, Lathe, Press etc.
		you can replace the Slip Ring Assembly.

		The brushes carry a controlled DC voltage to the slip rings,
		energizing the Rotor, which acts as a rotating magnet to
		induce an AC current in the stator coils. The brushes
		and slip rings erode normally, one faster than the other
		because of the direction the current is flowing. So uneven
		wear is normal. The voltage is controlled by the regulator
		which senses the output voltage of the Alternator, and feeds
		back an appropriate voltage to control the output to a given
		voltage, hence the term regulator. The output voltage is a
		fuction of RPM and input voltage/current. 
	
	3) If wear is acceptable, or you intend to replace the Slip Rings
	   yourself, remove six long bolts holding Alternator together.
	   First, mark the assembly so you can get it back together properly.

	4) Pull the Rotor/Front housing out of the Field Assy/Back Housing.
	5) Remove Plastic Cap from small bearing at back end of Rotor.
	6) Remove Woodruff Key from Shaft, file down any burrs on the Shaft
	   prior to pressing the Bearing off, remove Spacer from Shaft, note
	   orientation.
	7) Pull or Press Front bearing Housing off the Rotor Shaft.
	   	Use Arbor press or Gear Puller here.
	8) Press/Pull Rear Bearing off. (ditto)
	9) Remove two screws and bearing retainer from the front alternator
	   cover, and press the front bearing out of the housing. 
       10) Clean and inspect for any unusal wear.
       11) To remove the Slip Ring, (Note, I did not experience this procedure
	   myself, it is anecdotal info, use at your own risk, and pay
	   attention)
	   First, Note position of slip ring on shaft axially, Second, measure
	   the diameter of the unworn portion of the slip ring, write them down.
	   Cut or desolder the wires going to the slip ring assembly, leave
           ample length to reconnect.
       12) Split the Slip Ring with a hacksaw or cold chisel (carefully) and 
    	   remove from shaft.
       13) Clean shaft and press new ring assembly onto shaft, aligning the
	   leads extending from the slip ring assy with the lead wires from
	   the rotor winding.
       14) Solder lead wires together in a manner similar to the original
	   assembly.
       15) Using your lathe, Turn the outside diameter down to same
	   diameter as unworn portion of old assembly, this exposes the gap
	   between the two rings, making two circuit paths to the rotor.
       16) Reassemble in reverse order with new bearings, etc.

	This is a good time to clean and paint your Fan and Fan Housing
	if you are so inclined, adds a bit of sparkle to your engine
	compartment.

Before Terbatrol, my 77 2.7 would go up to 250F just like Chuck's, at least
in slow traffic on a hot day.  A pretty respectable rebuild didn't change
this behavior, so I feel it's the nature of 2.7s, not an individual engine
problem that Chuck should be looking to fix.

I would recommend Swepco gear oil...its designed for heavey duty machines
like rock crushers.....You cat get it from automotion....many porsche
dealers use Swepco as well so you may be able to get it there.  If the
dealer will give you a 10% PCA discount, its probably cheaper than getting
it from automotion.

Swepco has some special additives in it that make the gear shifting
smoother and slicker.  The dealer told me it should not need changing
for 100K miles....as 5K miles a year, I cannot attest to the longevity.

	Well, finally took the plunge this weekend. The wife and I bought a
	1989 951 Turbo. We bought it from a private owner who had two of them!
	The one we purchased has 36K miles on it and the one he kept only had
	5K miles on it! I tried to convince him to sell the other one to us
	but no dice. The car we purchesed for 20k is in great shape, the timing
	belt was changed at 31k miles and the water-pump was also replaced when
	the car had 28k miles on it. The owner supplied us with all service
	documentation so I know the car has been taken care of. The car also
	has new tires and new front brakes. The owner also mentioned that the
	car was recalled for a transmission defect which was fixed by the dealership.
	Anyone know what this recall was, I didn't get a chance to ask the owner.

	I was amazed at how much better this car felt then a 1988 Turbo we drove,
	its hard to explain but the car just felt like it was on rails. I know
	this car has bigger brakes and a beefer suspension but I didn't think
	the difference would be so dramatic.
	----
	I think the 89 turbo is really a turbo S of 87-88

	A couple of things that I would like to do is replace the transmission
	and rear end fluids with Red Line Oils and go to a synthetic based oil

My understanding is that while the earlier 911's ran relatively cool., the 
2.7's ran much hotter, due to their design.  Temperatures in the 250's are 
not unusual in warmer climates.  Beginning with the SC's, Porsche designed 
in the loop or trombone oil cooling system in an attempt to solve the 
problem.  Beginning in 84 they provided an oil radiator, which is what 
turbatrol and b&b designed as retrofits for earlier cars.

My 83 SC ran up to the 280's on hot summer days in city traffic.  i was 
advised by PCNA and various mechanics that this was to be expected and that 
the engine was designed to handle that temp.  beginning with the 2.7's 
(don't know what year it started) Porsche stopped using oil temp guages with 
numbers and started to use marks (obscurely labled with degrees C but not 
readable if you  were moving!) due to customer concerns with how hot the 
cars seemed to be running.

I felt that those temps were too high to be good for the long term health of 
my car so i installed an oil cooler.

Certainly Chuck should check all the usual culprits (air shrouds, timing, 11 
bladed fan, thermal reactors) but i would believe from his reports that the 
real villian is in the design.  Is this why Porsche started building (gasp) 
water-cooled cars?

Subject: the (over)bearing saga

You may recall my posting some questions about replacing the rear wheel 
bearings
on my '84 944.  I tore the wheel down two weekends ago and discovered much more
damage than had been anticipated.  The loose wheel shaft nut was the first sign
of things being seriously amiss.  It is supposed to be torqued in excess of 260
ft-lbs and was in fact barely snug.  Disassembly of the shaft revealed that the
inner race of the outer bearing was broken into two pieces and it had been
spinning on the wheel shaft.  The wheel shaft was scored to a depth of 0.010",
so I decided to replace it.  The Porsche dealer wanted $360 for a new one, so
I bought a used one for $100 (a relative bargain).  I also purchased new
spacers, since their ends were also scored.  With replacement parts in hand
(and new bearings and seals, of course), I reassembled everything.  It was
a straightforward procedure.  I used a drift punch and ball peen hammer to
remove and replace the inner bearing (this is a steel trailing arm) and
found the only requirement here was patience.  I also used a pair of large
woodworking deep-throat clamps to press out and then pull in the wheel shaft.
Using them was somewhat awkward, but they did the job.

I also replaced the rear brake pads while I was at it, using Ferodo AF pads.

The car feels much more precise now.  And that annoying tick tick is gone.

I had the alignment checked, and surprisingly, it was OK.

Now to go autocrossing!

I just had my '84 944 aligned for street/autox.  Here are the settings:

Front
- ------
Camber: - 1.5 degrees
Caster: 2.7 degrees
Toe: 0.02"

Back
- ------
Camber: - 2.0 degrees
Toe: - 0.01"

As far as general advice is concerned, I have been told by many that
the greatest contributor to autox success is driving skill.  I will
find out first hand this weekend as it will be my first autocross
(it is a practice being held by the PNW PCA region at Bremerton raceway).
After driving skill comes tires.  The hot tip seems to be the Yokohama
A008Rs, but these won't last long if driven on the street.

I am reading a book which seems quite good: "Secrets of Solo Racing" by
Henry Watts.  I got it from Automotion.

Hydrogen boils at -253 degrees celsius at 1 ata,and if you increase the

Just mount the hose to your injector system and bury the tank under
your hose :) :) :)

Or what about using Helium in the tank,....Helium doesn't burn and it
only make you talk like Donald Duck if you breathe it.It boils at even

Just FYI, there are two completly different devices called "Fuel Cells."

Automotive fuel cell:  
      Large sponge in strong plastic bag in strong box.

Other fuel cell:  
      Device that generates electricity directly from 
      fuel and oxidizer, e.g. hydrogen and oxygen.  Efficencies of 
      70% were obtainable 15 years ago.  The device is essentially a
      battery that runs as long as fuel is supplied.

  Yes, the voltmeter is miles from the source, so voltage drop thru the
wiring give poor readings.
  And you are having problems with voltage regulation if you are running
under 13.4 volts during operation.

  First, get rid of the mechanical regulator and get an electronic from
NAPA (REALLY!) for ~$20, it will fix a lot of headache.

  Ok, this may not be a problem.  The injection system actually shuts off
all fuel delivery during deceleration until the ECU detects engine rpm
below 1700 (i think). where is then resumes fuel delivery.  This can
cause the 'dip' in revs, but yours sounds like greater sustain than normal.
Sounds like a hose in the wrong place.
 You're hosed, dave. ;)

Bruce Anderson responded to one 74 2.7 owner that the proper operating
temp is from 180 to 220, with 230 being as high as it should go.  250
should never be exceeded for any length of time.  The 911 engine will
tolerate running at these hotter temps but will result in reduced engine
life.  He suggested factory plumbing from the Carrera line and the
Terbatrol oil cooler in the right front fender.

i read somewhere (pano a couple of years ago?) that the 3.0's were designed 
to tolerate a higher temp than the 2.7's.  however, i can't believe those 
high temps aren't going to shorten engine life, which is why i installed an 
oil cooler in my sc.  i switched from terbatrol to b&b to get better cooling 
and will be adding a fan to the cooler for this summer.  i also installed a 
oil temp guage with real numbers, rather than the little marks to better 
know what was going on.

Torque is not a function of RPM....HP is function of Torque, RPM and a constant.

So, as torque falls off above the peak torque point, but rpm continues, HP continues
up.  At some point, the torque has fallen off enough that the rpm increase no longer

Eastwood has a book "Propane Fuel Conversions," pn 6768 (800-345-1178),
 this might start to give you an idea on alternative fuels. LPNG and
 hydrogen might have a future as clean-burn cars, but Electric cars must
 be considered a financial and ecological disaster until making the           
 electricity  itself doesn't involve burning fossil fuels, i.e. that          
 "efficient electrical car" is really a slow, coal-burning lump of lead-acid  
 with a remote 100-foot tall exhaust pipe....
If we were all willing to accept the compromises electric cars offer (or until
 superconductors work at 200'f, expect to offer) a Geo Metro at 50 mpg on
 regular gas would by comparison drive like a luxury car yet still keep cheap
 operating costs.  Mandates for electric car production (and their cost to the
 public) would be a lot better placed on (gasp) mass transit burning diesel...

Subject: tires


fyi, at a pca region meeting last night, the yohohama tire rep spoke about 
their tires.  he recommended the A008P Z rated for normal street use.  this 
is a special A008 designed specifically for porsches in cooperation with 
porsche ag and is standard equipment on newer cars.  it has good handling 
with full tread depth for longer mileage (160 tread life).  the A008RS2 
should be used for autocrossing and the A008RS for track events  .  the 
A008RS2 heats up quickly and reacts to sharp turning which is what autoxing 
needs since it's generally once around and then back in line while the 
A008RS is designed for longer warm up and somewhat more gradual turning like 
on a track.  they both have shorter tread depth (6/32 on the center groves 
and 3/32 on the rest so that when the 3/32 wears down there is still some 
groving for the wet).  for a combination of autoxing and track he 
recommended the RS2 over the RS.

his comments on z vs v rating were that while no one in the states will ever 
drive either tire at the sustained speeds of the ratings, the z's are 
designed to have a more "sporty" reaction since they are designed for more 
exotic cars, thus would provide better handling than the v's.

i think this is consistant with what stan and others have advised before.

I haven't read the article, but I think that they meant:

POWER = TORQUE X RPM 

A constant is needed if the units are not the same on both sides of the
equation.  For instance in SI system:

POWER = Watts = Joules/second = (kilogram) (Meter)^2 (second)^-3
TORQUE = Newton*Meter = Joule = (kilogram) (meter)^2 (second)^-2
RPM = revolutions/minute = 2*(pi)/60 radians/second

If the factors are in different units then a constant is used
to convert into compatible dimensional quantities.
Now, one can see that the product of torque and angular velocity
is power.  The reason that power peaks after torque is precisely
because power is the product of the two functions.  As RPM increases,
the torque must decrease faster than RPM is increasing in order
for the power and torque to have the same peak.

HP is just torque time rpm.  The constant is to get the units right.

Peak HP is not in the same place as peak torque because it is torque
* times rpm *.  As long as rpm is increasing faster than torque is
decreasing, the HP continues to increase.

Example:

Suppose the torque peaks at 3000 rpm, is down 10% by 4000 rpm, and is 
down 50% by 5000 rpm.  [Yes, as a matter of fact, I did just make these
numbers up out of thin air]

At 3000 rpm:  HP = 3000*max_torque

At 4000 rpm:  HP = 4000*(.9)*max_torque = 3600*max_torque

At 5000 rpm:  Hp = 5000*(.5)*max_torque = 2500*max_torque

This shows a maximum torque at 3000 rpm and a maximum HP at 4000 rpm.

Make sense?

I think I remember seeing something about this car on TV.  They said
that the hydrogen was locked into a solid, so it wouldn't leak out,
and couldn't explode.  I'm not sure if they meant that it was absorbed
by something, or that they reacted it with something....

   BTW, most people killed in the Hindenburg died from the fall, not the
  fire (god, the humanity...). Hydrogen burns upwards, gasoline will just
  kind of nuke everything. For the same reason that gasoline powered cars
  have a longer mile range, they are bigger potential bombs than any of the
  alternative fuels, yet we live with it....
   I once saw a film where cannisters of gasoline and pressurized hydrogen
  were shot with a rifle; the gasoline turned fiery, the hydrogen just waifed
  away. 
   Think of it this way; how many people have 200 gallon natural gas tanks
  fueling their home ? How often do they blow up ? On the other hand, would
  you feel as secure having a 200 gallon tank of gasoline outside your mobile
  home ?
   Here's something to really think about--imagine how bad the Hindenburg
  accident would've been if they'd filled the balloon with Gasoline instead
  of hydrogen ! Course, the ones who died probably wouldn't have fallen so 
  far....

For what it's worth, in six months of ownership, I have
not been able to get my 76 2.7l 911 to run any hotter than
about 90 degrees C (and this was during a good thrashing at
a driver's school).  My car is a European model, hence no
thermal reactors or air pump, although it does still have 
the 5-blade fan.  It also has the "trombone" style cooler
(even though it's a lowly "911" model with the 165hp engine).
Although most of my driving has been in relatively cool weather, 
I have driven it in 90 degree F weather and the thing takes
forever to make it up to 80C.  

Just wanted to throw this in since I had some relevant
experience.  Of course, having written this, the temperatures
will now skyrocket, I'm sure.

Tom,
	If I recall my physics correctly, what you are referring to are 
the "Black Body" properties of paint. Black paint is the best at 
releasing/absorbing radiation(heat). Flat black is even better at 
releasing/absorbing because it does not have the gloss. The reason why we 
see objects as shiny is because light(heat here) is trapped inside( I know 
this sounds corny but I'm pretty sure that, on a simplified level, this is 
what's going on). What is really important is to make sure that all the 
air from the fan is going where it should(no air leaks). I think that a 
good seal is far more important than whether the paint is gloss or flat. 
Besides, I think that gloss paints look better and they are easier to 
keep clean-In my experience anyway. +8-)

My 84 911 Coupe did this once too.  After playing soccer on a rainy
day, I left wet clothing in the trunk.  It got warm later and I guess
the condensation from the wet clothing steamed up the gauges.  After
removing the wet soccer gear, later that day the condensation evaporated.

I believe the cell holds a spongy material (Lithium based) which forms
a (stable) hydride -- Lithium Hydride.  Not sure about the chemistry

Pfiles,

I haven't seen this mentioned before so here goes.  I bought and
installed the single battery replacement for pre-74 911's with two
batteries listed in the Automotion catalog.  It's a sealed, massively
rugged monster that must weigh 40 pounds and barely fits on it's side
in the left side battery box.  It comes with a bigger tie down strap,
longer ground strap, and a cap which you use to de-militarize the 
battery cable on the right side.

We're talking serious cranking power.  800 amps.  Makes my starter
spin like a turbo. 

Hopefully it will eliminate the boil over effect which ate my trunk
carpets and the nose pan, and last a long time, and not die after
5 days of inactivity.

Anyway,  I wonder if anyone else has done this on their older cars,
and if they know of another source besides automotion.  Automotion
wants 159.00 for it.  Seems worth it now.  We'll see how long it lasts.

_____________________________________________________________________________-

Hoping someone can give me some info.  Big apology in ADVANCE for
posting on a car only 21 years old, but if there is a more
appropriate news group I don;t know which one it is


I am considering selling my 73, 2 liter Porshe 914.  Prices I have
seen in the papers really vary a lot.  It was the special
appointment group with the alloy wheels and console.  No dents, a dw
small door dings.  Needs new battery and brake work, but otherwise
ran great last time we drove it. (garaged 4 years) driven some since
then.  About 80,000 original miles.

Prices in have seen in the paper range from $1500 to $5,000.  Anyone
have access to blue book onthis car or is familiar with them?


Again, apologies if anyone out there would be  horrified that I
might consider this an antique.

The price is very good assuming 1) no rust; 2) interior is not shot 3)
engine is original and has decent compression/oil pressure etc. 4) car
was not in a major collision. One key question would be how long has
this vehicle sat idle and when it did sit idle was it stored properly.
The engine could have rust and the MFI could be coated with evaporated
fuel residue or even have corrosion. Any number of other items might
need replacement such as brake lines, etc., etc.

Subject: Torque vs. HP

I've been reading the discussions on Torque vs. HP
(a subject near and dear to my heart) and have some
other interesting things to add.  Torque is basically
a function of engine displacement.  Engines of similar
design, yet different displacements (e.g. 2.0l to 3.6l
911 engines) will produce torque relatively proportional
to their displacment.  In fact 911 engines produce roughly
63 ft-lbs of torque per liter of displacement.  This factor
varies approximately linearly as a funtion of changes in 
volumetric efficiencies, induction pressures, etc.  The big
thing here is Brake Mean Effective Pressure(BMEP), the pressure
acting on the piston itself due to combustion.  A 15%
increase in BMEP(acheived via increased volumetric efficiency,
turbocharging, whatever) will yield an approx. 15% increase 
in torque, however the interesting thing is that this same 
15% increase in BMEP will yield an approx. 40% increase in HP.
If I'm not mistaken, torque is required for acceleration,
where horsepower defines top speed, hence the large displ.
engines in drag racing(big torque, big acceleration).
 
The old adage "there's no replacement for cubic inches" has 
some technical basis.  If I'm way off on this stuff, somebody
let me know......

Thanks for the indulgence...

        Reply to:   RE>low mileage 911

Steve -

Sounds to me like a good price.  I watch the classifieds every day in the
bay area, just as a matter of interest and potential investment, and this
is slightly higher than others I have seen.  But with the low mileage (and
assuming original, well cared for condition) it looks pretty attractive.

This was a good year for Porsche.  Had the longer wheelbase, slightly
flared wheel wells allowing wider tires, and twin batteries for weight
balance.  The "E" had the hydropneumatic suspension for better ride
control with a gas/oil front strut arrangement for springing and damping.
The downside of this is the $$ replacement cost of the strut.  Many E's
were converted to the normal front suspension.  This is considered
desirable.  Another potential problem was the mechanical injection.
Everyone agrees that when adjusted properly it works very well.  But it
didn't wear well and it is expensive to repair and/or keep tuned.  It also
has trouble with the two-speed emission test, and changing to carbs has
been common (this is an approved change in CA).

In 70, and again in 72, engine size was increased .2 liters.

Hope that helps.  Let us know if you buy it.

Without a little more information it is hard to tell what you might be able to
expect.  The fact that it is a 2L rather than a 1.7 or 1.8 helps.  People like
the 2L engines if they're in good condition, for autoxing.  You didn't say
anything about RUST.  From your addess it looks like you live in California, so
rust may not be that much of a problem.  On the other hand if it's so rusty
that when you take the roof off and sit in the car, you can't close the doors,
that will lower the price considerably.  The mileage is reasonably low for a
20+ year-old car. That's good.  I'll be interested in others' responses.

Subject: rear reflector

When I purchased my 77 911, the rear reflector was not on the car.  When the
previous owner had the car painted, he ordered a new reflector to replace the
previous cracked one.  The reflector came after I picked up the car (minus the
$ for the reflector).  I am not sure if the reflector I now have "works" with
what I have on the car.  On the back of the reflector are 10 threaded ends of
a screw/bolt.  It appears a nut would tighten the reflector to the car. But,
the car just has 10 oval shaped holes with no access to bolt on the reflector.
It looks like there may have been some kind of plate or a clip that it bolted
onto and then pressed into those holes. I don't know and the two manuals 
(owners and Haynes) dont talk about this (Haynes says a little, but not what I
need).  I have called a few parts places, but no one has the parts or think
that what I need is sold separately from the reflector. Can anyone shed some
light?

Subject: 911 runs COLD

Since the wheel of life has turned to "spring" and it's time to plant
flowers, polish cars, and talk about 911 oil temperatures... I have a
slightly unusual complaint about my 83 'SC: the oil runs *cold*.  
On a typical 50F day of town and light freeway driving, it barely makes
it up to 60-70 degrees C., and that takes 15-20 minutes. It doesn't 
get up to the optimum (IMHO) 80-90C range unless the outside 
temp is over 80 F and/or I'm "sporting it" in the 4-5krpm range.
The oil filler cap and pipe have visible water condensation too.
I have at times resorted to reducing the engine airflow (while keeping a
wary eye on the cylinder head temp) to get decent oil temps.

The engine is stock SC, I've checked the oil temp calibration, and the
front cooler thermostat works, i.e. the lines in the rocker panel don't
get hot 'till the temp is 85C or so.  The touch test on the
engine-mounted cooler was inconclusive as it is surrounded by other hot
parts; I suppose the next step is to probe its core with a
thermocouple... but it's easier to ask the experts ! :-).  
Is this normal behavior for a 911 of this vintage?  Should I suspect a
stuck thermostat?  Has anyone else had this "problem"?

From Pete Jones:  My shop, Specialty Motorwerkes, uses nothing but
Mobil 1, and has great results. For example, they indicate that synthetic
(actually a synthetic mix with Mobil 1) will let you run your engine much
hotter without requiring an extra oil cooler. I've used Mobil 1, Amsoil,
Kendall, and Castrol in my 2.7 911 engine in a 914/6. Mobil 1 is worth the
money for the protection. Kendall is the best petrol oil I've used, because
it holds up under extreme conditions and heat. Its thick and black
out of the bottle. Castrol is about the worst you can use - even the
20w50 is thin, and its gets thinner under heat. My shop has warned me
about it (they call it "piss water"), and I've used it only once. Castrol
Syntec may be good, but it costs more than Mobil 1. For what its worth...

Subject: What good are hp curves? (was Re: Torque vs HP)

I've long since wondered what the value was in a HP curve.  It's
basically just a derivative of a torque curve (p=t*rpm).
Once you know what a torque curve looks like you have all you need to
know about the speed characteristics of the engine.

Now I agree that giving a peak HP rating on cars/engines is a good
measure for laymen to compare engines, but just that number
doesn't tell you anything about the engine characteristics.  It gives
you ONE data point.  That tells you about the engine at ONE point.  So
what?

I also feel that this number can be manipulated so easily into making
poor engines look good.  F'rinstance if you have a very peaky engine
where significant torque is only available in a narrow band, by
tweaking the engine to control where that band is you can get very
high HP numbers.  But you STILL have a poor engine design.
(Note I'm talking about engines for the average driver, not race
engines where the tranny is designed and the driver is trained to keep
the revs in a narrow range.)

I'd like to see torque vs RPM graphs on cars instead if some peak
horsepower value.  OK, so still publish the HP for the gear blanks
(the opposite of a gearhead!) think they have a number to compare.
But somewhere in the documentation/article/brochure include a graph.

Any opinions?

Subject: re: gears, torque and power

I liked Caldwell's article too, but some of his conclusions didn't
match some of his figures. As I remember it, he had some changes below
redline, whereas his tables of torques indicated that revving to
redline was preferable.

Of course, this is all for max performance. A more mundane question
is how one should shift in ordinary traffic with a flexible engine,
where one might want to accelerate in 1st and 2nd to 40 0r so, but
then go to 4th for economy. Do you skip 3rd, and wear out the synchromesh
more, or go to 3rd and then 4th at almost the same speed, or stay in 3rd ...?

On performance, the question of maximum performance shifting came up
a year ago:

Frank Kerfoot writes:
>>
To determine the optimum shift points, find a plot of the torque
curve versus RPM for your engine. For each gear, multiply the torque
by the gear ratio, and also use the gear ratio to convert RPM to MPH.
Now plot rear wheel torque (neglecting losses) versus MPH. There will
be 5 different lines on the plot, for the rear wheel torque versus
speed in each of the 5 gears. In virtually all of the cars I have
done this for (including my 87 944S 16 valve), the torque at the
rear wheels at the red line in the lower gear is still higher than
the torque in the next higher gear. Assuming that is the case for
your car, shift at the red line. Otherwise, shift (for that gear
change) at the place where the lines cross (i.e. where the rear wheel
torque will be higher in the higher gear than the lower).
<<

An easier method is to see when the power output in the lower gear
(past the power peak) equals the power output in the higher gear.
This is because power is proportional to torque times engine speed,
and avoids having to scale up the torque curves. Also, if the
ratio in engine speeds of the redline to the speed where the power
matches that at redline is closer than any gap between adjacent
gears, then shifting at redline is optimal.

Growing up in England, I heard a lot of garbage like "shift so that
the speed in the higher gear is the torque peak." Actually, the
torque peak is rather insignificant, despite the play given to it
in the press. The reason is that the torque peak is usually rather
ill defined, with a fairly broad flat area with almost random bumps on it.
A better measure is something like "150 lb.ft. are available from 2000 rpm
to 6000 rpm" or "80% of the maximum torque is ... ," which you
sometimes see.

Peter, with all due respect, you are talking nonsense.  Any of the name
brand motor oils, including Castrol and Kendall, are fine.   They are
all tested and certified to offer particular viscosity and lubrication
characteristics.  Castrol is no thicker or thinner than any other oil
"out of the bottle" or at any relevent operating temperature.  That
an oil is black, green, or pink has no bearing on its suitability.

No one person's or car's history should be taken to be a sweepingly
positive or negative indicator, but I would like to share mine with you.
I have used Castrol mineral oil in my '87 944S since new, switching to
Mobil 1 in the summer only last year.  I switched because, having installed
an oil temp sender, I learned that my temp's were as high as 300F at the
track.

I've since made a few improvements to get the temperature down.  But the
point is that I ran excessive temperature in my car with Castrol for
a number of years.  We did the bottom end a few months ago, preventative
maintenance.  After all that abuse, the rod bearings were utterly perfect;
I have 'em saved in a box for any doubting Thomas' out there!

adjustment on my 83 944.  I received a number of helpful responses and have
compiled them.  If anyone would like a copy of the complete thread, I would be
happy to send it to them.  If there is sufficient interest, I will submit a
summarized version of the thread to Porschephiles.

In short, it was as simple as I could have hoped.  I just found the idle speed
adjustment screw, which was located on the right side of the throttle body, and
gave it about a full turn counterclockwise, which brought the idle speed up
smartly to what appears from the tach to be about 900 rpm.

Thanks again!

Subject: Re: 911 runs COLD

I'm about to pick up my '77 911S with newly installed '78 3.0l engine this
morning.  According to my mechanic, everything works perfect except the
tach.  We even put the tach from the '78 into my car and it's still not
working.  We did move the CD ignition from the '78, as well as the starter
from teh '78 into my '77.

Any suggestions?

I've decided to run Kendall oil, and change every 3K, rather than
expensive Mobil 1, and then run for longer periods of time.

Does anyone know how long Porsche will manufacture the 993? I was told by a
friend that the 993 will be the last 911 series design and will be dropped
soon. Is this true or is my friend just blowing smoke?

Subject: tires for '77 911s

I am looking for suggestions on tires for my '77 911S.  I currently have
205/50s on 16*7 wheels on the rear (occasional scraping), and 205/60s on
15x7 on the fronts, which are fine.

From reading Bruce Anderson's book (p. 185), it seems that the size for
the fronts are OK, but the rears seem odd.

Bruce recommends 15*8 rear wheels with 215/60 tires, or 16*8 wheels with
225/50 tires.

I can't understand why the previous owner of my car put 15*7 rear wheels
on, whcih seem like they should be front wheels?

Any recommendations on brands or size changes for the rears?  I'd like
something VR rated, and not too expensive.  I just paid 5K for a new used
3.0l engine, which so far is running excellent.  

The oil pressure is running high on my '77 gauges, adn the tach isn't yet
working (tach and engine are from '78 911), though I do have the CD
ignition, as well as starter from the '78.  My '77 needed the '78's
starter for power or something to do with cold starting.

Subject: Composite fan - 356/912

Has anyone heard about a composite (possibly Kevlar) cooling fan for the 356
and 912? Two fellows at the local parts place had heard about such a thing,
mentioned it to me, but couldn't remember where they had seen it. I haven't
seen anything in 356 Registry either.
 
My fan let go last Monday, taking the fan shroud and oil cooler with it.
Happened at 6000 rpm, full load, going uphill. Fortunately one of the
escaping blades also knocked loose the throttle linkage, so revs went to
idle immediately. I have it all back together now with another (old) 356
fan, but as fatigue seems to be a problem, this composite thing, if it
really exists, would be a better solution.

Subject: 914 glass

Hi gang,

Sorry if this is a repeat question, but now that financial aid has been
approved I can actually consider doing some minor work on my 914.  
Motivation also provided thanks to the 944 going through another water
pump.  I am really ready to say NO H2O!

I would like to reattach the driver's door glass.  It has separated
completely from the frame.  I have estimates that vary from $50-$75,
but I am curious as to whether or not I can do the work myself at less
cost.  

I think I have all the tools I need to remove the inner door panel.
As far as technique and order of items I am not so sure...like the
window crank, for instance.  I also do not know which adhesive would
be best for the job, and if any special tools are required for the
application.  Also, I need an approximation of the weight of the glass
to see if I can maneuver it into place (hopefully without breaking it).
It would be nice if this was a one day job since it seems to rain 
just enough to create havoc whenever I attempt to do anything with
these cars.  

Also, as a side note, has anyone come up with a fairly reliable technique
to use the windshield washer fluid system and not end up with either a 
flat or very low pressure spare tire?

Comments, hints, gotchas all welcome.

I can help with a VERY small part of your questions.  I have had the interior
door panel off my 914 to reattach the vinyl cover in a couple of places.  It's
very easy to get off, as I recall.  First remove everything on the inside
surface of the panel.  Armrest/covered map holder if you have one, window
crank, and door latch.  Those all come off with a screwdriver.  The screws are
clearly visible on all but the window crank.  To find the screw on that, gently
pull away the soft black vinyl cover over the arm of the crank, and the screw
is right underneath it.  The panel itself is attached with tabs at the window
ledge, and phillips screws at the bottom.  Remove the screws, and gently pull
the panel about 1" away from the door (toward the inside of the car) then lift.
 The tabs should lift right out of their slots, and voila, there's all the
werkes...door latch/lock, window mechanism, etc.  That's as much as I know. 
Good luck!

71 911T engine transplanted into Vanagon is running better and better as I

some speed ranges.  Only happens under load, so I can't track it closely, but
I think it is the heater box housings vibrating against their enclosed pipes.

Subject: Taking Seats Apart

Hello P-philes,

I discovered a problem this weekend while taking the seats out of 
my '82 931.  These are the original leather seats that seem to be 
essentially the same as those found in 944s and 911s.  I am 
trying to separate the seatback from the bottom part so I can get 
some new welting installed.  The side with the ratchet that 
adjusts the seatback angle is no problem.  Removal of two bolts 
got it off.  The other side has a single pin (bolt?) at the pivot 
point where seatback meets the bottom cushion.  This pin has what 
appears to be a slot for a standard screwdriver.  Attempts to 
turn this pin with a screwdriver using a reasonable amount of 
force have proven fruitless.  This is preventing me from 
detaching the seatback from the cushion.

Does anyone know how this arrangement works?  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: 944 Tires

As a follow-on to Ted's inquiry regarding tires for his '77 911, I need a pair
of new tires for my '83 944.  I have the original stock wheels that came with
the car.  I don't know how wide they are, but I do know that they are 15 inches.

The original tires are Pirelli 215x60.  Right now, I have a set of Yokohama
195/60 snow tires mounted for those weekend runs up to Whistler.  However,
spring is rapidly approaching and so it is time for me to consider my options.

I was thinking of putting the two remaining good tires on the front and putting
something wider and lower profile on the rear.  I don't know how wide or low I
can go with the existing wheels.  I figure that 225x50 is safe.  Can I go wider
and/or lower?

I am also interested in any recommendations anyone may have in terms of brands
and models.

Subject: 86 vs. 88 911

I am currently searching for a new(er) 911.  I have found two
nice-looking candidates, one an 86 and the other an 88.  Both are
red/black, and seem to be generally in very good condition.  The
prices are actually pretty close, in part because the 86 has only 50K
miles while the 88 has around 70K. I have not yet had either one
inspected.  So, I am looking for information on the differences
between these two model years.  I understand that several changes were
made for the 87 model year, and that the 87-89 cars are pretty
similar.

I know about:

The new transmission.
Hydraulic clutch.
Higher horsepower rating (how much?)

What else should I know about?
Are these changes going to make a big impact on my enjoyment of the
car?  How?  Longevity or drivability (or both)?

Also, without starting a "best tire" war, anyone care to contrast the
Dunlop D40 M2 with Pirelli P7's?  I have heard that the P7's are
rather "abrupt" tires, giving away suddenly when pushed past the
limit.  Certainly the Dunlop's are a more modern tire, right?  Is that
worth much?

Thanks in advance for your consideration.

I've recently been solving the same problem with my Beetle (it uses the same
tyre flatting high pressure technique.

What I've done is to get hold of a water bottle (with pump) off of a Mk1 Golf
(Rabbit .. we've always called it a golf). I mounted in the front boot by
re-arranging it's mounting bracket (hacksaw and power drill time I'm afraid).

Then I wire it in by changing the pump switch on the wash wipe stalk to an
electrical switch (you could go out and buy an early Rabbit wash wipe switch 
it should look the same).

Further refinments include getting a wash wipe relay so that it wipes the 
windscreen when you wash it.... 

Total time including figuring out time about 2 hours.

The window crank is a good place to start.  Carefully pry off the plastic 
covering at the large end of the crank and you'll see the only screw holding
it in place.  Remove that screw and pull the crank off the splined shaft.
You'll also need to remove the storage compartment on the door since that
mounts to the door structure.  Next, remove the screw which holds the
plastic covering plate for the door release handle, and remove the cover
plate.  Now the door panel can be removed using a screwdriver with as wide
of a blade as you can get.  There are a series of plastic fasteners around
the outer edge of the door panel which tend to break if too much force is
used.  Then again, 20+ year old plastic breaks easily anyway.  I have seen
these fasteners at good body shops, so they are replaceable.  If you need
the factory work sequence or the exploded views, I can send them to you.

Not too heavy.  (Sorry...that's the best I could do.)  You shouldn't

track, then lift the other side and put in more adhesive.

I bought an Anco washer pump , replaced the water valve in the steering 
column with a small electrical switch  and did a little re-routing of 
the washer hoses.  The pump cost about $11, and I have a bunch of the
switches if you need one (no charge).  I mounted the pump between one of
the heater control boxes and the blower fan where it's easy to replace if
necessary.  The switch threaded into the plastic plate to which the washer
valve normally mounts, so the washer lever still operates the washer.  I
like the fact that the conversion required only two holes to be drilled.
(to mount the pump)  You can _easily_ do this conversion in a day.  If you 
want more info, give me a shout.  Good luck, Pam!

Subject: torque tube replacement/rebuilding


     I am nervous that the torque tube (aka the driveshaft assy for you rear
    engined guys) in my 928 may be near its death, I hear a small rattle (in
    gear, in motion) that goes away out of gear with the clutch in....

   1. 10 years ago when a friend replaced the one in his 924, rebuilt
      torque tubes weren't available, nor were the bearings themselves to
      have it done. Does anybody know whether this still holds, or does
      anybody have any experience rebuilding or buying a rebuilt assy ?

   2. What kind of symptoms has anybody had to diagnose worn bearings in
      the torque-tube ? My friend's 924 suffered severe vibration when
      engaging/disengaging the clutch, I don't experience any kind of
      clutch shudder at all. What kind of mileage, etc has anyone gotten
      from their 928/944 without replacing theirs ?
 
   3. Does anybody know (on a 928) whether the transaxle has to be pulled
      down and out of the car ? Or is it pretty easy to do it ?

         Thanks in advance, I haven't gotten underneath the car yet but
       its nice to know in advance what I'm looking at...

The reason I went through the bother of replotting the torque curve
5 times with different gear ratio multipliers is that there is a great
deal of misunderstanding out there about the whole issue, and the most
straightforward analysis begins with F=M*A, and F=(rear axle torque)/
(rear wheel radius). Since acceleration is thus a linear function of
rear axle torque, and velocity is the integral of acceleration, a
shifting algorithm which maximizes rear axle torque at each speed also
maximizes acceleration and thus maximizes velocity at any given
distance.

You are of course right that it is possible to make the comparison
more easily on a HP plot, without as much work in terms of replotting.
A helpful way to get an intuitive picture of this is to assume a lossless
transmission, and thus the same HP at the rear axle as a function of
engine RPM as at the flywheel. Of course, torque at the rear axle is
now HP divided by rear axle RPM, thus including the effect of gear
ratios. Now the gear producing maximum HP at the rear axle also
produces maximum acceleration at that car speed.

A direct plot of rear axle torque is clearer than the above HP perspective,
which (hopefully) gives the same answers. BTW, from a quick glance, my
approach is exactly what Caldwell did in the recent Panorama. Another
benefit of the "rear axle torque vs. car speed" plot is that it makes
it clearer how much you give up in acceleration by, for instance,
shifting below the red line on the track to avoid an inconvenient shift
in the middle of a sequence of corners. In some cases being in the next
higher gear costs a lot of axle torque, in other cases the penalty is
small. Of course the same data is in the HP plots, with a bit more
interpretation.

  Pam and Paul,
  Openers for Monday.
  Doin' glass huh, Ive got both my doors off my '73 splayed apart in boxes.
You did not say what year the car was (later years use different window
regulator gizmo's) starting in '72 or '73.  Im not clear on what you mean
by the glass has separated from the frame...do you mean the glass is loose
at the front where the guide is?  The fasteners work loose on that one.
Also, the rubber welting is that fuzzy stuff that packs down after many 
years, making things gradually more loose.

  The glass is not heavy, it is mounted at the lower edge to a steel 
subframe, but the window itself is pretty lite.  Im glad to tell you that
this door can be taken apart while on the car, and all the guts will come
out without removing the skin or cutting rivets.  The only adhesives used
are in the plastic film moisture barrier...i tape that back in place.
  The door panel is held on with nylon snap plugs at intervals along the
bottom and up part way, pry these carefully with a screwdriver or maybe
a stout putty knife.  You will be lucky if you get all of them out without
breaking or pulling one thru the prestboard...this can be fixed with epoxy.
  Remove all hardware from the door before trying to remove the inner panel.
  The window cranks come off with a phillips screw in the center of the
handle BEHIND the plastic cover, you have to pry that up with stout 
fingernails or screwdriver.  The door panel has hook clips along the top
edge of the door that MUST be disengaged by pushing up on the panel while
kinda sorta pulling away, you may have to use a pretty good whack instead
of a push up on the panel.  THIS IS IMPORTANT
  You should be able to slog thru it in one day, the guts are smaller than
anything american i've ever worked on.  Once inside you should be able to
determine the problem and get right to the fix.

  Tweeks does sell most of the parts for refurbishing your doors at a
reasonable cost although the parts may not be OEM.

  I have seen kits to convert the windshield washer pee'er to an electric
pump.  I have been considering this for my cars as well,  The hooks are in
place in the dash wiring for operating a relay to power a pump, but i have
not pursued this beyond dream phase.

Hi there!

One of the previous owners of my 914 converted the washing system from
pressure from the spare tire to an electric pump. It works real well...
except that they forgot to create some sort of vent on the fluid tank.
So now if I open up the tank at a low altitude, then drive up into the
mountains a bit of washer fluid dribbles out one of the nozzels. I think
the cap for the tank has some sort pressure relief valve in it. I'm either
going to try to talk it into being a vent, or just drill a hole in the cap.

Yes, the 951 is firmer all around.  The 951 also has a sport suspension

If you have an 85/2 944, the upgrade should be easy (...), with some 
labor and an alignment afterwards.  Doing the rear torsion springs is 
harder, as you must drop the tube to gain access to the springs.

Subject: Re: tires for '77 911s

Ted,

     Normally your car would have all 15" or all 16" wheels,
depending on owner preference.  The front wheels would be 6"
wide, the rears 7" wide.  These widths were later increased to 7"
on the front and 8" on the rear.  Your setup of using the same
width front and rear, and a different diameter front and rear, is
unusual, although the sizes fit.  It's hard to say why it was
done.  Perhaps some swapping was done to get the desired sizes on
another car.

     If you want a standard setup, the aggressive and more
expensive way to go would be 7s front and 8's rear, the cheaper
is 6's front, 7's rear.  You can get 6's for about 150/pair, 7's
for about 350/pair, and 8's are more yet.  The prices go up
exponentially with width.  Of course you can sell your uneeded
pair.

     Opinions vary widely on tire/wheel combinations.  Most SCs
came with 16" wheels, some with 15".  The 16" were the "sport
option".  However, the 15" with 50 profile tires are popular at
autoXs because you at once lower both the gear ratio, and the
car.  Originally the 15" wheels were intended for 60 profile
tires, providing a more comfortable ride.    Suggest you get one
of those $8 spec books for your car to help in deciding.  Tires
are too expensive to buy for the wrong sized wheels.

Subject: Sources for Euro-spec Mahle pistons?


Hi,

Has anybody out there got a 'favorite' source for euro-spec Porsche parts? 
 I'm
particularly interested in places that deal with Mahle.

The story is that I've been rebuilding a much-abused 931 powerplant for the 
past
couple of months, and would very much like to install higher compression 
European-spec pistons to help out its somewhat anemic low-end performance. 
 I know that these are Mahle pistons and that they _aren't_ on the US parts 
fiche.

I've been in contact all the "regular" P-parts sources (automotion, gpr, 
stoddard, pap, etc), a couple of the big-name performance houses (eg, 
andial), and Porsche Motorsports (they don't do parts anymore), but nobody 
seems to know how to go about getting these.  I found one helpful guy at a 
place called Rennsport in Charleston, SC who says he knows someone who can 
get them, but he's been promising me this since January, and it seems 
unlikely that this will pan out.

Any other ideas, anyone?  Pointers to a less widely known parts place or 
even to someone who's still racing Carrera GT's would be helpful.  I'm about 
ready to throw
 in the towel on this quest an put in stock pistons, but I'd really rather 
not.

    Some of the screws are Allen screws--in particular, the ones at the upper
corners of the drivers side armrest.  Also, the door latch is not removed, just
the black plastic backing plate.  Neither of the 914s I have done this to has
been screwed in along the bottom--they have been held on by white plastic
triangular-shaped pins that fit into holes in the door frame.  They are just
pulled out.  Pull out the bottom and sides of the panel, then pull the whole
thing upwards to disengage the tabs along the top.  Hopefully your plastic-wrap
stuff is still on the door.  If it is, you should get some cement to put it
back in place after your repair.
    Window glass, I don't know nothin' 'bout.

It depends on what you mean by the 993.  Two years ago, Porsche was saying
that they would update the chassis (the 993) for MY95 and install a new
engine for MY97, making the car a 996.  The 986 was to be introduced in MY96,
in between the two.  For MY97, the 3.9 liter V8 from the aborted 989 project
(4 door Porsche) would also be available in the 996 chassis.  The 993 chassis
has more room in the engine bay for these future projects (bigger flares/
wheel wells).  The new engines are assumed to be water-cooled. 

Now they are saying that the 993 may be continued in its current form for
more than 2 years.  To distribute capital costs, or a ruse to keep selling
them, who knows?

Thanks to everyone who sent me mail or posted on my wheel/tire questions
for '77 911S.

Please note that this is NOT an SC, nor does it have flared fenders. 
Therefore, I am sticking with 15" wheels all around.  My 16" wheels rub,
and I can't see how offset or spacers will fix.  Only way I can see
running 16" wheels without rubbing on stock '77 911S is to use say a
195x45 tire or less.

So, I have 2 16*7 wheels with V rated tires (tread is pretty low on them),
gold BBS mags for sale or trade.

I am looking to buy matching BBS mags, pref. used in size 15*6, 15*7, or
15*8. 

If anyone could easily re-send their tire replies, I'll address each
individually, I've asked my system manager to restore, but I had a smal
crash in my mail dir today.  Thanks very much.

Also, am leaning toward Yokohama tires, as I've had a lot of positive
responses on them here, my use is 95% street for now, maybe some
autocross/track later, but will probably get special tires for that.

Thanks,

The front springs and the rear torsion bars on 951's up to (but not
including) the 951S are interchangable with those in standard 944's (and
in the 944S). However, there is also little or nothing to gain. The
rear torsion bars are identical (23.5 mm). If you want something stiffer
there, you need to go to the 951S torsion bars (25.5 mm), or to the
aftermarket (Sway-away makes a 25 mm and a 26 mm). Note that stiffness
varies as the 4th power of the diameter, so a little increase goes a long
way. In the front, the 944 and 951 springs are different to account for
the small difference in weight, but they have the same spring rate, just
different unloaded heights. Thus a swap there also won't help. Again,
the aftermarket is the answer. 951S springs won't fit.

On the swaybar issue, Porsche put a very wide range of swaybars on these
cars, some solid and some hollow. As a general rule, the 951 bars were
not significantly stiffer than the optional bars on the 944 (if at all).
The later cars had stiffer front bars (25.5 mm and 26.8 mm, among others),
so an option is to try to find one of those. Note that the 25.5 mm and the
26.8 mm bars are hollow, so be careful in stiffness comparisons, even
considering the 4th power rule (if you want to do some calculating, the
stiffness goes as the (OD)**4 - (ID)**4). If you stiffen the front bar,
make sure you stiffen the rear end as well. In general, the rear may
need more stiffness than the front, to dial out some understeer. However,
the 944s don't seem to respond as well to rear tuning around the street
settings. If you experiment and get any reasonable insights, please
post them.

Another issue with swaybar replacement is the brackets. Several people
from our region (JSR) used a 25.5 mm bar from a 1987 car on an 85 944
and a 86 951, and had a lot of problems with lateral movement of the bar.
Looking in the parts fiche, the only difference seemed to be the
swaybar mounting brackets. I believe that at least one of these guys
tried the newer brackets, with success (the other went to aftermarket
bars). I don't know why the bracket design caused the bar to walk
laterally more or less.

mechanism.  Is 6 mil plastic sheeting too thick?  Also, should I remove 
all the lock mechanism work to get the plastic sheeting underneath it, 
or cut a hole and seal to the plastic that still remains there?  In 
other words, how critical is a tight seal?  This will be hidden, and 
I'm hoping to stay out of this area for a while.  

Thanks for all the support and
here's hoping it all goes back together again :)

Robert,
  Thanks very much for this info.  After hearing from several others, I've
decided to try to go 15" all away around, unless I can find a tire for my
16*7 rears that will not scrape, and still keep the car level and handle
well.

My other choice is to sell my 16*7's or trade for some 15*6 or 15*8 rear
wheels.

You didn't say what year your car is.  Height has been mucked with
in the US because of bumper laws; I think this affected 911s from
'75 to mid (early?) 80's.  And I know that the higher bumpers caused
a problem with handling that was managed by alignment changes.
Supposedly a good ride height is 25" from ground to rear fender lip
(this is the Euro spec), with a slight downward angle to the nose
(~1 degree).  The workshop manual has a more precise method for
measuring at the torsion bars.  If your car is affected by the bozo
bumper laws you might want to address camber, caster, and toe-in
at the time you change the ride height.

Does the car seem to low because it's bottoming out, or some other
performance reason?  A lower ride should make for better handling
if it's done right.

Speaking of lateral swaybar movement, the rear swaybar on my '74 914 2L
suddenly started sliding side-to-side a few days ago. Makes a horrid
clunking sound that I initially thought was a loose shock or something
rolling around in the trunk.

The ends of the bar are attached to the bottom shock mounts via a 3-4"
bracket with ball joints on each end (which lets the swaybar move easily
from side-to-side).  It appears that the swaybar is held in place only
by the friction of two rubber bushings attached to the underside of the
rear truch with a couple of U brackets.

Is this really the case? Seems pretty insubstantial for something as
important as a swaybar...  The Haynes manual makes it sound
straightforward to replace -- are there any gochyas I ought to know

     Sorry to hear you had a 356/912 Exploding Fan. Fortunately, these are

careful- there are two types of hub/fan/shim/nut combo- the pre-67 912 Style

Very Special hub and fan.  Oh, and it's best NOT to stick the pulley end of

a sheared-off key/keyway. An Air Impact Wrench with knowledge of the Torque
(not HP) produced is nerted to tighten them thar nuts down sufficiently but
let's not overdo it.
Please remember that the Fan in a 356/912 is driven at almost TWICE
Crankshaft speed, and ifin you like 6000RPM all the tme, your and is going

Your description sounds about right (from memory) for the factory 914
rear bar. If you think about it, virtually all of the force is vertical,
not horizontal. The ball joints on the links are designed to apply
only torsional forces to the sway bar itself. However, as you note,
there are still some second order forces which cause the bar to move
laterally. My recollection is that on my 914, I used a pair of hose
clamps, one on each side, against the inside of each rubber bushing,
to constrain the position of the bar. The lateral forces were small
enough that I had no problem after that. BTW, we tried the same hose 
clamp trick on the shifting 944 front bar, but it didn't work there.

Pam,
You asked about removing the inner door panels of a 914. Aside from the previous
advise, I would add:
The door panel is held by a series of plastic "snaps" that snap into holes in
the door. Be carefull to pry with a flat
tool <near> these snaps <gingerly> because often the snaps break out of the
hardboard that stiffens the door panel.
You might want to buy some 1 mil plastic drop cloth to replace the plastic
sheeting just inside the door panel. Use rubber cement to glue the sheeting on.

I don't know how to glue the window to the frame. Perhaps you could get a
window/frame from a junk yard and save yourself the anguish of having to redo
this whole thing again?

You asked about the windshield washer system which depends on the spare tire for
pressure. After replacing all of the associated tubing and fittings to no avail,
I finally gave up and bought a "universal replacement" washer pump from a
discount auto store and put it in the front trunk far away from the passengers
(it's noisy). To supply the pump with current, I rigged up a push-button (Radio
Shack) through the  extra holes predrilled in the dash. The original system was
really hair-brained anyway. Had the same system on my Karmann Ghia (may it rest

I (6'1") too have found this while shopping for either 911's or 928's - I
figured that this must simply be a seat rail or adjustment problem.  But
perhaps not?  Mind you, the older 911's weren't nearly as tight as the

    My 911 coupe was originally owned by a ball player for the Houston

 work with drives an SC Targa (with the top on), he is 6'5" or 6'6" (in
 fact he used to drive 356s when he was younger but as tall).
   The 928 is probably the biggest inside, just avoid any car with a sunroof,
 only drive on bumpy roads with the seat belt on and you should be okay...

Full leather means the whole seat is leather covered (but not sure 
about the back), whereas partial leather means only the seat face is 
leather; the bolsters and other "trim" areas are leatherette (more 
luxurious form of noun "vinyl").  1/2 leather is probably partial leather.

Sport seats have more lateral support (big side bolsters) and feel 
narrower.  "Comfort seats" are standard, and have smaller, more open 
bolstering.  In the case of recent vintage Porsches, sport/non-sport 
doesn't imply electrics or vice-versa.  For a while, a passenger sport 
seat did not come with electrics.

One constant difference is that comfort seats had an option for 12-way 
adjustable everything, but sport seats only came 4-way (front & rear 
height electric - all else manual).

Sport seats (non-leather preferred) are nearly mandatory in my opinion 
if you like spirted or track/competition driving.  Comfort seats are 
fine for everyday use, or for the girth-challenged.

     The fact that my 1988 944 looks and runs better than ever is 
     bittersweet now that the opportunity to buy a friend's '89 Carrera is 
     too much to ignore.  So I'm selling the '44.
     
     It's "guess what color?" Red with Black Porsche Cloth 
     interior (the cloth makes the interior very quiet)
     
     90K miles with most maintenance updates (no turbo mounts but not 
     needing them for a while)
     
     The car has adjustable Koni's, new pads/rotors up front, pads rear, 
     all fluids (including clutch), new Pirelli tires, camshaft housing 
     gasket, water pump, belts, hoses (where needed), oxygen sensor and is 
     crowned with a new hood badge.
     Exterior and interior are perfect.  Engine in peak tune.  Wheel finish 
     a little dull.  Blaupunkt Monterey cassette
     No track or autocross.  Very tight / no rattles.
     This car needs nothing (planned) for next year of motoring!
     
     Price is negotiable $12,000ish.
     
     Oh, the Carrera has only 26k miles, in concours condition and i'm paying 
     wholesale NADA.  Twist my arm.

Hi Brian.

You turn the horn 'button' about an 1/8th of a turn counterclockwise
and it'll pop off (it's fastened with an arrangement similar to how
most gas caps are held in place -- not the screw-on kind 914's have.
It's also similar to the way most radiator caps are held on). There
should be a short black wire running from the button to the part that
is still attached to the car. It ends in a push-together connector.
Just unplug it.

Unscrew the large nut. I don't know what size it is, but it was larger
than any of my combination wrenches. I had to use an all-1/8ths
wrench. :-)

At this point I don't know if you'll need a wheel puller of some sort
or not. Mine came apart with just a few taps to the backside of the
steering wheel.

Installation is the reverse of removal. :-) The only problem I had
when I put it back together was making sure that the small black wire
didn't get pinched when I put the button back on...it makes the horn
constantly beep when you drive the car -- REAL annoying! :-)

    As far as I know, it's just called the "spec book."  It's a little tiny
thing (just over cigarette-pack size) that contains a lot of useful information
about the particluar car.  Automotion often has them...  Give 'em a call or

Kyle says:

but when i went to adjust the parking brake, only one side would give drag

Maybe I am mis-understanding your problem but, there is a hex screw on
*BOTH* sides of the caliper.  You need to adjust *BOTH* sides of the brake,
not just the outside.  Look on the engine side of the trailing arm.  You
will see a hole through the arm.  This allows access to the inside screw.
You must remove the slotted cover screw to get to the hex and then adjust
it the same way as the outside (.006" clearance). Note that the inside does
NOT have a locking nut.

Just in case I have completely misread what you are saying, and the problem
is that pulling on the emergency brake lever produces no tension on the
cable to the left caliper, look behind the driver's side outside seat rail
and see if the cable has come off the T shaped (sort of) bracket that pulls
the left and right side cables in unison.

Hope this helps!

I have the factory sport seats in my 87 911.  They are electric for tilt/height of
the base, but back angle and front to back movement is manual.  I was told
by the dealer that full electric was not available in the sport seat, and
that all the sport seats came in with electric base tilt/height.

As far as leather, the porsche price list allows you to specify leather down to
the individual dash board knob....its really humorous (I don't know if it is
that way anymore).  You could literally order leather, piece by piece anywhere in
the interior. If the original owner did not custom order the car, most
sport seats have leather tops and vinyl sides and backs.  The factory sport seats
are extremely comfortable...if you can find a car with them, it is a plus.

I would try it without any puller first. Remove the horn button, and remove
the (large) nut using the steering wheel to counteract the wrench forces.
You will need a socket and an extension to reach the nut.
Then try just pulling on the wheel, or some banging with your hands on the
backs of the spokes. On all of my Porsches, this has gotten the wheel
off. The hardest part will probably be getting the nut loose.

Subject: Re: Helmets



There are 3 basic classes of helmuts:

1. Unrated Helmuts:
   These are typically sold at K-Mart or out of the J.C. Whitney
   catalog.  They are not rated by Snell, but may be rated by
   ANSI.  For racing purposes, these are useless.  Many people
   use these for snowmobiling, dwarf tossing, heaving drinking, etc.

2. Snell M-XX, where XX is the certification year the helmut meets
   M stands for Motorcycle.  These helmuts will protect your head
   and are okay for autocrossing.  If you go this route, get the
   newest rating (i.e. M-90).  This will keep it from being obsoleted
   as the safety rules change (M-85 is ususlly the minimum for SCCA
   and PCA autocrossing).  These helmuts are usually lined with nylon
   to make them comfortable.  My Shoie (sp?) open-face M-90 helmut 

   cost me $120.  It's a good helmut, but there are less expensive
   ones that will work as well.

3. Snell SA-XX where XX means the same as with the M helmuts
   SA helmuts are designed primarily for automobile racing.  There 

   is generally some change in helmut structure to handle multiple
   impacts (car rolling) rather than single impact which M helmuts
   are primarily designed for.  SA helmuts also typically are lined
   with Nomex or other fire-retardant materials to keep the helmut
   from melting to your head in the event of a fire.  Most high-speed
   competition (time-trials, club racing, etc.) require SA rated 

   helmuts for all classes.  I think they're mandatory for all 

   open-cockpit cars.  I recently purchased a Simpson Shark
   (Kevlar full-face) because I might do some open wheel at a driver's
   school, and it's lighter than all but the most expensive Bell or
   Stand 21 helmuts of the same rating. It also came with a nifty
   helmut bag, 2-visors, and some tear-offs. Simpson and Bell both make
   helmuts in SA-90 for as little as $200 of varying styles.

That's about all I have to add.  If I've mis-represented anything here, 

I'm sure others will correct me..;-)

I have sports seats with full leather (1984 vintage though, so no
electrics) and the leather covers the entire seat, including back -
I guess this is why full leather is so expensive! The only adjustment
is forward/back and back angle.

I recommend the sports seat at any time if you can afford it, as
comfort is very high and posture is kept at a good angle. I
personally like the full leather too (it's the B&D part of me).
I haven't sat for any length of time in the 928 seats though.

I agree that a Torque graph gives you all you need to know.  However,
it is a heck of a lot easier to get a quick "feel" for the engine
characteristics when given the two values:  Torque@RPM and HP@RPM.

You can tell at a glance if the engine is a "revver" or a "grunter".
You can also get a feel as to how wide the torque band is.  Further,
the bottom line in acceleration is HORSEPOWER!  I would rather have
200 ft-lb at 6000 rpm than 300 ft-lb at 3000 rpm (of course having
both would be great!).  You would end up with greater torque at the 
wheel using a lower gear.  Only horsepower numbers tell the whole
story EASILY.

Concerning this issue, I saw an interesting chart in the catalog of
a BMW Go-Fast shop (Metric Mechanic, I think????).  They reduced an
engine's "Fun" to the simple ratio of HP/Torque in ft-lbs (HP in HP--
what else? -- fun with units!).  They said that engines that were
the most "fun" had a ratio near 1.0.  Engines with ratios much above
1.1 tended to be kind of high-strung (think of a Japanese motorcycle).
Engines much below 0.9 had grunt, but didn't inspire very much (think

I'm not so tall but men in my family are--up to 6'5".  They fit much 
better in the 930 than the 928. I think it depends where your height 
is.  If it is from the waist up, you won't fit so well in the 928.  
There is a very tall guy from the CVR of PCA who removed the seat 
rails from his 911 and had the seat permanently bolted to the 
floor--he has plenty of headroom.  Another tall guy at Drivers ed 
had special permission to leave his sunroof open--the only way he 
fit in his 944.

Good luck.

Subject: fogged gages, oxygenated fuels, universities...

I decided to be as brief as possible, so here it goes. All this is 
personal opinions. They are not necessarily the opinion of the St. Louis
region PCA (I'm president), or of Washington University in St. Louis,
where I teach and I'm the director of the internal combustion engines lab.

To Minh on fogged up 911 gages:  
- ------------------------------- 
Turn the interior heaters on high, and keep them going for a while after
moisture does not show; the energy (it is incorrect to say heat here) will
evaporate the moisture. Moisture may come from outside air, and many other
places, and condense on the aluminum cans of gages. If the cans have
hairline cracks, moisture leaks in.... 

On alternative fuels, oxygenated fuels, and electric cars: 
- ----------------------------------------------------------

At Washington University students have converted a Corsica to run on M85
(85% methanol, burns without visible flame and  15% other combustibles
that burn with visible flame). A local automotive company provided
us with some research-stage  fuel-system parts, but they couldn't make
them last more than 10,000 miles (ours last even less). Methanol- and
ethanol-fueled engines can be tweeked to burn with less CO and NOx, but
they produce formaldehydes, a carcinogen that's not regulated, but will do
the usual other damage. (Some will argue that ethanol doesn't produce
formaldehydes, but they are in the same category with cigarette
manufacturers claiming that cigarette smoking does not cause lung
cancer). Methanol and ethanol also have severe cold-starting problems. Our
students have also converted a GMC truck to run on compressed natural gas
(CNG). CNG burns hotter than gasoline (petrol for those like me educated
in England), but with water injection that can be reduced. We are now
converting an Escort to run as a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), some time
on a small gasoline engine, some time on batteries.  But where does the
electricity come from? From the power plants, either  nuclear or
coal-burning or oil-burning; each has a pollution problem of its own. And
for the ultimate hydrogen-powered car? Well, how do you generate hydrogen?
Sometime as a byproduct of generating other chemicals in chemical plants
with emission problems of their own; sometimes by electrolysis, which
needs electric-power input, and we are back to the electric power plant
emissions.....

Wind energy, tidal energy and solar ``energy'' are some of the
technologies promising MECHANICAL WORK or its rate MECHANICAL POWER at
significantly reduced emissions, albeit at some cost.  

My general comment is that although we do these ``alternative energy''
projects as part of student education, they are the car-manufacturer's and
the government's gimmicks to lull people into thinking we are doing
something about pollution or the ability to convert the huge amounts of
energy lying around (E=m*c**2) to mechanical work. (We do not have an
energy crisis; we have a crisis of converting energy to mechanical work
inexpensively). The media cover these ``alternative-energy-vehicle
competitions'' among the various universities free of charge to GM, FORD
and Chrysler. They get the publicity at the cost of 20 or so Corsicas,
Escorts etc donated to universities. An equivalent amount of advertising
at prime time would cost order of magnitude more than the cost of donated
cars to the car manufacturers. The universities do it for education
purposes for the students (and also for publicity).

On oxygenated fuels at the fuel pump: 
- ------------------------------------
If M85 does the above mentioned damage to the fuel-supply system (and it
also introduces additional lubrication/wear problems), then reduced
amounts of methanol or ethanol in the fuel we buy at the pumps  introduce
some reduced form of the same problems to our cars, including our
Porsches. (I will admit that the relation between reductions in percent
oxygenated fuel and reductions in percent of related engine problems is
not necessarily linear). But why chance it, especially on your P-car, 
anyway? The laws can vary from state to state, but it is my understanding
that it must be stated at the pump if the fuel contains oxygenated fuel 
*OVER A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE*. Surprise! They can stick some there, below
the magic percentage, without telling you. So what do we do? I do not know
about everyone else, but I avoid oxygenated fuels. I will stop worrying
when Porsche says they have run a stock 911 engine on oxygenated fuels for
over 500,000 miles!

To Ziegler@merk.com, on automotive engineering at US universities:
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to become an automotive engineer one can study mechanical
engineering (traditional), or electrical engineering  (CIS, radar, etc).
Unfortunately the four-year  mechanical engineering curricula are loaded
to the hilt with required courses in various subjects. These do not
include automotive engineering, but they do include thermodynamics and
sometimes(!!!) energy conversion. The students are left with very few
engineering-course electives. Part of the problem is the humanities
requirement, covering what in Europe is covered in high school or
pre-university colleges. Electrical engineering has a little more room for
other engineering electives, but not much. Thus the chances of doing
automotive engineering as an undergraduate are few. Maybe by going to one
of the schools participating in the alternative-energy vehicle
competitions there is a better chance (see above). But I can tell you from
personal experience that juniors (3rd year) need a little more knowledge
to contribute significantly to the projects. Seniors (4th year) have a
better chance.

Subject: Re: Helmets

As someone recently said: even if you *DO* have a $10 head, get a 
good helmet...

Best bet is a Snell SA-90 rated hat, since that should be good for
about 20 years in autox, rally, and drivers ed type events, and is also
good for about 10 years in road racing, for most of the major
sanctioning bodies. "SA" is for "Special Applications" i.e. road
racing; "M" is for "Motorcycle". They are *VERY* different. While
most autox and drivers ed bodies accept M helmets, using an SA
is just a smarter idea.

If you are going road racing, I *swear* by the fully "blown" helmets
with air plumbing and a separate fan system. Once you've used one, you
won't go back to the regular kind. It's expensive, with $400 or so in the
fan system and another $400 or so in the hat. But it's the best.

If you're never going to road race and never going to drive an open
car (HINT: a Targa with the roof off is "open"...), an open face helmet 
is acceptible. You'll like the extra "freedom" it has, until something 
happens to make you wish the bottom of your face had been covered.

Most of the major brands are good -- Simpson, Bell, Stand-21, Arai,
etc. Prices vary all over the place from about $120 for an open face
Bell to over $1k for a F-1 Kevlar Arai hat. And they all don't fit the
same either -- I have an Arai shaped head, *can* wear a Simpson with
only some discomfort, *CAN NOT* wear a Bell. Other people just
rattle around in the Arai but really groove on the Bell. You just
need to try enough different kinds on to see what you like best.

Oh -- where to buy? There are a zillion discounters and mail order places.
You can find them in SportsCar (the SCCA equivalent of Pano), and
places like Circle Track, Open Wheel, etc. I personally use sveral different
places for this type of stuff - HALO/Bell Motorsports in Oakland, Pegasus
Racing somewhere in the 414 area code, and Racers Wholesale. 

BTW, don't laugh at the idea of using the "roundie round" suppliers for 
your racing gear! Those guys have been doing more with less money for 
a LONG time and their suppliers *KNOW IT*. The dirt tracks just bring
out the cheap in everyone, I guess...

Good luck!

Smokers Rites

I think the war between the smokers and non-smokers is heating up a bit. I
went into a restaurant for lunch the other day and, as is my practice,
requested a table in the "no smoking" section. They seated me, and I went
about the business of ordering and eating my food.

Somewhere between the clam chowder and a club sandwich, I caught the smell of
nearby burning tobacco. Upon looking around, I noticed the man in the booth
next to me smoking a freshly lit cigarette.

Overcoming my natural reticence regarding confrontation, I spoke to the man.
"Excuse me, sir, but, when you came in, did you ask to be seated in the
no-smoking section?"

"Yes, I don't like the smell of smoke when I am eating any more than anyone
else."

I asked, "Then why are you smoking that cigarette?"

"I've finished eating."

Silly me, it was obvious to the most casual observer.

I called the server over and made her aware of the situation. She pointed out
to the man that he was smoking in a No Smoking section (I suspect this was
not a startling revelation) and went away with his assurance that he was just
leaving.

Of course he didn't leave until he had finished that cigarette and lit
another. But at least he did finally go.

Apparently he had noticed the motorcycle helmet and jacket I was wearing when
I came in, because in a minute or so, I noticed him eyeing the Harley parked
by the front door. He took out a small notebook, wrote something on a leaf
from it, tore off the note, and placed it between the seat and gas tank.

His next action took me completely off guard. He looked straight in the
window at me, then put his foot against the gas tank and shoved the
motorcycle over on its side. He then spun around and ran smack into a very
large, bearded fellow who apparently owned the Harley.

That which ensued netted him at least one broken bone and hopefully a little
jail time. After the police had come and gone, I helped the bearded gentleman
right his bike, and noticed the note the man had left. I unfolded it and
read: "This will teach you to mess with smoker's rights."

I laughed and handed the note to the cigar-chewing biker. I then went around
to the other side of the building, got on my BMW, and went back to work.

Subject: Re: Helmets

In response to Richard Hocking's question about helmets for drivers ed
events:

The Snell Foundation rates helmets according to two standards: "M" for
motorcycle helmets, and "SA" for automotive sport helmets. Every few years
the standards are updated (generally made tougher to pass, which is better
for the wearer!).

The most recent standards are Snell 85 and Snell 90. You may well expect that
there will be a revision of the standard next year (i.e. Snell 95). A helmet
gets a rating sticker at the factory when made; a helmet does not get
re-tested later in life to see if it still passes because the tests are tests
of the design, not the individual helmet. Testing a helmet destroys it
forever. (NEVER even think about using a helmet which has been damaged).

Each organization sponsoring events will have their own standard, so you
should check, but commonly drivers ed events accept the either of the last
two Snell ratings. Although I don't know of anyone who requires the SA
standard over the M standard, if you are buying a new helmet it is probably
worthwhile to find one with the SA rating. I'm not too sure of the
differences, but I believe the M helmets are tested more for sharp object
puntures and abrasion resistance (motorcycle types of trauma) and the SA
helmets are tested for some level of flame resistance. Motorcycle shops
naturally carry the M type exclusively, but can probably order the SA helmets
once you know your size.

Helmets can be permanently damaged and lose their impact absorbing qualities
by being dropped hard, used in a collision, or even painted with the wrong
type of paint. Be wary of used helmets, as the damage may not be visible.

At the risk of being preachy, buy a good helmet and take care of it; it is
truly a critical piece of safety equipment, although we all hope never to
need ours!

See you at the track!!

Brian,
	I just pulled the steering wheel in my 914 to get to the 
instruments. I did NOT need a wheel puller. All you need to do is take a 
hammer and a block of wood(rubber mallet works GREAT) and *gently* tap on 
the wheel from behind(wood is used to protect wheel from blows). 
Alternate from side to side and very soon it should be broken loose 
enough that you can just pull it off by hand. The only trick is that you 
need to turn the center hub(horn button) 1/4  turn counterclockwise. This 
will expose the nut that holds the wheel on. Oh, one other thing make 
sure that you have the front wheels aimed straight ahead before you 
start(makes realigning the sttering wheel easier). I have the 
four spoke wheel by the way.

Hope it helps

Subject: Re: Pulling 914 steering wheels.

Yesterday, I asked the members of the list how to pull a 914 steering
wheel.  The response was very pleasantly surprising.  I wanted to post
a summary of the answers, as well as thank everyone who responded.  Maybe
now I can get my beastie back on the road.

How to pull a 914 steering wheel:

 - Make sure that the front wheels are pointed straight.  This will
   help align the wheel when putting it back on.  Also, make a mark on
   both the wheel and steering column with a grease pencil, as a second
   alignment.

 - Remove the horn button.  Rotate the horn button about 1/8 to 1/4 turn
   counterclockwise.  It will lift off.  Unplug the wire for the horn.

 - Remove the lock nut.  It is a 27 mm nut, and is recessed, so a socket 
   wrench would be a good idea.

 - Remove the wheel.  It might just come right off, or, if it is stuck,
   put a piece of soft wood on the back of the wheel, and tap the wood
   with a rubber mallet, alternating between both sides of the wheel.
   It should come right off.

  Dave Darling and Andrew Toth requested the vendor and part number for
the electronic voltage regulator.  I will share that with all here.  Enjoy.

  Vendor:  Echlin or Standard
  Part #:  VR-503    SB (standard suffix)

  I just got off the phone with our local NAPA Auto Parts guy, and they 
had 'em on the shelf and the price was $20.99 each.  That's CHEAP!
Any store who carries the "Standard" product line should have them or
be able to get them.

 Personal Testimony:
  My '73 has been using one for around ten years with very good results.
No more boiling battery, and at nite the oncoming traffic doesnt blip
me with brites thinking my brites are on when they arent.  Also, when
at idle, the lights no longer dim or oscillate (undulate?). 
I am still using my original alternator with only bearings replaced once.
Total mileage on alternator: 130000 +-10%.
  In my experience, this item alone will extend the life of your 
car's electrical system, and the accessories in your car will be exposed
to less stress.

Subject: 944 hi-compression pistons


     Someone was looking for a source of hi-compression pistons for 
    a 944, Paeco (205-823-7278) can get them for you in 9:1, 10:1,
    or 11:1 sizes for about $100 a piston. Before you pull out your 
    mastercard;
      1. These are not OEM or Mahles, they are made somewhere domestically
         by someone who makes pistons custom order for any car (from Ferraris
         to Austins).  They may be great quality...but then again, they may
         just be hi-compression pistons for a little while.
      2. The effects of a compression change alone may not be worth it.
         According to dyno-numbers done by David Vizard (Chevy tuner and
         well published "How to Modify" Chevy blocks, intakes, cams, etc, 
         a change from 8.5:1 to 10.5:1 with a 250' duration cam only yields
         about a 5% change in horsepower. A compression change is 
         needed is when you change cam duration-- a longer duration cam will
         tend to give you lower "dynamic compression" because of overlap,
         and the piston change makes up for it. 
          Unless you change your cam profile, just a bump in compression isn't
         worth it. Paeco also offers cam regrinds, about $150 a cam, but again
         I don't have any feel for the quality of the work, and you could
         find your reground cam has round lobes 6 months from now.
       3.  You could consider milling the head itself, You will probably gain
         about 3/4 point of compression by milling 30 thousandths. However,
         this will also change the crank/cam timing, advancing your cam, 
         which will put your torque peak lower--probably not something you
         want. The exact amount of timing change would be figured by counting
         the number of teeth on your cam pulley, measuring the pitch of the
         cogs on the belt, and probably using an integral or something....
         
         If you are just curious and have to do it, do all of it. If you want
        a car that runs hotter 20,000 miles from now, build to stock or find
        a completely OEM solution/tune....

(Put on your flame suit, Harry, 'cause here it comes!)
 
Reply to Harry Pellow:
 
Exploding fans aren't rare for people who deal with high performance 356 and
912 engines. Everyone I talk to in this business is aware of them, so much
so that I had heard the stories and recognized the probem immediately, at
night, without a flashlight.
 
Improper shimming or insufficient torque has nothing to do with this case.
The impeller back plate was still firmly bolted to the generator. The curved
involute sheet metal had not been rubbing on the fan housing.
 
The factory manual says to use soft vise jaw inserts, clamp the generator
pulley hub in a vise, and tighten to 10 mkp (98 Nm, call it 100, or 72
ft.-lbs.). This is not a great deal of torque. Given a choice between the
factory manual, which has a usable table of contents, and three volumes of
unedited stories which include musings on the thickness of human pubic
hairs, nuclear reactor fairy tales, and gross misapplications of least-
squares curve fitting, I'll take the factory book. I don't have time or
patience to wade through the other.
 
Still, I must thank you for your books. I race and slalom my car. As long as
the competition follows your books, there's nothing to keep my car from
finishing first every time out.
 
Anybody who uses an air impact wrench for precise tightening jobs doesn't
get any closer to my cars than the lugnuts.
 
The fan may drive at almost twice crankshaft speed (actually about 1.8x) but
that's just a number; the factory designed these things to go to the redline
of the 6000 rpm, and stay there at autobahn speeds, on a regular basis. Thirty
years of fatigue will take their toll, and you have to accept the
fact that parts will break. I put a new fan in and I expect the same thing
will happen sometime in the future -- if I'm lucky, in 30 years or 200,000
miles, as this (original) engine has on it now. If one builds low-end
"Normal" and "Damen" motors that run out of beans at 4500 and redline at
5500, that may well explain why one may never see a fan failure.

Keeping the 356 faith, original and without gold plating,

To continue the thread on sport seats...

An observation from the 1993 Cincinnati Porsche Parade. Those spouses which
arrived in cars equipped with sport seats had a posture like a preying mantis
from trying to read maps, etc while seated.

Sport seats are great for the driver, whose hands are on the steering wheel,
but they may be less comfortable for a passenger, especially on long trips.

Also, some sport seats I have seen have significant wear on the outboard
bolster, from drivers putting all their weight on the bolster as they slide
in . Be careful to check the stitching on any seats you buy.

What I meant was:

The 993 in its present form was only supposed to last 2 years.

The follow-on 996 is rumored to be water-cooled, 4-valve, V6,
rear-engined.

Thus the 993 would be the "last air-cooled Porsche," since the
986 (Boxster) is also rumored to be a water-hauler (2.5L flat six).

The "911 Carrera" name lives on in the 964, 993, and will probably
live on in the 996.

The AWD version of the 993 should be in showrooms by the end of
the year.

The twin-turbo engine for the AWD 993 chassis has been "spied"
undergoing road tests and is currently a 1997 model due to debut
in 1996 (June?).  It has even bigger rear fenders and a fixed tail.
(real Porsches don't tuck their tails). I don't know the
in-house design number of that project.

IMHO:

Given this latest intelligence,  it is probable that the 993 with
the air-cooled six will be around longer than 2 years, as was 
announced earlier.

The "911 Carrera" name, shape, and rear-engine layout will be
around past the year 2000, and will outlive both the 968 and
928.  By model year '97, I'd say you'll have a choice between a 
Carrera, Carrera Turbo, or a 986.  And I hope they lose the
"Boxster" name.

Subject: fogged gages, oxygenated fuels, universities...

I decided to be as brief as possible, so here it goes. All this is 
personal opinions. They are not necessarily the opinion of the St. Louis
region PCA (I'm president), or of Washington University in St. Louis,
where I teach and I'm the director of the internal combustion engines lab.

To Minh on fogged up 911 gages:  
- ------------------------------- 
Turn the interior heaters on high, and keep them going for a while after
moisture does not show; the energy (it is incorrect to say heat here) will
evaporate the moisture. Moisture may come from outside air, and many other
places, and condense on the aluminum cans of gages. If the cans have
hairline cracks, moisture leaks in.... 

On alternative fuels, oxygenated fuels, and electric cars: 
- ----------------------------------------------------------

At Washington University students have converted a Corsica to run on M85
(85% methanol, burns without visible flame and  15% other combustibles
that burn with visible flame). A local automotive company provided
us with some research-stage  fuel-system parts, but they couldn't make
them last more than 10,000 miles (ours last even less). Methanol- and
ethanol-fueled engines can be tweeked to burn with less CO and NOx, but
they produce formaldehydes, a carcinogen that's not regulated, but will do
the usual other damage. (Some will argue that ethanol doesn't produce
formaldehydes, but they are in the same category with cigarette
manufacturers claiming that cigarette smoking does not cause lung
cancer). Methanol and ethanol also have severe cold-starting problems. Our
students have also converted a GMC truck to run on compressed natural gas
(CNG). CNG burns hotter than gasoline (petrol for those like me educated
in England), but with water injection that can be reduced. We are now
converting an Escort to run as a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), some time
on a small gasoline engine, some time on batteries.  But where does the
electricity come from? From the power plants, either  nuclear or
coal-burning or oil-burning; each has a pollution problem of its own. And
for the ultimate hydrogen-powered car? Well, how do you generate hydrogen?
Sometime as a byproduct of generating other chemicals in chemical plants
with emission problems of their own; sometimes by electrolysis, which
needs electric-power input, and we are back to the electric power plant
emissions.....

Wind energy, tidal energy and solar ``energy'' are some of the
technologies promising MECHANICAL WORK or its rate MECHANICAL POWER at
significantly reduced emissions, albeit at some cost.  

My general comment is that although we do these ``alternative energy''
projects as part of student education, they are the car-manufacturer's and
the government's gimmicks to lull people into thinking we are doing
something about pollution or the ability to convert the huge amounts of
energy lying around (E=m*c**2) to mechanical work. (We do not have an
energy crisis; we have a crisis of converting energy to mechanical work
inexpensively). The media cover these ``alternative-energy-vehicle
competitions'' among the various universities free of charge to GM, FORD
and Chrysler. They get the publicity at the cost of 20 or so Corsicas,
Escorts etc donated to universities. An equivalent amount of advertising
at prime time would cost order of magnitude more than the cost of donated
cars to the car manufacturers. The universities do it for education
purposes for the students (and also for publicity).

On oxygenated fuels at the fuel pump: 
- ------------------------------------
If M85 does the above mentioned damage to the fuel-supply system (and it
also introduces additional lubrication/wear problems), then reduced
amounts of methanol or ethanol in the fuel we buy at the pumps  introduce
some reduced form of the same problems to our cars, including our
Porsches. (I will admit that the relation between reductions in percent
oxygenated fuel and reductions in percent of related engine problems is
not necessarily linear). But why chance it, especially on your P-car, 
anyway? The laws can vary from state to state, but it is my understanding
that it must be stated at the pump if the fuel contains oxygenated fuel 
*OVER A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE*. Surprise! They can stick some there, below
the magic percentage, without telling you. So what do we do? I do not know
about everyone else, but I avoid oxygenated fuels. I will stop worrying
when Porsche says they have run a stock 911 engine on oxygenated fuels for
over 500,000 miles!

To Ziegler@merk.com, on automotive engineering at US universities:
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to become an automotive engineer one can study mechanical
engineering (traditional), or electrical engineering  (CIS, radar, etc).
Unfortunately the four-year  mechanical engineering curricula are loaded
to the hilt with required courses in various subjects. These do not
include automotive engineering, but they do include thermodynamics and
sometimes(!!!) energy conversion. The students are left with very few
engineering-course electives. Part of the problem is the humanities
requirement, covering what in Europe is covered in high school or
pre-university colleges. Electrical engineering has a little more room for
other engineering electives, but not much. Thus the chances of doing
automotive engineering as an undergraduate are few. Maybe by going to one
of the schools participating in the alternative-energy vehicle
competitions there is a better chance (see above). But I can tell you from
personal experience that juniors (3rd year) need a little more knowledge
to contribute significantly to the projects. Seniors (4th year) have a
better chance.

I strongly suggest against doing this!  Not all helmet sizes are consistent,
even within manufacturers.  A motorcycle helmet and a racing helmet will NOT
fit the same.  When you are about to purchase a helmet, you must make sure of 
a proper fit.  If the helmet doesn't fit properly, all you really have is a 
fancy hat.  The best thing to do is try on the actual model and size of helmet 
you wish to purchase.  Also keep in mind that with time, the foam padding 
inside the helmet will compress, so it is advisable to periodically
replace the helmet.  When it feels loose, get rid of it...but destroy it
first.  Bruce, I'm really not flaming you.  Please don't misunderstand my 
intentions, but as one of the few helmet-wearing motorcyclists in the state of 
Connecticut, and as a motorcycle safety instructor, this is a subject that
is near and dear to my brain.  Good luck in your search.

Trond,

If your 356 seat hinges are like the hinges on my '67 912, the answer
is yes, you need to be a blacksmith--or at least a good machinist.
Parts like the gear that keeps the seat from falling backwards are
pressed onto the body of the hinge.  I wanted to replace that gear
because my passenger seat has a tendency to fall backwards if too much
weight is put on them or if I accelerate too fast, but I couldn't find
a way to remove it without really messing up the rest of the hinge.

Has anyone else found a way to fix older seats that don't want to stay
upright?

Subject: Re: SPRING PLATE BUSHING REPLACEMENT 


Mike,

Sorry for being so tardy in my reply to you.  It's been a few years
since I replaced the bushings on my '67 912 so I wanted to refresh my
memory by taking a look at my manuals first--well, I finally
remembered to do that!  Again, sorry for taking so long--you've
probably already finished the job!  

There are two bushings on each side of the car for the rear torsion
bars.  The inner and the outer bushings.  My Porsche parts manual for
'65 to '68 911s shows that the outer bushing is separate from the
radius arm hub cover, but like you and some others have mentioned, the
outer bushings on my '67 912 were not.  I ended up just replacing the
inner bushings and keeping the old outer bushings--they didn't look
all that bad, and I didn't have much choice.  Someone's suggestion
that you turn the plate/outer-bushing assembly up-side-down and use it
on the other side of the car sounds like a great idea!

The project took a little bit of ingenuity to do without the
recommended factory tools, but all-in-all it wasn't too difficult.
Here are a few tips based on my experience.

 -Like I said before, don't use Weltmeister bushings!!!--your car will
squeak very loudly forever more, sometimes you will swear that it
sounds like the metal in your rear end is shearing apart, and you
will hate it! (or install grease fittings on the cover like another
p'files contributor wrote.  sounds like a good idea if you aren't
concerned about original appearance.)

 -The shop manual says to use a special tool to support the radius arm
while you remove the cover.  I don't have such a tool, but I found
that I could do the job just fine with a bottle jack and some care.

 -When reassembling everything, you need to put the radius arm back
onto the torsion bar at just the right angle.  The shop manuals talk
about measuring that angle when the car is parallel to the ground.  I
don't have a car lift, just floor jacks, so I used an inclinometer
(they're pretty cheap at Sears) to measure the angle of my garage
floor and the angle of my car body to the floor.  With a little bit
of arithmetic I then figured out the inclinometer reading to use for
setting the angle of the radius arm.


Hope this helps!

Do 914's have the same two manufacturer's of alternators as 911's?
If they do, you may have a problem with some cars.

On early 911's there are two different alternator manufacturers, Motorola
and Bosch.  They have different output diode arrangements, with
Motorola using 8 diodes and Bosch 9.

The Bosch has three diodes connected to the - (ground) terminal, 
three diodes connected to the + terminal, and three additional diodes
connected to give an isolated voltage voltage regulator sense voltage
approximately equal to the + terminal voltage.

The three Bosch isolation diodes are attached to the field windings
at the same point as the + terminal diodes, but do not parallel the
+ output diodes to preserve isolation.

The Motorola alternator has three diodes connected to the - terminal and
the field windings, three diodes connected to the field windings to 
form an intermediate + output that connects to the voltage regulator 
sense point.

In the Motorola two more paralleled diodes follow in series and yield
the + output terminal.

In both cases, the design prevents battery discarge through the voltage
regulator when the car is not running and the ignition is off.

To make the system work the Motorola voltage regulator expects a sense 
voltage of Vbattery + one diode drop = Vbattery + 0.7 volts.  

The Bosch voltage regulator expects a sense voltage of Vbattery.

So you can't use a Bosch regulator with a Motorola Alternator or vice-versa.

BTW, what output diode configuration is the VR-503 designed to work with?
It may directly work with ONE manufacturer of the 911's alternators also.

I checked my sources.  In Hot VWs, Gene Berg (Bug engine Guru) advertises
a meter/"oxygen sensor" for $195.  Difficult to read from the picture, but
looks like "BZ something-or-other" is the name of the company.  I saw the
Haltech meter/"oxygen sensor" in European Car -- no price listed.  These 
may indeed not be true lambda sensors.  It fits, since the meters have
a rather simple LED scale on them showing whether mixture is centered...

I don't know if it is the same sender, but Honda did use such a beast in
F1, and there are currently thousands of them driving around as we speak
in their lean-burn engined Civic Vx.  These hit the streets in the '92 or
'93 model year.  The engine has variable valve timing using the VTEC 
system similar to that found in the NSX.  They run somewhere over 20:1
using this fancy sensor and lots of swirl during cruising RPMs.  At higher
RPM, the valve timing/lift changes for acceleration.

This combination yields a 90 HP engine that gets over 50 MPG on the highway.
Not quite a sporty car, but it beats the h___ out of the Geo Metro 3 cylinder
wimp-mobile -- the only car that beats the Civic Vx in MPG rating (by about
3 MPG).

I've got a problem with my speedometer in my '85 911 and would appreciate
any advice. In the morning, the speedo will not register anything until
I hit about 40 mph. Granted, that doesn't take us long right :-)?
After it has "woken up" it works fine, registering correctly down to
0 mph. It's not a serious problem, but it will probably get worse instead
of better. Do I have a cable problem? Speedo need overhaul?

Speaking of instruments, I've seen a few references to oil temperature
gauges on the list. Does everyone know that the "unmarked" oil temperature
gauges DO have temperatures marked on them? To see them you need to have
the eyes of an eagle, and the neck of a stork, as you have to look 
through the steering wheel at the outermost edge of the temperature
gauge. You'll see that each tic mark has a tiny calibration mark in degrees C.
This applies to my '85 911. I can't speak for other models or years, but
it may be worth a peek on your car.

One last question. I don't have an air compressor, but could really use
some sort of impact wrench. Are there any good electric ones on the market?
Or, would I spend so much on a good one that I'd be better off spending the
same amount on a compressor and air impact wrench?

   Since the body and general equipment are in great condition, I 
will consider fitting a spare super90 motor that I have and use it as

Subject: 16" tires on stock '77 911s

I've been researching this tire thing.  Apparently the 16" wheels are just
too big for the rear, ideally on a stock '77 911S.  However, I like my BBS
RS wheels a lot (especially after seeing how outrageous they are to buy!),
so I may try sticking with the 16" wheels. 

Has anyone ever tried putting 16"*7 wheels in the front of a '77 911s,
with any tire successfully?

As far as keeping the 16*7s on the rear, I've considered replacing my worn
rubbing 205/50*16s with either:

a) Pirelli P700Zs in 205/45 which yields 3.63" height

b) Dunlop SP 8000 225/40 which yields 3.54" height

c) Yoko. AVS Interm. 195/50 3.84" but 10mm thinner (BTW, these cost $132
each at Tire Rack, but only $119 at Teletire.  Has anyone had experience,
good or bad with Teletire?)

I'm getting these prices from Mar. Car & Driver ads.  I saw at the
newstand that the Feb. Car & Driver Tire Rack had a "special" for a 205/40
tire I believe, this might be ideal for me, as it would yield a 3.22" height.

Tire Rack also has a Falken 145/50*16, but this is much too narrow, and
low.  My Fiat 128 used to have 145 tires!

It seems that only one side rubs (driver side, even with 2 people in car),
but when sway bar is installed, it pulls whole car down, so both rub when
hitting bump or cornering hard (currently sway bar is off).

I'm leaning towards the Yoko. AVS 195/50 option, and if that doesn't cure
it, I might have to consider raising the rear end with stiffer shocks or
something.

944s provide an interesting problem for us short guys (well, I'm 5'7", but

my feet can reach the pedals, I gotta put my head up-against the windshield.

944/928 engines have an engine block of a special silicon/aluminum alloy.   
When the bores are properly honed, the aluminum is etched away, leaving  
just the silicon as an extremely-hard cylinder wall surface.  I've seen  
944 engines with 90k miles with no measurable ridge in the bore.

This special material requires iron-plated pistons.  As far as I know, no  
domestic piston manufacturer has the capability to make these pistons;  
only KS and Mahle in Germany.  If they aren't iron-plated, don't use them.   
Pre-88 Euro 944 pistons have a compression ratio of 10.6:1 versus 9.6 or  
9.7:1 for pre-88 US pistons.  They aren't dished in the center like the US  
pistons.

944 engines respond very well to an increase in compression.  Your numbers  
are for Chevy engines, and are not general.  The theoretical increase  
possible going from 8.5 to 10.5 is about 8%.  From 9.6 to 11.6 (more  
realistic for a 944) the potential increase is about 6%.  944 engines  
actually gain about 5% more power from this change alone (about 7-8 hp).   
Why isn't this worth it?

Jon Milledge Engineering (617 834-3932) has many cam profiles he's  
developed on the dyno for 911/928/944 engines.  His mild  
normally-aspirated 944 cam gains 20 real hp with no other modifications.   
His "Club Sport" cam gives you 50 more hp with other head work.

Milling the head is a good way to get compression increase, but the only  
way to really determine the amount is to cc the combustion chamber before  
and after, because as you start removing material, the combustion chamber  
changes shape and becomes flat in certain areas.

Cutting the head actually _retards_ the timing, because of the geometry of  
the cam belt.  The retardation associated with mild cuts of .020 - .030  
doesn't seem to hurt power.

If you want expert information and parts for performing these  
modifications, I suggest calling Jon Milledge at 617 834-3932.  I am  
biased, because I'm his friend and satisfied customer, but he is the only  
944 tuner I've talked with whose claims are backed by solid theoretical  
knowledge and lots of racing experience, as well as dyno sheets.

We got ours at the local Honda MC dealer.  Don't remember the brand and they
are packed away till the snow goes but there were 2 models, one with a built
in FM radio and one without.  If I remember correctly, the cost was 45 and
53.  They run of AAA batteries and the cords are more than long enough.  Be
sure to get the corded models btw. A few folks didn't and it didn't take
them real long to realize the gains by not having wires strung all over were
far overshadowed by the fact the cars were talking to each other as well as
their students :->
  We are looking into the cost of spare mike/receiver pieces.  Many of the
students are interested in leaving them in their helmets - much easier.
  One other point, the motorcycle units are designed for helmets and tend to
work better than other types.  The headset is set up to be kept in place by
the helmet, as opposed to a bracket over the head.  Much more comfortable.

My co-worker Scott VanHaren is about my height, 5'2" or so, and has a '71
or '72 911, which he rebuilt himself to a 2.4.  He did something
to raise the seat in it a little.

Incidentally, he is selling it to finance a Harley and/or fix his 1935
truck.  I think he
wants about 8K for it, it's in great condition.  Don't have his # handy,

Steve,


I got the figures from the toyota factory service manual.  I looked a couple
of hours for this info so I remember those figures are correct for toy rotors.
Didn't think they would vary THAT much.  It sorta make sense since you have a
five bolt assembly and I have a four.

Subject: Seats / 993 on UK TV / Upfixin' / New Club


1.	Many thanks to all those who replied to my queries about trim and
seats. I currently have electric sports seats in my 944 and (as someone
pointed out) the outboard bolsters have worn badly. Having shopped around
I found a (non-car specialist) upholster (a member of the Guild of Master
Upholsterers) who will be fixing it next weekend.

	Am I alone in finding electric adjustment to be a waste of time?
Nobody else ever drives my car, so I just set up the seat when I bought
the car and haven't touched it since. My passengers enjoy playing with
their's though :-)

2.	For porschephiles with access to UK TV, _Carnography_ will be
featuring the 993 next week (Channel 4, Tuesday, 15 March, 1994, 21:00). I
only caught the end of last week's programme (the first in the series),
but it seemed a bit anti-car (which is strange for a car programme!)

3.	Lest anyone does not know, Upfixin' der Porsche, Volume 9 is now
available from PCA. I haven't seen any mention of it on this list (and
only found out when a PCA member brough the latest Pano along to our last
PCGB meeting).

4. There is a new club in the UK, devoted to the 924 and 944. I believe it
was formed by people who felt that PCGB is too 911 oriented. Membership is
22.50 pounds per year (plus 5 pounds joining fee), and you get a badge,
sticker and regular magazine. E-mail me if you want the address /

Subject: Helmets

Andrew Toth didn't like my suggestion about sizing helmets using the "M"
motorcycle versions then ordering the "SA" ones.  In theory I agree; I don't
buy shoes mail order either unless I know the manufacturer and trust the
sizing is consistent.  But some of us just don't have full shopping
alternatives nearby. The "best" thing would be if I had shop within 75 miles
that stocked all the brands and all the sizes I should look through
(figuratively and literally); but alas I don't.  So I'm trying to narrow the
field a bit and the only local stock I have access to (as far as I know) is
in the bike shops.  I understand that some of the mail-order houses will
shuffle helmets back and forth until you have the one that fits - seems an
awkward process without some preliminary guidance!  So, Andrew I AM trying to
get a helmet that fits properly, if the size xyz "M" fits but the size xyz
"SA" doesn't, I should have an idea which direction to go, size-wise, with
the next iteration.

Lou Krieg says that the wrong PAINT can permanently damage a helmet! Sounds
extreme!?  But, then again I remember OFF insect repellent can dissolve some
plastics so might this be the point?

Subject: 4 cylinder eng. sullying 911 body

Peter, you're a brave man to mention such a project in this crowd.  I went the
other way (911T engine into VW Vanagon).  I would think that the tricky parts
would be the same for you as for me: flywheel, and engine supports.  You have
the additional advantage of being able to use 912 parts if you can find them.
Kennedy Engineered Products (no relation) seems to offer any flywheel combo
you can imagine; they solved the flywheel problem for me.  And I cobbled up
an engine support that works fine except I need a mirror to set the dist.
timing.

Shrouding, and what to do with the oil tank while it's not busy, are left as an
exercise for the reader.

If you pictured this as a permanent change, you'd probably want to reset the
ride height in back to account for the lighter engine.

Good luck, and be careful whom you tell what you're doing.  A purist's head
could explode.

Hey,

All this talk of helmets lately reminded me of something.
Does anyone know of a good source to buy Snell SA90
rated helmets inexpensively?  I borrowed a friend's Bell
Sport II (full face) for a driver's school last fall and really
liked it.  Unfortunately, I can't buy a helmet with this rating
around here.  (Helmets are only worn in Alabama for
aesthetic reasons, so head protection is not important).

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

According to it, oxygenated fuels will be mandated for year-round use in
the smoggiest areas.  In my case, it means that every station in Southern
California will sell the stuff.  I'd hope that some more proactive
suggestion could be made, like campaigning against the mandate in

someone like Dr. Korakianitis would be most effective in such a

    Do your hazard lights work?  If so, your switch in the steering column may

    If not, it could be your "intermittent relay".  On my 914, it hides up

Michigan State

other comments:

Several people said that any school was ok as long as it had a 
strong affiliation with SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers)

The GM Institute program above was particularly interesting 
because it's a 5 year program where students alternate each 
semester between the classroom and work at one of the plants.

More than one person recommended that there might be more personal 
satisfaction in keeping automotive engineering as an avocation - 
buy a Porsche - participate in time trials and driving schools - 
reengineer his own car, etc.  I've had kind of a charmed career in 
scientific imaging, and I've always had jobs that I loved
(although not every day) but I can understand the point. It would

want to tinker with a car on weekends =:-<

Subject: 1971 911T Questions


       
     Hello all.  
      
     I am a most happy owner of a '71 9llT.  I have a few questions that  
     maybe some excellent people out there might give me a hand with.  
      
     1) When I bought my car about a year ago, the tach didn't work.  
     When the signal wire is connect to the guage, the motor dies and  
     cannot be started unless the tach is disconnected.  I have tried a  
     new (used) RPM sensor in the engine compartment with no difference.   
     I am assuming that the new (used) one COULD be bad but what are the  
     chances?  All I can figure is that the tach itself is smoked.  Any  
     other ideas?  If the guage is at fault, what can I expect it to  
     cost for repair?  
       
     2) It has also backfired since I bought it.  I took it in to  
     Porsche mechanic. (Not the dealer)  He did a rebuild on my Zenith  
     40-TIN carbs, adjusted the valves, and who knows what else.  The  
     backfire is greatly reduced and much quieter but still exists in 
     smaller quantities.  Ring any bells with anyone?  
       
     3) My transmission rumbles slightly when in neutral.  If I pull the
     stick back as far as possible without pressing the clutch and
     putting it into gear, it quiets down.  What transmission part(s)
     could be thinking nasty thoughts?
     
     4) I haven't seen any messages about swap meets. Are they still
     held?  Any in Texas?  With Stan being from Houston, It would be 
     nice to have one there.
     
          I am not yet a member of the PCA, but plan to join very
     shortly. (When I can remember to call at a decent time of day).
     I always look forward to FTP-ing the monthly list at the beginning
     of each month.  I copy it to my laptop and spend 2 days reading.
     Thanks to Stan and all who make this possible.

There is a good article on Driving helmets in the recent

brands and discusses them in detail.

I got in this thread late and it has been over a month since
I read that article, so I cannot be more specific but I will

Writing things down has no effect on their truth value.

Perhaps Pete prefers to spend his time doing instead of talking.

Regarding "stock" engines beating (and outliving) "prepared" engines,
is it too much of a blow for you to consider that the driver (not the 
mechanic) is the major contributer here?


To the rest of the list:

My appologies for the public post.  The ego wanking just was a little

Regardless of who builds better engines, Pete's certainly got better

Pheew...

I'm ba..ack,...just replaced the battery box in my '59,new frame struts
too.I'm still waiting for the lower toeboard repair panel, when this
one arrives I'm ready to install the floor,and a new K-member.

If I can find the lousy F*** that once restored my car I'll braze him
to death. I have never seen this much brass....

Changed from .6 to .8 welding wire,this was good,it's easier to
control the weld with the thicker wire.One needs lower feeding to
prevent builld up though.

I'm constructing my own chassi rotater that'll make it easier when I'm
finishing the underbody panels.I've mostly spot welded so far.

I'm going to braze or lead some areas in the front clip and the
fenders.These areas are not rusted through but have some small holes
and thin material.

Any experiences or ideas will be of great help,...cause I've never
done it before.......(brazing that is...:))

cheers

Subject: Helmets & Paint!

I've gotten a few direct messages back in response to my comment that
worrying about paint on a racing helmet seems "extreme" and I find them a
bit worrying.  A few of you have told me that any paint will damage these
helmets (especially if they are polycarbonate).  Trouble is no one has told
me what the paint actually DOES to the helmet.  Are these polycarbonate and
fiberglass structures so fragile?  It seems that a good bout of
California smog or midwest acid rain might cause them to mutate around
your ears.  Most of what I've read over the years is that "plastics" don't
decompose FAST enough.  Fiberglass car bodies seem to weather well
especially when painted.  I imagine helmets come with a paint, or
paint-like, sealer on them, so it strikes me (novice that I am) that
another coat over part or all seems rather benign.  If I'm wrong I'd like to
know WHY.  The structural integrity of various "plastics" is a crucial part
of more than my driving life!

It is true, but less true today than years ago.  The hard outer shell of
a quality modern helmet is reinforced using either fiberglass or kevlar.
Solvents mixed with the paint may cause delamination of the outer shell,
therefore reducing the structural integrity of the helmet.  Helmet specific
information is available from the manufacturer.  Caution should also be 
exercised when sanding prior to painting.

Subject: 911 Rear axle & CV play


Hi folks,

I'm in the process of renewing some of the rear end components on
my '77 Carrera.  Whilst replacing the rear brake rotors, I've
noticed:

1. Some circular play between the hub and the driveshaft.  

While holding the LR hub, I'm able to rotate the driveshaft
between 5 and 10 degrees (as an estimate). 

I didn't check the other side - I had to examine the severely
potholed wheel on my GTI (bummer) in the time alloted by my
wife...


2. Some lateral play in the driveshaft.  

Basically I can move the shaft about 1" along its long axis.  I
can easily understand the need for this play given normal
suspension movement.  The question is, is there a hard limit?

Any help would be appreciated - thanks.

Cheers,
Tim

Greetings Wet-Footed 914 Owners!

The 914 electric windshield washer kit upgrade saga continues...

I have received many requests for the kit...this is good for all of us.
It means I will be doing something to the benefit of many soggy feet,
and I'll probably be able to get quantity discounts on parts.  Your
interest is greatly appreciated!

A good number of people made comments about using quality components, which
is in line with my thoughts:  If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
For that reason, I'm looking into Bosch components.  This may drive the
price up a bit, but reliability is a benefit.  After all, we ARE driving
Porsches!  (No Porsche/VW flame wars necessary...we all know the heritage
of the 914.)

I will gather a list of all who have showed interest in the kit, and
e-mail them a confirmation by Monday, March 14.  If you missed the 
first call, here's another chance.

To all who have e-mailed suggestions and offered assistance, thank you!
I may be getting back to you, so change your e-mail address now before
I start looking for you!  Since my experience is in pre '75 cars, I'll
need info on any differences between pre and post '75 setups.  Also,
which 914s have the wipers activated by the washer?  That's missing
from my brain.

Please be patient.  I have people helping round-up parts, prices and
general info.  This will take a bit of time, but I'm not going to drop 
the ball on this.  Remember, I want this to be a GOOD kit.

Thanks again.  Many Porschephiles have shown support and interest,
and now it's time for me to get moving on this.  I'll be in touch.

Subject: Laser 

I'd like to start a discussion about this threat.

Some police do use laser, and there are now some laser detectors. The new
issue of Car&Driver reviews some of the offerings. My impressions of
the situation are:

	There is very little actual laser use by police.

	The laser beam is so narrow that by the time your detector picks it
	up, you already have the ticket, and for practical purposes this is
	as true for the very good detectors as for the so-so ones.

	Laser is evidentally more difficult for police to use than radar,
	because you have to aim it very precisely.

Comments, anyone?

Also, a few months ago C&D ran a report stating that if you leave your
lights on, this diminishes the ability of the laser to trap you. Does anyone
have thoughts on this, particularly with respect to our P-cars. (example:
you can't put on the fog lights if the regular lights are off, right? Do we
have to drive all day with lights on?)

A final subject for discussion:  It seems that some policepeople are getting
concerned that they are subjected to harmful radiation by using their radars.
This is GOOD, because it may cause radar use to decline.  Corollary, this is
BAD because it may make them want to use more non-dangerous laser.

I really don't know how the turbo injectors differ from the
non-turbo variety, if at all.  If, however, they had larger
orifices (orificii??), then without reprogramming the DME,
you are likely to run way too rich; no more power but a
lot greater consumption and fouled plugs.

I have 130K miles on my 84 944 and I would like to rebuild it
within the next year perhaps.  If I do rebuild it, I would put in
rest-of-world pistons.  A DME reprogram would probably be
needed (a ROW DME chip?).  The US spec pistons give 9.5:1
compression versus 10.6:1 for ROW.  HP difference is 150
versus 163 or nearly 10% for just the increased compression
ratio.  I haven't checked part numbers, but I suspect the ROW
DME has changes for both the increased compression and
lack of smog regulations.  Given my somewhat meager
high-performance experience, I believe that this is the most
power you could hope to get without increasing intake air
efficiency (through porting and polishing or turbocharging).
The headers are already quite efficient.

I do want to keep my car in the stock autox racing class, so I
need to find out if ROW pistons are still considered stock.

BTW, according to the spec book, US and ROW use the same
camshaft.  A hotter cam profile can increase power, but that
definitely would take me out of the stock class.

Another route to consider is aftermarket DME chips, although
there has been considerable doubt expressed here on the net
as to whether you could gain more than a couple of percentage
points in power, if that.

Regarding some recent net questions about the spec book: it
is a Porsche publication (one per car model type) and can be
gotten from a dealer for about $10.

Dont waste your money, The injectors are designed with the entire system
and computer program to work together.  951 injectors will not
be compatable, and likely will flow to much fuel resulting in
poor fuel economy, burned out catalyst, and lots of soot in the 
exaust system and on the Lambda sensor. (Don't the Porsche engineers
already give you a thrill ride anyway?)

Get a EPROM upgrade, fancy exhaust, or put in a 968 engine.

Well, what about a database of the Porschephiles own finest machines !!!!

I have some photos of my Guards Red 928GTS and you did say you liked the
water pumpers, so drop me a note if you would like me to send you any to
scan in.

No doubt you will get many similar offers from people like myself that can
view but not "scan in" nice piccies.

For good pictures you might also try Christophorus magazine, they always have
good high quality pictures even if it does come by surface mail now :-(

Subject: parking brake


Hi fellow porschephiles,

Before I let the dust settle on the questions regarding bad parking
brakes, I decided to add my own question (to stir things up a little).

My parking brake will not hold if the car is on an incline which will 
make it go backwards, but it will hold if it's on an incline that makes
it go forward (makes sense?)  What could be the problem?  This is quite
puzzling to me, but hey I don't know that much about the beast.  By the way,
it's an 85 1/2 944.

I would appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks, Sorin

Kevin,

My vote is for the .gif format.  As for water cooled Porsches,
it would be nice if you could get some images of the Boxster on line.
Especially the interior, its *very* consistent with the exterior.
At least the concept car anyway, who knows what will really be

As we're all talking about scanning and whatnot, let's keep something
else in mind: copyrights.

I can't keep you from scanning in stuff for your own amusement, but let's
try to keep it clean as far as what you upload, OK?? Scans of "original
works" -- such as photos you took, your friends took, other original
artwork, etc -- that's all fine; scans of "public domain works" are
also fine; reproductions of things that we're not sure where came
from but seem to be everywhere (i.e. archie finds 20,000 others out 
there) are a bit more touchy but probably still fine.

Scanning your Haynes manual is *NOT* OK. Scanning images from Pano/Excellence
etc is *NOT* OK unless you have written permission (or it falls within the
definition of fair use, which this doesn't).

If you can't do it for legal reasons, do it to be a good neighbor -- Dom
Miliano, who does *A LOT* of the photography for Excellence and who has
done a lot for Pano in the past, and whose work can be seen in all sort
of other car magazines (he doesn't *just* shoot Porsches...), is a fellow
PorschePhile. If you scan images of his work, and make them publicly
available, you're getting him right in the pocketbook.

So, be careful. If it's printed or published anywhere in the world since
about 1990, it's *automaticly* copyrighted. Before that, check for copyright
notice, but be aware that anything in print is probably copyrighted.
Particularly if it was originally something sold rather than given away.

Stan

P.S. This whole copyright issue is one of the things we'd like to work out
with the PCA. Some sort of arrangement where we could make available
works copyrighted by the PCA -- photos from the archives, articles
from Pano, Up Fixin', etc -- would be very nice indeed. It's less likely
to happen with say Excellence or European Car...

Subject: Re: 944 Turbo Injectors

George,

I don't have the flow-rate spec for 944 aspiro and turbo injectors in
front of my nose.  If the turbo injectors flow more fuel, and your
lambda sensor is working OK, it would largely be a matter of shorter
injection pulses to suck the air/fuel back to stoichometric.

Except for a couple of issues.  First is that injector fuel delivery
vs. pulse width is not completely linear.  There is a base injector
turn-on time, which I think is about 0.5 msec according to Bosch.  So
this will mess up the mapping a little.  (Do the math, and 0.5 msec
is actually a significant part of the injection time.  Remember that it
also affects turn-off too.)

The other issue is that when the WOT switch kicks, lambda gets thrown
out the door and you run open loop.  At which point your higher-flowing
injectors will dump a ton of fuel into the fray.  So imagine a twenty-
minute run group a Lime Rock, during which you're WOT 80% of the time
(OK, George, for you maybe 65%).  You're belching black smoke and you're
cat just melted.  Unless you get black flagged or run out of gas!

If for some reason the 951 injectors flowed *less*, you can look forward
to detonation when running open loop.

But you really should try this and let me know what happens!

Interesting side note:  Not too long ago, Bill Gates of Microsoft fame 
sent people around the world, buying up rights to reproduce famous art 
electronically.  This led to some very nice "screen savers" that 
display beautiful Impressionist artwork, legally.

So, there's a precedent to purchasing electronic reproduction rights to 
images...  Only question now is who's gonna buy it for Porschephiles, etc.?

Subject: Turbo injectors in 944

Hi, George.
 
>I'm thinking of installing some 944 Turbo injectors on my 83 944. Anybody
have any conjecture on the effects?
 
Conjecture: if there are no other engine changes, no effect other than to
help fuel somebody's economic recovery. If the present injectors can inject
enough fuel to burn with all the incoming air (plus there is usually some
reserve left in the injector design) then higher-flow injectors won't make a
bit of difference in power. You may even overfuel the thing, run rich. The
fuel injection system meters fuel by sending a rectangular wave to the
solenoid in the injector. For low flow, like idle, the oscilloscope trace of
voltage vs. time will look like this:
     _       _       _
    | |     | |     | |
    | |     | |     | |
    | |     | |     | |
    | |     | |     | |
____| |_____| |_____| |_____
 
 
At full load, it might look like this:
     ______   ______   ____
    |      | |      | |
    |      | |      | |
    |      | |      | |
    |      | |      | |
____|      |_|      |_|
 
 
Note that the injector isn't all the way open; that's a bit of built-in
reserve.
 
If the turbo injectors flow more fuel with the same electrical signal to the
solenoids and the same fuel feed pressure, then you may overfuel, and lose
fuel economy, unless maybe the oxygen sensor dials the mixture back to where
it should be.
 
Bottom line is, unless your engine has been modified to the point where it
will accept more air (cams, manifold, valves, exhausts, higher redline,
compression ratio) there is no reason to try to put more fuel in it, and
therefore no reason for higher-flow injectors.
 
(later) just read Kevin Gross' reply. What he said. He knows the system
better than I do.

Sorin, there's an adjustment for this under the carpet, between the 
driver's seat and the running board, just behind the parking brake 
handle.  Pull back @ the slit and you'll see it.  Adjust this, and 
you'll be all set.

The parking brake is a drum shoe type.  It doesn't grab the drum 
evenly, and grabs differently depending on which way the drum's trying 
to rotate.  Observing differences going forward vs. backward is normal, 
if the brake's loose.

Very true.  The idea of picking up laser scatter as you approach is 
addressing the fringe.  Realistically, you'll never know the beam's 
there 'til it hits you.  In this situation, a good defense is to keep 
packs of cars/trucks in front of you, to run "interference".  Pass on 
the [improper] right (USA only please!).  Look far ahead.  Use a CB

I found this interesting too.  Only problem is that headlights increase 
visibility of your vehicle: good for safety, bad for stealth driving.

Disagree.  My *favorite* is cops who use radar, and leave it on 
constantly.  I have maximal warning with no external dependencies (CB, 
scanner, etc.).  Simple to avoid.  Never gotten a ticket in this situation.

I've had all versions of this chip since 1.0.

The latest version(s) provide a *fantastic* power increase on same 93 
octane (USA (R+M)/2 rating).  Gas mileage change wasn't noticable.  I 
get 20-24 mpg street, 27 @75mph hiway, 9 on tracks with MUCH boost for 
extended periods.

Of course, higher engine output increases bearing loads and heat.  This 
doesn't help matters wrt engine life.  I've lost 2 head gaskets and all 
CV joints, though no bearings (yet).

Your results / happiness depends on how you'll be using the car and 
what you expect.  For street use, where full power is for short periods 
only, I wouldn't worry about anything.  Track use calls for more 
preventive maintenance.  The 951's cooling system is fully capable, so 
don't worry about that.  It's the bearings (esp. #2 main) that give out.

Hope this helps,

Dearest Harry,
 
From your last posting:

My, how you've changed the story! Back up one posting. On 3/10 you wrote
>As to the soft-jaw vice- HAH! Just ask Vic Skirmants about sheared keys on
>the pulley end using this technique... I was trying to help the poor guy
>out by telling him how to put the NEW fan on, where it DOES help to adjust
>and Torque (not HP) things on right.!
 
By inference, on 3/10 you claim that Vic Skirmants sheared his
pulley-end key when installing the fan with a conventional torque wrench, and
advocate an impact wrench instead for installing the nut. The situation
you imply today, that he sheared the key when removing the nut, is absolutely
of no interest to anybody (you get another key, you get another hub, you put
them back together.) Yes, there is a place for an impact wrench in all this. I
used one to remove the remnants of the fan. Not to install the replacement.
 
Or did you tell Vic Skirmants to install it with an impact wrench, and it
sheared off? That should surprise no one.
 
Rambling on, you write
>Yes, you might be able to successfully torque a fresh/clean nut with
>Loctite without ruining the key, but I trust my calibrated impact wrench
 
Let me get this straight, you use Loctite on the nut? No wonder you shear
things when you try to take them apart. As it is, installed dry, the stress
in the system approaches the yield strength of the steel key. Adding
Loctite to the equation is a good way to insure that things will shear when
you try to take them apart. If this application needed locking, the factory
would have used a tab washer.
 
>I've never lost a fan. Maybe it's because we take special care of the fans.
 
Back way up. We are piddling around here with some voodoo of yours about
calibrated electric impact wrenches, which is entirely beside the point. The
point being, the fan _blades_ failed. The steel disk that carries the blades
was intact and still firmly bolted to the generator shaft. Nut torque had
nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with this. And I defy you or anybody else
to find a nondestructive test for determining if the stakes holding the 28
blades (112 little tiny peened-over tabs) are about to fail. "we take
special care of the fans" is pure unadulterated voodoo bullshit.
 
>And yes, my engines make lots of revs- The stock once [sic] will peg the
>gauges in a 356, and I mean the tach and speedo (6000 rpm, 120 mph)...
 
I would like to see your tractor-cammed, stoplight-stump puller,
small-carb wonders pull 120 and 6000 on a level road. In fact, I have
the road. Ever hear of Mrs. Orcutt's Driveway? It's out in the Mojave
Desert. I test there. It's about four miles long and there isn't a car out
there that won't reach darn near terminal velocity on it. When do you want
to bring your car? I need four days' notice to get the road permits. My test
equipment consists of $30K worth of German electonics and optics, standard
test gear in the auto industry. It will record time, speed, distance, rpm, and
maximum observed speed in any run.
 
>And I guess I'll get my chance to build a real "competition" engines [sic]
 
What have you been doing these last 20 years? Never built a one? I noticed
how you have neatly avoided any mention of my challenge. Again, for you and
everybody else on Porschephiles to see, I'll repeat: There is a
PCA Zone 8 slalom on Sunday. in San Bernardino, at the SB County Sheriff's
Training Course. Zone 8 rules. Long sleeve shirt, Snell 80 helmet. Surely there
is at least one of your apostles who will defend the faith? Come on, it's
only 6 hours from the Bay Area. I'll even make it interesting. If you built
the engine for a car that will beat me and my co-driver in A/Stock, the bet
is for one new oil cooler with 8 mm studs. Not used, not repainted, not
ultrasonically cleaned, but new. A $25O value. Don't you feel obligated to
defend the true faith? Don't you have a car of your own? Or is your case like
that of the shoemaker whose kids go barefoot? I hope you build lots of
competition engines for the southern California area. I plan to run VARA this
year. The more the merrier, right?
 
But wait --
I understand you are building a 356 of your own -- and have been for 3 years.
I also hear that, after telling us that 44 IDF Webers are the way to more
power, (Secrets of the Inner Circle, pp. 200-201) you are going to use Solex
40 PII carbs. What is this, a case of "do as I say, not as I do"?
 
>So, if you have found any mistakes... in the book(s)
 
[note not capitalized, as might be the case for The Book -- The Bible; you are
not a recognized religion, not yet, and hopefully never...]
Sure, lotsa mistakes. I don't keep notes, but if I do put together a team to
write a definitive 356 engine manual, you can bet we'll go through yours with
the proverbial comb. But I'll give you a freebie, and you don't even have to
credit me when you fix the mistake. The most recent error I've seen is in
regard to oil coolers. "ABC's," p. 42. "About 1963, the factory (or Behr, the
cooler manufacturer..." Go find a late 356 (8 mm stud) or 912 cooler. Find the
mfr's type number, 04101 for the 356, I think 04102 for the 912. Above it is
the maker's logo. It's L&R. Nowhere does it say Behr. Now you can get full
credit for this problem if you identify L&R, you don't even have to credit me.
I know who they are. (Hint: they're in Stuttgart-Filderstadt.) Small point?
Yes, unless sometime in the future you are trying to contact the original
manufacturers of parts, to see if they can help with NLA stuff. Behr won't be
much help in this case.

Ten thousand copies for a car book is a lot. Two thousand is typical. Four thou

10K copies -- unless he takes one look at the manuscript or even sample ravings
and realizes he has the mother of all editing jobs ahead of him. If I write a

10K of them.

Subject: 356 fan, body brazing

Hi, Trond.
 
Interesting question. I went out to the garage and measured the shrapnel
from the fan. Each blade is about 18 g. The radius of gyration is about 85
mm. The four tabs that hold the blade to the fan discs are each about 6 x
1.6 mm.
 
F = G * v * v / r; F is centrifugal force, in kiloponds; G = weight of blade;
v = velocity in m/sec; r = radius in m.
 
At 6000 rpm with a blower ratio of 1.8, the fan is turning 10,800 rpm or 180
revs per sec. At the radius of gyration, .085 m, this implies a velocity of
 
180 x .085 x 2 x pi = 96.1 m/sec (or 346 km/h, or 215 mph!)
 
So F = .018 kg x 96.1 m/sec * 96.1 m/sec / .085 m = 1956 kiloponds force, or
in Newtons, 19166 N.
 
The cross section of the tabs is 4 x 6 x 1.6 sq. mm., or 38.4 sq. mm.
 
So the shear force on the tabs is 19166 N / 38.4 mm2 = 499, call it 500
N/mm, or 72,600 psi in American units.
 
This is not a small shear force, and it implies that the maker used an alloy
steel, not just cheap mild steel. It's not surprising that the fan has a
long, but nevertheless finite, fatigue life if cycled to high rpm.
 
Regarding the seat recliners, I don't know how the late 912 mechanism works,
but it's not big problem taking the 356 recliners apart. Polishing won't
save any money at replating time; the plater will chemically strip the old
stuff anyway.
 
>I'll braze him to death. I have never seen so much brass...
 
The problem with brazing is that once brazed, the metal is contaminated for
any future welding (steel fusion welding). You have to braze again, or cut
out all signs of brass and weld in a steel patch. Brazing has its place, as
a last resort when you can't fill it with steel. Factories use brazing in
places such as the areas where roof meets pillars. One disadvantage is that
it's difficult to get all the flux off. Even a hand-held wire brush may not
get it all, and then you have a corrostion starter there under your primer
and paint. On the underside, it doesn't matter, but on the visible outside
metal, it may come out very soon and ruin the paintjob.
 
I know one body and fender man who says brazing is for people who don't know
how to weld.
 
For the thin areas in your front clip and fenders, if you can hammer it out
close to shape and then lead it, that should do it. If you break through,
you will need to weld in a patch of steel, because lead will not hold on an
opening. You could also braze it, clean all the flux (blasting the small
area or grinding with a small grinder will work) and then lead over the
brazed area. Of course, you can use plastic fillers in place of lead (this
again gets into religious differences) but never use plastic to fill a hole;
weld or braze the hole first. Just like lead.
 
Beg forgiveness, still haven't photographed my friend's rotisserie. And did
you still need the holes in the A tunnel? It gets complicated, because there
are I think welded-on brackets for things. I looked at it one day, decided
to weld a patch or something, and promtly forgot.

Sorin,

  My '87 951 does the same thing. Since the parking brake is a set of shoes
in a drum inside the rear rotors, I assume that the lining material takes
some sort of "set" and doesn't hold as well in the reverse direction.
  This is all wild speculation, however. And I have resolved to live with the

At last fall's NER 924/944 tech session, I suggested this procedure,
and the Clair mechanic responded that that was the wrong way to do
it (on cars with rear discs).  He claimed that it would cause the 
shoes to drag at one end (ie, wherever the cable comes in - top or 
bottom), and that the adjustment was only for use in cable replacement.
The correct procedure is supposedly to adjust the star wheel behind the 
disc/drum.  It seems to me that the star wheel adjustment would be for 
shoe wear, and the cable adjustment for cable stretch.  What's the 
actual factory procedure?

Play of more than a smidgen in the turning direction is a pretty good

Axial play is completely cool.  Think about what a CV is supposed to do,

BTW, a little play in the stub axle at the transmission case is also
quite normal.

| Sorin, there's an adjustment for this under the carpet,
| between the driver's seat and the running board, just behind
| the parking brake handle.  Pull back @ the slit and you'll see
| it.  Adjust this, and you'll be all set.

| The parking brake is a drum shoe type.  It doesn't grab the
| drum evenly, and grabs differently depending on which way the
| drum's trying to rotate.  Observing differences going forward
| vs. backward is normal, if the brake's loose.

There is another adjustment point for the parking brake that may affect
this behaviour.  It is the star nut between the brake shoes.  If the shoes/
drums have worn sufficiently, then taking up the cable slack may not
be sufficient.  I recently replaced the rear disk pads on my '84 944 and
while I was at it I tightened up the emergency brake shoes using the
star nut.  The parking brake now works great.

The procedure is simple, although my description may not be as clear
as possible.  Block the front wheels and release the parking brake.
Jack one rear corner and remove the wheel (remembering to
slightly loosen the lug nuts before jacking).  There is a hole in the hub
between two of the wheel studs that is perhaps 20mm (~1/2") in diameter.
Turn the hub so that this hole is at the top.  Look through the hole with
the aid of a flashlight (a torch for those who speak the mother country
tongue).  Look for a gizmo (technical term) that resembles a 10 or 12
pointed star.  You will be seeing the star nut on edge.  You may have
to rotate the hub slightly to locate the star nut.  It is adjusted using a
flat blade screwdriver inserted into the hole.  The flat of the blade will
go into the valley between two of the star nuts points.  You move the
handle of the screwdriver up or down to rotate the star nut.  Now, at
this point you may be thoroughly confused.  Here is where a
picture would be worth many words.  Hopefully, while seated in front
of the wheel hub, things will be clearer.

Now that you can rotate the star nut, you need to rotate it sufficiently
to firmly engage the brake shoes.  That is, you will no longer be able
to rotate the hub.  Remember that you need to have the parking
brake lever in the car completely released.  The big question here
is which direction of star nut rotation will tighten the brake shoes.
Well, I can never remember, so if it doesn't get tight ratcheting the
star nut in one direction, try the other (that's what I do!).  Once the
hub will no longer rotate when firm pressure is applied, back off
the star nut about a half turn (about 6 clicks).  Rotate the hub.  A
slight rubbing is not a problem.  Heavy pressure means you need
to back the star nut off a couple more clicks.  This does not need
to be real precise.  Replace the wheel, doing the final tightening
of the lug nuts after the wheel is back on the ground.  Repeat this
process on the other side.

After you apply this procedure, you should find that the parking
brake lever will engage the brake at a lower point in its travel.
Hopefully, the brake will now function properly regardless of
the direction of slope.  Extreme cases will require replacement
of the parking brake shoes (although I cannot imagine this
being needed unless the car was abused and driven with the
parking brake engaged on many occasions).

Subject: Re: Indy & F1 engines

For several years, Porsche fielded factory entries in F1. These cars
were originally based upon the F2 Porsche. During the 1961 season, the
factory drivers were Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier - excellent talent.
There was also the private entry of the late Count Carel Godin deBeufort.
The cars were second string competitive. 1961 was dominated by the
Ferrari team and Sterling Moss in Rob Walker's private Lotus.

In 1962, the Team fielded a more competitive car with a flat-8. This
car gave Dan Gurney a win at the French Grand Prix. This was the
swan song of the factory team. I believe Porsche withdrew from 
competition at the end of 1962 to concentrate on Sports Car racing.

Developing racing cars is much more complicated than just the engine.
The mid-1980s McLaren-TAG cars were McLaren cars with TAG funded
development of the turbo engine by Porsche engineering. They were
successful, but quite different from the ill fated Porsche Indy car.
Much more, including prestige, was at stake in the factory Indy
car when Porsche developed the entire car.

With sales dramatically down, is this the time for Porsche to field a
F1 team? Indy team? I'd like to see it, but I think their attention is
focused upon the production car product line's problems today.

It's pretty straightforwards: money, and politics.

Money first. Porsche was super successful at sports car racing because they 
could legitimately argue that everything done either proved out  a
concept for the street, was the origin of a concept for the street,
or used something they'd developed originally for the street. It was
*VERY MUCH* a "win on Sunday sell on Monday" thing, since you could
*SEE* a 356, 911, 944, etc  win and then go buy one yourself! It also
made sense from an R & D perspective, rather than having to use separte
budgets for street and racing R & D, to a large extent they could be
combined.

Second part of money: a successful F1 team will spend probably $50 million
a year. For what kind of return?? Obviously, there *can be* money in it,
or no one would do it.... But for Porsche, which has lost money the last
couple of years, it just doesn't make sense... Although now that the
active components have been outlawed, it might make *MORE* sense...

Politics: I don't want to seem paranoid here, but I have prepared Porsches
to race in 4 different SCCA classes and one IMSA class, plus a couple of
SCCA autox classes. When you read the rules, you can see *CLEARLY* that
this paragraph or that was thrown in to remove some perceived Porsche
advantage. When you read the history of IMSA, you discover that starting
with the 934 and 935, *EVERY YEAR* (and sometimes more frequently)
there would be some new rule or interpreatation of a rule designed to
"give parity" between the Porsche cars and all the rolling speedbumps.

Guys, they're just out to get us.... And the factory knows that. Read
recent interviews with some of the senior management, and they all say
basicly "we *may* go back if things settle down and we get stable
rules".

When you read the Indycar story, that's wat did them in -- that
engine was built with the gentlemans' agreement that  you could use
N inches of boost and M in. sq. of intake, and the real final numbers
were *SIGNIFICANTLY* less than that. So the car never made enough 
power to get out of it's own way, much less to win. And over the
couple of years they stuck with it, massive changes (*EXPENSIVE* 
changes) were made to the car. It did eventually win, what, one
race? So they were on the right track. But see point #1 -- they ran
out of money. And because of Point #2, they had trouble getting another
major sponsor -- "let's see -- we give you money so you can win so 
they can change the rules and bump you out of competition again..."

It's ugly out there when your own past successes keep you from even
playing...

In a given model year and for cars in the same condition, the price
spread for second-hand 944-series cars is pretty small, I think.  You
can get a ten-year-old 944, and it will be priced accordingly.  In fact
you can find some very beautiful bargains if you look hard enough.  But
you can't find a 944S2 of that age.

The 944 series or 928 series is the best choice for daily driver if you
live in an area which gets snow.  Unless your surname is Zwart.

>Will it be a future collectable?

To some degree and at some point, sure, just like original VW's are
collectible, but probably never like a Bugatti is.  The production numbers
for S2's are small enough that it may become a special interest car, sort
of like the 912.  I wouldn't buy one today hoping to make a lot of money
from some collector ten years hence.

Subject: 944S2 worth the price?

Jordan Levy asks,

	Is the 944 S2 worth the premium over a standard 944?  If so , how much
	if both cars are in equal condition?  The car will be used as a daily
	driver and an occasional autocross.  Reliability is very important.
	Will it be a future collectable?

My answer, based upon owning a 944 and an S2 is: The S2 is incredibly more 
powerful. It has low-end, middle-end and top-end power. The regular 944 is a
very sweet car, but in sports car terms, it can't compare with the S2.

I can't comment on collectibility, but my S2  has been quite reliable and has
caused no problems. (In fact, it hasn't had the water pump or engine mount
failures that my 944 had.)

  Well, the feedback from Stan and others points out a flaw in my offer.  Yup,
there is a Copyright issue with Mag related images, so no go for now on Mag

a source of "good" images.  If a deal with PCA can be worked out in the future,

something back.  So here's my new and improved offer.  Send me email direct to

photo(s) of a Porsche.  Include return postage envelope (if you want it back).  
I'll scan it in, send you a copy, return the photo to you and upload the
image to tta.com (if its alright by you).

  Still sifting though the format issue, but with your request, let me know 
what format you would like.

  I'll take a look at the dealer stuff to see if it is Copyrighted, probably is 
too. :-(

  I won't attempt to upload any Copyrighted stuff to tta.com.

  In case of a large response to my offer, it take about 15 minutes of my time 
for a image, so no scrapbooks :-) please.  I can only do a few at a time.

Jim,
Check the "time line" of the records to determine if it has been sitting 
long or just a weekend warrior.   You may want to talk to the shops that did 
work on it.
All the relays under the panel even scared an electrical type like me.   
Relays are like a good partner, they don't take to neglect very well.   
Check out everything electrical, period.

I agree with Col. Pete on the price being too high,  even Pano adds are 
lower.   

Pros-  If it is a Euro with the higher HP motor.
       If they have performed the 30K with the cam belt replaced.

Cons-  If they haven't done the 30K.........

It is hard to argue with experimental evidence, and the Car and Driver
article sounded to me to be experimentally sound. As far as an
explanation, many incandescent sources (ie car headlights, etc.) have
significant emissions in the near infared. I don't know the wavelengths
used by the laser speed monitors, but the idea that a headlight emits
significant (relative to a reflection of a mw level signal) energy there
is quite plausible.

I expect that we will see more specifically designed laser "interferers"
on the market before too long. Unlike the radio frequency spectrum
(including microwaves), I know of no emission restrictions (other than
safety issues) in the optical spectrum. Thus there are no legal issues
with optical jammers. Relative to microwaves, it is relatively easy
to get lots of optical power (watts) over wide wavelength ranges, and
to focus that energy in a particular direction or range of directions.
It is also relatively easy to block the visible emissions, so that the
officer doesn't see your source. Headlights may be the most expedient
answer, since the manufacturers thoughtfully chose to provide them as
standard equipment, but they may not be the best solution as a laser
radar jammer. I would guess that there is a "Mike Valentine of optics"
out there right now gearing up in this area (or will be soon). The key
answer, though, is that, unlike microwave, the solution is (IMHO) jamming
rather than detection.

One might think that but I have been led to believe that typical halogen
headlights emit a very broad spectrum of light at a very high intensity. 
I remember seeing a test using a large auxiliary light to "jam" lidar.  I

  Agreed ..

  Does anyone have the original C/D article on laser of about a year ago?

  In it the frequency is listed ..

  FYI, There are just TWO basic types of IR laser diodes available ..

  or rather two different wavelenghts of emission  ..

From: pfile (Porschephiles Mailer)
Subject: Forwarded from Dom Miliano

 
I have been reading the traffic on Porsche's Indy and F1 efforts and can't 
resist putting in my 2 cents.  I heard Chris Economacki speak about 
Porsche's recent F1 and Indy efforts and according to him, the F1 engine was 
in the 95th percentile for power and reliability.  The drivers, team and 
chassis was significantly below that and that's why they qualified so badly 
for the '92 F1 race and dropped out shortly there after.  Stan is right in 
that the effort was under funded - Honda (reportedly) spent $50 million just 
on the engine program.  That did not include sushi money, polish for Senna's 
halo or any walking around money for Ron Dennis.
 
The Indy effort was sabotaged twice.  Once when Danny Ongias (1978 
Interscope effort) was going to drive but Porsche was told that the motor 
they had couldn't run with the same boost they were led to believe they 
could run.  That car never turned a wheel in anger, thereby creating  one of 
the rarest Porsche literature pieces  - the press kit for that Interscope 
car.  The blame for this flop falls more with the Indy people IMHO than with 
Porsche.
 
The more recent efforts were sabotaged by Porsche's pride, lack of $$$, the 
death of Al Holbert and Mr. Penske's power to run the CART board.  The pride 
was in trying to develop an engine and a chassis when they hadn't built an 
open wheel car since the early 1960's.  I read a quote from a Porsche 
engineer that said "a race car is a race car, how hard could it be?"  They 
found out when Al Unser Sr. said many not nice things about the Porsche 
designed chassis like "where have these guys been, the aerodynamics are 10 
years behind."
 
Once they bought a chassis and got Teo Fabi as wheel man, things looked 
promising for Porsche, especially on the road courses.  When Holbert died, 
much of the starch went out of Porsche's effort until Walker stepped in and 
they added a second driver. When Porsche announced they had developed a 
carbon fiber tub, Penske and his close personal friends (AKA toadies) on the 
CART board outlawed it and basically put the last nail in Porsche's Indy 
coffin.
 
F1 is way too expensive for a small INDEPENDENT company selling a few 
thousand sports cars a year (unless they start selling they for the bloated 
prices of a Ferrari).  And. Porsche doesn't need Indy to sell cars and Indy 
doesn't need Porsche to sell tickets. That means (to me anyway) we will not 
see Porsche in F1 or Indy any time soon.  (Unless Mercedes buys Porsche  - 
then all bets are off.)

   1) Is there a good reference for repairing the sunroof on my 77 911?  I am
      looking for something that describes replacing the cables and possibly
      troubleshooting the motor.  I will also need to replace the seals, so it
      would be a plus if the reference describes this as well.  I remember seeing
      a reference made in either Excellence or Panorama about a past article
      that talked about the sunroof. Does this article have some of the info I
      need? I have been told the best reference is the factory manual (which
      leads me to my next question). 

I managed to disassemble and reassemble most of my sunroom mechanism
based on the info in the Haynes manual.  I didn't actually replace the
cables or put in new seals, however.  The biggest problem I had was
not getting the headliner dirty (especially the part on the underside of the
roof panel).

If you just want to test the motor, unzip the opening in the back of
the headliner and undo the two screws holding the motor's drive gear
up against the "toothed" cables.  The drive mechanism should swing
down, disengaging from the cables.  You can then operate the sunroof
switch to see if the motor works and the gear spins, etc.  Next, try
manually sliding the roof back and forth a bit (by hand, without
disassembling it) and see if the cables slide nicely by the openings

I have had a number of knowledgeable people recommend the Swepco 201 gear oil
for the 944 transmission.  Someone, I think it was a Ferarri repair shop,
even told me that this oil was specifically designed for Porsche.  In any event
I am planning on changing the oil in my transmission ('88 924S) with this oil
this weekend.

With respect to the GL4/5 rating, higher GL rated oils are used in heavier duty
applications.  So having a GL5 instead of GL4 should provide more protection.

I've heard from 2 sources that Swepco in the transmission is not 
desirable.  Mobil 1 is preferred.  Kevin Gross (on this list) has 
remarked on Swepco's resulting gear noise level (loud).  I have no 
factual information beyond this.  It's a good oil; just not the best in 
all-around consideration from what I've heard.

I agree with the previous post about the history of Porsche in Indy and FI.

  CART has been the main problem with new people getting into Indy. Does any
one remember Alfa Romero two year ago,  They gave it a good try but finally
threw in the towel.  And now CART is trying the same with Honda and there
new engine,  (must have two team running it the first year)...

  But I the news Friday Tony George (Owner of the Indy-500) is tired of CART
and is going back to USAC and starting a new series..  And the 500 might
go with it!!!  Tony want to get US car makers and drivers back in open
wheel racing, So we will set back and see what happens....

  And now back to something Porsche related.

Dear Forza machina d'Italia!

The Porsche club event you were at was NOT a race.  It was
a driver's education event.  Nobody (else) there was trying
to prove anything, and neither should you.

If you were following that close in the corners, then 
"getting collected" would serve you right!  

The owners of those $2.5 Mill of equipment do not appreciate
you using your $7000 to intentionally endanger them while

Indulge me while a gloat a bit and express my enthusiasm
for Italian cars....

Just returned from a Porsche club event at Summit Point saturday.
I was there as a BSR instructor sitting in on the Porsche Club 
instructor's clinic. My X1/9 was the only non-Porsche there.
They had a chuckle when the chief PCA instructor said there would
be a Fiat out on the track with them...

They had less of a chuckle when I passed most of them while we
drove the track counter-race, to pick up the line from scratch.
That's right, me and the little old Fiat. The track was wet in
parts and some of the high horsepower and A008 guys had a hard
time controlling wheelspin and vehicle attitude.

Circulating the track clockwise (properly) I put enough pressure
on a 911 and two 944's that they all ended up spinning right in 
front of me. A look in their rearviews would have not shown my
front bumper I was that close going out of the carousel through 
6b,7 and 8. The problem was both 944 drivers did not lock up once
they spun and continued to carom all over the track. I had my 
hands full in both cases to avoid a collision. In one case I had 
to drive well off the track onto the dirt.

Afterwards everyone had to come by and talk about my car, or make
excuses about their tires or their weight distribution, blah, blah.
Except the two 944 spinners whom I never saw off-track (out of their
cars that is). Afterwards, one of the PCA guys running the events told
me the cornerworkers were radioing all my action to each other and that
I was quite the talk of the track, especially since I was doing all of
this carrying a 78 year-old man with me. He is an amazing guy who owns
a 64 Lotus Elan and raced a Brabham BT8 but that's another story.

I simply told the PCA guy cooly that I was surprised the PCA
instructors don't know to lock up when they spin, and that I almost got
collected by two 944's on two separate occasions. He replied "oh we do
but those 944's have ABS and they can't lock up." Great. I told him
they should then learn how to disconnect the "safety" feature when on
the track.

Needless to say, nobody was laughing at the little X1/9 when I left.
Total pricetag on overtaken machinery estimated at 2.5 million
dollars.  Not bad for $7,000 worth of a great design.

All in all a good day. I must add though that the PCA folks were for
the most part good guys.

Two quick questions.

1)  On my '86 928S, the tail light warning light is coming on.
    I have check the lights at night, w/o removing the lenses and they
    all seem to be working fine.
    I was thinking that maybe I should remove all the bulbs and clean the 
    contacts.
    Before I do this, has anyone experienced a pheomenon like this where a
    warning light comes on, but the lights appear to be working ?
    Could it be that the contacts need cleaning and this is just an 
    intermittent problem ?
    Are more serious problems indicated by this phenomenon ?

2)  I also have an '83 Honda Accord 5-speed, the 928 is an automatic.
    I rarely use the clutch when I up-shift or down-shift.  There seem to 
    be a limited number of points where I can shift smoothly w/o the 
    clutch.  I drove my friends '90 300ZX and found that I could shift 
    w/o the clutch almost anywhere (at least up-shifting). {Boy was he
    pissed off when he noticed that I was shifting smoother than he was
    and then he got really pissed off when he found out that I was not even
    using the clutch.}

    My question is :  What are the trannies in the p-cars like ?
    Does anyone out there drive there p-cars w/o using the clutch ?

Okay, so my questions were not all that quick.

The second question was just for interest, but the first one is a real
concern of mine.

Thanks,

Matt

Actually, 944's want a GL5, and I think the Swepco is a GL6.  I dunno

made shifting too difficult up here Northeast, and switched to Mobil

it be realistic to consider 7x16 wheels all around for now with 205's and

[much deleted]

Well, this guy certainly sounds like a good driver.  So good in fact, 
that he endangered quite a few people with overly aggressive driving 
and tailgating.

In the Northeast Region PCA, this behavior will win a driver a black 
flag and a stern "speaking-to" in the pits.  Second violation sends the 
driver home.  In the case of an instructor, he/she could lose their 
instructor status/privilege.

Doesn't matter what type of car; we'll do this to 911 drivers as fast 
as Fiat, BMW, or any other marque.

Subject: Is Porsche Racing?

Folks,

Recent interesting posts regarding Porsche and the professional and
amateur racing world have my febrile mind all a-twitter.  I guess the
biggest question on my mind, and it really is a question, is: What
exactly is Porsche AG up to in the racing world -- what do they want,
what does it mean to them, what makes the race dept. get out of bed
in the morning and turn wrenches?

Regarding the recent Indycar effort, various impressions.  First off, it
is really hard to not think of them as arrogant bastards.  That they
could parachute in with a 100% new effort and win.  Now, once they
dropped their own chassis and went with a March, I think they did very
well indeed for a two-year effort.  So why on earth did they walk away
from it?  They had at the end of the program, they say, the best engine
out there.  Gone.  Damned shame.  What were they thinking?

With respect to Stan's comments regarding technical stuff, I think he's
talking about the induction pop-off valve and perhaps the all-composite
monocoque.  On the former, they spent a lot of time and effort to find
the very best place for the valve, so that they could run a little more
boost.  In other words, just like the 935 Group 5 effort, they worked
really hard to skirt the rules.  Unlike the Group 5 effort, the playing
field got leveled, out from under their proverbial feet.

Was that bad?  One of the eternal questions in racing, really.  Should the
team with the biggest engineering budget or most adventurous rule
interpretation reap an advantage?  That can make for pretty boring racing. 
F1 was, for the most part, boring as hell last year because you knew Prost
or Hill would win.  Is Hill a better driver than Alesi?  Who knows.  I do
know that the race (er, forget which one) in which Alesi had the lead for
a while was one of the most interesting to watch.

It also makes for boring Supercar racing too, and after three years of
straight butt-kicking, one wonders what will happen next year to the
C2 Turbos.  I think you have to expect the powers-that-be will try to
even things up in any series, not to the detriment of Porsche but to the
betterment of everyone.

Regarding the Indycar all-composite monocoque.  My understanding is that
Indy had never allowed it for safety reasons.  A composite bottom will
shatter on impact rather than deform.  Despite this, Porsche went ahead
and made one.  Then Derrick Walker, wearing whatever hat he had on, er,
as head of the constructors' council or whatever they called it, DQ'ed his
own team's car.

The several comments regarding poor little Porsche trying to play in the
F1 circus are just silly.  Ferrari does it with their sales base.  And
when was the last time you drove a Williams-mobile or a Mclaren?  In fact,
Ferrari is the only team out there building its own chassis and car.  All
the other teams are packages put together with this engine, that chassis,
and a whole lot of sponsor money.  Porsche could do it.

But what does Porsche want to do?  They are so damn wedded to a thirty-
year-old platform and fifty-year-old guys building it and driving it.  No
disrespect to the 911, which I love.  But there is more to racing than
an air-cooled boxer-six, yet Porsche cannot get away from it.  They
wouldn't produce and sell a 3.0 litre 944S2 Turbo because the prototype
sucked the doors off the 930 flagship.  Tsk, tsk.  Word now reaches my
ears that the higher-ups are all in a tizzy because the 968 RS Turbo is
doing just that.  Not to mention the fact that the 968 CS has garnered
a few sportscar-of-the-year sorts of awards, oh je!

(Not that we will ever see either car here in the US.  Which only reminds
me of how they tried to sleaze the 959 past the DOT, and had their bluff
rightly called.)

And, with all due respect to their fraternity of drivers, each of whom is
ten times the driver I can ever hope to be, you have to wonder why they are
so reluctant to put some younger talent behind the wheel once it a while.  A
Hakkinen (who won the Supercar race before the Hungarian GP last year) or
a Tommy Kendall.  Or Dave Donohue, Mark's son, who after cutting his teeth
on Porsches has a BMW factory ride this year.  Same impressions on the
engineering side, same due respect to them all.

Nope, we get Juergen, Hurley, or Walter driving a two-valve, air-cooled,
boxer six.  Pinch me.

I disagree with you, Dom.  Porsche does need Indy, F1, and racing in
general, both to earn market awareness and to better the breed.  Porsche's
cachet is waning, and producing a Miata-alike like the Boxster isn't
going to get it back.  If Porsche really had balls, they'd build a Nascar
or Winston Cup car!

But I digress...

Bruce, about 2 years ago I had a rather dramatic introduction to chemicals

wrapped in pink anti-static bags (the kind that holds printed circuit 
boards).  Well, the amines and amides in the topical anti-static coating 
attacked the polycarbonate and caused cracks, esp in hi-stress areas 
(stress from moulding not usage) eg corners.  Just a touch, and 2 weeks 
after storage at 25degC room temp, bingo.  I'm no chemical engr, and 
I'm not sure about "any paint" or solvent, but I'd be careful.  If you can,

I have had a similar problem. My 911 pulled left. The explanation

causing the car to follow the road camber strongly and pull left. 

New strut inserts and another alignment job cured the problem.

Subject: LASER .. no laws against countermeasures, yet!

I haven't seen any specs, but the laser speed systems probably
are most likely simple gallium arsenide lasers (the kind that
let your CD player work).  I haven't seen any designs, but the
circuit is probably a mimic of the radar detectors and modulates
the lasers at a high frequency (say something like 1000 megaherz).
The detector looks at the doppler shift in this modulated frequency,
which is very easy to sort our from any steady source of light.  It
can be audio frequencies and speed determined by counting.

If you wanted to design countermeasures, you probably would have
to take one of four paths.  First would be to have enough light
to saturate the detector and obscure the signal (good luck).
Second would be knowledge of the modulation frequency and transmission
of some bogus return signal.  Third would be modulation of a laser
with a wide-band noise generator and confuse the detector with trash.
Fourth would be to drive carefully and unprotected, as you really
need to do with instant-on radar anyway.

     Not only do your bulbs need to work, they need to be -balanced.-
  The computer apparently looks for a difference in loads between the bulbs.
  You have to match left and right bulbs to be the same brand; I think the
  dealer supplied bulbs are consistently matched, but if you just get a bulb
  at the local auto parts store you may get your red warning light. It is also
  okay to use those bulbs from the local store, just change both sides.
     Strange but true.....I put up with that danged warning light forever

  Trond, I'm unable to direct email you, so appologies to the pphiles.

  You have been rather busy..downright prolific!
  Hang in there!

 -On your rotisserie, getting the car up to the height to attach to the
thing can be one of your most hazardous undertakings.  Dont risk your
work getting mashed at this point.
 Use either an engine lift or truck floor jack(s) capable of lifting to that
height.  The problem with using a jack is the weight is all  balanced
on the jack(s) and is unstable at best (single point lift from below).
  When you get the car that high off the floor you realize the center of 
gravity also goes for a loss of control -beware.

 I use a 3 ton hydraulic engine lift attached to a custom built sling
that holds the car at balance during suspension.  This allows me to not
only lift and (de)attach the body to the rotisserie, but also gives provision
for setting body on jack stands or a trailer.  It is a much safer system
for those of us who do not own a car lift.

 In making the sling, one MUST use 'proofed' chain rated for load lifting.
 Make everything overbuilt (heavier guage) and loop the chain under
the lift elements, and secure the chain to prevent shifting.

 Even then it's still 'hard to fly..easy to die'.

They responded thet they thought it was enough, given that is just for
that long walk from the truck into the customs office to nod a couple times.
I replied that I hoped they had enough, because it will be the absolute
bloody last dollar they EVER manage to gouge out of my pocket!!

Some other Indycar bigwig, Carl Haas perhaps, was the source of

utter: "If that's the car, it ain't got the message."

The Indy engine was the subject of a long Panorama article last
year.  I particularly liked the idea of irradiating the rods &
crank, then measuring the radioactivity of the oil to determine
the main bearing wear rate.

Maybe I should explain myself.  Coming from the British car crowd, the whole 
driving experience is a lot more important to me than sheer speed.  In fact, 
I am willing to bet that most 911 owners feel this way.  There are certainly 
cars out there that are faster and more driveable than a 911 or most 
Porsches, for that matter.  I am aware of the headaches that can be involved 
in making them work right.  I had a trio of Weber sidedrafts on an old TR-6, 
and it was Bitch (with a capital "B" !!!) to get them going and producing 
power, including cannibalization of a couple of other Triumphs and a still 
unknown piece of american iron.  Simply put, I like the way they feel and 
sound, and I enjoy spending my time adjusting them.  I'm putting them on my 
latest TR if I can ever get it back together, and  I simply wondered if 
anyone on the net had any experience with them on 911s.

BUZZZZ try again;
Its a Centripetal force, this is basic Physics.  I don't know what a
kilopond is does a duck use it? ;-).  This formula is just F=ma for a
rotating body (F=m v**2/r). The units need to be consistant.  Since
you use metric most places your G is NOT weight of the blade it is
the MASS, the mass of the blade in Kilograms.

The metric units for F (force) are Newtons where N = Kg Meter/sec**2.

Subject: Tire Sizing

Hello there.  A little while I posted an inquiry regarding tire recommendations
for my 1983 944.  I have read through a considerable amount of stuff on various
brands and models, and I don't really need anything else on that front.
However, I am now concerned about what size tires to get.

I have 15"x7" wheels -- the original equipment.  The original tires were 215/60
Pirelli P6 (which are V rated).  Two of the tires are worn out while two are in
excellent shape.  I was thinking of replacing the two worn out tires with
225/50, which would lower whichever end of the car I put them on by about 3/4 of
an inch.  I would probably put them on the back. When the other two Pirellis
wore out, I would also replace them with 225/50, but that won't probably be for
probably another two years.

Most of the tire shops I have called don't see any real problem with this.
However, a couple have warned me of dire consequences, to the point where one
shop refuses to sell me the 225/50 size.  The gist of their warning is that the
car will be badly unbalanced, will torque steer under power, and will be
generally unsafe.  If what they are saying is true, I will obviously stick with
the stock tire size.  One tire place even went so far as to say that they would
not recommend 225/50 even if I put them on all four corners.  That place seemed
to be of the view that if 215/60 is what came stock, that's what I should stick
with as Porsche designed the car for that tire size.

I would certainly appreciate any and all input on this question.  Thanks in
advance for your help!  (By the way, I'm probably going to replace the two worn
out P6 tires with Dunlop D40M2 tires.)

News from France.

This week end, I saw a row of three 993 cabriolet 
(french word, is it convertible in english)
on the road.
Two were metallic grey and one yellow !
this was very impressive as they drove following each other !
I was lucky this day as we stopped at the same gas station.
I had a talk with one of the drivers.
They all were Weissach ingeneers trying these prototypes !
They were driving to the Mont Saint-Michel (about 80 Km from home).

The cars were not perfectly finished,
 (prototype as I said), we could see the metal sheet
at the back of the car (behind the driver there was no small seat).

I have heard the motor or should I say I could have heard the motor,
as it was very silent.

A long time to dream before affording one !

Maybe you know this, but shifting without the clutch destroys 
synchronizers, unless you can shift like a robot, perfect every time!  
As you push the two meshing gears together, they invariably have 
slightly different speeds.  The synchronizer tries to match their 
speeds, but it's an easier job if they're free-wheeling than if they're 
loaded via the tires and earth.

Subject: Vehicle Leasing

Fellow List Members:
			I want to tell you about something that may help you 
save some MONEY. I work for AT&T. They have just started offering auto leasing
to the public, but it's the best kept secret in the U.S.. And, boy, is it a 
good deal.
	See, AT&T has a huge fleet dept. that buys thousands and thousands and 
thousands of vehicles a year at prices a lot lower than you or I could ever 
hope to get. Someone had the bright idea years ago to allow the employees to 
lease vehicles at low rates based from the low purchase prices. This, needless
to say, was received warmly by the 300,000 employees of AT&T. Very recently, 
they started offering it to the public, but they don't really advertise it. 
	I just got a new Dodge pickup(I admit it,my personal toy) through 
them, and it was very much different than going to the dealership. I didn't 
get to meet a lot of salesmen, I didn't have to negotiate with a sales mgr. by
remote satellite, and I didn't have to meet a finance mgr. and learn all about
fabric protectant and credit life insurance.
	What I did was call up 1-800 CAR LEASE, tell them what I wanted(they 
do any make and model sold in the U.S., plus used cars up to three years old),
they took my credit application by fax, gave me payments, sent out the 
contract by FedEx(prepaid return), and they make the new vehicle show up like 
voodoo at a dealer next to my house. So...the only time I see a dealer is when
I sign a delivery receipt and drive away. Pretty cool.
 	Now, listen to this: Just for kicks, I comparison shopped three 
dealers. The closest any one of them could get was $63.00 away. Per month! 
That's on a 36 mo. lease, same terms, same equipment. And AT&T gives you free 
GAP insurance with the lease. That was extra from the dealers. Plus, it's a 
much lower charge per mile for going over 15,000 miles a year with AT&T. So 
I'm happy.
	You know, some of us are lucky enough to drive what we want every day 
and not worry about money. I'm not in that group. I have a fun vehicle, two 
commuter vehicles, and of course, a project. On the first three, I need to 
spend as little as possible(and still be happy with what I have). I thought 
that some of you might be in the same fix. This is my public service for the 
week. It's not about money for AT&T- if ALL of you signed up tomorrow, it 
wouldn't even be a blip on the revenue screen for them. It's about your money 
and getting more for it. Call them. Don't call them. It's up to you. I just 
wanted to make you aware that the option exists and that it might save you 
some coin. And, if you're like me, you'll then throw it away on an OLD car.
	It's 1-800 CAR LEASE. They're open 8am to 6pm EST. Hope it helps some 
of you out.

P.S. Unbelievable service level also- they'll talk to you even if you're not 
quit ready yet, patiently explain everything, send you a brochure first, 
etc... whatever YOU want to do.

Subject: 911 Home Alignment

In reply to William Costello's question regarding the ad
for the $12 home alignment manual for 911s :

I have to admit, yes, I bought it.  Being the consummate do-
it-yourselfer, I bought this particular manual (from a guy named
Ray Scruggs, I believe).  At the time I was planning to replace
my rear torsion bars and figured that doing that would screw
up my alignment.  I wasn't disappointed.  Anyway, the principles
in the manual are relatively sound (I don't trust the section on
"weight jacking" the corners).  One thing that the manual does 
tell you though is *how* to make the adjustments.  For example,
rotating the rear banana arm counterclockwise to increase/
decrease camber etc.  The results of this guy's methods are
a function of how much time and accuracy you put into taking
the measurements - this is probably where a shop has an
advantage over the do-it-yourselfer (you can only get so close
with a tape measure and a level). 

For what it's worth, it worked for me.  And, like the author mentions
in the front of the manual - worst case, you give up and take it to an
alignment shop.

you some good recommendations for starting points on suspension settings for
both track and street.

The other pamphlet, "RaysTrack", is full of AX driving techniques and
strategy, also well worth the read...

Ray is a longtime PCA AXer and Timetrialer in Nor Cal. He is one of the
fastest, smoothest and consistent drivers I personally know and has been doing
car set up for street and track on his own car and customer's cars for years.

Now after reading Ray's stuff you decide that the alignment is not something
you want to tackle, give Ed Mayo a call.  He has a shop in the Dallas area
and is reported to do a pretty fine suspension set-up.  Don't have his #
handy, but look in the book under Mayo.  BTW he does complete 911 service
too....

Ed won't remember me, but tell him the guy that kicked his rear last year at
Parade sent you. ;-)  (Ed's a nice guy, he'll laugh)...

I believe that I read somewhere, perhaps in one of the optics or 
electronics trade rags, that they do not use a doppler technique,
but use a direct time of transit measurement, either with a pulse
stream or a repetitive sequence, and then measure change in position
of the target with time.

What seemed to work experimentally for Car and Driver was an optical
noise source, which in their case happened to be an incandescent
bulb. It tends to be relatively difficult to get much optical selectivity,
since they almost certainly use a power detector as opposed to any kind
of coherent (i.e. heterodyned) receiver, and direct optical selectivity
tends to be difficult and/or expensive. Given this, a broadband optical
noise source stands a good chance of killing the SNR after the
photodetector, which is my guess of what happened in the C+D experiment.
A narrowband source such as any kind of laser seems to be doing it the
hard way. I would have assumed that an exercise in finding the common,
commercial incandescent bulb with the best power spectral density in
the wavelength region where the laser operates, plus some reflector
design to send most of the light to perhaps a 45 degree wide horizontal
angle and perhaps a 10-20 degree wide vertical angle would do the job
reasonably nicely. A blocking filter for visible light would help in
terms of hiding the purpose.

Subject: 88 '911 rattle

I am currently considering an '88 911 coupe.  I have had the car
inspected, and it looks pretty good, but I have one question: the car
makes a tinny sort of rattle sound when first engaging the clutch from
a full stop, especially if the revs are low.  Of course, I can't
pinpoint where the noise is coming from, it's just "down below"
somewhere.  The noise stops when the clutch is fully released and the
car is underway.  The owner claims that it has done this for the 60K
miles he has owned it, and the mechanic says he has heard '88-89 cars
make this kind of sound, (possibly due to a loose shift linkage?)
although this one is a bit more pronounced.

So, anyone else heard anything like this.  If my mechanic (Dieter at
D&M Motors in Palo Alto) isn't worried, should I be?

Subject: Porsche racing



Kevin C. Gross raised some interesting questions in his tome, Is
Porsche Racing?

Here are my humble opinions.

>What exactly is Porsche AG up to in the racing world?<
Tough to answer because neither Porsche, nor any other car
manufacturing company, is likely to disclose their racing development
and marketing strategy. You could ask the question of Mercedes Benz and
would likely get a vague answer. It's my understanding that Porsche is
putting most of it's 1994 racing budget behind a LeMans car (that won't
be legal in any other venue).

>So why on earth did they walk away from it (Indy car racing)?<
Maybe the CART requirement to supply engines to franchise holders, and
certainly the money required to be competitive would have put a lid on
any sports car racing effort. The latter is not a concern of Williams,
Ferrari, McLaren, Lola, Penske, et. al.

>Should the team with the biggest engineering budget or most
adventurous rule interpretation reap the advantage?<
Yes! Money and ingenuity wins - from FV to F-1. That's life. You try
and contain your costs by picking the venue with the best cost/benefit
to the share-holders.

>Ferrari does it (Formula One) with their sales base.<
No, with FIAT money, which may not last forever.

>But there is more to racing than an air-cooled boxer six, yet Porsche
cannot get away from it.<
Porsche sells cars - 911 cars - that's their business. When they sell
more cars with a V-24, they'll race one.

>You have to wonder why they (Porsche) are so reluctant to put some
younger talent behind the wheel.<
Better than Hans Stuck? 

>Porsche's cachet is waning, and producing a Miata-like Boxster isn't
going to get it back.<
The Miata to the Boxster is like the RX-7 is to the 944S2 Turbo. Not
even close.

So you'r in love with the experience.  Particularly the British car
experience, Have I got the solution for you; 
	Step 1:  Remove all the accessible hardware and throw it away.
 Go out and buy yourself lots of different sizes of english, metric,
and Witworth hardware in both course and fine pitch.  Put it all in
one bin and shake.  Now reassemble everything with this hardware so
you can have the true experience of never knowing what wrench to use.
	Step 2: Remove and throw away your wiring harness. 
Individually wire every component in the car with one size wire (make
sure you use bullet connectors).  Fuse everything thru 2 35Amp fuses.
For the truely fanatical just use one spool of black insulated wire.
	Step 2B:  throw away anything that says BOSCH on it and
replace it with Lucas Parts
	Step 3:  This one is more difficult, a Porsche flat 6 is way
to reliable just changing to webers won't give you that true
experience your looking for.  Maybe an old VW engine, or put your TR
engine in there, or maybe an engine from a 2CV.  No I've got it start
with a VW engine then graft on another pair of cyls, this should leak
the required fluids, and be a true nightmare to get working.  You can
give the old engine to me;-)

lots of :-)

In all seriousness when I want to fiddle I work on my Land Rover 88
(thats the wheelbase not the year), its got leaks, a carb to adjust,
and a bizzar mix of hardware.  I don't try to make my Porsche
unreliable and need constant tinkering.  The guy across from me at
work has a Jag E type in need of work if'n your interested.

Trying to fix the MFI on my '69S, I poured lots of money down a rathole (until I 
traded him in on a new mechanic :^) ).  On the advice of my original mechanic, I 
had the injection rebuilt a couple of times to try to get rid of a flat spot at 
about 3000rpm.  Nothing helped -- the flat spot remained.  

After I switched mechanics (once I discovered fraud on the part of my original
one), my new mechanic told me that if the MFI works, DON'T touch it and if it 
doesn't work, *DON'T TOUCH IT*.  He said that it's severely difficult (and 
severely expensive) to fix a messed-up mechanical injection system.  On the other 
hand, he said that an MFI system that works well will work well forever.

conversion like the one that was anonymously posted on p-philes

for street/autox, and probably as a daily driver.

I am wondering what kinds of things I should be looking for when
I start visiting 914s for sale. I'm interested in any of the
following information:

Reliability of 914-conversions
Any conversions for sale in the San Francisco Bay area
What to watch out for (other than general rust, esp. around

Subject: Re: Is Porsche Racing?

A couple of comments regarding Porsche's involvement in racing,  
particularly in the US.

As far as I can tell, Porsche AG's only direct involvement in US auto  
racing is with the Kelly Moss 911 Turbo effort, competing in the SCCA  
World Challenge series.  They are no longer involved in Supercar racing,  
though Brumos Porsche fielded an obviously factory-supported effort at  
Daytona and probably will at Sebring as well.

Alwin Springer at Porsche Motorsport North America is extremely helpful,  
but has no significant budget for activities other than the World  
Challenge effort.

I wasn't at the first World Challenge race, which was at Miami on Feb  
27th, but I do know the Kelly Moss 911 Turbos were driven by Price Cobb  
and Mauro Baldi (former World Sportscar Champion).  They were slightly  
faster than the 300ZX Turbos and other Class A cars, and the two 911s  
qualified on the front row.  However, it began to rain on the pace lap,  
and many Class B and C cars--much slower in the dry, but who started the  
race on rain tires--beat them to the finish of the one-hour race,  
apparently because the Kelly Moss crew was slow calling their cars into  
the pits and took a ridiculuously long time to change tires.  Price Cobb  
made a valiant effort to make up the several lap deficit, in the process  
setting fast lap of the race, but ended up 25th overall.  Mauro Baldi  
crashed out after 6 laps.  The winner in Class A was the 944 Turbo of  
Leigh Miller Racing, which came in on the pace lap to change to rain  
tires, a smart tactical move.

The second race of the season is not until June 4th at Mid-Ohio, so  
presumably there will be more Class A entries (possibly including Lotus  
Esprit Turbos, NSXs, and Corvettes).  Hopefully we'll be there with our  
944 Turbo.

Porsche has a very clear reason for wanting to race 911 Turbos, since this  
car is the flagship Porsche.  Unfortunately, although the rearward weight  
bias makes these cars put the power down very well and brake very well,  
their handling is not good.  Although the 968 Turbo RS is inherently a  
faster car, Porsche does not want it to be run against the 911 Turbos or  
3.8 RSRs:  one Porsche dealer was planning on racing one at Daytona, but  
Porsche AG asked him not to and would not deliver the car in time.

Porsche has historically been very stubborn in certain areas, and seems to  
believe that the engine compartment is the only place where races are won.    
They seem to be continuing this trend with this year's involvement with  
Kelly Moss, and I'm afraid World Challenge isn't going to be the cakewalk  
that Supercar was.

One the other hand, the Larbre Sport Porsche 911 Turbo (last year's  
factory Le Mans car) just won a four-hour race at Paul Ricard, in France,  
with four 3.8 RSRs right behind, so, combined with their performance at  
Daytona, they are obviously dominating International GT racing so far.

Le Mans should be interesting.

Subject: Re: 911 Weber conversion

Since I've been having a sprited discussion off-line with a couple of
people who's opinions I respect, maybe I need to jump back in here...

First off, carbs are just terrible for daily use, ease-of-maintenece,
emissions, etc. But if you *LIKE* to fiddle with them, hey, it's your
life...

Second, carb conversions for 911s have been very popular for a LONG time.
The best guys in the biz are PMO, who sell at very good prices and give
very good support. Expect to spend about $1500-1800 to convert your
late model Carrera, just in carb and plumbing costs. (*DON'T* forget a
pressure regulator in the 5-8 psi range!!!)

Third, my comment about "carbs == no more perforance *if no other changes*"
seems to have been wildly mis-read. My experience, and the experience of
many, many other people is that you *MUST* change the exhaust to even
get it to run right if you go to carbs, *BUT* that just changing the
exhaust (even without changing to carbs) can give you a massive performance
boost -- in my belief, one of the reasons that people have this mystic
icon running around imprinted with "carbs mean more performance"!
So: in addition to the carbs, get an appropriate free flow exhaust setup
from SSI. Finest kind, boss. Expect to spend another $1500-2000, as you
will also have to do some oil line re-plumbing (comes with the kit if
you buy it that way). Unless they finally got their act together for the
new version that obviates that...(anyone know for sure on that? all I
have is rumors...)

Finally, depending on where you live, once you've done all this *YOU MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO REGISTER THE CAR FOR THE STREET*. Be *very* sure that you
live someplace that it's legal to swap out the induction system for your
car *BEFORE* spending the money. And double-check something else too: do
you live in an area under impending EPA interdiction as a problem area?
If so, it may be legal now but won't be in a couple of years...

Otherwise, good luck. I've spent *FAR* to many hours syncing carbs to
be enamoured of doing more (Honda CB-X, with 6 one-barrels; Ford SOHC
428 w/ 4 Weber two barrels; XKE w/ V-12; early B512...). But like  I
said, *THAT* part is up to you! 

Enjoy!

   ZWART/SIRCOMBE GIVE PORSCHE FIRST U.S. RALLY VICTORY IN

  TWO DECADES; OTHER TOP RACERS DNF ON FAST WASHINGTON ROADS



OLYMPIA, WASH. -- March 13 -- For the first time since PRO

Rally guru John Buffum won an event in 1977 in a 2.7-liter

Porsche 911, the German carmaker can claim victory in a U.S.

PRO Rally event.



Jeff Zwart, from Aspen, Colorado, with world rally co-driver

Tony Sircombe, from Newport Beach, Calif., drove their

Porsche Carrera 4 to a one minute, 31-seccond win at the Doo

Wop PRO Rally here, round #2 of the SCCA/Michelin PRO Rally

Series.



Zwart, who finished as high as second last season, drove a

flawless event this weekend, taking advantage of the absence

of his East Coast rivals - the Audi S-2 of Paul Choiniere and

the Ford Escort Cosworth of Carl Merrill.  Last month,

Choiniere and Merrill finished one-two in South Carolina when

Zwart did not make it to the event.



The other pre-event favorite, Henry Joy, from Wilmette, IL,

and his co-driver Jimmy Brandt, were sixth after Saturday's

stages because of a spin, and then blew their engine on

Sunday.  The Jamaican entry of Peter Moodie/Michael Fenwell

broke a transmission in their Mazda 323GTX yesterday, and

crashed today - also a DNF.



Other class winners included Dale Beard/Richard Simmons from

Elma, Wash., in a Mazda 323GTX (first in Production GT); Mike

Whitman/Kenvin Linville, from Farmington, MN, in a Datsun 510

(first in Group 2); and Rick Davis/Ben Greisler, from West

Chester, Penn., in a BMW M-3 (first in Group A).

No, no, no.  I mean, like when your father catches you smoking a butt

he doesn't really mean quite that.  He knows perfectly well what you're

Huh?  What?  You mean they cannot make money or break even by cloning
engines and so amortizing the cost of their development?  Why isn't
this a "concern" to the other teams you list?  It is, they all have
budgets, and they do buy and sell technology.  They also buy systems
from specialist suppliers, like gearbox components.

There are a lot of people who disagree with this, Bernie and Max
numbering high in that company, for better or worse.  No one likes a race
which is a foregone conclusion.  I mean, just how much excitement did
the Gurney Eagles really generate in the last season of IMSA GTP?  I
don't even think Toyota had that much fun.

>>Ferrari does it (Formula One) with their sales base.<
>No, with FIAT money, which may not last forever.

And Porsche is wonderfully positioned to form alliances with outfits
like Audi, VW, or Mercedes, always has been.  No one goes it 100% alone.
Except Porsche.

You have been brainwashed.  The Boxster is a meaningless design exercise,
sold to the world, in the person of automotive journalists looped out of
their mind on shrimp cocktail sauce, without an engine, drivetrain, or
anything other than a shell and and throw-away interior.  And it's a
cabriolet!  Do the words "roll stiffness" suggest anything?

Nope, the Boxster is the epitomy (better yet: nadir) of the boutique-
ification of Porsche.  As they did with the 911 Speedster, last year's
America[s] Roadster, all the US "Club Sport" cars (take stuff out, charge
customers more, the fools!), and so forth.  These are not sportcars,
these are bimbo-mobiles.

From: Hubert Lai <70363.1332@CompuServe.COM>
Subject: Summary of Car & Driver Article

Here is a message which I picked up on CompuServe and which I thought other
Porschphiles would be interested in reading.  It is basically a summary/review
of the recent comparison article on radar detectors in the April issue of Car &
Driver.

- --- begin ---

I haven't seen an *accurate* report of this latest comparo report here yet, so I
will try to do it for everyone.  You should know up front that I have owned a
Valentine 1 for over a year now.  I'll try to be as objective as possible and
keep my editorial comments to a minimum.

The new article appears in the new April 1994 issue of Car & Driver (with the
Olds Aurora on the cover).

Compared in the article are the BEL 645STi, the Cobra RDL-512SW, the Escort
Passport 4500, the Uniden LRD 9000W-1 and the Valentine One With Laser Warning.

I'll tell you right up front that the Valentine One was the winner with 89 of
100 points.  The nearest box came in at 62 of 100.  Let me describe each of the
testing areas:

False Alarms:  Looks like the Bel is the winner here, when looking at the
falsing when "not filtered".  This category is full of trade offs between
sensitivity and selectivity.  Most falsing is "X" falsing.  The Escort seems to
offer dangerous filtering levels.

BEE 36 Range (Ka):  Bel wins again here.  The Bel clearly is the best here with
an average 1.3 miles warning for steady-state or instant-on Ka (instant on is
most likely).  The Valentine comes is a lowly LAST place with a truly poor
showing for a $400 unit.  Although supposedly adequate, the Valentine offers
about a half mile of warning.

Photo Radar:  IMHO this category is the least meaningful.  Cobra wins here with
a .23 mile warning.  The Bel is a nice second with .22 and the Valentine is
third with .16.

VG-2 Range:  For those running in "stealth" mode, this is important.  The
Valentine wins here with a distance that is very small.  In what I would call a
tie, the Bel also offers superior rejection of the VG-2 with a rating almost
identical to the Valentine.

X-Band:  Valentine simply wins this one outright.  It won the steady-state
portion, but is weakest there with a .4 mile warning in most filtered mode.
Outrageous 1.5 mile range can be had with instant-on X-band (which I have never
run across).  The Bel came in a surprising last place here.  Average range for
the Bel was .3 miles.

K-Band:  This is the most important band to me (outside of LIDAR).  In New York
State, when have a constant barbeque of K-Band shooters.  The Valentine
completely destroyed the competition in this area.  Very surprising.  An average
of 1.3 miles warning in ANY mode (keep in mind that most units never filter the
K-band, except the Uniden unit).  Next best unit was the Bel with a .4 mile
warning range.  Some would say the .4 miles is adequate, and I probably wouldn't
disagree.

Laser Field of View:  Bel wins here with superior field of view.  This means
that the Bel can detect laser that is 168 degrees off axis when stationary and
85 degrees off axis when moving.  Second place went to the Valentine with 154
and 78 degrees respectively.

Laser Sensitivity:  Car & Driver has modified the laser tests this time.  It
seems that all units can detect a straight-aimed beam from 1,000's of feet away.
The key, in their opinion, is how far to the side from the beam is detectable.
This would indicate the ability to pick up a "stray" laser beam of sorts.  The
winner here was the Valentine.  The Valentine was able to detect a laser beam in
a 20 ft. wide area.  The Uniden was next being able to detect at 17.5 feet.  The
Bel was thrid with 17.3 feet.  IMHO none of these units is able to offer any
type of "carefree" protection from LIDAR.  Also of note, Valentine has not
delivered a "breakthrough" on LIDAR, just an incremental improvement.  You
should know that the Valentine only detects from the front.  A new Bel unit that
has just been released, can detect front and rear (Bel 645STi Plus).

Radar Sensitivity:  Valentine wins with 39 of 50 points.  Bel is second with 29.

Laser Sensitivity:  Valentine wins with 10 of 10 points.  Uniden is second with
9.

Ergonomics and Features:  Valentine wins with 20 of 20.  Passport is second with
16.  Bel continues to get "slammed" with a rating of 12.

Selectivity:  Valentine wins with 15 of 15 (probably due to the Logic modes on
the unit, the balance of range and falsing, etc.).  Bel is second with 11.

Sound Level:  Valentine is tied for first with 5 of 5 (avg. dBA of 80) along
with the Cobra (avg. dBA of 81).  I don't know why they didn't give the VAL1 a 4
of 5?  Bel comes in low with 2 of 5 (avg. dBA of 72).  I can tell you that I
require a loud warning to get over my $2,000 stereo.  I have used units that
could not break through the music in my car.

Overall, it is obvious that C&D is in love with Valentine.  I feel this probably
"colors" their opinions, but the unit certainly is deserving of a top rating
(I'm not so sure by the margin declared).  The Bel is a good second.  I feel
that the ergonomics of the Bel are *so* poor, that it sort of pisses-off C&D.
If Bel could only put together a better package, there would be better
competition.  Finally C&D declares that the suction bracket for the VAL1 is junk
(which many of us knew).  I suspect that the unit still has no memory for the
last mode you were in, and this is a huge continuing annoyance.  The indicator
arrows on the VAL1 are probably the best feature on the unit IMHO.  Most folks
who haven't tried it say they are just "toys".  C&D agrees with me that they are
a significant advantage.  The VAL1 is one of the highest quality products of any
type I have ever owned.  

Bel gets particularly bad marks for general design of the "box".  C&D doesn't
like the display, the audible warnings or the mounting hardware.  Great hardware
looking for a neet box to envelope it.

C&D always advocates the best unit you can buy, and this article is no
exception.  All you get from C&D is sarcasm if you want to go ahead and buy the
cheaper units in the test (Escort, Cobra, Uniden).

    On the subject of paints and helmets-

    Last summer I decided I was going to paint my helmet (it is a
    Bell Vetter [I think]).  I looked through the little manual that
    came with it, and as I recall, it said that a light sanding and a
    quality paint was all that was needed.  At least Bell thinks their
    product can withstand a good painting.  Next time I come across
    the manual, I'll confirm this info.

Hi group,

I'm having a problem with the Blaupunkt CD in my '91 C2. About 
six months after buying the car (new) the unit would go dead. 
There was still power because the display would glow 
although nothing was displayed on it. If I removed the fuse and 
re-inserted it, I could then re-enter the security code and it 
would work fine. This would happen from time to time. The frequency 
increased and eventually, after about a month of this, the unit wouldn't 
respond. The dealer replaced the unit and I was happy again. 
Well this week it has all started again. Anyone heard of other 
units afflicted with this problem? I don't want to keep buying 
Blaupunkts every year or two.

        Great question.  You have, of course,  opened a hugh can of worms.  
I run Yokohoma A008's for
        Auto-x and periodic street use.  Although they are pretty much 
purpose built for auto-x.
        Their A509 might be a reasonable compromise.  If you want a hell of 
a deal on a really good tire the 
        Falken brand is excellent.  I run them on my street car. (90 Civic 
Si.)  Great price, super traction.
        Excellent wear.

Their departure was also around the time that Nissan GTP cars were
gaining the competative advantage over the 962. Porsche's pursuit of an
Indycar at the expense of the 962 was doing nothing to enhance their
image in the US.  The problems sorting out the engine and the decision to
move to a March chassis and the strong showing by the Nissan GTP did 
just the opposite.

Subject: In defense of webbers

I have webbers on my (once was a) carrera motor.  It's real happy, real
loud (maybe too loud) and, being a 3.4 ltr with lots of "happy" parts,
it says bye-bye to careras even with mass flow.

The carbs allow me to change things (exhaust, cams, driving shoes) and
adjust the motor accordingly.

An interesting side benefit:  If someone's tailgating, a simple pop
into third and lift of the glass turns thepaint on the front of their
car a charred black color, and gets them the hell away from you.

On the other hand, gas mileage is dramatically reduced (like it takes
less gas to tow my car to the track than to drive it!).  They have been
100% reliable for me though.  Even started all winter.

You just can't get the throttle response and race-car sound out of a
motronic system.  It's too well engineered!

    Oh, my.  More "Tire Wars" 8-)
    Andrew Toth's .sig says: "Speed costs money.  How fast you wanna go?"
You *can* use Yokohama A008RSII's on the street.  For a lot of money.
For a very short time.
    You can also put Falken tires on your baby, and they'll last quite a
while.
   That being said:
I like the Yokohama A509's on my 1.8L.  No sway bars, which your 73 2.0
should have, so you might want more tire.  I'm thinking of AVS-Interme-
diates for my 2.0 when I get tires for it.  IMHO, you need somewhat more
sticky tires when you have sway bars than when you don't.  (Definitely
some exceptions, no flames please! 8-)  The 509's seem to be on their way
to lasting more than 20K miles, which is a bit better than expected.
    You've heard a lot of people say a lot of things about tires on this
list:  A509s, AVS-I's A008's, Bridgestones, Comp T/A's, and others come
recommended by various people for various applications.  One that I re-
member was Stan (a long time ago) saying "Yoko AVS-I's.  The autocross
rain tire of champions," so I guess he likes/liked them.
    Widest tires that you can fit under stock fenders on stock rims are
205/60/15.  I chose to go down one step--my 509s are 195/55/15.  I liked
the smaller sidewall, and I was leery of possible rubbing, since the 1.8
had been lowered.  The car sticks well in the corners.  I'm disappointed
with the Falkens that came on my 2.0.  Longer-lasting, but I want more
fun factor!
    Don't know about alignment.  I went to a local Porsche and alignment
shop, and told them, "Hard street driving/mild autoX alignment, please!"
No problems.

The later models (85.5+) have a smaller steering wheel.  
Try one. I doubt you'll have the same problem.

This situation was improved (and solved, at least for my dimensions)

Wm. York writes:"I am currently considering an '88 911 coupe.  I have had the

inspected, and it looks pretty good, but I have one question: the car
makes a tinny sort of rattle sound when first engaging the clutch from
a full stop, especially if the revs are low.  Of course, I can't
pinpoint where the noise is coming from, it's just "down below"
somewhere.  The noise stops when the clutch is fully released and the
car is underway.  The owner claims that it has done this for the 60K
miles he has owned it, and the mechanic says he has heard '88-89 cars
make this kind of sound, (possibly due to a loose shift linkage?)
although this one is a bit more pronounced.

So, anyone else heard anything like this.  If my mechanic (Dieter at
D&M Motors in Palo Alto) isn't worried, should I be?"

I guess this would fit under the heading of "for what it's worth"  I just
bought an '88 911 (from some nice people in Sunnyvale, or your side of the
continent as a matter of fact) and it made that noise under exactly those
circumstances.  So you are not alone in experiencing the rattle.  I never
figured out what it was either.  I am having some reasonably serious
modifications made to the car at this time, so we'll see if the rattle goes
away.  If not, I'll have to get more assertive about chasing it down.  I'll be
interested to hear from others as well.

The Miata to the Boxster is like the RX-7 is to the 944S2 Turbo. Not

Sounds like time for a less impassioned reasoning of this question.

Lets examine a few attributes.  Mind you, I am not an expert on
either car and am a confirmed Porsche person.  I am not blind
or without the ability to see a good deal when I see one.

Beauty:  Personally I like the RX7.  Nothing wrong with the 944S2T,
but it is a bit dated.  Actually, after 11 years, its a lot dated.

Size:  If you want LARGE, the 944S2 is a definite winner.

Speed:  I'm sure there are figures that will show that 944S2T has
higher top end.  In an autocross, there is no comparison, the RX7
dominates.

Quality:  Don't know.  Did Porsche finally get the motor mounts
together?

Ease of Operation: 944S2T much better than the turbos began.  I am
led to believe that the RX7 is miles ahead of drivability.

Hauling stuff to the dump: Again, the 944S2T wins here.

Comfort: Both seem pretty comfy to me.

Resale:  The 944S2T seems to be winning here, but mainly because
the couldn't sell 'em when they were new.  

Cost of Operation:  My guess is the the RX7 will come out best here.

Porscheness: I'd have to pick the 944S2T here.

I guess the upshot of all this is to say that if Porsche manages to
produce a car competitive with Miata or RX7, they might be able to
stay in the mainstream car business.  If they continue to produce
so-so stuff at monstrously inflated prices, you can kiss them bye-bye.

I have the same type of problem with my '86 Benz which just started about 2

I've tried to clean the contacts but it didn't seem to help on the suspecting

Amazingly, the thing works.  My significant other gave me one for Christmas.  At
first, I thought "Oh yeah, sure..."  It's made by Gunston in England, but I've
set the CO on my '72 mechanical injection 911 and then had a shop check it and
it's been within a half a percent of the reading.  It's not sturdy (made out of
plastic) and requires recalibration a lot, but it works in setting the idle
adjustment (CO only, no HC).  I put a longer exhaust hose on it and put it in
the passenger seat to check the CO under part load and part throttle and was
able to set my midrange CO too.  Whitney actually has two models.  One that's a
hundred more is made out of metal, is digital, and includes engine analyzer
functions.  It ain't fancy, but it works, at least on mechanical injections
where the setttings don't have to be that exact.

Is this a well known deficiency of the model?  What have other

  *Thank-You* Barney!
  Actually, you got me to thinking again and i remembered reading in the
factory manuals about the 'friction washers' used in the parking brake
adjusting mechanism.  Friction washers are those gozover's used in old
style volkswagen jacks. They's used to adjust for pad wear similar to stars.
 Anyway, in my Haynes manual it talked about sticking pistons and parking
brake mechanism -and how to bust loose without dissasembly..
 So, I pumped the brakes with no pucks in place and plumped out the pistons
and then pressed them back in and twiddled the 'venting adjust' screw
and it came back to life!  Now my parking brake works like new with fresh
repco's.  And I replaced the plugs with nice stainless steel ones....
  *for next time*.

  There's a moral here:
  The factory manuals are *very* dry.. (no grease, oil or brake fluid anywur)
  From the perspective of repairing or dealing with the effects of age and
  use (in the extreme) there is NO help from that source.
  In that case, words of experience gleaned from a variety of sources
  like Porschephiles@tta.com or Upfixin Der Porsche, or your local,

My '84 944 came from the factory with the "sport wheel" option, which looks
to me like a 911 wheel (two horizontal bars with the rectangular horn pad
in the center between them, Porsche embossed across the pad).  This wheel
is mounted off center to give more leg clearance.  Seems like an odd thing
to do, but I don't notice the off-centeredness of it while driving.  It 
gives me
about an inch of leg clearance (I am 6 foot tall, 190 pounds; average stature,
I guess).

It is a bolt on option, and if in fact it is a 911 wheel, they are 
probably abundant and
could probably be gotten for a reasonable price from a dismantler.

I learned the hard way -- the expensive way!

None of these gizmos protect you from instant on, unless traffic is heavy
enough to generate enough hits ahead of you.

The final lesson was being tailed by a cruiser for a mile or two.  I was 
too busy speeding with my "false sense of security" to notice...

IMHO, if you are relying on these things to allow you to drive fast
with no regard for what is around that next bend, or around that bridge
embankment, or over the crest of that hill, perhaps you should consider
that maybe, just maybe, you are not driving carefully enough to begin
with!

Remember that all of these devices are line of sight.  Especially laser
devices, where the tax collector must be outside the vehicle pointing
something like a gun at you.

Ever since I STOPPED using my detector, I find that I haven't really 
slowed down, but I drive with much more awareness of what is around me.
I don't speed into blind corners, etc.  I guess time will tell...

I can't help but think that I am driving more safely now.

One of the best benefits is not hearing those damned false alarms!  My SO

Again, this is just IMHO.

The X1/9 driver whose exploits started this thread ranks on my
"stupid" scale very close to a perfect 10.  What earthly good could
come from spinning out a couple of novices at possibly their first
drivers school.  However, what earns him the near perfect 10 is coming
on this list to brag about his "skill"!

That said, however, let's look at the X1/9 a little more closely.
It seems to me to be a damn fine little race car. If not, how come the
little critters keep making it to the SCCA Runoffs year after year in GP
(3rd in 93) and FP (2nd in 93)?  Now I will admit that I have seen dung
doorstops that look better than X1/9s, but the Fiats do run rather well.

As to their weaknesses...the havoc wreaked on their engines when their
timing belts break is legendary.  Of course, the same is true about my
own 944.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade my 944 for a pair of
X1/9s.  It's just that they really are a pretty good little race car.

Now, as to the part about Italian women having great appearance,
handling well, but requiring exceptional amounts of maintenance, all I
can say is that, having received presumably proper maintenance, Sophia
Loren looks damn fine to me!!!!!

Denigratingly (of stupid drivers),
Supportively (of ugly little Italian doorstops),
Admiringly (of beautiful Italian women),

The pot. is probably a carbon type, and they're known to get noisy with 
age.  It's not always "crud" making the noise, it's the imperfect mate 
between the wiper and the carbon surface.  The things just wear out.

You can try spraying contact cleaner (Freon or green equivalent), or 
replace the pot.

Sometimes rotating the knob rapidly back and forth will temporarily

I have an '87 944S with the embedded antenna and have no problem
pulling in stations 60+ miles away CLEARLY.  The Blaupunkt had been
replaced with a Panasonic unit prior to my purchasing the vehicle.
Could be the radio? Is the antenna cable connected behind the dash?
Could be other reasons you cant lock onto a station.

Regarding noise with volume control, the original explanation of crud
in the potentiometer is correct.  Go to Radio Shack and get a bottle of
their lubricating "tuner" cleaner.  You will have to pull out the radio,
and you may have to remove its face plate to get a good shot at the
potentiometer.

Regarding lousy reception in a 944S with windshield antenna, sort of
true.  Yes, the reception sucks and a normal antenna was apparently
an available option.  However, I can scan all sorts of stations, even
the weaker-signalled college stations my perverse mind favours, with
the windshield antenna.

Check the antenna connection at the windshield and back of the radio,
check the antenna amplifier under the dash and above the passenger
footwell.

BTW, I'm curious to know who's selling a 944S in the Boston area.

Subject: Service Outage Warning....

Guys and Gals:

There are some serious changes afoot, and things being as they
are, they're not likely to go smoothly...

Over the next two weeks, my network service provider for "tta.com" is
uprooting his whole business, re-attaching to the Internet via
a different channel, and moving cross town. In the meantime, the
"real" network connection for netsmiths.com is going on line. 
And while all this is happening, I'm going to be out of town.

Oh joy.

The original plan was that the NetSmiths connection would be up
*first*, I'd take the porschephiles host at tta.com off-line for 
a day to ship it to NJ, juggle the net databases, and we'd be no
worse for the wear. However, with my current service provider moving
at the same time, *AND* me being at a trade show in San Fran that
week, I'm not sure how things are going to work out.

Odds are, nothing will happen. Or at least, nothing that you can 
*SEE*. As long as nothing gets moved/unplugged/etc in Houston 
until after the 27th (when I show up for a few days), we're fine.
And then I can evaluate how to proceed. If Netcom/WilTel/NJBell
move their collective tails as is supposed to happen, the net will be
up in NJ and I can just proceed by the original plan (but I'm taking 
the fact that NJ Bell blew their "install by" date and Netcom
hasn't shipped my router yet as an omen...). If not, then
I can make arrangements to do *something* in Houston for a short
time.

But, since I'm starting to get pre-occupied with other things, I
wanted you to know what was going on in case the worst happens, and 
you stop getting 'philes for a couple of days and mail to me bounces...

I guess I need to wish *YOU* luck for a change!

 Howdy,
 
Today, I'll like to share with you the result of one of those magic
moments,.....when you actually can say 'EUREKA'.

As you've maybe noticed I have in my possesion different
curved,straight and bent panels. Put these together and 'voila'
there's a car.That's good!

And when yours truly had to replace two small,but not unsignificant,
parts on this car there was a problem.Well,...let's make it a bit more
difficult, we'll even add a new K-member (boomerang,...diagonal
member).Frame struts and K-member.
So what?

Cut'em off,weld in new pieces.......?

Perhaps I overdid it, but I did want to keep my 2100 mm wheelbase
even after the repairs were done.

I thought about this for a while, as I replaced
longitudinals,etc....no,I just couldn't get it.A complete chassis
jig??? No,... too much work.

Then it struck me,...looking at chassi drawings,pictures.....!

Here's my idea;
I bought 4 meters of tubing,and 4 meters of square metal.

Some of the tubing(2m) has to have the same *outer* diameter as the
*inner* diameter of the front torsion tube,the other 2m need either to fit the
cover of the rear torsion bar,or have the same *outer* diameter as the
*inner* of the tube.
If one chooses to use a tube to fit *into* the torsion tube, one has to
remove the rear suspension! (most precise)
Else,remove the covers,and make a sturdy plate(adapter) with a tube on it,to
fit where the cover was.

fig:                        seen from above

                          
                         square metal  (ca 2 m for each side)
         |====================================================|
         | |                                                | |
         | |                                                | |
         | |                                                | |
    This  side will go over the                             | |
    rear torsion tube cover *OR*                            | |
   into torsion tube.(different diameters)             
                                                   This side will slip
                                                into the front torsion tube
   

the adapter
rear bar :     ____
              |    |
              |    |  
           ___|    |____
         /_____________/
drill 4 holes to fit (use torsion bar cover to measure)



If you've been precise,you'll have two legs which can be reused and will
keep your car straight under repair.

You could also want to make a stabilizing bar in the front.
Just weld from the square metal to the chassi somewhere.....!

Hope you got it and can use it sometime,...It worked for me!

PS: Perhaps I can use these to mount to the rotisserie I'm welding?!

When you don't want to buy it......*make it*!!!

cheers,

PS2: Excuse for the simple drawings,but you're just able to do *that*

I have some Designer4.0 drawings that are *perfect*,I could mail a copy

I was at the Geneva Autoshow last weekend and there were also three
cabriolets there (metallic black, metallic silver and metallic green).
They all appeared to be production cars, at least as far as fit and
finish was concerned.

I took the plunge and ordered a cabriolet, should come out of the May
production and be delivered sometime early in June.

My dealer also recently showed me some photos of the new turbo coming
next year.  It's biturbo, 4WD (same system as C4, not the 959), but
looks from the rear *very* much like a 959, spoiler and all.

He's apparently not supposed to show these things to customers, but
at that point I was sitting on the fence between buying an M3
convertible or a 911 convertible (actually, I really wanted the 911
but I was trying to get him to come down in price a little more).  So
I think he only showed me the turbo stuff to convince me Porsche was
really involved in more than just the 993 and boxster.
>
>I have heard the motor or should I say I could have heard the motor,

Oh no!  I hope that's not true!  I've not driven a 993 cabriolet, just
the coupe.  But hydraulic valve lifters not withstanding, the
coupe still had the lovely boxer growl.  I *want* to hear that noise,
especially in a convertible.

BTW, the M3 is a very impressive car. If I bought cars entirely with
my head I'd have taken the M3, because for substantially less money it
offers very similar performance and would actually be a practical car
to go shopping in as well.  It can even fit four people in relative
comfort.  But emotion also plays a part in buying cars, and I've got
too much of a soft spot for the 911.

Now the only problem I have is that my insurance company wants me to
sign a form saying I won't drive the 993 into Italy.  Sigh.  There go
my chances of being chased by Fiat X1/9 drivers.

Cheers

I have never seen an S2Turbo, since as far as I know they were never

  That stuff is ok for contacts like those in an old TV set tuner, but
a better product is 'Blue Stuff'.  It can be had at some TV repair
shops or suppliers to the shops.
  
  But spraying any kind of goo into a pot is not good.  Potentiometers
function on a carbon track with a wiper that drags across the semiconductive
to form a changing resistance.  Putting goo on that is not a good idea
because there is always some kind of undesirable residue that upsets
the physics of the pot.

  In your case, the pot is probably worn from use rather than contamination.
  The wear-to-fail mode is like this:  The wiper attached to the knob you
turn is made of a tough copper alloy and the resistive element it drags
on is made of carbon compound similar to pencil lead and is softer than
the wiper.  After thousands of volume up-down-off-on cycles, the wiper
wears several tracks in the resistive element.  If the manufacturer of
the pot is making a quality product, the element is deposited thick
enough to withstand thousands of wear events.  If the pot is a cheapie
the material is thin and wears thru to the substrate in short order.
  When the element wears thru to the substrate, gaps occur in the 
semiconductor and cause the gaps and noise in the radio.

  Oddly enough, just giving the control a few full-turn cranks
 -at respectible vigor!  May smooth out the track inside the control
and give temporary relief.  But this is a symptom of extreme wear
and the part must ultimatly be replaced.
  Sorry, but you are probably better off getting another radio.

I recently bought the Blaupunkt Memphis to replace 
the standard Blaupunkt Monterey SQR 25 in my 944 '86.

After trying it in my car for a week, I returned 
the Blaupunkt Memphis. The reason: the reception was very
bad. Only the strongest FM stations could be caught by the scan.
There was no difference when different sensitivity levels were 
used. I could not catch a single AM station (not with the scan
nor manually). With my old Monterey, a lot of stations can be received.

       Monterey     Memphis

AM:    8 stations   0 stations

I have been told by several car radio salespersons that the AM circuitry
on the radio is of very pour quality, and the Blaupunkt quality is
consistently going down.

The Monterey is made in Germany. The Memphis is made in Indonesia.
So the workmanship is not what it used to be either.

Buyer beware! Andre Rotchel.

WAIT!!!!

This is a common problem with the later 944s.  When the radio is
replaced, the installer almost NEVER reconnects the power source for
the window antenna.  It's a thin black wire that runs along side the
coaxial antennna lead.  It sould be connected to a 12 volt source.

Subject: Audi/Porsche


I don't know if the new Porsche prepared Audi is available
in the US or not, but in the UK you can now get the Audi Quattro, 
with a Porsche prepared engine, suspension, brakes
and wheels. Porsche at Zuffenhausen (sp?) take the Audis
and stick all the go fast bit on them. This rather bizzare concept 
is an official Audi product and is a mix of sports car performance
and estate car funcionality. It looks rather odd since it sits on 17 inch
Carrera Cup style wheels, and has the massive Porsche brakes and red 
calipers (from the 911 Turbo by the look of them).
 
I am told that it is quite quick, ie 0-62 in the sub six second area if I 
remember rightly.

For the price (40000 GBP) you could of course get an excellent 911,
but on the other hand I expect that one might have difficulty in getting
the brats, a couple of large dogs and all the ephemera of the estate car
class in the back of a 911. Personally I would rather spend 5000 on a
crap second user estate from Ford and 35000 on a 72 Carrera RS.

I beleive Eric may have the correct diagnosis here.  I've been running
225/50R15s for over 5 years on my '86 944 with -2.5 degrees camber and there
is lots of room between the inside of the tire and the spring.

Dear P-files Friends:

	Has any one of you removed and replaced a windshield on a 911. I have
a rock chip in my field of view and I was wondering if it is worth it to try to
do it myself or if it is best left to a reputable body shop. 

I'm hesitant to take it to a regular glass shop since they once butchered my GTI

I'm doing (maybe?) this on an '84 Targa. Will I need a new windshield gasket?

Is this a one person job? Or will I have to bribe some friends?? :)

Also, Haynes manual says something about adding some adhesive to both the
windshield and the gasket. Thoughts?

Your comments are (will) be really appreciated!

Subject: Suspension Ramblings

Guten Tag!!

I don't intend to unnecessarily waste bandwidth on this
subject, but I have some questions.  My '76 911, in its
stock form exhibited alot of body roll and also displayed
moderate understeer when pushed to the limit at a driving
school last fall.  To remedy these problems, I have replaced
the stock torsion bars in the rear with 24.1mm SC bars and
added an 18mm anti-roll bar in the rear(it didn't have one
stock).  I am also in the process of replacing the 16mm front
anti-roll bar with a 20mm unit, but I haven't finished this
yet.  My question is basically - by increasing the roll 
stiffness in the rear (to reduce the car's understeering
habit) do I actually increase the tendency to oversteer and
thereby decrease the overall handling capabilities of the car?
Or does increasing the roll stiffness actually limit the
amount of weight transfer to the outside tire, allowing
higher cornering loads?  My goal was to decrease the body
roll and "balance" the understeer/oversteer, but have I
created a monster?

I apologize for the ramblings on this - I spend entirely
too much time thinking about this stuff.

Any responses would be appreciated.
Thanks!!

Happy St. Patrick's Day to everyone!

With all this talk about JC Whitney, I have to throw in my $.02 worth.  My 
family and I have had an interesting experience with them over about the 
last 20 years.  The saying "You get what you pay for" just doesn't apply to 
JC Whitney.  You always get more than what you pay for in terms of the 
thrill and excitement of dealing with them.  Don't get me wrong - they have 
some top quality stuff, quite a bit of it being OEM or the brands we pay 
megabucks for from our other suppliers.  Problem is, it's like rolling the 
dice when you stick that 10% discount sticker (They don't do that anymore, 
do they?) on the order form and send it in.  I've gotten names like FAG, 
Timken, Sachs, Girling, Bosch, Vanderwell, Laycock, Bentley, Sway Away, and 
a ton of stuff with VW Audi stamps in them.  On the other hand, I've gotten 
a s%*tload of stuff that wasn't even sealed, including engine bearings (They 
were wrapped in newspaper!  I still have them after almost 15 years.).  I 
could also fill a few crates with junk I never ordered that happened to fall 
in before my package was taped up.  (Can I interest anyone in one of five 
gadgets that automatically turn off the AC when you need more power?)  My 
point is, if you've got the time to wait around for them to fill your order 
and you're not the type to go into deep depression if you're disappointed, 
JC Whitney may be for you.  They certainly can be entertaining.  So if you 
feel lucky, sometimes you can hit the jackpot.

Sorry if I offended anyone with my waste of bandwith.  By the way, I'm 5' 9"

Subject:      Cooling fan relays (924/944)

I know it's a bit early for those of us up here in the frozen wasteland
to even think about the airconditioning system, however...
Some time ago, Gary Cook and I discovered the reason that *all* older
water pumpers have leaking air cond. systems, is a failed relay for the
a/c condenser/engine cooling fans. That is, when you turn on the a/c, it is
supposed to activate the cooling fan relay and lock both  fans on full speed.
When one of teh relays goes bad, then the fans are not at full on and the refri
gerant pressure goes to the moon usually blowing out at the receiver/drier.

Now according to the Stoddard catalogue, the cooling fan relay and the a/c
relay are different. The latter is more expensive. In the schematics,
(Haynes manual), the relays appear to be the same, and in my car, both relays
are identical. Finally, my question(s)(?)...
Is the new relay info in the catalogue due to Porsche adding a new improved
more expensive version of the relay? Or did the terrible former owner just
stick any old relay in to the hole so that I would think the a/c *could*
work?  :-)

I think the relay layout in my '81 $$931$$ is the same as the early 944's:

In the upper row of relays on the main panel, there are six spots. Starting
from the upper left, number one is the cooling fan relay, number two is
the fuel pump relay and the third is the a/c relay. Currently, the first and
third relays are identical. Should they be the same?

    I don't think that there's anything about the 914 which is in-

turbo to die on you.  Age and improper maintenance can turn a 914

Apologies for continuing this here--lost his address, and he

[continues from previous post:]
  From an engineering standpoint, it's
just plain ugly.  And you have to cut holes in your poor little
car.  (Where's the radiator go?)  And it's *heavy*!  The car was
not originally designed to carry that much weight.  If you want
it done right, then you get into a whole *lot* of modifications.
Such as: chassis stiffening, higher spring rates, bigger brakes
(you have to stop it, too, and it's heavier and faster!) wider
tires (which means flares) and on and on...  Not to mention the
gamble that you take that the cooling/plubming/etc. in the con-
version job has been designed well or poorly.  And maybe the
tranny will hold up to it, or maybe not.
    The "better" solution seems to be putting a 911 engine in.
After all, the car was designed to use one as well as the Type 4
VW engine.  It's *not* trivial, but it gets rid of some of the
worries of the water-cooled, heavy V-8.  It can be *very* light.
But it ain't cheap, especially to do it right.
    Or, depending on what kind of smog-inspectors you know, you
may be able to build a 125+ hp Type 4.  Not as much power, but 
still pretty decent.

etc.)  Which style transmission--side-shift or tail-shift?
Sloppy shifter linkage.  Leaks--fuel, oil, tranny oil.  Smoke.
Saggy springs.  "Bump steer."  Upgrades; e.g. re-located fuel
pump, tail-shift upgraded to side-shift, late-style window cranks,
hydraulic lifters, CD ignition.....  Dashboard cracks, seat holes.
Non-functional odometer, speedo/odometer that's been opened up,
non-original speedo.  Records, records, records.

Subject: Dual outlet exhaust(s)

A couple of weeks ago I asked the net for info on 911 dual outlet
mufflers. My thanks to all who replied. It was suggested I share my
findings. Here goes:
1. Dual inlet/dual outlet mufflers are available from a wide variety of
sources, including, as Bob Mohan suggested, AJ, AASE, B

&B fab, Tweeks etc. Indeed, it appears exhaust comes out of both sides
of these vendor's offerings, at about $500 a side ($1,000 that is).
2. Dual inlet/dual outlet mufflers are also "custom" built" by firms
such as Kurt Pressler (510-684-9437). Kurt charges $600 for a stainless
steel conversion, and you provide the muffler, plus shipping. He splits
the muffler like a sardine can and goes from there. Improvement advertised
is on the 5-8 hp range, with dbs in the 90s????
Kurt also modifies stock steel mufflers at a slightly lower price.
3. Triad (602-943-6501), like Kurt, advertises in Pano (p. 100 Mar 9at $280
and Triad supplies the muffler. I found this ad after the fact.
4. The wisdom of the net suggested John Daniels of SSI. I dealt with Diane.
While SSI is not in the muffler business, for SSI users, they provide a
stainless muffler (Leistritz 59 1 0739, a replacement for 911 111 025 01,
according to the sticker on the Schalldaempfer). SSI in turn recommended
Rob King (415-485-6026) who modifies mufflers for $200. I went with this
combination, also getting chrome tips and gaskets from Rob King/SSI, for
an extra $50. For about $660, including UPS charges, I have a dual inlet,
dual outlet stainless steel system on my 1978 199SC.

Installation was not difficult, once you get past the I'm going to cut
a chunk out of a Porsche (my Porsche that is). I used a sabre saw with a
metal cutting blade, after having laid out the cut with a tape measure
and majic market. It cut like butter. I then triple primed the cut with
self etching primer and left it for now. (I'm obviously talking about
the right side.)

Is there a noticable difference? It's a little louder that the modified
single outler muffler it replaced. Seat of the pants indicates it has
what seems to me more guts at the low end, and more pull at the high end.
Since the car hasn't been timed etc., this is the best empirical evidence
I have (Sorry!)

Since my main desire was a dual look, I'm a happy camper. Bottom line
its going to cost between $300 for a nonstainless steel model, to over
a $1000 for a pedigree stainless steel model.

Cheers,
Hank

You might consider having the ding repaired rather than replacing
the windshield.  I've never had it done myself, but I regularly see
advertisements from outfits like Novus who do this sort of repair
(with a clear epoxy, I belive).  I understand that many insurance
companies will even cover this sort of repair, without deductable,
under their full coverage contracts.  May be worth looking into...
(egads, a pun!)

If the windsheild did need replacement, most insurance will
cover that also (but with a deductable).

(summer only), no racing or concours.  What I need is something RELIABLE, no
rust, non-smoker, in good mechanical working order, as low mileage as
possible, minor cosmetic problems are OK, and somewhere in the 12-15K price
range.  As I live in Maine, I need someone who is patient, willing to deal
long distance, and provide me with the necessary information so I can sleep
at night (photos, pre sale inspection, etc.)  I'd also prefer an east coast
car, but would consider traveling to the West for the right deal. 
Please...only good, honest people need reply!!!!

after reading John Goodman's account of J.C.Whitney, I
had to continue the tail.  Over my 30 years of car
ownership and breakage I have used JCW a lot.
Sometimes you get what you order, and sometimes the
parts even work.  But the thrill of waiting a month for
parts to arrive cannot be equaled.  I never did order
the "fire injector" spark plugs or "engine overhaul" in
a can.  Lokks like they have bee replaced by Slick 50,
Duralube, and those sparkplugs with the forked tips that
defy electrical theory.


High points...

In my youth, about 1965, I first got involved with
J.C.Whitney, I had, or I should say my dad had and I
drove a 1960 Peugot 403, On one High RPMrun it ate a
timing chain and sucked a couple of valves.  Needed two
valves and a Piston.  Peugot parts are hard to find in
Salt Lake City So enter J.C.Whitney and Co.  first
order Backordered on the required piston, second order
got a set of 4 pistons for a Peugot 404 and charged for
the one 403 pistion, not the single piston for the
403.  finaly got the piston, still have the 404 pistons
somewhere.


Rebuilt the T-10 4 speed transmission in a fairlane I
owned, had to replace syncro's 3rd gear and bearings.
All worked well except the 3rd gear fused in the main
shaft locking the tranny in both 3rd and 4th gear, the
JCW part being the weaker of the two had all the teeth
striped off.  Nice Smooth shifting 3 speed after that
just a big jump between 2nd and 3rd.

placed an order with them in the 70's 3 days before
they declared bankrupcy.  never saw the order or the
money after that.  they re-issued catalogs as
"Warsawsky and Co." for a while.  Soon they were back
under the name of J.C.Whitney"

I still place orders, have had good luck with VW Bug
parts, I Too love the excitement.

Subject: Foaming Battery

While performing some routine maintenance on my P-car last month I added a wee
bit of distilled water to the battery since the level had fallen below the 
tabs (not the plates) which I assume are used to indicated the appropriate
level of fill.  Drove about for a week or so with no apparent problems, and 
then one afternoon, while working in the garage, noted a stream of foaming
liquid emanating from the battery overflow tube onto the pavement. The car had
been sitting for several days and, of course, the fluid did a nice etching job
on the garage floor.  Since, in my ignorance, this appeared to be a relatively
benign occurance, and nothing seemed to be damaged I passed it off as due to
slightly overfilling the battery the week before.

Well, yesterday morning I go to start up an get nothing.  I check the battery
and the fluid level looks fine.  I jump start and take a twenty mile spin,
shut down, try to restart and get only a click.  Everything else electrical
seems ok.  This morning she's completely dead again.

Why did the battery foam up in the first place, I DID use distilled water?
Seem's to me whatever the cause, the battery is now dead, I mean REALLY dead, 
and recharging is futile. Then again, maybe twenty miles wasn't sufficient
to produce and adequate and sustainable recharge???  The voltmeter still
didn't look too happy when I shut down.  Should I just fork out for a new
battery and be done with it, or is this cell (Porsche battery, two years old)
still salvagable?

My car came with a Blaupunkt Monterey radio and not only do I

aeronautical non-directional beacons (NDBs). I've heard NDBs

Hi, Trond.
 
Good advice on your jig for making sure the wheelbase doesn't get any
longer. If you get the video "Made by Hand" you'll see Porsche had similar
jigs to hold the stuff together while welding the chassis together.
 
Regarding the rotisserie, I think somebody posted a sketch showing the axis
of the rotisserie as 80 cm above the floor. I measured ours, and it needs to
be higher than that. Ours is 42 inches (call it 107 cm) from the floor to
the axis, and the roof just barely clears the floor. Our rotisserie has four
arms that go straight in to bolt onto the pickup points for the bumper
brackets. Yes, I know the bumper brackets are not straight, so the owner of
the car took tin snips to the body to cut slots and temporarily bend away
the outer sheet metal. (I told him not to...)  The car is a 1958 T2 coupe.

I used to have a 944 with retractable outside antenna. I had very  good

Before acting on the inference, though, I asked around and was told by
knowledgable people that windshield antennas are just fine, so I replaced the
built-in bottom of the line Blaupunkt (no longer made in Germany, btw) with a
top-quality aftermarket radio.

Presto! Terrific reception.

Checking my math, I made a mistake, forgot to divide my answer by 9.8
m/sec**2, the acceleration of gravity.
(missed seeing that factor in the equation). I'll do the calculation in US
units, and correct the mistake in the metric.
 
The correct equation should have been F = G**2/(g*r)
 
By way of explanation to folks not used to metric, kiloponds (ponds, not
pounds) are just kilograms force. One kilogram of mass exerts a force of
one kilopond on a scale under one standard gravity.
 
Rather than derive all this stuff (easy enough, but that's what handbooks
are for) I looked up the formula in the Bosch Automotive Handbook. And of
course copied it wrong. Kiloponds
are, I think, no longer an ISO-approved unit, but the answer still comes out
right. I couldn't find my newer edition, and the old one uses kiloponds.
(Later) here's my 19th edition. Under units and definitions, it says (in
German) "Do not use any longer: kiloponds. 1 kp = 9.80665 Newton = 2.204615
lbf. lbf is pounds force (same idea as kilopond), not pounds mass, to make
the distinction.
 
If you want to do it in English units:
18 grams = 0.0396 lbs; mass in English units is slugs, though, so we have to
convert; one slug is 32.2 lbs mass, or one lb-sec**2/ft;
so 0.0396 lbs. mass = 0.00123 slug.
 
The radius of the path of the center of mass of the blade is 85 mm, or 3.346
inches, or 0.27887 ft.
 
At 6000 rpm, the fan is turning 1.8 x 6000, or 10800 rpm.
Speed of the center of mass is 10800/60 * 2 pi * .27887 ft = 315 ft/sec =
215 mph, as we found in the earlier metric example. (At least that was
right).
 
Plugging and chugging, F = mv**2/r = .00123 x 315 ** 2 / 0.27887 = 438 lbs.
 
So the right answer should be not 1956 kiloponds force, but rather 1956/9.8
= 200 kiloponds force. A factor of ten difference. So the fan isn't that
highly stressed, and maybe they could get away with mild steel. The shear
stress on the tabs holding the blades would be about 1/10 of what I had
calculated.
 
Check: is 200 kilograms the same as 438 lbs? 438 x .454 = 199; close enough.
 
My apologies for the mistake. The fan still came apart though <g>.
 
Also one of our competitors in the slalom series says it's happened to him
too.
 
I understand that somebody has already developed a fix for the metal fans to
prevent this. Once I know more I'll post the details. That means I don't
need to lie awake thinking about Kevlar fans anymore, and can lie awake
thinking about other stuff.
 
Pete
 
I used metric units, because Trond is in Norway. Trond is an engineer, but
many readers aren't, so I used the colloquial term "centrifugal force",
although engineers and physicists know there is no such thing; it's a
fictitious force but useful for explaining things to laypeople.

Been there, done that.  As I recall, my AC relay was different than the 
cooling fan relay.  I no longer have the 931, but I have an AC relay with
a burnt-out terminal - part number 944 615 113 00.  No guarantees that
that's what was supposed to be there.

Well, the schematics from the shop manual offer a clue.  In the Model 79
AC schematic (there's no '80 or '81, so I'm presuming it carried over),
the cooling fan and the AC cooling fan each get power from separate 
contacts on the cooling fan relay.  The other side of both fan motors
are tied together, and pick up ground either through the temperature 
switch, or through _one_ contact of the AC relay.  So if your AC is
on but your coolant is, well, cool, then the A and B contacts of the
AC relay carry ~2X (~ since the fans are different sizes) of the current
through the A/B and 30/87 of the cooling fan relay.  It is contact A
that was destroyed on my AC relay.  That may be why two different relays
are spec'd.

The '82 schematic shows a new arrangement.  The low side of the fan motors
are no longer tied together; the AC cooling fan is tied directly to ground.
Unlike the cooling fan relay on the pre '82s (which is energized whenever
ignition [but not starter] is on), the '82 and up fan relay is energized
only when the AC relay is on.  So instead of both fans drawing through
A/B of the AC relay, only one fan plus the fan relay coil draws current.

I've misplaced the schematics to my '87 924S, so I can't comment on how 
that circuit compares.

According to my owners manual, those three relays are in the same location.
I checked my relay panel; the fan relay is 944 615 113 01.  The AC relay is 
much smaller, as I seem to recall my 931's fan relay was.  As to why 
these are swapped between the 931 and 924S, I can only guess...  It 
definitely appears that they are different, though.

>Subject: 944S and radio reception

  Say Gang, All this talk about radios and preamps but no one has said
  anything about the trimmer adjustment most radios have.
   Read the instructions with the radio and it will tell you how to
  tweek the trimmer for maximum reception.  The most difficult part is
  finding the thing.  Often it is buried at the back of the radio because
  that is where the antenna lead comes in.  Usually the trimmer cap is
  located behind one of the front panel control knobs, or inside the
  cassette transport.  These are used to match the vehicle antenna's
  electrical character to the radio's input.
  
  Generic adjustment procedure:
  Locate trimmer, it could look like a rectangular whatzit with a small
  cheesehead screw.
  Tune radio to weak station at low end of FM band. (I think, FM)
  Using a plastic or non-conductive screwdriver, adjust the trimmer
  right or left to make station come in stronger.
  Tune radio to station at high end of band and readjust for same parameter.

My 1985/2 944 has an embedded antenna. The original Blaupunkt had lousy FM

Guten Tag!!

My 76 911 has recently decided not to want to start
when warm after sitting for an hour or so.  It starts
OK cold and starts great when warm if it has been less
than 30 minutes or since being shut off.  When this 
problem manifests itself, the thing will eventually start,
but it takes about 30 seconds of repeated cranking.
(It acts like it's not getting any fuel).  I hesitate
to say vapor lock, as it does finally start.  My fuel
pump is located near the left rear tire, although I 
thought they were moved forward in '76.  I also thought
about the check valve in the fuel pump going bad, but
I have yet to check this as the fuel pump only has about
8000 miles on it (previous owner replaced it).  Car has
had recent points,plugs,cap,rotor, valve adjustment,
CO mixture adjustment, blah blah blah.

Any ideas?

Don't be so quick to trash the radio.  The Antenna normally has to be tuned

I used to have a 944 with retractable outside antenna. I had very  good
reception. Then I got a 944S2 with windshield antenna and got very bad
reception. I drew the obvious inference: Outside good; windshield bad.

Before acting on the inference, though, I asked around and was told by
knowledgable people that windshield antennas are just fine, so I replaced 
the
built-in bottom of the line Blaupunkt (no longer made in Germany, btw) with 
a
top-quality aftermarket radio.

Presto! Terrific reception.

Morale: cherchez la lousy radio, not the antenna. (Assuming that the wires
are all connected, as advised by someone yesterday.)

Non Porsche related, so can it if you wish -

Eons ago in a land far away (or at least farther West) I
worked at a military museum while in high school. There
were two WWII jeeps, neither one of which were running, one
olive drab and one general's jeep in black and chrome. I
badgered the director (probably hourly) to let me fix up
the general's jeep (I think Eisenhower's parade jeep). 
He finally let me tackle the olive drab one with the promise 
that if it ran well, I could do the other one.

Armed with my trusty J.C. Whitney catalog, an Army Field Manual
and the infinite knowledge of a 16 year old, I rebuilt my first
engine. The jeep was missing a radiator petcock and the J.C.W.
catalog listed one for something like 59 cents - Amazing! When
the order arrived, there was no petcock, but I had an extra 1/2"
by 1" bolt. After a couple of phone calls, I found out that the
bolt was "an upgraded replacement" - Actually it worked great.

As for jeep #2 - well, jeep #1 never could go over 35 MPH and I
think the director was put off by my box of "spare nuts, bolts,
and washers" (if it works, ya didn't need em anyway)

If you're ever in West Suburban Chicago with some time to kill,
go to the Cantigny museum out by Wheaton if it's still there.
There's some interesting stuff, and if you ask them nicely, there
are *two* non-running jeeps in one of the out-buildings.

====================================================================
Mike, 

If I did not know better, I'd say this was me writing a message about tw years
ago!!!  In fact, your description is almost word for word, what I was
describing to my two local experts as well as Bruce Anderson who happens to be
in my region of PCA.  No one had a real answer for me.  I tried the tune up. 
No dice.  I next put a new check valve in the fuel pump.  No luck.

Next, a mechanic and I figured it was the fuel distributor with a blead down
problem.  I was going to buy the $400 part but then found a friend converting
to carbs so he sold me his enire injection system off the engine for $450.  I
managed to replace almost every part in the injection system and still I had
the problem.

Next, my mechanic played with the fuel lines and filters and found that when he
replaced the fuel accumulator, the problem was greatly reduced.  He said he had
never seen this part go bad but there's always a first.  Well, that was a big
improvement but it still was hard to start from time to time.

Finally, last summer, I had the engine in for new head studs replacement and my
mechanic found that the metal vacumn tube which is located out of view behind
the injection system (I don't remember where it goes but I think it is the only
3/4 inch metal tube back there) had a big hole worn in it!  He replaced that
and I've not had any starting problems at all since.

My car is a '78 SC 3.0l so I don't know how much of it is the same as your 76
2.7l.  I do know that I had the exact same problem and it is now solved.  I
hope the above information helps you in some way.  I truely know how annoying
and embarassing it is to have the starting problem.  I once had a Honda dealer

Foaming means you're overcharging the beejeebers out of one or more cells
in the battery.  In a battery with one bad cell, it is typically the
good cells which boil away while the one bad one does not.  You can fork
out a few bucks for a hygrometer with which to test each cell's specific
gravity.  It sounds like you had a badly sulfated battery which kept its
specific gravity up until you topped it off with distilled water.  Now
it cannot get it back.

If you look into a cell and see lots of crud floating around or wedged
in the plates, you're looking at a sulfated cell.

If, on the other hand, the hygrometer shows good and you have at least
12.6 volts across the battery when the car is shut off, the problem may
lie with the voltage regulator, alternator, or their wiring.

FEI (For Everyone's Information), the 85/2 944 series has dual speed 
fans (or 3 if you include "off" as automobile marketing groups do).  
Step 1 is low cooling and A/C, with both fans running at reduced speed 
through a big dropping resistor.  A relay triggered by the radiator 
thermostat switches the power on for this speed.

Stage 2 is high cooling, and possibly low cooling when the A/C is on.  
This speed plays when the 2nd radiator thermostat contact closes (at a 
slightly higher temp - 200 vs. 185 or so) and bypasses the resistors.

In neither case does a single relay contact directly switch all power 
into the fans in a single pop, though they both *do* bridge the current.

Well, in general, its' to trade for a 2.0....

You need to tell us what operating constraints you have -- needs to

it. It's time for bearings if you want to get more power and have it not

I put that exhaust on because it was the best thing that didn't involve

There is no muffler change you can make that will make a difference, 
but if you replace the heat exchangers with a *REAL* header system (I

are good...) you will get more performance. If you do the other engine

Subject: Better radio for 944

I got a few queries regarding a better radio -- this was all aftermath
of the great outside vs. windshield antenna debate.

So I thought i'd make a general posting ...

The radio which came with my 944S2 was a very poor Blaupunkt. After I concluded
that the poor reception was the fault of the radio, not the antenna, I
decided to get an after-market radio, and I wanted a removable one, as
a theft deterrent. Since the 944 has no secure area, except the glovebox
(micro size on the 85/1 and older, and ok size on the 85/2 and newer) I wanted
one with a removable front control panel, as opposed the type where the 
entire radio is removable, to minimize the storage space. 
(And to make it easy to carry the thing, as well.)

I did some research and learned that Pioneer is well-regarded, and that their
DEH-750 with CD was only slightly more expensive that a tape model,
so I got the CD model. I have been very pleased with this, and the
front panel is very easy to remove, and quite small: approx 1" X 1" X 6".
It cost about $450 at a store near me.

I've had it > 2 years, so there probably are newer and better models now.

Good Luck!

I may not be an expert, but know enough to be dangerous (experience
included)

Semi-technical discussion:
The nature of the laser beam makes it virtually impossible for
non-targeted cars to detect.  By the time the beam hits your car, it's
about four feet in diameter, or just about the size of your car.  This
means the amount of stray and odd-reflected energy is absolutely
minimal, therefore there's nothing for your detector to pick up.
Ok, so there's probably SOME stray laser hitting you in advance, but
it's minimal.  So why not make the detectors more sensitive?  Becasue
the lasers are IR, or infrared, which is nothing but heat.  With
enough sensitivity to pick up that stray beam, it would also pick up
virtually everything else.  Of course, the cop's laser is modulated,
or pulsed, in a recognizable pattern so that the laser gun can detect
it's own returning signal, while background IR would take the form of
white noise or some other modulation scheme.  With a sensitive enough
pickup and some real slick DSP (digital signal processing) it may be
possible to sort the stray laser IR from the background.  But they're
not there yet, and they may never be.
(Contrast this with radar, which has a very broad beam, bouncing off
everything and reaching you long before the cop has your car
targeted.)  So for the cops, laser is a very effective tool.

As discussed here earlier, there are some (theoretical) means of
beating the laser, mainly through overcoming it's beam with other IR.
This can be done with heat-producing items such as headlights,
foglights or even pure jamming devices (although I suspect they'd find
SOME way of nailing you if they caught you jamming them!)
Because of the large amount of stray IR during the day (sunlight)
lasers are most effective at night.  And don't kid yourself.  
The laser gun manufacturers know that they have to deal with
headlights/foglights and I'm sure they took this into account.  Of
course, you could always mount a megawatt searchlight on your roof.
This might work  :*)


Experiential discussion:
I recently purchased a Valentine 1 with laser option.  The day I got
it I read all about it's laser capabilities and how to be on the
defensive.  What they said was that the cop will be stationary because
it's impossible to aim that tight a beam with any accuracy from a
moving car.  The car is probably parked off the side of the road at
a right angle to the roadway so the cop can point it out the side
instead of through the highly slanted front windshield, who's optical
properties would distort, reflect and otherwise ruin the beam.  The
brochure never said you'd get advance warning, just that it could pick
up the laser.

Although I was aware some local cops had laser (newspaper articles) I
didn't know if they had it in my county yet.  So later that night, on the 
first time I ever used the Valentine, all of a sudden the thing goes
crazy with it's distinctive "laser" tone (a high-low pattern similar to
European sirens).  Just ahead I noticed the cop car, parked way off
the road at a right angle.  So the Valentine worked flawlessly, but
worthless nonetheless since he had my speed at the same instant I knew
he was there.  (BTW--I was only doing 55-60, so I was OK)


Summary:
So by the very nature of the beast, laser seems to be very effective
tool for the cops.  Until detectors are vastly improved, they now have
a great tool for catching us no matter what kind of detector we have.

Is Cinc. uwave and Valentine taking us for a ride?  Well, yes and no.
Their products DO perform as advertised in that they tell you when
you're in the beam.  But this doesn't give you any warning at all,
making this capability worthless.  In my opinion, save your money.
The extra dollars you spend won't do anything to help you.

Depends on where it came from... Wheeltowheel and autox have very
similar redistribution policies to Porschephiles. The rules work
like this: there are two issues at play here, copyright, and 
privacy of electronic mail. Copyright is covered under the '90 changes
in copyright law, when the US formally joined the rest of the world
community in their existing practices. Prior to '90, you had to 
register your work with the US Copyright Office, and have the 
"Copyright c-in-circle" notice with the owner's name, and date, appear
somewhere in the work. Now, post-'90, you automaticly OWN the copyright
to any Created Work just as soon as you create it. THe exception are
works for hire, in which case the person who is paying you owns the
copyright unless you have made prior arrangements. There are similar rules
which apply to patentable processes or devices, but that's a digression...

Anyway, you can give up copyright one of several different ways, and
one of those has *HISTORICLY* been by putting a non-registered copy
of something onto a public bulletin board. This is where it gets
tricky: post-90, this is no longer true! So people who *THINK*  that
something on a bulletin board (and Usenet NetNews *DOES* count as a
bulletin board...) is fair game are all dead wrong.

But to be sure that that's clear, under the Electronic Communications Privacy 
Act of '86, private e-mail (even private e-mail to a distribution list
over which you have no direct control) is considered *VERY* different
in nature than a public posting to an open bulletin board.

The Porschephiles policy is to remind everyone that we are dealing with
Private Mail here, *NOT* a bulletin board, and that everyone retains
copyright to everything they say here; that it is NOT in the 
public domain. They are two separate issues until you get into
litigation over infringement. The current policy, advised by a *VERY
GOOD* intellectual property lawyer, provides maximal leverage in
such cases...

>Reposting to the Zone 5 BBS is cool in general, but I
>would just shoot a message to the author for a prior OK.

Subject to the above, yes, I agree. Now, if we get a reciprocal 
intellectual property agreement with PCA, that makes things different
yet again.... But I'm not counting that until it's hatched...

Subject: Re: LASER .. no laws against countermeasures, yet!

Speaking of high tech,

There are better detection devices and laser jammers available.
I fly helicopters for the AF, so I'm familiar with lasers,
covert ops, active emitters, passive detectors, etc.

As mentioned previously, police lasers operate in the near IR
spectrum, being invisible to the naked eye, and having a 
high freq, short wavelength emission.

This is also where our night vision goggles operate (2nd
generation ANVIS-6, not the PNVS-5's).  With ANVIS, you can
see red lights, lit cigarettes, lasers, and other heat sources
very well.  Our door guns use laser aiming devices which are
invis. to the naked eye, but are visible under NVG's.  Also,
ANVIS does not "look into" the blue-green or UV portions of
the spectrum, so blue lights are almost invisible, and green
lights are very subtle.

Some of you may note, as I have, that 944/951 instrument lights
are green tinted.  Being the maverick that I am, I took my NVG's
for a spin around the base late one night after flying a mission,
in my blacked-out 951.  No incompatibility problems noted.
But don't try this at home, unless you're very familiar with
how NVG's work, because of limited field of vision, lack of
depth perception, etc.  

So, at night, you could drive with NVG's and you would see the
laser beam even if it was not pointed at you.  Now all you need
is $18,000 for the goggles (batteries not included).

On real dark and cloudy nights, with no moon or stars, we use a
"pink light" for active illumination of LZ's, etc.  It's not
really pink, it's actually a very dark red, almost black.  It
is just a filter which goes over our spotlight to filter out the
visible light, and emit only near-IR light.  The searchlight is
about 1.5 million candlepower.  It looks like daylight when
using NVG's.   I suspect this would overpower the return signal 
from a police radar, and overwhelm his receiver.

Well, that depends.  If you want a single tire for both street and autox,
you're gonna have to compromise.

On the stock 15x5.5" rims, the most popular autocross size seems to be either
195/50-15 or 205/50-15.  In addition to giving significantly more width than
the stock 165-15's, these are also much smaller in diameter, which gives a
significant gearing advantage for autocrossing.  They also lower the car
significantly, an advantage in cornering.

These effects may not be what you want for the street, though.  Small-diameter
tires are a disadvantage on the street because the ride is worse (never mind
the effect of the short sidewall height), ground clearance is lacking, and
perhaps most importantly, the gearing is just awful.  You'll be winding your
engine way out at highway cruising speeds.

I would strongly recommend finding a second set of rims and getting dedicated
tires for each application.  You'll be happier on the street and quicker in
the autocrosses.  And your street tires will last much longer...

>        What *alignment* settings are best for combined street/autox?

Note how I carefully dodge the "what tire" question. :-)

You probably want something like zero toe all around, as much negative camber

Subject: CD in a Porsche

Anthony Waitz wants to know about using a CD player in a Porsche, due
to concerns about stiff suspension and possible mistracking.

Here's my experience:

	A good automotive CD is quite immune to bumps. It will
	mistrack on a very bad bump, though. When this happens the
	CD goes slient for about a second, and then it resumes at
	(or quite near) the spot it last played. I find this only
	a minor inconvenience -- and I live in the pothole-laden
	NorthEast.

	I have been told that the machines are more likely to mistrack
	when they are cold, and indeed, performance is worse in the winter.

On balance, I like my CD, and storage is more efficient than bulky
cassette boxes. (I have a CD 'pouch'. You remove the CDs from their
original jewel boxes and put them into this thing, which has a safety
sleeve for each disk. The 10-size pouch is about 1.5" tall and easily fits
in a door storage bin, in the glovebox, in the bin below the radio, or
behind the seat.)

I just picked up a BEL 645i Plus for myself and a BEL 620i Plus for a friend
yestersday.  They both have laser detection capability.  The 645STi (the stealth
version) was reviewed in the April issue of Car & Driver.  I think your Escort
4500 was also reviewed.

Anyhow, I haven't hit any lasers or Ka band in the 24 hours since I picked them
up -- only X band and K band.  I'll keep you posted though.  Personally, I do
not expect the laser detection to provide me with much assistance.  I basically
got the units because of their radar performance.  I figure that 99.9% of the
time, when a laser warning sounds, it will be because I just got zapped.

Not that I can recall.  There are wires and connectors and other

The DME/KLR boxes are under the front passenger's feet, and there may

Digging into the archives, replacing the front shock inserts in my '87 911 
seemed pretty straighforward (original: Boge). I ordered the red Koni adjustable 
shocks and went to work. The top nut was easily removed with the impact wrench. 
As described, I lowered the threaded end into the wheel well, swung out the 
assembly (barely made it because of tension on the brake line)and removed the 
top "tube". With considerably more effort was I able to unscrew the lid that 
retains the shock. I found it easier to put the threaded end back in its hole, 
so that the whole assembly was stable before I attacked with the pipe wrench.
NOW I AM STUCK... I anticipated that the shock body would easily come out, but 
that was wrong. How do I remove it ??? Spoiled the first spring day in 5 months 
in Pittsburgh. 
Do I have to remove a bolt in the lower end ?

This leads into my next question.  My power antenna has been jammed for years.
I want to take it off and replace it with a new one.  How do I get at it?

Many of us have chipped 951's with cats, with no trouble.  The 951 
exhaust is extremely good to begin with.  The cat does not introduce 
much resistance.  Given the hassles of replacing it, and the government 
inspections, I'd recommend leaving it on.  It won't "melt" if your car

Subject: cost per mile to own a Porsche

Hi...  I drive a '69 912 Porsche daily driver that is in pretty good shape, 
although with the car being 25 years old, it needs a lot of work to keep 
it in good running order (this month, new generator; last month, new CV's;
and there's getting the gas tank relined, the front+rear suspension
rebushed; rear oil seal; clutch; etc.).  The case has never been split,
and the car has about 120k miles.  It's virtually rust-free.  It needs
either new paint or a lot of time under the orbital buffer (or a combination
of both).  The carbs need to be rebushed, the headliner is looking old,
NPR big-bore kits are unavailable (almost)...

I'm wondering if someone can quantify my being able to justify trading up
to a newer porsche, say a 1980 911SC.  Will my cost per mile drop enough
to justify taking on a $200/mo car payment, or should I keep putting that
much $$ into my 912?

I'm trying to solve this in an UN-emotional way.  Sure, I love the growl
of an SC, but economics is a reality for me and I need to get the most
out of my German metal habit.

Practical advice appreciated.

Pretty easy, undo the screw-piece base on the fender top, then unscrew 
the bracket inside the fender.  The unit comes out with the cables.  
There's some cable slack to play with; if it's not enough or you're 
replacing the whole unit then you need to disconnect the wires to the 
radio and power source.

Tapping off the cig. lighter works.  Depends on if you want the 
detector on at ALL times, or only when the key's on.  Older Passports 
had 9V power converters that took power from the battery at all times, 
even when the detector was off.  The 82-85/1 944's had a feature where 
power was supplied to the radio whenever a key was in the ignition slot 
 - not necessarily turned on.  This was neat, because you could listen 
to the radio without the ignition on, yet not worry about leaving the 
radio running once you left the car.  You can tap this power source off 
the radio lines.

If you use a wider tire on one axle it should be the REAR
to maintain a safe OVERSTEAR condition in your handeling.

Be aware that your gas milage may drop and your spedo and

if a smaller tire OUTSIDE DIAMETER is used on the rear.

Subject: Cooling fan relay 951 & DME/fuel relay 944


A couple of years ago I had a problem with the fan relay
in my 86 951.  (during summer in phoenix 120F every day)

The old gal was well on her way to meltdown before I realized 
the problem.  (waterpump died prematurely and hose soon blew)

Upon inspection of the schematic I found there are three (3)
relays in the 'fan relay mudule'

1. kicks in low speed wire on fans via #3
2. kicks in high speed wire for fans
    	(signals for 1&2 from radiator mounted fan switch)
3. kicks in low speed when AC is on
	(signal from AC/heat control module)
	
This is somewhat bizare but the #1 relay turns on the #3
relay which turns the fan on.

my problem was the #1 relay contacts burned out so 
the engine would get REALLY hot befor the high speed 
function kicked in.  
The temporary cure was to drive around with the AC on 
which activated the low speed fan.

CURE:
Hell no I did not blow $50 on a new relay!

I tore apart the 'relay module' and replaced only
the #1 relay inside.  $2 plus 1/2 hour labor
Has worked fine ever since.

But just for good measure I added a manual switch to
activate the fan!  (turn on fan maunually when stuck
in trafic jams-keeps my baby COOL.)

=====furthermore
Last year the bloody DME/fuel pump relay pulled the
same trick on me.

I got a nice big 30Amp relay to cure this problem once
and for all.  The factory relay is somewhat whimpy.
I measured resistance through coil windings of old relay
to match current draw from the DME box for the new beefy relay.  

works great and will last forever.?

good luck

  I'm joining Gary Greenburg and the broke-off-bolt gang..

  My '76 914 has a snapped off bolt in the battery side suspension console.
  At the forward outer mount there is a cluster of 3 bolts inside a hood
like structure (the outer swing-arm mount).  The forward most outer of
those three bolts has broken off inside the housing.  Not sure what
to call the thang..  From above, with the rear wheel removed you can see
the structure with those cute plastic covers over each bolt hole.  These
are the backside of the nut.

  The problem with this is the bolt's shaft is inside this housing and so
buried within.
  *Anybody* grappled with this one?

  So far, my tact would be to excise the housing with the nut/bolt-stem
with a die grinder or dremel (both!) and reconstruct with a fresh
nut and bolt.  I've never been inside one of these mounts, so i dunno
what i'm in for.  This is part of the dreaded suspension console, but
not encompassed in the replacement part.  btw, i inherited this faux pas.

I have had similar experience with the Panasonic CD player I have had for 
one year now in my stock 1985/2 944. I usually get one or two skips on my 
commute to work which includes residential, highway and city driving.

From my own experience, skips are more likely to occur at higher speeds, 
with bumps that hit the left and right tires simultaneously and when it's 
cold (below freezing). Surprisingly, large gaping pot holes hit at city 
driving speeds never skip the CD player, while very small highway expansion 
joints hit at highways speeds will do it every time. Clean CDs are less 
likely to skip than dusty ones.

I am very happy with the CD player in my car. Of course, I would prefer if 
there were no skips at all, but it doesn't really happen often enough to 
bother me.

I am sure that a CD player mounted in a big, plush, American, taxi-type of 
vehicle would never skip at all. Just another price we have to pay for the 
firmer ride of a sports car.

Hubert,
At the very least, you need a Haynes manual to familiarize yourself with the

The cylinder you refer to is a charcoal canister which captures evaporative
gases from the gas tank. There is a thermally activated vacuum switch, which
allows the captured gases to be fed into the air intake stream after the engine
warms up. The canister is made of plastic, so be careful not to break the
connection ports if you remove it. It is also yet another source for air leaks
so you might want to check the hoses leading to to/from it once in a while. Or
better yet, when you remove it to access the antenna, you should probably repla
ce the hoses leading to the canister. Be extra cautious keeping dirt out of
those hoses, since if it is like the $$931$$, those things connect to the
air intake downstream from the filter. Right into the neck of the turbo,
in the case of the 931.

removing the antenna is straightforward once you remove the canister. Provided
that the thing isn't corroded, inwhich case it will crumble in your hands when
you remove the cable connector, or at least when you unthread the retaining
nut on the underside of the antenna mount. good luck.

Bart, 

What you have to do is to pry it out through the hole at the top of the shock 
tower. Porsche did not use the "inserts." The housing of the strut is actually 
the orginal housing of the shock absorbers. Therefore, there is a rubber "o-
ring" seal that keeps the fluid from coming out. What I had to do was to:
* reattach the top nut
* extend the shock through the hole in the shock tower
* use a preverbial "tie rod end separator" and a big block of wood to pry it out
* my neighbor also helped with a 10 lbs lead hammer

Oh, be prepared to collect the fluid from inside the shock housing. 

Good luck.

Well I think I may have sold my Speedster Replica over the weekend.  Not

a used 911.  Can anyone recommend a good mechanic or shop in the SF Bay Area.

I want to have the car I chose thoroughly checked out by a reputable mechanic.
I've narrowed down my selection to either a '72-'73 911S or E, '73.5 T, or
an '83 911SC.  I've found a '73 911E sunroof coupe (all original except for

Thanks to all who provided insight into this model.

After going to look at the car, I decided against it. The car
is in good shape, the records are up to date and well kept.
The only problem is 143K miles. I was a little ticked to
drive 90 miles to look at it, only to be told that they
"mistakenly" told me it had 78K on the phone.

If anyone else is still looking for one, it is in Birmingham,

All this searching is about to make me buy a 951.

There are two schools of thought on MFI.  The more popular for years was to
scrap the system and replace it with carbs.  The other, smaller school says to
learn how to adjust the system and enjoy it.  I'm the second school.  MFI is not
as complicated as it first looks, but it does take patience to set it right and
keep it running right.  Even the simple task of setting the idle requires a
number of steps.  Balance the stacks, then set the idle mixture, then rebalance
the stacks.  The source of most problems is the mechanical pump, which will wear
out and will mix gas into the oil if you don't keep a close eye on it.  The best
test for this is the get the engine warm, then take off the oil filler cap with
engine running.  If the smell of gas makes your eyes water it's time to rebuild
the pump.  This means removing the pump and sending it to one of two places (H &
R Fuel Injection in New York or Pacific Fuel Injection in California) that can
rebuild the pump.  I run MFI on my '72 911T and perform most the adjustments
myself.  I also bought a second MFI pump some time back and had it rebuilt as a
spare.  When the first pump wore out, I replaced it with the rebuilt unit and
sent the original unit in for a rebuild.  It's now sitting on the shelf until
needed.  To set the idle mixture, you adjust one external setting on the pump.
To set the midrange mixture, you have to set an internal mixture screw.  Both
require special tools (Performance Products sells the three tools needed for
about $50). You also need an exhause gas analyzer (the $110 Gunson unit from
England works fine).  When you change the setting on midrange mixture, you have
to reset the idle mixture.  When you rebalance the stacks (just like balancing
carbs), it also affects the idle mixture.  Since this is a mechanical system and
does not have an oxygen sensor, you have to reset it if you live in an area that
has oxygenated gas in the winter.  I generally check and reset (if necessary)
the mixture on mine about once a month.  Pacific Fuel Injection sells a booklet
on adjusting MFI and there is also a good section on adjustment in the factory
tech manual (the two-volume, $250+ set).  I've had more than one mechanic tell
me to scrap the system on go to carbs, but the MFI runs smoothly, starts with no
problem and gives me better performance than carbs.  If you don't mind having to
futz with it a lot, MFI is the way to go.

Being an "expert" in irrational justification, (according to my wife)
I would think this one is easy. (smiley's implied everywhere)

Jon's Top Tens reasons to go from a 912 to a 911SC...

10. You prefer the snarl of the SC.

 9. You feel the need for "more power".

 8. All your friends either have one, or should.

 7. By moving to a newer model, you'll allow a new Porsche fan to fill
    your shoes. (or car, as the case may be)

 6. You won't get as many blank stares at parts counters.

 5. Better selection of "cool toys" available.

 4. You'll never have to explain the differences between a 911 and
    a 912 again!

 3. You can explore the wonders of modern emission controls.

 2. You can help stimulate the economy through personal spending.

 1. "German metal habits" are not logical, so logic dictates that you
    DO NOT use logic in the decision process.

I believe a high quality CD player will seldom skip.  For example,
I have a friend with a pretty expensive Alpine CD player in

The Alpine seldom skips.  On the other hand, the  $220 dollar Blaupunkt

	Anthony Waitz wants to know about using a CD player in a Porsche, due

	Here's my experience:
	
		A good automotive CD is quite immune to bumps. It will
		mistrack on a very bad bump, though. When this happens the
		CD goes slient for about a second, and then it resumes at
		(or quite near) the spot it last played. I find this only
		a minor inconvenience -- and I live in the pothole-laden
		NorthEast.
	
		I have been told that the machines are more likely to mistrack
		when they are cold, and indeed, performance is worse in the winter.
	
	On balance, I like my CD, and storage is more efficient than bulky
	cassette boxes. (I have a CD 'pouch'. You remove the CDs from their
	original jewel boxes and put them into this thing, which has a safety
	sleeve for each disk. The 10-size pouch is about 1.5" tall and easily fits

In reply to the 6"4 person looking for a proper "fit"...

I'm 6"9. When I was looking for a car, I had a hell of a time trying to find
something that fit like my 84 Rabbit GTI. Most sporty cars were just too low
for me to fit in without banging my head, or having my knees wrapped around
the steering wheel. Then, for kicks, I went to the Porsche dealer, and asked
them if they could set me up with something.

It turns out that I could sit in a 944 with headroom to spare. My legs fit well
with the seat all the way back, and I wound up buying a 87 944S.

Since then, I have had no problems with the ride. I have driven 8 hours to 
Boston (from DC) without any discomfort. The sunroof does not cut down the
headroom either. 

Try one out. Reagrding the older cars, I could drive my dad's 68 911L with the
seat back, but it does have some sort of a custom steering wheel linkage.

I've been reading this list with interest for a few months now, what a ton of 
stuff.  I _know_ there's someone out there who has seen the following symptom.  
I'm experiencing engine noise exactly at 3200 rpm (during moderate 
acceleration).  It's kind of like a loud grinding or vibration, like my old 
oscillating power sander used to make while coming up to speed.  My mechanic 
told me it was the right front motor mount and replaced the motor mount but the 
noise stilil happens.  He now suggests replacing more motor mounts, at about 
$180 a pop.  I understand that motor mounts on these cars are notoriously bad, 
but is this a common symptom of bad motor mounts (i.e. motor noise at one 
particular rpm)? 

Thanks in advance for any advice,

Subject: CD Players


	I have a 1972 911T with a Pioneer CD Changer (CDX-M40), and have very 
little skippage.  The car has been lowered, and has very stiff shocks, so
it will only skip when I hit something REALLY hard.  
	The Pioneer changers have a special suspension in them which I have 
found to work quite well.  I have had two of them, having bought the 
first one in 1989.  I mounted the changer behind the passenger seat, so 
it is out of the sight of the clerks at midnight auto supply, but I can 
still change magazines while I'm driving. (Careful Now!)  This system 
uses a 15 wire cable that runs between the head unit and the changer, 
and this fit nicely under the carper in the tunnel.
	In addition, I have a 150W Denon amp powering two Pioneer speakers 
(TX-X300) on the back deck, and a 30W Denon amp powering the front two 
speakers in the doors, along with an electronic crossover.  
	This setup is enough to overcome any noise with the targa top off,
at any speed I can get this baby up to, and the sound quality is excellent.  
	These particulatar speakers that I have on the back deck also have 
EXCELLENT bass response.

I have an Alpine single CD player in my Porsche and it has never skipped. The 
Pioneer in there before skipped just by changing lane on the freeway. I also 
have another Alpine CD player in my BMW but it is a pullout one and that one 
skips a tiny bit more than the fixed unit in the Porsche. Basically when it 
gets bumpy and I get serious with the car. 

Get an Alpine, you'll be happy it will not skip.

   My 76 911 has recently decided not to want to start
   when warm after sitting for an hour or so.  It starts
   OK cold and starts great when warm if it has been less
   than 30 minutes or since being shut off.  When this 
   problem manifests itself, the thing will eventually start,
   but it takes about 30 seconds of repeated cranking.
   (It acts like it's not getting any fuel).

I had this problem, solved in my case by replacing the $30 fuel line
check valve (after many other more expensive attempts failed).  Start
with that before you try anything harder.

I understand your anger.  I'd be pissed too.  And then I'd try to
get the price down a couple of thousand.  143k in an SC shouldn't
disturb you too much; we're talking durable cars, here.  Still, the
broker sounds a little shady, so maybe walking away was the
right thing to do.

If you'd consider a CA 911, give me your price range, year/model

Modern CD players have this too.  Mini-disk is most useful for it's
recordable feature, playback will never be as good as cd, as it's a lossy
6:1 compression method, and will have generational loss compared to CD and
DAT.  May be better than DCC though.

My only remaining question is how to identify the screw-piece base, which I
assume I will find when I open the hood.  The bracket inside the fender, I
presumably will only be able to get at after I remove the front left wheel from
the car?  Thanks again for your help.

If anyone is REALLY interested I can get pricing, which should be

I'd appreciate it if people who are casually interested would not make

Randy,

Your idea of posting a set of rally instructions is interesting; I'll see if
I can get an OK from the '93 Parade people to post that rally on the net.

Best advice I can give is to participate in a rally with your navigator at a
local region event before the Parade; this will let you (hopefully) get past
the shouting at the navigator/driver phase before the Parade, learn how to
look for landmarks, etc. and you'll have a better time. I STRONGLY recommend
that you don't even think about trying to win or even place highly; you'll
have a better time, preserve your relationship with your navigator, and
almost _certainly_ actually do better.

Rallying has destroyed too many spouses'/SOs' enjoyment of sportscar
events--don't be a "victim" or a "perpetrator"!

Just keep repeating to yourself "it's only a game, it's only a game...".

Just to add my two cents worth on CD players.
I've been using a middle of the line Alpine multiple
CD player and in 18 months and thousands of miles
of hard driving I've never had a CD mistrack or skip.
It is in is a 930 that is lowered and not exactly soft.
The wide tires seem to amplify every road perfection.
The under the hood CD shuttle does provide additional
isolation thats not possible in dash so this helps.
I went with the under the hood version because it was the
cheapest way to add CD to my system. I've been very
happy with the CD player in a P-car so far.

    If you hate the skips, get a disc player with "ESP."  (Electronic
Shock Protection.)  Someone alluded to this, I think....  The player
reads ahead on the disc, typically 1 to 3 seconds, and stores this info
in digital memory.  When the signal from the play head is interrupted,
the player will play from memory.  Hopefully the play head will resume
tracking before memory runs out.  Eats the battery quickly, but that's
what those cigarette lighter sockets are for, right?
    I bought a Sony for about $300 at a large electronics chain.  The
ESP works fine--it would only skip if I were going over *lots* of bumps
in my very hard-sprung 914.  My earlier player wouldn't play at all
going over those same bumps.

Subject: '81 911SC Targa -> 930 conversion questions.


Hi Ho Porsche People, my first message...

Topic: 911SC Targa to 930 Turbo conversion, may not be of interest to all.

Quick Background...
Last summer, I had to tell my insurance company how my hood latch failed while 
doing 65mph in my 1981 911 SC Targa and poofh! - All of a sudden, I needed a 
new hood, and windsheild frame.  The lucky guy I am, before they fixed it...

Two weeks later, I was run off the road into a guard rail in the same
car.  The other guys insurance is paying for a new drivers side of the 
car.  As an aside, he tried to get away from me - hit and run - from a
Porsche, in a big-ass boneville or something, what a joke, after a very fun
chase, he turned down a dead-end street.  Gotch Ya buddy!   He gets out,
and says "It's ok, I can fix it, I work at a dealer.  A Ford dealer."  Erk!!!
I say "Yeah right pal, I'll take my Porsche to your Ford dealer, and you can
just go bang thoose flares right back out to normal."  See you in court!

So...
What better time to go ahead with the plunge to convert my 45K mile car to 
my favorite all time sports car look: the Porsche 930 conversion.  The 
shop doing the rapairs/conversion (Dick's Auto Body, Somerville, MA) is a 
very good and reputable one.  They are very patient and are willing to work
with me to get the look I want, and stored the car for me all winter long,
indoors, no charge, and they work they do is perfection.  This was clear 
from the day I pulled in to their shop - Porsches, Testarossa's, Lamborghini's,
Mercedes, BMW's, etc. abound.  When you see this many cars, of this caliber,
in one shop, in the Boston area, its gotta be a good one, since there are
not too many cars like this around this pothole ridden, snow ladden town.

Anyways, I have a few  questions about the conversion that is currently in 
progress...it will be finished in 3 weeks or so.

I wanted to go with aftermarket rims duplicating the late model Carrera 2
turbo style.  I (insurance) bought a set of 4 Mackin C2-T rims (17 x 7.5 Frt.,
17 x 9 Rear) with Dunlop SP-8000's (215/45ZR17 Frt., 255/40ZR17 Rear) from
the Tire Rack, mail order.  Putting 'em next to the factorys, they looked
identical - Very happy.  Has anyone had any experiences with these rims?
The price was right, compared to factory.  Isurance gave me $1100 each for
the two drivers side fuchs rims, which were scratched up. 

What about these tire/rim sizes and fit for
an '81 911 going to a 930 fender?  This is a factory flare/parts conversion.
Any rubbing problems?  Tire rack said many people do this, and I should be
fine.  Lastly, Tire Rack said these rims are meant for this conversion type
thing and I may not need spacers, but that some people still go ahead with
the wheel spacers anyways.  Will it look stupid/wrong without the spacers?
Also, Am I going to have to be extra careful about potholes with these?  
I do not drive it it the winter, only Mid-April until Oct 31.

What is the best place ($$/quality) to get the center caps for these rims?
Also, there seem to be different cap types: plain brushed aluminum look, hand
painted crest look, and painted then baked enamel crest look.  I want the
baked ones, are these good?  Where should I buy these?  I also want a new
hood badge and gasket - same questions?

I purchased an aftermarket fiberglass RUF front spoiler from Better Bodies
for this 930 conversion.  What do I cover the oil cooler rectangular hole with
if I do/don't put in a cooler?  The rear deck lid grille is gone since
the car already came with a turbo whale tail.  If no engine mods are done, is
it worth putting in an oil cooler in this opening?  Where can I get fog lights
for this RUF spoiler at a decent price?  Can't use SC fog lights I was told,
or can I somehow?

What about topping the conversion off with a Targa -> Cabriolet.  Wow, a pun!
Any problems, experiences?  Where can I find a good cab top assembly for a
reasonable price?  Should I for new or used setup?  Electric/Manual?  What is
the cost of this process in general?  I think its $$$, is it worth it? Or does
it invite a quick slice with a knife and goodbye Porsche.  This is Boston.

How does a 930 Widebody TARGA look, look?  I've never seen one in any magazine?
Kind of too late for this question though.  I'll be happy I hope.

Any other pointer/hints about this conversion I should think of, before its
finished?  For now, the engine will remain unchanged.

Thanks a bunch.  This is my first Porsche, had it for a year, I love it since
I came from 2 Jeeps.  Now I just need to go out and buy that Sony 10 Disc
changer.  I will probably have other questions some other day...

Subject: 914 Questions

Can anybody suggest a better source of value for 914 carpet over Classic 
German Interiors in PA???  I'm not planning to make the car concours, just
covering interior metal...  The car will be used to street/autox, and will 
not be a daily driver.

We're starting to strip paint on the car.  A couple people have suggested 
changing the color to fly yellow, or somesuch.  What color yellow was 
available in 73 from Porsche???  The car was originally a medium blue - not 
a color I want to resurrect.  The car came to me in black with a very poor 
paint job, BTW.  Black would be easy, but a little hot in Texas summers.

I want to remove the unsightly antenna from the fender.  Does anyone have any
great ideas on how I can replace it, but hide it??  Hide it behind the 
seats???

Lastly, what are the suggested sources of aftermarket outside mirrors?  I
understand the passenger door has nuts welded on the inside of the skin to
accommodate a mirror, and want to have a matching set.  Or is stock the best 
way to go??

Thanks.

Seat Belts
Hey, gang!
    I was messing around with the 1.8's interior on Sunday, and I
decided that I wanted to look at the guts of the seatbelt retractor.
It was getting pretty finicky, so I figured I might as well look into
it as replace it.  Well, I opened up one side, and it went *SPROING*,
and I was wearing a large spring.
    Should I try to put it back together?  The factory manual does
not show the interior of the retractor, but I can see where the spring
should go.  I'm just concerned that I may not get the tension correct,
and that my repair may not be safe.
    Let me stress that I had made the decision (that I would probably
need to replace the belt) *before* I opened up the mechanism.  I have
no problems with that.  I *do* have problems with un-safe seat belts.

Subject: 356 challenge again

Well, the San Bernardino slalom came and went. We even held up the start for
a couple of hours to allow enough time for a car with a Pellow-built motor
to show up -- to no avail. So my car won again. (4 cars in class). Too bad,
Harry, this would have been your kind of course -- it didn't call for any
power.
 
So here it comes again -- the next slalom is this weekend, at San Diego's
Jack Murphy Stadium. It's a Zone 8 event again. The bet is still for a new
late 356 oil cooler.
 
Come Monday, my car will have been in action for three weekends in a row.
Two slaloms and a vintage racing school at Willow Springs. Didn't see a
single Pellowmotor at any of those. Gee, maybe my engine's getting tired?
Maybe Pellow has a chance at San Diego?
 
Harry, isn't there ANYONE out there with one of your boat anchors who is
willing to be embarrassed by a daily driver/slalom/vintage racer with 50,000
miles since its original engine last came apart? (Note we're not talking
Bonneville car here, as you did in your last message.)

Comment: Anybody can peg the tach at idle. And speedometers are inaccurate.
And lots of 356s run with smaller than stock tires, raising the indicated
speed even more. I want to see it on a level road in top gear, with verifiable
test gear attached.
 
>Maybe I'll also build another to take to your desert driveway, after

Not judging by his non-show at the last slalom, and I predict at this next
one, he doesn't. The offer to put test gear on one of Pellow's STREET CARS
(not a Bonneville special) is still open. But the more time he has to build
a new engine, rather than just show up with what he's already built, the
more I suspect he's built a five-mile handgrenade special.
 
Also, Pellow implies that his motors make more torque at low and midrange,
_but by implication not at the top end._ If they don't have more torque at
the top, they don't have more power at the top, and they won't make more top
speed, and therefore won't make 120 mph. The factory claim for an SC was 115
mph (Conradt, "Porsche 356: Driving in its Purest Form," p. 243; Ludvigsen,
"Excellence was Expected," p. 282). It will take a lot of added power (and
torque) to add 5 mph. Figure at least 25 hp.

Comment: these cars are NOT irreplaceable. Look in any big-city paper or Auto
Trader. You can buy half a dozen 356s a week without going more than 200 miles
from home. Some of those might even be good, straight, rust-free cars. I had no
difficulty finding a one-owner original C coupe, no rust, no hits, for $13K.
The 356 is not rare. If you blow one up while racing, you can go get
another just like it. There were 3 356s at the VARA vintage school at Willow;
we formed the largest marque contingent after the 11 (!) Shelby GT 350s, at
least 9 of which were genuine. 356s are not high-priced collector toys yet. A
decent driver costs less than a new Detroit midsize car. And in the
reproduction and replacement parts world, you can get cranks, flywheels, rods,
all of high quality, and cases are not by any means rare.

Subject: Re: cost per mile to own a Porsche


It seems to me a 1980 SC would have to be much more expenssive to drive
than a 1969 912. Fuel, insurance and will certainly be more and
maintenance could easily be the same amount if you are unlucky with the
'80 SC (which would be at least 13 years old and most likely driven
hard).

If you can find a dream 80 SC (single owner, all records present
indicating proper maintenance and upgrades, no hacking or accidents
etc, etc), you may be better off. Otherwise the trouble you know may be
preferable to the trouble you don't know about!

In a way the refurbishing of your 912 would be an investment. If you do
it properly, the value of the 912 will certainly stay the same or even
increase. You have to be careful you do not invest more in the 912 than
it actually is worth. You should make certain your insurance covers the
car for the appraised replacement value. Of course you can invest more
in the 912 than it is worth in today's depressed clasic car market.
Have your 912 appraised (this will cost about $100). Find out from
Excellence Hemmings and/or Panorama how much refurbished 912s are going
for these days. The differenc represents your budget for the 912's
rehab.

If you really enjoy the 912 you may prefer to find a restored 912.
Right now it can be cheaper to buy a restored car than to actually
restore one. Your challange is to find a properly restore car.

Have fun.

Yup, I had the exact same symptoms on my 85.2 944.  The noise was caused
by the catalytic converter touching one of the metal guards that
surround it.  The only explanation/cause for this is the resonance created
at that particular speed.  
I took the car into the shop (your plain, garden variety muffler shop)
the guy looked at it, and with a crow bar distanced the guard from
the converter.  Just that simple.  They didn't even charge me anything.
You don't know how relieved I was to see that noise gone.  At first
I thought it would be the transmission which meant a costly fix was on
the way, but things worked out to be pretty simple.

I hope your problem is this simple too.

Randy,

Your idea of posting a set of rally instructions is interesting; I'll see if
I can get an OK from the '93 Parade people to post that rally on the net.

Best advice I can give is to participate in a rally with your navigator at a
local region event before the Parade; this will let you (hopefully) get past
the shouting at the navigator/driver phase before the Parade, learn how to
look for landmarks, etc. and you'll have a better time. I STRONGLY recommend
that you don't even think about trying to win or even place highly; you'll
have a better time, preserve your relationship with your navigator, and
almost _certainly_ actually do better.

Rallying has destroyed too many spouses'/SOs' enjoyment of sportscar
events--don't be a "victim" or a "perpetrator"!

Just keep repeating to yourself "it's only a game, it's only a game...".

Regards,
  Lou Krieg
 I second those recommendations.  My (former) husband and I were quite good
rallyers...no, rallying was not what ended the marriage.  Rallying was
something we did well together.  Looking back, I think one reason was that we
each had specific tasks, and trusted eachother to do those tasks.  I drove, and
looked for clues/landmarks. As driver I also watched the speedo and odo
carefully.  He navigated, read the instructions, watched the watch, and did the
calculations.  He would tell me every 20-30 seconds what my odometer should
read, based on CAST as stated in the instructions) and elapsed time.  It worked
well.  I kept us from getting lost by watching road signs, and finding clues;
and he kept us on time by calculating distance knowing elapsed time and speed. 
We won a lot of rallies locally. You and your navigator may not be interested
in just such an arrangement.  However, the ideas of clearly defined tasks for
driver and navigator, and mutual trust I think are important ones.  And, like
you said, Lou, try to practice beforehand.  Also I have found that rallying at
Parade is a bit of a classing game.  The largest class by far is
seat-of-the-pants.  Trophies can go up to 20 deep in that class.  Then there is
EQUIPPED for the pros, which is a small class, but predictably very
competitive.  The third class is the in-between Navigational class, which is
usually quite small as well, and usually less competitive than Equipped, but
not necessarily.  The game part is that, depending on the competition, a team
in Equipped with 20 points might take home a trophy, whereas a team in
Navigational with 20 points might not, because there were enough other teams in
that class who had fewer points.  Also, the irony of the game is that not
infrequently the team with the fewest points will be in seat-of-the-pants
class.  Some people play the classing game, to try to make themselves more
competitive.  I don't recommend it.

   Well Iam glad that I am not the only one.  I opened my up a year or so
ago and when I saw that spring waiting to let go I closed it up real fast.
I was supprised how strong the spring was and how lousy they work.  Is there
a way to fix or improve them.  I had a accident in my first 914 and the belt
didn't work (did not catch) so Iam sort of worried about this again.  My

	Hi there... I am new to the network too, but I'll tell you what I know.
The rims will fit fine in your case, I know because I tried almost an identical
set up on my 84 Euro 911. I bought the AKT 17 8" and 9" and fitted a 235 front
which barely missed the fender. So I am going to put 225. The rear will take
245 easy and may be 255 in my case. In your case, You should have no problems.
If you need spacers you can add them later.

I would recommend against the Cab due to added noise and weight. 

Since the engine is out, go ahead and install Carrera oil tensioners and oil
coolers. Also, if I was you I would add some power to the engine to pull the
extra weight!. Add a LSD too!

I used to live in Boston, and I applaude you for driving it on such bad roads!
You will have to be very carefull with the 17's, you can bend them in a pothole.

Tell us how it goes!! Good Luck.

Yah, there are details I didn't mention.  Removing the F/L wheel makes 
the job possible.  Someone else mentioned the charcoal canister in the 
way (I unloaded my 83 w/electric antenna 8 years ago, so don't remember 
*all* the details!).

The "screw base" I mentioned is at the base of the antenna, atop the 
fender.  It has little cuts 180 degrees apart, for use with a special 
tool for unscrewing.  I found needle-nose pliers to work fine - use the 
tip of each needle in each slot.  It's a pretty straight-forward job.

I have an Alpine in my 87 911 which is regularly driven on hwy. 237. In the
last year (15k miles) my CD has skipped 2 or 3 times and only when the bump
is so severe that I am far more concerned about the car than the music. I
would avoid a deck that skipped once per day or so - the CD player might be
damaged by shocks that exceed what it was designed for.

My noise happened at 2900 RPM and was a loose bolt on
the catalytic converter.  Tightened that sucker up and
the noise went away.  Check all those exhaust bolts for
tightness.

I would think a bad motor mount would cause a vibration,
not just noise.

=========
I've lived this one and had quite the opposite experience.  My 912 fell
apart around me and was costing $thousands each year to repair
(failures only) while the 84 was virtually trouble free (okay, it was
not quite as old as an SC).

The SC engine is a much more durable one, the body is galvanized, and
the design proven.   Prices are probably close to the bottom -- speculation,
of course, but people know the SC is a real workhorse with the advantages
of modern technology.  The 912 (no offense, out there) will never
command much of a premium.  The detuned 356SC engine was too easily
overworked,  rust was a fatal problem, and performance was ah, lacking
(0-60 in 12 seconds).  Sure it was fun to toss around but for me there
wasn't a moment I wouldn't have jumped at the chance to trade for a
same-year 911.

I certainly agree that getting the right car makes all the difference but
in a blind taste test I'd take the SC as costing less to own, even
factoring in insurance.  And that's not counting the intangible value we
all place in enjoying what we're driving.

Well, on the other hand, you can do a few modifications to the 912 motor
and get a hell of a lot more HP out of it.  There are heavy-duty counter-
weighted cranks out there for the 912 (including longer strokes), you can 
go to larger pistons quite easily (the 85.5 Forged Mahle are nice, as are
the 88mm Forged Mahle), you can upgrade to better carbs (Weber 44 IDF, for
example), mount a second oil cooler, upgrade to a Bursch (sp?) exhaust, 
and perhaps even a hotter cam.  Trust me, the 912 motor is not as frail
as it seems--pretty much anything you do to an air-cooled VW motor, you
can do to a 912 motor...for a much higher cost, of course!  Actually, I'm
not sure, but I think some items are interchangable between the VW and
the 912 (P & C's, for example), and maybe it is possible to put a 78 or
82mm VW crank in a 912 engine.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will tell
me, but I think you can do a lot more for a lot less money to a 912 motor
than you can with a later 911.  It's called the law of diminishing returns.

Subject: Cooling fan relays and the fountain of eternity

While all this discussion on cooling fan relays was brewing I was under
my '88 924S changing the radiator fan switch to one that trips at a lower 
temperature than stock, 82/77C versus 92/87C.  Having lost one engine 
(my old Buick) to overheating I have been "sensitised" to this issue.
The reason I bring this up is that I am looking at ways to extend the life
of my current engine.  The following is a summary of my approach with respect
to heat:

Since the 944/924 has such a small frontal area, not much space was available
for the radiator.  Hence a small radiator.  Therefor I try to make my radiator
as effective as possible.  I do this by lowering the anti-freeze to water
ratio from the standard 50/50 to 25/75 (anti-freeze/water).  The idea is that
water has a greater heat capacity than antifreeze and therefor can move more
heat out of the engine.  I was afraid of going below 25/75 due to the loss
in freezing protection (about  20F with 25/75).  This is sufficient for N.
California.  To prevent corrosion with this lower level of anti-freeze,
and to enhance heat transfer, I also use a product from Red Line called
"WaterWetter".  This coolant additive is supposed to improve heat transfer
from the engine to the coolant (see their pamphlet for a good explanation).

Additionally, as mentioned above, I have installed the new lower temperature
fan switch.  It seems from the few days that this has been in that it
keeps the fans on almost continuously in city driving but off during highway
driving.  Perhaps this is excessive but the temperature now stays between
the second (middle) and third ticks on the water temp gauge.  Previously it
meandered between the second tick and the upper orange region.

During track events the temperature has gotten into the orange region
and stayed there for extended periods of time.  I will have to see if this
is not helped by the new anti-freeze/water ratios.  The new fan switch
should have no effect during racing though since the car is always moving
at a rapid rate (I hope).

I would appreciate any comments, suggestions, or insights on my search
for eternal engine youth.

Dear Pete:

         Well, the truce you wanted sure didn't last long.  Are you from
North Korea originally?   Sure looks like you want to  pick a fight, judging
by your insults and other babble.

Since I'm building a Legal (note the "Legal" part) vintage race engine for my
Customer who's been vintage racing his STOCK MAESTROMASSAGED ENGINE and
WINNING against various high-buck modified vintage engines, perhaps I'll let
HIM tell YOU the Story of this Typical Engine as he just sent me a fax of his
Story he's sending to Pano and the Registry. Needless to say, he's very happy
with his engine, and his Story I might use in my advertising, as it is ad
copy I can't buy- it comes from the Satisfied Heart of a Customer.  Do you
have any satisfied Customers?

     As to your nasty comment about "anyone can peg the tach at idle," that
may be true, but how then do you explain that the SPEEDO was also PEGGED at
the time!  Yes, the car was actually moving!  And the tires were stock too. 
And, yes my Street motors do have more low and mid-range Torque, but they
still pull to 6,000 RPM, which as you know is 120MPH.  Have you been taking
your medicine regularily?

     As to your "Challenge", I don't know if you know this or not, but
building a Race motor is not something one does overnight. Well, OK, I'm sure
YOU could do it, as you apparently can do ANYTHING overnight, but I'd like
this engine to last as well as the Stock one did- say 4 or 5 years of racing,
so it will not be an overnight project, as I must work for a living.
    As to your little error in mathematics, since HP required to cruise
faster goes up as the CUBE of velocity, and 120/115= 1.0434 and 1.0434**3=
1.136, and ifin 100HP is required to do 115MPH, then the increase is 13.6 HP,
not 25HP.  A slight difference of a factor of two in your estimate.
     As to your comment that 356's are "not rare" and that you can find half
a dozen a week", geez the San Jose Mercury hasn't had ANY 356advertised for
sale in several weeks. So much for them being  readily available and a dime a
dozen. And besides, I was talking about 356 ENGINES- specifically a Super-90
engine that IS pretty damn rare and hard-to find (you gotta get three
Super-90's to have enough parts to build one), and that you don't want to
blow up on the race tracks is you give a hoot about 'em.  I just don't like
to see good equipment abused. Used yes. Abused no.
     As to your assertion that repro parts are just fine, thank you, I think
you'll find those "German" cranks might really be cast cranks from Brasil.
And I sure wouldn't trust the Brasilian connecting rods. And the new 200mm
flywheels machined on an NC machine look nice, but ifin you look verrrryyy
carefully, you'll see that the ring gear teeth don't have the reliefs that
the Original ones do. Oh, and Original Flywheels are available at Automotion,
for a mere $1000 for a 180mm. Don't believe me? Check out the new Automotion
catalog. Maybe YOU can spend a grand for a 180 flywheel and spin it off  on
the track, but the rest of us who work for a living might not have that
alternative.

      Oh, and cases may well be readily available, but a GOOD case is hard to
find!

      With regard to "Style". Hey, at least I have one!

Subject: MOTOR MOUNT FAILURES

Christopher,

The vibration you hear is not a motor mount failure.  The
failure mode for 944 motor mounts is this:  at idle, the
steering wheel vibrates in 1/8 inch vertical motion.  When the
engine rpms reach 1500-1800 rpm, the steering wheel stops
vibrating.

The usually failing mount is the right hand side one, near the
exhaust manifold.  Replacement with the 944T mount is
recommended.

Your problem sounds like it might be an exhaust system
vibration, possibly a loose bolt or some interference with the
body.  Of course, it would help if you could post a WAV file
with the sound so we could hear it... :-)

Another possibility, although very slim, is that one of your
balance shafts has gotten out of time with the rest of the
shafts in the motor.  That would, however, require either a
failure of the balance shaft belt or someone having disassembled
and reassembled that assembly, but you did not indicate that...

So, look for an interference, especially one that might occur
when your driveline is torqued (under moderate acceleration...)

 Restoration Design have fender flares in steel for the 911 series of
cars, these are about $ 130/piece if I remember correct.

You should weld them I,but you could of course use fiberglass
and rivet them(....cheapo).
You use the new flare to mark in the fender where the flare is going,
be *very* careful and pedantic when marking. 

When you've marked the edges of the flare you must remeber to cut
about 20 mm (3/4") lower tham the marking.
You'll need this for the overlap.

Use a flange tool,it puts a step in the fender such that the new
flare levels with the fender.Then drill holes (or use a punch tool)
every 5 cm (2") on the outer perimeter of the flare.

Put flare in place,spot weld through the drilled holes.

Be sure the joints are sealed.
Use little amount of filler in the (hopefully) small gaps in the
joint, or even better if you could lead it. 

Be very careful with the marking and fitting, and I guess you'll have
a turbo conversion that is impossible to tell is done in aftertime.

The overlap can be down to 10mm if you are very careful when
marking and trial-fitting. Spray a layer of zinc-primer on the fender
flange, and also on the flare,this primer will allow MAG welding afterwards.

cheers,
trond

From doing heavy research into 911 to 930 conversion kits, I have learned
quite a bit about what kits are out there, and how the conversion actually
takes place.  I'm having an '81 911SC Targa -> 930 conversion done now.

As far as price is concerned, I have not bought a single fender, just a
kit with all 4 fenders, rocker extensions frt. + rear, and rear fender
extensions.  The best kit around is from AJ USA Inc.(aka Alan Johnson Racing).
located in San Diego.  Call ???-555-1212 for their number, don't have it here.
AJ USA sells more Porsche conversion kits than anyone else I have heard.
They are just as good as the factory kits, and cost much less. Around $1K
for everything, Galvanized.  You can also shop around in many places listed
in the back of Excellence, but I think many places get their kits from AJ
and then tack on some more $$$$.

Next, go with steel, not fiberglass.  I have talked with 5+ people that
have each done 15+ conversions a piece, and they all have told me to go with
a steel kit.  Fiberglass resonates more, and down the line can end up
craking the paint and giving you problems.  They have to glue it on to the
old fender.

As far as how they are put on, I have not done it myself, but at this point
in time, I feel as if I could from the homework I have done.  When the kit
or flare(s) come in, put it up to the side of the car where it will go.  
It should fit up snug and match the contours of the existing fender at the 
edge where it will be welded to the fender.  

Next, when the conversion is started, the person doing it holds the flare
in place on the fender after positioning it exactly where it should go by
drilling a few small holes through both flare and fender and screwing it to 
the car.  This is one way.  In this way, next a cutter is used to cut through
both the new flare, and the old fender, where the edge of the flare meets the
existing fender.  I think about a 1/4 inch of the new flare is cut off, thus
giving it a smooth edge, and a matching edge with the original fender.  Once
the whole cut has been made, you are now left with a flare the will fit into
place where the old fender edge once was.  The flare is then welded into place
with the edge of the flare butting up against the edge of the fender.  That
is basically how they are put on.  It takes experience with a cutter and
welder and I would never try something like this myself unless I knew body
work and had alot of experience.  Remeber, your cutting the fender off a
Porsche with a saw, you better know what you are doing, the damage if you
f--- up is going to cost time and $$$.

The other way to put the flare on is to hold them in place with clamps and
use a marker and draw a line along the edge where the flare meets the
original fender.  Then remove the flare, and cut along the line.  Then
weld the flare to this edge which should be a close fit to the flare.  This
method is good if the edge on the flare is nice and smooth, like a factory
kit.  AJ kits I guess are ok for this, but speak to a pro about this.
Most places I talked to use the cut flare and fender at the same time method.
This ensures an edge on both abbutting peices that is the same.

After welding is done, the fender is in place.  Next, grind down the excess
weld spit that sticks up, and use body filler to fill in any holes or pits in
the weld, and smooth over the edge where the weld took place.  Sand it smooth
and theorectically, you now have a flare in place that looks just like you
had a fender that was original.  Again, I think it is easier written here than
done.  I would have someone do it, unless you know bodywork.  Each of the
people I talked to had to do their first conversion once too.  Maybe you
could have a pro do one fender for you while you watched.  That would let

From doing heavy research into 911 to 930 conversion kits, I have learned
quite a bit about what kits are out there, and how the conversion actually
takes place.  I'm having an '81 911SC Targa -> 930 conversion done now.

As far as price is concerned, I have not bought a single fender, just a
kit with all 4 fenders, rocker extensions frt. + rear, and rear fender
extensions.  The best kit around is from AJ USA Inc.(aka Alan Johnson Racing).
located in San Diego.  Call ???-555-1212 for their number, don't have it here.
AJ USA sells more Porsche conversion kits than anyone else I have heard.
They are just as good as the factory kits, and cost much less. Around $1K
for everything, Galvanized.  You can also shop around in many places listed
in the back of Excellence, but I think many places get their kits from AJ
and then tack on some more $$$$.

Next, go with steel, not fiberglass.  I have talked with 5+ people that
have each done 15+ conversions a piece, and they all have told me to go with
a steel kit.  Fiberglass resonates more, and down the line can end up
craking the paint and giving you problems.  They have to glue it on to the
old fender.

As far as how they are put on, I have not done it myself, but at this point
in time, I feel as if I could from the homework I have done.  When the kit
or flare(s) come in, put it up to the side of the car where it will go.  
It should fit up snug and match the contours of the existing fender at the 
edge where it will be welded to the fender.  

Next, when the conversion is started, the person doing it holds the flare
in place on the fender after positioning it exactly where it should go by
drilling a few small holes through both flare and fender and screwing it to 
the car.  This is one way.  In this way, next a cutter is used to cut through
both the new flare, and the old fender, where the edge of the flare meets the
existing fender.  I think about a 1/4 inch of the new flare is cut off, thus
giving it a smooth edge, and a matching edge with the original fender.  Once
the whole cut has been made, you are now left with a flare the will fit into
place where the old fender edge once was.  The flare is then welded into place
with the edge of the flare butting up against the edge of the fender.  That
is basically how they are put on.  It takes experience with a cutter and
welder and I would never try something like this myself unless I knew body
work and had alot of experience.  Remeber, your cutting the fender off a
Porsche with a saw, you better know what you are doing, the damage if you
f--- up is going to cost time and $$$.

The other way to put the flare on is to hold them in place with clamps and
use a marker and draw a line along the edge where the flare meets the
original fender.  Then remove the flare, and cut along the line.  Then
weld the flare to this edge which should be a close fit to the flare.  This
method is good if the edge on the flare is nice and smooth, like a factory
kit.  AJ kits I guess are ok for this, but speak to a pro about this.
Most places I talked to use the cut flare and fender at the same time method.
This ensures an edge on both abbutting peices that is the same.

After welding is done, the fender is in place.  Next, grind down the excess
weld spit that sticks up, and use body filler to fill in any holes or pits in
the weld, and smooth over the edge where the weld took place.  Sand it smooth
and theorectically, you now have a flare in place that looks just like you
had a fender that was original.  Again, I think it is easier written here than
done.  I would have someone do it, unless you know bodywork.  Each of the
people I talked to had to do their first conversion once too.  Maybe you
could have a pro do one fender for you while you watched.  That would let
you in on all the secrets, which I have no clue about.

Good luck, let us know what you find out.  Has anyone on this list actually
done this?  How good was my resucitation of how it is done?  Pointers?

I had the same MFI on my '81 VW Rabbit ten years ago.  It was absolutely
trouble-free.  The annual smog check was the only attention it needed (the

  Damon and 914 gang, I took both of mine apart a couple years ago.
  Alas..there is no information on the retractor in the factory
manuals.  And since i had a junk one -i dissected it.
  
  I know the safety implications, and its hard to argue with Damon's words..
  But these retractors are so simple inside it is difficult for me to 
beleive they cannot be recycled.  My observations discovered no damage, only
slight wear patterns, *very* slight.  Other than the nylon webbing fraying
from use, what is the big deal about replacing the belt, cleaning/lubing
the reel and reusing?  (use kevlar thread and a synthetic instrument oil)

  I recall only 3 moving parts inside the reel brake,
and the spring is muscular but not impossible to manage [but i did have
sore hands for a week].  The spring clabbers up..and makes the retract slow.

  If anyone is interested, i have an article i wrote at the time (in my 
usual *windy* style..:-) describing in enough detail to either empower you
or scare you off.

Somehow I don't remember my 912 having such horrid 0-60 times.  More like
around 8-9 seconds I believe.  Remember too, a 911 of the same period was
not quite the more-or-less-powerful and less-or-more trouble-free creature
as an SC or newer car.

Don't get me wrong, I prefer my SC, but loved the 912 as well, until
old-age and my lack of maintenance funds forced me to trade the car for

Subject: 944 Subwoofers


I am thinking of mounting two subwoofers in the rear of my 944. It seems 
like mounting them over the two side cavities at extreme rear of the car 
would be the best place for sound and convenience. The cavities would 
provide quite a bit of exclosure space for good bass response. After 
trimming the carpet and sound insulation and building a wooden baffle 
covered with speaker cloth, there would be no less cargo room in the back. 
Since I have removed that silly roll-up cover from the rear anyhow, I should 
have no problems hearing the speakers from the drivers seat.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of speaker mounting?

Were the results good or bad?

My deck has a 17 Watt x 4 channel amp  built in. I am using the front two 
channels to power the stock console-mounted fader which divides the power 
between the two pairs of stock speakers mounted in the doors and in the side 
panels in the rear seat-shaped luggage compartment. The rear two channels of 
the amp will power the two subwoofers that I plan to install.

I am not looking for sidewalk-shaking power, just better bass. Does this 
sound like a good idea?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Cooling fan relays and the fountain of eternity 


From: waitz2@siarc.com (Anthony A. Waitz)

While all this discussion on cooling fan relays was brewing I was under
my '88 924S changing the radiator fan switch to one that trips at a lower 
temperature than stock, 82/77C versus 92/87C.

(snip)

Perhaps this is excessive but the temperature now stays between
the second (middle) and third ticks on the water temp gauge.  Previously it
meandered between the second tick and the upper orange region.
- -----------------

Sounds like the thing is running way too hot on a regular
basis to me.  My (and other) 951's will nearly always 
have the temp needle pointing very near lower tick
moving toward second tick in slow city driving.  
of course it will move higher in trafic jam ect.

My guess is that you need to check the thermostat, hoses,
radiator, and other passsages for proper function and flow.

I get concerned when the needle on the temp gauge goes
higher then the MIDDLE tick.  And pull to side of road
when gets to the orange area (happened once when hose blew).

As mentioned before I added a manual switch that activates
fans via relay for when I get into a trafic jam.  works
great without excessive fan running time.

Good luck

Good Day Milo

	Thanks for the info!  It will be valuable when I make the
attempt to change my MM.

	Looking through the service records for this car I noticed somthing very
strange.  Whithin a two or three day period THREE MM where sold
to my car.  Each had the 951.375.042.05 part #.  But only the passsenger
side mount had a bill for installation.  Seems to me 
the dealer took Porsche NA for a warantee scam ride.
Maby I can hit up Scotsdale Porsche for the two MM they
billed for but did not deliever.

	That repair was before I bought the car, 
but about a year after that
repair the thing started vibrating like haties again.
That is outrageous a service life of ONE year.

	Last week I got hold of a mount <thanks Jim Pasha> 
with the .01 #.   I tore it apart to see how it was made, and then hit the
ol textbooks on how the damn thing is supposed to function.
It appears that the synthetic rubber its made of
'wears out' from absorbing the vibrations of the engine.
the rubber changes the vibs to heat via hysterisis loses
and eventually goes to pot.  But damit ONE year is  absurd.
	The funky liquid in center serves as a damper also. 
I will guess it is 'tuned' to some range of vibs.
but the fluid has not to do with MM failure, its that
whimpy rubber 'cup'.

I plan on figuring a way to make my own rubber doughnut
for the thing after some more research.

Subject: Re: Parade Rally


Randy and other Novice Rallyists,

Parade rallys are (in my experiences) constructed in a manner that make it
reasonably difficult to get lost. The tricks used will take the inexperienced
rallyists off course to mess up their time and then back on course without them
knowing what happened. Here are my recommendations for novices.

 - Leave the calculator at home. Bring a digital watch with seconds, a
  clipboard, pen/pencil, and a highlighter (used to mark completed
  instructions). 

 - If a practice rally is provided at the Parade, do it (several times if
  necessary). If they have an instructional video in the hospitality room,
  watch it. The questions that people have sent to the Rallymaster will be
  posted in the hospitality room; read them.

 - If the speedometer/odometer in your car is fairly close to the rallymaster's
  (as determined in the odo calibration part of the rally), don't worry about
  making corrections to your speeds. The odometer corrections are more 
  important.

 - If you get lost, go back to where you were sure you were on course and try
  again. 

 - Don't follow the Porsche in front of you. At the Colorado Springs rally (our
  first Parade rally and only our second or third rally ever) we
  came to the first T and didn't know which way to turn. We watched 10 cars
  go right and one go left, so we went right. We should have gone left. Also,
  when there are 300 cars doing the rally, the route may overlap and you are
  following someone that is 50 instructions ahead of you.

 - Consider the rally a success if you finish it, finding all the checkpoints.

 - If you can find an experienced rallyist to talk to before the parade, ask
  them to show you some copies of rallies they have done.

 - General rules for inside the car behaviour include: Don't argue. If 
  "discussion" is needed, pull off the road and decide what to do. If the
  navigator says they saw a landmark and the driver should turn, the driver
  should turn (not question where the landmark was, as I did _once_). 

Well, I've said enough for now. If you can't get a set of rally instructions
to look at, I can dig up a set from past Parades or one that I set up recently.

Re: Duralube

Ok, I haven't seen anyone else respond to this, so I'll stick my neck out.
I'm not a professional mechanic and I haven't used duralube, but I'm an
amateur skeptic, so my opinions are coming from their infomercial.

First, on the test with the weight on the bearing machine, I don't think
that is a relevant test, because they were using the spray-on lubricants
which are not designed to be used in these cases.  I would think it would
be better to have like a pan underneath, filled with any kind of engine
oil, or the duralube bottled (not spray), and rig a nozzle to pick up
and squirt oil onto the bearing constantly.

Then, everybody's amazed that the inline-6 engine they brought would run
without oil or water.  The thing was only at idle, they only show it running
for about 10 minutes, I don't think all the water will come out of the
block, they spray the hell out of the outside with cold water, and the
valve cover is off so that a lot of water is then in the oil passage which
could also reduce friction for a few minutes.  Also, who knows what's inside
the block?  Personal story: A friend of mine had a '78 mazda glc with way
over 100000mi on it.  He had to move the car from his apartment's lot because
of complaints (where he had to park it and how it looked).  He drove it,
without the belt going to the water pump and fan, for 50 miles to another
lot (at school) with me following just in case.  The temp outside was in
the 20's, and he said the needle never went over the lowest mark.

Also, they have this race car driver who says his oil pressure gauge went
to 0 and he kept on racing with no ill effect, thanks to duralube.  Well,
I may be going out on a limb here, but he never says he actually lost oil
pressure, just that the gauge went to 0.  Maybe the gauge was bad.  The
host (who we never see with the driver) is the one who says that he drove
without oil pressure.

Since it is rare to either lose all your oil or to have your pump die, plus
you have a gauge and/or big red light to tell you the moment something's
wrong, take the $35 you would have sent to duralube and get a AAA membership,
and pull over immediately if you have an engine problem.

all IMHO

Subject: retractions galore

Well, having been thoroughly told by several people that I was wrong about
912 engines, I admit my ignorance and retract my statements to stave off any
future possible flames.  You have been warned.

Although, I still don't know why (provided the parts are available), one 
cannot bore out a 912 case for larger pistons.  I know that either 85.5 or
86 mm big bore kits are available from Tweeks, and that should give a few
horsepower (which, when you are dealing with a 912 engine, is a large increase
percentage-wise), and changing exhausts and carburators will let the engine
breathe better (having someone *knowledgable* port and polish your heads will
do a lot here as well), and I'm positive that there are hotter camshafts 
available as well.  The issue is doing things right, and not just slapping one
part on at a time, but blueprinting and thoroughly thinking out what combination
of modifications will help your engine get more horsepower, but still run and
idle well without overheating.  In fact, there will probably be a lot of tuning
that occurs after this hypothetical engine is assembled, to make sure that 
everything works well together (at least as well as the original engine).

If anyone thinks this advice is wrong, please feel free to inform me of this
fact, but I have limited experience with 356/912 engines (I've helped assemble
and tune a couple), and far more experience with VW engines, so this should
be taken into account when listening to my advice, or responding to it.

	 I found a plate with two threaded holes welded in place on the
passager door on both my '73 914S and '75 914.  The holes, while
accessable from the inside of the door, are covered over by the
sheet-metal skin on the door.  So, you have to do some major door
disassembly but its worth it.
	In order to locate the holes accurately on the outside, use a
small center punch from the inside being careful not to damage the
threads.  Then drill a small hole, for the hole saw, from the outside
where the center punch marks are.  You may have to dimple the sheet
metal from the outside the keep the drill bit from wandering.
	Next, there is a set of neat minature hole saws that body shops
use to drill out spot welds on assembled sheet-metal panels.  These
hole saws are just like the ones you use for your 3/8" electric drill,
only smaller.  They have a centering spike which help keepd the hole
saw from wandering, that where the pilot hole we drilled comes in. 
Pick a saw that will cut a hole the same size as the stock mirror's
holes on the driver's side ( I don't remember exactlly but it's in the
range of 6 to 8 mm).  I found that once I cut through the skin, the
sheet-metal came right out.  Clean, primer and paint and it will look
like the factory did it.

  The original was in one piece, but torn loose from the wall and aggravating

I'm planning to get a new stereo for my 944.  Which CD changer units have this

Harry,

   This is one "gentle reader" who is dying to know the details!  Who is the
customer with the race motor and where can it be seen?  I was just at the
CSRG vintage race at Sears Point (March19 & 20).  Not a Maestro "massaged"
motor in sight, though there were at least six 356's racing.  This week
it will be the SCCA at Sears Point.  Any chance that we can see a Maestro
motor in action there?  

   Enquiring minds also want to know why a "famous band leader"  (hows that
for a pseudonym) seemed to buy up a majority of NPR piston & cylinder sets;
while simultaneously authoring an article in the Registry about their (NPR's)
product discontinuance AND running an add that states that a famous band leader
is getting out of the business after +20 years!!!!!  Was it also a coincidence
that the same famous band leader was also seen and heard at local swap meets
hawking NPR sets for a meer $500 dollars.  Of course they were a deal compared
to those "expensive ones" in the AUTOMOTION catalog (where have we heard this
price comparision before????) 

   I can understand why you consider the 356 a "rare" and expensive car.  It's
a good story to sell them along with the parts.

Subject: RE: 944 Subwoofers

Although I have not done what you describe yet, it is my intention to 
do so (as soon as I can find a warm weekend to do it).

I was planning on making a pair of fiberglass shells that would sit in 
each of the cavities behind the rear wheel well.  I figured I would 
then mount a piece of 3/4 inch plywood at an angle over the hole to 
allow a 10 inch subwoofer to fit.  I know I am going to have to port 
the enclosure too but I haven't really sat down and figured out the 
geometry of how to fit the speaker and port into the small amount of 
space.  There might be a better way to seal the cavities than 
fiberglass.  There is an open hole in the bottom of both of the 
cavities in my 87 944.  The cavity also gets wider as move up from the 
bottom.  There might be some issues about sealing it at the top too.

Please let me (and the rest of Porschephiles) know what you end up doing.

Bill.

pesky little miss in the FI a Couldn't get rid of became so bad that the
car was undrivable. After fiddling with the help of an expert for over a

I've found the PCA broker (Leland-West) to be very competitive on

You have to be a PCA member (no biggee, we all should be anyway),

I haven't seen or done this.  My biggest concern would be moisture build-up
affecting the speakers.  Avoid paper cones.  Poly or carbon fiber cones
would be much more moisture resistant.

| the amp will power the two subwoofers that I plan to install.

The following information gleaned from discussions with my local high end
audio dealer and tempered with my own dabblings in high end audio.

Integrated deck amplifier power ratings are grossly exaggerated, at least with
respect to high fidelity music power.  Total harmonic distortion (THD) is the
accepted measure of output quality at any given power level.  High fidelity
amplifiers typically have a THD at rated output in the hundredths of a percent
range.  Car deck amplifiers have a rated power THD in the tens of percent
range.  This is a factor of ten thousand times more THD for a car deck at
rated power.  So, while 17 watts may seem like an adequate amount, it
really isn't.  You will probably only get a couple of watts at acceptable
distortion levels.  It certainly would not be enough to drive 
sub-woofers.  Also,
you would want to run the sub-woofer signal through a low-pass filter so it
doesn't have to cope with mid and high frequency signals that they are not
designed to handle.  The power in those frequency ranges is just going to
be converted to heat in the speaker voice coil which, besides being a
waste of power, could actually be bad for the speaker.

On the other hand, car amplifiers from reputable hi-fi manufacturers have
much more reasonable power ratings wrt THD.  For instance, I have been
looking at a Kenwood 4x20 watt amp that sells for $150.  The 20 watts is at
a fraction of a percent THD.

Are you sure your deck actually has 4 separate power amplifiers?  Many
decks have only a stereo amp and then feed its output to a fader to give
four channel output.

If you are willing to spend the $$$, then consider using an electronic 
crossover
to produce the low-end signal for the subwoofers and a separate 4 channel
amplifier with two channels for the regular speakers and the other two for the
crossover output going to the sub-woofers.

You might also consider skipping the subwoofers and just replace the door
speakers.  The stock door speakers (at least the Blaupunkt (sp?) units 
on my '84
944) are junk.  I replaced them with Boston Acoustics plate speakers.  They
cost $200 for the pair, and don't require *any* door surgery.  They improved
the sound tremendously at all frequencies and give robust bass.
This is with an otherwise stock Blaupunkt Monterey unit.  If you would like, I
could get you the speaker model numbers (I don't have it with me now).

I also want to replace my rear speakers as soon as I get the nerve to pop
out the rear quarter windows.  My friendly local body shop man insists it is
easy to do, but I want to approach this task cautiously.  You have to remove
these windows to remove the inside panels that cover the speakers.  I am sure
it will be worth the effort in improved sound quality though as I have the rear
speakers faded almost to inaudibility.  The Boston Acoustics make the
stock speakers sound absolutely pathetic in comparison.

ADC also makes excellent plate speakers but they are somewhat more
expensive.

So what is a plate speaker, you ask?  Well, these units project farther into
the car than a standard car speaker.  The only part that must be set into the
door opening is the woofer magnet assembly.  Thus, you can put a much
larger speaker into an existing opening.  It is the only way you can get a
quality speaker into a 944 door without having to extensively cut the door
panel and behind-the-panel metal.  I do not subscribe to the hack and
slash school of car stereo installation.  Especially not on a fine automobile
such as out beloved Porsches!

A little light comes on! Could it be that he's getting the idea? You bet I

No. I AM a customer. Not of yours. And I have a long list of _your_ unhappy

You can't have it both ways. You can't take a stock motor with stock venturis,
put in a cam that shifts the torque peak to lower revs, put thick spacers
under the cylinders to reduce compression and squish, and expect it to go 
faster. To go faster, you need more top end torque.

Too right, Herry. But I figure you've had 20 years to do it. And my challenge 
was not for a race motor. That's why, three months from now, I don't want to see
you roll some motorized hand grenade off a trailer in the high desert. I'm 
talking about my everyday driver, grocery-getter and weekend warrior. The same 
sort of engine you claim to have built on a regular basis for two decades. The 
same sort of engine that, by your accounting, is powering hundreds of
happy 356 owners across the country. Don't any of them want to come out and
play on Sunday? Isn't there some loyal customer in the Bay Area or better yet
San Diego who feels he must defend the true faith?

Your continuing description of how great this future racing engine is going to
be sounds like the computer software developer on his honeymoon. He kept
telling his new wife how good the sex was going to be, once they got it beta

Well, you know what they say, figures lie and liars figure. The proof won't 
come off a calculator, it will come off a top speed run at Mrs. Orcutt's
Driveway. Also, if you're going to split harrys and do this as a 
mathematical exercise rather than an actual test, where do you get 100 hp? 
The SC engine had 95 DIN hp, or 107 SAE hp. And have you ever dynoed one of
your motors? (Just asking...)

Oh, Hairy, you poor thing, twenty years of building engines and you still don't
know where to get parts. Scat and Moldex will make beautiful billet cranks. The
Carillo rods are infinitely better than anything ever put in a 356 or 912. The
200 mm flywheel you refer to is about $200, and if you ask Brad Ripley at NLA 
very nicely, he might put in the chamfer (not relief) for you. Otherwise any 
good machine shop will do the same for a few bucks. And other than slightly
lower mass and rotational inertia, why would anyone want to run a 180 mm 
flywheel on the track? There's a big jump from $200 to $1000, and you can 
carve a lot of weight off of a 200 mm. Yeah, I work for a living. That's 
why I'm careful not to blow my 356 budget on charlatans.

>With regard to "style," at least I have one!

Hari, stuffing a turkey into a tuxedo doesn't constitute style. You just get
an odd-looking penguin impersonator. Or perhaps, in view of the non-acceptance 
of various challenges, nothing more than a chicken.

Your excuses for not racing are invalid. Racing is the ultimate test, and
so far you have ducked taking that test. You have probably heard the old 
cliche about what happens when the green flag drops (the BS stops.) Bottom
line: stop BSing and come out and fight. Put your motor where your mouth is.

Perhaps my engine is running hot.  The oil intercooler seals
have failed twice now.  Both times scumming up the cooling system
with oil.  Perhaps my radiator is no longer working efficiently,
although last time the oil intercooler seal was repaired the cooling
system was flushed with "bilge cleaner" to get the contaminating oil

I still am using the original water pump at 70K.

Yeah, several of the PCA instructors remember this guy and his rolling
roadblock.  If anyone spun, it was because they were on the brakes to try and
avoid him.  Unfortunately, the PCA group had to share the track that day with
some BSR classes and it was maddening at times.  The track was wet from still
melting snow in West Virginia and having to contend with a fruitcake on the
track didn't help.

Kyle,

	Think about using closed-cell foam. It is the same type of foam that 
campers use to put betwwwn the sleeping bag and themselves. It comes in 
many colors, does not absorb water or other liquids(not resistant 
though-this may have changed, I don't know) I'm not sure about its heat  
resistance but it is *GREAT* at insulating and at sound deadening.

Hope it helps,

Subject: Re: 944 clutch

The 924S and normally aspirated 944's use a 225 mm. rubber centre clutch.
The 951's use a 240 mm. spring centred friction disk.  If you want a
spring centred disk, look to the 931 (924 Turbo).  Not sure whether
machining will be involved.

I have in the past recommended against such a conversion.  The spring
centred clutch certainly won't fail because of the rubber centre it doesn't
have.  However, if you abuse it you can indeed break the springs.  This
does indeed happen, and it is every bit as debilitating to the car,
probably more, than a failed rubber centre.

An advantage to the rubber centre is that it transmits less shock to
the transmission than does a spring centre.  Which is one reason why
951's chew more transmissions than aspiros.  You wanna talk expensive,
go price a 944 gear set.  Or call George "May I Call You Gary" Beuselinck.

I have only one thing to say.

Speed is relative.  All the really fast guys either went home or stayed
in the pitsto avoid the 2' deep puddle at turn 1.

I'm one of the guys who went home.

I invite Matt to be at the July CAR GUYS at summit point.  I'll be there
but more importantly there will be some really good drivers there.

Tell us Matt, what times did people get you at?   If you tell me I'll be
happy to tell you what times Bob William and Dan Dazzo turned the first
time behind the wheel of my lowly 911.

I'd tell you what I ran but since I'm just a novice it wouldn't be a
fair comparison.

Subject: Re: Boxster update



The motoring press in the UK has had a number of spreads
of the Boxster photographed in testing in Germany. The car is heavily
disguised as a 968, but is unmistakably the Boxster. The
articles claimed that four and six cylinder versions would
be available, with the 6 giving 240 HP from a multi valve head.
The very short front of the show boxster will be somewhat
elongated in the production version, and sadly the rather
cool headlights will be replaced by the 993 type in production.
BMW will be pressing the body panels, Porsche have reduced their
suppliers from 900+ to just over 300, and are investing heavily
in production engineering to allow the production of the 996 and
Boxster (986 I think) from many common parts, to make their
pricing more competitive. There are rumours that this vehicle will
debut late this year at a price of 29000 GBP. I suspect that sometime
in 1995 is more credible. As to the price, well the 968 club sport 
is less than 30k GBP, so I don't see any reason why the smaller, lighter,
productionised boxster should not be less, and therefore competitive
with the various offerings from various other manufacturers.

Subject: Re: 914 engine bay insulation.

Kyle,
You asked about the the sound-deadening insulation from J. C. Whitney.
I have bought this insulation and have installed it on the fire-wall of my 914. 
The insulation consists of a thin layer of dense material (plastic?), a
thicker layer of foam, and a layer of aluminum foil. The idea (I guess) is
the dense layer blocks sound,  the foam prevent vibrations from reaching
the firewall, and the aluminum rejects heat. The insulation comes with an
adhesive backing, but I kept the easy-release paper over the adhesive, and
instead installed the insulation with those funny pegs, just as the
original insulation was installed. Just as on the original, I made some
release slits to allow the insulation to conform to the shape of the
firewall; I sealed these with 2" aluminized tape.
I don't really know if this insulation blocks sound better than the
original jute insulation; I didn't make the comparison. It looks a lot
better, and doesn't get sucked into the cooling fan as the old insulation
did.

The Boxster is supposed to be in production by late 1996.  Power is to
be supplied by either a four or six, both of which are to be watercooled,
although I have read some reports that the four-cylinder engine may not
make it to production.  Pricetag is targeted for $40k (US).  Like you,
I am excited about this car.  My wife and I saving already for the car!
BTW, your local Porsche dealer should have posters of the Boxster.  I hit
mine up for a few!  I only hope they come up with a different name for
the car.  I understand the retro-naming, but it doesn't slide off the
tongue easily.  (Can one get any more picky than that?  A great car a

      If you get a used belt (for a 911/44/28) you can probably only trust it

The recent flaming thread that is going on, albeit hilarious and a
source of great personal entertainment for me, is yet another example
of something I notice to be a trend. Let me elaborate.

On several occasions, people have come onto Porschephiles "from the
business", either as shop owners, experienced engine builders or
people proclaiming vast experience in one of several art(s) relating
to Porsche. And it seems without exception this person becomes
involved in some sort of personal challenge to their credibility from
another porschephile, or in some cases many.

And then we see some of the old regulars humbly giving advice, day to
day, and they are respected and even prompted for their opinions,
and their responses are always appreciated by a majority of members
for their content and in some cases humor. They do not need to affirm
any sort of expertise, it is apparent.

Why is this?

   I recall reading in an issue of _European Car_ a couple of years back

   Uuh, Ted--Please note that they are talking about 1.6L (or smaller) 356

    The 911 is *significantly* newer, and was built for much more power.  Check
the HP ratings on the stock '66 911's, even.  The engine you just dumped was
from what, 1977?  That's 10+ years of improvements, on an engine that had

Also, I have seen many references to Fuchs wheels.  I know that this is a brand,

The Boxter will be arriving in the summer of 1996 as a 1997 model, the engine 
will be a six cylinder, and it has been said that there will be room for a 
radiator in the front (water, or oil???).  Of course it will be a mid-engined
roadster design, and will adhere as closely as possible to the concept car as
is feasibly possible.  It is undecided as to whether or not Porsche will make
a 4-cylinder version of the Boxter.  Word is that when the Boxter hits the 
market, the 968 will bow out, since they will be in direct competition with 
each other.

All this information was gleaned from an interview with Fred Schwab and Rich
Ford of PCNA in the May '94 issue of Excellence.

My 80 931 runs hot in the summer, too.  I live 1300 feet up a hill,
which doesn't help much either.  In the summer, in stopped city
driving or after arriving at my house the guage can be at or above the
third tick sometimes.  Last summer I put in a 25% glycol/75% water
coolant, and I did add the Red Line water wetter. It helps, but not a
huge amount.

I also found that the lower engine compartment cover helps noticably
to cool both the engine and the turbo by directing the cooling air
appropriately.  I have yet to try the manual fan switch or the lower
temp fan switch.

The most important cure, of course, is to avoid city driving... makes
me and the car much happier.

   I have a problem with my FI system a few years ago and I have several
"Brain-Boxes"  a 2.0 a 1.7 and one from a Volvo (Oh my.) and I tried all of
them and the car still missed and ran bad the problem turned out to be the
head temperature sensor.  I followed the testing procedure in the Haynes manual
and it was not what the book said.  After I removed it and replaced it with
a new bosch unit I looked and the numbers on the old one and they where not
the same So someone relaced it years ago and go one that was close.  After I 
replaced it the car ran so much better you would not believe it.

I'm looking for some insulation like this to mount on the firewall of my
Speedster replica.  How much was it?  

Another question:  I have a hole cutout in the firewall directly behind my
fan intake.  Any comments on whether this would aid the cooling of my engine
or would it actually make my engine run hotter.  My thinking is that I'm
sucking in road heat from under the car, so I think I'll seal it up and
see what happens.

Subject: Funny 911 noise


	I am getting a couple of funny noises in my 1972 911T Targa.  
The car has about 150K miles, but still runs real strong.  I 
change the tranny fluid twice a year, with 85/140; the engine 
oil every other month with 20/50 (new fiter every other change) 
and drive it daily, about 50 miles a week. 

	I've tried the local shops, but they can't seem to figure it 
out without wanting to dismantle something :(  

	The noise occurrs when I start it up for the first time on 
any given day, or if it has had time to cool off.  The noise is 
kind of a mid-range warble, coming from somewhere in back.  I 
can't hear it when I'm outside the car; I think that the engine 
noise might be masking it.  Now the fun part! If I put the clutch 
in, the noise continues for about 1/2 second and stops, like 
something that stopped spinnging (clutch stuff?).  Once the car 
is warmed up, the noise goes away.  It is more noticeable on 
cold mornings, even though I always keep the car garaged (but not 
heated)  The noise also varies with RPM.

	The other noise is kind of a thrashy rattle I can hear from 
inside or outside, and it also happens when its cold.  This one 
doesn't care whether the clutch is in or out, but does change 
according to RPM.  This noise also goes away when the car warms up.

	Part of the problem too is that I can't get to the shop 
while the noises are still going...

	If anyone could give me a clue, I would appreciate it.

PS: Does anyone have a front bumper/spoiler (Fiberglass is OK)
	they want to get rid of ?  I also have a fiberglass turbo
	tail I really don't want...

I can give a partial answer (left to right):

Carrera Cup

The last three do not seem to have garnered the "folksy" names of the first

Hello all, 

	Since my 914 is destined to have a six, and since it needs all 
the typical 914 rust repair now, all the recent talk of flares got me to 
thinking about where I might procure some steel GT flares for my 914 to 
include in all the bodywork that it is going to need so I only have to do 
this once. I am aware that Automobile Atlanta sells them for about 
$1500/set. Does anyone know where a set might be obtained for less (Mill 
Supply maybe?)--I'm just not that interested in giving George Hussey any  
more of my money than I have to and with the recent talk of flares, I 
have some misgivings about using the fiberglass ones.

There is nothing wrong with Italian sports cars, in fact there was nothing 
wrong with the 348 or the Testarossa that went home after one day with their 
tails between their legs from the 1st P.O.C event last february  at P.I.R.

It was the drivers that were the limiting factor,  affecting their progress 
round the track and holding up the field of Porsches. But they were 
considerate and responsible drivers and the Porsche drivers showed them the 
same consideration when passing them.

The problem with the Fiat interlude is not the car, it is the arrogance, 
stupidity and self confessed irresponsibility of the driver. No one, driving 
any sort of race  or track event needs to have to share a track with that 
whatever their nationality.!

I had 2 stock VW Golf GTI (US - Rabbits). The first had a
gauge that read like "Normal" i.e. in the centre. The second 
read high. After rebuilding vertually all of the intake  system
and the cooling system I found that basically the second car
functioned perfectly, the same as the first except a bad combination
of temp sender and gauge giving the way out readings. 

The giveaway in this case was the operating cycle of the radiator 
fans.... about the same for both cars (I think once every 2 mins).

The point I'm making is you should compare water temp readings against
another 951 if you can. (Using an electronic termocouple if possible).
Into the orange sounds a little hot but I'd take readings before opening wallet.

Fitting a cooler fan switch may only have the effect of over cooling 
your engine, to the extend (in the UK esp) of pushing up your emmisions
and making your engine run less effeciency. There is an optimum temp for
an engine to work at.

Subject: Why me? (long) More Fiat stuff

Steve Pilz,
  Wondering why you chose to respond to Steve Timmins note by sending flames
my way?  Because I own a 911?  Because I instruct for our region?  Because,
although I do go to Summit Point, I wasn't there for the mighty Fiat that
was setting new track records?  Perhaps because I decided not to be our
regions chief instructor?
  Now, in the event you really want to know if I personally wear gold chains
and lots of cologne, no I don't.  Do you? If so, does it go with the chip on
your sholder?
  For the record, when I'm at our events and anyone pulls stunts like Mr.
Fiat noted, they come off for a chat.  If they repeat it, they get to miss
all the traffic at the end of the event by going home early.  Doesn't matter
if they are driving a 914, a 911 turbo or a snappy door stop from Italy.
Track events are intended for instruction, not racing - we have a race
program for that, as does SCCA, IMSA, EMRA and others.  These days insurance
is too fragile to screw around.  Plus there are probably a few lawyers
lurking around looking to make some $ and I for one do not feel like being
involved in some messy lawsuit.
  IMHO, the Fiat story sounded like many others, someone shows up at a Brand
X event with a Brand Y car and goes out of his/her way to prove that the Y
car is as good or better than the X cars.

However, my mechanic advises me that cookie cutters are not good wheels,
as they are cast and not forged like the actual Porsche alloys (not Fuchs
replicas, but actual Porsche alloys) and suggests I keep my BBS RS 3 piece
wheels over replicas or cast wheels.

Are there any sources for used REAL porsche alloys?  I've seen some new

real Porsche alloys get?  Has anyone compared the quality of Fuchs replica

From: "Evans, Randy: GTA.ATG" <REvans@ott1.gta.doc.ca>
Subject: Summary: 944 Subwoofers


Thanks for all the replies about mounting subwoofers in my 944. My strategy 
will have several steps. First I will install the rear subwoofers and 
connect them to the two free channels on my deck. If there isn't enough 
power, I will then install a crossover and a separate power amp. If the 
resulting overall quality still requires improvement, I will upgrade the 
door speakers and rear seat speakers.

For the benefit of the net, I have paraphrased the high points of the advice 
I received:

Make a pair of fiberglass shells that would sit in each of the cavities 
behind the rear wheel well.

Avoid paper cones.  Poly or carbon fiber cones would be much more moisture 
resistant.

Use an electronic crossover to produce the low-end signal for the subwoofers 
and a separate 4 channel amplifier with two channels for the regular 
speakers and the other two for the crossover output going to the 
sub-woofers.

Replace the door speakers with Boston Acoustics plate speakers at $200 for 
the pair. ADC also makes excellent plate speakers but they are somewhat more 
expensive.

Plate speakers project farther into the car than a standard car speaker. 
 The only part that must be set into the door opening is the woofer magnet 
assembly.  Thus, you can put a much larger speaker into an existing opening. 
 It is the only way you can get a quality speaker into a 944 door without 
having to extensively cut the door
panel and behind-the-panel metal.

Replace the rear speakers by popping out the rear quarter windows to remove 
the inside panels that cover the speakers.

Professional stereo installers have installed subwoofers in the
side cavities of similar hatchback cars, such as the VW Corrado, to
good effect assuming you don't want to take up too much space. The 
installations included carpet covered bezels around the speakers that neatly 
filled up the cavities, looking almost like a stock installation.

The instructions I received from Crutchfield showed that this is a valid 
place to mount speakers in a 944.  You'll have to do some custom fabing, but 
it should workout okay.

17Wx2 doesn't sound like enough power for what you want though.  Use your 
head unit's preamp outputs to drive an external crossover/amp.

I have mounted a pair of M&M subwoofers on a 1 inch pine board and
contoured that to fit in the trunk of my wife's cavalier.  The results
were excellent even though the subs were firing thru the seat padding.

An active crossover with equalizer will also give a wonderful amount of 
control over the sound character. It also allows some 'customizing' the 
music to the acoustics of the car, and tune out the hairy resonances.

The amount of power a subwoofer needs is greater than the other drivers in 
the system.

Use good fasteners and locktite them to keep 'em from vibrating loose on 
down the road.  I hot-glued mine, its worked 4 years.

One subwoofer should be adequate!

I built a small enclosure for my 944 that fit just behind the two back seats 
it was around 21" long and 10" wide, and about 7" tall just skidding in with 
sufficient air space, I used a pair of fosgate 8" subs to fill the box. 
Installing a coil as well to prevent blowing the speakers and serve as a 
choke. Mounting in the small cavities was unappealing to me for several 
reasons, 1 it altered the originality of the car, 2 I would have to conform 
to the space rather than
make my enclosure as I would have liked to.

Be sure to measure the inside of the spaces and then check to see how much 
air space the speakers you want require. If not you may choose to use "free 
air" speakers which are designed to use an infinite baffle such as the box 
formed in the trunk of a sedan using the rear deck as a box, which is what 
you'll be doing in the little cavities.

Unless you plan to use very low wattage speakers like little 5.25"s you 
should really invest in a good amp like a soundstream or nakamichi. Infinity 
also makes a good product.

Thanks again,

Subject: VW to Porsche 924 parts compatibility


Recent discussions on JCWhitney got me to pick up my latest catalog.  Lo and 
behold they sell a door handle for late model VWs (Rabbits, Jettas, etc) for 
$20.  I've been without a working door handle on my 924 for 6 months due to 
the fact that the starting prices for a Porsche handle start at about $85 
new and $45 used.  That and I'm not convinced it's just a handle and I must 
take it to a mechanic due to my limits on time and technical expertise.

Any thoughts.  I'm thinking I'll spend the $20 just to see the JCW handle.

In the meantime, is there such a thing as a cross reference list of VW to 
Porsche part numbers?  I'm sure any dealer I contacted wouldn't tell me even 
if they knew one existed.

Another explanation for the gauge readings could be in the gauge
or the sender.  I don't have great faith in the accuracy of the 
instrumentation.

==========

A while back someone posted what temperature each tick
on the gage represents.  I wrote it 
down somewhere and will forward that info.

Hopefully you can compare the temp gage reading
and the when the fan cycles on/off
as you know the temp that the fan control
relay is 'calibrated' to.

This will give evidence if your gauge is
funky or your engine is actually running hot.

have you checked the thermostat?  It's a real
bitch to get at but may be worth the effort.

Also I think there was some sort of radiator 
upgrade available for 924/944.  I don't

Subject: Braking system - maintenance 

From: loukrieg@aol.com

Dear PC,

What seems to happen is that you get vapor in the caliper, which then of
course is highly compressible. Indeed, even now, _after_ a run group at the
track, if I have not sufficiently cooled the rotors, enough energy will be
conducted into the calipers while the car sits still to cause this to happen.
The practical result is not sticking brakes, but rather a _very_ spongy brake
pedal. This effect disappears after a period of time (cooling) which then
presumably condenses the vapor back into liquid. For reasons beyond my
understanding, after such a "boiling" incident, apparently all of the vapor
does not condense because some bleeding of the brakes is necessary to _fully_
restore the rock hard pedal feel of a normal system.

==========

ahh ok I see what your talking about.  Spongy pedal ok. 
I believe your correct.  

My brakes on the VW locked because
of a swollen hose and overheated fluid.

I will guess that a bleed is sometimes neccesary after an overheat
because of the 'incompresables' in the system.   Water and ??
get into the system and won't recondense, or recondense
at much lower temp than the brake fluid.

Water ?difuses?effuses? through the rubber and contaminates the fluid.
This causes performance problems and CORROSION.
This I know from HS shop, SAE papers ect...
(H2O also gets into the fluid in reservoir - I suck out and replace
that every year)

That is why a flush/bleed of the brake system is recommended every
two years.  There is a preffered sequence for this, I do not know it.

I've beed using CASTROL DOT4 brake fluid with the
 extra-high boiling point.

From: "Evans, Randy: GTA.ATG" <REvans@ott1.gta.doc.ca>

I am thinking of mounting two subwoofers in the rear of my 944. It seems 
like mounting them over the two side cavities at extreme rear of the car 
would be the best place for sound and convenience.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of speaker mounting?

=================

Yes, my 951 has been so fitted with very good results.
be sure to afix the woofers well so they dont vibrate 
against the sheet metal ect.  velcro, screws, dutz ect..

Subs take LOTS of power, use a low pass filter 'crossover'
and about a 60watts a chanel or more per spk.  My amp is
180/2 watts with internal low pass.
I use the line level (RCA) output from deck for the subs.
(17 watts could barely pull a sub)

I ran power, signal, and control wires to the amp at back of
car (hell of a job)

There is another guy in town that removed his spare 
and mounted his subs in the spare tire well. this works
very good as well.

Subject: Subwoofers


I understand that Idealist Innovations, 5960 S. Land Park, #306, Sacramento, 
Calif. 95822 sells a 8" woofer enclosure for the 911's.  Maybe they have 
something for the 944's.  There phone number is (916) 421-3123.  I read about 
this being done for a 911 in an Audio Magazine and seen their ads in the 
European Car magazine.

Does anybody know how much foot room is left for the back?  The enclosure goes 
on the floor just ahead of the rear seats.  Are there still enough room for my 
kids to ride back there?  If not, can the enclosure be easily removable to 
allow my kids to ride back there whenever I have to take my kids and put the 
enclosure back relatively easy?

This is one of the main reason for buying a Porsche, they have some kind of 
back seats for kids to ride in.  I can use the Porsche for taking the family 
out still.  Once the kids gets too big, then they won't want to ride with ole 
Dad anyway.  BTW the BMW 850 back seat doesn't even fit my kids nor me!

Thanks for any input,

Subject: 911 ignition contacts



	Just wanted to let you all in on a small discovery
	probably not new to ya'll.

	I'd started the Orange Monster one late work night
	(Friday naturally), put it in reverse, rolled about
	2 feet when the motor stalled. Turning the key had
	no effect and the dash lights were out so I figured
	it was the ignition switch.
	This knowledge didn't phase the remaining 'guys' in
	my department. They all KNEW that a jump would do 
	the trick, and that, as a girl (gorilla) I might not	
	know what I was doing. It was really late and I was 
	really tired, so, after a few attempts at jumps, I
	went home, tail between my legs knowing my Saturday
	would be spent trying to find a parts store open and
	stocked.

	This is where it gets good...

	I jumped the poles in the back of the switch and got
	the starter to turn, proving the switch bought it.
	Partsheaven was open and had the part ($80-no key).
	I was only 15 min. from there so snatched the part up
	hoping to get a key made that day or....
	The locksmith was proving to be a giant added cost/delay
	gremlin. I thought I'd go home and try to take the old
	tumbler out and use it in the new switch - then I'd 
	still be using only one key. With the old switch apart
	I could see that the mechanics of it were virtually
	bullet-proof. This makes the ignition switch a part that
	can easily be fixed *roadside*!!! 
	I only had to turn the contact plate 45 degrees, close
	the back and reinstall and I was back in the saddle.
	The next time you have an ignition switch problem (I'm
	sure this is year dependent) peek inside and maybe
	there's an easier way than that $200 new ignition switch.

	* A Word About Partsheaven - Hayward, CA *

	I believe that if you're treated right there 
	should be credit given. That's not only what they did -
	90-day cash back or store credit (even on an electronic part!)
	but they also are a great support tool. They also stock
	used as well as new parts. AND they're open Saturdays. I
	guess that if you don't look at mail-order as your main
	bread and butter you have actual compassion for the 
	customer. 
	Anyway - this is not meant as flames to any of our other
	fine suppliers of German hard-to-finds, but as a vehicle
	to raise a toast to the people at Partsheaven in Hayward.

Ted,

Well, I wouldn't agree with your mechanic that they're not good wheels! 
 Porsche makes/sells some of the best wheels in the world, in 
particular the best OEM wheels.

The forged Porsche wheels are lighter and stronger than the cast ones, 
but cast wheels are still very, very good indeed.

Perhaps you summarized your mechanic's thoughts for our digestion.  I 
hope his original comments to you included his reasoning and the full 
explanation.

Happy Motoring!

Reid, 

	I don't know if it would help, but there exists a heat resistant 
wrap that you might use to cover the exhaust system. I came to know about 
the stuff through some of my hotrodder buddies-they use it on the exhaust 
headers to keep the underhood temperature down-the difference that one 
can feel from inside the passenger compartment was truly amazing. The car 
seemed to have a little more snap, too. This makes sense to me as keeping 
the heat in the exhaust would tend to keep the exhaust velocity higher and so 
the engine should theoretically breathe easier.(this may or may not be 
correct, though) It takes awhile to put it on, but I think that this is a 
more refined solution to the problem then basically putting aluminum foil 
under your valence. If you are interested, let me know and I can track 
down my friends and see if it comes in a blanket form for the muffler, 
how much, where to get it, etc.

Hope it helps

Hmmm, after getting the post I sent, much of the humor I intended seems to

at them.  Now, drivers with bad attitudes is another story :->
 One thing does come to mind though, how come the local club that runs an
event at Pocono doens't want anything that wasn't built in Italy at their
event?  Because the Porsche drivers and, sin of all sin, the NXS drivers

     Something i wonder about:  The Porschephiles list membership is in the
   several hundreds, yet we hear from the same handful of people to near
   exclusion of the rest.  What is that silent MAJORITY up to??

This is just the common social development pattern for large
electronic forums.  It has been going on since my early days as a
subscriber to SF-Lovers and Human-Nets, two of the first
large-distribution Internet-based mailing lists.

You start with a small group of dedicated enthusiasts who form a
fairly cohesive "club" around their topic of interest.  The group
initially grows fairly slowly, usually through word of mouth.
Eventually there is general public awareness of the list and the
membership increases an order of magnitude from the original "club".
This has good effects and bad: you get a greater pool of people to
share their knowledge and generate ideas, but you also get a bunch of
newbies who don't have the shared experience of how things got
started.  Some even have their own agendas, not in line with the
original purpose of the group (witness the frequency of unsolicited
"broadcasts" to netnews groups and lists: everything from sales
pitches to religious diatribes (I have been waiting for someone to
send a flame castigating us all for driving gas-guzzling anti-social
cars, but it hasn't happened (yet))).

Throughout you maintain an 80/20 or 90/10 ratio of non-contributors to
contributors.  This is just a fact of life.  Presumably the silent
listeners feel that they are getting something out of the deal, and
the 10% don't mind performing in public.

For me, the really sad part comes when you realize that the majority
of the traffic is just repeats of debates/discussions that you saw a
year ago, and annually before that to the beginning of the list's
history.  A central repository of information, including message
archives and FAQ info, can help to stave this off, and Stan is to be
commended for the resources he devotes to maintaining this stuff.

My perscription for continued mailing list vitality:

Try to keep your own messages focused on the central topic (in our
case, our beloved P-cars).  Good manners begin at home.  Items you
think will be of general interest are probably OK, even if they aren't
directly about a Porsche.  Off-topic stuff about how badly Unix sucks
is discouraged (Stan is, of course, granted an exception from this
rule).

Avoid ad hominem attacks, even on obnoxious posters.  Correct factual
errors, or share your own experiences that contradict the original
claims, or post something else with constructive content, or change
the subject, or count to 10, or something.

Reply sparingly.  Ask yourself, "Is my reply likely to be relevant if
I wait until tomorrow or the next day to send it?"  If not, don't.
Also avoid replying to offensive or way-off-topic messages.  It just
add to the time-wasting digression.

I guess I could add: pray for better mail-management tools.

Oops!  This message doesn't have much to do with Porsches!

Having just helped flare a 911, and having recently flared two 914/6s
(yes, original 914/6s -- but using NOS 914/6-GT parts..) I have few
words on this.

Youre best quality will be a steel flare. You install by lining it up, 
drilling small holes, using aircraft rivets to fasten the new flare over
the old fender, then marking a line through the rivets, and using a
very thin cutter to slice throuh both at th esame time. A butt-weld later,
and you're home free... If you use a MIG welder, that is... Overlap welds
are evil and will cause rust. Brazing is even more evil, BTW.

For 914s, the original GT flares or repros look most authentic. You can 
put of to a 8" wheel under a GT flare, BTW. For raod racing, we use the
Beach Boys stuff. It's *EXPENSIVE*, but it's pretty good quality. My
big gripe is that the nose is one piece -- both fenders and the front
valance. A bump on one side can make you buy the whole things.

Fiberglass flares just don't hold up for the street. I've seen too many where
the adhesive has given way making for a very ugly car indeed... And if
you're really looney tunes, there is always the Chalon kit for the 914,
or the new Beach Boys Racing "Monterey" kit...

The flares that AA sells, and all of the other ones I know about are factory
steel flares.  The dies for them are worn out, therefore they do not fit real

will need new rockerpanels to match the flares, and also need to modify your
front valence, or get the GT front bumper package to match your flares.  BUT
steel flares are much better than glass as they will take more abuse without
ripping off.

George Hussey amy charge a few bucks more sometimes, but he has the parts in

Subject: New brake fluid

Hi, Mr. Schlesselmann.
 
Re your brake system --
 
There is apparently a better brake fluid coming onto the market. Porsche is
now using it for its original fill, and as a result they have increased the
recommended time between total system flushings from, I think, 2 to 3 years.
(Consider most cars on the road probably never had their brake fluid
completely flushed out). There was an article in the February 1994 issue of
European Car magazine, touting a German brake fluid, Pentosin Super DOT 4.
This is apparently the same stuff used by Porsche and presumably other German
new car makers, so I figured I'd try it. I flushed the entire system with a
liter of the stuff (cost $6.75) and went to a vintage racing school. There
was a very fast race-prepared 356 Speedster there, but with drum brakes (I
have discs) and he was having brake problems (overheating?). I experienced
no problems at all. No fade, no increased pedal travel. The Super DOT 4 is
mixable with existing DOT 3 and DOT 4 (i.e. non-silicone) fluids. It
absorbs less water and has less boiling point depression than other fluids.
 
Regarding heat transfer through the pads after a run, a few hundred yards of
cooldown will help. I often see smoke pouring out of the front wheel wells
of cars that I test. Some cars will smoke heavily after only three
successive hard stops from 60. I have even seen flames in there, probably
from the heat lighting off some leftover grease on a brand-new car. When
that happens, I just drive down the drag strip and back, avoiding brake use
and using the engine as a brake. That gets enough cool air going over the
brakes. Also, don't apply your parking brake when you're done. Leave the car
in gear instead.

What the fuck is with you guys?  Peter Albrecht and Ted Matsumura sound
like complete, flaming assholes, and I can't imagine why this kind of crap
is allowed to continue in this mailing list.

What's your point Peter and Ted?  OK, you win... you're both the biggest

to be his friend...  You're completely cool and really smart and I can't
wait to see your next oh-so-eloquent flame of The Maestro in this mailing
list.

What's the matter boys?  Are you jealous of The Maestro's visibility in The
Registry, or perhaps the business that he's built up?  The only way you can
deal with it is to publicly flame him on the Internet?

Grow up.  Fuck off.  You're both getting to be royal pains in the ass.

Subject: 356 challenge again

 
P-netters:
 
Opinion on the forum seems divided on whether to continue this
flamethrower fandango. About half the comments are in favor (presumably
these are folks who like a good bar fight or dwarf tossing) and half
against. For the bar fight crowd, here's one more punch. For those who
are (understandably) getting tired of all this, here's a reminder:
 
[WARNING: FLAME-SENSITIVE READERS MAY WANT TO SCROLL PAST THIS POSTING.]
 
The reasons I am continuing this are:
 
1) this self-appointed maestro guy has been spreading misinformation,
masquerading as truth, for years; time somebody called him on it, and
judging by the comments on this forum, I'm not the only one.
 
2) same maestro has been making unsubstantiated claims for his engines,
especially in terms of performance, power output and their competitiveness
in racing, which are inconsistent with the hardware installed in those
engines.
 
3) the self-appointed maestro has been using his forum in 356 Registry
to launch attacks on others in the 356 hobby and industry, respected
engine builders and parts suppliers, people who don't have any way to
respond. I enjoy seeing his inability to muster a coherent response when
confronted with rebuttal (both on a personal and on a rational level).
 
4) I want to goad him or one of his many allegedly satisfied customers
into a public contest to prove his engine claims. I understand that
Pellow may not personally want or be able to drive a car in competition,
but of many hundreds of customers, statistically, some of them must
certainly be game, and amenable to proving the worth of the master they
worship. Hence the challenge for a slalom contest, or a top-speed
shootout, street engine against street engine. I am at a disadvantage here;
there are hundreds of them to take a poke at me, only one of me.
 
5) This is a public challenge, hence the public smoke and flames. Enjoy it,
or scroll on.
 
The slalom is on Sunday. The challenge still stands, and there's time to
drive down from the Bay Area. And I suppose there are Pellow customers
in San Diego too. As somebody else on the forum pointed out, we never
seem to see these wondermotors in action. There are also items in
Pellow's last response that need to be addressed, (and a few good
openings that I just can't resist), so here's one (last?) response from
me.
 
BTW, I suspect that Pellow will remain true to form and use his Registry
column to respond to all this in a way that will again distort the facts,
draw a thinly-disguised caricature of me, and tell some sort of "story" which
makes him look like the misunderstood genius of the 356 world and everybody
else (self incl.) a fool. Rest assured, steps have been taken to ensure that,
if he uses the Registry for this, he will be dealt with in a most unpleasant
and fiscally uncomfortable manner.
 
 
Dearest Hari,
 
Glad to shine some light on your day. Hopefully the bright light of reason
blows out the cobwebs and smokescreens of your mind.
 
Speaking of smokescreens, it's time for your reality check again. (I
shouldn't have to be the one to do this job for you all the time...)
 
>I don't know why you have this hangup about "racing" engines, "top-speed
shootouts" and the like...
 
The hangup is all in your own synapses. I never claimed to have a racing
engine. Neither did you, for that matter. I claim to have a daily-driver,
go-to-market street engine which I have driven for 50,000 miles without
significant problems, and have successfully campaigned as a slalom car for
2+ years, with 2 drivers per event (figure 4 driver-seasons), and am now
considering driving regularly in vintage events. In fact, this is exactly
the kind of engine which you claim to have been building for 20 years. I
have challenged you to compare your street engine with my street engine. I
realize that my engine will not be competitive against purpose-built
vintage race cars; I merely intend to go out and have some fun with the
equipment.
 
>You seem a little afraid that I might take the time to build a "motorized
hand grenade" and beat you.
 
Exactly. Remember, street engine against street engine, that's the
challenge.
 
There are 2 logical inconsistencies in your story of the phantom customer
who has been racing a maestromasturbated engine for years and years. See if
you can spot the flaws:
 
1) >If [my customers] wanted a race engine, I'd build it for them. But they
>don't! (your message, 3/24)
 
2) >[My customers] want their engines to last -- like over 100,000 miles.
>And that's what I build. (your message, 3/24)
 
3) >...my customer... [has been] vintage racing his stock maestromassaged
>engine and winning against various high-buck modified vintage engines...
(your message, 3/24)
 
4) >I think racing is too hard on the equipment (your message, 3/13)
 
Figure it out yet? We've got time...
 
Now back to your engineering education.
 
>...putting shims under the Big Bore Kit cylinders to lower the compression
>to 9:1 is for longevity...without the shims, the compression can be 9.8:1
>which gives a life of 20,000 miles with the gasoline currently available at
>the pump.
 
Maybe it is 20K miles, with the crappy pistons you use. At $500 a set for
your hoarding of what used to be cheap $250 alternative piston/cylinder
sets, intended for people who didn't want to pop for the original
equipment, there are better alternatives -- such as Shasta or Arias pistons
in bored-out OE barrels. And now that Mahle sets are again available at less
than twice $500 which you apparently ask at swap meets, (don't quote
jewelry store prices to me; street price is about $800) your sets are
worth about $250 -- a fair price for cheap rebuild parts for customers who
just want a low-performance driver.
 
>I HAVE dynoed my engines -- the stockers [sic] on a chassis dyno produces
100 net rear wheel horsepower at 4600 rpm.
 
Go back to your slipstick. If your max hp is at 4600 rpm, that implies that
1) hp at redline is less than 100 net at the wheels; and 2) 4600 rpm equates
to about 92 mph, well short of 120. Power falls off rapidly above the
maximum horsepower; those are the facts of life with internal combustion
engines. If you are developing max hp as low as 4600, you won't have enough
left over to go 120 mph at 6000. And guesstimating overall drivetrain
efficiency at 90%, 100 hp net implies 111 hp at the crankshaft at 4600 rpm,
not significantly more than the 107 SAE the engines originally had and not
enough to make 120 mph at 6000 rpm. This is all irrelevant anyway, as only
an actual instrumented top speed test can determine actual top speed.
 
I called Jerry Woods, to see if he remembers your dyno tests. He will go
back through his records and if we find anything, I'll post it here.
Needless to say, he's not all that well disposed toward you since you
attacked him (in the form of "Ferry Forrest") in your Registry column.
 
>Chicken or penguin I'm not... What's the matter, you chicken? Bawk, bawk.
 
You talk the talk, Turkey. Let's see you walk the walk. Sunday, in San Diego.

Recently there was some discussion as to the rarity of the Porsche 356. The
self-appointed maestro wrote:

I just got back from a trip to San Diego (could it be I was scouting out the
course for Sunday's slalom? Naah...) While refuelling I browsed through the
San Diego and Orange County issues of the Sports Car Trader, which just came
out on Thursday.
 
Orange County has 10 356s for sale, ranging from a possible organ donor to a
restored Speedster. That's not counting two plastic replicas.
 
San Diego has 7 356s for sale.
 
And I haven't even looked in the Los Angeles or Inland Empire editions,
which would cover the 200 mile area I mention.
 
More are available, farther afield, through classifieds in the Registry,
Porsche Panorama, Excellence, and Hemmings.
 
Bottom line: 356s are not rare and need not be expensive.

Sorry about the smoke and flames. Bear with me, and maybe see this as a
cauterization process.
 
On 3/24 you wrote

I don't have a dyno sheet. I would guess my power at 120-125 hp. I will try
to get the engine on a dyno next time it comes out. There is a chassis dyno
available locally but I have my doubts about its validity. My next engine
will be dynoed, probably by Jerry Woods.
 
Jerry, whom Harry Pellow claims tested one of his engines, is looking
for those old dyno sheets of a "maestromotor."
 
>Just because someone does not personally race has no bearing on their

I agree. I feel that there are enough owners in Pellow's customer base that
some of them should have sporting ambitions. Slaloms aren't races; they're
parlor games for adults, and the cars aren't really at risk, so it shouldn't
be too difficult to find an owner of a Pellow motor who would like to put
this whole philosophy to the test. I feel that Pellow should be able to call
some of his customers and ask if they wouldn't like to prove their engines.
 
BTW I like your quote from Nolan and Beaumont, one of my favorite car books.
Most people aren't even aware of it.

Subject: Re: 944 Subwoofers

I too wanted to extend the low frequency performance of the audio system in my
'86 928S.  I suspect my "packaging" problems were roughly similar to those of a
944 owner, and I did not want to make any signficant permanent modifications to
the car, so here's what I did.

I bought an SAS Bazooka B82 (8") subwoofer for about $150.  This is a ported
enclosure in the shape of a black cylinder 18" long and about 8" in diameter,
with the driver and port opening at one end. These are also available with
built-in amplifier and crossover for another $200 or so.  The self-powered
version was favorably reviewed in Car Audio and Electronics a while back, and
the reviewer stated that the unit was good for clean output down to 30 Hz or so.
The unit is designed to face into a corner of the car, within 2-4".  

I already had a 4 x 60W amplifier with built-in crossover (Rockford-Fosgate
4060X with default setting for 100 Hz crossover), so all I had to do was run
speaker cable from the "low-pass" (2 channels bridged) side of the power amp to
the woofer.  The Bazooka is designed to be held down with nylon straps, so I
strapped it to a luggage tie-down hook already in the rear of the 928. This
arrangement takes up a small (relative to the interior of a 928!) amount of
space at the extreme rear of the car, not even peeking up over the hatch sill.

I can assure you that the audio performance of this setup is impressive.  A
particular interest of mine is realistic reproduction of pipe organ music, and
this setup performs magnificently with that material.  Along the way I tried the
6" version of the Bazooka, but based on both subjective evaluation and
measurement with a sound level meter and 1/2-octave spectrum analyzer, it's
performance was not as good, being about 1/2 octave shy in bass extension.
There is also 10" version which did not go any deeper, but is substantially
larger, so I settled on the 8" unit.

I see this solution as having the following advantages over a built-in solution
using raw driver(s):

1) Much less work.
2) Predictable performance, since the Bazooka's enclosure is matched by the
designer to the drivers.  With the raw 10" driver solution, how do you know the
enclosure volume is appropriate for the driver?
3) Rigid, inert enclosure.  Using part of the car as an enclosure has the
disadvantage that sheet metal, etc., is neither a rigid nor acoustically inert
material, both of which are critical factors in low frequency loudspeaker
performance. 
3) Very easy to remove from the car.
4) Cheap.  It's easy to pay more than I did for ONE 10" woofer driver.

The only disadvantage I see is the slight reduction in luggage space, but if
that's ever a problem, I can just undo the straps and either move or remove the
woofer.  This operation takes about 10 seconds.  The terminals on the woofer are
spring loaded, so electrical disconnection is nearly instantaneous.

I know this isn't a direct answer to the original question, but I wanted to make
sure the interested parties were aware of an alternative that, for me at least,
has worked very well.

Subject: CD in a Porsche

No 928 owners have piped up yet, so I will:

928's have what may be a unique problem within the Porsche family, which is that
an in-dash unit is mounted at about 45 degrees from vertical.  It turns out that
most in-dash CD-players really hate being mounted more than 20 degrees from
vertical (I've seen this specified both in a Sony and a Pioneer CD-player's
manuals; I don't know about Alpine).  Their reaction is to lose their ability to
track when jarred.  I had a Pioneer DEH-880 in my 928 which skipped on every
pavement crack, divider dot, and whenever I shut the glove box door. Yech! 

I was about to buy a CD-changer using the rationale that others have already
presented, when I noticed the recent ads for the Porsche CD-2 for $220 in
Panorama.  Reasoning that since this was an option in the 928, even in the
extreme mounting arrangement it must work OK (yeah right!) I bought one at my
local dealer.

Four comments after several months of happy ownership:

1) It tracks beautifully, never having skipped on any bump no matter how severe.

2) It does not include a power amplifier section, so I had to buy a separate
power amp.  It's output is for an 8-pin DIN plug (available at Radio Shack).  I
made my own DIN-plug-to-four-RCA-plugs cable, identifying which pins were which
with a voltmeter and a test CD I have.  If anyone wants to know the pinout let
me know. 

3) It's FM performance is not as good as the Pioneer; specifically its adjacent
channel rejection is not as good.  With the Pioneer I could pick up the LA
classical station from North County San Diego (100 miles distance). The CD-2
instead produces only a distorted version of the San Diego rock station that is
200 KHZ away on the next channel.

4) It looks cool, since it say "Porsche" across the front.  Inspection of the
back reveals that it's made by Onkyo.

I'm no 914 specialist, but I thought I'd throw a couple general ideas 
to try and help you.  Check ground straps and electrical connections 
for clean, tight contact.  Check/replace ignition trigger pickup (do 
you have anything fancy like Hall sensors on the distributor?).

Is the misfire coming from a spark plug not firing properly (a scope 
will tell you this)?  If the answer is yes, work your way back towards 
the brain to see where the fault is.  It's either specific to a 
cylinder (plug, wire, valve) or common across all of them (coil, 
distributor contacts, brain, insufficient voltage, etc.).

If the ignition system is OK and all plugs fire properly, then check 
fuel pressue, injectors (clog?), or maybe a damaged valve or ring.

Hope this helps,

I am considering purchasing a an 82 Euro 911 SC which was imported in 85 and
has documentation of the conversion including emmision testing values.  Maine
is going to a very stringent emmisions test this July in which vehicles will
have to meet the standards for which they were manufactured.  Does anyone
have experience with this type of testing and how it may affect Euro cars?

Kyle and 914 gang:

Sorry I didn't have a chance to reply, too crazy at work.
I been using a solid state voltage regulator from a 1980
Volvo on my 914/6.  I think Bosch made that regulator just for
Volvo.  I was trying to buy one directly from Bosch, a
Bosch place located in New York City.  On the new unit, the 
sealing tape printed Volvo on it. It looks just like our 914 regulator
but about 1/3 shorter. The connector is exactly the same,
no modification.  I replaced my 1980 242GT's alternator with
a later version with built-in regulator.  I installed the
original regulator in my 914.  You might want to check the
local junk yard for Volvo 240s around 1979, 80, 81.  The regulator
is located on the passenger side, just behind the headlights.

You should check to see if the FI points (in the distributor, BELOW the
regular points plate) are clean and oil free. These are commonly overlooked. 
I can't remember, but if this is a 1.8 vs. a 1.7 or 2.0, replace BOTH oil cap
o-rings.  These will make a 1.8 run real rough.  Also, route any FI harnesses
as far away from any ignition lines as possible.

Subject: update on 911S '77 + '78 project

Sorry I didn't make it to the nerd gathering last night, will try for the 
next one.  Hope it was fun.

Here's the progress on my baby, 356 owners can skip to the last sentence.

This week I got quite a lot accomplished with my 1977 911S (with 1978 3.0l
engine replacement).
 
I had a pair of 195/60x15 Nitto HR tires installed on my front BBS RS
wheels, and balanced.  This provided a world of difference, as the car
no longer shakes up to about 100mph on the freeway, and this week I hope
to get some Yokohama AVS Intermediates (195/50 x 16") for the rears, 
and have the car completely 4 wheel aligned.  I torqued the wheels to
80 lbs. and re-torqued them yesterday.  Interesting, only the left front
needed a little bit of re-torquing, maybe 10 lbs. per nut.
 
The silver Porsche hubcaps which were removed from my BBS wheels during
the balancing and tire install, are apparently too small in diameter for
the wheels.  The previous owner put some tape around the base, and used
some black putty to attach them, but I need to find a better way to keep
them in there, or a replacement hubcap.
 
I'm excited about the 195/50*16" tires going on the rear, as it's a
combo no one I know has ever tested in a '77 911S body with BBS RS 16"
wheels.  I've calculated the height and width, but you never know...
 
Another first that I may consider down the road is putting the 16" with
195x50s on the front, and putting the 195x50x15's on the rear.  Again,
no one I know has tried this combo on a Porsche before ever.  It could
be the biggest racing tip for 911s ever.
 
Incidentally, my Japanese teacher, Akiko-sensei is getting her masters 
at Stanford in Chemical engineering, and was in an accident a week ago 
from last Friday, it turns out that the company she works for in Japan 
makes the compounds for Bridgestone tires.  I gave her some Yokohama tire
brochures I had in my car, and asked her what she thought.  Currently, 
the ride in my car is a little rough for her, considering she had to wear 
a neck brace, and I don't think her riding in my car is doing her neck
and back much good.
 
I ended up taking her to the ER, and translating what the ER nurse and
attending nurse and MD had to say to her.  I wasn't much of a help, 
especially when the nurse told me to tell her to get naked inside the
gown, except for her underwear.  I was at a complete loss, but stayed
outside the sheet curtain, and tried my best to explain, and she said
"wakarimasu", so I think she was OK behind there.
 
Yesterday, I replaced my manual black antenna with one from Automotion.  My
original antenna had lost some material at the base, which allowed it to
sway.  If I had known the trouble it would be replacing, I would have left
it alone, or tried to find a work around with the existing, rather than
replacing with an Automotion replacement.
 
I thought it would be a simple matter, taking maybe an hour at the most.
It ended up taking most of an afternoon, with two people.  At several points
we considered taking the door off, and if I were ever to do this again, I
would, but we ended up able to remove the larger OEM one, and get the new
one in without removing the front left door.
 
The problem is that in the '77 911S body, there is not enough room to get
the original one out without scraping up the door edges which I did in
two places getting the old one out.
 
The Automotion one, if designed for a Porsche at all, was certainly not
designed for a '77 911.  The body is plastic where the OEM is metal.  The
radio connector is about a foot shorter, and the mounting hardware below
the fender makes it impossible to connect the above the fender hardware,
there's just not enough thread showing.
 
My German friend Sieg has a machine shop at his house, so we fabricated 
a custom washer for the below the antenna portion, accidentally cut a 
couple 
of wires probably going to the electric mirror, and ended up re-soldering 
them together with heat shrink tubing over it, and a plastic sheath over 
the whole mess as it flexes as the door opens and closes.
 
Another difficult problem replacing the antenna was getting the new radio
end back into the tight grommet.  Some soap, and pulling with pliers on the
inside helped finish this.
 
The antenna is now fine, but now I have to deal with some scrapes at the
door edges, and touch up paint alone won't do it, as it has caked off in
a couple of spots, so it needs some body material (putty?) and then some
touch up paint.  Anyone know of any good touch up shops for Porsches in
Northern Calif.?
 
Short term, I would like to cover the exposed pieces of metal with some 
kind of rust preventative substance, where I nicked the door edge.  Also,
I plan to take the car in to Tony for tach hook up, cold-start hook-up,
and maybe valve adjustment and overall tune up.  
 
Long term, I would like to get some more power in the car.  It looks like
I may have to replace the CIS with Weber 40 IDA-3C carbs, and find old
style exhaust system.  I hope I can find some of this at Partsheaven or
used, otherwise it sounds expensive.  The reason why I want to go this 
way is that it looks like the most cost effective way to get about 30
more hp.
 
After this, I will consider Mahle 98mm pistons upping displacement to
3186cc, possibly adding 40 hp here.  
 
My question is if after all the above mods, will I end up with:
 
180 hp	stock 3.0l
20 hp	old style exhaust
10 hp	Weber 40 IDA-3C carbs
40 hp	Mahle 98mm pistons
 
end result 250 hp?
 
What is the best order to upgrade in?  I'd like to do the pistons last,
since my engine is in good running condition now, and I hate breaking
what isn't broke, unless it's mandatory for more power.  If I get the old
style exhaust, for 20hp, then the webers for total of 30hp, can I then
wait until the top end needs a rebuild for the 98mm pistons? and final
40 hp?
 
What could I do to get the 3.0 l up to 270 (current hp of 993) ?  Is 
it possible to get that much hp from a 3.0 l engine?
 
I hope nothing above is going to piss off any 356 owners, if so, let me
apologize in advance.  Thanks for any suggestions.
 
Ted

I've not found the ad for the Porsche CD-2 in my Pano, but 
Pano gets here about 4 months late (loved the November edition

My 86 928 allegedly has a power amp in one of the "humps" adjacent
to the passenger seat. Did yours? If not, where did you put your
power amp? Any problems installing? Did you use existing wiring or
add your own? 

Did you install this yourself (I should RTFM, I know) or did a 
vendor/installer service do it?

Important question: does the radio use the US tuning specs (ie,
97.1, 97.3, 97.5.... MHz) or Euro (97.1, 97.2, 97.3, etc)? This
matters a lot since I live in Europe.

Any leads on a mail-order vendor?

Thanks for the comments. I appreciate all your help!

Subject: 70T fuel pump... another view/opinion

Greetings,
			I am a new member of Porschfiles. My name is Bob 
	Bessette and i am restoring a 1970 911s with the help of a friend
	who happens to have been a Porsche Mech. from 1969-1975. below
	is his response to the 70T fuel pump question


Bob: Maybe you can post this response back wherever you got this question from.
The stock pump is located on the left rear trailing arm in a little sheet metal
bracket mounted near the front on the bottom of it. These are called 'Banana
Arms' by Porschefiles due to their curved 'Banana shape' when off the car...the
front mounts to a rubber bushing on the drivers side near the transmission nose-
piece (front of tranny-towards front of the car under the torsion bar housing)
   The recommended installation to prevent vapor locking problems is to remount
the fuel pump inside the cover over the rack and pinion in the front of the car
just aft the gas tank....I put a piece of foam pipe insulation around mine with
tiewraps - then tie-wrapped it to the rear of the front suspension crosspiece
under the sheet metal cover where the master cylinder and steering rack and
pinion are located. The foam helps quiet the buzzing sound the pump makes if it
is directly frame mounted.
   The reason it vapor locks when mounted to the rear trailing arm is because
the drivers side heater box (and passengers' side too) throws out hot air
right at it when the heaters are shut off commpletely (like during most summer
driving) when engine temps will be the highest resulting in good strong cases
of hard starting when hot (vapor lock).

Subject: changing 944 rear speakers and CD units in a 944

It is possible to change the rear speakers in a 944 without removing the
glass.  Here is what I did in the winter/spring of 91.  It's been 3
years since I did this so I might be a little vague on some of the
precise details, but here goes:

  Remove all of the screws that hold the trim panel in place.  There are
  several of varying shapes and sizes.  You may need to remove the
  shoulder belt anchor point.  You'll also need to remove the door seal
  as the leading edge of the trim panel wraps under the seal.  At this
  point the only thing still holding the panel should be the window
  seal.  Take a large hammer and break the window.  Just kidding!  :*)
  Working slowly and carefully, lift up the edge of the seal and pull
  out the vinyl.  It might be glued in some places so remove it slowly
  and carefully.  In a few places it might also be so far underneath the
  seal that you'll need to cut through the vinyl with a razor blade.  If
  you do cut the vinyl, do it as close to the window as possible so that
  when you go to reinstall the panel, there's enough vinyl to put back
  underneath the seal edge.  Work slowly and carefully and THINK about
  what you're doing.  You should be able to remove the panel in such a
  way that when you put it back in there won't be any signs that it was
  removed.  As always, your money may vary.  Work slowly and carefully
  and if you're not confident that the work you're doing will leave no
  traces then stop!  I did this on my 87 951 and there's nary a sign
  that the speakers were changed.

At the same time I installed an Alpine head unit with a changer in the
trunk compartment behind the left rear wheel. The overall improvement
was tremendous and well worth the time and effort.

E-mail if there are questions.

Subject: Car Jacking Prevention items.


Hello porsche people,

Has anyone had any experience with car jacking prevention devices, like the
two listed in the Automotion catalog on page 90?

They both have a device mounted somewhere in the ignition wiring to cut off
the ignition after receiveing an external signal.  Thus after the car jacker
has taken your car down the block, and you are in safety, the ignition is cut
and he is left stuck with a porsche that won't start or run.

The two devices rely on two different philosophies to prevent the car jacker
from getting away with your precious porsche.  One of them gives the owner a
small device similar to a portable key chain alarm button.  When you hand over
your car with a gun to your head, you press this button, and 90 seconds later,
the ignition is automatically disabled.  Prelems with this: you must keep
the activation button in your pocket, seperate from your keys, and wallet,
since the hi-jacker will undoubtedly ask you to kindly leave your wallet
with the car.  You possibly could leave it near the seat, and push the button
while exiting the car, but what if he says "keep your hands up?".

The other device requires placing an 1-800- phone call and entering a code.
40-60 seconds later, a signal is received by the device in your car, and the
ignition is cut.  Foreseeable problems with this method are: What if you forgot
your portable cellular phone or your not near a phone - could take time to 
find one.  What if you are in booneville USA - How is the signal transmitted 
to the car (cellular I would imagine)?

Has anyone installed or had to use (i hope not) one of these devices?  Living
in Boston makes car-jacking a 930 Turbo a not to distant reality.

From: dkp106@wileypost.cac.psu.edu (David Perkowski)

I have an '88 Porsche 944 Turbo, bought used around 80k. Everything about it
seems fine, but I have two questions:

Will disconnecting the battery (main) reset the computer that supposedly
learns how you drive? I want to start over again, as I don't know what has
been programmed/learned since it (battery) was installed.

Also, the safety belt and airbag indicators are constantly lit on the
indicator
panel on the dashboard. This seems to me to say that the airbags are
nonfunctional, and I've been quoted $750 to replace the chip which my
mechanic
says is causing the problem. If it is the chip (which I guess it likely, 
airbags don't spontaneously stop working, do they?), can I get a better
price
than that?

Thanks! Please respond by email to dkp106@cac.psu.edu.
================

1.
I don't believe the Bosch DME has a 'learn' function
and if it did (such as some GMs do) it would only take
about 25 miles for it to re-learn.

2.
I doubt very much that a 'chip' is your problem, I sugest
a complete analysis of the sensors, wiring, CONNECTORS,
to acertain what is actually wrong.  
NOT the WAG method (usually most $$ part gets changed first with WAG)

Dear Porschephiles

With all the talk on the 944/951 poor radio reception and CD players, I just
recently installed a new Alpine CD player into my 86 951.  I am quite pleased
with the CD player, but the reception is terrible and yes the antenna amplifier
is connected. The original Bluapunk had much better reception. 
My question is this.  Is there any thing I can do to improve my
reception without adding an external antenna.  If not has anyone added an 
external power antenna and improved reception that would warrant this addition.
Also where would the external antenna be mounted, considering physical 
placement and looks.

Has anyone had any experience with these rings?  I'm curious because
the set I have for my '72 911E, which I am rebuilding, has an unusual
oil scraper ring arrangement.  It's a solid ring, rather than the
usual three piece set-up, and is backed by a coil spring.  The fit is
fairly tight because the coil spring doesn't compress that easily, but
there's the right amount of end gap and side gap.

I've just never seen an oil scraper like this, and in addition, the
scraper is usually a very loosely fitted affair.

Just a comment:  I'm becoming less and less impressed with the parts 
from automotion.  'Sway bars are noisy, short shift is so-so (should
re-adjust shift linkage before final judgement here), I've got welds
cracking on the strut brace, etc.

Imparts claims the oem power antennas (Hirschman (?)) are really 
made in japan and that they have tracked down the true oem.  $80.

No.

If I recall correctly, Anderson quotes around 35 HP for both the 98mm
P/C *and* SSI heat excangers.  Good news is that it's all low end 
power ("feels more like 50 hp").  This retained the CIS injection, 
a bonus if you are in CA. and have to get the car smogged, which
is *not* possible (legally) with carbs.

Bu the way, the stock engine may develop more than 180 hp.  If you 
are really interested, get it dyno'ed before *and* after any changes
so you can tell exactly what's happening.

Rockwell Motor Sports (Santa Clara? - De La Cruz Ave) has a chassis
dyno.  Cost is about $60.

What do you want the car to do?  I drive on the street and auto-x.
I would take 25 hp at 3000 rpm above 50 hp at 5000.  To really pump
the engine up, you will shift the power higher and higher up the 
rpm band.  Will you really be driving in that region?

If you don't have "The 911 Performance Handbook" by Bruce Anderson
buy it ($20 from automotion) and read the section on performance mods.

The most cost competitive change is to the early style exhaust.  You 
can probably find a used setup for a few hundred dollars.  I saw some
early headers (heat exchangers w/o shrouding) for $100 at the automotion
swap meet 2 years ago.  Again, this will make your car illegal on 
the street.  You will not pass the visual inspection come smog time.

Can anyone help me out here?  As you know, I've got a Speedster replica

transmission.  One of my friends told me last night that the reason my

because the gearing of a VW tranny is much different from the gearing in a

Is there really that great of a difference between the 901 and VW bug transmiss

There was no factory 928T, and the 968T is a very rare racing vehicle 
which basically cannot be purchased, I believe.  In raw acceleration, 
the 928 and 944T (951) & 944TS (951S) are pretty good but I cannot say 
how they "spec" against a Z28.  The others you mention would likely be 
much slower to accelerate than the Z28, but they're little 4-bangers 
vs. a big V8...

"Excuse me while I step onto this soap box for a clearer view..."  ;-)
I feel obligated to point out that comparing acceleration times is fun 
and academic, but has only minor relation to everyday driving.  It 
matters at a highway on-ramp, and in certain rare open-hiway 
situations.  Also, Porsche is very conservative with their numbers, so 
a spec of 0-60 in 6.1 (951S) may in fact be a 5.5 in the hands of Auto 
Motor Und Sport.  Depends on air pressure (testing altitude, barometric 
pressure), adhesion, driver's capability, and willingness to destroy 
the clutch!

You could also talk about front & rear lift at top speed, which in many 
cars makes them very unstable and scary to drive.  Porsche knows 
aerodynamics and works hard to get low lift along with low drag.

Lots of numbers to analyze here; acceleration is a kick and great to 
talk about at parties but runs out of steam once the party's over.  Have fun!

Yes, the DME will forget what it knew.  I do not know if the 88 951 had 
this kind of DME.  A "virgin" DME memory will take some time to 
re-learn and will use defaults in the meantime.  You might notice 
little differences in drivability during that time, but it isn't much.  
For maximum performance, make sure it re-learns before you do any 
competitive events.

This is a little tricky, as the Airbag light comes on for several 
reasons.  Yah, it could be the airbag brain, but my first areas to look 
at would be connectors, wiring, etc.  If your mechanic wants to replace 
the brain, have him/her/it first "swap" and give you a *known* good one 
for testing - paying $750 'cause he/she *thinks* that's the problem is 
really bogus!  Get proof!

Steve you didn't mention what year your 911 is.  In the early 911's
(1965-1969) you could hear the noise coming from the clutch area (it sounds
like a bearing noise).  If you depress the clutch lighly the noise will
disappear.  If the noise disappears it could mean your T/O bearing is going
bad.  It could also mean your transmission input shaft bearing is bad.   

In later 911's (1970+) the noise can't be heard until the clutch is
depressed.  Put the car in neutral and depress the clutch.  If you hear a
(bearing) noise when the clutch is depressed your T/O bearing is going bad.

I don't have much experience with 911's and these answers are from past
conversations I had when I changed the clutch in my 944 (job from hell). 
Hopefully, someone on the net that is positive about the symptoms responds.

Subject: 911 Noisy Tensioners

Hello Pfiles:

I wonder if anyone else has experienced occasional bouts of chain noise
from updated 911 (Carrera, >84, pressure fed) chain tensioners.
"Occasional" for me being only four times in the past six years (but
with each episode deeply inscribed in my memory!).  Specifically, if I
drive till the engine's warm, *then* park nose down (e.g. on a moderate
San Fran hill), *then* wait 45-60 minutes and restart, I'm *likely* to
be greeted by a horrible marbles-in-the-disposal sound which I take
to be a loose cam chain rubbing something.  Oil pressure and temperature
(and all other indications) are normal.  The sound goes away gradually
as the engine warms up, *or* if I go away and let it cool completely.
Parking nose down and starting warm are necessary but not sufficient
conditions for this to occur, i.e. it only happens under those
conditions, but not every time under those conditions.  The car is an
'83 SC with the tensioner update but otherwise stock engine.

Any insights appreciated...

3-28-94 2:01PM          Why no Water Pumpers? 
 
I went out to the first Golden Gate Region (GGR) PCA Autocross at  
Candlestick on Saturday.  There was a small turnout (about 55 drivers,  
amongst which was our very own Stan Hanks).  We all got lots of runs.  
The most glaring deficiency was the absence of water pumper Porsches.   
Well, not total absence, I was there with my 924 Turbo. 
 
What is going on here?  Is this a national phenomonem?  What about your  
region?  Is there a reasonable turnout of 924/944/928's at your  
autocrosses?  I don't expect many 928s as the ownership base tends to  
not be competition oriented, but 924s and 944s and 944Ts should be well  
represented.  These are inexpensive and fun cars to play with.  Those  
fearing damage to their toys should realize that their cars were meant  
to do this sort of nonsense.  Tires get abused, but that is about it. 
 
From a classification standpoint, GGR has a category that prohibits the  
sticky tires for stock cars.  This was created to encourage those who  
had been intimidated by the prospect of having to buy a separate set of  
wheels and tires to be competitive.  This category is also quite limited  
in allowable modifications.  Pretty much for real, daily driven stock  
cars.  Even alignment is limited. 
 
For those PCAers around the country: Drop me a line on this matter.   
Does your region get participation (or even membership) from water  
pumpers?  I'll summarize the results for all to see. 
 
These cars represent the future strength of membership in PCA.  We need  
to make sure they are part of the game.

I use a blade that chucks into an air powered die grinder. I could probably 
look up the Wurth part number, but it should be easy to infer if you can
get access to their catalog. And no, I don't have any ideas if you don't 
have air. Doing work in this class is a pretty clear-cut case of "if you

[disclaimer - I'm a weekend wrencher, NOVICE, and claim no experience
except my own, on my car - '66 912, so dont flame me.  This is
also my first p-car.]

Well, we just finished the above - and a LOT more including:
inner/outer rockers, door jams, hinge posts, pans,  
rear swing arm? panels (from Stoddard at $250 ea), rear tail light
boxes, front windshield corner repair kits (from Tweeks), etc.,
not in this order, but, to give you some idea of what's feasible.

We used an over-priced Snap-On MIG, Sears compressor (220v) and a
lot of cheap air tools.  We didnt have a jig or rotisserie
because: 1) no $$ or plans and 2) no space.  The car was suspended
with jack stands, engine/trans, practically everything, was removed
to have just a shell.

The time consuming jobs come *before* fitting/welding in the new
replacement pan(s).  I spent mega hours cutting out the old pan (with an
air cut-off saw), cleaning up the edges where the new pan would
be welded against and FIXING the metal to where the pan would be welded to.
Once you clean up everything and then fix all the surrounding metal, the
pan is actually quite easy - we did the pan in three pieces, two major
halves (rear and front) and a gas pedal area pan.

Thoughts/Experiences (remember disclaimer above)

1.  Fix rockers, door jams, hinge posts, etc. before attempting to
	replace the pan - basically, the pan replacement is last.
	My biggest fear was that when I cut the old pan out the
	car would bend "in the middle" and then I would really be
	in for a lot of work (and $$).  At least with solid
	rockers/jams/posts, I slept a little better.

2.  Replace cables/gas lines/brake lines while its easy/possible - when the
	pan is out.

	I got the replacement brake lines from a local NAPA (parts store)
	for 1/10th of Stoddard's price.  The pan-gas line is a pain in
	the butt - have lots of patience when you bend/install it.

3.  I bought a repro pan (restoration design in MI) and wasnt totally
	happy so be careful.  For example, my pan was shipped in
	a thin box and it was bent up perty bad by the time I got it.
	It also didnt have the pre-made little nuts welded in nice
	like I assume a OEM would have - e.g. the gas pedal pan where
	the supports fit on.  It also didnt have holes drilled for
	where the gas pedal stuff was to fit on - that also sucked.

	So, the bottom line is ask or look for the above, this stuff
	caused lots of extra hours.

4.  If you primer the areas before you weld in the new pan, get a
	good respirator because being on your back spraying a good
	weld-through primer is nasty on your lungs.

5.  Have patience!!!  What was supposed to take just a few weeks/months
	turned into a major project (6 mos) - all the cut out and
	fix work is much more involved than you may initially think!

6.  I liked my pan in halves - front and rear instead of left and right.
	It just seemed easier, however, you might want other opinions
	on this since I havent talked to anyone who did l/r replacements.
	I could be swayed on this....  


The bottom line is that, yup, it can be done.  My biggest lessons were:
1) take my time, 2) think first, then act, 3) look at the pictures
in the Porsche workshop and parts manuals, and 4) keep your sense of humor!

Good Luck!!

Clark,

I put ADDCO bars on my 71 911 a few years ago and they really helped a 
lot. The bad news is that the front bar is not attached the same way as 
the factory bar. It's mounted in a conventional way, with the bar under 
the car, attached with standard bushings. This works great for handling, 
but the road clearance goes down too much and you hit every thing over 2 
inches high. I put a factory style bar in after about a year. The rear 
bar is great. Both were easy to mount, and the kits were complete. 

I have bought many ADDCO bars from JC Whitney, ranging from a R5 LeCar to 
a BMW 2002 to my 911. I have nothing but good things to say about them. 
Fit is great, finish is OK, but who cares what they look like after a

I haven't tried these but it does seem that the designers have missed an easier
method to me. Instead of an alarm button why not use the door switch? 
The timer would still activate the ignition kill, but would start clocking
once the drivers door had been opened and then closed again.   
The only times I could think of that this would be a nuisance would be when
autocrossing or at the track. This could be rectified by adding a timer by pass
in the engine compartment that was not too obvious to find.

Oh well, just my $0.02....

I am looking for a 7:31 Ring and Pinion with a Porsche
part number starting with "923"; not the part number that
starts with "915". New or used is fine just as long is the
used one is in good shape.

This is a rush request....so if you can help, please let me know
soon!

Thanks,

P.S. This is to go in a 915, the "923" part if from a 912E,
I believe, and is better suited to my application.

ADDC0 swaybars should be avoided for 911's and 914's.  They do not attach as
stock bars do, and the way they do mount is flimsy.  Save your money and buy
Weltmeister, H&H, or AJ Racing bars.  I don 't know about ADDCO's bars for
other Porsches, but based on the experience with others, I'd tend to avoid
them.  In this case you get what you pay for.

I recently decided I needed to add belts to my 356SC. I had a set of MOS
(that's MOULDY old stock) belts that needed the brightwork polished and new
webbing (pass), and knew of two other sources for new stuff: Tom Conaway at
CarQuip in Boulder, and S. Lucas Valdes at P.E. Products in Los Osos.

Differences: The CarQuip belts were new production of the original factory
style combo belt, which basicly has slide-the-belt-through-the-adjuster
adjustments at the rear mount point for the shoulder harness and on the
inboard belt mount. They were nice looking, and at $169 a set, not badly
priced.

The P.E. Products belts were new Repla belts which were fully retractable
and looked like late 9xx belts in function. They had nice mounting hardware
and the pictures Mr. Valdes sent showed them off very nicely, made them
look very much at home in the car, etc. These belts are also available for
early 911/912s, and he also has replacement modules for all of the 9xx
cars that use retractable Repla belts. Downside: price was like $180 a
side, and they don't look very original.

Partly on price, and partly on look, I chose the CarQuip belts and like
them very much so far. But I *AM* impressed with the P.E. Products
line of belts, and would recommend them if that's what you want in your
car.... And from the sound if it, that's just what you are looking for.

I finally confirmed something that I thought was the case originally, but
didn't post then because I wanted to confirm it.

This problem of exploding fans actually does exist.  No "That doesn't
apply here" flames, please, but the problem is well known in Air-cooled
VW hot-rodding.

There are lots of VW engines that turn well over 6000 rpm with a very
similar cooling fan to that in the 356.  Some of these machines even
have 2.X liter (X > 6?) type 4 (914) motors producing enough HP to
put Bugs into the 10's in the 1/4 mile (run that through your equations).

Anyway, my good friend John Castellano actually has, in his '60 Bug
slot-car, a fan with furnace-brazed fillets on all the blades to
strengthen it and resist exactly the type of fatigue and explosions
described.

Unfortunately, Scat, the company that made his, is no longer around, so
if there is such a beast still available, it would take buying Hot VWs,
and racking up some phone bills to call the myriad of suppliers...
Who knows, maybe someone can do a special... Or better yet, make a
bunch for everybody!

Another, definitely less desireable solution, that I haven't heard
mentioned, is to use a power pulley.  This basically is a smaller
pulley on the crank that turns the generator/fan slower.  The benefit
of lower fan speed is a byproduct of cutting down the power drain of
the generator/fan for more power -- hence the name.

The problem is that this is only good for engines that are only run
at high RPM, since you lose cooling and generator output.  Definitely
do not do this in a daily driver 356...  
Just thought I'd mention it...

After looking at the schematics in the shop manual and experimenting I think
I understand how the cooling system is supposed to work.  Here is some psuedo
code that describes the correct behavior of the 88 924S cooling system. I would
guess that this holds true for any 944 engine with a 2 prong thermoswitch:

if thermoswitch is on (above 92 C with stock thermoswitch)
	if ignition is on
		run both fans at high speed
	if ignition is off
		run left fan at low speed
if AC is on and ignition is on
	run both fans at high speed

If your car doesn't have this behavior then you may have a problem with the
electrical components of your cooling system.

In your message it wasn't clear to me under what conditions your engine was
getting hot and staying hot; eg. fan on or off, and moving are at a stop
light.  One interesting thing that I have noticed is that if the engine is hot,
the fan is on, and the engine is running at idle the temperature will stay
fairly high.  If you then rev the engine up to 2000 rpm for a few seconds the
temp will drop rapidly.  It seams that at idle the water pump does not move much
coolant.

Good luck,
AAW

I have a '81 Euro SC that has no problem passing down here in Houston. And
since Houston is one of the EPA interdicted cities, they're getting tougher
and tougher down here.... BTW: most of the stations are barely set up to
even do a "sniff" test, much less a full-range test. And *no one* can possibly
be set up to recognize all the plumbing and gizmos that you're supposed to have
for all the different cars on the road. So as long as your car sniffs OK,
you're probably set.

Hmmm. Well, you *CAN* get NPR, and I have used them extensively in the past.
In fact, that's what my SC has right now. I got a couple of sets just before
they started getting "rare". These days, I dunno -- too expensive for what
you get, IMHO.

You can get Mahle in a variety of sizes and dome configurations, depending
on how hard you look. Someone once sold me a set of Mahle big-bores, too,
so they at least *USED* to be out there. 

And then you go to custom pistons. I have had race pistons made by Venolia
and Arias, and there is the greatly famed Shasta piston which is used so
much by both the vintage and SCCA crowd that race 356s/912s. The problem with
the custom pistons is usually that they slap a bit when cold. If you can live
with it, that's fine. If you want it to not make that noise, then you're better
off with the stock pistons.

The key to more performance is more of something you have too little of: 
air/gas mixture, RPMs, compression, etc. Of course, on any air-cooled
engine, when you start mucking about with those things, you get into the
*OTHER* side of the problem: you may not be engineered to handle it. The
bearings on a 356 are quite small, even compared to a 914. Much more load
and they just wear out phenomenally fast. The rods and pistons are *HEAVY*;
you can save over half the weight by going to Carrillo rods, Arias pistons,
and lightened tool steel wrist pins. That means less load on the crank (whic
is prone to break on the C/SC/912s anyway) and more RPMs (until you run into
the breathing problem....)

So, it's not a simple matter.

> Im not interested in a hot rod, but a car that will be able to beat "souped
> up" ghias and bugs at the stop light:) 

Your target is admirable, but you also gotta keep a few things in mind: I can
build a 1835cc Type I engine that makes close to 220 HP for about 10k miles
for under $5k, including outside labor and "retail" on the engine rebuild
cost at Ghost Racing. And that's with new everthing -- cam, crank, rods,
Ps and Cs, heads, etc. I can barely rebuild a SC/912 engine to stock for
that money, *IF* I don't have to replace the heads, crank, or Ps and Cs.
*PLUS* there's this "Hot VW" aftermarket, where guys like GeX and MOFCO
and Gene Berg and Fast Freddie's and RTR selling "done" Type I performance
engines for $1-2k. Sure, in the grand scheme of things, they're crap, but
for the first 5-7k miles, they're REALLY hot. You just can't compete with
that...

Some kid is *ALWAYS* gonna toast your butt with a hot Bug. Just smile, 
wave as he goes past, and remind yourself -- he's family, in a wierd sort
of way...

From: mvmas@mvusa.att.com

Partly to answer someone's question about 914 injection systems, and partly
to help those like me who pick up FI parts at swap meets just to have spares,
I have included the best table I could make of numbers on 914 FI components.

If you like looking at numbers for a few hours :) you can see that there
are quite a few differences between the 1.7 system and 2.0 systems.  To
really fix your car right you should get the right match of components.
However, many of the parts are similar enough that should you break down
in an inconvenient area or if you are diagnosing a problem, another
type will do the job temporarily.  

In the table, where there are two lines for the same part, the first line
is from tweeks and the second is from performance products, they don't
always agree.  Oh, yeah, and the distributor trigger points are almost
certainly a typo, I think it should be 906 not 905 for all.  (No guarantees
for this list, my car is still getting some welding done and I haven't 
looked at actual parts in at least a year).

Dear porschephiles:
Does anyone have any information on Porsche's upcoming Boxster?
Having once owned a Speedster, I've become quite excited about
the Boxster program.  When will it be in production? Engine type,
etc.????  Thanks.

I have only one thing to say.

Speed is relative.  All the really fast guys either went home or stayed
in the pitsto avoid the 2' deep puddle at turn 1.

I'm one of the guys who went home.

I invite Matt to be at the July CAR GUYS at summit point.  I'll be there
but more importantly there will be some really good drivers there.

Tell us Matt, what times did people get you at?   If you tell me I'll be
happy to tell you what times Bob William and Dan Dazzo turned the first
time behind the wheel of my lowly 911.

I'd tell you what I ran but since I'm just a novice it wouldn't be a
fair comparison.

Subject: Re: Boxster update



The motoring press in the UK has had a number of spreads
of the Boxster photographed in testing in Germany. The car is heavily
disguised as a 968, but is unmistakably the Boxster. The
articles claimed that four and six cylinder versions would
be available, with the 6 giving 240 HP from a multi valve head.
The very short front of the show boxster will be somewhat
elongated in the production version, and sadly the rather
cool headlights will be replaced by the 993 type in production.
BMW will be pressing the body panels, Porsche have reduced their
suppliers from 900+ to just over 300, and are investing heavily
in production engineering to allow the production of the 996 and
Boxster (986 I think) from many common parts, to make their
pricing more competitive. There are rumours that this vehicle will
debut late this year at a price of 29000 GBP. I suspect that sometime
in 1995 is more credible. As to the price, well the 968 club sport 
is less than 30k GBP, so I don't see any reason why the smaller, lighter,
productionised boxster should not be less, and therefore competitive
with the various offerings from various other manufacturers.

Ben

Subject: Re: 914 engine bay insulation.

Kyle,
You asked about the the sound-deadening insulation from J. C. Whitney.
I have bought this insulation and have installed it on the fire-wall of my 914.

The insulation consists of a thin layer of dense material (plastic?), a
thicker layer of foam, and a layer of aluminum foil. The idea (I guess) is
the dense layer blocks sound,  the foam prevent vibrations from reaching
the firewall, and the aluminum rejects heat. The insulation comes with an
adhesive backing, but I kept the easy-release paper over the adhesive, and
instead installed the insulation with those funny pegs, just as the
original insulation was installed. Just as on the original, I made some
release slits to allow the insulation to conform to the shape of the
firewall; I sealed these with 2" aluminized tape.
I don't really know if this insulation blocks sound better than the
original jute insulation; I didn't make the comparison. It looks a lot
better, and doesn't get sucked into the cooling fan as the old insulation
did.

the S/N ratio on the 356 flames seems to be getting a little on the
high side....perhaps folks could stop arguing about horsepower
numbers and just upload copies of the relevant dyno sheets to the
archives.  Then we could all see for ourselves who's bull****ing
whom.

Just because someone does not personally race has no bearing on
their mechanical ability...it may on their driving ability...or
willingness to put their car at risk.

I personally prefer to race.

The Boxster is supposed to be in production by late 1996.  Power is to
be supplied by either a four or six, both of which are to be watercooled,
although I have read some reports that the four-cylinder engine may not
make it to production.  Pricetag is targeted for $40k (US).  Like you,
I am excited about this car.  My wife and I saving already for the car!
BTW, your local Porsche dealer should have posters of the Boxster.  I hit
mine up for a few!  I only hope they come up with a different name for
the car.  I understand the retro-naming, but it doesn't slide off the
tongue easily.  (Can one get any more picky than that?  A great car a
the only comment is..."I don't like the naaaaaaammmmmmme.")

Subject: re: seat belts 


      My own experience with taking apart the spring on seatbelts, is that
    if you have trouble fixing your lawn mower, you won't have a prayer
    in getting your selt belt right again....if you can buy a new belt,
    save yourself the hassle, get the best solution, buy it at any cost.
      I first tried to rebuild my 911 retractor; next I tried the really smart
    thing and got an old used one (for half what a new one would cost).
    I sold the car still shutting the door on the seatbelt that wouldn't
    pull back in ...
      If you get a used belt (for a 911/44/28) you can probably only trust it
    if it is relatively new. At least for a 911, you may have to buy both
    ends since the inside web/latch has changed.

          -Lee A.    '79 828

      p.s. anybody have a good lead on a used fuse panel for a '79 928 ?
           Anybody have electrical diagrams for that car ?

Well Alrightey Then, it seems if you have no talent you buy a Porsche,
then you make excuses.

Subject: Recent Flaming Threads


The recent flaming thread that is going on, albeit hilarious and a
source of great personal entertainment for me, is yet another example
of something I notice to be a trend. Let me elaborate.

On several occasions, people have come onto Porschephiles "from the
business", either as shop owners, experienced engine builders or
people proclaiming vast experience in one of several art(s) relating
to Porsche. And it seems without exception this person becomes
involved in some sort of personal challenge to their credibility from
another porschephile, or in some cases many.

And then we see some of the old regulars humbly giving advice, day to
day, and they are respected and even prompted for their opinions,
and their responses are always appreciated by a majority of members
for their content and in some cases humor. They do not need to affirm
any sort of expertise, it is apparent.

Why is this?

   I recall reading in an issue of _European Car_ a couple of years back
that the main (only?) difference between the 1.7 and 2.0 injection systems
is the size of the injectors.  Their claim was that the other bits were
identical.  So, if you beleive what my memory (not the greatest in the
world) says that the aftermarket mag says, then--Yes, he could be right,
and no, it doesn't matter.

   Uuh, Ted--Please note that they are talking about 1.6L (or smaller) 356
engines.  Designed and built starting in around 1948.  356 != 911.
    The 911 is *significantly* newer, and was built for much more power.  Check
the HP ratings on the stock '66 911's, even.  The engine you just dumped was
from what, 1977?  That's 10+ years of improvements, on an engine that had
*much* more room for growth.  It's apples and oranges.

    BTW, everyone, I think we may have had enough.  Could y'all move this to

Subject: Wheel Names

As a neophyte here, I must confess as to some confusion regarding the names for
various wheels.  Carrerra Cup, Cookie Cutters, Phone Dials, etc.  I'm not sure
which name goes with which wheel.

I am looking at an ad by Robert W. Wood, Inc. on page 35 of the February 1994
issue of Panorama.  Six wheels are pictured.  Can someone tell me which name
goes with which wheel?  Thanks.

Also, I have seen many references to Fuchs wheels.  I know that this is a
brand,
but I don't know what the style looks like.  I assume that the company makes
many styles of wheels, but I also assume that when people here refer to Fuchs,
they are referring to a particular style.

Thanks for you help, and please pardon my ignorance.

The Boxter will be arriving in the summer of 1996 as a 1997 model, the engine 
will be a six cylinder, and it has been said that there will be room for a 
radiator in the front (water, or oil???).  Of course it will be a mid-engined
roadster design, and will adhere as closely as possible to the concept car as
is feasibly possible.  It is undecided as to whether or not Porsche will make
a 4-cylinder version of the Boxter.  Word is that when the Boxter hits the 
market, the 968 will bow out, since they will be in direct competition with 
each other.

All this information was gleaned from an interview with Fred Schwab and Rich

My 80 931 runs hot in the summer, too.  I live 1300 feet up a hill,
which doesn't help much either.  In the summer, in stopped city
driving or after arriving at my house the guage can be at or above the
third tick sometimes.  Last summer I put in a 25% glycol/75% water
coolant, and I did add the Red Line water wetter. It helps, but not a
huge amount.

I also found that the lower engine compartment cover helps noticably
to cool both the engine and the turbo by directing the cooling air
appropriately.  I have yet to try the manual fan switch or the lower
temp fan switch.

The most important cure, of course, is to avoid city driving... makes
me and the car much happier.

   I have a problem with my FI system a few years ago and I have several
"Brain-Boxes"  a 2.0 a 1.7 and one from a Volvo (Oh my.) and I tried all of
them and the car still missed and ran bad the problem turned out to be the
head temperature sensor.  I followed the testing procedure in the Haynes manual
and it was not what the book said.  After I removed it and replaced it with
a new bosch unit I looked and the numbers on the old one and they where not
the same So someone relaced it years ago and go one that was close.  After I 
replaced it the car ran so much better you would not believe it.

I'm looking for some insulation like this to mount on the firewall of my
Speedster replica.  How much was it?  

Another question:  I have a hole cutout in the firewall directly behind my
fan intake.  Any comments on whether this would aid the cooling of my engine
or would it actually make my engine run hotter.  My thinking is that I'm
sucking in road heat from under the car, so I think I'll seal it up and
see what happens.

Subject: Funny 911 noise


	I am getting a couple of funny noises in my 1972 911T Targa.  
The car has about 150K miles, but still runs real strong.  I 
change the tranny fluid twice a year, with 85/140; the engine 
oil every other month with 20/50 (new fiter every other change) 
and drive it daily, about 50 miles a week. 

	I've tried the local shops, but they can't seem to figure it 
out without wanting to dismantle something :(  

	The noise occurrs when I start it up for the first time on 
any given day, or if it has had time to cool off.  The noise is 
kind of a mid-range warble, coming from somewhere in back.  I 
can't hear it when I'm outside the car; I think that the engine 
noise might be masking it.  Now the fun part! If I put the clutch 
in, the noise continues for about 1/2 second and stops, like 
something that stopped spinnging (clutch stuff?).  Once the car 
is warmed up, the noise goes away.  It is more noticeable on 
cold mornings, even though I always keep the car garaged (but not 
heated)  The noise also varies with RPM.

	The other noise is kind of a thrashy rattle I can hear from 
inside or outside, and it also happens when its cold.  This one 
doesn't care whether the clutch is in or out, but does change 
according to RPM.  This noise also goes away when the car warms up.

	Part of the problem too is that I can't get to the shop 
while the noises are still going...

	If anyone could give me a clue, I would appreciate it.

PS: Does anyone have a front bumper/spoiler (Fiberglass is OK)
	they want to get rid of ?  I also have a fiberglass turbo
	tail I really don't want...

I can give a partial answer (left to right):

Fuchs, Cookie Cutters, Phone Dials, Flat Forged, Flat Turbo Style Forged,
Carrera Cup

The last three do not seem to have garnered the "folksy" names of the first
three...perhaps they are too new. Maybe someone can give a more official name

Hello all, 

	Since my 914 is destined to have a six, and since it needs all 
the typical 914 rust repair now, all the recent talk of flares got me to 
thinking about where I might procure some steel GT flares for my 914 to 
include in all the bodywork that it is going to need so I only have to do 
this once. I am aware that Automobile Atlanta sells them for about 
$1500/set. Does anyone know where a set might be obtained for less (Mill 
Supply maybe?)--I'm just not that interested in giving George Hussey any  
more of my money than I have to and with the recent talk of flares, I 
have some misgivings about using the fiberglass ones.

There is nothing wrong with Italian sports cars, in fact there was nothing 
wrong with the 348 or the Testarossa that went home after one day with their 
tails between their legs from the 1st P.O.C event last february  at P.I.R.

It was the drivers that were the limiting factor,  affecting their progress 
round the track and holding up the field of Porsches. But they were 
considerate and responsible drivers and the Porsche drivers showed them the 
same consideration when passing them.

The problem with the Fiat interlude is not the car, it is the arrogance, 
stupidity and self confessed irresponsibility of the driver. No one, driving 
any sort of race  or track event needs to have to share a track with that 
whatever their nationality.!

Subject: 3.6 911 Turbo


I notice in the April edition of Road and Track (I think it
was that mag anyway, just grabbed a freebie glance from the
magazine rack) that the 3.6 911 turbo comes out at the top
of a number of motor cars of various origin in the 0-100-0 test.
Except for a brutal Kawasaki bike included for comparison.

I know that 0-100-0 is a Meaningless Indicator of Performance
test, and that Your Milage May Vary, but in terms of pure
grunt the 911 wins hands down. Other more or less exotic
hardware from Japan (NSX etc etc), Italy (512TR) etc. looked
a bit iffy by comparison.

I need the help of the list.  My '74 914 has a noise coming from the right
rear wheel.  It is a humming, which goes away when I turn a corner that
is banked to the right (putting more weight on that wheel).

Is this the wheel bearings?  If so, how difficult is this to fix?

Subject: 944 CD Changer

With all of this talk about CD players in Porsches, I decided to purchase a Sony
CD changer unit for my 944.  When I purchased the unit, I had it in my mind that
I would mount this unit vertically in the storage area at the right rear corner
of the vehicle, just behind the right rear wheel well.  (There is a matching
storage area on the left side as well.)

Last night I took a closer look at the place where I want to put the unit.  I
also took a closer look at the unit.  It is a Sony CDX-U303.  It would appear
that the unit must be mounted horizontally or vertically, but not in-between.
The area where I want to mount the unit consists of curved surfaces.  I think
that *if* I am careful, I might be able to mount it to the left-hand surface and
get it pretty close to vertical.  Has anyone else put a changer unit in a 944,
and if so, how did you do it?

My last concern is with the actual mounting.  Sony supplies some self-tapping
screws.  I hate putting sharp screws through things when I don't know what is on
the other side of the metal sheet I am about to put them through.  I am worried
about hitting the gas tank or an electrical conduit or something.  I am also
concerned about creating a place where rust can start.  I've looked through the
Haynes manual, but it doesn't seem to show what is on the other side of the
metal sheet.  Can anyone tell me whether it is safe to follow Sony's mounting
instructions?

Thanks in advance for your help.

  Michael Freed Asks;

   I've learned gradually better ways to cut sheetmetal;
 1. Use a dremel tool and a hundred blades; this will give you your cleanest
    edge and no chance of distorting metal; but it will take forever.
 2. Electric nibbler; mine's a Milwaukee, other brands are available; this has
    a low chance of distorting the edge, and it works quickly. You won't be
    able to get around any thick metal, also my Milwaukee has a large lip
    underneath and can't get past any tight spaces underneath. I have another
    brand without this problem, can't remember the name.
      There are air-powered versions of these that would probably work better
    than the electric ones.
 3. Cut-off saw; works fairly quickly, you have a low chance of distortion
     if you work the entire surface at once (don't let any part get too hot).
     This is probably the most useful single tool to have around, and they
     are cheap.
 4. Air-hammer; the quickest method of all, but guaranteed to distort the
     metal, or tear chunks from welded edges. These are better for oil drums
     (or trunk floors or just getting metal out of the way).
 5. Cutting torch; leaves the worst edge and has the most chance of
     distortion.
 6. Air-saw; never used one but I think it would be great for cutting holes
     in a rigid shell but terrible for preparing edges for mating.

     Eastwood (800-345-1178) has a nibbler that attaches to a drill
  (pn 4572, $35), air nibbler #1646 @ $90, or a hand nibbler (like a
  small tin-snips, #6291 @ $35, haven't got one but it looks usable).
  If you are at all serious about body work, the Eastwood catalog is a
  real education in the best way to do things. It doesn't take a ton
  of tools to do bodywork well, but some unique tools are essential.

Off the subject a bit, perhaps, but I thought I'd point out that
the Kawasaki ZX-9 that R&T tested is not brutal at all by motorcycle
standards.  It's a completely different ballgame when you're talking
about 400-600 pound vehicles with 100-120 HP at the rear wheel.

Subject: cost per mile

P'philes,
    I was looking over my maintenance records and I recalled a thread about
cost per mile and I thought that some people might find the following 
info intertesting.  I would also be interested in other peoples stats.

Car:		1983 944 manual trans.
Purchased:	used 7/31/88 with 40k miles, $13,500
To Date:	115,000 miles total, 75,000 since purchase
		$11,839 in repair and maintenance
		$2,091 per year
		12,500 miles per year
		$0.166 per mile
		$0.32 per mile (est.) with gas and insurance

Note: repaiar and maintenance does not include accidents, like the time I was
      out screwing around on wet roads and slid into a curb (new rim, tire
      suspension bits, etc.)

There was a big cost spike about a year ago with the radiator, head gasket,
water pump, motor mount, etc. all failing within about 8 months but
since then (as it was before) it has been a very reliable and
pleasurable car.  I have also
started performing my own maintenance (new differential shaft seals to
cure a transmission leak last weekend) which is both fun and cost effective.

Thanks for all the excellent advice, opinions, stories, etc.

    You guessed it you have a wheel bearing that is worn out.  I replaced 
my right one two years ago and I took about  6 hours total.  You have to
pound the old one out and pound the new one in with out tearing it up.

so one makes a tool that helps (can remember where I saw this maybe a old
VW&Porsche Magazine).  It is also I good time to repack those CV joints while
you have to take them off anyway, that is another reason it took 6 hours.

Ok time for novice 911 question.

I have been adjusting my 72 911 height because the my
car was way out of spec heightwise in the rear. I was able
to browse the archives came up with some good tips on
the process (thanks Steve S.).  I also had the factory manual and Haynes
nearby. Well, all the literary help in the world did not make the
rear adjustment go quicker. After measuring my angles and 
jacking up the torsion arm bracket (whatever it called),
getting the arms back in, and all the bolts back (one
nasty smashed finger), I lowered the car off the jacks
and discovered I am about 3/4 inch high (~20.5 mm) on both sides.
The front height is set right. This was an all day affair
for me and I really do not want to revisit this again soon.

SO, my question is--can I just be a little high in the rear
and go get the four wheel alignment done? Or will this screw
up everything from CV joints, handling and to seat adjustments?

Now I'm not familiar with where everything is in Mountain View.  So I zigged
when I should have zagged and ended up giving him an acceleration
demonstration in front of the police department's back parking lot!  No, even
though there were some patrol cars around nothing happened.  But I did get a
good ribbing when we got back!

And Dave Blanchard mentioned Stan came to the auto-x.  I figured since Stan
and I basically owned the same car I'd let him give mine a go.  Sort
of...oops, mine is a coupe and Stan didn't fit too well, helmet and all.  He
described his driving position as "the Dan Gurney style."  Hope it was
worthwhile anyway!

An aside about the auto-x, since Dave mentioned it.  Yes, the overwhelming
favorites out here are modified 914's (both 4 and 6 cyl.) and later
911SC/Carrera.  My car fits into a "street modified" class because of high
compression and the short final drive, a bit out of its element.  It is
otherwise what we call "production."  Even so, I ran 5th overall, within 2
sec. of the car that won the Parade in San Diego (Bill Newlin's 914 race
car).  If my car were stock I would guess my time would have been 1.5 seconds
slower, maximum (but still using "race" tires).  The point is that you CAN do
a lot with your STOCK car--seat time making so much more of a difference than
mechanical "tweaks."

Hello!

I'm looking at buying another 914 and I'd like to get a handle on ACTUAL prices.

Could my fellow 914 owners please send me (directly) a few facts about any
recent (past year or so) 914 purchases?  I'd like to know asking price, actual
price, and a brief summary of condition.  

If I get enough responses I'll post a summary (sans personal info) of the 
results.  I realize some might think this sort of a private issue so I'll
be discrete.  I'm just trying to get a handle on the *street* prices.

Thanks.  I can be reached directly at:  jberry@afit.af.mil

Hi, P-netters.
 
The San Diego slalom came and went. All told, there were four members of
Porschephiles there -- self, Bob Albrecht (no relation, running with his son
Doug), Herb Stern, and Walt Thode. There were 6 entries in class A/Stock: 3
356 drivers (in 2 cars) and 3 914 1.7 and 1.8 drivers (in 2 cars). There was
no self-appointed maestro nor any motors built by same.
 
Our car won again (but not with me driving.) My co-driver pulled it all
together on the last run, jumped ahead of two 914s and finished with a time
of 75.10 sec. The gap between 1st and 5th (me) was "only" 1.03 sec. The
other 356 was midway between us, in 3rd. It was a fast course, seeing third
gear on two occasions (unless you wanted to rev to 7 K, which worked too),
so I estimate speeds got past 70 mph even for this slowest class.

Guten tag!

I am in the process of putting a 20mm front antiroll bar (off
of a 79 930) on my 76 911.  The bar is the factory type (not
through-the-body).  My question is does anyone know a 
source for the rubber bushings that mount at the control
arm end of this bar?  My existing bushings are for a 16mm
bar and I'm wrestling with either trying to open these up to
accept the 20mm bar or replacing them.  If anyone has some
of these left over from a conversion to a through-the-body
type of bar, I would gladly take them off your hands.

Any comments or concerns would be appreciated!!

Subject: Brake caliper piston orientation??

Would anyone have a decent picture/diagram of how the brake caliper piston (one
per caliper) should be oriented on each wheel of a 928?  Perhaps other models
are similar?  Should the relief in the piston open toward the rotor rotation,
that is as if the rotor were entering the relief during foward travel?  Sould it
maintain this orientation on each wheel or vary on each side?  

The top of the piston (which contacts the pad) has a relief cut out, which,
according to my shop manual needs to be oriented a particular way.  The reliefs
are oriented differently on each wheel in a haphazard way (one is up, another
down, etc) and does not appear to come even close to what the maual describes.

The shop manaul does not provide much detail on this.  It shows how to make a
wedge shaped tool which will measure the angle of this releif on the piston, but
it does not how to use the tool.  It appears the bottom of tool will rest on a
round rotor hub, which seems like it would not very accurate.  Any
thoughts/experience on this?

Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Not quite. Ken Miles in a 427 Cobra did the trick in 12.4 seconds
way back in 1965 as the article reports. R&T was unable to match
the 1965 times. 

> Except for a brutal Kawasaki bike included for comparison.

The ZX-9R is a fast and quick bike, but R&T didn't try to find the
quickest or fastest bike. Their purpose was to compare a standard
production street bike to some of the hottest cars.

The Kawasaki had completed its 0-100-0 before the Porsche hit 100.

They also noted that the bike's shifts took no more than 0.1 seconds,
while the Porsche's about four times that number. They had real
trouble shifting the 512 TR and commented that had it "been easier
to shift, it might have vied for top honors with the Porsche."

Now how about a 0-150-0 comparison?

Anthony, this is a symptom of air in your cooling system.  Do a careful

recheck this symptom.

The normal temperature rise/fall cycle is fairly slow.

Some of you may remember that this entire flaming 356 thread all started
with an exploding fan. I have found a fix for this, and I won't have to tool
up to make Kevlar fans, either.
 
This was written up about a year ago in Hot VWs magazine.
 
RIMCO, Santa Ana, CA, takes fans and welds over the tabs. Then they rebalance
the fans, but unfortunately not with the generator (the factory balanced the
entire rotating assembly; first time you put in a new generator or fan,
you've lost that). Rimco says they prefer the German fans, they seem a
little bit better made. Price is $40, turnaround time about 2 days. I'll let
them do my new Mexican VW fan (or better yet a used 356 fan) when I have
some spare time to take everything apart again.

Specifics are available via the "usual" documentation or maybe some

	Jim,

	According to local semiconductor wizzard, the reagent for removing
	epoxy from a chip is "Red Fuming Nitric Acid".
	His method is to create a pocket in the top of the plastic with an
	end mill or other similar tool to contain the Acid. He puts the 
	device in a beaker, on top of a hot plate, heats the thing up to
	about 90 degrees C, and applies the acid a drop at a time, untill
	the die is exposed, shaking out the residue between applications.
	Sound somewhat noxious to me.
	He claims the acid won't attack the die, and that you should have no 
	problem exposing the whole die, and that it may still function when
	the epoxy is gone!
	Note that identification markings may be on back of die as well as 
	the front.
	Seems like I recall Red Fuming Nitric Acid was used as an oxidizer
	in some liquid fueled rockets, maybe the V-2? Back to our regulary
	scheduled German Heritage Session.

Subject: Fuel Pumps take 2...



Okay anyone know, what besides age, causes a fuel bump to seize up? My 
trusty car has eaten two in the past week.

a little background, the first one happened on a fairly low tank, at an 
autocross, a VW mechanic there said the VW pumps will seize if they're run 
dry, for a few seconds, as they run fuel straight through the motor, and use 
it to lubricate the pump mechanism. If you run out of fuel poof it seizes, 
so the thought was this being a bosch pump ('84 carrera pump) it might 
behave the same way, presto, I starved it in a sweeper.

I had the car towed home (ugh!) and then put a new pump in, the car was up, 
and happy, running for about another four days, then poof! no more pump. 
This time I had well over a 1/4 tank in the car, and had just been driving 
on the street, no real pushing it, no sustained sweepers, etc...

On further examination it seems that the screen in the tank before the pump 
was cut out by the previous owner of the car, and therefore the tank was 
going straight into the pump with no filtering, so there is a theory that 
this killed the pumps. (coupled with the ethinated gas out here, which is 
doing a fine job of scrubbing my tank clean)

Does anyone have opinions, is the first theory, to quote a movie (bull**** 
or not?), my local mechanic subscribes to theory number 1, and wants me to 
put in a newer tank (I have a '71) so that it won't get starved again. So 
far I just had him replace that missing screen, and lend me an extra pump 
should mine die next weekend in bremerton.

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               944's $$ in Canada?
Someone I bumped into on the internet has a brother interested in
buying a 944.  I suggested he write to porschephiles and he replied:

> Actually, I talked to my brother last night and he has found an

I thought this was too high, even for Canadian dollars, and said so,
along with some advice on what to look for.

He wrote back:

Question: Can it possibly be true that an 86 944 w/ 160km has a

Subject: 911 Ride Height - how low can you go ?

I'm sure we've been over the 911 ride height stuff a couple of times,
but I can't remember seeing any info on what you get for what
setting. Basicly the Anderson book says the lower the better until you
start grounding, and judging by my friends severely dropped '72 2.2S
which handles fabulous, but hits everything on the street thicker than
a matchbox, he is on the right track.

Anyhow I thought if I could gather some information on what you get,
in terms of how street drivable the car is, for what height, I for one
could decide what to set mine at without the change it, try it, change
it again approach. To keep things simple I've measured height to wheel
arch.

Well here's my entry, all other info gladly received, if there is
enough interest I'll collate and mail to the group.

'77 911 Carrera 3 Sport Coupe

	Front (205/55 16")	24 7/8" (full tank)
	Rear  (225/50 16")	25 1/8"

	Synopsis: Never grounds on the street, standard springs, HD shocks.
		  Would like to loose another 3/4" all round.

Subject: mounting a CD changer in a 944

I installed my Alpine CD changer in the trunk in the compartment behind
the left rear wheel.  To do so I cut a piece of 1/2" plywood to the
shape of the opening such that it would rest on the welded body seam on
the right side and on the curve of the fender on the left and rear of
the car.  If I remember right it looked sort of like this when viewed
from above:

I determined the shape with trial and error after first using a piece or
card board to get the approximate shape.  The curved edge was beveled so
that it rested against the body as opposed to being wedged in.  There
was a hole in the cavity somewhere covered by a rubber plug that allowed
me to bolt the wooden panel to the car without drilling any holes.  That
bolt plus the gravity of the whole assembly held it in quite firmly and
I never had a problem with it moving around and it very rarely skipped.
The Alpine changer held 6 disks and was quite small so mounting it this
way was possible.  The body seam on which the wood panel rested on was
far enough below the carpeting that the changer could protrude about
1.5" and still let the carpet lay flat on the trunk floor.  A 10 disc
changer might be too big to use this method.

Subject: airbags in 944's

There is a diagnostic connector for the airbag system in early 944/951
models under the dash on the passenger side.  If you get the right
tech bulletin from Porsche you can query the airbag computer and have
it display the stored fault codes using the in-dash airbag warning
light.  Once a code is set it will cause the airbag light to stay on
until the fault code is erased via the diagnostic connector.

In my 87 951 I was getting two fault codes, one relating to the
contact ring assembly in the steering column and another that didn't
show up in the list.  I tried resetting the codes but they would
return after a few minutes of driving.  I carefully removed the airbag
assembly from the steering wheel and checked the ring assembly for
electrical and mechanical faults but could find nothing wrong.  I then
took the car to the dealer and they ended up replacing the airbag
computer.  This is quite a job because most of the wiring is attached
directly to the computer itself so it's a labor intensive job
extracting the wires that go to the left and right airbag units and to
the impact sensors and the warning light.  Apparently one section of
the harness had been routed improperly and was crushed underneath the
dashboard somewhere; that was allegedly the cause of the problem.  I
think PCNA paid for 75% of the part and I paid the labor (about 6
hours); it came to a total of around 600 USD.  They did this with very
little pressure from me; in retrospect I should have leaned on them
harder to pick up more of the charge.  This was in the spring of 1991
on an 87 951 with about 18K miles.

If you're adventurous, get the tech bulletins for 88 or 89 from
someplace like Stoddard and check the fault codes and read up on the
tests and repair procedures (they're actually replacement procedures;
you can't really repair any parts).  If you then feel real bold you
can take it a step further and try to replace the defective piece at
your own expense.

However, I strongly suggest that you get smart by reading the tech
bulletins and maybe querying the fault codes and trying to clear them.
Then let the dealer handle the repair and see what they propose to do.
That way you'll be able to talk intelligently with them when they
decide to replace whatever they think is at fault.  If you do your own
work, be *REAL* careful and make sure you have all of the proper
documentation.  A triggered airbag releases a lot of mechanical energy
that can cause serious injuries or worse.  An airbag assembly that is
face down on a hard surface and then triggered will become a heavy
projectile moving at a considerable speed.

This reminds me:  have the checks on the airbag system as required by
the service manual ever been done?  I think the first one is at 4
years and then every two years thereafter. I think the check is mostly
a visual one plus querying the computer to verify that there are no
fault codes stored thereby showing that the self diagnostics work
correctly.

Was the car ever in an accident, even a fender-bender? The computer
requires the proper input from at least one impact sensor plus its
own internal sensor to trigger the deployment of the bags. If one or
the other sensor has been inadvertently triggered by an accident, that
could be the problem.

E-mail or post if you have any more questions or comments. I don't have
my tech books; they're back in the US so I'll have to work from memory.

Subject:  Bill rear (911 that is)

    Bill-

    Congrats for getting as far as you have with adjusting your ride
    height.  The process is a very lengthy one, I know, but the
    results are correspondingly rewarding.

    You mention that you are .75" too high.  My question is: Compared
    to what?  If you are .75" too high compared to stock, then you
    probably don't want to keep it this way (no, I don't think you'll
    have any real problems re CVs, seat adjustment, etc, but your
    handiling will not be AS good as if it were at the stock ride
    height or at a "performance" ride height).

    Also, remember that the front ride height and the rear ride height
    are related.  If your front is where you want it but your rear is
    .75 high, adjust the front up a little and I think this may bring
    your rear down a tad (at least this concept seems to work from a
    conrner balancing perspective), all the time trying to preserve
    that "front down" disposition.

    As for your "extra" ride height and the four wheel alingment, I
    would suggest that you set your ride height to exactly where you
    want it before you get the alingment.  The extra ride height will
    not be a detriment within itself (unless you compare it to what
    you could have optimally), but it will be a problem in two or so
    months after your hand heals and you decide, what the heck, I
    might as well tweak this beast to get the best ride height,
    handling, etc.  You will then lower the car to proper stock height
    or performance height and presto, your four wheel alignement has
    just been trashed -- time for another $100-150.

    If you determine you need to lower the car more (i.e., it is too
    much higher than stock, or you want to get even better handling
    -- remember though, a lower car has some negatives), it might be
    some solace to realize that next time you get down there it should
    be a little more familiar and probably a little easier, after all,
    you had all the stuff apart and thus it should come apart a little
    easier this time.

    And don't forget to make sure your suspension has COMPLETELY
    settled before checking your ride height.  After your car has been
    up in the air and the shocks, etc. extended, you should first
    dirve it around a little to get the camber re-set and the shocks
    back to where they need to be.

    Good Luck and let us know what you decide and how it goes.

I could only guess that rust from the tank shorted it
out internally. The brushes etc. are exposed, so any junk
that gets in can either get between the brushes and 
commutator or if it's conductive, short them out. At the
other end is a small roller pump, also easy to clog up 
with debris.

You can try to spray Brakleen or carb cleaner into the
entrance and exit of the pump. Not too likely that it
will work, but it's worth a try considering the price
of a new pump. I would also make sure the fuel pump relay
is working and that you have power to the pump - it's
easy to make a snap diagnosis when a part has recently
been replaced.

If you can't save the pump, take it apart for educational
value and to find out what happened. The top is crimped
on, but if you're careful (no power tools or sparks) you
can pry off the top with vice grips and a screwdriver and
pull the whole pump assembly out of the "can" It will
probably be obvious what is defective, and on the far
outside chance that it's a manufacturing defect, you'll
have evidence in hand.

Craig, see my answer to certain questions below.  I've been to the 
factory twice, but things have changed since then.

> - Are tours available on Saturday?  I'm thinking of April 30
> - What times in the day is the tour offered?
> - Are reservations required / suggested?
Tours are by appointment / reservation, so you'll have to talk to the 
factory or contact a dealer who will do same.

> - How do I get to the Factory?
It's right off a highway exit ramp, and several miles outside downtown 
Stuttgart via car.  Also, there's a U-Bahn stop across the street from 
it, and you can get the U-Bahn from the main rail station downtown.  
Sorry I can't be more specific; I tend to rely on local maps & subway 
maps, coupled with a strong instinct.  I'm sure any "local" could 
respond to a one word question "Porsche?"

Gee, I think this was about 90-120 minutes @100 mph last I did it.  You 
can also fly or train down (there's an airport in Stuttgart).

No, unless they've recently altered their policy.

They have a little trinket shop, but as with the tours, I do not know

Call PCNA in Reno, or through PCA, you could get Isle Nadele's (sp?)

702-348-3000.

Another tip: they have many little holidays, so make sure you don't

I've got the same problem, bent front wheel on my 86 951
with the one year only 23.3mm offset.

I think mine is a 7jx16 wheel though (phonedial)
Need to find a new one as this is pretty bad 
shape.  looks like an egg when rotating it (exagerate)

I've seen the ads for wheel repair
but never have heard a good world about
the procedure.  

Aluminium has a nasty habit of work-hardening
and then fracturing/cracking if a   
rework is attempted

Only thing I can think is that they somehow
anneal the metal and then put it in a jig
and PLASTICLEY deform the wheel back to coorect shape.

This would be 'black majic' as metal
always 'snaps back' (p
and comes to rest slightly inside position of
maximum deformation.

Lets keep eachother up.to.date on the subject

(better check the size of that wheel, it is marked on
the inside under all the road grime on one of the spokes)

Ok - you made me curious about what mine is costing, so here goes
Car:  1988 944 manual
Purchased:  used 1/30/93 with 79,000 $11,000
To Date:  91,000 miles total, 12,000 since purchase

One tire (nail):  $200
Shop maintenance:  $600 (misc, water pump and camshaft cover re-seal)
Sport suspension upgrades ($1100 - needed whole Koni assemblies for 
front)
Self maintenance $500 (front rotors, f & r pads, cam and balance shaft 
belts, oil, fluids, hood badge(!), fan switch, DME relay + my time 
(free cause this is relaxation)

total:  $2400 for maintenance and upgrades

P&I on loan $3523 to date
= payments  $.29 per mile
maintenance $.20 per mile
operating   $.13 per mile (gas and insurance)
total to date $.62 per mile
(or about the cost of payments alone on a mid-level japanese sedan)

I opted for high mileage, perfect condition, low $ vs. newer, low 
mileage, high $ expecting same maintenance requirements (similar point 
in planned maintenance cycle - 30K vs. 80K)...so far it's paid off on 
this previously dealer serviced car with pre-purchase inspection.

and...the market has the car above my original cost...plus it's funner 
than windsurfing...which was funner than golf...which is funner than 
sex (funner is a word, after all)
     
>Car:  1983 944 manual trans.

There was a big cost spike about a year ago with the radiator, head gasket, 
water pump, motor mount, etc. all failing within about 8 months but
since then (as it was before) it has been a very reliable and 
pleasurable car.  I have also
started performing my own maintenance (new differential shaft seals to
cure a transmission leak last weekend) which is both fun and cost effective.
     
Thanks for all the excellent advice, opinions, stories, etc.

Thanks to all who responded to my quest for the location of
my fuel pump.  As the car did not have one when purchased,
I was looking for the proper location to mount.
I received two different locations and they both were right,
sorta.  As it turns out, the original location was up above the
left trailing arm, but because of vapor lock problems, was
moved into the cavity directly behind the fuel tank.  I found the
remnants of a bracket and hose clamps which supports this.

RE> 914 Part Numbers
Hmm...  Not to criticize you, but....

The 74 1.8L fuel pump should be the same part number as the
early fuel pumps.  The later model was not used until MY 75
(except, of course for the "car-du-jour" thing that we've
all discussed before).

Just saying folks should pay attention to disclaimers, and
check things out for themselves.  Thanks for the part num-
bers, though!

Subject: 951 War stories: Clutch, brakes, maintenance


to: Douglas Dykaar


You metioned Clutch problems.
Well before I bought my 951 at 51k mi the dealer replaced
the clutch for chatter problem (I think that was the prob).
It maby cost $1k for warantee. $3k is insane!

Well anyway my clutch does work very nice and has never given
me any problmems (I hope that continues)

I would rather doubt that changing to the 931 brakes
would do you much good unless your out racing (doubt that)
The 951 brakes seem to do a tremedous job as is
as metioned earlier it is wise to flush the 
brake system every 1-2 years with the DOT 4 
extra high boil point fluid (Castrol ect..)
(be sure to suck fluid from reervoir before flushing)

Anyway, your car is just a baby 35k mi.  its jus barely broken in!
Q: have you changed to Autothroity ROM chip, or any other RacyExtras?

Keep the following in stock:

1. full set of radiator hoses
2. latest water pump (new not rebuilt IMHO)
   >don't forget to punch out adapter-tube for turbo cooling cicuit)
3. Motor Mount for right side (assume this WILL go bad)
4. Cam belt. change every 30k-35k miles (needs $$ tension tool)
5. Schematic of wiring system and voltmeter. (hope you have trouble
    shooting skills for that rare but anoying occasion)
6. phone number for Europroducts in FL

repairs/trouble for me has been:

water pump & cam belt 80k   annoying to fix
Motor mounts 48k, 52k  hellish bitch to fix
hatch frame-damaged by a fool who closed hatch onto cargo 90k
radiator hoses 51k to 115k (procrastination gets you nowhere) easy fx
heater valve 120k (blew heat with valve closed)  easy fix
CV joint 1 at 60k easy to fix
sunroof bits  60k very easy fix
Radiator-damaged by road debris $300 ouchey
Relays:  
	both DME/fuel pump 100k and radiator fans 70k
           these were a pain to track down but I replaced
 	with my own realy solution.  a 30 amp relay now
	pulls the fuel pump.  and a RadioShaft unit fixed
	the radiator realay -both fixes are undetectable
Shocks (dampers) in rear easy fix
	front struts are welded together so require tube
	cutter and MIG welder to rebuild (or find used
	944 strut towers that have removeable ends)

well thats all I can think of for now, good luck!

I have the current NADA "Official Used Car Guide" which lists '86 944
price averages being in the range of US$7100 (poor condition) to
US$11200 (excellent condition).  These prices match what I have
seen advertised.  Last time I checked (not recently)
there was about a 10% differential between US and Canadian
dollars.  So, $16000 Canadian seems several thousand too high.
Unless, of course, the demand in Canada for 944s is much higher than
in the US.  In that case, he should do his shopping in Seattle.

Ah, Stan, have you talked to anyone from California about this?  
In addition to the sniff test there's a "visual".  ALL original
smog control devices must be installed and connected.  The
smog check stations *are* set up to recognize all the gizmos :-(.  The
list is about the size of five phone books and is set up like the
catalog file at an autoparts store.   Your car *is* in there... or if
not (this may apply to euros) you get to make an appointment with a
"referee station" to prove your car's compliance.  The list is pretty
detailed.  I've deliberately been to sleepy backwoods garages for my
check, and they had no trouble finding my plugged vacuum retard line
(easy), AND my disconnected "vacuum limiter" (deceleration valve thingy,
way up at the front of the engine).  Cat pipe or SSI exhaust?  Forget it!
(That's how I got my time to R&R 911 exhaust down to about 
about an hour... I got to practice every two years!)   Obviously they
can't see your high-compression pistons or hot cam... but those are
in principle and fact illegal too.  Better make sure your idle at least
SOUNDS stock...

I'm tempted to snarl something about "smog nazis" and think about moving
to the hills... but then I might start sounding like Brock Yates (oops,
fellow Texan... sorry!).  The way I look at it, this is part of the
price for clean air, which I consider a worthwhile goal.  The
fact that pre-'67 clunkers can chuff around with 5 of 8 cylinders
working, or that diesels of ANY sort can still spew toxic soot at face
level, does make my good-citizen attitude a bit harder to sustain
though...  

Anyway my view is that we have smog laws to thank for the modern
computer-controlled engine, which lets even econoboxes have 
1 hp/cu in. engines, and Porsches have 11:1 compression ratios.
Tough smog laws DO make John and Jane Doe's 
Transportation Appliances run cleaner, averaged across the fleet.
THEIR catalytic converters won't be yanked by some cretin at the corner
station.  Those with the motivation can still find ways around the
rules... it's just that the knowledge-and-effort barrier to entry gets
raised a bit.  It's a sporting life!

ps  I of course no longer practice nor condone tampering with smog
control equipment in any way...

Hi All,
	I'm sorry to hear that not enough water pumpers come out to play in 
San Francisco. I happened to be in the City by the Bay that day for a 
little sightseeing with the family.  It was a BEAUTIFUL day. (Course I'm 
comparing it to the Chicago area) . 	
	I can't really tell you statistics about water pumpers at Chicago 
Region autocrosses, cause personally I'm only involved with the drivers 
schools and PCA Club Racing. My recollection from seeing autocross results 
in our club newsletter is that 944s and their various derivatives are well 
represented.
	I am a bit of a water pumper Porsche enthusiast being on my second 
one (and NEVER had to change a water pump) after having an early model 911. 
There's no reason that these cars shouldn't be at any of the various 
performance events. Talk it up - write a challenge in your GGR's newsletter 
 - some things like that might improve attendance.
	BTW, the second '94 PCA Club Race will be at Road Atlanta on April 
10. Anybody else gonna be there? I guarantee you'll see plenty of water 
pumpers!

	about 3 years ago i replaced the shocks on my 928 with BOGE gas
shocks. i've have finally come to the conclusion that my front ride 
height is too
high, by about 1 inch.  i had thought the car looked higher when i was done
replacing them, but there weren't too many 928's around to look at :-). anyway,
i finally noticed the relavent passage in the service manual: basically it says
that some 928's came with gas shocks, and if you put them on a car that didn't
have them, you should change the springs, otherwise your ride height will be
honked up" ah ha! and they even give a part number for this new spring.

	my question is this: i've been considering trying to find a junked
928 S that came with gas shocks (bilsteins, probably) and buy the springs,
adj. perches, and sway bar to put on my car. does anyone know if the sway bar
will fit on my '79? also, how can i identify the correct spring if i 
find it in a junk-
yard? will it be shorter? do they have the part number on them somewhere?

	or should i just save my pennies and buy aftermarket springs from
someone like weltmeister?


	thanks for any suggestions you can make.

Subject: electric fuel pumps/oxygenated fuel



One additional thought/concern I've had since we were
forced to use this voodo-science oxygenated fuel:

The electric fuel pump is basically a normal electric
motor that runs totally submerged in gasoline - it's as
if you took a regular electric motor and dunked it in
a drum of gasoline and turned it on. The only thing that
keeps it from cooking itself or starting a fire is lack
of oxygen. By oxygenating the fuel are they providing
enough to prematurely fry the brushes from arcing?
I've never seen anything about it, but then most of the 
research on this stuff has been done by the EPA, not by
car or petroleum companies.

Anyone seen anything on this, or is there a technical
reason that it shouldn't be a problem?

Well, I've finally made up my mind to sell 'old yellar'
Not an easy decision, because it's like parting with
a friend, however the reality of multiple kids in college
for the next 8 years has forced me to re-examine
priorities.

Here's what I have-

    the good:

    '73 911E, Light Yellow original paint
    approx. 120,000 miles - engine rebuilt at 109,000
    with new "S" p/c's, new valve guides, cams, hyd.chain
    tensioners etc. ($5,000 rebuild with my labor)
    Full "S" suspension, brakes & Koni shocks,
    guages and sport seats (as ordered from factory)
    original Mechanical Fuel Injection working fine.
    New Bridgestone RE-71's

    the bad:

    Carpeting is worn out, original radio only gets 
    AM (although the car creates its own great music)
    The paint is stone chipped on the hood and pretty
    tired in some other places. 

    the ugly:

    Cookie Cutters (had to include them under ugly)
    There is rust on either side below the kick plate
    where water has gotten underneath. Also a little
    bubbling around the lower corner of the windshield.
    A yahoo moving company pulled one towing strap out
    by the roots and slightly tore two others away from
    the sheet metal when it was in transit from the West
    Coast. Currently sealed with epoxy.

    This is a Seattle car, never driven in salt, so it's
    much cleaner than average for the Northeast. The whole
    bottom is in great shape.

This is a great, fun car that has excellent track
possibilities. Asking $11,000 firm. 911 Shop manuals,
Parts Book and special tools included (>$500 value)

Yes.  Except buying here and moving it to Canada has hidden cost, I'm told:

	~30% exchange (US to Canadian)
	 9.2% duty at the border
	 7.0% GST (Gouge and Screw Tax)

So $16k Cdn translates to about $11k US.  But based on the Canadian
market I'm reading about it sounds like it's still a deal.

  I sympathize, but I also urge you to get a real net connection.  I'm a

there where the usage is based on time.  I use tapcis on compuserve, but 
still, for the reduction in noise there, you pay for the reduced level of

If at all possible, get a real internet connection, it's easier and

Hello Lance and other Porsche folks,

This is the second time I've seen a message like this, and I also saw the 
statistics. The first time I responded directly.

There are much less expensive ways of receiving this list than 
CompuServe. If you're in the Los Angeles area, e-mail me directly and 
we'll take it off line. If not, check out the local computer papers like 
microtimes, or computer currents to find a local BBS that has Internet 
e-mail. Most BBS's will give you unlimited e-mail, and some will give you 
Usenet News (good for very timely auto racing news) for around $15 to $20 
per month, flat rate.

If you're like me, you not only subscribe to porschephiles, but also to 
about 4 other lists, and read Usenet News. It would cost me $40/month on 
CompuServe! That's more than a loaded Cable TV bill.

My 2 cents, because I don't want to have porschephiles die from *too* 
much volume.

Yay! Somebody else knows about exploding fans! I went by Rimco in
Santa Ana that morning and found out that they also have a fan fix. I
hadn't yet seen Mike's message re furnace-brazed fillets, but I gather
that Rimco just MIG welds over the tabs and rebalances the fan.
 
Is Scat really out of business? Three months ago they were still alive
and well. The address I have is Scat Enterprises, 1400 Kingsdale Ave.,
Redondo Beach, CA.  90278  tel. 1-213-370-5501. (The area code may
be 310 by now). I'll call or visit there tomorrow to get the info on their
fan fix.
 
There is also a Type 4 fix that applies to Type 1 (and 356) engines. It
involves putting a Type 4 fan shroud and improved fan on the old
engine. I didn't want to take that course due to originality considerations.
Did I post that address? It's Oregon Performance Products, 503-628-3409. The
contact name I have is Joe LoCicero.

                 THE RULES OF THE GAME


     OK, it certainly does appear that the Maestro has been
Challenged by a Certain Someone here on Porschephiles. Even
called Chicken (among other things) by said Certain Someone.

     Well, the Maestro is not one to shirk from Challenges,
be they transmutating defunct 356/912 Disasters into Gold
Plated Engines or learning to use Unix. After all, he's been
criticized for using the "!" all too often, so using Unix
should come easily. (HAH!)

     As the Maestro understands it (and I've talked to him
recently, so he does seem to understand), the Challenge is
for he and the Certain Someone to meet at some Mutually
Agreeable Time at a Mrs. Olsen's Driveway somewhere in the
California desert, to "test" both cars down some unspecified
portion of the 4-mile long driveway.

     Unspecified was whether Top Speed, Lowest Elapsed Time,
Best Gas Mileage, Highest Thermal Efficiency etc., would
determine the winner. Or whether one would race alone or
both race side by side. And if racing side by side, whether
Ben-Hur Chariot spikes or Double-Oh-Seven's lateral rotor
rooters would be allowed. 

     As you see, I'm merely attempting to define the
Guidelines, as the Lines are our Friends.  And, in the
spirit of World Peace and the  Internet, I think that
Porschephiles should VOTE on the Rules, or maybe suggest
some of their own. (After all, isn't this more interesting
than discussing what color and type leather one just MUST
have on the optional passenger's side power dildo?) 

     Now then, I modestly propose a few Rules. First of all,
I think since this is a so-called Porschephiles group
(despite the number of times those Fix It Again Tony's
{FIATS} have been mentioned recently), the vehicles to be
ah, "tested" or "compared"  should be Porsches.

     I think we can all agree on that. (After all, the
Maestro could borrow his friend's Austin Healey Sprite with
the 426 Chrysler Hemi, (Really!) or the late, great, Dean
Pfundstein's Allison V-12 Aircraft Engine in the 1927
Dusenburg Twin-Cowl Phaeton. And you could bring the spare
Saturn V from Florida. But, really, what purpose would be
served by that? 

     So, clearly, the Vehicles must be Porsches.

    And clearly, the vehicles should be driven to the test
site. (And, hopefully, driven back home.) Vehicles should
not be trailered, unless you break down on the way to the
event, in which case towing is then, mercifully, allowed.

 
     Now, as to what Model Porsche should be compared. Since
I lay no claim to fame with "900" series Porsches, (save the
912, which many including myself are trying to do), but will
match my knowledge of 356/912 Engines with anyone on this
Planet, or in this Solar System for that matter, clearly the
cars compared must be 356's or 912's.

      Next, what Prime Mover should be allowed? Again, since
we're talking 356/912, I'd say any 356/912 Pushrod engine
(note that word "pushrod", if you want to discuss using
4-Cams, like in "Real Carreras have 4 Cams", we can talk
about that too, but certainly, no 928's, 911's, 944's, 914's
nor Nine-Two-Fours. 

     So, let's say pushrod Porsche 356/912 Engines from 1950
'till the end of production, or if you'd like to use my
Engine Data Base, Case Casting Numbers from 1 to say,
122,000. 356/912 Replacement Case Engines with no Case
Casting Numbers are allowed too, with Date Stamps up to
1/71. (January, 1971- YES they DID make 356 Engines long
AFTER the '69 912 was made! Military Industrials they were
too.)

                  Now, the Internal Parts:

    Crankshaft- a stock 356 A/B/C/912/Super-90 crank with
Stock Stroke (no clever Crank Grinding and no SPG nor
Expensive Aftermarket cranks. After all, this is the
Porschephile group...

      Rods- stock 356 A/B or C/912 with Porsche Part Numbers
on them. Again, no Carillo rods, 4-cam rods, just your
choice of pushrod 356/912.

      Camshaft- open. Here's where you can creative.

       Cam followers- open- as long as they're ATE 3000, ATE
3900 or ATE 21411.

       Flywheel & Clutch - open.

       Piston & Cylinders- any piston manufactured by Mahle
or Kolbenschmidt for the 356 or 912.  No Arias, no MC's, no
"shastas", no NPR's, no Badgers, no 911 pistons in 912
cylinders. Unless you want something different. 

       Heads- any 356 A/B/C/SC/912/Super-90. If you use '68
912 heads, you can even hook up the air injection to be smog
legal. (Which brings us to another question- should the
vehicles pass a California Smog Inspection prior to the
"testing"? (Just kidding.) Actually, 356's are EXEMPT from
California Smog Inspections! That's a lovely word isn't it?
Exempt. 912's aren't however, exempt, so a Smog Test for
them may be in order, but I'll leave that up to
Porschephiles. 

       Valves- any "Ate" valve Originally used in
356A/B/C/SC/912/Super-90 heads. Includes Ate 3030, Ate 3044
or Ate 3041 Intakes. And the Ate 3043, Ate 3045, or Ate 3048
exhausts. No Datsun Valves. No Shevroley valves. And,
please, PLEASE, no Fiat valves. 

       Compression ratio- Open, but the fuel should be
Unleaded Premium pump gas such as Chevron Supreme. Or Arco.
Or Union 76. Or as agreed. No Nitromethane. No Nitrous
Oxide. No mothballs in the gas tank.  No hidden batteries.
And I promise not to use a Nuclear Reactor. 

      Carburetion- any 356/912 pushrod carburetor, includes
Single Barrel 32 and 40 Solexes, Zenith 32NDIX, Solex 40PII.
We can argue about Webers, or Dell'ortos, but certainly no
fuel injection.  Stock venturis- 28mm for Zeniths, 32 mm for
Solexes. Jets are open. (Ifin your jets are closed you
probably won't win.)

       Distributor- any 356/912 pushrod Distributor. To save
money, I'm willing to allow the .009 or .050 distributor
too. Or a CDI (For those unfamiliar with the term, CDI
predates and is not the same as Compact Disk Interactive.
It's  "Capacitive Discharge Ignition" system). 

      Muffler- any Stock 356/912 muffler, as we don't want
to disturb the neighbors.

      Sheet Metal- open, except there should be a fan shroud
with a working generator. A working heater system or no, is
left for Porschephiles to decide. (After al, it can get cold
in the desert.) Gold plating of the bands and straps and 1'
diameter generator cover (shroud) is arguably allowed.

     Enforcement of The Rules. (Remember, this is only a
proposal.) How about, at the end of the "testing", EITHER
party can buy the other's engine for some agreed-upon price-
say $5000. (Just like claimer horse racing- interesting
twist, huh?).

    Likewise if either party believes the other is not
playing by The Rules (shame, shame), the first party can put
up, say, $1000. The second party must either forfeit the
race or tear down his engine. 

     If, after teardown, the Second Party's engine is found
to violate The Rules, the First Party's $1000 is returned,
and the second party loses the Race and/or his engine too,
(you decide Porschephiles), and has a long walk to the parts
store for a gasket set. If the engine is found NOT to
violate The Rules, the $1000 is given to the Second Party
and the results of the race are unchanged.

      Criteria that Determines the winner:

      Here I defer once again to the Porschephiles group- I
think THEY should decide by vote what it takes to win this
Challenge. Should it be: Top Speed? Lowest Elapsed Time?
Maximum Thermal Efficiency/Best Gas Mileage? Lowest
Emissions? Or some esoteric combination of the above? Think
about it Porschephiles, always keeping in mind what we're
trying to prove here,... what ARE we trying to prove here?

    First of all, And if a Vote were taken on The Rules.
Should it be a  "Secret" Ballot? And if so, how would one
"do" a Secret Ballot on the "open" Internet? CAN one have a
Secret Ballet on the Internet, or is that an impossibility?
This IS the Information Superhighway, so what are the Rules
of the Road anyhow? Just asking. 

      Second of all, do we really want to waste Precious
Natural Resource zooming down some woman's driveway out in
the middle of the Desert? (The Maestro flashes on the hero
from "Back to the Future", who in one time continuum when
called Chicken for not drag racing his pick-up truck,
decides to race and is killed. Stupidity killed that cat, as
it were. And the Maestro has seen many engines killed by
Stupidity. MURDERED by Stupidity.)

    And, come to think of it, which car would the Maestro
take to this event anyhow? Would he cheat and take the 1963
Porsche Polizei (Police) car and ARREST his adversary for
something.  No, that wouldn't be sporting.

     Well, what about the car he'd like to take to the
desert- the '58 Cabriolet. What fun- top down in the Desert
sun. The transmission is finally installed, but not the
engine yet. Nor the interior. Nor the shakedown cruise.
Maybe by summer (it was supposed to be done by Spring. The
Cobbler's Kids always go Barefoot.)


     So, that leaves Trusty Rusty, who although truly
Trusty, is sadly Rusty. And thus, if the Rust in Trusty
Busts something, which causes a Fuss, the Maestro may be
Dust. For some, that's a Plus.

     So, rather than risking extremely valuable cars as well
as Life & Limb by driving like maniacs in someone's driveway
(not to mention wasting Precious Natural Resources), how
about we just dyno test the engines on say, the same chassis
dyno? Plot the HP curve. Thermal Efficiency. Emissions. Plug
into the Porschephile Pformula and determine the winner?

I just happen to know where an Independent Dyno resides.

    Or would it be better to forget the whole thing and
answer people's questions about Porsche Problems instead?

    Wasn't that the purpose of Porschephiles anyhow? Oh,
right. That's it. I forgot for a moment.

      Anyhow, this is the Maestro's first draft of the
proposed rules. Comments, Criticisms, or dirty jokes will be
appreciated.


     The things we go through to:

                 KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!!!

Does anyone know how to stop a dash from cracking?.

I live in Ottawa where we get extreme cold and extreme heat. The car is 
always garage parked - unheated at home, heated at work. The dash of my 944

Interesting bug, but I'd like to know more about your crew cab. My slalom
co-driver and I are looking for one, as a support vehicle for vintage
racing and a daily driver for him. We found one for $2500, a '63, but the
owner says the engine doesn't run and the reduction gears need replacement
and there's rust around the drip rail (!??) so we passed on it without
looking. Do you have any recommendations for what to look for/what
reasonable asking prices might be? We think we ought to look for a 65 or
older, because that way we can put in any engine we want (911 !) and not
worry about California smog inspection.

Jim Selders replied to Craig's question re Porsche factory tours.
 
Some recollections from somebody who spent years and years there --
 
They're not open Saturday.
 
The museum is easy to get into, the factory tour less so but doable. If you
have problems getting a reservation through normal channels, write back and
I will get one of my friends there to get you in. I don't want to impose on
him if it can be avoided, so try the normal channels first.
 
Normal channels -- the fellow who runs the museum would probably also be in
charge of plant tours. For years, this was Herr Peter Schneider, but he left
the company to run a museum in Bavaria, so I don't know who his replacement
is. You could try calling 01149-711-827-5484 and see who picks up. (I think that number's right;
they changed the prefix on all their extensions recently). Or try faxing the
press department, 01149-711-827-5111. Address it to Frau Susanne
Hutter-Lang, she's very helpful and fluent in English.
 
Getting there -- from the main train station, go underground (look for the
green "S" signs, for the S-Bahn -- the commuter rail system). Once under the
train station, you want to take a train marked S6, for Leonberg or Weil der
Stadt. Do not take the S6 (or anything else for that matter) marked
Schwabstrasse (that's going the wrong way, to the end of the line just past
downtown). Do NOT take one of the other trains which according to the map
will stop in Zuffenhausen; that's still a mile short of where you want to be,
and the lines split there for Kornwestheim etc. You want the S6, and get off
at NEUWIRTSHAUS. You will see the pink striped (honest) Porsche factory as
you leave the station. Head for the pink complex kitty-corner across the
main intersection. So head down the main street (Schwieberdinger Strasse),
turn right to go up Strohgaeustrasse, turn left at the first side street
(Moritz Horkheimer Strasse) to enter the plant complex from the back side.
Where Horkheimer meets the next side street, Porschestrasse, is a guard post
and the museum building. If you are picking up a new Porsche on tourist
delivery, this is also where your car will be prepped and turned over.
 
If you're looking for car parts, tools and accessories, there's a store
right in the middle of all the Porsche factory buildings. The company is
Trost or Riehle, I think they just changed names, on
Schuetzenbuehlenstrasse. (On opposite side of Strohgaeustrasse from complex
housing museum).
 
Arriving by Autobahn, from the Stuttgart-Heilbronn Autobahn take the
Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen exit. This will put you on the B10. Take the first
exit from the B10, by this time there are signs for Porsche. When you come
over the hill, you can't miss Big Pink. Turn left into Strohgaeustrasse,
leaving the old Werk I behind to your right, and see above for streets to
museum (basically turn left, turn left again, find guard, ask).
 
Good maps for getting around Stuttgart -- I like the Falk-Plan series.
Clever accordion-folded things, available everywhere. (Bookstores, train
stations, gas stations).
 
Getting from Frankfurt to Stuttgart, I think is typically 2-3 hours if there
are no problems on the Autobahn. Near Hockenheim (Autobahnkreuz Walldorf)
you make a choice, whether to go Karlsruhe-Pforzheim-Stuttgart-Heilbronn and
get off at Zuff going north, or go Heilbronn-Stuttgart and get off going
south. I think the Heilbronn-Stuttgart route will be quicker, but not by
much. You go right past the Museum Auto+Technik Sinsheim that way. Can't
miss it, it's on the left.
 
Don't fly to Stuttgart. Waste of money, and you're still at least an hour
from Porsche via public transport once you've landed. Take the train, for a
real treat take the new ICE (Inter-City Express). It won't reach stunning
speeds on the Frankfurt-Stuttgart run, but it's still a blast. Goes every
hour, I think. You may have to change trains or catch the ICE in Mannheim
or Mainz.
 
While in Stuttgart, you may want to check out the Model Car Center
Stuttgart, a neat shop with all sorts of things from big Tamiya kits through
1/43 resin kits, and everything in between. It's in a galleria (arcade?)
down past the end of Koenigstrasse, sort of at the corner of Marienstrasse
and Sophienstrasse, I think it's called the Marienpassage.
 
They have a goodie shop, but I don't think anything is open Saturdays.
Germans gotta shop sometime, and when the stores close at 6 PM weekdays they
take Saturdays very seriously.
 
Ilse Naedele's phone number in Ludwigsburg is 01149-7141-303283. Phone might
be answered by her assistant, Herr Till. Both are fluent in English. Frau
Naedele is Porsche's contact person for all the Porsche clubs all over the
world.
 
Hope that helps. Now I'm homesick and wanna go back this summer. Probably
take my mint '65 C coupe along to avoid hassling with car rentals. <g>

SCAT, while still in business as of a couple of weeks ago anyway, *SHOULD* be
out of business. After probably 17 years of doing business with them with
*NO* problems, a great deal of respect for the products and guys behind them,
etc., I got screwed by them in a MAJOR way last year. I bought a cam, and as
is my custom, new cam followers for my 914 racer from them. After less than
5 hours of operation, the cam was flat and the followers an average of 1/2"
eaten off the bottom of them. Needless to say, the resulting slurry did the
rest of the engine no particular good. Complete disaster was averted only by
the 4 micron Canton/MECA high-pressure full-flow cartridge oil filter I had
previously installed (this thing worked so well that I pulled a huge plug of
metal out of the filter, but could *ALMOST* re-use the main bearings!)

Anyway, metalurgical analysis said the cam had not been hardened. So I call
SCAT with my receipt in hand, and lab report close by. And ask them to 
send me at no cost a replacement cam, new lifters, cam gear, set of bearings
and gasket kit (and I was willing to not require them to replace the other
parts, just the stuff they sold me, as long as they were reasonable about
it).

Their president, owner, etc. Tom Whatsizname, had one basic response: "blow
me." Had them pull up all the Stan Hanks, Elmer Fohey, FW AutoClinic, Ghost
Racing, and FlatFour Performance invoices for the last 20 years and add up
the value and revaluate his position. His comment, "yeah, well so your team
has spent about $120,000 here over the last 20 years. So? Blow Me. Blow my
shop foreman, too." Well, more or less... 8{)

Now, all I'm asking for is parts with my wholesale cost of roughly $120.
NOT a big deal. I even send them the failed parts for *THEM* to analyse.
No dice. Conclusion once they see the stuff: "oh -- it sure did fail.
And here's why -- you used Eaton lifters, we only sell Sealed Power.
So, you used inferior stuff and the whole thing is your fault."

Had them pull my invoices and offered to eat the damn thing if they could
find *ANY* invoice which included a cam order and DID NOT include a 
set of lifters. That got us back to "blow me".

FINE. I'd wasted a huge amount of time on this, it was for a tiny amount
of money but a HUGE amount of principle. So I just gave up and filed an
action with the CA attorney general on deceptive trade practices and
failure to warranty faulty goods. That action is still pending. I also
advertised in the community of T4 guys and found some other people who
needed to file the same action. Hopefully, we'll get some satisfaction.

In the meantime, SCAT is off my vendor list, and I take every opportunity
to tell everyone I can about it. I replaced all the stuff I'd previously
used SCAT for mainly with FAT Performance. I do have my cranks done locally
though, since I found someone who can do very, very good work for a very
reasonable price.

> There is also a Type 4 fix that applies to Type 1 (and 356) engines...

And there is another fix for T4 and T1 that involves using a 911 style

That leaves Rimco again. I may go by there again today, maybe pick up a used

Actually, the float level may affect the mixture. When the needle in the SU 
moves up because of vaccum changes, it exposes an ever larger opening for 
gas to flow through. I would guess that the amount of gas going through the 
opening must be related to the pressure built up by the height of the fuel 
in the bowl. It's been a long time since I thought about SU carbs, however.

    Actually, there are a *lot* of shops around that can't tell
a Porsche from a Buick (damn near)!  One listed my 914 as a VW
1600, checked Carbs OK, checked FI N/A (on a stock 1.8L!), and
asked me if I had all the right equipment on!  If you look, I'm
sure you could find someone who has no clue...

My Targa top is starting to tear along the fold lines. 
Right now I have about a 1 or 2 inch tear. How
can I repair it?

I think the best thing to do is to get a new roof skin
109.95 (US version) and $154.00 (German version) from 
Performance products 800-423-3173

I don't think there a difference between the 2 versions.

Many of the GPS manufacturers manufacture vehicle tracking and vital signs 
systems that could be adapted t o do the job. The GPS unit is readily 
available but the problem is activating the signal and transmitting it to 
someone who can track it .  The radio options are (today) ARDIS or RAM radio 
networks which give far from universal coverage,  soon CDPD will be an 
option and later (96?) Iridium from Motorola. You also need a facility to 
monitor and track stolen vehicles just as security companies monitor home 
alarm systems. Therfore you will end up with a packaged solution like many 
home security service companies offer consisting of hardware, communications 
facilities, and monitoring services. The cost could be prohibitive plus it 
may be tough to install the hardware in a way that makes it tamper proof.

Having said all that , no doubt someone will figure it all out at a 
competitive price soon.

At some point, the price of a gps unit which can be remotely controlled
to send it's position back on demand should be affordable and worthwhile.

The FBI should provide these free, as it would help them track down car
thief rings.

While clean air is indeed a worthwhile goal, the Cal "visual" check 
is not part of the price for it - it is part of the price of bad government.
It means that you are not allowed to make your car run cleaner than stock.
If it's a '74, it has to pollute like a '74...

	Well,  I did the Porsche factory tour on my honeymoon
lastmonth, so I will answer as best I can.

>Questions I have are:

>- Are tours available on Saturday?  I'm thinking of April 30

	Sorry, only weekdays.  Bummer for us to.

>- What times in the day is the tour offered?

	You MUST reserve a time in advance.  My option was
basically 'what day do you want to tout on? - Okay we wil
see you there at 9:30 AM'  I wasn't given a choice on that.

>- Are reservations required / suggested?

	You MUST make a reservation.  I can get you the number 
for whom to call (the person changed recently.)

>- How do I get to the Factory?

	After you make your reservation they will send you
a really nice little brochure that gives directions, etc.  It is 
pretty hard to miss because the exit is Zuffenhausen...  I would
give you better directions, but I was sick as a dog when I was
there, and parts are a little bit blurry.

>- How long would it typically take to get from Frankfurt to
>   Stuttgart, assuming moderate autobahn speeds :) ?

	What are moderate autobahn speeds :-).  Got me on this
one.

>- Does it cost anything?

	Well, the TOUR doesn't cost anything, but there are the
hidden costs, like that T-shirt you just have to have.  My
that beach towel which is REALLY cool, etc.

>- Do they have a 'goodie shop' open on Saturdays?

	Yup.  They actually have two.  Now the secret (passed to
my by Steve Stomski) is how to find the second one.  The first
one is in the front of the museum, but the second one is much better.  
It is in the same building, but closer to the front gate.  What you do
is go outside, make a left and go in the first door.  You can also 
reach it without going outside the building by going through the
owners waiting room (which is also worth seeing - lots of racing
memorabilia on the walls).  That shop has the T shirts, pins, towel.  And,
if you buy something and ask about posters, they will give you a bunch
free.  I got 4 I think.  When I get to mounting the two I wanted to
keep I will probably offer the other two to some 944 owners out
there.

>- Does anyone have a contact address/phone/FAX for the
>   Factory in case I should need to get in touch with them?

	Nope, buy I do have the number for the person at PCNA to
make reservations through.

>Thanks in advance for the help!

	I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did (without being
as sick ;-().

>-Craig Huber,  '71 911T Coupe

	Oh, and as an FYI for those following my reconstructionof
my '74 1.8L.  I drove it to work for the first time today.  It is
finally a totally LEGAL car.  Though the DMV wouldn't believe the 
purchase price of 1500 and want to see a bill of sale ;-(.

Has any Porschephile had experience with using any of the Jacobs Ignition 
systems on a Porsche motor.  I read Dr. Jacobs' book "The Doctor's Guide 
to Optimizing your Ignition", and he presents a good case for his 
systems.  He seems a bit opinionated at times, but most experts 
occationally do.

I have been thinking about installing one of his systems on my 911SC, and 
now I see that Performance Products is plugging them in their latest

Any information will be appreciated.

There isn't much more you can do to slow down the cracking.  You're doing the
right thing.  Ultra violet rays are the great destructors of plastic.  I
think your dash is cracking because it's loosing its plasticizers from
exposure to ultra violet rays more than extreme cold/heat.

There are commercial dash replacement covers you can buy.  I suggest buying
one made of ABS (a more durable plastic).  When installed properly, they look
surprisingly good.  Then purchase a sunscreen and cover your dash whenever
the car is exposed outdoors.

I have a 12 disc BMW (OEM Alpine) CD changer that hasn't skipped once.  My

my head jars like crazy -- and no skipping).

Subject: 914 Price Survey RE:

Subject: 914 prices RE:

 There's been some discussion on the net recently about 914 prices.
 I have noticed here in this region (kansas city mo. >> oklahoma city)
that prices and availability seem to ebb and flow along with the seasons.
 Last summer i looked at a 72 914 1.7 and a 73 2.0, the 2.0 was going for
3200 and the 1.7 for 2800.  Early last spring i looked at a 71 1.7 and
late last winter a 76 2.0 both for $750 after some ah, negotiating.
 
  I walked away from the 71, 72, & sadly the 73. The 72 and 73 were too
high priced and looked good, too good.  They were bondo queens, neither
had jack mounts to lift the body if you had a flat to change.  They were
gone!  Not a trace, and the owner's were proud!  The panels were smooth
where there should have been a hole for the jack! Who knows what was inside.

  I walked away from the 71 because it was too far gone to rustore, and
it only had a 1.7, it had the flexible body character when the door was
opened or the top removed.  Every one of these cars except the 76 had
new running gear like brakes, cables, tune up, or rotors.  They all had
motors with over 40000 since last rebuild and questionable upkeep and
care.  These could be driven home and possibly trusted out of town short
distances.

  The 76 had a shelled motor, broken hinges on the deck lid, the front
bumper had taken a whack hard enough to bend the trunk lip and making
the trunk lid impossible to close, and the interior and wiring looked
like birds had lived in it.  The rear bumper had taken a push and sustained
dent of a collapsed bumper shock.  The jack mounts were in place, but rust
had destroyed them.  Rust had thinned the trunk along the back facia, and
eaten holes in the longitudinals inside the front fenderwell.  The floorpan
was in pretty shabby shape.  The engine compartment lid was broke off the
hinges and weather had taken a toll on the innards.  Neither door worked
in order and the interior was in tatters and missing carpet.  The steering
wheel was dangling under the dash (as were the wiring) and the center
horn ring missing.  The A/C compressor was gone and so was the underdash
blower.  The seat mounts had rusted/broken loose and been poorly welded
back in place and now the reclining function was uncontrollable.  The paint
was earl scheib black over the original ivory white, with many chips and
blemishes, and incomplete coverage.  It had a 2.0 with no fuel injection,
no catalytic and no air pump or plumbing.  A side-shift transmission and
bald tires on aluminum wheels.  And the suspension console on the battery
side was in need of weldor's Tender Loving Care.

 -truly a car only a mother of a mechanic (or hard-core racer) could love..
 So I bought it (and i'm no racer) because it was a 2.0 with side shifter..
 Obviously, the car had nothing (much) to hide, and i'm a NO FEAR type with
914's.  I dont suggest you try this at home..

 The dealership wanted $995 so i offered 650 and went home without looking
back..two weeks later i stopped in and they countered with 750 and i
said ok, charge it!  I put in a battery, checked the oil and nursed it
home on 2 1/2 cylinders.  Thusly, the beginning of the Saga of '76.

  The interior had a lot of trash in it and about $20 in change..
  make that $730 after rebate.

Randy, 
	Try super glue at the ends of the crack. Make sure that the crack is 
clean(use denatured alcohol, freon, whatever to get the oils, Armor all, 
etc. away). Just a drop inside the flaw at the ends kept a crack in my 
old Chevy's dash from growing any since I did it 6 years ago. To stop 
the crack from widening, run a very small bead down the length of the 
crack(be careful not to get it all over the surface--it doesn't take much 
to do the trick). You might also consider getting one of those carpet 
covers to hide it completely from the sun but it sounds like thermal 
stress is what is causing the cracking.

Subject: Re: Brake caliper piston orientation??

Bill,

I *think* your car has the same floating-calliper, single-piston brakes
as my 944S, but I may well be wrong.  It sounds like you have the
workshop manuals, and I hope the following is enough for you to decode
their photo's.

The tool is a twenty-degree wedge, which I cut out of a piece of card-
board like you find at the back of a pad of paper.  In my car, the
relieved part of the brake piston is supposed to be on the bottom
part of the calliper.  As you can see from the photo, the "big" end
of the triangular tool is radially inward, the "skinny" end out.

I check by laying the cardboard "tool" along the bottom ramp of
the calliper, then moving it in or out to check the piston orientation.
Gee, this is one of those things that's incredibly simple to do and
show, but drives me nuts trying to describe!  If my explanation makes
no sense, say so and I can FAX you a drawing.

BTW, different Porsches place their relieving in different orientations.
It's there to equalize pad wear.  Not terribly critical, but it does
help even it and improve pedal response if you track your car.

Raman,

Flowing fuel cools and lubricates the fuel pump.  I suppose that crap in
the tank could ruin a pump if it got into it.  I'd first check for a
bad fuel filter.  If plugged and it's between the tank and pump, you
could be sucking air.  If after, I suppose blockage could also fry it.
