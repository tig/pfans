Subject: Porsche Publications again

I am submitting this Message to everyone again, because I recieve Porschephiles
digest version via the compuserve gateway.Compuserve has a E-Mail Limit
50k,so when the digest size exceeds this amount, guess what? I cannot read the
digest! So hopefully when you answer these questions this time around the digest
will be under 50k. Any other Compuserve people having this problem? Let me know.
I have addressed this problem to stan, he is currently working on a solution. If
you wish to send me mail directly from INTERNET, my address is
71324.3010@CompuServe.COM

Here it is again.....

I am currently looking for Books and misc.info about 944's. I have found several
in Excellence Magazine ads, Dragich and Moffett's. Some books seem hard to get,
because several several went out of print recently.
Dragich Auto literature is out of stock of these titles:

 #3186 Porsche 924-928-944
 #5174 Porsche 924/944 Book (Morgan)
 #4017 Road & Track on Porsche 1985-88

Can anyone help me locate these publications? Moffett's did not have the 924/944
Book (Morgan) either. They also did not have a book titled Porsche 924/928/944
(History Of), this may be the same book #3186 listed above that Dragich didn't
have? 

I did order "Porsche 944" (MacNamara), "Porsche 924 & 944 Collector's Guide",
"Porsche 944 (81-85)" (Brooklands) and "Car & Driver on Porsche(1982-1986)". Are
these good choices?
If someone has any of these titles I cannot find, I would not mind purchasing
them used (good condition). I have heard of a book called "Porsche facts", what
is this about and how can I buy it?

Any help or advice would be great. I have a 86' 944 Turbo (951) that I purchased
recently (Mint). When I am not driving it I  really enjoy reading about it.

I would like to thank, at this time all of you fellow Porschephiles who have
answered my questions in the past. It has really given me insight about my car,
saved me $$$ too.

                 WKD.482.220 (1 volume 944 turbo 1986-1987)

I have read in several catalogs that the 924 set WKD.481.521 (4 volumes) is
required to complete the set for an 1986 944 turbo. Is this true?

I would like to find the parts list for this year & model. Is this only
available in Microfich format? I know all parts lists were once available in
hard copy form.Any info would be greatly appreciated.Maybe someone has it?
It would really help when ordering parts.It is real confusing sometimes.
O.E.M./ O.E./Aftermarket,etc.  And how about this EuroSelect catalog put out by
Porsche Cars Of North America,that is in effect going to compete with the

Subject: Wheel Shimmy Revisited

Thanks everyone for answering all my questions concerning my 86' 944 Turbo
(951), several weeks back. The problem turned out to be bad upper strut
bearings, not a wheel balance problem after all. Took the car to a clinic and it
was discovered. I am going to take the car to the shop next week to have the
work done. Is it a big job? How much are the parts? Is this normal with 85,000
miles on the car? Any comments? Mechanic said wheel alingnment is nessessary
after replacement.

Original submission:

I removed the front wheels to inspect the brake pads, after I replaced the pads
and sensors, I then replaced the wheels. Each wheel was put back on the same
side it came off of. After I did this, when I would reach 60+ mph I noticed a
shimmy in the steering wheel which previously 
was not there. As far as I can see all balance weights are still intact.I did
not put the wheels on the hub exactly as they were,is this critical? I also used
a torque wrench set @ 45 ft. lbs. per spec. ,and cross tightned all lug nuts. Is
ths a common problem when removing wheels, for I've heard that front end shimmy
in early 944's was a problem? If this helps I Have 16" "phone dial type wheels.

I'm sure Murphy or a cousin had a theory about this;  we hoped for
dry weather in California.  Since it decided to rain on moving day
last year, and now that the rain has once again become a nuisance (I'm 
being nice here), is there a 'preferred' brand of wiper blades?  
(specifically, for the 944, and who has them priced for those of us 
attempting negative deficit spending?)

And, while my brain is idling, has the option of mirror wipers been offered
by Porsche?

Half-axles are the fun part of an engine rebuild, I think.  I did a lot of
cussing trying to get the dang things on and off.  It's really fun when you
don't have much room under the car to maneuver.  I just rapped on them with a
rubber mallet until they freed up.

Ted, I had this exact problem for a long time.  I would drive around kicking
up a cloud of smoke from the oil leaking on my heat exchangers.  Downright
embarrassing.  I did everything I could think of:  turbo valve
covers(helped), collapsable oil return tubes, hell, I even tried to silicone
under the valve covers.  Still had the problem.  Then, I had a chain
tensioner fail, so I dug in and rebuilt my engine(easier than I thought it
would be.)  Got the sucker running again, and it still leaked!  Finally, I
torqued the rocker shafts up tight, and presto, no more leaks.  The shop
manual tells you to use a torque wrench, but I couldn't find one that small,
so I just torqued them really tight.  Did the trick.

Yes you need 924 manuals for things like rear suspension, but I've
hound that most of the stuff in there is really obvious enough that you
don't need the manual.  Then again, I found pulling the motor obvious
enough to do without the manual (which shoves in a few unessacary
steps) and some operations needing extra steps (like pulling the oil
pan with the engine in the car), so all is a matter of opinion.

I have the factory manuals and used them mainly for overveiw purposes.

Stan,
THANKS for the feedback. It was just what I was looking for. I guess I DID 
lie, I may be doing some drivers school and may autox. So you CAN make a 
1.8 into 2.0, sorta? I mean more that just bigger jugs? Or am I mis-

my parts work? (Cooling fan/housing, engine sheetmetal, intake and exhaust

bolt up to my tranny and motor mounts? Once again thanks.

Subject: Gas heaters for air-cooled w/o heat


  Seriously, I'm also interested in sources for 6 volt 356 gas heaters.
  Also for US "fresh air" heater systems -- that's one option mine
  doesn't have...

Sorry Stan, now you have to wait in line...

  One of the crazier ideas I've seen for a while comes from VW land --
  see, you block off your oil cooler, and run a line from the block-off
  fitting through the back bulkhead of the car to a heat exchanger under
  the back seat. There you also have a fan and some duct work, and
  voila! instant heater... Of course, you also usually need another 
  heat exchanger somewhere else to really cool the oil, and all other
  appropriate plumbing, like some way to turn this off in the summer or
  if the Fat Man sits in your back seat or...

Hmm, yes this is truly crazy, but then again I asked for it didn't I?
I was thinking more along the lines of some sort of JC Whitney kit for
a VW or something, but the only thing they have is the electric
heaters in the catalog. Didn't Porsche once use a "Webasto" heater or
something. If it mounted in the front trunk of a 911 I was hoping I
could wedge one in the front trunk of my 914 and attach some sort of
blower fan into the ductwork, still retaining the functionality of the
original heat/vent controls. For example, on the 914, like the 911,
the heat comes up through the rocker panels in cardboard tubes and
then up each side behind the dash and into the ducts. Now I could
disconnect the cardboard tubes and plumb in an auxiliary heater device
(tbd) and run it through the stock vent system from inside the trunk.

How does this sound?

How does the VW bus do it? How does the early 911 with gas heater do
it?

Thankyou,

Your wheels should be anodized, with the spokes colored platinum metallic,
which I guess you could describe as a bronze color.  The tires you have on
the car are now pretty standard for that year/model.  They give a good
jump in performance, while still fitting under the fenders.  The standard
pressures you should run are something like 29 in front and 34 or 35 in
back.  You know, my car shows about 5 more mph than it goes as well.  I
need to find out how to get it recalibrated.  Wonder if it's been
increasing the mileage on my car proportionately?

Subject: 951 chips and track use

A few comments on 951 chips:

1) Autothority chips with their boost bolt @.8 bar boost yeild 278 HP

2) Same chips with NO boost mod yeild about 245 HP

3) If you mix extra boost and track events you must do the following
	to ensure reliability

	a) Make SURE the head is torqued to the '89 torqu spec,  whcih
	was changed and is reflected ONLY in updated manuals (Instead
	of a straight spec of 50 ft/lbs its's something like 20 plus 2
	1/4 urns whihc yeilds roughtly 95 ft-lbs.

	Don't quote these specs though, as they are from memory.

	b) Replace rod bearings every 50 hours of use or annually This
	is NO fun.  Having done it wice without engine removal and
	alone I can say that it is less fun then a clutch.  Which is
	saying something!

	c) Run some type of synthetic oil

I would also recommend addn'l oil cooling.  The main effects of this
are twofold.  1) It's like getting 556 HP from a 928 motor, so you can
imagine wear and tear on rod bearings et al is a concern.  2) Heat is
excessive, so any way you can get it out of the OIL would increase life
expectncy.

I blew a motor coming out of turn 10 at summit as a result of rod
bearing failure.  4 mos later (new motor) I lost a head gasket in the
same place when the bozos who built it used the old torque spec on head
studs.  After those tow incidents, the car ran 2 heavy seasons (and got
one new set of od bearings) before being sold.

FROM: Scott Jessen
'     CITC ATD/Upstream, CPDN Chevron Tower IT Team
'
SUBJECT: 968/911, 911 Oil Sender Diag & Stan's trip

I had the opposite experience in my 1st exposure to the 968 as the previous
poster had in driving a late 911 and contrasting it to the 944/968s. I've
owned a handful of 911s and seriously competed in a couple of them. One of my
early 1st experiences was kinda' the opposite of Stan's "scare the daylights
(or other things) out of the salesman", in that in a dealer testride before
buying my 1st 911, the salesman took me on a full out, foot to the floor,
ride. Scared the crap out of me, and I knew then that I *had* to own a 911
*SOON*!

The 968 test drive was many, many AX and timetrial laps later, at the San
Diego PCA Parade. For those of you that went I hope you took advantage of the
free 968 drive there. For the others out there in Pfiles land: the SD Parade
had a practice AX course set up for the week, along with driving your own car
on it, a deal with a local Porsche Dealer and Michellin was arranged where
Michellin provided the tires (XGTV somthing or others) and the dealer provided
a *brand new* 968. All you had to do was sign up and you got two laps in the
car. It was an IROC AX of sorts, other than differences in tire wear and time
of day (temp was very consistent that week). So, you say, what did I think of
the car?? I liked it. The tires sucked (well ok, they're *really* for the
street), but even tho the car was heavy feeling and rolled too much in
transition, it was pretty quick (4K rpm dumps off the line helped), and, I got
4th and 5th fastest times for the week! (I was more proud of this than my class
win).
The technique I used was *COMPLETELY* different than any 911 driver
would use (normally) and I accidentally stumbled on it. I had driven mucho
laps in my fairly well prep'd 911 and was waiting for the 968 to build speed in
the first straight (like my 911 did), and I waited, and I waited. Past my
early brake point, past my late brake point, into the initial turn in, and woah
there silver! I hit, no slammed on, the brakes (yes in a turn, Stan). Thought
I'd wipe out the entire north side of the course, but, ABS in the 968 took
over and I kept turning and kept braking until it was time to gas out the
exit. No cones, no turn workers, *fast turn*. I was so amazed that I forgot to
brake for the next turn as well, and so it went. When I pulled in and had
beaten two days worth of times by 3/4s of a second, I figured I had learned
something the others hadn't. So I went out and intentionally late braked and
beat my 1st time!

Bottom line is: I'd own a 968 in a second, it's easy to drive fast and *very*
forgiving. But.... only as a second Porsche -- my blood runs hot 911 red!

On the Oil Pressure Sender Diagnostic: try moving the top back and forth (like
you're trying to unscrew it and screw it back), if it moves at *all*, replace
it. This was one of my most nagging leaks to find. Replace the crush washer
with a new one too....

On Stan's Trip: To bad you're not there this coming weekend, Golden Gate
Region is having a time trial at Sears Point, I bet David B. would even have
given you a ride! Be sure to include on your list of dealers Parts Heaven in
Fremont (I think, or Hayward). They sponsor a lot of P club activity and are
really good guys (are *very* organized, too)...

Th'that's All, Folks!

The problem Steve speaks I believe is the #2 rod failure (2&6) on 928's.

Steve recommends an oil cooler which is always a good idea but the
main reason the rod failure occurs stems from oil-cavitation.  A local
here in the Ann Arbor area Dave Finch (I believe he has some Porsche
factory backed experience) knows exactly where the caviation occurrs,
he has a solution where he'll take your 944 block drill a couple holes
in the block to get to the oil delivery passages where the cavitation
problem occurs.  He never lets anyone see what block prep he actually
does but I am fairly certain that he smooths out the sharp edges in
the oil delivery passages where the cavitation is mainly created.
Then he closes up the access holes.  $1000.00 later and you have a
block that is semi-bullet proof (at least as far as the cavitation is
concerned).

I have no connection with Finch Racing I just followed up on a local with a
1988 944/51 that had the same #2 problem.

the reason the #2 connecting rod supposedly fails most often is poor oil flow in hard cornering. the fix is supposed to be to run an extra 1/4 quart of oil. I've a 2" piece of engine block from an engine that didn't.

Subject: RE: 951 chips and track use


I had toyed with the idea of putting an auxiliarry oil cooler (911
style) in the cavity in front of the psgr tire.  This would
necessitiate relocation
 of the washer bottle/pump assy.

You could laso put a long turbatrol style cooler below the front
aliminum inner bumper.

This would only be needed for extended boost conditions i.e. track
use.  but I feel an addn't oil cooler is needed as oil pressure drops
off on ALL 951s (withor without extra boost) at the track after 15-20
minutes and is especially a problem in 30-45 minute sessions.  I now
have a 911 with the Mazda-style cooler and it works well.

I had also always wanterd to put a 911 oil temp gauge in line (on the
oil - to the cooler line) to get an idea what was happening to my
viscocity.

There suggestions may seem a bit radical, but the 951 oil cooler, if
you lok at the air inlet size and overall cooler size, seems quite
inadequate.  This is demonstrated by the degredation of oil pressure
while coolant temperature remains somewhat constant.

times a winter and intermittently to keep it clean.  It is just Y-ed into the
heater duct.  Its on switch is a timer, so the expectation is clearly that you
will only need it for twenty minutes at a time.  See third bullet above.

My impression is that many? all? 411s and 412s had gas heaters, so if you see
any of them uncrushed, they would also be worth looking under.  Actually as
you are cruising the junkyard, the tip-off is a knob on the dash with a green
lens in it -- same switch was used in Things, buses, and Vanagons.

The gas heater includes a fan to keep air moving through it (see third bullet
above) so if you find one, you might not even need additional blowers to move
air to your windshield and ears.  Also has its own fuel pump, so no installa-
tion hassles with FI vs. low pressure system.  Just needs someplace unpopula-
ted for exhaust: under front left fender in Thing, right at left half-shaft in
Vanagon.

Email me soon if you need measurements or detailed descriptions, as belly pan
of Vanagon is still off for another week or so.

Folks, I have already sprung this on the "known 931-ers" but I am looking
for any further data on intake manifold failures on $931's, before I try
calling PCNA Reno. My 1981 931 has a hole in the intake manifold that appears
to be a flaw in the casting. There are additional cracks, spreading away
from the hole, trying to make their way all round the manifold where it
heads into the number four intake port. Two other 931-ers on this newsgroup
have found the same flaw on their cars, so that makes three of us that
_know_ we have this problem, which is different from saying that we are the
only ones who _have_ this problem. The part has never been stocked by
Stoddards ( $893 price tag might explain that), but it is up to version
number 5, which isn't a good sign. In spite of the cars' age, I hope to
get at least some cooperation from Porsche (I ain't holding my breath, but
I have succeeded with longer shots on older engines from other manufacturers).
So if any of you know of other $931's with a cracked intake manifold -not
the exhaust manifold, since we know there ain't any such thing as a $931
that doesn't have a cracked exhaust manifold ;-), please drop an email
message my way. It will likely be helpful to have as much data as possible
before contacting PCNA. Further, if any of you have any better suggestions
for eliciting cooperation form Porsche, please let me know about that too.
Heck, I'd even appreciate getting access to a toll free number to talk
to them on their dime at this point! The $931 has put me in the poor house :^)

Hi P-Netters,

Thanks for all the feedbacks. I think I will need to get a
fuel pressure gauge to check on the fuel system first.

In response to Mark Sundt, the car does run smoothly once
warmed up. Another thing I forgot to mention was that the
fuel pump relay (in the trunk fuse box) continues to click
while the engine was cranking (but not starting). It seems
like the relay solenoid was being energized and de-energized
continuously. I also see (I took the cap off) the relay is
in the non-energize state when the engine is running. So 
what is the purpose of the relay anyway?

Thanks again for all your insights.

I will post a summary once I got the problem fixed.

I think the early 911 gas heaters did it by leaking gas and lighting the
car on fire.

On a serious note, a friend of mine had a beautiful '66 911 with wood trim
and steering wheel, with the heater mounted in the little compartment
where modern cars carry the A/C blower or whatever.  Can't remember how it
was vented, perhaps like the A/C is now?  It had been disconnected, as
fires were a reality with these devices from what I've been told.

While we're on the subject of heaters, I thought I'd ask if someone knows how

I know the 66 and 67 911/912 had the diagonal model number in the
lower right.  And "PORSCHE" was a one piece badge centered to the left
of the number.  I suppose any 65's out there were like this as well.  In
68 the number moved to the top center of the lid, and "PORSCHE" was a
seven piece badge (individual letters) at the bottom center.  The pre-
68's also had glass headlight covers with a thin polished rim.  The 66
and 67 also had the number designation on the brushed aluminum plate
on the glovebox.  I think 68 was the first year of the cover-less lights
and the fat polished rim.

There was a 73 911T/E/S.  In 74 we got 911/911S/Carrera, the new
bumpers, front hood, reflecter panel, etc.  In 75 the 911 was dropped
(just 911S and Carrera).

In 80 A/C and power windows became standard, if that's any help.
And the 78-on SC had the same fender flares used on the Carrera.

The other way around, and I think 87 was the first year to drop the bold

86 or 87?

Carrera 4's first came out in 89, along with the new bumpers.

So what exactly is a "4K rpm dump off the line"?

I am wondering about this and all the discussion about high rpm's are needed
to really experience a 911 and have been thinking thAT I might be missing some-
thing with mine - I usually shift to the next gear around 3500 - 4500 range -
almost never redline it(redline on my tach is about 6300 rpms)

and have never hit the throttle cutoff.   Anyways, back to the original 
question, I have hit 1st gear at 4000 rpms a couple of times and the tires
didn't spin, but I thought it might be bad for the clutch/gears/etc, is it?

I would be interested in hearing how other people feel about this.

 Another item to consider is the Engine Builders Supply rocker shaft seals.  

 The seals look like rubber flat washers and slip into the two slots on each
 rocker shaft. 

 I tried a set, from the old Garretson's, on the 69T.

 Probably the EBS seals are the same thing.

 BTW, I never figured a way to install the shaft/seals without leaving some 
 seal residue outside the cam housing.

 These seals were a factory racing item, but the part number bounced at 
 the local dealer.  If anyone wants the part number, I'll retrieve it.

Subject: Racing at the Streets of Willow SPrings..

Warning- very long comment- erase now or....read
on. Had to much fun to just talk in passing...

I've started Kart racing to get more seat time for
autocrossing my BMW in H Stock (SCCA) (it's working!), so here goes...

Well, where do I start.  Peter Gaudette (a
friend and upcoming, soon to purchase a kart,PCA/SCCA
racer) and myself took the challenge to race
with the big dogs at a race track that many of
you may have heard of. This was our 1st time
at the Streets of Willow, a smaller track next to Willow
Springs Raceway, which isfrom what I could tell,
located in the middle of the desert outside Los
Angeles.  I was really impressed, especially
after driving it, how really technical the track
was!  I was entered in the 125cc Shifter Sprint
Kart Class (still don't know to much about all
the classes yet, but I'm learning slowly...),  with
the event being put on by the Southern Calif.
Kart Club.  It was really cold on Friday, and
Saturday brought much the same.  I thought
that I would not be going to fast, since the
engine I was using, though fresh, was from an
'84 Kawasaki (read VERY SLOW....), I knew I
would not be able to keep up with ANY of the
fast guys.  Oh well, I've decided to LEARN how
to drive one of the beasts FAST, rather than
start out with a too powerful motor (is there
such a thing in racing .......) & learn nasty
habits that can be covered up by horsepower
(see previous comment...).

  I've really begun to respect the sophistication
of a Sprint Kart- they really are adjustable and
can be dialed in for different tracks!  In some
ways, a Sprint Kart is **much** harder to set
up and drive than my Formula C/F3 Lotus 61(!)
and with the right gears ratios, would shame
an A modified Race car(SCCA SOLO II
Autocross Class) VERY QUICKLY on a short,
tight course (not Nationals, but a 'typical'
Autocross course)!

Anyways, the Kart ran great (last race at
Portland gave me a great setup for fast tracks-
good high speed stability with fair steering
resistance) and the weather began warming up
(thank God- I could only take 10-12 laps at a
time in the moring before my fingers lost
feeling and my hands began to cramp- I love
this racing stuff...!).  During the last practice
session on Saturday, I went off BIG TIME at
turn 4 (very tight, 1st gear corner at the top of
the second hill) after I lost the front wheel!
Yes, the entire front wheel came off as the
previous owner, or should I say driver (thanks
Dave) had put on very thin nuts to hold on the
front wheel (God only knows why).  They
stripped out, thus allowing the wheel to come
off and giving me *NO* front steering!  This
resulted in a Very Scary ride, but I'm thankful it
was at the apex of a very slow corner and not
at a more dangerous, high speed corner like
turn 1, or worst yet, turn 1 at Portland (taken
flat out in 6th gear-if you dare...).  Went back
into the pits and changed out the studs to a
longer version (unfortunately, in my
preparation before this race, I didn't (forgot to)
change out the studs on this wheel-did all the
others though... that will teach me...) and put
*real* nuts on these studs (fortunately, I
brought my spare box of fasteners that I've
begun to collect to make sure I NEVER EVER
get caught without the right hardware at a race
far away from home...as well as I don't always
have to use Larry's stuff).  After this wonderful
exciting adventure into the weeds, we readied
for the race.

We where qualified per our entry date, so I got
a fair place on grid.  I think there was over 25
to 30 karts in this run group, so my 15th place
grid position (I think) was OK.  Well, they
started us in 3 waves- Mine being the second,
so I got a good start.  It took about 2 laps
before the tires really started to stick (or at
least to a level that I felt confortable with!...ha),
so I took it rrrrreal eeeeasy!  After getting into a
good rytheme, since I was still learning the
track, I was able to start passing a few people
(as well as being passed by many others!).
Had a great dice with a guy in a very fast Mac
Mineralli 125cc kart for about 6-10 laps, until I
had brain fade & tried to repass him in a
**STUPID** place, which resulted in a spin.
Fortunately, I remembered to pull the clutch in
(this has been the hardest transition from
racing sports/formual cars, since the clutch-
only used at the start- is controlled from the
steering wheel by your free hand).  Anyway, I
got back **humbly**  underway and just had
fun until about the second to the last lap, when
the >stupid< chain again came off!  Thus, end
of race/fun.... bummer!

Totally took apart the rear sprocket assembly &
robbed all of the split collars we brought on a
spare 'parts' kart.  Put the whole thing back
together with LOTS of Loctitie thread locker
AND parts sealing goop- the chain will NEVER
come off unless it fails- period!  Checked & re-
checked everything to get the kart ready for the
next Race.  Aa I said, friend and fellow
Prosche Club Racer Peter Gaudette came
along to taste the exciting world of Kart racing
(rumor has it that he is seriuosly hooked, since
its much safer and considerably less expensive
than racing Porsches...). He didn't race next
until Sunday afternoon, so we spent more time
tightening/checking everything, again!.

As a side note, had a great Dinner on Saturday
night (after missing church- they changed the
time, or that's what Larry said....) and settled
into a deep sleep after a semi-successful race
that afternoon (I will finish a race someday....).

Sunday brought much colder temps & a few
drizzles, so practice was uneventful.  the kart
setup was great and Peter and I ran the entire
practice session without incident (except for a
broken exhaust pipe- a quick weld job made it
better than new).  Peter was racing in the "IKF
250cc OPEN" class, which meant that he
would race against MUCH faster karts (our kart
was geared to do 90+ mph at the end of the
straight, while these karts are capable of 140-
160 mph!).  I have to give him a lot of credit,
because he was in the fastest class, getting
ready to race in VERY slippery conditions AND
only having about 30 minutes of seat time in
my kart!  A brave racer in deed!

He started towards the back of the pack and
did a great job for about 15 minutes (His race
was to be 1 hour long, so we were going to
have to make a pit stop to for fuel) until he had
a spin at the bottom of turn 3.  I forgot to tell
him that he could push the kart to get it
restarted after a spin (only in a safe place- not
when there were any other karts coming into
the corner), so he sat, alone, for the next 45
minutes!  But until then he was running in the 1
minute-15 second range!  Very fast for
someone who has NEVER raced a kart! (I was
running 1.06's, so he was very smooth & fast
for a real rookie!! Congrates PETER!).

The other guys did well also.  Larry Kurpiewski
and his son Ryan, did well in the 250cc Open
class.  Larry finished 2nd and Ryan place 4th I
believe.  The other guy, Paul something,
crashed pretty badly and wrecked his beautiful
fiberglass nose on his kart (lost his front brakes
going into turn 2 I think), so I don't know where
he placed.

All in all, it was a great race weekend.  I'm
finally beginning to understand this karting stuff
and hope to actuaqlly finish some races next
year!  Unitl then, have a happy holidy season
and remember, it time to wear out the VCR with all the

Finally....this one I can answer.
 
I changed my fan belt recently....without that expensive wrench.

I use the handle-end of a hammer (I have a wooden end) and stick
it between the fan blades at about 11 o'clock position. I have
a 76/911 with a 11 blade fan. The hammer trick just works fine
for me. A brand new wrench cost around $30-40 at Automation or
Performance Products.
 
Installing a bit tricky. You basically need two persons initially
One to hold the belt tight and the other to put on washer and nut.
 
Well, good luck!

Subject: Dellorto carbs


Howdy everyone,
    I am wondering if anyone has experience or thoughts about Dellorto
carburators.  I have only seen them for sale from Imparts Inc., and they
rave about Dellorto's performance and quality.  I guess Dellorto carbs
aren't as fussy as Weber's, and that they are a better choice for daily
drivers.  Any thoughts or comments?
    Also Imparts only offers Dellorto carbs for 356/912 engines.  Does
there exist an easy (cheap) way to use them on 914 2.0 ltr. engines? 
(i.e. Are different manifolds and linkages needed and available?)

               Thanks in advance,

So the light goes on in my head.... I don't know as much about the 
waterpumpers as I do about the "traditional" Porsches, but here's
an idea: on my racing 914, I use a "spin on adapter" (a plate that spins 
on to where the oil filter normally goes giving you 1/2" NPT fittings for oil
in and oil out) to remote an oil cooler, an Accusump, and a full-flow
Canton/MECA 8 micron oil filter.

If you really need more cooling *AND* protection from oil starvation
(assuming that it's a starvation problem, which is more likely, and
not a cavitation-in-flow-due-to-obstruction problem) then such a 
setup would be ideal. Only problem, where in heck do you put that
stuff on a 944...

Subject: Re: Gas heaters for air-cooled w/o heat

Disparaging comments aside, *ALL* air cooled Porsches (including Type 60
and it's kin) had gas heaters available as options. From the '40s up 
until probably even the current C2s. (Anyone know when the gas heater was 
last offered, assuming it's no longer available? Did it go out with the 
SportoMatic?)

Here's the basic deal: a gas line went over from the tank to the
combustion chamber, where a miniature "buzz bomb" jet engine gizmo
provided the heat. A clever design, where exhausting the chamber provided
just enough compression on the incoming charge to fire it. A heat
exchanger then warmed fresh air, which was moved into the fresh air
system by an electric fan.

It plugs into the fresh air system from inside the front trunk, exactly
how depending on the model in question. Getting these suckers to work
right is a challenge -- do it wrong and it blows up. Elmer Fohey says
that back when he was Head Wrench at one of the Houston dealers in
the early '70s, people brought them to that particular shop from all over 
because most service techs were afraid to work on anything that looked
that much like a bomb... These days, he is (as usual with early stuff) the 
only person I know with manuals and tools for them. I do recall someone
advertising in Pano a year or so ago that they serviced the Ebersparcer
units, but don't recall anything else about them...

And wait, there *IS* a guy in Houston with a 911 gas heater that he 
unsuccessfully tried to sell at our last swap meet! With sufficient
lubrication, I may even be able to remember who it was... 8{P

Check out the fusebox in the engine compartment-it's hard to see. Sometimes

  John,
  If i may offer an idea i have recently had concerning boosting heat
flow in cars using an exchanger/valving/ducting combo.
  Since my latest addition (914) has NO heat control valves, i have
decided to try directly connecting the ductwork to the exchangers.
  Elimination of the valves should greatly increase the hot air flow
because they are highly restrictive when open.
  Regulating temperature may require opening windows, but this may
make it warmer due to the evacuation of cockpit air thru the window.
  I had a '73 super beetle that i added the blower kit (from jc whitney)
to the heater system...the results were that the extra air defrosted
the outer skin of the car behind the front fender.  -it sucked.
  
  My '73 914 had really good heat, quick too.  It lasted until the
exhangers rusted to holes and the hoses failed.  In my narrow experience
the 914 with the blower assist was one of the warmest air cooled
rides i have ever had.
 -but i would relish having gas heat...

Good thing you "remembered" quick like... If you are going to put a modified
914 on the track and *NOT* blow it up, you MUST add an Accusump to keep
from burning out your bearings due to no oil. I used to say "or deep sump"
but all of the deep sump kits I've seen, even the cute litle mini-deep sump
that AutoMotion sells, reduce the effectiveness of your oil screen, which
greatly hurts your already hurting oil filtration system.

So, spend that $150 and get an Accusump! While you're at it, add an
external cooler and a *real* oil filter too -- your car will love
you for it.

>So you CAN make a 1.8 into 2.0, sorta? I mean more that just bigger jugs? 
>Or am I mis-interpreting this. 

Yup. 1.7 == 66mm stroke, 90mm bore
     1.8 == 66mm stroke, 93mm bore
     2.0 == 71mm stroke, 94mm bore

1.7 and 1.8 have the same crank. 2.0 has an "offset ground" crank with
a smaller journal for the rod end, but it's off the same casting. We
routinely re-grind "bad" 1.8/1.7 cranks into 2.0 cranks these days.
And the piston bore is different, but up to 2.0 does not require
bigger jug spigots in the side of the case (but does require slightly
different heads between the 1.7 and 1.8, and VERY different 2.0
heads - see below). Otherwise, same case. Same everything else, except rods, 
which are also different on a 2.0.

A 2.0 long block or complete engine is a problem. The 2.0 heads, which
are the best 914 heads available, have 3 intake manifold studs. The 
1.7 and 1.8, and VW 2.0, all have 4 studs. So, with a 2.0, you would
have to get a new induction system. 

Otherwise, the sheetmetal is the same, the motor just bolts up and
works. Using stock parts, no less.

Oh, the "sender where the sun don't shine!"

It's in front of the CIS ducting and it's a pressure switch.  The 
kind of can shaped thangy on the right cam tower line is the pressure
gauge sender (on an '80 sc).

I'm told that it's possible get to the sender without lowering the 
engine, but I haven't managed it myself.

If you loosen the front transmission mounts, support the engine with
a floor jack, disconnect one oil line (the one with the 30mm and 36mm
fittings, not the soft one to the tank), remove the rear cross brace
that supports the engine, watch for whatever else I've forgotten, 
the engine may be lowered about 9"-12".  This will allow you to 
(sort of) get your head behind the CIS ducting and see the sender.

It could probably be done "by brail," but this would make it hard
to clean the area (and if the sender is leaking the area **will**
need cleaning).  I'd get in there with some brake-clean before 
removing the old sender.  Wear goggles for this part.

Enjoy!

I believe the 3.0 goes into a 901 without problems.  I think you need 
a different flywheel and/or clutch, but there should be no other problems.

As far as the long post goes, don't worry about it.  That's what this
forum is for (sure hope Stan agrees with me ;-)).

As I mentioned earlier, this project sounds like stone soup.  I think
it will cost you a fortune.  I strongly recommend that you write down
**everything** you can think of that the car needs, put prices on 
it all, and the add at least 50% (doubling would be safer) and assume
that you will spend twice than that amount.

And then you will only underestimate the cost by a factor of two!

The 911 is a wonderful car, but like some women (and I suppose men)
it is unforgiving of neglect and will come up with **many** ways 
to torment you if neglected. 

Ways that you could never imagine in your wildest dreams.

This car sounds very, very, neglected.

Subject: 951 rod failures and solution

All 2.5 liter 944 series blocks cast before mid-88 have a design flaw.  If  
you get any cavitation of the oil pump (which is difficult to avoid under  
track conditions and hard cornering) air collects in a high spot in the  
main oil gallery, and if pressure decreases for any reason, air is fed to  
the #2 rod bearing.  If it happens under the right conditions, you can get  
away with grinding the crank and rebuilding the motor.  If it happens at  
6400 rpm, you throw a piece of the rod through the block and/or pan and  
spout flaming oil out the back of the car.

If it sounds like I'm familiar with the problem and the results, I am, and  
I have two holed 944 blocks sitting on the floor at the back of the race  
shop to prove it.  I've tried a number of fixes, including overfilling the  
oil slightly, installing an Accusump, using a large oil cooler, etc, but  
none of these are foolproof.  Since modifying the block is illegal in  
SCCA's ITS class, where we raced the 944, we changed the rod bearings  
after every 10 hours of track time, and prayed.

Fortunately, there are two solutions.  One is to build an engine using a  
block cast after mid-88.  The other is to bleed the air away from the high  
spot.  Not to insult Dave Finch, but $1000 seems a little high.  If you  
plan to track your car and want to avoid the problem, Jon Milledge  
Engineering (at 617 834-3932) will fix this problem and make a couple  
other desireable mods for about half that.  They've been doing it since  
1987 for race engines, and I believe Dave Finch learned about the fix from  
Jon.

While I'm recommending Jon Milledge, I should mention that he has a  
variety of parts and kits which will allow you to make from 275 hp (~$300)  
to 550 hp (~$30,000) from a 951.  I'm biased since he builds our race  
engines, but I think he is immensely knowledgeable on all engines and  
especially on the 944 Turbos.

Subject: 951 belt replacement (mechanical tensioner)

First of all thanks to anybody that responded to my previous posting regarding
the replacement of the camshaft belt in 951s with the mechanical belt
tensioner. 
The manual indicates that in order to do this the belt tensioner has to be
removed. As some of you suggested this is a pain in the neck. 
Well, as was able to replace the belt without removing the tensioner. The
method that I am describing may not apply to your car.
It is very dependent on the exact design of the tensioner. The one
showed in the manuals looks slightly different than mine. 
The procedure is based on moving the tensioner forwards and sliding the
belt behind it. Here is how to do it:

1. Loosen nut A (left) and bolt B (right) from tensioner
2. Remove bolt B completely
3. Unscrew nut A all the way, but do not remove it
4. Slide out belt from camshaft
5. Slide out belt from crankshaft (fold belt slightly to get it out)
6. Use large braker bar to reduce the camshaft belt tension. Fit it to the
   belt tensioning roller and turn counterclockwise. It should move the
   tensioner rightwards releasing the tension. Have somebody to hold it there.
   Be careful if you try to support it with tools. If the bar snaps the time 
   your fingers are between the roller and the water pump, there is a good
   chance that you will lose some of them. The spring that holds the tensioner
   is very powerful. There is also a special braker bar (tool 9200) that
   can push back the tensioner without involving the bolt in the tensioning
   roller.
8. Using a large screwdriver pry out mechanical tensioner from engine until a 
   13mm hex key fits between engine and tensioner
9. Fold (I know it is not a good idea) the upper part of camshaft belt and 
   pass it between toothed camshaft belt roller and the engine 
   (There should be enough space to do it).
   There is nut behind the toothed roller which makes this job kind of
   difficult, but if you have an assistant it should not take a lot of time.

I created a postcript file that has some schematics of this method. I can
mail it if you are interested. Send me email.

Torque, schmork.  You get an 8 and a 5 mm hex key, cut the short legs

This set-up sounds great for oil cooling. But, this sounds like a bit
much(I mean way over my budget) for a street driven car that needs an
upgrade from stock. Can you suggest an oil cooling upgrade that is not
quite as pricey that is still good enough for an occsional autox and

Stan,
Pardon me for buttin' in but, I've been through all the questions you're
asking now. Yes, you can make a 2.0l from a 1.7 or 1.8 engine. I had a
parts car that came with an engine built like this. One thing to keep in
mind is that the 1.7 & 1.8 use a 66mm stroke at the crank. Whereas the
2.0 uses a 71mm stroke. But, if you use 95mm pistons with the 66m crank
you come up with a 2.0l. I found no difference with either cooling
housing but I did have to buy new fan bolts because the two liter fan
seemed to be just a bit thicker than the one for the smaller sizes. Now
the intake manifolds were the same but depending on what year car you
have should dictate which exhaust manifold you use. The manifolds for
the 2.0 are slightly bigger, have a different bend out the back of the
car and have different flanges depending on year. Regarding sheet metal,
this item is completely different on a 2.0 than a 1.7 or 1.8. But if you
use heads from a 1.7 or 1.8 you will be able to use sheet metal from
same. But, if you have two liter heads you need two liter sheetmetal.
The reason is because the sparkplugs are at a different angle on the 2.0
and won't line up with the sparkplug holes in the 1.7, 1.8 sheetmetal.

Having gone through piecing together a two liter from various 1.7, 1.8,
and 2.0 parts, I think I can recommend with a fair amount of confidence
that if you can find a complete 2.0l to rebuild, do so! You'll have less
headache than what I've had to go through. Be forewarned though, it will
cost a bit more than doing a 1.7 or 1.8 build-up. Hope this info helps
you out. If you have any more questions or want to hear any more do and ###
don't horror stories just ask.

Just as an FYI, and for what it's worth.  Porsche does NOT recommend

I don't know about the global availability of the 968CS, but here in the

difference with this 968 is that all the electric junk has been stripped
out, no rear seats plus racing seats (Recaro I think) saving 100kg. It also
has massive 17 inch alloys, with low profile Yokohamas, lower and stiffer
suspension tuned for handling. The engine is standard 968. This car was car of
the year 1993 in all the UK car magazines. It is reported to have exceptional
handling and is meant to be massive fun. I saw the 968CS in action at Silverstone,
and was impressed. A serious sports car, lacking the grunt of a 911 IMHO.
I would love to have one as a second Porsche, but would never trade my 911
for it.

has 240 hp and weighs in at 2910lb(dry) and the test car was 3240lb.  The car
was picked a winner over the new BMW M3 and AudiS2 mainly because of quick
handling and great engine.

Also of interest I found a article on the 968 Turbo S in the June issue of
EXCELLENCE magazine.  A few specs were 305hp, 0-60 times of under 5 sec., and
top speed of 174.  The car weighed in at 2867lb.(empty, wet).  18 inch wheels
and tires.  Price: 175000DM in Germany.  At the time of the article they were
planning on making about 40 or so with the original plans of being 50 to 100.
 
Sounds like a real race car to me.

Hope someone finds this interesting.

Stan,

This isn't the first time you've talked about an Accusump. I think I
understand what its purpose is but am not sure. Doesn't it store a
specified amount of oil that gets pumped into the motor when oil pres-
sure drops below xx psi? For that  $150 expenditure, do you get a
hardware/installation kit too? What do you mean by a *real* oil filter?
I thought I was doing good getting my filters from Porsche.

this is an interesting revelation, I thought 1.7/1.8 cranks were
completely different from the 2.0l. This is good info to know 'cause I
thought my spare 1.7 short block would have to be relegated to boat
anchor use. On a different note, Do you have any experiences with the
welded stroker cranks I see advertised in the VW rags? They supposedly
start off with original VW units and weld up material so they can        rods,
I believe??? offset grind them into stroker units.

Being a believer in the gospel according to Stan, it saddens my heart to
have to disagree with you on these last two points. While you're the
only person to date that has been able to differentiate the Porsche 2.0l
heads(3 stud) from the VW 2.0l heads(4 studs) I didn't have to purchase
new intake manifolds to accomodate the Porsche heads. The castings had
hole patterns for both stud configurations. And the manifolds from the
VW heads could be drilled for the center stud to fit the Porsche heads.
At least it seems this way at first glance. If there is a reason why
this shouldn't be done, I'll be humble and will happily stand corrected.
Now with regard to the sheetmetal, I had to purchase new sheetmetal to
use the Porsche 2.0l heads. The difference was that the 1.7/1.8 sheet-
metal had the sparkplug holes toward the top of the motor, while the
2.0l sheetmetal had the holes angled more towards the side of the
motor. There was enough of a difference that you couldn't get a wrench
on the plug to tighten them down w/ the wrong sheetmetal. Unfortunately,
it seems that 2.0l Porsche sheetmetal is made from unobtanium and had to
be special ordered from:  None left in Weissach Ltd.

Man, did they charge me through the nose for these items! I should have

to my head while he made me pay.

Subject: Re: 951 and 


Rod stresses are a function of power, not boost.  You want power, you
stress rods.  Doesn't matter much whether it comes from boost or
displacement or any other source.

Basic law of thermodynamics:  mix a given amount of oxegen with an appropriate
amount of fuel and you get a precicely definable amount of energy.
Force times a distance equals work which is energy minus losses due to
friction/inefficency.  Power is work per unit time.

Increase either the volume of oxegen per stroke (by boost, efficent
breathing or displacement) OR the number of explosions per time period
(RPMS) OR the efficency of energy utilization (rod length and geometry
or even engine design) to increase power.  Given we have a fixed rod
geometry and therefore relatively fixed efficency of energy utilization
we have four ways to increase power:

1) Increase RPMs
2) Increase oxegen/fuel density
3) Increase efficiency of combustion via mixture, and spark timing
4) Increase displacement
5) decrease losses (due to exhausting gasses and drivetrain/accessory takeoff)

Do 1) 
by increasing breathng capacity and removing the rev limiter - buyer beware!

Do 2) by 

a) optimizing breathing - opening ports, minimizing restriction,
optimizing cam timing and geometry (note how well this works on the
968!, 238 vs 208 HP essentailly by varying cam timing and ignition)

b) providing more boost  - here you can redesign the system or just
turn up the volume.  Boost can be via turbocharging or supercharging
which effects 4).  Both generaste masses of heat which must be
dissipated somewhere - hopefully before entering the combusition
chamber.  This is a function of the KLR , cycling valve and any inline
restrictions

c) Providing intercooling - which increases density at constant boost
pressure.

3) This has mainly to do with computer control - i.e. DME chips

4) and 5) I'll leave up to your imagination.

Chips can effect 1) and 3) and, to a lesser extent 2).  Maximum
intercooling is always good as it provides an escape for heat and
increases combustion efficiency.

Bottom line: all power flows through the rod bearings.  Keep your oil
cool (viscosity constant) and provide plenty of flow to maximize the
happiness of the bearings.

Beware!  This sounds like a good way to break a $200 fan.

Some alternators (like on Lois's '81 'sc) have a nice allen socket
in the end of the shaft.  On these a 6mm (5mm?) allen and a 24mm box

Oh yeah, the fan is mounted on the alternator shaft, in case this was

Hi Brent,

   I have a DellOrto on my Rx7, and I would have to say that I am less
than thrilled about it in general. It is what I would call a "fair weather
carb" - if the temperature and humidity are right, its GREAT!!!, but if
they aren't, it kind of sucks. I have to fiddle the idle mix any time
the air temperature changes 10 degF, and when it's 33 degF out, the
intake manifold ices up fiercely. This is a 48DHLA. The other thing about
it is it really needs a rebuild about once a year, which is a bit more
often than I really want to have to do that. Every 3 years, I could deal
with.

Not to disagree, exactly, with our Fearless Leader, but . . .
Turning a 1.8 into a 2.0 is not quite a bolt-on procedure.  We had this discus-
sion a couple of years back--there's some additional machining needed to
make the 2.0 cylinders fit correctly on the 1.8L case/crank/etc.  I seem to

I don't remember where the power is on a '73t (only drove one and it 
was the first 911 I tested when I started looking).  Since it is a 
relatively low powered engine, I suspect the power band is fairly 
wide and you may make more low end that would an 's, but here I'm 
just guessing.  However, I think you will still get the power at 
the high end.

My '80 911sc also has a fairly wide power band, but doesn't really
start to move 'til 3500-4000 rpm.  It pulls hard to at least 6k from
there.

>and have never hit the throttle cutoff.   

Then how do you know the bloody thing works?   ;-)

>Anyways, back to the original 
>question, I have hit 1st gear at 4000 rpms a couple of times and the tires

Driving the car is bad for it.  Of course, so is not driving it, so...

Seriously, the 911 is a fairly robust car.  You have a 915 transmission
with the lowest power engine ever sold with that transmission, so I 
suspect your gears are safe.  Clutch is also robust (some people
call this "overdesigned").

>I would be interested in hearing how other people feel about this.

To drive a 911 at the edge of the envelope, you *must* transfer all
possible weight to the rear wheels.  To do this, you need all 
available torque.

I can hear Hank (auto-x instructor) yelling "stand on it" (meaning
throttle)...

When I autocross I will occasionally hit the rev limiter (around 7k
rpm, the spec is 6800 +/- 200), but it's pretty rare.  I do, however,
routinly hit the redline (6300 rpm).  

My car has 147k (no rebuild) miles on it.  Compression is high and 
even.  Oil consumption is about 3000 miles/qt.  Compression and oil 
consumption have not changed in the 45k miles I've driven the car.
This is a 3.0 liter engine, which is probably the most robust of all 
911 engines.  Transmission is due for a rebuild, but it's syncros
not gears that are worn.  Clutch is supposedly about 6 years old
with unknown (though > 45k) mileage.

So to finally answer your question, yes, the car performs best 
when driven hard, both in terms of handling and acceleration.

If you want to discover what your car will really do, go to an 
autocross.  They're cheap, not particularly hard on the car (be
sure the engine is completly warmed up before you run), lots
of fun, and about the only safe place to **really** drive hard.

I had my "new" car shipped from Germany.  Of course you have to go to a 
Porsche dealer to get this setup.  I estimated my cost savings to be about the
cost of my plane ticket (roundtrip from S.F.).  So based on your kind of price
difference, I suspect that your looking at a non-US spec car.  I highly 
recommend against the "gray" car.  My car was ordered to California spec. and 
I still got all kinds of problems about getting my car registered here.  
People don't know about cars being shipped to the US.  I always had to talk to 
more than 1 person at each stage to try to find a person that knows about 
getting US cars registered to get the answer that I wanted.
The Porsche company does not necessary make this an "easy and painless" 
transaction for the new buyer. I had to spend countless time and $ calling the
Porsche office in Reno about this setup plus afterwards too!

I've even had to reschedule my dates because of various problems (to be fair,
it was a paint-to-sample so the normal time is to be extended).  But then 
again, the dealer I was working with (hint: Oakland dealer) did not have 
enough experience to know what to do next and they "washed their hands" once I
left for Germany.  The Porsche office in Reno did not exactly provide enough 
information to make me confortable.  I STILL HAD TROUBLE WITH THE OFFICE IN 
RENO AFTER I GOT BACK FROM GERMANY!

In summary, it was quite an experience and in a way I'm glad I did it--but you
can bet that the next time--I'm buying in USA to avoid the hassle and worries.
If your going to be going to Germany anyway then it might be worthwhile to get 
a Mercedes instead.  I understand Mercedes really do a good and complete job 
for you.

Subject: Very Close 911 Purchase


Hello fellow porsche netters,

After 3 months of patient search, I think I may have found the car.  I
would like to get a quick opinion from those out in netland with regards
to this car.

For 3 months, I have been looking at 78-83 911 SC's with original 
equipment.  (No conversions, original paint, original engine, etc.)
However, this last week, I found an 83 SC which has a turbo body
conversion and for some reason (just as Stan Hanks does) I kinda like
the turbo body.  This car has 70k miles, original SC engine with 
carrera chain tensioners, 3 piece BBS wheels, and a steel conversion
on the rear fenders to give the turbo look.  Asking price is $15k

My question is how does the market perceive turbo look 8911s (911s) which
were not converted by the factory?  The car is not a factory furbo look
which means that the original body was altered and the car repainted
(though in its original color)  If in several years, I decided to sell
the car, will I have a hard time finding a buyer and will I (the car) 
hold its value as well as one with original equipment?

Should I stick with my original plans to find a 78-83 SC with original
equipment 9which I believe will hold its value better or should I try
this car with the modifications?  In general, the car runs pretty well,
but the owner has put on BBS wheels, momo steering wheel, and momo shift
knob in addition to the rear turbo fenders.  Is $15k reasonable?  too high?

In my search, I have at times come across 78-83 SC's for sale in the $10 -
$12k range.  Perhaps, I should continue my original search?

I would appreciate any input.  Please e-mail me direct at:

John:  I just read in "Outdoorsman" magazine of a new turnkey
mailorder kit from S&G Sporting Goods that provides excellent heating
for all cars.   It's a woodburning stove that exhausts out the passenger
window.  The kit inlcludes the new passenger window with the chimney
ductwork attached, and adapters for the base of the stove to bolt into
the existing passenger seat mountings on most cars (911s and 914s
included!)  The really nice thing about this kit is that it can be
installed without drilling or any modifications to the car that can't
be easily undone (really just remove the passenger seat and window,
which are easily replaced in the summer!).

I installed one last week and the only problem was severe burns on the
elbows causes by rubbing against the stove while shifting, but I
installed a few "shuttle tiles" in those areas and the problem was
solved.

What's really great about this system is you can drive with the
windows down - even with the top off!  (In fact, you sort of have to).

I have read quite a bit about, but have little experience working on Porsches.
I currently only work on my friend's '73 914 (I have more experience with late
60's Ford/Chevy - but I am converting..:^).

I am considering buying a '69 911T.  Any tips for this model year?
The car is as such:
	original paint (orange!) w/some primer -- very little rust
	interior ok
	engine (2.0) sounds like it has good compression (didn't do compression
	test)
	S aluminum wheels
	new heat x-changer
	Weber carbs
	stainless steel exhaust & brake lines
	shifter feels ok (with car off)

Here is the clincher - it has bad brakes (the owner claims the calipers are
forzen) and therefore I could not take a test drive.  He is asking $3900 which
is below book value, but I feel still too high for the risk of who knows what
else could be wrong.  Not wanting to pass up this deal, I am prepared to offer
$2500 for the car as is.

I figured (from magazines) that I could get new pads ($50), m.c. rebuild kit
($35) & caliper rebuild kits ($30) for relatively cheap to basically give me
new brakes, but without dirving it is there a way to easily tell major $$
repairs?

electric used on the previous dual webers (no fuel injection when I got it).
I also got the budget upgrades- bursch header, 009 distributor. This setup 
worked well, it was well behaved on the street, got tolerable mileage (~26 mpg 
hiway), but had a significant power reserve. When stepped on, it would 
accelerate quite quickly, and I could hear it breathe- about 2 or 3 times as 
loud. The manifolds were tapped for an equalization line, which runs between 
both manifolds to equalize the intake pressure. I simply blocked these ports 
(so no vacuum leaked) because I periodically sychronized the carbs to 
minimize the pressure difference. 
I sold it to get my 911, by the way.
For those near Va. Beach, the guy was Ziggy Krawiel, and he had a one car 
garage filled (completely) to about 7 feet with miscellaneous porsche parts and
I'll bet it still is.

I was under the impression that the spark plugs in the 2.0 head go in at
a different angle/position than the 1.7/1.8 heads.  This would make it
difficult(if not impossible) to use engine sheet metal from a 1.7 because
the spark plug access holes would not line up properly.
I could be wrong, but.....

Dellorto is an OK carb, but there are two significant problems: (1) as
John Lupien mentioned, they're not really very "stable" and need a lot
more attention than Webers, and(2) there is only one *real* source of
parts in the US -- CB Performance in sunny Southern Cal. Contrast with
Weber, for which I can get parts in most major cities in the US, and
certainly can bum parts at any SCCA racing event in the country....

Dell's are "hot" in the VW world, or were a few years ago. Mainly due to
being *cheaper* than Webers, and because frankly you couldn't get them 
as big as Webers. Lots of *STOOOPID* people tried to put 48 IDAs on
more-or-less stock 1600cc engines; biggest Dell is 45, which (duh!)
works a lot better...

If you're bound and determined to use Dells, CB has the 914 kit. Which
is about as different from the 356 kit as the 356 engine is from
the 914 engine....

Yup, all true -- you get to worry about deck height and cylinder bore
fitment, and  (as I'd completely forgotten!) the sheet metal is
different due to the heads being of radically different design.
And yes, the VW 2.0 head is *VERY* different -- different valve angle,
different porting, different plug angle, and of course, the 4 bolt
manifold flange instead of the 914 2.0 3 bolt flange...

But the case *IS* the same -- honest! We've built many a 2.0 on
a "W" case, because W cases are "free" and GA cases are hard to find...
Just use stock 2.0 "guts" and heads and sheetmetal, and hey, it's
a 2.0...

Making a 2.0 or bigger out of a 1.7 or 1.8 using the original heads
is going to be more work, mainly on the heads. And that's where the
deck height gets important -- you have smaller cc volume in the 
head, you have valve clearance problems, and you have to balance all 
this with the correct deck height to not smack a valve into the poston but
still make decent compression... If you decide to do this, shoot me a private
note and I'll disgorge the appropriate maths...

Subject: Techron

Dear P-netters:

I just purchased a copy of Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook. On page
239, he mentions a Porsche Tech Bulletin regarding the addition of Techron 
to clean up fouled up fuel injection system.

His writing is ambiguos, ".. Porsche recommended a dose of 20 oz of Techron
be added to the gas tank with a fill-up. Then it said that the car should be 
driven until the tank is half-empty and then refilled. Porsche recommended
repeating the procedure two or three additional times."

What procedure is he referring to? Is it the addition of Techron or running the
car until the tank is half-empty and refilling?

Can someone that has seen this Tech Bulleting shed some light on the subject.

Also, I measured the resistance on the spark plug wires the other day. They
all seem to be ~ 4K ohms +/- 200 ohms. Is this a typical reading? 

As usual, thanks in advance!

  I'm very new here, but I see other older (70's and early '80s) Porsche

I think you already know the answer to this question, there is no way
to be sure. But since you don't seem very confident you are *strongly*
recommended to have this car checked out by a Porsche specialist
before you buy. 

Also, in your summary of costs involved in fixing this unknown brake
problem, you have not figured in costs possibly the calipers are so
corroded that they must be replaced. Also, if severe corrosion has
already set in, you will be replacing the solid metal brake lines
everywhere, not exactly a fun "first job" on a newly purchased early
911. 

Without driving, the transmission might be a disaster waiting for it's
next victem. Not to make it all sound bad however, it's a good
learning experience, and I'd buy the thing for $2500 too! :)

independent garages in the area (Devon, West Chester etc), plus 2 dealers
(YBH and Rosemont), perhaps you could hire a good person to check the car
out for you or have it towed to one of the garages - spend a few $ now to

Subject: 911 SC with bod-mods


OK, finally, and 'opinion' question about which I am opinionated enough
to throw my two bits in (whether to buy the SC with the 'turbo look'
body or keep looking for a stock one):

1) Correctly me if I'm wrong, p-netters, but the 'Turbo Look' body is more
than just rear-fenders for an SC - front fenders, correct tail, proper wheel
widths and, just as important, wheel spacing all play a part.  A conversion
that isn't done right is spottable from a mile away, even if the spotter
can't tell exactly what's wrong with it.

2) You were wisely looking for a car with original paint: why?  Probably
because that way you can tell whether anything has happended to the body or
not.  Why was this car converted?  Was it wrecked first?  Conversions aren't
cheap, so either the converter really wanted a turbo look bad, or had to
redo large portions of the body anyway...

3) You obviously care about resale value (which is a whole other issue
of which many people on this list could comment on) so take note: IMHO,
a modified car can never be worth as much as a stock one - how many
modified body, repainted three times, non-orginal motor 911s are for sale
in your area today?  How many original paint, original engine?  With
that in mind, my point is not to pay a premium for a modified car over
a stock one, which it sounds like you might be considering.

None of this means no one should buy or own a modified 911, it just means
consider what your paying, what you want to do with it, and how much 
money (depreciation) you expect your 'x-years' of ownership to cost.
The 911 SC's are great cars, and if you pick the right one, it can be
fun, reliable, and not hurt your wallet too bad.  Of course, a flared,
3.0 litre 250+hp targa with huge wheels for $6000 would be a darn fine
grocery-getter...

Porschephiles,

I was reading my Moss Motors (a British car parts place in CA) Newspaper
last night and their lead story was about potential legislation that would
ban the production of spare parts for cars older than the 1980.  The
concept is an extension of the idea of buying old clunkers to get their
pollution off the road - if you cannot get spare parts, the cars will come
off the road.  

Given that Moss Motors is in the business of only selling parts for cars
older than 1980 (MGs, TRs, Healeys, Jags) are they paranoid?  Has anyone
else out there heard the same story?  Is this only a Califorina thing?

I assume you mean the oil level light, installed on late but not early
1987 944 series cars, rather than the annunciator light indicating low
oil pressure (among other things). Assuming that is the case, and the
issue is high oil usage under  harder driving conditions but not under
mild driving conditions, my 1987 944S exhibits similar symptoms. My
high oil usage is under track conditions, where I can go through 1/2
to 1 Qt of oil in 20 min. or so of extremely hard driving. Under normal
street driving (including trips) my car uses little or no oil. I have
spoken to other 944S drivers who have similar symptoms, as well as
others who do not have the symptoms. One of the other 944S drivers claimed
that there was a defect in the piston rings, and that he got PCNA
to pick up a replacement under warranty (several years ago). Others
also alluded to a design or manufacturing defect, but had not done
anything about it.

Your situation is somewhat different in that your car is a turbo
(anyone know if they use the same rings? my fische is at home).
Also, your high oil usage happens under less strenuous conditions than
mine and the others I know of. In any case, the general symptoms are
close enough that I would like to hear about whatever you learn.

Well here it goes
Technical Bulletin	#8510		12/06/85
Subject: Cleaning of Fuel Injectors

Partially restricted fuel injectors can be cleaned through the following 
procedure and materials.
1-Fill up fuel tank.
2-Pour 20 oz of "Techron" into fuel tank.
3-The car should be driven until the fuel tank is half empty.
4-Refill the fuel tank.
5-This procedure, as outlined from point 1 to 4 should then be repeated 2 
additional times.
6-To keep injectors clean, we recommend adding 20 ounces of Techron after 
5 fuel tank refills. However, never more than 20 ounces per 3,000 miles.

Hope this helps

  My '86 951 will consume some oil, Especially at high speeds.  I
believe that this is considered normal.  I believe that Porsche's
response is about a quart every (don't quote me) 1.5Kmi is ok!!
Ridiculous by Honda standards, however I believe that Porsche does
design into the engine some oil consumption to compensate for the
dramatic load/power that their engines produce (better oil than metal).
  Keep a CLOSE eye on oil consumption, every other time you get gas do
yourself a favor and just check the oil level, it's not the big a deal.

Ross,

You have to let us know:
	dino or synthetic oil ?
	what weight ?
	qts/1000 miles ?
	what's the mileage on your car ?

I have a similar car to yours. Factory specs are up to 1 liter/1000 km or 
roughly 1.1 qt/ 600 miles. Especially in summer and if you use the A/C in city 
stop and go traffic, oil temperatures get really hot. You will also see a higher

 I took "Tourist delivery" in 1986 on my 951.  I had no problems
 whatsoever.  The dealer was great.  I got to order what I
 wanted.  Picked the car up at the factory after going on the
 tour (they give you lunch), then they go over the car with you
 and release you on the Autobahn :-)  They also took care of
 getting insurance for you (obviously you need to pay for this). 
 When you finish your trip you drop the car off at the factory
 (or one of several other locations) at that time they
 reinstalled the catalitic converter then shipped it back to the
 US.  When it arrived here I picked it up at the dealer and
 registered it - no problems.  If and when I buy another new one
 I'll definitly do Euro delivery again.  Again this was 1986 and
 you saved 10% on the car price.  Anyone have any real recent
 experience?

Here's some more info on my car.

Right now I have Valvoline 20-50 Turbo oil in my car.
(I plan to go to Mobil 1 synthetic at the next change.)
So far, I have had to add 3 quarts of oil over about
4000 miles.  I've had one oil change in that interval.
(That may account for part of the 3 quarts.)
My car has just over 73,000 miles on it.

RE: purchase of 83SC with turbo flares...

I would not pay a premium for the purchase.  Turbo flares do not
make the car a "turbo look" 911.  Real turbo look cars have turbo
suspension and brakes...a big difference. 

The value of the car with the flares will be directly proportional
to the quality of the work.  If you have little experience with
bodywork, have someone look at it who does have the experience.
This kind of job can look superficially good, while being a
nightmare underneath.

15K does not sound too bad for a real nice 83 car with not high
mileage.  But, if you can go up even a couple of thousand, you might
be able to find an 84 carrera...

   2) You were wisely looking for a car with original paint: why?  Probably
   because that way you can tell whether anything has happended to the body or
   not.  Why was this car converted?  Was it wrecked first?  Conversions aren't
   cheap, so either the converter really wanted a turbo look bad, or had to
   redo large portions of the body anyway...

This is a good point. Although I think there will always be a market
for a tastefully done turbo-look conversion, I have seen many cars
which converted only after they've been through hell, rolled, burned,
stripped, fire-bombed, machine-gunned, flooded etc. For whatever reason
body shops seem to think, "Hey, I'm starting out with basically a hunk
of burned sheetmetal which has a Porsche VIN number attached to it,
why not make it into a slant nose conversion, it'll cost the same in
parts but I can sell it for $30,000 instead of $12,000 when it's done."
Hence the inordinate number of late-model non-factory metallic purple 
Porsche slantnoses running around. I don't think this is the case with
the original poster's potential purchase however.

What Bruce means is this: let your tank get down to about 1/2 full, 
then go to a gas station (sorry, you structured-programming folks), 
dump in the Techron, and fill the tank.  The idea is to swirl the 
Techron around real good, for a good mix.

Also, you shouldn't do this more than 2 or 3 times between oil changes, 
as the Techron bottle advises.

Ross, which light comes on - pressure or level?  The level light is 
rather finicky, and likes the level high.  You need to determine what 
the actual problem is that the light reports, and identify why it's 
happening - internal leaks (rings, valve guide, etc.), or external 
leaks (gaskets, oil filter).

It could be that all is normal; the oil level was near the light's 
trigger point at the start of your trip...

I interpret it as:
1. Start with an empty tank.
2. Pour in 20oz of Techron AT GAS STATION JUST BEFORE FILL UP!
3. Fillup gas tank (this mixes solution well)
4. Drive until tank is half empty - refill with gasoline only

Steps 1-4 are the "procedure" he recommends repeating.

In my January 1994 Automobile, FOB Briefing section on pg 16, was the

     "Even Porsche thinks its replacement parts are too expensive.  So its

I was hunting through the local auto trader last night for a feloow netter
hunting for a trashed 944.  I ended up running across at least two ads for
older (early 70's) 911's at what seemed to be ridiculously low prices.  One of
the was a 911E for $5k and the other was a non 'S' that apparently had a lot of
'S' parts thrown into it for $3600.  
I have no idea what shape these cars are in mechanically, but the photos in the
ads seemed okay =8^).  Personally, I'm looking for something post '80, but
given the huge following for older models on this group, I thought some of you
might be interested.  If you are, I can post the text of the ads, and perhaps
be persuaded to help take a look.  One of them is in the Portland OR area,
while the other is in Salem (which I would be less inclined to inspect....)

P.S.  There were also a few 914's in the $2k range.......

Paul is right about his experience on his "Tourist delivery for his 1986, 
because I heard the same thing for about the same era.  However, very late 
into 1980's and certainly by 1990 when I did it, the EPA was getting very 
strict at that time, USA did NOT allow any kind of "grey" market cars to come 
into the states--at least not as easy as it use to be.

I did get the factory tour and the lunch.  I know that my problem was with the 
dealer who didn't have any previous experience about doing the "Tourist 
delivery" and when they got tired of my questions and inquires, they just 
passed me onto PCNA at Reno.  It was always hard to get hold of the guy at 
Reno who knew about the "Tourist delivery" and I always got the hint that he 
thinks I should be contacting the dealer about my car and not bother Reno.  
But then again, it was always my dime that was calling him.  No 800 phone 
number for that type of service and I made numerous ($) calls both before the 
pickup and after the shipment.

As Paul said, I think the "Tourist delivery" could've been better for me if I 
had gotten the "Porsche bug" at a different time and different place.

P.S. They don't reinstall the catalitic converter back on when the car is 
coming back to the states.  It stays on during the time in Europe--you have to 
ensure that you put in the correct gas.  I didn't have any trouble locating 
the correct fuel, the unleaded fuel seems to be growing more popular at that 
time.  However, they did provide brochure/map about where you could get the 
correct fuel.

Then, before he could get them mounted and after aggressive bitching to
Mazda and Yoko because his OEM Yoko's wore out too soon, they bought
him some new AVS Intermediates.

(amazing, but true.  There was an alignment problem which the dealer
 knew about but forgot to deal with--simply rotating the tires resulting
 in the other two getting trashed as well).

Anyway, he'll sell the Dunlops for 525.00 OBO or the Yoko's with

Well, not only should you do a compression test, but if you've been watching
porschephiles, you've seen a lot of discussion about a leakdown test. This
will really give you a good indication of the health of the motor. Remember,
911 motors are EXPENSIVE ($6000-$8000) to CORRECTLY rebuild.

this is interesting...I'm not sure but the stainless steel brake lines would

911T's are sllloooooooowwwww. Does the car have any S trim options? Other

Hmm, perhaps you've been watching old F1 tapes with Integras
turning into MP4/6s driven by some Austrian whose helmet sticks up
above the airbox (I think they chose him as Senna wanted a
royalty).  Shouldn't you be studying your accounting? (Inside
joke.)

When I'm not driving my 911 or my GTI I'm probably in my wife's
Civic 4 door. That's right the one with the 200 MFLOP fuel
injection and VTEC (straight off the RA121E I'm sure).

Torque?  Not.  You want power?  Method: Depress right pedal to
maximum travel. Wait for 2nd gear to engage.  Wait for engine
speed to reach 6000 RPM (by golly, it has a tachometer, right next
to the "trunk ajar" light).  If you remember the purpose of the
exercise following the delay and despite the ambient mechanical
noise, you may notice some increase in acceleration.  I would
imagine the latest Prelude 190 HP (peak music power) world-beater
is about the same.

In don't think the owner's manual says much about oil consumption
during sustained high-speed operation (it DOES recommend a spark
plug for such conditions - the same as the stock plug in Canadian
models. Go figure.).  The tires say "SR" on them.  

I still can't find the hand throttle.

Sorry, it's Friday, I couldn't resist.

 Re the number tag related by Omar

I did a some research, since the 307066 looked like an early VIN
number.

> KAROSSERIE
>nr 307066    

After referring to 911&912 Guide by B. Johnson.

 = chassis number for a Porsche assembled 1967 911

>  KUNSTHARZLACK
>   97-6602-L

 = paint code.

 From the 911 factory shop manual.

 6602 = Polo red used in 1966/67

This further confirms the approximate year as the early paint
codes had the year as the first two digits.

   6402 = Ruby red in 64/65
   6602 = Polo red in 66/67
   6802 = Polo red in 68

   The 97, according to the shop manual, refers to a temperature.
   Paint baking/spraying temperature maybe?  The number is not
   in either C/F.  The shop manual said the 97 corresponded to 140F.
   
   The L refers to the paint manufacturer = Lesosal

So on the early cars, the door post number tag had both the 
chassis number and paint code.  Later cars only have the paint code on
the tag.

Daniel -
I own an 88 factory turbo body so I understand your taste.  It's
without question the sexiest body, IMO.

It sounds like the conversion was a good one (steel, not fiberglass)
and that the owner has taken care of it (stayed with original color,
BBS wheels, chain tensioners, etc.).  You say it runs "pretty well".
I hope with only 70k on the original 3.0 engine it runs very well!  I also
hope you have good docs and records, which is always very important.  

Has the owner put on a turbo tail and the proper front air dam?  These
things must always be done together.  Were the front wheel wells
flaired too?  Does it have the larger wheels that go with the turbo?
Obviously it doesn't have the turbo suspension and brakes; that's too
much to hope for.  But if all else is "right" I would consider going
further with the purchase.  Most marque fans treat a converted
Porsche in the same manner as one that's had body damage.  I.e., it's
worth about 10-20% less than an all-original.  But lots of people buy
911's and don't know much at all about them.  These guys buy on
impulse and a sexy looking 911 that appears solid shouldn't make
for too difficult a sale later on.  Purists will shun it so the market
will be a little smaller.

I would be most influenced not by the body conversion but by the state
of the rest of the car.  Have you had it checked out by an expert?  If
everything looks very good and you were happy with the price you
should go for it.  But if questions arise (leakdown test suggests
problems, no records, signs of sloppy paint or poor body work, etc.)

There are lots of really good SC's out there and they are probably the
most durable 911's Porsche ever built.  Pay a little more for a really

I just saw a similar announcement in Autofreak, I mean Autoweek.  
Sounds like PCNA  did a press release timed for release this week.  
Might be interesting to check out, since they claim the parts are made 
to Porsche standards.  The only thing left out was the few extra 
middle-people and overseas shipping (no great loss!).

Anyone have more info from PCNA or the factory?

Subject: Re: "New Porsche parts?"

The EuroSelect Parts thing is pretty interesting from a ring-side sort
of perspective.  By the way, if you own a water-pumper and you don't
have your very own fiche reader, definitely pick up a copy of their
catalog.  The fiche reproductions are quite useful to have.  They are
not complete, neither with respect to covering all parts of the car,
nor to completely calling out all possible parts for the sections they
do show.  But they do give pretty good coverage of almost all the
engine, drivetrain, and so forth.

ESP seems to be a bet-the-house move on PCNA's part.  They are competing
directly with PAG, basically cutting them out of the deal on the fast-
moving parts ESP plans to sell.  Of course, PAG and PCNA have been cut
out for years by wholesale companies like Derentz and the retail
after-marketers like Imparts.  They even get cut out by their OEM
suppliers, for example, when Bosch sells directly to warehousers (like
Derentz) and jobbers (your friendly neighborhood Bosch CSC).  But PAG
has never been cut out by their owner dealer net.

The terms ESP works under a really weird.  First off, they're sourcing
everything from US suppliers.  So I guess this means they won't go to
SKF in Italy to buy bearings.  But would they buy them from SKF's US
arm?  Not clear.

If you take your car into a Porsche dealer for service, the parts the
dealer puts into it absolutely have to be PAG parts, unless the owner
insists on ESP (or I suppose whatever) parts.  Yeah, right.  You can
bet that no small number of dealers will exploit this, putting cheaper
parts in your car at PAG prices.

The ESP parts come with a one-year guarantee, PAG with their standard
two-year guarantee.  If a bad Porsche, say, oil filter went into your
car in the past, and you lost your engine, Porsche would buy you an
engine.  Even if someone other than the dealer, like you, put the part
in.  Unclear what the limitations are on ESP.

If you do get the catalog, be aware that only a very small fraction of
the shown parts are available.  For yuks, I looked up jobber prices on
a number of items that caught my eye when I got the catalog.  Not a one
was available.

Me, I think I hear the sound of hammering in Zuffenhausen.  A gallows
being erected, with "Fred Schwab" writ large on it.

I've just returned from our holidays to Germany, Austria, and Italy.
During the trip I had an opportunity to visit Zuffenhausen (Porsche),
Sindelfingen (MB), Munchen (BMW), and Maranello (Ferrari), and thought
I'd recount my experiences.  The article is long, but hopefully entertaining
enough to read in its entirety.

PORSCHE

First stop was Zuffenhausen.  As soon as we turned on to PorschestraBe, I
began to drool because lined up, as neat as they could be, were a row of
the all new 911's (designated 993 over there).  Porsche's facilities are
small in comparison to the other two German facilities visited.  Current
production is about 60 cars a day (contrast that with MB's 2500).  However,
the atmosphere is warm and intimate.  This being a walking tour, we had a
chance to see everything close up.  We saw the current generation of boxer
engines being built.  Build time is about 4 hours per engine, and only one
person assembles the entire engine.  With the water cooled engines, assembly
is done by small groups, members of which rotate tasks every couple of weeks.

Which reminds me, there were only 8 people on the tour.  A group of four
there to pick up their 928, the three of us, and another motor head from
Stuttgart.

Every car is made to order, as with the other two.  What is really neat is
to see a handbook that follows the assembly of the car around.  At each
phase the assembler or tester initials his employee number against the
suitable entry.  This book is then microfiched and stored as a permanent
record.  It really give me feeling of admiration to see the human touch
in so many aspects of Porsche's facilities.  The people there were terrific.
Very knowledgeable and downright friendly.

I know this story has been posted a few times on the net, but it is something
quite different when you see it for yourself.  In front of our eyes, a regular
boxer engine was attached to a dyno for the power test which it undergoes
for a few minutes.  BTW, all Porsche spec's are minimum specs.  So if they
say that the car has 268 hp, you are guaranteed at least that.  But get this,
NO break-in needed.  Right there, the tester took the engine up to 6200 rpm,
and when oil temperature hit 100 C, he took it up to 6700 rpm.  I thought
I was going to faint ;-).

For the record, all Porsche engines come with synthetic motor oil.  Shell's
TMO if I remember correctly.

On the way to final assembly, we saw the building that Ferry Porsche first
rented, and eventually purchased.  In it the MB 500E's are being built for
Mercedes.

Then it was onto to final assembly.  We saw a boxer engine being installed
into a new 993.  Installation time is about 4 minutes.  Then some of the 968,
and 928 lines.  There were also a few 3.8 specials lined up against the wall
awaiting final assembly, and a 928 getting its electronics put in.  We all
had a bit of a laugh at the site of the 928 with auto tranny guessing that
it was destined for the States or Canada.  Our guess was confirmed by the
guide who pointed out that it had the third brake light installed.

MERCEDES-BENZ

After that it was a mad rush to Sindelfingen, where we arrived just in
time for the last tour.  By contrast, MB's facilities impress you with sheer
size.  The complex seems to go on for miles, with rail lines coming in for
shipping out of finished cars.  The crowd here was quite different of course.
Most were there to pick up cars, and one family was there to see their dad
who worked on the assembly line.  The atmosphere was more formal as well.
To begin we were shown a film on the development of the C-class which I think
is going to be a smashing hit.  A nicely balanced car.  The tour has a bit
of a theme park feel to it.  You get driven around in a multi-segmented bus
which drives right into many of the buildings.

We saw some body assembly (the hoods are finished by hand), and some final
assembly.  It was hard to grasp the process very well because for the most
part you were standing on balconies looking down on rows and rows of assembly
lines.  What was neat was the number of automated carriages that roam the
plant.  In fact, as we were being shown the wiring harness for a base as well
as a fully loaded S-class one of these rob-o-carts actived itself behind us
and started to push in on the listening throng.  Caused more than a few of
us to jump.

As I mentioned before, what impresses here is the sheer mammoth nature of all
of the processes.  However, you don't get a very good idea of what happens
to an individual car.

BMW

Since we were staying with family in Munchen, it seemed natural to visit the
BMW museum and production facilities.  This turned out to be a bit of a
disappointment.  The museum was poorly designed and many of marquee exhibits
didn't work (i.e., "Test Drive of the Future").  It seemed a mish mash of
BMW's history, the history of industrialization, and various other odds
and ends.  The only highlight for me was to be able to see a Z1 roadster
and an M1 up close.  This certainly didn't put me in a very good mood for
the production facility tour, and definitely wasn't worth the admission
price.

The tour began with a stupid slide show about what a great modern industrial
company BMW was.  It was the kind of thing we showed new employees when I
was at Control Data.  The guide didn't have a great deal of depth in her
knowledge either.  Anyway, it was off to see the 3 series production.  One
thing to be said in favour of BMW, was that it emphasized a different aspect
of car manufacturing.  We spent most of our time in the metal stamping
facility.  The idea was to wear remote headphones while the guide spoke into
a mike, but I don't think anyone could hear a thing with all of those stamping
machines banging and crashing everywhere.

The whole thing smacked of what BMW has become in recent years.  They make
pretty good cars, but the whole show is so pretentious that you are tempted
to tell them to stuff it.

AUDI

Audi doesn't have very many tours in English, and had none in November.


...And then my wife and I took off on our own to tour Italy.  We had booked
a tiny Opel Corsa for our trip, but we got a free upgrade to a Fiat Tipo.
This is a wonderful little car which although doesn't shine on the flat out
German autobahns was a real delight in the Italian alps.  It has a wonderful
chassis.  Ask anyone who has had to take the 3 alpine passes and 13 hairpins
which take you into Bolzano if you are coming from Sondrio.  Then ask the
same question of someone who has had to do it in the dead of night, and you
will find the answer to be unequivocal:  The Chassis Is Everything!

But I am getting a little ahead of myself.  After cutting through Austria
we headed down into Italy through Verona towards Firenza.  On the way I got
my first taste of Italian driving.  Either we were in Italy during full-moon
or what you read about Italian driving is patently false.  The drivers in
Italy, although general indifferent to signed rules (which is good for new
tourists who are apt to miss a few) are very generous and maintain superb
lane discipline on the autostrade.  Their driving puts most North American
drivers to shame but then again who doesn't, heh?

On the way from Verona to Firenza (Prato actually, but who'd notice) I saw
a Bugatti EB 110 whiz by going the opposite direction at high speeds.  And
then just as I was commenting to my wife about it we passed the Bugatti
factory.  We got off at Modena (the accent is on the Mo' as many Italians
have corrected me) where we promptly got lost looking for Ferrari.  This
business of getting lost got to be a bit of a habit in Italy actually.
Anyway we finally found our way to Maranello after a number of really friendly
people pointed us on the right direction.

Thus far we had only booked the Porsche tour as I had been told by other
netters that this was essential.  I thought that we could take our chances
with Ferrari since we didn't really have a very good idea when we would be
in Italy.  Anyway, what I hadn't expected was the security guard to go
ballistic when we enquired about any facility tours.  Apparently, Ferrari
doesn't have any.  "Any way to just see the 456GT?".  Not a chance.  This
really put us off, but we were told that there was the Galleria.  Nice
collection of Ferrari's but not like you couldn't see similar collections
elsewhere.  The people there were security guards -- nothing more.  I asked
about the Canadian connection.  "Anything of Gilles Villeneuve's here?", I
asked.  Nope was the reply.  They forgot to mention that one of those twenty
or so cars was his F1 car.

As we left Maranello to say I was disheartened would be an understatement.
The reception at Ferrari was awful.  I recounted to my wife about the birth
of Lambourghini as recounted in CAR a few months back.  How he was unhappy
with his Ferrari and so showed up in Maranello with it.  He was ignored, so he
went home and started his company.

Anyway it was off again.  The landscape of cars in Italy is naturally quite
different from that of Germany.  Alpha's are plentiful, with 164's and Type
33 everywhere.  It is also neat to see so many Lancia's -- something that
you don't see in NA anymore.  The Punto is making a big splash there.  Indeed,
Fiat's sell very well in Bavaria.  Given our experience with the Fiat, and
the reviews of the Punto I think the Italians could get some of the NA market
if they wanted.  The mini cars in Europe are wonderful, compared to the Geo
Metro/Suzuki Swift type of cars we get here.  No one would mistake the Renault
Twingo for anything but a Twingo.

Now that I have complimented Italian drivers, here are my rules and
generalizations on Italian driving and drivers:

1.  Lancia Thema drivers are the Olds 98 drivers of Italy.  Most have there
heads resting against the window with the right arm inserted through the
steering wheel and resting on the steering column.  For the most part they
are asleep or worse.  The left arm is used to prop up their resting head.

2.  Under NO circumstances do you want to find yourself behind an Auto Bianchi
on a road with an up grade of greater than 1%.

3.  Under NO circumstances do you want to be a pedestrian on a road where any
of the lead cars is a Lancia Delta HF.  If you are a pedestrian, you are also
likely to be hit.  I think I got the name right -- this is the steriod pumped
Lancia.

The highlight of the trip?  Automotively, it was without question Porsche.
You see I lost my heart in Zuffenhausen.  In my mind, every single car that
exits the gates, hangs a left onto PorschestraBe, and then sprints up the
tight little S-curve on its way to a road test is endowed with a soul.  And
no one will ever be able to convince me otherwise.  The lustre may have
dulled a bit from the company's Income Statement, but the single minded
dedication of purpose that permeates the facility is like breathing rarefied
air -- it makes you giddy.  Yes, I, like many others, believe they have been
neglecting the budding as opposed to mature or worse non-enthusiast with
bucks.  However, this is a new decade and perhaps a return to the roots is
right.

And now it is back to work.  But if I focus real hard, I can still feel the sea
spray of the Mare de Ligure as it smashes into the breakwater and fills
the air in the Piazza Marconi in Varnazza.  Or breath in the clear cold air of
the Alps as you walk up towards Lago Palu from San Giuseppe.  But isn't that
what travelling is all about?  Being given gifts of experience that you can
store away, and bring out for inspiration when reality seems too harsh.

Thanks for reading.

Ciao!

Subject: Wheel Shimmy Revisited

Thanks everyone for answering all my questions concerning my 86' 944 Turbo
(951), several weeks back. The problem turned out to be bad upper strut
bearings, not a wheel balance problem after all. Took the car to a clinic and it
was discovered. I am going to take the car to the shop next week to have the
work done. Is it a big job? How much are the parts? Is this normal with 85,000
miles on the car? Any comments? Mechanic said wheel alingnment is nessessary
after replacement.

Original submission:

I removed the front wheels to inspect the brake pads, after I replaced the pads
and sensors, I then replaced the wheels. Each wheel was put back on the same
side it came off of. After I did this, when I would reach 60+ mph I noticed a
shimmy in the steering wheel which previously 
was not there. As far as I can see all balance weights are still intact.I did
not put the wheels on the hub exactly as they were,is this critical? I also used
a torque wrench set @ 45 ft. lbs. per spec. ,and cross tightned all lug nuts. Is
ths a common problem when removing wheels, for I've heard that front end shimmy
in early 944's was a problem? If this helps I Have 16" "phone dial type wheels.

Well, while we're dicussing it anyway:  how much is a complete 911 gas heater

  Some, but probably not all, local to KOP are (in no particular order):
 Mechanical
  Dougherty's - West Chester
  West Chester Foreign Car - West Chester
  Galbraith's - Devon
  Korbel's - Bryn Mawr
  YBH Porsche - Edgemont (West Chester)
  Don Rosen Porsche - Norristown
  Holbert's - Willow Grove
 Body

There are more but this is a start.

Subject: technotyping

Hi - Based on a recent study by Dell Computer on "techno-typing" the
typical person, here is suggestion about classifying car drivers.
(IEEE Spectrum, December 1993)

Match yourself to one or more of the colorful categories below:

1. Techno-Wizard: Generally a technology expert or hobbyist who wants the
hottest Porsche at the lowest price.  Greatest concern is losing the edge. 

2.  Techn-To-Go: Wants a car that come ready to go right out of the
showroom.  Interested in what the Porsche can do, but not how it works.
Pays great attention to hp, mileage, 0-60mph times etc.  Greatest
concern is being left without proper technical assistance and a trustworthy
mechanic.

3.  Techno-Boomer: Wants to look smart on the road; researches
carefully and seeks recommendations before making a considered purchase. 
Greatest concern is ending up buying the wrong Porsche. 

4.  Techno-Phobe:  Rejects technology or avoids buying any Porsche 
dated after 1980.  Is quite comfortable with his/her car. 

5.  Techno-Teamer: Uses the car to drive to work, and is also part of
the local PCA.  Greatest concern is mechanical/engine failure. 



               Regards,
                    VIjay Madisetti

Subject: Need Texas info!

I just had a job interview in Houston, and it sounds like I'd be nuts
to turn the job down if offered to me.  My question is...

What's it like being a car-nut in Texas, especially Houston?

We've lived in the Boston area for a year, I imagine Texas is friendlier
to cars, at least weatherwise.  What are registration and insurance costs
like?  Know any good Porsche mechanics in Houston?  I hear it floods
pretty regularly.  How do you protect the cars? Any favorite neighborhoods/
towns around Houston?  Any to avoid?

We lived in Northern California before Boston, so any comparisons to 
those areas would be especialy welcome.

Who knows if I'll even get a job offer, but I'd like to be able to make
an intelligent decision if I do.  

Thanks in advance for your input!

Subject: Monthly Update

December 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Well, still hanging in... This is the "busy" month, with travel to NJ twice,
the Bay.Area for a week starting Monday, and if I'm *REAL* good, Houston
to visit my wife and cars (and cats) somewhere in there....

Some mail system changes have gone into effect, having some interesting
side effects. In theory, things should be better; in practice, some
of you seem to be getting messages out-of-order. Don't worry about it --
I understand what the problem is, and can hopefully get it fixed over
the Christmas holidays...

The Who's Who is possibly getting a bit stale... *PLEASE* check your entry
and make sure I have your cars, state of residence, and e-mail address
correct! Remember, I only list P-cars, so if your Zagatto isn't on the list
don't take it personally.... Oh, mail your changes to "porschephiles-request"
please...

We have a *LOT* of new members this month, so *READ UP*. Even you old-timers
seem to forget some of this stuff..

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!!

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Re: Wheel Shimmy Revisited

It's not that unusual to have a shock bearing get pretty loose with as
much mileage as you have (85K).  I don't think you need to realign the
car, because you can replace the bearing without unfastening anything
except the four bolts in the bearing carrier which fasten it to the
inner fender wall.  You would have to realign it if it were necessary to
loosen or remove the camber eccentric at the bottom of the strut, or
the caster bolt on the rear leg of the a-arm.

Btw, it is also common to find radial play in the shock itself, where
the piston rod enters the shock.  This will feel like a loose wheel
bearing.  If you replace the shock to cure the play, you will need to
realign the front.  Or at least reset the camber.  But since about half
the work is getting the car on the alignment machine with the four
wheel sensor units set up, it makes sense to just do the whole thing.

Yes, a broken one.

Does anyone know of where I might obtain a destroyed 944 engine.
One which has no value... FREE  :-)

I am in the market for a 944 and would like to learn as much about the
vehicle as possible. I also have the opportunity to work w/ a 944 race car and
need to familiarize myself w/ the nitty gritty.

A zylinderkompf alone would be useful. But only w/ some valve train intact.

If on the off chance anyone knows of a complete car which is a basket case
I could be interested as a 944 ITS car may be in my plans soon. (No,
Nathan I can't quite afford your NARRC champ car :-)

Subject: Re: Need Texas info!

>What's it like being a car-nut in Texas, especially Houston?

Well, Houston is a pretty fine place if you like cars -- the winters
are mild, there's *NO SALT*, and you can drive open-top cars year round.
There are plenty of go-fast freeway/major highway sections, not
too much in the way of "interesting" roads though (nothing like say
Skyline Drive, for instance) until you get to the Texas Hill Country
where things get really beautiful and there are some spectacular roads...

>We've lived in the Boston area for a year, I imagine Texas is friendlier
>to cars, at least weatherwise.  

Yup. May freeze twice a year. No snow, or at least, no regular snow.
The rain gets ponderously boring after a while, though...

>What are registration and insurance costs like?  

My '81 911SC has about $60/year in registration costs, and about $1k/year
in insurance, with 300/100/100 limits and a $500 deductible on comp
and collision. That's *FULL* coverage including under/un-insured motorist,
which is almost a must around here... my '64 356SC, insured for a stated
value of $25,000 but otherwise to the same limits, is about $1600/yr, with 
no limits on what I can do with the car (i.e. not some froo-froo "parade 
and club activities" policy...) My wife's "civilian car" (J-random pacrim 
sedan) is about half what my 911 is...

>Know any good Porsche mechanics in Houston?  

You bet. Know a bunch of bad ones, too. Shoot me a note with your car
type, and I'll fill you in. There's no one "best" place for all
types/vintages of Porsche (or other car -- I know a lot of those guys too...)

>I hear it floods pretty regularly.  How do you protect the cars? 

You are careful. There are places you just don't drive when it storms. 
Or, you have a beater to drive when it's flooding. In 15 years,
I've had one car flood damaged, and only would have had one other
(except I was able to drive it up into the courtyard of the apartments 
I lived in at the time...)

>Any favorite neighborhoods/towns around Houston?  Any to avoid?

Good: Bellaire. West University Place. Southside Place. Parts of the
Heights. Parts of the "neartown"/Montrose area. River Oaks. Sweetwater.
South Shore Harbor.

Bad: "x" Ward, for 0 < x < 8. Parts of the Heights. Anyplace with
obvious gang graffiti. Anyplace you can smell or hear a refinery...
Anyplace east of I-45 and both south of Greenspoint and north of NASA-1...

>We lived in Northern California before Boston, so any comparisons to 
>those areas would be especialy welcome.

Traffic isn't as bad, but it gets close in rush hour. It's tougher to 
drive in Houston than Boston or NorCal -- there is a *HUGE* mix of
driving styles that people imported with them in the great influx of the
late 80's. Prices will seem cheap relative to either location.

>Who knows if I'll even get a job offer, but I'd like to be able to make
>an intelligent decision if I do.  

Hopefully, this is of some help. Scott Jessen, a recent NorCal transplantee
may be able to give you some more insight...

Subject: Escort Endurance 951

While racing my Porsche-wanna-be IT Rabbit this year at Nelson Ledges
I met a fellow who had just bought an ex- SCCA Escort Endurance 951.
While I was extremely curious about this car a persistant misfile in my
Volkswagen prevented me from spending as much time snooping around his car
as I would have liked. 

So, nettters...what are the specs on this factory? race car.
 - Is it the same as the cars running the turbo cup in Canada?
 - Are the parts I saw on this car. (magnesium phone dials, intake man.
etc) available from Porsche?
 - Were these cars built by Porsche or was constuction farmed out?
 - Finally, where can I find published info on 1994 race cars such as these?
 - Not just books, but maybe Porsche info for prospective owners when the
cars were offered for sale?

Subject: Many 924 questions; my new tank, dash removal, rain tires,  924S

Hi All-

Item 1:

A while back I got a new tank to replace an old one that had seen better
days.  The new tank I got for myy '77 924 fits well and doesn't leak, but
the new tank I got has a *completely* different fuel level sending unit
setup.  Instead of the twist-lock system, there are 6 allen bolts holding
the sender in place (which looks alot more solid and less prone to leakage,
BTW).  What year is this tank from?  One of the 924S series?

Item 2:

Although I feel my car is sometimes on its last legs, one of my pipe dreams
after I graduate is to fix up the car *right*.  Mechanically, things are 
quite sound, but the interior (which include some eletrical gremlins,  
busted heater control (for floor/defrost), and the ubiquitous cracked dash)
could use a lot of help.  I was wondering how difficult it was to pull the
dash; any pointers from those who have done it?  I notice in my electrical 
spaghetti under the drivers side that there are a few wires that might need
replacing, and I was wondering if this is an easier job with the dash out
(it would seem so).

Item 3:

I'm sure this is on the archive, but I've got to figure out how to use
it first.  Recommendations for good tires in the rain/snow?  MS recommended
Yoko UVS; anyone else?  

Item 4:

In case of true insanity, and I decide to look for a used 924S when I 
graduate, can any 924S owners give me (or the rest of the list) their
impressions?  When was the last year of production for the 924S?  From
my limited knowledge, you basically have a 944 with a 924 skin, right?
(Although I think there were some tire/suspension differences as well.)

Thanks in advance for any input,

A.

Subject: Cool Carbons

Could someone explain to me the differences between the
Cool Carbon color codes. 

Also which color code would be best suited for a stock 86 930,
the car is driven 50% on street and 50% on track. Car has stock
drilled and vented rotors, and I use Yoko 008RS (last 3 track
sessions).

I'm fairly aggressive, not to smooth, and rely a lot on my brakes.
I've been happy with Textar pad performance though I go
through them fairly quickly(they are getting hard to find).
Tried the Bendix pads that the 
Auto-Technica guys recommended, they last 3 or 4 laps before
I lose my brakes, I've tried everything they've suggested but
I always revert to the Textar pads to get me through a 
whole track session.

Recommendations on manufacturers of air scoops for the front
brakes would be appreciated.

Subject: 914 speedo calibration?

Hi   

914 driver's manual says that the '72 came with 155 SR 15s, with an
option of 165 SR 15 on either 4 1/2J or 5 1/2J rims (and if subsequently
installed the spedometer must be replaced).

Now, I have 185/65HR15s on the car.  Wheels appear to be factory standard
steel.  My speedo does not start at 0.

So, how close is my indicated speed to actual speed?  Miles accumulating
faster or slower on the odometer as compared to actual?

Curious, but also careful.  20 mph speed limit is being enforced on campus.

Thanks,
Pam  collopy@leland.stanford.edu

Hi guys. Can somebody help me.

My 84 carrera cabriolet is suffering from increasingly foggy rear plastic

Does somebody out there have an explanation for this phenomenon and how to stop 
it from happening. Reversing it is probably impossible.

   there was an alternative suggestion that we gather with the Golden Gate

OK, so now it turns out that I can't make it on Friday night (12/10)!
(My wife reminded me of a previous engagement.)

So, I propose meeting for dinner at the same time and place on
Saturday.  Stan has said he can make it then.  There were only two
responses to my original Friday suggestion, and if both of you can't
make it Saturday, then I will book the Friday reservation and nobly
let the party go on without me.

The proposal is now to meet for dinner at 7:00 PM on Saturday, 12/11,
at Sports City in Cupertino.  Everyone who is interested please drop
me an e-mail note ASAP.  If you can't make Saturday but could make
Friday, let me know and I'll try to work out the constraint problem.

Subject: RE: Cool Carbons

I have a friend with the identical car (except color!) who uses 
Performance Friction pads.  He drives his 30 primarily on the track.  
Performance Friction pads are similar to CC's except for some 
color-code differences:

CC	PF	Friction
- ------------------------
Red	Blue	Highest
Blue	Red	Medium
?	Black	"Street"

He used PF blues, which squealed and locked-up too much (no ABS), so he 
switched to PF reds and likes them.  At the moment, he has blacks but 
hasn't fully evaluated them yet.  The blues squealed, but the red & 
black PF's are quiet.  He reports that users of both CC colors have 
squealing brakes (sounds like a city bus!)

He also recommended that you don't machine your rotors - just use them 
until they wear out with these pads.  The pads wear-in better when they 
do *not* have a smooth finish to slide against.

Hope this helps,

if you are in the area!  Here's the invitation my roomate John made.

Steve

Toga, toga, toga!!!!!!
Get your sheets out and be ready for an evening of decadence munching on grapes
and consuming wine and beer!!!!

When:  Friday, December 10, 1993

Place: my house
       16041 Blossom Hill Road, Los Gatos

Time:  6pm - 8pm (Barbeque)
       8pm - sunrise (Party, dancing, drinking, etc.)

Directions:
          From San Jose, take 17/880 south towards Santa Cruz
          Take the first Los Gatos exit, Lark Ave.
          Make a left on Lark Avenue and go over 17/880
          Make a right on Los Gatos Blvd.
          At the third light make a left (this is Blossom Hill Road)
          Go past two lights with a plaza, school, and baseball fields on the
          right side.
          As the road goes into the hills and veers to the left, you will see
          a field on the right.
          The house is across from the field. Look for a Blue Ford Explorer
          and a silver Porsche 911.

RSVP:     408-356-3236 (home - me)
          408-356-8303 (home - John, roommate)
          johna@kpc.com steveb@netcom.com (email RSVP) 

Attire:   Togas are required but creative alternatives will be accepted.
          A bottle of champagne each will be awarded to the sexiest male
          and female toga costumes.

Entertainment: We'll be spinning tunes to dance to, so be prepared to
          for some hip-gyrating motion!! We'll probably run a video of
          Animal House... Why not??!?!

Food/Drink: BYOB / BYOF
          We will have certain exotic drinks available, munchies, and Roman
          fruits to consume...

Be prepared for a weekend of sin, lust, and gluttony!!!!

You can park on Blossom Hill Road or one of the side streets. I would not park
in the church lot that is by the field. For the nearest side streets, Atwood Ct
is before the house and Stephanie lane is right after the house. I think that
your best bet is either in our driveway, or on Stephanie lane.

You can bring family and friends. The only rule is that the house stays in one
piece.

I've heard this idea proposed before, and I'm honestly curious--what's the 
point?  Do you want to hold a few dinner meetings or maybe a  tour?  Get the 
members to meet at some mutually convenient site for an autocross?  Publish 
a newsletter (isn't that basically what this forum is?)?

Is it that you want political representation and voting power?  Why?  Most 
of the issues that you could vote on are about how to conduct  events, 
manage budgets and elect officers.  So if you don't have a geographical 
region, what kind of events would you conduct?  If you don't have events, 
what would be the interest in budgets or officers?   If you do attend PCA 
events, why not join the region that holds them?

I'm absolutely open to the possibility that there's some motivating factor 
that I'm completely missing, and if so, please tell me what it is.

2_ On an 85 911 coupe, factory Turbo body, aftermarket steel slant

   On the driver side door jamp and the post of the wind shield,
   the VIN numbers are the same: WPOZZZ91ZFS120375.
   On the floor (inside the front trunk), it is WPOABO906FS120375.
   Should there be any difference between them? If not, it is
   possible that the entire front of the car may be from another
   car, right?

3_ What are the major differences between 84-86 911 and 87-89?
   
   - 87-89 has G50 tranny and hydraulic clutch 84-86 has old tranny.
   - any other difference?

Engine is interesting story and lesson for those who are not against learning

I've driven turbo since last May, from 0 to in excess of 130, in wet and dry
etc. Nice car to drive. At proper RPM pulls skin from your facial bones. Looks
like sex should 
an be. But...on the track, I've watched good drivers in
injected/carbed Porsches consistently outrun turbos, and have experienced it
myself. To really get the turbos to the place where they are competitive
across the speed range is very costly, and about puts them off the street for
all practical matters, EPA aside. Bottom line, it depends on what you're
trying to do, have to do it with, and want out of it.

The ZZZ in positions 6-4 is correct; Porsche always does this.  I don't
know why, other than the fact that these positions carry the body code,
engine code, and restraint system, and perhaps they haven't made up
their mind when the chassis is produced.

Are you sure about the 1 vs. 0 in position 8?  Should be a 1 in both
cases fr a 911.

The Z in position 9 is what they call a "test code."

Well heres a little story that will remind you to get into the habit of pushing
in your clutch every time you have to brake.
 I was driving my 356 yesterday to school on I-40 in NC and I was playing with
something in the passenger seat when I looked up and saw this land barge coming
straight at me. I was going west she was going east, I yanked the steering wheel
and she slammed head on into the car behind me. Since I yanked on the steering
wheel so hard I spun out and went into the median. Right as the car came to a 
stop(I am now facing east but at an angle) I looked up and saw a transfer truck
coming right at me. I poped the clutch on floored it and went shooting into the
grass on the other side of the interstate. I don't remember pushing the clutch
in but I have always done it, I would hate to think what would have happened if
my engine wasn't still running. All of this took less than 10sec but it seemed
like an hour. 
 Funny thing was this morning there was an accident in the same spot but on the

I like this idea a lot!  We should invite the other clubs (PCxx) to 
join *us*!  We have lots of social events and great conversations, just 
no activities that we directly share.  I think we're doing quite fine 
as a grass-roots organization, without political nonsense or

this strikes me as the same sort of reasoning as living with someone and
thinking "i have this great relationship - why spoil it with marriage?"
which, believe me, i have a lot of sympathy for.

in one sense it would be, um, well, legitimizing what is already fact, that
we probably spend more time interacting with other porschephiles than with
members in our pca regions.

for another, call it somewhat-more-than-idle curiosity.  the novelty might
shake some people up, it might be cool [dude], but taken on a cost/benefit
basis there's really no point.  hold it, how many people buy porsches on
cost/benefit?

i hadn't thought of virtual autocrosses.  if mud's were more interactive,
i suppose there would be a chance.  might even get all those concours people
who otherwise are afraid to take their cars out of their garages!

You can always just pry the circular metal ring off. . .  If you don't care

Maybe not, but they are certain to last longer (and will probably stop a

Subject: 924S/944 engine removal

Hello-

This weekend I plan on starting on swapping the tired, worn abused engine
in my '87 924S (no flames please!-The previous owner is the guilty one!)
for a new (or at least new to me!) one.

I figured I'd see if any 924/944 motorheads have any words of wisdom to
pass along to make this job easier!

I have the factory manuals and am no stranger to engine swaps, but this is
the first major repair I'm doing on my first Porsche.  The major concerns
I have in just reading over the factory manual are:

1)Do I need special tool VW???? to support the engine while removing the
bolts for the main cross member underneath or can I getaway with carefully
using a winch/cherry picker or some other make shift tool?

2)Once the four bolts for the torgue tube to clutch housing are removed
and everything else is removed; as I begin to lower the engine will I have
to pull the engine forward to free the shaft inside the torque tube from
the clutch- I assume I will, but the manual isn't very clear.

Any other advice or war/horror stories you can offer!

Thanks in advance!  
I'm sure I'll have more questions as I get into it!

Mercedes tour.  I'm glad you told us about your Europe trip so that maybe next

Hmmmm . . .  Calculator time. . .
155 mm * .75 (standard aspect ratio) = 116.25 mm = 4.58 in + 15 in = 19.58 in
185 mm * .65 =                                        120.25 mm = 4.73 in + 15
in = 19.73 in
The new tires are about 0.8% larger than the old.  Lost in the noise.  The
speedo works
on that "induced current" thing, where a rotating magnet makes an aluminum disk
turn.
It is calibrated by the return spring, which doesn't seem to be all that
accurate. . .
If you feel the burning need to find out, I'm sure AAA offers a Speedo
calibration service
(they'll at least tell you how far off you are), you can find one of those
automated radar trailers in Mountain View, or you could go make friends with a
cop. . .  Or you could use someone who has done one of those for calibration. .

The car is a '78 911 SC, red/orange, sunroof, tail, 3.0L.  The car

One of the criteria for becoming a member of PCA is that you must own a
Porsche, running or not.  This is not necessary in order to become a member
of this list.  Are you saying that we will start to enforce this, and that
Stan or Kevin will have to do a title search for verification before we let
someone join in our raindeer games?  I don't think that PCA will budge on
that issue, and besides, the main reason to join PCA in you local region is
to go to Porsche based competitions, tours, and social events with others who
also drive a Porsche.  Now I have a pretty sophisticated system at home, but
it is still a far cry from a multimedia cyberspace port wherein I could
interact with say one of the Ghost racing 914's that Stan talks about, or
even plug in and take a test drive of a new 993 around Stuttgard.  Until that
is a possibility, or you write the software that makes it possible, I have to
vote no.

Subject:  Water inside!

Had this happen this AM...won't be able to check it until Saturday, so
I'm in search of suggestions prior to pulling things apart:

Car:  1985 911 Coupe with Sunroof

Problem:  Water infiltration into passenger compartment.  Source appears
to have been the top of the passenger 'A' column (near/at the visor
attachment point).

On the normal AM routine, zipped around a short/quick right turn and saw
a "slurp" (spritz?) of water arch down...maybe 2 ounces of liquid.  I
reached over and found the visor's attachment base/screws wet but still
firm...no mushyness, yet.


Diagnosis:  I have no idea (help!).  My suspicians would be either the
passenger door's seal, or the sunroof drainage system if Porsche uses
such an animal.  Driveway is sloped, so the car's nose is lower (around
6" lower than back), so trickles would traverse towards the A column.

The car has to live outside and we had 2-3" of heavy rain this weekend,
so obviously, something got in somewhere.  

How to I locate & clean the sunroof drains (if they exist)?
Any recommendations on a good way of checking the passenger door seal?
What else should I be looking for?  (Besides a house WITH a garage)

Regarding an electronic PCA region, I'll place my vote with 
those who said we already have a better deal. We're a world-
wide community, we have the equivalent of a "War Bonnet Technical
Session" every day of the year (complete with some very accomplished
experts in nearly every aspect of Porschedom) and this is a lot
more intertaining than most PCA meetings. 

It WOULD be fun sometime to have a TCP concours event, where we send
in photos of our cars (with or without benefit of electronic editing)
for judging. I'm not sure if our faithful moderator's computer could
take the abuse, though.  Rather than joining an already-good-but 
somewhat-stodgy-and-provincial organization like PCA, we should take
advantage of the unique aspects of our worldwide cyber-community.

Subject: Porsche Owners as really caring people

Porsche-friends, I live in St. Louis and am a member of the local PCA chapter.  
Last Saturday we had our annual banquet/Christmas party/awards dinner/election 
results announcement meeting and there is one notable item I'd like to share.

During this year's Midwestern flood, one of our chapter's most active members 
lost his home and business to the floods, many of his personal belongings, etc.  
He saved much of his Porsche stuff (cars roll) and some of his farm's livestock 
but lost a lot, more than any insurance covered.  Our chapter distributed a 
request for some assistance for his family to all of the other PCA chapters and 
there has been a fine response.  A Colorado chapter sent monies for local 
charities and a check for $1,000 to our affected member.  This display of 
generosity makes me proud to be a member of the club and associated with this 
quality of people.

So, on your way home tonight, count your blessings and ponder the friendships 
that you have developed due to your choice in vehicles.

The sunroof has little drain slits around its trough.  Look carefully 
in the corners, you should see them.  Probably you've got a blockage.  
Test with a glass of water and probe with long stiff wire (but don't 
trash the plastic drain tube).

No, you can support the front of the engine by propping under the PS
pump or some place close to that.  This assumes you still have the back
hooked up.

Not likely, there's nowhere for the engine to move forward.  You really

Subject: 944 Info

I have several books on the 944 series. The 944 is a great car, but when buying
one used make sure that their are detailed service records! A MUST!
Try to avoid 1983 & 1984 model years, many changes were made since then.
Excellence published an article " How to buy a used 944", very informative. This
back issue is out of print, but I can fax you the info (April 1993). Look for a
very clean car. Check out who has driven it and what does this person do, is he
meticlious.The car is very durable and can have a long life if taken care of
properly. All of the 944's are a good buy at this time. Remember that that the
944 series has been discountinued, used prices will start to level off soon.
Research everything first,then BUY! don't wait too long though. WATERPUMPS are a
problem, they don't last long especially if it is the older type.BELTS are
important especially the TIMING BELT ,check those service records.TIMING Belt
must be replaced every 30,000 miles and checked every 15k. As far as what year
to buy, remember improvements have been made every year since the car was
introduced in 1982. Many parts were updated.I prefer the middle years 1985 1/2
- --- 1988 good values in these years, but then again it all depends on how much
you can afford. If you look hard $10,000 will get you a cherry 944, even a
turbo.Inspect the cars interior, how was it taken care of? Does it have all
documents included? All keys etc..(wheel lock keys to)
My theory is simple, if the center console cassette box door is not broken, Buy
it. Almost true. There is alot to be said about 944's, there fun to drive fast,
handling is superb,lots of room inside, a car that starts every morning no
matter what the weather is, great body design, and it is a Porsche (yes that
uses H 2 0 ) thats OK! Well hope this helps. E-Mail me or Call me @ (609)
645-8167 I will be glad to chat.

This is my first msg to Porschephiles, I'm accessing it via CSERVE.

Now for my questions.
Does anyone have tire size recommendations for my 951.  With 7"x16" wheels
in front and 8"x16" wheels in the rear, I'm considering 225/50's in front
with 245/45's on the rear.  What about 225/45's for the front (Yokohama 
has'em in this size).  I currently have 255/50's in the rear and it rubs 
slightly when I GET ON IT HARD.  Has anyone successfully used 255/50's

I assume the transmission drive shaft setup is similar on the 944 as on the 924/931.

You might be lucky enough not to have to remove the transmission.  Disconnecting the CV/Half shafts from the transmission and freeing the tranmission mounts will allow the transmission to slide back.  Hopefully enough to free the shaft from the clutch disk.

Try not to remove the transmission from the torque tube as it is a real b**** to connect it back in there.  Especially trying to tighten up those allen head bolts way up in that twilight zone.  Actually starting them in the holes is the hardest part.  Unless of course you have elongated/tapered fingers. B-)

When I replaced the clutch on my 931 about a year ago I tried to get away with not removing the transmission.  But I was about 1/4 inch to short.  The transmission would not slide back any further and was pressed against the fuel tank.  I tried anything for a couple of hours before I finally succumbed and pulled the tranmission - which then cost me many more hours of labour.

Mine is a 1982 model, yet a friends with a 1981 931 said that when they did the engine rebuild there was enough room to get the clutch disk out by just sliding back the transmission.  The had forgot to put the flywheel back in the right position and did a quick realignment without all the hassles I had in pulling the transmission.

How come you don't want to use the stock 205/55 front and 225/50 rear
tire sizes?  I've been very pleased with Yoko AVS Intermediates in
that size plus I can run the car in stock class.

I seem to recall that Mark Donohue wrote that the proper procedure was

There are drain holes located at all 4 corners of the sunroof compartment
in my 80 SC.  They drain out in front from somewhere around the wheel
wells and in back from a hole on either side of the upper corner of the
engine compartment just under the lid I believe.  The holes are connected
by short plastic connectors to metal tubes, right near where they exit the
sunroof compartment.  You can clean them with short blasts from an air
hose (not sure of a good pressure setting).  I would avoid poking at them
for fear of dislodging or harming the plastic connectors.

I think that once all control is lost (is spinning) then one should 
"both feet in" and pray. I was not sure if Omar was advocating "clutch
in while braking" under other circumstances. Perhaps on re-reading his post
that is not what he meant. I have had two total loss of control situations
in a 911. With one I managed to hit the clutch in time to keep the 
engine going, the other happened so fast I was not able to hit hte clutch in time.

Subject: Re 914 speedo calibration v

                              Re 914 speedo calibration vs tire size
Our first cut at a calibrating speedo adapter after a tire size swap 
is the distance covered by one revolution of the tire, which we get 
from the loaded revolutions per mile. For that we have some industry
measurements and some approximating math. Unfortunately, the narrowest 
15 inch tire in my table of measurements is a 195, so its time for 
the math:

overall diameter (inches) = rim diameter+(section width*aspect ratio)/1270
no-load rev/mile = 20168 / overall diameter
loaded rev/mile = 20800 / overall diameter

The 1270 factor hides metric and percent conversions and twice the free
section height. The ~20K number hides a mile worth of inches and pi. 

The difference between no-load and loaded accounts for the effect of the 
car weight on the tires. For the mathematically inclined, its an
industry-standard 3.1 percent, empirically adopted based on maximum 
allowed tire pressure and tire load, driven at 50 mph. Yes, measured 
values differ slightly, but then if you've got the measured value you 
don't need the math approximation ;-)

I don't remember what aspect the stock 914 tires were, but guess they were
either 70 or 75. Which yields the following short table of approximate
speed differences using the current rubber:

If Stock was:     185x65 will indicate:
   155x75              1.3% slower
   155x70              3.9% slower
   165x75              1.1% faster
   165x70              1.5% slower

Worst case is you're speeding by 4%. Of course, that's *if* the speedo 
was originally accurately calibrated to those tire sizes, which is rare 
for any manufacturer shipping multiple tire sizes on a given model. And
within the noise found in individual instrument calibration curves.

But don't tell that to the cops - they don't know the variances. One
looked at the 195x60s on my 914, asked if that was the original tire
size, and let me go with an admonishment to get the speedo calibrated.
I didn't tell him I was doing a calibration check at the time ;-)

I was planning on removing the engine from the bottom as the factory
manual suggests.  Although, it seems it would be easier from the top (I
wouldn't have to worry about having the car up high enough to lower the
engine with the main cross member & steering rack attached).  Maybe the
reason the factory suggest removing it from the bottom is because you
avoid messing with removing the transaxle?

Has anyone found it easier pulling it from the top? Comments?

Thanks in advance!

As long as you don't allow the reservoir to ever go down to the
bottom, getting air into the master cylinder won't be a concern. Don't
try to drain the reservoir 100%. Just take most of the fluid out of
the reservoir with a syringe (like a turkey baster) and then fill with
new clean fluid and flush the old fluid out of the lines. Keep topping
off the reservoir with new fluid until you're satisfied that you've
done a complete flushing job. 2 pints of new fluid should be
sufficient, or 3 if you're very picky.

Well, I've tried it, and it works. Not about helping to regain control,
which isn't the point of that advice. What it helps with is to keep
the engine running "in case you still need it"...

I was mulling over the ideas of virtual concours and virtual

Actually, has the idea of "compensating" Stan for this

I'm sure you'll get as many recommendations for this procedure as there are
respondents.  Here's one person's approach.
1.  Get a buddy.  This is a two person job, particularly if you're completely
replacing the fluid. 2. Gather proper materials & equipment: box wrench of
proper size to loosen & tighten bleeder; container to drain old fluid into;
length of clear plastic tubing of small enough ID to fit tightly over bleeder;
UNOPENED container(s) of fluid in sufficient quantity to fill system.
3.  Loosen lugs.  4.  Jack up right (passenger side) rear corner of car.
5.  Remove RR wheel. 6. Sit buddy in car.  7.  Fit box wrench over bleeder, fit
plastic tubing over nipple, run tubing into used fluid container.  8.  Instruct
buddy to press on brake pedal; open bleeder with wrench; let fluid out; close
bleeder; instruct buddy to let up on pedal.  9.  Check fluid reservoir.  When
it is about 1/2" below full, fill with fresh brake fluid.  10.  Do steps 8 & 9
until fresh fluid comes out in your hose.  11.  Do steps 5 - 10 for the other 3
wheels in this order:  LR, RF, LF.  MAJOR THING to be careful of -- AVOID
letting the fluid level in the reservoir get too low. Good luck!

That's what I learned, too...When in doubt both feet out.  In a spin both feet
in.  However, It sounds like that's exactly what Evans is talking about.  The
bottom line , as I learned it, is to keep the engine and tranny connected as
long as possible AND keep the engine running.  Thus, when you're not sure,
avoid disengaging the clutch.  When you've lost it, DO disengage the clutch (
and use the brake unless you are on wet grass) so you don't kill the motor. 
I've tried it, and it works for me.  Anyone else?

Makes sense to disengage the clutch while in a spin as you will probably 
exit it in reverse, but surely you are not advocating  disengaging under 
normal braking?

Perhaps the reason the factory manual suggests removing it from the 
bottom, is that is how it is inserted, with tourque tube, transaxle,
halfshafts, and suspension bits attached! I seem to recall seeing factory 
photos of this assy method for both the 924/944 and 928. Some fun eh?

No idea what's causing the discoloration.  Before replacing the window,
I'd first try cleaning it.  Mequires makes a polish and a cleaner for
plastic of this sort.  Eastwood also has a bunch of products.

Check the drain slits along the bottom of the door, making sure they are
clear of debris.  If they're really clogged, it may be necessary to
disassemble the door's interior trim to clean the inside properly.

Somebody asked about testing seals.  Get one person to sit inside the
car, and a second to blast away with a garden hose.  Start with a little
pressure, travelling around the door edges.  Increase the water pressure
as needed to find any leaks.

There have been updates to the 911 door seals over the years to deal
with leaking and wind noise.

More importantly, it keeps you from running the engine backwards during
or as a result of a spin.  Which really happens and is really expensive.

Another reason to do so, is that it lessens/removes the risk of your
bringing the car back onto the track and shooting across to the other
side.  I have seen more cars destroyed because the driver hooked a wheel
or two back on the asphalt and did this.  Very sad...

It takes real presence of mind to do the right thing when you get in
over your head, be it correcting and getting it back under control, or
driving off, or putting both feet in.  Kudos to those who do!

Subject: Found a 951S (and now have lots of parts for sale)

Thanks to everyone who helped me in my search for a 944 Turbo S.  Bought  
one today, in Cambridge, MA, which is only about 1.5 hours north of here.   
I'd made an offer of $15k to the owner several weeks ago, which he  
declined, but he then called me up this past Sunday and accepted it.  Red  
exterior, grey interior, in close to perfect condition with 70k miles on  
it.  Much too pretty to turn into a race car....

But, tomorrow it starts coming apart!  I will have a complete list in a  
couple of weeks, but I now have lots of parts for sale.  Basically, the  
only things we're keeping are the chassis, some of the engine, some of the  
suspension, the transmission, front spoiler, windshield, and brakes.   
Everything else, including all of the interior, all glass except the  
windshield, fenders, hood, exhaust system, turbo, wiring harness, DME  
system, etc. is now for sale.

When I get on my '86 951 real hard for say a 1/2 mile or so and then shut things
down quickly it then stutters.  I can't go anywhere faster than a walking pace.
Bucking and snorting in the process.  It will not idle, but surges and snorts.
If I turn it right off and then back on things are usually OK.  If I let it
surge and snort for say 30-45 seconds things are OK and off I go.  This run up
is done at operating temp. not cold, happens once a month or so, not everytime.
Anyone else seen this?

Subject: 951 power steering

Doug Dykaar asked me about removing the power steering from his 951.  I  
thought the info might be of general interest, so I've forwarded my reply  
to porshephiles.

Cc: ulrich

Doug:

I have some first-hand knowledge racing a 944 without power steering, and  
lots of second-hand knowledge about racing 944s of various flavors  
(including 951s) without power steering.

The power steering rack has a quicker ratio than the manual steering rack  
(which was only available on early 944s).  For this reason, in our race  
cars we use the power steering rack without any power assist.  However, it  
is pretty high effort, especially for longer races or track sessions.  I  
have experienced no problems, even for 2-hour sessions, but I'm 6'4", 200  
lbs, and very fit.  Our team manager, who's 5'9", 170 lbs and not fit at  
all, but an excellent driver, could only take one day of track sessions at  
Mont Tremblant (he was very stiff the next day and decided not to drive).

The manual rack is a slower ratio, but as a result, requires less effort.   
Leigh Miller, who rents rides in 944S2s to well-heeled individuals who  
want to race in Firehawk, runs the manual racks, and thinks it makes the  
car easier to drive.

Installing a manual rack or removing the power assist from a power rack  
frees up lots of space in the front of the engine, and probably results in  
an increase in horsepower (no idea how much).  The removed components  
probably weigh on the order of 5-10 lbs.

Basically (from memory), you remove the power steering pump, belt, drive  
pulley, cooler, reservoir, and lines.  The lines that go from the rack to  
the pump must be connected back into the rack, _not_ plugged.  I don't  
remember exactly the plumbing, but it was pretty obvious.  If you can't  
figure it out, let me know, I have to perform the same modification on our  
new race car and I can write down the procedure exactly.

Good luck!

I think the "when in doubt both feet out" part means don't step on the
2 left pedals because either of them would cause a sudden change in the
balance of the car and possibly put the car into a spin which could have
been avoided.
In other words, I think sudden movements would be bad in an impending loss
of traction situation.

Gail asked about water in door because the window comes up wet.  I've had
the same problem on my Subaru SVX and discovered that it's only porous
"seals" and sound proofing that take a while to dry out - there's not
standing water in the door.  A friend's 911 did the same thing - just needed
a few (3-5) dry days for the inards to dry out!

<fwds delted, for information only>

<Delete now if you do not own a Valentine One Radar Detector...>

Here's some news about Valentine Research.

1) A new model with SuperWide band is either shipping now, or will ship
in January.

2) A new model with LIDAR detection will be shipping in January 1994.

3) If you already own a VAL1, you will be able to update your unit to
BOTH or these options.

The SuperWide update will be between $30-40, the LIDAR update will be
between $70-100.  Max you will pay for both is about $150 (to upgrade
your existing VAL1).  Hoorah for the good guys!!  Watch your mailbox
for a notice in January.

Tech. notes about the Valentine LIDAR unit:  This *sounds* like a
breakthrough unit in that it has MULTIPLE laser sensors instead of the
traditional one.  It will give your a wider *view* and 2-4 times longer
range.  Also, the VAL1 metal case assists with electronic interference.

Subject: 914 speedo....thanks 

Hello,

Now that we finally have a way to get to our mail, we were pleasantly
surprised to see the number of people calculating the error in my speedo
in my 914.   Also, we had a good laugh at all the different answers
that were received :)   (some things just get to you when you are in the
middle of dead weak)  So, thanks to all who had the numbers to put into
the equations.

If anyone is really still interested in playing with math, current
problem is how to describe (without calculus) why a hula hoop rolling
down a hill does not fall over.  (Yes, interesing parallels to the
axles on a car.)

I recently pulled the motor from my 931 (different engine, different

I had the hoist (cherry picker) and chains on the engine when I did mine.
Just enough lift to stress the chains.  Saw no evidence of the engine trying
to tip forward.

Either you drop the engine enough to disengage the mounts and then slide it
forward to disengage the torque tube, -or- you drop the tranny slightly (after
removing the half-shafts) and slide it back.  You need 4-5" of room to get
the driveshaft to disengage.

The latter is recommended in my Haynes manual (for 924's), -BUT- when I tried
it, there was not enough clearance to disengage the torque tube.  If I'd
proceeded on that tack, I would have had to remove the tranny completely.

Instead, I removed the the radiator and AC condenser to make enough room in
front of the engine, and slightly loosened the tranny mount bolts to get a
little freedom at the torque-tube -- bellhousing joint.  With that done,
the thing came out very easily, with the belhousing, turbo, etc. still on the
engine.

....Don't know anything about putting it back in yet....

Subject: RE: water in the door

Gail,

Usually the doors are well drained; if there were enough water in the
door to wet the window, you would hear it sloshing around, and the
door would be noticably heavier.

Often the inner window wiper felt on the sill will become soaked, and
will wet the window any time the window moves up or down.  Solution:
make sure your outer window seal is good, and let the inner one air
dry for a day or so (just park in a dry place).  Also note that if the
car is garaged with the window down in the door, it will not dry
overnight because there isn't enough air circulation in there.

Several people have asked that I post the 911 VIN definitions
as reported by Bruce Anderson in the 2/91 issue of Excellence. 
So here it is.  He didn't report VINs for other models.  Sorry.

In 1981 there was a significant, international change in the
VIN numbering.  It uses 17 digits:

123-456-78-9-10-11-12-13-14 15 16 17

123 = the world mfg code.  Porsche's is WPO
456 = the VDS code for the USA and Canada
          two letters, one digit
          4 = series
                A = 911 coupe
                E = targa cabriolet or speedster
                J = turbo coupe
          5 = engine
                A = Canada
                B = USA
          6 = type of restraint
                0 = active
                1 = passive
          456 = ZZZ for the rest of the world
78  = Porsche model type
         91 = 911
         93 = 930
         95 = 959
9    = "test digit"
10  = model year where
         81 = B
         82 = C, etc.
11  = Mfg location
         S = Stuttgart
12  = 3rd digit of the Porsche model type
         1 = 911
         0 = 930
         9 = 959
13  = Code for the body type & engine
        (not further explained, but I've seen...)
         7 = speedster, cabriolet
         0,2,5 = coupe
         6 = targa
         1 = 964 body coupe (but I've seen a C4 with a "5"?)
         no distinction for turbo body that I can see
14 15 16 17 = sequential serial nos.

Can anyone provide more information for the 13th digit? 
Are there further definitions he omitted?

Subject: Omar's Feat (Feet?)


     To elaborate on the "both feet in" and "both feet out" approach to 
driving and life in general, I add the following.  The idea behind "When in 
doubt, both feet out" is that if/when you get loose in a corner and your 
tail is telling you that it's going to come around if you don't do something 
real quick, nailing the throttle (or some approximation thereof), will 
transfer weight (OK, I know the weight doesn't actually transfer, but you 
know what I mean) towards the rear of the car, thereby increasing the load 
on the rear suspension and tires and thus increasing grip at that end, which 
in turn (hopefully) keeps the back in back and the front in front (Holy run 
on sentences Batman!).  It should be noted however, that this works best 
with a little opposite lock and a gear that will give you enough oomph to 
get the job done.  It is also tricky in a turbo, where the lag can easily 
catch you out.  Another factor is what happens to the suspension geometry 
while all of this is going on, something that will obviously vary with the 
car.  Personally, I find it easy to extend this philosophy to driving in 
general, if only because it's generally much easier to decelerate than it is 
to accelerate.
     The main motivation of "In a spin, both feet in" is to, once you've 
lost the car, jam the brakes in order to try to minimize the chance bouncing 
off the Armco (or some other solid but not necessarily fixed object) and to 
put the clutch in so you can hopefully keep the motor running and undamaged, 
so that you can rejoin the fray as soon as possible.
     At any rate, I'd like to commend Omar for keeping his wits about him, I 
don't even want to think about what either of the vehicles in question would 
do to a 356.  Ouch!!!

Most experts agree: there is a difference between spinning and braking.

Unless I am also shifting, I would normally brake with the clutch 
out (in gear).

In a spin, I usually get the clutch in about the time I go past 50
degrees.  Yes, you do *not* want to turn the engine backwards, 
which is quite likely to happen if you do not get the clutch in 
when the car is rolling backwards.

On the other hand, I don't put it in too soon because when my car 
(a 911) gets loose, I've got the throttle **all the way down**
trying to get it to recover.

I'll get back on my soapbox now and encourage **each and every 
one of you** to auto-x at the next possible opportunity!

You can drive harder and closer to the edge at an auto-x than
anywhere else.  It is a great time to learn how your car drives
at the limit.  You also learn how little it takes to go from
in control to out of control when you are at the edge.  I think
this tends to make auto-xer's safer street drivers.

For those in the SF bay area, the last two events of the year are
12/18 & 12/19 at Pleasanton Fairgrounds.

East on Bernal from 680, left at the light, right into the 
fairgrounds.  Be there around 7:30.  Cost: $15 (plus $20-$50

From my limited experience, I agree with this.  About 6 years ago I was in
my 914 going between NY and PA.  I was behind a gigantic "land yacht".
NY tends to salt in winter much more than PA, so the very first bridge in PA,
the land yacht moved it's back end a bit because the bridge was icy.  I
immediately jammed the clutch in on the belief that my rear wheels would spin
and I would fishtail.  Well, with the clutch in I fishtailed anyway.  Maybe
the sudden change did it.

"In a Spin, Both Feet In" is something we try to drive into folks starting
with their first event for the reasons already stated.  Far to many people
try to save it and end up doing far more damage than had they come to a
controlled stop.  It is very important that folks understand this is used
after the spin starts or during off track visits, not when they 'think' they
are about to spin because they are 'going to fast' for the corner.
  Saw that happened at an independent Bridgehampton event (non PCA) where I
was running flagging and 'chief instructor'.  An "instructor" explained
this method for car control to his 911 student.  Gee, guess what happened
the first time he tried it.  There was no damage done, except perhaps to the
pants of driver. I removed the instructor after a short talk convinced me
that he had more great tips.  Later I found that what he told us was true -
he WAS an instructor in his region, just didn't realize the importance of
was - as in past tense, for similar innovative teachings.

   The proposal is now to meet for dinner at 7:00 PM on Saturday, 12/11,
   at Sports City in Cupertino.

OK, I have made a reservation for Saturday at 7:00 PM.

Sports City is located at the junction of I-280 and Saratoga-Sunnyvale
Rd.  It is a fun place with good food, owned by several ex-49ers.

Directions:
Take 280 to the Saratoga-Sunnyvale exit (the first exit after
Highway 85 joins 280 if you are coming from the north, the last exit
before 85 if you are coming from the south).  Turn south on
Saratoga-Sunnyvale.  The restarant is immediately south of 280, so you
can see it clearly on the right side of S-S Rd. as you turn on to it.

However, the driveway entrance is completely non-obvious.  You have to
drive past the restaurant and turn right on the first little street
(name unknown, but there is a gas station on the corner).  Follow that
street as it makes a little S curve and turn right into the 2nd
driveway (I think).  There used to be a little sign saying
"restaurant" but I haven't noticed lately if it is there.  This sounds
sort of complicated, but it isn't really; you are basically trying to
make your way to the back of the building you saw from S-S Rd. 'cause
that's where they keep the parking lot.

The reservation is in the name of York.

Please RSVP by e-mail or give me a call so I can verify the head

I've not seen this, but it sounds like a DME (or connection) problem,

P Neters,
To add another few pennies to the brake fluid discussion, 
I saw at the track this past season someone connecting 
their air bottle to the overflow tube on the master 
cylinder to pressurize the M/Cyl.  I would guess this 
might be a pressure regulation problem?  
Has anyone else played with this idea?  It sure looked 
like an easy way to do it quick.

things don't work out, I've kept the names of those who responded and will
let you know if it becomes available again.  Thanks for your responses!

Now, for the meat of this post.  I seem to remember somebody asking about

Certainly - the fact that your message goes out to the list
indicates that you sent it to a real address, and that address (the
porchephiles mailing list) recieved it and processed it. The fact that
you got barfmail in return as well indicates that part of the processing
involved sending your mail to one or more invalid addresses. This is
a function of bad, invalid, host down, etc. addresses being on the list.

Subject: '87 944 having start problems

Hello, fellow Porsche enthusiasts :

In the past 2 months, I've been experiencing intermittent starting problems
with my '87 944 (65k miles).

When the problem occurs (always at the wrong time, of course), the engine
would crank, but it just wouldn't start.   But, the strange thing is, when
this happens, I'd walk away from it (get a cup of coffee or something) for
about 15 minutes, try starting it again, and it would start just fine.  8-|

I've done the following, but don't know if I've fixed the problem or
not (because the problem is intermittent).  Can anyone comment on this 
problem or is anyone having the same problem on his/her 944 ?  Thanks in 
advance.

- ---
. Changed the battery (because it was drained by my alarm being on for 2 wks
  continuously)
. Changed the distributor cap and rotor.

- ---
. I have not checked if there's any spark when the problem occurs, because
  it always goes away after my 15-min coffee break.
. I have not checked the fuel pump.

I'm reserving my opinion of the 993 until it hits the states.  

Somehow I'll bet it manages to put on a few more pounds (weight,
that is) and will ride 3 inches higher thanks to our bureaucratic
friends at the D-O-T :-(.  


European Car had a pretty good article on the car with some diagrams 

of the new front/rear suspension layouts.  Interesting reading, and
they didn't even have someone trying to bolt-on an Weltmeister sway

Well I can assure you that Porsche do make right hand drive models
for the UK and other right hand drive markets. Although many things
get re-worked for the right hand drive market some don't, like
windscreen wipers for instance, which park on the left.

I think that the offset of the 911 drivers position used to be more 
pronounced in rhd models as well. I don't think that this is the case 
anymore.

The encoding details are different for different models, although the
overall structure is more or less the same for '81 forward.  Before then,
its structure varied a lot from year to year.

Best sources for this sort of infp are the PCNA Fact Books and Brett

In case it isn't obvious to everyone, you don't attach pressure to the
brake master cylinder cover, cap, or overflow.  You attach it to the
brake fluid reservoir cover/cap or overflow.  The master cylinder is
not something you should be playing with when doing a routine brake
bleeding.

Subject: Electronic PCA Region


I have felt in the past that this would be a good idea.  Like several
others on the list I'm pretty active in Zone 1 and in my local region
(also a newsletter editor and board member).  The main reason I would
like to see this is as a way to fund putting a little more order to
this list.  Right now, the free-form nature of it means that some
people (like, for example, me) can not afford the time it takes to
read 30 messages a day from this list in addition to the 100+ mail
messages per day I get that are professionally related.  My case is a
little extreme, to be sure, but I have heard comments from numerous
people that the volume here is too high, and while there is very
little of the usual open-fourm email bickering, the typical reader is
only interested in maybe three or four of the daily thirty.  

Imagine if the list were broken into some logical sub-parts, like
technical, racing, novice stuff, "give me advice on buying a new car",
etc.  

Another big *problem* with the way the list is run (by necessity) now,
is the fact that people who don't know very much can easily be fooled.
You can be anyone via Internet.  Hence my "Hans Stuck" message last
month.  And if you don't know better, you don't have *any* basis upon
which to decide who to believe when multiple people post responses to
questions.  Take, e.g., the recent "two feet down" discussion.  At
least half the people who participated didn't know what they were
talking about, yet their posts sounded very authoritative.  How would
a newcomer or novice know the difference?  I have frequently seen
absolutely false technical advice being offered through this medium,
and absolutely false high-speed driving tips.  I hope no one was
injured and even more I hope no cars were damaged as a result of this
bogus advice.  

Imagine if the list had officers, the way national and the big regions
do.  People in charge of 944 technical advice, 911 technical advice,
new car questions, restoration, performance modifications, etc.

A cyberegion can have events.  The National PCA does.

I think there are several other advantages and reasons for a
cyberegion.

These kinds of organizational changes don't necessarily require PCA,
but I believe they require some funding.  It requires more
computational resources than it is reasonable to expect from a
volunteer, and I think to kick off something like this would require
several face2face meetings, and with funding we could bring the people
from aroudn the country to a single place.  And of course, people who
dont want to participate can still use the unorganized list.

This year's parade is at Lake Placid,in my region (Hudson-Champlain).
I think it would be a good idea to have a cyberegion BOF (birds of a
feather) there this year.  I will arrange it and announce it.

Subject: laser and radar jamming.

Porsche People.

The following is summarised from the Nov 93 issue of car and driver.
Anything in [] is something that I have put in.

             How to beat Laser and Radar Guns.


As found out in furst laser-detector test ( dec 92 ), laser detectors did not
provide much of a defence agains lidar.  They all detected lidar, but
the warning came at the moment that the vehicle had been clocked.  No
advance warning.  The laser beam is very narow - about 4 feet wide at 
100 feet.  With proper aim, a cop equipped with a LTI20-20 [ one
of two guns that C/D had used in the test, with the other being the
Kustom Signals Prolaser.  I dont know if these are the only two out 
there, or the only two that C/D had. ] can clock a car a half-mile 
away in about a third of a second.  

Larry Wilson of Texas sent his "Blackbird" which, when used with the
windscreen mount, had no effect on the gun.  When mounted on the grille,
it did work, but only if the gun was also aimed at the grille.  If the
beam was aimed elsewhere, there was no effect.  The Blackbird also did
not look very waterproof and at $199, C/D was unable to recommend it,
although they did say that it showed promise.

We then considered a differnt approach, turning on ordinary driving lights
on the guns.  Driving lights also spew infra-red as well as visible light.

A Bosch 8" off road driving light was mounted on the nose of the test
car, as well as turning on the high beams, and the effect was astounding.

When use together, the range of the ProLaser was reduced by 60%.  The 
range of the LTI20-20 was reduced by 90%.  

Readers should note that the reduction mostly took place at a distance
well beyond that at which the cops pull the trigger, though the
significant 0-1000' range is also affected.

[the data in the table below is from a bar graph, and as such the numbers
are not to be considered 100% accurate.
p= with front plate,
np= without front plate.]

                       Prolaser                   LTI20-20
                          p       np             p       np
Lights off               725      575          3100     2200
Low beams                700      575          2400     1600
High Beams               280      210           750      500
Single Driving light     285      200           600      400
All Lights.              275        0!!!        400      220 


In order to keep from blinding each other, use an IR filter that screens
all but IR light and the same effect will be achieved, whicle not
having the appearance of having the lights on.  With these measures,
AND a laser detecter, the chances of evading a ticket are much improved.  
The detector would sound an alarm which would give the driver time to 
slow down which the cop was trying to get a reading.

The pencil type ligts are the best, the more the better, preferable
filtered.  Do not forget the back of the car.

[ my suggestion.  mount extra lights all around, with filters, and
keep them on all the time. ]


                  Radar Jammers

Unlike light, a license is needed to emit any type of radio waves,
which are tightly controlled by the FCC, and as such are illegal.

The Mirage 2200, Eclipse, Spirit, Black Blox and Spectre "jammers"
are for entertainment purposes only.

The other one test was different. The Stealth Vehicle Radar Cloaking 
Device, sold by stealth technologies of Naperville Illinois.

The Stealth is larger and heavier than the first Escort produced
16 years ago.

The stealth only addresses X and K band radar.  It works by
producing a steady amplitude signal that scans about 1/3 of the
band near the center of both bands.  ( police radar is almost
alway tuned to the center of the band ).  When the Stealth finds
a steady-frequency signal it stops scanning, and emits a signal
of the same type as that detected.

During instant on tests, the Stealth was effective at 1000' 
rendering the K band gun harmless.  At 500', it could not react quickly
enough half of the time.  In the X-band it was less effective, but
more consistent.  At $600, it is no bargain, and is about as
sensitive as the original Escort.  

[  The rest of the article goes on to discuss the legalities of the
Stealth, which I left out because at the time of pulication, there
were no laws to deal with this specific case ]

              Foiling Photo Radar.

A simple solution if the Chimera, which is a filter mounted over the 
plate, which makes it look black at angle of 22 degrees or more,
which means that the plate in the photo would be illegible and
therefore you would get no ticket.  However it costs $94 and makes
the plate look smoky.  Which means that you may get pulled over anyway.

Hi everyone,

I heard the following in the news (while not paying good attention).
Porsche has recalled late 911s (1992?) for problems with the "rear"
heaters (whatever that is) and a defective valve which might cause
the brakes to lock-up.  Call your local dealer for an accurate
description of the problem.  As I said, I was not paying good
attention.

Subject: Re: Electronic PCA Region

I think a face to face gathering would bring forth some important
discussion, and maybe some ways to "make progress". I'm planning on
being at Parade, and would encourage anyone else who is there to 
come to the BOF. 

BTW, we *will* have to explain "BOF" to the regular PCA types -- I tried 
to organize a BOF at another non-computer conference, and was rather stiffly 
informed by the program chair that he really didn't care *what* I managed to 
talk other attendees into doing, but I wasn't going to advertise it so 
blatantly....

Humor aside, Chris is right on -- there are a few key issues, most of which
could be solved by funding: First issue, facilitating a more "moderated" feel 
in terms of tech Q & A type stuff -- I mean, in Pano, the answers come from 
the "experts", right? So one of the more valuable things in *THIS* forum is 
the fact that it's about gaining strength through shared experience. Which is
fine until the experiences shared impart incorrect or incomplete information
which is potentially damaging... 

Second big issue: making sure you get all the info that you *really* want 
and NONE of the info that you don't want. We're all busy, and wading through 
63 notes on 944 brakes for that one note on 356 heater adjustment gets a 
little old sometimes. Fixing this is *doable*, just not very easily given 
how I'm currently distributing notes...

And there are other issues -- "newbie" orientation is getting important as 
more and more people who haven't been using e-mail and the Internet for the 
last N years start accessing us via America On Line or new startup local 
access shops or in some cases, bulletin board systems with mail access. 

It's also pretty urgent to allow the group to continue to grow beyond 1000
members, which is roughly where I think the current system will toss it's
cookies...  And with that goes this other issue: is it *GOOD* to get more
people on-line, or not? You decide -- traffic is up about 400% since
this time last year, on a 200% membership increase...

Anyway, it's good to see that there's good support for an Electronic
Frontier region of the PCA (I do *so* dislike "cyberX", for most X,
as a description of this sort of thing...) Let's press on! If you're *REALLY*
interested in *WORKING* on this sort of thing, drop me a note, and I'll
set up a new mailing list just for this purpose. I'm gonna keep it small
on purpose, so you'll need to be willing to contribute and able to convince
me you mean it... (sorry, Welty, you're already on it -- you don't get off
that easy!)

Subject: Re: 911 recall

I don't think th valve causes the brakes to lock-up, its more
that the Carerra 4 cars have a high pressure pump for the brake
boost, and it is controlled by a relay.  The relay can fail, causing the
pump to run all the time, an shortly thereafter, fail.  Its a pretty penny
to replace as well.

One of the reasons I didn't buy that Carerra 4...

	Nope, I'm sure there are plenty of us in that position. I suspect
that the best way around it is to make sure that people use sensible
"Subject:" lines - it's not too difficult then to delete those messages
which you don't want to read.

	This low noise-to-signal ratio is the main reason why I can take
the high volume of mail on this list.

	Is there really enough volume to support this. I know that the
rec.autos.* Usenet hierarchy is arranged this way, but I don't believe
that porschephiles could sustain it. And would I have to keep subscribing
and unsubscribing from the various lists as my interests change (e.g. this
month I might want to know whether to go for a 911 or a 968. Next month I
might want to know how to change an engine mount on a 968. Etc.). And
would Stan be happy with all those extra subscription/unsubscriptions!? :-)

	People who use Internet should be aware that messages have no more
meaning than a pub conversation. Over time you get to know who really
knows what they are talking about (the Kevin Gross's and Stan Hank's) and
who doesn't.

> And if you don't know better, you don't have *any* basis upon which to

	Hmmm. You can look for logical answers. You can look for a
consensus of opinion. You can listen to people who have a track record of
answering questions sensibly. Or you could even (shock, horror) go and
look the answer up in a book if you really need to resolve conflicting
answers.

	I can't believe that you said this. Much and all as I love cars
(and P-cars in particular), human safety must come first.

	Yes, just imagine! All that beauracracy. All that in-fighting. All
those fees. You can't join if you don't owen a Porsche. Etc.

Voluntarily.

	How about those of us outside the USA. Don't you realize how
important it is that porschephiles is *worldwide* and not just confined to
one country? I *hate* this Americanocentric attitude!

Philip

P.S. I'd just like to put on record my appreciation to Stan for all the
work which he does to keep this list going. I don't think he gets thanked
often enough!

Well, saw it about 4/5 weeks ago at the Swiss release (in Bern anyway), didn't

The 993 I saw seemed fairly low, a bit longer at the back which I like becuase the
C2/4 looks *much* too dumpy for me - the 993 seeming lower, longer slimmer etc. I
suppose it is heavier though, not that it looked it. The C2 is about 1000 Kg 
heavier than an early 911!

Subject: 993


Ok, I arrived at the dealer to get my drive in a 993, only
to find that the `test drive' they were offering was in
the passenger seat, ie strictly hands off the pcar controls.
However, the driver for the `test drive' was Robin Donovan who
I understand is a Le Mans race car driver (anyone heard of him?) 
Given that at the time it was pouring with rain, pitch dark and 5
degrees C I though that we would be taking it easy. I was wrong.

I can say that we went very, very fast over some very wet
roads. The thing that stands out from my `test drive' is that
this new pcar has supreme agility, amazingly neutral handling,
and great resistance to slip and slide even in the wet. I know
the road we covered fairly well, given the same treatment
my 911 3.2 would have been flying through the hedge backwards
on many occasions.

The car was exceptionally quiet for a 911 from the point of
view of rumble and thump from the tyres and supension. While
it retains the intense feeling of solidity characteristic of the
911, it no longer thumps and crashes when encountering a few ripples
in the road surface.

The the engine sound is enhanced to a deep bark, much of the
shrill and whining engine noise is gone (may be something to
do with the lightened engine internals) what remains is a deep
throated rumble.

I really liked this car, the brakes and acceleration were outstanding
in the wet. I understand that in the dry it does 0-125-0 in around
25 seconds, 20 seconds of that is acceleration. I got the
impressions that wet weather would not have much impact on these time
either.

I am now pestering the dealer to drive it rather than be driven.
I can't understand why they don't let the customers get their hands
on the hardware as soon as a new model is released. Maybe
they are afraid of a customer writing off the only demo car
they are likely to get until spring....

Subject: electronic region and/or porschephiles

Porschephiles as it stands suits me pretty well.  People who quote two screen-
fuls and add a one-line comment, people who don't indicate a clear or at least
an amusing subject, and people who cover two disparate subjects in one item
are my only complaints.  I prefer the current structure to a "referreed jour-
nal" approach with only designated experts tapped for their opinions.  My own
experience isn't deep enough to be on anybody's list of experts -- but I know
what I had success with this past weekend, and I suspect that (perhaps rarely)
that success may be of interest to others, especially others with similarly
limited Porsche budgets.

So if I get to vote (in a benevolent Stanocracy) I vote to leave Porschephiles
alone, whatever other new organizations may be built.  And in answer to the
inevitable question - yes, I would be willing to pay some modest annual fee for
continued access to Porschephiloid services.

From: STEVE.STOMSKI@gsa2.sprint.com
Subject: Negative vote on PCA electronic region

   With all the traffic over the past few weeks on an electronic
    region for P-philes in PCA I now vote in on the side of Philip
    (i.e., against the merger).  I certainly see merit in both views,
    but bringing P-philes in under the auspices of PCA would not be
    the greatest thing for our electronic grassroots organization.  I
    maintain that the beauty of the P-philes is, at least in part, the
    lack of structure and the wide ranging (albiet sometimes
    inaccruate) voices.  I feel that a committee/sub-part
    approach will lead to a lack of timely response (with the
    committee memebers- like Bruce Anderson- deciding what subjects to
    respond to when, and only after determining if it is of interest
    to a substantial segment of the readership and after having
    weighed all options, views, legal ramifications, PCNA postion,
    PCA's position, Pano's (or Excellence's) position (as well as
    their advertisers).  Also, many postings are not narrowly
    structered, but are eclectic, and as such if a response to "how to
    bleed 356 brakes" is posted only under the 356 subpart, then all
    of us non-356 folks will be at a loss.

    As far as inaccurate responses go, well I am
    a big boy now and if I can't figure out that driving fast on
    public roads is a stupid unecessary risk then all the bull on this
    forum will not save me, my car, my license, nor, more
    importanlty, some unfortunate bystander on that public raod.
    Moreover, if my inexperience leads to my being fooled, Hans, then
    I guess the doctrine of caveat emptor has some limited relevance
    next time I try to remove a half shalf with a sledge hammer.
    (Sorry Stan, but I disagree that we should take a "Pano" approach
    to this forum and limit responses only to "experts."  We are all
    experts at least in some small way and to eliminate this wealth of
    worldly experience to defer only to Bruce Anderson's learned
    knowledge
    (for example) would destroy the virtue of this forum.)   My
    point is that I would rather have a breadth of responses to a
    posting that I can sift through as accurate or inaccurate
    (and have a chance to read through the subject lines to filter
    out what *I* believe is trash) than have a committee member censor
    and categorize what and how and when I read.

    Notwithstanding the above, I do recognize some limitations of
    P-Philes and empathize with Stan. I do not, however, maintain that
    PCA is the answer to these problems.  (To set the record straight,
    I am a member of PCA and think it is a fine organization for its
    purpose, which, I believe, is different than P- 
    philes purpose.)

    On the subject of the growth of this group I would suggest that at
    some point membership should level out (people with access to
    Internet as a subset of those interested in Porsches is clearly a
    finite number), but I have not a clue as to the ultimate size.  If
    funding is a problem, I would prefer a membership fee distinct of
    any PCA fee to finance the expansion/maintenance of the group.

    If any of the members of this group have read this far but have
    not found anything of import then all I can say is: WHAT IS YOUR
    PROBLEM?  I too am a busy person and get numerous E-mails in
    additon to P-philes postings that need attention.  If I am too
    busy to read a posting from P-philes (or otherwise) or have had
    enough of a particular thread, I either just glance over it or
    don't read it at all.  If some members are so anal that they feel
    it necessary to read each and every message (from 911 racing
    technology to color schemes for the underwear of 914 drivers)
    then I have no sympathy for you and suggest that you exercise a
    little more discretion with you time (after all, we are not
    wasting paper if we don't read an E-Mail).

Hmmmm. Checking my 72-73 911T,E,S Technical Specifications...

Empty weight (DIN)   911T    911E    911S
                    1050kg  1075kg  1075kg (on Earth ~2370lbs)


So... 1075kg + 1000kg = 2075kg = ~4575lbs. I think that everyone will
agree that the C2 doesn't weigh that much. I don't have the exact number,
but I was under the impression that the C2 weighed in at about 3000lbs, 
which is about 800lbs more than the early 911's. Kevin H., maybe you meant
lbs instead of kg?

C) Flush the brake system again. It was done 2 years ago (20K miles).

Not that I would *ever* recommend anything that held the appearance
of illegality or anything, but I have heard that you can spray a gloss

Subject: RE: 951 with the hiccups.

You don't mention if you've got an after market chip installed.  I've 
seen several cars with a related problem at track events.  These cars 
come off the track and idle up and down in a cycle (following a sine 
wave).  The cause is a software problem.  Basically those chips have 
maps in them that relate the various inputs (RPM, Mass Air Flow) and 
provide ignition timing or fuel timing information.  If the values are 
bad in the fringe areas (that normally you would never see) you can 
have problems.  What happens is your computer hiccups due to a power 
surge or just the very quick input change which results in invalid 
input conditions which in turn results in your computer reading from a 
section of the map that it shouldn't.  It then gets stuck in this 
unstable area.  Shutting the system off (i.e. turning off the ignition) 
would reset the computer and thus the problem goes away.

The times I've seen this someone said the problem can be corrected 
somehow but I can't recall what was said.

If you don't have a new chip then I'd go ahead and check the inputs the 
computer is getting.  Of course you'd have to know what they should be 
and I'm not familiar enough with my 944 to tell you, yet.

Subject: Re: 911 brake fluid replacement

I do this, but just use a bicycle hand pump with an in line air filter.
It just takes a couple of pounds (once you clamp the overflow line on
the master cylinder) and with a long enough hose from the
pump, you can stand by the wheel you are bleeding as well as walk back
to look at the master cylinder.  Its fast and easy and works much
better than a vacuum pump.

Hmmm?  The accelerator should be lower than the brake for two reasons:
(1) Safety.  When you're hitting the brake, you don't want to also get the
	throttle at the same time accidently.

(2) For proper heel-and-toe technique.  If the pedals start at the same
	height, then when you push the brake how will you get your foot
	onto the throttle so you can match revs?

I just can't imagine wanting both pedals to be at the same height...

If there is a vote of some sort, I vote with the leave the list as

moderator and becomes too large to read efficiently (for those of us
getting the digest).

I suppose it would be nice to get some informal recognition from
PCA, but formal recognition as a region is probably not worth the
paperwork and could lead to a loss of independence.

On the more porsche related news, it is good to see that porsche is
trying to remain competitive by pricing the 993 at $5K LESS than
this year's model (just under $60K list).

There are two new recalls for 964's , one to replpace the
ballast resitor in the plastic pipe that comes down from the engine
mounted heater assist blower. The new resitor has a cicuit breaker to
protect against electrical fires that have happened after A-bahn trips
of long durration.

The second is for a new brake pressure reduction valve (rear brakes)
a hydraulic problem will allow rear brakes to lock up(with loss of
control) even with ABS regulation..

The first recall involves all 964's and the second involves far fewer
selected  cars, all owners will be notified so make sure you have sent
in those change of address/ownership cards from the warranty book or
contact your local dealer , but as of Monday they probably have not

Sorry to waste the bandwidth, but this one's really got me

on a Porsche or other car.

Please answer directly to avoid annoying others on the list.

My Mazda MPV has serious acceleration problems only when warm.
It feels like it's running on 2 cylinders with ANY load. If
I disconnect the harness to the water temp. sensor, it works
ok. The sensor checks out ok, and I even replaced it just to
be sure. As soon as I reconnect the wiring harness to the sensor
with the engine warm, the symptoms return. If I leave it off, the
car starts very hard when cold.

Any ideas? oxygen sensor?

Subject: electronic PCA region


I don't think there is any need for any voting.  If we were to break
this list into sub-parts, those who like the current structure can
just subsribe to all the parts, that's all.  What's the point of
objecting to organization?  Nothing will be going away, the only
difference would be that certain of us would benefit by not having to
read this many messages - and, mark my words, it's going to get MUCH
worse.  

IF YOU ARE GOING TO RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE, READ ALL OF IT.  Prolly
your response is dealt with below.  I'm NOT proposing anything that
radical...jeez.  Let's move the discussion over to the new list,
e-region@tta.com, so that we don't clutter this one even more *sigh*

Also, I am already sensing a prelude to flaming here.  Don't go off on
me because you disagree with something, just disagree and say why.

Let me respond to a few points:

> "just using meaningful subject lines makes it easier to delete..."

Ha.  I've been an active person on the usenet and internet for 13
years.  This has never ever ever ever worked.  It doesn't work now (I
have scripts that prune my mail based on subjects and I still get lots
I don't want), and it won't work in the future.

> "this list is like a pub..."

A pub with 600 people?  That doesn't fit my definition of a pub.
(Neither does a pub without beer).  Plus our "pub" has people
streaming in the door every day shouting the same exact questions to
all of us.

600 is large for a mailing list by internet standards, medium sized
for a newsgroup by usenet standards.  And we are growing very rapidly.

> "committees mean lack of a timely answer..."

No, this is not what I'm proposing.  Actually, I haven't really
proposed anything except that there are two problems with this list: a
wealth of inaccurate information and a lot of messages that large
groups of us aren't interested in (like, for example, this thread),
and that some sort of organization might help (and I gave an example
of *an* organizational structure).  Then I mentioned that any such
organization woudl require a little more than just volunteer resources
(remember, we are all getting this list due 100% to Stan's
generosity), and that PCA is a likely source.  It doesn't have to be
PCA.

Further, your comments about the PCA technical committee are
incorrect.  Bruce and those guys respond to *every* tecnical question
they get, and considering the volume they do so pretty rapidly (often
the same day).  It's what you see in Pano and Excellence that is
subjected to all the criteria you mentioned.

Perhaps the PCA tech committee approach is not the best, though based
on past experience with this list I think we'd have enough people on
each committee that someone would respond quickly.

> "a response to `how do I bleed 356 brakes' posted to the 356 sub-part,
   then all non-356 folks will be at a loss"

(What a loss.)  Again, just because the list is divided into sub-parts
doesn't mean you can't subscribe to all of them if you want to.
   
> "I'm a big boy and accept that my inexperience may lead me to be fooled."

I don't think this is an adequate answer.  There is a problem here and
shrugging your shoulders about it is far more likely to mean you're
NOT inexperienced and believe you CAN figure out which advice is right
or wrong for yourself.  Newcomers to this list have no such assurance,
and many have no experience with either the Internet or Porsches to
understand that half of what they read is blatantly false.

> "I don't want someone censoring what I read...."

Not what I proposed.  The main organization structure I mentioned was
to split the list into sub-parts, not to moderate the list.  AGAIN,
You can subscribe to all the sub-parts if you want to.

> "what's the problem, if you're too busy just don't read the p-files mail"

The problem for me is that there is about 5% of the messages that I
would very much like to read.  There is information in them that I
would like to have, but didn't ask for.  Often I do not have time to
sort through the other 95% and so I delete it, losing that info. I
also know I'm not alone in that respect.  The other problem I have is
more altruistic: it bothers me that newcomers have no way to
distinguish the correct from the incorrect information they get, and
as I said above I don't agree they should just accept that.  I feel if
there's a way to help and some of us are willing to, it should be
done.

> "I think my weekend experiences would be of interest to some, though
   I'm not an expert..."

Didn't mean that this would become "censored", just that a sub-group
for this kind of posting would be created so that people who don't
want to read it don't have to - in fact don't even have to decide if
they want to. 

> "just delete the messages you aren't interested in..."

hahahahahahahahahaha.  This requires time.  I'm not alone in often not
even having time to look at the subjects and see if I'm interested
(and that's after my scripts do their magic).  If it's not a problem
for you, JUST SUBSCRIBE TO ALL THE PARTS!

> "I would keep changing subscriptions to the parts as my interests
   change"

Why is this a problem?  If you don't like the idea of having sub-parts
of the list - guess what?  YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO ALL OF THEM.

> "the proposal is americanocentric"

Yes, it is.  I think to get a good organization out of this would
require face2face discussion, email does have it's limits.  You want
us to fly over to the UK for this?  I am merely suggesting a place
that a lot of us will be anyway to start discussing it.  Nothing will
be done to explicitly EXCLUDE anyone.

I think I must agree with the "no" camp.  While a fully-moderated,

Peoples' language gets clogged with mushy-mouthed disclaimers
when some sort of guarantee of correctness is implied.  (It'd make

no longer open.  When I pull the release cable I can hear the latch
release partially pull away, but it feels like some tool has slid down

so I can get the hood up.

This is getting especially frustrating as my new heater tube is sitting

Any of you p-netters have ideas on how I can get the hood latch undone?

What does Porschephiles have to gain by becoming an electronic
region of PCA? It's already a worldwide group with its own
unique character. I really enjoy all the messages from Magnus,
Tron, Malcolm, Ben and others. Porschephiles is as much theirs

If there are members who want to be censors, go to it!, and
create a "Sanitized for Your Protection" digest for those who
can't sort out good from bad advice on their own - but don't
edit the mail for the rest of us.

I agree with the idea of some level of *voluntary* support for
Stan, if for no other reason, then to support the growth rate
of Porschephiles without a degradation of service.

  This topic came up at our local PCA region's awards banquet.  The 

owners of both Porsche dealerships were there fielding some general
questions about the 993 and Boxter.  In answering the question about
the 993 RS version, there has been some apparent work at the factory
to equip a 993 for club racing, but no official plans have been stated
regarding an RS model of the 993 for either europe or the US.  They
did say that perhaps one reason for this is that they didn't want to
undercut sales of '94 model 964's and wanted to get most of them sold
prior to announcing any plans for an RS 993 if one were to be built.  

They stated that this is merely speculation, but it makes some sense.

They alluded to some potentially great stuff coming in model year
'96, but would not elaborate.

I would imagine that the viability of an 993-based RS would be 

predicated somewhat by sales of the 964 RS in both european and
American trim.  I haven't seen any unit numbers for the RS
America here in the states so I don't know whether the car
has been much of a success here or not...

Hey Gang,

Several of us have stated problems with the volume of traffic on the list,
heck I remember people dropping due to it (so they said, even tho to the
wrong address)

I have solved most of my volume problem by subscribing to both the "real

subject, I read it.  Otherwise a mass delete, I will save the digest when it
comes.   Then Norton text search works for me.

Stan thought it (read as I) was crazy when I ask him to set me up that way
but it works for my situation.

Truthfully, I am storing a lot of data, but one of the perks of my job is
that I can upgrade at will, engineering evaluation you know. (When I get to
our P5/66 4gb model I'll let you all know)


PS. I have asked my marketing contact about the COMPAQ/911 ad, will post 
when I get it.  My poster is getting framed for my study. 

Also thought it was nice to see the 911 on my Pano cover with a license plate 
that read 928......good cropping.....

Soren wrote (to me):

>to rear.

I think I have to disagree.  At first I was just going to agree, assuming 
that the total force (normal component) exerted on the pavement would be the 
same under braking or acceleration as in a steady state condition with only 
the distribution being different.  That being the case, I could accept the 
term "weight transfer" as a valid term for the phenomenon involved.  But 
that didn't sit well with me, so I thought that I would do some 
calculations.  Now, I don't do a lot of kinematics anymore, but since it was 
the only course in college that I got an "A" in, I figured that I could 
probably do it for a simplified case.  I found the results surprising. 
 Here's what I came up with:

Description of car/conditions (numbers chosen for ease of calculation):

Mass: 900 kg (Weight=9000 N)
Wheelbase:  3 m
Center of Gravity:  1 m above road surface, 1m ahead of rear axle (2 m 
behind front)
Weight Distribution at Rest (f/r, based  on above numbers):  33/66 (300 
kg/600kg - somewhat 911 like)
Acceleration:  -5 m/s/s (i.e., braking at 0.5g)
Velocity:  Irrelevant

Assumptions:

Very rigid chassis/body structure
Very stiff suspension (i.e., no significant travel)
Unsprung weight = 0

Method:  Calculation of torques about an axis directly below the C.G., 
parallel to the road, and perpendicular to the direction of travel.

Results:

Force normal on front axle:  4125 N
Force normal on rear axle:  3750 N
Force normal total = 4125 + 3750 = 7875 N (note that this is less than the 
car's curb weight)

If we shift the C.G forward by 1m, we get the following results:

Force normal on front axle:  8250 N
Force normal on rear axle:  1775 N
Force normal total = 8250 + 1775 = 9925 N (note that this is more than the 
car's curb weight)

If we use the original configuration, but brake at 1g, we get:

Force normal on front axle:  5250 N
Force normal on rear axle:  1500 N
Force normal total = 5250 + 1500 = 6750 N (note that this is less than at 
0.5 g)

If we use the second configuration, but brake at 1g, we get:

Force normal on front axle:  10500 N
Force normal on rear axle:  750 N
Force normal total = 10500 + 750 = 11250 N (note that this is more than at 
0.5 g)

Now assuming that my calculations aren't totally hosed and didn't neglect 
anything major and that my assumptions aren't too outrageous, we can draw 
the following conclusions:

1.  A front weight bias is better for braking (if nothing else).  This is 
interesting (if true) because it conflicts with a statement made in R&T's 
recent 993 test report that attributes the 911's braking prowess to its 
weight distribution.

2.  Braking performance (assuming correct brake bias) increases with the 
level of braking for cars with a front weight bias and decreases for a car 
with rear weight bias.  In other words, with all else being equal, a car 
with front weight bias should be able to outbrake one with rear weight bias.

3.  Since acceleration is basically the reverse of braking, we can see why 
the 911 bites so well and why it is prone to power on understeer.

So getting back to the original issue, I still don't like the term "weight 
transfer" but I will continue to use it for lack of a better one.  If anyone 
would like to dispute my calculations or conclusions, feel free (like you 
guys would ask permission anyway); I'm just an EE, and my understanding of 
vehicle dynamics is somewhat rudimentary.  Later...  JW

1. Accelerate extremely hard, or
2. Go fast, spin the rear around (not too hard in an early 911), and

As a recent member to porschephiles I must say that this discussion
medium has rekindled my interest in Porsches. I've been a member of 
PCA for 15 years and of the 356 Registry for about the same time. 

What I like most about the porschephiles is the fact that it's not
a club thing. Just a bunch of people who enjoy these cars and create
a rapport that is unique and open. I hope we don't change that.

It's entirely possible that a substantial amount of the current PCA membership could join this group and
form some kind of matrix membership. Who needs it???

The PCA is already filling the need to provide us with the official
Stuttgart-approved (or at least PCNA-approved) point of view. Go to
the meetings and get into it if that's what you want. 

In my short time as a member I have come to realize how hard Stan's
job must really be (I can barely keep up with the receiving end). But 
I can tell you that this group prevented me from making a BIG misstake

however, want to learn more about this truly magnificient race car.  Does
anyone know of any suitable books that cover this vehicle in mass quantities?
I'd really like to see some more pictures of it, the ones I took just don't do

Also, while strolling the pits after getting H. Stucks autograph near the
picture of his car in the program, I overheard someone commenting that the
engine in that car was recently reworked and dynoed out at 1400 BHP.  Can
anyone confirm or deny this figure?  Obviously, that is OVER 200 BHP/L, quite anaccomplishment for any engine, especially given its vintage.

Does anyone know approximately how many 911 were at the Historics? I was amazed
and delighted to see them.

One last Historics related question.  I know that the races were taped by Prime
Network and aired sometime around Nov 12 or so, but does anyone know where I
can get a copy of this?  I'm desperate to see the 917 in action on video.

Porsche also makes the claim about the 911 having better weight 
distribution for braking (R&T just printed it in their own words).  
Point is, since you get "weight transfer" towards the front in regular 
braking, then starting with more weight in the back helps even-out the 
normal force on all the tires, so they can stick better.  If all the 
downforce is on the front (i.e., front-drive car in hard braking), the 
rears do almost nothing, and in fact could lock up and spin the car.

Braking with 4 tires is better than braking with 2 tires.  Same thing 
in cornering, and accelerating.

I don't know why, and I don't know whether this is universally true.
I do know that on my wife's '90 Jetta GLI, which has ABS, you cannot
power-bleed the rears with a positive-pressure bleeder.  You can power-
bleed using the ABS pumps, which is how the Bentley tells you to do
it.  It works, but it's a pain in the rump.

Perhaps someone else can explain the reason for this.

Subject: 911 Head Studs

Just through having my '77 Carrera 3 lowered and serviced by the very
nice chaps at Protech (UK). However sadly removing one of the cam
covers has revealed a snapped head stud {8-(. I don't really want to
have this done at the moment, basicly as firstly it is not in itself
too cheap 400 UKP for labour and 30 UKP for the stud, and secondly I
have seen to many flat six motors come out of the car for something
simple like this and then just have their owners bankrupt themselves
with the "Well the clutch is well gone, and so is this cam chain, ooh
just look at the back lash in this, phew needs a valve job mate - not
worth putting it back like this". Anyhow I intend to run it for now
with the missing stud - the head gasket hasn't gone yet. Well now for
the questions.

My guess would be that even if the gasket does go, the worst that will
happen is that the head and the barrel will be eroded by escaping
gases (and this would take a lot of hard miles) so all we are in to a
couple of second hand replacements, any ideas ?

Additionally when I do get the money together to have it done, I
understand that the failure is due to corrosion on this vintage
engine, is it worth having the lot replaced (please say no at this
juncture).

I a fuel system question (for a 77 911S). In attempting to bleed the system
after putting on a new fuel filter, I noticed that the fuel was filling up 
the filter but I did not hear any sound that the fuel was being sent to the 
injectors.  It was my understanding that there should be a noticeable sound 
as the fuel passes thru the system.  Is this a sign of a possible bad mixture
control unit?

When starting (cold) the very first time the engine is turned over it fires
up and idles for a second or two and then dies (even with depressing the gas).
Further attempts to start the engine fail.  After several minutes (of not
trying to start the engine), I can hear a click from the area of the cold start
valve.  If I attempt to start the engine after that, the very first time it
will start up, idle for a second or two and then die (same as above).  Is this
a result of the above mentioned problem (possible bad mixture control unit)?

If I remember correctly from my syspension design days, You have three equations
at you disposal:


1.   7Fx=max    2.   7Fy=may   3.   7M=0

Since we are only interested in the normal forces, we will only need the last 
two equations.  If we denote the contact point between the road and the tire 
directly below the axles as A for the front axle and B for the rear axle we 
have:

eq. 2.  FA + FB = may = mg = (900kg)(10 m/s/s)  where FA and FB are the 
respective normal forces.

eq. 3.  take the moments about point B
         (900kg)(10m/s/s)(1m) + (900kg)(5m/s/s)(1m) - FA(3m) = 0
           gravity force        acceleration force

FA={(900)(10)(1)+(900)(5)(1)} N m = 4500N
    -------------------------
             3 m

FB = (9000N) - FA = 4500N

Force normal on front axle: 4500N
Force normal on rear axle : 4500N

The sum of the normal forces must always equal the curb weight with the above 
assumtions and no other external influences.

If we shift the CG forward by 1m:
Force normal on front axle: 7500N
Force normal on rear axle : 1500N

if we use the original configuration, but brake at 1g, we get:
Force normal on front axle: 6000N
Force normal on rear axle : 3000N

if we use the second configuraton, but brake at 1g:
Force normal on front axle: 6000N
Force normal on rear axle : 3000N



As for the conclusions:
1.  The coef. of friction for a tire decreases as normal force increase. 
Therefore, for optimum braking performance you would want 50/50 normal force 
distribution at the max braking braking force.  If you start out with more 
weight on the rear under static conditions, you are more ballanced under braking
conditions and have more available grip.

I got the lastest Pano yesterday, and they had a feature
article on (what else?) the 993.  It turns out that the
car is 3" wider than the C2, with only a 0.01 increase
in the coefficient of drag (0.32 ->0.33), and is only
33 pounds heavier than the C2.
    I don't know if this was in US trim, Euro trim, or what.
The article did not specify (that I recall), but I did get the

I think that your calculations are hosed. The assumption that the braking
force can be modeled as a horizontal force one meter below the CG is the
problem; you have to apply the braking force at the front and rear wheel
contact points instead. It clearly makes a difference - think about a
bicycle with front and rear brakes. The front ones can tip you over the
handlebars, but the rear ones cannot, so clearly they act differently
on the CG. Also the idea that applying a horizontal force makes the car
"lighter" or "heavier" is a little too counter-intuitive for me to take.
If you start drawing vectors applied at the wheels the picture gets more
complicated quickly, but you will probably find that the sum of the forces
at the front and rear (vertical) are just sufficient to support the weight
of the car.

Subject: 911 Head Studs


  My guess would be that even if the gasket does go, the worst that will
  happen is that the head and the barrel will be eroded by escaping
  gases (and this would take a lot of hard miles) so all we are in to a
  couple of second hand replacements, any ideas ?

You can probably drive around with the leaky cylinder for quite a
while, but as soon as you start hammering on it, running that cylinder
lean under heavy load and you might break a valve depending upon how
severe the leak is. Do you feel lucky?

  Additionally when I do get the money together to have it done, I
  understand that the failure is due to corrosion on this vintage
  engine, is it worth having the lot replaced (please say no at this
  juncture).

Yes you should fix all of the studs at the same time. And install
Dilivar studs in the lower bank while your at it and "Timesert" the
case to protest against future head stud pulling episodes. The
magnesium 2.7 (or 3.0 in your case) has gotten a bad rap for head stud
pulling but once you fix it right it will be very reliable. The
aluminum 3.0 SC engines pull head studs like crazy also, they are not
immune despite popular belief.

$80 for a battery?
This message contains one question, and a lot of bitching.  If
you don't want to hear the bitching, please read no further.

I dragged my 914 into the shop yesterday after giving up on
my latest set of fuel system woes.  In the time the car had been
sitting, the battery had died for good.  Now the shop wants to
charge me $80 for a replacement battery (plus labor!).  The
battery is warrantied for 3 years.  Now, I know that I can get
a battery with *twice* the warranty for *half* the price.  I
can get a different battery with a lesser warranty (4 or 5 yr)
for even less than that.

Question:  Is this unreasonable?  Should I try to argue the price
down, or go buy the cheaper battery (while the car is at his
shop)?  Should I just eat the cost to maintain a relationship
with one of the better mechanics I've found?

Arrgh!  Advice is appreciated.  Flames are (probably) deserved.

Subject: RE: 911 Head Studs


In regards to Steve Chapmans Head stud question,  I too had to deal with this
situation this year.  I have a '78 SC which I autocross and back in January, it
started making a sort of "whistling" sound under fairly hard acceleration.  I
figured it was just a leak in the exhaust system.  At about the same time, my
enging mounted oil cooler sprung a leak.

I took the car in to my mechanic to fix the oil cooler and while they were
working on it, they found a broken head stud.  It was not nice to find this
after the cost of the oil cooler and I just couldn't afford to get it fixed
right away.  In talking to my mechanic (he used to be on the Bayside Porsche
racing team), he told me that I could drive it for a few months before I got it
fixed IF I, "babied the throttle and NO, ABSOLUTELY NO AUTOCROSSING".  He too
stated that the escaping gases could erode the head and cylinder causing much
more damage.

So, that is what I did.  I was planning a two month trip from mid-may to
mid-july so I drove real "light" (That was extremely hard for me) from January
to May with no apparent problems.  My engine now runs as good or better than
ever so I don't think I eroded any thing.

Now for the only catch.  I chose to replace ALL of the head studs on the
recommendation of my mechanic.  The reasoning here is that if you have to pull
things apart for one, then you should at a minimum do that entire side. 
Moreover, if you broke one stud, then it is likely that other studs may be
close behind.  For that reason, you should probably do ALL the studs while you
are in there.  Obviously this will raise the price today but could save you
from much more expense in the future.  Think of it as Insurance.  Plus, if you
have the engine down that far, it is a chance to look things over and clean
things up.  Your car will thank you for it!

Hope this helps a little Steve.

  John,

  The total weight on the wheels can't change.  If it did the car would
  **have** to accelerate into the sky or into the ground.  Remember,
  F is always equal to MA!

  I don't know what calculations you did, as only the results were 
  posted.  However, I am sure they were incorrect.

  You need to sum the forces on the body and the torques about the 
  body.  The forces **must** add to the weight of the car in steady-
  state conditions; this is *not* optional.  E.g. increased weight 
  on one axle *must* be accompanied by reduced weight on the other.

  You will then wind up with a set of simultaneous equations to 
  be solved.

As another poster already mentioned, pre-loading the rear wheels allows
more forward WEIGHT TRANSFER while providing enough rear wheel weight
to prevent lockup.  Yes, you could bias the brakes, but they you are
reducing their effectivness.  I think what you sort of showed is that 
*when braking* there is more *weight* on the front wheels!  Kinda like
weight transfer!

Remember, a lot of the power on understeer occurs at low speeds and 
high wheel angles and is largely a result of the steering geometry
and reduced front contact patch.

944's also exhibit power on understeer.  They have very even weight
distribution.

The weight still transfers.  It doesn't care whether or not you like it. ;-)

If you were to place scales under the wheels during braking or 
acceleration, you would be able to observe the wheel forces change, in
fact, you can observe the forces change: just watch the hood of your
car when you brake!

Consider the following hand waving argument (I just love waving hands, 
it gets around all those messy calculations...):

When under power, the front end lifts and the rear end sinks.  This is 
because the weight has transfered from the front to the rear.  The car
is supported by springs.  Springs are good devices with which to 
measure weight.  Kind of like scales...

When braking, the front end sinks and the rear end lifts.  Again the 
**weight** has **transfered**.  If it hadn't transfered, the front 
end *would not sink*!  Unless the torsion bar rate changed, and then
changed back when you were done braking.

Think about it:  

If not weight transfer, what makes the front end sink under braking?

Dunno about the mixture control unit but for your information the
noise of the fuel coarsing thru the CIS injectors is like a high
pitched screetch or whine. You can't miss it. It can be rather loud.
Maybe you didn't bleed the system fully, try holding the sensor plate
up for a longer time until you hear the screetch.

After all, wasn't the car running before you changed the filter?

makes for interesting reading and the opportunity to interact usefully. All
that is GOOD.

I see a recent trend, though which is not good: 'Obvious' questions are
being asked too often. (Of course, one person's obvious is another person's
obscure, so this is a gray area.)

Too many of the questions would not be getting asked if the asker simply
glanced at the PANOs we (all?) get, or looked at C&D, R&T, etc.

I'm not trying to be elistist (and I *know* that I am at the low end of
technical knowledge and Porsche lore on this list) but there is such a vast
difference between the question of how to determine weight transfer under
braking, and where to get Cool Carbons, that participants ought to be able
to downplay the latter type of question.

a 3.4L 240 PS 6 cylinder boxer engine with 5 speed transmission.  In order
to save costs and weight, some of the more luxurious features of the 911
will be missing, such as electric seat adjustment and the brakes and tires
will be adapted to match the slightly lower performance expectations."

Hope this one makes it to the States!  Imagine...the slick 993 body with a

Typically, you lose the cylinder and the head, but you can also lose
other things depending on where the leak is, and how severe. Remember,
at the point where you can no longer sustain combustion on that cylinder,
you now have added a brake to the engine. Since that's not what the piston,
cylinder, or crankshaft was designed to do, you have many, many potential
problems. Also if the inevitible leak is pointing at another cylinder
head, you *may* erode it significantly from the outside, and require
replacement at rebuild time. If I hadn't seen this happen, I wouldn't have
thought it was something to worry about, but it really is.

Since the Carerra 3.0 was basicly a 911SC engine, you have more longevity
in the parts than you would if it were a regular 2.7. Still, replacing 
all the head studs is a good idea. You also need to have a look at the
threaded inserts on the case -- if you have typical EuroRust, they'll be
corroded significantly as well, and may need replacing (a very difficult 
proposition, needing professional machine shop services and requiring a
complete disassembly of the engine).

Hi all!

I figured I'd better get this question in before I get charged for it or
have to try to figure out which category to list it under :-).

I'm giving up on Western Civilization and am moving to the Philippines to
live with my brother on his sailboat for...well...for forever at this
point (it was a tough choice, but somebody had to make it :-).

After an appropriate amount of soul-searching (in the neighborhood of 2
seconds) I've decided to put my 914 in storage in Phoenix rather than
sell it.  I waited too long to get one (18 years).  Besides, having it in
storage will be my incentive to become rich and famous so I can get it
shipped over there.  This, of course, occurring after an adequate period
of hammock swingin', wind ridin', and sightseein' (I think my brother
wants to sail around the world!).

So the obvious question is, what should one do to a car to prepare it for
long term indoor storage (i.e.  years).  I'm not planning on having
anyone roll the car back and forth or anything like that.

Thanks!

Dyson Racing, home of several IMSA contenders, among them 962s
campaigned around the country by drivers James Weaver, Price Cobb, Rob
Dyson, John Paul, Jr, Scott Pruett,  and Tiff Needel, to name a few.

For 1994, Dyson Racing will be campaigning a World Sportscar
Championship (WSC) car, a Spice chassis powered by a Ferrari engine.
(Yep, I know that the word Porsche did not appear in the previous
sentence, but these guys do belong to our region...)

In addition to the WSC entry, we'll have a chance to see 962-101, the
first Porsche 962 campaigned by a privateer, as well as Rob's personal
289 Cobra, which has just been restored.  We'll also get a chance to
see some state of the art equipment, e.g. a Penske shock absorber
testing machine, kevlar fabrication, etc.

The event starts at 10 a.m., rain, snow or shine, and will last until
around 2 p.m.  There is no charge for the event, but we need to know
how many people will be attending.  Poughkeepsie is about 100 miles
north of New York City, served best by Stewart Airport in Newburgh,
about 30 miles from Poughkeepsie.

The vector diagram is not all that complicated:

				  /	
				 / 	<-- ducktail, for reference
	             + Cg	/

       ---------------------------	<--- V = 320 kph

       + front hub		 + rear hub
- ----> ___		Fbr---> ___
 Fbf   ^			 ^
       |			 |
       Nf			 Nr


The braking force is applied below the Cg although (hopefully!)
not at a distance of one meter (can you say "body roll"). Actually
it is applied at or near the contact patch of the tire.  Through
the action of the calipers and discs the braking force is
converted to a torque about the wheel hubs in the anti-clockwise
direction.

The lever arm represented by the rear of the car is forced upwards
in response to the torque about the front wheel hubs.  The lever
arm represented by the front of the car is forced downwards by the
torque acting on the rear wheel hubs.  This obviously increases
the front normal force (Nf) and decreases the rear normal force
(Nr).  The Cg will move as a function of its distance from the
hubs and the value of Fbf, Fbr, Nr, and Nf, modulo the action of
the springs and dampers.

It should be clear from this diagram, an appreciation of the
directions of the torques about the hubs, and the location of the
Cg on a bicycle why the action of the rear brake alone cannot flip
you over (The torque about the rear hub is pushing the Cg, and
your face, into the ground. In the opposite case the torque about
the front hub is pushing the Cg, and your butt, into the air).  It
all comes down to the location of the Cg w/r/t the point about
which the torque is applied.

I have the scars to demonstrate this principle...

Cheers,
Tim

This result should have made you suspicious.  Under steady-state braking,  
the total normal force must equal the weight of the car, else the car  
would be accelerating in the vertical direction (in this case, down).

The right answers under your proposed conditions and assumptions are:

Front normal force = Rear normal force = 4500 N

Moving the CG forward 1 m gives us:

Front normal force = 7500 N; Rear normal force = 1500 N

Braking at 1 g with the original rearward weight bias results in:

Front normal force = 6000 N; Rear normal force = 3000 N

And at 1 g with the forward weight bias:

Front normal force = 9000 N; Rear normal force = 0 N (about to endo)

All else being equal, cars with rearward weight bias brake better than  
cars with forward weight bias.  Tires don't behave exactly like the model  
of friction you learned in high school physics class.  As normal force  
increases on the tire, the coefficient of friction (mu) decreases.  This  
means that although increasing the weight on the front tires will result  
in more frictional force there, the net increase is less than what you  
give up at the rear.  The ideal situation for maximum grip is to have the  
weight evenly distributed among all four tires.

Acceleration is different.  First of all, you are usually driving only two  
wheels, which means you want to maximize the grip at one end only.   
Secondly, very few cars (and no street cars that I'm aware of) can  
accelerate nearly as quickly as they can brake, which means that the  
weight transfer is nowhere near as extreme.  All else being equal,  
rear-drive cars with rearward weight bias accelerate better than cars with  
front weight bias.  But front-wheel drive cars accelerate better with  
front weight bias.

There are two main reasons no serious race cars are front-wheel drive.   
First, the front wheels are already doing all the steering work.  Second,  
weight transfer under acceleration, especially with high-horsepower cars,  
transfers weight off the driving front wheels.

So cars like the 911 seem to have the ideal weight distribution and should  
outbrake and outaccelerate other cars.  Unfortunately, the rearward weight  
distribution is a liability in cornering, where you'd like the weight  
evenly distributed front/rear.

Subject: Weight Transfer etc.


   if we use the original configuration, but brake at 1g, we get:
   Force normal on front axle: 6000N
   Force normal on rear axle : 3000N

   if we use the second configuraton, but brake at 1g:
   Force normal on front axle: 6000N
   Force normal on rear axle : 3000N



   As for the conclusions:
   1.  The coef. of friction for a tire decreases as normal force
increase.
   Therefore, for optimum braking performance you would want 50/50
normal force
   distribution at the max braking braking force.  If you start out
with more
   weight on the rear under static conditions, you are more ballanced
under braking
   conditions and have more available grip.

The initial calculations showing varied total normal force were
somehow in error, and the calculations above have correctly shown that
although the weight transfers forward under braking the total normal
force remains the same. But another conclusion you have nicely shown
is that weight distribution is only effected by CG *height*, and not
initial weight distribution front to rear. Hence lowering the CG is a
first order effect in reducing both lateral and longitudinal weight
transfer. Other factors include braking torque available.

Further, if you ignore tire dynamics and assume a constant Newtonian
friction model, then accordingly weight distribution has no effect on
braking or lateral "handling", simply because as weight transfers to a
more heavily loaded tire it simply carries a linearly more lateral
load via: F = Mu*N, where F is the lateral load, Mu is the coefficient
of friction and N is the Normal Force.

So therefore Colin Chapman was correct when he asserted that weight
distribution alone does not effect handling, that is the sole fault of
the way tires carry sideloads and brings us to the next point:

You say  1.  The coef. of friction for a tire decreases as normal
force increase., why? Please elaborate on this a bit.

This response to a question about a broken head stud in a '77
Carrera 3 is a little bit misleading if you're not intimately
familiar with engine rebuilding.  Yes, you should update all 24 head
studs to the latest version available: epoxy-coated dilivar ($16 each).
Timeserts themselves do not prevent pulled head studs.  The dilivar
PREVENTS stud-pulling by matching expansion of the cylinder from
heat.  The epoxy-coating PREVENTS broken studs from corrosion.
In order to put the newest head studs in an earlier case (ie.
'77 magnesium), you must machine the case for the larger diameter
studs.  The best way is to use timeserts, not helicoils.  Likewise,
if you have a late model aluminum crankcase that you are updating
with new studs, and a stud breaks off and must be drilled out,
then you should repair the hole with a timesert.

A little-known fact (in defense of John) is that the first aluminum
cases with the proper size holes for the new studs are the '76-77
911 turbo's and 911 Carrera 3.0's (european only model, and the model 
in question that prompted this thread).  They
had steel studs on the intake side, which would pull, and non-coated
dilivar studs on the exhaust side, which would corrode and break.
A pulled stud required machining and a timesert.  A broken stud,
(not broken at the base, hopefully) could be wrenched out and 
replaced with an updated stud without timeserting. 

In summary, timeserting is PART of the prevention when updating
an early magnesium case (2.7 liters or less) with the newest dilivar
studs.  Timeserting is part of the cure for pulled/broken studs in
aluminum cases which must be drilled out.  The primary PREVENTION
is always the epoxy-coated dilivar head studs (ALL 24 of 'em).

So, if you have a 3.0 liter+ case, don't remove your studs, and 
timesert 24 perfectly-good threaded holes.  That would be an
unnecessary waste of resources.

On Saturday, January 15th, the Hudson Valley Region of the Porsche Club
of America will be visiting the Poughkeepsie, New York facility of
Dyson Racing, home of several IMSA contenders, among them 962s
campaigned around the country by drivers James Weaver, Price Cobb, Rob
Dyson, John Paul, Jr, Scott Pruett,  and Tiff Needel, to name a few.

For 1994, Dyson Racing will be campaigning a World Sportscar
Championship (WSC) car, a Spice chassis powered by a Ferrari engine.
(Yep, I know that the word Porsche did not appear in the previous
sentence, but these guys do belong to our region...)

In addition to the WSC entry, we'll have a chance to see 962-101, the
first Porsche 962 campaigned by a privateer, as well as Rob's personal
289 Cobra, which has just been restored.  We'll also get a chance to
see some state of the art equipment, e.g. a Penske shock absorber
testing machine, kevlar fabrication, etc.

The event starts at 10 a.m., rain, snow or shine, and will last until
around 2 p.m.  There is no charge for the event, but we need to know
how many people will be attending.  Poughkeepsie is about 100 miles
north of New York City, served best by Stewart Airport in Newburgh,
about 30 miles from Poughkeepsie.

If you are interested in attending (free lunch will be provided),
please RSVP to me georgebeuselinck@csbh.com

When I confirm your reservation, I will send you directions to the

I am totally impressed with all the technical physical discussion about weight

Being an ex EE myself (I am now in Marketing), I can assure you that I am 
incapable of quoting Newtonian three laws of physics as well as dynamics 
equations to prove or disprove a complex phenomenon such as a 911 on impending 
rear wheel lock up about to hit a wall. 

There are only two things I can add:

1. Force = mass * acceleration always hold true, unless velocity is approaching 
the speed of light, then the famous equation Energy = Mass * the square of the 
speed of light starts to screw things up. I doubt that a 911 can attain that 
kind of velocity, but since we were talking text book here ...

2. Yes weight does transfer under dynamic condition. By bottom tells me so, as 
well the the hood of the car.

	  remove sparkplugs and put about an ounce of motor oil

	  (plugs out to not damage the engine),

	  remove and discard battery.

	  change all fluids, including brake fluid.

      place car on jackstands, remove wheels, discard tires.

	  AZ is dry so rust is not a big problem, still i would

The battery in my 928 went beyond dead last month.  So I looked in the local

she says "Ah, yes here it is, lets see if we have one in stock", she raps on

rings this thing up and says, "Are you expecting this price?", and I say "Oh 
yes, I know how much batteries are", and she says "Oh, ok, that will be 
$134".  So to make a long story short, thats how much my battery costs, so I 
would say $80 isn't too bad.  When I got the battery, stamped on the side of

What I *want* is to make it possible for people to get messages based on
content, so you could do some sort of profile thing that says "I want all
the 944 messages except those about brakes, and any message about 914
fuel injection". That way, the list could still be run in the large, but
individuals would not get overwhealmed.

But there are some other issues as well -- see below.

>Please subscribe me to e-region.  Chris, you didn't mention a -request
>address...  Is there one?

Yes. There wasn't but there is now.  *ONLY* ask to join the e-region list
if you want to *WORK*. It's not a new tech forum or anything...

>BTW, we seem to be combining the discussions of splitting Porschephiles and

Simple. Resources. PCA has all this info that could be pulled on-line as
a resource to everyone here, we have resources that could benefit the less
technologically adept in the PCA. And the trade off gets ever more interesting
when you also consider that we have only donated resources, and they have
money. Serious money.

Take the first problem: computational overhead. Each message spends a fair
amount of time being pounded by sendmail before going out. At any given
time, there are at least 20 processes running that are either recieving new
incoming messages, trying to deliver outgoing messages, or archiving something.
That's 24 hours a day, guys. There are a zillion things that could be improved 
if we had better (i.e. faster) hardware at our disposal.

There is another problem: bandwidth. Lessee--- we did about a megabyte
last month in total traffic. Times what, let's say 500 members just to
be on the safe side -- that's 500 megabytes, roughly, of data being
transmitted. Or, in bits, that's 4 gigabits. Which could be sent 
using the 56kb/s link I do have in oh, roughly 11 hours. Plus
extra time due to re-transmission. *IFF* the link wasn't doing anything
else. Bottom line: as the list grows, the network resource demand grows too. 

There is a point out there where the network demand outstrips the
the ability of the 56kb/s line I have to do *anything* but Porschephiles,
and then another point beyond which it NO LONGER WORKS. If we're successful
in bring on things like WAIS indexed archives, and UpFixin Der Porsche
in electronic format, and GIF archives of the various Porsche artwork that
PCA has rights for, etc. -- things that drive up interactive access demands
and that put a higher data transfer load on the net -- that happens
so much sooner. Who's gonna pony up for that T-1 upgrade?

Last, while Dick Stallman demonstrated with Project GNU that you can get
*amazing* stuff done with volunteer efforts, what he really proved was
that at some point, you need paid staff to keep things going.  When I 
started this list, I had a "real job" -- I was on faculty at Baylor 
College of Medicine. As a result, I not only had good donated resources,
I had time to do things with them. For the past several years, as a consultant, 
my primary advantage was that since I was in very high demand, I could set
my rates in a way that let me invest in facilities to make the list possible
and to take off a enough time to "have fun" running this list, chatting, etc.
These days, as president of a startup software company, let me assure
you that "spare time" and "big resources" are things of the past -- I've only 
been doing this for 5 months, and I'm already three months behind! So I only 
handle list stuff when I'm waiting on something else to finish, or
I do it over lunch or dinner or instead of going home at a reasonable
time. And for now, I still have the resources of TTA at my disposal, but
there *WILL* be a transition sometime after the first of the year, and
I'll need to either re-host to NetSmiths (the new company) or elsewhere.

Pumping up the resources available to me, and everyone else that gets involved 
in running this thing down the road, is important. Making more and better
resources available to the subscribers is also terribly important.  There is
a lot of knowledge out there in our archives already, and there is more
in the various texts potentially available from PCA. Making it possible to
access that in some reasonable way would be very, very useful.

Lastly, not breaking the *feel* of the list if incredibly important. This
is more-or-less how *GOOD* PCA regions work -- there is this comraderie,
this sense of belonging, and a certainty that you *really* can bother anyone
in the group about anything anytime, even if it's just to chat or have
a virtual cup of coffee... Not really having that in some of the regions
in which I've participated makes me all the more sensitive to not losing
it here.

This is hashed over regularly over on rec.autos.vw, where the traffic is

The main argument against it is purely philosophical.  A VW is a VW, and we
should all band together.  They've all got fahrvergnuegen.  We shouldn't
segregate ourselves.  We shouldn't make it so easy for the air-cooled folks
to forget about the water-cooled cars and people, and vice-versa.  I am
in this camp.

I think the same applies to Porschephiles.  A Porsche is a Porsche, and no
matter what Porsche you happen to have chosen, I feel a bond with you.  I
suspect, though, that many of the 911 and 928 camp will look down on the
914 and 924 folks, and push them aside and ignore them if given the easy
opportunity.

I'd rather keep it one big list.  Don't segregate.

Please subscribe me to e-region.  Chris, you didn't mention a -request
address...  Is there one?

BTW, we seem to be combining the discussions of splitting Porschephiles and
joining the PCA.  I believe these are two very different topics...  How are
they related?

Hi Nigel. 

I am looking at the MP Fortran compiler on the eval SS1000
that we have from you guys. I think that the MP Fortran
installation may be incomplete. Were you guys able to get
a good MP Fortran compilation and link with the current set-up?

My problem comes at the link level, when the linker fails to
find libF77_mt. I might be missing something obvious of course,
but I could not find any reference to the lib anywhere on the
system.

I am not sure if you are the correct person to help with this,
but if not perhaps you can forward my mail to someon who can help.

Subject: cobra clubman seat


Steve Stomski asked about the Cobra Clubman seat.  I have had one in my
vintage race mini for 4 years.  Whether the seat is comfortable
depends on your height.  I am just under 6'2" and the seat is just
fine. A friend of mine who is about 5'10' considers the seat an
instrument of torture. (another friend of mine about my height
co-drove two enduros with me and found the seat ok). I think if you
were shorter than 5'10" it might also be ok.  

The mounting position is also important.  I find that the seat needs
some rake in the mounting to be comfortable...I also use a small pillow
for lumbar support.

BTW, for next year I am upgrading to a Butler aluminum seat, which
really holds me in(very high sides) and is comfortable.
(ok, if you do not have to enter and exit the car much. 
The cobra is much better for egress.) I originally purchased the
seat when I inteneded occasional street driving for the car(HA!))

My Cobra may be available for sale quite reasonably in the next
month or so...once the Butler is successfully installed.

1)      Did the car run with the old filter?

2)      How long did you bleed the system, when bleeding did you hear
        the fuel pump running?  You can always loosen the filter outlet
        fitting and see if fuel is getting through - **BE CAREFUL**!

3)      My 'SC did something similar after I changed the plugs once:
        fired over, then died.  I'd knocked off a large vacuum hose.
        Look for a disconnected hose in the filter area, it's dark 
        back there and something may have gotten bumped.

4)      If the car was running prior to changing the filter, I doubt
        that the MCU has croaked just from the heartbreak of losing 
        his buddy the old fuel filter.

Subject: Weight Transfer etc.


I've looked at it some more, and despite the inputs received thus far, I 
still stand by my numbers (I am willing to revise my conclusions somewhat 
however).  I recalculated the problem a couple of different ways and am 
still comfortable with my results.  Since only one of my detractors (WK 
Preece) offered any insight into how he came up with his figures, I will 
have to limit my quantitative response to those numbers (4500N/4500N f/r). 
 Our methods were similar, but I feel the key thing that was ignored in his 
approach was the effect of the angle between the applied force and moment 
arm on torque.  Torque is a cross product, equaling the length of the moment 
arm times the force applied times the sine of the angle between the two. 
 Also, the fact that he used only the horizontal distances for moment arms 
was in error, since the CG was above the road.  As Nathan came up the same 
numbers as Bill, I will  assume that he used a similar approach, which 
probably includes the same error (IMHO).  As for the more qualitative inputs 
I received, I offer the following:

Flipping bike:  This fits my model just fine, at least until the rear wheel 
lifts off, at which point the assumptions necessary to keep this problem 
simple are no longer valid.  In this case, the normal force at the rear 
simply becomes less than zero.

Car sinking through road:  As long as the normal forces at both ends of the 
car are greater than zero and less than the load bearing capacity of the 
suspension and the road, the car will neither float off or sink into the 
road.  It will simply compress its springs more or less according to the 
load.  This would be analogous to the effect of wings and sidepods on an 
Indy or F1 car.  At speed, these devices create quite a bit of downforce, 
and despite the fact that the resulting total normal forces on the car are 
well in excess of its static weight, it does not sink into the road.

Center of Gravity:  Yes, 1m is a bit high, I would guess that .5m would have 
been more realistic.  In any case, it is definitely above the surface of the 
road.

To clarify things, I will now explain my method further.  First, draw an 
inverted "T".  The ends of the horizontal segment represent the contact 
patches and the upper end of the vertical segment represents the CG.  If we 
treat the car as a point mass at the CG, we can calculate the torque (about 
the axis defined by the intersection of the two segments) generated by its 
deceleration.  If we split this torque evenly between the two contact 
patches (valid because we have assumed it to be a rigid body), we can 
calculate the forces exerted by this torque at each of the patches.  By the 
geometry of this model, these forces are normal to the road, and when added 
to the static weight distribution, we get the figures I came up with.  This 
works for me.

As for my conclusions, I tried to keep them brief and simple which was an 
obvious mistake on my part.  Yes, tires are nonlinear devices.  Yes, there 
is more to braking than doing it once - we do have to try to spread the work 
around, lest we cook something we don't want to.  Yes, acceleration is 
different, but the model still works.  Yes, handling is a different story 
entirely (almost).

At any rate, I didn't mean to turn this into a rerun of the polar moment 
discussion and hopefully we won't have to waste too much more bandwith on 
this.  I'm still willing to accept the possibility that I am wrong however, 
but somebody's going to have to come up with a better argument than what 
I've seen thus far.  Later...  JW

I tend to disagree with Fred Pack about obvious and less obvious questions,
although, I do appreciate it when people who ask questions  have done their
homework before jumping on the net.  Not everyone may have access to all of the
"obvious" resources.  As I'm sure MANY people will reply, PANO is the nickname

I would rather leave things as it is now.  If you try to put some more

politics into this newsgroup.  We already have plenty of bureaucracy and 
politics in the PCA clubs and driving clubs, that it is a relief to be able to
have some "free form", unrestrictive and opinionated views on p-car matters. 

I can always find some kind of organization to tell me what I need to know, as
long as I FOLLOW THE RULES!  Besides, if the current system was modified or 
be more structured as was suggested by Chris, somebody, somewhere will do 
another Porschephiles again like Stan's and we'll be back with the same "old" 
Porschephiles, except it'll be another "Stan-look-alike".

I remember back in my College days, how refreshing it was to read the 
"underground" newspapers.  Some was junk and some opened your eyes, but at 
least it was from a different perspective without repercussion.  I consider 
the "current" Porshephiles a bunch of "free sprirt" maniacs who love their

balance.  (I don't ALWAYS wear my pin-stripped suit with the "power tie".

"Exclusivity"?  Whoa, there, podner!  The *best* thing about PPhiles

As for flame wars, we as a group seem to be able to avoid them.  Some-

>You say  1.  The coef. of friction for a tire decreases as normal

Most elastic materials do not have coefficents of friction, they have
*functions* of friction - I think it's pointless to speak of the 
coefficent of friction changing:  IF IT'S CHANGING WITH NORMAL FORCE,
IT'S *NOT* A COEFFICENT!     -Sorry, but this is a pet peeve!

Treating the friction function as a coefficent provides excellent 
engineering results; it is a *very good* approximation.  However,
I think it's important to know when and how your approximations
break down.  Since most people only encounter the subject (CoF) in 
freshman physics, they live their lives thinking it's written 
in stone.  

Did anyone else notice that (almost?) *everything* you learned in 
freshman physics was incorrect?

All the information I've encountered is empirical, e.g. plots of the
"coefficent" of friction vs. normal force.  [In other words, a plot
of the friction function!]

I can't give you the physics, but most race car engineering books
discuss it at some level of detail.  I'm pretty sure Carroll Smith
mentions it in one of his "XXXXX to Win" serries.  "Tune to Win,"
"Prepare to Win," etc.

Another book called (I think) "Race Car Engineering" (can't remember
the author, think the last name begins with a V) discusses 
tire performance.  I can't remember exactly what he gets into, 
but it is another place to start looking.

A lot of these books are available at Frey Racing in Mountain 
View for the SF Bay Area folk.

If anyone knows of a rigorous theroetical treatment I'd appreciate 
a reference.

Subject: Re: List etiquette

Fred Pack's note about list etiquette notes that "...'Obvious' questions
are being asked too often. (Of course, one person's obvious is another
person's obscure, so this is a gray area.), and that "...Too many of the 
questions would not be getting asked if the asker simply glanced at the 
PANOs we (all?) get, or looked at C&D, R&T, etc."

One possible fix for this is the ubiquitous "frequently asked questions"
(FAQ) that many lists and newsgroups maintain.  If such a file were
created and either posted irregularly or available somewhere, some of
the increasing traffic in Porschephiles might be lessened.

I'm hardly the most qualified to develop the FAQ, but I'd be willing to
help, perhaps by compiling the questions and answers submitted by
others.  Before anyone jumps the gun and starts sending me FAQ items, 
perhaps some discussion about this idea is warranted.  For instance,
since FAQs are common, are there reasons why this hasn't been done on
Porschephiles before now?  In addition, Stan should probably weigh in 
with a ruling about the proposal, since it may affect him the most.  
Also, is there room and ftp access on tta.com for archival of the FAQ?

RE> Battery Problem
Okay, my battery problem is solved.  I guess that my mechanic
relented.  He told me that $80 was "just a guess", but I think
that he was just trying to save face.  He wound up charging me
$65 or so, and no extra labor.  That leaves him an acceptable
profit margin--after all, he does have to make a living.  I also
did some more research on costs, and it turns out that the two
batteries I saw first were the least expensive ones of that size
available.  Most places quoted about $50.  My mechanic also did
not charge me for the moderately cheap spark plugs he installed
(except for labor), to replace the *very* cheap plugs I had
mistakenly put in myself.  So, I'm mostly happy again.

BTW, the cheaper Bosch Platinum plugs are *not* recommended
for older cars.  The little tiny speck of platinum evidently tends
to foul easily, and the QC is not of the best.  Supposedly the old
copper-core Bosch plugs are better.  The expensive Platinums
are, of course, even better.

Subject: Dellorto carbs for 914

I am new to the network and this is my first attempt at reaching other
Porschephiles.  I am responding to an old question about Dell carbs.

I have used them on a 1.7 litre and 2.0 litre engine.  The jetting and
venturis vary according to the condition of your engine (they are easily
changed).  The carburetter is also sensitive to fuel pressure and you must
try different psi settings.  I found that for the 1.7 engine the best
results came from 30 venturis, 140 mains, and 55 pump jets.  Larger venturis
will result in the engine bogging down under load.  Make sure that the air
cleaners are also tall enough to allow the engine to breath freely--you can
tell when the engine is not getting enough air when you hear the top of the
air filter plate popping/flexing.  For the 2.0 engine, 34 venturis worked
best (stock engine). I have also tried slightly smaller and larger pump
jets but found the 55 size to be the best compromise.  I am sure that others have found other combinations
which worked best for them.

Now about suppliers.  Although CB in California is the major distributor,
they are quite unfriendly and not very generous with advice. Eurorace in
Redondo Beach, Ca. is very friendly and helpful but they sell a kit that is
not as good as CB.  You should beware of the inexpensive kit made of
plastic-like material.  CB's kit is far superior (heim joints, etc.), but
the long accelerator link rod (aluminium with bronze insert) may have to be
shortened by a competent machine shop.  In any case, if you did not purchase
your kit from CB you will apt to get the cold shoulder treatment when you
call to get parts.  Eurorace, on the other hand, is quite good about selling
jets, venturis, etc.  Another difficulty with the carbs is to set them up to
open equally and smoothly.  Patience is the operative word here.

I hope that the above is helpful to the person who asked about these carbs
in early December.  On a personal note, I would like to correspond with
anyone interested in modifying their 914 for autox or track.  Does anyone
have 7 inch wheels that will fit stock fenders for sale?

I'll offer an informed theory (and that's all it is - no personal 
experience here).  Since ABS systems must be able to reduce pressure in 
a brake line, and possibly block fluid's progress towards the caliper 
simultaneously, a solenoid-controlled valve may be interfering.  When 
the car's off, the valve's rest state may be such that it blocks brake 
fluid flow to the calipers.

This isn't good for fail-safe engineering, but may provide an 
explanation.  Note also that some traction control systems integrate 
with ABS, and can apply brakes to a driven wheel's caliper to prevent 
wheelspin.  Again, interference from associated valves may be the culprit.

Can anybody enlighten this more?

Hey, everyone!

914s around with the original FI, this is for you!
    PartsHeaven in Hayward, CA, is selling *brand new* air flow
sensors for $185 + $50 core!  This is a _full hundred_ less
than the local Porsche dealer (Carlsen) or AutoMotion, and about
the same as many places are selling used or rebuilt units for.
    When I called before lunch, they had two left.  Now they have
one.  They may have more of the '75 style (7 pin connector).
    Phone is: 800/767-7250.  They said shipping to Sunnyvale
(about 25 miles) would be around $5.
    I am in no way associated with them, I just got back from

Subject: 914 Survey Results(Carb vs FI)

What follows is the summary of the 914 survey, Carbs vs Fuel Injection.
The results: 32 FI   10 Carb
I didn't count the 914/6's with the carbs because they originally came that
way.(However, no one converted a 914/6 to FI)

So..What did we learn?  Most of the "carb" 914's were converted either out of
necessity or because the owner wanted more performance.  Each method seems
to have it's advantages and disadvantages.  If your worried about emissions
then you have to stick with Injection.  From personal experience, I think the
carbs work great but they do require a certain amount of "tinkering" to get
them
"right" and keep them that way.  When the FI works, it works well, but it
can be troublesome to diagnose problems.

I have a file with the detailed responses compiled, but it is rather large
( 20k ). If you would like a copy please e-mail a request to me at 
tommywmson@aol.com

Thanks to all who responded.  It was enlightening.

As a starter, I tried the calculations also and get the same results
as the "responders", where the original rear weight-biased model

distribution of 6000N rear, 3000N front.

In evaluating cornering behavior of tires, it is relatively well known
that the lateral force for a given slip angle is not a linear function
of normal force. As the normal force increases the lateral force for
a given slip angle increases, but less than linearly with the increase
in normal force. Another way to say the same  thing is to say that
the coefficient of friction, defined as (lateral force)/(normal force)
(at a given slip angle, for the case of a tire) decreases as the
normal force increases. This by the way is the only thing which makes
understeer/oversteer tuning using sway bars or other methods of 
apportioning the weight transfer between front and rear work. If the
rear gets more of the lateral weight transfer (by a stiff rear bar),
the outer wheel gets nore normal force, and the inner wheel gets
correspondingly less, but the total rear lateral force is lower
due to the nonlinear coef. of friction, and more rear slip angle
is required for a given lateral force (e.g. more oversteer).

All this translates directly to braking, except that slip angle
becomes percentage slip. The total braking force is a maximum at
an equal front/rear dynamic weight distribution (assuming the same
tires- you late 911 and 951 drivers have more calculations to do).
Note that this becomes messy, since the dynamic wieght distribution
is dependent on the total braking force.

Hello PFiles,

I'm planning on getting an OEM tail, factory rubber, etc.

Do I need to install anything else to keep the car aerodynamically

no problem. A after a considerable intermission I got to pull the heads a week

the same time, as was the practice of the shop, they machined the spigots into
which the barrels fit, taking off a reported 10 thou. They advised me of this

that with this bank more than 10 thou was machined off. The result being that
the inlet valves were just touching the piston cast flats, shown as a light 
polishing of the flat. I have been advised against machining the flats of the

Also any feeling about refitting the heads and cam housing as one rather than

Porschephiles,
  This ought to lend some Christmas cheer to the group. I received this
last year from Dave Darling, just thought I'd return the favor of a
good chuckle.

				Porsche Bells
 			[To the tune of "Jingle Bells"]

Dashing through the Valley
In my Nine Fourteen Porsch-ay
Up Highway Nine I go,
Sliding all the way.
I need new piston rings,
I need some decent tires --
My car is held together by some old AT-bus wire!

(chorus :)
OH, rust and smoke,
The heater's broke,
The roof just blew away!
I see a flash
Beneath the dash,
And then I start to pray-ay!
The A-arm's bent,
The muffler went,
The Blaupunkt, it's okay--
Oh, what fun it is to drive my Nine Fourteen Porsch-ay!

I went to the Pak'n 'Sav
To get some Christmas cheer.
I just passed up my left front tire
And it's gettin' hard to steer!
Down to the El Camino,
Right past the Sunnyvale cop.
I had to drag my Reeboks
To get the car to stop.

(chorus)

Down the road I go
In a big blue cloud of smoke.
People laugh as I drive by,
I wonder what's the joke?
I've got to get to Valco
To pick up the lay-away--
Santa Claus is coming
In his li'l mid-engined sleigh!

John:

Sorry, but though you might have checked your calculations again, you are  
still wrong, wrong, wrong!  Either it's been a long time since you got  
that "A" in kinematics, or your professor must have been out to lunch.

You write:

Sorry, but this is just wrong.  If the car is not accelerating in the  
vertical direction, then it must see a net vertical force of zero (Newton  
again).  The total weight of the car, mg, does not change under braking,  
and _must_ be balanced by the vertical reaction forces acting through the  
contact patches of the tires.  In the case of a car with downforce, the  
reaction forces at the contact patches increase to compensate for the  
external forces of aerodynamic lift acting on the wings of the car; the  
net force is still zero.  If you don't believe this, then don't bother  
reading further--my explanations are based on the fundamental laws of  
physcis, which include Newton's First Law, and I won't try to prove those  
premises.

Actually, it doesn't, as you get the wrong answer!

Here is the correct way to calculate the reaction forces at the front and  
rear contact patches:

1.  Draw a free-body diagram (FBD) including all the forces acting on the  
car.  This should have a vertical force acting on the front wheel (R1) and  
one on the rear wheel (R2).  They should act _upward_ (remember, these are  
forces acting _on the car_, not on the ground).  It should also have a  
vertical force acting downward through the center of mass of the car,  
which is mg = (900 kg)(10 m/s^2) = 9000 N (using your assumption of g = 10  
m/s^2).  It also should have horizontal forces acting at the contact patch  
of the front and rear tires against the direction of travel, which we call  
F1 and F2.

2.  Now consider your first example, where the car is decelerating at 0.5  
g = 5 m/s^2.  Because this free body (the car) is decelerating, the sum of  
forces and moments on the car does not equal zero.  In this case, there  
must be a horizontal force acting on the car of (900 kg)(5 m/s^2) = 4500  
N, which means the sum of all the forces in the horizontal direction must  
equal 4500 N, or in other words that F1 + F2 = 4500 N.  Now we apply  
something called d'Alembert's principle, which states that the external  
forces acting on a body are equivalent to the effective forces of the  
various particles forming the body, which in this case means we can  
replace the 5 m/s^2 deceleration with a force of magnitude 4500 N (lets  
call it P) applied at the center of mass of the body, and "cancelling out"  
the deceleration.

3.  Now we form the three equations of equilibrium:

Sum of forces in horizontal direction:

F1 + F2 - P = 0  ->  P = F1 + F2 = 4500 N  (Eq. 1)

Sum of forces in vertical direction (your answers contradict this  
equation):

R1 + R2 - mg = 0  ->  R1 + R2 = mg  (Eq. 2)

The sum of moments around any point must equal zero.  Let's use the point  
you picked, directly below the center of mass and on a line between the  
two contact patches:

(mg)(0) + (F1)(0) + (F2)(0) - (R1)(2) + (R2)(1) + (P)(1) = 0  (Eq. 3)

Notice that mg (the weight of the car) and the two horizontal forces F1  
and F2 contribute no moment about this point because their line of action  
passes through the chosen point.  The above equation simplifies to:

2 R1 - R2 = mg - P = 4500

Using Eq. 2 with the above, you get R1 = R2 = 4500 N, the answer posted by  
myself and others.  Did it ever occur to you that the reason several  
people replied with the same numbers was because they were the correct  
ones?

This is the rigorous approach and will work for most problems; there are  
shortcuts (some of which were posted) which apply specifically to this  
problem.  If you still don't believe me, please look through the first  
chapter or two of a basic high-school physics text before wasting more  
bandwidth.

I don't think so...do the following thought experiment: let the front hub of your
bike suddenly lock up solid (and the spokes not collapse from the stress). The
bike will still flip, just as it would with the little rubber thingys. The point
is that you can view the system (the bike) as kind of a black box, with a bunch
of forces applied to it from outside (gravity at the CG, vertical and horizontal
forces at the contact patches) and completely ignore the particular implementation
inside the black box (how the brakes work). 

By the same token, the forces and torques have to balance around the black box or 
it will accelerate.  The "lightening" effect hypothesized earlier would have to
accelerate the car downwards (the force of gravity at the CG just isn't going to
go away) into the road. The springs are inside the black box and don't really
matter, in the steady-state deceleration under consideration; you could replace
them with solid blocks if you wanted. Think about going over a big bump; after the
crest, the upward force on the wheels is reduced, the car accelerates downward, you
feel light because the car is accelerating (downward) away from you. Eventually
the road flattens out, the upward force on the wheels increases, and you get
squashed into the seat because the car is accelerating (upward) towards you.

Now, to test all this, we have to send somebody out on the road, sitting on a
scale in the passenger seat, taking readings, while the driver goes through
a variety of vigorous maneuvers...Any volunteers?

The car's amp has antenna in/out, and a power connection.  Yes, you can 
plug your Sony's antenna cable into the amp's antenna output.  If the 
Sony has a "power On" lead, connect this to the amp's power input.

The amp needs to be switched on & off by the radio, so the radio has to 
supply the power signal.  Most radios have separate leads just for this 
(and to raise power antennas).

I was curious about this the other day, and did a mechanical analysis of
the system for a static situation. The result I got (for a car in a constant
radius, fully settled condition) was that a stiff roll coefficient gives
less lateral weight transfer than a soft one, but for transients, the
opposite result is evident (although I didn't do an analysis of that).
In other words, stiff rear bar will give a higher tendancy to oversteer
at turn-in, but less tendancy to oversteer in steady state cornering. Is
this wrong? Can anyone tell me why, if so?

Hello Everyone!

The alternator light is on in my '75 911S and I have some questions.  Not the
least of which is:  Why is the light on?!  I measured 14.5V at the battery
with the car running.  I haven't yet cleaned up the big connection point at
the starter - could that be it?  I'm not sure if the battery is being charged -
the car is stored for the winter.  The problem started to occure (dimly glowing
light) a couple of weeks before the car went into the garage for winter.

How do you get the fan off of the alternator shaft?  I have the nut off but
it's a little, uh, stubborn...  I was thinking of a slide hammer but I don't
have one.  Any alternate ideas?

I have a non-Bosch alternator (Marchal (sp?) - I can tell from the regulator)
Any hope of *updating* to a Bosch unit if replacement is needed?

With the belt off I can't feel any obvious play in the shaft so maybe the
bearings aren't shot (yet).  I can hear faint sounds, suggesting perhaps springs
moving around...

My hunch is worn brushes (*coals* for our non-US netters!)  Anyone with a
similar experience want to discuss the topic?

Thanks for the help!  My $0.02:  Porschephiles is a great service - it is

a detailed explanation, read the last part of Chapter 3 of Smith's Tune to  
Win.

However, I can offer the following simple explanation, albeit without  
providing rigorous analytical support.  This thought experiment requires  
lots of simplifying assumptions, including ignoring the load transfer  
caused by horizontal movement of the center of mass as the car rolls.

Imagine a car chassis which was infinitely stiff, and did not deflect  
under suspension loads.  Further, imagine that the mass was evenly  
distributed vertically and longitudinally, and that the roll centers were  
at the same height front and rear, and below the center of mass.  Now,  
lets assume that the roll stiffness at the front of the car is half the  
roll stiffness at the rear.  What will happen when the car corners at a  
constant lateral acceleration (for example, around a skid pad)?

Obviously, it will roll, and the amount of roll will depend on the  
magnitude of lateral acceleration, the difference in height between the  
center of mass and the roll center, as well as the roll stiffness of the  
suspension.  But because our chassis is infinitely stiff, it cannot twist,  
so it must roll the same amount front and rear.  Because of the differing  
roll stiffnesses, it will take twice as much roll moment--and therefore,  
load transfer--at the rear to cause this body roll as it does at the  
front.  And because there is more load transfer at the rear, the outside  
rear wheel becomes most heavily loaded and the rear of the car has less  
grip than the front....which causes oversteer.  


Taken to an extreme, we pick up one wheel--like 911s or 914s with too much  
front roll stiffness pick up their inside front wheel, or VW Rabbits pick  
up their inside rear.

Ignoring lateral displacement of the CG, ultimate cornering power is  
independent of body roll alone.  We try to limit roll (usually by the use  
of stiff anti-roll bars) to keep our tires upright and to improve  
transient cornering response.  The idea that increasing roll stiffness at  
one end of the car _decreases_ that end's grip is counterintuitive for  
many people, but generally true nonetheless.  If you wish a less  
simplistic view, read Van Valkenburgh or Smith.

Hi Folks.

I've been offered a 1980 924 (ok, an Audi ;-) ) by a colleague; she only
drives the car and does not know much details about it.  From the photo it
looks well cared for -- she is the 2nd owner.  Should I even consider this

keep this car for 8 more years)

The car will be used mainly by my wife as a daily driver, 50mile r/trip
commute, and lots of short city driving, start-stop perhaps, during the
day. 

I'd appreciate any tips/pointers b4 I take a look at it.  Known problems,

Subject:  Magnesium Case Woes 

Hello PorschePhiles,

	I posted an earlier brief description of my dilemma and I have gotten
some useful information from Stan and some other respondants.  I also saw a
pertinent discussion on pulled 911 head studs.  In light of this information
I have decided that I need to post again, but give a more complete description
of my situation.  We can call this - 

  THE SAGA OF BILL'S '76 911S -or- THE (PAINFUL) EDUCATION OF A PORSCHE OWNER

	Ten and one half years ago, I purchased the only Porsche I have ever 
owned.  It had 70K miles on it.  It is significant that even at this time, the
engine oil pressure was registering near zero at idle.  By 97K miles the engine
had developed pretty horrendous oil leaks as I came to realize I was a member of
that coveted community of owners with magnesium cases of 2.7 liters plus.

	I had the engine rebuilt.  The head studs were deemed to be OK, so
nothing was done to them.  I realize now, in retrospect, that this was a mis-
take.  The subject of low oil pressure did come up, but I naively accepted the
statement that there was nothing you could really do about it.  So, the engine
was rebuilt, the oil leaks were gone for the time being, and it ran great.

	140K.  You guessed it.  The dreaded head stud pullout.  Time for rebuild
#2.  Apparently bad advice again, as all 24 stud holes were helicoiled.  The low
oil pressure situation was again not addressed.

	150K.  I heard the muted clatter of a collapsing chain tensioner, so I
took the car in to have it checked.  This is a different shop from the one that
did the rebuilds.  I followed a mechanic that used to work there over to this
new shop.  (This mechanic is *NOT* the one that did the rebuilds.) In the course
of checking the car, he put an oil guage on the engine and discovered the idle
pressure was about 7 - 10 psi.  He was rather shocked and told me the only
thing that could be done to correct this was to line bore the case, essentially
rebuild #3.

	Which brings me to my questions:

1)	Granted the oil pressure is dangerously low, but is it possible that it
	was always that low?  There has been no change in the instrument panel
	oil gauge behavior.  Have I been driving a time bomb for the last 10.5
	years?	If that's the case (no pun intended) then maybe it's worth the
	risk to	continue driving it as is? (!)

2)	Just for the record, is line boring really going to fix the low oil
	pressure problem?

3)	What is a timesert?  What's the difference between it and a helicoil?
	Why is it the only thing that REALLY fixes the pulled head stud problem?
	(In combination with Dilavar studs, based on what I read recently.)
	Since the case has already been helicoiled, is it too late (or impos-
	sible) to have them replaced with timeserts should I decide to go for
	rebuild #3?

4)	Sorry, but I have to ask this.  Is it possible to replace the entire
	engine on this car with one from an SC, i.e., an aluminum case?


	Please, any advice, information, suggestions are welcomed.

Subject: 993 test drive

993 Test Drive Report

I wasn't going to bother writing up my 993 test-drive experiences,
but based on Ben's report I thought I'd write a summary of my
experiences. This all happened a few weeks ago but I don't think
I've forgotten anything important.

My C4 was in for a minor service (oil change, winter check, fitting
winter tires) and when I came by to pick it up, the dealer asked me if
I was interested in test driving the new 911. So the next morning my
wife and I borrowed the new car for a couple of hours. I've had a
number of 911's over the years, and I've had the suspension
setup of my C4 modified (as recommended by the Porsche dealer) so that
it doesn't have the understeer problem exhibited by the stock
model. I'm no racing driver, but driving is definitely a hobby of
mine and I love nothing more than taking the 911 up into the Alps for
a day of fun in the summer. So while I'm sure I didn't push the
car anywhere near as hard as Ben's driver did, it was exciting
enough for me. Conditions for my test drive were good: low down, the
roads where wet from fog, but at higher elevations it was sunny and
dry.

First impressions: external appearance is vastly improved. I've
heard people complain that the new car doesn't look like a 911
anymore, and I suppose the new front treatment is a bit radical for a
911, but I quite like it. One problem I did notice when driving is
that the car throws up a great deal more water onto the windshield
than before, but fortunately the new wipers are also much better at
removing it. Overall, I find the body much more shapely than before.
The new car is noticeably wider at the back than the old carrera,
although the new model was sitting right next to a Jubilee C4 and a
Turbo 3.6 and I'd say the new model is only slightly narrower at
the waist than the turbo-body cars.

Internally there's not a big difference. Notable refinements: the
seats are more comfortable and supportive, six speed gearbox (more
later!) and there's been a general overall improvement in switch
layout. There's considerably more interior shoulder room.

Okay, enough cosmetics, on to the important stuff! You start it up,
first impression is that the engine is a good deal quieter (at least
inside the car). The clutch was a surprise! Extremely light. The
shifter is also very light, but precise. We both loved the shifter. My
wife quite liked the clutch, but then she's often complained about
the long travel and amount of force required for the older car. I
actually didn't like the new clutch at first: I found it harder to
change smoothly partly because I couldn't really detect the pick-up
point easily. Changing from first to second smoothly took practice. I
still prefer the old clutch, but maybe the new one grows on you. I
don't know the gear ratios, but first gear seems to be very low.
Second seems to be about the same as on the old five-speed box, but
third is definitely lower than on the old box. Steering is quite
heavily boosted, but very precise.

Acceleration from a standing start doesn't seem noticeably faster,
but once you're over 100 km/h it is considerably better. One thing
that used to always bug me about the old five-speed box is the shift
from second and third: even if you do it right at the redline, the
ratio difference between second and third is too great and you lose
too many revs in the upshift and drop too far down the torque curve,
so acceleration in third is disappointing. With the new car, this is
absolutely not a problem! The shift point is at about the same speed
(115 km/h) but third is definitely geared lower now, and the car
accelerates away much more briskly than before. A big win here in
terms of performance at freeway speeds (120 km/h and above). I imagine
the same holds true for redline shifts from third to fourth etc., but
I didn't try. The car is quite happy puttering along in sixth gear
at 120 km/h. Road noise at that speed is vastly reduced. You can
actually have a normal conversation at freeway speeds.

Handling: what can I say? This car is as close to perfect as I can
remember driving. We took it from the dealer (400 m altitude) to our
house (850 m altitude) up over a small mountain pass (1100 m
altitude). Just before the village where we live is a series of
climbing s-bends. From the bottom you can see all the way to the top
of the hill and if you're lucky there are no cars coming down the
other way, but just a series of, err "practice-target automobiles"
(you know, Opels, VWs etc.) containing Swiss Hausfraus making their
way slowly up the hill after shopping at the Migro. Fortunately, we
lucked out (no traffic coming the other way), so we accelerated and
proceeded to pass them one by one. I was stunned. This is a maneuver
I've often made in my 911, and I was amazed at how much faster,
easier and fun the new car is. It's really in cornering that the
new suspension shows how much of an improvement it is. The new car
holds the line in corners impeccably, it doesn't seem to be
influenced by bumps in the road, and you can turn in much more
aggressively than before. After that, I made a series of runs up over
the small pass, which has always been my favourite local 911 stomping
ground because it has a couple of smooth 180 degree curves with good
visibility in both directions, so providing the traffic cooperates you
can really play around. I turned into one of these at fairly high
speed, then lifted my foot off the accelerator. We all know how a
traditional 911 would react: my C4 acts traditionally in that it
oversteers, but relatively gently. The new car just slows down and
keeps going where you're pointing it. Now I wasn't going
insanely fast for the corner, but I was certainly going fast enough
that my C4 would have reacted. So whether or not the oversteering
problem is still there, I don't know, but the limit is certainly
higher than before. The next time on the same corner, I did the same
thing, only just after lifting off the accelerator I slammed it to the
floor. Ahh, NOW we get the tail to slide. But as soon as the rear
wheels stopped spinning, the car shot off straight as an arrow, right
in the direction you're pointing the wheels.

In short, this new car is much more pleasant to drive. The old
suspension bumps-and-thumps are gone, the car is generally quieter,
and as my wife said "even my mother could drive this thing." The
driving position is better and after 30 years of development
there's finally a 911 out there with wipers that actually work
better than those on a VW beetle. But the major difference is dynamic:
the six gear box is a vast improvement, and the new handling is
tremendous. I would say from my own point of view: that is, a Porsche
owner who sees the car more as a way to enjoy driving (especially in
the mountains on a good sunny day) and unwind after a rough week at
work, who's got absolutely no interest in matching wits (or lack of
wits) with 19 year olds in Honda CRXs or on sport bikes, the new car
is a tremendous success. It's faster, safer and more enjoyable to
drive. (Ok, ok, it's undoubtedly better against CRXs and sports
bike too...).

I'm very interested in hearing how those in the group with
autocrossing or other racing experience find the new car. I should
imagine the turbo engine combined with the new body will be a
phenomenal machine.

I don't read car magazines, but can somebody who does please post a
summary of what the reactions to the new car have been? I imagine the
survival of Porsche as an independent producer is probably very
dependent on the success of this car, so I hope the magazines have
praised it. Me, I might be doing my part as well: I'm considering
buying a new 993 cabriolet (I have a targa, and must say I'd buy
another if I could). My dealer tells me I could expect delivery in may
1994 if I ordered before January. I'll have to give it some serious
thought.

Start by looking at the whole car as a free body, viewed from the end
(Nathan went through a very nice analysis of this, viewed from the side).
As in the case just discussed for braking, the total vertical force on
the wheels must remain constant. Again use the point where a vertical
line through the CG meets the road  to sum moments, since it makes the
horizontal forces on the wheels equal zero, and you get a downward
force on the outer two wheels (we will talk about front/back ratio
of forces later) of F, a force on the inner wheels of -F (i.e. upward),
where F x track = (CG height) x (lateral force on CG). Therefore the
total "weight" transferred, F, per unit of lateral force, is dependent
only on the car's track and the height of the CG. Aside from wheel
spacers to increase track and/or lowering, you can't change it.

Now lets look at which end of the car gets what part of the force.
As a lateral force is applied to the CG and correspondingly to the
suspension mounts by the above free body analysis, the car rotates
about a fore-aft axis (connecting the roll centers, which by the way,
are the things which can be below the road surface). Don't worry about
where this axis is, for a first order analysis. As the body rotates
(or rolls), the corresponding springs compress and expand, increasing
and decreasing the forces applied to each wheel. To pick an example
which clarifies this, assume a car with arbitrarily stiff rear springs.
Thus only an arbitrarily small rotation is required to apply all of
the reactive force from the lateral force at the CG to the rear wheels.
Since the rotation is arbitrarily small, the forces on the two (normally
sprung) front wheels remain equal. Thus all of the "weight transfer" is
applied to the back, and the view in my previous post that the tire
nonlinearity changes the total available lateral force at the rear
(or, more accurately, a higher slip angle is required to generate the
appropriate lateral force) now applies.

Lots of things happen when transient behavior rather than steady state
is considered, but probably the important one from this view is that
the shock absorbers provide a reactive force which is dependent on
shock velocity, thus acting as "stiffer springs" during the transient.

1) I seem to recall that 10 PSI at idle for the 911 engines isn't abnormal,
   and that your concern should be suitable pressure at higher RPMs.  I'd

I just got back from 10 days in Tokyo, and all the 911's I saw were left
hand drive, which is not the correct side for Japan.  However, it may be
stylish to drive a non-correct drive side car there, although inconvenient
for tolls, etc.

Only recently did the US exports for Japan begin making right hand side
cards for Japan, although their own cars, for their own market have always
been right hand drive.

Maybe. If the low pressure is from leaks around the mains, then yes, it
will do the trick. If there is another cause (worn out pump, bad pressure
relief valve, etc.) then it won't help that, *BUT* it will keep you
from breaking a crank.

Elmer Fohey, my tame factory trained 30+ years experience Porsche
mechanic, says that *IF* the case isn't too bad, that line boring actually 
works better on the 911 than the 356/914. *BUT* that you need to make
sure the main webs are perfectly flat and contact each other correctly,
or it doesn't do any good at all. In fact the preferred method is to 
mill the case halves to get perfectly flat mating surfaces, then align
bore the mains and the intermediate shaft bore back to standard. but when 
you do that, you also have ot have the cylinder mating surfaces "decked"
to be flat and parallel with the centerline of the case, and then  add
spacers that are as thick as all the metal you took off both sides of
the case to keep the cam tower geometry correct on the reassembly.
In other words, it's best to find a new case....

Helicoils work on compression, and tend to only function well while held
under tension. If the tension lets up, they loosen up. Much like a
tautline slip knot -- *perfect* for relative static situations, but if
there's flex, forgetit... 

Timserts have threads that are "timed" --slightly different relative to the
threads of the insert tap. They provide internal tension to hold themselves
locked in place, by virtue of not quite fitting the hole they're installed
into. That's also why you need special tools to do the installation.

Yes. With a whole SC motor if you like...

Subject: Re: 993 test drive


I have had an hour behind the wheel of the 993 last week, but have
not had time to write meaningfully about it. I was interested
to see the post by Chris Hegarty on his impressions, and I agree
that this is a fine new motor car from Porsche, with exceptionally
agile, assured and neutral handling. I loved the new gearbox
as well, a low first and then five beautifully spaced and weighted
ratios. I found the level of noise, vibration and harshness much
reduced compared to the usual 911 experience. The braking system
is very effective, there always seemed to be more retardation
available from the brakes under all conditions. I was also amazed
at how forgiving the whole setup was. In situations where lifting
off in a 911 would be wobbly, you can lift off and brake in the
993.

As a non-power assisted 911 driver I found the steering to lack
the very direct and superbly weighted feel of my 88 Carrera. However,
the 993 steering has good feel and I felt was still sending the
same messages, but with a lower level of amplitude. You can correct
and adjust on the basis of those messages, but it takes less physical
effort to do so. Given the 2.5 turns lock to lock and amazingly high 
levels of turn-in available, the steering is in keeping with the rest 
of the car and is in balance with the weighting of the other controls.

My verdict is that this is an excellent moror car, my dealer is
saying delivery in April for orders placed now.

Subject: Magnesium Case Woes

    Bill-

    I have to agree with pb's posting re 10 PSI at idle as not
    abnormal for a 911, but with a few qualifications.  First- it
    depends when the pressure is measured- is it right when the engine
    is started, it is cold, and you are running 20/50 weight?  If this
    is the case then 10 PSI is an absolute problem (under theses
    circumstances I usually see over 40 or 50 PSI).  Second, if the
    pressure is measured at operating tempature (i.e., around 160
    degress), then I believe that 10 PSI or so at idle (1000 RPM) is
    fine.  Moreover, I have been told that idle pressure is
    not as important as pressure under acceleration or while
    cruising.  Under those circumstances, with the engine at operating
    tempature, I believe the rule of thumb is 10 PSI for every 1000
    rpm (e.g., at 4000 rpm your pressure should be around 40 PSI).

    Also, I understand your dilemma with whether to re-work the Mag
    case or graduate to an SC case/engine.  It seems that by the time
    you have finished paying the machine shop for all the
    "recommended" modifications on your case alone, you have paid for
    an SC engine.  As for fixing your alleged low oil pressure, I
    would wait to see what the bottom end looks like before assuming a
    line bore is necessary- after all, your bearings may be trashed
    which would certainly lead to low oil pressure and a set of
    bearings is a couple mortgage payments less than the machining
    costs for the propossed line bore, etc.

    I hope this helps.

Subject: Custom Jack Stands?

    Greetings Porsche Fans-

    While in Germany last spring I had the pleasure of visiting
    Hockenheimring for a couple of days of Carrera Cup racing and
    local Porsche club racing.  Needless to say, this was not only a
    great highlight of the trip, but probably of my life. The sounds,
    smells, and sights still linger and my pulse quickens whenever I
    think of them.  Well enough for nostalgia...

    While walking through the pit area (I had unfettered access to the
    stagging area and pit area!), I noticed this one RSR jacked up and
    placed on jack stands.  The jack stands were like none other
    I have seen before or since.  The stand consisted of a 1.5"
    aluminum tube (apparently) that slipped into an aluminum "collar"
    (about 1" deep) that was epoxyed to the underside of the car.  I
    believe that there were four such collars on the car, one each
    behind the front wheel wells and in front of the rear wheel wells.
    The bottom of the tube (which was probably around 10" long) had a
    base attached (around 3" in diameter).  I can't imagine that this
    system was the most stable, but it is a great setup for the track
    when you have to get under the car or work on the brakes and you
    don't want to rely merely on the jack to prevent you from having
    to do a 2000 pound bench press.  Has anyone out there seen
    anything similar?  Is it something that is commercially available
    or do you think that I was seeing some German's home handy work?
    If anyone is interested, I have a picture of the stand (I took
    only one shot, unfortunately) and could send out a copy.

    In closing, I want to thank all those kind souls on the net that
    have responded to my inquires over the past few months with their
    insight and assistance (and Stan for his dedication and
    expertise).  I thoroughly enjoy being a member of this
    forum and find myself actually missing work whenever I have not
    been able to access my P-philes mail over a long weekend. I hope
    that you all have a joyous holiday season and a prosperous and
    successful 1994 (and that we all get a chance to test drive a
    993 in the comming year!)

Can anyone help me figure out what has broken ?  Where it is ?
How to fix it ?

Basically the symptom is that the right turn indicator on my '87 911
is flashing about twice as fast as the left turn signal.

I have checked the bulbs and they seem OK.  Both front and back light up,
however, I am not sure if both the front and side lights in the front
light assemblies are supposed to light (only the front signals in
the assemblies actually light).  Other symptoms, possibly related,
(I can't ssay I ever tried this before), are that when I turn the 
indicator on with the engine off, the signal does not flash (is this
normal ?).  Also with the engine off and the turn signal on, both 
the front and side lights in the front assembly light up.

So, can anyone help me figure out what has suddenly happened to
cause this ?

Thanks for any and all help.

Subject: VW Porsche parts

I'm not sure whether Brian Abernathy intended his comments (about VW->Porsche
parts usage in 914) as an indictment or a cheer, but I'm happy to know about
any opportunity to keep good cars alive cheaply.  Thus I'd be pleased to know
about cases where JCWitless parts, VW parts, Audi parts, even Chevy parts are
a successful stand-in for expensive pieces of Porsche.  For instance, the front
bumper of my ice-green metallic Targa is an 80s Ford color that is a dead-on
match for stock and available in the spray-can rack at the auto store.

Similarly for procedures.  I don't mind paying a professional where the pro-
ject is out of my league, but I only pay myself $0.35/hr. when I'm in the 
garage, so it's inexpensive to take a little longer if someone can tell me how.
The Porschephile pieces that I print out, rather than just read for pleasure,
are the explanations of how ill-equipped humans without hydraulic lifts can 
solve real-world Porsche problems.  And how to separate the do-it-yourself
problems from the "take it to the shop, you don't want the heartache" problems.

So if you've been wondering whether to tell the net about how you made a new
rotor for a Marelli distributor out of a toy top and some epoxy, please do.

The best of the solstice season to all, most especially the oft-praised Stan.

    As far as I know, there have only been two types of alloy wheels fitted
to 914/4's.  If you're talking 5-bolts, I dunno.
    The "early" alloy is (I think) made by Pedrini.  All the ones I've seen
so far have a sort of rough finish.  Not shiny at all.  I like it.
    The other kind is often called the "2 liter" alloy, since it was part of
the sport group on the 73 2.0. . .  It was a forged wheel made by Fuchs,
who are the same people who make many of the 911 wheels (such as the
Windmills).  It looks a *little* like the windmill alloy from the 911's,
with alternating raised/lowered parts.  Many of this type of wheel on
914's seem to be replicas.  Mine are.
    Most replicas I've seen of the Fuchs alloy have the lower portions of
the wheel painted black; most original Fuchs have been bare or finished
metal all the way around.  The real ones should have "Fuchs" and a small
Fox-face logo (maybe just the lettering) somewhere on the inside--the 
side toward the rest of the car.
    If you want the real thing, ask for Fuchs or Pedrini.  Ask the seller if
it is a *real* Fuchs/Pedrini, or a replica.  Explicitly.  Make them give 
you a definite answer.
    As far as I know, both only came in 15" * 5.5" . . .  I've read that some
early 914s had 14" rims, but that may have been in steel.

Howdy folks,

I recently purchaced an '86 911.  Although I came close to buying a

the P-world.  One of my first acts was to remove the relay for the
warning buzzer.  Its real easy to find.  Turn on the key and follow
your ears.  I would like to remove the irritating up-shift light relay
also, but the only manual I have (Haynes) doesn't identify it.  Can
some kind soul on this list steer me in the right direction?

How about scheduled maintenance--do many owners of Motronic Carreras
do their own valve adjustments?  In looking things over, there
doesn't appear to be much room.  Do you use a feeler gauge to check
valve clearances or a dial gauge?

Is there anything inbetween the Hanyes manual (20 years in 200
pages) and the factory workshop manuals (megabucks)?

I looked for several months before buying this car.  Started looking
at late SCs, but quickly decided I had to have Motronic and Carrera
chain tensioners.  "87 seems to be a vintage year, but I couldn't
find one at a decent price.  My '86 is a red SOCAL car with 35K on

I believe that what you was was the optional air-jacks available 
for the new 3.8 RSR.  According to source I've read, it's available
as a $4,000 option, on some versions of the new RSR.  The system
works by applying air-pressure to 4 air-rams placed at the for 
corners of the car.  I'm sure you've seen indy-cars using the same
type of system.  One of these days, I'll have to do this to my 914!

A few years ago, in an act of desperation while chasing a front
suspension "clunk" in my '83 911, I replaced the factory rubber A-arm
bushings with plastic ones.  "Poly-graphite", from you-know-who.  They
don't just squeak, they creak, squawk, groan, and generally make my car
sound like an old truck.  (And gave no particular improvement in
handling, BTW.)  I lubed them at assembly, but not with the recommended
moly grease.  Is MoS2 a cure?  I don't mind *one* more front end
tear-down (and complete re-alignment), but I'm not eager for a year of
trial-and-error.  Does anyone know of a lubricant (or assembly
procedure, or whatever) that will keep plastic bushings quiet?

thanx,
Ed Mellinger

p.s. the "clunk" turned out to be the shock piston rods binding due to
side force caused by the top shock mount.  Regular greasing has been a
symptomatic cure.  Does anyone have experience with a more permanent
cure, say like, those spherical upper strut bearings that Automechanika
has been selling?

Too bad.  I have a '87 GTI 16V that uses Bosch CIS.  There is a separate

I think SOCAL is fairly expensive.  The owner started out around $28K &
got no replies.  He tryed again at 25K.  After looking at the car, I
offered $23K.  He wouldn't take it.  I walked, but he didn't have any
luck, so I got a call after a couple of weeks.  The car is basically sound,
with 35K miles, good compression and leak-down.  However, the owner
convieniently "forgot" about the parking lot concrete bumper that he managed
to run over and take out one of the front A-arms.  Other than that and a spotty
set of maintenance records, it seems basically sound.

Spending four months looking for a 911 gave me quite an education.  911
nomenclature is a world of its own.  I had to learn a whole new vocabulary.
For example, 7's & 8's or if you are *really* into it, 8's & 9's --all the
useless power stuff: let's see, are these 4-way or *8-way* power seats?
How easy is it to find 3rd gear?  And when I looked at maintenance records,
the numero uno, almost universal set of bills was for A/C repair, even for
post '85 cars that supposedly have the new, improved air compressor.

side wheel the inboard CV joint didn't spin!

Some leakdown numbers:

	This past weekend I checked a friends and my own SC, with 130,000 and 
100,000 miles, respectively.  Neither engine has been opened.  I used a 
leakdown tester I bought at the Experimental Aircraft Assn fly-in, which was 
manufactured for small aircraft engines.  In this case, the supply pressure 
was greater than 85 psi, and the leakdown regulator was adjusted to provide 
the manufacturer recommended 80 psi.  The instructions state that the FAA 
considers any cylinder with 25% pressure loss to be questionable.  
	The 130K car measured greater than 94%, except for number one cylinder 
which was 81%.  All loss appeared to be from air passing the rings.  The 100K 
car measured grater than 96% on all cylinders.  It was interesting to test 
two cars with similar mileage and find pressures relatively close.  I will 
someday test my S with 78,000 miles and compare the results.  
	 also plan to test my SC with a tester I built, and gave to another 
friend.  This one has been compared, albeit loosely, to a Snap-On tester.
	More as it happens.

Subject: 912 smog test: rich or lean?

Hi, my '69 912 recently passed its smog test.  Here are the numbers:

        HC ppm     CO %
Limit    900       6.00
Reading  272       5.89

I passed HC handily, but CO was a squeaker.

I'm told that HC and CO respond in opposite directions as one leans or
richens the idle mixture.  In other words, the value of one is directly
proportional to rich/lean, while the other is inversely proportional
to rich/lean.  Problem is, I can't remember which is which.

Put another way, from my readings above, am I too rich or too lean?  I
realize that adjusting in the *right* direction will lower CO and raise
HC.  Problem is, I don't know if I should richen or lean the mixture to
bring down the CO a little.

Carbs were recently balanced, and I have a smooth idle to die for.  Cold
start is a different story, as described in my previous post.

Lacking an exhaust gas analyzer, I'm hesitant to turn the idle screws
that 1/4 turn for fear I'll pick the wrong direction.

Thanks, one and all!

Subject: Solex 40PII accelerator pump adjustment

'69 912 w/ Solex 40 P II carbs here...

I've recently moved from Southern California to Washington State; now
that the temperatures have dropped, I'm noticing a few cold-start/warmup
difficulties that the warmer southern climate may have masked.

It takes a *lot* of gas pedal pumping to get a cold engine started.
A typical cold start (30F ambient temperature) sequence goes like this:

a. six pumps, turn key while pumping.  engine fires and dies.
b. three pumps, turn key while pumping.  engine runs five seconds
   and dies.
c. three pumps, turn key while pumping.  engine starts.  furious
   pumping keeps it alive but RPM's will not exceed 1500 (not a
   problem).
d. after 20-40 seconds, engine *will* rev to 3000RPM+, as though
   the carburetors suddenly get the message "so you want to go
   faster?!"
e. only after the engine will freely rev over 2000 RPM will it
   idle (and quite smoothly at that!).

The car runs quite rough and hesitates a lot for the first mile or two,
and drives like the total output is 20HP or so.  After that, it runs
really nicely.

First of all, is this normal??????

Last weekend, I suspected that the accelerator pump output is insufficient.
Neither of my manuals are clear as to which direction of the adjustment
increases (or decreases) pump delivery volume.  I'm figuring that 
accelerator pump output is low, which is why it takes so much furious
pumping to keep a cold engine from stalling.  I turned the adjustment
nuts 3 turns clockwise (thereby exposing *more* threads on the little
arm and compressing the spring more), but this doesn't seem to help
much.  Did I adjust in the correct direction?

Next, the hose that runs from the frame-tube heater duct to the air
cleaners is not connected.  Will installing the hoses make any noticable
difference in warmup?

Facts: carbs recently rebuilt, and accelerator pumps appear to be
delivering an adequate amount of fuel (and in the right place), though
I didn't actually measure the volume.  1750cc engine (NPR pistons and
barrels), 009 distributor, all else stock.

Thanks, Solex gurus, for any and all assistance.

Sorry about being unclear in my previous message.  It was NOT an

914 parts in strange places.  For instance, the rims that came with my
914, the standard slotted ones, are the same ones that came on the 
VW Sun Bug - a limited edition beetle.  

Hey - I don't mind interchangeable parts.  My Chevy Chevette has the
same electrical parts as the 1980 Chevy Impala Wagon - a car which seems
to be about half a block long!  But, at least I was able to recognize a
problem in one, because the same part failed the same way in the other!

I am NOT putting Porsche/VW down for this!  I have owned my 914 since
1974 (bought new), and before that, I owned several beetles.  There is no
way I would belittle them!

    Mike-

    Congrats on your trip to Germany- if you do it right you can
    really make it a Porsche pilgrimage.  I contacted the Porsche club
    of Germany before I went and they were able to provide the
    information on the event at Hockenheimring -- I recommend you do
    the same and see if anything is going on.  If you need some
    addresses I can dig them up for you- let me know and I can pull
    out a couple of letters that have other suggesttions (i.e.,
    museums, etc.).

    As far a transportation goes, I unequivocally recommend you rent a
    911 while you are there.  If your budget (like mine) does not
    permit such an extreme, then just rent an Audi or Opel (very
    reasonable weekly rates).  If you need the number of the rental
    place, I have it somewhere and can pass it on.  Since my trip was
    as much a Porsche pilgrimage as possible, I wanted to drive (gas
    is expensive) as much as possible.  But, train travel is an
    essential part of the European experience and if you get a chance,
    try a couple day trip by train, you just might like it (this is
    something I will do next time).

    If I can provide any information do not hesitate to drop me
    another note via P-philes or call me at the number below.  Hope
    I can be of some help on what promises to be a very memorable
    trip.  Seasons Greetings and pleasant Porsche/Germany dreams!!

Not drive in Germany? I think you will regret it. Just get yourself
an international drivers license and check into potential insurance
problems (or take it from the rental car place, at quite a premium).

I have to second the "avoid the small engine"  statements, I had a
MB 280 last time, and it felt quite strained at the speeds I wanted
to travel. (At least on the somewhat rare clear stretches of road)

My only real problem was not speaking German. Fortunately, you don't
have to do so to read a map and the signs are self-explanatory.

I didn't get to the Porsche factory :-( , I REALLY regret that.

This has come up before from time to time. There is a 5 1/2 x 15 VW
wheel which has the same bolt pattern as a 914 wheel, but it has a 
different offset. You sometimes see 914's with aftermarket wheels
using the VW offset, and they have very little clearance to the
fenders, especially in the back, even with relatively narrow tires.
Larger tire sizes such as 205/60-15 which would fit on the car with the
stock wheel offset have no hope on the VW offset wheels. Even 185/70-15,
which is a common upgrade from the stock 165-15, is potentially a
problem. I don't know about the Sun Bug in particular, so I suppose it
is possible it uses the 914 wheel offset rather than the generic VW
offset, but check carefully.

VWs & 914s
    Is the 914 a "real" Porsche?  As real as any.  Heck, Porsche
is as Porsche does.  Look at the way it corners, and tell me that
it isn't a "real" Porsche.  (So acceleration isn't the best in the
known universe.  So what?)
    As previously pointed out, VW and Porsche are both products
of the same mind--the main differences are image and evolution.
Early 356s were much closer to early bugs than my 74 914 is
to a 74 Type 4.  This is supposed to be a bad thing?
    I personally feel that my 914 is about 1/4 Bug, and that that
is a *good* thing!  I'm proud of it.

Subject: RE: 911 questions

Last night I looked up the schematics for the 86 carrera upshift light.
I have an 87 with the upshift light, but just ignore it.

Anyway, there ar 14 wires on the back of the tachometer, 8 are related to
lights, like turn signals, high beam and instrument lites and 6 connect
to a square in the tachometer with an electronics symbol on it labeled upshift
indicator.  

Of those 6, 2 go to ground (brown and the black/red), one goes to power
(gray), 2 go to the DME box (black and black violet) and one goes to the 
speedometer(green).  

At one time in the past, my "speed transmitter" coil in the transaxle went
bad.  I therefore had no speedometer, no cruise control and no upshift light!

The green wire that goes to the speedometer is also the wire to the "speed
transmitter" and the cruise control.

According to the schematic, the wire comes from the "transmitter" and goes to the
speedo (green), where it connects to 2 other wires, the green wire to the
upshift indicator and a black/brown wire that goes to the cruise control.

So, it would seem, that you could remove the green wire from the back of
the tachometer and not interrupt the pulses from the "speed transmitter" to
the speedometer and cruise control, but not have them reach the upshift
indicator.

I believe the connections from the DME from the shift indicator electronics
are purely outputs, since the death of my "speed transmitter" did not effect
the performance of my car.

Let me know if it works.

Hi gang,

My 72 914, which needs new weatherstripping (which the budget can't handle),
has moisture inside.  No real damage yet, but with temps going to 32F at 
night, and a lot of rain (yes, this is still California) I am getting
concerned about potential long term damage from the moisture.  I have been
able to stop the major leaks.  Does anyone know of a product for automobile
use similar to that used in bottles of medication to reduce moisture?  Other
than taking all my outdoor extension cords and a hair dryer to it I am at a 
loss as to what to do.  Garage is not an option, and the squirrels have 
eaten on the car cover, basically rendering it useless.  (I am trying to mend
the larger holes, but it is quite time consuming.)  Would open boxes of baking
soda work?

As a bit of a tangent, Paul is willing to sell his 84 944 to help fund

Assuming it is the same case bolt, I have done this on 2 different 911
engines with homemade tools. Actually, I did one of them myself, and lent
the tools to someone who did the other. The (stripped) stud which I dealt
with is in a section of the case where there is nothing behind it. I
therefore used an extended length drill of a diameter suitable as an 8 mm
tap drill (I don't remember the size) to drill from the stud side through
the far side of the case, using the remains of the old thread to assure
concentricity. I then took an 8 mm ( x 1 mm, if I recollect- match the
thread pitch on the existing stud) tap, and braised it onto a steel
extension. I initially tried welding it, but the carbon from the tap
migrated to the weld (I assume) and made it brittle enough to break.
I may have succeeded with welding by tempering it afterward, or by using
a HSS tap. In any case, braising worked. I used this extended tap to
tap new, deeper threads in the case, and bought a longer stud. As far
as I know, both engines are still leak free.

More recently I have seen someone selling a kit for a significant
amount of money (but a lot less than a case-split job, which is the
standard approach) to do this job. I don't remember who, or if they
use the same or a similar technique.

Double check the bright filaments in each bulb on the non-working side. 
 Your symptom says that one of them is inoperational.

Note that each bulb has a high watt filament, and a low one.  If the 
high (blinker, brake) fails, the low one may "try" to take it's place, 
but the blinker relay needs the full, correct load to operate properly.

You don't *need* a car very much, due to the excellent rail system and 
interconnects.  You don't even need to know German, as long as you can 
do strcmp's.  (One thing slightly different than the U.S. is road signs 
 - they tell you which city/town you're headed towards, not which 
compass direction.  Implication: you need to know which towns you want 
to go to, and what order they appear when travelling in a particular 
direction.)

But if you're a car enthusiast, and I'd bet you are, then you *do* want 
to rent a car!  Rates are higher than the U.S. ultra-discount, "drive 2 
weeks with unlimited miles for only $29.99" specials.  I picked up my 
Porsche there, so you might say I had a pre-arranged rental.  Autobahn 
driving is outrageously fun!  Just use your signal *religiously*.  And 
when you pull left to pass, make sure you check following cars' closing 
*rates* as well as relative position.

   I tried RAIN-X on my windshields and side and rear glasses too.
   Amazing that this product works beyond my expectation. When the
   water drops hit the glass, they don't stick! Instead, they break
   up into smaller beads and, due to the wind effect, these beads
   move upwards. You get the Star Wars effect (when the millenium
   falcon jums into lightspeed). On highways, you don't even need
   the wipers! The only disadvantage is that you have to get used
   to seeing water beads moving upward on the windshield at high
   speed. I got dizzy at first. At nite when there aren't many
   lights around, you don't even see the water beads moving, thus
   you only see the clear windshield despite the pouring rain.

   What does RAIN-X have to do with rims? Well, after finding the
   power of RAIN-X, I decided to do a little experiment. You know
   how brake dust accumulates on the Audi rims. The dust sticks
   like glue, especially after humid/wet days. So, I cleaned the
   rims with brush to get rid of all dust residue, then I applied
   RAIN-X on the rims. IT WORKS, now the dust doesn't stick. I still
   get a little bit of residue, but it is only about 10% of what
   I usually got! In addition to that, this little residue wash
   off easily when I spray water. I don't need brush anymore.

   I also applied RAIN-X on headlights. My hope is to avoid ice
   accumulation when I drive through a snow storm. No luck so far
   since it has been raining in RI.

Subject: What to do, what to do

You may remember a couple months back when I asked some rather naive
questions about having the 2.7l motor in my '76 911s TimeSerted due to
pulling studs.  Well, the time has come to make some decisions, so I'm
back for more advice.

Without going into the entire history of Just How Screwed a
Porsche-owner I Am, I need to supply some background.  Basically, I
got hooked up with the Repair Shop From Hell.  I had a complete
top-end rebuild done about 8,000 miles ago (new pistons & cyls, new
exhaust valves, etc.)  As I was poor at the time, and the rebuild
eventually came in at 1.7 times the original estimate, I was frantic
to contain costs.  When it came to the studs issue, I asked how badly
I needed it, and they told me that as long as the studs "took torque"
when they reassembled the engine things would be OK.  When the rebuild
was completed they told me that they had confidence in the engine's
integrity.  They were wrong.

So, now that I've got that off my chest, and have conveyed the info
that I have some fairly new parts in the engine, we come to the
current issues.  The engine is loosening up enough that I have to do
something.  My choices are:

1) Get rid of the car.  This is attractive, if I could actually find
someone who wants it.  By this time the problems are obvious, so I
have to sell it discounted, which is OK with me, but I wonder what the
market is for sick cars at any price.  Given that my wife is less than
enthusiastic about the car, making it go away has its advantages.

The car is in good shape otherwise (no rust, new windshield, injectors
& warm-up regulator), though the paint is somewhat tired.  From
watching the newspaper ads I figure that it might be worth $8-10K if
the engine was sound.  So, subtracting the engine-rebuild cost I
should offer it for $5-6,000 OBO.  Any takers?  Any thoughts on
whether a concerted sales effort would find a buyer?  Under the "sell
now" plan I don't want to be sitting on it for months.

2) Have the engine rebuilt or replaced.  Estimates for this seem to
run from $3,500 to $4,500, but I've heard that before!  Assuming that
I haven't hammered my nice new cylinders to bits by now, maybe I'll
come in on the lower side of this.  Opinions?

This alternative is psychologically difficult for two reasons: 1) I
hate to put yet another $nK into this same car (I worry that the curse
will strike again and once the engine is fixed the suspension will
fall off or something), and 2) this isn't really the Porsche I want to
keep for the rest of my life.  Ironically, part of why I don't want to
pay out for the rebuild is that now I am rich enough to buy a newer
911!  If I could convert this car into $5K in cash I would begin my
search for an 86-88 Carerra.

3) Rebuild it myself.  As I said in my earlier message, I have no
engine rebuilding experience, but always thought that I'd like to
learn how.  In fact, I used to think that I would go out and buy a
cheap Bug and practice rebuilding its engine before touching my
expensive Porsche, but I have come to realize that I now own an
inexpensive Porsche.

The idea would be to do the "easy" labor myself, such as engine
removal and tear-down, then send out the case to be TimeSerted and the
heads to be R&R'd professionally.  Hope that the cylinders and pistons
are OK, or that only one needs replacement.  Then back to me for basic
re-assembly, followed by some professional effort for hard things like
valve timing.

I assume that at minimum I'd get an education out of this effort.  I
wonder whether I would actually save any money?  Any opinions?

Two other things:

 - What kind of tool investment am I looking at?  What are the
big-ticket items I would have to add to my moderate tool collection?
Engine stand, parts washer, special wrenches/tools, shop manual all
come to mind.

 - Is there any local SF-Bay-area Porschephile who would be willing to
mentor me through this process?  What I think I need is someone I can
turn to for advice when I get stuck on some assembly step, or who can
evaluate the condition of my existing parts as they come off the
engine.  Any volunteers?

Well, this message is quite long enough.  Thanks in advance for any
advice.

Since the car clearly doesn't seal as well as a pill bottle, I don't think
dessicants are going to contribute very much, especially in quantities that
cost less than weatherstripping.  Best bet is to make sure the car is open
all day every dry day, and seal as well as possible with foam strips etc from
the hardware store.
Hope your holidays are dry.

Subject: re:smog test HC, CO

Pete,

I'm not a chemical engineer; I'll let the pros correct me if I'm wrong:

The hydrocarbons that come out the tailpipe are mostly made up of
unburned fuel.  Hence, a rich mixture will create more HCs on the smog
test.  To reduce them, you need to lean out the mixture.  In your
case, you could be richer, but to be honest, your HCs should normally
be way below the limit.

CO, as I understand, is also a product of oxygen starved combustion...
sufficient O2 lends itself to complete combustion and CO2 production
instead of CO.  So, if HC and CO react oppositely to richness, it's
news to me.

On the other side of the adjustment range, too lean (too much O2)
produces excess NOx emissions and can burn (oxidize) engine parts like
pistons and valves.  So, the advice is to run very slightly on the
rich side of stoichiometry.

Keep in mind that other factors are at work.  On cars with cat
converters, the CO AND HC will be reduced by further oxidation of
both, so you can get away with a slightly overrich mix.  Same goes for
cars with AIR pumps.  Also, significant HC output can come from other
sources, like oil leaking into the combustion system.

When I was zooming around Germany last year, most drivers used their
left turn signal to indicate that they were closing on you at a high
rate of speed or that they wanted to pass. I'll also second JBS' 
remark about passing on the right. You'll be subjected to some of
the strongest peer pressure and emabarassment you've ever experienced.
Sure wish we could teach Americans some *rules of the road* like they
have on the Autobahn......

Subject: What to do about WM York's 2.7

The 2.2T I worked on this summer was my third engine; first two were VWs.  I
just did the top end, but I think that's where most of the wacky tools are
needed.  I spent about $450 on tools and books, but one could easily spend more.
For instance, your basic $25 VW engine stand can't hold a Porsche case once the
crank is in, so you hold up the other end with a come-along from the ceiling or
a jack from the floor, depending on what you need to reach next.  Incidentally,
if you mount the engine stand low enough, you can work sitting down AND your
floor jack will reach the engine so you don't need 3 fit friends to dismount it.
$25 parts washer from JCWhitney was good enough for me -- I'm not in business.
Whitney also has good enough dial gauge for setting cams and valve lash, al-
though it's inches rather than metric.

Probably whether to rebuild it yourself turns not so much on dollar issues (al-
though you'll save $1000 even after netting out the tools) as on space in your
life.  Do you need clean fingernails on weekdays?  Engine takes about 9 times
as much space in pieces as together; do you have room?  How much do you pay
yourself when you're in the garage?  I found it hard, time-consuming, and very
rewarding.  About the third time I set the cam timing I finally understood
what I was measuring, rather than just followed the directions.  The fifth or
sixth time I was satisfied that I had done it right and that it was dead on,
not just within spec.  Then after I started the engine I had to redo one side
because I'd put the cam gasket in wrong.  You won't have the patience for that
kind of education if you have any deadline, or if your spouse will only talk
to you when you're clean.

Your mentor idea is terrific; hope you can find someone willing.  My own in-
stinct in your situation would be to keep the car, on the "better the devil I
know than the one I don't know" principle.  Maybe find a 78 engine and do the
engine swap myself if not the rebuild.  Please let the net know what you decide
and why.  Good luck!

Hello,

	Just for interest I thought I would summarize the responses I received

Just for clarification, I was referring to idle pressure of a fully warm engine
(~180F).

	Of the ten responses I received, 8 basically said that was normal
behavior for this engine and that the critical thing was pressure @ rpm.  Two
respondees seemed to think it was something to be concerned about.

Subject: 951 idle stabilizer problem

I have an 86 944 turbo with a deceleration problem that did not exist
before my mechanic replaced the idle stabilizer (Bosch part # 280 140
501). This was done to cure an irratic idle that changed from 800 rpm
cold engine and 2000 rpm upon warmup.  Now the car idles fine but
takes approximately six seconds to wind down from 3k to 1k upon release
of the throttle in neutral.  Under driving conditions this translates
to a very uncomfortable feeling of coasting when the throttle is
released and I find myself having to brake much earlier for cornering
than usual.  It takes a full 10 seconds for the car to slow from
50 mph to 40 mph in third gear. 
    I immediately took the car back to the shop and the mechanic told
me the car was just fine and I should stop worrying and just enjoy it. 
I have checked the throttle cam and cable to make sure they are
releasing and that is the extent of my technical ability at this time.
    I would certainly like to arm myself with some techical info and
some possible solutions to this problem before I return the car to

Happy Holidays, Clinton.

Your mechanic's suggestion that everything's fine is incorrect!

If your engine car *eventually* force itself to normal idle (940 rpm, I 
think), then you possibly have a vacuum leak.  The thick fabric-covered 
lines around the idle stabilizer become brittle and fracture with age; 
perhaps the labor damaged some of these.  Replacement, which should be 
done as a normal course of action, may require intake manifold removal.

I have the same car as you, and my vacuum lines snapped as I fiddled 
near them.  Good luck,

I have heard that a useful way to search out vacuum leaks is to use
an UNLIT propane torch, aimed at the suspect area, while the engine
idles. When the propane gets to the spot of the leak, it is drawn into
the engine, which accelerates a bit in response. Of course the idle
stabilizer will fight this, but there should still be some brief
effect. On the other hand, it sounds a little bit like looking for
a gas leak with a match. Does anyone have any experience or warnings
regarding this method?

Running rich is too much fuel, or not enough air (oxy).  In other

I believe that HC and CO do react oppositely to mixture.

As I recall, NOx is produced whenever N2 is present in any high
pressure combustion process (like inside an engine).  I don't 
know how much is affected by fuel mixture.

Running most (any?) combustion process lean (excess air) will 
produce eleveted flame temperatures.  I had always assumed that
this, not a combustion byproduct, was responsible for the (heat?)
damage from running lean.

Anyone know for sure?

BEWARE:

I once bought a Fram oil filter for a 928.  When I was under
the car replacing the old (OEM) one, I noticed that the Fram
filter was about an inch shorter than the OEM one - in this
case the filters were obviously NOT made by the same company.
At that point, it was too late to return it, so I used the
smaller Fram filter for 2000 miles, after which I replaced it
with the larger filter ($13) from the Porsche dealer.  I don't
remember how much the Fram filter cost.

I assume that a smaller filter provides less filtering, in
general, and is, therefore, inferior to a larger filter.
What's the conventional wisdom on this?


Also, Euroselect parts may provide even cheaper prices for
such maintenance items for water-cooled P-cars.

  OFFICE MEMO          914 steering problem                   Date:12/27/93
My mother drives a 1976 914-2.0.  She's 80 years old!  You should see her
buzzing around town in her little red sports car!  I drove the car over the
holidays, just to make sure it ran OK, and noted what I think is a problem with
the steering column.  The steering wheel and column can be moved up and down
and side to side between 1/2 and 3/4 inch.  It moves as a unit, kind of like
tilt wheel..... not normal on a 914.  Here's what I checked:  The big hex nut
under the horn button.  It was tight.  The two connections where the splined
rods connect to the universal joint under the dash.  The nuts were all tight. 
Also there is an allen nut at about 7:00 on the steering column just above the
lower lip of the dash.  I loosened the dash and tightened that.  It was a
little loose.  That didn't resolve the problem.  Has anyone experienced this in
a 914?  Based on what appeared to be sound essential linkages, it did not seem
like the steering wheel was going to  come off in my mother's hands in the near
future...or that the steering linkage was going to disconnect from the front
wheels.  However, I would like to be able to identify the problem, and if
possible help her get it fixed.  She lives in Texas, and I am in Michigan, so
distance is a bit of a problem.  BTW, does anyone know what that Allen nut at
7:00 on the steering column is for?   Thanks for any info y'all can provide.

Subject: Bill's head stud woes

   Special tools you need to rebuild a 2.7l 911;
 1. To get the motor disconnected; use line wrenches on the fuel lines,
     don't bloody up the fittings with open-end wrenches.
 2. to get the motor out; you'll need very tall jackstands, you have to get
     the car way up in the air to get the motor out from underneath it.
     You may also take off the exhaust first to gain more room, long 8mm
     allen wrenches will help reach thru the heat exchangers.           
     (Don't forget the speedo drive and groundstrap between the tranny and
     body before you start tugging hard).
 3. You don't need any special tools to get the tranny unhooked from the 
     motor.
 4. To get the cams off, you have to use the Porsche CAM holder and 5-side
     crowsfoot. Don't try a crescent wrench and 3-side crowsfoot (as you'd
     find at Sears or Snap-on). 
 5. To time the cams, you will need a dial indicator and the "holder." Cam 
     timing wasn't as hard as people had warned, just make sure you keep an
     eye on the dial indicator as you torque down the cam nut (it will change
     a lot, you can't rely on simply putting the adjusting pin in the right
     "hole.") You don't need Porsche's special tool to pull out the "pin,"
     the threaded end of a spark plug fits perfectly.
 6. To do valve lash adjustment, the 90' feeler gauge works great and is
     cheap. I tried the adjuster that fits with a dial gauge, couldn't
     figure it out at all.
   Other tips; 
 7. Buy a bag of 100 nylock M8 nuts, you'll need them all.
 8. Don't put gobs of sealant anywhere, especially the case halves; only a 
     thin consistent film is necessary.
 9. The Chilton's manual is good, also Bruce Anderson's book.     
10. Reinstall with the "carrera" chain tensioners and forget them.
11. Leave all the case work only for people experienced with 911 motors.
    You can UPS a 911 case, the case alone can be put in a cardboard box and
    mailed to someone knowledgeable enough (case and crank are either below
    70 lbs) to do a repair on your studs that will last.                      
12. If you have thermal reactors on the car, GET THEM OFF.

     Be careful as careful as you can be, watch everything. The first time
   I did my motor I got the right and left cam swapped, the motor wanted
   to run backwards. I got that fixed, and got it running--only to have the
   gear pin in the distributor come loose and fall into the motor, requiring
   to split the case again to retrieve the pin. The motor ran great           
   afterwards had very good power. But they will always leak.
     Don't put an SC motor in your car unless its free, the cost of the
   conversion puts plus the money you could get for your car as-is is about 
   same as buying a good used SC. Since you've already rebuilt the heads,
   even gotten new PCs, you probably are very near having a good car. If you
   can stand to take a loss on this car, a Carrera would be an awesome and
   reliable car.

Has anyone had NTW do a 4-wheel alignment.  They recently  installed 4 new

Subject: clutch chatter/shop manuals wanted/parts wanted

 
My '88 944 has some serious clutch chatter, especially when cold and in
reverse. The problem seems to go away almost completely when the car
warms up. Since the car has 90K+ miles I thought the clutch needed to be
replaced. Not so, says a reliable source (service manager at Brumos
Porsche), this doesn't happen when the clutch wears out. Unfortunately,
I had to move before the problem was solved. Anyone out there have a
similar experience or have advice on how to correct the problem.

On a separate note, I am relatively new to Porsches (3 yrs). I love the
cars but the maintenance is starting to hurt the wallet and I can only
see it getting worse. I am trying to do more and more of the maintenance
myself, but I'm not an experienced auto mechanic although I do have a
decent set of tools and some mechanical ability. Would it be worthwhile
for me to get the shop manuals for my car? I understand that Porsche
manuals are in series so I would have to get the 924 as well as 944 to
have a complete reference.  If the answer is yes, is there anyone out
there who would like to sell their manuals.

Lastly, while fooling around under my dash, I managed to break off the
arm rest/cassette storage cover. Anyone know of a reputable seller of
used Porsche parts who might have one of these?

Thanks in Advance.

Subject: Bill's studs & leakdown

Things I forgot to tell Bill, of Head Stud Woes,
	Rather that using the sometimes cumbersome Porsche cam nut crow's foot, I 
welded a small 1/2 in drive extension to a 1 7/16 socket and bored the socket 
to accept the cam holder.  It is a trick I got from Ted Robinson at German 
Precision, (408) 747-0728, and it works much, much better than the crow's 
foot.  Ted has several of these he lends to folks using his machine shop 
services.  You should also talk to him about how to ship cases to him; he has 
some special frames he lends.
	He also has made a tool for holding the straight-edge used during cam 
drive gear offset measurements.  Also works great.  As a companion, I bought 
a dial depth gage from Enco for $49, which makes measuring and adjusting the 
cam drive gears really enjoyable.  I make 5-10 measurements, turn the bar 
over, and make another 5-10 measurements to take any bar curvature out of the 
measurement.  The ground bar commonly used is specified for dimensional 
accuracy, but not necessarily for straightness.
	As a hobbyist, I invite comments by those willing to educate me (today 
only, I am moving and will leave the net for a while).


Also, would the person who thought my leakdown numbers indicated I should 
discard my leakdown tester please elaborate?  I have put a fair amount of 
thought into the functioning of and measurement practice with a leakdown 
tester, and think I understand the process reasonably well.  More education 
if I am found to be wrong.

Check the column bearing at the bottom of the steering shaft, near the

Subject: Re: "Tale Shifter" into a "Side Shifter

It helps if you have all the side shifter setup from a later 914.
I moved all the gears from the 6 into a side shifter box
to retain the 914/6 gear ratio.

I had to fabricate a stright rod from the U-joint to the side
shifter gear box. The bend in the rod from a 2.0 side shifter
will not clear the engine. I used a long VW-bus shift rod to fabricate
that.  Any solid tubing will do.  

With the side shifter, the rod in the shift tunnel has
a lot more left, right movement. There is an reenforcement plate
with a round hole in the tunnel.  With the linkages out and a small
mirror, you can see the hole.  The round hole in the shift tunnel 
is not big enough for the side shifter linkage's movement.
It makes a nasty sound every time I go into first.
With a round file and lots of patient I was able to enlarge
one side of the hole to eliminate the nasty grinding noise when
shifting into first.  The access to that hole is very poor.

Good Luck
Alfred

Depends on the individual doing the work.  NTW is a "least common 
denominator" approach.  They cosmetically trashed my Porsche wheels 
after saying they knew how to deal with alloys.   Very inexperienced 
kids (and stupid owner!).  They also need a custom tool to do the rear 
alignment correctly.

I also once had a "reputable" shop do my 951 alignment, to my spec.  
Well, the guy doing the job didn't like all the camber in the back 
(which is factory spec), so he dialed it out.  I came home with an 
unstable car that wanted to swap ends!  (I made them redo it to my 
specs, as originally requested).

I'd blow off NTW and find a higher quality shop with the tool and 
experience on 944/2 series cars.

Subject: Re:  Wheel Alignment by Non-Dealer

I had them do the alignment on my '87 951 and they accidentally did it
right.  I think that the problem is that they do not realize how exact
they must be. The computer gives a tolerance of an amount and it really
needs to be much much closer than that.  There must also be a perfect
balance between the two sides.

I will not take my car back there because they kinda tried to scam me
after the alignment.  They said that the car didn't need to be aligned
and it was the tires that were causing the car to drift to the right.  
They said that Dunlop would warrantee the tires and I could probably
get a new set of fronts for $100 each.  They were very convincing
and I almost went for it.  Luck was on my side so I refused and drove
my perfectly straight 951 onto the highway.

P.S. I clipped a coupon out of the paper and It only cost me $50 inc. tax.

I agree! Here in New Jersey, the slow drivers hang out in the left

fully understand the tirade, it was obvious that the person thought I

A friend of mine helped push a Mercedes about a kilometer to the

they don't break down on the Autobahn, or pay the consequences.
Running out of gas is considered about the most stupid thing a

"Goes away when warm" is a big clue. This could be nothing more serious than
condensation on the clutch plate or the flywheel, which evaporates once the
system warms up a bit. Do you park in a garage? I had this problem once,
and it cleared up when I did a couple of "hard starts" in the morning.
Do you slip the clutch a lot when starting from a stop? This would explain
the lack of chatter in the "already rolling" gears.

While I sympathize about the expense, I think that it is a much more
financially sound way of providing yourself with transportation than,
for instance, buying an Opel and throwing it away every three years.

That's a fine starting point. And when you do it yourself, two things happen:
you get to take pride in doing it right, and there is nobody else to blame
when you do it wrong. By all means get the manuals (I have shop manuals for
the 911, and all the other manuals for every other kind of car I can get
manuals for - it's the cheapest part worth buying).

Good luck with that - it does happen from time to time. You can't have

While I don't have a direct answer to your question, I'm sure that someone
on the list will. I do have a "hack mechanic" solution to offer, though:
the same thing happened on my Rx7, and I used some sticky-backed Velcro
to fasten it back in place. It's a better mechanical connection that the
lame clip that use to hold it down...

Subject: 928 water pump blues...

hi gang! happy holidaze!

well, i gave my 928 a tune up (filters(air, oil, and fuel), new plugs,
new coolant, new oil) for christmas. it runs great now, but it gave
me a present in return. it looks like my '79 has finally succumbed to
the dreaded water pump weevils. i've got coolant (brand new clean coolant!)
running down the front of the engine and off the bottom of the sump.
a few questions for the assembled wizardry on the list:

is the timing (coincident with coolant change) just coiincidence? or did
i cause this somehow?

i understand that water pumps were a weak point of early 928's (and 944s,
for that matter). did they improve the design over time? if i buy a
rebuilt pump, will i get any of the improvements? or should i really
pony up for a new one (arrrrrgggg.... ouch!)?

do i have to remove the harmonic balancer to remove the water pump?

i have replaced the camshaft belt in the past, so i'm familiar with the process
for getting that guy off and back on; are there any gotchas particular to
changing the water pump that i need to watch out for?

anybody familiar with Jay Pineau(sp?) in houston? he advertises one-day
turnaround on rebuilt water pumps, with 12 month warranty. anybody out
there dealt with him?

Same thing happened to me on a Golf once.  My guess is that it was 
close to failure, and letting it dry-cycle & run without immersion for 
a couple minutes killed the seal.

Actually, waters pumps are a weak point of *cars*!  A rebuilt Porsche 
pump is perfectly fine in my opinion.  In the case of water pumps, they 
replace seals and check for impeller damage, but that's about it.  
Simple devices, really.

Sarah,
There are four allen bolts that hold the steering shaft and wheel assembly to
the dash.  They are located under the dash and can be accessed through two
slots in the bottom of the dash.  The allen bolt you found holds the steering
housing to the  shaft cover tube (which is attached to the dash with the four
allen bolts).
I checked my '73 914 and noticed a little bit of movement in the wheel only,
which
I attribute to slack in the linkages.

Hello fellow P-philes, 

I am currently looking at picking up a '70 914 w/ 2.0l. I have test 
driven the car and it seems to run very well but there is one potential 
sore point: It seems somewhat more difficult to get into gear, shift, 
etc. than other ones (914's) that I have driven. The current owner has 
told me that early 914's had non-synchro 1st & 2nd gears. Would that 
explain why it seems so very easy to grind the gears or is it something 
easier to deal with (like adjustment of the shifter) or something ugly 
(the synchros are dying)? By the way, the car does not "pop" out of gear 
upon deceleration as is normally indicative of bad synchros.

Any advice is most graciously appreciated

NOTE: This REPOSTING is intended to serve as a WORNING:

Wheel ALIGNMENT by NTW!!

We have in my region a VERY friendly NTW dealer who hosts technical PCA
sessions on alignment. Recently a representative from Hunter Engineering gave
an overview of 4-wheel equipment used by NTW. One would be inclined to think
that the automation of the analysis and computer database on all cars including
diagrams of the specific Porsche models camber, caster and toe-in adjustments
is a guaranty against human "clumsiness". It is NOT. In short, the random 
chance of who might be doing your allignment (most enthusiastic with ZERO
experience) young chap is a formular for bad outcome. My stay at the NTW dealer
was from 8:30 am to well past 1:30 pm, witnessing the young lad stripping the 
toe-in bolt (rear 911 wheel) using the longest "mechanical" advantage extender
on this side of the GLOBE. 

Against my better judgement (grading, interfering, etc)
as a teacher and mentor I decided to put a stop to the "training" session and 
instruct him to loosen the nut first (i.e. before turning the eccentric bolt)
or call for HELP! In fact there was ONE knowing person who understood the 
problem. I came back months later to have HIM replace the bolt and reallign the
rear wheels. I could not bring my self to admit to a Porsche mechanic that I 
was duped. Finally, I must say I learned a great deal about  4-wheel allignment
from my long NTW visit. They let you stand in the arena and "witness" the 
procedure... The other alternative is to pay the $200 to the Porsche saivor.

Wow.  I have several things to say about this paragraph.
(1) NTW is generally pretty good, as standard tire shops go.  They have good
prices, good (but not excellent) service, knowledgeable people, a healthy
attitude, they let customers in the shop, and they like race cars.  Of course,
it's a chain, so my experience (mostly in Massachusetts) may not be
representative of your area.

(2) $99.95 is a good deal?  Even for a complete four-wheel alignment on a new
Hunter laser alignment rack, I can't imagine paying so much.  Ouch!  How much
does the dealer charge?!  Come to my house.  I'll do a good conscientious and
careful job for a mere $94.99!  I don't have a laser alignment rack, though...

(3) Your dealer is full of typical dealer bullshit if they think that nobody
else can do a good job.  Alignment is merely a process of turning a few bolts
and such using careful measuring equipment in a proper fashion.  Anyone who
properly understands the process and has the proper tools and knows the
handling characteristics of your car can do a good job.

(4) When you get new tires, you should always get an alignment.  That's for
a couple of reasons.  First, alignments do drift and will need to be reset
periodically.  Second, the tires will affect the alignment.  If you set the
alignment, change the tires, and measure it again, it will be different --
particularly if one set of tires is used.  Third, if the alignment is off,
you'll not only have bad (potentially dangerous) handling characteristics,
but bad tire wear -- protect your tire investment by getting an alignment.
Although, at over $100, maybe that's not as great an idea.

spoker;
1 - Bought a "real" replacement cover from AGLA - 49.00 - Junk. I couldn't
        sew this on if my life depended on it. Holes are way to small to find
        to lead a needle through. AGLA will sew one on - (89.00) but their 
        reputation and promises of return seem questionable.

2.- Bought a Wheelskin - 22.00. fits loosely in some spots. Doesn't look great.
        Wheelskins couldn't understand the loose fit in a few spots, and would 
        take it back. Wanted me to drop by and show it to them. Ughh - 

      
3 - My trim man would make a new custom one and sew it for 150.00 or so, but
        until it's done - who knows how good it will actually look.

        If someone has a good wheel out there - let me know what you might

Subject: linguistics


Christmas time is here.  This is the time when my mail level finally
drops below the 100 mark per day, and I have time to catch up on old
mail, even read a few usenet groups, and....holy cow, I have TWO kids
now, two porsches, and two - oh no, make that one - wife (I'm really
leaving myself open to blackmail now).

I got back as far in my personal porschephiles archive as the days
when color was being "discussed."  Fascinating aspect of human
behavior, this need to show off one's own knowledge: whether it's
which screw to turn on a Solex Carb (it's the smaller one) or how well
you can speak another language (Ja).  Some people are so
pathetic in their desire to be recognized as multi-lingual they even
put foreign language quotes in their signature lines!  How childish.

What prompted me to post this rhetoric was an interesting exchange
started by none other than moi (that's two foreign languages for those
of you keeping score).  I posted, actually quite innocently, a message
stating something like, "My car is a deep orange.  The funny thing is
that in German the word for my car translates literally as
`blood-orange' and in English the word is `tangerine.'  Something was
clearly lost in translation."

The response was overwhelming: At least twenty people pointed out that
this wasn't a funny thing.  About that many - desperate to show that
they lived in Germany, or had lived in Germany at one time, or that
they never lived in Germany but had read an email message from someone
who had - also pointed out that the German word is `blutorange' which
actually is the name of a fruit, a smaller version of an orange, with
a deep reddish orange color, that tastes very sweet and has a lot of
pits.  An even smaller number perhaps realized that this blutorange
fruit might very well correspond to the fruit we Americans call a
tangerine, possibly making the above linguistic comments a bit silly,
but this connection was swept aside with the clever, "but a blutorange
is darker than a tangerine."

Well, I did a little research, which consisted of going to a grocery
store near my house and pretending to be a German who didn't speak
much English.  I asked the fruit manager (Don't ask, don't tell),
"Hast zie die blutorange?".  I don't know about where you live, but
here in Troy, NY, grocery store department managers are required to
speak several languages, and thankfully German is one of them.  He was
quite polite, and directed me to the tangerines.  "Aha," I said in
English (not that I can't say "Aha" in German, but I didn't want to
overwhelm the poor manager, his German wasn't that good), "This is not
a dark enough color to be a blutorange."  The manager responded that
since it is winter, and tangerines are out of season, they must be
shipped before they are ripe.  He assured me that tangerines that
ripen on the tree are, in fact, a deep dark reddish - one might even say,
blood - orange.

Satisfied with the number of data points in my research, I returned
triumphantly to my computer and began to compose this message.  But
what point do I want to make, you ask yourself?  My point is only
this:  in German the word blutorange translates to the English word
(or perhaps American, I don't know what the pommies call it),
tangerine.  When I said there was something, "lost in translation," I
didn't mean it was the association with a reddish-orange colored
fruit.  I meant there was something lost in translation.  The german
word has two lexicographical roots, one meaning, "blood" and the other
meaning "orange."  The English word has two roots as well, one meaning
"a breakfast drink popularized by astronauts" and the other meaning
"not as bad a urine but not that good, either."  In English the roots
are not really recognizable, but in German they are.  

Granted most German words are comprised of other words so the sense of
it isn't as strong as saying "bloodorange" in English, but there is
still the built-in connotation of BLOOD in the German word which is
absent from the English, and that, you see, was my point.

This watered-down kind of translation is similar, BTW, to the
difference between German fairy tales and their American re-tellings -
but don't get me started on that one.

Happy New Year.

914 Fuel Pressure
Hi, gang!
    So, how do I check the fuel pressure on my 1.8L 914?
I know, I know, just hook in to the tap point on the fuel
rail, push the air box flap, and voila!  Well, where can I
get a gauge that will hook onto the *tiny* pipe that is the
tap point?  I've called several places around here, and I
can't seem to find anything.  Nobody seems to even have a
gauge I can measure up to 3 bar with!
    Help!

    DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!  The BS detector just went off the
scale.  914s have synchros.  Period.  However, most 914s that are on
the street today do *not* have 1st and/or 2nd gear synchros.  At least,
not much of them.  They wear out quickly, to say the least.
    If you've only driven later 914s (73+) the difference in shifting may
be due to the early tail-shifter transmission.  The linkage is quite a bit
longer than the later side-shifters, and more prone to problems.
    This 914 may be one to stay away from. . .

Subject: Jay Pineau - Water Pumps

I have highly recommended Jay Pineau's water pump rebuilds 
for a great while.  He may be a bit more expensive, but my personal
experience (2 successful installations) with his service
let me recommend him highly.

Remember, it wasn't too long ago that there were no other sources for 
944 waterpumps than the dealer.  At that time PCNA was getting $600 for
a new pump.  Jay was one of the first rebuilders to break the stranglehold
on that monopoly.  I can't speak for any others, but Jay gets my 
business *forever*.

The pump that Jay rebuilt for my 83 944 is still leakfree after 4 years and 
40K miles.  (BTW, Jay was working final tech at the autocross for the 
Cincinnati parade.  I introduced myself to him as a satisfied customer, and 
even pointed out to him his sticker on the pump.  He's a nice guy and a
real class act.)

As far as upgrades go, 944s went through a series of changes, mostly to keep
the timing belt from eating itself when it got loose.  If you use the 
newer style waterpump (with the plastic housing on the very front) you 
MUST get and install the update kit (which is a couple of nuts and a chrome
divider).

I can't speak for the upgrades on a 928.

  OFFICE MEMO         911 Windshield Antenna                Date:  12/29/93
Our '88 and '89 911's have the radio antenna-in-the-windshield
"feature".  Reception is horrible, of course.  The '84 I had with the
factory telescoping antenna was far better.  I have asked various
specialty shops about alternatives, short of drilling and installing
a mechanical one, and the advice has been "there is no alternative
that's any good".  A few claimed some of the blame is the factory
radio, but a very good after-market stereo in the '89 hasn't made
any real difference.

Has anyone had any success in getting better reception without
resorting to drilling?  If the best solution is a normal antenna,
any advice on brands?  Caveats on installation of a factory-like
antenna (location, avoiding rust, seals, etc.)?  I can't bear the
thought of drilling a hole in the fender so I will probably have
someone else do it.  Advice on reputable place in the S.F. bay area?

Thanks for any help offered.

Your produce purveryor may well have been a cunning linguist,
but it is apparent that he is a cunning salesman as well.
A tangerine is not the same as a blood orange, regardless of
how long you leave it on the tree. A tangerine is a loose-skinned
orange hybrid, while a blood-orange is a much tighter skinned
orange hybrid derived from the navel orange, which is quite
a separate breed line from the tangerine.

If you are that easily satisfied, how would you react if ten or twenty
people all assured you that a clearance of .100" is "just fine" for
your crank journals? Wouldn't you be tempted to refer to a more
authoratative source? Perhaps the shop manual? A botany of citrus
fruits reference is the appropriate source of such botanical information
if you lack personal experience, which the fellow in the fruit store
clearly either lacked or was unwilling to reveal in hopes that you
would buy something that he in fact is able to stock.

You can translate it to whatever the hell you want, and still be wrong -
blood oranges are not available on the US market: the typical American
reaction to a blood-red orange is along the lines of "Eeewwww, GROSSS!
I'm NOT GOING TO EAT IT!!!" so they don't bother to import them. The
fruit markets in Italy are well stocked with tangerines, blood oranges,
navel oranges, and several other hybrids that are also unavailable in the
US market. Head on over there and check it out - last time I was there,
I got passed by a brand-new 911 Club Sport (roof up, too bad) at warp speed.

> When I said there was something, "lost in translation," I

The problem lies not with the languages between which the translation
was attempted, but with the translator and the process of translation
that was carried out. A Blood Orange is NOT a tangerine.

And the same from me!

I bought a pump from him years ago when he seemed to be the only one
around offering rebuilds.  I would venture to guess that Pineau has as
much, if not more, experience rebuilding these pumps than anyone.  The
transaction left me with a favorable impression (the rebuilt pump was
shipped promptly and the core exchange went fine).  Unfortunately, I
sold the car too soon afterwards to be able to report on the longevity
of the rebuilt pump.  Given the good experience with Pineau, and the
fact that I don't know who is rebuilding the pumps that many
aftermarket suppliers are offering now, I would probably buy from him
again next time.

Subject: VW wheels for 914

Some information concerning the VW wheels issue:

1.  The wheels in question were for the "Sport Bug" which
      may or may not be the same as the "Sun Bug"
      -- perhaps irrelevant......

2.  The following is quoted from the Bentley Manual for
      Bugs & Ghias '70-'79:
      "Karmann Ghias have 4-1/2 x 15 wheels.  As of March,
      1972, this rim size has also been used on the other
      models covered by this manual [i.e. Bugs]...
      ...K Ghia wheels have a 46mm offset, 1974 Super
      Beetle wheels have a 41mm offset, and the wheels for 
      other late models have a 34mm offset.  The 4 x 15
      wheels used on cars other than the K Ghia prior to
      March, 1972 have a 40mm offset.  The 1973 Sports Bug
      has 5-1/2 x 15 wheels with a 26mm offset.  The 1974
      model has the same rim size with a 34mm offset."

3.  I do not know what the stock offset is on 914's.

4.  I had Sport Bug wheels with 26mm offset on my
      non-Sport Bug.

5.  Warning:  It is very difficult to mount tires on
      those wheels.  They have a very wide shoulder
      for the tire bead on the outside of the rim.
      Most tire machines have a tough time getting tires
      onto them.  I had brand new Michelins trashed by
      a gorilla who was obviously perturbed that I tried
      to warn him...

6.  If 26mm offset is what you want, and want cheap VW
      rims, avoid the tire mounting hassle and buy the 
      5-1/2 rims from J.C.Whitney.  I got them several
      years ago for less than $30 each.  I think they
      might say "Primed" and "Chrome".  The primed ones
      turned out to be very nicely painted white with
      red and blue pinstripes on the outside.  Not bad
      for the price and no tire mounting hassles.

7.  Another alternative for cheap wheels is a company
      that advertises in "Sports Car" (SCCA mag).  They
      say:  Set of four, any offset for about $170.
      these are steel wheels, star pattern, in many sizes.
      (13's, 14's, 15's in 5,6,7,.... widths.)  If you 
      want more details, I can look it up and get it onto
      the net.

8.  Good Luck!

Tom,

I went the AGLA replacement leather cover route about 3 or 4 years ago because
mine was "falling apart".  I'll admit that it is not the easiest thing to
install but it is most definitely "DO"-able.  I'd say that after I had the
Wheel off and in my house (That's the only way I'd recommend doing it), it took
me less than two hours to complete.  It still looks great today.  $49.00 and a
couple hours of sweat sure seemed better than $150.00 or more to me.

I would recommend that if you change your mind and try this approach, you go
out and buy a very heavy duty sewing thimble because pushing that needle
through the holes in the leather without one will result in an extremely sore
finger or thumb (or both)!

I have no preconceived ideas about AGLA's reputation so I have no ideas about
what kind of job they do installing it for you but I'd bet that if they have
done a few themselves, they should be able to do an excellent job.

Good luck in whatever you decide to do.

Simple devices yes, but you have to be aware of the accompanying improvements.
I bought a *pre-owned* 924s that had a new water pump at c. 70k. Unfortunately,
unknown to me (and whomever did the installation) was the fact that there was
an upgrade kit which involved installation of balance shaft guides (I think
I've got that right).  Non-installation or use of the upgrade kit resulted, for
some reason, in the deterioration of the Woodruff key at the end of the balance
shaft allowing the cog wheel for the balance shaft belt to slip off the end of
the shaft to the point where it put a quarter moon slit in the belts cover.
Discovered this luckily before either of the belts broke but still paid big
bucks to have the mess repaired (and it was about time to replace belt).  The
water pump still works fine but...

have experience with Porsche's (all models).  I'm skeptical because my dealer,

Subject: clutch chatter/shop manuals wanted/parts wanted

 
My '88 944 has some serious clutch chatter, especially when cold and in
reverse. The problem seems to go away almost completely when the car
warms up. Since the car has 90K+ miles I thought the clutch needed to be
replaced. Not so, says a reliable source (service manager at Brumos
Porsche), this doesn't happen when the clutch wears out. Unfortunately,
I had to move before the problem was solved. Anyone out there have a
similar experience or have advice on how to correct the problem.

On a separate note, I am relatively new to Porsches (3 yrs). I love the
cars but the maintenance is starting to hurt the wallet and I can only
see it getting worse. I am trying to do more and more of the maintenance
myself, but I'm not an experienced auto mechanic although I do have a
decent set of tools and some mechanical ability. Would it be worthwhile
for me to get the shop manuals for my car? I understand that Porsche
manuals are in series so I would have to get the 924 as well as 944 to
have a complete reference.  If the answer is yes, is there anyone out
there who would like to sell their manuals.

Lastly, while fooling around under my dash, I managed to break off the
arm rest/cassette storage cover. Anyone know of a reputable seller of
used Porsche parts who might have one of these?

Thanks in Advance.

Subject: Bill's studs & leakdown

Things I forgot to tell Bill, of Head Stud Woes,
	Rather that using the sometimes cumbersome Porsche cam nut crow's foot, I 
welded a small 1/2 in drive extension to a 1 7/16 socket and bored the socket 
to accept the cam holder.  It is a trick I got from Ted Robinson at German 
Precision, (408) 747-0728, and it works much, much better than the crow's 
foot.  Ted has several of these he lends to folks using his machine shop 
services.  You should also talk to him about how to ship cases to him; he has 
some special frames he lends.
	He also has made a tool for holding the straight-edge used during cam 
drive gear offset measurements.  Also works great.  As a companion, I bought 
a dial depth gage from Enco for $49, which makes measuring and adjusting the 
cam drive gears really enjoyable.  I make 5-10 measurements, turn the bar 
over, and make another 5-10 measurements to take any bar curvature out of the 
measurement.  The ground bar commonly used is specified for dimensional 
accuracy, but not necessarily for straightness.
	As a hobbyist, I invite comments by those willing to educate me (today 
only, I am moving and will leave the net for a while).


Also, would the person who thought my leakdown numbers indicated I should 
discard my leakdown tester please elaborate?  I have put a fair amount of 
thought into the functioning of and measurement practice with a leakdown 
tester, and think I understand the process reasonably well.  More education 
if I am found to be wrong.

Check the column bearing at the bottom of the steering shaft, near the

Subject: Re: "Tale Shifter" into a "Side Shifter

It helps if you have all the side shifter setup from a later 914.
I moved all the gears from the 6 into a side shifter box
to retain the 914/6 gear ratio.

I had to fabricate a stright rod from the U-joint to the side
shifter gear box. The bend in the rod from a 2.0 side shifter
will not clear the engine. I used a long VW-bus shift rod to fabricate
that.  Any solid tubing will do.  

With the side shifter, the rod in the shift tunnel has
a lot more left, right movement. There is an reenforcement plate
with a round hole in the tunnel.  With the linkages out and a small
mirror, you can see the hole.  The round hole in the shift tunnel 
is not big enough for the side shifter linkage's movement.
It makes a nasty sound every time I go into first.
With a round file and lots of patient I was able to enlarge
one side of the hole to eliminate the nasty grinding noise when
shifting into first.  The access to that hole is very poor.

Good Luck

Depends on the individual doing the work.  NTW is a "least common 
denominator" approach.  They cosmetically trashed my Porsche wheels 
after saying they knew how to deal with alloys.   Very inexperienced 
kids (and stupid owner!).  They also need a custom tool to do the rear 
alignment correctly.

I also once had a "reputable" shop do my 951 alignment, to my spec.  
Well, the guy doing the job didn't like all the camber in the back 
(which is factory spec), so he dialed it out.  I came home with an 
unstable car that wanted to swap ends!  (I made them redo it to my 
specs, as originally requested).

I'd blow off NTW and find a higher quality shop with the tool and 
experience on 944/2 series cars.

Subject: Re:  Wheel Alignment by Non-Dealer

I had them do the alignment on my '87 951 and they accidentally did it
right.  I think that the problem is that they do not realize how exact
they must be. The computer gives a tolerance of an amount and it really
needs to be much much closer than that.  There must also be a perfect
balance between the two sides.

I will not take my car back there because they kinda tried to scam me
after the alignment.  They said that the car didn't need to be aligned
and it was the tires that were causing the car to drift to the right.  
They said that Dunlop would warrantee the tires and I could probably
get a new set of fronts for $100 each.  They were very convincing
and I almost went for it.  Luck was on my side so I refused and drove
my perfectly straight 951 onto the highway.

P.S. I clipped a coupon out of the paper and It only cost me $50 inc. tax.

I agree! Here in New Jersey, the slow drivers hang out in the left
lane and the faster drivers use the virtually-empty right lane. It's
totally nuts! The times I've been over in Germany, I really 
appreciated their lane discipline.

Speaking of peer pressure, I got yelled at, as a pedestrian in
Cologne, for not waiting for the "little green man" to walk, even
though there wasn't a car to be seen for blocks. Although I didn't
fully understand the tirade, it was obvious that the person thought I
was setting a bad example for the children. After being there for a
week, I thought crossing the road with "double red men" must be
punishable by death, because it just isn't done - regardless of how
clear the roads are.

A friend of mine helped push a Mercedes about a kilometer to the
closest exit from the Autobahn when it broke down - to keep from
getting a fine! Drivers are expected to maintain their cars so that 
they don't break down on the Autobahn, or pay the consequences.
Running out of gas is considered about the most stupid thing a 
driver can do, and is punishable by an even bigger fine.

These things seem funny to us, but the Autobahn really works!

"Goes away when warm" is a big clue. This could be nothing more serious than
condensation on the clutch plate or the flywheel, which evaporates once the
system warms up a bit. Do you park in a garage? I had this problem once,
and it cleared up when I did a couple of "hard starts" in the morning.
Do you slip the clutch a lot when starting from a stop? This would explain
the lack of chatter in the "already rolling" gears.

While I sympathize about the expense, I think that it is a much more

That's a fine starting point. And when you do it yourself, two things happen:
you get to take pride in doing it right, and there is nobody else to blame
when you do it wrong. By all means get the manuals (I have shop manuals for
the 911, and all the other manuals for every other kind of car I can get
manuals for - it's the cheapest part worth buying).

While I don't have a direct answer to your question, I'm sure that someone
on the list will. I do have a "hack mechanic" solution to offer, though:
the same thing happened on my Rx7, and I used some sticky-backed Velcro
to fasten it back in place. It's a better mechanical connection that the
lame clip that use to hold it down...

hi gang! happy holidaze!

well, i gave my 928 a tune up (filters(air, oil, and fuel), new plugs,
new coolant, new oil) for christmas. it runs great now, but it gave
me a present in return. it looks like my '79 has finally succumbed to
the dreaded water pump weevils. i've got coolant (brand new clean coolant!)
running down the front of the engine and off the bottom of the sump.
a few questions for the assembled wizardry on the list:

is the timing (coincident with coolant change) just coiincidence? or did
i cause this somehow?

i understand that water pumps were a weak point of early 928's (and 944s,
for that matter). did they improve the design over time? if i buy a
rebuilt pump, will i get any of the improvements? or should i really
pony up for a new one (arrrrrgggg.... ouch!)?

do i have to remove the harmonic balancer to remove the water pump?

i have replaced the camshaft belt in the past, so i'm familiar with the process
for getting that guy off and back on; are there any gotchas particular to
changing the water pump that i need to watch out for?

anybody familiar with Jay Pineau(sp?) in houston? he advertises one-day
turnaround on rebuilt water pumps, with 12 month warranty. anybody out
there dealt with him?

Same thing happened to me on a Golf once.  My guess is that it was 
close to failure, and letting it dry-cycle & run without immersion for 
a couple minutes killed the seal.

Actually, waters pumps are a weak point of *cars*!  A rebuilt Porsche 
pump is perfectly fine in my opinion.  In the case of water pumps, they 
replace seals and check for impeller damage, but that's about it.  
Simple devices, really.

Sarah,
There are four allen bolts that hold the steering shaft and wheel assembly to

slots in the bottom of the dash.  The allen bolt you found holds the steering
housing to the  shaft cover tube (which is attached to the dash with the four

I attribute to slack in the linkages.

Hello fellow P-philes, 

I am currently looking at picking up a '70 914 w/ 2.0l. I have test 
driven the car and it seems to run very well but there is one potential 
sore point: It seems somewhat more difficult to get into gear, shift, 
etc. than other ones (914's) that I have driven. The current owner has 
told me that early 914's had non-synchro 1st & 2nd gears. Would that 
explain why it seems so very easy to grind the gears or is it something 
easier to deal with (like adjustment of the shifter) or something ugly 
(the synchros are dying)? By the way, the car does not "pop" out of gear 
upon deceleration as is normally indicative of bad synchros.

Any advice is most graciously appreciated

Subject: Wheels for sale, photos available

Okay Everyone,

I finally have pictures of the wheels I posted an ad for about a 
month ago.

Heres the info:

4 wheels:  6 x 15 Fuchs from '69 911 (23.3 offset)

Polished spokes with black web.

Condition:  Good.  No major dings (I spotted one or two 
            *small* scratches).  Straight.  The photos show a
            bronze tint that (I think) is a reflection of the 
            side of the house and some water marks (I'd just
            rinsed them off).  Not concourse.

History:    Came off my girlfriends old 911 when she converted 
            to 7's and 8's.  Been in garage since, about 5 years.

Price:      $500/4  Buyer pays shipping.

I have two set of individual photos (4/set) and 4 sets of group 
photos (1/set).  I will send these out to the first 6 responses.

First two get the indivual photos, next 4 get the group photos,
unless otherwise requested.

Send a SASE large enough to hold a 4x6 picture to:

      Soren LaForce
      244 Franklin St.
      Mountain View, CA. 94041

I don't know how much 4 photos weigh, but you should probably

They were having a sale, and I got the last one.  I did receive

Subject: re; Tom's 911 steering wheel

 Regarding Alan Gun's leather wrap for the 911 wheel (now AGLA), I've had
  experience twice with it; the only problem with the wrap is that AGLA
  tries to sell the product too cheap--they should only sell it installed.
  I gave the kit/wheel to the one with the most sewing experience in the 
  world---my dear mum---but notwithstanding the experience of a billion       
  quilts the wheel just okay. My nearly competent brother tried one on his    
  911, it came out looking pretty shabby (part of the problem was likely the  
  reweld around the broken spoke...). 
 I think if AGLA installed the kit it would look nearly like the factory      
  wheel. The wrap itself is definitely a quality piece, he obviously went to
  some expense tooling a die, there is no way any shop could take scissors
  and make something that looked as good. $90 for installation sounds high at 
  first, but my quotes at upholstery shops estimated 2 hours at $35/hour, it  
  would be the first one they'd done, and they couldn't guarantee the result. 
  AGLA turnkey at $140 is still cheaper than any used/worn wheel you'll find  
  thru the salvage yards and about the same price of any aftermarket wheel.
    'Course, if anybody has a clean or unbroken 3-spoke wheel for an '83 SC,

I wasn't going to get into this fray, because I thought the conversation had
gone on long enuf before it was resurrected.  However I do remember there was a
purple color in the 70's called Aubergine. Aubergine, of course, is the French
word for eggplant.  Aubergine is also a lot more fun word than either Purple or
Eggplant.  Rolls off the tongue nicer, dontcha know.  Now, was that the
original "German" name for that color?  Or was that a translation for the
English?-  French?-speaking market? I would spicion there are several factors
that enter into choosing and translating names of things like paint colors. 
And one of those might be: Is it fun? or: How does it sound?  Kind of like the
Americans do with model names.  Porsche doesn't use model names that much, so
they have fun with paint color names.  Whaddaya think?  BTW does anyone know
how to say Eggplant in German?

Ken,
        Maybe the quality has changed, but the piece of leather they sent
was very poor quality. The holes barely even visable to the naked eye. The
Shift
boot cover I also got lacked the shift pattern on top of the boot, and the
leather cap in place wasn't even straight. The leather dash cover I bought
( boy am I a sucker.. 150.00) had a crooked seam, a grain defect in the center
and took a extra long time to arrive. Based on those experiences, and that
of a fellow porschephile who posted a previous note - they WILL NOT get any
future
business from myself.

        Sew time on a full kit - spokes and perimeter in less than 2 hours
says to me you definitly could have a hidden talent. 4-5 hours doing a lace
pattern seems to be the norm.

Happy Holidays !
Tom

Lance,
I have a '90 C4 and I agree with you completely!  I did replace the radio/tape
player with a radio/CD player and it help somewhat on the music by playing 
CD's instead of cassettes.  I also DON'T want to drill any holes, so I'm 
thinking about replacing my speakers next.  But I don't know which are good but still retain the "stock" look.  Anybody else have any better solution for the 
reception on "our" radios?

Lance, if you find out about a reputable place in the S.F. bay area, can you 
let me know too.

Thanks,

There is some magic bushing lubricant which Automotion sells for just
this application.  I forget what it is, but one of the guys at the shop
mentioned recently that it works very well: stays put and stops the

Very pretty colour.  Aubergine is, to the best of my knowledge, the
correct German name for the colour.  It is also the German word for
eggplant.

On my first trip to Germany many years ago, I had to make my culinary
piece-de-resistence for my hosts: eggplant parmagiana.  And I had to go
shopping for all the ingredients, all by myself.  Obviously, the first
step was to sit down with my Schoeffler-Weiss and translate all the
ingredients' names.  I learned that locating mozzarella cheese in
northern Germany is a pretty neat trick.

It's a silicon paste grease. Similar to what you use to seal heat sinks

I don't have any ideas on the antenna, as I have a regular one, but I did
replace my original (I think) blaupunkt rear speakers with Polk M300s
which are slightly smaller, so the outline and indentation of the old
speakers can be seen if you look closely, however the sound is great, the
deck is a sony 5260 detachable head cd with 20 watts per channel, but for
the rear speakers, I use the rca outs to a coustic 100 watt/channel amp. 

I've had about 2 skips so far,  usually on pretty big bumps.  I have a '77
911s, so the stock antenna is working great for reception in n. calif.,
but eventually I'd like to replace the stock antenna with an electric one.

Oddly enough, the word for eggplants in German is "Auberginen", almost the

You do need to remove the poly-whatever bushings from their carriers
to smear the goop in their bore, that is, at the bushing/roll bar
interface.

One trick is to install a Zerk fitting into the bushing carrier, and
drill a hole through the bushing to its bore.  You can then lube it
using a grease gun, and without any disassembly.

I believe the answer is "no", as the newer block has tapped castings to 
mount the tensioner to, while the '86 block does not.  I could be 
wrong, but I think that's the answer.

No, just dump it in.  Synthetic is 100% compatible with Dino juice.

I'm sure that with the right parts and perhaps some machining this can
be done.  I don't know anyone who has done so.  Btw, Porsche calls it
a "mechanical belt tensioner."

Since the new tensioner does not, to my knowledge, reduce the likelihood
of catastrophic belt failure, and since you need the tension-checking
tool for the balance shaft belts, I can't see any reason to attempt
the upgrade.  Perhaps someone knows better, that there is some advantage
to the mechanical tensioner.

No, not at all.  I use synth in the summer, mineral in the winter.  (Why
pay $4 a quart for something you don't need?)  It is also quite OK to,
say, add a quart of mineral oil to a nominally synth oil car, for 
example, if you find yourself a quart low in the middle of nowhere.
