Saw this in the local Atlanta paper. Seemed like a reasonable price.
"Porsche 356C 1963 Red/black $6000 Hilton Head South Carolina 803-837-5801"
Usual disclaimers apply - I have no interest in this, just thought someone

Hi Bill, I have an 85.5 944 and replaced the engine mounts myself. All I 
used in the way of tools was car ramps and a floor jack, I also had a 
engine hoist but you could get away with just the trolley jack if you do 
not have access to one. The Hanes manual talks about removing stabalizer 
bars and suspension stuff, I looked at it from a different angle. I 
removed and installed both mounts from the top. I did remove the arms 
that connect to the engine and mounts. The job only took an evening to 
do. Good luck.

Subject: 944 Optional Wheels

Hi everyone,
I'm wondering about the wheels on my recently-acquired '84 944.  I have the 
optional forged alloy wheels (7Jx15 front, 8Jx15 rear).  The tires are 
Michelin 215 60 R15 93V all around, but the fronts read "XGT V" while the 
rears read "Sport XGT V" Does the word "Sport" differentiate the wheel sizes?  
What does having these wheels imply for rotating the tires, which is front 
to back, never side to side(?) I would have thought the rear tires would 
have
numeric markings showing that they are wider....  As you can tell, I'm 
ignorant on this subject.  Can someone enlighten me?
Thanks!

I saw in the recent Tweeks catalog a ABS moulded dash cover that fits
right over the orig cracked vinyl dash. For $79 a piece. I thought that
was a nice price for a nice thing. Agreed it is not "authentic - period
looking" vinyl. But being moulded ABS with a "contemporary" finish to
it, me thinks its even better (from the photo).

While at it I plan to replace my broken side mirrors with the
(non-electric) Baby-Turbo model (also Tweeks, some $20-odd each), or
the baby-racing model ($39 ea). I might then paint it matching red, or
might just leave it black. I am currently accepting votes - should I
paint 'em or not ? :-)

I am also planning to get a set of seat covers (another $79, to hide
the split foam on the seats) to get my 924 on the road on budget and
quickly. All said about $240.

Just got back from a trip to Italy, and found my Bosal exhaust manifold
from Imparts is not yet delivered to the mech :-( .. so car is still
with him.  Hopefully in another week. ...

Anybody has got these ABS dash covers ? Any opinions on them ? Tweeks
has them for several P-car models, incl several 911 variations, 944,
924 etc.

Subject: Re: Wandering C2.....ain't fixed  but go



Hi Steve,

As someone else already mentioned, corner balancing wouldn't hurt.  The
C2's are pretty easy to corner balance because of the threaded perches
on the coil-overs (at least with the M030).  You should not need short
springs just to get the car's ride height adjusted to properly.

It would be interesting to find out what kind of camber and caster
specs the mechanics were using to set it up.

Also, you mention a "front-end" alignment only?  If the rear alignment
wasn't checked as well and the mechanic is trying to sell you
lowering springs, you may want to consider another mechanic.

The RS America that was used in the press tour was guards red with
sunroof and radio, but w/o A/C (as far as I can discern from the photo
in the Jan '93 issue of Your-a-pee'n Car).  This is also the same car
that appeared on cover of the December '92 Panorama.

If this is the press tour car, it might have some additional collector
value, but it also was probably thrashed pretty well by the press corps.
If this is the car, Be sure to check out the condition of the clutch
and transmission first.  R&T and C&D probably beat the hell out of it
doing 5K clutch drops trying to see who could get the fastest 0-60

    Oh.  Sorry, Jeff... I misunderstood and thought that one end of the
    spring was simply disconnected.

    From what I remember of my 914's engine in its pre-6 days, the
    throttle valve shaft has a stack of about a dozen parts on it.
    One piece is the arm to which your throttle cable is attached.
    It's firmly fixed to the shaft; it has a square hole that fits on
    the square shaft.

    Next to it is this other arm you're talking about, to which the
    throttle-return spring is connected.  THIS arm has a round hole, so
    it's basically free to rotate on the square throttle-valve shaft
    (or, more accurately, on a round bushing).  In order for it to
    apply spring-return force to the throttle, it has a little hook
    that fits into a notch in the first arm.

    Sounds as though the last guy who messed with your throttle put the
    pieces together incorrectly, so that the hook on the return-spring
    arm isn't captured by the notch in the throttle-cable arm.  Because
    the return-spring arm is free to rotate, it can't exert any force
    on the throttle-cable arm.

    This is BAD; it means that the only return force you're getting is
    from the secondary spring that's also mounted (coaxially) on the
    shaft, but which has probably rusted and broken by now, or is
    missing, or was ALSO installed incorrectly.

    Take your throttle-valve shaft assembly apart (there's just one nut
    on the end that basically holds it all together), replace the
    secondary spring if it's broken (its ends hook onto two OTHER hooks
    on the two arms), and re-align the two arms so that the
    return-spring arm's hook fits into the notch on the throttle-cable
    arm.

    Let me know how this goes... Like I said, it's been a while since I
    looked at a 4-cylinder 914 motor, so some of the details are a
    little fuzzy.

Sorry for the delay, was busy at work, had a couple of road-trips, then
my brother came home from Europe for a couple of weeks so we had some
major goofing off to do.  Anyway, here is the list.

It is broken down into 2 sections:  Specifics and Generals.  

Specfics lists items and their inter- changeability with a specific
car/year.  Generals lists items that I have found references to, but
have not yet checked out exact appilications.  The generals sections is
also by groups of items/cars.  So anything within one of the "groups"
is/should be interchangeable with the "group" of cars in the same
block, not just the cars listed on that line!

Also take all of this with a grain of salt, I tried to be as accurate
as possible, but beware...      Hope it helps!

Hey Guys,

Sorry for the delay.  I've been out of the office and had some family problems,
(Mom's got cancer), and had some family in visiting so, I haven't gotten
much done lately.  Anyway the fix for the odometer is pretty easy to do,
I must have fixed about a half-dozen already.  So here goes:

1.  Remove steering wheel

2.  Remove plastic gaurds and turn signal/wiper arms.  Should come out as
    a unit.

3.  Uuscrew the holding screws for the instrument cluster, but don't remove
    it yet.

4.  Open hood, locate speedometer cable coming from left front wheel and,
    push all the slack through the firewall.  Rather easy, most probably
    will get your hands dirty.

5.  Now pull out instrument cluster.  It won't come out completely, but it
    will give you enough room to get a pair of channel locks on the speedometer
    cable "nut"  It is a silver knurled circular assembly.  Just grab with
    channel locks and turn, it'll come off pretty easy.

6.  Remove wiring from back of speedometer cable.  I wouldn't worry about
    labeling everything, stuff only goes in one place.

7.  Press the speedometer cable forward, out of the instrument cluster.

   >Subject: odometer fix! Correction.
   >
   >7.  Press the speedometer forward, out of the instrument cluster.
   >    Not the cable!!


8.  With a small flat blade screwdriver, start prying up the black metal
    bezel on the back lip of the front of the unit.  Keep prying until you
    get more than 50% of the circumfrence done.  The plexiglass bezel will
    then just lift off.

9.  Unscrew the few screws on the back of the unit, this will allow you
    to remove the assembly from the housing.  

10. Holding the assembly, so that the speedometer face is pointing away from
    you, on the left side, you will see a small gear that sits on top of a worm     gear.  That gear has slid either inside or outside of the worm gear.  
    gear has slid either inside or outside of the worm gear. 
    Push/Pull  the gear until it sits squarely on top of the worm gear.             That's all there is to it.  

11. Put the assembly back in the housing, put the screws back in and set the
    plexiglass bezel back on.  Put the black band on over the lip. turn the
    assembly over and start pressing the lip back down that you pryed up.
    If you take your time and are careful not to scratch the front of the 
    black ring, it will be invisible from the front when your done.

12. Put the rest of it back together.  Before putting the instrument cluster
    back in, if you have any blown dash lights, now is the time to replace
    them!  Don't forget to pull the speedometer cable slack back into the
    engine compartment.


All told, it should take you less than an hour to do.  And the big tip is,
NEVER, EVER push the trip odometer button while the car is moving.  And I
mean moving!  Don't touch that damn thing unless the car is at an absolute
stand still!  Even if your barely moving, it's enough to cause that gear to
"pop" off again.  This is experience talking now!  If you have any other
questions drop me a line!

Subject: Congratulations


I noticed in your last post to the pfiles your purchase.  Congratulations 
and best wishes.  I also noticed you mentioned the "obligatory" cracked dash 
(me too, don't use Armor All), split seat cover (me too, passenger seat) and 
you mentioned your speedometer wasn't working.  Mine too, but I just got it 
fixed a week or so ago.  I have some postings on the subject.  I'll attach 
the one which was the most help and comfort.  I needed to know what I was 
looking at for a repair bill.  It turned out to be the cable from the wheel 
to the EGR counter box.    $78 parts and labor.  See note below.  I also 
know of a place to repair speedometers here in Dayton OH if it turns out to 
be a bad speedo.

Greg



It is a mechanical failure.  Either a broken cable or broken
speedometer.  How to determine the failure?  Remove the speedometer and
see if the cable turns when you drive the car.  Also, you should be
able to spin the input of the speedometer to see if the needle jumps.

The cable is driven off the left fron wheel.  The cable is in two
sections, at least on most 924's, because there is a box that
drives the counter for the 02 service indicator.  If yours is
an old 924 without the 02 light, the cable may run directly from
the front wheel.  If yours does have a 2 piece cable, there should
be a black box attached inside the engine compartment on the left
front wheel well.

In any case, you can check it by removing the speedometer.  The three
instruments just push out from the rear.  The easiest method I've found
is to reach up from under the dash and push out the tach first.  The
speedometer is hard to access from the rear since it is directly above
the steering column.  You can then use the tach opening to disconnect
the speedometer cable push out the speedometer.

You should be able to locate a used speedometer very cheap.  Partsheaven
in Hayward California (510-782-0358) probably has one and can ship ups.
If you want to do the cable, they can probably assist with a used one.
You can buy repair kits that consist of just the center rotating section
too.

Actually you can also get get these aerospace-style locknuts with either a

Hi, 

While perusing one of those autotrader magazines I came across several full
page ads from places that sell damaged vehicles.  My question is this, I
already know that water damaged vehicles are ok if you like electrical
problems, but what about theft recovery?  It seems to me that these would be
even better bargains.  What are the negatives about these vehicles?  What is
typically missing from them?  I can guess that maybe a radio and/or some
trim pieces, but is there usually any substantial missing items (i.e.
Engine, transmission, chassis, etc.)?

Also I have heard some stuff about cars with "R-titles" which sell for low
sums of money, what are these?

Basically, if your car was corner balanced before you adjusted
the rear height, and it was level (left and right rears at the
same height) then as long as it is level now you are fine.
It does not matter which spline you are on, the "torque"
on the torsion bar and resulting ride height is what matters.
You probably have more sway-away adjustment screw sticking up 
on one side than the other to make them even.

But I find it strange that you were able to lower the rear about
14mm by moving a whole spline on the bar. I think that a whole
spline (rather than a partial spline done by turning the inner end
spline one way and the outer end spline the other way) will change the
ride height about 2" or so. When I first got my car I did calculations
that would make Byron proud ;) to see if I could lower it one spline.
I tried it and blistered the paint off my fender at Lime Rock because
it was too low.

There seems to be some black magic involved in the rear torsion bars
(so calculations with our modern science will not work). I still have 
problems balancing them after all these years. I tried to raise 
my Right Rear a bit for weight balance recently. I did the MINIMUM
adjustment : rotated the inner and outer ends in opposite directions
(no sway away spring plates this year - illegal in SCCA Solo-II stock).
It seemed to raise the RR too much, now that corner is too heavy. It
seems that the range of adjustment is not small enough to really
corner balance a car within 5-10 pounds. Maybe my mojo was missing? Anyone
know the minimum adjustment?

Not as improbable as it may sound, Bill.  I've gotten mine back from a

Since the first S w/mech injection was 1969, my guess is the car you're
looking at is an early 1969, hence, long wheel base, 911S. If you can post
the SN's of both the car and the engine, I'll look them up for you. It was
probably sold in late 68 and titled as a 68 car.

Also, while the 68 911S was only delivered to the European market, some have

     Is it V for vergassen?  912EV, sounds like an electric conversion.
     
     OBTW, does anyone else's late 944 have the cheesiest fuse/relay board 
     in the world?  Mine will sometimes turn the engine fans on/off when I 
     tap hard on the board.  Not good for the battery charge.  I'd like to 
     run the relays or power to the fans off switched 12V instead of 
     permanent 12V.  Yeah, I know we like to have the fans run after the 
     ignition is off, but my engine shuts down cool and doesn't smolder 
     much higher than the lowest white mark after shutdown (even if I 
     circulate the coolant after a few minutes).  Anyone know if there is a 
     switched 12V line in the same bundle as the current power to that 
     relay?  I'd like to make a clean connection under there.  
     
     Alternatively, does anyone have a logic diagram for that big honkin' 
     relay with 5 relays inside?  My cold solder search didn't find 
     anything.  I hope it's not the socket for that big relay that's 
     causing my problems.  I get the feeling that it's one of these since 
     both fans run instead of just one.  Doesn't just one run unless AC is 
     on?
     
     I don't think the fan switch in the radiator has any problems.  Does 
     that unit also function as the sender for the H2O temp gauge?  
     Probably not, but I noticed two wires there.

Do you mean that the Lamborghini Diablo VT has the fastest top speed or 
the quickest acceleration than any other 4wd vehicle?   The 1996 Porsche 
Turbo beats the Diablo in 0-60 and 1/4 mile tests.  See Road & Track, 
July 1995, pages 79 and 170.

Subject: Computer and Car fans rejoice!

FYI...  Don't miss this month's edition of Automobile Magazine wherein
Robert Cumberford waxes eloquently about the wonders of CAD wrt designing
Cars.  He happens to be really jazzed about a specific SGI machine,
but that's not the point ;^)  The point is that a few months back he
wrote about how evil computers are and how they are threatening to take
all the creativity and romance out of designing cars... He even suggested
we are all sentenced to a life of dull, efficiently designed cars with
the only key metric involved being cycle time--leaving no room for art.

When we read that article our first thought was:  "This man has never seen
anything analyzed, designed or tested in 3D or he wouldn't think that way".
Of course we happen to be biased around here.

To make a long story short, suddenly Cumberford thinks computers are
amazing and can't wait to design something with one :-)  Watch Automobile
for his progress and realtime impressions...

Subject: 73 1/2 ride height & shocks?

OK, I finally got my 18 yr old KBY pressurized gas shocks replaced ( they
were really in good shape, only had about 3000 mi on them when I put the
car up!!)  with new Koni hydraulics.

 After sitting for this long, I found that the ride height measured 26in
at rear fender lip, and 27.5 in at FRONT!!!  I felt that the gas had
caused the chassis to rise.  After  beating my car around the back roads
for about 500 mi., nothing changed!!  The Konis resulted in about a 1/2 in
drop. I,ve only drived it for about 50mi, but I don't think it will change
much!!

What do I have to do to drop it back to normal ride height?? The front
doesn't seem to difficult, but the rear is sort of hard to understand in
the shop manual. I should't have to do anything with the torsion bars???
I'm just trying to get back to factory height... Nothing has been done to
the chassis before, and it came with Konis. I thought that over time the
torsion bars and bushings will wear and the ride height will become
lower?? I checked the sway-bars and they're not binding. Any info on
desired alignment specs for my chassis specialists?

     Any suggestions???

I am looking for helpful hints on replacing the rubber section of fuel line

the fuel pump. The rubber line under the hood is crimped to  the metal line,
the metal line runs through the wheel well then turns underbody back under
the torsion bar and to the fuel pump. It appears as though the rear
suspension needs to be partialy dissasembled to remove the line!  There must
be a better way, i am not sure if there is enough room between the wheel
well and the head to try to cut and thread the metal line.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Bob:

Your reflection of 912/911 price differential being less than 25 percent is
correct.

The prices for 1969 Porsches of interest (MSRP/Dealer Cost) in the summer of
1969 were as follows:

912   Coupe-4 Speed ($5235/$4382)
911T Coupe-4 Speed ($6060/$5077)

You could really "kick this up" by adding the 5-speed to either
($69.55/$57.95). How about a 911S coupe for ($7970/$6636) !!!

The 912 was still "big bucks" in price comparison to a new Corvette T-Top
Coupe ($4926/$3884).

                            Old rate        New rate    Miles allowed

74 Carrera (value $25,000)    $272          $340            5,000

73 914 2.0 (value $12,000)    $221          $140            2,500

    Total                     $493          $480


Overall a small saving by changing companies.

Probably will not be true for all porsches insured.

Still less expensive than "normal" coverage.

BTW these are annual rates.

Lyle,

>From the who's who, I learn that you have a MY86 951.  This car had a service
campaign to replace, gratis, the fuel delivery line you describe.  You should
learn from your dealer whether or not this has been done to your car.

In any event, you need to replace the hose *NOW*, before you have a parts
car and/or one less member in your immediate family (you).  If you absolutely
have to drive the car to whoever will replace the hose, do the following.  Put
a small hose clamp on the fuel hose so that it abuts the crimped end at the
rail.  This will tighten the rubber hose against the inside metal sleeve
of the fitting.

It would be safer for you to have the car towed, and I'd recommend that.

Both the supply and return hoses run from the rail to the rigid lines at
the right front wheel well.  At the point they enter the well, you can see
that each has a fitting which can be opened to replace just the hose.  You
really need to use a flare nut wrench here, because there is not enough
"height" to the fitting to loosen or tighten it with, say, a flat wrench
without trashing the fittings.

Kevin, thank you for your quick responce. 
I have taken measures to stop the leek,  a short piece of metal tube and a
few hose clamps. I see it as only a temporary fix as I am sure the rest of
the line is in the same condition. Yes the car has had the updated fuel
rail/line as per service campaign.
I don't recall the set-up of the lines prior to the campaign (it hase been
five years),
but currently there are fittings for both the supply and the return lines on
the engine side.  On the wheel well side the return is secured by a clamp to
the steel line.  The supply line (the bad one) goes into a very factory
looking crimp on the steel line.
I am starting to wonder if the line was changed as part of the service
campaign or just the fuel rail, I will check with my local West Palm Beach
P-car dealer. 

Best regards,

Subject: ABS dash covers

My '83 944 has a brown ABS dash cover that was on it when I got the car two
years ago.  From the catalog pix it appears to be from Automotion.  It
doesn't look bad; as a Porsche ignoramus when I got the car, it took me a few
weeks to figure out that it was an add-on.  However, it really doesn't match
the OEM plastic at all.  It certainly protects the dash, but I dislike two
things: it squeaks where it rubs on other plastic, and it is too shiny.
Other than that, I think it beats the heck out of a cracked, faded dash....
For the price, I mean.  I need to work up the courage to remove the cover and
see what I've got underneath; maybe I'm lucky and it was put on when the car
was new to "protect" the  pristine original....  And pigs fly, eh?

A few questions to the list:

1. Curb hits have yielded a minor crack in the front dam, and bending of the
corner braces.  I think I can remove and straighten the braces, but wonder if
anyone has hints on repairing the crack.  It is only about 0.5 cm deep, in
the structure I would call the center brace of the dam.

2. At least one other lister and I are *still* waiting to hear of *anyone's*
experience with sheepskin seat covers.  Advice on suppliers of quality
covers, in particular.  Mine are shot.

3. Despite replacing motor mounts with newest type, my engine still shakes
itself-- makes me think of a slightly wet dog, or a pee shiver-- as it
decelerates through about 1000-1100 rpm.  I've cadged rides in several other
944s, and found that some seem to have that shake, and others didn't.  What
do the 944 experts say?  Is this the price one pays for a large displacement
4-lunger?  Now, here's one for the engineers: why does the engine shake when
coming *down* through 1100 rpm but not when going *up* through the same rpm
range?

4. When the car is cold, slamming a door yields a strange "boiiinnng" sound
from underneath.  Warm, no sound.  Up on the lift today, beat on everything,
no boing.  Of course, it was hot from running to the shop by then.  Ideas?

>From your description, you have a VERY BAD MISMATCH! You apparently have a
European Fan Shroud (with open air outlet hole for the Euro heaters), but
you
have the  American  style "Flapper Boxes"! The air bleed off the fan shroud
is really needed to cool the 5' of exhaust pipe inside each  Euro heater
box.
The Euro heater is always "on", with  a deflector valve on the body under
ther car either sending hot air to you inside or to the  atmosphere outside,
depending on what position your heater control is in. 
    In your case, having the flapper boxes,  what  you should do is BLOCK
OFF
the air bleed hole on the right hand side of the fan shroud. Cut a piece of
sheet metal to fit, and use the existing bolt holes/weld nuts to attach. If
you really need something to block this off, let me know at (408) 727-1864,
as I have a few of them around the  Shop. A Better Solution (at least a more
visually appealing solution) would be either to replace the  Euro fan shroud
with an American one, or convert the engine  to the Euro heater boxes. If
your  engine number is 830,000 to 836,xxx it was Originally a Euro model.
Unfortunately, to convert to Euro you need some expensive parts- like the
heater boxes, muffler, muffler supports, etc. I have them in stock in case
you want to  go that way. If you want more info, give me a call at (408)

I guarantee you it won't. They don't insure if you don't OWN your HOUSE 
(we were living in a rental house and they wouldn't even talk to us, 
regardless of the fact that it has a garage) They don't insure you if 
your house doesn't have a closed and locking garage attached to the house 
where someone is at "all times" (This prompted us to ask, "Well, what the 
hell do you expect us to do? Hire a security guard?") and amongst other 
things (by the time we got the answer to this one, we knew Leland wasn't 
for us) they won't insure young drivers... That clearly leaves the 
majority of Porsche drivers open for them to take, but we were not in 
their category.

Subject: Vacation in Germany...

Just came back from a nice 2-week trip to Germany, lots of P- and other cars 
and beer! I'd like to share some things from the trip with my fellow P-car 
friends:

Naturally we visited Nurburgring, we had an old Toyota though, so no 
driving... Interesting was what we heared from a German friend who often goes 
there, and is very experienced in Ring-driving:
He'd seen the Boxter on test drives around the Ring and quote: "...never seen 
any car handling as good as the Boxter" According to this guy the car will be 
something out of this world... So, hold your horses and keep the money in the 
bank until 986 arrives!

Next, we went to Weissach and tried to get in (no such luck, of course...). 
In any case we spotted some Boxters, the new 911 panorama, and a 996.

Rest of the trip we stayed in Nurnberg, went to the DTM races there, and had 
a lot of fun around town!

Eagle-eyed porschephiles saw that I sold my beloved 944 (still the only 
limone gelb I ever seen), on my way down to Germany. Of course I paniced 
(no Porsche -no life?) so on the way home I bought my dream car:
a '72 911S Targa, almost original, kein umbau!
Some rust on the front fenders and left rear, 90.000 miles, mech sound, 
chrome and interior (leather) OK. Probably matching numbers, will check 
today. Sadly not the original color but that'll be fixed this or next winter. 
Got it for about USD 6000. If somebody knows if that's the correct price, he/
she could please e-mail me!

Subject: Zone 1 48 Hours Report (long)

Well, we just returned last night from a very successful PCA
Driver Education at Watkins Glen, the Zone 1 48 Hours of
Watkins Glen.

The name of the event comes about from the Saturday/Sunday 
sessions. Instructors are allowed to run on Friday for 
workshops and checkouts. We had a total of 240 drivers from 10 
states participate, some from as far away as Texas. 

The long course that we use had a couple of changes from last
year, the first being a large curb at the entrance to the inner
loop (chicane) on the back straight, put there to ensure that
the cars do slow down and not cut across there. The second is
a widening of the track out of Turn 14 (the left hander after
the off camber) so that the turn is now just a lift and go in
4th gear for everybody (VERRY FAST).

In a couple of places, they have also added some concrete
patches along the line, so that there is a bit more traction
and less breaking up of the surface.

The weather was just about perfect, from an overcast and
coolish Friday (where the thunderstorms held off until 3
minutes until 5 p.m.) and a warm and muggy (but dry) Saturday,
and a cool and clear, low humidity Sunday.  Altogether, we lost
about 20 minutes of track time to weather and about 15 minutes
of track time due to cleanup of a couple of minor incidents.

One of the incidents was a 911 at the toe of the boot. His tail
started to wash out as he was accelerating up the hill. He
jerked the wheel to catch it, noticed that the jerk had not
accomplished the desired result, so he jerked it again. In his
words, "The car just jumped into the guardrail."

He and his passenger were not injured, and the damage was
limited to a couple of powder blue stripes running down the
driver side of the car, a bent front strut, a bent front
control arm, and a couple of scratched wheels, (as well as a
damaged driver ego).

The other incident was at the aforementioned Turn 14, where a
993 from Michigan realized that he was carrying too much speed
there, lifted in the middle of the turn, lost it and backed
around into the armco on the inside of the turn. Again, no
injuries and the car will be easily repaired...

But that was the only negative part of the event.

A couple of new 993 Turbos showed up, one delivered only 2
weeks ago, the other with trick muffler and HUGE Fikse wheels
and tires, all painted black to match the car. Incredibly fast.

Lots of race cars, including 356s and 914s and GTU and GT2 cars.
Bill Hawe brought his Ruf Turbo to join a couple of other of
Mr. Ruf's cars... Once again, incredibly fast...

The best part of an event like this was seeing Porsche friends 
from all over the Northeast at a great spot like the Glen. I 
must mention the Porschephiles that were there: Lou Krieg, Bill 
Hawe, Mark Forrester, David Rothenberg and Christine Ryan, 
Larry and Geri Reynolds, Thak and Thwen Chaleomtirana (who 
incidentally threw a great party in Ithaca for the Central New 
York Region - we had a great time!) and my lovely wife and 
myself...

Mark your calendar for attending this event next year, we'll
have it the week after the IMSA/Busch events at the Glen...

I'll let you know the dates as soon as they are resolved...
Good Luck!

Paul,

Believe it or not, the 26/27.5 inch fender lip measurements you note
indicate that the car is pretty close to the factory recommended ride
heights.  I am also in the process of adjusting the height of my '76 as
we speak.  Using the factory method of measuring ride height - meas-
uring the difference between the center line of the torsion bar and the
center line of the wheel hub - I got a 26 inch fender lip measurement
in the rear for a 12mm difference in torsion bar/hub (12mm +/- 5mm
is the factory recommendation for "Euro" cars - US cars were alot 
higher).  I just went out in the garage and measured my fronts - 27 inches.
I had measured my front hub/torsion bar difference a while back and it
was 108mm - right on the factory spec.  So, to make a long story long,
you're not real far off right now.

The front is straightforward, the rear is a character builder.  Especially
on a car the age of yours.  You will have to move the spring plates relative
to the torsion bars in the rear to change your ride height.  After 22 years
of blissful union, your torsion bars and spring plates may have developed
an attraction for each other and may not want to come apart.

If you would like more info on what is involved with this, let me know.

Subject: I messed up my CIS

Last night I was trying to adjust the air plate in the CIS on my '77 911S.
It was running a little poorly when it was cold so I thought that maybe the
plate was off center or sticking slightly.  Somehow I messed it up to the
point that the car won't start now.  It smells like it's being flooded.  Is
there a trick or did I mess up something else perhaps.  All I did was open
it up, move the plate a little tiny bit, adjust the height, and put it back
together.  Any suggestions would be appreciated...it's my daily driver and
in the meantime I'm stuck borrowing my girlfriend's Chevrolet Spectrum

I am running 255.40.17's in front and 275.40.17's in the rear.  The front
camber is set at -2.4 and the rear is at -1.5.  The tire temps seem to be OK
running 33 lb. in front and 31 lb in the rear.

If I go lower, current thinking by some, I get rapid tire wear in the center.

Subject: 944 starting prob


hi p'philes,
	I've recently run into a problem with my 83 944.  When i turn the 
key to start the car, absolutely nothing happens--no motor trying to turn 
over, etc...the only sound i've noticed is a slight whirring from the 
back of the car (maybe from the fuel pump?).  Anyhow, i'll turn the key 
on and off 1-2 times and the car will start fine (no stumbling to start 
or anything) and will run fine.  The difficulty starting isn't very 
predictable either--sometimes when cold, sometimes when hot, sometimes it 
takes just 2 turns of the key, sometimes 5 or more.  I don't think it's 
the fuel pump or the relay since I would think that would also effect the 
car even while it is running, not just the starting.  I checked the 
electrical connections to the battery and they are fine.  I haven't 
checked the connections to the sarter yet, but will do so soon.  I don't 
think it is the battery because if the battery were low, I would think 
that the engine would try to turn over, but wouldn't be able to--no sound 
is made in my situation.  I'm thinking right now that it might be the 
starter :-( .  any advice on a diagnosis, ways and things to check?

Invest is a bottle of white shoe polish. At your next and subsequent 
events put four marks on each quarter of the outside of your tires at 
the edge of the tread. If the marks are still there on the outter part 
of the roll edge of the tread then too much air pressure for the course 
and time on course. Once the marks wear off then you got it right for 
your car and set up.

	Hello all,

	I tried to post these questions onec, but may have sent them to 
the wrong address.  If my previous attempt shows up then sorry for the 
duplication.

	I am looking at a 1987 924S and have a few questions.

	1)  Does this car have the self adjusting timing belt thingy?

	2)  There are no records for this car.  Am I asking for trouble 
in buying a "bargain" porsche without some history?

	3)  The previous owner seems to have spent more on the stereo 
than on the car.  Is there anything I can look for in terms of 
identifying neglect?

	4)  What size tire is "supposed" to be on this car?  what other 
sizes will fit?  This car currently has the phone dial type rims, but 
they are pretty shabby, anything to correct this?

	5)  Any other advice would be appreciated.

	As a final note on the condition of this car the tires are, I 
believe, P-6s all around, but are obviously of 3 different vintages as 
though the owner only bought one at a time when one wore out.  Also the 
car vibrates badly over 60 mph.

None? Zilch? If so, the owner may be covering up something majorly bad

Not knowing precise things about 924S's, I cannot say this for sure, but 
I believe that the tires are the problem. If they are incorrectly 
balanced, or never were (likely incorrectly balanced as the description you 
give makes the wheels seem like they've been worn out) the car would 
begin to vibrate badly at highway speeds and above. Many people notice 
this after changing tires if they don't go ahead and get their tires 
balanced. Ask the owner if/when the tires were last balanced, and if they 
were, was it spin or bubble? (Spin is better) If this appears to be your 
problem, you are probably looking at $50-$100 depending on how much the 
garage you take it to charges per tire to balance, and an hour or so in 
waiting.

You might want to look at the 914 FAQ about this conversion before you start;

For a 914, converting to carbs is number 2 or 3 on the list of the 10

Mike,

This does not work with BFG R1's. The outer sidewall is so stiff I have
not found a low enough pressure for there to be any roll over on the edge.

The best thing to do is get a pyrometer out and to compare lap times until
the temps are right and the laps are as fast as possible. Sound easy...I
wish!

My experience suggests that 30 psi is way to high...but my experience is
with a 911 on 225/50R15 fronts and 245/45/R16 rears....

Subject: Re: R1 968 Tire Wear/Inflation

Alan,
I assume you are using these tires for track usage. If you are you are
running them WAY too high. Try starting about 24lbs front and rear cold and
be sure and bleed them down once they are hot. I run about 25 on the front
and 23 in the back on my 89 944 turbo. These are hot pressures BTW. You are
also running too much camber considering the stiffness of the tire. Try about
1.75 in the front and 1.25 in the rear. A little toe out in the front and a
little toe in in the rear and you have a reasonable setup.
If you are using them on the street run them at about 35-36lbs all the way
around. You are going to wear them out on the street fairly quickly,
especially in the insides, with those camber settings.

Yes, but read the FAQ. The builtin adjuster only sets it once, and then
you lock it in place. It does not adjust over a period of time for wear, etc.

Take it to a competent watercooled Porsche mechanic for an analysis.
If you belong to PCA, or know a PCA member in your area, ask for

New tires are cheap to buy.  If this is any indication of what the

Bart, a lot of people feel that the sail vinyl is an important part of a 
914's appearance.  I disagree - my '74 had the sail vinyl removed at last 
rework and it looks much better.  I did replace the aluminum trim pieces, 
though.  Also, I put the top vinyl back on after the paint started 
getting scratches caused by trapped debris.

Subject: smoking 914

My 2 litre engine was partially rebuilt last week--new Mahle pistons and
cylinders, new valves and guides--and it still smokes, especially after
down-shifting.  I was attempting to avoid being black flagged at the Glen,
but apparently I am jinxed with the smoking the mosquitoes syndrome.

Sympathetic friends suggested that the smoking will go away after the seals
seat themselves, unsympathetic enemies suggested that I had broken oil
rings, my mechanic suggested that I try a different oil.  I am sure that my
son will say "stop complaining, let's trade cars."  My daughter would want
me to give her the car, smoking and all, out right.  I have yet to ask my
wife who will see our VISA bill SOON.

Any one with any reassuring thoughts?  I hate to pull the engine again.
After the rebuild, I drove it around (frenzily for two days after work) for
200 miles before tracking it. It is possible that I did not break the engine
in long enough and managed to screw something up.  Aside from the smoking,
the car ran strong.

Not half its original price (as recommended by the factory), but the
price that speculators were willing to pay.  Actually, a new '89
Speedster stickered for somewhere around $70K, if I remember
correctly.

That was when collector cars had got out of hand, especially Ferraris
and Lamborghinis.  Then the bottom fell out of the entire market.  I'm
wary of buying any car as an investment just because too many gross
things can happen to it.  But if you are, I would think an '89

Hi Mitch,

Thanks for asking!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1800 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute:  The bank folks would
rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

Subject: Many 951 Questions


I have a bunch of questions and would love responses to any of them, THANKS!

Car: '88 951 Black/Black 70K miles


1)  My rear wiper motor has died.  I need to replace it and I would like to
    replace the whole wiper on the rear and the two fronts as they have many
    rock chips and look worn.

    I noticed that the wipers on the 968 seem different, so;

    a. Will a 968 rear wiper motor work on a 951?
       i. is it just the same part or different (newer, better)?

    b. Will the 968 wipers fit on a 951?
       i. are they just the same or different?

2)  My A/C is no-opp.  The dealership says that the aluminum tubing that goes
    through the firewall has been crimped by bad work previously done and that
    the refrigerant escapes there.  He says that they tried to rig it, but it
    needs replaced.  He estimated that part to be ~$300 but noted that it would
    require ~$800 in labor to do the job as much of the top of the engine would
    need to be removed to get back in there.

     a.  How does that sound to people that know what part he is talking about?
         i.  Is it possible to be fixed without replacing the part?
        ii.  Is the labor estimate out of hand?
       iii.  Can a non-dealership do the work cheaper but just as well.
        iv.  Can I do the work myself (moderate abilities)?

     b.  What else should be done at the same time if much of the engine needs
         to be opened up?
         i.  Head gasket? _minor_ oil near front
        ii.  Valve guides? (burns .5qt./4-5K miles)
       iii.  Any belts?

3)  The rear speaker housing has form factors for both a 4x6" speaker and
    a round speaker.

     a. Is it 4" circular or 5"?

5)  Is it possible to get that damn heat shield to quit rattling?  :-)

6)  My clutch pedal has a few inches of play before there is any sort of
    pressure.  I also have the gear meshing problems going into second that
    someone was talking about earlier.  It is really tight in the winter, and
    I have to do the second or two pause before pulling it into second.  In
    addition, pushing the pedal much much farther into the carpet, :-), seems
    to help.  It seems to me that a lot of the problem is that I am not getting
    enough pedal.

     a.  Is the clutch pedal hydrolic?
         i.  Does it need bled or added to?
        ii.  Does the fluid ever need changed?
       iii.  Any other ideas if it is not the pedal needing ajusted?
        iv.  Can I ajust this?

7)  Thinking about chipping the car.

    a.  Should I?
        i.  If I have the head gasket replaced with the newer, better gasket
            should I go ahead since I removed the major problem with chiping
            a 951 (failed head gasget)?
       ii.  What other problems are there?

8)  I need to replace the rear seat belt assebly covers.

    a.  Should I replace the whole belts?
    b.  Are there 3rd party belts that are better, cheaper?
    c.  Should I just remove them from those fake seats? :-)

9)  The car is running rich.  The car has always run rich.  The car will
    forever run rich.  :-)  I have had them look at this a bunch of times
    and they have "spec'ed" the car over and over, but I still run rich
    (especially in the winter).  I am tired of fighting to keep from fouling
    the plugs in the first few moments of starting it during the winter.

    a.  Is there a bigger problem?
    b.  Is there a solution?
    c.  Will chipping the car help? 8->

10) I need a 993 C4 (995?)

    a.  Can somebody buy me one?
    b.  Did I earn any points for not asking for a 996?

11) I am not sure if my car has LSD or not.  I was given an option code list
    with some holes, but I do have the code that was listed as being a LSD.
    This puzzels me as I didn't think I had one.  I drove a '92 968 which 
    acted very different from my car and I though all 968's had LSD.  With
    my car, it is very easy for me to get into a power-on oversteer.  With the
    968 I couldn't and I believed the inner wheel slipped a bit but then it
    felt like something happened and it grabbed.  This discription makes it
    sound like I have LSD and the 968 didn't.

    a. Do I have an LSD?
    b. What is the 100% sure option code for an LSD?
    c. How does an LSD differ from what I (ignorantly, I'm sure) refered to
       as posi-traction during my youth?

12) Why didn't the 968 sell well?  It was a damn fine car, though was
    underpowered for the price range it was in compare to it's competitors.

    a. Is this why?
    b. Does someone want to trade my 951 for one?
    c. Should I have bought a '92 968 with _4K_ miles in '94 for $30K?

13) Now and then I get into it and up in revs.  I was actually told once that
    this is good for the car to burn off stuff.

    a. Should I do this?
    b. Is it completely save to use the full range of revs?

14) I almost never drop my clutch from high revs, in fact I probably under
    rev it when taking off.

    a. How high should the revs be before beginning to release the clutch?
    c. How bad is power-on oversteer for the clutch/gearbox/etc?  (note: I
       do not peel out, but sometimes I get hard onto it when leaving a turn
       and let it slide a bit.  Man, my old baldies were a blast! :-) )

15) My alloys look like crap. (16" phone dials)

    a. How well does refinishing look?
    b. Can they be chromed?
    c. Should I get new +1 or +2" tire/wheel sets instead if I want to
       start doing some track stuff?

Well, enough for now.

Thanks to those that read this far!!! :-)

The 968 rear wiper does have a different part number.  It is also _$150_
_cheaper_ than the motor for the '88 944.  I would love to know that I can

Subject: 944/951 A/C

A few days ago it finally got hot enough to roll up the windows and turn on
the A/C. Nothing happened...
I stopped in to a local auto A/C shop to have them check it out. The tech
told me that the system "held vacuum OK, but we tried recharging it 3 times
and it wouldn't accept any Freon". He suggested I take it to the Porsche
shop because it must be something "peculiar to Porsches".
Anybody heard of this before? I've checked the 944 FAQ, and the A/C
problems section is not done yet. The fact that there *is* an A/C section
makes me think there may be some common problems. I've made it a point to
run the system about 20 minutes a month during the winter, as Porsche
recommends.
Any tips, clues or hints would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: '68 911S



Here's another vote for the likelihood of this car being a '69, potentially
sold in (and titled as a) '68.  The 68 911S didn't meet the States first big 

emissions year, so wasn't imported.  The 911L replaced it, and was an
S with the E-engine - all the trim of the S, but the 130 hp engine.  The 68
'S' in Europe was indeed a Weber car, and short wheelbase of course.
The '68 car serial numbers start with 118.  And yes, there are a few that
have made there way into the States and Canada.

All that said, the '69 S is a nice find.  A lot of people, once settled on 
the
slightly flared fenders and the fuel injection, lean towards the last of the
series ('73).  But the '69 has all the important improvements (4 vented
discs, dual circuit master cylinder, updated front suspension, actually
obtainable interior parts) with the smaller displacement,  peakier (more
entertaining?) engine.

Subject: 924 Horror Story! Ahhh!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I witnessed a true assault on the good Doctor's name.  Thankfully
this trajedy didn't involve my 924, but it was painful just the same.  I
was travelling on I-75 into Atlanta in my '77 924 coming back to 
Charlotte from a weekend visiting my brother in Chattanooga, TN.  In my
rear view mirror I spotted a familiar silhouette, that of a 924.  I was
getting prepared to wave at the fellow 924 when I made out the electric
purple color on the car.  I also noted it was riding a bit lower than my
stock 924.  What drove up beside me was nausiating.  Not only was the 
924 painted electric purple with fishing boat sparkle paint, but it had
been lowered and shod with tiny chrome wheels with ultra low profile
tires.  It had a sizeable chunk of sheetmetal gouged out of the front
fender and door from an accident.  It had a HUGE whale tail glued (at 
least I assume it was glued, no way could the hatch survive hole 
drilling) to the hatch.  Also, white coolant smelling smoke puffed from
its LOUD exhaust.  Head gasket time!  Over the loud exhaust could be 
heard a soft boom-boom from a stereo.  
	I gave the 924 a half hearted wave but I don't know if he waved
back, the windows were tinted too dark.  I thought this kind of

p.s. Got the cams' end play and timing set Saturday.
Here's how I timed the cams:
(parts of this are in the factory workshop manual):

1. Remove all spark plugs, install rockers on #1 and #4 intake valves
   and adjust valves with cams turned so that the rocker foot is on the back
   side of the cam (away from the lobe). #1 and #4 intake valves are
   on opposite sides of the motor, on the top, rearmost end of the motor
   (The end of the engine with the crank pulley).

2. Turn the crank so that the Z1 mark on the pulley points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position, in line with the joint between the case halves.
   This is TDC.

3. Turn the cams so the the dots on their ends points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position.

4. Install timing chains, gears, dowel pins, washers, and nuts on the
   ends of the cams. Tighten the nuts (no need to get carried away,
   just tight enough to flatten the spring washers).
  
5. Pick a cam, install dial indicator on cam housing overhanging the
   intake valve (either #1 or #4, depending on which side you're doing).

The 968 rear wiper does have a different part number.  It is also _$150_
_cheaper_ than the motor for the '88 944.  I would love to know that I can
use the 968 motor. :-)

Subject: 944/951 A/C

A few days ago it finally got hot enough to roll up the windows and turn on
the A/C. Nothing happened...
I stopped in to a local auto A/C shop to have them check it out. The tech
told me that the system "held vacuum OK, but we tried recharging it 3 times
and it wouldn't accept any Freon". He suggested I take it to the Porsche
shop because it must be something "peculiar to Porsches".
Anybody heard of this before? I've checked the 944 FAQ, and the A/C
problems section is not done yet. The fact that there *is* an A/C section
makes me think there may be some common problems. I've made it a point to
run the system about 20 minutes a month during the winter, as Porsche
recommends.
Any tips, clues or hints would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: '68 911S



Here's another vote for the likelihood of this car being a '69, potentially
sold in (and titled as a) '68.  The 68 911S didn't meet the States first big 

emissions year, so wasn't imported.  The 911L replaced it, and was an
S with the E-engine - all the trim of the S, but the 130 hp engine.  The 68
'S' in Europe was indeed a Weber car, and short wheelbase of course.
The '68 car serial numbers start with 118.  And yes, there are a few that
have made there way into the States and Canada.

All that said, the '69 S is a nice find.  A lot of people, once settled on 
the
slightly flared fenders and the fuel injection, lean towards the last of the
series ('73).  But the '69 has all the important improvements (4 vented
discs, dual circuit master cylinder, updated front suspension, actually
obtainable interior parts) with the smaller displacement,  peakier (more
entertaining?) engine.

Subject: 924 Horror Story! Ahhh!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I witnessed a true assault on the good Doctor's name.  Thankfully
this trajedy didn't involve my 924, but it was painful just the same.  I
was travelling on I-75 into Atlanta in my '77 924 coming back to 
Charlotte from a weekend visiting my brother in Chattanooga, TN.  In my
rear view mirror I spotted a familiar silhouette, that of a 924.  I was
getting prepared to wave at the fellow 924 when I made out the electric
purple color on the car.  I also noted it was riding a bit lower than my
stock 924.  What drove up beside me was nausiating.  Not only was the 
924 painted electric purple with fishing boat sparkle paint, but it had
been lowered and shod with tiny chrome wheels with ultra low profile
tires.  It had a sizeable chunk of sheetmetal gouged out of the front
fender and door from an accident.  It had a HUGE whale tail glued (at 
least I assume it was glued, no way could the hatch survive hole 
drilling) to the hatch.  Also, white coolant smelling smoke puffed from
its LOUD exhaust.  Head gasket time!  Over the loud exhaust could be 
heard a soft boom-boom from a stereo.  
	I gave the 924 a half hearted wave but I don't know if he waved
back, the windows were tinted too dark.  I thought this kind of 
"customization" only happened to BMWs and Mercedes!  I've never see the 
"drug dealer" package applied to a Porsche!  Could this be the start of

   side of the cam (away from the lobe). #1 and #4 intake valves are
   on opposite sides of the motor, on the top, rearmost end of the motor

4. Install timing chains, gears, dowel pins, washers, and nuts on the
   ends of the cams. Tighten the nuts (no need to get carried away,
   just tight enough to flatten the spring washers).
  
5. Pick a cam, install dial indicator on cam housing overhanging the
   intake valve (either #1 or #4, depending on which side you're doing).
   You will need a special bracket to mount the dial indicator. The probe
   of the dial indicator needs to be positioned such that it has a straight 
   shot at the valve spring retaining collar. It should contact the flat 
   surface on the top of the collar and be preloaded sufficiently (i.e.
   0.200 in) and zeroed such that when the valve opens, it will be able to
   register the required valve lift.

6. Rotate the crank 360 degrees. When you start getting close (within 45-30
   degrees), start watching the dial indicator. When the Z1 mark is aligned 
   at the the case split, check to see how far the valve has opened.  It is
   a little tricky reading the dial indicator because the needle moves
   backwards (counterclockwise) as the valve opens.  In the case of a 2.2 L
   911 T, I wanted about 0.096 in of lift.  This is different according to
   whether you have a T, E, or S.  The T has the least lift, the S has the
   most.

7. If you are not within tolerance, remove the cam nut and dowel pin,
   being careful to not disturb the position of the cam. Using the cam
   holding socket, watch the dial indicator and rotate the cam (which 
   will now rotate independently of the timing gear) very slightly as 
   needed until the correct lift is indicated on the dial indicator.
   Insert the dowel pin to lock the timing gear to the cam. Put the
   cam washer and nut back on, tighten, and double check.
  
8. Repeat for other cam.

I posted a while ago about my HOT running C2,

The problem is that the oil never passes the oil-thermostat,
(located just in front of the right rear fender)
so the oil never gets to the oil-cooler....
I'm going to try to replace the thermostat and the two rubber hoses
that connects to it.

A fellow p-phile heard this:
     Apparently the oil thermostat is changed from the inside the car. 
     Behind the passenger seat are two panels, one on the side and the 
     other on the floor, which need to be removed.  The mechanics called it 
     a pain in the a...  He cautioned to also change the hoses, as they do 
     tend to leak - something about German rubber.  

Anyone could verify this? and please add a little more details?
Seems like it should be changed from the outside, also
I'm not yet sure where one of the rubber hoses go...

Thanks,
Henrik

ps.
Both the hose started to leak and the thermostat failed, :-(
maybe this is due to switching to synthetic oil one week before?
Again it might just be a coincidence. :-)

Tom, unless you have a secret stash of freon, you will not be allowed 
to buy any to "fill it up".

Take your car to a qualified A/C technician and have your problem 
repaired, properly, so that it works properly, efficiently, cheaply, and does

I once owned an early 944 that did the same sort of thing - made a strange

I have been a listener, if you will, on this list for a while. ( a couple of
months) but now I feel like I really belong, because I took delivery of a Red
944 last Sunday.  Really a pretty car to me.  However, I do hear a noise that
is somewhat disturbing.  When I coast to a stop or brake gently, I hear what
sounds like a rubbing or soft grinding noise, like maybe there is a problem
in one of the wheels.  I hear this noise only when the car is rolling, so I
don't think it has anything to do with the engine. 

 What further confounds me, is that It felt like the clutch was slipping a
little bit today after the car had been driven for a while.  I drove the car
later and there seemed to be no slippage, but the car had cooled off.  Could
be temperature related??  Any suggestions?  I know George seems to have lots
of answers.  I tried to send Him private E-mail about a week ago, but the
message came back.. 

 Who is her Majesty?  or did I just find out today when she didn't want to

Cory,

The TWM (not TMW) throttle bodies are OK but not great.  We put a set on
a customer car a while back.  Well, we put the second set on.  The first
set got sent back to TWM because of binding of the butterflies to the
bodies, a problem which TWM described as being "not uncommon."  They were
very good about it, and their package is *very* cost-effective when
compared with, say, a nice guillotine set-up.

We've also done a handful of cars with the F7 system.  It works fine.
The monitoring/programming software leaves a lot to be desired in terms of,
well in terms of a lot of things.  But it is more than adequate to getting
the job done, assuming a) you have a dyno (engine or chassis), and b) you
have a high-speed, wide-range exhaust gas monitor.  Both of which are major
investments.

>I would like to run  6x16/7x16 Fuchs, however I have never seen that

I have seen this combo on a '77 911.  Correct me if I'm wrong (that goes
without saying on this list), but I believe the flares were the same from
'69 to '77.

The thing is, some cars will tolerate more tire/wheel than others.  The
car I saw had 16x7s with 205/55s in the rear and they DIDN'T RUB.  The
fender lips weren't even rolled.  I have also seen 225/50s on 15x7s on the
rear.  I have to imagine that would take some effort to make them the 
225s fit.

Your best bet is a 7x15 wheel with 205/60s.  It is not a sure thing, but this
should fit in the rear.  The fronts are a little more wide open.  I would
decide what will fit in the rear and size the fronts accordingly (don't put
195/50s on 6x15s in the rear and then put 205/55s on 7x16s up front -
T*d already tried that):>). 

Good luck and HTH,

At the factory, they actually match belts to the distrubutors. I've
been told that they have several belt sizes (all withing just a few
fractions of a mm of each other), and they individually size each
distributor to its belt.  The broken belts can really be a problem
at track events, because it's possible for the non-rotating distributor
to fire a single plug 6 times per cycle while the engine's already
running plenty hot.  If it goes unnoticed, people have ended up
with one toasted cylinder....

The 968 rear wiper does have a different part number.  It is also _$150_
_cheaper_ than the motor for the '88 944.  I would love to know that I can

Subject: 944/951 A/C

A few days ago it finally got hot enough to roll up the windows and turn on
the A/C. Nothing happened...
I stopped in to a local auto A/C shop to have them check it out. The tech
told me that the system "held vacuum OK, but we tried recharging it 3 times
and it wouldn't accept any Freon". He suggested I take it to the Porsche
shop because it must be something "peculiar to Porsches".
Anybody heard of this before? I've checked the 944 FAQ, and the A/C
problems section is not done yet. The fact that there *is* an A/C section
makes me think there may be some common problems. I've made it a point to
run the system about 20 minutes a month during the winter, as Porsche
recommends.
Any tips, clues or hints would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: '68 911S



Here's another vote for the likelihood of this car being a '69, potentially
sold in (and titled as a) '68.  The 68 911S didn't meet the States first big 

emissions year, so wasn't imported.  The 911L replaced it, and was an
S with the E-engine - all the trim of the S, but the 130 hp engine.  The 68
'S' in Europe was indeed a Weber car, and short wheelbase of course.
The '68 car serial numbers start with 118.  And yes, there are a few that
have made there way into the States and Canada.

All that said, the '69 S is a nice find.  A lot of people, once settled on 
the
slightly flared fenders and the fuel injection, lean towards the last of the
series ('73).  But the '69 has all the important improvements (4 vented
discs, dual circuit master cylinder, updated front suspension, actually
obtainable interior parts) with the smaller displacement,  peakier (more
entertaining?) engine.

Subject: 924 Horror Story! Ahhh!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I witnessed a true assault on the good Doctor's name.  Thankfully
this trajedy didn't involve my 924, but it was painful just the same.  I
was travelling on I-75 into Atlanta in my '77 924 coming back to 
Charlotte from a weekend visiting my brother in Chattanooga, TN.  In my
rear view mirror I spotted a familiar silhouette, that of a 924.  I was
getting prepared to wave at the fellow 924 when I made out the electric
purple color on the car.  I also noted it was riding a bit lower than my
stock 924.  What drove up beside me was nausiating.  Not only was the 
924 painted electric purple with fishing boat sparkle paint, but it had
been lowered and shod with tiny chrome wheels with ultra low profile
tires.  It had a sizeable chunk of sheetmetal gouged out of the front
fender and door from an accident.  It had a HUGE whale tail glued (at 
least I assume it was glued, no way could the hatch survive hole 
drilling) to the hatch.  Also, white coolant smelling smoke puffed from
its LOUD exhaust.  Head gasket time!  Over the loud exhaust could be 
heard a soft boom-boom from a stereo.  
	I gave the 924 a half hearted wave but I don't know if he waved
back, the windows were tinted too dark.  I thought this kind of 
"customization" only happened to BMWs and Mercedes!  I've never see the 
"drug dealer" package applied to a Porsche!  Could this be the start of
a trend?  Has anyone else seen this gaudy 924 around the Atlanta area?
Are there any other P-cars you guys have seen this done to?  
	Anyway, at least I had an excellent time carving TN country roads
in The Bastard with my brother and his 914 2.0.  The Bastard is much
faster in the straights but he catches up in the corners.  He doesn't 
like to get behind me though, he claims my car smells!  I still need to
rebuild the six (ugh!) carbs...  Let me know if anyone has seen any other
atrocious Porsches.  Thanks!

Subject: 911 mystery part, cam timing

When removing my engine, a aluminum bush/spacer fell out.
it is cylindrical (actually an annulus) 3.7 cm long, 1.8 cm 
outer diam, 0.8 cm inner diam.

Can anyone tell me what it is/where it goes?

Thanks,

 -Mitch Craig - hcrms@chevron.com

p.s. Got the cams' end play and timing set Saturday.
Here's how I timed the cams:
(parts of this are in the factory workshop manual):

1. Remove all spark plugs, install rockers on #1 and #4 intake valves
   and adjust valves with cams turned so that the rocker foot is on the back
   side of the cam (away from the lobe). #1 and #4 intake valves are
   on opposite sides of the motor, on the top, rearmost end of the motor
   (The end of the engine with the crank pulley).

2. Turn the crank so that the Z1 mark on the pulley points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position, in line with the joint between the case halves.
   This is TDC.

3. Turn the cams so the the dots on their ends points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position.

4. Install timing chains, gears, dowel pins, washers, and nuts on the
   ends of the cams. Tighten the nuts (no need to get carried away,
   just tight enough to flatten the spring washers).
  
5. Pick a cam, install dial indicator on cam housing overhanging the
   intake valve (either #1 or #4, depending on which side you're doing).
   You will need a special bracket to mount the dial indicator. The probe
   of the dial indicator needs to be positioned such that it has a straight 
   shot at the valve spring retaining collar. It should contact the flat 
   surface on the top of the collar and be preloaded sufficiently (i.e.
   0.200 in) and zeroed such that when the valve opens, it will be able to
   register the required valve lift.

6. Rotate the crank 360 degrees. When you start getting close (within 45-30
   degrees), start watching the dial indicator. When the Z1 mark is aligned 
   at the the case split, check to see how far the valve has opened.  It is
   a little tricky reading the dial indicator because the needle moves
   backwards (counterclockwise) as the valve opens.  In the case of a 2.2 L
   911 T, I wanted about 0.096 in of lift.  This is different according to
   whether you have a T, E, or S.  The T has the least lift, the S has the
   most.

7. If you are not within tolerance, remove the cam nut and dowel pin,
   being careful to not disturb the position of the cam. Using the cam
   holding socket, watch the dial indicator and rotate the cam (which 
   will now rotate independently of the timing gear) very slightly as 
   needed until the correct lift is indicated on the dial indicator.
   Insert the dowel pin to lock the timing gear to the cam. Put the
   cam washer and nut back on, tighten, and double check.
  
8. Repeat for other cam.

If you really have a mechanical interest, than the factory workshop manuals
are a must and reference.

Subject: Replacing oil-thermostat

I posted a while ago about my HOT running C2,

The problem is that the oil never passes the oil-thermostat,
(located just in front of the right rear fender)
so the oil never gets to the oil-cooler....
I'm going to try to replace the thermostat and the two rubber hoses
that connects to it.

A fellow p-phile heard this:
     Apparently the oil thermostat is changed from the inside the car. 
     Behind the passenger seat are two panels, one on the side and the 
     other on the floor, which need to be removed.  The mechanics called it 
     a pain in the a...  He cautioned to also change the hoses, as they do 
     tend to leak - something about German rubber.  

Anyone could verify this? and please add a little more details?
Seems like it should be changed from the outside, also
I'm not yet sure where one of the rubber hoses go...

Thanks,
Henrik
henrik@chronologic.com

ps.
Both the hose started to leak and the thermostat failed, :-(
maybe this is due to switching to synthetic oil one week before?
Again it might just be a coincidence. :-)

Am new to Porsche; however I do like a hands on approach. I am a member

service. I know there are compressors and what have you that are also 
involved which I don't plan to get involved with.

I checked the owners manual and it did not say where to fill her up, as 
it were. The manual does not tell you how to check the transmission fluid 
level?? I've been involved with cvars, as a hobby, since the early '70s.

So far I've replaced the sunroof cables, belts and done oil cxhanges.

Tom, unless you have a secret stash of freon, you will not be allowed 
to buy any to "fill it up".

Take your car to a qualified A/C technician and have your problem 
repaired, properly, so that it works properly, efficiently, cheaply, and does 
not pollute the environment.
Good Luck!

Subject: Air conditioning unit

There is another option with the degree of pain directly related to how 
close you stay to the coast <g> on the way down.

By all reports, and personal experience, Performance Aire/Scotts Independent 
Porsche, 1885 S Santa Cruz St, Anaheim, CA 92805, 714-634-2027 are the best 
there is for 911 A/C. You might want to plan a day at Disneyland and include 
them on the trip. Only partly joking because they really are only minutes 
from Disneyland/Angel Stadium/The Pond etc.

>I just recently purchased my 911s a couple of months ago.  It came with a
non-functioning air conditioning unit.  It's getting quite hot now since the
summer is finally here and I was just wondering how much it would cost to
fix this thing.  If I did fix it, would it last and would it be worth it?  I
was thinking of driving down to LA from Vancouver (2500 miles) next month
and I would think that I'd be boiling in my black car with black leather
seats if I didn't have air con bracket to mount the dial indicator. The probe
   of the dial indicator needs to be positioned such that it has a straight 
   shot at the valve spring retaining collar. It should contact the flat 
   surface on the top of the collar and be preloaded sufficiently (i.e.
   0.200 in) and zeroed such that when the valve opens, it will be able to
   register the required valve lift.

6. Rotate the crank 360 degrees. When you start getting close (within 45-30
   degrees), start watching the dial indicator. When the Z1 mark is aligned 
   at the the case split, check to see how far the valve has opened.  It is
   a little tricky reading the dial indicator because the needle moves
   backwards (counterclockwise) as the valve opens.  In the case of a 2.2 L
   911 T, I wanted about 0.096 in of lift.  This is different according to
   whether you have a T, E, or S.  The T has the least lift, the S has the
   most.

7. If you are not within tolerance, remove the cam nut and dowel pin,
   being careful to not disturb the position of the cam. Using the cam
   holding socket, watch the dial indicator and rotate the cam (which 
   will now rotate independently of the timing gear) very slightly as 
   needed until the correct lift is indicated on the dial indicator.
   Insert the dowel pin to lock the timing gear to the cam. Put the
   cam washer and nut back on, tighten, and double check.
  
8. Repeat for other cam.

Subject: Replacing oil-thermostat

I posted a while ago about my HOT running C2,

The problem is that the oil never passes the oil-thermostat,
(located just in front of the right rear fender)
so the oil never gets to the oil-cooler....
I'm going to try to replace the thermostat and the two rubber hoses
that connects to it.

A fellow p-phile heard this:
     Apparently the oil thermostat is changed from the inside the car. 
     Behind the passenger seat are two panels, one on the side and the 
     other on the floor, which need to be removed.  The mechanics called it 
     a pain in the a...  He cautioned to also change the hoses, as they do 
     tend to leak - something about German rubber.  

Anyone could verify this? and please add a little more details?
Seems like it should be changed from the outside, also
I'm not yet sure where one of the rubber hoses go...

Thanks,
Henrik
henrik@chronologic.com

ps.
Both the hose started to leak and the thermostat failed, :-(
maybe this is due to switching to synthetic oil one week before?
Again it might just be a coincidence. :-)

I checked the owners manual and it did not say where to fill her up, as 
it were. The manual does not tell you how to check the transmission fluid

So far I've replaced the sunroof cables, belts and done oil cxhanges.

Hunter,
I once owned an early 944 that did the same sort of thing - made a strange
metallic sort of noise when the door was shut, except mine did it only when
hot.  It turned out to be a piece of heat shielding (I'm not sure which one
exactly - this is what the dealer mechanic told me) in the vicinity of the
catalytic converter.  The dealer just loosened and retightened the shielding,
and no more boing.

I have been a listener, if you will, on this list for a while. ( a couple of
months) but now I feel like I really belong, because I took delivery of a Red
944 last Sunday.  Really a pretty car to me.  However, I do hear a noise that
is somewhat disturbing.  When I coast to a stop or brake gently, I hear what
sounds like a rubbing or soft grinding noise, like maybe there is a problem
in one of the wheels.  I hear this noise only when the car is rolling, so I
don't think it has anything to do with the engine. 

 What further confounds me, is that It felt like the clutch was slipping a
little bit today after the car had been driven for a while.  I drove the car
later and there seemed to be no slippage, but the car had cooled off.  Could
be temperature related??  Any suggestions?  I know George seems to have lots
of answers.  I tried to send Him private E-mail about a week ago, but the
message came back.. 

 Who is her Majesty?  or did I just find out today when she didn't want to
respond without slipping her clutch.

Cory,

The TWM (not TMW) throttle bodies are OK but not great.  We put a set on
a customer car a while back.  Well, we put the second set on.  The first
set got sent back to TWM because of binding of the butterflies to the
bodies, a problem which TWM described as being "not uncommon."  They were
very good about it, and their package is *very* cost-effective when
compared with, say, a nice guillotine set-up.

We've also done a handful of cars with the F7 system.  It works fine.
The monitoring/programming software leaves a lot to be desired in terms of,
well in terms of a lot of things.  But it is more than adequate to getting
the job done, assuming a) you have a dyno (engine or chassis), and b) you
have a high-speed, wide-range exhaust gas monitor.  Both of which are major
investments.

The 968 rear wiper does have a different part number.  It is also _$150_
_cheaper_ than the motor for the '88 944.  I would love to know that I can
use the 968 motor. :-)

Subject: 944/951 A/C

A few days ago it finally got hot enough to roll up the windows and turn on
the A/C. Nothing happened...
I stopped in to a local auto A/C shop to have them check it out. The tech
told me that the system "held vacuum OK, but we tried recharging it 3 times
and it wouldn't accept any Freon". He suggested I take it to the Porsche
shop because it must be something "peculiar to Porsches".
Anybody heard of this before? I've checked the 944 FAQ, and the A/C
problems section is not done yet. The fact that there *is* an A/C section
makes me think there may be some common problems. I've made it a point to
run the system about 20 minutes a month during the winter, as Porsche
recommends.
Any tips, clues or hints would be greatly appreciated.

"I" write:

I just bought one a couple of weeks ago and the latest part number
is:   944 552 553 01 01C.

It was really easy to replace and was well worth the $23.00 I paid
at the local dealership here (Northern Virginia).

I am about to start a 914 project that may include the addition of an
aftermarket FI system to my 2.0 engine.

Does anyone have any experience with the TMW throttle bodies or an injection
control system such as the Haltech F7.

Any advice would be a big help.

sold in (and titled as a) '68.  The 68 911S didn't meet the States first big 

emissions year, so wasn't imported.  The 911L replaced it, and was an
S with the E-engine - all the trim of the S, but the 130 hp engine.  The 68
'S' in Europe was indeed a Weber car, and short wheelbase of course.
The '68 car serial numbers start with 118.  And yes, there are a few that
have made there way into the States and Canada.

All that said, the '69 S is a nice find.  A lot of people, once settled on 
the
slightly flared fenders and the fuel injection, lean towards the last of the
series ('73).  But the '69 has all the important improvements (4 vented
discs, dual circuit master cylinder, updated front suspension, actually
obtainable interior parts) with the smaller displacement,  peakier (more
entertaining?) engine.

Subject: 924 Horror Story! Ahhh!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I witnessed a true assault on the good Doctor's name.  Thankfully
this trajedy didn't involve my 924, but it was painful just the same.  I
was travelling on I-75 into Atlanta in my '77 924 coming back to 
Charlotte from a weekend visiting my brother in Chattanooga, TN.  In my
rear view mirror I spotted a familiar silhouette, that of a 924.  I was
getting prepared to wave at the fellow 924 when I made out the electric
purple color on the car.  I also noted it was riding a bit lower than my
stock 924.  What drove up beside me was nausiating.  Not only was the 
924 painted electric purple with fishing boat sparkle paint, but it had
been lowered and shod with tiny chrome wheels with ultra low profile
tires.  It had a sizeable chunk of sheetmetal gouged out of the front
fender and door from an accident.  It had a HUGE whale tail glued (at 
least I assume it was glued, no way could the hatch survive hole 
drilling) to the hatch.  Also, white coolant smelling smoke puffed from
its LOUD exhaust.  Head gasket time!  Over the loud exhaust could be 
heard a soft boom-boom from a stereo.  
	I gave the 924 a half hearted wave but I don't know if he waved
back, the windows were tinted too dark.  I thought this kind of 
"customization" only happened to BMWs and Mercedes!  I've never see the 
"drug dealer" package applied to a Porsche!  Could this be the start of
a trend?  Has anyone else seen this gaudy 924 around the Atlanta area?
Are there any other P-cars you guys have seen this done to?  
	Anyway, at least I had an excellent time carving TN country roads
in The Bastard with my brother and his 914 2.0.  The Bastard is much
faster in the straights but he catches up in the corners.  He doesn't 
like to get behind me though, he claims my car smells!  I still need to
rebuild the six (ugh!) carbs...  Let me know if anyone has seen any other
atrocious Porsches.  Thanks!

Subject: 911 mystery part, cam timing

When removing my engine, a aluminum bush/spacer fell out.
it is cylindrical (actually an annulus) 3.7 cm long, 1.8 cm 
outer diam, 0.8 cm inner diam.

Can anyone tell me what it is/where it goes?

Thanks,

 -Mitch Craig - hcrms@chevron.com

p.s. Got the cams' end play and timing set Saturday.
Here's how I timed the cams:
(parts of this are in the factory workshop manual):

1. Remove all spark plugs, install rockers on #1 and #4 intake valves
   and adjust valves with cams turned so that the rocker foot is on the back
   side of the cam (away from the lobe). #1 and #4 intake valves are
   on opposite sides of the motor, on the top, rearmost end of the motor
   (The end of the engine with the crank pulley).

2. Turn the crank so that the Z1 mark on the pulley points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position, in line with the joint between the case halves.
   This is TDC.

3. Turn the cams so the the dots on their ends points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position.

4. Install timing chains, gears, dowel pins, washers, and nuts on the
   ends of the cams. Tighten the nuts (no need to get carried away,
   just tight enough to flatten the spring washers).
  
5. Pick a cam, install dial indicator on cam housing overhanging the
   intake valve (either #1 or #4, depending on which side you're doing).
   You will need a specialditioning.

Hunter,
I once owned an early 944 that did the same sort of thing - made a strange
metallic sort of noise when the door was shut, except mine did it only when
hot.  It turned out to be a piece of heat shielding (I'm not sure which one
exactly - this is what the dealer mechanic told me) in the vicinity of the
catalytic converter.  The dealer just loosened and retightened the shielding,
and no more boing.

Sorry, I was adjusting the axial position of the cam sprockets

I have been a listener, if you will, on this list for a while. ( a couple of
months) but now I feel like I really belong, because I took delivery of a Red
944 last Sunday.  Really a pretty car to me.  However, I do hear a noise that
is somewhat disturbing.  When I coast to a stop or brake gently, I hear what
sounds like a rubbing or soft grinding noise, like maybe there is a problem
in one of the wheels.  I hear this noise only when the car is rolling, so I
don't think it has anything to do with the engine. 

 What further confounds me, is that It felt like the clutch was slipping a
little bit today after the car had been driven for a while.  I drove the car
later and there seemed to be no slippage, but the car had cooled off.  Could
be temperature related??  Any suggestions?  I know George seems to have lots
of answers.  I tried to send Him private E-mail about a week ago, but the
message came back.. 

 Who is her Majesty?  or did I just find out today when she didn't want to
respond without slipping her clutch.

Cory,

The TWM (not TMW) throttle bodies are OK but not great.  We put a set on
a customer car a while back.  Well, we put the second set on.  The first
set got sent back to TWM because of binding of the butterflies to the
bodies, a problem which TWM described as being "not uncommon."  They were
very good about it, and their package is *very* cost-effective when
compared with, say, a nice guillotine set-up.

We've also done a handful of cars with the F7 system.  It works fine.
The monitoring/programming software leaves a lot to be desired in terms of,
well in terms of a lot of things.  But it is more than adequate to getting
the job done, assuming a) you have a dyno (engine or chassis), and b) you
have a high-speed, wide-range exhaust gas monitor.  Both of which are major
investments.

>I would like to run  6x16/7x16 Fuchs, however I have never seen that

I have seen this combo on a '77 911.  Correct me if I'm wrong (that goes
without saying on this list), but I believe the flares were the same from
'69 to '77.

The thing is, some cars will tolerate more tire/wheel than others.  The
car I saw had 16x7s with 205/55s in the rear and they DIDN'T RUB.  The
fender lips weren't even rolled.  I have also seen 225/50s on 15x7s on the
rear.  I have to imagine that would take some effort to make them the 
225s fit.

Your best bet is a 7x15 wheel with 205/60s.  It is not a sure thing, but this
should fit in the rear.  The fronts are a little more wide open.  I would
decide what will fit in the rear and size the fronts accordingly (don't put
195/50s on 6x15s in the rear and then put 205/55s on 7x16s up front -
T*d already tried that):>). 

Good luck and HTH,

At the factory, they actually match belts to the distrubutors. I've
been told that they have several belt sizes (all withing just a few
fractions of a mm of each other), and they individually size each
distributor to its belt.  The broken belts can really be a problem
at track events, because it's possible for the non-rotating distributor
to fire a single plug 6 times per cycle while the engine's already
running plenty hot.  If it goes unnoticed, people have ended up
with one toasted cylinder....

>combination on an early 911 before.

I have seen this combo on a '77 911.  Correct me if I'm wrong (that goes
without saying on this list), but I believe the flares were the same from
'69 to '77.

The thing is, some cars will tolerate more tire/wheel than others.  The
car I saw had 16x7s with 205/55s in the rear and they DIDN'T RUB.  The
fender lips weren't even rolled.  I have also seen 225/50s on 15x7s on the
rear.  I have to imagine that would take some effort to make them the 
225s fit.

Your best bet is a 7x15 wheel with 205/60s.  It is not a sure thing, but this
should fit in the rear.  The fronts are a little more wide open.  I would
decide what will fit in the rear and size the fronts accordingly (don't put
195/50s on 6x15s in the rear and then put 205/55s on 7x16s up front -
T*d already tried that):>). 

Good luck and HTH,

Mike Dayton

At the factory, they actually match belts to the distrubutors. I've
been told that they have several belt sizes (all withing just a few
fractions of a mm of each other), and they individually size each
distributor to its belt.  The broken belts can really be a problem
at track events, because it's possible for the non-rotating distributor
to fire a single plug 6 times per cycle while the engine's already
running plenty hot.  If it goes unnoticed, people have ended up
with one toasted cylinder....

The 968 rear wiper does have a different part number.  It is also _$150_
_cheaper_ than the motor for the '88 944.  I would love to know that I can
use the 968 motor. :-)

Subject: 944/951 A/C

A few days ago it finally got hot enough to roll up the windows and turn on
the A/C. Nothing happened...
I stopped in to a local auto A/C shop to have them check it out. The tech
told me that the system "held vacuum OK, but we tried recharging it 3 times
and it wouldn't accept any Freon". He suggested I take it to the Porsche
shop because it must be something "peculiar to Porsches".
Anybody heard of this before? I've checked the 944 FAQ, and the A/C
problems section is not done yet. The fact that there *is* an A/C section
makes me think there may be some common problems. I've made it a point to
run the system about 20 minutes a month during the winter, as Porsche
recommends.
Any tips, clues or hints would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: '68 911S



Here's another vote for the likelihood of this car being a '69, potentially
sold in (and titled as a) '68.  The 68 911S didn't meet the States first big 

emissions year, so wasn't imported.  The 911L replaced it, and was an
S with the E-engine - all the trim of the S, but the 130 hp engine.  The 68
'S' in Europe was indeed a Weber car, and short wheelbase of course.
The '68 car serial numbers start with 118.  And yes, there are a few that
have made there way into the States and Canada.

All that said, the '69 S is a nice find.  A lot of people, once settled on 
the
slightly flared fenders and the fuel injection, lean towards the last of the
series ('73).  But the '69 has all the important improvements (4 vented
discs, dual circuit master cylinder, updated front suspension, actually
obtainable interior parts) with the smaller displacement,  peakier (more
entertaining?) engine.

Subject: 924 Horror Story! Ahhh!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I witnessed a true assault on the good Doctor's name.  Thankfully
this trajedy didn't involve my 924, but it was painful just the same.  I
was travelling on I-75 into Atlanta in my '77 924 coming back to 
Charlotte from a weekend visiting my brother in Chattanooga, TN.  In my
rear view mirror I spotted a familiar silhouette, that of a 924.  I was
getting prepared to wave at the fellow 924 when I made out the electric
purple color on the car.  I also noted it was riding a bit lower than my
stock 924.  What drove up beside me was nausiating.  Not only was the 
924 painted electric purple with fishing boat sparkle paint, but it had
been lowered and shod with tiny chrome wheels with ultra low profile
tires.  It had a sizeable chunk of sheetmetal gouged out of the front
fender and door from an accident.  It had a HUGE whale tail glued (at 
least I assume it was glued, no way could the hatch survive hole 
drilling) to the hatch.  Also, white coolant smelling smoke puffed from
its LOUD exhaust.  Head gasket time!  Over the loud exhaust could be 
heard a soft boom-boom from a stereo.  
	I gave the 924 a half hearted wave but I don't know if he waved
back, the windows were tinted too dark.  I thought this kind of 
"customization" only happened to BMWs and Mercedes!  I've never see the 
"drug dealer" package applied to a Porsche!  Could this be the start of
a trend?  Has anyone else seen this gaudy 924 around the Atlanta area?
Are there any other P-cars you guys have seen this done to?  
	Anyway, at least I had an excellent time carving TN country roads
in The Bastard with my brother and his 914 2.0.  The Bastard is much
faster in the straights but he catches up in the corners.  He doesn't 
like to get behind me though, he claims my car smells!  I still need to
rebuild the six (ugh!) carbs...  Let me know if anyone has seen any other
atrocious Porsches.  Thanks!

Subject: 911 mystery part, cam timing

When removing my engine, a aluminum bush/spacer fell out.
it is cylindrical (actually an annulus) 3.7 cm long, 1.8 cm 
outer diam, 0.8 cm inner diam.

Can anyone tell me what it is/where it goes?

Thanks,

 -Mitch Craig - hcrms@chevron.com

p.s. Got the cams' end play and timing set Saturday.
Here's how I timed the cams:
(parts of this are in the factory workshop manual):

1. Remove all spark plugs, install rockers on #1 and #4 intake valves
   and adjust valves with cams turned so that the rocker foot is on the back
   side of the cam (away from the lobe). #1 and #4 intake valves are
   on opposite sides of the motor, on the top, rearmost end of the motor
   (The end of the engine with the crank pulley).

2. Turn the crank so that the Z1 mark on the pulley points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position, in line with the joint between the case halves.
   This is TDC.

3. Turn the cams so the the dots on their ends points straight up,
   in the 12:00 position.

4. Install timing chains, gears, dowel pins, washers, and nuts on the
   ends of the cams. Tighten the nuts (no need to get carried away,
   just tight enough to flatten the spring washers).
  
5. Pick a cam, install dial indicator on cam housing overhanging the
   intake valve (either #1 or #4, depending on which side you're doing).
   You will need a special bracket to mount the dial indicator. The probe
   of the dial indicator needs to be positioned such that it has a straight 
   shot at the valve spring retaining collar. It should contact the flat 
   surface on the top of the collar and be preloaded sufficiently (i.e.
   0.200 in) and zeroed such that when the valve opens, it will be able to
   register the required valve lift.

6. Rotate the crank 360 degrees. When you start getting close (within 45-30
   degrees), start watching the dial indicator. When the Z1 mark is aligned 
   at the the case split, check to see how far the valve has opened.  It is
   a little tricky reading the dial indicator because the needle moves
   backwards (counterclockwise) as the valve opens.  In the case of a 2.2 L
   911 T, I wanted about 0.096 in of lift.  This is different according to
   whether you have a T, E, or S.  The T has the least lift, the S has the
   most.

7. If you are not within tolerance, remove the cam nut and dowel pin,
   being careful to not disturb the position of the cam. Using the cam
   holding socket, watch the dial indicator and rotate the cam (which 
   will now rotate independently of the timing gear) very slightly as 
   needed until the correct lift is indicated on the dial indicator.
   Insert the dowel pin to lock the timing gear to the cam. Put the
   cam washer and nut back on, tighten, and double check.
  
8. Repeat for other cam.

Subject: Replacing oil-thermostat

I posted a while ago about my HOT running C2,

The problem is that the oil never passes the oil-thermostat,
(located just in front of the right rear fender)
so the oil never gets to the oil-cooler....
I'm going to try to replace the thermostat and the two rubber hoses
that connects to it.

A fellow p-phile heard this:
     Apparently the oil thermostat is changed from the inside the car. 
     Behind the passenger seat are two panels, one on the side and the 
     other on the floor, which need to be removed.  The mechanics called it 
     a pain in the a...  He cautioned to also change the hoses, as they do 
     tend to leak - something about German rubber.  

Anyone could verify this? and please add a little more details?
Seems like it should be changed from the outside, also
I'm not yet sure where one of the rubber hoses go...

Thanks,
Henrik
henrik@chronologic.com

ps.
Both the hose started to leak and the thermostat failed, :-(
maybe this is due to switching to synthetic oil one week before?
Again it might just be a coincidence. :-)

Am new to Porsche; however I do like a hands on approach. I am a member

service. I know there are compressors and what have you that are also 
involved which I don't plan to get involved with.

I checked the owners manual and it did not say where to fill her up, as 
it were. The manual does not tell you how to check the transmission fluid

So far I've replaced the sunroof cables, belts and done oil cxhanges.

Tom, unless you have a secret stash of freon, you will not be allowed 
to buy any to "fill it up".

Take your car to a qualified A/C technician and have your problem 
repaired, properly, so that it works properly, efficiently, cheaply, and does 
not pollute the environment.

Subject: Air conditioning unit

There is another option with the degree of pain directly related to how 
close you stay to the coast <g> on the way down.

By all reports, and personal experience, Performance Aire/Scotts Independent 
Porsche, 1885 S Santa Cruz St, Anaheim, CA 92805, 714-634-2027 are the best 
there is for 911 A/C. You might want to plan a day at Disneyland and include 
them on the trip. Only partly joking because they really are only minutes 
from Disneyland/Angel Stadium/The Pond etc.

>I just recently purchased my 911s a couple of months ago.  It came with a
non-functioning air conditioning unit.  It's getting quite hot now since the
summer is finally here and I was just wondering how much it would cost to
fix this thing.  If I did fix it, would it last and would it be worth it?  I
was thinking of driving down to LA from Vancouver (2500 miles) next month
and I would think that I'd be boiling in my black car with black leather
seats if I didn't have air con bracket to mount the dial indicator. The probe
   of the dial indicator needs to be positioned such that it has a straight 
   shot at the valve spring retaining collar. It should contact the flat 
   surface on the top of the collar and be preloaded sufficiently (i.e.
   0.200 in) and zeroed such that when the valve opens, it will be able to
   register the required valve lift.

6. Rotate the crank 360 degrees. When you start getting close (within 45-30
   degrees), start watching the dial indicator. When the Z1 mark is aligned 
   at the the case split, check to see how far the valve has opened.  It is
   a little tricky reading the dial indicator because the needle moves
   backwards (counterclockwise) as the valve opens.  In the case of a 2.2 L
   911 T, I wanted about 0.096 in of lift.  This is different according to
   whether you have a T, E, or S.  The T has the least lift, the S has the
   most.

7. If you are not within tolerance, remove the cam nut and dowel pin,
   being careful to not disturb the position of the cam. Using the cam
   holding socket, watch the dial indicator and rotate the cam (which 
   will now rotate independently of the timing gear) very slightly as 
   needed until the correct lift is indicated on the dial indicator.
   Insert the dowel pin to lock the timing gear to the cam. Put the
   cam washer and nut back on, tighten, and double check.
  
8. Repeat for other cam.

Subject: Replacing oil-thermostat

I posted a while ago about my HOT running C2,

The problem is that the oil never passes the oil-thermostat,
(located just in front of the right rear fender)
so the oil never gets to the oil-cooler....
I'm going to try to replace the thermostat and the two rubber hoses
that connects to it.

A fellow p-phile heard this:
     Apparently the oil thermostat is changed from the inside the car. 
     Behind the passenger seat are two panels, one on the side and the 
     other on the floor, which need to be removed.  The mechanics called it 
     a pain in the a...  He cautioned to also change the hoses, as they do 
     tend to leak - something about German rubber.  

Anyone could verify this? and please add a little more details?
Seems like it should be changed from the outside, also
I'm not yet sure where one of the rubber hoses go...

Thanks,
Henrik
henrik@chronologic.com

ps.
Both the hose started to leak and the thermostat failed, :-(
maybe this is due to switching to synthetic oil one week before?
Again it might just be a coincidence. :-)

I checked the owners manual and it did not say where to fill her up, as 
it were. The manual does not tell you how to check the transmission fluid

So far I've replaced the sunroof cables, belts and done oil cxhanges.

Tom, unless you have a secret stash of freon, you will not be allowed 
to buy any to "fill it up".

Take your car to a qualified A/C technician and have your problem 
repaired, properly, so that it works properly, efficiently, cheaply, and does 
not pollute the environment.
Good Luck!

Hunter,
I once owned an early 944 that did the same sort of thing - made a strange
metallic sort of noise when the door was shut, except mine did it only when
hot.  It turned out to be a piece of heat shielding (I'm not sure which one
exactly - this is what the dealer mechanic told me) in the vicinity of the
catalytic converter.  The dealer just loosened and retightened the shielding,
and no more boing.

I have been a listener, if you will, on this list for a while. ( a couple of
months) but now I feel like I really belong, because I took delivery of a Red
944 last Sunday.  Really a pretty car to me.  However, I do hear a noise that
is somewhat disturbing.  When I coast to a stop or brake gently, I hear what
sounds like a rubbing or soft grinding noise, like maybe there is a problem
in one of the wheels.  I hear this noise only when the car is rolling, so I
don't think it has anything to do with the engine. 

 What further confounds me, is that It felt like the clutch was slipping a
little bit today after the car had been driven for a while.  I drove the car
later and there seemed to be no slippage, but the car had cooled off.  Could
be temperature related??  Any suggestions?  I know George seems to have lots
of answers.  I tried to send Him private E-mail about a week ago, but the
message came back.. 

 Who is her Majesty?  or did I just find out today when she didn't want to
respond without slipping her clutch.

Cory,

The TWM (not TMW) throttle bodies are OK but not great.  We put a set on
a customer car a while back.  Well, we put the second set on.  The first
set got sent back to TWM because of binding of the butterflies to the
bodies, a problem which TWM described as being "not uncommon."  They were
very good about it, and their package is *very* cost-effective when
compared with, say, a nice guillotine set-up.

We've also done a handful of cars with the F7 system.  It works fine.
The monitoring/programming software leaves a lot to be desired in terms of,
well in terms of a lot of things.  But it is more than adequate to getting
the job done, assuming a) you have a dyno (engine or chassis), and b) you
have a high-speed, wide-range exhaust gas monitor.  Both of which are major
investments.

I have seen this combo on a '77 911.  Correct me if I'm wrong (that goes
without saying on this list), but I believe the flares were the same from
'69 to '77.

The thing is, some cars will tolerate more tire/wheel than others.  The
car I saw had 16x7s with 205/55s in the rear and they DIDN'T RUB.  The
fender lips weren't even rolled.  I have also seen 225/50s on 15x7s on the
rear.  I have to imagine that would take some effort to make them the 
225s fit.

Your best bet is a 7x15 wheel with 205/60s.  It is not a sure thing, but this
should fit in the rear.  The fronts are a little more wide open.  I would
decide what will fit in the rear and size the fronts accordingly (don't put
195/50s on 6x15s in the rear and then put 205/55s on 7x16s up front -
T*d already tried that):>). 

Good luck and HTH,

At the factory, they actually match belts to the distrubutors. I've
been told that they have several belt sizes (all withing just a few
fractions of a mm of each other), and they individually size each
distributor to its belt.  The broken belts can really be a problem
at track events, because it's possible for the non-rotating distributor
to fire a single plug 6 times per cycle while the engine's already
running plenty hot.  If it goes unnoticed, people have ended up
with one toasted cylinder....

Just had the same thing on my '83 944.  It's obviously the starter solenoid
which luckily is VERY easy to replace.  Shop around,  many people will say
you can't get just the solenoid but I got mine from a general
alternator/starter rebuild firm for $34.  It's working great!!!!

Subject: Boing!

Hunter,
I once owned an early 944 that did the same sort of thing - made a strange
metallic sort of noise when the door was shut, except mine did it only when
hot.  It turned out to be a piece of heat shielding (I'm not sure which one
exactly - this is what the dealer mechanic told me) in the vicinity of the
catalytic converter.  The dealer just loosened and retightened the shielding,
and no more boing.

Sorry, I was adjusting the axial position of the cam sprockets 
(selecting the correct number of spacers), making sure that the
cam sprockets were properly aligned with the intermediate shaft
sprockets.

I have been a listener, if you will, on this list for a while. ( a couple of
months) but now I feel like I really belong, because I took delivery of a Red
944 last Sunday.  Really a pretty car to me.  However, I do hear a noise that
is somewhat disturbing.  When I coast to a stop or brake gently, I hear what
sounds like a rubbing or soft grinding noise, like maybe there is a problem
in one of the wheels.  I hear this noise only when the car is rolling, so I
don't think it has anything to do with the engine. 

 What further confounds me, is that It felt like the clutch was slipping a
little bit today after the car had been driven for a while.  I drove the car
later and there seemed to be no slippage, but the car had cooled off.  Could
be temperature related??  Any suggestions?  I know George seems to have lots
of answers.  I tried to send Him private E-mail about a week ago, but the
message came back.. 

 Who is her Majesty?  or did I just find out today when she didn't want to
respond without slipping her clutch.

Cory,

The TWM (not TMW) throttle bodies are OK but not great.  We put a set on
a customer car a while back.  Well, we put the second set on.  The first
set got sent back to TWM because of binding of the butterflies to the
bodies, a problem which TWM described as being "not uncommon."  They were
very good about it, and their package is *very* cost-effective when
compared with, say, a nice guillotine set-up.

We've also done a handful of cars with the F7 system.  It works fine.
The monitoring/programming software leaves a lot to be desired in terms of,
well in terms of a lot of things.  But it is more than adequate to getting
the job done, assuming a) you have a dyno (engine or chassis), and b) you
have a high-speed, wide-range exhaust gas monitor.  Both of which are major
investments.

Festival participants is unchanged --$75 as shown in the form below.

We are expecting all the Monterey Historic Race participants(racers),
and celebrities at the Friday night dinner --- HMSA and Chrysler

Note that the TIME IS SHORT TO SIGN UP for the Festival. There will
be NO ON-SITE REGISTRATION ---- all is being done by mail in advance.

>combination on an early 911 before.

I have seen this combo on a '77 911.  Correct me if I'm wrong (that goes
without saying on this list), but I believe the flares were the same from
'69 to '77.

The thing is, some cars will tolerate more tire/wheel than others.  The
car I saw had 16x7s with 205/55s in the rear and they DIDN'T RUB.  The
fender lips weren't even rolled.  I have also seen 225/50s on 15x7s on the
rear.  I have to imagine that would take some effort to make them the 
225s fit.

Your best bet is a 7x15 wheel with 205/60s.  It is not a sure thing, but this
should fit in the rear.  The fronts are a little more wide open.  I would
decide what will fit in the rear and size the fronts accordingly (don't put
195/50s on 6x15s in the rear and then put 205/55s on 7x16s up front -
T*d already tried that):>). 

Good luck and HTH,

At the factory, they actually match belts to the distrubutors. I've
been told that they have several belt sizes (all withing just a few
fractions of a mm of each other), and they individually size each
distributor to its belt.  The broken belts can really be a problem
at track events, because it's possible for the non-rotating distributor
to fire a single plug 6 times per cycle while the engine's already
running plenty hot.  If it goes unnoticed, people have ended up
with one toasted cylinder....

   A theft recovery could be the best or the worst....if you get one that
 is really stripped of engine, tranny, interior, you'd better have another
 wrecked car to get parts from;  otherwise you'll be nickle and dimed
 into oblivion. Most salvage yards could make money parting out whole,
 complete cars (since the sum is greater than the whole if you could sell
 everything) and not a part is cheap.

   Usually thieves are very rude, and don't bother to use wrenches to get
 things loose; a lot of theft recoveries have been hacked and replacement
 of electrical harnesses, fuel lines, etc with a hacksaw or cutting torch
 or sledge becomes very inconvenient to us hobbyists...Even a complete,
 recovered car usually comes back in dented enough to require full repaint.

    Bottom line; there are few bargains anywhere in the car world. Once in
 a while you'll find an owner who will give away his car (I just missed
 buying a 2 year old not-running 930 for $3800 once...) but in the salvage
 world you'll find savvy people who eek out a living dealing with damaged
 cars, and they leave few steals for the rest of us. Porsches (or any other
 really exciting car) generally sell for way more than they are worth even
 to the professionals, you are more likely to see a ridiculously high price
 than a low price when a damaged Porsche sells at auction (even the Pros
 get foggy in the head when a sexy car rolls by).

    Behind just about every bargain is usually a lot of hard work on top
 of a low initial price...

I just purchased an 81 911 SC ( not exactly my dream P- car but will do for
now ) 
The eng. was rebuilt 20k ago but the body needs some work so im getting ready
to tear it down. I know right off im going to need all rubber seals(
Windscreen,door,decklid,etc.) 
Any help would be appreciated.   BTW I just subscribed to this newsgroup and
I have noticed not much is said about the 911SC I was woundering why.
                                                          thanks

I'm gnawing on the same problem. I really liked my old K40 built-in
unit, but I want the updated features and performance of the 
Valentine in my '91 C4. The two places I'm considering are:

1) hiding the unit in the third brake light holder,
hopefully without losing the high brake light. I got 
the idea from a prior p'filer post who had mounted his
unit on the rear glass of a 914. This seems to be the stealthiest 
location. Since then I've had more experience with the Valentine
and it's relatively soft volume even on maximum setting.
I'm concerned that in a rear mount I would not hear the alerts 
with windows open or radio on.

2) mounting the unit sort of up under the rear-view mirror so that
the unit is mostly behind the mirror. In this case I would
still use the remote display, but I'm not sure where to
put that yet. This location provides good front and rear 
clear lines for the radar recievers. This is where I'm using
it now, with the suction mount.
In this position, I would fabricate something roughly like the mount
for the rear brake; i.e. solid, sloped to match the windshield,
and reasonably opaque so I can leave the thing there all the time
and not invite theft. 

I don't know if the the radio antenna in the windshield directly
in front of the Valentine degrades performance -- does anyone on the
list have some data on this?

Subject: Bad Day (long)

Hey,

My son and I were on the way home last night and decided
to stop by the video store (about 2.5 miles from our house).
We needed to hurry because a tremendous thunderstorm was
bearing down on us.  I got out of the 911 and as I walked around
to his side, I heard a loud hissing sound.  16 penny nail in the 
right rear tire.  Rather than use the air compressor with the
car, we ran across the street to a Shell station and filled
the spare with their little complimentary air/water thingy.
By this point, the winds were gusting to probably 50mph.  We
made it back to the car and had just enough time to figure
out that the jack receiver on the car was too rusty to get the
jack in before the rain hit.  We took shelter in a supermarket
in the same little shopping center as the video store to wait
out the storm.  The power went out.  I figured this was one of 
those "scattered afternoon and evening thundershowers" and that
the sun would be back out before too long even though it would
be getting dark soon.  It never stopped raining.

Thinking that all I needed to do was clean some of the rust out
of the jack receiver, we waited for the rain to let up some.  As
it was getting dark, I decided to let my son sit in the car (out of
the rain) as I finished the job.  Got the jack in in about 2 or 3 
minutes.  It started raining harder.  Grabbed the lug wrench to 
lossen the lug nuts.  IT WAS THE WRONG SIZE!!!  It didn't fit!  I 
have the tool kit that comes with the car?!?  It didn't fit!!  I took
the jack back out and we go in search of a lug wrench.  With the
storm/power outage/darkness etc., no one seemed to want to
help.  My wife later told me that she thought my problem was
that I was asking people for a "lug wrench".  She said nobody
knows what a lug wrench is, I should have been asking for "tire 
iron".  Yeah, right.

I couldn't reach anyone on the phone (evidently some phone lines
were down) and the intensity of the rain was increasing.  I finally
broke down and bought a can of "Fix-a-Flat".  I figured the tire is
shot anyway, what the hell.  I put the stuff in per the directions 
while mother nature rubbed it in by raining even harder.  The can
didn't seem to make a dent in re-filling the tire so I immediately
drove across the street and filled the tire with air thinking that
this would at least get me the 2.5 miles home.  Wrong.  I made it 
about a mile away when it became obvious that "bad things" were
happening back there.  It was pouring, it was dark, I couldn't put
the spare on anyway, so I drove the rest of the way home on what
was left of the tire.

Luckily, when I got home, I found that the tire was still intact and
that the wheel appeared to be OK.

Shame on me for not checking that the lug wrench in the tool kit
fit the car.  I'm trying to talk my wife into spanking me.  :>)

On the bright side, I get to buy some new tires sooner than I had 
planned.  That is about as bright as it gets, though.

Sorry for the length.

Have a good fourth,

It appears that the sport suspension, M030, on the 968's does not include the

when I noticed that the part numbers were the 944.341.---.--- series. 

I was told that the M030 was the same suspension as used on the 88 Turbo S

It seems odd that Porsche would put the big sway bars, adjustable Konis, 928

Does anyone have any knowledge of the 951 arms being applied to the 968 with

Hi, Doug,

What both the factory and the Haynes manual do not say about the 
87 and new timing belt tensioner is that to remove the tension you do the 
following:

1) Remove the balance shaft belt the old fashioned way...

2) Loosen the two locknuts on the timing belt adjuster.

3) Use the balance shaft sprocket tool to release the tension on the timing
belt, by preloading the tensioner spring.

4) With the tensioner preloaded, tighten the locknuts to hold it in place.

5) Remove the belt by sliding it (with some difficulty) off the camshaft 
sprocket...

6) To remove the belt completely, you have to remove the tensioner but loosening
the three mounting nuts. See the factory service manual for the exact 
location of the
nuts.

Good Luck!

Subject: rust on new porsche oil filter


The recent thread on aftermarket Porsche oil filters encouraged 
me to immediately swap out the aftermarket filter in my '84 944
for a factory part.  I went to the local Porsche dealership to 
get a filter, figuring that I'd endure their price gouging just 
this once. 

When I went to inspect the filter, it had a thin layer of rust
covering the entire mating surface.  I managed to scrape off a 
bit of the rust with my fingernail.  I didn't see any rust inside
the filter. The cardboard box didn't have any signs of water damage.

I showed this to the parts guy, and he said "it probably won't 
hurt it." He went back inside the parts storeroom and came back 
a few minutes later and told me that the filters "were all like 
that."  I handed the filter back to him and he seemed rather
nonchalant about the whole thing.  BTW, this occurred at Lipshy 
Motor Cars in Austin, TX.

Who do you suppose is responsible for allowing these filters to 
become rusted?  Is it the dealership's fault, the manufacturer, 
or someone in between?  The parts storeroom had AC, although they 
could have turned it off when they closed up shop.  It does get 
very humid during these Texas summers.

 Not to worry. What you saw was the casting number.  The basic part is the
same, only the rubber bushings are different.  At one time, no more, you
could buy just the bushings as a racing part. They used them before the Turbo

Subject: REPOST: Braking at track-events?

Hi,

I tried mailing this some weeks ago, but received only one answer,
so I'm trying again, since I'd really like to know :-)

I have a couple of questions for you track-gurus and instructors, since
I've been told different things by different people (and read differently
in Vic Elfords book), and I'd like to know what's the best and why...:

(1) When for instance braking at the end of a long straight - why should
    you downshift through the gears (4-3-2)?

    Isn't it better to just (a) declutch (b) put gently it in second during 
    your brake (or whatever needed at the turn) (c) brake hard (d) heel-and-
    toe some revs to the engine and engage the clutch when you're about 
    finished braking.

    If (1) the brake balance is adjusted perfect such that the front locks
    just a fraction before the rear and (2) your brakes can handle the
    heat - wouldn't the downshifting through the gears (and engage the
    clutch) actually upset the balance in the car?

(2) When braking hard (again :-) ) - should you press down the brake-pedal
    40% first and then do for max preassure or should you just go for max
    pressure immediately and as fast as you can. (Vic Elford says do the 
    40% first to move weight to the front - and then go for max. preasure).


I'd like to know what's the best way of braking - especially after a long
brake. I'm having a tough time getting used to braking as late as I should
so I'd like to know the optimal way before experimenting with later braking.

Thanks,

Christian

From: "Daniel G. Pouzzner" <douzzer@prez.mit.edu>
Subject: Re: REPOST: Braking at track-events?

The reason for sequencing downshifts and engaging the clutch in the
process to affect a deceleration is that, basically, the brakes on
your wheels have their limits. By using the engine as a brake, the
disks have more time to cool. Remember, your engine has an extensive
cooling system, either via air or water, and is much more able to
dissipate the energy of a 3000 pound object moving at 70MPH than those
four metal disks are.

Why do you need to sequence through the shifts? Just for completeness
I thought I'd add that if you skip gears in downshifting, in general
you've either 1) worked the brakes harder than necessary, or 2)
possibly over-rev'd the engine, and probably worked the synchro-mesh
disks harder than necessary. Both options are destructive to your
car, and don't improve your performance.

If your engine, gearbox, and brakes were "ideal" (like an "ideal
gas"), then your best time would come from braking as hard as physics
allows ( (coefficient of rolling friction * 1G ) + aero. downforce) at
the end of a straight section (and accelerating similarly at the start
of the straight section), but there's more than one turn in a typical
race and you'll need the engine and brakes later on, and real hardware
is far from ideal. This is ignoring the obvious economic issues :-).

I'm not sure about the brake-pumping question. Instinct tells me that
that technique just lets you reacquaint yourself with the feel of the
brakes at every turn, and is not necessary from a mechanical
perspective, but I could certainly be missing something. For example,
brake fade is a dynamic phenomenon the driver _must_ be aware of, and
this pumping technique allows him/her to find out how the brakes are
doin'.

That doesn't tell me enough, but it sounds like the compressor wasn't 
running if it wouldn't take any freon.  What readings was the mechanic 
getting on his refrigeration gauges?  The system will take a lot more 
then the required amount and that will just allow more "liquid" freon to 
reach the compressor which is bad if over-charged.  Most systems have a 
low pressure switch on the suction side of the compressor that when it 
gets below 10 pounds pressure shuts system off to protect compressor.  
You will have to jump the contacts to get the compressor to run, fill 
with freon and then remove jumper after you are down or after the system 
has enough pressure to no trip compressor off.  Just holding a vacuum 
tells me that the system is leak free now.  the reason I say now is 
because with all the vibrations and such, automobile a/c systems have a 
terrible reputation for loosing freon.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Buckin' Bronc 912 solved!

Well do I ever have egg on my face (but I'm not alone heh heh). The problem
I was having stemmed from a bad rotor. I am guessing that there was a
hairline crack or something along that line that expanded when hot and
caused the juice to ground out. Hence the violent bucking as it simply
didn't fire whenever this happened. I am definitly breathing a sigh of relief.
She runs like a dream now and about the only thing left thats pressing is
the clutch which I will change next week.
>From all the feedback I have received regarding the vinyl restoration I
think the best method is to send it away and have it redone. But thats
something that can wait until it goes to bed for the winter.

Subject: WANTED: 944 Info/Opinion


I went to see a 944 this weekend, and it'll be my first Porsche (used to 
drive a VW Corrado)...  I was just wondering if someone could give me a 
recommendation plus a little more information on this particular model...

  1984 944 "Weissach Edition"  

Does anyone know what the details of this special edition were?  From 
what I can tell, the changes were limited to cosmetics: gold (vs. black) 
wheels, wider than standard at rear, 911 seats inside.  Anyone have more 
info?

Also, the car's sunroof has MAJOR paint damage -- probably a function of 
being fiberglass instead of steel, plus some heavy-duty stone chips up 
front, but has a full main-dealer service history.  Should I overlook the 
cosmetics in favor of this well-looked-after powertrain?  BTW, the guy's 
asking $5000 for the car.

Well, $5000 sounds about right, but take it to a good Porsche mechanic for a 
checkout first.  Figure about $500 to have the sunroof damage repaired and 
repainted. Figure another $300 to $500 for the stone chips upfront...

There is no option code in the factory fiche for "Weissach Edition"...What you 
describe is a collection of normal factory optional equipment...probably put
together by a dealer who then called it a Weissach (since at the time, there 
were special edition 911s called just that...)
Good Luck!

As the risk of sounding pedantic, if you were to participate in 
a PCA track event with your car, you would see for yourself 
the reasons for following Mr Elford's recommendations.

As an alternative, I would suggest the Skip Barber school, in
whcih they teach you how to beat ABS in a braking situation,
using just those techniques, then they have you practice it 
until it becomes part of your unconscious memory.
Good Luck!

Subject: Original owner and InformationPages

I know how you all like hearing about the Porsche content, so I'll keep 
the web content REAL slim... Check out 
http://tta.com/Porschephiles/InformationPages/356.html

Over time, in order to keep TechTips from overflowing, these pages will 
sprout out of there. Also, check out /Porschephiles/vendor.html and tell 
me what you think. There. Done. On to Porsche content.

I had attempted to contact the original owners of my dad's Porsche 
earlier this year, but their housesitter informed me that they were on 
vacation... So like normal, I put that in the to-do pile and never 
contacted them again, until yesterday. Well, the original owner (who must 
be around 75 or so, since his daughter told me she was 50) had a stroke 
and was not up and about, but still alive. He was, to put it mildly, more 
than shocked to hear about the Porsche after 20 years of not seeing it. 
He had put 1/3 of the miles on that car in the first year and a half. He 
then sold it... (This much we knew from service records)

The car, we found out, has a story about it... We figured as much, but we 
weren't sure. He used it as his daily driver, and did not pull out the 
fuel injection (the second owner did, we aren't sure who that was) The 
911 T had been used on his daughter's honeymoon (quite possibly where 
5000 or so of the miles came from).  We found that the windshield is in 
fact the original (it has the original PCA sticker from his free year of 
membership in the corner)

We are now going to try to keep in touch, and swap photos of the car, now 
and then. We were pleased to say the least, at finding out the car is the 
original color. Whoever re-painted it got EVERY nook and cranny very well 
(yes, the rubber must be well preserved under all that paint *g*) and we 
weren't sure. Not that the paint job is perfect, there is one bubble 
right by the gas fill.

Either way, I talked to his daughter for 20 minutes or so, and we got 
quite a bit of information about the car... They were also shocked to 
hear that the car made it's way to New Jersey (in all it's years with us, 
it went outside of Indiana ONE time, the previous (third) owner never 
took it out of Indiana, and we don't know quite who the hell the second 
one was, there are no real records from then)

Everybody look for that maroon book with clear cover... Call up the 
original owner if they're listed (they should be) and see what you find 
out... Remember, the traditional Porsche owner is in their 40's to 50's, 
so many of them are getting old now, this may be the last chance they 
ever have to see their Porsche. Besides, most of the time, Porsches stay 
in one area, people relocate and sell their Porsche... You might even get 
together with the original owner (hey, who knows, maybe they've got a 993 
they'd let you drive if you let them drive their old Porsche)... Contact 
'em, whaddya got to lose?

Ed;

I had the same problem with my 968 and the dealer fixed it by replacing the
switch for the de-icer as he called it.  I'm not sure if the de-icer is the
same as the receiver/dryer or what but it keeps the compressor from running. 
Can't help on what it should cost to fix since mine was done under warranty. 
Very good idea to run system to lube the seals since they seem to fail very
early.

 P-Philes,
 
 I have one more data point to add to the FRAM FILTERS ARE CR*P discussion:
 
 Last Wednesday I had a FRAM filter burst, creating quite an Exxon Valdez style 
 slick in front of my house.  Luckily, I had just started the vehicle (a 1972 
 Ford F-250 with the dreaded PH8A filter) and it was only idling at the time.
 
 When I looked in the fliter, I was not impressed.  I also noticed that the new 
 PH8A filter I installed was shorter.  I know, I know... but it was the only 
 filter I had in the garage! I'll change it next oil change (It is only a Ford 
 P/U after all....)

I used one on a 240Z (made by CoverCraft, I think), and
it was excellent.  When properly installed you have to 
look carefully to notice it.  In fact, if you were not
familiar with the car, you probably would never know.

It may not work as well for a 911, but my 240Z experience
is at least one point on the curve.

I'd like to replace my fog lights with driving lights.  (not much fog around
here in Utah, but lot's of great night time mountain routes (and daytime as
well))  I'd like something pretty bright.  Do I need to change any other
electrical components?  Any recommendations as far as type, price,
where to buy, etc.

I also have the H1 headlights. (two bulb, I think these are H1) Is this
another alternative for brighter lamps?

HI All:

	The following data is from the 1989 and 1994 PORSCHE
Fact Book.

	1989 SPEEDSTER MSRP Price:	$65,480

	1994 SPEEDSTER MSRP Price:	$66,400

	The 89 SPEEDSTER was based on the wide body 911, while
the 1994 SPEEDSTER was based on the narrow body 911.

	As I recall in 1990, dealers were asking several k$ above
MSRP for the SPEEDSTER.  Does anyone know about what people have
paid for the 94 SPEEDSTER?

	Aslo, does anyone know about the total number of 89 and

Subject: REPOST: Braking at track-events?

Morten Christian Holmgreen got only one reply and asks again:

>(1) When for instance braking at the end of a long straight - why should
>    you downshift through the gears (4-3-2)?

For me, the key-phrase of your question is "at the end of a long straight."
Coming down sequentially through the gears (while simultaneously braking by
heal-and-toe) to reach your "exit-gear" before turn-in may be the best way
to slow your car, using a combination of brakes (80%) and deceleration in
each gear (20%). You should rely on your brakes and not the gear-box to
stop your car, but deceleration in gear while braking helps the slowing
process. You might want to begin this way.

As you gain proficiency in using your brakes and maintaining control of
your car under abrupt deceleration, you may feel comfortable going deeper
into the turn with heavier braking making it unecessary to use some, or
all, intermediate gears before selecting your exit gear by heal and toe,
double-clutching, still braking. If so, you might want to try heavy braking
while in your straight-away gear and then skip-shifting (going, for
example, from 4th to 2nd) while continuing your braking for the turn making
sure that when you release the clutch in second gear (still before turn-in
and at the end of your braking period) you've slowed sufficiently to match
the engine-rpm to the mph of your exit gear. If not, you may seriously
over-rev the engine, and in the excitement, fail to make the turn. Ergo,
broken engine and maybe broken car.

I don't believe there is any standard answer here -- it may depend on the
terminal speed you reach on the straight approaching the turn, your
equipment, the type of turn to negotiate after braking, and most
importantly, the amount of seat-time you bring. A relatively inexperienced
driver should not try the "best" answers you will receive to your questions
until he/she develops the necessary skills to move up to that particular
level of competitive driving. Learning how to drive (or anything else, for
that matter) is like climbing to a series of plateaus. You realize a degree
of improvement, then no progress for a while, then more improvement.

It's like the newstand operator's reply to a first-time New York City
visitor who wanted to know how get to a concert hall (Carnegie Hall).
"Practice man, practice."

See above -- you should downshift and release the clutch while braking, not
"when you're about finished braking."

You've already "upset the balance in the car" during heavy braking -- the
front-end is planted and the rear is light. Downshifting through the gears
won't add to that imbalance.

>(2) When braking hard (again :-) ) - should you press down the brake-pedal

If Vic Elford says so, it must be true. The logic makes sense -- that is,
moderate (40%) braking helps to plant the front tires so they are ready for
100% pedal pressure and the brakes are less likely to lock-up.

But, in my experience on the track (10 years SCCA racing), I never had time
to think about differentiating between 40% and 100% pedal pressure. I
wanted to get inside the guy ahead of me which required 120% pedal
pressure, a small prayer, and then lots of brake pedal modulation to unlock
the brakes. Maybe you've read too far in Elford's book. Master the "basics"
chapters first, then you'll have a fairly informed opinion about the 40%
factor.

>I'd like to know what's the best way of braking - especially after a long

>so I'd like to know the optimal way before experimenting with later braking.

You're certainly asking one of the "right" questions. Learning how to stop
is fundamental to going fast at an autocross, track event, or in racing. In
racing, more passes are made under braking than acceleration. One thing
though, don't ask for more performance than your equipment can deliver.
Heat is the enemy of brakes, so you'll need ways to get air to the front
rotors. And for heavy braking, you'll need tire adhesion, so wheel-weight
the corners of your car to prevent lockup of a light corner at the front of
the car. And finally, if you're on street tires, don't expect a trick brake
setup on your car to do much more than flat-spot your tires and give a
fright to corner workers.

One of the local European Speciality (whatever that is?) shops sales
European cars as well as servicing them.  I noticed last week that
they advertised having 6 Porsches for sale.  This in addition to 
two others for sale in the paper by private owners.  This is a lot
of Porsches to have for sale in Cedar Rapids, IA (pop. 150k) at one
time, so I had to go down and have a look at their stock.  They had
a nice '86 944 for $9500.  This seemed a little high, but not out of 
line for a used car dealer.  They had 3 911s and a '77 930.  They 
wanted $21k for the 930 and knew absolutely nothing about it.  I found
out that I know significantly more about 930s than they do, and I haven't
so much as been inside of one!  The real killer was the 911s.  They
were all mid-70s (75-77) with (supposedly) original engines and no 
records.  The place wanted $12.5k+ for all of them!  I'm scared to 
think of the poor sucker who buys one of these...  When I mentioned 
that the 2.7L engines had some problems, the salesman told me I didn't
know what I was talking about.  I think he figured out that I wasn't really

In our region, there is a distinct difference, besides the cars, between

They (SCCA) are VERY serious about autocrossing and their

I just talked to the owner at Fabcar. He claims this place has no
affiliation with them AT ALL.
FabCar ONLY makes 4130 chrome-moly heat treated arms with larger diameter
ball joints and some killer stainless steel alloy pin for $800- each. Can
you say expensive replacement parts? They just got a failed arm (at the
sway bar mount) off a 95 968 that did $15,000 in damage. Can you say cheap
insurance?
The only IMSA approved arm is FabCar. Hint, hint.

He also said the pin failures might have been from loose/improperly torqued
hub clamps. There was evidence of wear on the pin at the bottom of the
clamp assembly. When was the last time you retorqued yours?

The PMNA arms are apparently the same arm in a different alloy.

Anybody interested in a "bulk buy discount"?

Looks like my for parts for sale list will include control arms, in
addition to adjustible konis and sport sway bars...

Uy.

I have to disagree with this.  The primary reason for downshifting is
to put the car in the proper gear to prepare to get back on the throttle
following turn-in.  I would *never* intentionally try to use the engine
as a means of slowing the car at the end of a straight.  My brakes (which
are basically stock, BTW) don't seem to have *any* trouble slowing the
car down repeatedly from high speeds on the track.  Yes, they have their
limits, but 9 times out of 10, when using proper braking techniques
you will not exceed these limits and the brakes will not fade, etc. 

Another way to look at this is:  Which would you rather wear out quicker -
the brakes or the engine/drivetrain?  Use the brakes to stop the car, that's
what they're for.

  I just added Freon to my '87 951 two weeks ago.  It works just like
  every other car I've ever added Freon to.  Did they lift the car?
  In the later 944s you have to lift the car and remove the engine

Last week the dealer got the new air flow sensor for my car in and
installed.  The service manager called to let me know that it didn't 
have any affect on the problem.  The mechanic told him that this 
meant a bad DME control unit (ugghh!).  They checked out the price
on a used one, and I had them order it for under half what a
"rebuilt" one costs.  The good thing is they aren't charging me
for any of the time or the parts for installing the new air flow
sensor and the DME control unit is 1/2 an hours work to install.
I figure it's probably 4 bolts and a connector:)  I can't decide
whether I hope this fixes the problem or maybe it won't and they'll
find something cheaper to fix it:)

The other good news is that we found a place to live in Roseville,
a suburb of Minneapolis.  I also have had several recommendations 
for a good 944 mechanic in the area.  The nice thing is everyone
has mentioned the same guy so far.  Of course, I'm hoping that
I can fix anything that goes wrong on the car from now on myself,
but it's nice to have good backup.  This list has been very helpful
in giving me some additional peace of mind when moving to a new

Subject: 914 Displacement Increase Inquiries

Hello All,
  I have a '76 2.0 with low miles on rebuild but am not too happy with perform-
ance.  I'm green-minded (and CA resident), so the Smog Pump and CAT must stay,
but I know more power can be had through cubic centimeters.  I've read the
Bosch F.I. Books and they all point to one thing, change the pumping capacity
of the motor.  The question is, how much range does my Bosch-D have built into
it?  I'd like to bump displacement up between 10-20%. I understand that the
Pressure Sensor (which does most of the "driving" in the D-System) is calibrat-
able for different flow/pressure ranges.  Has anyone out there successfully
bumped up the displacement, maintained correct stoicheometry (smog legal), all
with the stock system?
  If the stock system needs mods. what are they?

  Other than under the front bumper, where are some good locations for large
capacity oil coolers?  The Type I's I've rebuilt all relied on oil getting to
the heads through the pushrods...this seems very lame..is the Type IV the same?
My Moto Guzzi (air cooled pushrod 90 degree twin) lubs. the rockers/valves

Subject: 951 control arm - the resolution with PCNA

Hi all,

Thanks to all who answered my questions regarding replacment control arms.  My 
car *had* ;-)  a loose ball joint on the driver side control arm of my 88 951, 
which has less than 36K miles.  

I ended up getting a replacement from the dealer.  PCNA offered to cough up 
1/2 of the cost of the part with me paying the rest.  Although it wasn't any 
great concession on their part, the 2-year warrantee on parts and labor they 
was included  nudged me to go with the dealer.  I had the district service rep 
come out to check the car and *complained* that the ball joint should not have 
come loose on a car that only had 36K miles and is running totally stock.

I also had the camber set a little more negative as suggested by our own Jim 
Pasha.  It's great to have the 951 back!!  Everything feels tighter now and 
the road response seems "improved"  -- it seems like I am getting less "noise" 
in the steering wheel and getting "cleaner" road feel when I expect it.  Is 
this due mostly to the allignment setting or to the new control arm??

The response that I got from you all suggested  that a rebuilt control arm was 
a reasonable way to go (outside of going with an upgrade, e.g. FABCAR)  
Everyone seems to be pretty satisfied.  Both Zim's and European Dynamics (hope 
I have the name correct), which  offer rebuilds, claim that they have not had 
problems with their products and will warrantee their rebuilds for about 2 
years (if I remember correctly).  The rebuilds run around $250 and both shops 
claim that their product is an improvement over the OEM part.  

BTW, I wanted to go with the Euroselect part control arm, which is listed at 
$250, but had no luck in locating any dealer that had access to one.   One 
dealer said that even if the part has a part number and has been priced it 
does not mean that the part will be available any time soon.  Hope this is not 
really true about Euroselect....

Boy do I agree with Mike. Engine braking at it's worst can overrev 
an engine and at it's best is just a lazy way to slow down a car. Think
about it - if you're at redline, or even in the powerband and you down-
shift a gear, you pick up 1,000 RPM right? 

If the brake pedal can't slow the car equally fast, then either the 
brakes are bad or the person should be spending the time in the gym
rather than on the track. I just can't imagine the car dynamics of engine
braking into a turn then transitioning to full throttle at the apex.

This goes for around-town driving as well. If you know you're going to
have to stop (like for a light) don't doodle down through the gears
unless you like buying synchros every couple of years. Just brake
to a stop.

Anyway, engines do not go backwards when you downshift. When you downshift
you get higher rpms and additional "compression braking". Brakes were made
for braking, engines were made to propel. One of the points of "heel and
toeing" is to get the engine speed up so the wheel speed in the new gear
matches the current wheel speed. That way the engine has no effect on
braking or the overall balance of the car before you enter the turn.

Getting your Club Racing Licence:
Basically they now need to know your level of experience. An SCCA or IMSA

chief instructor of your region. I believe you need a minimum of 6 track
events and the recommendation. 
Trust me when I tell you that 6 track events will make you into a moving
chicane at a track event. Please analyze your degree of experience very
carefully before you enter a Club Race. Although it's not SCCA it can get

Would suggest you replace all 4 shocks at once rather than upset the
balance of the car. Face it, if the fronts are bad, so are the backs.

Over the years I've reached the conclusion that for anything other than a
lightly sprung Detroit Land Ark the best solution for new shocks is factory
OEM. Next best thing is aftermarket adjustables. IMHO.  :-)

Last time I looked the going price for OEM Boges (probably what your car
has) was a quite reasonable $60 or $70 each. They're low tech, non-gas,
non-adjustable, etc, etc. They are also HUGE.

Tad,

If your car is prepped to PCA Club Race guidlines, your next step is to
contact Ruth Harte in the PCA National office (703-922-9300) and ask for a
"Club Race icensing packet".  This contains the Club Racing license
application which spells out the requirements.  Fill it out COMPLETELY and
mail it back to her with $30.00, a passport photo, and a copy of your
physical form (filled out of course).  The form will be forwarded to Anita
Moyle, Club Race licensing coordinator, who will determine your license
status. The experience requirements for a "rookie license" are at least 8
days of PCA Drivers Ed AND an endorsement from your regions Chief Driving
Instructor.  If your region does not have one, some recognized authority in
your area who is familiar with your experience and driving ability will
suffice.  Steve Kent from Maverick Region would be a good alternative.  If
you have any questions when filling out the application, call Anita Moyle at
303-794-7256 (after 9 AM MST) or E-mail her at kilner@aol.com.  She will be
happy to help.
Get this done soon as Brainerd is not that far off.  This will be a good
first event for you, as that event is low key.  (Not as many preditors there
as at some events in the East :-).)

I'm a newbie to this list, and absolutely  *love* it.  Discussions like this

I've gotta put my $.02 in.  I'm no expert by any means, but REALLY get into
the subject of performance driving.  I don't have any trophies, nor am I
anywhere near the fastest in the club.  But I tend to agree with this. The
brakes on a Porsche should be more than adequate, if used and maitained
properly, to slow down the car during a typical autocross or time trials run.
 Cool brakes are key, but from what I read and hear using the engine for
compression braking is usually considered an obsolete idea.  Brake technology
nowadays is such that it should be unneccessary in most applications other
than endurance racing, where maximizing brake longevity is key.

Great thread....and thanks for the bandwidth...

A small flat screwdriver (1/8 ") will do. The mirror glass is held on by tabs
on a plastic circular ring which releases the mirror if you rotate it 
counterclockwise with the screwdriver (thru the hole). Poke the screwdriver
in the hole and try to feel for a notch on the ring. When you find it, try to
push the ring CCW by moving the screwdriver tip sideways. When released
the glass can be pulled forward with your fingertips. 
 
If it's the mirror assembly that is rotating loosely on the mirror 'arm'
you're in for
a fun time.  When my mirror 'popped' off it's base, I had to remove the interior
door panels to unscrew the mirror base from the door (at the same time
cutting the control wires). Since the base is tensioned against the mirror 
assembly by a super-firm spring, I had to devise a way to screw the two back
together while compressing the spring. After trying everything, I discovered
that
I could insert a long screw into the hollow mirror arm shaft , and using some
washers and a screw, pull the two pieces together by tightening the screw.
Just make sure that the screw isn't so long that you can't remove it after
you've got the two parts together.

Don't buy a float level gauge. I bought mine from Baum
Tools; it doesn't really fit and it leaks.

All you need to check the float level is a calibrated
light (e.g. wooden) stick. Make a mark on the stick
37 mm from one of the ends. Take off your air cleaners.
Put stick through the brass tube in the middle of the
carb cover. At the correct float level the mark on the
stick is right at the top edge of the brass tube. This
method is *much* easier and faster (and of course less
expensive) than using a float level gauge.

connect the fuel pump to the main power cable under the dash on the left

the fuse panel or must I use the original power source through the electronic
control unit and the relay on the relay board?

It seems easier to connect from the front rather than to run a wire all the way

I use Fram filters in everything of ours when I can get them (many of the 
auto parts stores are far far away from us, and a couple of them rarely 
have anything to sell) I find in the Toyota, they do just fine. My mom 
says it is starting to shake a little, so I'm going to check the radiator 
mounts on it (the car just turned 1, so for some reason she seems to not 
be convinced that the car is just starting to show signs of age). My 
dad's Buick I use Fram stuff, but without going to the Buick garage in 
this area, I have a hard time finding anything for it (air filters I have 
not seen since we moved here a year ago) so when I see the Fram filters, 
I stock up.

Well, there is more racing with automatics now than there was 30 years 
ago, mainly because the automatics are getting better at knowing when you 
want them to shift. Either way, with that said, I've heard that the 
Tiptronics of last year had a problem with shifting how they saw fit if 
you were pushing the car too hard (simply to keep you from blowing the 
motor) while this is a wonderful (sometimes) feature for some drivers, 
this won't do you much good on the track, especially if you're not into 
chipping the car like that (I'm not sure if there are any performance 
chips out there for Tiptronic yet anyway) and have moved the redline up 
say 1000 or 1500 RPM.
Just my few thoughts... On a side note though, there is now talk in 
Porsche engineering of a 'fast' manual transmission. The way it work is 
an H pattern shift, but for a 6 or 7 speed transmission. It puts the gear 
you will want within one shift forward or back. For instance, if you are 
in 3rd, the shift pattern would look like this:
2 1
3-+
4 R <--- The reverse stays put, and first stays put, for stoplights and such.
As you shift to 4th, you push in the clutch, pull the shifter back 
towards you and let go, changing the shift pattern to:
3 1
4-+
5 R
and so on... they are working on this as a solution to the problem that 
the conventional shift design was design for 3 gears and a reverse, or at 
best, 4 forward and an offshoot reverse. With 6 speeds, you're up into a 
triple H when you add in reverse.
Keep in mind though, that the variable speed transmission is getting 
closer and closer to working too... this would be 1000x better, as there 
would only be '1' 'gear'

     No. They are relatively lightweight, and you can easily swap the 
     balljoint and bushings. They are from the VW Rabbit, so go to a VW 
     parts department and save big bucks.
     
     However, I have had some TERRIBLE experiences with them. The SCCA Solo 
     II stock class allows you to exchange the front swaybar. The only 
     adjustable one I know of is the Weltmeister bar from Automotion. It 
     mounts in the normal position on the aluminum a-arms, but you must 
     drill a hole through the middle of the steel a-arms to mount it.
     
     Accident #1: I was autocrossing at Sacramento about 2 1/2 hrs from 
     home. I was going around a 20-25 mph right corner when the a-arm 
     snapped in half, right through the drilled mounting hole. Carroll 
     Smith would say "stress riser". I would say SH*T.
     
     At the time I blamed my lack of mechanical aptitude. Since I was so 
     far from home, I had the car towed to Dwight Mitchell's shop 
     (Autosport Technology). $1200 and one week later, I had 2 new steel 
     a-arms, a four-wheel alignment, and a crumpled left fender.
     
     Accident #2: About one year later, I was autocrossing at Pleasanton 
     about 1/2 hour from home. I was going around a left-hand corner about 
     30-40 mph when the a-arm once again breaks, right through the drilled 
     mounting hole.
     
     Ken Mitchell (ex-GGR PCA member), bless his heart, helped me put my 
     car on his trailer and towed me home.
     
     Now, I had matching crumpled fenders.
     
     If you want to go to another vendor, I understand somebody (Racefab?) 
     makes competition a-arms. This month's Pano has an interesting warning 
     from the factory concerning aluminum a-arms. Porsche is recommending 
     the Club Sport arms for heavy competitive uses. They have a 951 part 
     number instead of a 944 number.
     
     In the Northeast, there are a lot of stories about balljoint failures 
     at speed on cars that have been lowered too much. The July 1 Driver Ed 
     at Watkins Glen won't allow lowered 944s with aluminum arms to run.

   Hi,

   I am looking for some net advice on car bras.  My 928S4 is getting
   numerous rock chips on the nose and front fenders (as well as the side
   mirrors), and since the car is black, they are very obvious.  Also,
   on extended trips the front gets covered with bugs, and frequent cleaning
   is necessary.  My questions are:

   1). Will sand/dirt get trapped under the bra, causing paint abrasion?
       Several co-workers believe this will happen. If so, I would just be
       trading chips for scratches.

   2). Are they lined with cotton or some soft material to protect the paint?

   3). Are the 2-piece models better/worse than the 1-piece?

   4). How well do they behave at high speeds?  I often travel at 100-130 mph,
        and flapping/whistling would be annoying.

   5). Any recommended high-quality manufacturers or styles?

   6). A co-worker mentioned a lexan (?) shroud is available. Any comments?

Subject: Dave's 914 engine: Break-in procedure

 Dave,
 
 I know that list-meister *STAN* has put out a really good description of this 
 (and may have done so again for you -- I'm on the digest version)  But here's 
 is a test of my memory:
 
 1) Like Mike W said, remove coil wire and turn engine over until oil pressure 
 light goes out (make sure oil filter is FILLED before you start this) Do not 
 use synthetic yet, use 30Wt
 
 2) Reinstall coil wire, make sure all hoses and stuff are hooked up right, and 
 start the car.  Immediately bring revs up to 2000-3000 and hold there for an 
 honest-to-god 20 minutes.  Use a watch!  I have done this on a few Type 1 
 engines and trust me it seems like a LONG time!  This helps to break in the cam 
 and lifters, plus get the oil heated up and circulating everywhere.
 
 3) Drain the oil.  Replace filter.  New oil (not synthetic yet).  Start car and 
 take it for your first drive.  Never go beyond 3/4 throttle and never stay 
 cruising at a constant speed/RPM.  Sort of let the engine rev up and then rev 
 down.  Vary your rates of acceleration and deceleration.  This seats the rings 
 properly for various engine demands.  Make this trip about 40-60 minutes.  Do 
 not test out the RPM capacity at this time.
 
 4) Drain the oil.  Replace filter. New oil (nope- still no synthetic!) Let 
 engine cool overnight.  Have a beer and sleep.  Wake up. Brush your teeth.  Set 
 the valves properly.  Now your car is sort of drivable as a car.  Just try to 
 vary engine RPM and don't rev too high.
 
 5) At 300 miles, new oil (Maybe synthetic?) and filter, reset valves.
 
 6) When oil consumption drops (rings have seated) swap over to synthetic and 
 change oil and filters every 3000-5000 and set valves every 6000.
 
 Some of that varies I am sure from the STAN HANKS approved method, so use his 
 if in doubt.

I think the biggest disadvantage a Tiptronic car has is that the Tiptronic
tranny is only a four speed. With only four gears to choose from, as opposed
to six speeds in the manual car, the Tiptronic car is not going to be in the
good part of the powerband as often. Since shifting is really a minor part of
track driving once heel and toe is mastered, the faster (and easier) shifting
of the Tip does not make up for the loss of gears. 

One other disadvantage is the Tip trans is heavier.

Isn't this basically just a sequential gearbox??? A lot of european racecars
use those because of the very fast shifting.

This should cause no hardships on your engine.  It takes the same amount
of work for the engine to red line whether all the power is going to
the rear wheels or some is taken by the AC compressor.  This will
obviously lead to a decrease in power to the wheels and hence will
decrease overall performance.  An intersting point is that in newer
cars at speed, running the AC will probably not hurt perfromance as
much as the aerodynamic hit for having the windows down will.  Of course,
at speed will probably be a triple digit figure, but it should be an
interesting experiment to try... <G>

	Sounds to me like a modification of the old "straight line" 3-speed
shifter...  think it could be done with a modification of the "spring
gate" used on old 911/914's?  I'm thinking have the gate move with the
shifter when you engage a gear... and you'd have to have two different
spring gates, not just one big one... oh well, I should probably get
back to work...

Subject: Steering Column Wobble



The steering shaft in the '72 911T that I am restoring wobbles in 
the steering column.  The problem appears to be lack of support 
for the shaft at the steering wheel end.  The parts manual shows 
a Mounting, 914.347.711.00, which looks like it ought to fit 
snugly around the steering shaft to hold it in place.  When I look 
at mine, the Mounting is there, but it sure isn't snug, and I can't 
easily pry it out to inspect it. The only thing I can think of is that 
part of the Mounting, the part that snugged up against the 
steering shaft, has disintegrated and fallen down the column 
where I can't see it.

Several catalog houses offer a plastic bushing that purports to 
fix the wobble, and indeed the part pictured looks like it will do 
the trick.  However, it is specified for '74 -  '89 911's, not '72's.

Has anyone had this problem with an early 911?  Do I need a 
new 
914.347.711.00?  I suppose I have to remove the entire column to 
fix it.

Thanks for your help.

heavy braking and/or engine braking.

brake pad sets cost around $100 clutches around $800 - you take your pick

my view is brake first, then change gear.

there is no way you can brake, clutch and match the revs on the throttle 
all at the same time.

The safest way is to aim to complete your braking 15 yard before the 
corner, wap it into the correct gear then hit the loud pedal.

Subject: Brakes and Braking.


The current thread about braking should include a little history about
technique.

In the old days, before the Birdcage Maserati, everyone jammed gears
up and down to accerate and deaccelerate because the damn brakes would 
fade after a few miles or laps if the car was driven in a *spirited*
manner. 

Hero drivers would brag about their "heel and toe" technique for mashing
what was left of the brakes and simultaneously the throttle to match 
engine rpms with whatever gear he selected. Most of the time, the hero
driver got it right, when he didn't, the engine or some other component
would barf itself onto the track to show the world the goof.

The Italians figured that it could ba faster to just mash the brakes 
hard, select the correct gear for exiting the corner and be on with it.
This valuable piece of driving style came from no less than one Juan
Manuel Fangio. The secret to his trouncing of Mike Hawthorne at the
Nurburgring was that Senor Fangio dive-bombed the corners and didn't 
bother with selecting the intermediate gears. He figured the brakes 
would and did last. 

Porsches of the era had great brakes and could be driven in this manner, providing you respected the gearbox.

When the Birdcage Maserati appeared, lap times feel as every track it
 appeared at. It was not a particularly fast car, yet it had better 
handling and brakes than it's contempraries. Phil Hill and Roger Penske
recognized this and turned the American racing world upside down with 
this car. Penske: "all you do is set up your line in, mash the brakes 
hard, select the correct gear and stand on the gas. Anyone tailing you 
in another car will lose four or five lengths to you. I wish it had
more power, though."

Porsche had used most of this philosphy for some time, yet the smaller 
displacement engines needed to be worked hard to keep up with the
bigger cars. You learned that minimal braking and concentrating on the 
line and maximum velocity through the corners kept you right on a larger 
Ferrari's tail. You either drove well or finished last. 

When you are learning, concentrate on the line first, exiting the corner 
smoothly next, then the throttle application point and correct gear and 
finally your brake points. I usually have most of the first stuff 
memorized for a given track. I then start working in the brake points 
closer to the apex. Times drop rapidly once you find the deepest point
to suit your style. I very rarely use the engine for braking as it
upsets the balance ofthe car if you aren't careful and don't have the 
rpm matched. 

If you see old movies and watch people spinning as they enter a corner, 
then they have probably locked the rear brakes or selected the wrong 
gear/broken the rear tires loose thereby losing control.

This would be interesting. If say, a gnat were to fly in the side window, 
while the car is going at say 150+ mph it would then splat on the rear

My student at the Glen and I had this very same discussion as I
realized that he was dumping the clutch just before turning in at the
ninety.  I had thought that he was hitting the brakes again, fairly hard,
before turning in.  When he rode with me for the next run, I was able
to show him how to match the revs with heel and toe for smooooooooth 
transition into the corner...

Incidentally, he said, "I do that all the time on the street, but never at
the track..."

He's a good learner, but we'll see how he does at the next event...

The little plastic bushings pop right back out.  What you need is something
that looks sort of like the crush-bushing that holds the gear shift
knob on.  The factory part looks like a steel version of the center
layer of a piece of corrugated cardboard (did that make any sense?).

Wrap it around the shaft, snug it into the bearing, then reef it in.

Yes.  Also, mildew can develop if moisture is allowed to build up under

I went with Colgan Custom.  It's widely available from finer auto detailing
shops; also available from Performance Products.  About $110-150.
Note- the mirror bras are ordered separately.

I like the Colgan bra.  It has cutouts for everything and fits well.  It uses
a few plastic hooks on elastic bands as well as bendable, felt covered, metal 
tabs to secure.  The metal tabs bend over the lip on the fender.  It works, 
but you really have to pull to get a snug fit.  I haven't driven/used the bra 
much, so I'm not sure how well this hold up to frequent installation/removal 
of the bra.

This black brake dust is normal, though a nuisance.  You may want to 
invest in a set of brake covers, I believe they go under the brand-name 
"Clean Wheels." and are about $20 per set.  Other than that, 
frequent wheel cleaning is about all that I can suggest.

Ah, the Birdcage, with its fragile spaghetti-tube frame and (relatively)
massive brakes.  A regular drill after each race was replacing broken frame
tubes, so I suspect any more power would have warped this car into a

screw. Undoing this will allow the entire mirror assembly to come
off the door...however, you still have the electrical wires attached.
I'll try to recite what I did from memory.

1) Using mirror switch, adjust mirror as far UP as possible. This will
   allow you to see the locking ring holding the mirror to it's mount.
   You will see a soft rubber locking ring with small nubs on it. One
   of these nubs, locks in place to keep the ring from rotating due to
   vibration.  Rotate the ring counter-clockwise. Mirror can be removed
   except I believe there are some wires to be disconnected. These wires
   didn't appear to be motor related. I think the mirrors may be heated.
   Anyway, detach these wires...2 I think.  Mirror is now in your hand
   and can be set down somewhere.

2) Now you have to remove the mirror motor mount...3 screws I think.

3) Unplug the wires at the white plastic connector.  Okay, now you should
   have an empty mirror housing with wires and a connector.

4) CAREFULLY remove the wires from the connector and write down where each
   wire came from!!!!  I think there are 5 all together.

5) Swing the mirror base out to expose the screw that holds it to the door
   and undo it. You can now remove the entire mirror mount from the door
   leaving just the wires coming out of the hole in the door.

6) Go inside, get a cold beer. You'll need it

7) Using a star point (dont know what else to call it, its not an allen head
   but looks close) tip on a screwdriver, remove the 2 or 3 screws. Dont
   remember how many but they should be the only screws left to undo.
   This will allow the vertical part of the mount to seperate from the
   part that held the actual mirror.  The vertical part is where that damned
   screw with a spring around it is held. I used an hex head socket that fit
   in the bottom of that damned screw, attached to a screwdriver type driver.
   Drink some beer.  Put the vertical mirror mount on the floor screw side
   up, and using that hex head socket, push down with all your strength plus
   10% and with your free hand rotate the vertical mount until the threads
   catch.  It took me 3 times and a 6-pack before I could get mine in.
   Lots of cussing helps too. Anyhow onces it catches, tighten it.

8) Installation is the reverse of above.

9) Drink rest of case of beer.

This was not a fun procedure. But once you're done, you'll feel like Superman.
I hope this makes sense. I did this from memory plus I'm in a hurry to get my
car in the shop for its new clutch......more beer. *burp*

  OFFICE MEMO         High-end ignition systems             Date:  7/6/95

Greetings P-Philers:
question for the group.
Has anyone had any experience, good or bad, with any of these "high-end"
ignition systems?, (such as Jacobs, MSD, Crane, Hy-Fire, et al).  I was
looking at the Jacobs setup in particular.  The application would be an
already "big-barreled & webbered" '68 912 engine with a bosch dist. on it. 
What I'm after is mega-reliability on the street, more than anything else. 
I'm not looking to build a killer engine-I just want it to run like a Timex...

Are any of these systems acceptable (in a technically legal sense) for
occasional PCA/POC etc. track work? or would I hafta go back to the original
system order to get past tech inspection? 
Does anyone have any ideas? 
All comments, suggestions etc are welcome-please Email me direct-home or
office(see addresses below)
Thanks loads in advance
Cheers-keep the faith

There is a beginning of an option code listing in the 924/944/968 FAQ
available at tta.com either via ftp (/pub/porschephiles/FAQs/944.faq) or
on the WWW page.

If you have more option codes that aren't already included, please send
me them so I can include them in the next FAQ revision (in fact, Barry
Lenoble sent me some today).

The AC is a non-problem, there is no need for removal : simply turn

Hiall,

It's getting close to Vacation, and i see a light in the tunnel. And
no,...it is not another train!

Lotsa work being a part time student, full time engineer, part time
car restorer,.....

I have delivered a couple of film rolls to the photoshop and progress on
the restoration manual at tta.com
(http://www.tta.com/Porschephiles/por356/) will be secured when I get
them back. 

On the restoration side my '58 A model will have to wait until spring '96
to 'taste the tarmac', but it will be shining in Ruby Red color and
brand new everything,...you bet I'll scan pictures of it!

Other 356 projects are postponed until the '58 is finished. But the
'65 NeunElfer is just around the corner, I will have it by the 17 July
and I look forward to letting it taste Norwegian Mountain roads the
very same week.

Help !!!!!
I recently had a daughter buy an old 77- 924 (poor man's Porsche) with low
milelage. Seemed like a good thing to do at the time, but.... I've had
several things go bad and Porsche parts are expensive. My service manual says
that certain VW and Audi parts can be interchanged and the only effect is
price. Anyone have such a list. Should I bail on this car or drive on ?
Thanks, Poor man

        This one is Catalytic Converter, or Catalyst Emissions Control,

a few times, and I remember being amused that it's also the chem symbol
for carbon dioxide, one of the less-harmful emissions...

        Yes you can--that's what "heel and toe" is for!  Left foot for the
clutch, right foot for the brakes, and roll your right foor over (or swing
your heel over) to blip the throttle.

        It's easier, but it is not correct.  The fuel pump / fuel pump relay
is controlled by more than just "switched power".  For instance, when you
turn the key to the "on" position, the pump runs for about 1-2 seconds to
pressurize the fuel system.  I think there are other examples, but the bot-
tom line is that you should go through the hassle and run the lines.
        BTW, it's not that bad to get stuff into the passenger compartment

Subject: RE: Racing a Tiptronic.

I drove a Tip equipped 911 at an autocross a year or so ago. Here is what I
remember.

1- The damn thing upshifts automatically from 1st to 2nd just prior to
redline. You can NOT stop it from happening. It does not do this in any
other gear. Why Porsche engineers decided that it's okay to bump the rev
limiter in a manual but not in the Tip is beyond me.

2- You can not make it downshift in any gear until it determines that
something less than redline will be achieved. (300-400 RPM) While this
seems like a good idea, it means that the shift will likely NOT occur at
the time you request it.

3-It receives its power through a torque converter. Can you say Power Loss?
Okay then say Heat. All right then say Heavy.

4- Although the torque converter compensates somewhat, it's only a four
speed. Not five. Not six.

1) The previous owner removed the stock driver's side rear view mirror on
this 73.5 T and mounted tiny "Carrera Cup" teardrop-style mirrors (secured to
the  corner window frame by drilled holes!).  I'd like to put the original
mirror on.
  a) Is there a nice solution to filling the holes or do I have to replace
the frames?
  b) I have the original mirror.  Anyone have a good idea for a matching
passenger side?  A body shop recommended older BMW mirrors that look very
close to the factory's right side mirror.  Anyone ever heard of this?  What
year & model BMW?
  c) Anyone want to buy these teardrop mirrors?

2) The car has very dark after-market window tint; it's good for the interior
but terrible for spotting authorities.  I've heard removing it from the rear
window will probably damage the defrost wiring.  True?  Alternatives short of
replacing the window?

3) I need two 7x15 Fuchs.  Must be good condition and straight.  Any leads?

BTW, I finally solved the plastic bushing squeak/groan problems: new "street
hardness" Weltmeister bushings on sway bars, drop links, A-bars, and torsion
bars with fashioned grease fittings.  Fun job.  But at last the 911 now
sounds as tight as it drives (new ball joints and Recaros helped a bit too).

Subject: Elect mirrors repost

>Subject: Dual electric mirrors
>To: porschephiles@tta.com
>Date: Mon, 28 Nov 94 12:48:32 PST

In the November 94, PCA Panorama magazine, there is a brief discussion
of C2 mirror installation on page 30.

The text has "The assembly of the mirror base and headpiece is
difficult, sometimes requiring two people to compress a rather
large tension spring and lock bolt"

There may be an easier way.

If the C2 assembly is similar to the later "square" style electic mirrors, 
the lock bolt is a hollow bolt to allow the wiring to reach the mirror motors.

I installed a dual electric mirror kit on my 72T and learned some things
about them.  The dealer supplied kit came with zero documentation and 
required some extra parts.

It became a learning experience. 

If you're curious, read on.

In assembling the mirror base + headpiece I used a 2.5" X 1/4 - 20 bolt + nut
+ washer (a 8mm X 65mm bolt should also work) to draw the tension 
spring + lock bolt into the mirror headpiece threads.

1/4-20 is approximately a 1.25 metric thread pitch.

The 2.5" long bolt head rests inside the hollow lock bolt's head, and the 
mirror + base is assembled with the 1/4-20 nut + washer inside the mirror
housing.

Then the 2.5" bolt is tightened with a socket wrench on the bolt head
and an open end wrench on the nut in the mirror housing to compress the 
mirror spring and draw the hollow bolt into engagement. 

When the lock bolt's threads engage, the tension on the 1/4-20 will
drop because one turn of the 1/4-20 bolt advances the bolt 1.25mm
while the threads on the mirror lock bolt are 1.5mm.  So each turn of
the lock bolt after engagement puts 0.25mm of slack in the thru bolt/nut assy.

After the lock bolt is engaged for a 5 or 6 threads, the 1/4-20 bolt
can be removed and a 12mm star drive (the same as on the 911 flywheel bolts)
is used to do the final tightening.

Another item to keep in mind is the electrical differences between
early/late electric mirrors.

As far as I can determine, the early electric mirrors had one motor to 
position the mirror in both horizontal/vertical axis.  A magnetic clutch
determined which axis was changed.   So the early mirrors saw +/-12 volts 
to the mirror motor and either +12 or 0V to the magnetic clutch depending 
on the axis selected.

Later mirrors (1987+) used separate horizontal/vertical motors.
The motors require independent +/-12 volts for each motor, and will not
work with the earlier mirror wiring. 

To make later mirrors work with earlier wiring, the magnetic clutch
drive lines can activate a 12V SPDT (single pole-double throw relay) added
inside each door.  The SPDT relay will switch +/-12volts to the appropriate
mirror motor under control of the magnetic clutch on/off signal line.
One motor drive wire is common to the other motor's drive wire in this
arrangement.

Gosh, I guess I've been doing it all wrong for 20 years of track driving.
 Thought that was EXACTLY what I do every time I heel and toe/double clutch
on downshifts. Glad someone finally set me straight ;).

If you leave downshifting until you get off of the brakes, you have just had
to brake earlier.  If you jam it into gear without matching revs, when you
let out the clutch the car WILL jerk. I've ridden with too damn many students
who don't match revs, getting my head jerked back and forth. NOT the smooth
way around a course.  I don't use the engine for its braking; that would
imply that I'm not threshold braking and I do. Any engine braking I get is
purely incidental to getting smooth downshifts and smooth transition into
corners.  It is also a LOT easier on the transmission synchros and drive
train in general to match revs. And if you don't heel and toe, how the hell
do you trail brake into a corner where you also have to downshift?  You can't
left foot brake and downshift at the same time the last time I looked, unless
you LEFT foot heel and toe!

Thom:

I'm actually writing the software for a new high-end ignition 
controller manufactured by one of the companies yuo mentioned, so I 
guess I have a little experience...

Here's the straight scoop:  75% of what you hear about these things is 
total hype, 15% only applies to those cars that come with really crappy 
OEM systems, and 5% is useful only to racers looking for any minute 
improvements they can find.  That leaves you with about 5% of the 
claimed advantages that can actually be believed.

The biggest advantage -- and the only one that's basically
undisputed -- of most aftermarket "high-performance" ignitions (to 
those of us with really good factory ignitions, anyway) is that the 
combination of multiple-spark and higher voltage makes for easier 
starting.  That's it.

I could go on and on about the software metrics, the testing, the 
attention to detail, the to-a-fault error-avoidance and -recovery built 
into my software and the hardware on which it runs, but the bottom line 
is that, if you just want "mega-reliability on the street", you're 
probably best served by sticking with your factory Bosch CD ignition.

(Whoops, this was supposed to go out last night, but I'm using a new 
newsreader and entered the wrong address. Oooops. :)

I had quite a night with the 914 tonight - new Mann air filter, new 
tires (Bridgestone Potenza 195/60/15s. Very nice, much better than 
the 195/50/15s I had - MUCH better ride, quieter, easier to turn, and 
they just plain look better! :), ...AND fixing the sticky throttle.

The problem was, as I guessed, in the shaft that the throttle cable 
attaches to. There was another arm that had a spring on it, but it 
was not hooked in with the throttle cable. Turns out it's supposed to 
be, plus it wasn't in the right position at all, and being that it's 
the "other half" of the main spring that's wound around the shaft - 
so not only was the secondary spring not doing its job, the main 
spring wasn't under enough tension! I'm amazed the throttle sticking 
wasn't much worse. Anyways, it wasn't TOO bad to fix, though I 
shoulda taken the engine lid off - it's a royal pain working through 
that little opening. :)

(I did have to dig out the factory service manuals that were lying 
around the dealership for an exploded view of it... Ah, 'twould be

Well, as one of the resident anti-water guys, I'd bet you can guess my
response there....  That however is *YOUR* decision; mine is just to not 
own anything with water in it (unless it's been raining...). 

However, that's not the point. There is a certain amount of interchange
between VW, Audi, and Porsche but there is not that much savings available.
All of those mid-series waterpumpers have expensive fuel injection and
engine electronics, and vastly overpriced trim and interior pieces. As a
result, you'd do better shopping the Porsche aftermarket hard than trying
the VW dealer. In fact, there are VWs that are even more expensive to
maintain than the 924! For sources, there is the Euroselect line of parts 
from Porsche, there are tons of folks in the aftermarket who make their 
living by looking up who made the parts originally and buying direct, etc. 
Take the time to shop carefully, you'll be surprised how much you can save.

*ANY* Porsche is still a Porsche and as such is probably worth having.
Good luck figuring out how to continue to afford to do so.

It is if you have a late 914.... It is *REQUIRED* to pass emissions. As to

While *EVERYTHING* said in this strip-the-hype-away note is true, there
is *ONE* other thing -- if you use a multi-spark system, you can run
very cold plugs without fouling on the street which means you don't necessarily
have to change plugs between tooling around town and taking it to the track.

If this is important to you, you've got worse problems than fouled
plugs...

Two options:

1) if there's still something under the hole (like a temp sensor)
   the get the right boot. Probably from Stoddard. Possible from AA.
   Even less likely from a recycler.

2) if there is nothing behind the hole, go to an aircraft supply place

	So Stan, tell me before I burst here, what happened?  Was there 
no major effect until you made other modifications I assume?  I'm just 
looking for cheap horsepower here, and I've been taught that air flow is 
one of the major limitations to engine performance.  It would seem that 
anything that increases air flow should improve performance, and was 
wondering if there was a reasonably simply way to do this to the 914 
short of turbocharging it.

If you want to do something wierd, your best bet it to find someone
that's done it before and do what they did. If you want to put a Chevy
350 in a 914, there are only a couple of places in the country doing that
so go ask them.

There is no "kit" for flopping the ring and pinion on a 915. It's *TRIVIALLY*
easy to do. What's hard is re-setting the ring lash once you're done. This
is a job for a professional shop that has the tools and the experience. And
while you're in there, it's foolhardy not to replace the bearings and
synchros and seals. So plan on spending close to $2k to get it done right.

I usually sacrifice the floor of the front trunk, and mount a fan blowing

High capacity oil pump is a MUST. Also add a Canton/Meca canister oil

That's *NOT* a bad idea. However, it's better to run the engine in at
about 2-3000 RPM for at least half an hour, let it set overnight, do
the oil change/valve adjust thing, *THEN* run it hard for about 100-200 
miles through a variety of engine speeds, repeat the oil change thing.
Etc.

That bit of wisdom comes from the days when people put smallish two-barrel
carbs on 400 CID engines. The 914 2.0 has *VERY* good air flow. What it
doesn't have is high-rev capability. You gotta do many, many things before
you get to the point that the 2.0 can't breath well enough at the max
RPM you can run it at...

It's a *PORSCHE* -- there's no such thing as cheap horsepower!!!

More likely it's a sign that you're burning oil through the exhaust.  Or,
possibly, leaking exhaust gas somewhere in front of the tailpipe.

The only place you're likely to notice brake dust is on the wheels..and then
mostly on the front ones.

Earlier, I wrote:

Then I went back to debugging the rev-limit code in the 
ignition-controller software I'm writing, and realized that there 
actually are other advantages, although they have little to do with the 
"high-performance" claims:

    1.  Most microcontroller-based aftermarket ignitions include a
        rev-limiter, usually programmable to +/- 10 RPM.

    2.  Many even have TWO rev-limits... Very useful for those twitchy,
        steely-eyed types who are into bracket-racing.

    3.  Most "street" systems have some sort of anti-theft protection
        built in.

    4.  Some can be equipped with a knock sensor to retard timing on a
        cylinder-by-cylinder basis.

    5.  Most have extensive internal diagnostics to keep them from
        melting down if there IS a problem.

    6.  Some have programmable timing curves.

    7.  Some can even have their timing curves controlled by external
        inputs, e.g., they know when the nitrous has been turned on,
        and adjust the timing accordingly.

Each of these features can be implemented through additional hardware 
bolted to your existing factory ignition, of course, but there's a lot 
to be said for being able to buy one box that gives you everything.

Subject: Front End Maintenance Questions

Pfellow Pfiles:

        I am in the process of rebuilding the front end of my '84 Carrera.
As I rather expected,
this has turned into one of those "while I'm in there" exercises.  To date,
I have decided to:

1)      magnaflux the struts (bad curb!)
2)      rebuild the calipers
3)      replace the brake pads
4)      have the rotors turned
5)      replace the rubber brake lines
6)      replace the alloy brake line I twisted off
7)      replace the strut inserts
8)      reinstall the brake pad sensors the PO left off
9)      repack the front wheel bearings

        The question is, should I replace the ball joints?  The car has 95K
miles.  I haven't
noticed anything out of the ordinary, but they are 11 years old and, "while
I'm in there"...
Is there anything I'm forgetting?

        Finally, what brand of grease is best for re-packing the bearings?

I had a Colgan on my 928S for 7 years. I only used it for long trips
(3hrs+) and for bug-ridden areas. It fit beautifully, and stood up to a lot
of wear and tear. Two major problems, though: as it aged thru usage, the
Velcro surrounding the headlight cover flaps wore down, so that at speeds
above 100mph the flaps would come loose and fly backwards, beating
themselves against the hood. This never did any damage, but it was really
annoying, esp.at 100+! The second was almost identical to the first: the
elastic holders that hold back the rolled-up headlight flaps also stretched
so that they became useless, and allowed the flap again to fly backwards at
normal highway speeds. They might have changed the design by now, but
realistically, just buy a new bra after the 5 years it took to get to this
state.

    Too bad for those of us with 914-6 conversions that the sixes don't
    look much like the fours...

    In fact, the only way I know to do a California smog-legal 914-6
    conversion with Weber carbs is to start with a 1973 or older 914
    and drop in an engine that (at least externally) was from a
    1969-1973 mechanically-injected 911.  The converted car will only
    have to meet 1973 smog requirements (charcoal canister, crankcase
    breather, etc... Minor things), and PMO has a CARB Exemption Order
    covering the replacement of 69-73 mechanical injection with Webers.

I'm not sure when they close down for the Summer break.  Typically,

Subject:      FIRST TIME QUESTION

I've been following Porschephille for about a month or so and have found some
comments very informative.  Some members (George Beuselink,  Larry Dunlop and
Jay Karoly to name a few have) have been personnaly helpful in addressing some
work I have had to attempt on my 78 924 (wish there were more of us out there).
So a big thank to them for their help, and now I'd like to attempt to reach a
"broader" universe.

I recently had to have my exhaust system put back together after it encountered
another one of Vermont's road "ripples" (in the winter they are called frost
heaves) on US 15.  At first I thought it was the cataylic converter that was go
ne, but it seems it really was the resonator in an aftermarket product.  The
muffler and converter are fine so in the interest of time (I had already waited
for 4 weeks for an ordered converter to be delivered) my local garage cut out
the remanants and welded in a piece of straight exhaust pipe.  Great! that got
the car through inspection AND significantly strengthened/stabilized the
exhaust system!

Now to the problem, the system now vibrates a great deal until about 4000 rpm
(or 75 mph) which is only possible on the few interstates we have in Vermont.
My question is did the resonator perform a "smoothing out" function using the
appropriate laws of physics regarding sound waves?  If so, I will have to repla
ce it because the sound level in the car is VERY uncomfortable at 35 or 40 (and
I don't just want to turn up the radio!).  Or is that in the repair process the
exhaust pipe was shortened too much?  What do you think?

Also, does anyone know of a good source for a used (but functioning) Speedomete
r/Odometer.  I have attempted the proposed fix from Larry, Jay and George to no
avail.  So I guess it is the replacement option for me now?

Thanks, and I look forward to more Porshcephiles.

Stan,

In your comments about 914 performance:

>It's a *PORSCHE* -- there's no such thing as cheap horsepower!!!

Okay, but what about the headers listed in EuroProducts' Excellence ad?
Are they expensive, or, provide no real benefit?

This not meant as a flame, but as a lead in to that question.

I'm doing the head gasket on my '84 928S, and while I'm there if
I could get the 31 hp the ad alludes to for $549 I might consider it.

How about others?  I haven't seen any ads, so does anyone know of
other header manufacturers for my 928?  How about price?  How about
performance?

31 hp is significant to me, but I don't think anything under 15 hp
would be too noticeable on the street.

Considering that the 959 is highly unwelcome in America, he probably 
won't be at a great loss. I know Stan well enough to know that he don't

It is unfortunate that only 3 959's made it to America, but it is funny,

Tom,

Just a thought. I am definitely not an expert and definitely not Porsche

>Now to the problem, the system now vibrates a great deal until about 4000 rpm
>(or 75 mph) which is only possible on the few interstates we have in Vermont.

As a mechanical engineer I know a bit about resonating systems.  Any system
of mechanical components subject to an input vibration frequency vibrates.
What most designers are *supposed* to do is either provide sufficient
damping to reduce vibration or tune the system to such a high resonating
frequency, that nothing on the vehicle can (technical term) excite it.
Vibrating mechanical systems have mass, springiness, and damping.  Changing
any one of the three will have an effect on the resonating frequency or
behavior of the system.

A story: A friend of mine flies Learjets.  When his company acquired a
particular new one, the front landing gear vibrated ferociously on landing.
Lear was contacted and sent an engineer to attach a vibration sensing
package with telemetry to the front gear.  The idea was to measure the
vibration and do appropriate tuning.  With the sensor attached the vibration
ceased.  The added mass of the sensor moved or tuned the mechanical system
to a frequency different than whatever inputs it received from the brakes,
tarmac, etc.  The fix was the addition of a small lead (Pb) weight to the gear.

Not a high tech solution huh?

As a said, I am not an expert, but you could

A) Add additional damping (Mushy high dampening mounts)

B) Stiffen the system supports or the exhaust tubing

C) Play with adding small amounts of weight

D) Any of the above

However, if your talking about resonance due solely due to your detuning of
the sound waves inherent to the exhaust system:  Nevermind (Small attempt at
humor.)  No really, sound resonance is a function of baffling (dampening),
tuned columns of air (springiness), and air viscosity/density (mass.)

IMHO

I have *NO* idea. My idea of improving performance of a 928 is trading it
for a 911... Note meant to be a flame, but that's just where I'm coming
from. I've done ZERO performance work on 928s, and not too much other
work except endless fixing of electrical problems...

Well, I'll venture an observation: the newer a Porsche is, the less effect
any given "minor" modification is likely to have. Not to mention the
fact that there is likely to be less "free space" in which to insert
said modification....

All of the Colin Cambell books on the various engineering aspects of

The Bosch Automotive Handbook to make sure you have the right formulas.

"Rebuild Your Aircooled VW Engine" from HP Books. Best source of info
for a first time low-grade 914 engine rebuild.

There are no specific books on 914 performance although I know of two
being written. You can get some good base info that you then have to
integrate appropriately from "How to Hotrod the VW Beetle" (so old
that dual port heads are a novel idea) and "The 356 Performance Handbook".

Subject: Re: Hidden radar detectors


Bart asked about the size of the antenna on my radar detector:

The antenna is approximately 3 x 1.5 x 2 inchs, however, it has a flange 
at the rear that makes it more like 2 x 2.5 on one end.  I doubt that it 
would fit into the mirror or the third light.  The system also comes with 
a remote laser sensor that is much smaller, about .5 x 3/4 x 1.5 inches 
that might fit into the mirror or the third brake light.  I havn't 
decided on a solution to the laser sensor yet.

Also, I mounted the display with magnets just below the ash tray.  My 
plan is to depress the ash tray if stopped, thus obscurring the display 
and only appearing to be a Porsche trasher of unredeemably bad taste by 
having mounted a largish LCD clock on my dash.  I checked with BeL and 
they claimed that the magnets glued to the display panel will not 
interfere with its operation.

I'm rather pleased with the setup so far, but I wish I was cool enought 
to have connected the LCD clock read out to a temp or pressure sensor on 
the enging and thus get digital readouts.  As for the BeL 615STi, I 
suppose it is pretty good.  It's the first radar detector I've had and is 
irritatingly sensitive to other radar detectors, but I can't say whether 
its worse or better than other radar detectors.

Good luck,

Subject: 1986 944 Front Shocks and Suspension


After the last auto-x I've noticed the following:

1. There is fluid in right front  suspension area of my 86 944.
2. The car has developed a slight steering wheel vibration at around 65 MPH.
3.  Front tires exhibit a non-uniform, "cup" shaped wear pattern accross
the thread surface.

My assumption is that the front shock is shot and causing the leak as well
as contributing to the steering vibration.  Tire pressure and tire balance,
or lack thereof, are also contributing to the steering vibration and the
ugly tire wear pattern.

I plan to do the following:

1. Procure and install new set of shocks on the four corners.
2. Balance the tires (I may even get new tires).
3. Have an alignment done.

I do have some questions regarding the front shock replacement. Per the
option set for my car, it does not have the "474" Koni shocks/struts. Thus,
it should be equipped with the standard Sachs struts. According to the
local Porsche dealer, the Sachs units do not have a replaceable cartridge
and the whole strut assembly must be replaced. I most certainly do not want
to display a lack of trust on the dealer, but is this a fact? If this is
so, then I might as well buy an option 474 kit. If the Sachs unit does have
a replaceable cartridge, would a Boge cartridge work?

The 474 kit comes with 250 lbs front springs. However, if the front springs
are replaced, would I have to replace the rear torsion bars to match? I
hear they are a bear to replace!

Thanks,

Welp I just got my second speeding ticket in four months.  The first one was
75 in a 65 (I think I only got it because I was in a Porsche).  It cost me
$54.  I got another one last night for 74 in a 55 (they got me with a
laser).  It's gonna be $100.  The tickets don't really bother me that
much...they're just a hassle I'd rather avoid.  I even set up a separate
category on my computer finance program called "Auto:Speeding Ticket."
However I'd rather not lose my license.  Plus if I'm gonna be dropping money
here and there I'd rather spend it on a radar/laser dectector.  I'm sure
this topic has been discussed a million times on here and is probably the
subject of debate but does anyone have any opinions on what is the *best*
detector?  I have ads here from Road & Track for a couple or three different
ones.  One is an Escort Solo 4 which is a cordless one.  The cordless idea
appeals to me.  It's $200.  There's also another Escort in here called the
Passport 5000 which has an LCD display.  Sounds sorta interesting but I
don't know how often I want to look at the display and try to decipher some
little tiny picture.  That one is $170.  Then there's one from a company
called "Valentine One" that is supposedly the best of the best (according to
the ad) that costs $400.  It's got arrows on it to show where the signal is
coming from and the case is metal (I like that...radar dectectors always
seem so cheaply made).  Anyway, does anyone have any opinions on these or
others?  I'd just like to buy the absolute best one and get it over with.

Subject: 924 wont start and 914 Drag


For fred Hess:

The 76-77 924 had an accumlator in line with the fuel filter but 
between the fuel pump and the fuel distributor at  the front of the car.
The purpose of the accumulator is to hold the system pressure after the 
engine has been turned off.

You may be having a problem with the AUX air bypass valve or the cold
start regulator at the back of the manifold (it has a fuel line going 
in and out of it). To check, find a pressure gauge for the Bosch system,
install it at the fuel distributor. Run the engine, check the delivery 
pressure, turn off the engine. Watch to see if the pressure bleeds off 
to under 25 pounds within 5 minutes. If it does, change the accumulator.
If it doesn't, then check the AUX air valve and cold start regulator.


For you 914 people.

Somewhere, this is from memory, probably Panorama, there were figures
printed about the Cd for the 914. It was expressed thusly:

	Cd = .34 for a 914 with all windows up and the targa roof on.
	Cd = .39 for a 914 with all windows down and the targa roof on
	Cd = .45 for a 914 with all windows down and the targa roof off
	Cd = .43 for a 914 with all windows up and targa roof off

This included driver's side rearview mirror and North American ride 
height (nose high). It could be a little better with the car set level.

I've owned a few 914/6s, they are quite stable at high speeds (140+)
if the car is set level (not nose low or nose high, both modes increase
drag and make the car unstable, nose high disturbs the air flow to the 
engine). The enlarged 914/6 GT engine cover opening is a desireable 
modification, even for the street. I kept two covers, one for concours
and one for real driving.

Hey .. thats a sound I recently made :-)

part for $198 new (which I ordered), and PAR-Porsche had several used

replaced the earlier utterance.

I still need to find a replacement mirror for the driver side, but
everything I have seen so far looks like $90-100 ... its just a piece
of glass! Still hunting.

I've been thinking lately...wouldn't it be nice to have a hard top for the
911 Targas...something that could be painted the same color as the body and
that could be a little more permanent in the winter or during storms, etc.
Has anyone ever made an aftermarket hard top or would there even be any
interest in one?  Personally I think it would be nice to have a hard one
plus the regular fold-up one as well.

    What about something similar to a 914 top?  If anyone wants to lend
me a 911 targa for the rest of the summer I'll gladly start working on a

 P-Philes,
 
 I have a large order or 914 engine, exhaust and suspension parts that I need to 
 purchase.  I sent in a fax to German Parts and Restorations and the total came 
 out to over $2800!  Since I have such a large chunk of money to give to 
 someone, I figure that I should price comparison shop and see how much vendors 
 want my money.  I love GPR and hate to play one vendor off against another but 
 my job doesn't pay THAT well....
 
 Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions as to who may be able to play in this 
 game?  I figure Twinks, Performance Prod and Automashin' are out because they 
 are really expensive already.  I figured I'd give Mr. 914, PhD's place a call.  
 One of my biggest problems is that I am in the People's Republic of CA, as is 
 GPR, which means that I would have to pay about $200 in state sales tax if I 
 order from them (unless some kind soul would let me ship them to their house 
 and then ship them back to me....  =8~)  just kidding... sort-of)
 
 Any suggestions or ideas to get my cost down would be appreciated.

Hello all,

I'm almost ready to begin work on prepping my 911SC for painting.  
I've read all the great detailed suggestions on painting that have co 
across on this list.  I think my question is a little different 
though.

The paint work is not too bad.  There a one or two minor rust spots 
which I can take care of.  The main problem is what to do about the 
stone chips which are extensive.  I don't want to sand them down 
'cuase that may mean I sand through the primer and the zinc coating.  
I was thinking of going over each paint chip individually with a 
paint brush and then sanding the 'bumps' level with the rset of the 
paint.  


What should I do?  I don't think I can afford a complete paint strip.

Subject: Wisdom on 2nd car

I am seeking the nets wisdom on a future car purchase.  I am thinking of 
selling off my very trusty 1987 Toy Tercel 4wd wagon.  It was rear-ended 
a few years ago with my wife driving it, resulting in a partially crushed 
back end and a slightly sprung drivers seat.  I was fortunate though, the 
offending party's insurance company totaled it and paid me approx. 
$800.00 more than I had in it, which I pocketed.  It still runs fine, 
although the rear drivers side door doesn't open and close very well and 
neither does the rear hatch.  The problem is my wife won't drive the car 
anymore because  of the accident (gun shy) and the appearance of the car 
with the accident damage.  I basically have driven the car about 30000 
miles (3 yrs) for free and selling it should get me an additional $1500 - 
$2000.

I am considering two choices right now.  1.  85-87 VW Cabriolet   2.  
85-88 Saab 900 Sedan.  (choices listed in order of preference)

I really don't want to spend more that $5500 total.  The car must have 
the capacity to carry 4 adults in relative comfort.

Any comments or suggestions appreciated.

I realize this isn't Porsche related, but I have seen similar threads 
before.  Besides, who else to offer advice and transportation than a 
Porsche person.

Thanks

Keith,

I come from a P-car/SAAB family.  'Course we used to be a VW family, but all 
that's left of the campers, busses, bugs, and rabbits is the GTI my sister runs 
(into the ground).

My '85 900 3-door was bought in '90 with 79k miles on it.  Since then, it has 
moved my wife and me from Ithaca, NY, to Dallas, to Ann Arbor, to DC, and back 
to Ann Arbor.  Coupled with all the camping trips and holiday trips home etc., 
I have just reached 165k.  No troubles whatsoever.  And I mean it.  Regular 
services and that's it.  New rotors and pads a year ago, steel rims are no 
longer round so needs new ones, one exhaust system replacement, new belts, one 
wheel bearing, but nary a major failure.  Getting to where it could use new 
shocks.

If you really mean 4 adults and luggage, forget the V-dub.  We regularly stuff 
2 golden retrievers, 3-4 people, and light baggage in the car for pretty long 
trips (6 hrs) and everyone's happy, including the guy who pays the bills.

>From what I can tell from my close involvement with 5 or 6 900s (turbos 
included), and a couple 9000s, if you get a good one, you'll know it and it'll 
run forever.  If you get a bad one, you'll also know it PDQ; get rid of it and 
try again.  BTW, 900s don't "loosen up" like VWs seem to.  Compared to a '90 
Jetta my pal got when I got my 900, my car is tight as hell, no squeaks.  
Clutch on that Jetta feels like a toggle switch and everything's coming apart 
like Detroit metal after 50k.

When I was growing up as a teenager, I had an entire wall of my room
covered with car advertisements -- mostly Porsche.  Now at age 34,
when I return to my parents house and stay in my room, those
advertisements are still there!  It is really cool to read an
advertisement for the 1974 Carrera or the first 1976 911 Turbo and to
see all those 911s and 914s splayed out in their garish '70s colors.

Sign me up -- I'll buy one.

P.S. My personal idea for a book is to re-release the book "The Unfair
Advantage" by Mark Donohue.  I really want a copy, but I'm unwilling
to spend ~ $250 (the going rate) for a tattered old book.  I'd love it
if someone reprinted it and re-released a few thousand copies.

Even better, I'd love if someone took it, added many more photographs
and a few chapters about Donohue's life after the book was written
before his death, and sold it for $50-100.  Does anyone know who has
the rights to this book?

I could imagine Roger Penske being a good person to write those extra
chapters.

  Shipped June 28
  Arrive North Carolina July 12
  Get to the dealer/prep/etc (in Chicago) 7-10 days thereafter.

Subject: Re: 911 window tint removal

          When I bought my 1979 Targa, it had the drug dealer look.
          Extra dark window tint and black metallic paint with extra
          metallic.  I couldn't do much about the paint, but I decided
          to remove the tint.

          The easy part is getting the film off. Just start in a
          corner where there is an edge and peel it off.  It should
          come off the rear window too, without damage to the
          defroster.  The hard part is now to remove all the adhesive
          that got left on your windows.

          I used acetone, lots of paper towels, and a razor blade.
          First wet a paper towel with the acetone and scrub the
          adhesive.  It should smudge, but not easily come off.
          However, it's now softer and less sticky, and can be scraped
          off with the razor blade.  Repeat.  You can only do small
          areas at a time.  The paper towel will get covered with glue
          too, so you have to change that often.  Be careful not to
          use so much solvent that it runs down the window, as it will
          eat rubber, vinyl, and who knows what it will do to leather.

          You can't use the razor blade on the defroster.  Just use
          more paper towels, scrub harder, and carefully remove small
          areas of adhesive.  It will eventually all come off.

          Acetone is relatively harmless, but it is flammable.  Use
          plenty of ventilation, and be careful with the discarded
          paper towels.  You might want to wear a respirator with
          organic cartridges when doing the rear window.  Even with my
          roof off, I found I was getting light-headed from the fumes,
          and I had to stop and get some fresh air.  Plan on taking 3
          to 4 hours to strip all windows.

          Now if I could get some of that metallic out of my paint...

You said:

>What is "oil cooler conversion for fitting a 3.2 to a 914/6" ?
I don't know what you are quoting from, but all 914/6's had an engine mounted
oil cooler with a right angle bend in the intake pipe on the bottom with a
screw on hose fitting.  This was to clear the rear suspension and mounts. Any
engine that big (in fact any 6 over about 2.2 driven even on the street) will
require more oil cooling than the engine mounted cooler can provide. Most
mount the cooler in the front like the 914/6 GT's.  You also need to add
grill area to the engine lid to get more air to the engine.

} recommendation plus a little more information on this particular model...
}
}   1984 944 "Weissach Edition"
}
} Does anyone know what the details of this special edition were?  From

} wheels, wider than standard at rear, 911 seats inside.  Anyone have more
} info?

All 944's have 911 seats. If it has the "wide wing" sports seat, then that is
a plus. Also if the wheels are Fuchs (rounded spokes instead of the very
angular "cookie cutter" ATS wheels), then that is a really valuable addition.
A set of good-condition Fuchs wheels can run a kilobuck by themselves.

} Also, the car's sunroof has MAJOR paint damage -- probably a function of
} being fiberglass instead of steel, plus some heavy-duty stone chips up
} front, but has a full main-dealer service history.  Should I overlook the
} cosmetics in favor of this well-looked-after powertrain?  BTW, the guy's
} asking $5000 for the car.

Hmmm, the sunroof on my '84 is aluminum. I thought it was steel, but the
magnetic base of my antenna didn't stick...

Stone chips are pretty normal for these cars and are nowhere as
expensive to fix as mechanical neglect. If the car has been well
cared for (get an independent P-car mechanic to go over it
for you), then it is well worth $5K.

Subject: Re:       how to prepare for painting

I understand the problem, but would maybe caution you against the idea of 
using a coat of paint as a filler. Issue which comes to my mind is adhesion 
both to the surface under the paint you were thinking of adding and the paint 
which your paint shop will cover it with. If the paint you brush on is not 
sticking well, then you might end up with a bubble underneath your great new 
coat of paint.

Given that you don't want to get out a sanding board and some reasonably 
coarse sand paper (say p200) and just hand sand it close to the metal and then 
let the paint shop make it beautiful (my far and away number one suggestion) I 
would do the following.

1. Wash car with soap and water, and a good scrub with something reasonably 
gentle

2. Use a good degreaser (I use Sikkens M600, but that's only 'cause I am using 
Sikkens paint) and give it a really good wipe over with some clean rags. Maybe 
even use a soft toothbrush on each pit to get at all the edges. (Don't forget 
to buy the wife a new one if you use hers, as when you go through the process 
of rubbing tongues and exchanging spit later it tastes funny otherwise...)

3. Do step 2 again

4. Do step 3 again

5. If you have chips down to the metal, you need to use phosphoric acid type 
stuff (Rustoleum or similar) to ensure the rust is gone, then you need to 
prime with suitable primer. Remember galvanized metal needs to have a 
compatible primer, plus you need to be compatible with your paint...

6. Assuming no chips to metal, I would use a urethane compatible filler 
(really a heavy primer) such as Sikken's Kombi and spatula over each chip 
(probably leave the wife's stuff alone at this point...)

7. Let the paint shop do the rest....

Subject: 944 Waterpump questions

About 1000 km ago, I replaced all the timing & balance belts and rollers 
on my '86 944 (using the P9201). The car is now at 85,000 km (53K mi)
and I've noticed recently a faint squeaking coming from the waterpump
area which I only hear when the car is warm. There is no fluid leaking
at the waterpump pulley. I checked the tension of the AC/Alternator belt
in case it was making the noise. A momentary squeak can also be 
induced by letting off the gas quickly and listening as the engine rev's
back up to idle. 

Is squeaking ok so long as the pump doesn't leak? Could the new 
tighter timing belt (4.0 on P9201) have stressed the old pump bearings? 

After reading the 944 FAQ, Factory manuals, Jim Pasha's articles, and
George's DIY waterpump instructions I still have some questions:
 
1. Buy new or rebuilt?

2. Where is the best to buy from (in terms of price)

3. What is the likelihood of breaking off a waterpump bolt at removal.

4. The crankshaft pulley bolt is torqued to 154 ftlbs. Is it at all possible
   to remove it by first blocking the wheels, setting the handbrake, and
  putting the car into gear to lock the crank? Will this be too stressful 
  on the driveshaft , gearbox, clutch etc?

5. If 4. is not possible, where is the best price on a 944 flywheel lock?
   (Perf Parts has one for $46!) The balance sprocket holder I will try
   to weld unless anyone knows where to buy for less than $40!
 
6. I understand the crankshaft pulley needs a puller to be removed.
   Is there enough room to use the puller without taking out the rad?

7. What is the typical lifetime for an 85.5+ 944 waterpump.  85K km
   seems premature.

Subject: Funny Sounds From My 911

I hope someone out there can give me some insight into a problem Iam having.
 My car is an 85 Carrera coupe with 60k on the clock.
I have owned the car for just over 6 months. 
Just after the car is started ( about 30 seconds) I can hear what sounds like
the oil circulating maybe with air mixed in. The noise subsides after the oil
temp starts to come up. If it is warm out (>90) I don't hear any noise on
startup. Restarts after the car is warmed up seem quiet as well.  Iam not
100% certain but I beleive this started after the oil was changed. I replaced
the 10w40 from the PO with 20/50. I also used a Fram filter???. I have seen
the bad wire on Frams and today bought a OEM filter from the dealer ($9.65) I
plan to replace the filter this weekend when the valves get adjusted. The
only thing I can come up with is the chance that the thicker oil (&Fram
filter) on cold starts builds pressure to the point that the by-pass relief
valve at the filter base dumps oil back into the tank. The filter is in the
upper portion of the tank and the oil could make some noise as it flows into
the tank. Any thoughts or suggestions?

Fred,

Check the fuel accumulator also.  This thing has a diaphragm in it to
maintain fuel pressure to help with hot starts.  When the diaphragm
ruptures, the fuel pressure leaks down and presto! - hot starting
problems.

On the accumulators that have a fitting on the bottom, you may be able
to remove this fitting and see if any fuel leaks out.  If it does, I think 
it is safe to say the diaphragm is shot.  These are cheap and easy to 
replace also.

Really?  From what I understand, *all* '74-'77 Carreras had

the '74 and '76 cars that you mention above
were Carreras?  How did you determine that?  By VINs?

Subject: Paintless Dent Removal

I've seen this technique demonstrated.  It works by using pointed
steel rods angled 90 degrees near the tip.  Some tips are plastic
covered, some are not.  The bodyman must have access to the
backside of the dent.  (we're assuming "inzees", not "outzees")
The rod is placed behind the ding and manipulated to move the
sheetmetal back out, approximating the original surface.  

This method works best on shallow smooth dents that haven't
work hardened the metal.  It also helps if the paint has some
orange peel in it, like your average Detroit factory job.  Smooth
and shiny cars like ours take *alot* more skill to get right.

Done correctly, it's worth the money if you're between paint
jobs.  Being of the old school, I'm firmly grounded in the 
"beat and grind" method.  Real bodymen use DA's and paintguns.

Hello folks,

I hate to say it but the day has finally come.  My bank just gave me a call 
and let me know that the buyer of my 944 Turbo S had just sent the money and 
the title was on its way back to him.  The car is now officially sold. :-(  I 
had been getting a feeling of foreboding emptiness while the transaction was 
underway but I never realized how hard it would hit until I got word that that 
the car was no longer mine.  I'm sure some of you know it, it's an increadably 
mixed feeling of relief and sadness; kinda like breaking up with a long time 
girlfriend.  I'm glad the car is sold because I can now get the family wagon 
we need but I'm very sad that it had to go.  Oh well, like I mentioned before, 
I've got another little Porschephile coming who will more than fill any void 
the car left by many orders of magnitude!  :-)  

I would like to take this opportunity to let y'all know what a great group of 
people you are and that the collective wisdom displayed here is an invaluable 
resource to keeping the cost of ownership of our favorite marque within reach 
of the common man.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the excellent commentary you 
all offered and especially liked the many different stories many of you told.  
I will highly highly highly recommend this list to anyone who owns a Porsche 
and has an Internet connection.  

So it is with some sadness but no regret that I must say good bye for now.  
I'm going to unsubcribe from the list for a while so as to make brain space to 
concentrate on other things.  I know that I will be back, though.  This 944 
Turbo S was my last. (I've had three others)  When I return it will probably 
be in a 911 but that won't be for some time.  I want to wish y'all good luck 
and keep at least two tires on the ground at all times.

Best personal regards,

Holy cow! I find this very hard to believe, as these shouldn't last more than
ten years. If the engine is in good shape and you don't want to rebuild it,
I would not drive it more than a few miles with ancient tensioners.

But it made it this far, so it would probably be OK at low speeds.
I would not want to take this chance - if you slip the chain it
will cost about twice what you paid for the entire car to get the engine
rebuilt!!! (or it will become a parts cart - a damn shame of a fate for a
real S!).

Subject: 944S2 down on power - Problem Resolved!

Remember this?  We've been working on it for over a month.  This was
a real tough problem to troubleshoot because the car ran pretty good
on the street.

We took the car to dealer A the week after the Glen.  This was with
three days left on the one-year warranty.  We asked them to do a 15K
service and fix the problem.  They charged us $56 for diagnosis time
and couldn't find anything really wrong with the car.  They gave us
two cans of fuel-injector cleaner and sent us on our way.

I ran several cans of cleaner through the system and changed the
fuel filter yet again at the tech session before Summitt Point.
But to no avail...the car was even worse at SP last week.  It was
a struggle to get above 95MPH on the front straight.  :(  On the 
bright side, this was a good way to learn to keep my foot planted
from Wagon's Bend through the Chute (turn 4)... I actually caught
a lot of faster cars that way.  :)

So we took the car to Dealer B (Holbert's) this week and explained 
the problem.  Everyone was betting on a clogged cat and maybe a 
bad O2 sensor or DME.  It turned out to be a broken muffler!  An 
internal baffle had collasped.  As the car got hotter, the baffle
became a worse and worse restriction.  That explains why it didn't
drive too poorly on the street.  I think changing the fuel filter
at the Glen improved things because the car got a chance to cool 
while I was changing the filter...  The mechanic found the 
problem by banging on the exhaut system with a rubber mallet after
a back-pressure test confirmed a great deal of pressure in the 
system.

Can you believe that a new muffler for an S2 is $700USD!  And there
is no such thing as an aftermarket replacement.  Oh, the muffler
isn't covered under the one-year or the emissions warranty.  :(
However, my wife can be pretty pursuasive over the telephone.  Ask
any Riesentoter member... She complained that a muffler with 15K 
miles on it shouldn't just break.  That (and maybe the promise of 
some home-baked cookies :-) got the dealer to agree to replace the 
muffler at no cost for the part if we agreed to pay for the labor 
(1.5hours).  We very quickly agreed to the deal and now the car is 
as good as new!

Oleg,

John Starkey's book, "911, R to RSR", indicates 4 prototype R's were built on
chassis# 307670, 307761, 305876, 306681 (BTW, you can see from these numbers
that they were built from 1967 cars). Also, a series of "production" R's were
built, #'s 11899001 thru 11899019 (that's 19 cars, and looking at the serial
number format, you can tell that ALL of these cars were built on 1968
chassis, even though the cars were built in the fall of 1967!).

I hope you have found a real 911R!

Hi,
 unfortunetly there is only one right way,although there is half ass ways
around most every thing.I wish I could tell you what you want to hear but
,the best things in life are not simple.A magic wand would be the best
solution ,but until they are for sale, the correct way is to sand out the
 road chips.one of the possible problems you could run into with dabbing the
chips is when it's time to do the complete paint job the solvents in the
paint cold penetrate the chip ereas and create solvent popping or chemical
reactions,pinhole effect or what is known as fish eyes from contaminents
trapped in the chips,waxes,oils,etc., and put you back where you are now only
to find you have a much bigger problem and twice the work.As to stripping the
car,it may only require spot stripping or D.A. sanding in the specific ereas
needed.As to the worry of removing the galvinized metal finish or the zinc
primers. Metal treatment washes and acid etching primers can meet and excceed
the factory's job if you buy the quality products.
BASF makes some great products for this application and is the maker of what
you get when you order factory paint from the factory.
silkkens ,and glasurit are some of the best I have found.
What you may encounter is a bodyshop not familiar with these products and not
willing to use them since they don't know how to .,or at least won't admit
to.

Subject: Re:autocross classifications

Regarding your inquiry on autocrossing your 74 911;

1.  SCCA classifies all non turbo 911's together, so right off the bat you
are running against some very stiff competition.

2.   Shock inserts are free in solo II

3.   torsion bars are generally not free, remember this is considered a
spring in other cars and is expressly forbidden.

4.  wheels and bars are ok but only if you can show that it was a factory
option

5.  exhaust is free behind the header but most local events are muffled due
to town ordinances, there are exceptions.

6.  for more specific infor e-mail mike piera at analogmike@aol.com


7.  As far as PCA is concerned, the PCR's( Porsche competition rules) are
printed each year for the Parade autocross, there is no rule that says any of
the 120 odd PCA regions have to use them but many do.  For instance, here in
the Northeast we use a modified version which narrows down 40 some odd
classes to 12, and we do not have a separate ladies class.  Best bet is to
find out if your local porsche club uses the pcr classes and rules, if so,
then get a copy and read them carefully, many items which you think would be
free to change are not and vice-versa, plus tire circumferance is a big
issue.


                           Good luck autocrossing

I need to know how bad the news is - The 944 leaves a plume of blue
smoke on hard acceleration in low gears. It is enough to see clearly

Is this likely due to valve guides or pistons or both. If it is
pistons, should I contemplate having a 'ring job' done on the
car or is this false economy.

I fear that I will fail the UK emissions test with the engine in this
state. The car runs fine and pulls as well as can be expected. I plan

Subject: 914 project on the go

My 914 project finally got started. After reading the factory and other
manuals, nothing beats the hands on experience. 

I stripped all trim, glass, lights, and interior. Left are
engine-transmission (waiting till my lift has electricity), Gas tank and AC.
Thinking ahead (definitely prematurely), I have the following questions:

1. Paint removal.
I realize that I can grind or strip most of the paint on flat panels. How
about hooks and crannies ? Is it OK to sandblast these ? Anyone recommending
dipping the body ?
When dipping, how do you remove the hot-air ducting ? Does all wiring have to
be removed ?

2. Sound proofing material.
Do people routinely replace the floor pan paneling ? If so with what ?
How about the patches of black cloth that cover the edges and central tunnel
?
Does the fire wall rubber panel need to be replaced ? (Still in good shape,
shouldn't be a problem

3. 914/4-to-914/6
I plan to relocate the battery box and oil tank. What's a good alternate
battery location. Needs  ?
If the oil tank is relocated to the front, is an original 914/6 tank still
needed or are there other alternatives ?

4. AC
I know, not a popular option, but my car has it (One of these under dash
beauties with condensor in the front trunk). Has anyone integrated the ducts
with the in dash vents ? How do I install an oil cooler if the trunk floor
location is already taken ? Do I use a 911 compressor ? Any other thoughts ?

Solong for now, I keep you posted !

Hm... I'm inclined to ask Why? Why bother? This isn't a 914, where you 
get the different car (mid-engine, different looks) than the 911, but the 
same engine... If you put a 911 engine in your 912, are you making a 911? 
It would be cheaper to just buy a 911 for the price of getting a decent 
engine and 912 to put it in.

Oh, and it isn't litres of displacement that do a transmission in... It's 
torque and horsepower... After all, you could put a 4.3 liter V8 with it 
and depending on engine design, still not get as much torque and hp out 
of it as a 2.0 litre VW engine

Nope. Springs must be stock in SCCA.

OK, as they were stock in late '74 and '75 on CARRERAS

Front bar is free, rear must be completely stock.

> Go to a non standard exhaust system?  Use a stinger exhaust?

Any exhaust past the manifold (heat exchangers) is legal.
But you must use heay exchangers.

> How does Porsche Club rules apply?

Lots more legal mods, you can choose things which give you
a number of points and still stay in stock class. The best mods
to stay in PCR Stock that are illegal in SCCA stock are : 

Bigger torsion bars, hard bushings, 1" bigger wheels (but you
already have big enough wheels), adjustable rear spring plates.

Also asked :

That's too low for Yokos. Try mid 30's :  34/36 or so. I used 38/42 on

Subject: High RPMS and AC

I can tell you my experience with the effects of overreving on a Porsche

AC system.  I once downshifted from 5th to 4th at about 90 mph and 
accelerated in my '82 931 up to the redline (a Bimmer was tailgating
at the time!).  The result was an instant loss of AC.  It turns out that
I blew the electromagnetic clutch from the front of the AC compressor.
The flying parts took out the compressor assembly itself. The total
cost to re-establish AC in my 931 was more than $1K!  The moral of 
the story, from my point of view, is that you may be able to run the
P-car engine up to the redline, but the AC may not be up to  following.

Dear Thilo:

After reading your consecutive posts tonight, I can only conclude you must
have been sucking a long neck or ten too many.  It will be a real pity to
see a true wit like youself leave the list.  Good humour like yours is
really hard to find these days.

BTW, did you get a bottlecap stuck under your caps lock key?

Regards from California, where some of us are still somewhat sober and awake.

Make-a-Wish held the drawing for the 968 Cabriolet on Saturday evening, July
8. The winner was (insert drum roll sound effect here):

Ticket #651  Joe Riso from Walla Walla, Washington, Congrats!!!!
(Apologies for any mispellings, they couldn't locate the ticket for exact
spellings--I'm sure they were contacting the winner immediately after the

If you missed on this one, you can try for a 1996 Porsche 993 by getting a

Subject: Transmissions & Shifting

I have been reading with interest the various angles on different 
transmissions and shift patterns/mechanisms.
The current state-of-the-art setup right now is on the Formula 1 racing 
cars I believe. The way I understand it the driver upshifts and downshifts 
by pushing the appropriate button on the steering wheel. The electronics on 
the car actually does the shifting. I don't know if it's shift on demand, 
it shifts when you select a gear, or if it's done by a computer selecting 
the proper shift point.
The Indy cars on the other hand retain the manual transmission but utilize 
sequential shifting, just like a motorcycle. The is no "H" pattern 
everything is in-line so you have to hit the gears in order going up or 
down.

Just my $.02.

Its on the master cylinder.  You'll need to open the trund and look below 
the area where the brake fluid reservoir is.  BTW there are two of these 
switches.  Hope this helps.

Derek Au

P.S.  These switches operate on brake fluid pressure!  You can't adjust them, 
only replacing is an option.
______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________

I'm having trouble finding the switch which causes the brake lights 
to come on as the brake pedal is depressed.  The Clymer manual
shows an adjustment procedure with photo showing switch location behind 
the pedal on the floor.  Mine doesn't match.
I need to adjust mine so that the lights come on before the pedal 
gets to the floor ;-)  Where is this switch located?

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

     To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other 
administrative issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

     If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you
feel moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all
of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow
mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want to
convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

          e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
          voice:  1-713-661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

specific FAQ knows much about the FAQs developed by others.)

     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>",

coffee mugs, stationery, etc., made up.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/porschephiles.  The 
FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about other Porsche-related WWW links?

     There are several WWW home pages related to Porsches.  Stan has 
created an unofficial PCA home page, and has offered to make room for 
additional PCA region home pages.  Contact him if you're interested.  
The PCA home page, listed first below, contains references to all of
the known PCA region home pages.  Here are some other interesting

What about other automotive WWW links?

     There are many references to other home pages in the links noted
above.  Here is a list of a few that might be of interest to the
readership; suggestions for more are welcomed:

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions.  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts...

     "In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split."

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Fund?

     From Bart Chambers, the custodian of the fund: "Here, gentle 
reader and Porschephile, is *The Problem*!  Porschephiles has over 1200
members and generates so much traffic and creates such a demand for
computer and bandwidth resources, that its future is in jeopardy if it
remains dependent upon the *ability* and willingness of any individual
to *donate* them.  In order to ensure the continued survival of
'Philes, we, like PBS, are asking members to donate to a non-profit
fund to be used to acquire the required resources, to be *owned* by
Porschephiles.  This will reduce the load on our beloved Listmeister to
merely backbreaking.  We are asking everyone for a *VOLUNTARY* Donation
for the survival of Porschephiles.  Send your check, made out to
`Porschephiles Acct# 3933150532' to Porschephiles Custodian, c/o Bart
Chambers, 1270 Lavall Drive, Davidsonville, MD 21035.  We suggest $50
for members, $15 for Students and $100 for Patrons.  Thanks."

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The following comes from Judy Hendrickson, Chairman, PCA National
Membership Committee (DH993@aol.com):

     "PCA membership is unique among car clubs in that the criteria to
become an Active Member includes ownership of a Porsche.  This is
apparent when you see a membership application and there is a blank to
fill in the VIN.  I know for a fact that "speculation in VINs" for
acquiring membership in PCA is not new.  We have a 35-year member who 
admits his original membership was based on a 10% share in a car! 
Innovation I have witnessed includes "loaning" a VIN number to a 
friend who wants to join so he can do his first Porsche shopping.  
Using a VIN from a car acquired by a PCA member who joined with 
another, earlier car's VIN, and I'm sure some people have just made 
up a number!  Also, once you have joined PCA and are in between 
Porsches, you can remain an Associate Member, as long as you continue 
paying the $36 dues each year.  Application for Associate Membership 
can also be made by "...any person, employed by a Porsche-oriented 
business, interested in the Club and its objectives, having paid Club 
dues and fees as required."  Associate Members cannot, however, vote 
in National PCA Elections or hold National Office.  Requests for 
Associate Membership must be done through a local Region's Membership
chairperson, to verify their relationship to a business.  If you need
to be put in contact with your local Region's Membership Chairperson,
send me a note including your ZIP code.
     "The $36 annual dues (Active or Associate) not only includes your
monthly subscription to *Panorama*, but an annual payment of $12 per
member to your local Region.  Other subsidy payments to the Regions 
may also be voted by the National organization."

     Some of the features of membership (also from Judy Hendrickson):

     *Largest single marque car club in the world! (over 34.000 
      members)
     *Award winning monthly magazine - Porsche Panorama.
     *Local Regions with local newsletters and events.
     *Vast technical publications - Up-Fixin- Vols 1-8 (reprints of 
      all technical articles ever appearing in PANO, vols organized 
      by year of original publication).
     *Tech Committee (of renowned credentials) available to answer 
      your questions.  Specialists for all models plus exteriors/
      interiors and historic race cars.
     *Valuation committee to help you establish the value of your 
      car.
     *Access to specialized insurance for Porsches that are second 
      autos/pleasure only/limited mileage =$saved (Leland-West 
      Insurance - must be a PCA member)
     *Annual National Convention (Porsche Parade) gathers in 
      different location each year; over 600 Porsches and 1500 folks 
      gather for a week of nothing but Porscheing. 
     *Dues are $36 per year. MC/VISA accepted. Must provide VIN# for 
      application to be processed.

     Additional PCA membership information (courtesy of Stan):

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     Once you have a VIN number, you can:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36.

     2) Call them.  If you have your Visa/MC number and your VIN 
number handy, you can do it over the phone (see below for #).  
Otherwise, they'll send you an application which you can mail in with 
your check.  This is the FASTEST way, and if you need to be a member 
*RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that is members only, this is your best 
bet.  Don't count on using this method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_
Guide_, _Porsche_Specials_, _Cars_Are_My_Life_, _We_At_Porsche_, and
the article "Project Porsche, The Early Years" in the June '83 issue of
_Thoroughbred_&_Classic_Car_.  It includes only more or less complete 
automobiles designed by Ferdinand Porsche or by the Porsche factory.  
Components (engines, transmissions, etc.) have not been included.  
The list is incomplete, in part because there has apparently been 
imperfect record keeping at the factory.  In addition, the nature of the
list has changed over the years from an in-house listing of project 
numbers to a market-driven listing.  Additions and corrections are 
welcomed:

            but not part of the "official" model sequence.

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed
alphabetically, have been praised by various Porschephiles:

=======================================================================

What references are available for information about Porsches?

     There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for 
you depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

     The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the 
technical articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of 
their Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's 
executive office.

     What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  If 
you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note: there's 
not much information about water-cooled cars; those with favorites 
should submit them to the name at the end of this FAQ.)

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.
If something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute should 
do so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are 
always welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but I don't
promise to find everything you might want in the FAQ.  Don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me, or to the maintainers of the
model-specific FAQs in the tta.com archives.  Also, don't expect me to 
know anything about those model-specific FAQs -- this one is my only
vice.

What are your plans for the car?  Street?  Autox?  Race?
914's are known for boiling the battery and having the acid
eat out the car.  My solution?  Check the area frequently.
I'm using my car for 99% street use and I have *NO* plans
for moving the battery since I like my trunk space.  Same
goes for the oil tank.  The factory unit is cool....it mounts
inside the driver's rear fender behind the door jamb.  It
couldn't possibly be less intrusive on the storage capacity
of the car.

If you want to race the car you may want to install the battery
and aftermarket oil tank in the front trunk on the passenger
side to help balance the left/right sides of the car (to help
compensate for the driver) and to lower the center of gravity.
Of course this effectively kills the storage capacity of the
front trunk....you decide based on your priorities.

Good luck!

From: wcmarten@facstaff.wisc.edu (William Marten)
Subject: 914 Parts

I have found someone with 2 914 'parts or restore' cars for sale locally.
He has a couple of pieces I'm interested in, but he's only interested in
having the cars depart rather than parting them himself.  So . . .

If I decide to go through with this I would be looking to cut my losses a
bit.  If there's something you want or need from either a '73 1.7 or a '74
1.8, drop me a line.  I won't have the chance to see the cars until later
this week, and I will check for any and all parts requested then.

On the phone he mentioned that the 1.8 has stainless steel heat exchangers
that look 'brand new'.  And yes Nate, I saw your post and I'll look into it.
A few of the things that *won't* be on the auction block: the center
console, the side view mirror {unless there is more than one}, the headlight
switch {from the '74} and the chrome bumpers.

I'm not looking to make money on this, so insulting offers are invited, BUT
you pay shipping.  And if enough of the '73 remains, I might try
refurbishing it -- I don't think I'm capable of 'restoring' a vehicle.  :)

Let me know -- sooner the better.

Subject: Jumping 914 Tachs

A couple of members mentioned that their tach jumped and was this 'normal'.
Does the tach jump when you step on the brake?  If so, according to Dr. 914,
the brake light fuse isn't making good contact.  I've had this happen a lot.
If that isn't it, I'd start checking ground connections.

Just a thought,

I am looking for a 915 transmission to use in my 914 project.  I am
primarily looking for one with the ring and pinion already switched, but I
will still consider ones that are not switched.  Also does anyone know
where the best place to sell 914 parts to is? Should I try to sell them
here or to a place like partsheaven or something like that?

I'm currently looking at a 1980 911SC Coupe with approx. 135,000 miles.
The car is in good condition w/ Carrera tensioner update, SR, power
windows, etc.  No tail (thank god).

I've seen 911SC's comparable to this one going from $9000 - $15,000.

Anyone know what a "fair" price would be for this car.

Um, scary. I would get it checked by a competent Porsche mechanic. I

195/65 VR 15 on 6x15 phone dial rims were standard. (In Canada), 205/60
VR 16's on 6x16 rims were optional (slotted 928 style). 7x15 rims were
fitted to the rear of the "Special Edition" car in '88. 205x60-15 tires
will fit with no clearance or speedo problems.

>	5)  Any other advice would be appreciated.

Depending on your needs for the car, an 85.5 and up 944 might be a better
vehicle for you. The 944 handles a bit better, thanks to a wider track
and wider rims/tires, and has the updated interior, with a more powerful
A/C unit. You should be able to pick up a 924S for a lot less money than
the same year 944, though. Current value of these cars is pretty low <sigh>.

The vibration may be due to improper wheel balancing, or lack of alignment,
or (eek) improperly-repaired body damage. I'd really advise getting the 
car checked out thoroughly.

Good luck!

The weight distribution on a typical station wagon is better (more nearly
50/50) than that on a typical sedan, so, properly set up, will generally
handle better.  I mentioned once doing some laps at the Oesterreichring with
the Alfasuds...that was in a rental Peugeot wagon, and I came away amazed at

Subject: 1983 944 vs. 1995 Mustang 5LV8

Having read several car mag articles on current Ford Mustang 5.0L V8 coupes,
I found myself near a local Ford house w/ a few minutes to kill.  Schmoozed
w/ salesman a while (*he* drives a 944T!) and cadged a ride in a pretty blue
Mustang.  Well, it's sure a better car than the old '65-'69 versions I grew
up with, but... well, I hate to say it, it's still a tub.  The live rear axle
lets the rear wheels skitter and hop over the least irregularities in turns,
and the car seems sluggish in acceleration, considering what it's supposed to
be.  The front-heaviness and turgidity of its maneuverability were striking.
 The clutch was heavy, the usual for Ford, I recall.  I did like the shifter
and the highway tracking was okay.
I got back into my aged 944 and went back over the same roads at similar
speeds, and fell in love with my modest little used car all over again.  Why
can't an American car maker create machines with the balance and
sophistication of these little Deutschmobiles?

Thoughts?  Would the new Camaro/Firebird be any more sophisticated?  C & D et
al. praise them highly.

No gasket on either of mine or in the manuals.  Klymer does recommend VW

Well, its happening to me.  My '72 911T has been running hot the
last couple of weeks, but I can't figure out why.  Yes, I've checked the
ovious, like fan belt, timing, just did the valves about 3 months or

It runs between 210 and 250 on the guage, even at night, when its 
cool outside.  I am used to seeing it right at 180.  I'm guessing
it might be the oil thermostat - does that sound reasonable, and is there
any way I can verify it?

The car still has good power, even when its hot.  Does't 'dog out' at
all.

Any ideas would be appreciated!

Yes, I will post this to Porschephiles with "our" winning results.

Well Ken, where's the beer for the winning Porsches!  Porsche didn't
dominate every class at the local Porsche - Corvette Challenge, but did
take enough class wins to have bragging rights until the next challenge. 
That may last about five years, since the last one was around 1989-90. 
When it can down to the end, Porsche had a clean sweep of the top five
"challenge" positions in the open class and the top four in the ladies
class.  Challenge winners were Tom Dugan in a bone stock 914 beating
Dwight Mitchell because of his breakout time on his previous challenge run
and Tricia Braun (alias Tricia Hills) in another somewhat stock 914.  All
Corvettes / Camaros went out in the first round of the ladies and open
class challenges.  Top Time of Day and Top Time Corvette did belong to Ken
Yeo with a 40.8xx.  Meanwhile the Top Time of Day Porsche went to Mike
Lommatzsch in a 914 at 42.6xx. 

More details will be avialable when I see a final tally of results.

The course was designed by Bud Behrens from the Porsche club but everyone
loved the course.  Start and finish were a little tight for the Corvettes
/ Camaros but with a 360 turn in the middle that the 914 took in third
gear at 4000 rpm it was fast and open every where else.  Many kudos to Bud
for a competitive course for all of the competitors. The morning started
quickly except fot the cars that had to run immediately after Henry "Hank"
Watts had oiled down the course with a wheel that wore a hole thorugh an
oil cooler hose first thing in the morning.  After about a forty-five 
minute cleaned up we were back running again.  Meanwhile the heat had 
been turned up and with the early morning showers, the humidity must have 
been near 100%.  Many people were seen wearing towels and drinking plenty 
of the non-alcoholic drinks for the rest of the day.  Everyone got two 
sets of two runs.  A run consisted of two laps; a warm up and a hot lap.

Many thanks to Jeff Glorioso from the Corvette club and Pat Ikeda from 
the Porsche club for setting this event up.  Also instrumental in 
the class structures, course design and site arrangement were Dwight 
Mitchell and Bud Behrens as mentioned earlier.

Everyone had a fantastic time and looks forward to a repeat challenge 
next year.  Though we would prefer that the beer be available at the end 
of the event by the Corvette's to make up for this years win by Porsche.

So Ken, what do you have to say now?  And about those excuses you had 
talked about all the Porsche owners needing to use?  Guess you'll have to 
save them for the next challenge should Porsche lose......NOT!

It seems like some GM owners never learn. Guess it all adds up for them ,if
you gave them a trip to Sud-Deutschland (or  South Germany) towards the
Alps. *That's* the roads Porsches were made for,...I guess Mulholland Drive
would be a starter......

No pun intended, the GM cars are born under other circumstances, modified

Subject: Tyre brand recommendations for 911 Carrera 3.2

	My 3.2 Carrera is currently shod with Comp T/As, 205/55 ZR16 on the 
front and 225/50 ZR16 on the rear.

	I need to replace one of the fronts (down to legal limit!) and one of 
the rears (small but deep hole near sidewall), and the other rear is no longer 
pristine, so I'm thinking of biting the bullet and buying a set of 4 new tyres, 
especially as Comp T/As are getting quite hard to find in the UK.

	I use the car mostly for commuting with the odd blast down country lanes 
at weekends, but no track or Auto-X at all. We get lots of rain in England and 
the odd snowfall in winter and my car sees them all. I'm more concerned with 
good mileage than with stickiness at the limit (so don't want A008Ps!). Noise 
doesn't bother me at all. Price is an issue, though all these tyres seem to be 
in the same ballpark. So what tyres should I go for?

	My local Porsche main dealer is pushing PIRELLI P700Zs very hard, saying 
that they are much the same as GOODYEAR EAGLE 5-rib or DUNLOP D40/2, but that 
these two tyres wear in the centre more quickly than the PIRELLIs. A tyre dealer 
(who runs a 928) is trying to sell me BRIDGESTONE EXPEDIAs or BRIDGESTONE RE71s 
... he says that the RE71s give better mileage but not quite as much grip as the 
EXPEDIAs.

	I have also come across TOYO (who claim to come as standard equipment on 
Porsches), AVON TURBOSPEED (not approved by Porsche and said to be noisy) and 
FULDA (though no fronts are available for my car just now).

	All suggestions and advice appreciated.

Alaska Region PCA welcomes all competitors regardless of "sportiness"
providing that they pass Tech. The 3rd place driver in our our 1995 
challenge
series drives a pick-up, he is blinding fast!! Have a nice lady who comes 
out
occasionally in her Lincoln Towncar, doesn't place well but finishes in the

2.7 911 motor, always finishes last.  Forget the "CAR", the driver makes all
the difference. A good driver in a Towncar or even a pick-up will beat the

Interesting.....
I too looked at a new Mustang and also the new Trans Am; I'm impressed!
I typically commute 100 miles per day- half freeway, half mountainous, 
tortuous roads. I am 5'6" and have been a confirmed Porsche addict all my 
life: no more. It is simply financial for me: The most expensive Porsche 
to me is a used one, and new ones are obscenely priced for what one 
gets(i.e.:$47,000.00 gets me either a 300HP Corvette, 2 
Camaros/TransAms/Mustangs, or a 968/986). And lets not forget the gas 
guzzler tax and luxury tax. Oh, luxury? I've owned a new 944, a used 
944S, and a 911SC "Weissach Coupe". The leather in those cars is so hard 
and uncomfortable it could better be used as tire retread plies. Oh yes, 
and we must not forget the sheer joy of taking out 2nd and 3rd mortgages 
to repair these vehicles; the 911 series was (IMHO), the worst. I 
actually sold mine while it sat in the local Porsche dealer's bay.

We traded the Frau's 87 VW Wolfsburg Edition Cabriolet on the Carrera Cabriolet
two years ago (only had 25K miles on the VW).  If you like Convertibles,
this is absolutely one of the best, and the frau probably wishes she still
had it, because it is so roomy and comfortable, and *much* easier to get in
and out of (for a couple of geezers like us).  The fully lined and insulated top
makes the interior more like a coupe than a ragtop.  The back seat is *Very* 
comfortable and roomy for two full-sized adults.  Luggage space, however is
seriously compromised if you are thinking of 4 adults on a long trip.  That's 
the only flaw (OK, it could use more hp, but then, so could the Carrera...)

Bottom line: My advice is go for a cab, and don't even consider the Saab (which 
does have more room, but is not a rag-top).  Nothing, I mean *nothing* beats a 
rag-top, and the VW meets your criteria beautifully!

     The 911 is a good A Stock or ASP car. For the stock class you are not 
     allowed to change much. Any shock or strut (gas shocks will make your 
     car 1/4" higher than it used to be!), any front swaybar (check out 
     Weltmeister from Automotion), no lowering, no torsion-bar changes, no 
     non-OEM wheels (if 7s and 8s were offered by the factory for your 
     year, they are OK - but you may be better off using the same size 
     wheels to easily rotate your tires). Any exhaust system is OK as long 
     as it still has the heating stuff...
     
     Make friends with Mike Piera (sp?). He is an SCCA A Stock National 
     Champ. Dwight Mitchell was very competitive in a '73 911 in ASP. I 
     don't think he ever won ASP nationally, but he did win SP1 (Pro Solo) 
     a number of times.
     
     PCA classifications are entirely up to your local region.
     
     If you are in the least bit serious, get sticky tires ASAP and get a 
     ride from someone who knows how to autocross.
     
     Good Luck!

Mike,

I'd like to return to some questions about the car you have (had?) 4sale.

I've just contacted the Customs and there are new rules which let cars older
than 3 years being imported. I have not gotten all the details, but I
believe I will have to pay 18% of the *very high* import tax we have for new
cars. They will calculate the cars price from '73 and I will have to pay
after some strange rules,....checking at the moment.

Questions (some may have been asked before,...I don't remember);

1) How much rust, and where is it located? What panels are needed?

2) What is needed mechanichally?

3) How is brakes and suspension parts?

4) Does the interior suck?

5) Did you already sell it?

cheers,
Trond V.

PS: It was $4k you asked? ($6k?)

Philes,

I'm thinking of making a trek up to Elkhart Lake for the Labor Day
school (I don't yet consider my 951 disposable enough to do a club
race). Never having attended a school held in conjunction with a PCA
race, I'm concerned that school track time may be sacrificed in order to
give racers access to the track. Given the distance (14+ hrs. from
Atlanta), I don't want to attend if I can't count on a reasonable amount
of seat time...

What's been your experience?  Would I be better off waiting for a
school-only event?

ROAD WARRIORS / THE WEEKEND RACERS WHO HAUL THEIR PORSCHES, BMWS AND CORVETTES
OUT TO MAKESHIFT RACETRACKS AREN'T HOPING FOR PRIZES OR MEDALS -- JUST A CHANCE
                          TO INDULGE THEIR FANTASIES
                                       

 Peter Sinton, Chronicle Senior Writer  


Choosing between Sunday in the park and Sunday in a parking lot is a
no-brainer for most people. But to a committed cadre of sports car
nuts, nothing beats renting the asphalt around Candlestick Park or
Oakland Coliseum on a nongame weekend and turning it into a mini race
course.

  On Father's Day, 88 members of Porsche Club of America drove or
trailered their four-wheel treasures to the 'Stick from as far away
as Reno and paid $20 each to navigate a twisting course marked by
scores of orange cones. Although the would-be Mario and Maria
Andrettis spent most of their time watching, waiting and discussing
tire pressures and torsion bars, most believed that eight laps and a
total of five or six minutes of adrenaline-rush track time was worth
it.

 Ken Masuda, a Campbell landscape contractor, got bitten by the
racing bug six months ago when he saw a list of car clubs, including
the 1,100-member Golden Gate Chapter of the Porsche Club.

 ``I always loved to drive,'' said Masuda, who now leaves his wife
at home to take care of the 9-year-
old and twin 7-year-olds so he can play with his other baby, a 5-year-
old Porsche model 911 C4. ``Now I get to drive at 90 percent to 100
percent potential.''

 Masuda, 40, was so anxious to enter his first autocross in Salinas last
January that he cut short a weekend ski trip to Lake Tahoe to drive back
Saturday night.

 Parking-lot autocrosses are relatively cheap. In addition to the entry fee,
equivalent to an amusement-park admission, you only need a helmet. But the
event takes a toll on the auto, mainly tires that don't last long when
you're skidding sideways or slamming on the brakes before a tight turn.

 Drivers compete against the clock, trying to better their own lap times.
Winning isn't everything, but most drivers watch the competition carefully.
There are dozens of classes of cars, categorized by year and model and
whether they have special tires or more serious modifications.  Amateur
racing extends beyond a Candlestick 500 -- that's yards, not miles -- to
time trial events at bona fide race courses. Porsche Club, BMW Club, Sports
Car Club of America (SCCA) and other groups increasingly are renting Laguna
Seca Raceway in Monterey County and Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma County for
their members.

 The leap to the race track is a serious one, because speeds are far greater
and the consequences of spinning out are far graver than knocking over a
rubber cone and taking a one-second deduction on your lap time.

``This is a loony sport,'' said a grinning Larry Jackson, a gas crew foreman
for PG&E who last year ran 35 Porsche Club and SCCA events. ``It's like an
addiction; I'm here at Candlestick for my weekly fix.''

 It doesn't have to cost a lot. Jackson, 40, plunked down $3,200 for a
turquoise 1973 Porsche 914 three years ago. Then came the set of soft
compound racing tires and a new suspension system for about $500 each, a
smaller steering wheel for $150, an anti-sway bar he found for $30 at a swap
meet and a $350 roll bar.

 ``None of this makes sense,'' admits Jackson. He added, ``Costs for the
first event can be a killer.''

 In addition to the $165 basic fee for a weekend of racing (about two hours
of actual track time), Masuda figures he spent about $1,500 to get ready for
his first time trial. Porsche and most other clubs require five-point safety
harnesses, installed fire extinguishers, fireproof gloves and shoes. Once
drivers get hooked, they can easily spend double or triple that on a second
set of wheel rims and sticky compound racing tires as well as roll bars.

So far Masuda has been content paying more attention to improving his
driving skills than beefing up his car.

 ``Learning to drive what you have is important,'' said Lloyd DeMartini, who
bought his first Porsche 25 years ago. ``More people blame their cars more
than themselves.'' The 48-year-old aerospace engineer and his wife Patti
have three Porsches, including a six-cylinder 1973 Porsche 914 that is as
customized as the Batmobile.  DeMartini does everything but motor
modifications himself and figures if he had paid someone else for all the
work he's done, the bills would top $80,000 instead of $30,000.

 David Kimes, 52, president of the Porsche Club's Golden Gate Region,
figures he has invested about $20,000 in his own 1971 914, which he calls
Herbie. Two sets of Goodyear racing slicks run about $1,800 a year, brake
pads add some more, and ``then there's little stuff that breaks,'' said
Kimes, a project manager for IBM in San Jose.

 Herbie rewarded Kimes with the best lap time on Father's Day -- 34.928
seconds -- about 10 seconds faster than the slowest time. But it came at a
cost. Monday morning Herbie was in the shop to diagnose a serious
clutch/transmission problem.

 Turning a parking lot into a race track can chew up the asphalt a bit, too,
but no more so than weekdays when Candlestick and other public facilities
turn their lots over to fire and police departments, the Highway Patrol and
Muni drivers. Public agencies increasingly are using parking lots to learn
or brush up on their parallel parking, high-speed driving and obstacle
avoidance techniques.

 These groups don't pay a dime to rent the lots while car clubs and dealers
pay $1,000 or more per day for the open space. ``It's starting to be a big
thing for all the stadiums,'' said Candlestick Park Chief Engineer Michael
Gay. In addition to Porsche and Sports Car Club of America events, carmakers
such as Acura, BMW and Chrysler are taking over Candlestick this year to
show dealers and potential buyers what the new models can really do.

 On June 9 through 11, Corvette rolled into the Oakland Coliseum with its
``American Dream & Drive Tour,'' part of a 20-city annual road show of
General Motors' sportiest car.

 ``More groups want to rent the space,'' said Bill DiCarlo, assistant
general manager of the Coliseum. One Saturday, Corvette rented half the
parking lot and a radio station rented the other half for a promotion. The
revenue is nice, but it hardly compares to what the stadium will make
renting all 10,000 parking spaces for $7 each when the Raiders return to
Oakland.

 If it's hard finding an open day at the biggest public parking lots, it's
even tougher finding a vacant race track. Weekends at Sears Point and Laguna
Seca are all booked up, not just for professional races but also for amateur
events.

 The Sports Car Club of America has reserved the Monterey track for five
events this year. But the 5,000-member local chapter of the national
organization has so much demand that two years ago it built its own track,
Thunderhill Park in Willows north of Sacramento.

 Tracks don't come cheap. Laguna Seca rents for a minimum of $2,800 a day
plus a 20 percent administrative fee. Then there are incidentals: an
ambulance on standby for $114.42 an hour, eight to 12 course workers (if you
don't provide your own) for $50 each, a sound tester (another $50) to make
sure the racket remains below 92 decibels. Finally, you'll need at least $5
million in liability insurance.

 Porsche Club is one of the most active sports car organizations, with 11
chapters and close to 3,000 members in Northern California.  But it is
hardly alone in searching out vacant parking lots or race tracks and holding
rallies, overnight fun runs and Friday night socials.

Tom Georgalos, a produce salesman for Fresh Express in Salinas, remembers
clinging to the fence at Laguna Seca as a kid and wishing he could be on the
track. Now his Green Flag Driving Association occasionally takes over the
track and he can throw his 1965 Ford Shelby GT 350 through the famous
corkscrew turn himself.

 The Pacific Region of the Ferrari Club of America also runs on local
tracks. But its most popular event is the annual September hill climb to
Virginia City from Carson City, when the 375-member organization pays the
state of Nevada to close down a five-mile stretch of Highway 341.

 The BMW club, with more than 3,000 members in Northern California, holds
autocrosses at an airport in Sonoma County and also stakes out race tracks.
But the events are geared more to instruction than competitive time trialing.

 ``Our program is focused on the learning curve,'' said Jim Grinstead, a
PG&E transmission planner who manages BMW's driving events in his spare
time. ``We provide an alternative to learning the limits of your car some
morning on a rain-soaked Nimitz Freeway.''

Sorry for the late reply. The TWO:1995 edition of Audio Amateur magazine
includes a design for a high-accuracy low impedance regulator for a 
radio shack 3400 (6V), one popular CD model. I expect waht you're seeing 
is an overvoltage at the supply, which forces the internal regs to dissipate
mucho heat.

Just throwing a canned regulator and filter at the problem is likely
to be susceptable to noise (high impedance).

        It came out in 1970, the year that the 914 was introduced.
About all he has to say about the Type IV is that "It's already got
a lot of these modifications built in, and we don't know enough
about it yet to make many successful modifications."  He also talks
about putting Porsche power in a Bug--and means only 356.  And talks
about a $1000 rebuild for that motor.  >chuckle!<  He also mentions
putting a Corvair engine in a bug, but no mention of the 911 engine.
Odd, seeing as the 911 engine is *much* better engineered than the
Corvair one.

Citrus cleaner works real well to loosen up all that

I used 3M brand stuff in the spray can, but you can use

as well.

Spray the window, then stick some newspaper to the wetted

to loosen up all the adhesive.

Same precautions: the aerosol stuff is flammable, and even
though the stuff is made from orange peels, it is dangerous

Subject: re: Porsche - Corvette/Camaros "GET" slaughtered

This message was sent to me by Mike Lommatzsch, Team Porsche, and
I am forwarding it to the world because he did an excellant job
in writing it and I'm too damn lazy to write something right now
because I want to rest up for the SCCA National Tour in Seattle.

However, I would like to add my 2 1/100ths of a dollar to this
posting. Yes, the top remaining cars in the overall challenge
were Porsches and Team Chevrolet was eliminated in the first
round.

Fact (Not an excuse) - Team Chevrolet wanted to live up its kool
& laid-back image in slamming down the cold ones immediately so
we decided to just go out immediately and let the Porsches play.
(It was too damn hot and we were thirsty) I went fast in the
first round in the overall challenge but, on my timed lap
someone, no doubt someone from Team Porsche, put 3 cones on the
line I was taking. Subsequently, they were killed and of course,
I was charged with the kills. (Those damn kones keep getting in
my way - SHIT!) Teresa Lommatzsch, Team Chevrolet (My Co-Driver)
was a winner in her class and made the challenge but, was
eliminated immediately in the first round. I'm not sure if she
was thirsty to.

All kidd'n aside, the event was a lot of fun for both teams. Bud
even bought the beer ("BUD") (I wonder why Bud drinks "BUD") for
everyone and joined Team Chevrolet for dinner. 

I think Mary Anne Behrens, the wife of the PCA National Safety 
God, wants to get a Corvette now. I think she likes the roar of
the V8. 

Who WON??? We don't know yet. A Team Porsche driver won the
overall challenge. There were some Team Chevrolet class wins and
there were some Team Porsche class wins. I asked Bud, which team
won? He said he couldn't tell at the moment and that he would
have to set down and add things up. Definitely, it was not a
onesided event. It looks like a toss-up, its that close.

No it wasn't a walk in the park, or like taking candy from a
baby, a piece of cake for either team but, we had lots of fun and
that is the important factor. I want to do it again.

Yes, I will post this to Porschephiles with "our" winning results.

Well Ken, where's the beer for the winning Porsches!  Porsche didn't
dominate every class at the local Porsche - Corvette Challenge, but did
take enough class wins to have bragging rights until the next challenge. 
That may last about five years, since the last one was around 1989-90. 
When it can down to the end, Porsche had a clean sweep of the top five
"challenge" positions in the open class and the top four in the ladies
class.  Challenge winners were Tom Dugan in a bone stock 914 beating
Dwight Mitchell because of his breakout time on his previous challenge run
and Tricia Braun (alias Tricia Hills) in another somewhat stock 914.  All
Corvettes / Camaros went out in the first round of the ladies and open
class challenges.  Top Time of Day and Top Time Corvette did belong to Ken
Yeo with a 40.8xx.  Meanwhile the Top Time of Day Porsche went to Mike
Lommatzsch in a 914 at 42.6xx. 

More details will be avialable when I see a final tally of results.

The course was designed by Bud Behrens from the Porsche club but everyone
loved the course.  Start and finish were a little tight for the Corvettes
/ Camaros but with a 360 turn in the middle that the 914 took in third
gear at 4000 rpm it was fast and open every where else.  Many kudos to Bud
for a competitive course for all of the competitors. The morning started
quickly except fot the cars that had to run immediately after Henry "Hank"
Watts had oiled down the course with a wheel that wore a hole thorugh an
oil cooler hose first thing in the morning.  After about a forty-five 
minute cleaned up we were back running again.  Meanwhile the heat had 
been turned up and with the early morning showers, the humidity must have 
been near 100%.  Many people were seen wearing towels and drinking plenty 
of the non-alcoholic drinks for the rest of the day.  Everyone got two 
sets of two runs.  A run consisted of two laps; a warm up and a hot lap.

Many thanks to Jeff Glorioso from the Corvette club and Pat Ikeda from 
the Porsche club for setting this event up.  Also instrumental in 
the class structures, course design and site arrangement were Dwight 
Mitchell and Bud Behrens as mentioned earlier.

Everyone had a fantastic time and looks forward to a repeat challenge 
next year.  Though we would prefer that the beer be available at the end 
of the event by the Corvette's to make up for this years win by Porsche.

So Ken, what do you have to say now?  And about those excuses you had 
talked about all the Porsche owners needing to use?  Guess you'll have to 
save them for the next challenge should Porsche lose......NOT!

Subject: Re: Tyre recommendations (long)

Hi Philip,

Although I do not have a 911, I have had a number of high performance cars,
and a few different types of tires (or should I say tyres?). I have had
Goodyear Eagle GT and GT+4, Goodrich Comp T/A VR, Dunlop SP4000, and
Bridgestone RE 71. One of my friends currently had Dunlop D40 M2.

Of all the tires, I like the Bridgestone RE 71 the best. 

I HATED the Goodyear Eagle GT. They (Goodyear) had good dry weather
performance, but very poor feedback at the limit. They would stick, stick,
stick, and then just let go in one big slide with little warning. They were
also TERRIBLE in the rain. They lasted about 30,000 miles

My wife had Eagle GT + 4. These were much better in rain an snow than the
Eagle, but not nearly as good in the dry. They did provide better feedback.
Due to my type of driving (more pure sports than just driving) I have ruled
these out, but you want to consider them. The GT + 4 also lasted a long time,
close to 50,000 miles. They were reasonable affordable, too.

The Bridgestone RE 71 were as good as Goodyead GT in the dry (maybe a little
better), and gave plenty or warning before they would start to slide. THe car
would stick, stick, stick, squeal a little, squeal some more, squeal LOUD,
and then start to slide.The slides were predictable, and controllable. The
Bridgestone were also much better in the rain. The RE 71 lasted about 40,000
miles.

I also liked the Goodrich Comp T/A. They were a lot cheaper than the
Bridgestone, and probably better in the rain. They were not as good in the
dry. They gave plenty of feedback, and slides were easy to control, with
plenty of warning. They appeared to wear well, although I can't give exact
numbers because one car that I had them on was stolen, and the other car I
had them on was sold before the tires were worn out.

My current car has Dunlop SP4000. So far, they have impressed me with how
well they work in the dry. I have a few track day's on them, and on the track
they were better than I expected. Not as good as the RE 71, but at least as
good, and maybe a little better than the Comp T/A. I have heard that they are
good in the rain, but I have very little experience so far. I also can't help
with mileage.

Finally, one of my friends has the D40 M2, and I like them. They seem similar
to the SP4000. I think the SP4000 might be a little better, but it is hard to
say because it's not my car and I don't have that much time behind the wheel.

I hoped this helpd. It is just hy $.02

Not only were the exhaust studs broken off, but they also had broken-off

He sent the heads to someone else for EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining),

        This is the tachometer, not the odometer.
        The tach in a 914/4 works off the FI trigger points in the base of the
distributor.  I remember someone saying, if the tach does this, to check those

     No. They are relatively lightweight, and you can easily swap the 
     balljoint and bushings. They are from the VW Rabbit, so go to a VW 
     parts department and save big bucks.
     
     However, I have had some TERRIBLE experiences with them. The SCCA Solo 
     II stock class allows you to exchange the front swaybar. The only 
     adjustable one I know of is the Weltmeister bar from Automotion. It 
     mounts in the normal position on the aluminum a-arms, but you must 
     drill a hole through the middle of the steel a-arms to mount it.
     
     Accident #1: I was autocrossing at Sacramento about 2 1/2 hrs from 
     home. I was going around a 20-25 mph right corner when the a-arm 
     snapped in half, right through the drilled mounting hole. Carroll 
     Smith would say "stress riser". I would say SH*T.
     
     At the time I blamed my lack of mechanical aptitude. Since I was so 
     far from home, I had the car towed to Dwight Mitchell's shop 
     (Autosport Technology). $1200 and one week later, I had 2 new steel 
     a-arms, a four-wheel alignment, and a crumpled left fender.
     
     Accident #2: About one year later, I was autocrossing at Pleasanton 
     about 1/2 hour from home. I was going around a left-hand corner about 
     30-40 mph when the a-arm once again breaks, right through the drilled 
     mounting hole.
     
     Ken Mitchell (ex-GGR PCA member), bless his heart, helped me put my 
     car on his trailer and towed me home.
     
     Now, I had matching crumpled fenders.
     
     If you want to go to another vendor, I understand somebody (Fabtech?) 
     makes competition a-arms. This month's Pano has an interesting warning 
     from the factory concerning aluminum a-arms. Porsche is recommending 
     the Club Sport arms for heavy competitive uses. They have a 951 part 
     number instead of a 944 number.
     
     In the Northeast, there are a lot of stories about balljoint failures 
     at speed on cars that have been lowered too much. The July 1 Driver Ed 
     at Watkins Glen won't allow lowered 944s with aluminum arms to run.

Subject: Fords and Porsches



Well, comparing Mustangs and 944/968s now? I have been for the last year,
with a 94 Mustang Cobra coupe and my various 924 Turbos, 944s,etc. 

Handling wise, the Porsche is better, though not by much. The tactil
driving response is much better in the Porsche. The Mustang does have a 
live axle, but remains fully controllable through all but the most 
uneven surfaces, the Porsche handling also suffers on theses surfaces, 
but does not have the heaving effect a live axle has because of the 
lower mass.

On a track comparison, which many magazines are using these days, my
Mustang was a full 5 seconds slower a lap than my 944. There is a good 
reason for this. The 944 had almost 16 years of behind the wheel 
experience in it's favor AND some very good chassis preparation, Koni 
sport shocks and very stick A008RTU tires. The Mustang was barely into
being 5 weeks old and I had very little time in it prior to going out on the track.

Despite the lack of prep, I found that the Mustang Cobra was very well
balanced, easy to drive hard and quite comperable in feel to an
unprepped 944 that I drove at the same event to tie my impressions
together. The Mustang was faster than that stock example. The Cobra 
model also had the best Non-Porsche, non-Corvette brakes I have ever 
used. They match the Club Sport brakes in size and response. The Mustang 
GT is not as well suspended, nor does it have the larger brakes, two
critical deficiences.

Power-wise, the Mustang is fine.  Gearing could be better, though it is 
perfect for highway driving. It is hard to pass on the value offered,
mine was about $24K. True, fit and finish could have been more 
meticulous in a couple of areas, but for commuting, the Mustang Cobra 
is a fine choice. Most of the brain-dead commuters are far more 
courteous to the Mustang than they are to the Porsche.

For serious driving, I prefer the Porsche. A much finer automobile
for the enthusiast.

I believe Dave is mistaken. The tachometer works off the (ignition) points.
 It's the same on all 4-cylinder 914s, including the 1.8, which has
L-Jetronic and hence does not have seperate FI trigger points.

As to _why_ the tach is bobbing, there isn't much to the tacho's wiring. If
the points and condensor are good, and the wires to the tach are good, you
may actually have a bad tacho - it happens.

Hi,

A bit related to the discussion about tacho's, my 944
has a small tacho problem. It won't work for a while
after a cold start. It requires some warm-up or me
to tap on the dashboard. I'd imagine there is a

Mostl likely cause is a bit of oil causing the tach to be
sticky until you tap it.  You can either replace it for 
about $100 or live with it... (P.S. when you get ready to
sell the car, keep it warmed up...)

Subject: Gears on Crankshafts


Don't you love it when someone asks for advice, folks 
generously take their time to give it, and then it's ignored.  
Guilty.

Advice about putting the gears back on the crankshaft included 
using an arbor press, heating on a hotplate, heating in an oven, 
and heating in a frying pan, all of which are simple and work.  
But when I picked up the crankshaft from the machine shop 
where it had been micropolished, I asked the machinist how he 
does it.  You would have to see this place to understand why 
you would do whatever this fellow says. He's an old-timer, 
been building racing engines - lots  of Porsche's - for many 
years.  He does all the machine work for the best places in 
Seattle.   Doesn't advertise.  All word of mouth.  His shop is an 
extension of his house.  You'd never know it was there.  It's in 
the middle of a quiet, residential neighborhood. And it's 
equipped with everything, and I mean everything.  To an 
amateur mechanic/machinist like me, it's paradise.

Anyway, he said he just heats 'em with a Bernz-O-Matic
torch till you can smell a little oil smell in the air, and
then slips 'em right on.  So that's what I did.  Took about
a minute and a half.  No fry pan.  No hot plate.  No oven. No 
oil.

I have a problem with trying to heel and toe in my '77 911S. I can't reach
the accelerator pedal while braking, so I added a 3/4" wood block to the
accelerator pedal and now I can reach it with the edge of the foot, but
then I realized the pedal has about 1" of play! It goes in for a bit and
only then the engine revs up. To go that far and still brake I would have
to be a contorsionist! Is that normal? Can anything (in the accelerator
play) be adjusted? How important is it to cover the wood block with some
sort of rubber pad? I couldn't find anything that would fit.

Folks,

My 73.5 911T (CIS, all stock) is acting strangely, and I'm not sure where
to look.  

At 2000-3000 RPM in any gear (mostly 2,3,4) with *light* throttle (ie. quiet
cruising, neither heavy throttle or coasting), the car surges rapidly and
forcefully, *as though* the I was gently but rythmically pushing the 
throttle on and off.  I can hear no miss -- the engine runs strong and
idles beautifully.

Any ideas?  What should I look for?

Thanks,

Subject: 914 FI wiring

        Oops.  I think I may have done some mis-labeling when I took
the FI wiring harness apart.  This is for a 74 2.0L, BTW--made 10/73.
        I have three single wires that I think may have gotten con-
fused.  Two come out of the wire bundle that eventually goes to the
coil.  One is green with a red tracer, the other is white.  The final
wire is also white, and come out of the wire bundle that eventually
leads to the FI trigger points in the base of the distributor.  All
three wires have/had female spade-type connectors on the end.
        I had the GN/RD wire marked "oil press", but now I think it
possible I mis-labeled it.  The second white wire was marked "thermo
time", which is what controls the aux air valve.  It may also be mis-
labeled.  The first white wire is not marked.
        Can someone help me straighten out my spaghetti?  TIA!

For what it's worth, my '75 with the 1.8 and L-Jetronic has the 
standard 914 bouncy tach, and the other '75 w/1.8 that I've had close 
exposure to (though it was a long time ago) had a bouncy tach, as

I've had the points changed twice since I've had the car, with no

Yes, any shock/strut may be used provided it follows the rules. Without

original mounting points and system are unaltered.

    > >Can you lower the car?

Contrary to some beliefs, there are -some- situations that allow you 
to lower a car in Stock class. The torsion bar suspension does seem to
allow for this.

13.8
...Both front and rear suspension may be adjusted through their designed
range of adjustment by use of factory adjustment arrangements or by 
taking advantage of inherent manufacturing tolerances...

The front suspension of all 914s and older 911s qualify here. So if 
you feel like it'll help, you can lower the front as far as you want...

    > >Change the torsion bars to 27mm?                                

Nope, not in stock class, as a torsion bar is considered a "spring" 
and spring rates must stay stock.
     
    > >Go to 7" and 8" wide rims?

Nope, not unless the width, diameter, and offset could be had as an 
option that model year. Otherwise, what was stock for the car then, 
is what you can use.

Front sway bars are unrestricted, rear sway bars may not be altered, 
and you may not add one that wasn't available as an option that model

Subject: Pesky varmints/How could I?

This comes as a warning to all of us P-philes. I'd parked the Orange
Monster a little too long at my SO's. I was aware he has a bit of a rat
problem, but _really_ no idea!!! There's a restaurant behing his house with
a sign "RAT HEAVEN! We keep our dumpster wide open to all little furries.
Bring the whole family and have more!" This has created the problem and our
dog (150+ to date), ratter tho she is, doesn't allow no 'katz' in the yard.

On to the reason of this post...

A weekend ago I was preparing the Orange Monster for a leisurely drive to
the beach. I opened the bonnet and found the cutest thing, an oil rag
curled into a most comfortable position and cushily lined with grass. The
spoor around indicated that a small mouse/rat had been having a little too
much fun (the disco lights should have been the first tip off) at my baby's
expense.

I thought that, after throwing the evidence away, I'd crashed the party and
rid myself of the pest. HA! <-- Rat laugh

I started driving the beast to work again and noticed this odor invading
the cab. I figured the few calling cards I'd found had spoiled the pristine
carpet and I now needed to shampoo and deodorize. No problem. I was so
happy that I'd caught this thing early. HA HAA <-- Hearty rat laugh

I proceed to buy special deodorizing shampoos (nothing too good for my
honey) and start the tear down. I take the carpet out, spread it out on a
nice clean surface and start scrbbing away. It occurred to me that I might
find another comfy nest in the spare. But there was no more evidence, so
I'm off scott free, right? HA HA HAAA <-- Scoundrelly rat laugh

I finished the carpet cleaning and put it up to dry. I then went on to
washing and deodorizing the boot just in case that teeny tiny bit of rat
piss soaked through to the metal. At this time I thought it might be a good
idea to check the heater cockpit. I don't have a gas heater and keep a few
emergency items stored there. I always thought of this place as a
'sanctuary'. A secure, hidden place to keep those small items that are
seldom used, but necessay when needed. HA HA HA HAAAA <-- Twist of the
whiskers rat laugh

A sickening feeling sunk into my bowels when I flipped the lock and popped
the hatch. Nudged right up against the hatch door was a mound of grass. An
overwhelming rat piss/shit odor, no smell soured the air. On went the
rubber gloves and mask. I grabbed the wet/dry vac, but soon realized that I
just had to roll up my sleeves and remove the bulk of the debris by hand.

When I grabbed the first handful it felt very heavy. I caught a glimpse of
something gray diving into a large porthole under the steering column. Did
I really see something? Was I disturbing a rat condo? Seems so. The little
rascal had filled the entire box with grass and shit. I never knew how deep
that box is. After a whole grocery bag full of this refuse, I knew that
this was not a condo, but the whole project! It must've taken weeks for
this monument to be built. Where was I and what was my role in coming to
the aide of my sleigh?

I began with thourough vaccumming, then doused with vinegar (great for
metal!), followed with an organic cleaner. Even with a week of airing, the
stench hasn't gone completely away. I'm going to give it another treatment.

The entry to the boot itself was a plastic plug that had been gnawed
through. Cute, huh? Saved it for posterity. The entry to the heater hatch
was the large porthole under the steering column. I plugged this hole with
a formed heavy duty screen (formed around a pool ball that was roughly the
same size as the hole) and some steel wool. Because of the heater duct
going directly into the cab, I figured the hole is to push presurized air
through the area and on into the cab. It probably isn't a good idea to plug
this hole so the screen allows airflow, but restricts rodent flow.

It makes sense to check this hatch if you've left your car sitting anywhere
for any length of time. Especially if you've caught a whiff of something
distinctly animalistic.

This is how I spent last weekend - oh and my company golf tourney!

   Having read several car mag articles on current Ford Mustang 5.0L V8 coupes,
   I found myself near a local Ford house w/ a few minutes to kill.
[. . .]
   I got back into my aged 944 and went back over the same roads at similar
   speeds, and fell in love with my modest little used car all over again.  Why
   can't an American car maker create machines with the balance and
   sophistication of these little Deutschmobiles?

As a former Mustang GT and SVO Mustang owner (and current 911 owner),
I agree with most of your comparison comments, especially the live
axle problems.  However, to be fair, I should point out that I bought
my '82 Mustang GT brand new for $7,200.  How much did your '83 944
cost?  Ford had a pretty different set of goals and constraints for
the Mustang that Porsche had for the 944.

And I still miss the SVO's shifter...

Hi Folks,

Chris,
Cecil Beach (owner of Bodystyle, 408-436-1616) and his 911-loving wife,
Carol, have done lots of work for me over the last few years (fixing prior
owners mistakes!).  I would recommend them highly.  Their work really is
first-class.

The only caveat I would give you is that Cecil *always* takes longer than he

Nate,
     A international drivers license is not necessary. Your license is valid
due to reciprocal agreement. However, you definitely need a passport. These
can be obtained in 24 hours if needed (In a pinch, at extra cost)
     Regarding trains + freebies, your in luck. the Porsche Factory tour
and museum are both free and easily accessible by train. After arrival in
Stuttgart, take the local S-bahn subway which stops about a block from the
factory complex. I suggest you contact PCNA now to make a reservation for
a tour. It is usually possible for U.S. folks to tag onto a existing tour
without a reservation, however this is frowned upon and not guaranteed.
The museum is open to the public without reservation.
     Enjoy.

Subject: 914 -> Early 911 Brakes

Hello All,
	While looking through some catalogs, I became confused.  I was
thinking about bolting on the 911 front suspension to gain the benifits of
better braking/handling.  From what I understand, the '65 to early '75 911
front calipers are fitted w/the same pad as the 914.  I understand Porsche
went to vented rotors in '70 for most models, but they retained the same size
pad until 1975(with exception the the "S" alloy calipers, which had a larger
pad.  My question is this, what is the added benifit of going to a 65-75 model
911 front suspension?  Besides possibly better handling from the larger
torsion bars, I can't think of any.  In terms of braking, there should be
less fade under constant, heavy braking with the vented rotors, not better
braking.  If the only way to get better braking is to install a 75 to
present front end, this is not a very economical swap, as there are just
not as many "spare" suspensions lying around. Also, what is the story with the
BMW 320 Calipers (what year, what needs to be done...)?  If they have a
larger pad area than the early 911/914, wouldn't this be the best route to
improved braking?

Thanks for any contributions,

Well, to add my $.02:

I have raced against both a 95 mustang (SCCA Showroom stack A with 6 cyln
engine) and a Ford special vehicle team 95 V8. The SVT V8 was considerably
faster, and even beat me in the corners( it should, with a well race
developed suspension!) The SSA V6 was 4 or 5 seconds slower, but in its
defence it had the stock suspension, so even though it boasted about 190 hp,
the handleing wouldn't let it really run. I am making a broad assumption
that on a short track, I could also outrun a regular mustang V8, but I would
get beated at a long track like Road America. Of course a lot of this would
depend on the nut behind the wheel....

Subject: Heat related start problems

To anyone who has solved this before -

I'm having a problem with starter / ignition system which
has some odd behavior. First, I read the note on the hot '77
restart problem and I think mine is different. The car is a 
'78 911SC and it will not turn over (not even click) when the 
car is hot. It has always started when it's cold and also seems
(by experimentation) to start right after being turned off
when hot. In the time it takes to fill the gas tank it 
will refuse to turn over (same as a DEAD battery). Defining hot
is still in the experimental stage, but using the factory gauge
anything mid-range and above will repeat this phenomenon.

This first happened on vacation, so I pulled into a dealer and
had it 'fixed'. The new starter imitates the old one perfectly.

I also checked with two other people who have SC's but different 
years. Both have experienced the same problem with no solution, 
their problem seems to be more intermittent than the one I'm having.
A suggestion has been made that it might be the heat from the engine
roasting the starter solenoid which either swells and won't move or
some contact set seperates. I've also been told the ground strap
might be the cause, but I would think I'd see a charging light
problem if that were the case.

I'd really like to hear from someone who has had this happen before
I go digging into the car, or give up and visit a dealer again. If
you have a clue, I know of three people who will listen. 

Thanks ahead of time for any help!

        These cars are aren't meant to be sophisticated, they're meant to
be fast.  Further,
at around $23K, they offer *huge* value for the money, assuming of course
you want
a very fast car to stand on for a couple of years.  A friend of mine has
one, and I can't
keep up in my 911.  Sure, my car maybe is as fast as his, but me in my car
is not as
fast as Vinnie is his car.

        You want sophistication?  Buy a Porsche, at around 3 times the
price.  Sure, the
Porsche will be worth far more in 5 years.  But at basic bang for buck,
these cars are
at the top of their pyramid.  It's called market focus, and GM finally
seems to be doing
something right.

I just went through this, new starter and all. What finally fixed it was a 
small relay and wiring harness I got from Zim's. I still don't know exactly 
what the problem was but I think that the wire from the ignition switch to 
the starter developes resistance with age. The relay kit took me 5 minutes 
to install and the problem was cured immediately. (Zim's phone number is 
800-356-2964)

Gabriel,
I just made this fix to my 73.  The height of both the clutch and brake
pedals can be adjusted.  And I took care of the accelerator pedal by screwing
on top a new (second) pedal.  The brake and gas are now easily reachable for
heel-and-toeing, and the clutch is at a height near the footrest plate so I
can just swivel by the heel.  What an amazing difference!  (I wish I could
claim credit but a Porsche body shop pointed the way...)

     To all "Tacho-philes
     
     Among other reasons for the tachometer "bobbing" is because the 
     magnetic damper is "kaput".  I don't know how to describe it exactly, 
     but VDO uses a magnet to dampen the needle action.  I think it 
     probably some cheap platic magnet.  In any event, the fix is to send

For what it's worth, my '75 with the 1.8 and L-Jetronic has the 
standard 914 bouncy tach, and the other '75 w/1.8 that I've had close 
exposure to (though it was a long time ago) had a bouncy tach, as

I've had the points changed twice since I've had the car, with no 
change in the bobbing at all. I've just always assumed that "that's

Subject: asking for advice on building a competition 914.


Fellow P-philers,
I am humbly asking for advice about how to go about building a 914 for auto-x
and other club-type competitions.  You are probably saying "that depends on
which 'other' competitions you are talking about." Well, I am not sure. You
see, I have only been to one amateur event in my life.  It was a Memorial Day
auto-x put on by a local sports car club. I saw a small three-line plug in 
the local paper and was shocked; I didn't even know there was a local club!

Four years ago at age 20 I bought my first Porsche, a '72 914 1.7. I told
myself that I would start at the bottom of the Porsche ladder and work my
way up over the years until I attained my dream Porsche (which changes with
each new model year!) Well, a big chunk of my heart now belongs to the 914
no matter what any of the snob-segment of our fellow P-nuts ever say.

Ramblings aside, I want to build a 914 for competition. Here are the
parameters:

           1. It must be street-legal, and at least marginaly street-drivable
           2. harsh ride is acceptable
           3. body mods are acceptable (to lighten and/or accomodate tires)
           4. anything else goes (well, anything but a chevy engine!)

Questions I have:

           1. If I do the project a little at a time, what things should I
              do first (shocks,sway-bars,springs/t-bars,chassis stiffening,
              engine, etc.)?
           2. Everybody is saying the 901 trany is weak. Is it hard to swap
              in a modified 915? Is the linkage hard to rig?(I saw one for
              915's in 914's in "Exellence" for over $1K. OUCH!!!
           3. How much power can you wring out of a type-IV ?
           4. What mods specific to 914's are allowed in the different
              competition categories? What category should I shoot for?
           5. Are there any publications you recomend that would be helpful?
           

I am requesting this advice since I know that many of you have experience
preparing cars for competition. I am sure that there are more wrong ways
than right ways to do it, and I am hoping you will help me sort out the 
things that will help me win from the stuff that I don't need. Then me and 
my new 914 will go to driving school to learn how to propperly late-apex and
such!

                                thanks guys!

I would disagree with you on many counts here.  I find the interiors of 
Porsche's the epitome of understated elegance, and if the leather 
interior of yours was hard, either you got a bad batch or the leather 
wasn't looked after very carefully by the previous owner.  Mine has 
received Hide Food regularly since new and is as soft as a baby's bottom. 

As far as the luxury tax and gas guzzler tax, the simplest solution is to 
buy a car that is a few months old -- traded back in by someone who 
decided a Porsche wasn't for them (either that, or their wife divorced 
them over the car, leaving them financially ruined) -- you avoid both 
taxes, reduce the price by 20%, and still get a very new car.

Finally, I have found that Porsches, *** WHEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED ***, 
will run almost forever without major failure.  If you call routine oil 
changes and 15,000 mile service intervals unreliable, I beg to differ.

Hi G.E.,

In order to arrange a factory tour you need to call PCNA at 1-800-443-0340
or (702) 348-3109.  They will send a telex the factory and confirm your
date and time via letter.

The tour is really great.  I took it in Dec. 1991, WELL worth the effort.
Watch out for the forklift drivers ... they will run you down.

Since you are doing to go through southern Germany, you will definately
want to go to Munich and Garmische (sp?).  There is a small peninsula on
Lake Constance called Lindau.  Very cool place.  Settled by the Romans
in 13 B.C. if my memory serves me correctly.

Hope this helps,

Subject: 914 Owners Association Reunion:  Post-game report

 Greetings P-Philes,
 
 I made the two hour trek down to Palm Springs (on the motorcycle, wearing black 
 leathers in 110 degree heat) for the 914 OA reunion.  All in all there were 
 around, oh... I'd say 20-25 cars entered in the car show part and I also 
 spotted a few back out at the hotel.  The show started around 0800 and went 
 until around 1030 (I got there at 0930). I have to admit I was a bit 
 disappointed as to the number of cars but most were in pretty good condition 
 and there were quite a few 914/6's.  Only a select few of the cars were 
 anywhere near being stock, practically all had funky upholstery, different 
 wheels (both road and steering), stuff painted that should not be, blah. blah, 
 blah.  The best looking cars were (1) P-Phile's own Mike Willis' brown car, 
 complete with restored fuchs that made me quite jealous (mine look like they 
 have been through an acid bath!) and (2) Roy Juan's (PCA-Grand Prix or Orange 
 Coast) modified 73 (neat paint job, 6-cyl, fiberglass flares, etc.)  Anyway, on 
 seeing all the cool cars, my first instinct was to hop right back on the bike 
 and ride home so I could start working on mine. And actually, that's about what 
 I did because there wasn't really much to do after that.  Just a tour of the 
 stars homes (big yawn -- I decided to pass...) and the dinner and then a tech 
 session I guess on Sunday.  I paid my money to Dennis as I was leaving -- a 
 little steep for just a car show, but hopefully next time there will be more 
 events, driving competitions, organized trips/cruises downtown, stuff like 
 that.  (I hope Dennis is listening....)
 
 Extra special thanks to Mike Willis for "showing the new guy around" and for 
 driving me to lunch in his very nice car.  It is nice to know at least one 
 person when you go somewhere like that and Mike made me feel like part of the 
 group.  Definitely a nice guy.
 
 Summary:  Good way to spend a free day; wish there was more car-oriented stuff 
 to do; Mike is cool. That's my report!

Subject: re : bouncing 914 tach

Hi,

I have been waiting for someone else to point this out but
nobody did so here it is :

I had the same problem 15 years ago on my first Porsche,
a '73 914/1.7 . I pulled out the tach (easy) and noticed a small
screw on the back. This screw adjusted the damping tension,
and by turning it a bit I was able to get it too tight, then
tried again and the bounce was almost gone.

I don't remember exactly where or what it looked like, but
you should be able to figure it out if I could when I was 19.

Subject: International driver's license

Hi Nathan and everyone else,

You don't need to get an international driver's license to legally drive in
Europe.  People holding American licenses have a year to get a new license. 

I wish I had gotten my license when I first lived in Germany in 1991-92. I
went back 2 years later and tried to get one and was told that I would have
to follow the arduous and expensive (about $1500-$2000) German driving school
program. Apparently, so many Eastern Europeans had moved to Germany, bought
120mph cars (in place of their 60mph top speed Trabants, Skodas and Ladas)and
wrecked them that the German authorities had to stop giving out German
licenses to anybody who had a foriegn one.

Too bad. Here in Miami, it would be great to pull out a German license when
pulled over and say "Gibt es ein Problem Herr Polizist?" I would then get a
police escort to wherever I wanted to go- wouldn't want to offend another
German tourist.

Having just performed such an operation this evening(will finish tomorrow),
I can give you what I recall(I had to trace my hardness to the brain
connector to determine what went where...)

The GN/RD wire is does indeed connection to the oil pressure idiot light
sender.  The wire that connections to the aux. air valve is *not* white
and not part of the fuel injection brain harness.  My wire to the aux. air
valve went directly to the relay box and not the FI brain.

Now, the white wires(as there are several):

3 white, male connectors, two wires each, out from harness in between the
connectors for injectors #3 & #4 - those ground to the 3 pronged terminal
on the case(you did put is back didn't you?).  In this area will also be
the two-holed, female connector for the intake air temperature sensor.

One of the white wires goes to cylinder head temperature sender - it is
immediately after the #3 & #4 injector connectors.

In the center of the harness there will be a group consisting of a 3-hole, 
female connector, 2-hole female connector, and a single wire female spade 
end. The 3-hole connector is for the distributor trigger points(obviously). 
The 2-hole is for the cold start value on the front of the intake air 
distributor.  The final lone wire in that area connects to the thermo-time 
switch on the engine block below said air distributor.  

You can verify the thermo-time switch wire before connecting it, as it will 
be connected(wired)  the hardness to one of the poles of the cold start value 
connector.  The switch provides a ground to the cold start valve when the 
engine is cold - I don't know for how long.

Hey Dave, we should be starting our cars up about the same time!

p.s. Anyone have a deceleration valve(3 vaccuum connections - pneumatic) 
for a 1.7L engine laying around?  Can I just bypass it in the meantime
by looping the vaccuum lines?  I can't see why not as they were removed 
from later engines.

Subject: '87 924S A/C Performance Ques.

Gentleman!

My '87 924S with the old style interior (similiar to older '83-'85/1 944's)
seems to have marginal A/C performance.

The compressor seems to click off before it is cool enough in the interior.
 I recently had a new compressor installed along with the system recharged
and leak tested, so I think enough freon is in the system.

One other note, the heat is "stuck" on due to a bad water control valve
cable, could this be causing the poor performance? (i.e warm air mixing w/
ice cold creating luke cold air?)  I have not had a chance to manually close
the water valve and see it's effect.  Or is it the interior thermostat? Any
thoughts?

Are other 924S-944/1 owners satisfied with the A/C system performance or are
these earlier systems just kinda weak (I'm aiming for GM style A/C
performance!)

Thanks in advance

Subject: re: Porsche wallops Corvette/Camaro's

Hi all -

The final results are now processed.  Porsche has taken home the honors as
predicted this morning after the Porsche - Corvette/Camaro Challenge this
weekend. 

With contenders in 17 classes, Porsche took home 12 (can you say twelve 
Ken) to Corvette/Camaro's 5 (*only five, what happened Mr. Mitchell?).  
If you go deeper, both sides scored 6 second places and 4 third places.  
Meanwhile Porsches numbers took home another 5 fourths and 2 fifths to 
Corvette/Camaro's 1 and 3 respectively.

If you calculate points based on complete results with first getting 20, 
second getting 16, third getting 13, fourth getting 11 (5th=9, 6th=7, 
7th=5, 8th=3, 9th=2 10th=1) it is Porsche 497 points to Corvette/Camaro's 
293 points.  Trying to help the Corvette/Camaro people out, I tried just 
doing points based on first and second places only.  Still Porsche stays 
way ahead with 336 points to corvette/Camaro's 196 points.  Anyway I cut 
it it comes up with PORSCHE DOMINANCE (sorry Ken, maybe next year..NOT).

Porsche did have a few more cars than the Corvette/Camaro contingent (36
to 20).  Maybe next year we can drag a few more Corvette/Camaro's out to
the event.  Rumor has it that Crown Chevrolet in Dublin is going to
sponsor the site and trophies next year so that should help draw a bigger
Chevy crowd.  Then again, maybe PCNA is interested in getting into the 
action or one of the other local dealerships to match Crown and draw more 
Porsches.  Who knows?  I will be looking forward to it though either way.

After all runs were taken, we had a challenge for all the first place
winners that had stuck around.  A few had already left, but with ten men
and five women, we paired everyone off randomly and each person in the
pair had another run.  Similar to a run-off, the idea was to continue to
run an equal time to your dial-in (your 1st place time).  The person in
each pair with the best difference (quicker time) advanced to the next
round (i.e. if your competitor turned a time faster than his dial-in by .1
and you had a slower time, you were out, but if your time was faster than
your dial-in by .2 then you advanced). This is different than a drag strip
becuase there if you break-out (beat your dial-in time) your out.  But in
this case, if you did better your dial-in time, we multiplied your
difference by 2 and subtracted it from your previous dial-in; thus a new
dial-in much quicker than you had ever run.  This was known ahead of time
so sand bagging was out.  Ladies quickly got down to the final two with
Tricia Braun beating Mary Ann Behrens and Nikki Duncan beating Teresa
Lommatzsch.  Then Tricia did away with Mary Ann for the Ladies Challenge
win.  In the mens class, Richard Antoine, Bob Ikeda, Jay Dugan, Dwight
Mitchell and Mike Lommatzsch won their first rounds.  Out in the first
round were Ken Mitchell, David Blanchard, Mike Joliffe, Ken Yeo and Larry
Sharp.  Then with an odd number of drivers, each took another run and the
top two competited for the challenge.  Dwight Mitchell broke out big with

Subject: Jacobs Wires unt uh

Sean

I recommend you stick with the stock wires on you 912.  If they're
in good condition they'll take about as much juice as you care to
pump through them.  I have an Allison electronic ignition conversion
on my 050 with stock wires and have no problem with shorts or
radio interference even at the higher voltage.

If you still insist on aftermarket "super wire" be sure it will accomodate
the original Beru plug boots.  You need to maintain the air seal in the
sheet metal at the plug penetration to keep that cooling air where it
belongs (i.e. cooling the engine, not heating up the engine compartment).
This was a common problem with under-informed VW owners and
I've seen lots of scorched engines because of it.

Additionally, the original boots extend past the sheet metal far enough
so you can actually get a hold on em to remove them.  Trying to remove
a VW type boot that's got a good grip on the plug is cause for some
interesting contortions and lots of fancy language!  (I'll bet you can
figure out how I know this.)

The last time I checked, Stoddards was selling *complete* wire sets
for less than the price of the boots alone.  Go figure.  Whenever I feel
the urge to replace wires, I just cut some new wire, crimp on new
distributor terminal ends, and screw my old boots in the other end.
The boots themselves seldom fail unless they've been seriously
overheated (another reason, if you need one, for the boot seals).
Saves me $$$ and I can customize the length to dress them out more
elegantly.

Is there any particular reason you want to go to different wire?
(cross firing? RFI?)  If you come up with something better, be
sure to let us know.  I'm always willing to experiment (with someone
else's car).

Subject: Re: 1983 944 vs. 1995 Mustang (long)

Hunter Heath wrote that he happened to be "hanging" around a Ford dealership
and got a ride/drive that allowed some comparisons with his 944.

>From being in the automobile business in past years (including Utah), I'd
like to put a different "twist" on this drive/ride.  (I sure Hunter wouldn't
do any of this).  I'll term it "Freeloaders and Drugstore Cowboys".

An automobile dealership is in business to make money.  It's generally a
battle to fight overhead and reduce costs in all departments along with
trying to increase or maintain sales.  When someone who has no interest in a
car (other than curosity to see if what R/T, C&D, Autoweek, etc said is
"right") who convinces a friend/acquaintance/salesman to go for a drive to
"see what it'll do", it increases the cost of doing business for everyone.
 Yes, a big part of the business is "qualifying" customers.  But when a
"Drugstore Cowboy/Dale Earnhart/Mario Andretti Imitator" takes a friend out
for a joyride, that car is still for sale to some "less than lucky???" buyer.
 When a salesman comes in and says "You know the Blue GT (or Cobra, or 968,
or C-36, or Z-28) we got in last week?  It's got the right front alloy wheel
and apron bent!  How did that happen?

Who pays?  Not the factory...the dealer to start with, a "good" salesman with
wife and kids who loses a sale on a particular car,  and ultimately (if the
damage is not "apparent" immediately) some unlucky customer.  The cost of
business goes up and you all pay when you buy your next (whatever).  Would
you want your new Silver C4to have been run that way?  The reaction to this
can get ridiculous (locking the doors in the showroom or requiring a "test
drive deposit" before you can even drive one).

Rarely happens you say!!  I still remember the call when I was in New Mexico
"...your F150 broke down on me"  (6 hours after the "test drive" round the
block).  The wrecker found it on the highway from El Paso (had been to
Juarez) with a 6000 load of cider blocks in the back and a broken axle!

Again, I'm not inferring Hunter or anyone else on this list would "abuse" a
vehicle during a non-interested test drive, nor do I believe you should buy a
car (or any product) without trying it out.  Flame away to your hearts
content!

and made it go faster....  It had a lot of rust, though, and it took us
about a year to get it all back together and driveable again.  The very
first time we took it out for a spin, we were happily whizzing (OK,
actually kind of a dull roar) down the road, when a little mouse pokes
his head above the hood (there's about a 1" gap between the hood and the
windshield...  kinda like older cars with hidden wipers.  But it doesn't
have hidden wipers.  Don't ask me why.)  Aforementioned mouse
immediately is slammed up against the winshield by 60 MPH breeze, holds
onto windshield wiper, shakes furry little head in puzzlement, and is
immediately whisked off to oblivion.  Repeat about three or four times.
    I'd like to think the little buggers actually survived their short

kinda cute.  Just don't try to live in my p-car....

What's the best way to clean the battery tray from acid and rust and to

I bought a can of h2so4 battery cleaner and tried it on the hold down

neutralizes any acid. Then you wash it off with water and repeat until
the spray does not turn pink.

I was planning on using this to clean the tray, use a wire brush to

Subject:  Re: 1983 944 vs. 1995 Mustang

A minor counterpoint for Perry:

Surveys of customers have shown that most buyers test-drive ONLY the model
they end up buying.  I've done this myself.

I've been forcing myself to go into dealerships and test-drive various
makes and models (see my note on the "Wisdom on 2nd car" thread).  I've
found that an actual drive has been VERY revealing and truely the only
way to really comparison shop for a car.

For example, one model that I've had several friend recommend to me
(including my wife), it looked promising but I found I absolutely HATED
it on the road compared to others I've tried.  I've also found that the
brand I _thought_ I was going to buy is no longer even in the running.  


What seems to be working is that I'll drive "promsing" cars to determine
if its worth investigating further as a serious "short list" contender.
The final short list gets a 2nd test drive that will be more focused on
observed differences between models and so forth...preferably all the
competitors on the same day, same road.

BUT...

I know these test drives cost the dealership money and I don't like to
test drive ANY car unless I'm "really serious" about buying, but I'm not
going to comprimise the road tests I do because I feel guilty about it.
Afterall, that's what we DID do in the past (and bought a Ford ;-).

While I think you'll agree that I'm not joyriding in this circumstance,
what I've found that I don't like that the business of "qualifying"
customers FORCES both me and the salesmen to invest more time than's
otherwise necessary for what could be a quick dealership visit by an
informed and serious customer doing research.  If you have any suggestions
on how I can streamline this part of the process, I'd appreciate it.

I have been using plain old baking soda for years. It is cheap and has
been THE solution for neutralizing acid.  Simply spray the area to
be cleaned with water and sprinkle baking soda liberally on the area.
I let it sit for half an hour or so and then rinse with a heavy stream of
clear water. Let it dry, wire brush to remove loose rust. Once dry
apply a good rust inhibitor paint. Then buy a good quality SEALED
battery. I repeat the cleaning process each fall as part of the
pre-winter prep work. Have NEVER had to repaint the battery tray a
second time.

for a short test drive, find a car rental agency that rents the one that you 
are
considering and rent it for the weekend. Can be somewhat expensive but you
will get the chance to run the car hard and really get a sense of what the 
car
is like. This has changed my mind a couple of times on decisions to purchase
a particular piece of Detroit Tin.

Subject: 914 competition

The first thing you do is to figure out "how competitive do I want to be?"
and secondly "which playground do I want to play in?"

If the object is to improve the car's performance to its highest potential,
then money's is the limit.  If the point is to see if you can get better
(slowly), then invest in seat time and incremental changes.  If you are the
competitive type and want to win trophies, then buy the rule book for SCCA
or PCA and stay within those rules.  I do know that the 914 is very
competitive in the stock classes (C stock and D stock).  Several national
champions have come from the rank of 914 drivers.  Once you go up to Street
Prepared class, the car is not competitive, and I am aware of few Prepared
cars that have been successful.  So if you want to play in SCCA, get a rule
book and stick to the stock class.  Spend money on tires and suspension
components.

PCA is a different matter.  Some regions are less strict and group cars by
models (all 914's run together for trophy, or all air cooled cars run
together).  Parade rules govern national or Zone competition.  The good
thing is that you will be running against similar cars (not against Honda
Civics and Mazda RX 7's as in SCCA).  The trick is don't make minor
modifications which will bump you up a class, but if you want to play in a
higher class, do all the modifications allowed.

Personally, I would take the go slow method.  That way, what you learn will
be learned well and your driving skill will develop with the improvement in
the car.  If you do everything at once, you may soon want to move on to
another car, and another, and another. . .

If you'd like to know what I did over the years with my 914, send me a note.
To do everything at once will probably cost you more than what you have in
the car.  Racing is expensive and it costs several hundreds of dollars to go
a few seconds faster once the basic improvements are done.

Trond,

The car was NOT an '88 version of the '73 Carrera RS. It weighed 2700 lbs.,
had the same horsepower rating as a standard '88 Carrera (it did rev a
little bit higher because the valves were lighter), and it had its own
unique paint job. Actually, it had a regular paint job with special decals
on the front left fender (I think it was left) and the rear deck lid. The
car was NOT special in any way except in the limited number.

  Theoretically, less back pressure should produce more HP at least at high
  RPM.  However, the beautiful stainless steel Monte muffler I purchased
  for my '73 911S gave me a BIG flat spot between 3500-4500 RPM, it now

  am currently running a stock muffler that has been "opened up" by
  removing about 50% of the internal baffles.  It's louder (though not
  nearly as loud as a Sport muffler) & with the air cleaner removed I have
  a "seat of the pants" indication of more power.

  The old style heat exhangers (or SSIs) with a stock muffler perform
  pretty darn good on a stock motor, so BEWARE of HP claims with fancy
  mufflers, I learned the hard way.

I too was having problems heel and toeing.  I had my belts done on the 944
and asked the proprieter about my problem reaching the gas pedal.

His name is Leighton Reese, and is an awesome roadracer.  Runs select ASA
events, came in second three times in a row at Brainerd.  Went to
ELF-Winfield school in France some years back and cleaned up.  Runs a very
nice garage now.

Anyways, he says, "How much did you spend?" I said, "200 bucks."  He
says,"That's enough."  He was in the middle of building the ASA racer in the
garage.  He grabs a scrap piece of sheet alluminum, cuts it to about 3.0" X
5.0", drills three holes in it evenly spaced along the right side, drills
corresponding holes along the left side of the gas pedal, and rivets the
piece to the pedal.

Now I heel and toe at every corner I come to!.  I find it difficult to drive
anything with standard shift w/out heel and toeing.

                  Cash-Generating-Devices, Inc. 
	            in a new partnership with
			Microsoft, Inc.

	           ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF THE

               Sparko-Turbo-Distributor-Driveshaft
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cash-Generating-Devices, a Seattle-based automotive research and development
has partnered with Microsoft, Inc. to produce the ultimate in distributor 
drive shaft technology.

In their unprecendented forray into the aftermarket auto parts industry, 
Microsoft chairman William Gates has stated:

"I **LOVE** this new product.  It's the perfect new direction for Microsoft.
As many know, I own many performance automobiles, and using our new Sparko-
Turbo shaft in my 959 has put the "P" back in performance!  I really noticed
the difference during my monthly laps around the inside of the warehouse!"

Microsoft plans on providing windows-based software to electronically 
calibrate and configure their new distributor driveshaft in future releases. 
The software may even be bundled with upcoming releases of Windows95.

Cash-Generating-Devices spent 3 years and 3 million dollars to develop the
ultimate distributor driveshaft.  Their patented, hydraulic design compensates 
for driveshaft wear thereby eliminating dwell-angle variance in conventional 
point-type ignition systems.  CGD claims, "It's the only distributor 
driveshaft you'll ever need!"

Independant labratory testing has shown an average 33% increase in overall
horsepower output when used with a Bosch 009 distributor.  Torque and
gas mileage have also been shown to be significantly improved.  CGD also
states that when used in conjunction with "Splitfire" sparkplus and their
special plug wires that a 50% increase in horsepower can be obtained!

Bosch, a German-based automobile parts manufacturer, refused to comment.

The Sparko-Turbo-Distributor-Driveshaft is initially offered at the MSRP
of $99.95.  A peak-performance version, which includes the aforementioned
"Splitfire" plugs and CGD's special plug wires is also available for $149.00.

CGD can be reached at (800) 555 2200.

I had the same experience in my '73 911S. When I bought the car last 
August it had a Bursch muffler that caused a hesitation of some sort 
between 3000-4000 rpm. After several seconds, it seemed as if the engine 
overcame the backpressure and then rocketed towards the redline. I was 
lucky in that I was able to find a used factory muffler locally, in very 
good shape I might add. It made a tremdous difference- no more flat spot.
YMMV- it seems as if the early engines are very tempermental to exhaust 
changes. I should also add that I unfortunately have carbs.

P.S. I have a Bursch muffler for sale if anybody wants to give a try. 
Maybe it will work on a 911t since the engine places less demand on the 
whole system or something like that.

Subject: Porsche Autocross information - part6 : Tires

Hi,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the sixth of nine(?) columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

There have been several requests for permission to use this material
in PCA newsletters, etc. Please ask before using it, but basically
any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted. If not too
difficult, I would like a copy of the publication with my material.

	Three-Wheeling by Mike Piera Part 6 of ?

	Setting up a Porsche for stock class autocrossing : Tires

	Of all the modifications that can be made to make a killer
stock class autocrosser, tires give the greatest improvement over
factory equipment. Street tires are designed with tread life
as one of the top priorities, whereas autocross tires are
designed strictly for performance. There are only a few special
purpose street-legal autocross tires on the market : BFG Comp TA R-1,
Yokohama A008 RS-II, and Hoosier Autocrosser. Nearly all serious
autocrossers use one of these tires. There are a few newcomers who
make very soft performance tires such as Toyo which may be 
competitive. Goodyear and Bridgestone make good tires for road
racing, but they do not currently have autocross-specific tires. 

	In '94 the BFG tire was available in two versions, 
Competition (230) and autocrossing (226) but the 226 was discontinued
in '95 as the 230 seemed fast enough. The 230 was designed mostly for
road racing, but is also good for autocrossing, especially long 
courses or pro-solos where your tires get warm. The Yokohama is also
available in a road racing version (RS) and autocross (RS-II). Even
the Hoosier has a road-racing version, called the Street TD. The
difference between the two versions of these three brands is
basically the tread compound. The autocross version is generally
softer and designed to work best at lower temperatures (there is no
warm-up lap in autocrossing). The tradeoff of the autocross tires'
great performance is that they wear out much faster. For occasional
autocrossers, or those who also want to use their competition tires
on the track, the road racing compound can be used for autocrossing. 
These include the Goodyear, Bridgestone, Toyo, and Hoosier street TD.
The road racing tire will be slightly slower on most autocross courses.
In 1995, the BFG 230 "competition" tire is still winning most classes
in the big events, so may be the best compromize.

	The Hoosier is in a class by itself because it is a bias-ply
tire, not a radial. The handling characteristics are quite different,
and the Hoosier was not legal in SCCA stock classes even though it
was "street-legal", until 1995. In general terms, the Hoosier is not
as quick to respond to driver input, but will not lose traction as 
quickly as the radials. The bias ply tires work with a greater slip
angle than the radials. This means you must drive with more effort,
and allow the car to slide more than on radials. You can drive as
much with your feet as with your hands. This suits some driving styles
better than others. Tire pressures are low and tire roll-over is
greater than radials. Hoosiers are generally better suited to cars 
with a higher level of modification than a stock class car. These
tires can be faster than radials, but they are an aquired taste. If
you are serious, try a set and see for yourself. Hoosier is also
making a radial street-legal autocross tire, but it probably will
not be legal until 1996. This tire has a super-aggressive tread
pattern, almost a slick! There are only one or two grooves.

	The BFG R1 has a very stiff inner sidewall and a tread 
pattern similar in concept to the Yokohama, with an outer tread
area which will become a slick after use or shaving. The outside edge
is very square, but does not roll over even at very low pressures.
These tires work well at lower pressures than previous autocross
tires. Try pressures in the low 30's or even lower. Pressures are a
personal choice depending on your car setup and driving style, there	
is really no "ideal" pressure. A higher pressure will give quicker
response, but a lower pressure may give more cornering speed
in a constant corner. For the truly serious competitor who
needs immediate performance, tires should be shaved on a tire
shaving machine. New full-tread autocross tires handle poorly until
they are worn in. The Hoosiers are an exception and work well
after a few "scrub-in" runs. The BFG may actually last longer if
shaved due to less "scalloping" of the outer area, and less uneven
wear to the middle block, which causes the tread groove to wear to
the cord while the rest of the tire is still fine. The 230 is
better than the 226 in this respect (maybe why the 226 was dropped).
This is known as the "groove of doom" in the autocross community.

	After selecting a tire, the size must be chosen. Basically you
want the lowest profile tire in the widest size that will fit on your
rim properly. Also consider the rules, as PCA parade rules have silly
minimum circumference rules. I was able to get around the PCA rules
and still run a 50 series tire by squeezing a 225/50/15 on my 6"
rims in '91 (not recommended, but it worked!). For '94 I got a set
of 7" rims for the 225/50/15. This was legal, while my normal
205/50/15 on 6" rims were not. A standard 911/944 7" rim will fit on 
the front of most 911's, but a pre-78 911 may need the 911R offset to 
fit 7" rims on the rear. Revolution makes a wheel for this application. 

	Before spending lots of money on new tires, make sure you have
the widest rim that is legal for the class you are running. 
Also a smaller diameter rim is better because it will effectively
change your final drive ratio and lower the car if a smaller diameter
tire can be used. For example, several Porsche models such as the 911 SC,
Carrera, and 944 can choose between 15" and 16" rims. The 15" rim with 
50 series tires would be the best choice unless the width is less. A 
911 Carrera with 7" and 8" wide 15" wheels with 50 series tires should
be faster than 16" tires of the same width in an autocross.

	Here are some common Porsche rim sizes and tires. For the 914,
the 5 1/2" x 15" forged Fuchs alloy is best, with 195 or 205/50/15
tires. The 195 will really help acceleration and lower the car,
although the 205 has been more popular. Even with my heavier and
much more powerful 911S on 6" wide rims, I had one of my best events
ever on 195/50/15 Yokohamas, giving Roger Johnson's Corvette one of
his few losses at a Pro-Solo. For the early 911 or other Porsches
with 6" x 15" rims, the 205/50/15 is probably best. This tire will
also work very well on a 7" wide rim if a 225/50/15 tire will not
fit under the car's fenders (an early 911 with 7" wide rear rims).
The 225/50 fits well on 7" and 8" rims. But on a powerful 911, 
245/50/15 tires will work great on the 8" rears. These recommendations
generally apply to 16" rims also, but 45 series tires are available 
which are even better. In 17 inch rims, the new BFG 235/40/17 is
great for the narrow 7" fronts on late model 911s. The tire 
companies have "recommended rim widths" for their tires which will 
also help, and they can tell you what sizes successful 
autocrossers are currently using. The BFG tires seem to work OK
on narrower rims than you would think, so if you are stuck with 
narrow rims they may help.
	
	The Yokohama tires can be ordered from most tire dealers. Call
Kevin Rogers at Yokohama in California at (800) 423-4544 X-3862 for
technical questions. BFG tires are ordered direct from Team T/A,
although there are a few "team T/A" dealers who can get them for you.
Call (800) RACE BFG to join team TA. You will get their informative
newsletter and can find out how to order tires.

Well I was hoping for more of our hotshoes would have come out
such as Ruby Ruperto (CP), Ron Green (CP), Bill Herron (ESP), Don
McKenna (SS), Jim Martin (SS), Manny Pretty (BSP), Ed Rainey
(BSP), Don Mc Williams (BSP), Brett Egen (BSP), Brian & Steve
Hobaugh (BSP), and Ren Marinus (SS). 

Also, I was looking forward to see some of the PCA-Zone 7
hotshoes make the event such as LLoyd & Patti De Martini, Tom &
Sandi Provasi, Terry Zacconi, Greg Peart, Larry Wilson, Ray
Scruggs, The Neidels, Ed & Marsha Wilson, Steve Nieslony (sp),
and Bill & Rebecca Newlin.

Maybe next time both teams can do a better job in promoting the
event. Its possible that some of the Team Chevrolet drivers
didn't come out because they figured that the course would be a
small tight course. Hopefully, once the word gets around that Bud
Behrens, Team Porsche, designed a bitch'n course maybe next time
they'll come out. (Mary-Anne Behrens, Team Porsche, will think
she's died and gone to heaven with all the V8's roaring.)

Porsche Dominance - In my opinion, was done by the numbers of
Porsche entrants vs. the number of Chevrolet entrants. The
structuring of the classes is probably the best it can be to make
it competitive. However, I think Scott Winder's car is prepared
like an ASP car just as Dwight's is. I'm not sniveling, just
pointing out that if its a true ASP car it should not have run
against the stock Corvettes. Maybe Scott classed his car wrong.

I really feel that the objective of this event, having lots of
fun, was definitely met. We need to do this again and since Team
Porsche did buy the beer I'm sure that Team Chevrolet will be
reciprocal and bring the beer next time.

Lets Race and have fun!!!!!

It may well be that 200 or so were made and only 26 got sold.  The thing
stiffed absolutely in the market.  Basically what Porsche did was a minor
decontent of their regular street car, slap a decal on the fender, and
bump the price.  To quote my daughter, Doi!

So they licked their wounds, went away, and a few years later came back
(to the US market) with the RS America.  And got it right.

Personally, I wouldn't touch the '88 with a ten meter pole, esp. one
which hasn't been driven and which is being offered at a premium.

Subject: 928 Shocks - Konis or Bilsteins?

I have an 82 928 which needs new shocks.  I have the original Boges on it,
but they are tired shocks.  I know about the different hardware to adapt
Bilsteins to Boge struts.  I have heard that Bilsteins require a change in
springs because the shock makes the car ride around 1 to 1.5 inches higher
than normal.  I also know that the Konis on their softest setting are a
little stiffer than the Boges.  If you have changed shocks to either
Bilsteins or Konis,  please let me know of your results.

Thank you,
Tom Warren

Subject: 928 Speedo Swapout

My '82 928 has the 85MPH speedometer.  Boy, what a great idea that was!  Upon
looking through the latest Panorama,  I saw Imparts is having a clearance on
170MPH speedometers.  Does anyone know if the 170MPH speedometer simply plugs
in with no modifications.  I know the speedometer is electronic so it seems
like no recalibration would be necessary.

Thanks,

Subject: 911 steering rack for sale

I have a steering rack for sale if anyone is interested.  I had a catch in
my steering and my mechanic told me that it was probably the rack.  I got a
used one from Oklahoma Foreign Porsche (is that what it's called?) and it
turned out to only be a catch in the column lock.  Anyway...I have the rack
and I don't need it.  I think it's from an 85 or 86...not sure.  It's
supposed to fit all 911's (non turbo) from 1965-1989...I'm not totally sure
but the racks for sale in my Automotion catalog say that they have one part
for those years so I assume that it'll work.  It also has the same part
number for a 914 from 1970-1976 so I guess it would work for 914's too.
Drop me a line if you're interested.

Subject: RE: 914 Reunion

In response to Tim Radsicks evaluation of the 10th 914 Reunion, there is 
another side of the story.  Tim did not pre-register for the Reunion, and 
dropped in Saturday morning to see the car show.  He had missed the Friday 
night activities by then.  In the afternoon, following the car show, he 
came to the hotel and said he would like to register prior to leaving.  I 
want to make it clear that he was not asked to register and did not have 
to if he only came to see the cars.  After paying his fees, he received an 
embroidered 914 hat, an event pin, an event t-shirt, and an information 
pack - I dont think he mentioned those items when he talked about cost.  
He told me that he had a great time and enjoyed seeing the cars - are you 
listening Tim?  I asssumed he liked modified cars as he told me about a 
center speaker he installed on his car and that he would send details for 
a future newsletter.  At no time did he mention that he was anything but 
pleased about his visit.  By leaving Saturday afternoon, he missed the 
awards dinner on Saturday and the Sunday Tech Session and social event.  I 
was further surprised to see a response to the Radsick e-mail from Tim 
Jones who asked who would want to go to Palm Springs?  Tim, Association 
members from CA, NV, AZ, TN, OK, and Germany attended.  Furthermore, 
almost 1000 members of the National Council of Corvette Clubs were holding 
their national meet at the same hotel - but for 8 days - and sharing the 
parking lot with us.  Some of their cars are 15 years older than ours and 
also dont have a/c.  I can only assume that the *real* reason Tim Jones 
did not attend was that he is *not* an Association member according to our 
current membership listing.  Gentlemen, in the future, please bring your 
complaints and innuendoes to me directly.  I really do like to hear what 
people have to say, but realize that I cant make everybody happy all the 
time.  The only thread of truth in the previous messages was that Mike 
Willis was a real plus to the 3 days of events and I want to thank him for

Again,  No flame here.  But on the flip side, a part of the 
salesman's job is to sell.  How else can that be done unless someone 
drops by and tries a car out.  It's up to the salesman to convince 
any potential buyer that what is being sold is better than what 
the prospective buyer currently has or is comparing with.  Even if 
the looker is not really interested in purchasing the car at the 
time, who knows.  Minds do change.  If the Mustang really was better, 
maybe Hunter would cancel the order on his Bimmer.

Before taking someone out for a ride, the salesman should ask 
questions like "what monthly payments are you looking for?"  Simple 
questions can tell you a lot about a buyer.  I think Hunter did the 
right thing.  If he can't test out other cars, how can he decide 
what he likes.  I'm sure his "hanging around" terminology is just an 
idiom.  No one just happens to hang around dealerships unless they 
are at least a little interested.

Subject: 914 hot start trouble

    Recently my 914 mas refused to start after a relatively short stop. At first 
I thought it was vapor lock, as it was maybe a little warmer that day than 
usual, but I'm not so sure, as it's also happened when it was relatively cool 
and the engine wasn't really even warm.
    When it happens the car will initially fire (residual fuel from the previous 
running?) and then just not even hint at firing. Once (after leaving it like 4 
hours) it started after prolonged cranking, but the other times (when I've left 
it overnight) it starts up immediately. Flooding?
    Once it's started it runs exactly as it always did (pretty good, with a 
slight hesitation off idle). The vehicle recently had it's entire fuel injection 
system checked out and the head temp sensor and f.i. points being replaced.
    It's a 1970 (1.7), btw.

Subject: RE: 914 Reunion

Dennis,

In reference to your reply to my comments about the 914 Reunion, I NEVER 
said anything like "Who would want to go to Palm Springs."  I said that 
under the conditions of driving my stock 914 through THAT particular 
stretch of I-10/110, I'd rather it be held in the Fall when the weather 
is more conducive to travel in said vehicle.  I do the Phoenix to Indio 
run quite regularly in our Jetta and was there last weekend for a wedding 
(so I couldn't break away for the reunion).  My point was simply that 
there may have been MORE attendees if the desert heat wasn't so extreme.

Believe me, no-one on this list is more appreciative of anything that you 
do to help promote the life of the 914 and its owner.  In fact, until my 
brother-in-law's wedding came up, I was hoping to get to come to the 
reunion, even if only as a spectator.

As far as Palm Springs is concerned, the entire area is beautiful.  The
wind farms out at the 110/I-10 interchange are a marvel.  The golfing is
great (the empty store fronts are starting to become a concern, though). 
But, it's just too hot for me and my yellow baby to make the run at this 
time of year.

No offence was intended (thus the <bg> <- that means BIG GRIN) after my 
comment about favorite things.  I am sorry that you felt that I was 
putting bad comments out about your event.

I'd suggest Castrol, with appropriate SAE grade for you

In my 86 951, for highway miles in 'clean' air, I usually drive 6000 mi
between oil changes.  With an extra FILTER change at 3000mi

The oil stays nice and clean at the end!!

That engine is DAMN tight at the piston/cylindar walls!!

Ken,

Yes, the event was a lot of fun and I had a great time meeting all
of the Corvette people. We all truly love our cars and love auto-
crossing!! It was great to have so many enthusiasts in one place!

Now, to the point of whether or not my car is an ASP car. When was
the last time you saw a 2900 pound 911 Targa (not a very stiff car)
with a stock 3.2 liter engine (exhaust is modified) running in ASP?
Dwight Mitchell's car weighs about 700 pounds less and has at least
as much horsepower as my car. I am sure he has modified his car in
every that is beneficial and the rules allow. I have no idea what
ASP rules allow. I suspect I've done things to my car that are not
allowed in ASP and I know I have not done all the things the rules
do allow.

And what do you mean by "stock" Corvettes? What does SS1 allow? I
can tell you that the SS1 Corvettes did not run like any stock
Corvette I have ever seen. They had a bunch more ponies than stock
and I am sure the suspension has been played with based on the
handling I saw.

Anyway, I finished 2nd in SS1 and would have finished 2nd in ASP to
Dwight Mitchell, so it had no effect on the outcome whatsoever.

No sniveling here either, just wanted to clarify...

will be my first real experience with one (spent my time mostly with BMWs). 
This 944 has 86k on it and recently had the timing belt replaced.  Besides this 
obvious task, are there any other areas that need to be checked or

I believe '89 was the first year it was offered on 911s.  The
Carrera 2 and 4 have it, but the Carrera ('84-'89?) doesn't.

>When was the first year Porsche offered ABS on any of their

It was offered as an option for 944s in '87, and became standard on
the turbo in '88.  I'm not sure when it was available on the 928.

SNIP SLICE SNIP

Hey!  I'll have you know I have been testing the beta version of this 
product on my 73 911 T.  The software interface leaves something to be 
desired, but it came with a cool windows screensaver!

I guess I'm pretty lucky, because combined with their yet-to-be announced 
toilet paper oil filter, I got a 79% increase in horsepower and torque!  And 
now I only have to change my oil every 12 years or 120,000 miles. (provided 
I keep my Micro$oft license agreement current)

Since I'm a beta tester, I got the high performance option which includes 
the aforementioned special combination plug wires/clothesline.

My complexion has even benefitted from this amazing new product!

Subject: Wiper parking and alignment

Though I rarely drive my 911 in the rain, I've been working on and off 
for the past year to get the 'park' feature on my wipers to work.  My 
first attempt was replacing the wiper motor, which involved removing 
the entire ventilation system from the trunk.  No go.  Next attempt was 
done after a tip I got from someone on p'philes about the wiper 
switch--the clue was pushing the stem of the switch forward, which 
caused the wipers to park.  I took the switch out and was able to patch 
a piece of plastic that had worn over the years, preventing the idle 
circuit from engaging.

Much to my dismay, once the park circuit was working, it appears that 
the position of the wipers relative to the wiper motor is off, so that 
the wipers park about 6" from the bottom of the windshield.  Not quite 
totally obscuring my vision, but close.

Sooo, the question is--how to I get the right alignment between the 
wiper control arms and the motor.  Since the motor is now in its 'park' 
position, changing the location of the wiper arm attachment to the 
motor should allow the wipers to have their full range but park in a 
reasonable location.  As it stands, if I change the position of the 
wiper blades, I end up removing water from the hood of the car, as the 
wiper circuit goes too far down on the windshield.

The Haynes manual is useless in this regard, so any hints would be appreciated.

The car had to be a 928. The year was probably 87, although it could have
been earlier. I know the 87 944's had ABS and DUAL airbags as options. Both
were STANDARD on the 88 944 Turbo S.

First year for ABS was 1987. I ordered it on my factory ordered 1987 944S.
Turned out to be about a $2000 option. The dealer didn't know the price when
we ordered the car and he through it would be about $1000. He ended up
splitting the difference. I had the first 944S in the Northeast, or maybe I
didn't but that is what I was told. 
The happiest day in my life was the one when I took delivery of that car. The
second happiest was when I finally sold it after suffering with it for 3
years. Or maybe I have that backwards. That was undoutably the worst Porsche
product that ever set forth in America.( can anyone think of another?) I know
I was in trouble when the steering rack puked all it's fluid on the way home
from the dealer.
 I certainly hope that others had much better luck with their 16 valve
numbers than I did. The only thing that always worked were the ABS brakes!

I do not know what rules you were using in this event, but if you were using
SCCA Solo II rules, then Scott's car is definitly in ASP. It doesn't make
any difference if the 3.2 liter engine is stock (or has had intake mods). The
3.2 did not come in your 78 911. There may be sets of rules that allow engine
swaps in stock classes, but SCCA rules do not. BTW, I have a 72 911 with a

in local and region events. I am a medicore driver at best. The Porsche/

Gee guys -

I have heard more talk about this event after it was over with then 
before it happened.  Why couldn't we have had this friendly discussion 
before and maybe raise the interest level up a few more notches leading to 
better participation.

By the way, I have done some simple PAX (don't ask me what it stands for, 
I'm not sure; it suppose to equal the cars out based on previous National 
SCCA caliber events) computations that when I have time to type them up 
will post to all.  I have taken the liberty to class everyone by the 
appropriate SCCA classes since the PAX is based on them.  Of course, this 
puts numerous 911's and 914's into Dwights class (ASP).  And the cars 
that I have put there are based on my knowledge of the car and its 
respective PCA-GGR class allowances.  Sorry, there are no PCA PAX figures 
available and then what would we do with them funny plastic cars and the 
f-body wannabees :-).

Maybe we can get this going again next about this time and it will drum 
up some more participation for both types of cars.  Maybe we should let 
the FORDS join the CHEVYS to help them out ;-).

To add to what Scott has written, there is an article on the Club Sports

Here's a few specs:

Price as tested:  $46643
Horsepower:  214
Torque :  195 lb-ft
Curb Weight :  2600 lbs
0-60 :  5.7 sec.
1/4 mile :  14.3 sec @ 99 mph

The "Club Sport" decal was on the left front fender, BTW.  They went on
to say that the DME had a "sport map" added for this particular car that,
in conjunction with the lightweight valves, gave the thing an extra 320
rpm.

Unfortunately, I don't think the article states how many were made (which

Last weekend at Mid Ohio I was using 20-24 oz. of coolant per 25 min.

 I installed a 'puke bottle' to catch the fluid.  Didn't want to upset the

I have added Redline water wetter to the system taking out the same volume of
coolant prior to the addition of the Redline product.

Air in the system

There has been some comment on the Mercedes list recently expressing concern 
about K&N filters' ability to do a good filtration job; critics aver that 
the fact that you see grit on the 'exhaust' side of dirty filters means that 
the K&N's coarser weave is letting more dirt through.

Proponents cite major engine lives for motors used in dusty conditions, just 
like K&N's marketing materials do.

Any comments from members?

I use K&Ns on my 1990 928 (58k miles, the last 14k on K&N), 300SD

We went over this pretty well last summer. Summary: less restriction is
due exclusively to less filtration. Then again, poor tolerances that leave
unsealed gaps between the filter body and the canister could also contribute
to higher air flow.

Advice: just say no.

Hi

A little while ago there was a discussion on boost pressure for 944 Turbo S.
The list experts said that the max boost was 1.8 bar. After checking my car,
I was only getting 1.5 bar. After a few mail messages with the experts, I
knew that something was wrong with my car. I was dreading the thought of
spending BIG $$$ to fix the problem. The list experts all said that it was
probably something simple. After spending about 10-15 minutes under the hood,
I discovered a disconnected vacuum line. I reconnected it, road tested the
car, and before I could even look at the boost gauge, I realized that the car
was a LOT faster. I am now getting 1.8 bar, and boy am I happy.

What makes this list SO great is that I never even knew I had a problem
before the whole boost pressure discussion happened. I thought the car was a
rocket before! Now it is MUCH faster.

So Thanks to Everyone!

When everything has completely  dried you can see if any white =

I liberally spray WD-40 in the empty battery boxes and on the floor =

these with lithium based grease... but any thin film of grease will do.

This treatment has preserved my battery boxes/floor pan. Rinsing =

the bare/slightly corroded areas are very small, I only use grease =
to inhibit corrosion. Special paints do exist (look in Stoddards, etc, =

Subject: Engine is out

Hi everyone,
The motors out and a number of problems Confront me. Number one is there
appears to be well actually there is rust in the box section leading towards
the engine mounts. The rust is in the a line on each side and about the length
and thickness of a pen. Next area of rust the sprouted up is at the elbows on
the inside by the floor and firewall. This appears to be pretty bad cause when
a socket slipped it bust through into one of the box sections that had been
covered with bondo in fact it looks like the the elbows here were held on by
the bondo. Do I forget about rebuilding and dump the car or do I try and fix
these section with patches. The box sections have been patched forward of here
at the jack points. I love the car but thousands of dollars of rust repair?
Second The air distrubutor at the top of the motor is supposed to pull apart
according rebuilding your aircooled VW . I can pull the engine with these
things and they will not move! Oh and all the bolts have been removed. And
thats it for now Thanks
Nick

Subject: 914 riding high...too high?

	On the advice of this group I have been prepping my car for 
serious enjoyment, whether it be for autocross or just plain fun, with a 
few improvements.  I replaced the tall 165/15 tires with Yoko A509s that 
were 195/60/15.  I noticed I actually was draggin bottom from time to 
time.  I recently undertook the replacement of the suspension when I went 
on for an alignment and was told there was a suspension problem.  I 
replaced with KYB all around and new "lowering" springs as well.  When 
finished (after much agony and several personal wars with various bolts 
etc) I noticed that my car is sitting _WAY_ higher.  Never having really 
looked at another 914 (mine is jealous and gets upset about things like 
that you see)  I always thought it was SUPPOSED to be that low.  All the 
shocks 
were completely dead, probably originals from the looks of things.  The 
ride is amazing though much higher, and I'm wondering if I did something 
wrong somehow or if it really is supposed to ride that high.  THe car 
looks much better higher up I think.  But anyway, I was hoping someone 
might tell me just how to go about lowering the 914 and if it is worth it 
for the added cornering speed.  
	Also, I was wondering if I was a moron or it really does take a 
long time to replace the suspension.  It took me 3.5 hours total to 
replace the back shocks and springs (including compress/decompress) and 3 
hours on each front  At 10 hours I don't think I set any speed records 
here, but everything was so rusty!  Anyone else who is new to mechanics 
undertake this project?  Until we meet on the track....    Rick

My 993 coupe has an interesting habit. If the A/C is running and the 
compressor is engaged, the engine stalls when coming to a stop. I 
guess most 993 drivers have noticed that when you depress the clutch 
and remove your foot from the gas, the engine speed drops waaaay down 
then comes back up to idle. In my case the speed drops so far that 
the engine flames out.  The dealer has plugged in his diagnostic voo-

Well, I'm not a braking expert, but I sometimes play one on the 'net.
There is more to brakes and braking than the size of the pad.
The 911 calipers have larger pistons (48mm vs. 42mm) which
provides greater clamping force on the rotor for a given hydraulic
pressure.  I was going to say that the 911 rotors are also larger
and thus the calipers sit farther out from the center of rotation
and provide marginally greater braking force due to the longer
moment arm (correct term?), but the difference in size is
negligable.

I'm sure others can elaborate and provide more details.  You
might want to check out Fred Phun's Brake Handbook, available
from places like Performance Products.

Subject:  Lap welds vs. butt welds

Hi p-philers,

I've taken my 914 to several restoration/body shops
for estimates on repairing rust damage to the rear trunk
and passenger side engine compartment  (lower firewall,
engine shelf, and boxed "frame" area).  When asked
whether they would repair the engine compartment areas
using lap or butt welds, every one of them replied
"lap welds, with a continuous weld along the seam".
The last place I went to specifically mentioned using a
flanging tool so that the two panels lay flat.  ASCII art:

   Panel 1 ________  __________ Panel 2
               _____/

When asked "why not butt welds" (which I understand from
the list is the way to go as they are stronger and less likely
to rust), they replied "because the back side of the weld is
not accessible" (and in the boxed "frame" area, its not).

My questions are:
Are butt welds the only way to go, or are lap welds with
a continuously welded seam acceptable?

In order to do a proper butt weld, do you need access to
both sides of the panel?

Should I keep looking for a different restoration shop?

Thanks for any advice,

Subject: Hot Early 911 - Update

Hi!

	Well, I got a few helpful responses to my question about the hot-running
911T.

	To recap, the temp was running betwixt 210 and 250, regardless of
ambient temperature - anywhere from low 60's to mid 90's.
	
	Fan belt was tight, oil was new, valves adjusted about a month or so
ago.

	Well, tonight I ran 2 pints of Berryman B-12 in the oil, warming the
car up with it in the motor (to a bit above 210) and going thru various
engine speeds.   Decided to clean the air filter at the same time

(Hint:  wear ear protection when you stick your head into one of these
engine compartments without the air filter!!!)

	I ran it about 35 minutes or so, and then drained the oil and put a
new filter on.

	I then too it out an _whomped_ on it (once it warmed up, of course)
I really worked it, redlining (bouncing off the rev limiter anyway) in
4 of the 5 gears.

	I changed the oil again.

	It was all I could do to get the needle to almost, but not quite touch 210.
I set the hand throttle to 4.5k, and ran it for 3 minutes, and the temp
wouldn't _budge_ from 180.  Yes, it actually cooled down at idle! (didn't
do _that_ before!

	As a final test, I let it burble happily at idle for about 15-20 minutes
while I cleaned up the mess I'd made (can you change the oil in a 911
and _not_ make a mess?)

	So, I think I've temporarily fixed the problem, which I think was/is
the thermostat, so I guess I should start looking toward replacing that.
AutoSport here in Sac wants $95 for the thermo & $3 for the O-ring (OUCH!)
Been buying VW parts too much lately, not accustomed to such sticker shock!

	So, any feedback or interpretation of these results is welcome, and
thanx again for the help!
	
PS - do _not_ get this BErryman B-12 on your paint!  Don't ask how I know :(

Sounds like they broke your already broken case. I'd call around and

Yes, perfectly normal.  The beautiful thing, well one of the beautiful

Alan,

Air in the system: I suppose that if you left a fair amount in there,
it is possible that you managed to boil the coolant because of severe
over-heating.

More likely, you have either a blown head gasket or a cracked cylinder
head.  Any way you look at it, the head is coming off.  Sounds like a
warranty matter for you, though.

So he's telling you the car is fine and yet it stalls.  Nice dealer.

I'd start by a) cleaning the idle stabilizer and b) checking basic fuel
mixture.  I'd also look for vacuum leaks.  I don't know whether the 993
sends an "AC on" signal to its DME, indicating extra load.  If it does,
check that too.  Given the age of your car, the lambda sensor shouldn't
be a decel recovery issue.

Bryan:

No.  Pad area has no impact on anything except pad life (larger pads 
last longer).

The 911 brakes, as you guessed, will give you better fade-resistance.  
The calipers are also stiffer, so you'll get better brake feel.  They 
also give you stronger spindles, which you probably don't need.  They 
also give you real five-lug hubs, so you can mount five-spoke 911 
wheels without those cheasy 4-to-5 adapters.

If you put the whole 911 front-end in, instead of just the brakes, you 
get a lighter crossmember in addition to the larger torsion bars you 
mentioned.

If these things aren't important to you, don't put the 911 brakes on 
your 914.  They won't give you more "stopping power", whatever that is; 
if you can already hit your stock brakes hard enough to lock all four 
wheels, there's no more "stopping power" available.  If you want to 
stop sooner, you'll need more tire, not more brake.

One thing:  There are a lot of cars running around with Ferodo DS-11 
pads.  These are (or were, anyway) the hot ticket for serious racing, 
so a lot of people have installed them on their street cars for "better 
braking".

Unless your daily commute involves 100-mph stops every few seconds, 
though, these pads will never get into their working heat range.  If 
your car has DS-11s, replace them with a set of Metalmasters or 
something... You'll feel a big difference.

By the way, if you put the whole 911 front-end in, instead of just the 
brakes, you also get a lighter crossmember and larger torsion bars.

Only one?  BOTH halfshafts should exhibit some axial play to accomodate the

My early '83 928S has an ABS idiot light in the instrument pod (not
connected but it has a bulb, was thinking it would be an interesting place
to wire a hidden radar detector) and I'm reasonably sure its original
(manufacture date codes of 1982). Think I've seen 1984 928S with ABS but am
not perfectly sure.

Not really a waste of time. I'm sure Porsche's recommendations weren't
founded without some research on their part. It's usually the oil contamination
you're concerned with at these relatively low intervals (+/- 6000 mi) rather
than
oil breakdown...something the filter at 3000mi should take care of. As for the

Scott,

Sorry but most of the above is not correct, I looked the Carrera CS up at
home and it is listed as a lightweight model, sport version of the Carrera.
No rear seat, minimum soundproofing, sport seats,.....reminds me about a
certain '72 '73 model!

The standard HP rating for '88, as listed by Car&Driver, Motor Trend, Car
Trend was 214HP for the US 911 Carrera. The 911 Carrera CS is rated to 231HP!

In David Vivian's book 'Porsche 911', he has compared a 911 CS to a Carreera
RS and a Turbo SE, the table is clear, the CS outperforms the RS in all
cathergories, .....well 60-80 in fourth was actually in favor of the RS.
0-90 is almost 2 second difference. 

The paint job is very much in the spirit of the Carrera RS, the cars I've
seen are white with the red Carrera Stripes low on the sides of the car, but
it says 'Carrera CS' not 'Carrera (RS?)'. It is also a Decal saying 'CS' low
left on the front hood (viewed from front).

Let's see, in 1973 Porsche strips a 911 and make a lighter version with more
HP and call it Carrera RS. They do the same in '88 and call it 'Carrera CS'.

I know I have the original 'Auto Motor und Sport' or 'Sport Auto' test
somewhere, I shall return with the modification list when I find it.

Good analogy (?) Ken, I think it is recommended to do oil change every 500
kilometer or approximately 350 miles if you drive an air cooled Porsche. For
the water coolers however there is no need change that often.

>My questions are:

In my (humble) opinion you can do with lap welds. Most cars were put
together by spot welds alone. No continously welding seams at all, but if
you're doing 'splicing' you may want the seam welds. If you go with lap
welds, continous seam and 'spot welds' half an inch from the edge, you will
most certainly have a *very* good seam!

Configure you mail program with courier font and watch this crude ASCII art:

>In order to do a proper butt weld, do you need access to
>both sides of the panel?

Yes and no! There are special clamps and tools that will help you lining up
the panels. Don't really think you will have to get to the rear side if
you're a pro, but for me I will need that so that I can grind and add some
weld seams from the 'inside'. I would recommend TIG welding for splicing
panels, it's like night and day cmpared to MIG/MAG which will eat the
through the panels in notime if you're a little slow, unsecure, it *MUST*
flow in a continously rotating seam. 

>Should I keep looking for a different restoration shop?

Naah,...there are more to this, ask for the possibility to review some of
their structural work on others cars, what equipment they're using, (should
be TIG or top-end MIG/MAG, plasma cutters, etc, do they have any panel
beater equipment?(big plus if they have,...and use it), prices etc.

Lap welds can and should be sealed off permanently, then they will last.

I had an 83. The Boges wore out around 80K, and I let them bounce for
another 10K or so.<g> I did not change to the Bilsteins mainly because of
the expense involved: at the time they were considerably more expensive
than the Konis, and not felt to be worth it by those parties I talked to. I
did hear about the ride height issue, but was not told that I would have to
change springs. The words "slightly taller" spring to mind, no pun
intended. So I got the Konis, and adjusted them to a mid-setting. The car
felt SO much better; at that point the car was bouncing and misbehaving,
and I never felt the shocks were too stiff. The car weighs so much you'd
have to get really stiff before it affected the ride.

In a nutshell, this is what I was told: If the car came with Bilsteins, get
Bilsteins. If it came with Konis, get Konis. If it came with Boges, switch
to Konis.

Nate,
  I just called Hertz concerning car rental for someone 21 years old. The owner
of the Hertz rental agency here in Ramstein, Germany says that they rent to 21 
year olds. You need a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard) and a valid 
stateside drivers license (no international license required). The Hertz phone 
# is 01149-6371-58834 from the states. Be prepared to pay BIG bucks as car 
rentals are not cheap like the states. As a side note, the international 
drivers license is required in: Spain, Austria, Portugal, Hungary, Bulgaria, 
Romania, Czech, Yugoslavia. So if you tool on down to Austria, get one. Any 
other ?'s about Deutschland give me a hollar.
Oh yes, don't forget that gas is 1.55 deutschmarks per LITER.At todays exchange
rate of 1.37DM to the buck that's ~$4.53 a gallon. So remember the old

Trond,

You always seem to forget that Porsches sold in this country (the USA)
not the same as the ones sold in Europe or the rest of the world (ROW).

I have the Road & Track write up on the car in front of me (May 1988).

Let's see, the BHP is 214 SAE net @ 5900 RPM and the torque is 195 lb-ft
@ 4800 RPM. This is same as the stock USA '88 Carrera.

The CS weighs in at 155 lbs. less than the stock '88 Carrera. Hardly what
one would call "lightweight" in comparison.

Road & Track reports the 0-60 time as 5.7 seconds. That is the same time
the '86 Carrera Cabriolet recorded for Road & Track two years earlier.

The pictures of the car in Road & Track and the ones I have seen in person
(I have seen three different examples) do not have special paint jobs.
They all have decals on the driver's side front fender (I call that the
left fender) and on the rear decklid. There are no graphics elsewhere on
the car.

So Trond, everything I said was correct based on a U.S. model '88 911
Carrera Club Sport. Yes, I am sure the R.O.W. '88 Club Sport has 231 hp.
That is standard for the R.O.W. 3.2 Liter motors.

So, as I said before, hardly a special car in anyway except for the
limited production run. I have no idea how many they made. The car was
NOT a homologation special like the '73 Carrera RS. The car does not
have a special motor like the '73 Carrera RS. The car is NOT made of
thinner metal like the first 1000 or so '73 Carrera RS cars. The '73
Carrera RS was not a bone stock car with some sound deading removed and
special decals slapped on. The '88 Carrera Club Sport in no way reminds
me of a '73 Carrera RS.

Do you know the exact wight difference between, say a '72 S/E/T and '72
Carrera RS then? Regarding thinner metal, wasn't it Aluminum and fiberglass
panels *instead* of certain steel panels that stood for the wight savings???

The CS's you've seen is *FAR* from what was delivered in Europe and ROW
then, I would prefer sticking to the cars as (intended) and delivered from
Stuttgart, not with major mods to meet US emission when discussing a cars
charachteristics.(...even though those mods certainly were made in Stuttgart).

The paint job is 100% Carrera RS look a like, (3-4 real life expperiences
and more magazine sightings) and if they painted the cars otherwise for the
USA, ....your loss!

The european press (at least the articles I've read) concludes with a sporty
lightweight 911, outperforming the periode Carrera and '73 Carrera RS with ease!

The CS was in no need of major rework, as the late Carrera's had almost
everything that was needed. Therefore 'bone stock' car, very little sound
proofing, and the old Carrera's decals in place. Not particulary 'slapped
on'. No rear seats too.

The car was no success, launched at the wrong time, almost immediately after
the '87 stock exchange crack, and I agree that perhaps a little to little
were done to the weight problem.
But before you comment too strong about a car, you should try it, or at
least read what the experts said about it,....or conclude that you're
speaking of *THE US VERSION* and only it.

Fellow P-filers,

For any of you who have seen my cry for help on the net a few times 
because of a stiff engine that wouldn't turn over, the problem has been 
solved.  Unfortunately, all of the P-car mechanics I talked to 
(in my area) couldn't figure out what was wrong, but my girlfriend's Dad 
(who rebuilds Ford engines) pointed me right to it.  Bad starter, the 
first thing I replaced when I started this whole search 2 months ago!  
Not only was it bad in terms of cranking power (when tested), the collar 
was hitting the flywheel when it went out to engage which was binding 
everything up.  I took it back and exchanged for a Sportamatic style 
starter (for the 1-2 more amps it produces), bolted it in, and the 
engine turns over like its new!!!

Thanks for all the advice I did get.  It has helped me understand my 
engine a heck of a lot more!

Sobb, sniffle, caugh, choke, cry....

So off I went to Chicago to see the Tubos S.  The owner is a great guy, only
ridding himself of his pride and joy to concentrate on his new 993 C4..
Maintained the car with love and care, and has the records to prove it.  A
good look at the paint job by Barrington Coach House proves very impressive.
 And a quick test drive with the owner only affirrms the performance
capabilities of this (IMHO one of the finest the Dr. ever produced) PCar.

I trade him my Chevy Corsica rent a car, and head off for the pre-purchase
inspection.  Cruising at 50mph on the expressway, with visions of sugar plums
dancing in my head, and the open road ahead..........the tach dies, oil
pressure goes to zero, and the car dies.  I coast over to to the shoulder,
and run up my Cellular One bill.  An hour later the owner arrives, and we
finally get the car started and off the expressway.  Onto a side road, he
gets in, and off we go again.  A cruise controlled 30mph 2 mile drive, and
wham, the same thing again.  Dead.

He did have the AutoAuthority Stage II chip removed, and the factory chip put
back in. (he only useses the Stage II at his bianual trip to Road America),
and the first thought is that there might be something amiss with the seating
of the chip... but who knows.

Who knows, just a loose wire, or a real bad omen, but am I to fool with the
unknown?  Logically, there may be nothing wrong with the car, but it just
felt like the my Grandmother doused an act of "acrobatic intamacy" with a
bucket of ice water.  So,  I rush to O'hare, catch the last flight to the
east coast, drown my sorrows in a several good libations, and send this
(rather depressing) note to my friends.

Thanks to all who gave me advice and places in Chicago to get my pre-purchase

Porschephiles,

Here's something you should check on your 944.  I noticed lately that
the steering effort on my 87 944S had increased significantly.  A check
under the car revealed that the cooling hose that goes to the back of the
alternator had come loose from deterioration and the wire reinforcement 
of the hose had become wrapped around the steering knuckle/rack.  Yikes!  
This could have been dangerous.  Check those hoses.  

I also have a question.  When investigating the steering problem, I found
a loose wire with a black plug on it hanging down from the vicinity of 
the A/C peep hole.  It is tie wrapped to the a/c line and runs from under
the fuse box to the front of the car.  I believe the colors are Orange, 
White, and Blue(?) wrapped in a black covering.  Does this attach to a 
temperature sensor to turn on the first fan?  My car has been heating up now
unless I force the fans to run by using the A/C.  I looked all over and
didn't find anywhere to attach the wire.  Where is the temp sensor?  On
the block?  Help.  :)

I certainly agree...even though that question makes me uncomfortable,
since there's "ability to pay" and then there's "ability to PAY".

If I walk in and say "CASH", I have my doubts that I'm going to be able
to really negotiate the price as low as I may want.  Besides, many

Sounds like the parts you replaced were bad broke.  You can check the
ride height with the "Automotion Methode":  There should be 2.5 - 3.5"
between the TOP of the wheel and the BOTTOM of the fender at the back,
and the car should sit level.

The previous owner of one 914 had cut two turns off of the stock spring
and put them over trashed shocks.  What a terrible ride that was.

And...  Lower is not always better.  (IMHO) much more than an inch
or so below stock height and the geometry starts getting screwed up.

3.5 hours?  Sounds like you took the extra time to keep your fingers
from getting snapped off when the spring "sproinged".

Who *cares* how long it took.  Is the job done right?  Is all of your
blood *inside* your body where is belongs?  Those are the important

Subject: Ooops - 914 FI Wiring!


If *anyone* on the list could take the time to do me a *huge* favor it'd
be much appreciated.  As you will see from the description below, I don't
want to have to remove wires from a connector and experiement until they
are correct.  The car is, of course, a D-Jet 914.

Problem #1
==========
The wiring to the connector for the trigger points on the distributor was
split - therefore I had to cut the connector off to re-wire that portion of
the harness.  PROBLEM!  Forgot to label each of the three wires to the 
connector and I now have an orientation problem.

The wiring diagrams I have so that for the D-Jetronic engine, the three wires
to the distributor trigger points go to pins 12, 22, and 24 on the connector
to the FI control unit.  From the diagram it appears that the wire to pin 12
goes to the center of the connector, if this is true I need to know the
orientation of the other two connectors.

The connector looks like this:
	     _____________
            /             \
	   | ===  ===  === |
	   -----------------
	      ^	   ^    ^
              |    |    |_________ ( to 22 or 24?)
              |    |_______________( to 12 (assumption))
	      |____________________( to 22 or 24?)

As you all know, getting these wrong will result in a non-functional engine
as the wrong injectors will fire(or not at all).  If no one can help, should
I just pull the spades out of the connector, wire-it up and use 
trial-and-error?

Problem #2
==========
I have a three-wire section of harness for the engine compartment area.  I 
am *not* sure where it goes/what it is for.  I looked on Scot Douglas' 914
and they were not present.  Any ideas?

The three-wires are, brown, green, and yellow/red.  I know for a fact that
they connect to the relay circuit board and the ground nearby at one end.
My diagrams show them to connect to the two small "poles" that are near 
the fuses on the relay board.  (They are the same sort of connectors that
are inside the plastic 12 pole connectors - but separate.)

The opposite end of these wires have no connectors, just a small section of
bare wire.  Any clues?

Thanks, Thanks, and Thanks again in advance,

Jerry(who needs to start his car this weekend)

Stan,

Thank you for changing my mail to the digest group.  The wealth of
knowledge is incredible and I have within a short time learned more about
the P-cars.  I have been driving a 911 for about 3 years after having grown
up with them in my family.  Nonetheless, your group has increased my
excitement in what I believe is the finest automobile ever built and more
importantly, the most thrilling to drive.  I live in Marin County,
California and the 911 is built for many of the canyon roads.  I sometimes
get up at 3:00 A.M. and drive into the Point Reyes National Park area,
travelling north on U.S. 1; no other vehicles in sight, although sometimes
numerous deer on the roadsides.  Great fun, especially with a full moon and
the top off, listening to the whine of the 6 cylinders pushing me thru the
next turn.  My wife and kids wonder what the smile on my face is when I
come back a few hours later!

Anyway, thanks again for the digest and if you ever happen to get lost in
this neck of the woods, during a full moon, give me a call.  In the
meantime, I will stop thinking of the practical reasons to keep this
vehicle and let my kids enjoy the driving experience as my Dad let me.
Take care,

David

Yves-

You can bang it out from the back--the alternator and
fan will come out of the fan housing together--and then
you will need a small gear puller to pull the fan off
the alternator shaft.

Alternatively -- and I think this is a better method --
first pull off the fan with the gear puller, then take out
the long bolts around the circulference of the alternator.
These protrude through the fan housing, and can bind up if
you try to knock out the alternator with them in place.

Don't know about the color.  On my '72T and '72T the fan is
grey,i.e., natural metal, no paint (although yesterday I
painted the T's fan to match the body color...I like
to include a little personal touch when I do a rebuild...)

Subject: 914 Reunion -- my OPINION!

 Dennis Deeds and all the P-Philes,
 
 Gee wiz Dennis?  I read the scathing note you sent to P-philes and frankly I 
 can't see why you have to be so upset at what I said?  I went back and read my 
 post and your post and I will make one attempt to rectify this situation and, 
 unfortunately, defend my honor, which I sort of have to do since you sent a 
 huge note to everyone saying, in effect, that my _opinion_ was a lie. (I fail 
 to see how an opinion can be a untrue, just that it might not match someone 
 else's opinion).  Apologies to all who don't care about this and I promise that 
 this will be my last public post on the subject.
 
 1) I didn't pre-register because I thought I might have to work Sat and Sun.
 2) I called down to 914 OA and they said it would be fine to pay if I show up.
 3) I _WAS_ disappointed as to the number of cars and the number of pure stock 
 cars.  Others may not have been.  That's what opinions are for.  That in _NO_ 
 way is a slam on the organization of the event, just that my expectations were 
 not fully met.  THAT'S ALL.
 4) Mike Willis' and Ray (Roy?) Juan's cars looked great to me -- the others, no 
 matter the condition made me quite jealous, since mine has no engine and is 
 covered in dust.
 5) Again, my _opinion_ but there wasn't a whole lot to do after the car show 
 for the folks not interested in touring the stars' homes.  I do not pretend to 
 speak for everyone, but one of the discussions some of us had at lunch was that 
 it would be a neat idea for the next reunion if there were some driving events, 
 more tech sessions, etc.  I didn't bring up the subject, nor did I participate 
 in the discussions much since I had never been to a 914 OA Reunion before.
 6) I did decide to leave and miss the dinner and tech sessions.  There was some 
 time to kill until dinner and as far as I could tell there was nothing on the 
 schedule once I made the decision to skip the stars' homes tour so I rode home.
 7) Before I left I went to pay Dennis because I felt that since I participated 
 in the event, I should pony up the cash.  I could have just left and never 
 paid, but that didn't seem right.  When I said that the price was a bit steep 
 for just a car show that merely reflects _MY_ participation in the event.  I 
 went to the car show, that's all that interested me, thus the price was high. 
 Others who attended the entire event may feel the same way, Dennis, but I will 
 not speak for them.  I don't think I whined about the price, I just said that I 
 paid it and then I made a few suggestions for improvements.
 8) Dennis seemed like a pretty nice guy, was able to pronounce "Karlsruhe" (a 
 city in Germany) correctly (which I cannot do), and we had a nice, 2-3 minute 
 talk.  I brought up possibly doing a subwoofer design article for the 
 newsletter because I wanted to see if he was interested.  Sounded like he was 
 so I will be working on it (if any of you are interested I'll post a copy to 
 p-philes.
 9)  Dennis and I both agree that Mike Willis was a big help.
 10) My summary said "A good way to spend a free day; wish there was more car 
 oriented stuff; Mike is cool!"  I don't see that as a slam of the event, nor do 
 I retract it.  Sounds kinda like a small compliment to me....
 
 I apologize if Dennis or anyone else thought that I was attacking them -- I 
 don't think my post read that way, but if it did, I am sorry.  I think the 
 EVENT could have been better with more interesting activities -- that's an 
 OPINION I held, continue to hold and one that I am more than happy to work to 
 solve for the next event, if Dennis would like suggestions from one of the 
 masses.  I think Dennis' note reflected his opinion, but I felt there were more 
 than a few personal attacks toward me because I gave criticism to the _event_ 
 and that is the only reason I post this to the public forum.  If anyone would 
 like to continue this off-line, please e-mail me at the site below.

Trond,

I can't believe you! If you remember, the car that started this whole
thread was '88 Club Sport for sale in the U.S. We have been talking about
the U.S.
spec car all along. I was the one that pointed out to you that the you need
to remember there are U.S. version of these cars. The U.S. version is a
"delete option" car that cost more and offers no special abilities.

I doubt that the European and ROW version of the Carrera CS is "FAR" different
than the U.S. version. I bet the only difference is the graphics, the version
of the 3.2 engine, the tranny gear ratios, and the ride height settings.
In other words, the difference between the European and U.S spec Carrera CS is
probably the same as the difference between the European and U.S spec Carrera.
Since I don't have specs for the Euro CS in front of me, I can't say for sure.

I've seen the U.S. Carrera CS in action and it is nothing special. The only
real difference is that it weigh 155 lbs. less. Big F**king Deal!!!

The first 1000 or so '73 Carrera RS bodies were made of thinner steel. This
was all they needed to make to homolgate that feature. The rest of the cars
made used standard thickness of metal. The weight of the '73 RS also depended
on what version was ordered. There was a lightweight and a touring package.

There is no way the '88 Carrera CS out performs a lightweight '73 RS. Sure,
the Euro CS has 231 HP compared to the 210 HP of the RS. But I can guarantee
the lightweight '73 RS weighs a good deal less and is a better balanced
race car. I don't consider tests showing that one car accelerates from 60
to 90 in top gear faster than another very important when evaluating a race
cars potential.

Rolando,

I think you are going to find that 250# springs are too stiff for your
car if it retains its stock 23.5 mm torsion bars.  I'd recommend the 210#
springs.  The 250# seem to work fine with the turbo's 25.5 mm torsion
bar.  These numbers have worked for me and for an SCCA IT race 944.

Yes, the rear bars are quite a bit of work to replace, unlike the 911's.
Shop time est'd is about 6 hours, exclusive of the alignment you need
afterwards.  There is also a bit of trial and error in setting them up
with respect to getting the ride height correct, since everything is
unloaded during installation, and because you are changing the springing
and so the loaded/unloaded height delta!  We eyeballed mine when we did
them a few months ago, and were fortunate.

I believe he/you ought to be able to either scan fault codes out of the

They're Oetiker clamps, and there is a special tool which you can buy
(short money) for both cutting them off and crimping them on.  Or you
can just cut them off with diagonal cutters, replace with small zebra-
or band-style hose clamps.

When you do this, it is *real* important that you use new clamps with
rolled edges, like the factory does.  The flat edges on hardware store
clamps will eventually cut the hose.  The 944 paddocked next to me at
LRP last month learned this lesson the hard way!

Subject: 914 break-in oil?

        How important is it to use a particular weight of oil
when breaking in a 914 engine?  I have heard that I should not
use synthetic for the break-in period.  Why?  Why shouldn't I
break in the engine using the oil I will run in it when it is
broken in?  (No, I'm not going to synthetic--it ain't in the
budget, but still...)
        Stan recommends breaking-in using 40 wt; but that's
what he recommends all the time in a 914.  I have also heard
that I should use 30 wt--and that's what the factory recom-
mended when the car was built.  I am considering using 20/50
Kendall dino oil, and am thinking that I should use it for the
break-in period as well.
        With *luck*, I'll be starting the beast tonight, so a
prompt reply would be appreciated!

Boy, you must really feel lucky.

If you are unwilling to spend the time and the money to have your
timing belt and balance shaft belt properly tensioned (i.e. Use the
P9201 belt tension tool), then start saving your money for valves and 
a head gasket set.

I have set the tension on at least 30 motors, and although I can get
pretty close by feel, I still use the gauge to check my work, and if
it is not in the specified range, I re-adjust it.

The special procedure for the backyard mechanic: Spend the money on 
the tool, or spend the money for another motor...Your choice...

Hi Alan,

Well, this does in fact sound like the thermoswitch plug, which
should be attached to the thermoswitch, located high on the radiator,
driver's side, just underneath the two hoses there.

In order to re-attach it, you *may* have to drop the fan shroud
assembly.

It certainly would keep your fans from working on their own...

Chris,

I had the confused-parking sporadic-intermittent wiper-impaired problem on my

found corrosion on the points of the wiper relay.  On my car, the wiper relay
is up in the "behind-the-AC/vent-ducting, above-the-firewall, under-the-dash

remove the wiper motor, and reach thru the instrument holes to get it.

Some of these clamps are a. either difficult or impossible to find or b. very
very expensive per/each.  I was able to reuse mine by carefully expanding
them with a punch or other suitable tool.  First, you can just usually pull
of the hose without removing the fitting.  Then, remove the clamp, expand and
reuse.  If you don't expand them too much, you don't need the special tool to
recrimp.  Simply sure a pair of dull wire cutters, more example.

I certainly agree...even though that question makes me uncomfortable, 
since there's "ability to pay" and then there's "ability to PAY".

If I walk in and say "CASH", I have my doubts that I'm going to be able 
to really negotiate the price as low as I may want.  Besides, many 
dealerships get commissions on bank loans they bring in, so a cash 
customer represents less profit.

Better balanced? Do you mean to say that Porsche got it right in '73 and
changed to the worse for '88. I cannot believe my ears! Anti-evolution? The
brakes are better, the suspension components, every f***ing mechanichal part
in most cars are steadily developed towards better functioning and materials. 

The 60-80 in fourth gear was the *ONLY* of about 25 measurements between the
Carrera RS and the Carrera CS that were in favor of the Carrera RS. The CS
(Euro/ROW) version accelerates from 0-50mph in *5.1* seconds where the same
year Turbo accelerates in *4.9*. Beats the carrera RS all the way up to top
speed 151mph!

That's the facts, if the car were altered for the US market, bad for you.

Basically I said the Carrera CS was an attempt to reinvent the Carrera RS,
and if performance is the clue,...they did! In my original posting I wrote;

Porsche tried to reinvent the Carrera RS, the Euro/Rest Of the World version
did,...however they decided to make the US version most suited to star in

Another option instead of the magnets is velcro just to be sure the magnet

Parking wiper problem. Hint. when you R&R you motor, did you remove the first
drive arm from the motor shaft?  the multi-splined one?. On the early motors
this arm was welded to the motor shaft and mis-parking was not possible, on
late versions, however, the arm is removeable, and without knowing, you can
throw the park position off. So remove the wiper motor and mark the relation
of the arm to shaft, then move the arm in the opposite direction of rotation
a couple of spline notches, this will allow the  park position to be closer
to the bottom of the stroke. A little trial and error, and you should have
the park position where you want it. The engineers did not put the park at
the complete bottom of the stroke, to save startup strain on the motor and
adhesion friction of blades used infrequently.  Hope this can clear things up
for you (pun intended).:).

Well, the reason I am such a stickler on these belts is that I 
broke one on my first (and still) 944.  The belt stretched, 
started cannibalizing its own teeth and left me with 8 bent valves.
Luckily, it was in the garage and not at the autocross track.
The cost was around $1000 at the time (before I knew better) and 
I did the remove, replace, retime and retension myself (after buying
the gauge...)

There are enough valve to piston occurrences that I have sold a
bunch of complete heads as being cheaper than replacing 
valves and guides, etc.  

The reason that the tension is so critical is that the engine
grows 9 mm in every direction from cold to hot. Too loose a belt
and it chews teeth when cold. Too tight, and the growth of the 
engine stretches the belt so much it breaks the fibers, resulting 
in a loose belt (see above.)

So, since I run my car hard, and I don't trailer my car to the track
(no safety net) I choose to do it the way that the designers specify.
Good Luck!

Subject: Re: 914 -> Early 911 Brakes

I'm not sure I agree with your post, while not discounting what you 
wrote, do you mean my 914 brakes would stop a 993 from 60 mph in the 
neighborhood of 120 some odd feet?  The new bitubo generates 2,000 
horsepower ob braking force which is a function of brake application 
pressure, velocity, and temperature.  Using the braking power, you can 
calculate the braking force at the ground by taking the difference 
between brake torque and the product of the wheel's rotational inertia 
and deceleration, then divide this mess by the wheel's radius.  I agree 
that bigger contact patch on the tire should provide better deceleration, 
but tire adhesion has alot to do with the tire's bulk hysteresis.  Also, 
the coefficient of friction increases over the static value with 10-20% 
slip.  Then the mass of the figures in as F=ma or F=md in this case.  
Oop, almost forgot about proportioning-that makes a difference too.  My 
point is, its not right to assume big tire are what's needed to increase 
braking.  If this were so,  Brembo wouldn't exist and Porsche would still 
be putting 914 brake on all of their cars.

I had this same problem with my 944S.  When I bought the car, I replaced
all the ignition components (wires, spark plugs, rotor, cap), everything
except the coil (it was $64). Being a purist, I eventually bought a new
coil. Guess what? The symptoms you describe above went away! It still
does it every so often, but not nearly as bad and it is such a rare
occurence I hardly notice it anymore.

The '73 Carrera RS is a street legal race car. The '88 Carrera CS is a
slightly lightened poduction vehicle. The '73 Carrera RS has different
suspension pickup points on the rear and raised spindles on the front to
improve the roll center when the car is lowered. The '73 Carrera RS was
built this way so the RSR could take advantage of these features for
improved handling and braking characteristics.

The brakes on a '73 Carrera RS are better matched to the car than the brakes
on the '88 CS. The suspenion used on the production 911's did not change much
from '74 to '89. The only real changes were torsion and anit-sway bar sizes.
Brakes got bigger because the cars got heavier and heavier. You clearly have
no clue in this regard.

0-50 MPH in 5.1 seconds is not very impressive. I am fairly sure the '73
Carrera RS matched that. Straight line acceleration is a only one facet
of performance. Handling is the what makes the '73 Carrera RS so special.
How much speed you can carry out of a turn is more important than raw
acceleration.

If the Carrera Club Sport was a successfull reincarnation of the '73 Carrera
RS, the car would have a large following today. Clearly, this is not the
case.

I would like to see the specs on the Euro Carrera CS, not the road tests.

I think you would be penny-wise and pound-foolish to work one off then

not hard to find, nor are they expensive.  Porsche will sell them to you,

Subject: Beware of the Yellow Oil


Really! Peeing in one's own oil! How rude!

First of all on the filter thing. I use AND recommend factory oil 
filters for most Porsches. Those excepted are the 914 and 924 as the 
VW and aftermarket *quality* filter DO work and can save some money.

Air filters should be as originally installed EXCEPT those miserable
oil bath crappers on the 914. I convert those to a PAPER element.

I use K&N filters for the track only. They work well and provide the low
restriction I want on the track. I put the PAPER element air filter in 
for my other driving as it keeps the countryside from visiting the 
inner tracts of my engine. 

For people with new engines to break in: Do an oil change at 500 miles,
change the filter with the oil. The go your regular interval. It doesn't
seem to make much difference whether you use your regular oil or not.
The reason for the early change is to inspect for any abnormal metal, 
sealing adhesive, assembly lube or crud that has worked loose since the 
engine was assembled. 

Exploding filters. haven't seen many except when the oil was so cruddy
that the passages and filter clogged. The big problem is the filter 
material splitting and no filtration occuring. Early 924 filters leaked 
because the oil pressure could reach 9.5 Bar when cold. The 914 with 
the big Melling oil pump can do this also. If you run an oil cooler
on ANY Porsche, put a 180 degree F oil thermostat in line before the 
cooler. This will prevent 100+ pounds of oil pressure from splitting the cooler. 911 coolers require an in-line thermostat. Same for 924/944/968.

Kevin and Mr. Baum,

I too like to do things right but don't like to throw away money.  The stress
on reused clamps-one time- I would think would be insignificant.  And, at
least on my '72S, pulling the old hoses off with the clamps on was no
problem.

As I recall on the '72 there were at least 2 sizes on clamps on the fuel/air
lines.  would this require 2 tools or does one tool fit all?  The Porsche
dealer had only one size clamp avaible when I checked, I believe and I think
they were 3 or 4 buck EACH, for a lousy little clamp.  I don't like to spend
my money that way.  You can.  Plus by reusing the clamps I didn't need the
special crimping tool.. By the way I have thousands in tools but didn't see
for one here.

Interesting to see the clamps generate so much interest.

Different models had ABS in different years.  Our 87 944T has ABS, and the
suspension was changed between 86 and 87 to accomodate it on 944s. 911's
didn't get it until the C4 came out (year?) then the C2, because of the
earlier 911 suspension design.  Don't know when the 928 got it. Of course,
the 959 had it, if you want to talk semi-production, non-US cars!

Trond, you are losing control here. The brakes on the Carrera CS are stock
'88 Carrera fair. Let's assume the '73 Carrera RS had the same calipers and
rotors as the '73 S (I don't know if the '73 RS had bigger brakes). That means
both Carreras have the same diameter rotors and the same size pads but the
Club Sport has thicker rotors. So, the 2700 lb. CS has better heat dissipation
than the 2200 lb. RS but less brake sweep area per pound. The CS weighs 23%
more than the RS. This is quite significant considering the sweep area.

Trond, get a grip!! What does autocrossing have to do with this discussion?
You have no clue because you think Porsche made improvements in the suspension
components over the course of time ('74-'89). This is not the case. The RS
had superior suspension when compared to any of the non-turbo '74 to '89
cars. I
never said the CS was lousy. I said it was no '73 Carrera RS. The CS is a nice
car just like any 911 from that era.

I don't quote curb weights. I said 2700 lbs. and guess what? That is how much
the car really weighs (actually more like 2714 lbs). I am not blind. I hold no
dislike for the CS. It is a fine car. It is not as nice as the '73 Carrera RS.

"Excellence Was Expected" has some charts showing different magazines testing
the RS. The 0-60 times varied quite a lot. At least one of the rags had a
zero to 60 time in the 5.7 second range. That means the 0-50 had to be in the
zero to 4.7 range (plus or minus a couple of tenths).

1.8l with NPR big bore kit rebuilt with 2000 miles on it
Weber conversion (the reason for its sale, no smog stuff)
flat front tires
dead battery
Engine hasn't turned over of own volition is 8+ months
Car is in storage lot 8 blocks from beach

I'm thinking of flying down to San Diego with a friend to pick up a '71 240Z

Now the questions:

Aside from the battery and new shoes, what else should I plan on acquiring
locally?

Can I just change the oil, drop in a new battery and go?

What is a good list of spares to take with me?

What other things should I check out before driving this car 1100 miles?

I am at the office so I do not have all of the stats in front of me, but I
recall reading a road test of the CS in excellence. It was a Carrera with
about 150 lbs removed and lighter exhaust valves to raise rpm by a few hundred.
We could go back an forth arguing about which is better. I have not owned or
driven either, but I do believe that the all knowing amorphous "MARKET" is
wise enough to determine the validity of a product. Scott is correct in that
the 911 suspension was changed very little from 73 to 89. The improvements on
the RS suspension were never matched in the later 911's. The RS ran like
hotcakes, sold like hotcakes then and now. The CS was lees car for more money
and never sold. If only 26 were sold it was due to demand, not supply. I recall
seeing many RS's raced. If the CS are such great performers, why do you NEVER
see one win anything. If it were a winner from a performance standpoint, the
price would not stop some folks. THe bottom line is that the RS was a winner
and the CS was not.

Interestingly, when this happens, if I restart while rolling by turning the

of the prior speed of travel, it may "stick" up when I eventually park, and
need to be manually retracted.   Hope we can get one of the list gurus to

Subject: Gray Market 911s


What is the general consensus on Gray Market 911s? I've seen two in the last
 week. One was a 1984 Targa with 65k miles (asking 14,900). It was in tough 
shape. I could not find most of the gears (maybe it me). The one I checked 
out tonight was a 1987 Targa with 72k miles (asking 18,000). In pretty good 
shape. Most everything worked. Body had only one ding on it. Engine seem
 very strong (from what I can tell). The clutch has been replace recently. It 
seemed like a good deal. 

TThe only real negatives were the oil tube were quite wet and the front trunk
was in disarray  (carpet was missing  there was some kind of electronic box
 in the front trunk). Also the VIN number tag was missing from the door
frame and the trunk area. I did find the riveted VIN number in the trunk which
had the "ZZZ" code.

I've read the section in the "Used 911 Buyers Guide" so I realize there is a lot
 to properly federalizing a 911. I wanted to know what kind of experiences
 people have had buying used gray market car. I plan on getting it checked
 out by a local Porsche shop but before I spring for that inspection I wanted
 to know if its just not worth the trouble.

I would have definitely bought the car if it was not a gray market model. However
I extremely apprehensive about going any further with this car.

Thank for any advice.

Jerry,

Regarding your 914 wiring, I had a look at the shop book tonight.

Problem #1: The porsche factory books I have only go to 1975, and the 
distributor points are listed as going to 21, 12, 22 in left to right 
order. Since you show 22|24, 12, 22|24, I cannot help you on this one. I 
might try 22, 12, 24, but then I might blow it up by mistake doing this too.

Problem #2: This looks pretty much like rear window defroster from your 
description and from the wiring pictures I see in the book, especially 
the comments about green and red/yellow...and the fact that your car has 
em and Scot's doesn't: it's one of the few optional parts. As my 
teenager says about everything: "Donnn't worrrry about it!"

Good luck with this.

Subject: 3.2 911 Stalling

For several months, my '85 911 has randomly quit, ran fine for weeks,
started again, etc.  Idle perfomance is fine; the stalling occurs at
operating load and temp.  Fuel filter is clean.  Changed the DME relay.
Re-seated all electrical Motoronic connectors.  Recently, it does it more
frequently and is hard to restart.  Doesn't sound like fuel - more like
ignition since it is all-on and all-off.  It's presently in a
Bosch-authorized shop and won't exhibit the fault, at least when test
equipment is connected.  Might be there a long time at this rate.

Any ideas?  Does PCNA ever advise on hard-to-troubleshoot intermittant
faults?  The shop has a handfull of Bosch advisories but, of course, none
apply to this problem.

The FI harness I am using is actually from a '70 1.7 D-jet engine, as a 
point of reference.  I talked to Brad Mayeur down in Illinois(who sold
me my current chassis and rebuilt my transaxle) - he is tracing one of
his harnesses tonight and is going to get back with me tomorrow.  I'll be
sure to post the result for posterity.

Yup.  I got two "rear window defroster" and one "heater blower motor"  It
*must* be for the defroster which explains the frayed ends and separate
(although small) harness.  As to the heater blower motor - I actually 
have two options - the '76 main engine harness has connections and so
does the secondary on the '70 - hmmm which one to use?  ;)

Put the swepco in the transaxle tonight(man, that stuff *stinks*) and had
better get her running soon(otherwise, Laura may change her mind about
marrying me - she's already wondering who I love more - her or the 914!)

Vacuum lines, ground straps, air cleaner(hey whats so bad about the oil

> What is the general consensus on Gray Market 911s? 

Well, that's a good one for the "it depends" section... I put about six
years and 100,000 KM on an '81 911SC that I picked up in Weissbaden, had 
federalized there, and shipped back to the US. All without incident.
On the other hand, I've seen cars imported whole and federalized here
that were just nightmares...

You don't know the half of it! It all depends on when the car was federalized
and who did the work. There was a *BRIEF* window in which very, very little
was required to federalize. The main rules involve DOT glass, seat belts,
and bumpers, plus aplicable EPA rules on emissions and local/state DMV
rules.

There are some *SERIOUS* advatages to the Euro spec cars, if the federalization
is done right. I kept (in fact, increased) the higher compression ratio
and compensated by using various 930 CIS components and custom recurving
the fuel distributor. Added an air pump, added a fake cat. Did some other
things best not talked about in a family publication. Wound up with about
250 HP instead of the 185 that a US spec car would have had. Also had
autobahn gearing, which meant low RPMs on the highway at the pathetic
US speed limits which was nice for gas milage, and meant that I could
just nearly nip 80 MPH in 2nd, which  had some serious autox advantages.

> I would have definitely bought the car if it was not a gray market model. However
> I extremely apprehensive about going any further with this car.

Here's my rule of thumb on this:

0) IS THE DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE??? If the answer is "no", then I'm probably
   going to give this a pass. In my case, the documentation included:

   last German title
   German bill of sale
   German statement of work on federalization
   translations of the above
   certificate that the translater was competent before the TuV to make such
   	translations
   shipping papers
   port of entry papers
   affidavit of physical inspection by Texas DMV
   certificate of compliance by the EPA
   certificate of compliance by the DOT
   original title application for non-titled car
   Texas title

   Now, in theory, all you *NEED* is the US title. However, if you ever get
   a visit from the EPA or DOT bearing a court order for a new inspection,
   it's *DAMN* handy to have the original paperwork... It's also very
   handy when your insurance company says that they can't insure the
   car because it's not US spec. At minimum, I'd want the EPA and DOT
   paperwork and I'd want to know who did the federalization and when.

1) what does my insurance company think. If this is going to give them gas,
   I'd like to know about it sooner rather than later. In my case, I used
   State Farm and had no trouble except needing to FAX them the document
   kit about every other year as some newbie would decide that my car was 
   all of a sudden a big problem.

2) what does my mechanic think. If you can get someone that can work on the
   car based on what it *IS* rather than what it's *SUPPOSED TO BE* (i.e.
   HINT: you can *NOT* tune up a somewhat modified Euro 911SC to US 911SC
   specs...) then you're OK.  Then again, this might be that excuse to
   really find a good wrench...

3) what do *I* think. In my case, the car was such a good deal that there was
   no way I could pass it up. DM 14,500 at a time when that would just about
   cover a trip to McDonalds... Today? I dunno.  I liked the extra power,
   I liked the funky Op Art velour upholstry that it had, and being in the biz
   kept having to custom engineer CIS repairs based on available parts
   from being too bad. I disliked the fact that nothing was easy, that it 
   was *NOT* a stock class car by the PCRs, and that some of the things on
   the car I had to obtain from Europe via the Porschephiles Buying Network.

Bottom line: there's nothing *wrong* with having a Euro car, some things
very *right* about doing so. But it's an individual choice, as are most
things...

Subject: RE: Lap welds vs. butt welds



Pete,

I'll probably be the only person responding to say that a lap weld
can be better than a butt weld in this case. Here are the issues:

A lap weld leaves a seam that can wick in water and cause rust,
however a good body shop will coat the weld seam with zinc paste
which can be welded through and will "heal" to rust-protect the seam.
The factory uses *many* lap welds and they're generally fine.

A butt weld (or even hammer weld) is better if you can grind down both
sides and check for holes. It requires exact fittment of the panels to
keep from blowing through, and as an added precaution, I usually place
a piece of steel behind the seam I'm welding to absorb extra heat. If
you try to fill too wide a gap (> 1/8") you really make a mess. The 
back of the weld is going to be stalactites of weld, wire, and dripping
metal which in my opinion will attract rust more than a seam.

The welding process alone seems to change the carbon content in the 
weld area and make it more prone to rust. The zinc you can get into a
lap weld will help to prevent heat-related rust, where in a butt weld
even if you coat the back with zinc, most of it will burn away for 1/2"
on either side of the weld.

As I said, mine will probably be a minority opinion - so take it for
what it's worth. I'm currently replacing wheel arches and rockers on
an Alfa spider using the flange method.

Thank Bog, someone finally addressed the *real* problem.  I thought I
might have to put up a post to sort it all out.  

So:  Park *isn't supposed* to be at the bottom?  I've been playing with
mine for a long while cause they park about an inch or two high off
the bottom position (which I was always assuming to be the correct
park position).  Since I like them low and out of the way I usually 
just do the old "manual park" by timing the downstroke.  Got real good
at it too.  

I still wish there were some way my wipers would park at the bottom
when I shut them off.  I am not overly concerned about start up strain
as I use these wipers so infrequently and try to keep them clen.

FYI my car is a 66 912.  Does this mean I have the welded style?
My spare parts catalog doesn't show this.  How did you find out 
the wipers were engineered to park high?  Hopefully not off some
mechanic that could not make them park in their rightful place.

Hello:

I am considering buying my first 911 and would appreciate any input
you can give me.  The car I am considering is a 80 911 Targa with 114K
miles on it.  The asking price is $14K.  I know I can get the guy down
to about $13k.  I am having an inspection done tomorrow to see if
there is anything obviously wrong with the car.  The inspection will
be the full 9 yards (compression test, body examination, etc).

The car hasn't had any modifications done to it (ie no Carrera Chain
tensioners...) but appears to be in good shape.  The Car has been
repainted but it appears to have been well done.  Targa top was
refinished last year and the car has had a new condensor installed for
the AC.  Currently is under the 2nd owner, he has had the car for at
least 4 years.  Has put about 12K miles on the car, and has not
replaced the clutch.  Don't know if it was replaced by the previous
owner.  Interior looks good, but not immaculate.

The prices I have seen thus far for 911s seem to be all over the
place.  Hemmings Motor News shows 911s in this same year running from
10K-25K.  My Blue Book shows the price being around $16K.  Locally not
many 911s have been for sale in my price range (under $15K) so I don't
have numerous examples to compare it to.

What would your advice to a first time Porsche buyer be?  Should I
consider this car further or walk away and search some more?  I am
asking for trouble with the high milage and (Gulp...) unknown clutch?

To cut down on unwanted bandwidth you can contact me directly.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yupp, and that seem to be the major drawback for the car,..maybe this is
where they missed then. Too heavy. The rest of the car seem potent. I did
not find the AutoMotor und Sport test from 87/88, but my basement has a
*lot* of car mags, but I'll find it.

Sticking to the facts as provided by different sources the CS had top speed
at 154mph, and 0-60 in 5.1, test drivers liked it and noted a significant,
but not brutal, difference from the carrera. If it was the hollow valve
stems, the modifications to the DME(?), or the 110 lbs less, wasn't stated.
Based on those criteria's I think it was a car with potential,.....as I
said, modifications for the States may have killed off a good thing!?

>>>Brakes got bigger because the cars got heavier and heavier. You clearly have
>>>no clue in this regard.
There are some facts you may have forgotten here,....material improvements
which can lead to better heat transfer from a hot disc, improved
calipers....improvements to the hydraulic system(brakes) etc. I do actually
understand that bigger brakes are neded for heavier cars, comparing brake
distances and tendency to fade on a track would be the only way to determine
whether RS or CS are better off on brake side.

>zero to 60 time in the 5.7 second range. That means the 0-50 had to be in the

Read above, this was a typo from my side, it is *0-60* in 5.1 seconds, that
leaves the Carrera RS 0.5 seconds slower from 0 to 60.

>>Yes, and it is here such things as weight distribution, drag, braking power,

>Thanks for making my point!!

I don't think this speaks for the Carrera RS and against the CS, 

Positive racing attributes for the CS;(contra RS)
**************************************
 -Straight acceleration dominance, (a *big* plus out of curves, 0.5 a second
to 60, 2 seconds to 90)
 -The better cd values will give higher top speed at straights, and overall
less restriction 
 -Higher top speed ( 151-154mph )
 -Better spoilers rear and behind will increase downforce = higher curve
speeds! (better grip too!)

Possible negative attributes;
*****************************
 -Too soft suspension (not documented so far....)
 -Brakes (but a standard post '84 Carrera will not fade under *HEAVY* assault
at Nurburgring   old slope,...'Auto  Motor und  Sport' test against the
928S4 SOMETIME IN '86-'87,..i might dig it   up...W.Roerhl drove?)
 -Too heavy (but it outaccelerates the RS in all aspects)


I would love to read a comparison test, someone must have done this back in
'88 when the CS was launched as the successor of the RS. 

....maybe it is the heat  :)

The Carrera was developed all the way, since the car was almost right in '88
only small modifications needed to make it more sporty was needed for the CS.

Things have changed too, in '73 there were no 300ZX, Supra's, Stealth's,
NSX, most manufacturers made economy cars, smogged their V8's, the Carrera
RS was just anti all that. And it was great!

Your point is not what we're discussing! We're not speaking of winners or
loosers here, merely performance fo a given car.

The CS lost out somewhere, but that does *NOT* change the facts;

It outaccelerates the RS in all cathegories.
It has a higher top speed.
It has better cd.
It has Carrera brakes,...which is as good as you normally get them.
It has more engine power.

*THAT* is what this discussionis about.

Subject: Help with 911 buying decision

Hello:

I am considering buying my first 911 and would appreciate any input
you can give me.  The car I am considering is a 80 911 Targa with 114K
miles on it.  The asking price is $14K.  I know I can get the guy down
to about $13k.  I am having an inspection done tomorrow to see if
there is anything obviously wrong with the car.  The inspection will
be the full 9 yards (compression test, body examination, etc).

The car hasn't had any modifications done to it (ie no Carrera Chain
tensioners...) but appears to be in good shape.  The Car has been
repainted but it appears to have been well done.  Targa top was
refinished last year and the car has had a new condensor installed for
the AC.  Currently is under the 2nd owner, he has had the car for at
least 4 years.  Has put about 12K miles on the car, and has not
replaced the clutch.  Don't know if it was replaced by the previous
owner.  Interior looks good, but not immaculate.

The prices I have seen thus far for 911s seem to be all over the
place.  Hemmings Motor News shows 911s in this same year running from
10K-25K.  My Blue Book shows the price being around $16K.  Locally not
many 911s have been for sale in my price range (under $15K) so I don't
have numerous examples to compare it to.

What would your advice to a first time Porsche buyer be?  Should I
consider this car further or walk away and search some more?  I am
asking for trouble with the high milage and (Gulp...) unknown clutch?

To cut down on unwanted bandwidth you can contact me directly.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Ross Sabolcik
(Hopefully a future Porsche owner)

Scott,

>than the 2200 lb. RS but less brake sweep area per pound. The CS weighs 23%
>more than the RS. This is quite significant considering the sweep area.

Yupp, and that seem to be the major drawback for the car,..maybe this is
where they missed then. Too heavy. The rest of the car seem potent. I did
not find the AutoMotor und Sport test from 87/88, but my basement has a
*lot* of car mags, but I'll find it.

Sticking to the facts as provided by different sources the CS had top speed
at 154mph, and 0-60 in 5.1, test drivers liked it and noted a significant,
but not brutal, difference from the carrera. If it was the hollow valve
stems, the modifications to the DME(?), or the 110 lbs less, wasn't stated.
Based on those criteria's I think it was a car with potential,.....as I
said, modifications for the States may have killed off a good thing!?

>>>Brakes got bigger because the cars got heavier and heavier. You clearly have
>>>no clue in this regard.
There are some facts you may have forgotten here,....material improvements
which can lead to better heat transfer from a hot disc, improved
calipers....improvements to the hydraulic system(brakes) etc. I do actually
understand that bigger brakes are neded for heavier cars, comparing brake
distances and tendency to fade on a track would be the only way to determine
whether RS or CS are better off on brake side.

>zero to 60 time in the 5.7 second range. That means the 0-50 had to be in the
>zero to 4.7 range (plus or minus a couple of tenths).
Read above, this was a typo from my side, it is *0-60* in 5.1 seconds, that
leaves the Carrera RS 0.5 seconds slower from 0 to 60.

>>Yes, and it is here such things as weight distribution, drag, braking power,
>>body roll, aerodynamics, engine power is important!
>
>Thanks for making my point!!

I don't think this speaks for the Carrera RS and against the CS, 

Positive racing attributes for the CS;(contra RS)
**************************************
 -Straight acceleration dominance, (a *big* plus out of curves, 0.5 a second
to 60, 2 seconds to 90)
 -The better cd values will give higher top speed at straights, and overall
less restriction 
 -Higher top speed ( 151-154mph )
 -Better spoilers rear and behind will increase downforce = higher curve
speeds! (better grip too!)

Possible negative attributes;
*****************************
 -Too soft suspension (not documented so far....)
 -Brakes (but a standard post '84 Carrera will not fade under *HEAVY* assault
at Nurburgring   old slope,...'Auto  Motor und  Sport' test against the
928S4 SOMETIME IN '86-'87,..i might dig it   up...W.Roerhl drove?)
 -Too heavy (but it outaccelerates the RS in all aspects)


I would love to read a comparison test, someone must have done this back in
'88 when the CS was launched as the successor of the RS. 

....maybe it is the heat  :)

I think you delivered the *ultimate* comment to your mechanic
on the list.  You said he is "willing to explain things in detail if
you ask him".   I do all my own work and therefore have no 
need for a mechanic.  However, I sometimes have need of a
doctor.  I will never again submit to any procedure unless the
physician is "willing to explain things in detail if you ask him".

If the guy can't explain things to me, to my satisfaction, in plain
language (I don't consider myself some sort of dumbass), it makes
me wonder how well *HE* understands the procedure.  Things I
understand *I* can explain, even to the uninitiated.

I wish everyone was held to this standard.*

Mike Piera AnalogMike@aol.com
'72S and '73E Targas, '73 914/2.0 (last two for sale soon)



	Three-Wheeling by Mike Piera			7/95

	Setting up a Porsche for stock class autocrossing : part 7

	In the first part of this series we put the car into the best possible
	condition for autocrossing without really modifying anything. Then we
	added the best wheels and tires in the second part. Now we will look
	at some items which can add even more improvements and still keep the
	car in stock class and allow the car to be driven on the street.

	There are several factory options that can make a big difference in
	autocross times. If any "sport suspension" package of springs (or 
	torsion bars) and/or sway bars was available for your year and model,
	it should be added. A factory Limited-Slip differential should be
	added to any front-engined Porsche if you are at all serious about
	winning. A limited slip can be used on a 911, but it is not
	cost-effective to add and may promote understeer. Judicious use of the
	throttle is much cheaper and may make you a better driver at the same
	time. Factory cloth sport seats should be added if they were available.
	They are lighter than standard seats, provide more "rear-end feedback",
	and will make you more comfortable while competing. 

	Any '85- 911 owner should order a FACTORY short-shifter kit TODAY if
	you don't already have one. They greatly improve the shift action and
	do not make it more difficult to shift on the street. They are also
	great on the earlier cars, but not legal in SCCA Stock because Porsche
	did not offer them until '85. Also any optional spoilers should be
	added (unless you are of the type who think they "spoil" the 
	appearance of your car). The small added weight should be more than 
	offset by the small handling improvements. 

	There are also some factory options to avoid. On any car
	with optional (not standard) air-conditioning, the compressor can be
	removed. The compressor is heavy in exactly the wrong part of the car,
	and can be re-installed if needed. Any other OPTIONS which add
	weight should be removed.

	The stock Porsche mufflers are quite efficient but tend to be heavy.
	SuperTrapp disk-type mufflers can be used to save weight and allow
	tuning of the back pressure. The exhaust gases pass around the
	disks and are dispersed to reduce noise level. Removing disks
	adds back-pressure and reduces noise level. Adding disks does the
	opposite. And it is very easy to remove all disks and run a basically
	open exhaust if it is legal at the event site. Changing the number of
	disks may alter the fuel mixture and torque characteristics of your
	engine, though. The street versions use a fiberglass-pack before the
	disks to further reduce the noise. On a car like a 944 turbo with
	catalytic converter (both the turbo and "cat" act as mufflers) the
	'glass-pack version may not be necessary. But even with the glass-pack,
	a 911 may be too loud for street driving. Most SuperTrapps do not come
	in an easy, bolt-on kit for Porsches, but a flange can be welded-on to
	make it bolt on. On some Porsches, like the Carrera 2 and 4, one or
	both of the stock mufflers can be "bypassed" with bolt-on bypass tubes
	which are readily available. This should be an easy way to lose weight
	and add a few horsepower.

	A larger front sway bar should be added to most stock-class Porsches.
	Get an adjustable version if possible. It is not legal in SCCA to use an
	adjustable early style though-the-body front bar on a late model 911
	because of the holes needed to mount it in a different position. But
	the '74-85 911 can use an '86-89 stock front bar which is bigger,
	inexpensive (from Porsche recyclers) and easy to install. A 944 can
	try a 944 turbo bar if cost is important, or an aftermarket adjustable
	bar. The hot setup would be an adjustable hollow bar, which is much
	lighter and almost as stiff as a solid bar of the same diameter. But
	be careful of stiff front sway bars on a 924/944 with steel a-arms,
	as they tend to break the mounts and can cause accidents. An
	early (pre-74) 911, 914 or 914-6 will handle great with a 19mm
	adjustable front sway bar. The H & H bar is inexpensive and reliable.

	A leather shift-knob can actually help fast shifting in an autocross
	situation. I have bruised my hand on stock hard plastic knobs while
	panic shifting. On an older Porsche, the shifter bushings should be
	replaced with new ones to further aid in precise shifting. A 1" 
	smaller diameter sport steering wheel like one of the various Momo
	models is an advantage. It will allow faster steering and more
	clearance around the legs and door for wild-flying hands. 
	Stay away from the aftermarket chips, which are illegal anyway in
	stock classes and are mostly "cash flow devices".

	The biggest improvement can be made by correctly balancing the handling
	characteristics of over/understeer (The definition of understeer is
	when the driver is scared, oversteer is when the passenger is scared).
	This balancing is done on a stock class car by adjusting the front
	sway bar, or by changing tire pressures or suspension alignment
	settings. Some drivers thrren)

	settings. Some drivers think a slightly oversteering car is fastest.
	But actually a SLIGHT understeer condition is usually fastest, if not
	quite as much fun. Also, a slightly understeering car will be faster
	in a slalom. When driving at 99% of the car's limits, you will
	be forced to go to 101% occasionally. If your car oversteers you
	will spin-out, or lose time when the rear end of the car comes out.

	To reduce excessive understeer the following can be done. Start with
	the first items which are easy to try one at a time at an event.
	If it is still not enough, try the later items.

	TO REDUCE UNDERSTEER :

	Change the front or rear tire pressures *
	Loosen the front sway bar (try small 1/4" increments)
	Try a larger tire or wheel width on the front if possible
	Add more negative camber in front (or less negative camber in rear)
	Add some front toe-out (or decrease rear toe-in)

	* Which way do you change tire pressures for more grip? 
	Normally you raise them. But with the new BFGs, if you are already
	at a fairly high pressure, lowering them may make them stick better.
	To reduce understeer, change the front pressures for more grip,
	or the rear pressures for less grip.

	TO REDUCE OVERSTEER, try the following :

	Change the front or rear tire pressures *
	Tighten the front sway bar (try small 1/4" increments)
	Try a larger tire or wheel width on the rear if possible.
	Add more negative camber in rear (or less negative camber in front)
	Add some rear toe-in (or decrease front toe-out)

	Note that in VERY slow corners, almost all cars will understeer, and
	this can not be tuned out. Using first gear may help, and slowing down
	enough so you can make it through and accelerate out is the best
	solution.

Hi all,

My heater and blower are kaput.  I have the Haynes manual but no info 
in there on the heater or blower.  The heater does not work at all, 
and the blower fan barely blows any air out of the vents, even on the 
fastest setting.  Where do I start to troubleshoot?

Any advice would be useful.

Subject: Toe in or not to toe in....

To all:

I was at the alignment shop yesterday to finally get the four wheel
alignment that I desprately needed but it was to late....the insides of my
front tires are worn far beyond spec. Between that and the fact that my tie
rod ends are on there way to being shot I decided that it was not the best
to complete the alignment until these items have been rectified.

The question that I have for the list came up in the discussion with the
fellow who was trying to find the specs for my car to complete the
alignment. My drivers manual specs 0 toe in, the alignment shops specs said
0 toe in, but the Ray Scruggs guide to home alignment in his suggested specs
he would like 1/8" toe in...Does anyone have any opinions on this or has
specs of there own that they could post? I don't race the car, I just put a
lot of highway miles on my car each day....

Different models had ABS in different years.  Our 87 944T has ABS, and the
suspension was changed between 86 and 87 to accomodate it on 944s. 911's
didn't get it until the C4 came out (year?) then the C2, because of the
earlier 911 suspension design.  Don't know when the 928 got it. Of course,
the 959 had it, if you want to talk semi-production, non-US cars!

Subject: A/C problem on 928



  First let me express my thanks to all who gave me advise on shocks 
and tires for my 928.

  I have recently found that when I turn on the fan or the A/C I am 
getting hot air blown on the side vents. The air on the center vents
is not as hot. 
  I had the car checked before buying it and the mechanic found that 
the air volume would decrease if the car was accelerated hard and he
had the fan on high. He told me it was probably one of the boxes that
control the flaps for routing the air coming out of the A/C or a hose 
that had a vaccum leak. I guess it has deteriorated even more because 
this hot air problem was not there two days ago. I have also noticed 
the cruise control acts up sometimes, specially if I put the A/C on 
defrost...again vacumm leak. 
   Does anyone know where the control "boxes" are and how hard they
are to get to (do we have to take apart the dash?). Also how do I find
out which one is it that needs replacing. 

   The temperature is already 90 degrees in Florida so I don't need any
more heat and the workshop manuals are on back order...help!

Thanks

About double messages;
Didn't strike you I cc'ed the list? If you wanna do something about this

a discussion about it. I wouldn't mind.

I wish people read messages before they spoke,......again.....'best or

Never said so, if you wanna jump in the middle of a discussion,...fine,..but
better see to that you know what is discussed. Don't just comment when you
don't have a clue.

Story so far...,CS was a followup to the RS, fluked, but still has better

the '73 version in '88 when it was launched.

Does anyone have any experience with putting a front oil cooler on a 2.7

Kansas City.  Driving home through traffic heated up the old engine quite a
bit (it was at 250).  I've been thinking about a front oil cooler and
wondered if anyone had any recommendations.  The one I saw in the Automotion
catalog was $1300 with a mounting kit.  They also had some other coolers
that were called "Deluxe oil coolers."  They ranged from $135 to $200.  I
don't think they came with hookups and a mounting kit, etc.  Can I put one
of these in my car?  $200 sounds a lot better than $1300.  What other kind

Your lucky - in the UK wipers wear out in months - I get thru 2 or 3 sets 
a year. There is rarely a day when I don't use them, spring and autumn it 
rains most days, in the winter we have salt/water on the roads and in 
summer, we always have heavy dews, and I need them to scrape clear patches 
among the bugs.

I have often thought of fitting tear off selophane strips to my screen!!

I've seen both mirrors on other cars.  I'm assumed that the right side
mirror was an option.

When I got my car, it had aftermarket mirrors on both sides.  They
look like they were both installed in the locations provided by the
factory (i.e., an access hole on the inside to get at the bolts you
have to tighten), but they were of a design that made the right side
mirror impossible to use, because it was completely blocked by the 
"A" pillar.  The original equipment mirrors look like they are
positioned toward the back of the mounting bracket, so you can
actually use the right-hand one.  The round mirrors from the '69
vintage cars, the ones I have on the car now, are similarly positioned
toward the back of the mounting bracket, but I'd like to get the
"correct" mirrors for the car.

Miq,

I'll leave your _fastener_ question to Stan.  I just got back from a 1200 mile 
trip in my brand "new" 73 1.7 ($700).  Course it took about $2K to get it to 
where it was "safe" to drive without dropping a trailing arm.  2 days, no 
copilot, no stereo; just the hum of the flat IV and the top off.  Kickass!

What I brought (after much advice from the list) in no particular order:

Big flashlight (which was key when the pin holding my throttle pedal worked its 
way out at 2 a.m. in the rain)
Fuses 8 and 25 amp
Fire Extinguisher (oil/fire; I think SCCA or PCA are going away from Halon)
Hoses and clamps
Utility knife
Oil
Brake fluid (DOT 4)
Clutch and throttle cables
Spare plugs & ignition wires
Rags
Duct tape
Jumper cables
Jack & blocks
Rain-X (real lifesaver with those teeny wipers; also brought anti-fog for 
inside)
Basic tools

I'm sure there's other stuff that would be useful to have along but that's what 
I brought.

Good luck, and may the Porsche be with you!

ink a slightly oversteering car is fastest.
	But actually a SLIGHT understeer condition is usually fastest, if not
	quite as much fun. Also, a slightly understeering car will be faster
	in a slalom. When driving at 99% of the car's limits, you will
	be forced to go to 101% occasionally. If your car oversteers you
	will spin-out, or lose time when the rear end of the car comes out.

	To reduce excessive understeer the following can be done. Start with
	the first items which are easy to try one at a time at an event.
	If it is still not enough, try the later items.

	TO REDUCE UNDERSTEER :

	Change the front or rear tire pressures *
	Loosen the front sway bar (try small 1/4" increments)

	Add more negative camber in front (or less negative camber in rear)

	* Which way do you change tire pressures for more grip?

	To reduce understeer, change the front pressures for more grip,

	Tighten the front sway bar (try small 1/4" increments)
	Try a larger tire or wheel width on the rear if possible.
	Add more negative camber in rear (or less negative camber in front)
	Add some rear toe-in (or decrease front toe-out)

	Note that in VERY slow corners, almost all cars will understeer, and
	this can not be tuned out. Using first gear may help, and slowing down
	enough so you can make it through and accelerate out is the best
	solution.

Subject: Toe in or not to toe in....

To all:

I was at the alignment shop yesterday to finally get the four wheel
alignment that I desprately needed but it was to late....the insides of my
front tires are worn far beyond spec. Between that and the fact that my tie
rod ends are on there way to being shot I decided that it was not the best
to complete the alignment until these items have been rectified.

The question that I have for the list came up in the discussion with the
fellow who was trying to find the specs for my car to complete the
alignment. My drivers manual specs 0 toe in, the alignment shops specs said
0 toe in, but the Ray Scruggs guide to home alignment in his suggested specs
he would like 1/8" toe in...Does anyone have any opinions on this or has
specs of there own that they could post? I don't race the car, I just put a
lot of highway miles on my car each day....

I just looked up the wight of '88 Carrera Euro version. 1210 kilo, then the
CS is 1160 kilo. (2555lb)
If we then divide the 2555 lb with 231 HP what we get is 11.06HP/kilo,
however everyone know that the engine's torque is even more important! Do
you have these ratings?

This has worked for me on everything from a 356B to a 911SC:  simply 
remove the wiper assembly and put it back on in the position you want the 
blades to rest.  You have to take off the cover over the large nut that 
holds each blade assembly on with some models, other models don't have 
the cover.  The assembly attaches to the motor via a splined male/female 
attachment, so just moving the assembly one or two splines down will 
usually be enough to have the wiper blades rest just at the windshield 
molding.  The downside of this is that the blades become deformed easily, 
as they are not resting on a flat surface anymore but rather partially on 
the windshield and partially off.  If you don't use them frequently, this 
could be a problem (it isn't here, where we have about 130 inches of rain 
per year).

You know your Porsche won't let you down but with kids, hell, it's a rolling

Text item: 911 clicking and groaning




  Greeting P-philes:
  I'm looking for some assistance to diagnose two early/potential problems
  on my '84 911 Carrera.  Car is still driveable, but I want to fix these
  before something bad happens (to the car, myself, or others).

  Symptom: Hear faint clicking from left rear wheel while driving.
  Intermittent, possibly independent of wheel speed, though I think it
  occurs at all speeds (road noise prevents me from hearing it at higher
  speeds).
  Cause: CV joint ???
  Fix: If CV joint - repack :-)? or replace :-(?

  Symptom: When slowing to a stop (coasting the last few feet) with foot
  off brake/gas/clutch, a *groan* is emitted from the front wheel(s).  Once
  again, very intermittent, usually occurs after have been driving a while.
  Tapping the brakes may or may not make the sound go away.  Feel a slight
  shudder through the steering wheel.  Occurs more often when I turn the
  wheels, such as coasting into my driveway, though also happens on
  straight stops, like coasting into my garage or up to a stop sign/light.
  Cause:  Frozen piston :-)???, warped rotor :-(???
  Fix: ?

  Any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Want to make sure
  the baby is in good shape for the Parade here in  sunny (this week,
  anyway) Portland.

Subject: RE: Oil coolers

Have done both ways:  Complete kit (Terbatrol, purchased direct, lots less
than $1300) in 77 Targa; piece parts in Porsche-engined Vanagon, including
the Automotion oil cooler.  Piece parts approach gets expensive in time
and dollars as you need the right hoses made up and you also need a 
thermostat.  Thermostat is also in the Automotion catalog.  Hoses are not;
I went to a hydraulic supply place after confirming that they had metric
fittings, which not all do.  Hoses for the Vanagon (about 15' long each way)
were $200, but they used VERY nice cadmium plated fittings that are
probably dissipating as much heat as the cooler itself.  You need four
hoses, two short (engine and oil tank to thermostat) and two long (thermo-
stat to front cooler and back).

Both cars are happy with their coolers; in your situation I would get the
Terbatrol without hesitation, unless I could steal a complete stock setup
including the "hard lines" (pipes) that Porsche uses, at a swap meet.
If you do the piece parts approach you have to measure things and do a
bunch of planning and purchasing that the Terbatrol people have already 
done.

Good luck either way.

Subject: More on Club Sports...

Hey,

I just found an article in the 1989 Road & Track "Special Series"
booklet on Porsche in which Paul Frere tests a European 911 Club
Sport.

I don't mean to add any fuel to this fire, but here are some
interesting things :

1.  It did not have paint work similar to the '73 RSs.  It has the same
     decal on the left front fender as the US model.  It appears to be
     devoid of any other markings.

2.  Power was unchanged from the standard Carrera - 231hp/207lb-ft
     (we already knew that).

3.  It says that the hollow valves and firmer shocks were the only changes.
     (aside from deleting a bunch of stuff).

4.  The car was 220lbs lighter than a *fully equipped* standard Carrera.  It
     was only 110-120lbs lighter than the base version.

5.  It says that the particular test car he drove was shod with 6x16 and
     8x16 wheels with the normal 205/55s and 225/50s F/R.

6.  0-60 was 5.3 sec, with a top speed of 154.3mph.

Unfortunately, that's about it.  The article was more of a "review" than
a road test.  It was a Euro car for sure, though and had no "Carrera" script
or lettering on the sides, etc.

I personally thought it was good idea when it came out, but IMO it was
more of a marketing ploy, where the '73 RS conceived *purely* with
competition in mind.

I'd gladly take either one...

FWIW, I have a 77 911S also (my 2.7 was as bad as everyone says ;-( so I

put a Terbetrol (sp?) on.  It was around $800 if I remember correctly and it

as my setup was a little different. But they sent the other promptly (within

These coolers are advertised in Excellence and I think Pano.  I recommend
them if the price fits your budget.

Subject: 911/914/6 Aircleaners, etc.


I've owned both the carburated 914/6 and the MFI 911. My findings were 
thus:

When on the track, the K&Ns worked very well. On the street, the MFI had
a few stumble problems and the carbs had crud get into the air 
correction jets. I went back to the paper element and the problems went 
away. The K&Ns pass more air and do a more than adequate job for the 
track. Paper does a better filtration job but is slightly more 
restrictive as a result.

When running either, inspect on a regular basis, clean or replace when 
they get clogged.

For the MFI, the 72-73 cars have a connection to the heat exchanger for 
passing warm air to the engine. This unit works interactively at all 
times improving driveability. If you have the rubber connection boot 
removed, consider replacing it. Inspect the driver's side (left) heat
exchanger for holes or damage that would keep the exchanger from warming the intake air. The down side is that the inlet is not filtered air at that point. I have added flexible tubing and run a hose to the top side 
of the engine sheet metal to reduce the road grunge pulled through the 
air warmer section. 

Many Porsche enthusiasts do not consider the pre 1974 911 engine to be 
a "smog" engine, yet it was for the US market. All of the little pieces 
of hardware are required for the California visual inspection each time 
you get a certificate for registration purposes. If you aren't sure 
about what is required, the California Air Resources Board has a manual
that has each model listed and each iteration, yearly or model, 
specifically described or pictured. There are some fine points for a 
split year, such as the 1973 911T which had both MFI and CIS in the same 
model year.

Technically, unless K&N has a CARB exemption for the aircleaner element, 
a non-paper element can fail you. The better inspection stations treat 
this as a direct replacement part. The lower restriction can alter the 
flow characteristics enough to make adjustment difficult. As much as I 
like to tinker, I always had to return the 914/6 carbs back to stock  
configuration to pass the bi-annual inspection. They just wouldn't come 
close to passing otherwise. And of course I returned them to my favorite
configuration afterwards.

The early K&N for carb and MFI had a straight plat for the top and a 
machined plate for the bottom. In either the 911 0r 914/6 water could 
(and did) go down the carbs causing other problems. They quickly came up with the hooded solution we now can purchase. These work well except on 
the '73 MFI. On the MFI cars, I use the round type cleaner in the stock 
housing. Some of the ancient Mercedes used the same round filter.

With all due respect, I'd caution against this.  The wiper's constant
hitting of the windshield rubber and molding will cause scars, plus
undue wear on the wiper blade.  Remember, that in the heat of action,
a wiper will exceed its path by a little bit each time as it changes
direction.  That's why there's clearance in the first place.

At the risk of keeping this contest going a bit more, I'll add the following.

When you (collective) say 231 HP for the Euro spec model do you mean SAE or 
DIN?  I know, for example, that my Euro spec '82 SC is listed as 204 hp DIN in 
the owners manual while the same year US spec is listed (I believe) as 180 hp 
SAE.  This does NOT mean that mine has 24 hp SAE more than my US counterparts.  
The SAE hp difference is a bunch (measurable anyways) less than that.

Perhaps you (collective again) could be specific about what scale you are 
referring to when discussing things like this.

But what's up with this description on that page: 

"If the frequency is not an authorized police frequency, the INTERCEPTOR
sends back a signal at low power. That signal simulates a vehicle rapidly
decelerating or accelerating to phenomenal speeds so the radar gun dismisses
it as an error. This occurs rapidly and alerts you to the presence of radar
with an adjustable tone and warning lights. Since the radar gun's target
speed reading is blank, you have all the time you need to adjust your speed."

Does it leave you naked to *authorized* frequencies, or are they just

I'm new to this list and have enjoyed the ramblings about the 73 RS and

Are we comparing apples-to-apples with these two cars.  If I'm not 
mistaken, wasn't the '88 CS a light weight version (without even a sun 
visor) designed to appeal, hopefully, to Porschephiles that thought AC, 
etc. was evil?  It failed in this regard because there was really no 
performance advantage over the '88 Carrera (loaded) and sold for the same 
price, a marketing disaster.  What does this have anything to do with 
the '73 RS?  I'm sure the Club Sport on it's own is a very good car.  
It may have more in common with '92 RS America than a '73 RS....

Boy! does George B. speak the truth on this one. 

Bought my '83 944 w/ 78K on it.  Did lots of maintenance including the belts
which I tensioned by eyeball. 

I was lucky!!!

Within about 15K I started hearing a metallic tapping coming from the upper
balance shaft's rear bearing.  To make a long story short, I had over
tightened the bal belt.  After completely replacing the bearings, belts,
seals, races, etc, etc.    I broke down and purchased the 9201 gauge (which
George B. graciously instructed me how to use).  It's very expensive, but not
nearly as much as the noises your engine will produce if (read *when*) you
have a belt break due to incorrect tensioning.  The interesting thing is that
the tension I had set by eyeball was too loose on the cam belt and way too
tight on the balance shaft belts even though they *eyeballed* about the same.

Your choices:

Either pay the mechanic, take the chance (not recommended), buy the gauge, or
*rent* it from me.

I was going to go with 0 toe in on the front for my alignment but Galen
Bridges  (Porsche mechanic in Atlanta) has talked me out of it. (My
recollection of) His rationale was that ANY toe out was not good for
stability at speed and that the tie rod ends can give enough to create toe
out if they are set up for 0 toe at rest.He recommends a slight toe in.

If you have to replace the tie rod ends anyway, the turbo style tie rod ends
are stiffer and will not give as much. IMVHO I'd use them.  My car will have
1/8"-1/10" toe in when I get it back as well as turbo style tie rods. I'll
let you know how it works later if you like.

Perhaps I was unclear in my original post, as I have received two 
messages cautioning against what I recommended.  As I said before, I have 
done this for three different Porsches, and it worked on all three.  It 
is a trial and error procedure, and you have to adjust it so that the 
park position is satisfactory and the extreme downward (to the left) 
sweep does not hit the windshield trim.  It can be done.  My park 
position is about two inches above the molding and the extreme downward 
sweep does not quite hit the rubber molding.  It may well be that certain 
models have greater differences between the two positions than others, 
but I doubt it.  Try it - it's a lot easier than putting in a new motor 
or reversing the current one.

Subject: 73.5 911T CIS Conundrum

I am new to porschephiles so please go easy on my ignorance.

Here is my problem:

I have a 73.5 CIS 911T with many of the S options.  The car has 50,000 original
miles and has been kept in very good condition.  However I have been having
severe problems with cold starts and backfiring.  The mechanic I took the 
car to for major service shortly after I purchased it (about a month ago)
sez the problem lies in the CIS.  The airbox has a popoff valve that has
blow at least once, so it looks like the problem has occured before.  He
said they could slowly replace various pieces of the system and I might
be able to get out for a few hundred dollars or of as much as a $1000 but
he suggested replacing the CIS with dual weber carbs (new).  He quoted the 
work at about $1800 total which sounds steep to me.  He also said a third 
option would be to fit it with an EFI system but that would cost even more
in parts and labor.  I trust the compentency of the mechanics but I 
do not trust their pricing.  My question is what to do and how much 
should it cost for each solution.  What are the pros/cons of each   
solution.

My only concern about moving to dual carbs is the fact that the car
is about as straight as they come.  The mechanics assured me that it
could be converted back if need be if for some reason I sold it and
the buyer wanted it straight.

Any constructive insight will be gratefully received.

Where did this load of dog doo come from? The Carrera was developed almost

The CS is a production car with less weight. The RS is a race car sold as a

Much of the acceleration issue can be attributed to the tire quality
difference between '73 and '88.

3MPH is nothing when comparing top speeds. This is mostly irrelavent.

Better cd? So? How much better and what is the frontal area that cd is
calculated against? There is more to wind resistance than cd!

The '73 RS brakes are at least as good.

More engine power and more weight. Pound for pound the RS has more
power.

Looks like the RS is better...;-)

Mike

You California jokers just kill me!  (it never rains in California, but
girl don't they warn ya, it pours, man it pours)

In Missouri we occasionally *do* have rain.  I've got my winshield
greased down with a sh*tload of RainX.  Poke it up to 40 or 50 and
it sheds water like a duck's back.  I don't really *like* to use my
wipers.  Guess I'm afearin' of wearing them suckers out.  Plan to
save them for posterity.

OTOH:  Wipers are mandatory to pass the annual "safety inspection"
in MO.  These guys won't even let you watch while they paw all
over your car.  I don't think they even know how to *activate* the
wipers as my car always comes back with them in the lowest
position (manual park).  I get a real hoot when they try to figure out
how to check the brake fluid level (not 1 in 1000 knows about
the smuggler's boot),

There are also times that wipers come in *real* handy.  Springtime
in South Texas immeadiately springs to mind for some reason.  I'm
also a little paranoid about hyperactive highway patrolmen with
excess time on their hands.  (Our goal is  to put 100,000 more 
policemen on the streets - what, and buy 200,000 more radar guns?)

"Looks like your windshield wipers ain't operable there, son.  
Now, for your safety and mine (?) would you mind if I searched 
that there car?"

"Yes, I mind very much."

"What you got to hide?"

"I dunno, what are you looking for?"

Brave and stronger men than I fought and died to secure
the liberties we often take for granted.  It would be a 
disservice to their memory if I were to voluntarily give up
these rights so preciously won.

"You keep that smart mouth up, boy and you're gonna spend
the night in my jail!"

Yes it does. The Carrera RS had better weight distribution, similar cd,
better braking power, less body roll, and less pounds per HP (10.48 for the
RS versus 11.69 for Euro CS versus 12.62 for U.S. CS). Add to this the
superior suspension geometry and you have the makings of a clearly better
race car.

The acceleration difference could be attributed, and list a lot of it, to
the tire quality between '73 and '88. The other points you mention are
not significant.

Again, the CS was not a successor to the RS so stop saying it was. It was a

I would like to quote a few statements;


Kevin Blick;(Porsche 911-Supercars series)
##########################################
Page 13;
"The 2.7 Carrera continued in 1974 with unchanged power but lost some of its
raw appeal through the change to standard trim and American bumpers. Mindful
of that appeal, Porsche introduced a lightweight Club Sport version of the
1988 Carrera. Like its forebear, this cut interior refinements to save
weight and ran on stiffer suspension. The 231HP newcomer could then match
its predecessor for pace - but just barely."

Page 22;
"...Nothing typifies the new spirit better than the Club Sport, a
lightweight version of the Carrera introduced for the 88 model year. This
unashamedly recalls the glorious Carrera 2.7RS model, the first lightweight
911, even havind 'Carrera CS' scripted down the side. Like its famous
predecessor the CS has been stripped bare; no rear seats, no cassette
player, no sound insulation, no power-windows and no pvc
underbody-coating(which sadly means no 10-year rust warranty either-just
2-years)The result is a 50kg(110lbs) saving.
Like other sport version the CS has that distinctive large rear-wing,
re-calibrated dampers and forged alloy 16-inch wheels - 6 inch in front, 7
inch in rear - with 205/55 VR16 and 225/55VR16 tyres.
The 3164cc engine has no increase on the standard Carrera's 231HP, but
hollow stem intake valves and changes to the electronic engine management
unit allow it to rev to 6840 rather than 6500rpm. The gear shift has also
been given a short throw pattern for quicker shifts.
The result is a small, but distinctive performance edge over the standard
car: Porsche claims only a 0.2 sec improvement to 62mph(100km/h) and an
unchanged top speed (152mph) but AUTOCAR noted a wider margin - especially
in top end performance, the Club Sport being 3.9 seconds ahead to 120mph."

Page 30;
"...the Carrera RST scaled in at 20.4CWT (1037kg) or 18.8CWT (960kg) for the
lightweight RS version. In complete contrast the Turbo...................The
current Carrea weigh in at 1212kg, which the lightweight Club Sport has
trimmed back to 1160kg."

Subject: Gray Market 911's

RISH,
I've owned many 911's over the last 27 years.  Only one new, the rest used. 
My opinion on buying used 911's is that you should pay more for a very good
car because a lesser car will cost you at least as much initially to get it
right, and because a used 911's condition at the time of purchase is a pretty
good indicator of the care it's received and the care it will need.

Having said that, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would muck
around with gray market cars.  Unless there is an extraordinary deal(!), the
couple $thousand you save could easily evaporate as you ensure it complies
with US laws.  Further, although many of us buy these cars thinking we'll
keep them forever, chances are great you'll sell it later on and a gray
market car will draw fewer prospective buyers.  Again, unless the deal is
incredible (and therefore suspicious?), why risk it?

I have seen many US 84 911's in the $17k range.  Yes, they're high mileage or
a little rough (but so is the one you report on).  And 87's can be found in
the $20k range (last year I sold a near-perfect 88 factory turbo-look w/ 120k
miles for $26.5k; I bought it three years earlier for $23k!).  The cars are
out there.  Watch the papers *everyday* and be patient.

Shoot for an 87 or later, if you can.  You'll appreciate the clutch, gearbox,
ventilation, and torsion bar improvements.  BTW, leaky return tubes are no
biggy now that we have collapsable replacements.

What is the general consensus on Gray Market 911s? I've seen two in the last
 week. One was a 1984 Targa with 65k miles (asking 14,900). It was in tough 
shape. I could not find most of the gears (maybe it me). The one I checked 
out tonight was a 1987 Targa with 72k miles (asking 18,000). In pretty good 
shape. Most everything worked. Body had only one ding on it. Engine seem
 very strong (from what I can tell). The clutch has been replace recently. It

seemed like a good deal. 

TThe only real negatives were the oil tube were quite wet and the front trunk
was in disarray  (carpet was missing  there was some kind of electronic box
 in the front trunk). Also the VIN number tag was missing from the door
frame and the trunk area. I did find the riveted VIN number in the trunk
which
had the "ZZZ" code...

Well, Grady,

the proper thing to do is fix your problem, which may be as simple as
checking for false air leaks that would cause a lean air/fuel ratio 
and difficulty in starting.

The thisngs to check (in order of cheap to expensive):

1) The seals around the fuel injectors
2) the rubber boots between the intake manifold and the intake ports
3) The rubber o-ring in the flapper valve
4) the rest of the (now 20+ year old) rubber seals and air passages.

Don't change to webers, or mfi, or anything else.

Subject: toe in/out


As I understand it, the whole point of toe in, is to make sure that the 
wheels are parallel under braking ( to overcome the compliance of the 
rubber in the suspension mounts).

Cars with rose jointed suspension need less toe in.

There would seem to be no circumstances where toe out is advisable, it 
tends to make the car skittish in the straight ahead, and unpredictable 
under braking.

I often here people talking about "getting the tracking done" - this 
seems to be a garage con where the mechanic makes a minor change to the 
tie rods so that the steering wheel is more centered which has little 
benefit. 

Unless a car suffers a serious kerb clunck, then the tracking is unlikely
to change. If the car has a pronounced tendency to steer to the side, then
the likely reasons are, soft tire, brake binding, badly worn suspension
joints, bent chassis member or excessive toe out/in roughly in that order. 

The first three are easy to check, toe in/out is pretty easy to check with
no equipment - I find that the mark one eyeball is the best method, stop
the car with the wheels straight on a large flat area, put some chalk dust
on the front tire walls, go behind the car and eyeball along the sides of
the tires - if you align yourself with the outside edge of the rear tire,
you should not be able to see the front tire front edge, move out until
the edge is just visible and holding a ruler to the edge of the rear tire
measure the gap, you can then do some simple maths to work out the toe in,
repeat for the other side and average. If the toe in is within the
acceptable range, then you probably have a bent chassis/suspension
checking this requires to special jig/deep pockets. 

Note big fat rear tires make this approach more difficult, but you can 
still do it from the front.

	I have the exact same symptoms with my '89 Carrera 3.2, right down to 
the noise being worse when I turn into my driveway!

	I have demonstrated it to my local dealer and the mechanic I spoke to 
said that it is due to using non-asbestos pads and that there is no known cure. 
I received similar advice from porschephiles when I asked about this a few 
months ago.

	I find it extremely annoying and would happily use asbestos pads if (a) 
I could find them and (b) knew that there wasn't *that* much danger to my/others 
health by doing so. BTW, I've wondered if there's a correlation between the 
weather (dry/wet/humid) and the loudness of the groan, but I don't have enough 
evidence yet.

	I did try removing my pads, cleaning out all the brake dust, cleaning 
everything with brake cleaner and reassembling with coppaslip on the back of the 
pads, but it made absolutely no difference.

regards,
Philip Katz ('89 Carrera 3.2)

P.S. Thanks to all who responded to my questions about tyres. I'm going to get 
Bridgestone RE71s as that's what most people recommended, though I'm waiting for 
Bridgestone to send me a brochure about the difference between RE71s and SO-1 
(Expedias) - anyone have first hand experience? A set of 4 tyres over here is 
about 650 pounds Sterling (including valve & balance) ... most of the brands 
suitable for Porsche fitment are within a few pounds of this.

Well, that's novel...

I agree that any toe in is not a good idea, but if the toe is set per
factory specs -- pressed, and using a mechanical or optical toe guage --
it should hold 0 toe at speed. I set my street and race cars for 0 toe
*EXCEPT* the 356 which I set for 1/8" toe in at the front and 0 toe
at the rear with a simulated loads in the driver's seat.

Has alot of interviews with nearly everyone who has played a part
in Porsche's racing history and lots of racing footage.  It basically
is a chronological look at the racing cars and successes through
the years.  At each point in history, they throw in a segment of Derek Bell
driving the particular car in question on a track and giving the viewer
the play-by-play.  He even gets a 962 sideways on occasions.

I especially enjoyed it for the things you can't get out of books (the

Take it to a different mechanic, fix what you have.  Take it from someone

It's a pretty simple bolt-on affair, and you can find them for $200 in 
the aftermarket.  I know - I had mine done at the dealer because I was 
leaving on vacation in an hour.  They were efficient, convenient, and 
gave a 2-year warranty (these fans are not much better than the heater 
blower motor in the engine compartment), but it hurt to see the price 
difference.

Kit Car magazine had an article on a company in California that did 928
convertible conversions a couple of years ago. They showed pictures of
two of them: a red one which had aftermarket wheels, front and rear
spoilers, side strakes, and side skirts (not very attractive *IMO*) and
a white one with standard front "S" spoiler and polished flat "S"

My 911 used to make this "groaning" sound. Since I took it

make the weird sound anymore. The brakes had to work very, 
very hard at the track, one must presume that the full thermal 
cycling and full braking pressures allowed everthing to bed down

A couple of things on this.
If the pcar truely has 67K then I would keep it ORIGINAL the 73 and 74 2.0's
are becoming a collector and worth some money. If you make a race car out of
it then will not have same orig value.

Be sure to have a mechanic ck it out a lot can be done which is not easy to see.

Clutch is not a real prob if you do it your self with run about $350 for
parts w/o new flywheel. The flywheel in the 914's is soft and usually needs
to be changed. If again a true 67K might be able to get by with a resurface
on flywheel.

If the pcar is orig and miles are correct, eng, interior, paint etc are all
EXCELLENT then price is fair. I jsut sold a 73 2.0 for $6,500 but it had a
new paint job and excellent eng, and interior.

Bill Hutton,

Thanks for the assist. I was trying to make the point that the 72-73 
have the rubber boot between the aircleaner and the air inlet 
temperature valve. That thing is located on the left set of MFI stacks
and regulates heated air into the aircleaner until the engine is warm.
It is important that this feature be connected when driving on the 
street, on the track the rubber boot may be removed to increase
airflow to the engine. The 1968-1971 MFI do not have this feature.

What Bill was referring to is the Temperature Compensation device.
The temperature compensation duct enrichens the MFI by passing heated 
air to the MFI pump as Bill pointed out. ALL except racing MFI have this feature. It is a thermostatic device which moves the enrichment rack 
inside the MFI pump. If your heat exchanger is damaged and does not send enough warm air to the pump, driveability is miserable and fuel economy
nil. The duct is a steel tube inside the heat exchanger, the connection 
is a black paper coated aluminum corregated flexible tube. Replacements 
are available from many sources.

I agree with Lance's comments, but there are a few cases where gray market 
cars make sense, like the 73RS or 76 and 77 Carreras that were never 
available in the U.S.  As Stan pointed out recently, a window existed about 
10 to 15 years ago that made bringing these cars over relatively 
straightforward.  EPA offered a "one-time exclusion" for the emissions 
requirements, and the NHTSA had too many cars coming in to do any thorough 
inspections of the safety conversions.  The incredibly favorable exchange 
rate at the time didn't hurt, either.  All of these circumstances combined 
to allow buying one of these unique models an affordable proposition.

But unless you're looking for one of these special models, Lance's comments 
really ring true.

thru California smog testing like grease thru a goose.  All legal like and 
it's got a bit more horses than a US version, even after the smog additions.  
No regrets here, so if the car is correctly done with all documentation and 
the "plate" attached, don't be intimidated.  Besides, it's got these real cool 
yellow directional lights on each side above the fenders.  Not only do they 
work, alerting cars on either side of my intentions but they make my Armanis 
and Brionis feel more at home.

Ditto.  This is a *must*.  Please don't race it if it *is* original.  
Verify that all numbers match - verify paint code w/color - do spend
the money to have a *good* machanic give it the "works" - it can save
you many times that as a bargaining tool...

You can get a clutch package(OEM disc, plate, t.o.) from Zim's for about $230.
[Have just spent $100 more than I needed to myself ;) ]  The clutch replacement
is easy - takes less time than dropping the engine.  If you have the flywheel
resurfaced have the machine shop record the amount of material taken off -
you will need to shim the throwout bearing by the same amount to keep proper
clutch geometry.

>>What would be a reasonable price to pay for this beast ?

$6,500 seems a bit on the high-side, unless it is a *perfect* specimen.

If you really have your heart set on building a race car, start with a 
structurally sound chassis and work up from there.  An immaculate oem
paint job won't help you on the track.   It would be an excellent canidate for
the stock classes should you choose to race it.

I started my current project, driver/autox/rennsport 914, over a year ago
and now it's almost done.  So far I have about $7,000 into the car(by doing
almost all of the work myself) and have a rebuilt transaxle, rebuilt engine,
functional car that I feel confortable driving hard since it isn't an original
specimen.

Subject: Re: 73.5 911T CIS Conundrum

Hello,

I had the same problem with my 1980 911SC.  I took the car to three mechanics
and they all suggested that I spend some big bucks to fix the problem.  They
gave the similar diagnosis that you were given.  

One things they suggested I replace was the worm up regulator.  I purchased a
rebuilt one at AUTOMOTION for $100+ and installed it myself.  Problem, the
worm up regulator needs to be adjusted when the car is bone cold and I don't
have the special equipment to adjust it correctly.

After discussing this with AUTOMOTION, they recommended me to a one man shop
around the corner from where I lived at the time in Sunnyvale.  WAS I
SURPRISED!!

The mechanic mad some minor timing and CIS adjustments while the car was at
operating temp, and the car ran better than ever.  This took about 15min and
a $20 donation.  That was a lot better than the $$$$$ everyone else wanted to
basically rebuild my system. 
(All three shops charged me $65 dollars to look into the problem, OUCH!!!!
 By the way,  the three shops I first took my car to are suppose to be the
best in the SF Bay area.)

I still need to take my car back for the worm up regulator adjustment, since
the car must be left overnight and be cold cold when the adjustment takes
place.  
Because I have not had the adjustment yet, the car is a bit stubborn on start
up,  once it gets going (2nd start) there are no problems.  This is probably
why it has taken me so long to get back to the mechanic.

It turned out, I never needed to replace anything,  Just needed an honest
mechanic.

Best of luck to you,

Well, Grady,

the proper thing to do is fix your problem, which may be as simple as
checking for false air leaks that would cause a lean air/fuel ratio 
and difficulty in starting.

The thisngs to check (in order of cheap to expensive):

1) The seals around the fuel injectors
2) the rubber boots between the intake manifold and the intake ports
3) The rubber o-ring in the flapper valve
4) the rest of the (now 20+ year old) rubber seals and air passages.

Don't change to webers, or mfi, or anything else.



Good Luck!

Subject: RE: Grey mkt. 911's

As an owner of a Euro 84 Targa Carrera, I have to agree with most of the
postings. If you need more FREE hp and higher compression ratio... then the
Euro is a good alternative. I also like the fact that my power windows can
be used while ignition is off. Also, The fog lamps can be turned on with
only the side lites (US?). The turn signal can operate the left or right
parking lites for safety reasons. On the other hand if you do not do your
own repairs, mods and maintainance, then a US version is probably the
better choice, and would make it a no brainer for your mechanic. Sooo, I
would buy a Euro or a US any day as long as the Euro papers are as has been
described here before.
Autoxing the Euro depends on the course. A tight course will hurt your time
due to gear ratio, a widers and long straights course will allow you to
stay in 2nd and not have to spend time shifting up and down and should
improve your time.
My 84 power delivery seems to be different than my friend's US 84. I have
more power and torque around 4300+ rpm, he has more torque from 3000 rpm
and lessens at 6000rpm. This is feel of the pants comments drivning both
cars within minutes from each other so let's not start another CS vs
RS......

 Buyer,  Do some research, listen to this group and go with your gut feeling....

Subject: Rs vs CS actual driving experience

The thread on the RS vs the CS which has now deteriorated into juvenile name
calling needs to be put to rest. Perhaps I can help with some actual driving
experiences of both cars. We have in our region one of each vehicles and they
are both track driven. My friend and fellow instructor, Tony Bonanni, drove
both of these cars on the same day at Pocono race track.
The RS was fresh off of a very expensive restoration so it was driven at
8/10ths. His impression was that it was a nervous, high strung car that
wasn't particularly fast. It was quick off the corners but not a real
charger. He said the brakes were fine but required a high pedal effort.
Handling was good but he really didn't want to drive it at the limits. He was
a bit disapointed as he expected something unusually wonderful. 
The Club Sport was white as was the RS. Cosmetically the RS had the blue
Carerra graphics. The club sport had a chinsey decal on the fender.
The Club Sport drive was also good but not fantastic. He felt more
comfortable in that car as he said it felt more "solid." He though that the
CS had a bit more oomph off the corner but certainly wasn't much different in
performance than the RS. He though the CS brakes were a bit more user
friendly. He noticed nothing special about the car and couldn't believe that
someone would pay extra for what was basically a slightly stripped Carrera
with no outstanding traits.
It should be noted that Tony is slightly jaded as he drives a well developed
930 and is extremely capable in it. 
Hope this helps and please no flames as I am just the messenger.

It is nearly always significantly cheaper to rent from the US than waiting
till you get there. All the major companies have special deals for American
tourists. You can make reservations on line using Eaasy Sabre through
Prodigy, Compuserve or AOL and get a guaranteed rate before you leave This
also gives you a great opportunity to compare rates. There are amazing
differences in rates so shop around. Hertz is generally expensive, Alamo and
(Euro)Dollar oftem have smoking deals. I have had deals with Eurodollar in
the UK as low as $17.00 a day for a two week rental, and they accepted
upgrade coupons. Meanwhile the best Hertz would offer at the same time was
around $65.00

One one occasion I arrived at Heathrow and tried to rent a car at a
previously quoted (back in the states) rate The agent refused and said thatit
 "was only for our American customers" ie the rate was not available if
booked in the UK. So I walked across the lobby, called my secretary in
Phoenix, waited for her to book a car and get a confirmation number then went
back to the rental counter and picked up my car at the US rate!

Subject: Idle drops with 944 AC on...

I too have the idle running too low when AC is on with my '85.5 944.
The car then runs real rough/vibrating at 700 rpm or so.  Idles
fine when the AC is off.  This problem seems to gradually go away
as the car gets good and warmed up, but it takes quite a while, not
just 5 miles of driving.  I haven't found a solution yet, other than
turning the idle up, which isn't the correct fix.  I also get the
hesitation when engaging the AC while cruising on the highway,
but I perceived that as normal.  I also get the AC cycling
on and off about every 8 seconds while cruising the highway.
No solution on that, despite some good suggestions here, and a
couple good p-mechanics trying a number of things.

Subject: 944S2 drivetrain woes

I seek the wisdom of my fellow Porschephiles on the continuing problems
of driveline noise and backlash on my '89 944S2. Basically, the sordid
history is as follows:

1) I took the car to Watkins Glen last summer and had what I thought was 
a great time. On driving back home, I noticed an unpleasant grating/grinding
noise from what seemed to be the rear end accompanied by quite a bit of
driveline lash. In retrospect, I should have driven back to the track and
the many experts there, but I drove home (not far) and sought local advice
(and also advice from you). The consensus seemed to be either ring and pinion
or CV joints. I prayed for the latter, took it to the local dealer, Gardner
Motors in Binghamton, where they took it for a short drive, confirmed that it
was most likely r&p or CV joints, but said they couldn't tell
more without dismantling it. I drove it home and stored it as I was leaving
for a year.

2) When I came back, I checked with porschephiles and found out about the
availability and prices of transaxles (thanks!). I also jacked up the
back and determined that the free play (about 1" at the rim) was the same on
each side, which seemed to suggest r&p rather than a CV joint.
I then took it back to Gardners (I had strong recommendations
from fellow PCA members), where, after a few days I was informed that I definitely
needed a new transmission. I managed to find an S2 transaxle from a '91 with
21K miles, from Larry Marks at Brothers, for a reasonable price, and had it 
delivered to Gardners. After repeated calls and excuses, I was told it was ready,
but there were complications in my picking it up and eventually my wife drove
me down on July 4th to pick it up. I left a check and drove home, but noticed
almost identical symptoms. I was pretty discouraged, to say the least.

3) I had an ex-race mechanic and 928 drive it in Ithaca. He said most of the
noise was a resonance in the exhaust system or a heat shield, but that there
was definitely some other noise or vibration in the driveline that was setting
it off. Because of the torque tube, he said it was very hard to determine if
the noise really came from the transmission, or was relayed from some problem
further forward, like the clutch. He also noted the excessive backlash.
(Of course, I have followed the many messages here about the 944 clutch in the
last year or two. While I did have a lot of grabbing one time when I was stuck
in very heavy traffic for a long time (apparently the pilot bearing), I have
had no other clutch symptoms -- it takes up smoothly at the same place each
time.)

4) I took the car back to Gardners, expressed my considerable dissatisfaction
with their diagnosis/cure. They were somewhat understanding, but wouldn't
commit themselves to fixing it at their cost until they had checked it
out further. They had talked to the Porsche rep, who mentioned problems
with the clutch as a possible diagnosis. I told them they had told me I
definitely needed a new gearbox. (Part of the problem here is that the service
manager was away when I first took the car in, and I was dealing with another
individual until I picked up the car.) 

5) They now tell me the new gearbox definitely has too much play, and they can
hear the noise from the transaxle when they run the car up on the lift.

6) I contacted Larry Marks at Brothers. He will take back the transmission
with a handling charge, which is high but probably reasonable if the transaxle
is OK. Is there a way to determine whether the r&p is bad without
dismantling the transmission? I would presume that the play can be determined
from feeling the play in the output flanges, but Gardners says you really
need to take it apart.

So what are my options? I could have Gardners switch the transaxle back, and
get the hell out of there and try to find a better mechanic. (Upstate NY
is not blessed with them.) I could have them continue to try to find the
problem. I'm out a lot of money (not so much if I return the transaxle), and
I seem to be back where I started. In all other respects the car drives like
a charm, and the problem is not noticeable when you're past 1st and 2nd.
Any advice or diagnosis would be *very much* appreciated!



I would appreciate direct replies as I am on the digest version of the list.
Thanks!

Subject: RE> 944 A/C concerns


Two 944 owners recently stated concerns that they were worried because when 
they turn on the A/C: 1. When in neutral this causes the rpm's to fall. and
2. when cruising it causes a "rearward jolt".

IMHO you (both) have no problems if these symtoms are only exhibited when
you hit the A/C switch. The A/C compressor is driven directly by the
engine, and requires significant power to drive. The moment you hit the A/C
switch, the compressor clutch engages the compressor putting instant 
resistance on the engine. The result (in neutral) is a drop in engine speed
that is usualy only momentary in modern cars, since engine management systems
in general will compensate and bring the idle speed back up to normal (but it
takes a second). On the go the result is a felt loss of power at the moment
that compressor starts spinning. 

If the rpm's drop when A/C is used in neutral and they don't come back up
after a second or two maybe you have a problem, but it isn't the A/C.

Again, this is my humble oppinion based on experience with A/C in general
and not 944's specificaly.

Many happy miles to you both.

Well guys, I'm your man. Current and up-to-date with experience in

Anchorage, Alaska to Central PA. I'll wait for the ticket to arrive

Hope you have a commercial pilot license plus a Part 135 (Charter)
operating certificate. If not the proposed operation is illegal.
You have to be going to to Indiana anyway and then you can only
accept 3/4 of the actual expenses if you're not Commercial & Part 135.
Otherwise don't let the feds catch. A typical charter operation
cost about $100/hour (w/ pilot & fuel) depending on the aircraft.

Subject: Feeding the engine!

P-filers,

Yesterday, I finally got my engine to turn over after so many months of 
working on it.  It sputtered and coughed and choked and then finally ran 
like it wanted to got out racing.  Then it quit.  Me thinks it's a fuel 
delivery problem with my twin Weber 44 IDF's.  The new electric 
fuel pump is humming along fine and the gas lines are new.  Before 
everyone goes telling me to get rid of them and get a FI setup, I need 
to at least try to make this work first.  What is the first thing I 
should check on these carbs?  And how does one properly feed the carbs 
instead of drain the battery?

Subject: Re: Foggy gauges

Curious problem, I am not sure what causes it, only theory I can come up with 
is based on the idea that:

A) Humidity inside the car is high (or perhaps inside the guage)

B) The surface of the guage is relatively cold for some reason and thus the 
moisture condenses on it.

Are you running the A/C or is there somehow a water leak, like maybe from the 
windshield washer lines or from the rain into the trunk??

A cold interior (cooled by A/C) and a moist trunk area (maybe even the carpet 
in the trunk is wet), maybe causes this....let me know if you find it

On the repair side, North Hollywood Speedometer in Los Angeles is very good 
and reasonably priced (from my experience)

    For the front wheels of mass-market street cars, that's true.  For
    the rears, of course, toe-in is used to imrove stability under
    acceleration.

    For race cars (or any self-respecting Porsche street car, for that
    matter), front toe can be used, not as a reactive "fix" for the
    compliant-suspension design problem, but as a proactive way of
    improving the car's straight-line and corner-entry behavior, i.e.,
    more toe-in for straight-line stability and more toe-out to make
    the car turn in.

    I suppose I'd better mention that the values here are VERY small;
    1/8' toe-in to 1/32" toe-out pretty much covers the usable range.

>There would seem to be no circumstances where toe out is advisable, it 
>tends to make the car skittish in the straight ahead, and 
>unpredictable under braking.

    On the track, small amounts of front toe-out CAN help make the car
    point, as I mentioned above.  At corner entry (before the inside
    front tire gets unloaded), the inside tire's toe halps to steer the
    car into the corner.

    Toe-out at the rear is FUCKING DIABOLICAL.  Two years ago, I had
    the pleasure, due to a sequence of wildly improbable events, to
    drive my 914 with (unbeknown to me) about half an inch of rear
    toe-out.  It seemed a little twitchy, but I put that down to the
    fact that I had been driving a pickup truck for the previous three
    months while the car was being painted and having its engine
    swapped.  Everything was fine until I hit 65 mph and the car
    SNAPPED around on the freeway.

    There I was, with only 25 miles on my new engine, bodywork, and
    paint, staring through the windshield at oncoming death.  Not a
    good thing.

    Toe-in is dynamically stable; it will tend to self-correctively
    counteract any sideways forces applied to the car.  Toe-out simply
    amplifies those forces, with often-scary results.

>toe in/out is pretty easy to check with no equipment [method for 
>eyeballing toe with "no equipment" except a ruler and chalk deleted]

    It's trivially easy to measure toe precisely.  If you don't mind
    crawling around on the ground, simply use a tape-measure to measure
    between the outside edges of the wheels on the axle in question.
    Measure once at the front of the wheel and once at the rear; the
    difference is, naturally, the amount of toe.

    If you don't like getting your knees dirty, you can simply
    construct two parallel lines, one on each side of your car, and
    measure in from each line to the tires.  The lines don't have to be
    parallel to the car, just to each other.  The easiest wy to
    construct these lines is to build a rectangle out of two pieces of
    fishing line and two wooden dowels ( or pieces of angle iron, or
    broomsticks, or whatever).  Put one stick in front of the car, one
    behind, and stretch the fishing line taut between them.  Measure as
    follows:

   fishing line                               fishing line

Amen.

A couple of years ago I upgraded my BMW sedan to A Dinan "Stage IV"
suspension, with adjustable rear camber, upgraded shocks and springs, etc. 
I did all the work myself, and took it in for an alignment -- all it should
have required was camber all-around and toe at the front.  They called me
and said "Your rear wheels are toed out." I said "What? I'm coming down." 

Sure enough, the rear wheels were now toed out, whereas 2.5 years
previously, at the last alignment, they were still toed in (I keep the
printouts). So it appears that the rear A-arm bushings had deformed to such
an extent that the rear-wheel geometry had changed for the worse. I also
recall the the car's rear end was awfully "lively" around that time. With
new bushings and rear toe-in, it's much better now. 

So I learned that while in theory a car's alignment shouldn't change over
time (barring curb surfing and more serious abuse), in practice things may
very well change, so I keep an eye on toe these days.

P.S. The Acura NSX has rather high front toe-out and rear toe-in,
ostensibly to "pre-load" the suspension and tires for quick turn-in
response.  Now wonder the tires wear out so fast!

I purchased an '88 911 yesterday after months of searching. It
seems like a great car; information from Porschephiles sure
helped during the search. There are a couple of items that I
could use some help with, though. 

The sunroof doesn't work. When the switch is pressed, the motor
runs, making a noise like a gear skipping on a chain. The
mechanic who did the pre-inspection said it needed cables and a
gear. Has anyone attempted this repair and have suggestions or
instructions?

I would also like to mount a stereo power amplifier under the
passenger's seat. Is there a good way to route the power cable
from the battery to this location?

I received great service from the "Internet guy" discount from
Linda at Carlsen Porsche on a pile of little parts the car
needed. The prices were great, and she was helpful,
knowledgeable, and very friendly. 

Thanks very much

Subject: 968 Head Gasket

About a week ago I posted a note on water consumption with my 95 968.  The
problem turned out to be a head gasket.
To recap, the symptoms were blowing water out of the coolant reservoir
overflow tube, no white smoke from the tailpipe a possible trace of what may
have been oil in the coolant.

Has anyone else heard of a 968 with a head gasket problem?  This one has less
than 11K.

There's nothing *wrong* with doing this, the guards will keep you from
eating the engine when the tensioners fail. Note that I said "WHEN".
They *WILL* fail. You will have to replace them. That's the advantage
of the Carrera tensioners -- as they're pressurized, you don't have
to replace them (typically -- ran into a failed set earlier this year,
first ever for me...).

Hi P-dudes:

I just made my first performance purchase:  a cool, Momo Monte Carlo
steering wheel (12.5"- whoa, small!!)  Anyway, after installing it, I had a
few small problems:

1 - no more turn signal cancelling feature (no tab)
2 - now, I can't see the top portion of my tach.

Number one I can put up with, but, number two I can't stand.  Does
anyone know how to rotate  the tach for easier viewing?  I have noticed
different tach positions on racing vehicles to view only the upper regions
of the rpm.  Any advice would be helpful!!  I am also still waiting on any
advice on the sport muffler question recently submitted.  Maybe, I was
on the bottom of the thread?!?!?!?!?

        You may be able to simply push on it and rotate it that
way.  If you can't, then pull it out from the front or push from
the back (from under the dashboard or maybe in the trunk???),
turn, push back in.  The gauges are only held in by rubber grommets.

Subject: Re:       heater repair in 1980 SC

Heater and blower are two different systems. The heater basically sends the 
air over the exhaust system, through the body and into the heater box, the 
fresh air part gets sucked in through the grille in the centre of the trunk 
(near the windshield).

First thing I'd do would be to take off the cover at the back of the trunk (4 
screws hold it in) and check to make sure the little flappers all move when 
the slides on the controls are moved. Sometimes the cable clamps come loose 
and then you may have the flappers all in the wrong spot. If they seem to be 
moving in a proportional sort of way, check the fan. Does it blow and with 
sufficient speed (listen to the plastic whine). If in doubt disconnect the air 
hose which comes out of the centre of the fan itself and then turn it on. If 
lots of air comes out...not the fan.

If you still have a problem with fresh air at this point....I would be 
stumped. If fresh air is fine, but no heat, check the air hoses from the 
electric fan in the engine compartment through to the connection in the body 
above the rear axles. If that is all fine, check to make sure the flapper 
valves (underneath the car, above the axles) actually work. Get someone to 
move the heater control and make sure that the cable actuates the flapper. 
Note that "closed" ie no heat, actually allows the air blowing from the fan in 
the engine compartment to exhaust under the car...the flapper above the axle 
is open.

If this fails, gasoline and a match may be the only answer...

Let me know what you find...

Unfortunate Accident Seen Yesterday in Millbrae, CA
911 with Targa Top and Whale Tail Wrecked
  * don't know status of driver but the weirdest wreck I've ever seen; the
   left rear wheel (and most of the fender) was torn completeley off, even
   the drive axle was gone.  The car was situated in its resting place in the
  middle of an undivided road.  Millbrae Police and Fire Department at scene.
  The driver/passenger compartment (and for that matter, the rest of the car)
  seemed completely unscathed other than the missing pieces.  I don't mean to
  be insensitive or morose, but I can't figure out how this may have happened.
 I'm assuming this was the result of a collision of some kind but it occured to
me that if a torsion bar snapped or somehow came loose, one might have a cat-
tostrophic failure of the whole swingarm/wheel assembly.  Does this happen to
911's?

Hello P-Philers

I am once again asking for your assistance as I journey towards my first P-car.
This time I am looking for a location (if there is one) in the Porschephile
archives, (or elsewhere) of an explanation of 911 VIN Numbers. Your assistance

Dear Jim,

As a followup to your very good advise (as always) I would like to offer 
the following:

I have successfully replaced those paper/tinfoil oem Porsche air ducting 
hoses on the MFI units and between the heat exchanges and the body etc. 
with SCAT hose.  For the uninitiated reading this return, SCAT stands for 
Silicone rubber Air Tubing.  It is used on aircraft to duct hot air from 
the exhaust manifolds to where ever it is needed.  

This stuff is sized in 1/4" increments I think.  To get it to fit I 
simply removed some of the wire reinforcement and folded the end inside 
the tube and clamped it.  The stuff is impervious to all of the normal 
engine  fluids and by products.  Engine heat does not affect it.

It always can be found at your aircraft repair facilities.

Hi y'all

	Yesterday I went to get a new thermostat for my 911, and they guys
at AutoSport talked me out of it.  Told me I should check to see what the oil
temp _really_ is before I go spending any crazy amounts of cash.  I did
get a cool reception from the mechanic that shanked my SO's BMW, tho :( (putz!)

	Anyway, I went and bought a meat thermometer, and tested the temp
by putting it in where the dipstick goes, and running the car a bit.  The
temp on the guage and the temp on the thermometer were right on the money.

	I guess monday I get to get a new thermostat after all...

	Anyone know of any good parts sources in Sacramento besides Niello and
AutoSport?  (Mike? Bob?)  I wanna do this ASAP - not mail order!

Not since the '70s. But it's still valid because near as I can tell,
they're still the same. Maybe even selling off the same old stock.
They sucked then, probably suck even worse now.
   
Do yourself a favor and get some Yokos. Personal experience indicates
AVS Intermediates. Should be about $175 a tire. You'll love them.
It'll be like a new car.

If you cheap out, at least consider the A-509. It's cheaper, and handles
about 85% was well. Still lightyears from where you are now and a
couple of galactic diameters per hour from the Semperits... (gotta
keep them units consistent, you know?)

Best buy: call Tire Rack or Discount Direct for the best price, get
the local tire outfit that sells Yokos to match the "delivered" price
provided you buy the install,etc. there...

Subject: 944 shaky steering wheel


I've noticed that my '86 944 steering wheel shakes
at around 100+ km/h (60 mph). The strange thing is
that this doesn't always happen (even on the same
road). What can cause a shimmy to happen sometimes
and not other times?

 - front end was aligned recently

 - jacked up car and spun wheels checking for runout.
  Tires and wheels are true

 - wheel bearings adjusted recently and are tight

 - front tires (215 VR 60) at 29 psi
 - rear tires (235 VR 55) at 35 psi

 - wheels not balanced since new. The tread still has
  the little rubber 'stubby things' sticking sideways out of 
  the tread blocks, so the rubber is still relatively new (Pirelli P6). 

Idea's anyone?

First off, this is the first I've ever seen. EVER. Even racing.

Second,it was DOA, near as I can tell. Either that or it failed just

Yeah, right. It happened.

>  but the weirdest wreck I've ever seen...

Had that basicly happen to my wife's '73 Beetle (one owner, about five 
different drivers EVER '73 Beetle I might add...) some years ago, but it 
was the passenger side. She was rear-ended (she was at a dead stop and someone
drilled her at about 60 MPH, trying to change lanes). Far edge of the
offending car's bumper hit middle of the license plate, came out under the
rear side quarter window. Forward  motion and spin control was applied by
mashing the front of the car into the car ahead, and folding the front 
end back to touch the wheels, preventing rotation.

She was fine, other than BIG bruises on her hands where she broke the
steering wheel from being jammed into it...

A year and $15k later the car was just like new... It mainly sits in a
warehouse, getting out for exercise every few weeks for a couple of
hours. She's very disinclined to put it in heavy traffic.

The net result also makes me disinclined to "over-restore" any of my
cars. I don't have enough warehouse space for that. Drive 'em, I say...

Ok I have changed my mind I have posted the 350 for sale and am looking in
to the 914/6 conversion.  First of all I understand that more grill area
is needed, How is this done usually?  I have a couple of ideas but don't
know if they would work.  Also if I use a 3.2 that uses a pull clutch do I
need to use the pull clutch.  My understanding is that the earlier clutch
will bolt up to the 914 tranny and 3.2.  If I was to use the pull clutch
how would I modify the tranny? Also what body modifications are allowed in
the pca or scca I haven't gotten around to asking them since I have raced
a stock 924 previously (which is for sale if anyone is interested in an
easy way into the pca email me)  What class would a 914/6 with a 3.2 and a
ferrari testarossa body qaulify for? What about a 3.2 with fender flares? 
How is the 914 tranny with a 3.2 does it require gear modifications?  Any
hints or suggestions on the conversion?  LAST QUESTION, has anyone ever
gotten a 911 taken out the back seat switched the engine around and switch
the ring and pinion making it mid engined? If not why not?  It seems to me
that all of the components are compatible.

How true??? Wheel runout max is 40 thousandths of an inch.
Tire hop of any kind can cause this problem.

Probably not the problem.

Does this mean that the tire/wheel combination is now out of balance
or has not been re-balanced when new.  I would check the balance on these.

Also, check for any play in the ball joints or tie rods.
Check for worn shock absorbers.

Hello everyone,

I am just about finishing some importduty calculating VB software for windoze.

The only reason is cause I checked what the only existing DOS based package
costed, get seated....Kroner 4000 or approx $ 550!!!

And that for assumeably 300-400 lines of code! (And a Data file with all the
prices in of course...)

Hopefully I'll sell some copies of the little sucker,...$99 that sounds
fine, maybe it will be enough to buy a poster of the best RS (RS 3.8 ;-). 
(No sale attempt! This is in Norwegian, and only useful in Norway too!)

The calculations is rather straightforward but you need background data,
with List Prices the year the car was sold new, weight, inflation rates, and
so on,.... 

The bad thing is; Porsche prices are missing from '86 and back,...does
anyone have a clue to a source book or something that include the FOB
Stuttgart Prices for specific years?

Testing the program will be fun, I'm looking for a '71 - '73 Porsche 911S or
*maybe* a *very good* 914 for import,....great way to check out the
stuff....in practice.

What did a 914/4 cost in the US around '72,...the 914/6 then?

I have the prices for the '72 911's!

I'll go back to my original position: it's not that hard to do if you (a)
have done it before and (b) have nearly infinite amounts of money. Plan on
car plus engine plus about $10k, minimum. Best advice: find someone that's done
it before and have them either do it for you or pay them to coach you 
through it. 

> Also what body modifications are allowed in
> the pca or scca I haven't gotten around to asking them ...

Sigh..... *DO THIS FIRST*!!!!! I have an acquaintance who spent over $50k
building this 911 "race car" only to find that the only place it was legal
was the local PCA autox, the "Modified" division of SCCA autox, and
IMSA road racing where his lame engine and bodywork choice would make him
a rolling German speed bump for even the slowest cars.... He'd need to glue
a cone to the top of the car so that people would know to slalom around
him...

> What class would a 914/6 with a 3.2 and a

For SCCA road racing, it would qualify to sit in the parking lot while you 
watch the race from the stands. There's probably a sufficiently progressed
class in PCA club racing where you can run with the 935s or something.

For SCCA autox, I think that's too big an engine for F Prepared, so you'd be
in Modified class with the winged kit cars. PCA? I dunno -- depends on
the region. *WAY* out there in the progression, though.

Yes. Turns out to be legal in both SCCA and IMSA, and someone did that
this year. Big writeup in current Excellence, I believe. MASSIVE amount
of work, big dollars.

Subject: 924 exhaust .. does it have a cat or not ?


Hi,

You all know, I bought this 924, all fine except for a known exhaust
problem that sounded like no muffler at all.  There was not too much
time to do more than a compression test, (and hey its only a 924 :). So
I bought the car, providing generously for a big exhaust job in my
negotiation.

Saturday we hoisted the car up all the way, we found it was worse than
I had though -- the entire exhaust _system_ between the exhaust pipe
and the last muffler was missing !! Non Sum .. "Gone to see Oprah" ..
AWOL !

Luckily, the projected cost is still within my provision. Bad news is
that I am hearing this "just one more week" refrain once again :-(.

+------------
My question is -- 
What are the exact components on the '82 924 exhaust system ? 
Does it have a catalytic or no catalytic ?
+------------

The owner manual "in the glove compartment" shows a catalytic.

Imparts faxed me a page from Bosals catalog that shows the exhaust pipe
from the manifold, then two cylindrical objects (which a parts dealer
says are both "resonators") and the final muffler at the tail-pipe.
This picture shows no lambda sensor and no catalytic ! I cant believe
that a car could pass the sniffer without either.

An interesting circumstantial evidence is that Tweeks' lists parts for
"924 w/catalytic" and "924 w/o catalytic". (in the Performance section,
for model years 79-82, "pls state year and month of manuf".)

+---------------
Would be very grateful if someone knew exactly what parts go into a '82
924 exhaust system, between the exhaust manifold and the final
tail-pipe. 
Maybe you have Haynes / the microfiche / seen it own eyes ? TIA!
+---------------

I suppose the Porsche microfiche would give me the final word on this,
wouldn't it ? I would order one first thing monday. But then I want to
also get the car on the road asap too (you know ... :-) !!

And what do you think .. since I need a complete exhaust system anyway,
A friend suggests I rather go for one the after-market "performance"
ones, (Bursch?) rather than duplicate the OEM stuff at a higher price?
Any opinions/ recommendations ?

TIA for advice / help  .. and thanx, above all, for lending me the
shoulder to cry on :-) !!

Subject: 914 vacuum arrangement/quirky idle


Hello! <grinning from EAR-TO-EAR>

As my previous post stated, my 914 is once again alive!  I am hoping that
with a few more days of TLC that she'll be as good a new, and when it 
comes to Porsche TLC I always look to pphiles for advice and support.  

Here is the scoop:

I'm waiting for the air cleaner to arrive and ran the engine without it(I 
put a paper dust mask over the rubber on the intake).  Looking through 
Haynes and the 914-914/6 handbook I was unable to make heads or tails of
the vacuum line routing from the diagrams, so (wanting to start her up
to she if she worked) I make educated guesses.  

I do not have a deceleration valve installed on the car(may order one, it's
a '70-based core engine) therefore I needed to route the vacuum for the
aux. air regulator, vacuum advance/retard and pressure sensor.  

While the base idle speed was good(about 900) it would ride a triangle-wave
up to about 2500 and the drop back to 900.  It would not stay constant at
900 but rose and fell as if someone were pressing and releasing the 
accelerator.

I resigned myself to the fact that I had false air entering the intake 
and since I have no deceleration vavle - I think it may be the aux. air
regulator - could this be causing the problem?  I am curious only because
of the fluxuation - a constant high idle wouldn't worry me.

I will continue to investigate and keep you posted on the results.  If 
anyone has any vacuum-line references for a d-jet. 914 (text or otherwise)
I'd appreciate it if you could help me out.  

My fax number is: +1 313 996 9908, voice: +1 313 996 9900, ext. 1227

Still recovering from the adrenalin-rush of breathing life into my 914,

Ummm, are the 928's manuals available on CD-ROM? Are any Porsche manuals on
CD-ROM? I too would like to have my 928's manuals and the parts 'fiche on

Dear Gig,

I tried to post you directly but was bounced out by the mail system.

During the formation of our Ozarks Lakes Region, Springfield MO, we 
requested the name of Ozarks Region.  At the parade that year our 
presentation was made.  There were some people there from Little Rock.  
They made the claim for the same name based upon the fact the Ozarks Mtn. 
area was primarily in Arkansas.  I'm not sure that an actual group of 
people were meeting as a local region in Little Rock at the time.  It may 
have been more like some people attending the parade thought it would be 
a good idea to lay claim to the name so a region could be put together.

The region was listed in Pano for many years.  Call your regional advisor 
for details. Yours is listed in PANO.  Get the thing going again.

A previous poster mentioned that the Momo wheel didn't have a turn signal
turner-offer-tab-thingy (hey the bard did it too). Well, you actually have
to remove the part from the stock wheel and it fits on the Momo wheel.
There is a contact of brass on the same part that makes the connection to
the horn circuit, so it seems like you'd have to be creative to make the
horn work otherwise.

Also, I heard Momo was being sued by Porsche for the Porsche logos on their
horn buttons. Anyone else hear this one?

Subject: Polished Fans


I pulled my fan out, cleaned it up and polished it. What a job! The outside
edge of each fan blade looks like a weld bead has been run on it, and this
is a serious challenge to clean up.

Ever notice that the blades are airfoils? It seems that if you just wanted
to move air, you wouldn't need the airfoil, just the blade shape and some
sort of symmetrical profile. Does the airfoil make the fan more efficient?

At any rate, I noticed that the leading edges of the fan blades were rather
square, and the blades themselves where pretty crudely finished. I
therefore cleaned up the blade shape and smoothed everything out. I also
balanced the finished product (static balance, like my RC airplane props).
After polishing, I clear-coated it, lest the aluminum oxidize again and my
effort prove fruitless.

With all this balancing and smoothing, I swear my old 2.7 gets another 10
to 15 microhorsepower to the wheels.

Also, it REALLY looks good.

I don't know what the problem is, not being an AC kind of person.  However,
there is an "AC Compressor On" signal to your car's DME, which should
let it compensate.  It should compensate anyways, as it always tries to
keep idle at 840 RPM.  You might try cleaning your idle stabilizer as well
as checking the other usual poor-idle culprits.

Subject: Early 911 oil lines

I just stripped the fitting on the oil cooler on my '71 2.2 911 (#$@*!)

The rebuilt motor is back in the car but now I'm stuck.
The oil cooler is out and I will try to
find someone (maybe at a radiator shop?) who can salvage the threads
tomorrow.

There are two main oil lines on the car; one from the oil tank to the
oil cooler (approx 30 mm fittings) and one from the oil tank to a fitting
on the LHS of the case (approx 26 mm fittings). (I measured the outside
diam on the threaded portion of the fittings. I think this might give
slightly low values, i.e. maybe these are really 31 and 27 mm threads?

I am planning on buying a new oil line to replace the one that caused
all the trouble to start with, but would really 
like to salvage the oil cooler if possible. What are my 
chances of finding
a radiator shop that either has a big die that will fit or that is
capable of soldering aluminum and replacing the fitting? Should I just
bite the bullet and get another oil cooler? Anyone have one? 

The fittings on the longer line are in good shape, but the end that goes
to the engine doesn't fit! It looks like I got the wrong fitting in the
case. Its threads are about 30 mm (the size of the other line) but
they should be more like 26mm.

I assume that I have the correct oil lines for the car, and that
the idea of having different size fittings was to make it impossible to
mix up the lines.

Any idea where I can find the correct engine fitting quick?
The fitting should have approx 23mm threads for the case
and approx 26 mm threads for the oil line. 

Also, can some kind soul please tell me how the long oil line is
supposed to be routed from the lhs of the engine to the oil tank?
It looks like it should go over the top of the tranny, is this right?
It seems to want to rub against the clutch cable adjusting block.
Where do you mount the hold-downs for the line?

Time is somewhat of the essence now since the landlord is breathing
down my neck. I am doing this in my apartment carport and the
landlord just stuck a "parking ticket" on the car last Friday
saying that non-operating vehicles are verboten and it will
be towed if not off the property by next Friday :-).

They don't like us working on cars here. I still couldn't help
but laugh when I
got the ticket, for two reasons -  The car has been sitting
in the same spot without an engine for several months, and by
sheer coincidence they ticketed the car the day before I brought
the motor back and put it in. In their description of the offense,
the wrote "no rear plate or bumper, non-operating vehicle".
If the jerk had stooped about 6" he could have seen that there was
no motor in the car and wrote that on the ticket. My guess is that
he must have been pissed about the 2" of dust and spiderwebs.

   This is a tough one.  You can get general info such as publisher, subjects
covered, etc., from _Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory_, which is
published yearly.  Your public library should have it, or be able to tell you
another library in you area that has it.  It is comprehensive in coverage, and
has a substantial listing of car rags listed in the "Transportation--Autos."
section.
   Indexes are a problem.  I know of no index covering automotive literature. 
_Ulrich's_ will tell you what indexes cover a given magazine (if any do).  But
when you look at it you will notice that for most enthusiast literature, you
are lucky if it is even included in Reader's Guide.  
   If the magazines you're interested in are still being published, I would
contact the publisher and ask if they produce an index to their publications,
or if they have any suggestions where you could get that type of info.
   By the way, I am a librarian.  I work at a small college in MA, but I also
am the librarian at the Museum of Transportation in Brookline, MA.  I haven't
been there too long, but if I run across a good source for auto magazine

If it is dead, I have a three connector(early) fuel pump laying around that
should work(it worked when it was removed).  Let me know if you need it.
Items I'm looking for in trade are:

  rear "porsche" reflector(have solanoid release)
  center caps(x4) for fuchs alloys(914)
  1 spare fuchs alloy
  deceleration valve
  fuel pressure gauge

It's ok for the short term(the + line should be fused) but please don't
leave it like that...

The fuel pump should run for about 1-2 sec when the key goes from off to
ignition on - this brings the pressure held by the regulator back up.  I
kept turning the car on and off until fuel started to appear in the engine
compartment(thereby identifying the send/return orientation) and hooked
the lines to the engine fuel system.  The non-ignition cranking before 
starting will bring the system up to its operating pressure.

BTW:  Anyone know a good source for a fuel pressure gauge?

Mine never went out (after 1 minute of cranking).  So, I just connected
the coil wire and started her up.  It then went out.

Does anyone know the correct orientation of
the alternator in the fan housing?  My car is
a '72 911, but I think they must all be pretty
much the same.

I took mine out to paint the fan, and neglected
to mark it properly.  I think you have to get it
right for two reasons.  First, so the wiring harness
matches up neatly, and second, because there isn't
much tolerance for fan offset from center.  It runs
pretty close to the edge of the housing, so it's got
to be smack dab centered.

Many thanks!

It's usually the power steering pump belt which makes noise, not the 
alternator polyrib.  The waterpump has a weeping passage underneath the
pulley, to memory.  Did you locate it and check there?

>Is squeaking ok so long as the pump doesn't leak? Could the new 
>tighter timing belt (4.0 on P9201) have stressed the old pump bearings? 

Squeaking is OK, but is generally a sign of worse things to come soon,
like real leaking.  I'd keep an eye on it.  If it leaks, you'll see
coolant dribbling off the bottom of the timing belt covers -- no need
to remove them to inspect.

>1. Buy new or rebuilt?

New.  People say great things about Jay Pineau's rebuilt parts, so you
might consider using one.  Avoid ESP rebuilts.

>3. What is the likelihood of breaking off a waterpump bolt at removal.

Pretty low, to my experience.  But there are a heck of a lot of them!
And I think you get new ones with the WP -- could be mistaken.  Reinstall
with antiseize.

Never tried it, might work.  Look at the torque spec for your engine, and
figure that you're "simulating" that, opposite direction, when you take
off the crank bolt.

You *might* be able to R&R the waterpump without removing the crank bolt.
I would pull all the other sprockets and rollers off, then remove the
four bolts (plus or minus) retaining the rear time belt cover (two at
the distributor rear cover, two low and to the block), then move the
cover forward yielding access.  Not sure whether this works...

If you want to be cheap and creative, get a friend with a *big* screw-
driver to wedge it against the flywheel ring gear while you twist the
crank bolt.  It works and is faster than removing the starter and
installing the lock.

No, you don't need a puller.

It is entirely random, best I can tell.

I replaced mine with the updated kind, I didn't have to drill but I do recall
having to do some filing with a big round bastard (rat-tail) file.
Scope it out and spend the $6-7 for a nice sharp new file of the
right size and you should be able to get the new door stay in in less than
an hour.

On the bright side- the new part is much simpler, cheaper and lighter weight.

and tap out the inside of the stub to accept the case fitting.
Hopefully the thread isn't too rare and someone will have a tap.

Also, re. the main oil line fitting on the LHS of the case,
I heard that there are two sizes.
Both have the same size thread into the case,

Subject: No More Points!

  Hello all,

  Has anyone had experience with the Pertronix Ignitor systems?  Especially
  for an early 911 with points.

  I have a '73 911 S & have tried a Crane Ignition system XR3000 that
  replaces the Bosch CD & the points with a light/sensor set-up.  While the
  CD replacement box worked fine, I had nothing but trouble with the points
  replacement hardware.  First, it was almost impossible to fit into the
  Bosch distributor (had to grind down the sensor wheel), then, possibly
  because of the tight fit or ?, had trouble with the vacuum retard unit
  working properly (with timing set correctly at 6000 RPM, the timing
  wouldn't retard enough at idle, all this works pretty well with the
  points installed).  Next, after about a week of operation & 1 autocross,
  the tach blew.  I have since removed unit, sold it, had tach fixed & am
  still looking for a good replacement for the points.

  Does the Igniter system fit inside a Bosch distributor?  Does it work
  with the stock Bocsh CD unit?  Can I use my stock coil?  Will my tach
  work OK & where will it connect to?  Will I have any problems with the
  centrifugal advance or the vacuum retard in the distributor?  Are there
  any other options out there to replace the distributor points?

  One last distributor related question.  Is there a shop in the So. Cal
  area that can test the advance curve of my Bosch distributor?

  Thanks,

This what a I received with my registration renewal info:

If after January 1, 1995, your vehicle fails Smog Check, new federal law
requires you to make necessary repairs to reduce your vehicle's emissions to
required levels.  
If your vehicle is not under warranty, and you have spent more than $450 for
appropriate emissions-related repairs at a licensed Smog Check repair facility,
you may be eligible for a one-time waiver.
Repair waivers will not be issued for:
Vehicles with missing, modified or disconnected emissions control equipment,
regardless of the costs to make repairs;
Vehicles identified as "Gross Polluters" - vehicles which have much higher
emissions than properly maintained vehicles in their class;
Vehicles that obtained a repair waiver after 1/1/95 in their most recent
biennial inspection or transfer of ownership.  Two consecutive repair waivers
will not be issued after 1/1/95.

This is just for everyone's info and also to provide more info regarding my
previous post stating that only one waiver would be issued.  This DMV card says
one-time waiver, but then also mentions not allowing two consecutive waivers. 
Therefore, I am not sure if you can obtain a waiver every other time you need a
smog check.  If it is really a one-time waiver than it goes without saying that
no two consecutive waivers will be issued.  Just thought I'd let you interpret
this for yourselves.  It also says that this is new federal law, so it may
affect people in all states in some way, I don't know.  John #000#

Now to my question: The Idiot light is on, at least that's what I'm assuming
the yellow light in the top center of the oil level/pres. guage is.  The oil
level is OK, measured with the dipstick and as indicated on the guage, and
the presure seems OK per the guage, about 30% of the guage at Idle, up to
50%+ with blips of the throtle, and the engine temp is normal.  What is
the trigger condition for the light, and what things should I check to
diagnose the problem.  The engine is a rebuilt 2.7L with MFI among other
updates...

Hi Terry and other P-dudes:

I was just wondering what size MOMO wheel you put.  I got the smallest
they made (12.6" or 320 mm).  I spent the whole weekend driving with it
down to the Tweeks swap meet and I couldn't help the feeling that it was
actually too small.  When I got to the PCA club racing event at Putnam
Park, most of even the serious racers had normal size steering wheels
(13.8").   Any comments?

PS. BTW, thanks for the advice on the turn signal canceler.  I just hope
there are bolt holes for it when I remove it tonight.

Subject: Euro 928 problems

Hi, Folks;

I have an '81 Euro 928 S which has an annoying idle problem.

(1)  When starting the card cold, the engine *almost* catches immediately. 
But after that quick tease, it drops back to requiring a long crank on the
starter.

(2)  Once lit, it barely idles at all.  What idle there is seems to cycle
wildly.  Hold a constant slight throttle, and the idle will range from about
2000 to about 50.  Foot off throttle: engine either dies or idles so low that
I'm concerned about oil pressure and bearing chatter.

(3)  At freeway speeds under this condition, the engine seems low on power,
and the exhaust note is significantly different.  Like it's not hitting on
all 8.

(4)  Once the engine is warm, the car will stay lit at idle.  But the idle
still cycles, from about 850 to about 500.

My mechanic has been unable to decipher this problem.  (1)  has always been
the case, (2) is a relatively recent development.

Second problem:  car pulls slightly to the right.  My mechanic insists that
the alignment is spot on.  Tire pressure has been checked.  Mechanic has no
idea.

The car has been a near constant headache since I bought it. Like finding out
that while the car was *mechanically* fit for California smog, the paperwork
had not been done correctly.  So I got to pay $3500 for the privilege of
having the smog equipment taken off, bolted back on again, and the forms
filled out. That process took 20 months.  I then got to find out that 20
months of neglect in an EPA impound yard had destroyed the leather dash, and
allowed A/C seals to dry out.

The point being that it has become difficult for me to enjoy the car anymore.
 So I am looking at selling the thing.  My mechanic has told me that if I'm
going to sell the thing, I shouldn't do any more work to it, because I won't
get my investment back in sales price.  He's probably right, but that just
feels like bad karma.  I've insisted on putting new pads, tires, and a bunch
of other stuff on, out of respect for the car (yes, it's a big water pumper,
but it still a Porsche) and for the next owner. 

 All of this means that I want to fix this thing right, but I don't want to
kill a lot of money doing it.  The Typical Porsche Dilemna.  I'll spend it if
I have to, but I reserve the right to grumble.

Any ideas out there?  I live in Oakland;  are there any mechanics which
people particularly recommend?    And how much would be fair to ask for such
a beast?

Subject:       Cars For Sale in CA

I've seen these two cars on my way to and from work for a while now, and 
I figured it was time to pass on the info:

First is an earlyish 944 (I'm an air guy...).  White paint in good
condition, no dings, one slight scrape, rubber trim OK, no evidence of
past collisions (no ripples, seams straight, etc.).  Interior is so so
(looked kinda faded and worn, but not thrashed).  Decent rubber on black
cookie cutters.  No puddles of precious bodily fluids under the car. 
This car has been for sale for almost a year--I don't know what the deal
is; never talked to the owner, just looked it over on the street.  (415)
493-5173 after 6:15 pm.  

The second car is more interesting:  1960 356 Super90 Cab.  Ivory paint, 
6 months old (car was masked, not disassembled; a nice paint job, but not 
concours), no rust visible anywhere, no dings, no ripples, no bubbles.  
The undercoat looks new.  Interior is in very nice condition, except 
for one nicely patched rip in the driver's seat; the steering wheel looks 
pristine, and there is a radio-shack radio mounted under the dash (could 
be easily removed...).  The wheels are in great condition.  Possible oil 
leak in engine (some brown discoloration on rear valence, like oil 
smoke?).  $35000 (415) 493-1259.

After I'd spent a few minutes looking over the car and taking notes, the
owner comes down the block with a handful of golf clubs.  I ask him a
few questions about the car, and he answers, adding that he just loves
the car.  When I ask him why he's selling, he says that this car is
actually a hook for a "bait and switch", what he's really selling is "an
identical car."  So I don't know what he's thinking, but it seems a bit
odd....  However, I figured that the car I saw was pretty nice, and the
price wasn't exactly low--maybe the car for sale was actually
worth looking at.  So I'm passing the word on to the list.  I pass this
guy's place every day on my way home, so I could be convinced to take a
look at the car if you're really interested.  Can't be that many '60
Super90 Cabs around...

No affiliation, etc. etc. etc..

No if the parts are not avail then you go to the Bureau of Automotive repair
and get the necessary waiver for the not avail parts. Not sure how much they
have tightened up on this. They do know what is and not avail in the market
place. So be sure that the stuff is not avail for ANY price. Missing parts
do not fall within the $450 cap. This is for Calif. not sure what is "right"
for other states.

They should use LOTS of their moving pads to cover surround etc. These are

Exactly what I happened to my 944S hose (.04 revision).  It seemed to
happen after I overfilled (due to not RTFMing well enough) the coolant
reservoir.  I could be way on the left field on this one, but it seems
that the extra insulation that is wrapped around the power steering fluid
lines (the jug with the ZF label is right there) was rubbing against the
top of the hose.  I think that some joker while servicing my car (when it
was not under my ownership) had removed the power steering fluid jug and
not replaced it correctly.  The result was that the jug was not lined up
correctly and thus the power steering fluid hoses were routed differently
and thus rubbed against the radiator hose.  After looking at a few other
944s and the 968 I figured out that my instincts on how the jug should be
placed were correct and now the hoses are away from each other, plus it is
much easier to get to the oil filter.  BTW, which hose revision are you
having problems with?  The new hose I have is the .07 revision and I have
had it since March (~600miles) with no problems. 
I hope this was even slightly useful.

Make sure that the hose is pushed all the way onto the water pump and the
radiator and make sure that it is TIGHT.  Have had the same problem
in the past & bought two new hoses as a result. The pressure generated
in the system will force the hose off until it runs against the water pump
pulley.  The pulley will rub through in fairly short order. All the while 
the
system DOES NOT leak because the clamp is just tight enough to seal
but not tight enough to hold the hose in place.

    I don't know what kind of epoxy that was, but I have used PC-7
(similar to JB-Weld, only thicker) which is available in just about
every hardware store, to repair old hard rubber steering wheels for
Chevys.  This is the stuff that you're "supposed" to use, and it seems
to work pretty well.  The first time I used it, I got a couple of little
hairline cracks, but the second time I was more careful and it lookes
great, two years later, except for a few paint scuffs (not the epoxy's
fault.)  I used a Dremel tool to "grind out" the cracks to about 1/8"
wide (maybe even wider) and went all the way around the rim, where
possible, to try to relieve stresses in the old material before filling.
 To shape, I used a fine file and then covered the rough surface with
spot (glazing) putty and wet-sanded, primed, and painted.
    If you've got an old 356 wheel that is really shot, you might want
to try this before tossing it and buying an expensive repro one.

The Igniter is a *very* tight fit inside the distributor.  All of the
electronics are contained in a little epoxy blob that replaces the points.
I had to file away at a couple of places to make it fit.  If I were to do
it again, I'd get the type that has just the interrupter (photocell/disk)
 inside the distributor, and the rest of the electronics outside.

     Today at lunch I stumbled upon a lot in Hamilton, OH (near Cincy) where
a red 911 was sitting.  On the windshield was written "formerly owned by Pete
Rose."  Whether it was or not, I don't know, but it was similar to a red 911
Pete used to own (he did a few local commercials featuring it).  Anyway, it
was a 1974 and it had 64,000 original miles.  I test drove it and it seemed
to run very strong.  However, the car was not in pristine condition.  The
interior was a little rough, and there was oil leaking on the exhaust,
causing a little smoke.  The car seemed a little sloppy shifting, but I don't
know whether that was normal for that year 911. It also had a botched window
tinting job. Red paint and Fuchs wheels looked pretty nice.  Tires were in
nice shape, too--Dunlops maybe?  He was asking $10,500.  If your interested

If he just needs a new _clutch disk_, he should look around for places that
rebuild them.  Here in the SF Bay Area I've heard of a place that does
Kevlar (or something) disks for about $80 - you supply the "core".  As to
the pressure plate, well, I don't know.

The Lash Int'l 914/4 914/6 manual (Automotion carries it) devotes 13 pages
w/lots of illustrations and figures to the Sportomatic. The pressure plate,
"carrier plate" and throwout bearing all look different from the usual
manual-tranny items, though.

Can the factory wheel locks affect the balance of the wheels?

Maybe the reason the shaky steering happens off and on is
because whenever I remove the wheel, the wheel-lock is randomly
positioned on any stud. It just so happens on the most recent removal,
I re-installed the lock on the most out of balance position?

Hi Ken. Re:

I believe that if you buy McGard wheel locks from a dealer, those locks
weigh the same as the factory wheel nuts or bolts.  This is the case for
Jaguar, and is probably true for other "factory" locks that McGard makes
for the various car manufacturers.  

I spoke with the folks at McGard, and they told me that McGard's agreement
with the various car makes prevents them from selling you those "factory"
versions direct -- you _have_ to buy them from a dealer, etc.  Sometimes,
there's a difference between the "factory" version and the "generic" one
that McGard crosses if you call them directly.

Last weekend, my wife and I went out to get some new exterior care products
for our 944S.  We got what we were told is a good product--Meguiar's (spelled
something like that).  We got several steps, including a swirl remover.  

My wife took over the three step process of waxing once we got home.  I came
down to check on her progress after getting some other business done, and
much to my dismay, saw her rubbing *hard* to get the swirl remover stuff
off--way too hard.  

Further to my dismay, while fueling my car tonight, I saw the perfect finish
on my hood  horribly swirled by the rubbing and the compound designed to get
rid of the very problem.  Fortunately, my wife only used the stuff on the
hood, meaning the problem is localized.

What the heck can I do?  Get it taken in to have it professionally done, or
am I stuck with a crappy finish for as long as I own the car.  What can I
expect in terms of getting it to look as good as before?  Any help will
contribute to my peace of mind and the future peace and happiness of my

This isn't Porsche news, and commenting on it probably qualifies me as a

Fangio, driving a factory Mercedes F1 car at a vintage race ( during the 1st
or 2nd year of the Long Beach Grand Prix), and absolutely destroying the
competition! He was in his late 60's at the time, and among others, Sterling
Moss was part of the field! On the first lap, he (Fangio) came on to, and
exited,  the pit straight before any other cars were visible to spectators.

i have the dunlops you are referring to on my c4.  cold weather conditions

winter tires on all four wheels, using bridgestone blizzaks.  this
is a setup not for the meek.  it is very "squirell-y" and unstable
at higher speeds.  the upside is that you could drive the car over
the top of an iceberg if so required.  all in all, my experience is
that if you have *lots* of snow go with the all around snows.
although i don't have experience with other snow tires on my 
C4, i would recommend trying the pirellis, as the blizzaks simply
have too much tread depth for light snow conditions.  the car
appears to be floating on the tires.  they are marvelous in deep
snow however.  if you are in a serious winter clime, i would go
for all around snows.  l live in pennsylvania which has semi
serious winters, and the dunlops don't cut it.  downside is that
you live with the car always feeling very "loose."  it makes you
a better driver though, particularly when you go back to the 
dunlops.

Greetings P-philers
for those of you who ain't electricians/mechanics can probably skip this
post...it's gonna be a long one...
I have this '68 912 with no turn signals.  I have all the other lights, but
no turn signals.
I have done the following:
a. consulted the factory wiring diagram(s) the color one for the original
911s and the black & white version for the 912-does anyone have the
foggiest idea where I might find the color wiring diagram IN COLOR for the
912? (hint: the guys in Reno have no clue-they said a color version of the
912 diagram  is in the OWNER'S MANUAL? has anyone else heard of this?) I
have all the factory workshop manuals pertinent to this car. I do not have
any parts catalogs though
b. tested ALL wiring for continuity-results all positive.
c. replaced the lower relay (down in pedal box with newer relay as old one
was NLA - howard adams in reno swears I have correct superceding part-I
have connected it according to the diagram, with howard's help...
d. replaced the upper relay (one by fuse block in trunk) This part bothers
me...the original relay posts are labeled (with north orientation, and
going counter-clockwise) "49a" ," KPC", and "15x49"
 - the replacement relay posts are labeled (again with northern orientation
and going counter-clockwise) "49", "49A" and "31"  again, this part is
supposed to be the correct superceding part as this relay is NLA, like it's
aforementioned brother down by the pedals.  The original relay sits there
and gets REAL HOT when I activate turn signals-new relay doesn't work at
all, I suspect incompatibility.
e. replaced the turn signal switch with one out of earlier car-this swap,
so far, has made no difference.
f. have checked/re-checked the wiring and fuses in the fuse
block-everything seems to be correct there.
the frustrating thing is this: I had all this shit working once (albeit
with the ORIGINAL turn signal switch-which had lots of other problems,
thereby prompting a swap) and then I took out the lower relay to put back
in a 914 (from whence it came...) and put a replacement relay in the 912.
I tested the replacement relay in the 914 first and it worked fine...
Does anyone out there have any ideas here? I can't be the only one that has
suffered from this particular gremlin.  does anyone know of any electrical
magicians? voodoo doctors? I'll try anything at this point.
If I don't resolve this problem *&#@* soon, I will probably say "screw it"
and turn this car into a "PCA event/autocross special" and go find another
street car that I can actually drive.  Out here in sunny southern
california, hand signals are a dangerous idea...the car is actually worthy
except for this damnable turn signal problem.
The little voice in the back of my head says;  "Track material..."

I need brakes soon for my 86 951.  My car is used mostly as a daily driver on
the street with speeds occasionally over 100 mph.  I have also been to a
driving school at Sears Point, where the car gets driven fairly hard, and I
will probably return someday.  

My question is what are the choices and trade-offs in brake pad brands and/or
materials?  Is there one brake pad material and/or brand that is clearly
superior to all others or are all brake materials pretty much the same?  I
don't consider cost a major factor because of the importance of brakes and the
low frequency in which they need to be replaced, but I don't want to spend
extra money just to get a "brand name" either.  Two choices that I have seen
so far are:  "lifetime guarantee" over the counter Rabestos brakes from a
local Pep Boys for about $38 or OEM brakes on sale from the dealer for a
little over $30.  

Below I have listed the Brake Pad properties that I can think of that might be
important, but unfortunately most of these properties are not specified on the
package or any where else that I know of for the different brands of brakes.
>Coefficient of Friction; cold
>Coefficient of Friction; hot
>Abrasiveness; how fast it wears the rotors
>Conductivity; how fast the pads can conduct the heat away
>Temperature Resistance; how hot it can get before it is damaged

same driving conditions, your mileage may vary)
>Dust; how fast do the wheels get dirty

Subject:      An evening of Porsches


Well, it all began with plans to go see the new Hugh Grant movie "Nine
Months".  I decided to take my 928 because I hadn't driven it in several
days and the weather has been great.  I arived at my Mom's house outside
Wash. DC in a cute little town fittingly named "Old Town, VA".  I
quickly washed it in front of the house while several tourists walked
by, many stopping to look and comment on the car(this always makes you
proud!).  Then off we sped to the 8PM showing of what turned out to be a
very amusing movie.  Of course the highlight was Hugh's incredibly red
late 80's/early 90's 911 Cabriolet.  It definitely should have been
included in the credits, it had more screen time than some of the
supporting actors!  There were 2 sad parts, though, when he swerved off
the road and totaled the  front end(mechanic checks it out and exclaims
"good thing the engine is in the back, yuk yuk!")  and when he decides
to trade it in for a Ford Explorer to show his ball and chain, I mean
wife, that he is serious about having a baby(read 6,900 mile 944 turbo
for sale guy!)  Anyway, that's when the Porsche fun ended in the movie,
but I still had my 928 to look forward to driving home!  And what a ride
home it was!  I dropped of my parental unit, and started heading out to
the George Washington Parkway back to DC.  As I was approaching the
parkway I noticed some interesting headlights coming up behind me.  As
soon as I turned onto the parkway I realized that it was a 944.  We were
acting very civil and driving at normal speeds between the several
stoplights in Old Town.  We finally ended up at the last light before
the parkway opened up, right next to each other.  He smiled, I smiled
back and I started checking out his car.  It was black, like mine, and I
was trying to figure out if it was a turbo or not.  I decided that it
was not because of the boxyness of the car and a prominent rear spoiler,
when I always thought turbos were more rounded.  Well, I decided to keep
it civil and not "take off" merely to embarass him in his 944 with half
of my engine.  Well, he obviously did not feel the same way, for when
the light turned green he took off.  I remember thinking "poor guy, I'm
going to waste him".  I floored it and quickly caught up.  I shifted, he
shifted and I was watching my tach to shift at 5.7K and when I did this
I looked up, expecting to see him in my rearview mirror, but instead he
was right next to me!  I was instantly confused, how could a 944 keep up
with me?!  We both let up at about 70MPH(note people who chastised me
before for going 125 in a 45) and continued to play *SAFELY*(god, I feel
like I'm talking about sex!) with each other all the way to Georgetown.
It turns out that it was a 944 TURBO.  I felt better when I saw this.  I
should hope a '86 would be able to stay side by side with an '80 928!
Well, that's my night of Porsches, god I love my car!!!

perhaps an hour run every 2/3 weeks. Suddenly the battary is going down. 
If I disconect it it holds its charge, but if connected the car drains 
it. Last night I took it out for a run after charging it. I put it back 
in the garage all seemed well. This evening I went out to be sure all was 
well to find there was no voltage reading. Nothing! 

During the day the car had completely drained it. I am quite sure no 
lights had been left on. The only visible item drawing anthing is the 
Porsche alarm. However I am suspicious there is some sort of control 
unit/relay which is not cutting off when it should. Any ideas? Could it 
drain 'backwards' through the alternator.

One odd item of behaviour,after I had recharged the battary, but with a 
cold engine, when I first reconnected it, the cooling fan went on/off 
several times. Ideas?

One last question. Will a battary stand being completely drained and 
recharged, or should I assume its a write off? Its trickle charging right 
now and seems to be doing fine, but its not connected to the car!

Thanks, Steve.(UK)

I am currently in the process of looking for my first 911 and wish to 
understand more about these wonderful cars before I part with my 
hard earned cash.
A dealer( who was trying to put me off a car at one of his 
competitors) said that the year of registration was no where near as 
important as the year of build and mileage. He claimed that cars got 
stockpiled from '89 and zero cars were manufactured through to 1993.
I find this somewhat alarming and wonder how much truth there is in 
this statement.
Can anybody cast any light on this?

	Yes, the wheel locks can definately affect the wheel balance.

	Can't remember about my 944, but on the 911 the end of one of the wheel 
studs is painted (red on mine). Porsche advice is that the hole nearest the tyre 
valve *must* go on this stud, and the wheel lock *must* also go on this stud.

	BTW, doubt it will affect wheel balance :-) but in a recent Excellence 
article it was stated that the bottom of the crest on the centre cap should 
point to the valve for maximum concours points. I've looked at various factory 
literature and press photographs and the orientation of the crest always seems 
to be random. Any concours nuts out there like to comment?

Also, I have opened up the zipper and motor compartment of the

move the cables with either the motor, the hand crank, or with a

Alex,

There's a connector on the outside of the transmission case for this,
which gets dirty and loose.  It may be two single-contact connectors or
a double-contact, I forget.  Anyhow, clean it, make sure the contacts
are tight, and you should be all set.

>I'm concerned about oil pressure and bearing chatter.

A. First check the ignition system.  Timing, distributor cap, rotor, wires, 
plugs, plug gaps.  This is pretty standard.

B. Next check the fuel pressure.  Make sure the fuel filter is clean and that
the pump is delivering the proper pressure at various RPMs.  Fuel pressure
regulators can be troublesome.  Again, pretty standard.

C. With ignition and fuel okay, the problem becomes more interesting.
Look for air leaks, aka "false air".  This is air that gets into the engine 
behind the air flow meter.  If this un-measured air gets in, the engine
will run a little lean.  It should be okay after warm-up, when the fuel
injection computer runs in closed-loop and adjusts mixture based on the
feedback from the ox sensor.

You can use a stethoscope to listen for leaks.  Check the injector seals,
intake gaskets, and maybe the vacuum lines for the brake power booster,
fuel pressure regulators, and others I'm overlooking.

If you reach this point and everything's okay, now you gotta look at
sensors (air flow and temperature in particular) and the L-Jet computer.

This is my guess.  I haven't had this problem, but cold idle problems
are a common annoyance of my other car, a Saab 9000.  In fact, I took
these steps from the Saab mailing list.  Should be pretty similar since
the fuel injection components are very similar (L-Jet & LH-Jet).
Hope it helps.

Dan,

I just completed a swap from a sporto to a five speed this spring. Once you
gather all the required parts, the swap is actually not that difficult;
everything is just bolt in and bolt out....there is no cutting or welding.
The clutch tube that you need for the clutch cable should already be
installed in the main tube.

I traded the old sporto trans but I threw out the clutch disk and assembly.
When I did it I knew I would regret it, it could have been anyones for the

From: dougie@physics.att.com (doug dykaar)
Subject: Re: Brakes

Street pads are fine for the street, as they stop without needing to be
heated first. The trade off is that they insulate the heat in the rotor.
Thats good for the street, as you'll warp the rotors, but still be able to
stop in the limit of big braking.

On the track this gets to be annoying. I toasted two sets of rotors using
stock pads (duh). My first change was to the original performance friction
carbon pads. They work fine at the track, but not nearly as good as stock
on my 4 mile commute. If you aren't going to start swapping components, I'd
get a set of carbon track pads and swap them for the track weekends. Its
not a big deal on a porsche to swap pads, especially since you have to
bleed the old fluid out before each event anyway.

Adding the cool brake kit is also a good idea for track use. It replaces
the indirect system of vanes used to direct air at the rotors with real
race car style ducts and hoses. They work, but won't compensate for overly
heavy left feet.

If you ARE thinking about surgery, there is no limit ($). I'm running the
"red" calipers off the 3.6 turbo and RSR 911, with 12.75" Coleman rotors.
The kit is from VCI in Joisey. The new GT-1 911 turbo evolution, currently
making 600 hp (pano), can be had with 15" rotors. As I discovered, this is
the usual spiral. The new calipers are too wide for the fuchs wheels, so I
needed new wheels, the new rear wheels hit the body so I needed new
suspension, the new suspension lowers the car, so I need new front control
arms...

Actually, you'll want to keep up with the control arm soap opera. Even if
your car is bone stock, its coming up on ten years old, and you should
check the arms for wear and loosness, especially where the ball joint is
attached to the hub carrier. The front suspension on the 944 series is off
the VW rabbit, and while there have been evolutionary changes, the current
problems reveal the limits in both the rabbit design, and the factory's
attention to same in the intervening years.

have fun,

broken out of the contact surface of larger nylon spring retainer/thingy,
the other had a big burr on the top, flat part of the shifter 'ball' which
scored the inside of the shifter housing. The inside metal piece that's held
in place by the springs is perfect on one, the other has slight wear along
the ~1" reinforced piece.

Anyway, putting the 'best' pieces together: The remaining "good" shifter has
a bit of a wear indentation on the shaft about an inch down from the guts of
the assembly. I haven't figured out what effect this might have, yet...

Anyway, back to the question:  Anyone have tips for installing/compressing
the springs?! In hindsight it looks like if you had something to keep them
compressed-before removal-then you could just drop them back in. I'm past
that now though!

One more question : The bushing in the lowest part of the arm...How
tight/loose should it be? (Each was kind of corroded in place) Should I
Locktite it in place, or is it meant to rotate freely(i.e.: grease!)?

I've been reading postings about short shift kits, and they obviously
include the shifter arm. Do they include any of the other pieces that I've
found broken/damaged/worn in my latest adventure? (Obviously not the housing
itself!) Might be a good idea for those planning to go the short-shift route
to take theirs apart before-hand to see its condition. 

One last note, I do have 1 remaining shifter assembly that I haven't taken
apart---just in case!

Thanks for your help!

Subject: 911SC Oil leak / Smoke / Help



Help,

My 1981 911SC began to smoke ALOT last night on the way home.
Not from the exhaust pipe, but from oil leaking somewhere from
the front of the engine onto the muffler / heat exchanger.  Near
the front oil cooler on the engine.  It looked like my car was 
on fire.  The OEL light on the dash came on too. 

3 weeks ago, I put too much oil in the car (13 quarts) and it did
the same thing.  I called a mechanic who said drain a few quarts
and it should stop.  I did and it did stop, but I never found where
it was leaking from then.  This seems to be the same area, but I 
checked the oil level and it now is not even registering on the
stick.  Could this leak have been cause weeks ago with too much oil?

It sort of seems to be where the oil cooler is, in front of the
engine case, towards the passenger side of the engine compartment.
Is there a pressure release valve or a common oil seal that fails
there on a 911.  The car has 60K on it.  3 weeks ago, I tried to
get at this oil cooler (before talking to mechanic) and I had a
hell of a time trying to do it with the engine in the car, even
though a few people said it could be done.  What else is back there
on top of the engine behind all the FI and manifold stuff, that may 
spring a leak to let oil drip onto the exhaust system?
Thanks.

I think you're right.  But be sure to discuss the method of securing your car
in the truck.  On a move several years ago, I had my pristine '77 280Z shipped
in the moving van.  I did have a car cover, but the movers secured it by
running straps OVER the car and through each wheel well to the floor, one on
front another on the back.  The constant jarring of the load during travel
caused the straps to buff clear through the paint on all 4 quarter panels.

Subject:  Steamed at Stupidity

Yesterday, I am following a Continental on I-275 in Detroit in my '79 SC.  I
was following him because he was moving at the proper speed limit plus
9 mph.  Unfortunately, he was also talking on the phone ( no he didn';t
have a backwards cap, or white golf hat).  At the last second he threw
up his hands AFTER he ran over 75% of a semi-truck tire that was laying
in the center lane.  He managed to kick the tire up, it hit my car under the
bumper and dented the hell out of the airdamn/fascia.  I am pissed
because;

1.  Why can't people drive with visibility more than 3.5 feet in front of
their car?
2.  If they can't talk on the phone and drive, shouldn't they choose?
3.  How can trucks just shed their tires and leave them in the middle of
the road to be met by my wallet?  I noticed 4 other tire carcasses in the
highway during the next 10 miles as well as a mattress.
4.  Does anyone else have this story and did you sue somebody.
5.  Most importantly,  I seek advice on where to get a replacement fascia
for less than the price of a new car.  Send me e-mail directly to avoid
cluttering the list.

I don't believe that I was following particularly closely.  There was a
good 4-5 car lengths between us but certainly not enough to react to still
life tire corpses.  Thanks for letting me vent.

        Okay, gang, the pump is out of the car (well, in the trunk).  I
jumpered the two pins directly to the battery, making sure to get the +
and - leads correct.  I felt a hint of (I think) longitudinal movement
from the pump body, but no vibration and no whirring/humming noise.  I
take it this means my pump ist ja toasten.
        WTB:  One early (pre-75) fuel pump.  Working and cheap.

        Also:  I disconnected the pump from the fuel lines to take it
out of the car.  I had anticipated a gush of gasoline from the supply/
suction line (the one with the 9mm OD "hard" line).  Got nothing.  Then
I took the "return" line off the pump--GUSHER!  This is the one connec-
ted to the 7mm OD "hard" line through the tunnel.
        I believe that both lines are simply connected to the bottom of
the tank.  Is this true?  Is there a check valve in either line?  Is
there a screen in the bottom of the tank that I need to clean?  If so,
how?  Any other reasons that fuel would come out the return line?  The
right-rear corner (only) was jacked up and supported by jackstands.
Could this be the reason?  Why?

        Please help, I'm getting very frustrated by my inability to even

as a '71 non-sunroof coupe which has never been in an accident nor does 
it have any rust. Modifications include: full IMSA spec roll cage tied 
into all door jambs pillars and shock towers, set-up for coil over RSR 
suspension, fully adjustable mounting for turbo trailing arms, Bracketing 
for upside down transmission, bracketing for rear entry motor 
configuration and 935 rear spring plates w/ heim joints. This car has 
been prepared with serious competition in mind. The craftsmanship is 
beautiful and the welds are georgeous. In addition to all the 
fabrication work that has been done the car has been fully seam welded. 
It woiuld cost over $10,000 to reproduce what I have collectig dust in 
my garage. I want to see the car go to someone who will build and race 
it. I am asking $4500 for the chassis and a few spare parts, considering 
all the time and materials that were put into this car this is a steal.

(Gad, now I forget the name.  Something must be repressing the memory!)

Anyway, there's a shop on Old Middlefield in Mountain View that does
medeocre (sp?) work with an attitude.  They were recommended by
the GGR PCA people, but I have no idea what they did to get that
recommendation.

I had to take my car back twice to get it "better".  They never did
get it right.  I also had to replace a couple of bolts that they
had tightened with vice-grips.

If somebody out there does know of a *good* shop, I'm all ears!

Subject: 87 and later 944 water pump removal


As Kevin pointed out, it is possible to remove the water pump in a 1987 
or later 944 or 968 without removing the lower pulley (dropping the 
starter and using a flywheel lock, then removing the 190 ft-pd bolt 
from the cranckshaft).

You must, however, remove all pullies and the self-tensioning units 
from the engine to jockey the rear cover off the front of the engine.
968 owners may have to also replace any seals between the hydraulic 
belt tensioner and the block. 

Just did one, it is about the same time-wise, but easier than pulling 
that G** D**** pulley.

Typically a problem with the fan speed resistor block, which is located
on top of the fresh air blower.  The block has dropping resistors which
adjust voltage across the fan motor.  When it ages, the resistors
delaminate, overheat, and open some one or both of two internal breakers
in the resistor block assembly.

Call George B. at 944 Ecology for a good used part.  You don't want to
know what PCNA charges for 'em.

Subject: Black Again

Here's a little plug for that product called "Black Again". It's an external
treatment and protectant for black plastic, rubber, and metal trim. I used it
on all my external hard rubber trim and was quite pleased. Then I used it on
the black air intake grill on the lid, which had a distinct gray tint ('79
911SC) and was even more pleased. Finally, I thought I'd try it out on the
Fuchs, which are beginning to ask for new black paint. Amazing! The dullness
is gone and the black is much deeper. They still need to be refinished
because of thin/scratched paint in places, but this is a great improvement
until then.

It doesn't seem to make any difference on the black manual antenna, and it
didn't work as well on the side trim as it did on the mirror, smile, and
bumper trim. I don't know yet if multiple applications improve the
appearance.

Larry at Carcare Specialties carries it. Dunno who else does. If your black
is fading at all then give it a try.

Steve, I had the same problem last year in my '89 944. Turned out to be the
temperature sensor switch in the radiator. The switch was 'stuck' in the
closed position, keeping the fan running all the time. They normally 'fail' 
to the
closed position. It doesn't take long to drain the battery. The part is 
simple
to replace in the 944, takes about 20 minutes total.  I replaced mine with 
an
AUDI component. Local Porsche Master Technician advised to do so. It is
the same part manufactured by the same people to exactly the same
specifications but about 2/3rds the cost (about $35). BTW, your battery
should bounce right back.

Date: Saturday, July 15, 1995 6:23AM

My 968 has been having a rest. Little use over the last 4 months -
perhaps an hour run every 2/3 weeks. Suddenly the battary is going down.
If I disconect it it holds its charge, but if connected the car drains
it. Last night I took it out for a run after charging it. I put it back
in the garage all seemed well. This evening I went out to be sure all was
well to find there was no voltage reading. Nothing!

During the day the car had completely drained it. I am quite sure no
lights had been left on. The only visible item drawing anthing is the
Porsche alarm. However I am suspicious there is some sort of control
unit/relay which is not cutting off when it should. Any ideas? Could it
drain 'backwards' through the alternator.

One odd item of behaviour,after I had recharged the battary, but with a
cold engine, when I first reconnected it, the cooling fan went on/off
several times. Ideas?

One last question. Will a battary stand being completely drained and
recharged, or should I assume its a write off? Its trickle charging right
now and seems to be doing fine, but its not connected to the car!

Thanks, Steve.(UK)

Thanks to those who replied to my question about the idiot light.  As several
of you suggested, the light is a brake system light, not an oil light. I
checked
the schematics last night, and that light is wired to two switches in parallel,
one that indicates that the handbrake is on, and one that they call the
"brake system failure" light.  I checked the switch for the handbrake and that
seems OK, but there is very little brake fluid in the reservior.  I'm going
to flush the brake system this weekend and see if that cures the problem
(pedal feels firm though).
At least it wasn't an oil pressure problem :-)

Subject: Super 90

Dirk,
A few weeks ago I posted about a beautiful 63 Super90 coupe for sale at a
very good price.  It was restored by Bob Grigsby, a very well respected
air-cooled Porsche mechanic here in silicon valley.  I've looked at the car
and can say without question it is a concourse quality job, inside and out. 
I think Bob was asking about $23k.

He has done nothing to advertise this beauty.  He keeps it in his Sunnyvale
garage and gets inquiries from customers.  It is a cream color.  Bob did two
significant improvements that will keep it from being a true show car but
which make it a great driver: 12v. upgrade and 4 wheel disks.

If you're interested I would give him a call very soon (or wait a couple of
weeks -- he's going on vacation later this week).  408-738-2060.  I think
he's having a hard time parting with it (having put 3000 hours into a bare
metal restoration) but I believe he's resigned to it and may soon be putting
it into a showroom down the block.

If you're interested in a 356 coupe this *is* the car.  I'm very tempted
myself but I'm struggling with too many cars and too little garage space as
it is.

I've had similar symptoms (oil leaking on heat exchanger -> smoke, oil

Anyway, less than 10.00 $ and the problem was solved. Let's hope it's not

I just replaced mine a month ago on my 87 930. I followed the step-
by step directions in one of the maintenance manuals I have purchased
recently. The job was not difficult. the process involves the removal
of the sunroof and installation of the 2 new cables. I purchased the
cables from automotion at $60 a piece. the cables actually include
the mounts. I can let you know the name of the book tomorrow.

the red ones are more manly, mainly. As I recall, the S4s are like 308 mm
diameter rotors, the reds are for 322 mm, and there's a larger Brembo
(without porsche's patented quick release), the F-40 size at 330 mm.

There is also a difference in rotor vaning in some setups. Race rotors have
a curved vent blade, which is more effecient at high speed, as opposed to
the normal radial vane. The rotors I have are also slotted, since holes
need to be cast in, and floating. You should be able to get a different
rotor setup from any number of vendors, see any pano.

Floating rotors are held on by ridges on the hub, and allow the rotor to be
positioned by the caliper under braking. This makes for less pulling under
load, although they clank at low speed. I'm also running cool carbons which
are ok as far as stopping on the street, as the system is now so
overdesigned, but they squeal like a stuck pig. I'd like to find a used set
of C-2 turbo street pads. Anybody?

Read an article in Excellence about the speedo senders for the water cooled

 Wrong, it's on the left front wheel on the 95's.  Porsche uses the ABS
sensor to drive the speedo.  I found out in trying to solve why my speedo
would read 150 mph slowing to a stop.  I had Performance Friction pads on and
the frequency of the vibrations, squeal, was just right to induce a signal
into the ABS sensor.

Barry,
There is a seal on top of the engine behind all the FI stuff for what I 
think is an oil thermostat switch. IMO you just about have to remove either 
the FI or the engine to get to it. BTDT. I've also had to replace the cooler 
on the engine and could not figure out how to do it without removing the 
engine. BTDT too.You can probably check the thermostat switch with a small 
mirror. Position it over behind the FI stuff  at an angle so you can check 
the top of the engine for oil leaks. The switch is roughly (very) a flat 
diamond shape 2-2.5" long ways with a slightly raised circular shape in the 
center.

 With the age of our cars and the low price of this seal, if you have the

replace this thermostat. Don't ask me how I know.

This isn't very difficult.  In a nutshell, you need to remove the bumper,
take the old "smile" off, put the new one on and re-install the bumper.
In practice, I had a little trouble getting some of the nuts that attach
the rubber bellows to the bodywork off and I had a little trouble putting
the bumper back on by myself (having a friend help would be nice).

Bought the "smile" from Vertex for $85.  Worked for me.

Gees...it's discouraging to hear so much misinformation coming from
supposedly knowledgable professionals.  "how much truth.." to this assertion?
 Ah...none.

There's a ton of info in the archives and FAQ's on late 911's.   I'll
summarize some of it here (no turbo info; USA cars):

* 993 (95 on, terrific C4 version in late 94).  $63k and up, new.  Porsches's
most impressive 911 ever.  Big leap in performance and quality (and
cheaper!).  New body type, improved ergonomics, ride, brakes, power, quieter
inside and out.  Too refined?  Too quiet?  Too easy to drive well?
* C4 (89-94).  $35k-$55k.  Great car but criticized by the press and
enthusiasts for it's fixed power ratio (front vs rear), slightly slower
performance (than sister C2), steeper price, and tendency to plow
(understeer).  Early teething problems with electronics, clutches and
cylinder heads (see C2 below).  AWD version lost some of the 911 charm.
* C2 (90-94).  $35k-$55k.  Same great engine (3.6) as the C4.  Until mid 91
fix, many had cylinder head problems requiring machining and new P/C's. 
Factory pretty good about doing the service (even outside warranty).  C2/C4
body (964 type) integrated bumper and paint color.  ABS.  Recent drop in
value due to cheaper 993.
* Carrera (84-89).  $17k-$35k.  3.2 engine very strong, very reliable.  Big
improvements in 87 tranny, clutch, ventilation.  Oil-fed tensioners for all
years!
* SC (78-83).  $11k-$22k.  3.0 engine.  DURABLE.  Exploding rubber center
clutch.  Fender flares alloedg *big* tires.  Creature comforts.  Getting
heavier...
* 911 (74-77).  $7k-11k.  Generally speaking, bad years.  2.7 engines had
stressed-out magnesium alloy cases and many had thermal reactors (all US
77's, and all CA 75-76).  The combination cooked seals, caused oil leaks and
other miscellaneous problems like pulled head studs.  Fairly short lifespan
before needing rebuilding (a "proper" rebuild can turn these engines into
high performance, longer lasting ones, however).  "Carrera" 911 had SC fender
flares.  
* 911 (69-73).  $5k-25k.  2.0-2.4 engines.  Very desirable early years. 
Longer wheel base, strong, peaky engines.  Old today and so not as reliable. 
Fuel injection on S and E models, T in 72.  S is highly in demand.  T least
expensive but good driver with lower range torque.
* 911 (65-68).  $5k-$15k  Original 911 with 2.0 liter.  Stunned the world. 
Targa body had zip-out plastc rear window (67,68).  Some teething problems
(front end shake, and wheel/tire balance sensitivity).   68 was a so-so year
due to air-injection system which caused a lot of overheating and leaned-out
trouble (ie, fouled plugs).

Notes:
 - Pre 77 cars, except for some 76's, were not galvanized.  Body rust was a
serious (and $$) problem.  WATCH OUT.
 - The early cars are also notorious for tail wagging.  Not a problem at all
for an experienced driver, even an advantage.  But dangerous to the
uninitiated.
 - Get your hands on the 10/93 issue of Panorama and refer to the article on
buying an older 911.   _The Used 911 Story_ by Peter Zimmermann is excellent
(spiral handbook for about $18).
 - Always have an expert 911 mechanic thoroughly examine the car *before*
purchase.

When I went to recharge my A/C system I learned that my fender mounted A/C
condenser leaks badly.  There may also be a leak in the hose fittings by the
condenser as well.  The car is an '83 911 SC Euro and it has an after market
A/C unit.
The hose fittings are easy to deal with, but I am clueless about the
condenser.  I assume it can not be repaired.  Thus, I am searching for a
source of used or new condensers.  The compressor is Japanese, Seiko, I think,
but I can't find a name or any numbers on the condenser unit.  
My questions are: 
1. Who is a good source for after market A/C Porsche units who might also be
knowledge about the different after market units that were available in the
mid 80s?  
2. What is this likely to cost?  
3. Is this a job I can do myself (note, there is no Freon left in the system)?
 4. This may be the most important question - Would it be wise to convert my
A/C system now to use the environmental friendly refrigerant as oppose to just
repair it to use Freon that wont be available in a year or so?

  The Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which
organizes the races along with Steve Earle's General Racing, Ltd., can be
reached at (800) 327-SECA. They should be able to provide you with all
of the ticket and scheduling info.

  This year's "Historic" will be held August 18-20. I've attended the Historic 
off and on for a number of years and I'd recommend going on both Saturday *and* 
Sunday. Saturday is a good time to cruise the paddock, vendor, and parking areas
(you can certainly judge the quality of this event by the *awesome* cars that 
can be found throughout the parking areas). Saturday is usually reserved
for special parade laps and festivities for the featured marque (Lotus this
year). If I recall correctly, Saturday's racing includes most of the "older"
pre-war machines, and ends with the mid-80's F1 cars. Sunday's racing
usually includes the 60's sports/GT cars and the 70's Can-Am/FIA cars.

  I've found that Saturdays are *much* more crowded than Sundays; come as early
as possible for the best (closest) possible parking place. The Monterey transit
buses run shuttles from "remote" parking sites to the track; the only drawback
are the horrendously long lines of people waiting for shuttles to return to
their cars at the end of the day! I believe that the gate ticket price is the 
same as the advance price.

  Hope this helps!

Subject: Recharging your A/C Condenser

In reply to your questions 

When I went to recharge my A/C system I learned that my fender mounted A/C
condenser leaks badly.  There may also be a leak in the hose fittings by the
condenser as well.  The car is an '83 911 SC Euro and it has an after market
A/C unit.
The hose fittings are easy to deal with, but I am clueless about the
condenser.  I assume it can not be repaired.  Thus, I am searching for a
source of used or new condensers.  The compressor is Japanese, Seiko, I think,
but I can't find a name or any numbers on the condenser unit.
My questions are:
1. Who is a good source for after market A/C Porsche units who might also be
knowledge about the different after market units that were available in the
mid 80s?
2. What is this likely to cost?
3. Is this a job I can do myself (note, there is no Freon left in the system)?
 4. This may be the most important question - Would it be wise to convert my
A/C system now to use the environmental friendly refrigerant as oppose to just
repair it to use Freon that wont be available in a year or so?



o Unless you already possess FREON you cannot buy it. I hope you bought
  a 30 lb ($240) before Nov. 94. Now only A/C certified mechanics can buy it.

o You can get hoses repaired at a hydraulic hose shop or remade. Check the
  yellow pages or your local airport repair facility.

  Many indepents stock hoses, receivers, condensors etc... Most stock some
  items but all so check around. Try BAP, Checker, AutoZone, PEP Boys etc...

o You need new O-rings when you remove hoses

o You need a new receiver-drier if the system is open to the air for more
  than a hour or so.

o You new a vacuum pump to evacuate any moisture before you recharge it.
  I got one for $19.95 from Harbor Freight Tools (runs off compressed air).

o You need a Freon R-12 gauge set (hi + low pressures gauges) about $40 - $60
  most auto parts stores

o An Electronic Freon leak detector to check nyour hoses & connections. Otherwise
  your just wasting your money, the Freon and zapping the environment. I got
  an electronic handheld one for $89.95 from J. C. Whitney plus $20.00 extra
  for an extension probe. For some reason the same things sell for $200 - $300
  at auto-parts stores.

o An A/C repair manual with pressure table. Get thew Haynes A/C manual.
  About $12 at AutoZone.

o Changing to R135 is a good idea if extensive rework is needed as everything
  legal to buy. Needs certain changes. You can really put on most any thing
  you want in terms of available compressors, receivers, driers, condensors
  etc... As long as they are compatible the only problem will be custom
  hoses & brackets. Suggest finding a good independent A/C shop. A dealer will
  eat you alive - they just want to put in new everything.

No, you'll be fine as long as you don't do any hot rodding in the

no problem, and will do it again this year. I would feel miserable

It runs all three days (August 18, 19, and 20).  Last year (my first 
historic races), they had practice sesssions on Friday andraces
Saturday and Sunday.  I think they went old to new on both days.

It was pretty crowded last year, but the marque was Ferrari.  You
can get a $30 one-day ticket or a $75 3-day ticket by dialing
1-800-327-SECA.

Subject: Fangio


I watched Fangio push the W196 around Laguna Seca a few years back.
He was quite a sight, but the Mercedes Benz people had a 500SL roadster
in front of him to slow him down, he was 81 at the time. Fangio expressed
that it wasn't representitive of the car to be held back like that. His
fellow Argentine F1 drive, Frolian Gonzales, felt the same way.
On the Sunday exhibition, the driver of the 500SL got a taste of what 
Fangio once did to his competition as they exited turn 9. Fangio 
bore down on the 500SL with full throttle, making the 500SL driver 
lose his concentration and loop off the course into the dirt. Fangio 
and Gonzales ripped past and had two full laps to themselves. Fangio was smiling and driving, driving the piss out of the GP car.

At the autograph session later we asked Fangio how the car felt. He 
replied (my translation) "After so many years, it was a good drive. We
stopped racing that car too soon. It felt good to feel 40 again."

He and Gonzales signed autographs, even an Argentine flag my buddy 
brought. It has been the only Monterey Historic that honored a single 
man.

What can happen is that the car might run fine at idle, but starve for
fuel at higher RPM's.  This happened to a friend running an MFI 911 in
vintage events.  He chased his tail with the MFI system for about a
year, maybe longer.  His mechanic *finally* had the "oh shit" realization
of what was up!

That's a good Fangio story. Even though I never saw the man, I heard other
stories that made him a legend, like once in a race when he hit a barrel or
something on the edge of the racetrack while going tight around a corner
and a kid that was sitting nearby got up and put the thing back in the same
place. In the following laps Fangio hit the thing again and the kid kept
puting it back. At the end of the race, which of course Fangio won, he went
to the kid and thanked him because that barrel (or whatever it was) marked
the fastest (and clearly not obvious) way around the corner.

Phil (or anybody else), if you know more stuff about Fangio, I would like
to know.

I've never used it, but there is special goop to put behind the pads to
keep them from squealing. Try a car parts place. Grease of any kind and
brakes are bad idea. I've never had the problem with stock brakes on my 86,
though.

There is a relay wired to the fogs. Get the wiring diagram. Technically,
the fogs and high beams are for different driving conditions. I also figure
that more light is better, when its safe enough to run high beams.

I don't have a precise schedule, but here is how it usually runs:
Friday is usually a practice day.  The pits are open and less crowded,
so it's a good day to see things up close.  Saturday used to be the
only race day, but now it's spilled over into Sunday as well.  As I
recall, they have practice/qualifying in the mornings and "official
races" in the afternoons.

It's not hard to get into.  I think you can buy tickets at the gate.
Saturday has usually been more crowded than Sunday, but I don't know
if that's still true.

My schedule will probably be:
Friday AM: Italian Concours
Friday PM: Historics
Saturday: Some Historics, maybe some other sights
Sunday AM: Pebble Beach (miss the mobs by arriving early)

Maybe I'll see you there.  Anyone want to plan a Porschephiles
gathering sometime during the weekend?  Where's a good brewpub in the
Monterey area?

I believe there will be practice Friday and races Saturday and Sunday.
Last year I went on Saturday and they had races in chronological order,
the 60s and 70s cars were in the afternoon. It's not too crowded
once you get in, but parking is a bit of an exercise. Try to get there in
the morning because it takes a while to park, catch the shuttle bus,
and get situated. Be aware that the remote parking areas can be very dusty,
so don't spend the morning detailing your auto before you drive it there. 

I think it cost something like $16 to get into the
races on Saturday. The paddock pass costs a lot extra ($20?) but shouldn't 
be missed.  The cars are BEAUTIFUL and should definitely be seen up close.
You don't have to buy tickets ahead of time, don't waste the extra $2-3 
per ticket, there's no way that they will sell out (we're talking several
square miles of hot, dusty wilderness here, and a few thousand fans).
Oh yeah- don't forget a brimmed hat and sunscreen.
It can be real hot. I prefer to bring beer money instead of lugging
an ice chest up and down the hills.

If you're thinking of staying overnight, make your hotel reservations now.
Every motel in Monterey and Carmel will be full that weekend.

If someone else has more schedule details, please post as they become
available.

Subject: Meguiar's Questions

Nathan Hanson just asked a good question about correcting a problem
involving a Meguiar's product.  I've used the #26 yellow paste wax for some
time but now find myself looking to clean my 84 944 before the next coat of
wax. I went to my local supplier of miscellaneous auto products (Meridian,
here in central Michigan, take your Porsche newsletter coupon) and
confronted a display of about 10-12 different products (all Mirror Glaze).
Each one is numbered and the "instructions" usually describe two or three
you should use before and two or three after the one in your hand.  I came
home a little confused and pulled out a few of my trusty mail order
catelogues - thought to be a good source of information.  Here I find (was
it in Imparts?) a two page display of Meguiar's products, all with numbers,
but it seems not the same numbers as in the Meridian Auto Supplies.  

I take this as time for some research.  I have found an array of products
with numbers that simply bewilder.  My list has stopped with (just numbers):
00, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19, 20, 26, 34, 36, 39, 40, 42, 62,
and 66.  I'm sure there are more.  Each of these also has a short name and,
at least in the catelog, a category (wash, cleaner, polish and ??). 

I've looked for Meguiar's on WWW to no avail.  Is there a source which
reduces this array to a manageable selection process.  I tried starting a
flow chart but gave up.  I now have a bottle of #5 for tough spots and
scratches, #6 to do the whole car once, and trusty #26 for the final shine
(thus, in that order 5-6-26).  But, I'm afraid to start.  Is my sequence
right!?  I'm afraid I'll have Nathan's problem.  I'm figuring on going over
the whole car at least twice.  Am I naive, will it take 3 or 4 or perhaps
15-18 steps??

Probably time for new pads and to get the rotors turned, be sure to have

to remove spiral action of brake lathe.  Be sure pads are in good shape

Yes I have done this, but I later added the Aux Euro driving lights.  The 
Aux Driving (951)
light now come on with high beams.  A special relay in the fuse box connects 
driving lights to 12v when high beams on. (relay was installed at factory  
but does nothing on US models, I added wiring and aux reflectors)

944 or 951
**Also, I had to modify the doggle in the fuse box to make it ROW compliant.
**and a few mods to wiring on under side of fuse panel.
 
A good retrofit is to use 7 inch H4 with 100/55w bulbs.
So now on high I have 2x100w 7 inchers and 2x100w driving lights (sucks 
power!)

Subject: IMSA GTS2 Sears Pt- We won!

     How I spent my last weekend:
     
     I'm currently having my 911 engine rebuilt by Rob King of S-Car-Go 
     Racing in San Rafael, California,  Rob was the mechanic for a GTS2 
     entry at Sears Point this weekend, and allowed me to join the crew as 
     errand boy/car polisher/CV joint ball cleaner.  Despite the job 
     description, I had a fantastic time.  GTS2 is made up of a pack of 
     911s, several Mazdas, and several Nissans.  The BMWs that normally 
     race were not in attendance.
     
     The car I crewed for is owned and driven by Kevin Buckler, who is in 
     the Porsche parts business (Racer's Group and Performance Wholesale). 
     The car is sponsored by Togo's sandwich shops, whose owner is a big 
     Porsche fanatic (a Ruf and an early modified 911).  This was Kevin's 
     first IMSA race, and he was driving a car that wasn't even driveable 
     until July 7!
     
     The car is brand new, having been built to GTS2 specs from a 1970 911 
     chassis.  It's amazing to see the transformation the car went through, 
     ending up looking like a brand new RSR.  The engine was a 3.6 built by 
     Jerry Woods (who stopped by with Bruce Anderson on Sunday) and 
     produces approximately 350 hp.  Engine management and fuel injection 
     was by Motec, and is all computer programmed.  In fact, a high idle 
     problem the morning of the race was solved in about one minute by the 
     Motec technician, simply by reprogramming the accelerator pedal 
     calibration.
     
     The car has all the usual goodies, including carbon fiber body panels, 
     RSR rear wing, adjustable heim-joint spring plates, coil-over 
     suspension, adjustable trailing arm mounting, transmission cooling, 
     and full tubing to reinforce the chassis.  One thing that caused 
     problems was wear on the CV joint: the extreme angle of the shafts as 
     a result of lowering the car so much really stressed the CV.  An 
     upside-down transmission mount will probably solve this.
     
     The car weighed in at slightly over 2100 pounds, and consistently 
     turned 1:42s.  Kevin qualified the car second, behind a purpose-built 
     tube-frame Mazda RX-7.  Kevin was ahead of all 911s, including a 
     factory-backed entry and several tube-frame cars.  It so amazed the 
     other teams that Alwin Springer, director of racing for PCNA, stopped 
     by to see the car's setup after qualifying on Saturday!  Everyone 
     wanted to know how this new driver in a brand new car could be going 
     so fast.
     
     The race was incredibly exciting, the longest 45 minutes of my life.  
     All cars pulled away cleanly after a false start, with about 10 911s 
     among the 15 entries.  Included in the field was the essentially 
     bone-stock 993 that was raced at Daytona.  (This car was turning 
     1:57s, in comparison to the race-prepared cars that were in the low 
     1:40s.)
     
     Kevin stayed in second place most of the first half, with 2 laps 
     running in front.  The Mazda began pushing him hard while he led, 
     though, and Kevin wisely let him by.  At about lap 15 (of 26 for the 
     45 minutes), Kevin's car started smoking heavily.  What was it? Oil? 
     Tranny? Tires rubbing because suspension sagged?  We couldn't tell 
     because the pits were upwind of the track.  Since Kevin's lap times 
     were still ok, all we could do was hope he didn't get black-flagged 
     and could finish the race. Shortly after this, the leading RX-7 slowed 
     suddenly with mechanical problems and pitted.  That left us in the 
     lead, with a strong battle between positions 2 and 3 allowing Kevin to 
     gain some breathing room.  Incredibly, the car held on and won by 9 
     seconds, finishing in front of an RX-7 and a 911. The crew was 
     ecstatic!  Kevin drove a great race and the car came through!
     
     We were then told to get the car to the winner's circle.  So our first 
     problem was: where the hell is the winner's circle?  As the car pulled 
     away to go find the winner's circle, it revealed a large spreading 
     puddle of transmission fluid, the cause of all the smoke.  Turned out 
     that a line to the transmission fluid cooling pump was leaking, but 
     the tranny held on to the end.
     
     My congratulations go out to Kevin, car fabricator Roger Hamlin, and 
     mechanics Roger Hawley and Rob King.  The teamwork required to build 
     and run a successful racecar are truly awe inspiring.  I can't wait to 
     get my own car on the track, even if it's only a PCA driver's event.  
     I can always pretend!
     
     Thanks for bearing with me.  It was so exciting I had to write about 
     it.

I've notice the same thing on my 86 951

(reads 106 when doing 100) checked with highway markers.

I presume it has to do with tire size being too small for calibration of

    The definition of "not following too closely" involves leaving
    enough room to react to ANY unforeseen circumstance.  At -- how
    fast did you say you were going?  64 or 74 mph? -- That probably
    means a MINIMUM of 7 or 8 car lengths, not 4 or 5.  How'd you
    manage to get through Drivers' Ed without hearing about the "one
    car length for every 10 mph" or "two-to-three seconds between you

Subject: 944 Lug nuts - weighed

In trying to determine whether wheel-locks can affect balance, I
weighed the factory nuts on my 944 phone-dials:

Regular lug nut : ~20 g

Hollow lug nut:         ~25 g
Lock + Plastic Cap: ~25 g

The locking nut weighs more than double a regular nut. The balance
weight stuck on the wheel is only 21 g. It so happened that the lock nut
was on the stud closest the valve stem. Maybe this had an additive affect?
But then again, maybe this is insignificant as the lugs are so close to the
wheel centre. Anyways, I moved the lock-nut opposite the valve stem.
We shall see tomorrow...

Keep in mind that the tire probably came off of wheel 14 in the back and 
the driver didn't know he lost it til his next stop.  As for the mattress 
 - I guess someone's sleeping on a boxsprings tonight!

I tried to go after the DOT in Florida over just such as this (a DOT sign 
had come off of the stand (men at work) and was invisible at night).  
Front wheels went over, but vaccuum sucked the sign's edge up and ripped 
off my right heat exchanger and muffler and the right rear tire was 
totalled.  The lawyer I contacted just laughed and apologized for not 
being willing to take my case.  Calls to the State Patrol were greeted

In-Reply-To: <199507181306.JAA05285@ew0200.ASTRO.GE.COM>
First off, thanks to all of you that sent useful ideas. 

Finally I got the car up to the dealer, and he said that it was either 
the thermostat, or a relay in the control box. It WAS the relay. He 
fitted a new one and charged parts and labour to warrenty.

The battery only went all the way down once, and appears to be fine. I 
hope that if it fails, it does so soon, since the car will soon be 2 
years old which is (I think) the end of the warrenty period. The idea of 
a trickle charger through the cigarette lighter sounds good. I will look 
around for one. Here in the old world (the UK) I am not sure such a thing 
has been invented. Perhaps its my lack of technical knowledge! 

The obvious answer, to disconect the battery turns out to be not too 
smart, because the car then looses a lot of its settings. While after 10 
mins or so it should re work them out, the dealer says it often does not, 
and has to be reset from the computer in the garage. 

So, if you dont use the car very frequently, you get into a catch 22 
situation. If you dont use it the battaery goes down. If you disconect it 
the car looses its memory. Oh, and for a reason I do not understand, you 
cant charge it with the battery connected! The dealers suggestion was 
start it up once a week and just let it run in the garage. He has no idea 
however how long to run it for to replace the loss from starting and a 
weeks standing. Anyone? 

Hopefully I will get more time to use it soon, which will be the best 
solution!

One of you asked 'what is a 968cs'? The cs stands for club sport. Perhaps 
it was only released in the UK & Europe. Its a 2 seat(recaro) 968 with 
low profile tyres, lowered suspension, 17" wheels, engine, gearbox (with 
closer ratios) and wind up windows and some lights. Not much else, so the 
weight has dropped. The result is its cheap, quick and much less to go 
wrong. (Except for that relay!)

Thanks again, Steve.

It is not a big problem to replace the smile, assuming you are not intimidated 
by the thought of removing the front bumper. Basically you need to unsnap the 
little nylon clips which hold on the rubber strip at the front of the bumper, 
separate the bellows at the side from the bumper and then unbolt the 4 bolts ( 
2 on each side) which hold the bumper on to the mounts. You should be able to 
separate the bumper at least far enough to reach the screws which go around 
the outside edge of the headlight bucket (from the underside up and the 4 
screws inside the front trunk panel and the thing comes off. Replacement is 
(to quote the British) reverse of the previous steps. Note I don't have air,

Subject: Cure for Steamed at Stupidity

You hit something in the road.  This indicates you didn't have time to
react and avoid the obstacle.  This means you were following too closely/
overdriving you lights/not paying attention/calling ET on the bone phone/
(fill in the blank _________).

I'll bet that trucker never knew he lost a tread till he pulled it in for the
night.  (If I see a truck with a tread aflappin' in the wind, I try to signal
him - from *in front* of course.)  You don't hear that Stinkin' Lincoln pilot
bitching do you?  (or maybe he is - on the "Lost Lincoln Net")   *You're*
the one with the bunged fascia and *you're* the one that'll end up paying
to make it right therefore, *you're* the one that's got to keep his eyes
peeled and WATCH OUT!

My car rides so low I've gotten used to removing the fascia, banging it
out and painting it  on a yearly basis (don't even bother with putty any 
more,  you just wouldn't believe what chipguard can hide down that low).
I used to p*ss and moan but now try to look at it as "maintenance".

Are the roads safe?  No.  Will they ever be safe?  Probably not.  Best
defense?  Maintain an elevated level of alertness AT ALL TIMES.
It requires a bit more effort than "regular driving" but is one helluva
lot easier that straightening pinged sheetmetal.  (no IMHO here, I
this for a fact).  

Having sat through this sermon, you may ask, "If you're so good, Mark,
how come you're still pulling the front end off every year?"  Answer:
cause I SCREWED UP!  It's *my* fault.  I've gotten so used to driving
I sometimes loose sight of how dangerous hurtling down the road
at speed with all those other lunatics can be.  Then, WHAP!, and
I'd give nearly anything to be able to take back the previous minute.

Just a though for all the whiners out there who always think it's the
other person's fault.  I need to step off this soapbox, sit on it, and
finish this brake job I've started.

Subject: Sell 944 Turbo or Keep the Kids?

To: David, David, Alan,

And all the rest of you guys that have the unmitigated *gall* to
suggest I'm not a "sensitive, 90's sort of guy" and that I value
my car more highly than children.  I broke down over the weekend,
borrowed one of my friend's children, and took the little monsters
for a ride in my beloved P-Car.  Can you believe the ungrateful
little wretches were less than impressed?  

My question is:  How do you get all those little fingernail scratch
marks off the inside of the trunk lid?  Was I out of line when I asked
my buddy to pay to have it repainted?  Is there a product availabe
to get the urine smell out of Perlon carpet?

Whope, sheath them flamethrowers, boys.  Only KIDding! ;-} (pun intended)

Seriously:  I made the decision years ago to not have children.  I
reasoned (purely personal) that there are more than enough people
on this earth right now for my tastes without me going out there and adding
more.  Plus, I'm barely responsible for myself and don't need to be
taking on any 18+ year commitments.  I really enjoy my friends' children
and like to think I have a positive influence on them in some ways (choice
of automobiles, for instance).   I'll almost always give a kid a ride in
my car if they agree to follow the rules (get parents permission, buckle 
up, ask before touching any knobs, no food or drinks allowed).  *My* rule
is to drive as safely as possible to bring the precious cargo home in
one (undamaged) piece.  No "thrillers" till you're old enough to know
better.

I sometimes forget how much people think of their children (having
none myself) and sincerely apologize to anyone I may have offended.
Bottom line:  Keep the car.  Keep the kids.  Keep the job.  (you'll
need it to pay for it all).  And who says we can't have it all?

	I have seen such a device advertised in the UK in the Motoring & Leisure

could probably build one yourself cheaply from a battery trickle charge plus 
Cigarette Lighter plug (available in Tandys).

	If it *should* do it, but doesn't, and the car is still in warranty, I'd 
be chasing my dealer hard to get it fixed. Otherwise you may be laying yourself 
open to big bills in the future.

	BTW, I took a 968CS for a test drive last year. Beautiful car (and it 
got rave reviews from the press), but a bit too impractical for a daily driver. 
Even getting in and out of the Kevlar seats is a bit of a job for my (corpulent) 
body. How do Porsche get away with taking lots of bits out of a car and then 
charging *more* for it?

	For our transatlantically-challenged friends, PCGB also sell (sold?) a 
968 Sport which is halfway between the stripped-out Club Sport and the fully 
loaded 968. Don't have the exact spec but could dig it out if anyone really 
wants to know.

P.S. Am I missing bits when I get the Digest? Someone followed up to a posting 
about hitting a tyre lost by a truck ("Steamed at Stupidity") and I saw the

about wheel locks affecting tyre balance never appeared, though that could be a

Hi there -
- ----------
First, I'd like to thank everybody who responded 
to my 944 wooden hinge request. Looks as if building
such a piece could be a fine project for the winter, 
when the pcar is covered up anyway...
*
Also have a q. about the durability of the galvanized bodies 
of pcars. Saw a slightly dented and otherwise neglected 
looking 924 recently, and noticed something which seemed
to be corrosion on the one front corner and around the lower 
door area/wheel wells. What do you have to do (or rather, 
_not_ do after an accident) to be left with such an ugly 
looking body?? I thought the 924s were galvanized....
Does anyone have experiences with galvanized but still corroded 
pcars? What's the half-life of bare pcar metal compared to other 
bare car bodies anyway? And what's the correct procedure when 
repairing dents on galvanized metal (welding/drilling, pull, paint 
type jobs)? Is the galvanizing on pcars any different from the 
one Audi uses (having larger production numbers)?
Would like to know before needing a repair job!

Sincerely,

RE: Fog Lights and High Beams

The reason your fog lights go off when you turn on the high beams is that 
fog lights are not designed to work with high beams.  They are designed to 
augment your low beams.  Additionally, in some states it is illegal to run 
fog lights on anything but low-beam.

I'll try this on my car (since I'm going to repaint it anyway) and 
see if it does any major damage to the paint.  I don't usually use

Subject: 90 911 C4 Bleeding brakes ?

Fellow Porschephiles,

I am a new owner of a 1990 C4.  Over my lifetime I have bleed quite a few 
brake systems.  But none have been ABS and none have been as "complex" as 
the C4's.

And so I was wondering - can you bleed the C4s brakes they way you can 
any car?  In particular I am worried that since (I think) the hydralic 
fluid is shared between the brakes and the differential locks - how can 
you bleed the entire system?

Also, I can usually tell when a line has been flushed when I start seeing 
new fluid coming out the bleed valve at each wheel.  But if the fluid in 
the car is "new" looking then how do you know when you have flushed the 
line?  Is there a guess on the number of pedal presses needed to clear one 
of the four lines?

Any other hints would be appreciated.  I'm bleeding them in preparation 
for my first drivers' ed event.  I may have my shop do them (b/c of lack 
of time) but wanted to know how anyway.

Thanks,
Scott (scokelly@netcom.com)

You were OBVIOUSLY following much too closely otherwise you could have
avoided the confrontation with the tire. If you value your life and car
you should leave enough room between yourself and the car ahead to react to
any situation, including a live tire. You have NO ONE TO BLAME EXCEPT
YOURSELF. 4-5 car lenths at 64 mph is about half what most people need to
react, given that they are NOT normally poised, ready and waiting to react 
to
an emergency situation. If you were traveling at 74 mph your 
IRRESPONSIBILITY
is even more evident.

Stop whining, be a man and take responsibility for YOUR own mistake.

No, I think you're wrong there.  I had a tire flipped up at me as well, which
ripped my front plate and plate holder clean off.  Only a few hundred feet
would have prevented it.  It's hard to dodge something flying straight at
you.

Don't be so cynical.

In my case, a big truck hit the tire, flipped it at the car in front of
me, who flipped it at me.  Some things can't be avoided.  As for who to
sue -- I doubt you can -- even if you had the license number of the car
in front of you.  Things like this happen.  It's like the car in front
of you flipping a rock and breaking your windshield.  It it really the
fault of the car in front of you?  Is it really your fault?  Who knows.

According to the insurance company, it probably doesn't matter.

This depends on where you happen to be in the country... I used to live 
in Indiana (both northern and southern) and you could do this. In 
Mississippi, you can even have 20 car lengths if your heart so desires, 
but in New Jersey, if you back off even one car length at 55 mph, someone 
will cut in and use that space. Here, it really is a matter of having to 
trust the driver in front of you to not do stupid things or stop 
suddenly. There is no alternative but to stop driving. Like I said, the 
sapce will be used, and I have never seen anyone more than 10 ft. off of 
anyone's bumper, at 55 mph, 75 mph, or even 90 mph. In some places, 
that's just the way it is, it isn't irresponsibility, it's just the way 
things are.

People who attempt to drive and carry on a meaningful conversation 
without a handsfree phone are dangerous to follow, anywhere. Consider 
that this person is probably more concerned with the safety of whatever 
he's talking to or about than other people's safety. If you do have 
acellular phone, do what I do, pull off to the side of the road and use 
it... With only 10 ft. between me and that guy in front of me, I can't 
even afford the time it takes to look at the buttons and make sure I'm 
dialing the right number...

Same as if you're carrying a mattress on your roof and it slides off,
or some such.

The above are clearly the result of negligence.  The tire fragment,
given that the laws are geared toward average drivers, may not be.  It
is, however, something you could probably collect on if you have
comprehensive coverage.  I still have no deductible on mine, which
came in handy when someone keyed my Cherokee.  If you hit an animal,
that's comprehensive also.  Comprehensive claims do not raise your
premiums the way collision claims do, but if you have too many the
company may yank coverage or require you to take a higher deductible.

It's even this way in Utah.  But I still think it is irresponsible.
Not of individuals, but on the general driving population as a whole.

Hi

A while ago, I remember seeing some M474 suspension kits for 944's advertised
in Porschephiles (I think it was M474, it was an improved suspension kit)..
Are any of them still available? What does the kit include? One of my friends
recently bought an 86 944, and the shocks are shot. The car does not have a

 Any additional info would be appreciated.

I ran over a shovel a while back.  My car is too low to go over it, and I 
didn't see it in time to do anything about it (75MPH +/- - in a 55 Zone, BTW)

What was _embarassing_ was I had to stop, get the jack out, and lift the car 
up to get the damn thing out!  And I was stuck in an area with concrete walls
on both sides, so I couldn't get off on the shoulder!

My worst episode was taking out a deer between 50-60 MPH in a karmann ghia,
at night (of course) on Icehouse Road, off of HWY 50.  I then had to
crawl home with only the light of one of the stars and one parking light
that miraculously survived.   I sold that car for 50 cents and bought a
Scirocco (and put the change in a piggy bank :) ) and the day after I 
bought it I smacked _3_ deer - I ran into a whole pack of them at 6:00am 
again on Icehouse road!

The early 924s (through '79) only have the floor galvanized.
I have a friend with a '79 924 that has developed rust bubbles

Much of the floor pans are exposed metal with absolutely no

Fog light do not shine far ahead of the car the lenses on fog lights 
spread the bean along the front of the car so you see the lane markers 
etc.

Fog lights are not driving lights. Do not really do any good in normal 
weather condtions. Most of the time the lights are out of adj and shine 
toward the sky of straight down either way are useless.

Driving lights will light up the road in front of the pcar and result 
in better visability. Be careful with these as most will blind oncoming 
drivers and if that driver is a cop it is ticket time.

I appreciate the words of support in time of crisis ( banged-up valence)
and even the words of contstructive(I hope) criticism. Perhaps I was
following too closely to the 'gentleman' in the 5000 pound, 74 mph, phone
booth.  It just seems that there must be a certain level of risk and
performance that one can accept as a given when driving on public
roads.  I dare say that on most freeways, if a car was able to come to
an instantaneous halt (not possible but indulge me), there would be a pile
up of biblical proportions.  Would that driver be responsible for the
pile-up?  My view is yes.  If you agree, then you may also agree that
leaving something in the middle of the road is wrong, and that also not
watching the road ahead in time to react to it is also wrong.  And yes, 
not leaving enough room to come to a complete stop if an inanimate
object pops up between my car and my sight limitation (lincoln) is wrong. 
I just feel that my wrong is a lesser wrong, yet I am the one paying
100%.  There is some injustice here, and I passed it on to the only crew
that I thought might understand the sight of an ugly scar on a beautiful
machine.  UPDATE: since the tire was airborne after being hit by the car
in front of me, it is a comprehensive claim and not a collision claim.  My

Seems like 90% or so of BMW drivers (excluding yours truly) use

I always figured that fog lights were good for preventing someone from 
hitting me head-on, and the low beam placement does prevent blinding
yourself with your own lights. 

I really like the red rear fog lights that are popular in Europe. They

No they didn't import 930s in the early '80s.  An easy way to tell is
to look at the VIN in the windshield on the drivers side.  Grey market
cars have a string of 4 or 5 (can't remember) Z's at the beginning of

Hi Jeff,

Good race report on a fun race at Sears Point.

Jerry Woods and I would have loved to have been at Sears Point for more of
the weekend's racing activities, but we were in the middle of one of your 911
engine overhaul and tune up classes on Friday and Saturday and couldn't make
it. Jerry would have liked to have been there overseeing the engine he built
just in case he was needed. When I scheduled our classes at the beginning of
the year I guess that I just wasn't careful enough. Besides back then we
didn't know that Jerry was going to be building a racing engine for Kevin
Buckler's GTS2 car. Incidentally the 350 hp. that you mention as the output
of Jerry's engine is not accurate, it is much, much more. But then that is
between the engine builder and his customer, after all they are both
consenting adults. The output may not be as much as the 400 plus horsepower
some of Kevin's competitors claim, but as the results proved, it is adequate.
 If you want to know what you can get out of a 3.6 racing engine you can have
Jerry build one for you. Jerry is building a 3.8 liter engine for my Project
911 in our 911 Engine overhaul class. When the project cars it done I will
tell all. 

Thanks again for the fun article.

225/50-15s will fit your 7" rims without changing diameter (much). Thats
the setup on my "5". Think of it this way, the only thing keeping you from
flying off into the woods backwards are four small contact patches, each
about the size of your open hand. Any improvement you can make will go a
long way. The lower apect ratio is a shorter, stiffer sidewall, that will
speed up steering response.

Beyond wider tires, larger diameter wheels and wider, lower aspect ratio
tires usually require stiffer suspension to take advantage of the increased
grip. But hey, its only money.

Subject: 1988 944 Turbo S VIN number discrepancy


The 944 FAQ sheet indicates the 1988 944 Turbo S chassis number
should be in the 97JN50000- range. The VIN number on my newly
acquired 1988 944 Turbo S is WP0AA2959JN151550. The original 
dealer sticker for this car clearly indicates the 944 Turbo S 
option package:

    - 4 cly 2.5 liter 247 HP with larger turbocharger
    - sport chassis
    - 7Jx16 wheels with 225/50VR16 tires, front
    - 9Jx16 wheels with 245/45VR16 tires, rear
    - anti-lock break system
    - limited slip differential
    - all cloth interior
    - cloth door panels
    - full power seats
    - split rear seats
    - rear window wiper
    - headlight washers
    - protective side moldings
    - HI FI sound system
    - special interior

Can anybody tell me why the chassis number is for a standard
944 Turbo.

Why is everyone giving this guy so much s*** about his car getting hit

(like we have in Boston) where your're cut-off if you leave more than 8 
feet of space between yourself and another car.  Sometimes it takes more 
than lightning reflexes to avoid an object when it's travelling at a high

When Porsche first began using galvanized steel on it's cars the surface
quality/texture of the zinc coated steel wasn't that great.  As a result
there was a lot of metal finishing done by hand to achieve a smooth look.
 The metal finishing frequently removed most if not all of the free zinc
coating in some areas.  These areas would have no galvanic protection if
exposed to the elements.  If the damage was in a metal finished area and the
area was not properly prepaired prior to painting then it could rust, rock
chips are a problem.  Also if the area was prone to trapped water then all
bets are off.  Trapped water will eventualy penetrate any panel.

There have been some recent postings about this problem, and how expensive a
new console is. Well, it isn't expensive any more!

Here's a repeat of a posting I made a few months ago:



You NO LONGER must buy the entire unit for approx $150.

You can buy only the 'hinge'; PN 944 552 553 01 010. It now costs $19.
(When introduced about 6 months ago the cost was $13.)

The reason I keep calling it the 'hinge' is that this part is actually the
entire plastic bottom and hingable top frame. It lacks only the upper padded
leatherette top, which you re-use from your existing broken console.

Tools needed for installation: 1 phillips head screwdriver.
Time for installation: about 10 minutes.

Subject: Late model 911 windshield

I am looking for a source for a new OEM 911 windshield, with the built 
in antenna, for my 1988 911 Cabrio.  My local (Upstate SC) dealer quoted
 $2300 list installed (I howled in laughter as I was leaving :>) ).  
Several local glass shops quoted around $1000 installed.  (more howling!
 :>)))) ).  I need to replace the windshield as It has become somewhat 
pitted after 76,000 mi.  It is not bad enough to qualify under my 
insurance coverage, but it drives me nuts as the rest of the car is 
flawless.

I can buy an aftermarket windshield with no antenna for $180.  The OEM 
windshield without antenna can be had locally for $350.  I find it 
ridiculous that a built in antenna triples the price!  $400-$500 would 
be more like it.  I am interested in keeping the car original, so I want
 the correct OEM part.  I am capable of doing the installation myself, I
 just need to find a reasonably priced source.   TIA for any leads on a 
good source.

As to the previous messages regarding Porsches and kids, let me say 
this: I have found precious few things in life better than strapping my 
two year old daughter in as my co-pilot for a Sunday morning jaunt 
through the mountains of western NC.  Watching the sunlight streaming 
through the trees illuminate the grin on her face like a strobe, and 
listening to her squeal in delight while accelerating hard off of a 180 
degree switchback really makes my day.  We stop for an occasional 
waterfall or scenic view.  Watching her eyes light up at one of these 
"discoveries" is a feeling without description.  The bonus is it lets 
Mom sleep in as well.  I enjoy the car even more with my daughter along 
than I do without.  My advice, keep the car and enjoy them both.

I ran 225ZR50/16 DUNLOP D40M2s on my 83 944. Great traction & handling.
However the extra width puts a big strain on the steering, alignment and

only 10K miles. Tires more subject to asymmetrical wear. Now run 205ZR50/16

While we don't have the traffic problems to the extent of some of the

traffic problems during the rush hours. During those times it becomes
nearly impossible to keep a "safe" amount of distance in front of

AUTO CLASSICS 550
	this kit, produced by Auto Classics International differs from the
	"BECK" 550 in that it has the "rensport"-style doors on the rear
	fenders (better cooling and engine access) and uses a space-frame
	that includes side impact beams.  
	
	weight: 1400
	suspension: vw ball joint (front)
		    trailing arms, adjustable coil-overs, Z-bar
	
	note:use of trailing arm suspension gives room for a bigger

BECK VINTAGE 550 SPYDER
	
	This car differs from the ACI kit in several ways. First, it uses
	vw torsion bar suspension at all four corners and has an original-
	style ladder-type chassis. From what I can gather, the Beck is more
	like the original 550A (same chassis, same suspension).

>From what I've read, the Beck is more like the real thing technicaly, but
the ACI kit is said by some to handle better and have more engine compartment
space. If you are really interested you might see if Kit Car magazine has 
done a comparison (they were planning on it). I don't know, because I'm not
into fake Porsches. I think the 550 kits are neat, but what do you say to the
person who asks "Cool car; what is it?"? Response:"Thanks, it's a...well..a
...actually.."

 I saw one once in Kennewick Washington, chased it down in my 914 and pulled
along side to get a better look. At an intersection I leaned over and said
"Is that a real 550?" He glared at me real mean like and said "Just about."
At that moment I knew I could never own one because I too would always be on
the defensive. Food for thought.

it on Saturday morning, I went to an Autocross, then on Saturday afternoon,

Alan968 points out that the left front ABS speed sensor is the point of 
reference for the 968 speedo. This is correct as the Getrag 6-speed does
not have a provision for the magnet on the ring gear nor a place for a 
Hall sensor. 

All 924s, 924S and 944 up to the 1985.5 model use a speedo cable driven 
from the left front spondle/hub. All 944 models 1985.5 to 1991 use a Hall
pickup on the transmission in the area of the ring and pinion.

All Getrag 6-speed and tiptronic models use the left front wheel ABS 
speed sensor to derive vehicle speed. This also applies to 911 models as well. 

Makes me wonder whether mileage on the odometer is recorded correctly if
all wheels are locked up and you're sliding. Of course this could never 
occur with ABS, right? :-)

No problem, Joe. And yes, it has happened to me. Just this spring. It

to be a hand truck that came out of the back of a delivery truck. The gate
swung up and out that bugger came. It sure looked BIG when it came right
at the windshield of my Chrysler. Long and short of it was that I ended up
with a pretty good hand truck and some new paint and grillwork on my LAND
BARGE. Just couldn't get out of the way. I didn't get any sympathy from any-
one including the insurance company claim adjuster who just "tsk, tsk.....
shouldn't follow so close". I am much more aware of what is directly in
front of me as a result. But they are right. Sure, the guy SHOULD have
made sure his door was latched, but I also have a responsibility to "see
and avoid" and adjust my driving style as necessary, OR just accept that
S**T can and does happen, get out the old checkbook and continue on
when it does.

Sorry to hear you live in Detroit (just kidding) things are bad enough
here in Anchorage where drivers also practice the 1-car-length
rule at (usually) 65 during rush hour (and more often than not cut
someone off to get their car into a space that is 1/2 car in length).

Don't take any of the flame personally, it's been a great discussion

Just a note to clarify my comments on slaughtering a tire and valence.
I'm not sure from your address where you live, so I will assume you do
not live in Detroit (not many of us will admit it either).  This town has
some of the fastest and slowest drivers I have ever encountered.  You
are right that 74mph is irresponsible in some areas, but not in Detroit.
This speed is actually probably very close to the avg. for Detroit.  In
Nashville it would be excessive, also in Louisville and probably Chicago.
In Detroit, Boston, LA, I am pretty sure that it is the normal speed.  I 
used
to have to adjust each month when I went to Seattle because the normal
speed there is around 60 mph.

I just did not want you to think me a Fabio-like,speed demon.  I autocross
on weekends and attend the occasional track day to get my speed fix.  I
do not get it on the public roads since it is too unpredictable, as you
state.  Deep down, I'm trying to get you to admit that stuff falling off of
trucks and being left in the middle of the road is inherently wrong.  Also
that running over road obstacles as big as tire and kicking them up for
the guy following is also wrong.  If this happens to you, I hope it doesn't,
we will talk again and see if your opinion is any different.  Enjoyed the
discussion!

August 18 - Concours Italiana - Carmel

A pristine event featuring 450 of the finest Italian made cars.
Celebrations include Italian foods, vendor booths, and everything you
need to restore, shine, or re-finish your fine crafted Italian
automobile, (or Japanese, German and even American car). Located on the
driving range of one of the county's most beautiful golf courses, at
the Quail Lodge in Carmel. Head on down Carmel Valley Road and join in
the fun and admire the awesome beauty of these fine classics. For more
information and tickets call (408) 538-9516.

August 18-20 - Monterey Historic Automobile Races

Come to the sunbelt of Monterey at world famous Laguna Seca Raceway and
enjoy vintage racing machines from every era imaginable. Owners
actually race their rare and expensive automobiles against each other
in a much loved competition that attracts enthusiasts from around the

Subject: Re:  Do fog lights really work??

I have found that the fog lights, properly adjusted, with properly
adjusted low beams do help.  Note:  as stated by others, these are
for bad weather - fog, and rain also. 

So, when the fog is bad, it's raining, or I'm driving through the low
clouds, I use the fogs, with my H4s on low.

When it's a clear night, and I'm _miles_ from other drivers, I use
the H4s on high, and if they are mounted, my rally lights ( a pair
of 9 inch, 130 watt, off-road-racing lights with as 5 mile reflective
range.)  8-)  
With these, I see the deer better too. 8-)

Subject: 79 911SC CD Ignition BOX

Hi

Does anyone know a way for a backyard mechanic to determine if the CD ignition 
box is working OK.  I am experiencing a miss around 4000 RPM and sometimes 
higher RPMs, but it isn't consistant.  I don't think its the FI system or plugs.  
I guess the coil could be going as another point of failure.  The car only has 
41K miles.

Also what is the best replacement if the CD unit is dead.  Any experince with 
MSD, Jacobs, Permatune (with or without integrated coil), or anything else 
anyone can recommend.  Solid state electronics should have improved since 1979 
so I am open to the groups experience here.

Hi Jeff,

Good article, on a great fun race. 

Jerry and I would have loved to have been at Sears Point for more of the
weekend's racing activities but we had one of our 911 engine Overhaul and
Tune-up classes going on Friday and Saturday and couldn't make it. When I
scheduled our classe at the beginning of the year I guess I just wasn't
careful enough. Besides back then we didn't know Jerry was going be building
an engine for Kevin's GTS2 car. Incidentally the 350 hp you mentioned as the
output of Jerry's engine is not accurate it is much, much more, but then that
is between the motor builder and his custome (two consenting adults). It may
not be the 400 plus horsepower that some of Kevin's competitors are claiming,
but it is obviously adequate. If you need to know the actual output you can
have Jerry build one for you. Jerry is building my 3.8 engine for my Project
911 in our 911 Engine overhaul class and I will tell all what the output of
that engine is when the car is done. 

Thanks again for the fun article.

At a swap meet last weekend I saw an '86 944 Turbo for sale. It was gold
with chocolate leather, and looked okay, with evidence of minor body
repairs front & rear. But the really interesting part was that it had
172,000 miles on it. The seller (second owner) claimed it had had no
mechanical work other than maintenance(!) I posted this here because as a
recent 944 Turbo owner, I was expecting a much shorter life for major

Fog lights work great.  In fog.  I grew up in East TN - it is *foggy* there
probably 180 mornings/year.  Fog lights (especially the amber ones) don't
reflect off of the fog near as much as headlights and if they are mounted
low enough, will kinda shine "under" the fog.  

Now, driving lights are another issue.  They may actually improve night
visibility (I wouldn't know - my H4 high beams make it look like high
noon)...

If you want to maintain a side wall height of 215 x 0.60 = 129 mm (i.e. to
keep speedo
reading correct), 235/55-15 (235 x 0.55 = 129.25 mm) should be used. Using
225/50
will cause a significant height difference if you are retaining 215/60 fronts.

I've got 215/60-15 on the front and 235/55-15 on the rear on standard
phone-dial mags
for my '86 944. Not sure what difference it makes with the standard width
tires since I
bought the car this way.

Hmmm... By your logic here, if the guy behind *YOU* had also hit the tire,
YOU'D be considered at fault for that...

Fact - Mr. Lincoln driver screwed up because he hit the tire. Too bad.
       His fault for that.

Fact - You also screwed up because you hit the tire. Too bad. *Your* fault
       for that. The situation is NO different.

It's a shame that your car was dented (and I *am* sorry about that!), but
if you check your local laws, there will be something to the effect that
driving without the ability to stop before (OR avoid) things like this
is akin to driving without due care and attention.

Subject: The saga continues...


glory and glee fades into funk and frustration as my newly born baby
refused to idle today.  After starting, she'd come up to about 2,000RPM
and then stall - toying with the throttle helped but one shouldn't have
to that with a fuel injected engine. [ BABY = '76 914 ]

So, I checked wiring - verified static timing.  My fuel pressure gauge should
be arriving tomorrow so I can check the pressure.  I also think it may
be the cold start valve not getting a signal or bad ground(the valve is new).

Pulling one of the plugs revealed alot of loose carbon - so when the engine
was running it was running a bit too rich, right?  Well, due dilligence
and some elbow grease should get her fired up again.

Question - can the small screw at the end of the manifold pressure sensor
used to calibrate it?  My engine is of non-stock displacement and I will
need to set the fuel/air ratio after she will idle long enough for me
to set the timing/dwell.

Any ideas/help would be appreciated, TIA,

Well, I've got a story that, while similar, is not exactly the same. One 
Sunday we were cruising at 50 mph, not musch traffic and I was in the 
second lane from the right. A truck entered the freeway in front of me 
and proceeded to occupy my lane, 5-6 car lengths ahead.  As we went on 
down the road, suddenly a 4X8 sheet of wood either fell off of the truck 
or was driven over and lifted by vacuum into the air.....just at 
windshield level to our 911SC!  I immediately braked, then hammered the 
throttle as I projected the 'angle of incidence' for what now had become 
an inevitable impact. Apparently, the air pressure over the hood caused a 
'bubble' that lofted the panel up and to the right. I hit the wood with 
the right headlight bezel, shattering the wood and destroying the radio 
mast (small price compared to edge-on int the windshield. We exitted and 
told a CHP officer about the incident. He at least feigned interest and 
left to check it out.  On Tue, 18 Jul 1995, Andrew Warren wrote:

Perhaps the example was trivial, but the point is exactly that: to

Subject: Re: Do fog lights really work??


Yes, I do notice improvemnt IF the main beams are on dim AND the fog 
lamps are adjusted to illuminate the right edge of the road. Using high 
beams in fog causes the light to reflect back at you, further impairing 
your vision. As for testing, find a relatively flat place to stop and see 
if the fog lamps are aimed (probably best done in your garage at night). 
With only the fogs on, you should see two thin flat beams pointing to the 
right side. Adjust as necessary until the spot is 25-30 feet out. There 
are more precise ways done with computers, etc., but this is worth the 
shot and 25 minutes or so.

Scott,

Bleeding the calipers on a 964 is not alltogether different than
any other type of disk brake system.  The only thing you need to
be aware of is that there are *2* bleeder valves.  From what I've
read, Porsche began using what is essentially ATE Super Blue (without
the blue dye in it) in '92.  How do I know this?  Well, prior to
going to my first track event I decided to do the same as you.  I
went to the P-car dealership and paid $25 for a can of factory fluid.
When I went to the track, an acquaintence had a can of ATE Super Blue
which I then compaired to my can.  Sure enough, it's the exact same
stuff.  You should be able to get the ATE Super Blue for $10-$12/can.
The blue fluid also helps to identify when you've bled out the system.

Contratulations on the win.  There was some great racing in the GTS2 class
(way better that the WSC/GTS1 race IHMO).  I was sitting in the grandstands
along the "S's" and we could see the cars come down the front straight into
turn 1 up the hill, through the carousel, and down through the S's in 7, 8, and 9.
Great racing between the Mazda and your beautiful 911 until the Mazda let go.
The smoke from the 911 seemed to get worse with each lap, leaving us all wondering
whether the car was going to make it to the finish or not.

There was also a great battle between a red 911 and yellow 944 for 4th/5th.
It seemed like every other lap they would swap positions.  This was my first
IMSA race and I was really surprised how many 911's were entered, almost the
entire GTS2 field.  The sounds and smells alone were worth the price of 
admission.  There's nothing like the smell of racing gas and burning brakes
in the morning.

Thanks for the great story.

How does your car know to behave when you threaten it with a
new part?  Well, its kinda like when you were a kid sitting in
the doctor's office.  When that sucker came at me waving a
three foot long (as I remember it) needle, I suddenly became
aware that I didn't feel sick *at all* anymore.

This is how a Porsche feels when it eyeballs an irate owner
coming at it with a box from Stoddards in one hand and a pair
of rusty waterpump pliers in the other ;-)

>>> <AnalogMike@aol.com> 06/27/95 03:40pm >>>
I have had this special "Porsche only" limited use insurance for a few
years because it is very inexpensive and I don't drive my car on the
street often.

But this year they have changed the "carrier" from The Great  American
Insurance Group to American Modern
Home Insurance Group in Ohio. I am on the extremely limited CLASSIC
plan (<2500 miles per year, must be garaged,  can't be left parked in
public parking for shopping trips, can't be driven to work, etc etc).

The cost was $177 per year for an agreed value of $17,500.
Now it will be $291 per year, with the only benefit an increase in mileage
to 3,000 miles (big deal - I put about 250 miles on  my car in each of the
last 3 years).

Did anyone else see this huge increase? I am thinking of adding the 911
to my normal GEICO policy, but don't want them to get worried about me
driving a "performance car" so I'll probably just pay the extra and keep
this insurance.

Anyone else find a good classic insurance that will insure a '72 911S
(not yet 25 years old). I tried some that advertise in Hemmings a few
years back but none would take me.

Regards, Mike Piera  '72S and '73E targas, '73 914/2.0
- ---------------------
Mike-

Here's a couple options for you:
1) Contact Great American directly - they may offer to continue your
policy directly at the same rate.
2) There is a 1000 mile option from American Modern which will be
somewhat less expensive.
3) Check with some of the other agents selling the American Modern
policies (listed in a recent ad in AutoWeek, I believe).  They should, but
may NOT necessarily all quote the same rate.
4) Sell the car ...no, no, NO, this is not an option!
For what it's worth, I had a rather rude experience with the President of
Leland-West, but I'll let you decide whether or not you want to continue
doing business with them.

Don't worry, all is well.  The digit after the "N" in your case is
actually the 3rd digit of the model number (i.e. 951) -- you want
it to be a "1", S-car or not.  It's the NEXT digit that should be a "5",

Subject: Public Flames and the P word

Geez Bob

I ain't got much fer smarts ner book learnin but I done read your last
post a *couple* of times (It was hard but, thanks to my Evelyn Woodhead
trainin, I struggled through it) and I'll be gosh danged if I cain't find the
word "Porsche" nowhere in it.  

It tears at my soul that an erudite individual such as yourself, 
a *master* of the English language, (by your own addmission)
could fail to address the subject that binds the members of
this list in our quest for communication and understanding.

Course I could be missin sumpin here.  I slept thru most of
second grade (or was it the other one?). 

Concerning your comments about engineers and the English
language:  Some of the most outstanding engineers I've worked
with couldn't structure a sentence to save their slide rule.
Notice I qualified this statement with "some", not "all".  There
*are* exceptions.  Engineering is a tough disipline.  Engineering
courses are structured to weed out all the non-hackers that don't
pack the gear to be engineers and divert them to more meaningful
majors such as psych or English.  Have you taken a close look
at your Porsche factory manuals lately?   Mine aren't exactly
an eloquent treatise on the English language.

Dern feriners.  They aughtta learn the language if they want to 
sell us Americans thare cars.  Does has lotsa pictures, though,
just like the menu at Denny's.

Hey, Stan, can you send out a special edition of the list for me
and the rest of the slow learners?  No big words and *lotsa*
pictures?  Maybe a comic book style format?  In the meantime,
you might be able to get Bob to give it a rest.  If I wanted to
be graded constantly on my spelling and grammar I would
have signed up to alt.crotchety.ex.schoolmarms.  (Whoa boy 
ahowdy, Bob, lookee at that.  I managed to avoid a split infinitive
in that last sentence!  Luck, probably.)  Last time I checked my
screen it looked like I was on porschephiles@tta.com.

Am I coming across lumpy chicken?  If you fellers ain't readin
me "in the slot, five by five"  or I fail to "communicate accurately,
without ambiguity"  (Poetic license to add the comma, Bob.  I think it
reads better that way.) just drop me a post.  I'll try to type slower.

Perhaps the example was trivial, but the point is exactly that: to
communicate, and to communicate accurately without ambiguity.  Would you fly
on an airplane that was built to specifications written by engineers who
communicate in such a fashion?  I wouldn't, and I AM an engineer.  The
English language (as are most languages) is a powerful tool...it's a shame to
see so many people ding its edges with carelessness.

The answer from 'How to Tune & Modify Bosch Fuel Injection' by Ben Watson
is, of course, 'yes'.  The problem is, if you lean the mixture at idle, it
may be too lean at full throttle.

For a 'starts cold and stalls' symptom, the book also advises checking the
trigger points {car starts using fuel from the cold-start valve, then dies
when none of the others kick in}, the aux. air valve, and the cylinder head
temp sensor.

Hope it helps,

Thanks for the porsche-pages, I was very delighted to find them.
There is one thing bothering me concerning the Tech-Tips.
Where is 928 ?
I think you should pay attention to the most interesting sport car in a
whole world.
 I have rebuild two of them, first was 928 -78 yearmodel, another was 928
Koenig -88, the one and only here in Finland.
There was many problems with them, most of them was technical things
as engine, air conditioning(cooler), electrical things, automatic
gearbox(adjusting it!!!) and getting decent information about them .
And the prices, they were sky high !!!
Anyway, I would feel much better, if You could add 928 to one of TechTip's
departments.

Once again, thanks for the pages, they are really useful...

The point I was trying to make is that communication standards change as a
function of the medium.  

I would probably not want to fly an a/c that was built based on e-mail
messages on the I-net.  But then I would not spend hours composing my
dinner conversion with my family to make sure that every word was just
right.  I do, however, spend weeks working on technical communications were
accuracy is critical.  

My wife says I always want to express everything exactly right (too much
time in science, engineering, & research), that I need to lighten-up and
let myself make a few mistakes in casual conversation.  And as much as I
hate to admit it, she is right.

Subject: Things going "bump" in the night

'philers,

All this chatter about hitting road debris reminded me about the time a
poor little fox went head-to-head with the front air dam ("spoiler" -
whatever), and my left tyre. (Curbside for those in Oz).

Driving through the countryside, I saw his little red eyes a way in the
distance, and slowed up, as it could have just as easily been a roo. He
looked my driving lights straight on, and trotted off the road, sat on the
verge, and waited. When I was about 20 metres away charged back onto the
road. I had veered into the middle of the road by then, (no oncoming
lights), and he just managed to wallop my spoiler, bending it all the way
up. Ouch. (Who do I sue?)

I stopped, and looked for the (now, messy) little critter to check if he
was suffering, but he was nowhere to be seen. I guessed he had been
deflected back into the scrub with a 90kph hangover. All I could see was a
little red fluff on the re-arranged spoiler.

I was fortunate, it could have been a 'roo. They usually win fights with
car bonnets. (And Aussie wildlife purists will tell you that foxes are
feral anyway)

Oh and on driving lights / fog lights. Once, in pea - soup fog (hoping not
to have to drive by Braille), I turned on the high beams and nearly blinded
myself. (My own little Spielberg - effect, minus the wind!). They are
aligned correctly, but the driving lights project out and down the road. -
I drove rather sedately back down the hill, following the cat's eyes and
side posts with low beam.

I apologise for my indulgence, hope you excuse the bandwidth.

Subject: Do Fog Lights Really Work


There are only a few things that really tick me off.  People who camp out in 
the left lane like it's their birth right.  People who haven't figured out 
how to use turn signals.  And idiots who drive around at night with their 
fog lights on when it ain't foggy!    They're called FOG lights for a 
reason.  Like FOG horns you use them in the FOG.  Innocent people driving 
toward you are blinded by their eight jillion candle power and if adjusted 
properly (i.e., aimed at the ground in front of your bumper) they don't 
improve the driver's view of the road at all.

If you want lights that work while you're driving around, go buy DRIVING 
lights.  They work great.  Rally drivers and people who run 24 hour races 
have units that can blister paint at 200 yards.  I had a pair on my rally VW 
for a while and when I crossed the George Washington Bridge heading west 
with these babies on, people in Chicago started pulling down their window 
shades.  Honest.

I just had the common sense and courtesy to turn them off before blinding 
people. Unless they were in the left lane going too slow.

A quick summary of what I have to do follows:
 -trace the development of brakes and braking systems from their earliest
beginnings to the present day brakes used in cars. Photos and/or sketches
can be used to illustrate an answer.

 - Explain the operation of a modern braking system and carry out a detailed
analysis of the component parts explaining the materials used in their
construction, the properties of these materials which determined their
selection, the manufacturing methods used and an explanation of the
microstructure of these materials. Again photos and/or sketches can be  used

Subject: Loctite 271? fuel system threadlocker


I'm going to be disassembling my fuel system on my '84
928S (L-Jetronic).  Just about every threaded connection
has red threadlocker on it.  When I put it back together
I want to use the same stuff, so, what is it?  Is this 
Loctite 271 (high strength)?

At the auto parts store the red Loctite is "high strength"
and says it requires special tools or heat to break.
Well, I don't have special tools, and I don't want to use
heat to loosen connections on my fuel system.  But, the
medium strength is blue, and there is certainly red all
over the connection in my fuel system..

Incidently, my fuel filter connections were the same way,
but when I asked Stoddard about it, the mechanic there
said to *not* use threadlocker, but to tighten it to the
point where it wouldn't leak.  Was he wrong?

So, what's on my fuel system now?  What should I use?
Where can I get it?  Should I go back and use threadlocker
on the fuel filter connections?

Stay tuned for more questions!  :)

Subject: Gold Chain Affiliation or True Love?

In hopes of perhaps diverting some of the dialogue on "following to closely"
and since Bart has not chosen to update us recently with a new "Snake or
Corvette" story, I offer the following:

Many years ago, my wife and I were on a PCA Treffen to Stuttgart.  As we
cruised enroute high over the Atlantic with friends and new acquaintances,
the air was full of "Porsche talk" enhanced with plenty of beer and wine.
 The free-flowing spirits and the comradery of Porsche ownership apparently
affected a "non-Porsche owning" young couple (late 20s or early 30s)
traveling with friends from Houston.  This fellow promptly decided "they had
to have one" and a message was forwarded from the plane back to the bank and
local dealer to arrange a bank draft and pickup during our visit to Porsche
AG in Zuffenhausen.  (don't remember if it was a 911 or a 928).  Many
(including myself) were envious at the ability to "casually" buy a new
Porsche on a whim. 

After 10 days or so, we (as most) had struggled getting our dirty laundry
stuffed into our bags with all the inevitable additional souvenirs of such a
trip.  By then, my enviousness of the buying capability had about evaporated
(probably the excessive transfer of latent heat from mouth to liter mugs at
the Cannstatter Volksfest).

This couple (nice folks incidentally) appeared at the bus for the return trip
from the Graf Zeppelin hotel to the airport looking fresh, crisp, and
carrying only a small hand bag.  When someone asked "where's the rest of your
luggage", they matter-of- factly replied: "Oh, we don't carry old clothes
back, we leave them for the maid and porter.  You can always get new clothes
back home or wherever you're going." ...!!!!

1.  Is there still money ($$$) and intelligent life in Houston?

2.  Did the experience for these folks create a lifelong love of Porsches or

After having an alignment done on the racecar I need to convert the results

Can anyone help me out?  If it is something obvious I am just TOTALLY

ps - obligatory porsche input - I am using a Porsche shop and their

Around here it's your title/proof of ownership.
If you rebuild the vehicle the DMV inspects it and
if it passes they issue a title stating that it's a rebuilt car.

There is also a theft recovery title. Same deal. You have to have the
car inspected. You can end up with either a clean title or a rebuilt
title. It depends on what you had to do to put the car back in shape.

This is based on phone calls to DMV. I'll be trying it soon :-)

Well I think I got it.  Someone passed on the key phrase 'the degree
measurement is in relation to the car's centerline.'  Once I got that

Posted this 2 days ago and it never made it (I think).

What are the options for replacing my headlights with brighter ones ('73 914)?  
Currently when I'm on a road with no streetlights I don't have enough light to 
see very well.  So I end up being one of those people I hate who run their 
fog/driving lights when it's a clear night.  (and yes, fog/driving light

on a curvy road through a wooded area with no streetlights)

Am I just too used to my SAAB's huge beacons?  Gimme a light, . . .no, Porsche

Sure, I am currently driving a 1986 Audi 5000 Wagon that has 
a salvage title here in NY State.

The car was declared a total loss before I bought it and the parts
to fix it from a salvage yard.

After I put it together, I had my work inspected by the NY State DMV
(to make sure that I could account for all of the replacement parts)
who authorized the salvage title so that I could register it in NY State.

The process took me about 6 weeks.

Of course, in Delaware, the procedures may be different.

Check with your state's DMV or DOT.
Good Luck!

From: Stefan Czereyski <czereysk@saifr00.ateng.az.honeywell.com>
Subject: Fog lights

Fog lights were never intended to improve night vision. Many people
misuse them. They have to activate every evailable knob or button on
their dash. 

The idea is to keep reflected light back to you at a minimum as this
reduces contrast hence your ability to dsicern objects (i.e. visibilty
is reduced). In reality you don't reduce the reflected light at all
with low mounted fogs any more than highs. The key difference is where
it goes. On high the beams are close to your line of sight & come back
at you. The lower they are, i.e. at ground level, the reflected light
can take a different path, and your contrast is undiminished - presto
increased visibility. It's the same principle as sitting on the left
side of the room watching TV. Turn on a lamp on the right side & you
can see it in the screen and contrast is reduced. Move yourself or the
lamp and it appears to vanish and you get your contrast back. The amount
of light however does not change - only the percentage reflected into your
eyes.

If there's no fog (or snowflakes) you really won't see much difference since
the illumination is close & fat by design (those engineers again) not long
& narrow. And don't forget they pull 10 - 20 amps. So if you've got everything
else on you could exceed your alternator capacity (typically 60-80 amps).
When this happens all they extra needed juice comes from your battery
running it down. If your car is not equiped with an ammeter you'll never
know. Also at low rpms as in stop & go driving the alternator output is
only about 20-30 amps. That's why you frequently get a "dead" battery every
couple of weeks in winter driving - you probably d3epleted 10%-20% every
day till it wouldn't start.

So turn off those fogs unless you really need em - or buy long range driving
lamps if you drive fast down dark country roads.

I have Cibie Z-beams on my 914, using stock halogen bulbs. They throw
_plenty_ of light. Automod in Atlanta is where I usually get them (they're
kind of hard to find).  Or, you could use Hella 7" units.  The Hellas are
"flat", the Cibies are convex and match the plastic fairing that surrounds
the headlights.  I also have an original pair of European Bosch headlights,
and they're flat, so perhaps the flat 7" headlights are more "original".

When I bought the car, it had some generic US-made headlamps, and they were
terrible.

  In my experience the Bosch CD box would not cause this type of problem
  (miss around 4000 RPM), but more likely would fail completely (i.e., the
  car would not run).  For us backyard mechanic types, the only test I know
  of is the "sound" test.  With the ignition on & the motor not running,
  the CD box should emit a high pitched hum, but not very loud.  In your
  case I would go back & check the distributor cap very carefully & ohm out
  the plug wires.

  As for replacement, Bosch units are usually very expensive.  The
  Permatune units are a very good deal & work really well, this is my
  recomendation for a stock replacement.  The MSD, Jacobs etc. are used
  mainly by racers or for modified engines.  In a stock engined, street 911
  you will gain very little, if anything, over a properly working stock
  ignition.  Besides, they are expensive & usually require seperate add-on
  modules for connecting your tach & may require that you replace your
  stock coil.  Good Luck

have a nice fat scrape between the two rubber bumper pads on my 944S.  It

real well I should be able to lay down a couple coats of paint and some clear
coat and be good as new.  Or should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and take
it to a good paint shop?  I'd like to avoid calling the insurance company on
this, since I have $500 deductable and I think this can be fixed for less.  Or

Matt,

I don't *think* it's original, and I don't think you need it.  I don't
like to use any kind of sealant on fuel connections because of the
chance that a little goober of the stuff will get into the fuel and
do a nice job of sealing up an injector or fuel distributor.

You should put everything back together very, very clean and with
new seal rings.

You don't need "special tools" or heat to break red Loctite.  Just
grunt.

If you're seeing this "red Loctite" on the *outside* of your fittings,
that ain't what it is.  It's paint marking the fitting as tightened
and checked.

Porsche with me is impractical. Storing it for 4 or 5 years is also
impractical, so I have decided to sell it. Several people are interested
in it--my brother, the guy who owns the dry-cleaning establishment I
frequent, a neighbor, and a friend in Albuquerque. Trouble is, I have no
idea what a fair price would be--I am concerned that it be a fair price
for anyone, but especially if the buyer is my brother or my friend. Can
anyone offer advice? The stats:
 '89 944
 Guards Red Leather interior
 47,200 miles
 Blaupunct CD player
 Diligently maintained; oil change every 3,000 miles; timing belt changed 
at 30,000; perfect mechanical bill of health at 45,000 mile service. 
Exterior in excellent condition, but for a handful of small stone nicks;  
hood repainted courtesy of the local dealer whose mechanic closed it on 
one of his tools.
I am the second owner; bought it 18 months ago when it had 28,000 miles.  
Previous owner also maintained it meticulously, and kept full maintenance 
records. 
Thanks in advance for any pricing advice.

Sounds like what my car was doing, except it would shut down until I 
let off the gas.  Putting in a Permatune fixed it, but of course that 
doesn't mean you have the same problem.

Last year I went to the Indy car race at Laguna Seca and I was very
glad that I decided to leave the P-car at home.  I got there at what
I thought would be early enough (8:30), and I still had to park in the middle
of nowhere in some dusty, bumpy cow pasture.  I actually thought about
putting the explorer in 4WD.  I went in the entrance off RT. 68.  There
is another entrance and there may be paved lots on that side.  I did
see lots of 911's in the pasture, but I'm pretty sure I would have
dinged the chin spoiler more than once, not to mention the dust.

Not so.  My CD unit exhibited this behavior once it got warm, and once my 
mechanic replaced it, all the while stating "they usually fail 
completely", the problem went away.  Oh, just thought of a good test for 
this type of problem, which is how I diagnosed it.  If it's due to

Keith, I prefer the Yoko's on mine.  My '74 has Yoko's while my '75 has 
Michelin's and the Yoko's win hands down.  I realize that the '75 is 
about 400 lbs heavier, but that doesn't explain the drift I get in the

Ho, yes: 900.182.001.01 or N.020.112.1.  One number may be a supersession of

I am not a club racer (yet) but I have an opinion:

I even use steel lug nuts with my Fuchs for autocrossing. I have not seen, but
have heard enough stories for RELIABLE people about alloy lug nuts failing.

I torque my alloy lug nuts to 94 lb-ft and my steel lug nuts to 100 lb-ft.
I re-torque them after they have been run to make sure they are still correct.

If you want to see 928 tech tips, why not write some?  It sounds like you have

Two years ago at the OSH KOSH pilot convention they had 22 P-51's fly in.
T3 participated in formation flybys. They've also had 3 B-17s, B-24, 5 P-47
3 Corairs, 200 T-6's, Catalina, Spitfires, P-40', the Concorde, 2 Lockheed
Constellations and the SR-71 Blackbird. 

Now there's some serious machinery. The P-51 has a 12 cyl Rolls Royce engine,
2000 HP I believe. The OSH KOSH pilot convention is on at OSH KOSH, Wisconsin
next week July 27 thru Aug. 2nd. Anyone can go but only pilots, aircraft
mecahnics and EAA members can get pit passes to walk right up to the aircraft.

Today during lunch, I passed Jim Ellis Porsche in Atlanta...

As I was driving by, I spotted a shocking yellow 911 so, what else, I made a
quick U'y and headed back to the dealer.  I knew it had to be a Turbo.  The car
was beautiful.  Everything on this car was huge: wheels barely fit in the wheel
wells, tires (rears were 285/30) had the wildest tread design I have ever seen,
enormous brakes (front rotors were probably 1 1/2" thick with those huge red
calipers).  The new owner <VVVBG> had just come back from his first test drive
of his new car.  62 miles on the odometer.  Subtle blue leather interior with a
6sp wood shift handle, comfortable looking sport seats and a 200mph speedo.  I
bet the dealer had a fun time "prepping" his car for him.  Commenting on the car,
, the new owner said "this car is quick, almost scary...I was afraid to get on
it hard..."  He went on to say he had waited about a year to take delivery.  The
salesman asked me if I wanted one...I deadpanned him and said "I'll take two." 
He came right back at me and said "Yeah, for about $120K a piece & did I mention
the 2 yr wait?"  As I left the dealer, I had to slap myself to get the big grin
off my face...and all I did was look!  BTW, the new owner looked to be in his
mid 30s!!!  Lucky b_stard!!!

Mike,

My '87 Jetta GLI has had this exact same problem twice now.  The
four speed fan would only work in the high position.  After some
removal of dash trim and consulting with my Bentley manual I
managed to locate the "box" consisting of the multiple tapped
resistor and a thermal cutout.  This box was located near the fan
motor and was easily removed from the adjacent ductwork.
The "box" is not really enclosed, but rather an approx. 2" X 3"
metal plate sunken into the ductwork near the fan.  The proximity
of the thermal cutout to the tapped resistor and to the motor and
ductwork indicate that the thermal cutout is intended to protect
the vehicle and occupants from overloads, fan motor stalls, etc.
The "box" is of Bosch manufacture and there is a good chance that
your 944 has something similiar.  The thermal cutout was at fault
on my car both times.  In case you are not familiar with thermal
cutouts they are like a fuse (shaped like a bullet shaped diode)
but activated (blown) by temperature rather than current.  The
temperature rating is usually marked on the side of it.  an ohm
meter can confirm whether it or the tapped resistor is at fault.
I would be seriously surprised if it was the resistor since it is
a rather robust wirewound ceramic part.  When the fan is switched
to high, the resistor and cutout is bypassed.

I clipped out the old cutout with diagonal cutters.  I could not
unsolder it since it was originally welded in rather than
soldered.  Radio Shack, believe it or not, had the exact same
part in stock (less than two dollars).  I installed the new one
by soldering it.  I had to flux the area kind of heavily in order
to  solder to what was once welded but it worked fine.  I am sure
an automotive electrician could handle this if you are not
comfortable with doing it yourself.

The second time it failed (about a year later) I replaced it
again, this time with the next higher temperature rated cutout.
That was two years ago and it hasn't failed since.

good luck,

Kurt Weber

Matt, I just had to pull a fuel line out in order to change the
thermostat housing on my 928S (don't ask why!!) and found
that there was no Loctite or anything else on the couplings. 
I also removed the fuel cooler when I changed an a/c pipe and
there was no Loctite on the fuel line connections there either.  Finally,
I replaced the fuel filter last year and none of the connections
back there had anything on them.

All I did was tighten everything up to where it doesn't leak.

Note that the fuel line fittings are all compression fittings and
seal very well when you tighten the fittings.  Just use common 
sense and don't overtighten!

The Stoddard mechanic is right.

Subject: Following too close & fog lights

Especialy when driving a beloved Porsche, you are ultimately responsible 
to make sure you don't screw up, or get screwed because of someone else.  
It is not about following too closely - it's about you thinking of things 
that can go wrong and try to avoid them.  This includes, but is not 
liiimted to, others flippng tires at you, stones flying at you, animals 
crossng the road, and such things.  

It is best to assume somebody, includng yourself, will screw up and there 
wll be major consequences.  With ths in mind, you will be more conscious 
of everythng around you and you will be better prepared when something 
bad happens.

For P-philes questioning the effectiveness of fog lamps, they do work 
when set up properly.  They should be aimed lower than the low beams and 
about the same left/right alignment.  With my less than perfect night 
vision, I find fog lights work very well.  Driiving lights (they augment the 
high beams) are very good too.  They are aimed a little higher than the 
high beams and, therefore, send light further ahead of you.

All this talk about fog lamps has me wondering:

Has anyone used those combination fog/driving lamps from PIAA?  They look
pretty slick, so of course I'm suspicious of how well they work (the US$260

Subject: Oil Leak revisited / Smoke / Help


Hi, Help again...

I am sorry to have to ask this, but could the nice
people that responded to my question about my oil leak
behind my engine, near the real oil cooler, please re-send
their responses to me at chapin@draper.com.  I crashed my
disk on my workstation and had to re-install the operating
system for the past 3 days, and lost my mail for that time.
I never even got to read the repsponses.  If they were sent
also to the list, maybe someone could just send me the digests
from the past 3 days.  

Again, I am sorry for any bounced mail that people may have
received, and I really am very interested in these responses.

I did recieve 2 responses, one informative one from 
A D Castberg <castberg@hawaii.edu>, and another from someone
here in the northeast region.  Both suggested the O-ring gasket
for the oil cooler, or the thermostat switch.  But anyways,
if there were other reponses, I would really like to see
them.  

BTW: I drove the car today (Thurs) to work, to see if the 
leak was still existant, and it did not leak, not did the OEL
light come on.  This leads me to believe that it only leaks
when the oil is run through the oil cooler, which I think is
only when the engine is hot, and a switch diverts oil through
this cooler.  Is this how the oil cooler operates, or does
oil always circulate through it?

I am planning on fixing this myself, which will probably mean
pulling out the engine, and replacing the seals, and rings,
and whatever else looks like it needs fixing.  I have never
done this, but am eager to try, as I have fixed just about
every thing else on the car.  I had the engine half way out
2 weeks ago when I replaced the motor mounts.  Any pointers
to full removal of the thing?  Thanks again.

L = R sin Theta

The sine of the angle Theta in degrees from "parallel to centerline", times
the radius of the tire, equals the length you wanted. Measure R in inches,
and you will get L in inches.

Subject: "928..BOOM" Project Update

Those who have been here a while probably remember a thread
about a high reving, high HP 928 that was destined for a
home-made fuel computer and a supercharger.  One P-phile
suggested that reving to 8500 RPM at full power would
result in my 928 going "boom."  Well, its got 6500 very
agressive miles on it, and things are going very well.

There was, however, one recent mishap that's worth
mentioning.  During one of my usual freeway passing
maneuvers--at 50MPH, manually downshift to first (it's a
3 speed auto), and stomp it--the impulse actually sheared
the mounting bolt on the air conditioning compressor.
Apparently, the vacuum switch did not disengage the AC
clutch in time, and the low to high RPM instantaneous
change jerked the compressor belt hard enough to snap the
bolt.  The compressor stayed put (it was attached by the
tensioning bracket), but the belt was thrown into all
the other V-belts, and derailed them all.  After noticing
that I had no power steering, no air conditioning, and
low voltage, I exited the freeway and discovered the
missing belts.  From then on, I have been shutting off
the AC prior to these high power/high rev downshifts.

I realize this message is almost certainly flame-bait,
so go ahead and let me have it.

BTW:  The new fuel computer design and program is complete,
the parts came in, and assembly has begun.  I made a
mock-up of the supercharger (a "Gearcharger" from Vortec),
and found that it is too deep for my mounting location.
I could do away with the AC compressor, and mount it
there, but right now, I'm looking at moving the radiator
and fan forward 1.5 inches (that should make enough room).
Since I know interest is high for a 928 supercharger kit,
I will be sure to let everyone know how things develop.

Many enjoyable miles to all.

Tracey, you said you got rear-ended. Does that mean that you hit someone
from behind, or does it mean that someone else ran into the back of your
car? Normally, it means the latter, and normally, they are the ones that
have to pay the deductible, not you. And if your insurance company tries
to charge you for the deductible, just send the bill along to the guy that
hit you, it's his responsibility to make good on the damage he caused.

Living and driving in the Boston area (outer limits, but it counts), as I do,
I have long since come to the conclusion that any assumption that any other
driver will take any action other than the most bone-headed, idiotic, and
most likely to cause an accident or at least major damage must be invalid.
OK, sometimes they don't, but if you want your P-car (or any other car)
to last around here, you have to assume that they will be trying to hit you.

A fine example of this phenomenon occurred while I was still driving my
first car ever, a 1971 Porsche 914 (red, OK rust red) in 1981. At 2:30 am,
on Soldiers Field Road, I made the horrible mistake of stopping for the
red light by the radio station. The fellow in the 1974 Mustang II hadn't been
planning to stop, but when his headlights reached my engine he kind of had to.
This was the start of my education regarding the correct attitude wrt the
other drivers around here. If you are at the stop line, leave it in gear
and keep an eye on the rear-view - be ready to peel out when the next clown
comes blazing through. And any time, any where, any situation, be ready with
at least one contingency plan to deal with each possible bone-headed move that
any other driver on the road might be able to pull. In the fullness of time,
they WILL pull exactly those moves.

Matt, I am a Sr. Design Engineer for an OEM of fuel injection and engine
 management systems.  My specific background is in fuel injector, and 
fuel rail design.  The Stoddard mechanic was absolutely, positively, 
110% correct.  DO NOT put any type of threadlocker on any of the 
fittings, as this will almost certainly wick into the innards of your 
system.

This can create havoc with the extremely tight clearances in a fuel 
injector or can ruin a pressure regulator.  The fittings in your system 
(Bosch) are designed to seal properly without Loctite.  Be sure to clean
 off all of this before you reassemble the connectors. You might try 
acetone for removing the loctite.  If you would like some specific 
recommendations on improving this injection system please e-mail a 
request to me.

Hello All,

	Someone posted a request for basket case 356's not too long ago.  
I've been driving by one just about everyday, and finally decided to stop 
and look.  The car is silver, black interior, non-sunroof coupe.  It 
still has the "moon" rims on it.  However there are several "rusty" spots 
around the rocker panels and bumpers.  I can get more information, 
including VIN number, price, and telephone number if anyone is interested.
BTW, the car is located at Eagle Imports in Auburn, Alabama, about two hours 
south-west of Atlanta off of I-85 (exit 51).   Drop me a note if anyone 
is interested.

Drive Scared,

Mike,

Whenever I buy new rotors I have them black zinc coated at my local metals
refinishing business.  The coating comes off the braking surface almost
immediately, but stays on all the rest forever, w/out discoloring. No rust
anywhere -- it's very appealing.  Cost for 4 rotors is usually $50.

Black zinc is different from black oxide (rusts) and cadmium (doesn't hold
up too well).

Subject: P-51s and other remnants of WWII

Several claims to fame.

1. Picked up 1960 356B cabrio at the factory in 1960. Drove it 60,000 miles 
plus in Europe over the next four years.Drove from London to Greece, 
Yugoslavia, Austria and back with wife, (and two children in rear seats 
(ages 12 and 14)). They have never forgotten the trip for obvious reasons.

2.Flight in the P51 in 1944. In those days you could just about step into 
any aircraft as long as you had Army Air Corp wings. After all most fighter 
aircraft were only worth ten times a pilots annual salary. In my case, I was 
taking a squadron buddy to Hamilton Field near San Francisco to the altitude 
chamber because he was going overseas. I spotted the 51 on the flight line 
while I was waiting for him and asked the ops officer if I could take it up. 
Why not, he said? The crew chief started it up and off I went for 40 
minutes.I lifted it off by feel and after a stall or two at altitude, I was 
ready to land it. It was a great aircraft. In some ways better than the P-38 
that I had flown in England and North Africa in combat. In other ways, not 
as good. 

There are only seven P-38s in flyable condition today.

At the end of WWII you could buy a 51 and a spare engine for a couple of 
thousand dollars, but that was big bucks then which accounts for the few 
left flying today.

3. My last flight in the Air Force was in an F 111 which reached mach two 
and cost about five hundred times my annual salary. This was not a case of 
asking the ops officer to take it up, but involved a lot of paperwork and a 
qualified test pilot to make sure it got back on the ground safely.

sorry I missed the initial post. could you please send me a copy if you

I just put my motor back in and am in the process of trying to get
all the plumbing correctly hooked up after having had it apart for a 
long time. There is one hose I'm not sure about, from the LHS tin
shroud to the LHS exhaust. It is some kind of heat riser for preheating
the MFI pump. The diam of the tube on the sheet metal shroud is smaller
than the diam of the outlet on the exhaust. What kind of hose does it
take? Also, the fitting on the exhaust is on a kind of jacket or heat
exchanger (separate from the main heat exhanger that is used for the
interior heater). The inlet for this smaller heat exchanger seems
to be plugged - it has a cap on the end. Is this right? Maybe
I have a non-standard exhaust?

Thanks,

There are two hoses of concern.

One is a special "hose within a hose" insulated jobber, used to provide
heat to the MFI pump, which tells it when the car is warm, and causes
it to then lean the mixture out.  This goes in the engine compartment 
down to the left side, to a pass-thru fitting, and up to the rear
(of the car) of the MFI pump.

The second is a large heavy doody rubber jobber that goes above the valve
cover (exhaust) and runs to a take off on the top of the heat exchanger,
towards the front of the car.

The car will run like crap without them.  I know from experience!

A red or black car will be an easier car to sell -- hard to believe, I 
know, but some Porsche drivers like being recognized for their good, 
classic judgement.  That said, unless you're going to have a glass-out, 
super-expensive paint job done on the car, I'd stick with whatever color 
is already on there.  A two-color paintjob, that is, where bits of color 
remain from a previous paintjob, are even worse than the tarnished 
original paint job.  

I personally was put off a car (a 944) because I could look down into the 
hatchback latches and see that this beautiful black car used to be a 
beautiful red car.  That indicated a shoddy paint job to me, which I took 
to be indicative of the car that the Porsche had received.  No matter how 
clean it looked, I couldn't believe that the owner hadn't cut corners 
earlier if he had cut corners on the paint job.

Speed yellow sticks out, to a cop.  It also sticks out to a potential 
buyer.  If he is looking for a car that will make him stand out (a very 
likely possibility, if he is buying the car just because it's a Porsche), 
the speed yellow will appeal.  If he's buying it as a performance car, 
the speed yellow cop magnet may not be so cool.

I vote red, if it's done correctly.  You can't go wrong with red -- 
everyone likes red sports cars.  People are less fussy when buying a used 
car, so stick with something generic -- red, black, perhaps white.  This 
will appeal to more people.

If you are interested in re-dying, leave it to the professionals.  
They'll do a bang-up job, and will be responsible for mismatches in 
color.  They're fairly reasonable, cheaper than you'd expect.  I just had 
all four seats in my 944S done front, back, and sides, for $175.  Call 
your local auto detailer, if they don't have the facility on site, they 
surely can refer you.

Your other option, for about $50, is to get a pre-dyed leather skin.  I 
have no direct experience with these, but have heard they look quite good 
- -- not as good as the original factory stitching, but close.  Any P-phile 
readers have experience with this (as my wheel is in sad shape, and needs 
a facelift to match the seats)

This is going to be my very own porsche! I used to share 79' 911 with my

drive. I wonder why :) ) Anyway, I didn't really spent much time in 911 
and I wanted to get my own. After seeing a couple 914 and 914/6's for 
sale, I decided to go for 914! My questions are;

1) how much are these mid-engined, volkswagen-manufactured porsche? How 
much am I expected to pay?

2) Is it hard to fix? harder than 911? I saw my brother spending hours 
and hours under the whale tail fixing his 911. I hope it should be easier.

3) What should I check when I go testdrive? anything worth inspecting 
before purchasing?

4) What about the clutch? Should I be able to replace it? I have seen 
people doing it, but never done it myself.

Well, besides my questions above, anything about this car would be

I had similar problems with my 77 (before I swapped engines).  I was lucky
in that my mechanic had several old units (from cars he had converted for
racing). He loaned me one, I swapped it, & the problem went away.  I was

So you might try your mechanic to see if he has a used laying around that

Brian,

Your Vin number is fine, Porsche did not reserve a special VIN number 
for the Turbo S, it just says it's a Turbo. The FAQ # range you mentioned 
is wrong or a typo. One way you can tell if it's an "S", is to look at 
the engine block on the exhaust side, towards the back is a "engine 
type" plate, reading "M 44/52" for the "S" car and "M 44/51" for the 
reg Turbo.

Check it out.

So Dave's busy killing off $150-$300 fuel pumps . . .

[the preceeding was severely edited]

Lots of *air* being forced into the fuel tank through the return line
suggests that no *fuel* is being delivered by the pump -- probably because
no fuel is being delivered *to* the pump.  Check the in-tank filter {a
'sock' or screen} and make sure the line from the tank to the pump isn't
clogged.

Fuel is the only coolant and lubricant the pump has and running the pump dry
for extended periods of time will cause it to fail 'prematurely'.  The
process may be accelerated by plugging the supply line {making the pump work
even harder}.

If, OTOH, it turns out that the pump still runs when removed from the car
and run straight from the battery, try replacing the fuel pump relay on the
board in the engine compartment.  I had a problem with one that would work
for short periods of time, overheat, and fail.

Good luck,

Subject: headliners

   Now that my  66 is 100% in the mechanical area, I have decided to work
on the cosmetic side. When I 1st purchased the car I used just about every 
chemical I know of to clean the headliner. It brightened it up marginaly. 
The other day I was a a friends place and have been watching
the resto of a VW type3 Ghia. I had mentioned to him that one of his jobbers
had given me a price of $100 to hang my headliner. I found this price to be 
too good to be true, and and was inquiring how anyone could charge so low,
and if the quality of work would come up to my expectations. Here's the
break out of the cost. Headliner is $50.00, I have to R&R all the glass and
the rubber would have cost me about $260 (assuming I didn't bend the trim
when I removed it). So I have $410 before the "gotcha's". Then my friend
Mike shows me the headliner in his type3. Looked like new! He hands me
a can of stuff called TOPPER. 
 Later that evening I decide that I'll try it on my visors and measure my
results. It looked GREAT! So, yesterday I mask off all the rubber and trim,
then clean the surface of the liner and let it dry. Before application I 
match the color of the visors with the headliner color that is under the 
where the mirror attaches. Looks prefect. So I figure I have nothing to 
loose. It took me about 3 hrs to get done. The surface texture was not 
altered. The dye/paint is flexible and checked by my appilication to the
inside trim on the qtr windows. So I'm a happy camper, for now. Time will
be the test on this "fix". Topper is latex and is cleanable with water 
before it drys. I am so pleased with the finished job that my confidance has 
been boosted enough to consider applying Surflex to the black trim.

Soliciting your long-distance diagnosis: 77 911S fouls one plug.  Compression
in that cylinder same as rest of engine.  Have swapped everything (plug,
plug wire, dist cap, injector, which fuel dist port feeds that cylinder)
and same plug is still fouled.  If engine isn't run for two or more days,
cloud of smoke on starting.  After a minute, or if engine is run daily,
no smoke.

Valve guides?  Rings?  

I hesitate to just call the engine a core and start rebuilding, because 
the bottom end is showing no signs of trouble, runs cool and makes great
oil pressure.  And yet if I pull that cylinder head, the "while I'm at
it"'s start.  Is it possible/responsible to timesert a case without
opening it up?

If I take this problem as a sign from above that I need a 3.0liter engine,
do I need a complete engine or can I use 2.7 CIS induction system and
Triad stainless heat exchangers on a 3.0 long block?

Hi,

I have been told that I can get to my oil leak on the 
top front of my engine by removing the black plastic CIS
boot form the top of the car.  Then, using a small mirror
for a better view, I can warm up the engine and see exactly
what part of the oil system (oil pressure sender, O-ring
of oil cooler, thermostat, breather hose) is leaking.  
Removal of the CIS boot (entire system??) will allow access
over the top of the engine, instead of engine lowering/removal.

How do I go about removing this CIS boot?  I looked there
last night and saw various ways this may be possible.

Subject: The 914 FUEL PUMP CONTROL SYSTEM

OK - Dave... :>0

I checked after work, there's more to 914 Fuel Pump Problems than meets the
eye! 

Here goes (for all 914s):

Resources Needed:

 - Factory or non-factory wiring diagrams w/relay board schematic
 - for 1.7s and 2.0s:  Kjell Nelin's "D-Jetronic Fuel Injection for the
Porsche 914", avail. electronically 
      (my inspiration!)
 - OHM meter

The 914 FUEL PUMP CONTROL SYSTEM 
          (All 1.7 & 2.0, some things may also apply to the 1.8's different
fuel controlsystem):  

Note:  

Carefully check the ends of 2 wires that connect to the pump (blk/red &
brn).  If any of the wire is not flexible, cut back to a flexible section,
add wire if necessary (& solder), and install a new connector.  


 - (NEG) on the pump is the BROWN wire.  (BROWN is ALWAYS NEG )
        It runs inside the wiring harness to the nearest ground connection.  
         (75-76s have a ground connection in the front, under the fuel tank).

To CHECK BROWN (GROUND) (NEG - ):
 -  DOWN 'N DIRTY:  Connect (fasten securely) a new length of wire from the
Pump - (NEG) directly (fasten securely) to a known good GROUND point.  If
the pump now works, you have a found a ground problem.  ---

If so, --you could leave the new wire, but instead, please try to fix it
properly:

 -  Trace BROWN wire back through harness. Find GROUND point. Since it's near
the Battery (pre-75s), clean the wire ends and connector, and especially the
body mointing point, w/Baking soda & water.  Brighten exposed metal w/fine
sandpaper.  Install and tighten,.  Try the fuel pump now with your repair.
If this worked, spread a little WHITE grease (less/no staining)over the
fresh connection to help prevent corrosion.  

NOTE:  If the GROUND is in the middle of a major rust spot, Move the ground
point.

If the pump didn't begin to operate, the ground wire is broken somewhere,
likely at a point where other wires come out of the protective shirk-wrap.
Inspect and fix with the help of an OHM meter (Continuity check).  

If you decide to replace the entire ground wire, please use BROWN wire in
the same or (my pref.) HEAVIER gauge.  With luck, you might be able to pull
the new wire through the harness by tightly taping it close to the old wire. 



+ (POS) on the pump goes to the wire:  BLACK w/RED STRIPE which runs inside
the harness to the big, multi-connector at the front right of the Relay
Board ( PIN # 13 ).


  -- To be safe, Disconnect the POS Battery terminal connection before
proceeding. --  

Pull this relay board connector straight up and off the relay board (Flat
screwdriver can be carefully used to help pry up)  The wire pins are
numbered on the connector's bottom.  Check the connectors, especially the
BLACK w/RED STRIPE wire ( PIN # 13 ) that goes back to the fuel pump.  Do a
Continuity Check between this end and the fuel pump end.  


To check Continuity you'll need to make a length of wire (w/fuel pump-type
connector) to act as bridge back to the relay board wire end and your OHM
meter]  

[75-76 wire runs through the center tunnel - you'll have a bit more work to
trace the wire - possible inside problem points are @ firewall access point
between seats and at exit point at the front of the tunnel.]


If these wires, so far are good, and you're still having problems:

The RELAY BOARD:  (Please read Kjell Nelin's description of the relay
board's construction!)

Embedded in the underside of the relay board are 70's-style, usually sturdy,
circuit tracks.  You can trace and check the continuity of these circuit
tracks!  In the manual (in non-factory manual too!) is a good photo-diagram
of the relay board circuit tracks....it would be best if you'd find it and
follow along...

The fuel pump [ + ] wire is connected to the ppin that's in the
top-/left-most postion.  The track goes down to 2 places: 
 - Pin 87 on the second relay up from the rear of the relay board [FUEL PUMP
RELAY]. This is the Pin located at [7:00] position.  Check continuity
between this Pin 87 and the Pin 13 at the top connection.  

Note that this circuit track also goes to the pin bank at the bottom right
of the relay board.  The pin that the track connects to there is the
bottom-/right-most Pin 12 (see diagram in manual).  Check the track to this
point too.  Note that the WHITE wire that connects to this Pin 12 goes to
the Supplementary Air Valve.  It wouldn't hurt to check that connector, even
wire Resistance, now that you're good at it  :>)  It would appear that the
Supplementary Air Valve requires this input from the Fuel Pump Relay to
operate (this is the only wire to it).  

Other FUEL PUMP RELAY pins:

Pin 30 (12:00) is the Power Supply track .  NOTE:  terminal (pin) 30 is
ALWAYS [ + ] POWER and the related wire is ALWAYS RED.  On the Relay Board
Pin 30 is in the 12:00 position for all relays. --Battery's Disconnected -
right? --  Check the track continuity between all 12:00 pins. Remove the
lower 25A fuse (blue) and check between its left contact point and the
bottom rely's 12:00 pin.  If it's OK, check, clean and retension the fuse
holder connectors, install a good fuse.


At this point, you might want to reinstall all relays, wires/connectors
(incl. fuel pump). Connect the Battery.  
See if the heater blowe works (lever beteen seat, blower in engine
compartment). 

All relays have the same Part #911.615.109.01   Try switching the fuel pump
relay with the Heater Blower Relay (Bottom Relay)  (Top relay is for Rear
Window Defog grid, 2nd relay is the POWER SUPPLY Relay). 

- ----Disconnect Battery POS before proceeding----

Note that the POWER SUPPLY Relay is critical, and is track-connected from
its Pin 87 [7:00 position] to the Fuel Pump Relay Pin 85 [3:00 position].
The track is further connected to the 4-terminal connector at the
bottom-left of the relay board [Note: 1.8s don't use this
connector],specific pin is the TOP RIGHT SPADE terminal.  Check continuity
between these end-points.  The dbl. wires (16 & 24) from this spade (as well
as the others at this connector, except 1.8s) runs to the computer
(configuration varies w/engine size/year).  I'm not digging deeper now, but
you could check the connection & wire continuity)

Pin 86 [3:00] on the Fuel Pump Relay is connected to the TOP LEFT SPADE,
also at this connector.  You can also check the track continuity between
these two points, and check the wire back to the computer (connection 19 at
the computer's connector).

While we're at this connector, the bottom left spade belongs to wire 31.
Manual shows it going to the cold start valve wired in series with the
thermo-switch.


The bottom right spade wiring is different on the two computers I'm looking at:

039 906 021A   (2.0  1975)  dbl. wires #18 and 33
022 906 021E - Dr914's catalog shows this as 2.0 computer (pre-75?)- Dave D.
confirm #'s for your 74 2.0 and please report!!!

part # label missing - from '73 1.7  - single wire, red ink #16 (looks like
16, but maybe 18???)

Electrically, from the manual, the bottom two spades are connected together
internally, and go to the starter (yellow wire, pin 6 on bottom right
multi-pin connector.


Well, that's it!!!   Is your pump working now?

I hope this has helped!  Please make any corrections/additions/variations to

I've always felt that red was a good color for the Italian cars but that
silver was more 'proper' for the Porsche (that said, I still prefer fly

Original color is usually better than any other, but I don't know anyone

Subject: Best material to learn 911 engine repair

Hi again,

Problem:  Everytime something on my car breaks, like once a week 
so far this summer, I seem to be at a loss for knowledge about how
to fix it, aside from looking in my Haynes manual.  I can't wait to
get to work and post a question here, wait a day or two, and then
check the responses, spend a day or two taking car appart, order
part, wait 4 days for it to come in, and then another 2 days putting
it in the car.

I have been busy on this list asking various questions about
the frequent engine/car problems that I have been having with
my '81 911SC (oil leak, broken motor mount, fluctuating idle, etc.).

To eliminate my lack of wisdom on this, what resources - video's, or 
more appropriately books/manuals are available that will guide me in
detailed repair of the 911 engine?  (also the car in general).  I
have the Haynes manual but it seems sort of lacking in the detail
I am looking for.  I was thinking of buying the PCA Tech Tips 
book, Volume VI I think covers the 911 engine.  I am willing to

I agree, the classic Porsche color is silver (with red interior!) but there

I seem to remember a race series (Can-Am?) where the country of the
car could be determined by the color.

USA cars were white, Italian: red, German: Silver, and British cars
were "British Racing Green".  Either France or Japan was yellow.

At least one of our number (which has increased by one --
jcjensen@raychem.com) won't be in Monterey until Saturday.
So maybe Saturday night would be better.  We could, as suggested,
say an hour after vintage racing ends, but some of us may not
stay until the bitter end, and thus wouldn't know when it ends.
Maybe it would be better to set a time.  How about 7 PM?

Regarding a place, since jimorale@nps.navy.mil suggests that
London Bridge is a nice English-style pub with ample parking 
(don't want to get those doors dinged!), I tend to favor it
over the Hog's Breath Inn (Carmel is usually a pain to park and
drive in at any time).  Anyone strongly opposed?  Any other
suggestions?  Anyone have more precise directions on how to get
to it?

Someone also suggested getting together with the PCA contingent
at Laguna Seca.  As I recall, the parking area usually has 
"corrals" arranged by different marques.  I don't know how to
join whatever is being set up by PCA.  Does anyone else know
how to make advance contact with this group?  we ought to be 
able to find them once we get there, but it might be nice to see
about joining them -- i.e., parking there.  The last time I went, 
'93, there was a special event honoring the 30th anniversary of
the 911, and I got to park my car in a special paddock in the

Currently, headlight upgrades are illegal in California on public
roads, so DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING!

1)  Get a set of Hella 7" H-4 headlights.

2)  Replace the 55/60 elements with 55/80's or 55/100's

3)  Install a relay (or two) near the headlights for the high-beam
    circuit.  Use a heavy gauge of wire from the relay to the power,
    as 100w lights do draw some current.  

Headlights will run $30~40 each.  GPR had the elements cheap ($8)
last time I checked.

        Yes, the wheel locks can definately affect the wheel balance.

        Can't remember about my 944, but on the 911 the end of one of the wheel 
studs is painted (red on mine). Porsche advice is that the hole nearest the tyre
valve *must* go on this stud, and the wheel lock *must* also go on this stud.

	I came a cropper yesterday when trying to remove my wheels to clean them 
for the local PCGB concours on Sunday. The wheel nuts (which were last fastened 
by my local dealers) were *incredibly* difficult to open, and I ended up 
shearing off the third one I tried to open. When I went to my dealers, they 
sheared off 2 more. Total cost to drill out the nuts and replace the studs was 
132 pounds Sterling. Ouch ... an expensive way to take my wheels off!! What can 
I do to prevent this happening again (especially as the studs were properly 
lubricated and torqued to 130 MN / 94 ft-lb)?

        BTW, doubt it will affect wheel balance :-) but in a recent Excellence 
article it was stated that the bottom of the crest on the centre cap should 
point to the valve for maximum concours points. I've looked at various factory 
literature and press photographs and the orientation of the crest always seems 
to be random. Any concours nuts out there like to comment?

    John:

    This is DANGEROUSLY BAD advice.  Remember, you're stopped for a
    reason; presumably there's cross traffic that you're choosing to
    ignore in favor of staring intently at your rear-view mirror...
    When you "peel out" into this traffic, you're likely to die.

    Besides, when do you make the determination to squirt out into this
    traffic?  When the car behind you is 50 feet away?  100?  500?

    Let's say that the car coming up fast behind you is a Ford Taurus
    GL (only because I have braking data for that car here in front of
    me), and that he's traveling at 70 mph.  For you to avoid being
    hit, you have to accelerate to 70 mph before he closes the
    distance.

    Ok... I have no idea what you drive, but let's give you the benefit
    of the doubt and say you're in something spectacular that can do
    0-70 in 6 seconds.
    
    This means that -- assuming you've trained under John Force, your
    tires are warm, the road's clean, and you're willing to let the
    Taurus' front bumper just tap your rear at the instant that you
    match his speed -- you have to leave the line when the Taurus is
    600-PLUS feet behind you, so you'd have to make the decision when
    he was about 700 feet back.  If you wanted to leave enough time to
    check for cross traffic, he'd have to be about 900 feet back. 

    Keep in mind that these numbers assume the absolute best case.
    
    Since the Taurus can stop from 70 mph in under 200 feet, you're
    going to look pretty stupid jumping out of the way when he's still
    half a block behind the point where he planned to start braking.

    Another reason not to follow your advice:  When a clutch cable
    breaks, it will inevitably be while the pedal is depressed.  If
    this happens during a shift, it's no big deal -- annoying, but not
    life-threating.  If it happens while you're sitting at a traffic
    light with the car in gear, you'll be catapulted into the
    intersection where, again, you're likely to die.

    One more:  Constantly holding the clutch is tiring.  After a while,
    you'll probably let up on it a little, thereby wearing it out at a
    tremendously-accelerated pace.  Expensive and pointless.

>And any time, any where, any situation, be ready with at least one
>contingency plan to deal with each possible bone-headed move that

    This, on the other hand, IS good advice.  Just be sure that your
    contingency plan has some merit.

dig began in the mid '60s when 356 owners would flash their car's

356s, 911 owners would do the same to other 911s (or, God forbid, a
912--You may be forgiven for this atrocity cuz a 912 looked like a 911 head
on), but never would a 356 salute a 911 because (drum roll, please) it was
Not a Real Porsche!  And later, no self-respecting 356 or 911 would never
ever salute a 914 cuz 914s are NARP!!

        I have always enjoyed this ritual between P-cars but,

You didn't say if you had an early or late 914.  I have a "side-shifter"
('73-up), and don't know much about "tail-shifters".

The biggest improvement can be gotten by renewing ALL of the bushings.
The most over-looked is the one inside the very last coupling.  (Ball
in cup, inside the black cover)

If all of the bushings are in good shape, the shifting really isn't 
all that bad.  If you're having trouble finding the gears, putting
a short-shifter on it will make them even harder to find.

The only benefit of stiffer springs is making it harder to do a
4->1 shift instaed of a 4->3 shift.

Nope. USA was white with blue trim. Germany was white. Belgium, yellow.
Holland, Orange. France, blue, etc.

It was not the CanAm series -- they painted usually with whatever color
their sponsor logo used. The "country-colors" were used in "international"

You may not have read through the story there- this was 2:30 am on
a road that has no reason to have a stop light to begin with. I was
stopped because the light was red. No other reason at all, and I
rather wish, in that particular case, that I hadn't stopped. Hindsight
is 20/20...

Let's further assume that I am not a compleat idiot (despite the fact
that yes, I have Muir). All that matters, wrt this little manurever,
is that I'm not in the idiot's way before he gets to where I was
patiently waiting for the light to change. And that means getting
out of his way. Why would I want to try to accelerate along the path
he is most likely to follow?

The German cars were white until they discovered that there were about
6 pounds of paint on the car, and if they just ran the aluminum bare,
that was 6 pounds less weight... hence the "Silver Arrows".

As a relative newcomer to the Porsche world I always flash my lights at

         THE COLOR IN RACING    (ROAD AND TRACK- 1960)


    REFERENCES are often made, in R&T, to the "red"  cars
        from  Ferrari  or  Maserati,   the   "green"   cars   from
    Vanwall, Aston Martin or  Jaguar  and  the  "white"  or  "sil-
    ver" cars from Mercedes-Benz.
       These are not arbitrary colors  picked  by  each  construc-
    tor for his cars (except in the  case  of  strictly  national,
    local or club  competition,  where  anything  goes),  but  are
    the result of a decision reached in the early days of  racing.
    Cars were, and still are,  distinguishable  by  assigned  num-
    bers,  but  further  separation  (prompted  no  doubt  by  na-
    tionalistic feelings) was felt desirable.  This is  why  racing
    cars from Italy are red,  the  cars  from  England  are  green
    and the  cars  from  Germany  are  white  (or  sometimes  sil-
    ver-the  result  of  leaving  the  aluminum  body  unpainted).
       A private  owner  will  generally  paint  his  car  in  the
    color(s) of his  own  country,  rather  than  the  manufactur-
    er's.  According to the C.S.I.  of  the  F.I.A.,  "The  use  of
    distinctive colors  of  nationality  is  compulsory  when  the
    supplementary  regulations  of  the  competition  require  it.
    These  colors  are  determined  by  the  nationality  of   the
    competitor."  So,   a   Ferrari   owned   by   an   Englishman
    would be painted green, even though it  was  an  Italian  car.
       Thus, it has become a  tradition  for  racing  cars  to  be
    painted in the colors of the entrant, although  they  are  oc-
    casionally seen  with  minor  variations.  Mercedes,  for  ex-
    ample,  honored  Englishman  Richard   Seaman,   who   was   a
    Mercedes  team  driver,  with  a  green  border   around   the
    grille opening  of  his  car.  The  shrewd  Germans  had  also
    noted that this would allow  quick  identification  if  Seaman
    and one of  the  other  Mercedes  drivers  (who  would  be  in
    identical cars) chanced to pass rapidly by  the  pits  at  the
    same time.
       Because  these  colors  were  assigned  during   the   days
    when racing cars  possessed  chassis  that  were  visible  be-
    neath  the  body,  many  countries  have  a   combination   of
    colors: one for the body,  one  for  the,  chassis  and  some-
    times another for some other  part,  such  as  the  wheels  or
    hood.  This  presented  a  problem  when   streamlining   came
    into fashion and the chassis  disappeared  from  sight.  As  a
    consequence, the color formerly allotted  to  the  chassis  is
    now applied in the form of stripes  or  other  trim  over  the
    color assigned to  the  body  by  the  Code  Sportif  Interna-
    tional  of  the  Federation  Internationale  de  L'Automobile.
       To further simplify (or  complicate)  matters,  green,  the
    color assigned to the British Empire, is used as a  basis  for
    all  cars  from  England  and  its  possessions.  The  common-
    wealth  countries  use  green  as  a  body  color  with  other
    colors, at their choice,  as  stripes.  Canada,  for  example,
    uses two white stripes 4 in. wide, one on  each  side  of  the
    car's centerline and 6 in. apart.
       British racing green, to  dispel  some  of  the  arguments,
    is not any particular shade of  green,  but  Napier  green  is
    preferred.  Stirling  Moss  drove  a  light  sea-green  BRM  in
    the 1959  French  Grand  Prix.  This  was  quite  contrary  to
    the accepted general  opinion  of  what  constitutes  "British
    Racing Green" but was, nevertheless, acceptable.
       The color applied to a racing car has also  had  its  share
    of side  effects.  For  many  years  U.S.  drivers  would  not
    drive in, or in  competition  with,  cars  painted  any  shade
    of green; they believed the color  to  be  unlucky.  This  has
    diminished in recent years, especially  since  the  advent  of
    more British international competition.
       The chart lists the racing colors of each  country  as  as-
    signed by  the  C.S.I.  The  car  number  and  its  background
    color, a necessary aid to identity, are made  to  contrast  as
    as much as possible to aid race  officials  and  lap  scorers.
    Colors assigned to chassis or  underframe  in  the  chart  are
    now applied to stripes or trim.

  OFFICE MEMO          911 STALLS WHEN OIL CKed               Date:7/21/95

I have an '83 911 SC.  When I remove the oil cap to check the oil (engine
running) the engine begins to idle rough and after a short while stalls.  This
has occurred a majority of times I have checked the oil.  Sometime I'm quick
enough to check oil before it stalls, but it always idles rough when I remove
the oil cap.  (Otherwise, the car appears to operate fine.)
What does this indicate?  Is there something wrong that needs attention?

Think of this as one hose, in two parts.  The first part
runs from the LH heat exchanger to the engine surround feed-
thru, and the second goes from the feedthru to the thermostat
device on the MFI pump.  It attaches to an inlet on the LH heat 
exchanger about 6" down from the top of the exchanger, the top 
being where interior heat is supplied.   The MFI system won't 
work well without both parts.  If you're not fussy about 
originality, just about any old hose will do, preferable a 
reasonably think one that is a fairly good insulator so hot air 
from the exchanger will arrive at the MFI pump in a reasonably 
efficient manner.  FWIW, I used a heavy piece that I had on hand 
for the lower part, and one of those flexible things for the upper.

>Also, the fitting on the exhaust is on a kind of jacket or heat
>exchanger 

This doesn't make sense to me.  The outlet for the hose to the MFI 
pump sticks out of the heat exchanger as noted above.  On the 
bottomof the exchanger there is something like what you 
describe, a sort of heat exchanger exterior to the main heat 
exchanger if you get what I mean.  Its outlet is large, about 2" in 
diameter, and it supplies heated air through a hose that runs 
through a hole in the engine surround in the rear left corner and 
then on up to a big plastic 'box' and then into the air filter.  The 
box is supposed to mix hot and cool air to provide the engine 
with a constant, optimum temperature air supply.  Lots of guys 
don't install this hose.  It tends to suck up road dirt and direct it 
into your filter.  I don't have mine on, and I can't tell the 
difference.  I may be way off base, but I think it's just another of 
those things that was stuck on cars of that vintage to overcome 
the new emission laws.  It has virtually nothing to do with 
performance.

I have had h-4's in my 914 since the first week I had it, bought new, Yes,
they are illegal but the CHP has better things to do than stop you for

I agree totally. This is the reason why some newer fire engines and 
ambulances are painted bright yellow. Very high visibility. Police cars 
would also be painted yellow for this same reason, except that taxis 
already use yellow, and it would not be good to mistake a taxi and a 
police car.

I agree partially. I prefer black cars, because many cars in black look 
really nice. This is, however, a bad choice if you live in a sunny area 
because your car will heat up more, IMHO. (Is this just a myth?) It is 
also a bad choice if you get worried about the car being dirty. Black 
shows dirt very well, and is a pain to keep clean. My father's Nissan Maxima
looks great in black, but _only_ when it's clean. He's not as fastidious 
about car cleaning as I am. :-)

My vote for the next best color is silver. It is a classic German car color,
and I think Porsches look great in silver. The new 993 turbo was shown in 
silver in a couple car mags, and I've seen several silver 911s in person.
They're beautiful.

On a side note, if you ever decide to upgrade that older 930 to newer 
rotors and calipers, silver also shows off those huge red calipers well, 
especially in the newer 5-spoke wheels.

Anyone agree with silver?

That's the way it is.  God forbid you should actually have the\
same problem twice and therefore know how to solve it.  It doesn't
happen.

I've never found the manuals to be much help diagnosing problems.
They're good to help you figure out how to remove and reinstall
stuff, but that's about it.  And in spite of all the bad-mouthing
given to Haynes, I think they're actually pretty good.  They have
pretty good photos, and when you encounter a place where they might
not be exactly correct, there's usually enough there to get you
through it.

I've never seen the Workshop Manuals, and can only assume that they
must be 30 to 50 times better since they cost 30 to 50 times more.

Yes, it _does_ have to do with performance!  The hose in question is
a thick rubber one that goes from a point above the left (LIL) side 
valve cover (top right) and connects to an outlet on the heat exchanger
on the back part of the heat exchange, up kinda by the end of the
cam.  I think you're confused with the one that carries air thru
the heat excahnger to the passenger compartment...

I have heard of aftermarkey heat exchangers being made without this
little duct/outlet on them.  I know it was a concern when I went to
get SSI's for my '72.  It has them, thankfully!

The fitting above the valve cover, on the right, is just a "pass-thru"
to the engine compartment.

Inside the engine compartment, there is a paper hose, about 1 1/2" in
diameter, that actuallu has another hose inside it (or is s'posed to
anyway) to insulate it.  This goes to the top rear of the MFI pump.

This is to provide warm air to the MFI pump, so it "knows" when the engine
is warm and leans the mixture accordingly.

If you take either of these hoses off, the car will run like crap.

There aren't many subjects about these cars which I can pontificate with
much certainty, but by golly this is your lucky day, 'cause this is 
one of them! :)

Subject:  Lighting

My wife and I run some local road rallies and have been experimenting
better road lighting for a while.  We did it in phases to maintain a budget. 
Phase 1-  replaced the standard sealed beams with Hella conversion
units.  Sealed beams were 45watt low beams/55watt high beams per US
law.  We added 55watt low/80 watt high bulbs to the Hella units.  We
were concerned about the lows being an irritant to other drivers
(needlessly as it happens because the Hella units have a very distinct
cutoff on low beam and will not blind anyone on low beam if aimed
properly).  After a few rallies, we did phase 2 to get more light-  replace
the 55/85 watts with 80/100's.  This necessitated running power directly
from the battery (fused, of course) into high current relays and then to
the headlamps.  The wires that used to go to the headlamps drove the
switch terminals on the relays.  Not as tough as it sounds.  We had lots
of lights and still were okay to drive without being a menace.  Later,
phase 3 saw us add some Hella Rally 4000, which caused air rescue to
go out looking for the plane running the backroads with his landing lights
on.  We no longer need more light.  You can film color tv in front of our
car.   The road rallyists motto, " if you have enough light, you don't need
snow tires!"  

This was all done to our Jetta and my old Jeep CJ.  I don't rally in the 911
because the roads are gravel at times and I don't want to fix the chips.  I
have replaced the sealed beams with 80/100 Hella conversions and
notice a substantially safer amount of light.

Subject: Re: MFI Ducting

Hi Thom,

I don't want to make a big thing out of this, but I'm pretty
sure my note to Mitch Craig about the LH heat exchanger
hoses was clear.  The first part dealt with the important
hose from the exchanger to the MFI pump.  It's the one
you need or it'll run crappy.  I think that's the one you are
talking about too.

The second part of my message dealt with the 2" diameter
hose that supplies hot air to the plastic box that regulates
the temp of the air being sucked into the engine.  That one
you don't need, and in fact, there are some who routinely
remove it becase, as I said, it can suck up road debris and
deposit right into the engine air intake thereby dirtying
the air filter, or if particles get through the filter,
ruining the engine.  Note that this hose, the unnecessary one
is 2" in diameter.  The hose to the MFI pump (which is in
two sections, one above and one below the engine surround) is
only about 1" in diameter.  It's hard to mix them up.

Having just spent about 30 seconds deep in thought, it seems to me
that fixing things (911s included) is basically knowing *how* some-
thing works (to diagnose the problem) and then having the tools/
ability/know-how to take it apart and fix it.  Having stated this 
questionable gem of wisdom, I would recommend getting your hands
on anything that explains *how* the particular item you're concerned
with works.  There are alot of sources out there for this kind of
info relative to 911s.  Bruce's book is good, the Bosch "Technical
Instruction" Manual for K-jetronic is good, the Haynes' manual has its
moments...

If you have the luxury of time, sometimes it is fun to just tinker
around and take things apart, see how they work, etc.  (I'm a mech.
engineer - taking things apart to see how they work is my life...)

Unfortunately, gaining this knowledge is a time-consuming venture.

Barry,

This is real easy.  You basically remove the air filter cover and
loosen the two clamps that secure the boot to the sensor beam/
throttle plate jobbie-do and pull it off.  It's been awhile since I've
done this (sorry), but you may want to make sure nothing is connected

That's it.  Once you do this you can line up the clamp screws for easy

Speaking of swapping in a used CD ignition box, I see that the '69-'77

that this is a byproduct of covering a car.  Any physical scientists out there

Subject:       How Low Can You Go?

After the thread on revving ones engine about town (six months or so
ago), I'm hesitant to bring this up, but I'm getting nervous...

What constitutes "lugging" a 911 engine?  How many revs is too few?  Can
I tool around town at 2000 in 3rd, can I try to accelerate from 2200 in
5th, just how slow can I go in first?

I asked my mechanic what was lugging, and he said "anything below 3000."
This seems excessive, but what do I know?.  I knew what was lugging in
my old four cylinder rice burner, but a performance flat six is a whole
different world.  Obviously the answer will depend on a large number of
factors, but I'm looking for some general rules of thumb

I've been going on the assumption that 2200 was "the bottom" in anything 
other than first, unless I was basically coasting.  I'd hate to put undue 
strain on the motor (a sort of stock 2.7).

We need another contentious debate, now that the fog lights and 
tires-in-the-road threads are fading...

Subject: Outside mirrors for older 911

To close the loop on my "rectangular mirrors for 72-73 911" question:

Several respondents indicated that the mirrors I wanted were only
available for the left side.  I got some indications of sources for
left side mirrors and a couple of offers for sale or trade of that
single mirror.  However, my problem is that someone had installed
aftermarket mirrors on both sides.  I neet to have matching mirrors
on the car, or repair the holes on the right side.

One respondent said he'd checked in England and found only round
ones on the 2.4-liter cars there.

I thought I'd seen ads for dual mirrors like I described, or seen
them on a car somewhere, or something.  I could be mistaken.

It sure looks like the car was set up for mirrors on both sides,
because of the holes on the inside of both doors for accessing the
nuts on the mirror bolts.

If I could find some aftermarket mirrors that were positioned to the
rear of the mounting bracket (so the right side one is not blocked by
the "A" pillar), I'd consider them.  But I haven't spotted any.

I guess I'll stick with my round ones.  Bummer...

On any of our cars, you can always watch the driver try to (without 
watching) place the key into the ignition, and then shift from park to 
reverse. A fairly simply task? I think not. The Porsche, with key on left 
dash, Toyota on right dash, Buick and VW on right steering wheel column, 
then all but Buick with center shift (Buick has column shifter), it's 
amazing that there aren't little scratch marks and fingerprints in these 
most common areas... Of course, we don't have a Saab, or else, someone 
might try to place the key into the shifter... :)

With normal compression and plug fouling the usual culprit is a worn valve
guide.  Smoke after a couple of days' inactivity reinforces that diagnosis.
 But, before replacing it, ask yourself why that one is worn when the others
aren't.  Possibly a slightly bent valve stem?  (Over-revving might do that to
a single valve.)

Good luck in finding the problem.

Correction: WERE illegal. I went to my local sports car accessory

they are. (Just look at the bulb itself - says H4 right there.) 
They're got the almost-flat glass in front, and the 
radically-different light pattern, and everything else like the Euro 
H4s - only DOT-approved. (Probably just from the addition of the 
three teats for alignment.)

Please don't do it!  Don't spoil the car's originality!

How many of us are now desperately seeking original equipment or otherwise
struggling to put our older cars back the way the factory built them (and
cursing the PO's for doing the sh*t they did!)?  Not only are Porsches much
more valuable in their original state, they are often easier to maintain,
sell, and certainly admire.  (There are a few legitimate exceptions for
mechanical improvements like chain tensioners). 

The only excuse I can see for modifying these works-of-art is to improve them
for racing.  And even then it's a good idea to try to limit  changes to
improvements that can be easily turned around (wheels/tires, springs, sways,
height, even engines).  Okay... extreme changes are sometimes necessary for a
track car.  But usually a modifier accepts that such changes make it a race
car forever.

If you must have the C2/C4-look sell your Carrera and buy a 964.  For the
$10-15k difference you get a real C2 with a 3.6, ABS, improved ergonomics,
legible dash dials, better ventilation, etc.  If you consider resale you'll
probably spend less this way (figure your 84 will be worth about 20% less due
to your mods).

There oughta be a law...

Subject: 914: Bad Trigger Points?

Hello All,
    My '76 2.0 was missing badly on start up in the morning, after 
crossed fingers I drove a few blocks and the missing mostly subsided but
I was not confident enough to drive the 30 miles to work.  I called in to 
the boss and took the car apart.
1) good spark at all 4 cylinders, all parts are very young, rotor, cap, 
   plugs, points, condenser...good connections...good spark (ouch, it                      
   always hurts when I check spark)
2) pulled injectors out of manifold, put glass vials over ends, removed     
   battery, disconnected coil, and powered up fuel pump from remote          
   battery...no leaks after 5 minutes of running pump.
3) replaced battery, double-checked (disconnected?) coil, cranked engine 
   for 15 seconds (didn't floor accelerator while cranking)....got fuel 
   in #'s 1 & 3. Compared levels...same. No fuel in #'s 2 & 4.
4) switched leads to injectors...retried..got no fuel this time in #'s 1 
   & 3, got fuel in #'s 2 & 4...same level.....OKAY, injectors are good, 
   but I'm not getting a signal from two of the four injector 
   leads....CALL Automobile Atlanta's tech line....says trigger points 
   bad or bad connection.
5)  pulled distributor and ECU, checked continuity between trigger points 
    connector and ECU pins....all good..checked continuity between ECU 
    pins and injector leads.. all good.. found previous mechanic had 
    switched #'s 1 & 2 so it explained the side-to-side rather than 
    diagonal firing (fuel) order....no problem to fix (tan booted leads 
    go to rear, black to front).
6)  trigger points..good continuity for 180 degrees of distributor 
    rotation on both sides (A & B)..examined points..no obvious pitting 
    or carbon, cam follower looked ok.

What Gives?....either my ECU has died on only one of the two channels... 
or there is something I am missing about what makes up a "good" set of 
trigger points.  One fellow I talked to says the voltage across trigger
points is very low and they need to be clean.  The missing when cold, 
then (somewhat) smooth running after temp is reached may be due to the 
resistance of any GUNGE on the contacts lowering.  I haven't had a chance 
to go back and actually measure the resistance across each set. Does any
one know what it too much?  I did use common grease on the cam about 600 
miles ago and it was sort of messy in the trigger point area..does this
need to be PRISTINE?  Any suggestions?  Any other way to check the ECU
out of the car?

thanks

Yes! Well, after a fashion anyway...

The shop manuals are fabulously detailed, have all the spec and call
out all the approved proceedures and such but they make significant
assumptions about your skill level as a mechanic. If you find that
they are NOT what you need, your best bet is to buddy up with someone
in your PCA region and seek mentoring.

Barry writes:


My 1981 911SC began to smoke ALOT last night on the way home.
Not from the exhaust pipe, but from oil leaking somewhere from
the front of the engine onto the muffler / heat exchanger.  Near
the front oil cooler on the engine.  It looked like my car was 
on fire.  The OEL light on the dash came on too. 

*******************************************

Most likely you have a bad oil light sender.  It's located forward 
for the FI ducting.

The part is about $10.

The hard part is getting to it.

Here's what you do:

1) Lower the engine.

2) May need to remove the throttle body to lifting plate ducting.

3) Clean the area around the old sender (brake cleaner is good).

4) Replace sender.

5) Put everything back together.


How to lower engine:

1) Support engine with floor jack.

2) Disconnect the hard oil line (not the one from the oil tank) on the
   right side of the car.  You need something like a 30 or 32 mm wrench
   and a 36 mm wrench.  Some oil will leak, a few ounces.

3) Disconnect the oxy sensor (don't forget this!)

4) Remove the a/c compresser - do not remove any gas fittings, just the 
   3 bolts that mount it to the bracket.  Tie this out of the way near
   the center of the engine compartment.

Note:  I think this is all that you have to remove but watch when you 
       actually lower the engine.  Look for anything getting pulled.

5) Loosen (a few turns) the transmission mounts.  These are forward of 
   the transmission and look just like the engine mounts.

6) Remove the engine mounts at the rear of the engine compartment.

7) Lower the engine with the floor jack until you have enought room
   to get your head past the FI ducting.


I've heard that this sender may be removed w/o lowering the engine.  I 
wouldn't do it because the area is *dirty* and you are going to get 
crud into the oil.

Lowering the engine like this is fairly easy - I've done it lots of times...

Oh, items (5) and (6) I'm refering to the large bolt in the center, not the 
two small ones on the side.

Subject: 944 wheel-locks DO affect balance

Well, I took the car up to 120 km/h (75 mph) on the same roads on which
the steering was shaking before. The steering wheel was rock-solid; the 
shaking was gone! The wheel weight, valve stem, and wheel-lock are
now equidistant, forming a triangle. I guess this makes sense since some
have indicated that the 944 suspension is very sensitive to slight imbalances.

So, next time you remove a balanced wheel, note the position of the lock-nut.

Subject: 944 - free-play at front suspension


Is it normal to have a bit of play when you push/pull
inwards/outwards at the top of the front wheels?
I checked, and the play is not coming from wheel-bearings.

The car is tracking fine, with no imbalance at high speeds.
However, the 'looseness' of the front end (or what I perceive
as coming from the suspension) is most apparent when 
braking towards a stop light, facing down a hill with the road
slightly bumpy. I also SOMETIMES 'feel' it when making right
turns on a bumpy road or turning onto a hill, but not always.

Could the play be coming from the shock mount at the top 
or the shock strut? If so, can anything be tightened up?

The car has 86K km (54K mi).

Subject: Indexing spark plugs for 944


I've read that slight performance improvements can be
had by indexing, or orienting the spark plugs at the correct
angle within the cylinder. This positioning is achieved by
inserting spark-plug washers of different thicknesses until
the open spark gap points the right way.

1. What is the best metal to use for the washers, taking into
   consideration factors such as thermal expansion, corrosion
   caused by dissimilar metals etc. ?

2. If I'm standing in front of my 944, looking at the engine,
    which direction should the open gap of the plug face? Left?
   Right? Towards me? Away from me?

John never said to peel out in a straight line.  Pulling onto the 
shoulder or taking an unplanned right turn are both acceptable
alternatives to being rear ended.  I always leave enough room between
my car and the car in front of me so that I can get out of the way
if someone behind me isn't going to stop.  A year ago just outside
of town a semi lost his brakes and slammed into the rear of another
semi.  Unfortunately, there were two cars and a van between the two.
Luckily, everyone lived.  Everyone of them stated that they had been
completely suprised.  Any of them following my (or Johns) advice 
would have been spared.

Sounds like you need to get yourself to a gym and get in shape.
Either that or you've got a mechanical problem with your clutch.
Clutches shouldn't be that hard to hold in.

Ken,

No this is not normal.  Check the ball joint.  It's probably
easiest to have a friend move the front wheel while you watch
the joint.  If it is this, get ready to dig deep since you 
have to replace the entire control arm.  The ball joint is
not replaceable.

>Could the play be coming from the shock mount at the top

This is a posibility that Kevin Gross mentioned to me when
I was noticing the same symtoms that you describe above. 
Since I had the bad ball joint I'm not sure how to fix a
loose strut.

>The car has 86K km (54K mi).

You may want to check at your local dealership.  You may be able
to get them to replace the control arm for free (you pay labor) 
if that is the problem.  The local dealership here tried to get 
this done for me, but PCNA wouldn't cover it since I had 75K miles.
I do know that a couple of years ago they covered several cars with
~50K miles.

Let me know what you find out.

Proper following distance is 2 seconds.

A 15 foot long car at 65 mph needs 12-13 car lengths, not 4-5.

I'm in the process of installing air in my '74 914. It appears it had air at

little smaller then the condenser box that fits on top of it. I would like to
know if there are other compressors that I can use on my two liter engine
other then the stock compressor. Currently I have the VPD underdash unit and
am contemplating DPD condenser unit in the front. The reason is that it
appears to accomodate the spare tire better then the VPD condenser unit. 
1.  Which is the better condenser? VPD or DPD
2.  What other compressors that are more efficient can I use    
      on my 914 / 2.0?
3.   When installing the hoses can I get fittings off of VW's in

In reference to early 356 silver Porsches, the dull appearance was due to the
use of nitrocellulose lacquer.  it would dull down in a matter of months to a
gray surface. Porsche started using 2 stage clear coat begining in 1969.  It
was NOT brillo that made it look like that!  A current perfect match from

I'll agree with the first point here in part, and wonder if
a clutch cable or hydraulics, throwout bearing, and so on might
not be taking more of a beating as a result. But I'll also agree
with the second - my Bug has a Gene Berg 1400lb clutch pressure plate
on it, and the time it stuck in 1st gear 35 miles from home, I
had the opportunity to operate the clutch many times on the way home.
Although I did experience some muscle fatigue in the lower left
leg, it was nothing compared to the discomfort when the cops
pulled me over for "excessive noise" 8 miles from home - which
was a perfectly fair assessment since I was doing 5000rpm at
24-25mph max. Basically I hauled it up to speed, stepped on the
clutch and coasted down while idling, repeat as needed. But I
was only going about 12 miles an hour through the area that he
pulled me over, and it wasn't too loud really if you didn't
count the headers, but once I explained my transmission problem
he just looked perplexed and waved me on.

Subject: 911 electrical questions



I'm in the process of going over the electrical system on my newly purchased
69E and I have a couple of questions.  The car doesn't match the picture
showing all of the engine control electricals on page 206 of the haynes manual,
but if I understood what they all do I should be able to figure it out.  I'm
trying to figure out if any of the systems have been modified from the 
original state.

1. The Haynes schematics show a wire going from something called a
"switching SCR" to a light on the bottom of the tach.  Near as I can
tell the only lights on the tack are the signal lights at the top, and 
the high-beam indicator at the bottom.  What does the SCR do, and what is the
function of the wire from that unit to the dash area?

2. The haynes manual refers to the "ignition trigger unit (CDS)" and a
"CDS oscillator" on separate pages.  Are these the same thing and what
do they do?

3. On the car, the regulator seems to be a two-stage deal, with the wiring
from the generator going to a small unit which is wired to a larger unit
that looks like the one shown in the haynes manual.  The manual only shows a
single regulator unit.  Does this sound like the original setup for a 69E?
What is the purpose of the smaller unit?

A few eyars ago, in Sacramento, on Arden, there was this guy in a cheeesy
monte carlo, wheels stickin' out the side and evrything, doing this
manoooover of running like a bat out of hell and then slamming on the brakes.
Luck would have it, he ended up behind me, and I bailed into a shopping
mall parking lot, and sho nuff he tags the car in front of me.

I had similar one when I was a kid, prolly been driving about a month or
so.  I was on a road that was just belowe a levee.  Very twisty.  Around
the next turn I saw one of those 76 balls whizzing along just above the levee.
I stomped on my little bug's brakes with all my might, and sho nuff, this
redneck in one of those monster trucks comes sqeeling around the turn in
my lane!  If I had maintained my previous rate of speed, he'da (real word)
run right over me!  It was just a gut reaction to watching that little
orange ball....

Subject: factory car covers

Have a question for those who are familar with the porsche factory/dealer 
car cover:
Does anyone know who manufactures these car covers, and if so, if they make 
car covers out of the *same material* for non P-cars!?  I love this 
material.  I use the factory/dealer car cover for my 356 and both 911s. 
Would be so lucky if I could get covers for my '57 VW Beetle and '64 VW 
Transporter made with the same material. TIA.

Anyone thinking of getting a car cover should read this: (my 2 cents on car 
covers)
The factory car is excellent, the best I've seen.  And it does'nt cost 
*that* much more than aftermarket covers.  It is made of some kind of woven 
nylon fiber, a light gray in color and is coated with bright silver on the 
top.  The material is something similar to material commonly used to make 
sports bags, but seems to smoother and finer.  Its extremely tear resistant, 
lightweight and its *almost* completely waterproof.  Every time it rains, 
there are pools of water on the car supported by the car cover material!  
The silver coating helps to reduce heat by reflecting it away.  Best of all, 
it says "Porsche" in red and has the logo printed on the front.  Its made 
for the car, and it *fits*.  One negative, the cover is so light that it 
gets blown around in a light wind and can be a pain to put on and remove 
with only one person.

This is the "ejection" seat activation lever :>).  Actually it is the 
"hand throttle".  By pulling it up, you can cause the car to fast idle,
etc.  Basically it is connected to the throttle and is used during
starting.

I found some "Minimum Upshifting Points" listed in a '79 SC Owner's
Manual:

1st - 2nd :  2500rpm
2nd - 3rd :  2400rpm
3rd - 4th :  2700rpm
4th - 5th :  2600rpm

I didn't find this same chart in my Owner's Manual (for a 2.7 liter),
but would expect the numbers to be similar.  What I did was took
the highest one (2700rpm) and think of it as the "minimum" for 
shifting - instead of trying to remember different rpms for each
gear.

In practice, I actually shift in the 3500-4000 range, FWIW.

BTW, if anyone needs an Owner's Manual for a '79 SC, have I got a

This kinda indicates that you are getting some "false air" in the CIS system.
I know this sounds strange, but I read once in a Toyota factory service
manual that rough idling could result if the seal on the dipstick wasn't
sealing properly.  Now, I haven't exactly figured out "false air" could be
getting into the intake system from the oil tank filler neck, but I thought
I would throw this in.

Ah.... Another "how high is UP" question....

Bone-stock low-end US spec 2.7 with CIS will make 150HP, 3.0 will make 185 HP.

High-end "prepared" engines can make a whole pile more -- more than double
that. How much money do you have?

As to what that "feels" like, the stock 2.0 914 weighs a bit over 2000 lbs
and makes a bit under 100 HP. Add 50% to the power and maybe 10% to the
weight with a low end engine. Add what, 300% power and 10% weight for the
high end.

Note that extreme engines are NOT advised for the street. Further note that
to work on the CIS in a 914 you will have to carve "access panels" in the
rear trunk and in the firewall between the passenger compartment and the
engine compartment.

Finally, when you add that much power to the already marginal brakes and
stock suspension of the 914, you're not asking for trouble, you're
outright DEMANDING it... You really need to add some form of crash protection,
possibly some chassis stiffening, better brakes, etc *FIRST*.

IMHO (my opinion is almost always humble) the lowest RPM you should use will
vary with the load put on the engine. I think 2000 or 2200 RPM is OK for
tooling around town in 3rd or accelerating slowly in 5th (not pressing the
"go" peddle very hard). If you find yourself pressing the throttle down more
and more( vague terms here, I know), you are lugging the engine and should
downshift. You may be able to maintain the same acceleration rate in a lower
gear with less throttle.

If you are trying to accelerate hard, somewhere near 4000 rpm may be closer
to where your minimum rpm needs to be. This is where my car seems to
accelerate best. Not sure about a 2.7.

As an aside, my mom used to drive me crazy. She would be in 5th gear(Honda
Civic) by the time we reached 20 mph and would almost floor it trying to
accelerate. This is an example of what I think is not good for the car
(either Honda or Porsche).

Does this make sense or am I having delusions again?

Alas, Mr. Murphy must've decided that 'twould be too great a strain on the net,

Anyway, to the subject at hand:  Why has no one suggested Bruce "Mr. 911"

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart jumps in to note that this is a classic RTFM case, 
which points out how important it is to obtain a Owner's Manual for your year 
and model if at all possible.  No offense intended, but this is covered in your
owner's manual.  I don't know about your '75 911S, dirk, but my manual ('86 
Carrera) says 1500 rpm, and I use 2000 (except for first, in heavy traffic)
as my lower limit.

A similar RTFM issue is Oil Temperature/RPM.  The manual will warn you not to 
exceed a certain rpm until the oil temp reaches the operating range.  Mine says 
NTE 4500 rpm, a knowledgeable friend said NTE 3000 rpm, so I use that.  
I'm told that this Oil Temp/RPM bit will often result in a blown head-gasket if 
the manual is not followed, and I believe that other things can be blown by 
forcing cold, thick oil through the cooling system at high rpm.

Greetings,

My dad, proud owner of an '87 Carrera, tells me that he's been hearing a
strange sound.  Said sound occurs when the oil temperature registers about
half-way on his stock guage.  Dad says that the sound has no apparent
relationship to engine, transmission or road speed.  However, the noise
ceases when the car is stopped and tossed into neutral.  When asked to
imitate the sound, Dad made a lot of strange noises I could never hope to
duplicate in text.  I did get the impression it sounds something like gear
whine.

Any thoughts?  Probing questions?  (Note:  I have tried "Why don't you take

I thought mine was doing the same, but found it to be overheating.  
However, at one time I did have trouble with it cutting out at track 
events during hard cornering.  After the wiring harness burned one day, 
it was diagnosed as having been worn through where it passes from the 
engine compartment to the rest of the car (don't remember exact 
details).  Check this before you have the same problem.  They said it 
might have been bottomed out at some point or something.  I had to fight 
both the insurance company and the sorry losers at the garage to replace 
the entire harness instead of splicing it back together.  You might also 
check the wiring by your CD unit.  Sometimes the grommets that hold it to 
the firewall age and break, and then it has a tendency to move about a 
bit during cornering, acceleration etc.  This might aggravate any loose 
connections.

I am just in the process of debugging my electric mirrors on my 911. I bought 
the entire set up from Porsche, installed it and everything works except the 
"up and down" control on the driver side mirror (Passenger side is just 
fine....
Basically if you move the switch for the mirror, no matter what direction you 
move it the mirror only moves left and right. I checked the wiring, there 
appears to be a magnetic clutch which probably changes the adjusting motor 
from "Left right" to "up down". I have checked to see if there is current in 
the wire (a white one according to the factory manual) to the clutch, and it 
appears ( or at least my ammeter thinks) that there is power to the clutch 
when the "up down" control is enabled. I am suspicious the mirror motor/clutch 
assembly is faulty .... any ideas on how to repair it or is replacement the 
only option?

Secondly, has anyone ever aligned their 911 themselves (as opposed to going to 
an alignment shop?? I basically don't trust most alignment places and was

metal", fly yellow paint job.  I was just walking out of NAPA looking for
Rochester carb rebuild kits for my Corvair engine when I heard the
denting of metal and scraping of paint.  It was enough to make my skin
crawl.  
	At least the idiot was nice about it, apologizing over and over
saying he wasn't used to such a long nose yet, and asking me to please  
not call the police.  It seems he had gathered two speeding tickets in
the six months he owned it and couldn't take another point on his 
insurance.  I never being one to force someone out of a sportscar, even
a red 'Vette, decided to take his rather generous offer of $1000 to cover
the repairs.  The door can be easily fixed, but will need painting along 
with the fender, which needs replacement (the inner fender was not 
harmed).  My brother kept some of the paint in case something like this
happened.  Anyone know of a good source for a new passenger fender or have
a nice rust free used one around?  Also, be on the lookout for balding
middle aged men in red Corvettes...

This is truly a deal- you just cannot find 911 SC's this cheap.

The car has just a little over 100K miles, has recently been 
tuned up, had its (4) CV joints replaced, almost new tires.
and is running great.

This car is perfect for someone who loves 911's but cannot
afford the typical price tag, which for a 1978 911 SC is
usually around $12 to $14,000.  All it needs is some TLC
and you will have a cherry car.

Don't get me wrong when I say this,  however.  The car is
sharp and is alot of fun.  

Give me a call at 448-9260 or email me if you are interested.

Subject: How hot can it get without blowing up!!

I finally got another crack at the track. This time a tight, 
twisty very technical course at Shannonville (about two hours 
outside of Toronto). After about 15 minutes of spirited 
"pacing", my engine temp.would start nearing 250F, and I would 
reluctantly take a break from the fun. I drive a '71 911T with 
a 2.2 litre engine. The owner's manual says it shouldn't be 
driven past 265F.

I plan to eventually install an oiler cooler, but over the 
winter project season, in the meantime my question to those 
wiser than I is whether I can safely run in the 250F range for 
the rest of the summer. I've been using Castrol Syntec 5W50. I 
don't know if this should make a significant difference one way 
or the other as to protecting my engine from harm. Also my 911 
temp is usually in the 180 to 210 range under normal use.

On a somewhat related subject, I have an opportunity to buy a 
2.2 Litre "S" motor. Assuming leak downs check out, is $3,000 a 
reasonable price? And that's Canadian bucks.

Subject: 924 Cooling problems.

Hi, 

I have a 79' 924 Lux which up until recently has behaved very well for a 16
year old car. It was stripped and rebulit a year ago and has proved very
reliable every since.  Since the weather warmed up, it is hard to keep the
engine temperature down, the gauge creeps up over half way, which it never
used to do even in traffic.  The electric fan cuts in at about three
quaters of the scale, and does cool the engine slightly, about back to 
half way again.  Only a long drive at low revs in 5th gear will eventually
bring the temp down.

Is this normal ?  I have heard 924's do have a tendancy to run on the
hot side ! or do I have an underlying problem.

Matt,

 You should NEVER use any loctite on any fuel system fitting. All the fittings seal themselves (ie. flarenut fittings) or they use seal rings of copper or aluminum. I have been working with Bosch fuel systems for alot of years and the most common problem is contamination. To use a sealant on fittings is just asking for trouble. If you have a fitting that leaks there is some other problem and it should be inspected very closely to determine the problem.
I would suggest you carefully clean all the junk off and put it all back with clean fittings and NEW seal rings.

My fellow porschephiles,

  I have noticed some unusual with my 944. A few months ago, when I went

the carpet was wet, and that it was not just a small spot, but almost 75% 
of the passenger side floor. I figured it was be wet shoes & the rain, 
and brushed it off.

  Now, months later (it hasn't rained in Upstate NY for a while), I 
notice again, that almost the entire passenger floor is wet. I am now 
VERY CONCERNED. I hope that it has something to do with my A/C, or maybe 
it happens from washing the car? Don't know, but please help if you have 
had a similar problem or know what it might be. Thank you.

Satyan,

This is usually caused by a problem with the drain from the sunroof area.
There are four hoses from around the recess in which the sunroof sits.  Two

Well, pals and gals, anybody know if I can get Glasurit in a spray can?  I was

have a nice fat scrape between the two rubber bumper pads on my 944S.  It
doesn't appear to go all the way to the metal, so I think that if I just sand it
real well I should be able to lay down a couple coats of paint and some clear
coat and be good as new.  Or should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and take
it to a good paint shop?  I'd like to avoid calling the insurance company on
this, since I have $500 deductable and I think this can be fixed for less.  Or
am I just dreaming, and this is going to cost well over that?  I know a good
paint shop, but I haven't called them yet for a guesstimate.

Ken,

As your shocks get old, it is common for them to develop play between the
piston and the shock body (the rest of the strut).  If you pull the wheel
off, then put one hand at the piston/shock interface and use the other
to push and pull on the top of the brake rotor, you can feel the play.

This may be what you have.  It's not fatal, but it is something you should
get taken care of sooner or later.  If you autocross or track the car, this
looseness might be more noticable because of the camber changes it
induces.

There was some discussion recently about belt failures within the dual

until now has been to replace the distributor, expensive.

The good news is that the needed belt, along with the upgrade vent kit, have
just become available.  With it, your original distributor can be repaired,
and hopefully with the vent kit installed the belt failure won't recur.

Dave,

You change the spring rate of a sway bar by changing the length of its lever
arm.  Longer arm length means softer spring, which means better stick at the
front and so more oversteer or less understeer.

1) Instrument lights. The instrument gauges are held in the dash by a large
rubber ring. By using a soft instrument or wrapping a screwdriver in tape,
you carefully pry the gauge out of the dash. At the back of the gauge are
some light bulb holders that are pressed into the back of the gauge. They
look like little .22 shell casings. You just pull those out and insert a new
bulb.

2) black lever - that's your hand throttle. You lift up on it and it will
hold the throttle up. It's kind of a crude cruise control. I never use it
except when I start my car in the morning. I use it as a kind of choke. Have

Andrew:

The 2.7 in my 914 makes about 260 HP, but it's built to something 
slightly above Euro Carrera RS specs, with Weber carbs.  

Slightly-modified (i.e., cheaper) 2.7s can easily make around 210-240 
HP, which is plenty in a 2100-pound car.

As regards fuel-injection, though... The 914 engine compartment is 
pretty small, which makes it really hard to fit the 
mechanical-injection stuff in there.  If, as your e-mail address 
implies, you live in Ohio, you may be able to put Webers on the car and 
stay emissions-legal.

Carbs are a bit of a pain, especially if you live somewhere with strong 
seasonal weather changes (like, umm, Ohio), but there are a whole bunch 
of people who understand them real well.  Mostly because SCCA 
[mean-spirited expansion of this acronym deleted] won't allow 
fuel-injection on 914-6s.

By the way, there's more to the conversion than simply dropping a 200+ 
horsepower motor into your 914... For safety's sake alone, you really 
should upgrade the brakes, stiffen the chassis, and add a roll cage.  
Once that's done, you'll probably want to beef up the suspension and 
regear the tranny.

For reliability, you should update the chain tensioners to the 
Carrera-style pressure-fed versions and add a big front-mounted oil 
cooler.  If you decide to use a 2.7, make sure that all 24 head studs 
are Dilivar, and that the holes they're in are Time-Serted.

Since you're going to be spending AT LEAST $15K on this conversion, you 
probably don't want to just throw an old, tired motor into your car, so 
when yuo rebuild it, have your engine-builder do the oil-bypass mods, 
add piston squirters, mod the middle air-deflectors, boattail the 
crank, etc.  Adding a 930 oil pump would be helpful, too.

It's a big job... Good luck.

Subject: 914 Fuel Cell / Fire System

Does anyone know of a supplier of fuel cells that fit in the stock 914 
gas-tank location (or, better, inside the existing tank)?  I'm finally 
gonna get one (I've been in three car fires, and I didn't like any of 
them), but I don't really want to lose my front trunk.  One MUST draw 
the line somewhere, after all.

Also...

After discovering that I can't lift my 5-lb Halon extinguisher with one 
hand [Attention Ross Stites:  Please don't suggest, again, that I go to 
a gym and get in shape; it's the circumference of the bottle, not its 
weight], I'm about to put a real fire system in the car.  I assume that 
the electrically-triggered systems include a cap that holds enough 
charge to fire the system even in the event of battery-power loss... Is 
this true, or must I buy a mechanical system?

 -Andy

P.S.  Anyone want to buy a fully-charged 5-lb Halon extinguisher with
      steel mounting bracket?  $100-or-so new... I'll sell it for $65
      plus shipping costs.

Subject: My 'new' 911, & Sportomatic questions!

Howdy all,

Picked up my '65 911 wedensday, bought from SF(through a fellow p'filer.)

The car started immediately I started cranking it and it was a great
pleasure to actually drive a car out through the harbour gates. (356's and
trailers have been the story so far..... :)

No problems encountered, and the 125 miles trip home went like that.....

I'm getting used to the Sportomatic now, but I would prefer changing to a
901. In the mean time I wonder;

Does the Sportomatic need ATF? In that case where? I would not suspect the
gearbox to live on other stuff than 80/90W something, but is there a closed
'circuit' for the converter somewhere??

Is there any god informative reports or technichal specifications for the
Sportomatics available? I hate being in doubt!!

How's the car???
****************
For being a '65 the car is *very* dry, but I noticed the need for new
'pick-up-points' for the front suspension. This is of course the typical
front suspension pan rust. It is perhaps the most available rust repair
panel for the 911's and I plan changing it for the winter. I used the better
part of thursday bumping out 'repro patches' and it is actually not
difficult as long as you have the tools. Later I cut the worst pieces off,
and welded in the patches. Really flush fit. It is almost impossible to
spot, and the technician that checked out the car at the 'DMV' didn't really
notice it.

I started to rip out the front hood seal and found some rust just above the
line where the fender bolts to the chassi. This was impossible to guess as
the wheelhouse did not show any signs, neither the seals, they just were
crackled and dry. Guess the seals was the reason to this too.
 
These fenders are expensive and hard to find, and since they are rust free
apart from these areas I plan to remove them this winter and cut the rusted
area and weld in fresh steel. The visible parts of the fender are otherwise
perfect! The patch will be butt welded and will only be to the mounting flange.

Anyone seen or done this before??

Rust proofing.
**************
I'm planning to rustproof the car by drilling holes in all hollow sections
and fill it up with oil (vegetable 'lin-oil'). Anyone have an idea where
these hollow section mainly are located??

I'm going to do;
The front 'channels' as running on the outer sides of the chassi, the heater
channels on the side of the pan, the 'chanels' running from the rear of the
pan up to the shock towers and rearwards.

Are there any other hollow sections that could need rust proofing??

I'm rather happy with the car, preparing it for another 30 years of life
with rust proofing and new seals. Hopefully there will be a 901 installed
soon, and I just can't wait for the Porsche club to hire the Rudskogen track
for a weekend of testing and fast driving!

Race car search.
*****************
In the mean time my search for a '65 911/912 for vintage racing goes
on,...if you happen to know of such a car, in a state that is 'appropriate'
for a serious race car I'd be interested.

...off for a week in the Mountains,(.Porsche roads :-)

cheers,
Trond V.

The Sporto uses stadard manual trans fluid for the main housing. The torque
converter gets its oil supply from the engine.  It is supplied by an extra
set of oil lines from the oil tank thru a pump that is driven off of the
drivers side camshaft, and thru concentric oil seals in the bell housing.

>Is there any good informative reports or technichal specifications for the
>Sportomatics available? I hate being in doubt!!

Only comprehensive supply of Sporto data I know about is in the factory
manuals.  They give a good description of how it works, how to adjust it,
etc.  If nothing else, spring for the microfiche  shop manuals  and Part
Manuals for your 911 year. I'd call Stoddards here in the US and have them
ship them to you.  I THINK they are less than $20.  The pictures don't do too
well from what I understand, but you should be able to get by. The parts
manual will be INDEPENSIBLE!

Converting from a Sporto to a manual gearbox is rewarding.  I did it on a 71
911T we used to own. Not hard to do, but requires a LOT of parts.

I'm confused about a '65 911 having a Sporto.  According to Excellence was
expected, the Sporto did not come out until  model year'68. Was your car
retrofitted with the Sporto, or was it a prototype or what?

Fuel Safe will make custom bladders for just about any OEM tank, for a price.
 Each application is different, so give them a call for a catalog and more

the standard location for a 914, but they can modify your OEM tank.  I saw
one they did for a 550 at Brumos Porsche.  Couldn't even tell from the

Subject: Alternator light

Bill Dunham's recent post made me think of a peculiar electrical problem
that I have been ignoring on my 1977 911S since I bought it in 1989.  It has
to do with the alternator warning light and the EGR light.  Goes like this:

1.  The alternator light glows normally when the ignition is turned on, but
remains dimmly lighted after the engine is running.  The EGR light is also
on (though the car no longer has its EGR 'goodies').  Intensity of the
warning lights do not seem to change as the engine is revved.

2.  The problem used to come and go when I first got it, though the battery
has *never* gone dead.  Replaced the votage regulator with a German
aftermarket solid state unit when I bought the car: no change in the
symptoms.  You can leave the car sitting for days at a time without battery
discharge, so I don't suspect the alternator diodes.

3.  The past few years, the lights have remained lighted, and I've learned
to ignore it.  The battery never goes dead (now making a statement like that
is tempting fate, isn't it?), and it doesn't boil over.  However "something
is broken, and I wnat to fix it".  (How's that for a switch on an old saying?)

I'm an EE, but the problem is that none of my manuals seem to have a wiring
schematic that shows the EGR light circuitry, and so it's kind of tough to
track down the problem. The only clue I've found is that the system voltage
at the back end of the car is a bit higher than I'd expect, but I put that
down to voltage drop along the regulator's sense lines to the battery at the
front of the car.   

I'm hoping that this is a common problem, that combined experience and
net-knowledge can help me sort out.

Many thanks,
...Gregg

Jon is right on track here... This is the only way you can get a 
good setup. Note however that you'll have some re-plumbing to do --
the fuel return lines will need to run up to the top of the cell
instead of just into the bottom of the tank.

I've *seen* one that that they did for a 914, but neglected to get a price.
I'd imagine that it's between $500 and $1000, though.

Subject: Teaching other drivers a "lesson"

Howdy P-folks, I was wondering if I might have a group opinion on 
something.  Here in New England where people are nasty drivers I have 
seen a pattern I really dislike.  While my girlfriend was driving her 
Acura and I watched helplessly in the passenger's seat, she decided that 
the car behind her was following to closely and she intentionally hit the 
brakes hard for a second to throw him off.  I heard a screech from behond 
and, although we weren't hit, I screamed at her for the next 10 mintues 
about it.  She insisted he needed to be taught not to tailgate _her_, and 
I tried to drive into her impetuous mind how foolish it was and how the 
possible consequences are horrible.  Sure, teach him a lesson but never 
walk again.  Or worse, teach him and the child in his car a lesson.  
Anyway, she came to see it my way, that it just wasn't worth it.
	Last night on my way home from work (about 1AM, late worker) I 
was "taught a lesson."  On a highway entrance which splits from one lane 
to 4 suddenly I was following another car closely for just a couple of 
seconds until the highway would split and I would go around.  Right 
before the split the driver in front decided to slam on his brakes (from 
50mph down to about 10) before I could go around.  I've never been fond 
of my 914 brakes, but I floored them and the front wheels locked for a 
second and then released.  It was a miracle that I was able to avoid 
colliding, and was very perturbed.  He then made a finger gesture to me 
out his sunroof and proceeded to swerve back and forth across the highway 
(now 4 lanes) in front of me to keep me from passing.  Of course since he 
was in an inferior car I managed to fake one way and zip past him on the 
other side, but I thought the whole incident was ridiculous!  There seems 
to be this mindset up here in the north and it is foolish!  Has anyone 
else ever experienced this?  Am I really evil for following closely for a 
brief moment until I can get around?  Thanks for your opinions and for 
letting me vent!   Rick and Gretchin with 2 tiny wear marks

     My '85.5 944 was doing this.  I kept bleeding the cooling system, 
     checking mixture of antifreeze, etc.  It finally went away when I took 
     the temp sender out of the radiator and replaced it.  I did replace it 
     with one that drops both switches by about 5-10 degrees each.  These 
     are readily available for 924s, mine cost $12.  I figured that the 
     fans would run more often with the lower temp, but strangely they 
     don't!  The only thing I can figure is that I got a good sized air 
     pocket out of the system when I refilled and bled it.  BTW mine stays 
     just a hair below the first mark now, with brief excursions up to 
     horizontal when racing on short courses.
     
     These lower temp switches take a lot of stress off the cooling system, 
     but I wonder how much stress they put on the fans, and if you lose 
     some (small) efficiency by running at a lower water jacket temp?
     
     If you want to force the fan(s) to run at fast or slow speed all the 
     time, I could give you a diagram of which line(s) to jump on the relay 
     board.  I had wires with male quick disconnects on both ends which I'd 
     put in to get both fans running fast for autoXing.

Subject: 914 brake question...

P-filers,

OK small steps, small steps.  Yesterday, I finally had the car out on 
the back streets around my home.  It still needs a little more tuning 
etc. including the brakes which were OK but needed to be blead.  I have 
a rebuilt front left caliper and the rest are original.  

So this morning I set out to bleed the brakes.  All brakes went fine 
(squirting out the excess air, etc.) except for the front right.  I 
couldn't get the bleader valve off without stripping it. (I even took 
the caliper off, still no luck) So I left it as is.  The problem now 
is, I have even less brake pressure than before I blead the brakes.  I 
know I still need to fix that front right caliper, but how could almost 
no pressure be happening?  It seems the master cylinder is OK and all 
of the lines or OK.

By the way, does anyone have a front right (rebuilt or new) caliper for 
sale?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

You can probably fix the 914 brakes with new rear hoses.  They clog up after
all these years.  I have a set just bought to install on my 73.

I don't have a fix for bad drivers.  Actually, almost all drivers on the LA
freeways are reasonable, letting you merge, etc.  My job takes me to other
parts of the country, and they're all worse than here.

Seattle is LA with rain.  The freeways are clogged.  The drivers won't let
you merge - especially women.  Of all the hated Californians in Washington,
they really need some traffic engineers from down here.

Above all, don't honk when following a retard too close.  I once hit a woman
who slammed her brakes.

Two choices:

2.  Pull the cylinder and drill out and put in new bleeder valve.

Subject: Re: Teaching other drivers a "lesson"

I too have been "taught a lesson" from a driver just recently.

I was driving in the inside lane south on the 101 in the San Fernando
Valley at about 72 MPH.  This is actually somewhat slow for the 101.  A guy
in one of those ubiquitous Toyota Camry's was following closely enough that
I couldn't see his license plate.  I signaled and moved to the right to let
him by and then signaled and moved in behind him at a distance of about 4
car lengths with the intention of making more room.

What happend next can only be described as foolhardy (though I admit to
following too closely, even if for just a moment).  This man slams on his
brakes to the point of bringing up tire smoke!  I hit my brakes and moved
quickly to the right, missing his bumper by maybe a layer of paint.  He
then proceded to flip me off as most of these guys do and then took off,
weaving through the heavy traffic like a NASCAR driver.

It was fortunate that the space in the right lane that I created by moving
hadn't been closed up (as is usually the case in LA driving) or I wouldn't
have had an out and we would have had a VERY serious accident.  The brakes
on my '71T are pretty good, but not that good!

Yes, I've learned a lesson from this (though in LA ya gotta take the road
when you can), and I'm trying to allow more space before I merge back.
Still, had I been in a lesser car I can't even imagine the consequences.

What are ya gonna do!?

When I was younger and rode motercycles, my rule for survival was to

Unfortunately, it seems that now *all drivers* must consider *all other

I think the term 'Defensive Driving' covers it.

Don't ever, for any reason, under any circumstance, put yourself in a
position where the other guy can 'get you'.
Because, if you do, he will.

By the same token: 'Always leave the other guy an out.'
If you leave him someplace to go in a pinch, he will. If you don't, he can't.

Somebody has to have some brains out there.
And, as we all know, it sure as hell ain't the other guy.
So, unfortunately, it has to be you.

Hi, I have an 86 928S with a freon leak. I live in a rual area and have a
hard time getting anyone to even get close to the car! I found a good non-P
mechanic who charged it up and did a leak test but the results were
inconclusive (am working on getting a second opinion). The charge lasted
about one week. The compressor has what I consider too much oil around the
pulley and surrounding parts and I am guessing that is where the problem
is.

Since a compressor is very expensive (new $1800, rebuilt $500), I wanted to
look into getting the seals replaced. The shop manual tells how to do it,
but I have not been able to find the parts (checked Automotion, 928 Int,
and closest dealer-250 miles). Is this more trouble than it's worth?

Thanks for the help.

Believe it or not, this is taught in driver's ed, but not to this 
extreme. I think it is evil, although, many people who tailgate (my dad 
is one of them, who will still accelerate hard while the person in front 
is cramming on their brakes), I wish could be taught to stop.

Yes, I agree, but I still hate tailgaters... Of course, in NJ, there is a 
radically different view of tailgating (whole northeast vs. rest of 
country) because many times, people 'tailgate' simply in following.

Howie:

Sorry to hear about your bad luck!!  I hope I can help with some advice.

 I have been detailing cars on the side for about two years.  The only
proper way to remedy your damage is a repaint.  I know you don't want
to hear that, but any other way will not do justice to your original paint. 
I'm only saying this because you own a P-car and the general
concensus among the "Faithful" is to do the job right the first time.  

Now, if it was a lesser car,  you might get away with what is called
"Color Sanding".  This involves sanding (that' right, sanding) the paint
surface with either 2000 or 1500 grit sandpaper until the flaw is
corrected.  From this point, the surface is rubbed out with varying
degrees of liquid compound, going from a heavy to fine grit.  Eventually
all of the sanding marks are removed.  Actually, after sanding paint with
2000 grit sandpaper, the paint just looks really dull.  The problem with this
method is it just removes paint,  no paint is added.   So, if the key scratch
is too deep, this won't work.   Paint is only a few microns thick.   

 I would get opinions from a few good paint shops and then a few from
detail shops to get a good handle on how bad the damage is.

Hope this helps,

Houston *IS* coming back. And probably better than before. In the '80s,
it was the "Aawl Bidniss" or nothing. These days, it's just about everything
*BUT* "Big Oil". 

Intelligent life? That's harder. By my standard, it's pretty bleak as this
is still a hotbed of repressive neo-Nazi my-way-or-no-way Southern reformed
evangelical "Christian-ness" (which seems to all have strayed a bit from
the original intent...). There is a thriving alternative scene though
that is likely to bring in all manner of new talent and ideas, and even
the mainstream "cultural" scene is more progressive than most major cities
(Houston Grand Opera, for instance, routinely premiers one or two *NEW*
operas a year - no mean trick in a city where most people equate opera with
Bugs Bunny...) Still, it's not NYC or even (dare I say it?) LA... But
the good news is, it's not Topeka either.

Thing seem to be looking up -- at long last you can actually get a good
cup of coffee here! And conversation seems to be making a comeback, which
means that people are actually starting to READ! I was in a bookstore I

instead of "Men Who Lick Camshafts and the Nazi Sheep that Love Them" or
some such. Amazing.

And, there is now a 24 hour scene. You can actually get real food at 3:30 AM
if you want it, or drop off your dry cleaning, or even buy auto parts. 
Admittedly, not *PORSCHE* parts, but it's a start...

Who knows?? There are still a *LOT* of the "gold chain" crowd owning Porsches
because it's "the thing to do" -- it confers status, and indicates money, 
taste, and a bit of flair. Would some of these people be happier in a Lexus?
You bet. That's why they sell so many. Would they be as happy in say a 
pre-A Roadster as a C4 Cab? Probably not. Then again, isn't that true for
most of *US*?

I'm perpetually surprised by some "old fart" driving a 928 or something,
moving really cautiously and like he (typically he, anyway) has *NO* 
business in a Porsche, who pulls up next to me and comments on my 356SC and
wants to talk about the '67 911S he had or the time he went to see the
904s run at the 'ring or whatever. Blows me away, and reminds me -- yet
again -- not to judge people before I have a chance to know what's what.

Besides, look at the good news -- the poseurs who buy Porsches typically
don't run them hard, leave them with low miles and in nearly perfect
cosmetic condition, and eventually get bored and want to sell the car for
some reason. To *US*, the enthusiast market. Hopefully at a good price,
but even so where are you going to find a car that a "car guy" has owned
in that kind of shape for a good price?

And Steve Poole pointed out how folks in LA will probably take a shot at you.

Commuting on the DC beltway is something I DO NOT do in the pcar.  Traffic runs 
75-80, and if you leave a car length, someone trying out for the Emmet B. Kelly 
replacement role Try-outs will jump in.  Kinda proving Parkinson's law in the

Like Joe, Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart does not respond to greetings flipped his

I had thought my around town mileage was lower too, but that is always such
a moving target with varying traffic.

I used to get 25 mpg on the highway, and now I'm at slightly under 20 :-(

What might have been done that would cause this?  The only out of the ordinary
thing I recall was the mechanic indicated the plugs I had in there were too 
high a heat range, and he replaceds them with different plugs, but no other
indication of any other service items which should have had such a major
efficiency change that I can tell.

If I wanted to try the hotter plugs again, what might that do which would 
make it a bad idea??

No, it's not crazy. Those honda civic engines don't live well with lugging,
although they are pretty near bullet proof most ways. 5th gear is never
indicated below 40mph, and then only downhill in no hurry.

Subject: Price for a 83 SC?

P-filers,

I spotted a 1983 SC in a local sports car dealer's lot.  The car was in 
good shape with some minor body work to be done on the front air-dam 
(small dent) with the interior looking very good.  It's got 104,000 
miles on it.  Unfortunately, the dealer didn't know much about 
maintenance just saying the guy "did everything necessary" for upkeep 
and servicing (which means he didn't know anything).  He wants $13,900 
for the car.

Is this a fair price for this car and the limited info?  What are the 
top three questions I should ask before even driving the car? (Sorry, 
I'm used to looking at 914's with all of those usual questions)

Thanks in advance!

Thanks for the response, Kevin but your comment is referring to an adjustable
bar(adjustable arm length). I read about leaving the bar loose so that the car
leaned before the bar was engaged. I wonder if this affects turn in by allowing
the car to shift weight, but then hold its set when it hits the bar. Any
hotshoes out there that know about this?

Hotrodding a 944 should be like doing with a V8 except parts are more
expensive. I've always thought the nitrous would be the least expensive

Subject: Re: Buying a 914

Well, I've been trying to hold my tounge ... But since I own the car in
Question and have a lot of people judging the car without knowing anything
about it, I feel it's my duty to state my side... (Please ignore unless
you responded to Charles Cox's question about buying a 914 that I 
advertised).   This is long and wordy...

I have put a few 'plugs' for my 72 914 for sale in a few threads on the
P-Philes.  In them I've only asked $3700, yet the person who asked the
question decided to show the ad (to non-P-Philes and Non-PCA people) for
$4k.  I didn't want to waste a lot of bandwidth with blatent 'buy me'
salesmanship, but since so many people are quick to speak, I feel I must.
Please forgive me for the waste of bandwith.

Recap: 1972 914, 2.0L, Original Paint, 8 wheels/tires, A/C off car,
       heater off car. All original except engine/trans.
 
 - This has a 73 2.0L and side shift (73) trans. 
  This engine was built by a Porsche mechanic (well respected).
  This engine has less than 200 miles on the rebuild (haven't even
  done my first valve adjustment yet).  Too many reasons to list
  why I'm _*considering*_ selling it, and I wouldn't want to make
  you cry. :(  Suffice it to say I lost a wife, a 951, a dog, a job,
  and a father all within two months. (not neccisarily in that order).
  I wasn't willing to buy the car with the compression the way it was,
  so got the P.O. to _completely_ rebuild engine with no change in price.
  He could get things cheap because he does lot's of business for the
  Denver/Boulder area.  I was just trying to pass on the savings to
  the next owner (If I _do_ sell it).  Clutch and other components were
  checked while dropped, and I did surprise inspections.
 - The paint is original (i.e. never been repainted, therefore, no chance
  to hide anything)...   Yup, needs repainting, but take a look at
  it (JPG's in the tta.com/Porschephiles/Images/UPLOAD as LJ914*.*)
  and I think you'll find it's not as bad as I make it sound...
  Has a lot of door dings, scratches, etc... but nothing _too_ major.
 - For P-Phile members and PCA members, I've only asked $3700.00 but I'll be
  darned if I'll let people criticize something without even seeing it
  first.  Charles Cox should have read some of the earlier threads more
  carefully before asking the question to the P-Philes (Sorry, Charles).
  But it's good to get as many views as possible.  I welcome anybody
  who cares to take a look to come on over and share a sip and a tall
  tale or two with me, maybe even take a gander at the car.
 - The P.O. has owned this car over the past 10 years before I
  have.  He's well known to the Boulder, Colo. area.  The car is well known,
  even Tom Conway (Carquip) is familiar with the car and remarked that it
  is "very solid".  He was surprised that I managed to get the P.O to rebuild
  the engine before buying.
 - I bought the car for club racing... I didn't give a care about A/C or
  heater... I bought it because it's *solid* and *no major rust*.  Your
  definition of major and mine are probably different, but the only rust
  is on the battery support bracket / tray.  Nothing on the Frame, nothing
  on the body.  Even no rust on the 'side valances' (can't think of the
  proper name right now).  Only the heater fan and the heater hoses are
  off the car.  ( I prefer as light a car as possible, but don't have the
  heart to chop up such a great looking interior - Even original radio!).
 - Yeah, it has problems... but hey.  Mr Cox came to look at it sunday, I
  let him drive it, then out of *courtesy* I took him to PCA club racing
  at second creek, so he could be 'introduced' to a few other cars.  Along
  with that, I took copies of FAQ's for him to read when he got bored.
  Jeesh, I'm real wishy-washy about selling the thing, but times are a
  little tough for me right now and I'd rather buy a pre-setup race
  car (I might be talking to Ralph Ricks once I get back on my feet!).
 - I'll let my 914 speak for itself... Since I'm probably a little
  biased on this one.
 - P.S. The rear sway bar is _not_ on the car, precisely because I'd
  much rather have one on the front *only*.

*** thanks for letting me vent ***

Subject: Average/Typical MPG for 1973 911T w/ MFI

I purchased my 911 approximately 6 months ago.  Mechanically it was in
good shape so when I checked my MPG for the first couple of tanks I was
surprised to find that I was getting 10 - 12 MPG.

Since then I have had a major engine service completed and replaced the 
aftermarket (i.e. L-O-U-D) muffler with an OEM style one, however I am still
getting around 12MPG.

One variation to my car is that the engine was modfied to 911S specs (head
work, cams, etc.,  but I don't think the pistons were changed).  I'm 
sure that this
is not helping the consumption any though.

Is this type of consumption normal for a T , or an S for that matter?

Subject: Wanted:  Source for 356 Flywheel Shims

Hi,
	I'm looking for a source for 356 flywheel shims.  Stoddard has
them in the standard sizes (.80mm--1.1mm?) for about $21 which wouldn't
be a big problem, but I think I need a .75mm or so.  I've heard that
it can be built up from several of the old 36 HP VW shims, but don't have
a source for these either.

	The only shim I have is too thick, so I am estimating the desired
shim by torqueing down the gland nut with the "soft metal gasket" (no
oil seal) and measuring the endplay.  I'm getting an endplay of .035"
with no shim.  This means that a shim of .80 mm would have be a little
on snug side, with .75 to .78 being much better.

	Since I am using a slightly crinkled "soft metal gasket" and not
torquing to anywhere near the final torque, I feel that when I 
do tighten it all the way with a new gasket the clearance will only
decrease?  So, is there a source for "non-standard" sized shims?
A source for 36 HP VW shims?  A cheaper source for the standard
sized shims?  

	Thanks,

BTW, the best driving course I ever took was the Motorcylcle Safety Course.

>both fuel injected?

The performance is great.

I put an injected 2.7 in my 1971 914-6, and there are only a couple of
things you really need to do.

First, you will have to relocate the engine lid release to clear the CIS.
Second you will have to change the fuel pump to the CIS pump.

The resulting car is quick, with great low and mid-range response.

If you live in a warm climate, or are an aggressive driver, you will find
that you need to increase cooling efficiency for the 2.7. Start by swapping
pulleys around on the fan and crankshaft until you have the crnak
over-driving the fan. You might want to check out the newer fans with more
blades, as well.

Consider buying a second engine lid grille and cutting out the sheetmetal
at the rear of the engine lid, doubling the grille space. It's pretty easy.
You might also want to try putting an oil cooler up front, and a
thermostatic valve in the engine compartment.

As was said earlier, upgraded brakes are a very good idea. I put 'S'
suspension and brakes on mine. And the 6 x 16" wheels that everybody seems
to just throw away work perfectly with 205-section tires on a 914, if you
roll the lip on the rear of the rear wheelwells...

Finally, for peace of mind, I installed tensioner 'collars' to prevent
total tensioner collapse.

The whole project (except the car) cost me $4-5,000. Should be less today...

Have fun!

Subject: Metro NY AutoX, 7/22- 7/23, long

Hi Autocross Fans:

(If you are not an autocross fan, press N now, so you can get back to reading
about rude drivers, and other rec.autos like topics)

This is a short recap of the autocross held by the NY Metro PCA region.

This was a two day event. The first day was a car control clinic, with an
autocross in the afternoon. The second day was a full day autocross, where
the winners got trophy's, etc.

The car control clinic was made by laying out an autocross course, and then
splitting it up into four sections. The drivers would then work on one
section for about 1/2 an hour, and then move on to the next session. There
were 2 instructors at each session to help. 

Since I have been to two autocrosses, I am not a novice, but I still have A
LOT to learn about driving, so I was at the clinic. First was the slalom. The
cones were set at the same distance apart for entire run of 8 cones. I found
that I was usually going too fast at the end of slalom, and had a hard time
getting through the last gate. My intructor had me work in going faster
initially, and them maintaining a constant speed, and getting into a smooth
rthyme.

After slalom came the Esses. The gates were set FAR wide apart. The trick
here was to get the car turned way before the gate, so that you could go
through the gates straighter, and have more time to turn for the next gate.
My car did not want to turn. It just wanted to plow straght ahead. I started
to experiment with sudden throttle changes, to try to get the car to rotate
better, but I never did it very well.

Next up was the threshold brake section. You would accellerate in a straight
line and then have to make it through a decreasing radius left turn. The
straight was long enough to get up to redline in second gear, so you were
going pretty fast. My car has ABS brakes, so I the braking part was simple. I
had a lot of fun drifting the car around the turn. When I could see the exit,
I could get the car straight, and then power out if the turn. I was at a good
part of the powerband, and the power would really stick the back wheels.

The last section was a skid pad. I have never driven on a skid pad before,
and I probably learned more about car control in that than in any other
section. You could quickly and easily see how changing one car input
(throttle on / off, steering in / out) would affect the car.

A few notes:
I was having a hard time getting my car (89 944 Turbo S) to turn in. It was
pushing in every turn. One of the instructors said that I could get the car
to turn in better by loosening the front shocks (adjustable Koni's). I make a
small adjustment, and the car would turn much better. The car was better
balanced, and I could get oversteer if I wanted it. My car was not very well
suited for the course. The entire course was taken in second gear, but the
rpm's were too low, and the straights too short to allow the turbo to provide
much boost. 

There were two guys there with new 993 C4 Cabriolet's. They were very nice
guys, but did not have clue on how to drive. I give them credit for coming
out and trying to learn. one guy listened to the isntructors, and seemed to
get the hang of it. The other guy either wouldn't / couldn't listen, and
never did get it. Beautiful cars!

In the afternoon autox, I came in first in my class, and second overall (the
instructors did not drive). I was really looking forward to Sunday.

On sunday, there were about 50 cars, 30 Porsches, 20 non Porsche. The course
was mostly the same. The major changes were that the slalom cones got more
spaced out, the high speed straight had a lane change added, and the skidpad
was removed. The lane change in the high speed section really killed me.
Without it, I could power out of the previous turn, and have full boost the
entire length of the straight. With the lane change, I had to get the car
over to the right before the lane change, so that I could take the lane
change straighter. If I stayed on the throttle long enough to get full boost,
I just ended up spinning the rear wheels and getting pretty sideways. Fun,
but not fast.

I walked the course twice, and I thought I picked up some ideas. During the
autoX my times were OK, but there were a LOT better drivers than the day
before. I am amazed at the difference between a really good driver, and an
average driver. All of the good drivers were 5-10 seconds faster than the
rest of the drivers. The times were in the range of 61-63 for the good
drivers, and 69-75+ for the rest. All of the good drivers had either Comp T/A
R1, or Yoko A008 tires. I know the tires make a difference, but I can't
believe it is that much of a difference.

I came in second in my class, about 6 seconds behind the class winner. I
don't feel too bad because he is an instructor for NNJR, and was driving a
944 S2, with Comp T/A R1, full harness, etc. No doubt about it, he is in a
different driving league than I am. 

There are a few things that are causing me some problems. I was able to cut
my time over three seconds from my first run to my last run, but I did it by
driving harder / better. Except for a few obvious things like which way to
enter the slamon, and which way to enter a lane change, I never did recognize
when one line would be better than another. I know that I need more
experience, but my times could change so much due to other things that I know
it's going to take a long time before I can determine which lime is better.

I had originally wanted to make a post about how various lines were better in
various turns, but I never could tell. Oh well.

The next Metro NY Autocross is Aug 20. I'll be there!

Greetings!

New to the list (actually, been reading for a few weeks).  Starting a low-key
(haven't convinced the wyf of the *need*--she understands the *want*) search
for an '87 or '88 Carrera coupe.  (No Unka' Bart--I'm not abandoning the

What I've done
1.  read the faq
2.  been referred to a P-car mechanic (swires, bellevue, wa);  need a
recommendation in the bay area (my search will be seattle or sf bay area)

What I need (besides the solution to domestic harmony on P-cars)
1.  suggestions/comments/practical experience w/ a search and how to keep
sane
2.  same, for these specific cars--what should i watch for?
3.  where can i get a list of options available on these cars?  per the faq,
earlier 
years were available in standard and sport models.  same in '87 or '88?
 what's
the difference?  any options to avoid?  any must-have options?

Finally, in the spirit of contributing  (my 2 pennies, or PMFI):
what's too low rpm?  Two "seat of the pants" techniques I've followed.  
First, if you can better _maintain_ speed in say, 3rd gear than 4th, 
you're lugging.  Put another way, if you have to use more throttle in
4th gear than in 3rd gear, use 3rd.
Second, if when you use more throttle, you get no (or minimal) acceleration,
again, shift down.  These rules of thumb are discussed extensively in trailer
towing (small boat, for me).  Also, as guidelines, they take into account the
current situation (load, speed, etc), instead of blindly following a minimum
rpm level (altho that usually works fine).

Have done it. It's a nice conversion, if well done. But doing it is a
major pain in the ass...  Doing a 3.2 swap is an even bigger pain, though
so it's all relative.

Is your car a '73 or a '73.5? If the latter, with CIS, it's easier. IF
not, then well... Actually, I would be very tempted to swap a 3.0 long
block in under a set of 2.4 MFI and get the space cam recut. *THAT* could
be very interesting.

Hello Porsche Friends,

I have a friend who is interested in purchasing a 944 and he asked me to milk
you all for some information.  Here are a couple of questions.

1. What years are desired?
2. What years should he avoided?
3. What type of things should he look out for.
4. What would be some bonus buys, options to look out for etc.?

Subject: MPH to KM speedo trade,...anyone?

Hi,

Is there a porschphile out there with a KM speedometer that would like to trade it against a MPH speedo??

It must be the type as used in early 911's.

I have a 150 MPH speedo. (..maybe 130? Definitely no 90 speedo!)

Not perfect, no scratches, a bit dull though, but work very well.

Well, Stoddard is the mother ship for all such parts...

Based on your description, I'd say you need to pull out the spec book and
check dimensions on the flywheel and the crank. That should be instructive.
I'd bet that something is off-spec...

If it's NOT then you have a problem.

I have no idea where to get thinner shims, but would be inclined to take 
a 1.0 mm and machine it down. I would prefer to use Porsche shim cut
down than something I didn't know what was... 36HP VW parts? Try
Gene Berg or Vintage Parts Inc (818-848-2833). VPI is the only place that
routinely advertises 36HP stuff, but Gene has or knows where to get

Wish I could meet you in Seattle, but I don't go there anymore (used to
have a business contact there). I am not sure if you know the town, but I
thought I would reccommend a couple of diversions.

1.  Go to Schillshole (sp?) and eat at either Anthony's Home Port or Ray's
Boathouse.  The seafood is great.  Nice view, not too expensive.  If you
can get halibut cheeks, they are pretty terrific.

2.  Over in Bellville, just across the water to the east, is Jake
O'Shanessy's pub with about 50 microbrews on draft and some of the
nicest, best looking wai........servers I ever had the pleasure of being
drunk with.

3. To continue on that theme,  Chateau St. Michelle has a winery tour on
demand just north of Bellville.  The best part is the end where you sit and
get a few glasses pro bono.  Across the street from St Michelle is
Columbia wines which is not as much to look at but great tastings.

If you know all of this, I apologize for the fool I am.  It is risky asking for
help in a strange town, lest you end up at Bertha's Kareoke.

>2. What years should he avoided?

Have not heard that any are absolutely terrible. I understand that the pre-
85 models have a problem with the location of the heater valve (over
the clutch) that eventually leaks and causes the failure of the clutch.
Corrected in later models. Also, earlier models basically used the 924
interior components. Later ones are much nicer.

>3. What type of things should he look out for.

Make sure to get the 2.7L engine (earlier ones had a 2.5). Pay particular
attention to camshaft and balance shaft belts, when they were replaced.
Check on when the water pump was replaced (if ever).

>4. What would be some bonus buys, options to look out for etc.?

ABS, 16" Wheels, Sport Seats. No matter what, make sure the previous

Ashley,

Get this fixed soon! Mine was like that and then failed completely
and suddenly at the track almost overheating my engine. Noticing
how my new thermostat works, a sign I saw during winter was that
the temp gauge registered below the normal range. My new one will
not register below the normal range once the engine is up to operating

          One reference that I just thought of that I find a great

          Stoddard used to sell the hard copy of the 1978-1982 911
          manual for about $90.

          It's about 3" thick, and a great reference when you're
          trying to figure out how something comes apart, not to
          mention when you need the part number for some innocuous
          little washer.  Many of the numbers have been superceded,
          but Stoddards has always been able to cross-reference with
          no problem.

          BTW, the quality of the printing is excellent.

We had something similar happen to my dad and I when we were traveling
in a 1-ton (loaded) pickup.  We had no choice but to destroy the rear of
the car in front of us, since a 5000+lb truck stops considerably slower
than any car that I know of.  The truck had a scratch in the paint!
I guess we learned our lesson!:)  Additionaly, the accident was 
determined to be their fault.   Getting full on your brakes right in 
front of a truck is pretty stupid and someplaces is considered 
reckless.  Also, minimum speed on most rural interstates is posted
at 45 mph.  Being below that for a nonemergency situation is illegal.
Thought I'd head off the discussion before it got started on why it
wasn't considered our fault.

Porsche content:  I do get a bit testy about having someone on my butt
when I'm in the Porsche.  I know that I can outbrake just about anything
on the road.  I hate the thought of having to brake for an emergency with
someone close behind me.  If possible I move to another lane or leave
them.  If I can't do either of those, I usually tap my brakes lightly
to let them know how close they are.  Incidentally, for the same reason
I feel comfortable travelling closer to someone in the Porsche than
I do in other vehicles.

The newer the better is always a good rule.  The 85.5+ cars
had the updated interior.  This is neither good nor bad, just
different.  The big advantage is that the later cars (85.5+?)
have the improved suspension with the aluminum control arms.
Of course, this is much more expensive to fix and is only 
an advantage in a competition situation.  I thing the early
944s get a bad rap.  They have the same performance as the later
cars and are generally much cheaper.

The '89 model is the only one to use the 2.7L engine.  All other 944s

ABS is only available in '87+ cars.  Most US 944s are fairly loaded.
The options you want will be much more dependant on your intent for 
the car than anything else.  Is it going to be a sunnyday cruiser, a

It increases the load on the engine and therefore the consumption of fuel/air
increases.  It is like going up a hill:  the only way to maintain your
current speed is to give the car wider throttle, since the engine has to work
harder to get itself up the hill.

The same would be true for fully-loaded, trailer-toting pickups: the more
you pull/load the lower your effective MPG.

When you engage your A/C, you cause your compressor to do work (normally it is
idling).  The compressor must compress the gas in your A/C unit.  To do this
requires work (energy) and that is a load on your engine.  Now your engine
must power the compressor as well as make you go.  The addition load on an
engine usually translates into about 2 miles less per gal.

Subject:       911 heating/body harware

Hello all,

First of all, I tried the waxing with baking soda -waste of time.  
Didn't get rid of any swirl marks.  Made things worse in places.

I have two questions:

1.  I have a problem with the interior heating of my 1980 SC.  I know 
the blower motor just burnt out 'cause I smelt it.  It used to run 
but now it doesn't and the fuses are all okay.  Anyway, the heating 
wasn't working even before the motor went.  I'm talking about the 
blower under the hood not the one in the engine compartment that 
routes the air to the heat exchangers.  I used to get cool air from 
the defrosters but not the front vents.  Why?  That's my question.  
The other question is: why did I never get any hot air?  What happens 
to the warm air after it passed through the heat exchangers?  Is 
their an opening under the car or the hood that throws the hot air out 
when it is not directed through the vents to the interior of the car?

I'm trying to conceptulize how the heating system works so that I can 
trouble shoot it.   

2.  How does one remove the black metal strip that covers the 
gap between the window rubber and the fenders around the rear window 
on a 911 Targa.  I'm trying to remove it so that I can get the car 
ready for painting.  I thought I could just pull it off but that 
didn't work. I was able to just pull of the metal strips covering the 
doors and rubber on the door windows.

Subject: Re: Teaching other drivers a "lesson" 


I could not resist jumping in on this thread.  If you like to play games 
with fellow drivers, try one of these techniques.

Technique #1

Someone pulls up behind you an makes it known (in some obnoxious way) that 
he/she/it wants to pass you.  Move to the right and let them pass.  As they 
pass, accelerate to match their speed.  Follow along far enough back to be 
out of their blind spot.  Continue to match their speed.  Three out of ten 
drivers will accelerate to outrageous speeds trying to pass you.

Technique #2

If you are in the left lane and someone is blocking your efforts to pass 
try this.  Scoot over to the left just far enough to allow your left 
headlight to shine past the back of their car and onto their rearview 
mirror.  Five out of ten drivers will move left to get your headlight out 
of their rearview.  Move with them, keep that light in the mirror.  This 
gets the attention of some drivers.  In other cases, the driver is so 
thick, they will drive off onto the shoulder to keep your headlight out of 
their mirror.  (Yes, I know.  If they are on the shoulder, I am too)

The games some people play!

Subject: HELP!!!! 911 Buying Decision

     Hello All:
     
     First a warm thank you to all those who replied to my previous request 
     for help.  Here is the basic story.  I am an interested first time 911 
     buyer who has been shopping around for about 2 months for a car.  I 
     have about $15,000 to spend and would like to get a 3.0L SC.
     
     Anyway, I found a 80 911SC Targa with 114k miles on it.  No 
     maintenance records, body and interior are in very nice shape. I went 
     and got a pre-purchase inspection done on the car, and it needs about 
     $1,500 worth or repairs (about $2,000 if you include adding carerra 
     chain tensioners).  Leak down tests were good, clutch feels good, 
     however there were a few minor oil leaks and the air-conditioning 
     needs a new compressor (at least).
     
     I negotioated the guy down to 12,500 and was on my way to plunk down 
     my money when I got cold feet and held off on the deal.  Basically I 
     wanted to know if anyone could answer these questions so I would feel 
     better about a future buying decision:
     
     1) How many miles can I expect to get on a 911 3.0L engine before I 
     need a major rebuild?  By major I mean head work or new rings, etc.
     
     2) How much should I expect to pay for such work? (ie ballpark range)
     
     3) How much $$$ would a really big mileage 80 911 command?
     
     The reason I want to answer these question is two fold.  First I don't 
     mind spending money on the car, provided I can spread it out over a 
     few years (ie so long as I don't blow an engine or transmission as 
     soon as I get the car).  Secondly, if I sink big bucks into the car 
     (ie get a new engine) I hope that the resale value would allow me to 
     recoup some of the cost (not all but some)
     
     Anyway, the car is still available and I may be able to talk the price 
     down to about $11,500 since it has been on the market for about 3 
     weeks.
     
     Does anyone have any information/advice for a future Porsche owner?
     
     Thank you for your help,

I just mentioned my question to the list to my lab co-worker who informed me
that there have been studies done by consumers groups concluding that it is
BETTER on your gas mileage to use your A/C than to roll down your windows!
They say that the wind resistance caused by rolling down your windows creates
more drag on your engine than the A/C does!  Makes sense!  What do you guys

Subject: Ive been Keyed ! - A happy ending

     I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my request for suggestions 
     on repairing the scratch inflicted on my shiny white P-Car.  I was/am 
     truly amazed at the support and empathy from this group.
     
     This is how the saga ends:
     
     The day after, having parked the 911 in it's garage I showed the nose 
     to tail scratch to my two boys, (5 & 10). Needless to say, they 
     weren't happy about their favorite car getting messed up either.  
       About an hour later, my five year old comes up the stairs from 'his' 
     workshop with his white construction hat on and informs me with 
     certainty that he has 'fixed' my car!  After pushing my heart back 
     down my throat, (visions of hammers and saws dancing in my head), I 
     let him lead me down to look at his workmanship. 
        Well,... he had taken a large gum eraser from a drawing kit and 
     rubbed off about five inches of the 'scratch'!
     
        Blown away!!  It wasn't a scratch after all!  It was a pencil line 
     someone had run down the length of the car.
        If that kid got an allowance, I would have given him a raise!  
     (Instead he got the front seat for a week.) ;-}
     
     Well, that's it. Thanks for all the advice, it's in my P-Car notebook 
     now.
     
     How!e

Subject: Timing Belt Time.

  
  Well it's time to change the timing belt in my '83
  928S Euro (65K miles). I called the one of the local
  Houston dealers (Momentum Porsche) and they quoted
  me a price between $700 - $1300 depending upon whether
  I had the water pump done, what kind of shape the
  pulleys were in, and whether the factory said the
  the tensioners should be upgraded. The cost of parts 
  was something like $94 for the belt, and $160 for 
  the water pump (euroselect with an exchange), 
  maybe tensioners and pulleys (I don't know how much), 
  and coolant. Maybe you can see where I'm going with 
  this, I'm thinking of doing it myself. The shop 
  manuals, a tensioner tool, the above parts, some 
  gaskets, misc parts, and a few knuckles. I could do that.  
  As fringe benefits I could score some new tools, 
  get to get under the hood of my car, and if I'm 
  lucky I might even save a little money. I was wondering 
  though, does doing this kind work yourself adversly
  affect the value of the car (assuming the job is 
  done right) as opposed to having an card carrying 
  "expert" do it. Any words of wisdom from the 
  p-patriarches (or p-matriarches) on the list 
  would be appreciated.
  
  Thanks for any advice,

  alternatively if everyone gave me their $0.02 
  I could pay to have it done.

I think the reaction of the driver being tailgated is in direct proportion
to how nervous tailgating makes him. Look at it this way: I'm on the
freeway, doing 70, medium traffic. Cars typically hang 1-2 car lengths from
my bumper, way too short a distance if there's any trouble. If I move into
the next lane and drop back, the same thing happens again in another lane.
I have noticed there are two distinct kinds of tailgaters: aware and
unaware. The aware tailgaters want to get by, feel you're holding them up,
so they tailgate you to pressure you into moving over. Since they are
presumably aggressive drivers, they will be on the lookout for sudden
braking by you to "teach them a lesson". The unaware drivers are much more
dangerous. They fixate on the cars in front of them, oblivious of the
speed. If I had to suddenly come to a stop (traffic, animal in the road,
accident...), they would probably plow right into me.  It's these people
that should be taught a lesson. The aware drivers I get the hell out of the
way of before they have a chance to tailgate me. To teach the unaware
driver a lesson, a light touch on the brakes is all that's necessary. You
don't have to scrub off speed, but you're just giving the person a message
that they are following too closely. This is very different from dropping
40mph and swerving all over the highway.

Another trick I have used to get cars away from me is to pretend I'm drunk.
I weave the car just enough so that people notice something's wrong, and
boy do they stay away if they think you're intoxicated. I just hope I never
do this with a cop around!

I don't know about gas mileage but I do know that it certainly feels like I
have more power with the A/C off...actually quite a bit more power ( I can't

An old racing 'trick' (no secrets from P-Philes) is to hook a contact

Could work in this situation too.

Did you check any other places?  This seems very high
for a timing belt change, though I'll admit a lack of
experience with 928s.  My 951 cost ~$300 at the local
dealership for replacement of all the belts.

Just keep and file your parts receipts, and document when the
work was done.  I can't see why anyone would be bothered by 
this.  The amount of money you'll save over paying the 
dealership for repairs will more than make up for any loss
in value you could possibly suffer anyways.

Walt,
A respected Porsche body shop around these parts tells me they have done
several mirror updates for these older 911 using BMW '75-'78 5-series
mirrors.  Supposedly they look extremely like the original rectangle ones
Porsche used on the left side only, and the base contour matches the door's
curve properly.

I have ordered a pair from a local BMW dealer to see for myself.  They should
arrive in a week or so and I can let the list know of the results.  For those
interested in doing their own comparison, the BMW part numbers are:

Left side   - 51 161 822 076
Right side - 51 161 821 793

Ok, I've got how it works now.  So, if it eats so much gas why doesn't

Some of your engine's power is used to turn the A/C compressor when you turn
the A/C on. Your car will slow down slightly or you have to give it just a
little more gas to maintain the same speed.  You may also notice that the car
will not accelerate as fast when the A/C is on. The bottom line is that this
increased load on your engine (maintaining a constant rpm and speed) requires
more power (more gas-air mixture to burn) than when the A/C is off. 

Acceleration and gas mileage *MAY* be improved (YMMV) by removing the entire
A/C system. I took mine off because it weighed over 43 pounds. :) I haven't
done any empirical (sp?) tests but it *FEELS* faster, at least I keep telling
myself that as I sweat in the local traffic.

Nice car. I spent about that to get mine 6 years ago. I've spent that much
again maintaining and modifying it.(should've gotten it checked out better
before I bought it but didn't have a clue or know anyone that did)

DOH! First instinct says run away. I got bit by this.

Were the oil leaks included in the $2000 price for repairs? I have a leak
between the timing chain housing and the rest of the case. Fixing it involves
removing it, replacing the gasket, and then re-timing the cam(not sure about
this)? Maybe about $300 including parts for someone else to do it. Moral is
some small things are expensive to fix.

In his book (well worth owning by the way) Bruce Anderson said he had seen SC
engines last 300,000 to 400,000 miles with proper maintainence. What kind of
maintainence did this car have? Mine lasted from 95,000 to 125,000 miles
before it went completely South.

Not sure. I have seen them from $7000-24,000 It all boils down to condition
and all you can do is look at how the car is now and how it has been cared
for. If it's missing the records you are missing half the information and
have a 50/50 shot at best. If you have to have the car get it, spend money on
it, and drive it, and don't worry about it, but if you take your time and
don't get in a rush, you may be able to get a car that will cost much less
money down the road. You'll also have a higher resale value when you get
ready to sell.
     
>     Does anyone have any information/advice for a future Porsche owner?

Don't let me dissuade you from this car. It is your money and I haven't even
seen the car.Even if I had this would still only be an opinion. I bought mine
without the proper knowledge and it has cost me much money to get a nice car.
I could have done it cheaper by buying a more expensive car. I'd be happy to
relate more details directly if you like.

That doesn't help - then you just have to burn more gas to produce the
electricity to run the A/C.  Except now you've added two more steps, the
alternator and electric motor, with losses in each of them, so the whole
process will be less efficient and use even more gas.  Turning on your
radio is also reducing your gas mileage, although it's really
insignificant.  It uses multiple orders of magnitude less power than the
A/C.

According to my CHP (calif hwy patrol) friends this is a prime example of

When they investigae any rear end accident they try and detirmine if in fact
the first driver had to slam on their brakes. So watch out if you are caught

It's simple -- it's one more thing taking the engine's power away from 
propelling the car.  It's most noticable on the four-cylinder Porsche's

I have seen this study, too.  I believe the magic number is around 45-47 
mph, where the wind resistance offered by the open windows actually 
consumes more energy than rolling up the windows and turning the AC on.  
Certainly, around town, it is much more economical to roll down the windows.

I've got a stereo system that draws between 80 and 90 Amps at full volume
and have never noticed that power drop from my engine the way turning on the

I would say that, if it is done correctly, it shouldn't affect your value 
adversly.  Make sure that you keep ALL THE RECEIPTS for parts you put on 
the car, but assuming that you do, not many people are scared off by a 
knowledgable owner/enthusiast.  I've found, in both buying and selling my 
p-cars, that being an enthusiast makes the deal feel that much better -- 
someone who so obviously cares about his vehicle wouldn't neglect it.

Subject: Timing Belt Time.


I did a belt and water pump on an 82, US 928 a few years ago.
First thing I did was I found someone selling the shop manuals
used for $150.  Great deal.  That gave me the knowledge and
confidence to tackle the job.  As I remember, the thing I
fretted over the most was removing the crank pulley bolt.
That sucker was ON there.  I used a half-inch breaker bar
and a LONG piece of pipe and finally pushed with everything I
had and it came loose.  I was afraid maybe the thing was
reverse threaded.  It wasn't.  Once I knew that, I went for it.
When I put the belt on, I got one of the cams off by a tooth,
so I had to loosen the belt, remove the valve covers, and
"slip" the belt by hand on that one side.  That was better than
taking the whole thing apart again.  Good luck.  The hard
part is getting the timing back in place with the new belt.
The marks on the cams don't both line up exactly at the same time.
The shop manual tells you (sorta) how they should look (I still got
it wrong, tho.).  The "books" say it is an 8hr. job.  Took me only
12.  Not bad.

So you have about a 1000W amp in your car?  Even that wouldn't normally
come at all close to drawing that kind of average current, even at full
volume, unless it's a class A amp.

Anyway, if you're serious about that kind of current, yes, you could run an
A/C on that.  But to supply it you're going to need a bigger alternator,
and it is going to make a noticeable difference in mileage.

Subject: C and SC


To those of use that started in OLD Porsches, the term  "C" refered to
356C model and "SC" refered to a "C" model with the "SUPER" or 90+ HP 
engine to the "C" NORMAL's 65-75Hp. You did pay extra for the priviledge.

As marketeer's get their hands on things to sell cars, the name became 
911S for "SUPER" or later "SPORT". There was the first 911 "CARERRA" in
1974. The 911 "SC" was never really defined, yet the ad copy hinted back to the "tradition" started by the 356SC. They were always 911s, no 
matter what the factory tried to call them. 

These days, the C is typically thought of as "CARERRA" irrespective of 
model designation.

A group in Australia did a study on this several years ago.  They also
tested with and without air deflectors around the windows.  Results:

With A/C off, windows rolled gave the best mileage.
     A/C on,  Windows up
     A/C off, Windows down, with deflectors
     A/C off, Windows down, no deflectors gave the worst mileage.

That was then.  A/C units have gotten better (at least the pre-R12
units), and cars more streamlined.  I think you'ld see even more
of a difference today.

The answer is to use solar cells because on the days you need AC there is
probably enough sun to be collected, that way you dont drain on the engine
or the battery.  You should also have a capacitor or a small battery to
store some of the suns energy if the clouds cover the sun

Sean,

Energy is energy.....whether from a belt driven compressor or an 
electrically driven device. I suspect that an electrically driven 
compressor would take an excessive amount of power (as my home A/C does 
in the summer compared to electric use in winter) and the battery 
requirements (weight, charge, etc) would obviate the gains of not loading 
the engine. BTW: Is your concern MPG or loss of power in driving?

90 *Amps*?

Are you sure you don't mean 90 *watts*?

If your stereo drew 90 amps, you'd be hooking it up using heavy duty
jumper cables.

You claim your stereo *draws* 90 Amps. *90 Amps* at 12 volts is 1080 watts,
which is about 1.5 H.P.

Hope you have some pretty thick cables (say, 6-gauge copper) going to power
your stereo or your car will catch fire just after you melt your ears.

Sounds a little over-kill for Bach, but I don't know what you listen too.

Subject: 911T engine ground strap?????

My 73.5 911T (CIS) has been running kind of rough lately - annoying surging
~2500-3000rpm in any gear.  The surging matches some sympathetic frequency
that makes the engine rock from side to side, or something equally annoying.

I've put in new Bosch platinum plugs, but haven't checked the cap/rotor yet.

But, other interesting and possibly-related symptoms include:

Oil temp gauge is shaky, +/- 10lb.
Tach occasionally drops to zero, then back up to correct rpm.
Oil level gauge is all over the place (VIOLENTLY up/down full-scale at 
   2000-4000 rpm).

I've thought, "could all four of these symptoms be a manifestation of the
same problem?"  If so, the only thing I can think of is the engine ground
strap.  If so, where is it?  I haven't spent much time underneath the car
yet.

If not the ground strap, then ??????

It's certainly not much compared to what the engine can produce.  But it's
a significant portion of the average power used to drive around, and so
a significant difference in mileage.  I seem to remember something like
20-30hp being quoted as average power requirements for a car.  Of course a
1000 watt stereo, unless it's class A, will in practice use a *lot* less
than 1000 watts.

> A real auto air conditioner takes a lot more power than that.

Do they?  You can get room air conditioners that plug into a standard 15A,
117V socket, so they can't be taking more than 1750 watts.  I'd expect a car
air conditioner to be smaller than that, but then I don't actually know.
Although, if you believe the numbers above, and the 2mpg difference someone
else mentioned when using air conditioning, and assume average mileage
is 20-30 mpg (to make the arithmetic trivial), that would correspond to
2hp for the A/C.

Anyway, the tire didn't want to get inflated, I inspected it
more closely and found a rip, about 3-4 cm (about 1.5 inches)
long. I took the tire to a tire dealer and asked what they could do.

They said that it couldn't be repaired, the rip was to long,
and the tire was a dealer only item.

I went to the dealer who checked what a new tire would cost me,
they told me $523 !!! *choke*
This is for a tire that's never been used and maybe never will be.
The tire currently a Wredestein is for my C2.

Doing a 928 timing belt is not all that difficult, it just takes lots of
time. You must take everything off the front of the engine. And "while
you're in there" you will want to replace the water pump because it is
so much work getting to it.

Besides, your basic tools, you'll need a flywheel lock (~$35) and the
tensioner tool (~$400). See if you can borrow these.

Zims sells the belts for about $50, and you can get the waterpump from
Jay Pineau (713)251-2222 for $150, exchange.

I think I spent around $350 for parts (the incidentals add up).

Subject: Average/Typical MPG for 1973 911T w/ MFI

Harvey,

If you have MFI, you do not have a 73.5 CIS car. I'm going to assume your 73 
is very simialr to the '72 2.4 L MFI car. In my collection of early road tests 
I found ('72) 2.4L Ts got 15-18 mpg, Es got 15-18 mpg and Ss got 14-17 mpg. 
While the low S numbers are close to your milage, I think you are right in 
showing concern. Of courser, the engine mods could be solely responsible for 
your observed 10-12 mpg. How much highway (65 mph) driving do you do?

Unless you are driving your car with great vigor I suspect your MFI may be 
running too rich. This could mean the unit and air stacks need to be adjusted/
aligned. Running rich is a common sign of a worn MFI unit (been there - done 
that!), trouble with the cold start solenoid, or, as has been recently 
discussed, improper temperature input to the MFI (bad heat exchanger or 
disfunctional duct work).

Needless to say, there could be any number of other causes for poor fuel 
economy as well. 

Best wishes for getting this resolved.

First of all, the price is irrelevant.  Any radar detector is far 
cheaper than the additional insurance charges of a ticket spread over 
three years.

As far as detectors go, every test review I have recently seen rates the
 Valentine One Radar Locator as head and shoulders above everything 
else.  Integrated Laser, multiple bogey tracking and a remote display 
are some of its trick features.  I have two of these and as Karl Maulden
 would say: "Don't leave home without it."  I bought my first one when 
they first came out in '92.  Bought my wife one for her new Chrysler 
Cirrus, and I'm getting ready to order a third so I don't have to 
shuffle mine from my Pickup to my P-car.  I have a major leadfoot (It's 
the lonnnngggg pedal on the right) and, thanks to my Valentine One, a 
safe driver discount from State Farm.

Mike Valentine (company owner), was the technical wizard behind the 
original Escort from Cincinnati Microwave.   He sold out his half of CM 
to his partner (business school dweeb) and went off and did work for the
 military until '88.  He then brought the "G-Analyst" to market
while starting development work on what is now the Valentine One.

I think the companies phone number is 1-800-331-3030.  The radar locator
 is $329, $399 with built in Laser.  The remote display is an additional
 $69 and it will keep those detector bunnies of your donkey so that you 
I don't have to "teach 'em a lesson"!  :<)  It isn't cheap, but the best
 never is.  Of course Porsche owners know this already.  Oh yeah, if you
 happen to live where detectors are still illegal, the Valentine One is 
undetectable by a VC2 detector detector.

Try "Mothers" leather conditioner. I just used it on my drying-out leather
interior, and the difference was incredible. After 2 applications, the
leather softened up beautifully and the "dry lines" disappeared.

It has a peculiar smell, but that goes away in a couple of days.

For vinyl/plastic interior bits, ArmorAll makes a "low-gloss" that does
quite a good job. It leaves the dash top and whatnot looking clean but
without that artificial looking ArmorAll shininess, it looks almost like
buffed leather.

Here we go, DO NOT USE ARMORALL on your porsche or anything else for the
matter. Try to stay away form silicone stuff on vinyl. There are many good
vinyl conditions that do not contain silcone. 

These conditioners will not be found in the normal places in fact I ordered
mine from Car Care Specialties 201-796-8300, IE Larry Reynolds.(He is also a
list contributor) They work much better than the silicone stuff and also do
not give you the "satin sheet" effect while driving down the road.

Also Larry has an excellent leather treatment and it works I used on my 74
carrera and it brought back the leather smell as well softner and protects
the leather from uv rays.

The advice you've gotten thus far is very good (i.e., get the latest model
year you can afford, 85 1/2 and later). But, if you run across a
low-mileage 1986 944 Turbo (951), it's a pretty good car but you'll want to
make sure the previous owner(s) took advantage of the "campaigns" (updates)
Porsche offered during the warranty period.

Campaigns included:
1) water pump
2) exhaust system
3) motor mount
4) clutch

There may be others as well, but these four alone account for over $3,000
in parts. If not documented with receipts, then discount the purchase

Jim, you've got this all messed up, probably because of your tender years.

For the 1956 model year, the 356A came with two 1600cc engines: the NORMAL
(60 DIN) and the SUPER  (75 DIN). Beginning with the 1960 model year,
Porsche continued to equip the 356B with the NORMAL and SUPER engines, and
added the SUPER 90, so named because the engine put out 90 DIN horse power.
For the 1964 model year the 356B gave way to the 356C, the NORMAL engine
was dropped, the SUPER engine redesignated as the C, and the SUPER 90
redesignated as the SC with 95 DIN.

With respect to the 911, the "S" designation referred to "Sawing," which is
what the driver had to do with the steering wheel to keep the rear of the
car rearward during vigorous cornering. :<)

but that didn't exlplain the leak into the passenger compartment.  Under the
battery I found a hole in the metal about the size of a pea.  Water would
build up because of the plugged drains and was pouring thruogh the hole!  I
took some JB weld and plugged the leak, sanded it down and painted it.

Subject: Insight needed for CV Boot replacement Please.

Hello Again,

Tonight I plan to replace the dust boot on my 1989 911 SC.  Its the one the
protects the baring that go from the drive shaft to the Trans.  I purchased a
new boot that has the flange attached to it and was told the procedure for
replacing these CV boots is quite simple.  Do any o you have any insight that
might be helpful to me?

I am a bit mechanically inclined and have an OK selection of tools,  are
there any special tools I should consider purchasing before I start the job.

What CV grease would you use if this was your porsche.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated,  thank you.

Regards,

Subject: Re: General Question

In the good ol' fifties, they figured a race car would end up weighing four
times the weight of the engine.  That's good logic if you think about it.  

If it takes 1000 pounds of batteries to replace a 200 pound engine and 60
pounds of gas, you're on the back side of the power curve, so to speak.

Like the guy with his electric A/C, there ain't no free lunch.  The energy
you pump into those batteries has to come from somewhere, and there's no
guarantee that PGE (Public Graft & Extortion) or your local power provider
can be enough more efficient than your aircooled  recip engine to ever give a
return for hauling those heavy batteries.

People involved in airplanes understand what it costs to carry a pound.  It
costs $25 per year in fuel to carry every extra pound in an airliner.

Subject: Loctite Query

First off, I promise not to use loctite on Porsche fuel injection fittings.

Does anyone have info on the correct loctite thread locker to use in
a gasoline environment?  One of the lead plugs fell out of my Weber
40 IDFs so I tapped it for a setscrew and secured it with Hydraulic
Loctite.  I've used the hydraulic loctite before on oil pressure sending
units (non-Porsche) with apparently good results.  I've never used it
to seal a gasoline exposed part and am a little anxious about it.

I use 271, 272, and 222 all the time but have never seen a good
application guide that covers all the loctite products.  Does anyone
have information concerning specifications or possibly a URL for
a loctite homepage on the web?

I was promised this information from a loctite distributor months
ago and am still waiting.

Larry, isn't the "Super 90 redesignated as the SC" statement a huge

I mean they had very little in common? The SC engine was much more a
hot C engine with Alloy cylinders (nikasil?) a hotter camshaft, other
carburettors (maybe just the jets?), counterweighed crank, bigger

I watched an interesting program about the Beetle's history on
Discovery yesterday.

It was a story about hard work and success. the Beetle (and Volskwagen
Werke) was actually the cornerstone in rebuillding Germany after the
second WW. 

They showed parts of the promotion films from the early 50, and they
showed a car climbing the Alps without effort, where Humbers, Jags, US
iron, and other water cooled cars stood alongside the road with that
familiar cooked radiator. The promotion showed the Beetle taking
*horrible* passes up those roads,...meeting cars etc had to drive out
on the gravel!! (...what were they thinking of????  :)

Another funny part was signs reading something like 'feel free to fill
up your radiator'  alongside the small 'rivers' along the
roads, and buckets hung onto the pole, so that they could be
used to fill water on the radiator.

They actually mentioned the Porsche Sportcoupe to be the only car to
have the same attributes, for good or worse.

Certainly in his wildest dreams (how wild can they go?) Hitler could
not have guessed that he would contribute in  rebuillding the German
economy,...after first trashing it by a devastating war. (among *much*
crueler merits!)

That's a nasty story, but perhaps the tailgater should have been more aware
of the potential for such behavior before he risked the lives of his
family. I have thought about the culpability of slamming on the brakes, and
I assumed this was one case where "the driver behind is always at fault"
does not hold true. But it seems to me to be a simple matter of saying that
you saw an animal dart in front of your car, as there is no way to disprove
this. Nobody else needs to have seen the animal, and no such animal needs
to have existed. Mind you, I'm not advocating this, I just like to think
about all the angles.

Satyan,

Also check the "blower bay" under the hood. around the relay box and 
the battery are drain channels that can get clogged and the backup 
water will overflow into the blower housing and leak onto the inside 
floor area. You say it hasn't rained but this is probably from washing

Hi P-dudes:

I recently acquired an original 1980 911sc and was wondering if I have
the so called Sport Option.  This was mentioned on the FAQ listing as
one of the options.   I have the window sticker that lists an Option Group
F26.  What does this include?  I have read somewhere that the Option
Group F25 includes: fog lights, alloys, P7s, sport shocks and RH mirror. 
Since, most of the options are obvious, I am more interested to know if I
have the Sport Shocks.  Peeking under the car, the shock bodies are
green, which I understand are the Bilsteins.  If I have the Normal shocks,
what color would they be and what brand? (Sachs or Boge)

One other question is: I have the 85 MPH speedo and I was wondering
what are my options on getting a 150 MPH speedo.  Better if there is a
stock one that can just be exchanged.

Subject: for sale: radar detector (Escort DSP)


Well, I've learned the hard way that a local police department
around here is now using Stalker radar (Ka band).  My venerable
Escort DSP is only X and K, so I'm selling it to upgrade.

If you live in an area that only uses X and K and need a spare
detector, or perhaps a detector for the daily driver, this is
the unit to have.

The Escort DSP is an extremely sensitive unit - it uses the
Motorola 56001 digital signal processor.  I think it runs at
10 MIPS, constantly analyzing incoming signals for police
radar.

It's a high quality unit, black steel case, leather pouch,
rubberized on/volume knob.  Controls are cleanly laid out.
Beeps (X) and braps (K) sound clear, not like the cheap video
game that some of those plastic detectors sound like.
It has all the standard features: highway/city, mute, auto-mute, 
dark mode.

Perhaps the coolest feature is the built-in security.  Every
150 hours of driving the detector shuts off.  It's permanently
disabled until you slide the "digital key" into the earphone
jack in the rear, enabling you for another 150 hours.  So, if
a thief takes it, it will do him no good when the thing shuts
down.  A "return postage guaranteed label" ensures return of
the detector.

Asking $125/OBO.

I've had it for 7 years, and it's always been about that; it seems

Subject: Following Too Closely


This current thread on the rudeness of many drivers is getting pretty 
grim. Fact is, there are far too many dickweeds out there for all Porsche
owners to deal with. 

It is extremely difficult to tell who has common sense on the road. A 
neighbor lady who is quite charming and fun to hang around with is a 
terrible driver. As she puts it, "I hate cars." She drives an Explorer
with very little awareness. I have seen her scatter fellow commuters as 
she applies makeup or pulls up her phone. So what do you do? She waves 
each time I pass her on hte road, whether shes's on the phone or not.


There's at least 5 million more drivers like Loretta, male and female,
cruising the highways of California. I hope I do not have to meet them 
while driving. 

Just try to stay away from them. Drive offensively when possible, use
a warp factor that precludes them from getting too close or routes that
avoid the problem. Remember, eventually the odds will get them. Loretta
has trashed her Explorer twice.

Subject: HELP!!!!! Should I fear the 2.7L?

     Hello All:
     
     I have been shopping for a used 911 and I have been looking at 3.0L 
     SCs primarily.  I have been having little success in searching for 
     3.0L that seem to fit into my price range and requirements.
     
     As a result I have also been searching at 76-79 911.  I have read and 
     seen alot about the problems with the 2.7L engines.  
     
     *Should I shy away from a 911 with a 2.7L engine?
     
     *What are the necessary mods to a 2.7L to increase its life?
     
     *If someone has done all of the recommended mods (ie 11-blade fan, new 
     studs for the heads, larger oil coller, carerra tensioners) how many 
     miles (ie how robust) is the 2.7L
     
     All the information I have received so far from this group has been 
     excellent.  Thank you all for your input.  I really appreciate the 
     help.

  Completely reseamsealed and painted
  Red, slightly darker than Guards Red
 - Interior, light gray with dark red dash & custom console, with
  built in high speed fan for extra cooling, professionally stitched 
  marine grade vinyl
 - All suspension components powder coated
  all new ball joints, bushings, bearings, etc.
  new Bilsteins, 110 LBS strings, 20.5 mm H&H front swaybar
 - Calipers rebuilt, new SS brakelines, new 19mm Master Cyl
 - Tank powder coated
 - Wiper, Headlight, front blower motors rebuilt
 - Wiring cleaned and wire loomed

    That's probably because they are used to being challenged, and are
nice enough not to get rubber all over the front of your car ;)
    Oddest "challenge" I ever had - about 3 yrs. ago I was driving home
from work in the TowTruckFromHell (tm) at about 60 MPH (in a 45 zone,
twisty country road) when i notice a new 300ZX so close I could barely
see his headlights.  I'll bet he was shocked when i started pulling away
in the twisty bits!  That's what an extra 100HP and knowing the road
will do for ya... (apparently he was too close to me to see the dual
2.5" pipes...)
    Never woulda tried that against a good ol' boy in a musclecar, though...

Subject: improvements to a 71 911T

Dear Porschephiles,

I just bought my first Porsche two days ago and ,
as the subject would imply, it is a 1971 911T
Targa and its so cool.  However there are some
things I'd like to change about it and after two
days of this list I am having trouble deciding
what is more important- authenticity or
practicality.

I'd like to add the auto-retracting seatbelts for
convenience and some sport seats with greater
support from a later model.  I want to add my CD
player but don't want to cut up the dash and dont
know where to add speakers.  I'd like bigger
wheels and tires and maybe a sway bar or two.

Would these kind of modifications ruin the value
of this cool car?

Also, I am planning on using this car as a daily
driver and my sole means of transportation- until
winter if i buy a 4x4.  Is this prudent or had I
better make plans to be in the shop alot?

Any comments would be appreciated.

If you're not going to clean and repack the joint, it is simple.  Remove
the four bolts holding the joint to the stub axle.  Remove the snap ring
retaining the joint to the half shaft.  Remove and replace the torn boot.
Reinstall with a fresh gasket.  On cars with four (vs. six) bolts, use a
dab of red Loctite on the bolts.  Torque to spec.

Before removing the bolts, clean out their socket recesses.  Make sure
you get full engagement of the socket bit before twisting.  They really
crud up, and it's easy (well, for me at least!) to yutz the bolt head.

>I am a bit mechanically inclined and have an OK selection of tools,  are

You'll need the right socket bit to get the CV bolts off, either an allen
or triple-square.  I think you car uses allen head bolts.  You'll also
need the right snap ring pliers to get the snap ring off the half shaft.
I think on your car you have a pretty standard external snap-ring.  Some
Porsches have a chamfered design to their snap rings, which requires a
special set of pliers available from Snap-On.

>What CV grease would you use if this was your porsche.

For street use, any good name brand MoS2-based grease will be fine.  Bruce
Anderson is a big fan of Swepco's products in general and has recommended
their grease for CV applications.  I've used it and it's fine.

Just thinking out loud here....   Yes, I have seen a 914 motor in
a 912.  Didn't look at it too close, but I know that the person
who did it is pretty "creative".

$1K for the whole thing?  Did you ever think about selling the
2.0 motor and using the money for a "proper" motor for the car?

I can think of at least one person who would be interested in a
914-2.0 motor.  :)

I believe that the vacuum motors are controlled by a couple of 
small electric valves under the dash.

I suspected I was given bad info since I couldn't find a 5-series on the road
that looked right (they all looked black).  But the body shop was adamant.  I
am now wondering if I haven't been given the wrong BMW model and year.  I
passed an early 2002 on the highway the other day and it looked similar (but
it was just a fleeting moment).  I also saw an old 6-series from afar that

Does anyone have an early BMW with chrome mirrors, especially a 1600 or 2002?

Subject: Re: 951 Air Recircultaion


Howdy

This is control path for recirculation flappers:
vacuum from port at brake booster enters plastic line and goes through
firewall.
Behind dash just to left of glovebox door one of two electo-pneumatic valves
sends the vacuum back through firewall to the flapper valves.
An electic signal is sent to valves from the AC control switch.
Valve is normally off so you get no recirculation, and the other is normally 
off so you always get hot water flow in heater system.

THe electro=pneumo swithces can be seen best if you remove the glove box.
If the heater valve suts off you know that the valves are getting 
vaccuum, and the flapper shuld also sut (unless jamed from rust/debris).

Sure, Trond, Porsche made a few improvements with the SC like the
counter-balanced cankshaft with different mains (the S-90 went through main
bearings regularly), but probably the higher compression (9.5:1 versus 9:1)
and better breathing (intake and exhaust ports were different) accounted
for the 5 more hp (DIN) of the SC over the S-90. Both engines used the same
alloy ferral-coated barrels, the same Solex 40 PII-4 carburetor, and the
same camshaft. So, I don't think "redesignated" is a "huge" shortcut. Maybe
a tiny one, but for most P'philers, it's fine since they'd flunk a
flash-card test of 356 models anyway.

Henry Elfrink Manual (Fourth Edition, 1968) gives a detailed comparison of
both engines. Elfrink has always been THE BIBLE for me ever since I picked

Subject:      Following too --- vs.  Road Manners

Perhaps I've been living rural Vermont too long, but I'd like to extend on Jim
Pasha's latest on this topic.  We have our rude folks here too, but it goes for
BOTH sides.  I once saw a white Mercedes "crowding" a farmer on his tractor on
Rt 100 (a rural two lane through the center of the state) til the farmer pulled
over towards the shoulder so he could pass.  As the Mercedes was going by the
farmer turned on the PO driver to the MANURE SPREADER and the the Mercedes a
real (not totally undeserved) present.  On the other hand I too have been the
object of contempt from the joker who wouldn't let me pass or back in while
there was a semi in the oncoming lane.  And the stories can go on and on.

I suspect however that many of us miss the point that "basic road courtesy"
is really not a bad concept.  If we don't crowd too close and are constantly
watching what is going around us we can generally avoid any too serious a
confrontation -- whether it be another driver or deer/moose/cow/horse, etc.
(as I've seen accidents involving all of them).  Don't get me wrong as the
states attorney said several years ago "Mr. Blue your driving record is a
little spotty"  (I don't currently have any points though).  In the end, I
really don't think the strain on the ego is worth the high blood pressure
or worse.  So when the road is clear I drive for the fun of it, and if there
is any risk it is to me.  Fortunately, I have that luxury in Vermont on an
empty stretch of asphalt through the farms and the mountains or just down
the interstate.  But I still have to be on the lookout for the individual
(grandmother, tourist or farmer with a trackor around the bend) who pulls out
in from of me only to go 25 regardless that the posted speed is 50!

It is easy for me to say not to push too hard, and I felt the way many of you
do when I was commuting between NYC and North Jersey on the Parkway or Cross
Bronx, etc.  But precaution still seems to be the most prudent approach.  It
is like the first rule of sailing -- "the skipper must at all times take any
reasonable course to avoid a collision".  It doesn't help you feel better if
you had the right-of-way, and got hit.  There are some things even insurance
coverage (yours or theirs) won't make up for.  So the next time some uncooth
ill-mannered cretin intrudes into your space -- back off and let him go.  It
isn't worth the mental or physical price.  Let us set the better example.

Enough bandwidth from me.  Enjoy the day.

Porschephiles gathering.  Here are directions to London Bridge from
elliot.entin@alphatech.com:

  Follow signs to Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row.  Wharf 2 is just
  before Fisherman's Wharf, off of Del Monte (note Naval Postgraduate
  School borders Del Monte about .75 miles from Wharf 2 turn-off).  
  Tony Roma's, the chain barbecue steak restaurant) is a large round 
  building with windows all around (easy to see from the road).  
  London Bridge Pub is below Tony Roma's.  There is a large parking 
  area in front of and around Wharf 2 and Fisherman's Wharf.

I think we'd settled on Saturday night, August 19, around 7 PM as the
best time for the most people.  We've got something like 8-10 people 
who have expressed interest.  Anyone else, feel free to join us.

Subject: whats a CDS oscillator

I posted a few questions a while back and havn't gotten any response.  Perhaps
I was a bit verbose, so I'll state it a bit more simply now (I think the
caffine has worn off...)

What does a CDS oscillator do?  It must be some sort of high power electrical
device since it has lots of fins for cooling on the case.  Replies can be
sent directly to me at dunham@sgi.com

Looking forward to meeting some of you bay area p-philes at the

Subject: RE: improvements to a 71 911T

Hi Dan,

I recently bought a 1973 911T and have made several "upgrades"
and improvements, principally the seats and door panels.

I purchased and installed Recaro SE seats with updated belts
and retractors.  It ran about $1000 ... best money you will ever
spend.  I kept the original seats in case the next owner wanted
them.

As far stereos go, you should be able to find something to fit without
cutting up the dash.  You can put speakers in the lower door panels
as there are already holes there.  I bought some updated aftermarket
door panels (after I found out how much original parts would cost)
and cut holes in them instead of the originals.

The max size wheels that you'll probably be able to go with is
7x15's according to all my friends on this alias,  but that will
vary from car to car.

IMHO practicality is more important than originality unless you are
talking about a low volume, high $$$ machine like an RS Carrera.
I bought mine to drive and to have fun.  If that means being not
"original", so be it.

Hope this helps ...

Subject: 911 Rear Window Gaskets

I have a 1972 911 with the heated rear window. When I repainted the car, i
removed all the glass and trim. I bought a "package" (from AJR, I believe)
that included all the rubber gaskets for the windows and doors. I had a
great deal of trouble getting the wires for the heated rear window to fit
correctly in the rubber gasket. Is there a separate gasket for the rear
window with and without the heating element? If the gasket is the same, then
I need to work with the wires to get then to fit better (the rear window
leaks). Thanks for your responses.

Would you settle for a bunch of opinions instead?  Well too bad, I'm
going to say them anyway.

#1: Rake.  No.  Car should sit dead level.
#2: European.  No.  They is *all* the same.
#3: Height.  No strict rule here.  High enough to fit over the
    speed bumps.

I usually measure the height via the "Automotion Methode":  Measure
the distance between the TOP of the wheel, and the bottom of the rear
fender lip.  With a stock body, this should be between 2.5 and 3.5
inches.  If the fenders have been modified, this will change.

Next, measure the height at the four jacking points.  They should
all be equal.  If none of them have ever been bent, that is.  (which
is kind of rare.)

Bump steer happens when the front suspension is set too low.  The
verticle (sp?) displacement along the tie-rod ends becomes too great,
as the body is now lower.  So the steering rack is moved up to compensate.
You should not be seeing bump-steer on a car that is a a "street" height.

Hope this helps,
Gary.

Well, chances are the sources are copyrighted. Which means the pictures

Magazines license these images for specific use from the photographers, who

Yeah, I get the same thing, but from these local kids with VW Bugs!  They 
go out to sac raceway on wed nights, and then leave the writing on their 
windows so they look cool.

So far, Porsche 5, VW 0

The Vette's are a different matter.  I've seen a lot of vett-dudes who 
feel they have to peel away from a stop light to show their superiority. 
I'm smart 'nuff to know my 2.4T doesn't have a prayer, so I just cruise

Subject: 911s, and 28s,  and Autoxes....Oh MY!

Hi all!

Gotta couple questions and some info to pass on to anyone that cares... 
:^)

First off,  I'm looking for an OEM stainless steel (non-powered) 
antenna for a 68 911L.  I've checked w/ most of the big names places 
and they seem to only have the black one.  They seem to miss the point 
on OEM...  sigh.

Next, many moons ago, I had asked about '85 928S rear wheel bearings. I 
got all sorts of tips and would like to thank all those that responded. 
 Now, I gotta 'nother question.  Despite the odds, the bearing was shot 
and I've picked up another one (tain't cheap!) But, I'm shipping this 
thing to my dad in the Middle East where parts, for some reason, are 
quite scarce...  Are there any seals/gaskets that I should drop in the 
air-mail package just in case the old ones are shot?

Third, as another baseline for gas milage on older cars, keeping in 
mind that mine has Webers, I'm getting a notch over 21 mpg if I spend 
it all on the highway (or The Beltway) and around 13~14 when I'm 
fartin' around Northern Virginia (Potmac Mills and Old Town Alexandria 
for those that are truly curious :^)).

Which brings me to autocrosses(ing?) in Northern VA.  This 
up-and-coming weekend will offer:

July 29th: The Porsche-Corvette challenge at NOVA Comm College -  
Manassas (66 to 234 North, then a back parking lot, jest listen for the 
roar and watch for low flying cones...).

On the 30th: The Corvette-Porsche challenge at Old Dominion Speedway.  

This is a mutal admiration club thing between Potomac PCA and the 
corresponding 'vette club.  

If any one wants some digital snaps of their wheels,  I hope to 
'acquire' one of them there fancy Digital Nikon/Kodak cameras.  I think 
I can squash an image on to a single floppy - may have to live w/o the 
16 million colors though; I'm not going to know until Friday night.  
NOTE: It's all gonna depend on the heat, it's been pretty brutal the 
last few days and I don't know if the laptop would appreciate the 
enivronment.

    Which is faster.. a hyper miata, a 914/3.x, or a 914/chev 3xx?

My '72 has "auto-retracting seatbelts" and I guess I thought
they were not new on that year.  In any case, I'd certainly
add them in a minute with no concern about authenticity.

My car came to me with strange Pioneer speakers on the back
deck panel.  They're ugly as sin, but I haven't had the
energy to replace them.  Speakers in the front door 
pockets are common, but I bet there are other places they
can be put.  You can probably find a CD player that fits in
the available radio slot if you look a bit.

I've been able to run 205-60x15's on my car, which came to
me with 7" wide wheels.  It's close to rubbing on the
fenders, but OK.  If you don't flare the fenders, no harm
is done to resale.

> Would these kind of modifications ruin the value

No, if for no other reason than they can probably all be 
put back the way it came.  But most people would want some
or all of what you mention, in my opinion.

I've been using my '72 as a daily driver for seven years.
I'm in San Diego, where that may be more practical than
in snowbound areas.  I've had no real problems except for 
the top-end rebuild I knew was needed when I bought it.  
These cars are reliable!

I would go with the H-4's I'm not sure if the 914 headlights are the same 
as the other VW air-cooled headlights (engine that is, the lights are 
gnat cooled I think... because that seems to be where they all collect), 
but if they are, look through Hot VWs and you can get pretty good prices 
on them. ('roundabout $15/ea) I'm going to put them on my Bug, and we're 
considering upgrading all the other cars to H-4 (the Porsche has some 
strange Euro lights that are at least as powerful as the H4's, if not 
more, and no, they aren't street legal, but who cares?)

I have an engine, with mount, from a 912E.  It is a long bar, and totally

had just a simple piece of 3/16 x 2" steel bar about two feet long bolted

Get a  igital voltmeter and check the power to your headlights, and
especially the ground.  Run a long wire from the front to the battery, and
check for voltage drop to the brown wire from the headlight.

I've been driving 914's for 16 years, and never had a complaint about the
hedlights.   

BTW:  city drivers showing off their driving lights are a particular
aggravation to me in the low 914.  Even worse are the yuppie 4WD shopping
carts with their high headlights in my mirror.

Re: Special Endplay Shim for a 356 Engine.

      Though it is true that Porsche only made endplay shims from 0.8mm to
1.1mm,  I've got a few around .030". (and a few around 0.046").  If need be,
we can surface grind a shim to whatever thickness you need, though you
SHOULDN'T need a  shim grossly out of the range unless something ELSE is
 wrong- like a flywheel machined at the hub area, or a crankshaft that had
some dowel pin "work". Don't use the VW 36HP shims as these are both the Mark
of The Turkey and won't work as well- Porsche used only ONE shim for a
reason! (I just took apart a 912 engine that had been rebuilt in L.Al,
{scary} that had  three  40HP/1500/1600 VW shims inside!  The 
VW 40HP/1500/1600 engines use an endplay shim that larger in BOTH I.D. AND
O.D. It ate into the  Flywheel Main bearing Big Time. Story is in progress,.
(And I recently   took apart a 2-piece case where some idiot used aluminum
"shims" in the form of aluminum foil, behind the rod AND Main Bearings,
'cause he couldn't find the  right size bearings! It lasted a while, but
eventually the foil oozed out and everything went  to Hell.)
   
   Re: Real "SC"'s. Trond is correct- the Super-90 is quite a bit different
than the '64-'65 SC. The  Super-90 Crank, Flywheel, Heads,  Main Bearings,
End Play Adjusting Shim and Cylinders and Pistons are NOT the same as those
in the "SC". And that's most of the  engine.  Super-90's are my Favorite
Engine as they take special, unique parts.  Methinks when the "C" came out
the Factory just carried  the "S" of the 356B series over and called the
"Super" version  of the "C" the "SC". And don't  forget, "REAL" SC's have
Pushrods!

    Re: 912 Owner looking for an Oil Temp Sender- it is possible  to convert
the gauge to use  a cheap sender, but it costs almost as much as buying a
used sender. Let me know  what year 912 you have, as the senders are

   The correct spelling for Ach Scheiss is actually "Ach Scheisse." The

All this talk about "I've got a 71 and how can I improve it" and
"My '72 has "auto-retracting seatbelts" leads me to ask:

I've got a 1968 911 S, When I bought it it had Lapstraps for seat belts.

I had fitted some 3 point manually adjusted seatbelts, YUK, because I was told
you cannot kit recoil seatbelts because there is no mouning point on the door
pillar. Is this true?

What would be the most comfortable seatbelts I could fit to my 27 year old baby

  Steve,

  Can't help you with the Optima 8000, but I too was tired of the mess caused
  from
   lead/acid batteries.  I installed a pair of Gel  batteries from WestCo
  Battery Systems
  in Anaheim,  Ca (800/214-8040) in my '73 911 S.  They work great!

  They have 2 sizes that will fit in the stock  battery boxes.  The larger one
  uses the
  original mounting bracket, but the posts are too tall to attach the cable
  clamps to.
  In this application you would need to replace all the cable end clamps with
  eyelets.
  The posts are replaceable with a large screw or bolt.

  With the smaller size you don't have to change the cable clamps, however I had
   to
  stick a piece of 2 x 4 on top of the battery in order to use the stock clamps.
    In the
  future I plan on making some trick stainless clamps that will work without the
   wood.

  Either size of these Gell cells puts out way more cranking amperage than the
  stock
  batteries & the small ones way less.  So far I've been really happy with this
  set-up.
  Less mess, more cranking power & the Gels don't seem to lose their charge when
  the car sits for 3 or 4 weeks between starts.

  Good Luck,
  Otto Krossit

Subject: Re: timing chain housing oil leak

Bob,
Thanks for answering. I looked in the factory manual and am not sure quite
how this would work. It looks like the gasket that goes around where the
chain comes in could be replaced without removing the chain or sprocket.(The
picture doesn't look like the gasket goes all the way around the opening
where the chain comes in.)
      The gasket and o-ring around where the cam come in look like they have
to have the sprocket removed to replace them. It looks like the bolt through
the center of the sprocket holds it in place with the cam. I can't see how
the roll pin in the sprocket does anything other than tie the 2 sprockets
together. If this is the case then when the bolt is removed to take off the
sprocket the cam must be retimed when it is re-installed(unless you are
*REAL* careful not to move anything).BTW the engine is a 3.2 Carrera if that
makes any difference. 
    I feel I'm missing a some crucial info. Can you help?

When I had a new 72  911T (2.4) MFI the mileage was a "lousy" 14 MPG compared
to my previous 2.2L 911T w/Zeniths which regularly got 20-22 MPG.  All in
all, the early 2.4 911T's  were a step-down in drivability and mileage offset

Subject: Dash Cover Install


I just installed one of the ABS plastic dash covers on the doubly-cracked
dash of my '74 911, and I thought I'd pass along a little experience:

1. I felt guilty putting it on because it ain't the real thing. But this
guilt can be dealt with by promising the car that you will put a real OEM
dash in it when you do the windows-out refinish. The car didn't ask WHEN I
would do the paint...

2. The covers don't fit right out of the box, so be prepared to spend a
couple of hours working on it. You MUST trim a little at a time, attempt to
fit it, trim some more, fit, trim, etc.

3. Whilst doing the fit and trim exercise above, be careful not to cut the
leather/vinyl on the windshield posts with the sharp, freshly trimmed edges
of the plastic. I said I was sharing experience :(

4. The dash cover is too shiny. This can be altered, if you are careful,
with a rag and some acetone. A *light* rub with some acetone on a rag takes
the shine off just right. Put the acetone on the rag, open the rag up and
let a little evaporate, and then do the light rub. Try it on the cover,
underneath, before you install so you can see what it does. You don't want
a really wet rag; the acetone is capable of turning your dash cover into a
ball.

5. The cover is glued onto the dash with silicone glue (like RTV). The
thing actually fits very well when you get it trimmed correctly. The trick
is getting enough weight on it while the glue is drying. I have some lead
shot in 25 lb cloth bags, so I used 4 of them spaced evenly on the dash to
hold it down while the glue dried.

Once on and stuck down, the thing looks pretty fair. I honestly like it
better than the cracked dash, but it is only a cosmetic bandage and not a
long term fix.

A typical room air conditioner may be 5-6,000 BTU. If I recall from my
youth the days of aftermarket air conditioners for cars, they were rated at
30,000 BTUs and up. So there is your difference of 2HP for the home AC vs.
10-12 for the car. Mostly a matter of virtually no insulation in a car,
plus the big greenhouse, and an engine/transmission which is also
generating heat which leaks into the car...(although that should be less of
an issue for a 356/911 than a front engined car..).

Hmmmm, my '69 912 had the same I think - semi-rectangular enclosures

Others (Maestro perhaps?) may know better, but I think even the 912E

Hope I wasn't misunderstood.
The 912E engine is same as 914 2.0 engine except for type of EFI and tin and
exhaust, and that long, heavy motor mount bar.

Fitting the 914/912E engine to the early 912 will require a modification or
replaication of the 912 mount bar, which will have to fit between the block
and the fan housting.

the 924 in the picture had drivin lights inset INTO the front bumper next to

driving lights undet the front bumper, but with Vermont road would prefer to
keep them higher if possible without ruining the appearance of the 924 nose.
What was depicted is not the 944 turbo front configuration either (although I
someday hope move to the 944 turbo from the 924 as always its a matter of $$).

So my question has anyone seen this configuration out there?  If so any ideas
where it might be obtained?

You're correct, it's the european bumper version. Although mine is a 
'85 model, the bumber has been the same in europe throughout the 
whole life of the 924 including th 924S. The lights will normally 
give dim light, and give only  bright light if you signal and the main 
driving lights happen to be down. That's only a question of electrics 
though, and would be fairly easy to rewire. As far as I understood, 
the different bumber shape was mainly due to the more strict US legislation 
with respect to low speed collisions.

If you want retractable belts I know that "Automotion" carries them to fit older

I have a 66 912 and have wanted to put 3 point seatbelts in my car for some time

the shoulder mount to the large screw located on the back sides of the car?  I 
assume that is what these two screws are for? The screws appear a bit to low for 
this though?  Also where did you get your 3 point belt and how much did it cost? 
 I am not going to go to the expense of mounting a retractable seatbelt system 
so a manually adjustable belts would be fine for me.

Solution, replaced the starter and all is well.

Subject: 911 electrical problem

I have an annoying minor electrical "feature" on my '87 911 targa.
If you open either door, front lid, or rear lid, the radio loses
its memory and the clock stops.  It doesn't matter whether the
engine is running or not, or even if the key is in the ignition.
For a while, turning on the dome light caused the radio to reset
and the clock to stop.  But now, the dome light, trunk light, and
engine bay light all don't work.

Any suggestions?

I think I know what's going on...  (I used to be a stereo installer *YEARS*
ago, and did an installation that had a similar problem)

The "always" power lead for the radio is connected to the dome light
power on the groung side.

The "always" power lead is the one that keeps the memory/clock alive.

The dome light "ground" side will have 12V on it unless the doors
are open, or the interior light is on.

This is a too common mistake for stereo installation; someone poked
around under the dash with a voltmeter until a lead with +12 that
stayed there with & w/o the key was found.  That lead was used for
memory backup.

Find that lead from the stereo, and hook it up to the fuse box on 
the suppy that comes straight from the battery without being switched
by the ignition.  In German cars, it's red.  (Or yellow.  Darn, I hate
being stuck without a manual.  Little help here guys?)  If you found
it hooked to a brown, or black with a green or yello tracer, that's
definately your problem.  (Ain't it nice that all German cars have
wires that are color-coded the same way?)

Subject: NEW General Question

I know there was a lot space given over to the with/without/AC question. I
just read three days worth of the digest form so I got it in massive doses.
BUT, my perversion of the question was never addressed.  

I have a perception, borne from driving lotsa different cars, not just
Pcars, that cars have LESS BREAKING POWER when the AC is turned on.  I've
noticed this in my 944, my Subaru SVX, a couple of Honda Accords, VW GTi's,
and even a Cadillac.  I've never forced the issue to a full blown test, but
I consistently sense that a car has significantly less breaking power with
the AC on.  

Is there any reason (I can't think of one except that power is being
diverted from the hydraulic system by the AC) why there might, indeed, be
less breaking power with the AC on?

Does anyone happen to have an old set of 911 ignition

with their rubber seals.  It bugs me to have to buy
an entire new set wires when all I need are a few pieces.

I've seen them for sale somewhere - Performance Products? - but

close to paying what one pays for an entire set at less

Subject: Need Tire Info, Firehawk SZ vs ???

When I bought my '78 911 SC this spring it came with an oddball
tire combination.  Firehawk SZ's on all 4 corners, 205/55ZR16
up front and 225/50ZR16 in back.  The fronts have 50% - 60% tread,
the right rear has 70% and the left rear has < 30%.  One of the
rears was replaced after 18K miles (reason unknown) and the worn
one has about 24k miles.

The worn back tire is starting to make me nervous about some upcoming
trips (400 and 800 mi) over the next couple of weeks.  Looking at
my options I could:

a) Continue the one tire at a time trend and buy one more Firehawk for $145.
b) Ditch the whole set for four Yoko AVS Intermediate ($650), Bridgestone
   RE71 ($660) or BFG Comp TA ($540).
c) Combine (a) with a new set of wider wheels and track tires (many
   $$$ but deferred until next year).

The car is a fair weather daily driver that takes a few long trips
a year.  I'm planning to attend a PCA novice drivers school this fall
and expect to drive at several drivers ed events next summer.

I'm especially interested in anyone's personal experience with Firehawks.
They seem ok on the street but I don't have a clue how they perform on
a track.  I want to keep my expense to a minimum (I wouldn't waste the
bandwidth if it didn't matter) but don't want to spend another dime
with Firestone if these tires suck.

Thanks in advance for advice on solving my tire dilemma.

Sure -- the cold air is denser, which makes your car heavier, therefore your
braking effort increases! :)

But seriously, I don't have an explanation, I just thought that I'd add a Fun
Fact (TM):  When I am stopped with my foot on the brake, and I shut off the
A/C compressor, the brake pedal will rise.  Not much, maybe 3-4mm (subjective,
of course).  My guess is the DME (or whatever you've got) can't compensate
exactly for the increased load, so the engine runs just a bit slower, thereby
generating just a bit less vacuum at idle.  Thus, less power assist, thereby
increasing the pedal effort required.

My US$0.02.  Feel free to flame -- they've got the A/C in the office cranked,
and it's *cold*!

I've just gone through a problem with my a/c leaking too. Before you
spend a lot of money or time, I would suggest you go over the whole
system.

First, pull the air cleaner cover and remove the air cleaner.  There are
a/c lines running along the right fender and across the firewall behind
the airbox that you should inspect.  You may have to pull the lower half
of the airbox too (two bolts, no sweat).  

Starting at the compressor follow the hose to the pipe on the right
fender.  Then follow the pipe along the fender to the firewall.  Then
along the firewall to the fuel cooler.  From the other side of the fuel
cooler there is a short right angle pipe that goes to the evaporator.
Make sure that there is no accumulation of dirty/oily "stuff" at any
connectors ... if so, you have a leaky O-Ring and must replace it.

Be sure to get a/c o-rings as they are made specially for a/c systems.
I got mine from Eurasian at about $4 - $5 each.  Also, get a can of
a/c oil (compatible with the type of refrigerant you use) and coat
the o-rings with the oil before you install them.

Also inspect the a/c line running from the evaporator back to the 
front of the car (to the drier?) and the connections at the drier.

If you open up the a/c system, cap the open ends with baggies or
something to keep as much contamination and moisture out as
possible.

I had a dinged a/c pipe (someone had probably wacked it with a 
wrench when working onthe car) and bad o-rings.  Been great
since I replaced all the leaky parts!

I also had the a/c shop evacuate the system for a good 1 1/2 hours
as it had been opened to the outside.

If you don't find any leaks, then you might indeed have a 
compressor problem.  

Good luck!

Victor,

I would save the whole set of tires for spares.   Then, I would buy the
Yokos, because I'm a firm believer of them.  Yokos are good tires for the
enthusiast and the AVS tires are good street rubber.   All of them (Yoks)
get about the same wear.   RE71s are good, but the AVS are a better
choice for the money.   The BFGs are old technology, but they would
probably wear better (220 wear factor vs. 160).  

For track use, save your money for a whole set of wheels and racing
(read, shaved) BFG R1s.   Depending on the rules, use the stock wheels
for track and buy a different set for street.

Hope this helps,

Second, is it just me or is there a deep divide between 914 owners and

road, but only one 911. Admittedly, most new 911 drivers around here are people 
that might be happy in a lexus or similar, but it seems like some purposely
ignore me...perhaps because I'm not in a 'real' porsche. What _is_ the 
sentiment here? I don't mean to start a big debate, I'm jsut curious how 
other p-car enthusiasts regard the 914. I feel that it is a porsche in 
every regard. Except where it was built. And those dang little VW marks

Very fast track.  Just watch out for turn 10, it ate 3 Porsches over the weekend

I would recommend the shop manuals if you have the bucks.  The factory 
manuals I have start at the beginning of the 911 saga.  This is a lot of 
information in any terms.  Sometimes regions will purchase the manuals 
for members use.  Thus they can be shared.  Don't forget that the parts 
manuals have a lot of information also.  I would try for used ones.  
These pages are of Euro dimensions.  Remember this when xeroxing pages to 
be included in your shop manuals.

Subject: Porsche 914 Body repair

I just bought a '74 914 1.8.  Its just got this little problem of having only 
half of a floor on the passenger side and a lot of rust around the underside 
under both doors.  It is, of course, missing both the inner and outer rocker 
panels.

In trying to find rocker panel replacements and a floorboard fix, I found a guy 
at an auto parts store who was willing to cut off the entire floor of a car he 
has including the inner rocker panels encompassing the cockpit area.  This 
wouldn't be too much more expensive to buy than the inner rocker panels alone.

I was wondering if anyone out there has ever tried to do this and if it was 
successful.  From what I can gather, rust in this area is extremely common.  I 
would like to know if I could get this new piece welded into my car and keep 
the car from sagging when finished (it sags ever-so- slightly now).  Please let 
me know if this is a foolish thing to attempt and what a good alternative is.

I doubt if there is much difference in the

or go to a generic Porsche mechanic (non-dealer).
In fact, if you find a good one (who is so busy
he doesn't mind telling you how to do it yourself)
he will probably answer your questions for you. I
have a mechanic like that.  If I don't mind waiting
a week for him to get to me, he'll work on the car.
Sometimes I choose to do that.  Other times, I ask

Subject: seat belt surgery

Hi,
   
My '73 911 targa currently has properly functioning seatbelts in the safety 
sense, howver they only retract about 5 inches after using them. My 
question is- can I buy a used retractor from a late model Porsche, cut 
off the male part of the seatbelt, and have the male end from my current 
seatbelts stitched on by somebody with a heavy duty sowing machine? The 
only problem then would be the retractor anchor. In my car the retractor 
is held by one rather large bolt. If other Porsche use the same type of 
anchoring, I would then have no problem using a good used retractor. I 
figure by doing it this way I can save a fair amount of money without 
comprimising on safety (Before flaming me for trying to save money 
on a safety related item, please note that I would have the end sowed 
on by somebody with a heavy duty sowing machine and 
thus be able to withstand the stress of a potential accident.)

Thanks for any help or suggestions,

Couple of quick comments:

The cost of the labor is a lot more than the cost of the parts.  So I
would use *new* parts.  They are available.

Spend the extra bucks to get the frame stiffened.  Parts Werks makes
some nifty frame rail supports that work great, and aren't that
much extra labor when the car is stripped down as far as you will
have it.

The welders in this area prefer "domestic" steel.  Higher carbon
content.  And at least one metal stamper is galvanizing the parts.

(More opinions later, if requested.)

Hey all,
I need a grommet/spark plug wire holder for my 912. The Part # is

grommet/holder. They even think that $17 is a bit much but they don't
set the price. So I'm looking for a used one. It has a dual purpose, first it
plugs a small hole in the ducting and second it keeps the wires from
'floating' around in the engine compartment. Anyone got one they like to 
sell??? If not I guess I'll fork over the $17 for a $0.50 grommet...8{.

This problem is usually caused by the fuel pressure leaking down.  The
two main culprits are the fuel accumulator and the fuel pump check 
valve.  I would check the accumulator first as it is easy to get to and
replace (they are also relatively cheap @ about $40).  It could also be
something like leaking fuel injectors, I suppose, but I'd try the fuel
accumulator...

I got my 88 911 Cab last month and finally got around to messing with the CD that had been installed.  Sounded like... 
well terrible.

Looked at the speakers, Boston Accustics, and the cones had all but gone away.  Went to a local stereo place for 
replacements they said $500.00!!!  ( 2 rear speakers and 2 in each door panel)  Guy said they were really GOOD 
speakers, Darn I HOPE SO.

Well I said go ahead and replace them... they started to but the new ones were round whereas the old ones where 
square (these were the ones in the door panels).  Of course you could still see the outline where the old speakers were 
mounted so I said forget it!

Picked up a car audio mag and noticed, as the stereo guy said, that all the speakers shown had round grills :(

Anyone here know of a good car audio mailing list where I might get some info on either having these re-coned or get 
other ides?

I tried this exactly once - similar situation up until you say "He sure
stayed back after that"...

The result - a 10 minute chase through highway and industrial areas with
the tailgater trying to run me off the road - literally. He came very close
to succeeding. I only got out of the situation after he blew past me on
a freeway onramp, stopped his car sideways on the onramp, got out and
started running back towards my car (to beat the living shit out of me,
and I'm not a large guy - he'd have had an easy time of it). Luckily
for me he left just enough room for me to squeak by and drive down the
highway at a pretty crazy rate of speed (and off at the next offramp).

I do NOT suggest trying this. The guy behind me was past the point of caring
about his car - he was trying to hit mine to get me to stop (he didn't
succeed though it was touch and go). The adrenalin still builds a bit when
I think about it and it happened about 6 or 7 years ago.

You never know what'll happen when you piss someone off just that extra
little bit. If he'd had a gun, I'd be dead.

Subject: Wonky Mirror, new alignment problem

Thanks for the interest in the mirror question....the one where only the left 
right worked but not the "up down". Did a fair bit of digging, turns out the 
wiring in the mirror module is ....shall we say...inconsistent with the wiring 
diagram in the factory service manual. Finally noticed that there were 2 brown 
wires going to the heating element in the mirror itself, when there should 
have been a green/grey and a brown. When I traced the wiring, figured that 
Grey green = brown, and Yellow/Brown = Brown and then took the pins out of the 
holder and switched them around....it all works. Sure wish there was an easier 
way to extract the pins out of the holder though....took me an hour to do it 
with a tiny screwdriver.

New Problem: Took the machine on its first drive around the block in 10 years 
( I am a bit slow on my restoration stuff). Everything went great, still 
missing windows and have no licence or insurance yet so didn't get into 
anything interesting .... until. Turned back up onto the driveway, heard a 
"bending" noise, and when I checked, the drivers side front tire had clipped 
the edge of the front fender and bent it down a bit. Nothing which cannot be 
repaired, but now I am worried about the tire size/alignment and whether it 
will all work.

Specifics are: Hartmann 17" Carrera Cup lookalikes (7" I believe), Yokohama 
A008P's, 205/50 - 17, no suspension mods, however front fender lip was sitting 
at 25.5 inches above ground, camber still rough at this point, but I think it 
is about 1 degree negative.

Are these tires too bloody big for a stock '75 911S front fender?? Should I 
raise the car up a bit and will that help......any ideas out there???

Well I guess this is as good a time to announce it as any:

The official PorschePhiles Portland Parade Preview

I have sort of unofficially been keeping track of the P-philes that are
attending the Parade this year and have made arraingements for a nifty
gathering of sorts.

The date:    Tuesday, August 8
The time:    5:30 - 10:00 pm ???
The place:   Parts Obsolete to start, brew pub in McMinnville afterwards

The directions:

99W towards the coast, left at highway 18 (flashing yellow).  Follow 18 to
the Salem/Amity road left there around past the airport via the sailplane 
signs.  Stay until 233, turn right and travel for 3/4 of mile until you see
the large saw blade "Emory's Boarding Stable"  and #53 356 in pasture.  Turn
left into driveway.  This is Eola Villiage road.  House is 1/2 block down on
left:  13851 Eola Village Road   Maps will be available at PIR.

The plan:

This area is beautiful to drive through, I thought since there was little in
the way of organized activities on tuesday night, I could lead a caravan of
interested P-philes from PIR about 4:30.

Rsvp to me asap via email so I know what kind of turn out to expect....

There might also be a pizza-night on Saturday the 12th for those attending
the PCA race..... rsvp if you want to go to that as well.

Subject: 951 Hood Shocks

Preparing for the trip to Parade, I decided to replace both hood shocks on
my 951 so I won't lose my head when I check the oil level. Being an alert
P'philer, I first checked out the 944.faq to see if there was any "trick"
procedure I needed to know about (I never replaced them before).

Boy, was I relieved to read:
 "5.4.6  Hood and hatch shocks worn out
           . . . They can be replaced easily. . . ."

Hah! FAT CHANCE they can be replaced easily! How do you compress those
babies? Who's THAT strong? And, at the same time, slide in the retaining
pin with your third hand? 911 shocks must be wimpier (less weight to hold
up).

I'm having the kid do it. I called him, and he asked, "You didn't break the
windshield, did you?" Hmm, I don't remember reading any precautions about
that in the 944.faq. Seems that inexperienced folk (like me, and mechanics
at a couple of the independent garages around here) want to push the 944
hood waaaay back to minimize the distance needed to compress the shock and,
in the process, the corner of the hood nearest each side of the windshield
moves up into and cracks it. No, I didn't do that.

Maybe 5.4.6 should be re-worded: "They can be replaced easily by Arnold
Schwartzeneger, if he has a helper to insert the pin."

Don't know what part of the world you are in, but Speaker City in Burbank
California is an excellent place to get speakers reconed.

However, they have the Vifa 6.5 inch woofers for $19.95, currently, and
they will blow your old speakers away (even before they fell apart) I used
'em in the doors of my 911.

All car speakers are either round or elliptical. When you speak of a
'square' speaker, either the grille is square or it's a multi-driver
speaker system mounted on a base plate that is square. Either way, I'm sure
reconing is the cheapest way out if you want to keep the original
configuration.

Personally, I'd go for the best sound first, and find a cosmetic fix (like
square grilles) later.

My .02.

P.S. After putting sound systems in nerly a dozen 911s, I have a few
thoughts on the matter that might be boring to the P'philes in toto, but
send me an e-mail, and I'll let you have it.

You're right. The gasket that seals where the chain enters from the
crankcase does go completely around and you do have
to remove the cam sprocket in order to slip the gasket over
the chain.  You have to remove the cam sprocket for the gasket
and o-ring around the cam also, just as you say.  And you're
also right in that you would have to maintain the position
of the cam sprocket with respect to the sprocket with the hole
for the pin.  If you don't, you will have to re-time the cam.  But
I don't see why you can't maintain their relationship by being
careful.  But what if you slipped...?  Well, then you'd learn
to retime a cam!

I guess it may not be as easy as I thought, but I wouldn't
hesitate to tackle it.

Sorry.  I don't think I thought of all the ramifications

Rob-

Good advice about buying a 911.  In it you mentioned
your oil leak-

>Fixing it involves removing it, replacing the gasket, and
>then re-timing the cam (not sure about this)?  Maybe $300
>including parts for someone else to do it.

The timing chain housing is sealed from the rest of the
engine in two places, one where the chain itself enters
from the engine, and the other where the camshaft extends
into the timing case.  The former opening is sealed with
a simple paper or fiber gasket which probably costs about
$2 or less.  The latter is sealed with an O-ring and a
paper gasket, which also probably cost less than $2 each.

Where's your leak?  Either one is pretty easy to fix, and
you can do it without having to re-time the cam.

You should see the car I saw the other day. It was a '77 911S with less than
40K miles on it. The sunroom must have broken at some point and the PO didn't
want to fix it. Instead, he removed the metal sunroof and used a piece of
plexiglass about 1/4" thick and about 1/2" wider and longer than
the opening in the roof. He then gooped tons of silicon along the edges and
screwed it directly to the roof with about 50 screws! It sort of looked like
aircraft construction techniques. Ugh!

Hi Chris,

I have a '73 911s targa and can probably help you. First of all you don't 
have to tear the trunk apart to get to the speedo, or the other 
instruments for that matter. The instruments are held in place by rubber 
rings. If you twist the instruments while pulling on them they should pop 
right out. As for the bulbs, there should be a little round part sticking 
out from where the lights are. They are copper in color. This is from 
memory. just get needle nose pliers and twist those and they will come 
out as well.

As for the lever to the left of the parking brake, it's your idle 
adjustment (and cruise control up to 75-80mph in my car). When working 
properly it should be connected to your accelator pedal. It's used to adjust your idle when 
your engine is cold, at least in my car. I think you can access it by 
unscrewing the parking brake assembly and looking in the tunnel.  
Attached to that lever should be a plastic piece that should rest against 
the accelerator cable. Once again, this is from memory. 

You should really get the Haynes manual. It is pretty good for simple 
repairs on older 911s and it's only $15.

enjoy your car,

How do you know it was a C36? Maybe it was the other way around: a guy with
a lowly diesel puts the AMG kit on his car, and forgot to remove the
badges! Actually, this is highly unlikely; I don't think there is a C Class
diesel, only E.

Hi Dan,

I recently bought a 1973 911T and have made several "upgrades"
and improvements, principally the seats and door panels.

I purchased and installed Recaro SE seats with updated belts
and retractors.  It ran about $1000 ... best money you will ever
spend.  I kept the original seats in case the next owner wanted
them.

As far stereos go, you should be able to find something to fit without
cutting up the dash.  You can put speakers in the lower door panels
as there are already holes there.  I bought some updated aftermarket
door panels (after I found out how much original parts would cost)
and cut holes in them instead of the originals.

The max size wheels that you'll probably be able to go with is
7x15's according to all my friends on this alias,  but that will
vary from car to car.

IMHO practicality is more important than originality unless you are
talking about a low volume, high $$$ machine like an RS Carrera.
I bought mine to drive and to have fun.  If that means being not
"original", so be it.

Hope this helps ...

Hmm, I'd like one of these but:

5) It's not clear what frequencies are in use in Europe.

I've noticed that a lot of companies in England are now selling radar
detectors but it's not clear whether they are adapted for UK frequencies
(are they the same throughout europe?!) and the price is quite high ($=gbp 
price).

I saw in a UK bike magazine that a guy was locked up for 6 months near
Leeds for doing 168mph on a motorway... (In Holland, I've been told, that 
more than 30mph over the limit will get you a fine equal to the value of

Re 911 engine dilemma:

     My recently rebuilt 2.7 litre engine started to puff blue
exhaust after heavy acceleration.  Upon initial inspection it
seemed the valve guides had gone.  The repair shop pulled the
engine and intended to send in the heads to have them redone at
their cost.  However, on closed inspection it was noticed that
the exhaust valves had been hitting the pistons.  Also, one of
the pistons had broken rings and damage around the ring grooves.
 When I originally had this rebuild done, the stock pistons and
cylinders I was told were in good shape and so they weren't
replaced.  The repair shop is now recommending I replace all of
these.  

     Can you replace only one piston and cylinder of should you
do all six?

mind having a little more power.

     During the rebuild I had the cams ground to a more
aggressive shape.  Could this be causing the pistons and valves
to collide?  

     My mechanic doesn't think the valve hitting the piston
caused the ring failure but rather, tired, worn pistons or maybe
bad gas or a foul fuel injector.  What do you think?

     If I am going to drive this car to the parade in Portland I
am going to have to make some quick decisions on repairs.  I am
however, reluctant to order new pistons etc. when I don't know
what caused the problem in the first place.

     Thanks for any suggestions.

I've got to get insurance for my car :-(.
Here's the parameters I can hand the "insurance guy:"
23 year old male, employed professional (computer industry, what
else), 2 three-year-old speeding tickets in massachussets (no big
deal, 70MPH on ye olde pike),
owned my p-car ('79 928) for 2 months commuting ~2hrs daily, no moving
violations.
i want to pay as little as possible for the insurance:
only "no-fault" insurance with maximum possible deductible.

what will this cost me, and who should i talk to?

oh, i live in Loma Mar and work in Belmont, so what i'm interested in
is bay area market.

any and all info/advice will be put to good use!

thanks

Looking for wisdom. I have been looking for a used 911 for about a year.
Heres the deal : White 1989 911 Targa, 14,000 miles, according to the owner
"just like new". I saw the car a year ago and told him to call if ever intere-
sted in selling... and he called. Assuming this car is in great shape. 
What is a fair price -- he does not know?
Is it worth having the car inspected? How much will this cost?
Yearly expenses associated with such a car? 1000/ year?
Typical problems with this model?

Subject: Re: 951 Hood Shocks


Hi Larry,
I replaced my hood shocks with the help of a friend who put in the pin,
and I'm not very strong.  It's all in the technique.

I used my upper body strength rather than my arms to compress the shock.
I put my shoulders as close to the top of the shock as possible, elbows 
bent all the way back to my chest, knees also bent, both hands gripping 
the top of the shock, upper body roughly perpendicular to the shock like 
I was hitting a tackling dummy, and facing towards the rear of the car.  
I attached the lower mount of the shock and pressed down using my upper 
body muscles, leaning in as I went (easy part).  Once it's compressed, 
slowly ease up pressure on the shock until the assistant can get the pin 
fitted (hard part).  You could have the assistant guide the shock to its 
fitting.  It will take a few tries... it gives you a pretty good workout.

Just go to a sign place that does vinyl lettering with a computer cutter.
They can make anything in any color and if you dont like it just pull it

Subject: Re:  Teaching the "teachers" a lesson!


I also recently experienced another driver attempting to "teach me a 
lesson."
I was following a high school girl, driving a lowered mini-truck (sans brake 
lites), driving in the left lane, with a closing velocity of 1.5 mph on 
right lane traffic.  I proceeded to
move right to pass (in a rental, not my Porsche), at which point, she 
accelerated until reaching the traffic in my lane, then matched speeds to 
create a moving barricade.  Meanwhile, her teen boyfriend provided the 
accompanying "I'll tell you how fast YOU can drive on MY road!" gestures 
from the passenger seat.  Rather than push the limit to make a point, I 
backed off to a safe following distance, and proceeded to follow 
her.....wherever she went.  Pretty soon, she began giving me opportunities 
to pass, which I respectfully declined.  She then put other cars between us, 
which I promptly removed.  After 20 minutes, she made a radical maneuver 
into a parking lot to shake me.  At this point, I figured she would think 
twice about who she pissed off the next time, so I let her go.

Ok add me to the list have 73 914 2.0 (bought new) and 74 carrera second owner.

The 914 is a much better autox car and IMHO more fun to drive autoxing, you

Subject: Re: timing chain housing oil ...

Hi,
there are a few places where the oil could be leaking from .one of them is
the least expected place.in the middle of the cam housing on the back
side.you will notice there is nothing there except what looks like glue or
epoxy.It is not uncommon for the strain inside the sproket erea to pull on
the shaft that is epoxied to this erea and get a pin hole leak.
If it is a leak between the cam tower and the chain housing you will need to
remove it all,sprocket,chain,tensioner,dowel pin,etc.
there is a rubber -O- ring that goes around a backing plate and a gasket
samwiching it to the cam tower,and these go over the camshaft and this can
only be acheived by getting every thing else out of the way.

After all is put back together the cam timing needs to be put back in
spec.Even if you could put the dowel back at the same spot on the spline you
would'nt get what you had prior.even with the dowel pin in place the timing
adjustment is able to mis adjust.0 7-.010 MM
Best advise is to check the opposite side and match it to spec.
If it is wrong valve slamming is possible,and off cam timing.

Just some caution

Thank you in part to the info that was given by many porschephiles and over
experienced legal counsel, to the delema of the Vt dealer that refused to
release my title for a 1993 RS america I purchased through him, from the
insurance.
you may recall I mentioned that after I paid him in full he delivered the car
but not the title.Only later to demand more money and even more money with no
resolution ,and would not return the money either. He felt after some thought
that he had sold the car to cheap. and was holding me hostage for more
money.I gave in,only to have the dealer request more money to get my
title.(this was going in circles).I had only his misrepresented bill of sale
that state an even higher selling price than the verbal agreement,after
payment in full was received.
To make a long story shorter  I filed a formal complaint with the District
attorney's office and one at the attorney general's office.They inturn
investigated the matter  and put the RMV to this case.
This is the first time I have ever had satisfaction with the regestry in my
life and probalby the first time they ever did what they should have done
from the beginning.(when is the last itme you said the RMV realy helped me
out).They ordered the dealer to release the title or give up dealer wrights
and licenses.he refused so they did.
So they raised the heat even more.to cite them for other violations and fines
and penalties and finally broke him down.
How ironic to look at the new bill of sale on his copy and see paid in full
afterall,Not to mention the date of  07/22/94 on the old bill of sale
and get the new one with 07/22/95(exacty one year)

Thank you to all those  gave advise ,even the one about planning a murder of
the dealer. it souded good at the time.I shouldn't say that ,if something
happens they could use this article against me.Look at O.J.

S. He has 140K miles on it! It is still a daily driver. According to him, he
even has the original water pump! The only thing he had to replace was the
clutch, at 90K. I think that the shocks need to be replaced, judging from the
way the car leaned in the autox, but it did not smoke, burn oil, or leak
anything. The interior was worn, but the paint was still in good shape. All
in all, I hope my car can last the long!

Hello All...thanks for suggestions...I still have problem but other areas 
have improved.  Here is what I've done/know up to now.

1) SPARK...good at all 4 cylinders,timing + ignition components all good
2) INJECTORS..all tested, confirm they don't leak, and work properly when
   triggered by good signal.  Have not checked fuel pressure.
3) TRIGGER POINTS..confirm good ON/OFF every 180 degress rotation on each
   side at connector.  Measured 1 Ohm resistance across "A" to Common &    
   "B" to Common when points closed...Points clean and no pitting.
4) HARNESS..checked continuity between ECU connector pins and trigger 
   points pins...good. Checked continuity between ECU pins and INJECTOR
   LEAD pins (all 4) ....good.
5) INJECTION SYSTEM...testing injectors showed no fuel delivery (when 
   cold) on #1 & #4, but good delivery on #2 & #3.  When engine warms up,
   I get smooth strong responsive performance.
6) VACUUM LINES... all checked/replaced/or trimmed back to "good"  
   rubber..noticed idle moved up quite a bit when all known "leaks" 
   blocked
7) IDLE ADJUSTMENT..noticed adjustment on throttle body was set already 
   for lowest setting.. MIXTURE ADJUSTMENT on ECU was maxed out RICH 
   (clockwise).  Have left each of these alone to keep the missing 
   problem (which only recently cropped up), isolated and as simple as 
   possible. 
8) GROUNDS...found ground at case seam near flywheel...disconnected,  
   cleaned all corrosion on connector and block reinstalled...no change.

Questions:

1) How can I check the signal while engine running at each injector with
   only the use of a digital multimeter?
2) How can I check the ECU in or out of the car to see if it is doing its
   job? (I don't have a spare known "good" one to swap out)
3) (UNRELATED QUESTION)..my '76 2.0 with Cat convertor has a sensor   
   plugged into it.  Is this a Lambda sensor?  I don't see any mention of 
   it in my Haynes manual. 
4) RELATED QUESTION...SPECIFICALLY which book has a good diagnostic guide
   to help me out here.  Factory manuals I have for other German Cars   
   don't help very much in model specific diagnostics.

I'd appreciate any ideas or leads any of you have...so far most advice 
has been SPOT ON and am hoping to glean more of these precious NUGGETS.

Subject: Know a Good Porsche Mechanic??

Can anyone tell me if there is a good, reliable and reasonable-cost Porsche
shop within one hour drive of Rhode Island??

I have experienced bad service, poor work and overpriced repairs during my
last four years of track events with my 911, using four different shops and
paying out over $30,000. In the past, the first shop (RI) repaired my
transmission, and it leaked. The second (CT) replaced transmission and new
clutch ( orginial from Germany). Then a clutch rivit came out, he wanted to
charge me again for the same work. 

In 1994, I used Autosports Designs (NY) which advertises in Pano (page 84
June) saying "How many mechanics have worked on your Porsche?" and stating
that they did great work. Hoping these claims were true,  I had them put in
a new (used 21,000 miles) Carrera engine from a wreaked car and do some
suspension work, and add their custom chip in the fall of 1994. First day, I
asked for an estimate, but did'nt get one for 2 months - after Autosports
had already purchased the engine. The total bill was $21,000 paid in Dec 1994. 

Then this year, June 4, the engine failed due to a bent valves while
accelerating to the rev limiter at Watkins Glen. Upon calling Autosports,
they wanted my car brought in ($500 flat bed charge for their associate's
truck), and they could determine what caused the valve to bend ( Overreved
because of bad chip? Or was the engine bad by being overeved before be taken
out of the wreaked car, or maybe by me in May?)  And, after getting my car
in their shop, Autosports said they were too busy to get it fixed right
away, but could do it by end of June. I waited and called every week and
finally got an estimate for $3,000-$4000 (plus transport and taxes) on June
29, and a promise to fix it by mid-July. Now July 28th, the engine is still
in pieces, and won't be fixed for awhile..Autosports now says reason for
bent valve- "overreved engine". Is this great service or what?? Spending
$25,000 with Autosports, and getting treated like a "mushroom" (keep in the
dark - and feed manure).

I am discouraged. What would you do if you were in my position?? Is this the
type of service we all have to expect in car repairs? Can anybody suggest a
better alternative within 50 miles of Rhode Island??

Subject: 911C4 clutch damper problems

My boss has a C4 with a clutch problem.  Some liquid filled damper goes rather
quickly I guess.  Rather than put back in the same parts with the same failure
possibility, he wants to try the RS clutch/flywheel arrangement.  It's cheaper
too.  Anyone have driving experience with this clutch/flywheel.  His (and my)
mechanic says it has a pretty different feel.  Much lighter in weight, more 
revvy, he wonders if it will suit the driver on the street.

Thanks,

Subject: 2.7 L problems

I am posting this messeage for my friend who does not have e-mail access. 
Any replies will be forwarded to Dave. Thanks in advance...

Re 911 engine dilemma:

     My recently rebuilt 2.7 litre engine started to puff blue
exhaust after heavy acceleration.  Upon initial inspection it
seemed the valve guides had gone.  The repair shop pulled the
engine and intended to send in the heads to have them redone at
their cost.  However, on closed inspection it was noticed that
the exhaust valves had been hitting the pistons.  Also, one of
the pistons had broken rings and damage around the ring grooves.
 When I originally had this rebuild done, the stock pistons and
cylinders I was told were in good shape and so they weren't
replaced.  The repair shop is now recommending I replace all of
these.  

     Can you replace only one piston and cylinder of should you
do all six?

     What would be a good choice for replacement.  I wouldn't
mind having a little more power.

     During the rebuild I had the cams ground to a more
aggressive shape.  Could this be causing the pistons and valves
to collide?  

     My mechanic doesn't think the valve hitting the piston
caused the ring failure but rather, tired, worn pistons or maybe
bad gas or a foul fuel injector.  What do you think?

     If I am going to drive this car to the parade in Portland I
am going to have to make some quick decisions on repairs.  I am
however, reluctant to order new pistons etc. when I don't know
what caused the problem in the first place.

     Thanks for any suggestions.

Subject: Re: 951 Hood Shocks


Hi Larry,
I replaced my hood shocks with the help of a friend who put in the pin,
and I'm not very strong.  It's all in the technique.

I used my upper body strength rather than my arms to compress the shock.
I put my shoulders as close to the top of the shock as possible, elbows 
bent all the way back to my chest, knees also bent, both hands gripping 
the top of the shock, upper body roughly perpendicular to the shock like 
I was hitting a tackling dummy, and facing towards the rear of the car.  
I attached the lower mount of the shock and pressed down using my upper 
body muscles, leaning in as I went (easy part).  Once it's compressed, 
slowly ease up pressure on the shock until the assistant can get the pin 
fitted (hard part).  You could have the assistant guide the shock to its 
fitting.  It will take a few tries... it gives you a pretty good workout.

while 'shock' oozes back out quickly pop other end onto second

The 914 is a much better autox car and IMHO more fun to drive autoxing, you

Subject: Re: timing chain housing oil ...

Hi,
there are a few places where the oil could be leaking from .one of them is
the least expected place.in the middle of the cam housing on the back
side.you will notice there is nothing there except what looks like glue or
epoxy.It is not uncommon for the strain inside the sproket erea to pull on
the shaft that is epoxied to this erea and get a pin hole leak.
If it is a leak between the cam tower and the chain housing you will need to
remove it all,sprocket,chain,tensioner,dowel pin,etc.
there is a rubber -O- ring that goes around a backing plate and a gasket
samwiching it to the cam tower,and these go over the camshaft and this can
only be acheived by getting every thing else out of the way.

After all is put back together the cam timing needs to be put back in
spec.Even if you could put the dowel back at the same spot on the spline you
would'nt get what you had prior.even with the dowel pin in place the timing
adjustment is able to mis adjust.0 7-.010 MM
Best advise is to check the opposite side and match it to spec.
If it is wrong valve slamming is possible,and off cam timing.

Just some caution

I have been one of the victims of this "easily changed" hood shock
directive.  I did not break the windshield, but managed to ding the metal
insert in the windshield gasket.  The old shocks came off after some effort
because they were already shot.  The problem I faced was that I could not
get the new ones compressed enough to install on the brackets.
Consequently, the hood is held up with a vise grip on shock method.  Any one
have a workable solution short of asking Arnold S. for help?

Subject: A bummer!!!

I'm getting over the psychological trauma, and am able to talk about
it now:  my '72 911T was in an accident a couple of days ago.  It
wasn't all that much -- I ran into a car stopped on the freeway,
probably about 25 mph -- but it looks as though the car may be 
totaled (bent frame).  Official word will come when State Farm gets
out to look at it.

I'm suffering withdrawal.  What do I do now?  I've had the car for
about 7 years.  I've tried to think what I should buy if I have to
replace it.  So far I don't have a desire for anything different from
what I had, unless maybe a '73.5 with CIS.

I'm obviously pretty bummed out.  Any suggestions?

Subject: Want my title/DONE

Thank you in part to the info that was given by many porschephiles and over
experienced legal counsel, to the delema of the Vt dealer that refused to
release my title for a 1993 RS america I purchased through him, from the
insurance.
you may recall I mentioned that after I paid him in full he delivered the car
but not the title.Only later to demand more money and even more money with no
resolution ,and would not return the money either. He felt after some thought
that he had sold the car to cheap. and was holding me hostage for more
money.I gave in,only to have the dealer request more money to get my
title.(this was going in circles).I had only his misrepresented bill of sale
that state an even higher selling price than the verbal agreement,after
payment in full was received.
To make a long story shorter  I filed a formal complaint with the District
attorney's office and one at the attorney general's office.They inturn
investigated the matter  and put the RMV to this case.
This is the first time I have ever had satisfaction with the regestry in my
life and probalby the first time they ever did what they should have done
from the beginning.(when is the last itme you said the RMV realy helped me
out).They ordered the dealer to release the title or give up dealer wrights
and licenses.he refused so they did.
So they raised the heat even more.to cite them for other violations and fines
and penalties and finally broke him down.
How ironic to look at the new bill of sale on his copy and see paid in full
afterall,Not to mention the date of  07/22/94 on the old bill of sale
and get the new one with 07/22/95(exacty one year)

Thank you to all those  gave advise ,even the one about planning a murder of
the dealer. it souded good at the time.I shouldn't say that ,if something
happens they could use this article against me.Look at O.J.

Hi All,

A common question that I see every now and again concerns the lifespan of 944
Turbos. At last weekend's Metro NY AutoX I met a guy who owns an 88 944 Turbo
S. He has 140K miles on it! It is still a daily driver. According to him, he
even has the original water pump! The only thing he had to replace was the
clutch, at 90K. I think that the shocks need to be replaced, judging from the
way the car leaned in the autox, but it did not smoke, burn oil, or leak
anything. The interior was worn, but the paint was still in good shape. All
in all, I hope my car can last the long!

Subject: 914 2.0 has Miss when COLD.

Hello All...thanks for suggestions...I still have problem but other areas 
have improved.  Here is what I've done/know up to now.

1) SPARK...good at all 4 cylinders,timing + ignition components all good
2) INJECTORS..all tested, confirm they don't leak, and work properly when
   triggered by good signal.  Have not checked fuel pressure.
3) TRIGGER POINTS..confirm good ON/OFF every 180 degress rotation on each
   side at connector.  Measured 1 Ohm resistance across "A" to Common &    
   "B" to Common when points closed...Points clean and no pitting.
4) HARNESS..checked continuity between ECU connector pins and trigger 
   points pins...good. Checked continuity between ECU pins and INJECTOR
   LEAD pins (all 4) ....good.
5) INJECTION SYSTEM...testing injectors showed no fuel delivery (when 
   cold) on #1 & #4, but good delivery on #2 & #3.  When engine warms up,
   I get smooth strong responsive performance.
6) VACUUM LINES... all checked/replaced/or trimmed back to "good"  
   rubber..noticed idle moved up quite a bit when all known "leaks" 
   blocked
7) IDLE ADJUSTMENT..noticed adjustment on throttle body was set already 
   for lowest setting.. MIXTURE ADJUSTMENT on ECU was maxed out RICH 
   (clockwise).  Have left each of these alone to keep the missing 
   problem (which only recently cropped up), isolated and as simple as 
   possible. 
8) GROUNDS...found ground at case seam near flywheel...disconnected,  
   cleaned all corrosion on connector and block reinstalled...no change.

Questions:

1) How can I check the signal while engine running at each injector with
   only the use of a digital multimeter?
2) How can I check the ECU in or out of the car to see if it is doing its
   job? (I don't have a spare known "good" one to swap out)
3) (UNRELATED QUESTION)..my '76 2.0 with Cat convertor has a sensor   
   plugged into it.  Is this a Lambda sensor?  I don't see any mention of 
   it in my Haynes manual. 
4) RELATED QUESTION...SPECIFICALLY which book has a good diagnostic guide
   to help me out here.  Factory manuals I have for other German Cars   
   don't help very much in model specific diagnostics.

I'd appreciate any ideas or leads any of you have...so far most advice 
has been SPOT ON and am hoping to glean more of these precious NUGGETS.

Subject: Know a Good Porsche Mechanic??

Can anyone tell me if there is a good, reliable and reasonable-cost Porsche
shop within one hour drive of Rhode Island??

I have experienced bad service, poor work and overpriced repairs during my
last four years of track events with my 911, using four different shops and
paying out over $30,000. In the past, the first shop (RI) repaired my
transmission, and it leaked. The second (CT) replaced transmission and new
clutch ( orginial from Germany). Then a clutch rivit came out, he wanted to
charge me again for the same work. 

In 1994, I used Autosports Designs (NY) which advertises in Pano (page 84
June) saying "How many mechanics have worked on your Porsche?" and stating
that they did great work. Hoping these claims were true,  I had them put in
a new (used 21,000 miles) Carrera engine from a wreaked car and do some
suspension work, and add their custom chip in the fall of 1994. First day, I
asked for an estimate, but did'nt get one for 2 months - after Autosports
had already purchased the engine. The total bill was $21,000 paid in Dec 1994. 

Then this year, June 4, the engine failed due to a bent valves while
accelerating to the rev limiter at Watkins Glen. Upon calling Autosports,
they wanted my car brought in ($500 flat bed charge for their associate's
truck), and they could determine what caused the valve to bend ( Overreved
because of bad chip? Or was the engine bad by being overeved before be taken
out of the wreaked car, or maybe by me in May?)  And, after getting my car
in their shop, Autosports said they were too busy to get it fixed right
away, but could do it by end of June. I waited and called every week and
finally got an estimate for $3,000-$4000 (plus transport and taxes) on June
29, and a promise to fix it by mid-July. Now July 28th, the engine is still
in pieces, and won't be fixed for awhile..Autosports now says reason for
bent valve- "overreved engine". Is this great service or what?? Spending
$25,000 with Autosports, and getting treated like a "mushroom" (keep in the
dark - and feed manure).

I am discouraged. What would you do if you were in my position?? Is this the
type of service we all have to expect in car repairs? Can anybody suggest a
better alternative within 50 miles of Rhode Island??

Subject: 911C4 clutch damper problems

My boss has a C4 with a clutch problem.  Some liquid filled damper goes rather
quickly I guess.  Rather than put back in the same parts with the same failure
possibility, he wants to try the RS clutch/flywheel arrangement.  It's cheaper
too.  Anyone have driving experience with this clutch/flywheel.  His (and my)
mechanic says it has a pretty different feel.  Much lighter in weight, more 
revvy, he wonders if it will suit the driver on the street.

Thanks,

Hell method: 
get one 'shock' on (hood rases enough?) 
second one must be attatched at one end and carefully forced into  
compression against convienient spot on sheet metal
(push hood down to commpress--tricky)

while 'shock' oozes back out quickly pop other end onto second

"Makes me almost wish for more on tires, wheels,

Well as a Porsche Neophyte (236 porsche miles), I
have a '71 911T 2.2 and would like to know what
kind of gas and oil to use in it.

As for gas- I use the highest octane possible.
 Is this necessary?  The car had been fitted with
an MSD 6A ignition system by a PO.

Concerning the oil, the manual calls for SAE10
during freezing weather and SAE 30 during warmer
weather.  Sounds to me like SAE 10w30 should do
the trick.  Am I correct?

Lastly, I have 14" wheels on the car now.  The
manual specs out 15" with an option of 14"
wheels.  Then, 15" wheels ought to work- right?
 And what are 'FUCHS'- the original Porsche 5
spoke rim that kinda looks like a crager.  I've
noticed some for sale on this list and wonder if
I should have been paying attention.

Absolutely last, what is the aspect ratio on a

something wider like a 205?

Subject: Re:  Floor Clutch

The clutch is hydraulic. There is a master cylinder, fed by the same
reservoir that feeds the brakes, and a slave cylinder, down near the
bottom of the clutch housing. If either one is leaking, it may act
like that. Check whether your brake fluid has gotten real low. Also,
yu can check around the slave cylinder for brake fluid - in
particular, if you remove the rubber plug in the bottom of the
clutch housing you can stick a finger in and feel around for brake
fluid. If you're lucky, it will be the slave cylinder - it is much
easier to change, since nothing is in the way of access to it. The
clutch also needs to be bled, just like brakes, if there is any
air in the circuit (and your symptoms mean that there probably is).

Subject: Re: HELP!!!!! Should I fear the 2.7L?


I've owned a 2.7 for 20 years, and after a new case and pistons at
66,000 it's been pretty good.  I just had a new, more efficient a/c
system installed, and on the way to Fresno from Anaheim over the ridge
the temperature never went above 225, and mostly stayed around 190 in
hot weather with the a/c on.

If you change to an 11-blade fan with the 76-77 pulley ratios, this
will make a nice difference in engine cooling.  My '75 had the
11-blade fan, but it operated at a slower speed.  So if you have a '74
or '75 you'd be better off with the later pulleys.

If I had it to do over again when I had the rebuild in the mid-80s,
I'd have swapped for a 3.0 (there was no 3.2 then).  But since I
didn't, I've been determined to make the existing engine last.

All things being equal, you'd be better off with an SC.  But
frequently things aren't equal.  IMHO, I'd rather have a 2.7 that's
been meticulously maintained rather than a later car that's been
abused.  Condition of the body is, IMO, the most important thing.
Everything else can be replaced.

Craig- I don't recall it being called a "Wonder Vent" but I bought a product
from Performance Air about two years ago for my 1985 BLACK coupe in Georgia.
It replaces the stock air "deflector" that is under the dash, forward of the
gear shift. Installation is straightforward, you basically cut a second hole
in the ducting and cover everything with a dual air vent.  You now have
twice the volume of marginally cool air coming out. It still won't make the
A/C cold. (How come the cheapest  American or Japanese cars on the road can
accomplish this but not Porsche?) But it does bring an improvement. It's
definitely worth the $30-$50 cost.

Well, after several months the beast is back on the road with a new motor!
I fired it up last night and drove it around the block!
The new motor runs much better than the first one.

The challenging:
    Working in a carport in an apartment complex.
    Getting the exhaust off and the intake manifolds on.

The ultimate bummer:
   Having the original motor and my tools ripped off when the motor was 
      about 90% rebuilt. How does that old saying go in Latin, 
      "don't let the bastards grind you down" (no permite que illegitum 
       le carborunden or something like that?)

The bizarre:
   The management of my apartment complex threatening to tow my 
      non-running 911 away two days before I got the motor back in.
   The automatic sprinkers coming on and dousing all my tools,
      manuals, and parts (e.g. distributor cap and wires, air filter)
      just as I was getting ready to fire up the new engine,
      as I was cranking the engine to get oil pressure

Subject: Re: 2.7 L problems

Hi David,

Lots of answers huh?

Did the shop ever do the valve job?  Well so much for history.  You will 
be doing one now!  When the pistons hit the valves the shock is 
transmitted to the stem but not in a longitudinal manner. (in line with 
the valve stem)  Instead it bell shapes the ends of the valve guides.  I 
have some interesting "s" shaped valves in a bucket downstairs to illustrate.

The pistons can actually take quite a beating.  If you wish or are so 
inclined you can have them magnifluxed for cracks and such at you local 
aircraft repair facilities.  I would guess that your camshafts needed to 
be carefully indexed especially after you had them reground.  A lot of 
mechanics look at the illustrations in the repair manuals and reassemble 
the engine according to how it looks.  Most pictures come from the 
factory manual and have the dimples in the end of the camshafts pointing 
down.  Well there is a lot more to it.  If the camshaft is not indexed 
properly or is timed late in the crankshaft cycle the exhaust valves hit 
the pistons.  The 2.7 motor cis piston had a big dome on it for emission 
purposes.  I would guess that you have this piston.  I don't know what it 
looks like with the valve depressions in it but you might now have 
adequate valve clearance.  Valves seem to stretch at higher rpms.  
Actually they just hang there till the spring snaps them back.  

There are several choices for replacement pistons.  Your choice of 
camshafts at this point may be dictated by your selection of CIS.

When timing your cams, try for the middle of the valve lift.  This will 
give you the safety of a little extra clearance for the piston.

Good luck in all of you endeavors.

Subject: Help!  Can't get oild thermo out!

Hi,

	Well, I was taking the general list advice and tried to remove the
oil thermo for testing.  Damn thing won't come out!  Is there some trick
to this?  The manual is almost, but not quite, totally unlike useful. 
"Remove the oil thermostat.  Installation is the reverse of this procedure.
Share and Enjoy!"

	Any timely help would be much appreciated!

	I wait with bait breath.

Guys, correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Parade start Sunday night at

Find another dealer. The information you have been getting from that one is
false. Just now I yanked down my 8 volume 928 set purchased 11-91 from Jim
Ellis, Atlanta (isn't it great when you tape the receipt inside the front
cover?). FYI, list price was $283.86, much much less than automobile book
specialists wanted.

Volume 1, page 15-6g (fist example I happened upon) is a table discusing
camshafts in various models. In addition to listing engine/transmission
pairs they often spell out, "USA, Japan, Canada" on some, and "R. o. W."
(Rest of World) on others, sometimes it says, "All". Also they often tag
the data with model years. This is typical thruout the manual set.

Its likely you can not purchase European camshafts thru your Porsche
dealer, but that's not the issue here. Timing belt, tensioner, etc, are
going to be the same. Its the European emissions stuff that we can't get
here. You do need to check the belt type, between 1982 and 1983 the belt
changed from square teeth to rounded teeth (I think I got that right) and
most with the old design update to the new pulleys.

Conclusion: There are no "domestic 928 manuals", only a single whole world
model with yearly updates.

	I guess it was a case of premature exasperation :)

and it came out faster than a welfare baby :)

	Now for the test: Is water OK to test it in??   My SO might object to

There is always the possibility of a cold solder joint or other intermittent
connection in the brain.  Just as likely culprits are the wiring and the
distrubutor points.  
1. Check wiring carefully for loose connections; since it's two at the same
time, check the ground returns on the block under the intake box.
2. Pull the distributor and measure the continuity of the two sets of points
as you slowly (and repeatedly) rotate the rotor.  I don't know the required
duration, but it is something a little over 180 degrees; and they should be
equal.
3. Pull the breaker points and carefully inspect everything.
4. If that fails, I will rent you another brain for troubleshooting.  I'm not
sure I have an extra extra to sell, but will check if you need it.
I also have all other EFI parts, many for sale.

I am a rare lucky individual 914 owner who has one of those neat testers.

Howdy,

	OK, I just tested the thermo in water that was just a tad over 180.

	Of the two "shuttles" the top one closes and the bottom one opens.  Is
this normal behavior?  If not, what is?

	If this is normal behavior, then what do I look for next to determine

	Also, where are the grounds that I should look for.  Since the guage
jumps a bit (all of them do) when I turn the lights on, I was told it
was a bad ground.  Where? I asked.  I dunno, we'll have to take a look

	Is this a dash thing?  Could it be remotely connected to the gas and

My 1971 2.2 L owners' mannual calls the front the "front compartment or (more

engine compartment.

There is no mention of trunk or hood in the mannual. So what about the version

Sorry if my prior memo was redundant.  I am new here, and this is the first I
have seen of your problem.

You can't check inj signal with DVM.  You will see only the slightest wiggle
of a digit.  An Oscilloscope will do the job, however.

No way to check the ECU, but with tester like mine, or swapout.

That's not a Lambda sensor in you CAT; that's a thermo switch wired to a
relay in the rear trunk that lights a lamp on the dash.

The Haynes manual is all I have.  It doesn't matter much, as German
schematics are a bitsch to read, anyhow.  (Bitsch is the German name for a
town just across the border in France.  It's Bitche in French, as I
remember.)

Their schematics are wonderful compared to their fuses.  
Those fuses are one of the worst designs of the Industrial age.

You COULD get brave and pull the brain out of the box, and look for a spot of
corrosion or other mechanical intermittent...
Electrical circuits don't fail for electrical reasons, but for mechanical
reasons..

Get an 80lb oil pressure gauge and mount it either in the engine room, or
under the dash.  It will tell you amazing things when you have any kind of a
failure.  It will even alert you to a minor fuel leak before it becomes
hazardous.  30lb is the nominal pressure.

Car won't run?  If there's no fuel pressure, you have EFI problem.
                      If good fuel pressure, it's probably ignition, etc.

You night also want to check the pedal itself. I had an 83 928S for many
moons, and the clutch pedal snapped once. I didn't do it suddenly however.
It developed a hairline fracture that kept getting bigger and bigger, and
at times would exhibit the behavior you describe: stick to the floor, I'd
pull it up..of course I couldn't engage the gears because the clutch was
never really out: only the pedal was. But if I changed the angle on my
foot, I could get it to work. Anyway, this may not be your problem, but its
something you may want to keep in mind.

As an aside, I know from experience (story to follow) the clutch
fluid/brake fluid reservoir can get REAL low before you lose the clutch;
Sean's problem is probably in the slave cylinder.

Good Porsche story:

I was driving my 83 928S across the country, and I was returning home to
the Bay Area after having driven to Key West. On the way, I had my 60K
service at Champion in FL, which had on display a brand new (this was
awhile ago) gunmetal 959, the first one I had ever seen. I was stunned.

On the way back, I had just crossed the Arizona border when I ran over a
piece of metal in the road which, unbeknownst to me, had ripped the brake
lines off the car. I heard the crunch/clang, and I assumed some damage had
been done, but I had no idea how severe. I was closing fast on the
checkpoint and I said to my self, y'know, I'd better check the brakes
before I have to actually use them. The pedal sank to the floor
immediately. Oh shit, I thought. I'm doing 80, about to get to the
checkpoint, and I have no brakes. So I started easing off the gas, and
using the e-brake, which fortunately works quite well. I managed to stop,
and, confident in my e-brake, made for the nearest phone. I looked
underneath the car and sure enough there were dangling, mangled brake
lines. I called the nearest Porsche dealer, which happened to be Phoenix,
and told them the sit. I was about an 1 1/2hrs away, and I decided to risk
it. They said that as the fluid drained away I would eventually lose the
clutch, so DON'T pump the brakes at all, and try not to use the clutch.
Great. The freeway part was OK, although it was unnerving knowing that if
an emergency sit came up I couldn't stop, but Phoenix traffic was a
nightmare. BIG following distance and hand on the e-brake constantly. The
dealer couldn't fix it. No brake lines in the country, because "this sort
of thing never happens". Fortunately, we discovered only one line haad been
severed, so they (at my insistence) welded shut that line at the
distribution block, leaving me with 3 wheels braking. So much for Porsche's
cross circuit braking, which assumes that the brake lines are still intact.
I made it home to SF, and had to wait awhile for the lines to come in from
Germany. I had the rotors changed at the same time, and that was about as
exciting as it ever got in the Porsche.

Thjanks for bearing with me,
Nick

Hi David;

I just bought a child booster and I can't recall at the moment which brand
it is.   The name Century does ring a bell, however.   Is the seat blue
cloth, wide, with a 4 point safety harness, and a flat bottom?  Also, does
it have two black safety belt clips near the shoulder area?  If it is, then
the seat does NOT fit the back of my 911.   The bottom of the booster is
too wide to fit in the bottom seat portion.    If you put a small pillow to
flatten out the 911 seat bottom, it might fit.  I haven't tried.   Also, my car
does not have the 3-point harness in back seats.  I'd like to retrofit some
if this is possible to make it safer back there.  

To make room in back, I removed the seat backs from the car.  This helps
a lot and it looks less cluttered.

Let me know,  I'd like to get a solution to this problem.   I'd like to bring my
whole family with me when I go for Sunday morning rides.  BTW, my son

If memory serves me correctly, this upgrade really only does something
substantial on a pre '86 911, since the ventilation system was upgraded
starting with the '86 model year.  

On a related topic, does anyone have any experience with the "Liquid
Modulator" from an A/C specialty company in Texas (the co. name
escapes me at the moment)?  This device replaces the receiver-dryer
with the "Liquid Modulator".  Supposed to lower temps, increase air
volume, and decrease pressure, and is also R134 compatible if you want
to make that switch ...I wouldn't at this point.  Comments, anyone?

I am looking for a little extra room for my rear ties and wide rims.  I did
the baseball bat routine and cracked the paint on both fenders and got in
return some clearance, but not much.  I want to put steel 916 flares at the
back, but they are outrageously expensive ($800/pr).  I recall seeing an
article in VW Greats or some other car mag that someone welded either a
Turbo or SC flare onto the skinny haunces of the 914.  Anyone tried this?
Will the SC flares fit without much trouble?  The Turbo and SC flares are
less expensive and will get the job done!

I've had dealings with Whale Tail 4 or 5 times, mainly for my S.O.'s 951 and 
my brother in law's 924 and service has always been fabulous. If they have 
the part, they're great. They're not, however, quite so great at calling you 
back if they have to try to find the part, so I haven't gotten much for my 
914 from them. They have specialized in used water cooled parts in the past. 
OTOH, my brother in law got some new rotors (not in stock when order 
placed)last week and they only took a week or so to arrive, so maybe they're 
getting better at that sort of thing. Anyway, I'd definitely give them a 
call. A guy named Randy runs it and is a friendly, competent individual. 
Prices are always good, he seems to know exactly how much you could get any 
given part for just about anywhere, and can match it. Good luck

Subject: Teaching lessons...

I don't want to start this thread back up but I have been trying to 
post this and it hasn't been reaching the list (at least not the 
digest.)  It did take me a while to write it so I'm going to try one 
more time.

Here's a trick that I like to use when I'm stuck behind a rather slow 
driver in the wrong (for their speed) lane.

Usually, along with myself, a long line of cars get stuck behind this 
driver and their "pace car" to their immediate right (correct lane 
for their speed).  As most of us know we can, eventually, find a way 
to get around the offending person, almost always by passing on the 
right.  

Here's where the lesson teaching begins.  You are now ahead of the 
offending driver with most of the "line" still behind him/her.  
Instead of just powering off (happy to finally be rid of this 
nuisance), slowly (no need to be dangerous here) get off the gas and 
slow down.  This will take a minute but one of the "pace cars" is 
sure to come past on the right.  When this happens the offending 
driver will always (and I mean always) jump into the right lane to 
pass you!  (This is where it gets fun.)  Now, you get on the gas, 
carefully, so as to keep that line of cars behind you without any 
significant gaps.  This will effectively leave the offending driver 
stuck behind the "pace car" until the entire line has passed.

This procedure works very well and can be orchestrated very casually 
without any dangerous or drastic maneuvers.

Good luck!

Subject: Value of an '88 911

As I continue to search for the perfect 911 for me, I found one that I will
be looking at over the weekend.

The car is a black/black '88 911 Targa with front and rear spoilers.  The
current (second) owner bought it 4 years ago with 15K miles and only added
about 4K miles more.  He says that the car doesn't have a scratch or
ding, was religiously maintained and has a complete maintenance history since
the car was new.

Assuming all of this is true, I would expect this car would cost more
than an average '88.  Anybody know what a reasonable price would be?
Also, is there anything specific to an '88 that I should watch out for?

Hi all,

This message is confined largely to the SF Bay Area 'philers, sorry!

I know L&S has a legendary reputation in dealing with air-cooled cars, but
do any of you water-cooled guys and gals take your car there?  I'd like to
hear your experiences just the same.  For months I've been contemplating
the "chip" issue with my 951, but there seems to be an endless supply of
aftermarket parts and I don't know where to go or what to buy.  I see all
these ads in Excellence for 400hp 944 turbos...but at what cost ( more $$$
and less reliability?). I just got off the phone with Harry Shorman and his
argument that all these modifications MAY complicate reliability rang true
with me...especially since my car has 94,000 miles on it.

So, I guess I'd just like to know if their "old-world" method, if you will,
of servicing Porsches is really the way to go if I'm not prepared to fork
out the big bucks, which I'm not, I just want to keep the car running as
reliably as possible.

So please, please send me any thoughts on Lukes & Shorman.  Thanks!

Furthermore when I asked about maintenance

There are many people out there like this, and of course, if you become a 
Porsche mechanic, you may well have the chance to do something similar to 
what was in Road & Track a couple months ago... three bugs (nothing else) 
sitting at a garage that says, "Radiator Repair" You could of course, 
tell them that water pumps are impossible to find for 911s (which isn't a 
lie), and offer to take it off their hands for real cheap. Hehehe... 

Just remember, there a whole mix of owners of all types of cars, Porsches 
just happen to have nearly all types. This guy is not obviously concerned 
about his precious German metal (or American fiberglass as the case may 
be) as most of us are. So what? He's probably back looking at you, 
wondering how come you don't have a convertible, slammed to the ground, 
fuschia, with 10 trillion watt quadruple amp 10-disc CD changer in the 
trunk 928. There are different things to do with your Porsche, that's 
just one of them. There are always three basic categories for cars: 
stock, custom, and race. Now, you hath seen the custom with an ignorant 
owner. I'm sure everyone has seen the sotck with original owner, and race 
with ignorant owner... harder to find, but they are out there.

Hi Brian:

I said yesterday that I'd look further into your prob. last night...but a
friend had me drive out of town to look at a vehicle with him so I'll have
to go with whhat I have at my office. There seems to be lots of advice for
you this morning though. 

I'd first pull the computer connector plug and check to see if all
connectors are making good contact, clean with electrical contact cleaner, etc. 

Especially check the wiring for the 2 injectors that aren't functioning
properly. My wiring diagram (turns out I have it here at my office) shows
pins on the computer connector 3, 4, 5, and 6 go to the injectors (it isn't
specific as to what # corresponds to which injector). The white wires on the
fuel injection system should correspond to these numbers so it should be
pretty clear.

As for the advice to bake and freeze the board, well...I suggest instead to
pull the case apart, inspect the guts for obvious probs., then while it is
apart, plug it back into the harness and lay it on some cardboard or
something non-conductive to protect it. Get a can of freeze-spray from a
electronics supply place (or borrow some from Tandem), start the car, and
then selectively freeze-spray small areas of the board to try to isolate the
prob. (Use a hot hair-dryer to isolate hot-running failures).

Good luck...post your progress

Unfortunately you are right, I just remembered another conversation I had on
the phone with a guy who was trying to sell his 928.  I was calling for my
roommate and I let the guy go on and on describing the car for sale.  When
he was done I told him that I was calling for a friend and that I was familiar
with the 928 because I have one.  He said, "yes, but mine is V8!"  and from
then on he threw V8 in every other sentance like the V8 was an option on the
928.  I have a feeling that someone coached him on what to say to people when
they called (the guy didn't speak english very well).  He was also telling me
that it was not an "S" even though he was insisting that it was a 1984 model.
I said "OK..." and politely bid him goodbye.  In retrospect I suppose I could
gotten a really cheap 928S for my roommate, but at the time I was turned off
by the guy's cluelessness.

* Orange(Tangerine, Blutorange!, etc.)/black -> other color

* The more original the better.

Or you could try something else:  A guy in Fremont (I think his name
is Bob Cross) slits the fenders along the top, spreads them, and welds
in a filler panel.  I've seen one car done this way, and it looks
pretty good.  The rear light buckets have to be moved out, so a new
panel is made for "under" the trunk lid.

You have to view the car at just the right angle to figure out how
he got such big tires on the car.

If there's more than a mL or two of oil on the cover, I'd be surprised.
There's a lot more "old" oil on the inside of the case.

But I do it anyway.  And seeing as how it's a NARP, I clean the screen

I have a copy of the book, bought it about a year ago, the title is

Also says: Copyright 1991 Quintet Publishing Limited.  
This must have came out in Great Britain first, then imported to the

cost me between $12.00 - $20.00, don't remember for sure.

The best/worst "personalized" plate I have seen resides on the back of my El
Camino, KID 69U.
 
I say "personalized" as this was NOT a personalized plate, just what I was
dealt when I last renewed.
 
I didn't even realize it until a clerk at a gas station asked for my license plate 
number.  I had to go back outside to check, got a good laugh and NO, I didn't not 
give her the right number!
 
Since then I have seen several KID 69x plates so I guess this series just
slipped by the "censors".

Subject: Options for distributer for 356

My father owns a 64 356 C which he mainly uses for commuting 2 or 3 days a 
week.  He had noticed a loss of power lately and recently rebuilt the carbs
(Zeniths) which helped a little, but it was still down on power.  Since the
engine for my SC is out of the car, he swapped distributers, and claims it
now runs like a new car.  He thinks he needs a new (or rebuilt) distributer,
since he has messed with this one a lot in the past and had no luck.  [Also,
the distributer he has now is NOT a Porsche distributer but a fairly common 
VW and/or Audi model].

	So what are his options?  He is balking at the prices he has seen,
and wonders:
	
	Whats a cheap place to buy a new one?  Tweeks is the lowest I've seen
		so far at about $430 and Stoddard is about $550 or so.
	What's a good source for rebuilt or rebuildable, and what should he
		expect to pay?
	Are there other distributers that work OK in this engine (e.g., is 
		his not working _because_ its an Audi distributer, or is it
		just shot, and if not would another non-Porsche distributer 
		fix him up?).   This distributer has been in the car for many 
		years so I'm assuming it worked OK at some time.  The only 
		reason I know it's not a P-car distributer is that I remember
		that I always have to take the points in to get new ones and

I will probably get some strange looks from most of you for what I am going
to ask, but here goes. Have any of you other 914-nuts ever thought about
doing a speedster conversion to a 914? I have seen several 914's converted
to cabriolet configuration. They look good, but wouldn't a speedster
configuration look great? I have been obsessed with the idea for months
(I even made up drawings).

So are any of you interested in such a thing? Has anyone ever done/seen such
a thing? Do any of you think a 911-speedster windshield and frame could be
addapted (like the ones sold for 911-speedster conversions)? I don't know
the difference in width and base contour between 914 and 911 windshields.
Do any of you know? A custom windshield would be expensive to have fabricated
, but then again this whole thing sounds like a lot of expensive fabrication
 (side glass,top,etc.), but I still want to do this. 

Any comments or suggestions welcome, just no flames please (I would never do
this to a collectable 914.).

Craig, if you are going to install new speakers in your car I strongly
recommend you listen to the ADS 300i speakers. GREAT car speakers, in my
opinion. I have a relatively old model on the door panels that are fairly
large and makes cranking the windows up and down hard, but the sound is
superb. I believe the newer versions of the same ADS speakers are smaller,
or at least they go flush with the door panel.

Good luck,

Subject: 944 - Strange noise driving me crazy

After my '86 944 warms up, (5-10 mins), I can hear a FAINT tapping sound at
a rate
of about 4+ Hz when the engine is between 2800 - 3200 rpm, loudest at around 
3000 rpm. The best way I can describe it is that it sounds like a mix between a
'gurgle' and a 'tap'. My initial tests show the following:

1.  No tapping sound until the car has warmed up

2.  Pressing in the clutch with the car rolling along in neutral, the sound
goes away.
     (Of course, the rpms drop.) Also no sound if clutch released, rolling
in neutral.

3. At stoplights in neutral and revving to 3000 rpm, I can SOMETIMES hear
the sound
    but rarely and more faint than if driving.

4. On arrival at home and revving to 3000 rpm, I can't make the sound happen
even
    when listening at the front of the car with the hood open.

5. Once warmed up, the sound is always there at around 3000 rpm, if engine under
    load. Can also hear it if coasting in gear, with the engine at around
3000 rpm.

6. Can't smell any exhaust fumes leaking.

7. Rate of sound increases with rpm 

8. Cam/balance belt recently (2000 km ago) replaced and tensioned with 9201
tool.
 
What's driving me nuts is that I can't re-produce the sound when the car is
stopped,
with the engine running and can only hear it when the car is moving.

Any ideas?

911 parts manual, 71
911/912 supplement for 69
914 parts manual up to 73

These came from a Porsche dealer that  dropped the marque about a year ago, 
and this stuff was recently unearthed.  There are two copies of some of the 
items.  What's this stuff worth?

I had just decided I was going to put to together as complete a collection 
of paint color samples as I could find.  What luck.... in with all this 
stuff was (was... because they live at my house now) paint, carpet, vinyl 
samples and charts from 1970-1992!  Also in the pile was a parts product 
knowledge binder and 91 and 93 order guides for all models.  Hoo boy!

Anyway, the parts manuals will be available to Porschephiles first, as soon 
as I can put a value on this stuff for him.

Hi,

I'd like an in-car lap timer for track-events, and since I'm going to
the west-coat for a holiday I wanna pick one up there somewhere along the
coast.

So the question is, where to buy one that's reasonably priced. I want
the type that has a transmitter on the track and a panel in the car.

Any ideas, hints, suggestions, used ones, new ones, anything?

Hi Christian,

The Racer's Group/Performance Wholesale sells "Hot Lap" in-car timing 
systems.
This is the official timing system of the POC/Zone 8 PCA.  They offer a 
PCA/POC discount.  They advertise in Pano and Excellence.  I have one and am 
very pleased with it.  You can buy the transmitter and receiver separate or 
as a package.

It was a nice sunny Sunday afternoon, and I was driving the U-boat (83-928)
into work for awhile. The road to work ends with a nice windey road with
about 3.5 miles of great quick turns, short straights, and a few downhill
reverse camber to keep things lively. I was cruising along and I found
myself looking into the rearview mirror at a red convertible Miata, right
on my a**. Middle aged guy and SO out for a nice drive. He kept crowding
me, so I decided to light it up. A couple of turns later he was nowhere in
sight so I slowed back to normal speed. Well, here he comes, hands clenched
on the wheel, eyes fixed. SO was laughing and apparantly having a good
time. So off I went again, slowed again.., and he caught up again. I
finally decided to finish this and blasted off. A mile later I pulled off
to make the turn into my office.The little red Miata convertible went
screaming past, driver had a glazed and frustrated look on his face, and
white knuckles clamped on the wheel. SO was doubled up, with her head on
the door, laughing hysterically. I waved, she waved back, driver kept
going.

Subject: re: Options for distributer for 356

Bob:

I have a 66 912 that had an incorrect distributor in it (A Bosch 009) and was 
told by many experts to get an 050 and also told by just as many experts to stay 
with the original 022.  Well I went for an original 022 (which are no longer 
made).  I bought a used one and bought all the parts from Stoddard to rebuild it 
and spent many hours taking it apart and putting it back together trying to get 
the correct advance curve.  I could never get it right!  I eventually brought it 
to a distributor rebuild shop here in Portland, Or and paid the guy $30 to 
"recurve" the distributor to the correct specs.  I had him cut down the total 
advance to 27 degrees so I would end up with about 31-32 degrees max in the car. 
 The whole thing cost me about $175 and A LOT of time.  It was fun and I learned 
a lot about distributors.  BUT if you are not inclined to go through the hassles 
I would recommend a Bosch 050 distributor.  It's not original but it's cheap 
($60 from Imparts) and I have heard from many experts (The Maestro) that they 
are great.  I also think I could have taken my 009 distributor to the rebuild 
shop and have it recurved to match a 022 advance curve for $30 and been done 
with it!  You can also send a original distributor to Stoddard and they will 
rebuild it and recuve it for about $175.  If you need any more help let me know.

Subject: HELP!!! alt problem 73 911

I'm getting desparate!!!!!  I just spent another 3 hrs trying to solve
my alternator problem with no success.  At least I found the 2 BLUE
wires which are supposed to go to D+ on reg from alt and dash lamp.
They go into a capacitor then come out as the RED wire to D+. The RED
line on D+ comes from the relay thru fuse 2 in the rear fuse block. I
still havn't found where the RED wire th EXC terminal comes from, it's
supposed to be the BLACK wire from alt.

My light comes on with the key, but does'nt go out when the engine
starts. Light will glow dimmer if I drive very far, but that is because
I'm driving off the battery!  The alt was checked out last weekend and
was OK. The reg was new last May.( I've bad this problem this long!!!).
Both reg and alt are Marchal.  ALL grounds are checked and cleaned, I
ran a new ground line from body ground to reg base just to check-- it
was OK, no change.

I have no idea what the capacitor's function is--- probably something
to do with pressure control reg??  Tomorrow I,m going to bypass the
capacitor and hook up the 2 Blue wires straight to D+/61.  Any
advice???  After that I'm going to run a line direct from lash light to
D+!  If that doesn't work, I guess I'll have to pull fan again so I can
wire direct to reg from alt.

I sure could use some info and advice ( moral support).  If anyone has
had a similar problem or knows someone who can help, let me know!!!  I
know the 73 1/2 CIS T is a oddball model, none of my factory parts or
shop manuals show any of this ( at least from what I can figure out
!!).

Thanks from everyone who has helped me get this 22 yr old ( 16 in
storage in a barn?? ) 911 going, it runs great when the bat is up!

The 1971 owners manual state oil consumption to be "1.5 to  2.0 US qts per 600

Rolls Royce makes only engines -- not a major part of an airplane except for
cost.  I will admit, they make some of the best jet engines in commerical
aviation.  One RR was recently removed after 24,000 hours flying without a
major problem.  At, say, 400mph average, that's nearly 10 million miles!  I

  My hood shocks have been weak ever
  since I bought my 928S. Depending on the
  weather, the hood (it's in the front, like 
  it should be :)) will stay up. I had been
  procrastinating getting new ones, when 
  oneday I was at Walmart. They had this 
  little gizmo that works like a hood-stick.
  It clamps around the shaft (male part of 
  the shock) and has a spring loaded stick
  that flips under the female part of the
  shock as you lift the hood. To lower the 
  hood you hold the stick away from the
  female part of the shock and lower. 
  Before this I was also using the broomstick
  method on bad days. The stick part of
  the gizmo comes long, and the package 
  includes a little hacksaw and miter-box so
  that you can fit it to the length of your
  hood shock. It also came with some shims

Since I'm trying to come up with one, I'd appreciate some help.  Porsche

My 79 924 engine is kaput - threw a rod. I am considering two options:

2. Buy a good, used bottom end for about $200 and rebuild it. I believe my

I will replace the motor mounts and other things that make sense when the

would be easier to do and more guaranteed of success, but possibly more
expensive. I have not rebuilt an engine before, but it doesn't look too

Am I missing anything else that should be done?What would you do?

Subject: Prized 944T now running poorly


After enjoying this mail-list for several months, my turn has come to 
ask for HELP!

My 1987 944T suffered the loss of it's alternator last week as I was 
returning to Tucson from Phoenix.  Without going into that 24 hours of 
hell last Friday and Saturday, I'll simply say that I got it to the shop 
where the previous owner always took it for service.

I had been anticipating work on the cam/balance belts, etc...so this
turned out to be the impetus for getting the work done.  I had them
replace the following: 

Alternator
Water pump
Lower balance shaft seals
various rollers, etc.

Total bill: $1400+


Immediately after picking up the car I noticed a lot more vibration as the
engine was wound-up to 3500 RPMs.  My initial thoughts were that the 
belts hadn't settled in (not being experienced in these things)...except for 
the fact that my car was now running _significantly_ HOTTER than before.

I pulled over, called the shop, and spoke with the mechanic.  After agreeing 
over the fact that it was one of the hottest days of the year in Phoenix 
(114), I reiterated the fact that the car had always run 'nice and cool' 
(first hatch mark) on several previous freeway trips when it was 106 to 110 
degrees in June.  I got back in the car and 'nursed' it home....

The car never cooled below the second hash (just short of the RED) for 
the entire 100 mile journey home...the engine constantly resisting 
anything above 2800 RPMs by weakening and vibrating strongly through 
the gear shifter...so I drove it at 60 mph in 5th gear

Finally, I get it to my local Porsche dealer here in Tucson.  Our first 
discovery turned out to be misleading (fuel mixture was set too lean).  
Thinking this solved the problem, they (my shop) told me to come down and 
get my car today...WRONG....

The car heats up rapidly even when _cruising_ at 60 (3000 RPMs) and still
has lots of vibration as the engine goes from 2500 RPM on up.  When we
came to a stop (idle) the car actually began to cool down...and this was
today in Tucson (temp 114).  This behavior is completely backwards from
the way the car normally runs.   

My biggest concern is the 'vibration' and almost 'resistive' feeling that 
the engine is giving...the engine has completely lost the beautiful 
'whirring-purring' smoothness that it had before these guys worked on it.

My mechanic checked over everything they did (cam shaft/belt alignment,
tension, etc...only suggestion he had was that the other shop may have
used the wrong 'key-slot' on the balance shaft(s) for aligning the toothed
rollers.  Should I have him dig into this hypothe$i$ or not?

BTW, my fiancee noticed right away that the car wasn't 'normal' when we test 
drove it today (her first time in it since the alternator went) !  So, it's 
not just me...  ;)

HELP!

That is a good question.  I have asked this same question
far and wide, and all answers have been "no" or "I don't know."

I have come to the conclusion that I should make some.  The
procedure would be to buy an additional set of these wheels
(preferably well used, and at a good price), and cut free the
inside half, at centerline plus an inch or so outward.  Then,
do the same with my good wheels, but cut at centerline plus an
inch or so inward.  Join the two halves, and weld.  Seems it
might be tricky to get alignment of the two halves right, but
I think it's worth a try.

In the effort to find wider wheels for my 928, I have yet to
find some that look as good, in my opinion, as the original
Porsche phone dials.

Uhh... No.  The reason a 914/2.7 can't do 0-60 in 2 seconds is that the

P.S.  One G (absent air friction, etc.) would give you a 0-60 time of

Subject: 5W50 vs 20W50


My 911 has been running way too hot on the track, plus the oil 
pressure seems to move south the hotter it gets. Local P-car 
gurus say that until such time I get an oil cooler, I should be 
using 20W50 oil instead of the 5W50 I currently have. The 
theory is the 5W50 is way too thin, and that the heavier 
weight, while not solving my heat problem, would certainly help 
lower it a few degrees. I don't follow the logic of this. If 
I'm running hard in the dog days of the summer, isn't the upper 
range of viscosity the issue? I could really a second 
opinion(s) on this. Any chemical engineers out there who could 
lend a hand?

Well, the kid did it, just like I thought he would. New hood shocks are now
safely installed on the 951. He connected the bottom end first (ball &
socket), then pushed the upper end down with both hands, and then rotated
the shock toward the clevis allowing the top to expand into position for me
to insert the pin (which I did, expertly). It took MUCH grunt-power to
compress the shocks -- more than I have. Maybe these are new
industrial-strength units for 944 hoods only.

Regarding personalized plates, I always thought the 914 looked like a shoe
box. So, when I got one I also got the plate, SHUBX. Present owner still
has the plate.

Yep, that's it.

One or both of the balance shaft sprockets is misaligned with
the balance shaft itself.

PAG, in its infinite wisdom, decided to use the same sprocket,
but with two different keyways, one for the upper balance
shaft, and one for the lower balance shaft.  If the kid who is
working on your car doesn't know that he can screw it up, he 
most certainly will.  Very common occurrence by second tier shops.

The good shops know how to read the factory service manual (one of two
places where this information is documented - the other being
an article in Excellence by our own Jim Pasha), the prerequisite
being that they do have them. (There, I've said it again, THERE

Hi Bob,

Stan and Scott are both right.  But, I tend to side with Stan.  The 050 is

I suggest rebuilding the original or an alternative.  The 031 is a great dist.,
if you can find a new one that hasn't been used too much.  Check the specs book
for the proper advance curve and go from there.

Stoddard will rebuild you dist. for about $150.00. But, if this only includes
replacing the bushings and shims, well, your no better off.  

I have recently addressed a letter to Bosch, in Canada, requesting information
in regards to the parts that are always wore.  If I can locate the parts that
are always wore, and cause most of the radical advance problems, I'll let you

This is a seemingly good idea, because it is almost illegible, but if
escaping easy memory detection is your goal, then it suffers from a major
flaw: its own illegibility. The witness says, "I didn't see the guy who hit
the old lady, but I remember his plate cuz it was all Ms, Ns, and Ws, and I
couldn't read it." Then the cops have you, because there can't be many

Through this whole thread on scaring other drivers and causing accidents,
there's been no mention of letting other people pass and cheering them on!
Yes, I like to zoom around in my 911 but often don't have the inclination
to be the fastest car on the road. So to those who want to go faster than me
I always look for a place to slow down so they can pass. More power to them!
And an added benefit is that I can drive 1/2 mile behind and locate police
and other road hazards by monitoring their brake lights.

There is a measureable difference in the performance of a NEW or correctly
rebuilt cast-iron distributor and an 050. I'd characterize the 050 as
"adequate" -- it keeps the car on the road, it won't break things from
a too badly wrong advance curve (like an 009 will) and the main problems
are with the curve being wrong in some key places like off-idle and 
about 2500 RPM.

However, as Hairy is quick to point out, odds of finding a good cast iron
distributor are low. Hence the Stoddard rebuild program. Also hence the
need for some quality time with your Sun distributor machine. 

Nonetheless, for relatively cheap you can have the right stuff, as oppsed
to the "get by" stuff. So why not do it right?

I have been told that a lower viscosity oil is somewhat better at scavenging

What sort of oil is the 5W50 you're using?  You might try an oil with a
narrower range.  The shop uses Mobil 1 5W30 in all Porsches, and it is also
an oil which Porsche endorses.

Scott,

I would agree with what George B said: sounds like the balance shaft
pulleys are mistimed.

Your overheating may be a problem with the water pump, and perhaps the
same care given to the balance shaft belt has also benefited the cam
belt, which drives the water pump.

The balance shaft belt timing is easy to see, once you get the timing
belt cover off.  I am surprised that mechanic #2 didn't pick up on that
right away.  Maybe time for a new mechanic.

I think its probably a good idea to do it, although I know a lot of people
with pre-84 cases sometimes or always skip the screen cleaning.  I did one
a few years ago, and the screen came out covered with crud that looked sort
of like finely chopped up trash bag plastic.

I would think that because the screen surrounds both the pick-up pipe and
the drain, if you do not remove it you cannot get the case clear of anything
which doesn't go through the screen.

I'm lucky enough to live on Mulholland Drive, one of the finest driving
roads in the country, and I've lived here for 11 years, so I know the road.
A few years back, I was driving a VW Golf I briefly owned, when a black
Turbo Cab came up on my tail with one of those more-money-than-sense El Lay
drivers... so I thought I'd have a little fun. I downshifted and proceeded
to catch the perfect line, flat out, for the next couple of miles. I
watched in the rear view as this guy charged, dodged, misread corners, made
stabs at passing, and generally seethed when he found he could not pass (I
left the door wide open, but his driving just wasn't up to it). Finally, we
came to the stop sign at a cross street, and as I stopped, he blew past me
at about 80.

Every local with a hot car seems to come up here sooner or later,And I'm
usually in the wrong car to really blow 'em away,  but there's no
susbstitute for driving ability and 'course' knowlege.

It's on the clutch housing itself. It is what actually pushes the clutch
open. I had to have mine replaced once. It's just a small piston in a
bell-type housing. The hydraulic pressure from the master causes the piston
to extend from the casing and press the lever which operates the clutch.
Mine was leaking like crazy and I was having intermittent clutch problems.
When I examined the part, I couldn't believe the whole clutch was engaged
thru this little tiny rod of metal; it seemed so fragile.

it. It took me about 1 1/2 hrs to do about half of a wheel, which is all mine 
needed. Watch the tension you apply, not too much and be prepared to lift the 
edge of the leather a bit so you can get to the hole....

Have fun!!

The first part of the set covers the 911 from 1966 or so up to 1973, they give 
a lot of basic information which is not covered in later volumes, which 
basically only cover the changes from 1973. So you need both sets and need to 
flip back and forth a lot to find what you need to do. 

Not good manuals by any means, but they are better than the rest.

A long shot, but you might check the engine wiring harness. My 2.7 has several 
wires melted together, which tended to make some random shorts which in turn 
caused stuff like the battery to drain one day, the next the alternator light 
wouldn't go out (sounds like your problem??). Only way I found it was when my 
engine was replaced, the good folks at Kremer took it apart and then charged 
me for a new harness as  in their words....it was not acceptable. 

The harness runs inside the blower housing and exits towards the drivers 
side....

Subject: easiest/lazyist oil change on 944

After many years of owning 944's of various models I have perfected what has
to be the easiest and lazyist way of changing oil on these cars. It is also,
happily, the least messy.
First of all the car has to be hot and you have no plans to use it for the
next 6 - 8 hours. I do this at night before contemplating a good nights
sleep. You can customize this step to fit your needs.
Next jack up the right side of the car so that you have access to the drain
plug. Please use a jack stand also. (Don't EVER depend on a jack when you
plan to put your head or other appendages under your car). Take you 15mm
combo wrench with you when you reach under the car. Place the box end over
the drain plug. It will fit between the drain plug and the pan shrouding.
Give the wrench a good push or whack and break the drain plug loose. At this
point have your drain pan handy. Slip the pan under the drain and slowly undo
the drain plug using the open end part of your wrench. The object is to
loosen the plug enough that oil starts to drip out, yet the plug stays in the
pan. 
Continue slowly unloosening until you have a steady thin stream of oil coming
out. (Don't get greedy here, be satisfied with a small stream or a
significant drip)
Crawl out and lower the car as much as possible, without crushing you drain
pan. Next poke a hole in the top of your oil filter so that the oil can drain
into the engine.
At this point you put a container of oil on your drivers seat to remind
yourself that there is no oil in the engine. Then go to sleep to whatever.
Next morning, or whatever, the car gets jacked up, the drain plug completely
removed and the aluminium "O" ring replaced. Tighten up the plug, change the
filter, fill with oil and away you go. Very little effort, no mess and the
sheet metal shrouding is left in place. 
This is not a method for the impatient. Hope it works for you.

Jerry

Subject: 912E can't pass emissions test

I'm having trouble passing the emissions test here in Northern VA with my 
912E. 
 
The car hasn't had the thermal reactors in place since probably when it 
was new. In past years I've leaned it out and it would pass fairly 
easily. however this year I can't get it passed after three trys. 
Obviously there is something a little off which keeps the hydro carbons a 
little too high.  The co2 is OK. Before this last try I put in a new 
rotor and cap, new plug wires, new plugs, and air filter. I switched over 
to Mobil 1, ran it for 200 mi then changed to fresh Mobil 1 and filter. 
The car runs better but my hc were 4.5 with my maximum allowable being 4. 
We tested the hc just before this last state test and they were in the 
2-3 range but 15 min later at the service station they were 4.5. After 
the failed test, 15 min later at the shop the hydro carbons  were in the 
3s again. The state computer test starts at about 2300 rpm  then drops to 
idle. We found that mine does fine at 2300 rpm but when it drops to idle 
it dips for a split second down  lower than the correct idle rpm and then 
bounces back up to idle. At that second the hc jumps up to 6 and takes 15 
sec. to settle back down  to under 4. The state computer takes its idle  
reading before my car can get settled back down. I can't figure out what 
needs work without getting into some costly testing. Any ideas? My next 
alternative is to refit the thermal reactors. 
 
Are there any 912E drivers out there that still use thermal reactors?. 
 
How hot does the eng bay get? 
 
How many of those precious few ponies burn up before getting put to ground?
 
Help, my tags have expired, can't renew without passing emissions test.

Subject: Re: C2 question

Rish,

Like others have said - if the car is not a dog - $26,500 is extremely 
good.  Like you - I was looking for 87-89 Carrera and cam across an 89 C4 
for $27,500 that I had to have.  But, upon mechanical checkout, found 
that the cylinder heads were leaking badly and the front differential was 
leaking.  Also the car was just not well taken care of.  I think it was a 
leased car.

Anyway - they damage had been done and even though I didn't buy the car i 
now had to have a C2/C4.

The earlier years of these cars ( 89 & 90 - I think) had a tendancy to 
have small (and sometimes large) amounts of oil leaking for between the 
cylinder head and cylinder.  Another p-filer (Randy Kirby) and I looked 
long and hard for a car that didn't have the leaks.  And we both ended up 
purchasing cars with the leaks - even though the are very small.  It's 
not a problem unless it is causing a loss of compression.  And some cars 
never have the problem.  People will say that Porsche fixed the problem 
for free  - others say Porsche says it's not a problem.  It just goes on 
and on.  I know in my case that since buying a car with the leak - I 
haven't had second thoughts.  The car burns zero oil and never leaks 
oil.  I know that sounds contradictory - but I never see oil spots in my 
garage and yet I know it is a little wet on the motor.  Go figure.

When you move from a Carrera (..-89) to a C2/C4 the flywheels tend to go 
out.  I don't know the specifics of the problem.  My car had the work 
done prior to me owning it under warranty.

There are also other issues: cracked rear lense, dual distributor belt 
braking.

If the car you see for $26,500 checks out (even with wetness around 
cylinder heads) I think it would be a good deal - to me.  But I paid 
$37,00 for my 90 C4 w/ 46k - a "good deal" is relative to the person.

Good luck - and if I can be of any assistance - drop me a line.

Someone recently posted a query on subject.  Since we're looking for that

agent (Farmers)...

real parameters:  age: 33 (wife 29), homeowner (mortgage payer), Seattle area
(lowest zip code insurance index), no tix, etc.  home, cars, boat insured w/
Farmers.
hypothetical car:  '88 911 Carrera.  to be a third car, driven mostly on
weekends, etc.

the quote:  $1402/six months!!!, 100k/300k liability, 240/500 deductible for
comp/coll.
(before you folks in higher insurance areas start up, remember that Seattle's
low salaries are supposedly justified by the "Mt Rainier factor."  But you
can't eat Mt Rainier or insure P-cars with the view.)
Wow.  we pay $1400/year for our '91 Audi 200q & '89 Honda Accord.  
The kicker:  if I bought a '95 BMW M3, I'd pay $490/six months.  go figure.
 So where the Bimmer costs < 3% of value to insure per year, the P-car is
going to be > 10% per year.  
Agent's interpretation:  they (Farmer's) doesn't want to insure P-cars.  he
also used the work *conspiracy*

Subject: Re: 912E can't pass emissions...

Your idle is dropping too low....

Do you still have that aux air valve in there?  It is an 18" vacuum valve
that keeps the vacuum from going to more than 18".  If that thing is working,
it should keep the rpm from dropping too suddenly, and should help the idle
recover.  Hook up a vacuum gauge and see if you don't get more than 18" on
deceleration.  If it's working OK, try disconnecting it.  Also, be sure you
have no intake air leaks after the airflow sensor.

I have 73 & 76 914 2.0.  The engines are identical to yours, save for the
type of EFI.  The 75-82 VW vans have the AFC EFI like yours,  and my 81
vangon passes ok.  

CAT converters and hot pipes only help with CO, not HC, to my knowledge.  I
had to install a  CAT in my 76, and it dropped the CO from 1.25% to 0.01%,
but did not change the HC, which was OK, both before and after.

Want to save on insurance?  Borrow the money on your house, and pay cash for
the Porsche.  Then you won't have to pay collision/comprehensive, which is
the vast majority of the cost on this class and value of car.

Sure, it would break your heart if you wrecked the car, or if it was stolen,
but it would not bankrupt you.  This is called self-insurance.
If you are relatively confident in yourself, you can do this.  It will also
make you a safer driver, knowing that the bill for carelessness will be all
yours.  The money you save on insurance will pay part of the interest on your
mortgage.

I have always avoided collision coverage, and it has saved me many thousands
over the last nearly forty years of driving, complete with wife and raising
two sons through the hazardous years.  It has cost me a total of maybe $500
for repairs that would have been covered by collision or comprehensive.

I recently bought a wonderfully restored 914 which came with two

previous owner always used.  The other key was virtually unused, 
so it is still a perfect master key.

The problem is that the ignition lock is worn to the point that 
it will only accept the severely worn key, not the like-new one.

Is is possible or practical to have the ignition lock retooled to 
take the good original key?  Or should I live with lock as is and 
try to have the severely worn key copied?

Two weeks ago I asked this great list for advice on brake pads (original

to those whose responded.

 - One vote for Repco Metal Masters (better stopping power, less dust, and less
rotor wear than OEM) estimated price about $30/axle from Imparts
 - One vote for Ferodo AF from Automotion (looked up price $79.95/axle)
 - Two votes for OEM especially for that sale price 
 - One vote for swapping brake pads to carbon track pads whenever going to
spend time on the track, then swapping back to street pads for street (because
I guess track pads need to be heated up before they work effectively)

Thankyou very much,  right now I'm leaning towards the Repco Metalmasters.

Help, I need advice on brake pads.
I need brakes soon for my 86 951.  My car is used mostly as a daily driver on
the street with speeds occasionally over 100 mph.  I have also been to a
driving school at Sears Point, where the car gets driven fairly hard, and I
will probably return someday.  

My question is what are the choices and trade-offs in brake pad brands and/or
materials?  Is there one brake pad material and/or brand that is clearly
superior to all others or are all brake materials pretty much the same?  I
don't consider cost a major factor because of the importance of brakes and the
low frequency in which they need to be replaced, but I don't want to spend
extra money just to get a "brand name" either.  Two choices that I have seen
so far are:  "lifetime guarantee" over the counter Rabestos brakes from a
local Pep Boys for about $38 or OEM brakes on sale from the dealer for a
little over $30.  

Below I have listed the Brake Pad properties that I can think of that might be
important, but unfortunately most of these properties are not specified on the
package or any where else that I know of for the different brands of brakes.
>Coefficient of Friction; cold
>Coefficient of Friction; hot
>Abrasiveness; how fast it wears the rotors
>Conductivity; how fast the pads can conduct the heat away
>Temperature Resistance; how hot it can get before it is damaged
>Durability; how long it lasts ( of course compared to other pads under the
same driving conditions, your mileage may vary)
>Dust; how fast do the wheels get dirty
>Cost
>Availability
>Asbestos or not
>what is the metal in the semi metallic?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I subscribe to the digest so I will
only see responses about once or twice a day.  If you want to respond
directly, my Email address is Nans_Kunz@qmgate.arc.nasa.gov.  If I get a lot

Subject: 993 turbo wait list update

Got your attention, mates?  ;^).

I was out on a bike ride with my 5 year old today and we just
happened to ride by the local P-dealer (purely an accident
I assure you).  We noticed a couple of very nice looking 993
C2 coupes on the lot, but they had plates on 'em.  So I figured
they must be the ones that the sales manager gets to drive.
But there was a sticker on the window.  Puzzled, I looked
at the odo reading on the first one.  2660 miles.  By now
I was totally mystified.  Why would somebody sell a perfectly
good C2 coupe with 2660 miles on it as a used car?  Right
on cue, the sales guy walked up and I asked him what was
going on.  Response:  "His new turbo came in."  How about the
other one over there with 5k miles on it?  Same story.  Oh.

So we got to chatting.  Turns out the wait list for the new
turbo currently extends to the end of next summer.  So you
might as well be driving a new C2 in the meantime, I guess.
Darn, didn't bring my charge card on the bike ride.

But, hey, you can special order a C4 and have it by the end
of November.  He said they were selling a lot more C2's
than C4's.

In case you're wondering, the deal they were offering on the
slightly used ones didn't seem all that great.  I think it
was $3k off the price of the same car new.  But he claimed
you don't have to pay "over $30k penalty" luxury tax on a
used car, so maybe this is a better deal than it seems.
Who knows, maybe there's even room to bargain.  I bet you'll
have no luck bargaining on a turbo, though.  Demand and
supply are way out of balance at this point.

Even for those of us who can't afford a Turbo, this seems
like good news.  Maybe 10 or 15 years from now there will
be lots of nice used 993 turbos on the market that we
can afford.  I'll drink to that!!

I think this really depends on the dealer/area you live in. When I was
looking to order my C4, there was a black/black Turbo available, the first
one the dealer received, because the orderer didn't want it after all. At
the second dealer where I actually ordered my car (in May), they had Turbos
available for September delivery, just one month after my August delivery.
Yes, a lot of the cars are pre-sold (sort of, it just means somebody
plunked down $2K to grab a spot in line), but a lot of cars are refused
when they arrive because of changing desires, financial conditions, etc.
Thus "pre-sold" cars become available to be sold. People just want options.
Look at the M3 situation: pre-sold for 7-8 months at the dealers I've
spoken to, but one of those "pre-sales" is my friend, who may or may not
take the car when it arrives. He just wants the choice, and does not want
to lose the M3 as an option due to a lack of foresight.

George,
Have been meaning to call you on the weekend or at night, but don't get 
around to it. I'll try and remember. I have received your tif file that 
contains a picture of you in front of a building with 10 on the front. Is 
this the only picture? You mentioned other pictures when you sent another 
file which did not have the tif extension. I was not able to do anything 
with it.

If you have negatives for those pictures, send them to me and I'll get you

Ouch!  My stats: I'm 19, three speeding tickets on my otherwise clean 
record, no accidents.  Live in downtown Washington DC.  For my 1987 944S, 
I'm paying $1100/six months for full coverage, no deductible.  Coverage

The long and short of it is that you need to find a company that will 
give you a better deal.  Try some of the specialist insurance companies

Subject: Re: Factory Manuals - Content

          Asad, the first set (2 volumes) covers everything through
          1973.  The second set covers everything new from 1974
          through 1983.  You really need them both.  Things like
          suspension, body, basic assemblies, etc you'll get from the
          first two volumes.

          The second set will have your particular wiring diagrams,
          CIS discussion, engine specs, etc.  This set often tells you
          what's new about a certain component, but how to get at it
          and fix it may be in the first set.  For my 1979, I probably
          use each set equally.

          You'll also want the little Spec Book (about $10) for your
          model.  It will have tightening torques, tolerances, and
          lots of other details that are not in the factory manuals.

          Don't expect too much from the factory manuals.  Don't get
          me wrong, they're probably the best there is, but they leave
          a lot to be desired. They're written for the pros.  I'm
          often disappointed, as they may tell you what you need to
          do, but not necessarily how.  Because you may need to
          reference both sets, it can get frustrating just trying to
          find the info you need. Sometimes the Haynes manual helps
          here, or Bruce's book, and of course this list.

          I've heard Bruce Anderson is working on a new
          maintenance/repair manual written more for the average
          wrench.  Anyone hear how it might be coming?

I bought an '89 C-4 with 7600 miles (collector car that hadn't been driven) 
last year for $36000.  At 12,000 miles the engine was beginning to sound 
noisey and a valve adjustment didn't correct the problem.  Turns out the 
engine had premature guide wear. Even though the car was out of warranty,  
Porsche paid for all parts in the repair and also upgraded the cylinders and 
heads in the process.  I did have to pay the labor which amounted to about 
$3000.  I'm still glad at got the car.  It now has 18,000 miles and an updated 
engine that purrrrrrs.   I'd be careful with the car you're looking at.  The

need to have the cylinders and heads replaced and decided to unload the car.

My guess is that being 19 (wish I was) and three speeding tickets the
specialty ins cos will not write the policy. You can save some money buy
assuming part of the risk and uping the deductable to 500 or 1000.

First, find a spool of black cloth fishing line about the same size as the

        Yes, quite possible.  The main problem is getting the lock
itself out of the steering column.  I don't remember all the stuff
you'll have to disassemble--but it should be in the Haynes book
somewhere.  (If you don't have the Haynes manual or the Factory
one, do yourself a favor and BUY ONE!)  Clymer/Lash is also OK,
it's a different look and covers the /6 as well.  But no electrical
diagrams...
        You can go to a locksmith or a Porsche shop and they should
be able to re-key the lock to whatever key you want.  Call around.
Ken's SporTech in Campbell, CA did five locks for me for $10 each.
One local locksmith wanted $15.
        It's pretty easy if you have a good supply of the "pins" in
the lock.  The pins can just shoot out of a removed lock cylinder
(spring-loaded), so wrap paper and tape around yours...
        Good luck!

I was wondering what is the best way to get the inner wheel
bearing seal out for repacking the wheel bearings if I want to
re-use the seal.  Usually the seal seems to be good for one or
two packings and I have a hard time getting it out without
wrecking it.

My usual method is to tap the inner bearing thru the hub while
supporting the hub/rotor so the seal and bearing can drop.  This
is rather hard on the seal, though.  I'm afraid to pry it from the back,
but maybe that is the way to go.

Subject: Early 911 mirrors redux

A week or so ago I said I heard that 75-78 BMW 5-series mirrors are very close
to those used on early 911's, and that both left and right mirrors are
available from BMW dealers.  Another 'phile said "no way" after examining his
own.

Turns out that BMW used a couple of flavors of mirrors for those models.  I
brought my '73 mirror in to compare to the manual chrome one I ordered and
guess what?  They *are* very close.  The BMW mirror is just slightly larger
(the glass and housing itself) but otherwise it is nearly identical!  It
mounts from the surface with hidden screws (as opposed to accessing screws
from the inside door), and the holes do not line up with the originals but
appear to cover them completely.  All in all, I'd say this is a very good
solution to the fact that Porsche did not manufacture a matching rectangular
right side mirror.

FWIW, I recommend anyone interested in left and right mirrors for early '70's
911's to check them out.  Again, the part numbers are:

(L) 51 161 821 793
(R) 51 161 822 076

I think they're around $40 each.

If you order the car, you can send the factory any sample of paint(or

They don't.  You MAY be able to get them widened at a wheel shop, check in 
Pano for the names of a few.

The later style slotted (FORGED alloy, not cast) come in 8" wide.  I think 
the new 5 spoke style comes in 9", you will have to check.  Automotion or 
Perfomance make duped of this style that may come wider.

Aftermarket wheels are really rare, not many people make them for the 928. 
 Those that do have wheels that fit charge a fortune.

This even applied to original purchasers of the 914.  Send in a color chip
and pay $110 and you got a car the color of the chip!  I don't believe
that they did the interior, though.

Subject: Saved by the George (a Cautionary Tale - Long)

     This Sunday I was enroute to my first autocrossing event at The Drop 
     Zone just outside of Walden, NY in my '84 944. I knew I was going the 
     right direction since a Hoosier Tires truck was leading the way. 
     
     I was not more than a mile from the site when my radar detector went 
     POOF right in front of my eyes, and I immediately lost all power. 
     There was smoke coming from under the hood in the vicinity of the 
     battery, and a burning smell from under the dash typically associated 
     with plastic giving its life for your olefactory enjoyment. The smoke 
     from under the hood was a cloud of sulphuric acid that didn't stop 
     emanating from a vent in the battery for 15 minutes! The alternator, 
     which I had just replaced with a remanufactured unit, apparently lost 
     all regulation.
     
     I flagged down some passing autocrossers to get a jump. No joy, but I 
     did get a ride to the site where another "racing buddy" found a tow 
     strap and got me off the roadway and to the site. Another instant 
     "buddy" took me into town to scout up a battery. His kindness cost him 
     the obligatory course walk.
     
     With the new battery installed, I was expecting it to fire right up, 
     and with any luck at all, still compete. WRONG. It was cranking, but 
     no spark. I hurredly consulted the owners manual to determine the fuse 
     to the brain, aka Bosch DME Control Unit. Uh oh...no fuse protecting 
     the brain. NO BRAIN!
     
     With visions of $500 flat-tows to Manhattan dancing in my head, 
     another instant "racing buddy" gets on his cell phone and calls George 
     Beuselinck, owner of 944 Ecology and purveyor of used parts. I explain 
     the situation to him. George thought it sounded like it might be a 
     fried brain, which he had in stock, or it might not. He asked if I 
     might be interested in him showing up at the event site in 45 minutes 
     with a replacement. Would I?!!! He said he would bring his '83 944 in 
     case it was some other problem.
     
     George connected the brain to the central nervous system, and the car 
     instantly fired to life. He checked the voltage at the battery and 
     determined the alternator was putting out 18 volts at idle. No telling 
     what it was at 4000 RPM. We disconnected the "tickler" wire to the 
     alternator so I wouldn't lose two brains in one day, or is that three 
     counting mine?
     
     We decided the best course would be an early departure to beat the 
     traffic back to the city, since any delay would probably mean dead car 
     in traffic blues. George even gave me his cell phone in case I needed 
     it on the drive back. A few miles away, I turned on the turn signal to 
     make a left, and no turn signal. No brake signal, no wipers, no radio, 
     no clock, but I still had interior lights, power windows, and the 
     cigarette lighter. Good time to restart smoking...no.
     
     I gingerly drove the car back to the mechanic who had replaced the 
     alternator hoping the entire time the charge on the battery would be 
     enough. It remains to be seen how much gets fixed under warranty, and 
     if the shop will help me out with the cost of the replacement brain 
     and new battery.
     
     I want to thank George Beuselinck for coming to my rescue on a Sunday 
     afternoon. I hope the car can be put back together again so I can 
     once-again show up at the Drop Zone to thank all my new-found "racing 
     buddies". The beer's on me.

Subject: 928 back on the road!!

It has been extremely hard these past five months to listen to you guys
and not be able to drive my car :^(  Saturday I was able to get it out
on the road. Way back in Febuary, while getting some practice laps in
before the start of the season, the transmission broke at where the
input shaft clamps onto the drive shaft! During the transmission
teardown, it was noticed that the hardening on the pinion shaft was
wearing off. I think that this set up a vibration which caused the
break. 

It is amazing on how all of the "while I'm in there" adds up: new clutch
bearings (throwout, pilot), rebuilt torque tube, vastly rebuilt
transmission (bearings, syncros, ring & pinion, 5th gear/input shaft,
limited slip), repacked CV joints, rear wheel bearings, rear brake
rotors.

I had almost forgotten how fun it is to drive. The power, the handling,
and the smoothness of the car is incredible. Much better than my old
blue truck that I've had to drive.

So, it's back on the road again. Still need to do some other things
before I can hit the track, but it sure cured my No-Porsche-Car
withdrawls.

Subject: '73 914/2.0 for sale

Hi,

I got an offer on my '73 914/2.0 from someone who heard about
it. But it's lower than I want to go, so I'm putting it here to see
if anyone is interested.

It is the original color - 914 bright yellow. It was repainted about
5 years ago probably (in Atlanta).

The tranny seems pretty good, I think only 103,000 miles.
I can downshift to 2nd and 1st easily using double-clutching. 
As usual, going to first without double clutching does grind some. 
Upshifts are ok, but the 2nd gear synchro sometimes grinds if 
you shift fast.

I don't think it ever had rust repaired- it is much cleaner than the '73 
that I had in 1980 !

It has a nice Momo steering wheel, Bursch muffler, Yoko 008R tires
on the Fuchs forged alloy wheels (best). Has a front flexible air dam.
The car has all the good options : sway bars, console, appearance
group, etc. These were standard on the '73 914/2.0.

Battery is relocated to the rear trunk in a nice welded-in recessed
metal well. Does not take up trunk space.

Needs some work and a good tune-up (sat for a while in a garage).
Has only about 103,000 miles. It's a late '73 model (June). 
Camshaft was replaced a few years ago, and engine freshened up.
The car came from Atlanta 5 years ago so is very rust-free, no winters
while it was in Connecticut.

Needs : some paint work (previous owner started restoring inside rear 
trunk and some small paint nicks with primer).
Radio was removed.
Needs a piece of metal welded in the front trunk where the removed
A/C condenser was (easy job, not structural, or use for oil cooler).
Needs pedal bushings replaced (I've had to do this on all older Porsches).
Has a small oil leak somewhere (what's new?).

I will part with it so I can afford to get my 911 back up to speed.
I could sell it as is for $3250. I also have a complete set of
factory manuals in mint condition that cost $300. This could be worked
into the deal somehow. I also have a nice set of styled-steel 5 1/2 x 15
wheels which could be put into the deal.

The car can be driven home.

Subject: Tire pressures

I'd been having trouble figuring out the operating pressures for a new set
of track tires (YoKo A008Rs) and a friend suggested that "Yoko's do very
nicely at 29psi with a 900# load and 26psi with a 600# load.  Figure your
weights and go from there, plus 4 pounds extra as a security blanket."

Well I used these as a starting point (29/900=0.032 and 26/600=0.043;
average the factors=0.0375; and figure 3000# for the car and big driver,
3000/4=750*0.0375=28.1, decided that 28 + 4 =32 was a good base.  Then
adjusting for the sway bars, temp, etc. I figured that running at 30 front
and 33 rear should work rather well, and it did.  I recognize that this is
rough but the starting ratios were really helpful.  

I just bought 8 other tires for two other non track cars (BFG Comp T/A VRs
and HRs); QUESTION: is there a way to find out the optimum operating
psi/weight ratios? 

I went back to the tire dealer who sold me the T/As and the concept of
optimum ratios or optimum psi-to-weight relationships was just too
complicated for them.  They would blankly and alternatingly pointing to the
"maximum operating psi" and the psi's listed on the door frame of the car as
answers to my questions.  "I don't want to operate at the max pressure, I
want to know what the optimum is."  "But how does the car manufacturer know
what tire I'm putting on the car and what ITS optimum operating
circumstances are?"  Is there any source of information that will give me
optimum operating psi for different weight loads, not just the maximums, for
different tires?  I must admit that the various codes on tires may yield
some of this but I don't understand the codes (Yes, I'm going to check
Consumers Reports when I get home but I don't recall them covering this
question.)  And, Yes, I'm going to ask my friend where he got the
information but I suspect it might be based on experience not "secondary
sources."  And, the answer might be of general interest to the larger group! 

(Sensing he really couldn't help me the dealer gave me an 800 number
(1-800-847-8475) but it turns out to be Michelin not BFG!)

Dear P'hiles,

I have a 71 911T with the factory air except the
compressor.  Any ideas on where I can find one -
or a suitable replacement?

Also, after reading the A/C FAQ, i was wondering
how I could tell if my 911 had a second condensor
under the chin.  I didn't see anything under
there that looked like a condensor.  There is
what seems to be an air port on the drivers front
with what looks like a fan up inside the cars
body- when viewing from underneath.  Any idea
what I am talking about?

As always any comments or opinions are
appreciated

When I owned my '77 911 the pop valve (pressure relief for the air box)

Bill, if you don't know the RIGHT answer, don't respond.

8" phone dials were widely available for the '86 944 turbo as their 
default wheel.  They were also available for the '87-88 in 53.3mm 
offset. I know because I have had several of each.

Additionally, a 6" version came stock on the '86 carreras but was 
almost opted out of for fuchs, whihc cost extra.

The above applies to 16" diameters.

Get a pop valve - no real improvements were made to fix this problem, 
except perhaps the oxygen sensor added in '80 which might help keep the 
car from backfiring - it won't though, as I found out a couple weeks 
before I intended to put in the pop-off valve.  I replaced the OEM airbox 
with a NLA cast aluminum airbox with built-in metal popoff valve, and 
have been trouble-free since.  Have seen other aluminum airboxes which 
were crap compared to this - it's even anodized (or something) blac so it

My wife and I are in the same age bracket.  We had one speeding 
ticket in the last two years when we switched insurance companies.  I 
pay $550/yr for full comprehensive/collison with the 100K/300K 
liability in a high premium area in Baltimore, MD for the Porsche. I 
was paying almost twice that with allstate. I insure with Erie.  We 
have two cars on the policy a 1990 Mazda 4wd van and a 1980 911SC.  
The Porsche is $25.00 cheaper per year than the Mazda!

GEICO was very expensive.  Shop around.

I also raised my deductibles to around 500 each and I put the savings 
in the bank so that I can use it in case something happens.

Two items:

First;
Sometime, somewhere, I saw an ad for a replacement 911 window crank knob. 
Instead of replacing the whole (expensive) crank, someone was selling 
replacement knobs that were fixed by a screw. Anyone know who and where?

Second;
For the first time in 60k miles, my 2.7 has developed a misfire. It's two 
weeks before my first Club Race at the Parade and I CAN'T LOCATE THE 
PROBLEM!

Here's what it does; over 4500 rpm, full throttle, about 1 in 5 times it 
cuts out severely for an instant. The tach remains steady. Sometimes it's so 
severe I get out of it for fear of snapping something apart.

So far I've replaced plugs, fuel filter, points. Inspected the fuel tank for 
'floaters'. No luck.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Alright guys, I need some help once again!  For some bizarre reason 
(which is what I want to determine)  My '72 914-4 is cutting out on me 
after running for 5 minutes or so.  Problem is, it refuses to restart 
until it has had a few (about 5) minutes to cool down(?).  Then it runs 
fine for another 5.  THen it stalls again.  Going down the highway at 65 
mph this happened to me today, and with the clutch engaged the car 
spittered and sputtered.  I replaced most of the FI components 6 months 
ago, including the fuel filter, which I'm beginning to suspect.  It has 
been very hot here lately, and i wonder if there is some relationship 
between the heat and this problem.  I haven't relocated my fuel pump and 
I've heard about "vapor lock" but don't know if this is that.  Please

Gabriel,
The thread has been about the fact that Porsche never made a rectangular
right side mirror for early 911's.  I'm not sure what model years are
affected except that I know early 70's are.  Some of us have been looking for
good substitutes.  They have to look as close as possible to the originals
(and the BMW ones do; yes, they're chrome).

You might look around in junkyards, salvage places, etc. like PartsHaven (see
Excellence and Panorama ads) or Easy in Emeryville.  If I were you I'd go for
a proper used one if you can find one.  I'll bet you can.

Subject: Setting Backlash and Endthrust on 914 cam

 To all you experienced (and other) engine folks out there,
 
 When rebuilding the 914 engine, the FACTORY MANUAL (see George, I own one!) 
 says that I need to check the backlash and thrust of the cam.  OK, sounds good. 
  The thrust looks like a no-brainer, just use dial gauge and slide cam 
 front-to-back.  I've done that before.  I'm a little confused at to the 
 backlash procedures, though.  I assume what I am trying to measure is the 
 ability of the cam and it's gear to rotate, while holding the crankshaft 
 stationary -- basically measuring the mating of the cam gear and the crank 
 cam-drive gear.  Is this correct? Does this vary because of wear or is it 
 because of the spacing between the crank and the cam bores?
 
 (BTW, H.G. Bieker went ahead and align bored the case because it was out of 
 tolerance.  Sorry Stan, I told him to call me first so I could find out if 
 there was another reason not to, other than bearing availability.  Bieker said 
 that over 1/2 the 914 cases he works on need align boring.) 
 
 The manual says to install cam and check to see if it is good by roting the 
 crank backwards and seeing if the cam pops out.  It also says to make sure 
 there is almost no play between the cam and the crank drive gears.  Does anyone 
 have a better or more scientific way of doing this? How much play is too much?
 
 Assuming that the backlash is out of spec, I guess the only solution is to 
 install a different sized gear?  The old one had a "0" stamped on it.  The gear 
 I am using comes from FAT performance.
 
 Final question:  recommendation on torque specs for the cam gear bolts?  My 
 engine guy (Bieker) said that he remembers 18 ft/lbs and use red locktite and 
 lockwashers (but only after checking backlash), but he didn't sound too sure.
 
 Thanks for the help,
 Tim Radsick
 
 PS, if Mr 914, PhD (G. Hussey) is listening in, I found a couple of errors (I 
 think?) in your chart of part numbers for fuel injection parts in the back part 
 of your catalog.  I think the Aux Air Regulators for L-jet and 1975-76 D-jet 
 got confused (along with a couple of other things).

In France, I think ALL headlights are required on cars in populated

result of some visibility study that showed that 'normal' lights are 
unnecessary in the city(light pollution?). Paris and, for that matter 
most large cities, are excessively lit cities so much so that even H4s 
are superfluous.

Subject: Insurance:  story update (& thanks!)

First, Thanks to all of you who've responded on my request for
stories/experiences.  There were many good suggestions for additional
companies, raise the deductibles, or even self-insurance (I don't think I've
got the guts for that one). $$ summary below.

Update:  I called another broker I've done business w/ over the years for
business.  He's an agent for Safeco.  He laughed.  Told a story:  He owns a
P-car.  Had all his cars insured w/ Safeco.  Safeco raised his rates on his
P-car by $600 one year.  Now he insures w/ State Farm (but still sells
Safeco).  Called his agent while on the phone w/ me.  the quote:  $595/six
months!  quite a difference (was $1402 w/ Farmers).  This is full coverage
(100/300 liab, 250/500 deductible on comp/coll), no mileage limits (tho not
used for work daily).  I'd probably raise the deductibles on those.  I like
this story.

btw:  Here's a summary of data points for premiums some have sent to me.
 Premium is per year, full coverage (that I can tell).  Deductibles noted, if
given.

They are to not blind oncoming drivers. In Paris, your lights HAVE to be
yellow, supposedly because the street lights are good enough to see where 
you are going. Your headlights then, are used not for you to see other 
people, but for other people to see you.

I don't know if you care or not. I would just buy the headlights (they're 
made yellow like that) however... in JC Whitney, I was just looking 
through the catalog and... on page 51: Philips COLORCLEAR lihgts, 
something you may like even better. Halogens that are whiteon, and when 
off, choice of 4 colors. One of them, you may like better, black... Would 
actually blend in with your car, but unfortunately, on the 928 (unles 
yours are broken), the lights are only showing when they're on...

Jerry -

Sounds appealing if your approach avoids the spill that normally occurs 
when the filter is removed. What's the purpose of the very slow drain rate?
Do you use factory filters? I usually still get a spill when removing the 
filter even if I puncture it. I always assumed that the anti-drainback 
feature of the factory filters worked well enough that too much oil 
stayed in the filter. Maybe I just didn't wait long enough.

Consider yourself lucky. My '87 Carrera Cabriolet cost me $4,200 a year
until the Leland-West PCA program came a long and dropped it to less than
$500.

I am 47, no accidents, no claims, but live in an urban area in Southern
California (where insurance companies make all their money).

Now, I have 3 Porsches covered for about $1,200 a year.

But my '94 Grand Cherokee costs me $2,900 a year. Guess it depends upon
where you live...
