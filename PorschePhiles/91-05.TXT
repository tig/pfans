Subject: 944 problems


Somebody posted questions about 944's weak spots.  I figured I'll  
through up what I know about my 84 944 in shorthand since I haven't  
seen anything posted:

CAM-BELT!!!!  Change every 30k.  If it goes out you are looking at a  
valve job and lots of wasted $$$  approx $300 for the job.

Motor Mounts.  Even the turbo mount for the right side doesn't stand  
the engine vibration for very long.

Water pump and cooling system.  There was an upgrade to improve the  
situation including going from 3 to 6 blade cooling fans to make them  
quieter.

Fuel Hose.  PCNA (?) recall.

Window Regulator (usu. drivers side), must keep well mounted and  
lubricated otherwise a new part runs $275.

There's probably more but these are definitly commonalities for my  
year.  


Enjoy.

Mailer: Elm [revision: 64.9]

        Hi there,

        My '67 912 sounds like it needs brake work. 
        The rear wheels make a scratching noise towards the end
        of braking, more pronounced when it is cold.

        I wonder if I could get some advice from the experts in what 
        I'm getting into trying to do brake work myself. (I'm a first 
        timer on brakes)

        I will probably replace the front struts at the same time.

        Thanks in advance,

        Mick Tegethoff

The brakes are probably the easiest thing to work on.  

You don't *need* to bleed the brakes to change thepads, but you
*should*.

Any repair manual will outline the procedure.  Once you do it you'll
wonder how you ever paid 100 bucks for someone else to do it.

Subject: Recommendations on dealer service near Palo Alto


I need to have work done on the transmission/clutch of my 89 951S.  It should
be covered under the factory warranty (which expires in 3 weeks).  I live
in Houston, Texas so I know nothing about the quality of dealer service in
the vicinity of Palo Alto, CA where I am working this month.  Is Carlsen
Porsche-Audi in Palo Alto a good choice?

I am also interested in knowing whatexperience other 951 owners have
had with transmission/clutch problems.  My car behaves as if the clutch will notdisengage.  I can shift gears normally as long as the engine is not running,
but it is extremely difficult to shift gears when the engine is running.  I
cannot engage first gear at all.  The problem suddenly arose yesterday on
my way from Tucson, Arizona to Palo Alto.  During the four months that I have
owned the car, I have occasionally had problems with gear clatter on shifts
from first to second.  But the problem was so infrequent that the dealer could
not detect anything wrong with the transmission or clutch when I took the car
in to have it checked.  I attributed the problem to sloppiness in
my shifting technique but it now appears that it was the forerunner of a
more serious problem with my transmission or clutch.  Comments?

My account at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center is not yet set up to receive
mail, so please address any responses to the address on theeeeeeeeeee``From'' line (Alan Demers).  Any help that you can provide will be greatly
appreciated.

Subject: turning rotors - how much $ ?
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

I pulled the rotors off my '74 914 2.0 this weekend and they are
pretty groovy (a lot of stuff from the early 70's is pretty groovy,
but I mean something different here).

So, I called Garretson's about having them ground, and they said it
costs $48 per disc.  Is this reasonable?  From a place like
'Mid-Engine Mania' I can get new discs for about $30-40 apiece.
Automotion has them for only a few dollars more.

I called an auto machine shop, (RPM) but they don't do rotors.

What's the deal?  Are MEM's discs probably crap?  Is there an
advantage to reground used discs over new ones?  Who else can I call
to get grinding prices (if not an automotive machine shop)?

Also, what are the best pads to use for the street?  Safety and
cost are more important to me than longevity (of the pads).

Thanks a bunch,

Does anyone have a recommendations/experiences/opinions on the
conversion of a 928 to a convertible?

In addition to workmanship and looks, I am primarily interested
in maintaining the structural integrity and handling the car.

I heard of a company called ZMC(?), located in southern California -
Has anyone dealt with them before?

Regarding groovy rotors, there is, to my understanding, good groovy and there is
bad groovy.  Somewhere I have a drawing showing the difference, perhaps in a
tech bulletin...  If you have good groovy, there is nothing wrong with the rotor
and you need on replace them when their width falls below the minimal
acceptable.  They have to have both structural strength and the ability to
dissipate heat.

I have always been told that one does not mill down Porsche rotors.  I don't
know why this is.  Probably because it is not something which should be
necessary, and if it is, you have some other problem which first needs
correcting.

My old Performance Products catalog lists front 914 rotors and about $43, rears
at about $53.  Dunno if they're OEM.  At this marginal price difference, and
given that you are going to spend some time swapping them, I would go with new
parts rather than milling the old.

Hope this helps...

Mick and Doug -

My first inclination was to tell you to go get someone to show you how to do it,
rather than pass along the following instructions.  Well, it is still my first
inclination.  You can screw up just about anything else on your car without
placing yourself and those around you at risk, but brakes are a different story.
See whether your local PCA is having a tech session, and if so, join them. 
Being shown how the first time is important.

Then I figured you'd probably just go out and buy the Haynes manual anyways.  So
what follows are the instructions I handed out last year at a 944-series tech
session I ran.  They were meant to serve as class notes, and not as a
comprehensive stand-alone script.  They are more or less portable to any car,
except that they don't describe, obviously, other cars' peculiarities.  Gary
Edwards wrote an article in this month's Northeast Region newsletter on the
914's rear calipers, and I would be happy to forward a photocopy to anyone given
a USPS address.

Please be careful, get a friend to teach you, and don't sue me.
______________________________________________________________________________

                 944 Brake Fluid and Pad Change


1.  Tools


The following tools are necessary:

   torque wrench
   1/2" or 3/8" extensions
   19 mm deep or soft socket for lug nuts
   heavy duty ("linesman") pliers
   needle nose pliers
   large flat-blade screwdriver
   metric "ignition wrenches" - 7, 8, and 10 mm
   clear vinyl hose, about 2' (pet store, for aquarium)
   catch bottle (empty, screw-top soda bottle)
   turkey baster
   jack stands
   wheel blocks
   work light

You'll find the following useful:

   breaker bar
   vice grips
   punch
   hammer
   piston compressor tool
   hydraulic floor jack (Sears)
   leather or rubber work gloves
   drop cloth or dolly


2.  Supplies


You'll also need some consumable items:

   brake pads
   brake fluid (Imparts, local shop)
   wear sensors (if worn out)
   anti-seize
   alcohol
   paper towels, rags
   hand cleaner


3.  Religion


There are two consumables of interest: brake fluid and brake
pads.  What kinds should you use?
The original Porsche pads are a really great choice for most
people.  They are available in an asbestos-containing
compound and the newer asbestos-free compound.  The one
disadvantage of all asbestos-free pads is that they tend to
squeal.

If you drive a 944 Turbo or 944 Turbo S, and are advancing
in track skills, you may want to try using Ferodo DS-11
pads.  They are a harder compound and stand up better to the
extreme use pads get on a track.  They are not suitable on
the street, nor are they useful for autocrossing.  The DS-11
compound needs to heat up before it becomes useful.  Ferodo
does not make DS-11's to fit 944 or 944S cars.

Same basic ideas for brake fluid.  Castrol GT LMA is a fine
fluid for most applications.  It's cheap, it works, and its
readily available.  If you drive on the track and have
problems with pedal fade, it may be due to boiling of your
brake fluid.  In that case, consider using a fluid with a
higher dry boiling temperature, such as Wilwood, ATE, and so
forth.

Do not use silicon brake fluid in your car.  Walk quickly
away from anyone who suggests otherwise.

The other important piece of religion is this:  You will
always use jack stands and blocks before sticking yourself
under a car.  Bears repeating...


4.  Changing brake pads


I'll describe the process for a single wheel.

 1.  Block the wheels, jack the car, support it with jack
     stands, and remove the wheel.  Use a "soft socket" if
     possible, to avoid marring the lug nuts.  Otherwise,
     use a 19 mm deep socket.

 2.  Open the hood.  Clean around the cap on the brake fluid
     reservoir.  Remove the cap, then remove the basket.
     Pour the brake fluid from the basket into the catch
     bottle, being careful not to get any on painted
     surfaces.  Clean the basket, wrap it and the cap in a
     paper towel, and set aside.

 3.  The caliper on a 944/944S is different in design to
     that on a 944 Turbo/944 Turbo S, as is the way pads are
     removed.

      3a. On a 944/944S, remove the spring lock or hairpin
          cotters on the retaining pins.
          Tap out the retaining pins with a hammer and
          punch, from the inside of the caliper.  Once their
          loose, or if you haven't a punch, grab their heads
          from the outside with lineman pliers, pull them
          out, and set them aside

          Catch the flat spring and set it aside as well.

      3b. On a 944 Turbo/S, compress the spring lock with
          linesman pliers and move it out of the way.

 4.  Remove the wear sensor carefully.  Be sure not to lose
     the leaf spring.

 5.  Remove the pads.  This generally requires a bid of
     creativity.  Remove the inner bad first, grabbing one
     of its "ears" with pliers and wiggling while pulling.

     Then remove the outer pad.  With the 944/944S' floating
     caliper, this requires yanking the caliper assembly
     out, so that the caliper's tongue no longer locks the
     pad in via its slot.

 6.  Clean the piston bearing surfaces.  Pour rubbing
     alcohol on a towel and wipe the piston.  Make sure the
     piston is correctly positioned.

 7.  Push back the piston(s) to make room for the new pads.
     While you do this, watch the reservoir to keep it from
     overflowing.  Use the turkey baster to draw off excess
     fluid.

     Use either a large flat-blade screwdriver or a special
     purpose tool to push back the piston(s).  Avoid scoring
     or damaging the piston.

 8.  Coat bearing surfaces of the new brake pads with a
     smear of anti-seize.  Insert the pads in the order
     reverse of which they were removed: first the outer,
     then the inner pad.  The fit is tight, and you may need
     to press back the piston(s) a bit more.

 9.  Put the wear sensor back in the inner pad.  Replace it
     with a new one if it has worn and turned on.  The inner
     pads wear faster, which is why they get the sensor.

 10. Replace the hardware removed in step 3.  If any parts
     worn or damaged, a new hardware kit can be bought.  On
     944/944S', smear a coat of anti-seize on the retaining
     pins.

 11. Check the condition of the suspension, electrical, and
     hydraulic parts in the wheel well.  Look for cracking
     or swelling of the brake lines.
     Check for any looseness in the suspension parts.  Grab
     the tie rod and wiggle it.

 12. Put the wheel back on, torquing lightly each nut to
     centre the wheel.  Then torque all five lug nuts to
     96 ftlb in a star pattern.  Put the car back on the
     ground.

 13. When all wheels' pads have been replaced, top off the
     brake fluid reservoir to the "Max" mark, replace the
     basket and cap, and wipe up any spilled fluid.

 14. Very important:  Start your motor with the hand brake
     applied.  Pump the brake pedal several times, until it
     becomes firm.  You have pushed the pistons back, and
     they need a pump or two to get them back to their
     operating point.

The new pads you have are "green."  During the first couple
of hundred miles, they will provide slightly less braking
force than broken-in pads.  Drive accordingly!  If you put
on new pads before going onto the track, expect an even more
noticible loss of braking - "green fade."

What is happening is that chemicals used in formulating the
pad compound boil out of the pad.  They form a microscopic
liquid film on the pad surface.


5.  Bleeding and changing brake fluid


Brake fluid should be changed once a year.  And you should
bleed the brake before each trip to the track.

Changing the fluid means a complete flush of the system.
Bleeding removes less fluid, concentrating instead on
ridding the system of broken-down fluid and air bubbles from
the calipers.

Bleed one wheel's caliper at a time, doing them in order of
decreasing brake line length.  This means:

     1. rear right,
     2. rear left,
     3. front right,
     4. front left.

You don't have to remove the wheels or jack the car to bleed
its brakes.  You may, however, find it easier to do the
fronts if it's jacked.

Bleeding fluid is a two-person job.
 1.  Open the hood.  Clean around the cap on the brake fluid
     reservoir.  Remove the cap, then remove the basket.
     Pour the brake fluid from the basket into the catch
     bottle, being careful not to get any on painted
     surfaces.  Clean the basket, wrap it and the cap in a
     paper towel, and set aside.

 2.  Go to the first wheel caliper you plan to bleed.  Take
     tools, paper towels, and the work light.

 3.  Remove the dust boot from its bleed valve.  On 944
     Turbo's, each caliper has two valves, and you have to
     bleed each valve separately.

 4.  Place the correct ignition wrench over the valve.  Push
     the vinyl hose over the valve, capturing the wrench.
     Put the other end of the hose into your catch bottle.

 5.  Get your accomplice (#2) into the driver's seat, with
     his/her foot on the brake.  His/her job is going to be
     pumping the pedal, to force fresh fluid from the
     reservoir to the caliper.

 6.  Have #2 apply pressure to the pedal.  #1 cracks the
     valve on the caliper, opens its, and lets fluid drain
     into the catch bottle.  When #2's foot has pushed the
     pedal to the floor, s/he signal's #1, who then closes
     the valve lightly.

     #2 should not release the brake pedal until #1 has
     closed the valve.  Otherwise, the rising pedal will
     suck air back into the caliper.

 7.  The two of you now need to establish a co-ordinated
     rhythm.  Something like:

        #1 (in driver's seat)           #2 (at caliper)

        applies pedal pressure,
        says: "Pressure!"
                                        opens valve,
                                        says: "Open!"
        pushes pedal to floor,
        then says: "Floor!"
                                        closes valve,
                                        then says "Closed!"
        releases pedal,
        says: "Releasing...Up!"

     You need to repeat this cycle a number of times.  If
     you're just bleeding, anywhere from four to ten pumps
     may be necessary to remove dirty-looking fluid and air
     bubbles.  Look through the vinyl hose, watching the
     quality of the fluid coming out the valve.
     If you're changing the fluid, the number of pumps
     needed depends on the line length.  Look for fresh,
     clean fluid coming down the hose.

 8.  In all cases, watch your fluid level in the reservoir.
     Do not let it fall more than half-way down!  If the
     reservoir runs dry, you will suck air into the lines
     and have to start all over.  Watching the reservoir and
     keeping it filled is a good job for a third person.

 9.  When you're done with a valve, close it snuggly (4 Nm),
     remove the hose and wrench, and replace the dust boot.
     Wipe up any fluid which has dripped.

 10. And when you're done all 'round, check the pedal feel.
     If you have any doubt about the work you've done, don't
     drive the car.  Get help!

 11. Top off the brake fluid reservoir to the "Max" mark,
     replace the basket and cap, and wipe up any spilled
     fluid.

Brake fluid is toxic.  Dispose of it using your town's
hazardous waste program.

Hi Porsche Nuts

I am moved to endorse a product.  I have been trying and trying to get
the paint on my car to look decent.  No matter what, I still could 
detect a kind of fogginess which I guess was the result of residual 
oxidation.  This is particularly a problem on dark colors like mine.
Weekend before last I tried McGuires with good but still not spectacular 
results.  Before this I have used Karseal products (cleaners and waxes)
and plain carnuba wax.  Following a short thread on rec.autos (I can
read but not post) regarding waxes I decided to try this zymol stuff.  
The stuff is fantastic.  I tried a test on my hood comparing the fresh
McGuires finish to the zymol half and half and there was an enormous
difference.  My paint is now deep and clear as it should be.  The
remainder of the McGuires will grace the Toyota pickup methinks.

I believe one key is the zymol cleaner "HD Cleanse" which I used first
as recommended.  It gets the paint literally squeaky clean and removes
any hint of oxidation or grime.  (Mine was in no way what you would
call oxidized, just kind of "foggy" as I said).  Followed by zymol
"carbon" for dark colors, I am really pleased by the results.

The bad news is the stuff is truly expensive.  From Beverly Hills
Motoring Accessories (the nearest place for me) a container of zymol wax
is 27 odd dollars and a small bottle of hd cleanse is about ten.  I am
being vague about the sizes since I don't have them here.  However,
I think the stuff is worth it (belive it or not).  In case you think
that is bad, they actually sell some stuff called "Destiny" which runs 
on the order of THREE HUNDRED dollars for a regular wax sized container
(12 ounces maybe).  I told the mail order clerk they should be selling
it as a drug not a car care product.  You can get the number of your
nearest zymol distributor from zymol at (800) 999-5563.  In case there
is any question, I am in no way associated with zymol products (I'm not
sure how to pronounce it even, how do you get an umulat on an ascii
terminal)?

914 disks are basicly disposble. They're so thin that there is seldom 
any percentage in regrinding them (turning them, as it's usually called).
Replacements should be between $35 and $50 each. Contact places that sell
VW parts for a quote -- they should have them in stock and they should
be cheaper than a more conventional Porsche parts dealer....

That's absurd.  Anyone around here charges $5.00 - $7.50 per disc.  Even

Pep boys charges $5.00.

It's NOT a big deal.  They stick the thing in a special macheine, come
back later, and it's done.  Just make sure they are within wear spec.

My advise is to replace them.   If it is that inexpensive, you are
better off.

Subject: SSI heat exchangers

Hi Folks
  can anyone confirm or deny the non-existance of SSI heat exchamgers
that have the left side totally boxed with an extra, large diameter,
warm air take-off which suplies warm air to the air intake box ?  I
have just had new exchangers fitten to my '72 2.4 E and they don't have
this extra warm air take-off and the left is the same as the right
(except for the little warm air point at the top of the back part which
goes to the injection system).  Sorry if these decsriptions are a
little vague - I could do with being able to draw a couple of pictures !

Anyway when I queried this with the garage where I had the work done,
he said that SSI don't make such an exchanger.  If that is the case
then I'm happy (the new exchangers are beautifuly made and look great)
but if they do make the totally correct original shape then I would
prefer to fit that.

Thanks for any info

   Richard

ps my silencer (muffler) has a little hole now so I guess I'll have to replace
that as well - anyone have any opinions on after market one like Bursch etc

The Bosch mechanical fuel injection is very dependant on that hose
from the heat exchanger - don't run it without it.   If you run
without it you'll be running way rich all the time because the MFI
will think the engine is still cold.  That hose gives it heated air
from the heat exchangers and that's how it senses engine temp.

Stoddard sells the left HE in stainless steel, I don't know if it's
from SSI or not.  Tweeks also sells it in a stainless version, agaim
don't know if it from SSI.

Subject: 912 Brakes (long)


For a 912, the pad changing/bleeding process is slightly different, so
do get a Haynes or Clymer for exact instructions.

ALso, some notes on Kevins article:

   They are available in an asbestos-containing
   compound and the *newer* [my emph] asbestos-free compound.  The one
   disadvantage of all asbestos-free pads is that they tend to
   squeal.

This means the pads you have on now probably contain asbestos.  Asbestos
is supposedly highly carcinogenic, and there will be lots of brake
dust on your wheel, calipers, and pads.  If you are going to clean
them or not, be cautious not to breath any of that dust in (it won't
kill you right away, at least).

   you may want to try using Ferodo DS-11 pads.

There are a number of different pads that work well, but keep in mind
harder pads wear the rotors faster, and (as Kevin said) are only
useful at the track, they really suck for street driving.

   Do not use silicon brake fluid in your car.  Walk quickly
   away from anyone who suggests otherwise.

Ditto that.  A number of wanna-bees will tell you silicon is the way
to go, but it's more trouble than it's worth.

   The other important piece of religion is this:  You will
   always use jack stands and blocks before sticking yourself
   under a car.  Bears repeating...

   Brake fluid should be changed once a year.  And you should
   bleed the brake before each trip to the track.

Amen.

	1. rear right,
	2. rear left,
	3. front right,
	4. front left.

And of course for the few UK subscribers, this is RL,RR,FL,FR
(seriously).  You start with the wheel farthest from the reservoir.

   Brake fluid is toxic.  Dispose of it using your town's
   hazardous waste program.

And brake fluid is very good at eating paint.

A final note, if you're going to spend time at the track, don't fill
your brake fluid to the max line it'l overflow.

Hello fellow porchephiles,

A question for the 944 addicts. What is a sure symptom that your
waterpump is about to die? I have the Haynes advice already.

The 84 944 cooling system had a small leak some two years a.
It got fixed with a chemical (Zerex?) into the coolant. Since then
only tiny leaks until recent 50 kmile belt operation. A bigger
leak afterwards but no other symptoms. The mechanic that did the
belts claimed that the waterpump is due. Should I believe him?
Need to be able to trust my machine since I'm taking it to
Germany in a about a month. How risky is this in hard driving?

Related to this does anybody know how quick/affordable this is
to do in Germany? In Helsinki the bill is astronomical (>$1200).
 
Thanks in advance.

Kari

The failure is progressive, so it is hard (and in my opinion unwise)
to attempt to predict the pump's demise.  My understanding of the
usual failure mode is that first the shaft seal starts to leak (and
you will begin to see white-ish coolant residual on the bottom of the
engine).  Then, the water/coolant mixture gets into the pump bearing.
Soon the bearing starts to make noise (the "loose drive belt" sound
the Haynes manual refers to).  This in turn leads to more leaking,
overheating and the eventual failure of the pump.  The time frame over
which this process occurs depends on many factors and can vary widely.

I'm not sure why you would take your car to someone whose advise you
don't trust, but this is another issue.  If you cannot get a second
opinion (us guys on the net can't easily look at your car), only you
can decide whether to believe him and have the problem repaired or
ignore him and run the risk that he was right.  If the pump has been
leaking this long (assuming it is the pump and not a hose somewhere),
I would definitely replace it.  Things will only get worse, and you
run the risk of getting slippery coolant on your new belts.

I have no idea about European prices.  I have noticed that many
after-market companies in the US have begun to offer rebuilt pumps for
$150-200 plus your old pump (assuming that it can be rebu ilt, which
is another small incentive for not waiting too long).  If your
mechanic is willing to install a rebuilt pump, this might save you
some money.

Good luck,
-Milo

Hi All

If anybody has scoped out the turn signal set-up on an around 1980
911 they could save me some time and cussing.  My signals failed 
catastrophically yesterday evening.  Fuses is okey and the emergency
flashers still work fine.  I suspect a "flasher" or a relay.  Is
the "flasher" for the emergency flashers the same one as the turn 
signals use?  The wiring diagram seems to indicate such, however it
also shows a turn signal relay - has anyone found the location of 
this little dude?  It seems like a very likely suspect.

Thanks

Subject: SSI heat exchangers


Hi folks,
  just to follow-up on Christopher Welty's warning, the SSI exchanger does
have the MFI warm air take off refered to, but doesn't have the one
that feeds warm air to the engine air box through the flap valve on the
left side of the engine.  So appart from getting slightly less warm air
on start-up the actual performance shouldn't suffer.

  Thanks to Christopher for the warning anyway.

Subject: reply to clutch/transmission problems

This is reply to they guy that was asking about a clutch what would not
disengage.  Turns out I just had the same problem.  The springs in
the clutch blew apart and had to be replaced.  Because its a turbo,
the hours of labor goes from 9 to about 14.  I saw the spec book myself
as the guy was giving me the bad news.  The total hit to me was $1200.

The symptoms match up exactly though.  It came on suddently and the
clutch would disengage to about a 40% slip.  I basically just put it
in 4'th, started the engine, and hobbled over to the shop.

Re: price of the work.  Milo's rebuild price is right, but then there's the
labour.  I'm not sure how many hours; your dealer can quote you what Porsche
allows for the work.  Getting things apart is, I understand, a bit of a chore.  
If I understand the print-out I got when mine was done, there is 5.5 hours of
labour.  (Porsche picked up the tab, so I don't know for sure.)

The good news is that your timing and balance shaft belts will get re-tensioned
when things are put back together, amortizing the cost a bit!  Whoever does the
work should also check for and replace, if needed, leaking balance shaft or main
seals.

Good luck!  If it's the pump, get it fixed sooner rather than later.

   X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL10]


   Hi All

   If anybody has scoped out the turn signal set-up on an around 1980
   911 they could save me some time and cussing.  My signals failed 
   catastrophically yesterday evening.  Fuses is okey and the emergency
   flashers still work fine.  I suspect a "flasher" or a relay.  Is
   the "flasher" for the emergency flashers the same one as the turn 
   signals use?  The wiring diagram seems to indicate such, however it
   also shows a turn signal relay - has anyone found the location of 
   this little dude?  It seems like a very likely suspect.

On the 78 and later cars, there are two flasher relays - one for the
turn signal and one for the hazards.  I'm pretty sure the turn signal
one is located behind the oil temp/press gauge.  If you pull out the
gauge, turn on your hazards, and touch the relay, if you can feel it
switching (it's mechanical), then that's the one for the hazards.
They are both the same *type* of relay, so you can swap the suspected
broken relay with the known working one to be sure that the relay is
the problem and not the switch on the steering column.

Summary:  Can I reuse the brake pad retaining springs and caliper
          mounting bolt locking plates?

I just bought new calipers and pads for my '74 914 2.0 and went to
install them this weekend.  But Haynes says to replace the brake pad
retaining springs (flat cross-shaped metal springs) and the caliper
mounting bolt locking plates (thin plates with tabs to keep the bolts
from turning).  Dealer has to order them and wants $1.21 (each) for
the front locking plates and $121.00 (each) for the rears.  The guy at
Porsche's central pricing place told the dealer, "yeah, it looks like
a pricing error, but my computer still says $121.00 and that's what
counts."  So he's trying to find out what's the deal...  Meanwhile,
I'd like to be driving the car before the weekend...

So, I want to know if others have simply reused the old springs and
plates and what kind of results they've had.  Do y'all replace the springs
every time you replace the pads?  Do you replace the plates when you
remove the rotors?  Have you paid >$5 for the plates?

I'm getting sick of this.  I spent several days and $265 getting the
rotors, pads, inner & outer wheel bearings and grease seals, and now
even the dealer can't get me the rest of the disposable parts!

Does somebody make a kit with this stuff in it?  Like a '914 brake
hardware kit'?  What do *you* do when you do brake work on *your* 914?

I curse a lot.

You all may recall my brake woes of a few weeks ago, when I couldn't retract
the inner pistons on my '73 2.0 rear calipers.  The problem turned out to be
that the retracting screw (the one under the dust cap on the inside, the
side next to the trailing arm) is simply missing on both rear calipers.

Frank Kerfoot mentioned that he's heard of these things simply falling out.
I took off a caliper again and took a close look; it appears that it must be
something that looks vaguely like an allen screw, perhaps an inch long.  It
may have threads only at the end, and be smooth closer to the head, but I
don't know since I don't have the piece in question.

I can't really see how it could come out.  It *might* be possible that you
could just unscrew it out, if the piston was at the end of its travel.  Does
anyone have a spare caliper they can try this on?  Can this piece just come
out?

Can anyone recommend a source for these things?  The aftermarket places I'm
familiar with (Tweeks, Automotion, Performance Products) sell whole
calipers (for $275), but not just the piece that I'm missing.

Please help!  Thanks.

here (New Jersey...they generally have rust problems), and

   Summary:  Can I reuse the brake pad retaining springs and caliper
	     mounting bolt locking plates?

Yes, you can reuse them.  These parts don't take much abuse, so as
long as they're still in working order you'll be fine.  The locking
plates sometimes can't be reused because the locking tab has broken
off is is about to.  If ever your dealer quotes you an outrageous
price (read: any time you go to the dealer for parts) you should
always call tweeks or performance products (or automotion, or  ...)
first.  If they tell you what you want is a dealer only part, call up
Stoddard for prices, they're a most legitimate business.

Stoddard does sell the stuff you want, but I don't know the price.

Tweeks, Stoddard, and Performance Products all sell "improved design"
914 caliper plugs. Tweeks has it for 4.25 which is about half what PP and
Stoddard ask.  The tweeks part number is 1003rcp, though I think the
PP one may be stainless steel (I don't remember).

Subject: 911 air box relief valve installation.
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

I had an unpleasant experience yesterday.  I am posting it here to help 
everyone else avoid it.

While replacing the oil light sender in my 1980 911, I decided to also 
install the air box relief valve.  I had the rear of the engine lowered
to allow access to the sender unit which is forward (relative to the car)
of the FI unit.  With the engine lowered in this manner it is easier to 
get the drill and hole saw in position to cut the installation hole (for
the relief valve).

The directions that come with the valve contend that all debris from the 
2" diameter installation hole may be removed with a shop vac, or similar 
device.

Not true.

There is enough fuel residue in the air box to stick all manner of small chips
in unreachable locations within the air box.  I suppose that in a brand new 
air box, the device would install as the manufacturer indicates; with 115k 
miles, things are different.

The bottom line:  Allow for air box removal when installing the relief valve.


--Soren            laforce@krypton.arc.nasa.gov

p.s.

The good news is that it looks like the engine and transaxle could be removed 
in well under 2 hours.  I had no idea they would come out that easily.

Also, I don't want to talk anyone out of putting in a relief valve.  By all 
accounts, they prevent a fairly common, moderately expensive, problem.  What
happens is that fuel gets into the air box when the car is shut off.  If the 
car is restarted soon after shutdown, the fuel may explode, destroying the
air box.

Automotion (and, no doubt, others) carries a stainless steel air box as a 
replacement.  I believe this box comes with a relief valve installed, and I
think it is slightly cheaper than the plastic box.

San Jose and Monterey prices for 914's have ranged from $1,000 to over $10,000

I looked at one $1,000 car.  It was a 74 2.0 with lots of rust, bondo, 
and long-time deferred maintenance, and it needed an engine
rebuild (the heat exchangers appeared to be good, however, and it had alloys).
Don't assume that because it is a California car, it will be worth
buying.

Subject: 944 overheating


Now that warmer weather is arriving (finally), I thought  this would
be a good time to bring up the question "Does your 944 run as hot as
mine does?".

I have a very early '83 944 with low mileage (~25K) that has always
had a tendency to run warm during the summer.  When the outside
temperature is in the upper 80's or higher and I start running uphill,
the engine temperature starts to climb.  How high does it go?  The
highest I let it get is approaching the solid mark on the temperature
gauge.  Turning off the air conditioning and removing the bra will
slow the heating rate, but if it's warm enough outside and the hill is
long and steep enough (and I'm on the gas pretty hard), the
temperature still rises.

When I come over the top of the hill or, if the top isn't in sight,
the temperature gets too high and I pull off the road, then the
temperature goes right back down to normal.

Both fans are operating and they come on when the temperature gets to
about the halfway mark or when the air conditioning is on.

Any comments on your experiences or suggestions to fix the situation
would be appreciated.

Bob,

Right after getting my water pump replaced and both fans working, my  
car NEVER got above the halfway mark...  It's an '84 944.  At that  
point it had one three blade fan and one six blade fan, so I could  
hear the three blade come on and it came on at the first tick mark.   
Perhaps our gauges are calibrated differently, but I panic if I get  
to the third tick mark.  I'm STILL running on only one fan here in  
Texas right now and my gauge has yet to hit the third tick mark  
except when I sit idling for about three minutes, then the temp  
starts to rise...  Perhaps you need to check your cooling system.

Hi All, I have a few questions regarding the 951.

First, what years had the problem with cracking exhaust manifolds?
Was this covered as a warranty item or as a recall?  If it was a recall,
can the modifications (to a manifold w/ expansion joints) be made for 
free (naive, wishfull thinking?!?), outside the warranty period?

I would also like to know the same info for the fuel line (fule rail?)
problem.

Thanks, Art

86 had the exhaust problems, almost all were fixed under warranty.  The
ones tah are fixed are easily identifyable by the accordian like section
of pipe by #1 cylender and a heat-sheilded crossover pipe that is split
so it need not be removed to do a clutch.

The fuel line's have almost all been fixed too, it was an 86-88 or 89
problem, and PCNA mailed notices to all 944 owners.  They must have done
a state by stat registration search, cause I got one and I am second
owner.

Subject: Bad experience at Garretson's in Mt. View, CA
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu
Date: Thu, 16 May 91 10:33:34 PDT
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

I just had a bad experience with Garretson Enterprises in Mountain
View, and since lots of people recommended them very highly to me
(even several netters who don't live in Northern CA!), I feel the need
to relate it to y'all (not to contradict anyone who recommended them
to me, just to add a bad data point in with the good data points).

I bought German rotors and bearings for my 914 and took them (straight
out of the box) to Garretson's to have the races pressed in.  They
charged me for 1/2 hour of labor (at $64 per hour) and did it while I
waited.  I took the discs home, installed the first one and it turned
smoothly and beautifully.  I pulled the second one out of the box and
saw several similar little scratches on the bearing surface of the
inner race.  They had clearly been made when the mechanic was
hammering the race into the hub.  I thought "Gee, that's strange.  The
bearing surface should be really smooth.  But Garretson's is really
expensive and very experienced, so the (expert) mechanic must know
that those scratches are too small to matter (or something)."  So I
installed the second rotor.  When I turned it, it sounded like the
bearings were bad (scrape scrape scrape...)  Exactly the kind of sound
you'd expect from little scratches in the race (the scratches were
deep enough to catch my fingernail!).

This morning I called Garretson's and told them about the scratches.
"They won't matter," he says.  "But I installed it and they did
matter," say I.  "OK.  You'd better bring them in and we'll try to get
to it today."  So I drive out to Garretson's (for the second time)
before work and show the service manager (or someone) the scratches.
He says, "The drift we use to press them in looks like this and can't
make those kinds of scratches if it's used properly."  "Yes, if the
races are pressed in properly, they won't be damaged.  This one got
damaged, so someone made a mistake," I reply.  Eventually, he claimed
that I must have brought in a race that was already banged up.  This
is absurd!  I gave the races to the mechanic - marks on them would
have been very noticeable, and mechanics know that pitted races are
no good!  I *know* they were all fine when I brought them in.

So we argue and argue, and he refuses to do *anything*.  He won't
remove the damaged race, won't give me a new race, and won't drive a
new one in.  And he keeps the $64/hr that I already paid him!

So I'm out about $43 ($32 for the labor and $11 for a whole new
bearing), and I still have to figure out how to get the old race out
and the new one in.  Now, $43 is not a huge amount of money, but I'm
really pissed at how the place treated me, especially when I had heard
that Garretson's was a really professional (though expensive) place
(this is the place that said they would charge $45 per rotor to turn
rotors).

Anyway, I remember someone on the list having a connecton to
Garretson's management (or ownership).  Could that person give me a
name and/or mailing address so I can send an appropriate letter?  I
don't expect to get any satisfaction from them, but I would like them
to hear about the bad service.

Thanks for listening.  I feel much better now...

 Garretson's generally does pretty poor work on customer
 cars. They seem to do great work on their race cars.
 I don't use them anymore.

 The only two shops I think you should consider are:

      Modderman's Porsche 
      (about two blocks freeway-ward of Garretson's).
      Formerly run by old man Modderman and now run
      by his son. Really excellent work, but not cheap.
      Can't speak to the quality anymore 'cause his son
      has taken over the shop.

      European Automotive, Evelyn Street, Mountain View
      Best Porsche shop I know of. I've gone there for
      the last four years. Owned and operated by Ralph
      Foglein. He apprenticed to Modderman for a couple
      of years and learned his trade very well. Meticulous
      work, imaginative and thorough. No problems in the
      four years (and I've spent a good 10K in his shop)
      that weren't resolved rapidly and to my satisfaction.
      Monday-Thursday, 8am-8pm.

 Other shops with a good rep are Reitmeir's (they race)
 and Carrera Tech. Both shops race 914s and do very well.
 Ralph is a 914 enthusiast and has just completely restored
 his '73 2.0.

 Check them out. Stay away from Garretson's except, possibly
 for some advice.

 Ralph has re-done a lot of their work.

Thanks for letting me know.  I'm glad it's not just me.  Another
porschephile has already sent me a note saying they botched some work
on his '79 930 as well.  I'm also glad it only cost me $40 to find
out, rather than $400 or more!

Thank you very much for your recommendations.  I'll call them and
check them out.

Subject: Bad experience at Garretson's in Mt. View, CA


Garretson's rep comes from the fact that PCA Tech Chairman Bruce
Anderson used to work there, and from their work with racing cars.
Bruce no longer works there and has nothing to say about the "new
management" (though he still teaches courses for them). I got the
impression from talking with him that he didn't like them, but he
didn't actually SAY anything. 

Most of us who do our own work have to suffer shops.  It's a tough
business to make money, especially if you're honest.  Make a mistake
and you'll probably end up losing money on the job if you admit it.
Where I used to work it was an unwritten rule that mechanics never make
mistakes - either we "found something else wrong" or ignore it.  The
rule was unwritten because if we ever actually told the service mgr.
we screwed something up, the fix was deducted from our paychecks (I
did that once...once.  Luckily (for me) it was only a tie rod end).
That's on real jobs, when a DIYr comes in with the one little thing he
can't do himself because he needs a lift/press/whatever, the shop
isn't making more than a few bucks off him, so he's lucky if they
even do it.  Realistically, it probably does cost them more than what
they charge you, considering overhead.

What you have to do is:  find a school with a student shop and try to
get access to it; make friends with a mechanic or shop owner who'll
let you use the tools you don't have on occasion; find someone in your
PCA region with access to the tools you need (you'd be surprised).
For lathes/presses/ other machine shop type equipment, just about
every High School and college has one, and will probably give you
access for a few bucks (as long as you follow the safety
precautions!).  Good Luck.

Additions to Steve's info: The fuel rail was replaced in the 944S cars and no
others that I am aware of.  In fact, mine was done twice.  Apparently PCNA
wasn't happy with the original replacement part (campaign L01).  I never got a
second notice, probably because the dealership did it when I happened by one
day, before PCNA sent the notices.  Question: Does anyone know what was wrong
with the original part?  My only hypothesis came from noticing that the engine
ran a bit smoother and the hose at the front end is a bit longer.  Made me think
that perhaps some "standing pressure wave" in the fuel system was cured.  OK,
maybe my imagination is a bit wild!

If you are the second owner of a car, PCNA would be happy to know about you. 
They have a card you can get from a dealership.  Fill it out, send it in, and
you'll get future notices.

The 951 (944 Turbo) fuel hose replacement is important!  If anyone out there
hasn't had it done, get it taken care of ASAP.  I was surprised when a new
colleague at the office told me that he had procrastinated to the point that
until a week ago it hadn't been done.  Apparently PCNA had started peppering him
with letters recently, trying to get his attention.  Nice to see that kind of
care on their part.

Subject: 911 questions?


Hi Folks,

I've just bought a '73 911T that has some small accident damage around the front wing and therefore have not been able to run it on the road yet. Can somebody answer a few questions for me?

Is it possible to check the oil level at any other time than with the engine at operating temperature? The reason I ask this is that I have good oil pressure on starting the engine but the Oil Level Gauge doesn't seem to shift much off zero! How accurate/reliable is this gauge?

Is it OK to use super( 4 star ) graded petrol in a car that is designed to use regular ( 2 star ). I haven't seen leaded regular for sale here in Switzerland and unless the previous owner had some secret source of regular I suppose he must have used Super..

Is it possible to use leadfree petrol ?  Is it possible to retrofit a Catalysor( 3 -way)?

Thanks

Subject: 911 questions?


   Is it possible to check the oil level at any other time than with
   the engine at operating temperature? The reason I ask this is that
   I have good oil pressure on starting the engine but the Oil Level
   Gauge doesn't seem to shift much off zero! How accurate/reliable is
   this gauge?

That gauge is usually broken on older cars.  The only truly accurate
way to check oil level is with the dipstick in the oil filler tube.
THis must be done with the engine running, and will only be accurate
at OT, though you can at least get a reading while it's cold.  

   Is it OK to use super( 4 star ) graded petrol in a car that is
   designed to use regular ( 2 star ). I haven't seen leaded regular
   for sale here in Switzerland and unless the previous owner had some
   secret source of regular I suppose he must have used Super..

Assuming the European system is similar to the US, in that higher
grades of gasoline indicate better anti-knock behavior, you can use
anything above what the car was made for.  As for lead, in this
country there are a number of lead additives you pour in before you
fill the tank since leaded gas is illegal in most states.  Opinion is
mixed as to whether this is really needed in old Porsches.  Clearly
they were built to run with leaded gas, but unlike other cars built in
that era, they weren't dependant on that fact.  I use it anyway, about
one can every 1Kmiles, because it certainly can't hurt.

You'll have to experiment and see about different oil levels at different
temperatures.  Check it at 180 degrees and then see what it comes to when
cold to get a feel for it.  I have found that different grades of oil have
different thermal expansion rates, with the multi-visc. oil expanding more
at lower temperatures than the straight grades.

The oil level gauge on my '73 is fairly reliable - it has about a two quart
range.  When I start the car cold, it won't register any oil, but will be
somewhere in the middle of the range at operating temperature for the
proper level via the dipstick.  One thing to realize is that if one of the
electrical connections on the level sender stops making contact, the level
gauge will register FULL - so be suspicious if it starts at full and stays
that way.  Also, the seal around the sender tends to leak - make sure all
8 or 10 of the nuts holding it on are reasonably snug.

I finally realized that OT must refer to operating temp - but that's not
the first interpretation I tried (OT also meaning TDC in Deutsch, as
marked on every 356 crankshaft pulley).  Then I realized that I don't
know what OT actually stands for (in German) - can one of you fill
me in?

I interpreted it as "Open Throttle", which is a ludicrous concept but I
couldn't come up with anything else, and didn't want to admit my ignorance.

Perhaps "Oberst" - which translates into "the highest," or "topmost."

Interesting ! In the UK there have been repeated discussions about additives
to use in Lead free petrol or in leaded petrol to increase it for older cars 
made in an age when the lead content was much higher.  A few magazines have 
undertaken tests of these products with the result in one case of the engine 
requiring an overhaul!!!!  Can you tell me what products are used regularly 
and has anyone had any negative results. Also do 911`s have sufficient hardening 
of the valve inserts so that lead is not required??

Subject: Gates Sealed Battery - info?

I've seen something called a Gates Sealed battery advertised in Excellence
for quite a while now.  This battery supposedly can be mounted in any
position and requires no maintenance.  Seeing as how I am probably going to have
to get a new battery in the near future, I was wondering if anybody has had
any experience with these things.  In particular, how is their cold starting
ability?  How long do they last?  Do they have the same CCA as a normal battery?

I'm sick of getting "rust dust" on my newly replaced front suspension pan and
would really like to get rid of the old acid battery.  It's a personal thing.
Auto Mechanika (I think that's how it's spelled - don't have a copy here at
work) sells it for around $110 - about twice the price of a garden variety
battery.

Thanks,

To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

Just thought I'd drop a line about the autocross class that PCA (Loma Prieta 
Region) last this weekend (5/18-5/19).

The class consisted of drills on saturday and a more typical auto-x on sunday.

There were one or two students per instructor, and (if my experience was 
typical) most of the instructors were very good.  Of the four that worked
with me, three gave me a lot of good suggestions and one didn't say much.

The class was a lot of fun.  It is also a good place find out where your 
car's limits are without endangering anything (except for a cones!), or
anyone.

I don't know if there will be another class this year or not.  If anyone
is interested, I will check and post the info, along with whom to contact.

Also, if anyone wants more details about the class I attended, let me know 
and I will follow up via email (or post if it seems a lot of people are 
interested).

So, do dealers do this?  Or do dealers just threaten to fire their
mechanics if they make too many mistakes?  If the dealer is
responsible to Porsche (I.E. they might lose their dealership if
Porsche hears too many complaints about bad service) then you can't
have dealer mechanics trying to cover up their mistakes on customer
cars, right?  Of course, the dealer doesn't want to go firing its
mechanics because they've (presumably) invested a lot of money in each
mechanic (sending them to Porsche-specific training, etc.)  Also, do
you know if dealer mechanics usually have to buy their own tools, the
way a lot of independent shops make their mechanics buy their own?

I found a nice mechanic who drove in the last race for me.  I might

There's also a discussion part of the answer which hits a lot of the
basics of setting up all of this.

-----

Btw, out here in the South Bay, many of the PCA 914 hotshots recommend
Ken Mack ("Ken's Sportech" in Campbell) for setting up autox 914
suspensions.  He has all the electronic alignment machine/stuff
himself (most repair shops don't); he and Dwight Mitchell (way out in
Sacramento or somewhere) were the ones who were constantly getting
mentioned by the (many) 914 drivers I asked at PCA events last year.

I've also heard good things about Rich Bontempi's place in Redwood
City ("High Performance House"), and had as well heard bad reports on
Garretson's.  I haven't tried any of these firsthand yet (I've been
doing my own work and setup so far) although I'll probably be hitting
Ken Mack soon for an alignment (can't do that well enough myself).

Good luck,

Thanks for reminding me, David.  I finally got the front end aligned last
week.  I went with as much negative camber and positive caster as I could
get (-0.5 degrees camber and about +8 degrees caster), and zero toe.

The rear toe is supposedly adjustable somewhere, but I can't figure out how
to do it.  Could someone describe to me how to adjust rear toe in a 914?
Rear camber is also adjustable by shims.

I'm somewhat concerned about these, because the current specs in the back
are:
		LEFT		RIGHT
Toe		1/16" out	1/4" out
Camber		-1.5 degrees	-2.5 degrees

These are greatly different, and I'd really like to adjust them...  I can
probably figure out the camber, but haven't really looked yet.  Toe is the
really important one.  It's probably because I've still got the original
100K mile old rear springs, which are no longer the same length (the right
side is about 1/2" longer).

I am a member, and noticed that timely article.  Unfortunately, it's not too
helpful.  I question the fact that everyone seems to use toe-in all around
rather than toe-out; the usual setup for any car is a little toe-out in
front, and most mid-engine cars get a little toe-out in back, too.  They
also use less camber and caster all around than I would have thought.

Now, I don't profess to know anything about setting up a 914, or any
mid-engine cars, for that matter.  Hell, I don't even know anything about
any RWD car.  But the theory is still the same for any car, and I'm somewhat
amazed by what they show in this table.

Any other 914 autocrossers have any tips to share?  Thanks for any help!

My understanding is that mechanics do pay for their mistakes.  The explanations
I've gotten have always been a little confusing, perhaps because different folks
have slightly different rules.  They own their own tools.

Subject: Bad experience at Garretson's in Mt. View, CA


Well, I didn't work for a dealer, but I know many who did.  PCNA
establishes "book labor" times for specific jobs (I'm [retty sure it's
that way for most manufacturers).  The shop charges (or is reembursed
on warranty jobs) the book time, regardless of how long the job took,
and that time usually has some built in leeway.  If they go over,
though, or if an extra part is needed due to error, the shop has to
eat the cost.  On warranty jobs, if you document the mistake PCNA is
usually tolerant and will cover it (as long as it's not happening a
lot from one shop or mechanic), otherwise it may come out of the
mechanics pocket.  This rule depends on the dealership, though, and
some may cover mistakes as long as there aren't too many.  Independant
shops have to charge less that book to compete, and thus have less
leeway, but they also have more at risk if the customer is
dissatisfied.  It really is tough, I have sympathy for people who run
these businesses...

It's real hard to lose a dealership because of customer complaints.
ALthough it's probably happened, I don't know of any cases and I know
some BAD dealerships (service wise).  They're really not risking that
much. 

As far as I know, all mechanics own their tools, whether it's a dealer
or not.

Subject: 911 Valve Adjustment...

Ok - here's the deal:  I adjust the valves on my 911 to perfection using
the special adjustment feeler gauge, as well as the micrometer setup, and
the car runs great.  The following days after the adjustment the car runs
progressively rougher and upon checking the valves they seem to have a
bigger gap than when I set them.  What gives?  Is there some trick I am
missing in my procedure?  I am tightening the nuts on the valve adjusters
to a reasonable level, given that they are thin 13mm nuts and are covered with
oil.  Is there something I can do to "settle" them (like beat on them with a
hammer maybe) ?

Frustrated,

Subject: auto-x class (more)
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

I received some info requests regarding the auto-x school I attended last
weekend.  I'll summarize the class a little more completely here.

Saturday:

First drill:
      Skid pad.  150' dia. circle.  Goal is to get just on the edge of a 
      drift.  LIGHT touches on the throttle are the name of the game here.
      Make that LIGHT and SMOOTH touches!

Second drill:
      Crossover.  Kind of a squared off figure 8.  Goal is to hit the turns
      correctly, then set up for the next turn after the straight.  Stay at
      the edge of the track whenever possible to optimize the next turn.
      There is a lot of emphasis on late apex turns throughout the course.

Third drill:
      Decreasing radius turns.  This course is hard to describe.  The turns 
      get tighter as you go through them.  Late apexes are essential.

Fourth drill:
      Boxed chicane (sp?).  Another hard one to describe.  A 90 degree
      turn followed by another 90 degree turn in the opposite direction.
      The dirll here was two straigt sections connected by two sets of 
      six 90 degree turns.  I guess that would be 2 chicanes sort of connected
      by a squared off U-turn.  I am a little unclear about the exact terms.
      Chicanes are often used to slow you down before a straight.  The goal
      is to set up to accelerate as soon as possible comming out.  This will
      usually entail A LOT of deceleration comming into the turn.

Fifth drill:
      Slalom.  Evenly spaced cones (75' interval).  This actually got fairly
      boring (much to my suprise), fairly quickly.  One of the instructors 
      commented that it is easy to LOOSE time in a slalom (hitting a cone is
      the easiest method), but hard to gain any.  You really are limited by
      by the cone spacing.  One point, pace the cones and determine if they
      are evenly spaced or not.  If the interval is increasing, you will be
      able to accelerate at the end, if decreasing, you MUST lift the throttle
      slightly.  Of course, throttle lift can bring your back end around (911's
      in particular).  No one did the cadillac commercial :-(

Sixth drill:
      Oval.  Need I say more?  This was supposed to be a gear shifting drill.
      However, they made it too small for the 911SC's to get out of second.
      Late apexes are essential here, as you will be accelerating down a long
      straight after the turn.

Seventh drill:
      Dinner and party at the holiday inn in santa nella.  I missed the after 
      dinner part of this drill 'cause I got up at 4:30 am and went to sleep 
      about 9:30.  ;-)

Sunday:

Course 1:
      Slow, tight auto-x course.

Course 2:
      Faster, more open course.  I suspect course 1 was more typical.

Both courses incorporated aspects from the drills (except drill 7) which we
now had to put together.

Everyone ran and worked both courses.  I found that working the course REALLY
helped me to run it later.  I was able to watch what did, and did not, work.
One suggestion from this is: work the course before running (if possible) and
find out who (if you don't know already) the "big boys" (and girls!) are. 
Watch the lines they use and try to follow them on your run.

At the risk of restarting the air/water wars, I did notice one interesting 
thing:  Out of about 75 or 80 students, there were (maybe) 10 or 15 water
cooled cars, 1 928, the rest 944's (didn't notice any 924's).  The remainder
were about 40% 914's, 40% 911's, 20% 356's & 912's.

Costs:
      Course cost: $45
      Fuel:        $20  (including driving from mountain view to crows landing)
      Hotel:       $25  (shared double room)
      Tires:      $150  (hard to estimate, crows is hard on tires; it is a
                         concrete surface.  Also, we made more runs than 
                         would be possible in a normal auto-x)

A final point, the instructors were drivers that normally drove the same car
as you, i.e., you got a 911 driver teaching other 911 drivers.  I don't think
this is as critical with non-911 cars, but I really appreciated having 
instructors who could tell me how the start to drift the rear end with a 
(remarkablely small) throttle lift.  I also learned a lot about not unsettling
the car (innappropriate braking), i.e., the instructor said: "next time brake
just where you did this time, get through the gate, go back on the gas, DON'T
brake, just lift the throttle A LITTLE; this will bring the rear around just
a bit, get through the next gate, lift again, get through the last gate, get
SMOOTHLY on the gas again, and open up the wheel a little more than you did
this run to finish just at the outside of the lane going past the timing mark."

You know what?  She was right.  The next run felt really good, except for 
missing a gate on the parctice lap and mowing down some cones, thus getting a
slow start and a poor time.  However, the run after that, I turned in my best 
time by almost a second!

A few more details, the instructors rode with you during both the drills and 
the course runs.  This helped a lot, as you could get VERY helpfull suggestions
while you were driving.

If you have not atuo-xed before, don't go in thinking you know everything, no
matter how good a street racer you are.  There is still a lot to learn.  Also,
don't be afraid of driving hard.  So you hit a few cones.  Big deal.

I still haven't checked if there is another school this year, will try to get
that information later.

There are two auto-x's june 1 and 2.  6/1 is in santa rosa, 6/2 is at crows
landing.

I expect to be at santa rosa.  My car is a blue 1980 911SC, license 2RZD855.
So if anyone is up there, say hello.

Subject: 911 Valve Adjustment...


1) Make sure the engine is COLD.  Porsche recommends something like 12
   hours wait after running the engine.
2) Make sure, when doing to adjustment, that you are breaking the oil
   seal between the rocker arm and the cam, and especially between the
   rocker arm and the lifter.  Grab the rocker arm and pull it back
   and forth, you should be able to feel the gap.  Sliding in the
   feeler gauge won't break the seal.  This is the most common cause
   of loose valves.
3) use a box end wrench, not an open end, and make sure the nuts are
   very tight.  I don't think you can strip them with a 13mm box end
   unless you are Arnold.
4) do them 1-6-2-4-3-5 and then go around one more time and check all
   of them - gap and tightness of the nut.  This usually prevents
   erroneous readings from any debris.  Always do one complete
   rotation where you haven't checked anything.

Also check the cam lobes for wear, and that the valve stem is very
snug (it shouldn't jiggle).  Also make sure your rocker arms aren't
bent or broken.  If all this seems obvious to you, let me know and we
can get deeper.

I must be a real downer for all you guys.  Every time I post it's
because I'm having some problem with my 914.  But I keep getting
such good advice...

So, the brakes are fine now, and I drove it around for a couple of
days (great fun) and now I notice that some of the windshield chrome
on the passenger side is loose, so I push on the inside of the
windshield glass with my fingers and the glass moves.  Sigh.

The windshield is in good shape.  It's not chipped or anything.  I
guess what I need to do is remove it and reinstall it (or have that
done).  How do you do this?  Haynes essentially says "You're not a
professional, so you can't be removing and reinstalling the windshield
or the rear window."  Has anyone removed or installed a windshield on
a 914?  Ought I pay a porsche body shop tons o' bucks rather than risk
it falling out?

I recently got one of these and so far I am real happy with it.  I 
wanted to replace the acid eaten carpet in my 911 and didn't want to
start the whole process over again; also, I continually got a mild 
corrosion in areas around the battery which I got tired of fighting
with baking soda, wire brush, paint and invective.  I can't really
speak to the cold starting capabilities (for obvious reasons) but 
otherwise it seems to be an excellent and well made item.  I
remember that the guarantee seemed better than the average type battery.
My dealings with AutoMechanika have been excellent as well.  I
don't believe the brand name is Gates however.  I will post in the
next couple of days the details of cold cranking amps, warranty 
period, etc.

IMHO this is a real godsend for cars like ours that mount an acid-filled
and corossive gas spewing device close-in to our precious bodywork.
I will be interested to see how it performs over the long haul.

Subject: 914 rear brakes (again)

.. or maybe that should be 914 rear brakes (still).  Argh, boy is this
frustrating.

Anyway, thanks to Mark Skala, I now have all the parts I need to put together
two complete rear brake calipers.  Unfortunately, when I do so, the inner
pistons still won't budge.  The little allen screw thingie turns, and feels
like it's working some mechanism inside, but the piston doesn't actually
retract.

So, I probably need to rebuild these calipers.  Can anyone explain what's
involved in this?  I'm mostly concerned about it because (1) I've never
rebuilt a brake caliper before, although I'm not afraid of it, and (2) many
sources indicate that these calipers cannot be rebuilt, although I've seen
rebuild kits available.  But there must be a reason why they say they're not
rebuildable...

Thanks again for your continued help!

Mark

Subject: 914 Windshield remove/install ?


   days (great fun) and now I notice that some of the windshield chrome
   on the passenger side is loose, so I push on the inside of the
   windshield glass with my fingers and the glass moves.  Sigh.

What do you mean by "moves"?  There's nothing wrong with a *little*
play, but there should be too much and it shouldn't leak.  It
is quite possible that the winshield was installed wrong, it's quite
easy to get wrong and not realize it.  The best way to check is if it
leaks water.
	
   The windshield is in good shape.  It's not chipped or anything.  I
   guess what I need to do is remove it and reinstall it (or have that
   done).  How do you do this?  Haynes essentially says "You're not a
   professional, so you can't be removing and reinstalling the windshield
   or the rear window."  Has anyone removed or installed a windshield on
   a 914?  Ought I pay a porsche body shop tons o' bucks rather than risk
   it falling out?

It won't fall out.  It's not that complex to do, it just requires AT
LEAST two people and is a royal pain.  A big royal pain.  Perhaps the
biggest of any job, which is why it's frequently done wrong - many
people "just leave it" if it isn't perfect.  

Find out how much it is at a shop, it may be cheap enough that it's
not worth the trouble for you to do it.  The first time I ever did it
took something like 10 or 12 hours (start to finish).  The next time
it took more like 6 to 8.

   I've been contemplating replacing my leaky front windshield seal on my 911
(replace the headliner too?  hmmm...self-inflicted torture) and asked my
local mechanic about doing it myself - I've already done the rear window.  He
said if I do it, I _will_ break it because the windshield is laminated glass
as opposed to the tempered glass on the rest of the car (He pointed to a rock
pock mark, smiled, and said it would break right there).  We agreed that a
windshield place should probably do the dirty work so that I could blame them
when the windshield broke.

  I don't know if it is the same case with 914's...just food for thought.  914
owners are lucky - they don't have to take out the windshield to replace the
dash.

The 914 front windshield (at least mine) is also laminated -- I'm not
really considering doing the work myself anymore -- too many horror
stories.  Not only could I break the windshield (which has got to be
expensive) but I imagine I could really hurt myself!

Yeah, but all 914 owners have is a 914!  I really wouldn't mind having
a 911...

Be very careful of the trim itself. It is aluminum, not chrome, it bends
easily never to straighten again, and bends itself easily from the
wind if it is loose.

The 914 windshield mounting method is to my knowledge very different
from that for a 911. The 911 has a rubber gasket, effectively with
two notches, one for the body sheet metal edge and one for the windshield.
getting the windshield into its notch without breaking it is a trick.

I have never installed a 914 windshield, but I have removed one,
and it appears to be bonded with a rubberized glue which effectively
glues the windshield to a parallel section of body sheet metal.
There is no tricky gasket at all. I would be concerned by movement of
the glass given the 914 mounting approach. You might be able to do some
selective re-glueing without removing the windshield, but I am not
sure what to suggest as the glue.

Subject: Long Term Storage of 911

It look as though I might have to keep my `73 911T of the road for some time and i'm a bit concerned about the effects on the engine. I've heard that, for example 944 Cylinder bores `dry out` if not used for some time (the effects of the silicon ?), does this apply to 911's.


Are there any recommended procedures, Eg starting periodically, special lubrication etc??

Any advice appreciated!!

This topic has come up before - perhaps someone has it saved and can
forward it to Kevin.  One thing I would like to add, which I have not
seen here or in any book: back off the valve adjusters enough that
none of the valves are depressed.  I have dissassembled many core
engines, some of which had been sitting in junkyards or under a tree
in someone's back yard for years.  Invariably, the cylinders that are
rusted are those with an open valve.

Here are the specs on the Optima sealed batery from AutoMechanika:

600 cold cranking amps

120 min reserve power

24 month full unlimited warranty

72 month limited (prorated) warranty

"not recommended for deep drain applications (ie: fishing motors, solar
power installations, RV electrical systems)"

P.S.  The thing is physically smaller than the standard group whatever 
that is normally used, hence the need for the $10.00 adaptor plate that
you also get from AutoMechanika.  In my case this required a new ground
cable, be ready for this.  I just looked and after two months or so
my battery area is clean as clean can be.  I just might by one of these
dudes for my Toyota pickup.

I have never heard of "cylinder bores drying out."  In fact, I don't even know
what a "cylinder bore" is.  Maybe it's that guy who can't stop talking about the
comparative virtues of Nikasil vs. Alusil.

Porsche issued two tech bulletins with their recommendations for storage of both
new and used cars a couple of years ago.  I would be happy to forward copies to
you, Kevin, given a USPS binding.

Regarding periodic starting.  If you do start the car, drive long enough that
you drive the moisture out of the exhaust system.  On a sunny day, take a twenty
to thiry minute spin.  You don't have to hammer the car, just find a highway and
go cruising.

What you do before storing the car depends a bit on just how long you plan to
keep it in storage, as well as what kind of storage site you plan to use.  There
are also some outdated storage practices which you may be tempted to use, like
unweighting the tires by jacking the car.  I think the bulletins go into this.

Can anyone recommend a beginners' autocross in Southern California?

BTW, I've got a '69 912, and I'd like to do it more justice (bought it last
October - no wrecks or close calls, but I KNOW I can drive better).

Please include prices.  Thanks.....

I have an '81 928s (Euro) and the oil pressure gauge constantly

5 bar for anything above 1,500rpm.  I've replaced the oil

What's wrong?

John,

First I dont know of any problems associated with HIGH oil pressure, as
long as you're not blowwing hoses, seals, etc.

Since you have replace the sending unit, I suspect that it reads high, 
because the pressure is high.

There is usually (I don't know anything about 928's) an oil pressure
relief valve.  This beast controls your oil pressure.  It may be out
of adjustment.

Again, though, I wonder, why do you want to reduce your oil pressure?
All your journal bearings will support more load with higher pressure, 
they will also maintain more clearance between the metal surfaces with
higher pressure (this avoids damage if there is crud in your oil).

I would determine that there is a possible problem with high pressure
before doing anything to lower my oil pressure.  Of couse, I drive 
a 911, and you know how neurotic we get about oil...

A friend at work sez I should have to file an EIR when I do an oil change...

Oil:  It's a coolant.  No, it's a lubricant!

It's a COOLANT and a LUBRICANT!

A PCA friend, Michele Sceppa, has a beautiful, guards red '87 924S for sale.  If
you're in Zone 1, you have probably seen it on display at Zone and regional
concours, where it has done quite well.  It's not a "baggy" car - it does get
driven in nice weather!

Michele is selling it to move up to a 944S2 cabri she has on order.  Her asking
price is flexible and reasonable.  This would be a good purchase for someone
wanting to get into concoursing, or someone looking for a "like new" car at an
affordable price.

Mechanically, it's dead stock to the best of my knowledge.  Maintenance has been
done by European Performance, my favourite independent.  The car has a new motor
mount and timing belt.

I have no financial interest in the car or its sale...  Reply to me if you're
interested, and I'll put you in touch with Michele.

Subject: Mystery Crud in my engine oil!

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

Who can identify the Mystery Crud in my engine oil?

I removed the oil screen on my 914 this evening and discovered little
bits of red stuff caught in the screen.  I quickly recognized these as
pieces of the RTV I used when I installed the pushrod tube seals a few
months ago -- no biggie -- probably just means that half the oil
passages are plugged and half the bearings are getting no oil and the
engine will be completely shot in a couple more months.  Sigh.

Anyway, the Mystery Crud is something else.  It collected in the bottom
of the metal plate that holds the oil screen in (none of it was
actually caught in the screen itself).  It is hard bits (brittle, but I
can break it if I push on it hard with my fingernail) of stuff that
looks like it might once have formed an annular ring (like a seal) a
few inches in diameter.  It's hard to tell how big the ring would have
been because the broken pieces are pretty small.

So presumably some seal or plastic part in the engine has fallen to
bits and found its way to the oil sump.  My question, of course, is
what part?

The car really doesn't seem to leak or burn oil.  The owner manual says
1/2 to 1 quart of oil per 600 miles, but it's burning less than half a
quart in that time.  Plugs look OK.  Gets at least 32 mpg highway on
super.  The crap in the oil tell me the engine is rapidly turning to
shit, but all these other things (oil & fuel consumption, etc) make it
hard to take the Mystery Crud too seriously...

Depends on what years you want.  The PCNA Fact Books have been around since the
mid-80's I think, and offer the greatest detail on options available.  If you
want to go back further than that, you might want to consult Brett Johnson's
series, eg, "The 911 & 912 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity."  Other
books are alos very good, eg, Dean Batchelor's book.

If you have a particular car in mind, the factory can give you its build list
given its VIN.

I'll toss in a recommendation for the $89.95 Pyrometer available from

one myself, but without a car to campaign so far this year I haven't seen
much point in spending that money yet.  So this isn't a real endorsement,

For everyone - Paterek recommended a sealant that will dissolve in
oil, unlike the classic red, and thus wont damage things when the
excess breaks off.  It was from Wurth's I believe, I don't have the
list but it was reprinted in a lot of newsletters (it's fromthis
year's tech tactics).

NO idea what the other crud could be.

In case no one responded, 914 rear brakes are rebuildable.  I have
done it and they work perfectly well.  Remember that if the piston or
cylider is scored you must replace it.  There are a lot of people
parting out 914s that have decent used brakes for sale...

Subject: 914 Alignments


I was reading through the piles of mail and just noticed this one with
no responses:

   The rear toe is supposedly adjustable somewhere, but I can't figure out how
   to do it.  Could someone describe to me how to adjust rear toe in a 914?
   Rear camber is also adjustable by shims.

It's been a while, but I remember the  procedure, if no one responded
let me know.

   I'm somewhat concerned about these, because the current specs in the back
   are:
		   LEFT		RIGHT
   Toe		1/16" out	1/4" out
   Camber		-1.5 degrees	-2.5 degrees

   I am a member, and noticed that timely article.  Unfortunately, it's not too
   helpful.  I question the fact that everyone seems to use toe-in all around
   rather than toe-out; the usual setup for any car is a little toe-out in
   front, and most mid-engine cars get a little toe-out in back, too.  They
   also use less camber and caster all around than I would have thought.

Huh?  This is 100% contrary to what I learned.  Toe-out is supposedly
DANGEROUS - especially at speed.  Where did you get this information?
I was taught to align a car with a little toe-in in the back, to
insure that any measurement errors didn't translate into actual
toe-out.  I've never driven with toe-out so I don't know what it would
handle like.  But I learned this at a performance shop and they were
fairly serious about it.

Thanks, a number of people sent me messages on how to do it.  Thanks for all
the help!  For those who are curious, there were a couple of problems.  The
rear springs differ significantly in length; that's part of it.  Also, there
were two camber shims in the left rear, and only one in the right.  I was
also wrong about the toe; I had the signs wrong from the alignment computer
printout, so the above numbers should be toe-in, not out.

Anyway, for the hell of it last Sunday I removed all the camber shims (over
-3 degrees each side), and toed it out all the way (about 1/2" (!) total
toe-out), just to see what would happen.  The answer is, it oversteers a lot
and the rear tires (205/50-15 on stock 5.5" alloys) rub against the inner
fenderwells under cornering.

This weekend I'm trying one camber shim on each side (about -2.5 degrees)
and about zero toe (which should give me more power down the straights, too).

Well, yes, toe-out in back can be dangerous.  My car is a dedicated
autocrosser, and I want it to be very maneuverable (aka unstable).  Street
cars should definitely have toe-in in back, as should any car driven by
someone not very comfortable with being sideways.

I can understand the possibility that consiously planned instability
such as that caused by rear toe-out might be suitable for autocrossing
(not being a serious autocrosser myself). However, I think it is worth
saying that IMHO this does not extend to high speed track driving,
even for a very experienced driver. My understanding of the conventional
wisdom on the subject agrees with Chris', and I understand it to apply
to dedicated race drivers driving all types of race cars, and that is that
rear toe-out is deadly and to be avoided like the plague, including
the possibility of "dynamic" toe-out where bushing compliance causes
changes (in cars that have rubber or other compliant material). A good
reference is Caroll Smith in " Prepare to Win" or one of his other similar
books.

To make sure there is no confusion, front toe-out is a valid alternative
for high speed track driving. It improves turn-in at the expense of
straight line stability. Not all cars benefit from it or need it,
but it works in some cases.

I dunno about dangerous, but rear toe-out definitely messes up the handling.  My
car had gone for about a year and a half without alignment.  When I had it done,
the shop found a bit of toe-out in the rear.  Since fixing it, the 245/45's hunt
much much less on crowned or grooved roads.

I helped run a 911 tech session last year, despite my minor knowledge of the
series.  We pulled and clean the sump screen on a 70's car, probably the first
time in a loooong while it had been done.  And we found a lot of crud on it,
which looked in part kind of like an outdoors trash bag shredded into 1 and 2 mm
size pieces.  No doubt this was just varnish.

I don't know whether this is like the crud in question...
