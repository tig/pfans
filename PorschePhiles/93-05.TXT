Subject: Blast from the past...

I was looking for some old paperwork I *HAD* to find tonight, when I 
found it. I'd even forgotten I'd ever saved it, but there it was, lovingly
preserved for almost 23 years: Boy's Life, August 1971. The cover story:
Porsche. The start of my love affair with these silly things...

I was at that magical age where I was *very* conscious of cars, and just
coming to really know all the way to the depths of my soul that when I 
turned 16 and had that Majik Ticket to Drive, there wouldn't be a Ferrari
or Camaro SS or even a VW Beetle sitting in the driveway with my name on it. 
Instead I'd time-share a '65 Fairlane station wagon, if I was lucky. But I 
could dream...

And talk about the spark that ignited the dream! There on the cover -- 917s,
904s, 911s, and on the inside -- discussion of the 911S and 914/6GT!  It was
unbelieveable that this company I'd barely heard of was building cars
specifically to race! And then turning them into production cars that *ANYONE*
could buy...

I'd grown up watching Jim Hall bolt together Chaparalls and once in a blue
moon hearing Carrol Shelby talk about how hard it was to take a "regular car"
and go racing with it. And of course, I had a *HEAVY* investment in the
credo that "manufacturers race to improve the breed". But barely believed
it. Otherwise, *HOW* could you explain my mother's Olds 98?

But this -- THIS was different. The Real Deal. Something special.

Finding that magazine brought it all back. I had to take a break, and 
after a while go to the garage and kiss my 911. Then write this note to 
the rest of you Porschephiles out there.

Have a *VERY* good weekend.

I don't think you can, because Porsche made different screw tappings in

The alternator most likely isn't getting juice to the battery.  Could 
be the regulator (if it's built in), or cable.  A dim alternator 
warning light should be considered "on"!

	Howdy all,

	In order to do some of the tests I need to do on the 914
fuel injection system I need a fuel pressure gauge.  Bosch fuel

a fuel pressure gauge that reads up to 80 or so PSI.  Does anyone

A few months ago, Automotion had their pressure gauge kit on sale.
For about $120 you could get the gauge (up to 150 PSI), the control
valve you need for some of the tests, and the fittings for CIS, Motronic,
L-jet, and D-jet.

Since that's more than a gauge alone usually costs, I grabbed a set.
Well worth it, if you do a lot of FI work.

I think that Performance Products also carries this sucker. Dunno

MAC tools (contact your local MAC rep) has such a tool. It is
P/N FIT113, Fuel Injector Tester, $42.85. It is for L&D jet systems.
The CIS version is P/N FIT14 and is $73.45. Prices are from 1990.

Nguyen writes:

Hello everyone, first let me apology to the group if any
of the question that I've been posting has been discussed
before. As you can see by my recent slew of posting, I'm
a new owner of an 80-911SC. Anyway here are some more 
questions.

1_ The alternator warning light comes on (dimly) while
   driving. It turns off when the engine's speed is above 
   4500 RPM. I check the V-belt and it looks ok. Does
   this mean something wrong with the alternator or regu-
   lator? How can I check them? Has anyone replace/repair
   both of these components? Please email procedure or
   source for procedure.

**  When this happened on my car (I think the light just stayed 
on), it was the alternator.  Assuming there are no loose wires,
it is probably the alternator or voltage regulator.  The alternator
could just be bad brushes.  I had my alternator rebuilt at the 
local alternator repair shop (yellow pages) for about $75.  They
also tested the voltage regulator.

Getting the thing out:

I can't remember all the details.  It's behind the fan.  You wind up
loosening (removing?) the fan shroud and working you hands behind the
fan to disconnect wires.  The fan blade stays on the alt.


2_ When the ignition switch is in the on position, a very
   high pitch noise is generated somewhere in the engine
   compartment. It continue to be generated when the engine
   is running. Has anyone running into this problem before?
   If yes what is it and how do I fix it?

**  It's the ignition system.  As far as I know it's normal.  Don't
"fix" it.


3_ How does one go about lowering the idle speed?

**  Large sloted screw head (rectangular head) facing the left side of
the engine compartment.  It's behind the heater blower.  Use a short 
screwdriver.


4_ Is it possible for a shade-tree mechanic to perform
   a tune-up on this engine? Please email procedure. I
   have the Bruce Anderson book, but it does not have
   procedure for this.

**  What's a tune up mean to you?  You can: replace plugs, set timing,
set idle, adjust valves.  The mixture is (mostly) self adjusting.  There
is an idle mixture adjustment; I'd avoid messing with it.  You need to 
understand about CIS injection first.  The bosch tech manual or Probst's
book are good places to start.


5_ How do I go about raising the car 1-2 inches? It's
   been lowered.

**  Front height is adjusted by two bolts under the A-arms.  Rear height
(unless the car has been converted to adjustable spring plates) requires
removal of the rear torsion bars.  Look at the front end of the rear 
trailing arms.  If there is a bolt kind of hanging off the side,
they are adjustable.

Beware of raising the front only.  The front should be slightly lower
than the rear (about an inch).  If you get a slight angle on steep
driveways, you may reduce the frequency of scrapes.  Of course, a 
LARGE angle is better!

Well, since Stan started this (:-) I'll add to it. Here it is in front of
me. The April 1971 issue of the French magazine "Moteurs", with a
romantic-lookign lady draped over the new Ferrari 365 GTC4 on the cover.
But what's more important are the two articles inside on the 914/6 and the
911S. Our neighbour had just bought a 914, and I fell in love with it. When
Moteurs featured road tests of the new 914 and 911, I bought the issue (I
was a kid then, with not too many means to buy magazine issues at will: I
use to browse them at the store until I got kicked out; also, we didn't get
Road & Track or the other American car magazines). This marked my first
REAL interest in production cars. Until then it had always been rallyes and
F1. It's been with me since 1971, through several moves. It always sits on
one of the shelves of the library, not with the other dozen boxes of car
magazines.

In that issue, among other things, are incredibly detailed reports of all
kinds of motorsports, including the South African GP (won by Andretti in
the Ferrari), rallyes, new car prices, technical interviews, the "Salon de
Geneve" auto show (featuring the new Lambo LP 500, the Maserati Bora and
the Lotus Elan), and article on Harleys, and a report on the Land speed
record at the Bonneville Flats. All this with great pictures. They don't

in the wiring somewhere. Anyone has a set of authentic Porsche

Porschephiles,

Well I took my stock 80 911sc on 225/50-15RS drag racing this weekend,

1st pass, with a not so hot start, at the quarter 14.45 sec @94 MPH

2nd pass lost the clutch :-(.  I KNOW, I KNOW its not a dragster.

The whole reason I did this is at my local club people
think I have a non stock motor. But, my good friend with
a porsche shop, and I redid the top end and fix some broken
head studs this summer. All we did was freshen it up optimise
the cam and ignition timing, but it is a stock 930/07 USA
1980 911SC motor.

1ST question:
Is there a stronger clutch without going to the RSR set-up or a puc,
this is my street car. I heard the turbo clutch won't work.
Yes, I know I need to fix the driver 1st, but I use it at club events
every month, so a good clutch would help until I learn to start 
right.

2nd question:
Can it make any sense that I am making more power than most stock
engines, maybe a good one from the factory?

Thanks in advance,

Greg

PS. I think it has the stock 915 ratios for that year. Because on an early
morning dive in the desert I saw 150 mph at 6250 rpm. :-) so 
I doubt it has short gears.

Hmmm. Seeing all the nostalgia that the old magazines invoke reminds me
of several years of old auto magazines that are gathering dust in my
closet, and that might be more useful to someone else. If memory serves
me correctly, they are mostly 1960s, some 1970s Road and Track, a
smattering of early Car & Driver, and onesie-twosie Sports Car
Graphics.

A few memories come back: R&T was published then by John and (Elaine?)
Bond in Newport Beach, CA; somewhere in the set there is are road tests
of a steam locomotive and a jet fighter; and probably several Porsche
tests (356C, original 911, etc.) Upstart Car and Driver offered an
alternative to the style of R&T. There was still lots of sports car
activity in Great Britain; Ferrari, Maserati, and Lamborghini were the
real hot stuff; the Porsche horizontally opposed 8 cylinder Grand Prix
car. Drivers - among them (Juan Manuel but everybody called him)
Fangio, Phil Hill, Jimmy Clark, Stirling Moss, Graham Hill...saw Graham
Hill start a 2nd heat at Laguna Seca dead last (the field had driven off)
because the clutch in his car (a Lotus) had failed requiring the car to
be push started; he won the heat! Auto activities in Japan were given
polite notice by the press; Honda fielded a grand prix car that performed
respectively, and as I recall, had a power range between 12K and 15K
RPM, with pistons reportedly, perhaps exaggerated, the size of thimbles.
Sigh. I grew up in Nevada, and there were no speed limits except in the
towns; no national speed limits; no freeways (for passing power on two
lane roads, _we_ _really_ need that big engine in our new family sedan,
went the line from husband to wife); and best of all, no government
involvement in the love of the owner for his car and being able to make
any modification desired and then Take 'er Out and She What She'll Do.

If any of you are interested in the magazines, e-mail me direct; I'll
get an inventory back to you (presuming I don't get lost in
nostalgia-land while handling them) and we can take it from there. I'm
not interested in hard ball negotiating to get the highest price; if
the best offer were to be payment of shipping charges I will let them
go for that amount. I expect they _are_ worth something, though.

Porschephiles,

I forgot to mention that I have already changed the clutch to a
spring centered disk.

Also looking at an ad from Vosak Polak you can get an RSR clutch
disc, instead of a PUC type. I would imagine the RSR disk would
give OK feel,and better durability than stock. Is an RSR pressure 
plate lighter than stock SC?

Any comment on this set-up?

I wanted to check on this to be absolutely sure FIRST.

In VW-land, there was the 411, which had a 1.7 *identical* to the 914 1.7,
and the 412, which had a 1.8 *identical* to the 914 1.8. That's *ONLY* 
insofar as "hard parts" go, though. The similarity ended at the edges of
the case. The flywheel and "parts south" differed from Type IV to 914.
The 411 had AFC ("flapper box") EFI whereas the 914 had MPC EFI. The
412 and 914 1.8 shared *ALMOST* the same AFC EFI. Heater and exhaust systems
were substantially different, as were many facets of the electricals.

The VW Type IV did predate the 914, at least in Europe. Some European
models had dual Solex carbs, some had EFI.

In 914-land, the 1.7 had the new Bosch MPC EFI, which gave *MUCH* better
performance than the VW AFC EFI as it basicly calculated gas required based 
on engine load as approximated by differential manifold pressure and as 
measured by engine RPM (knowing the engine size in advance, of course). 
The 1.8, which used the AFC was seen as a giant step backwards when in 
actuality it gave greater accuracy in the measurement of air coming into 
the engine and had the potential for even higher performance by more efficient 
calculations of gas demand to keep combustion at about 0.9 lambda. 

[sidebar: note if you will that the AFC flapper box is *STILL* the basis
for the most sophisticated DME systems Bosch sells. By way of contrast,
the MPC system was used on *TWO* cars ever -- the 914 and some Mercedes
coupe.]

The 1.8 also has bigger valves -- disproportionately bigger than a 0.1 liter
increase might dictate. And re-contoured ports. And some slight differences
in the contours of the case internally, which *may* make the oil less likely
to foam. (that's the best guess, anyway). So it *IS* different from the 
1.7, and the advice on that seemed to come from Weissach.

The reason for the apparent difference in performance was that a tradeoff
was made in the AFC measurement box: a smaller box, more capable of measuring
flow under 3000 RPM [where you are most of the time around town] was chosen 
over a large box, more capable of handling high-volume flow and giving 
accurate measurements over 5000 RPM [where you are most of the time around
Watkin's Glen]. Hence, the MPC box "knew" how much gas to send because it 
was measuring RPM and could interpolate the gas needed, assuming things like 
altitude and density of gasoline were roughly constant. But the AFC box would 
get all confused and not want to do much past 5400 RPM (varies by box, but 
this is what I've measured on the dyno).

Regarding reliability: I've *NEVER* replaced an airflow sensor. However,
it's the biggest most obvious part on the engine, so if it's not working
right, hey, let's replace it! Seriously, I have at least a passing respect 
for mechanics as a species, but those who don't know EFI and attempt
to work on it are beneath contempt. I've intervened in many, many cases where
*SOMETHING ELSE* was wrong with a car and one of these yo-yos wanted to replace
the EFI piece by piece until it started working again. The Myth of the Failed
Air Box is *HIGH* on that list. 

And please, remember that we're talking about stuff that's twenty years old 
here!  I mean, how sophisticated about EFI were *YOU* in '74? How about '84? 
When did it become "mainstream" -- about '88 or so? This stuff *ISN'T* rocket
science -- I've got a Honda motorcycle engine on a stand in my brother's
shop in far west Texas that has dual overhead cams, four valves per
cylinder, and two injectors per cylinder timed off of a notched belt and
driven by a Kuegelfischer-style pump. Date of manufacture: 1969. Makes about
70 HP on 462ccs. From about the time that 'mericun mechanics were just starting 
to figure out how those "other two holes" in the bottom of a carburetor opened 
up when you stood on the gas... 8{P

So, to recap: 914 != 411/412; AFC not bad; remarks about it's robustness
and performance are imprudent.

	Howdy all,

	This past weekend I was continuing my debugging of the 914's
(1.8L) fuel injection system and ran into a problem activating the
Cold Start Valve.  I got the new Air Flow Meter in and installed that,
and the car does seem to run better, but it doesn't idle.  It also
didn't get any easier to start.  You need to hold the pedal down to
the floor and pump it to get the engine to run...  So, it sounds
like the Cold Start Valve isn't working, right?  Well, I disconnected

out of the Cold Start Valve.  How can I short circuit the Cold Start 
Valve to get it to open (or at least SHOULD open).  Can I just 
connect +12Volts to one side and ground the other side?  The polarity
should matter, so which side is which?  And are there any other ways
that I can fool it into opening? As a side note:
this behavious probably indicates that the Thermo Time Switch is

the Cold Start Valve SHOULD run, right?

Hi there. I've been trying for a while now to buy a large number of spark
plugs (>200), to no avail. I have a Motorcraft part number, AG-403-Racing,
but the Motorcraft people say they haven't heard of them. Funny enough, a
local racing shop has a couple in stock, but can't order any more, at least
not within my time frame. Even funnier, I called Champion, and they gave me
a cross-reference to their own plug, which they say is equivalent to the
AG-403-Racing! Go figure! I'd like to call up NGK and ask them for their
equivalent plug, but I don't have their number. I tried posting on the net,
and sending to the wheel-to-wheel list, to no avail. I'd rather not go
through a retailer, esp. considering the mark-ups on such a large quantity
(you might not agree with this policy, but ...) So,

1. Does anyone know the number fo NGK? Autolite?
2. Does anybody deal with a trusted distributor?
3. I'd appreciate hints, tips, advice, hell even flames...

Subject: new car


Hi

Well, I'm sorry to say that I've finally gone and done it.  I've sold
the Carrera 4 and bought a TVR Griffith.  Chalk and cheese, I know, but
that's probably why I did it!  Should be losing the 4 this week and
collecting the Grif` next week.

The point of my message is this:  what do folks out there do about
changing cars when you've already got the car you always wanted?  I
mean obviously I still aspire to able to afford a Turbo S, or a Diablo,
or a 512TR, or ....  but given that I can't what do I do?  I've priced
up newer Carrera's, but what's the point - there's nothing wrong with
what I've got (well, servicing is getting a little expensive). I've
looked at other Porsche's, but they just don't do it for me like a 911
does.

So, I decided that I was in a trap and needed to break out of it, if
only so that I could enjoy buying a Porsche again in the future.

Now that I'm used to this performance of the 911 and summer's is almost
upon us I thought a 2 seater rag top might be nice.  Well, they don't
come much faster than a TVR Griffith, even that 'little' 4.0 version
I've bought. It's unlikely to be the 'weapon' for getting from A to B
across country that the 911 is, however I hope it'll have other
endearing qualities apart from it's straight line performance.  CAR
magazine did test around a track (Castle Combe, Wiltshire) 5 seconds
quicker than a Carrera 2 and it's a twisty-ish track so I'm hopeful.

Anyway that's all, but I would appreciate hearing from any other people
who might have experienced the same problem of moving on/up from a 911,
or any car they thought couldn't be bettered (for whatever reason).

Rob

Both the 914 1.7L and the '71-'73 VW 411 used D-Jetronic (MPC).  914 1.8L
and the '74+ VW 412 used L-Jetronic (AFC).

Yes.  The VW 411E had D-Jetronic, others had dual Solexes.

The D-Jetronic system was used on the following cars in the US market:
	Mercedes 280E ('71-'72)
	Mercedes 300 ('72)
	Mercedes 450-450E ('72-'75)
	Merkur Scorpio (!?!)
	Merkur XR4Ti (!?!)
	Porsche 914 1.7L
	Porsche 914 2.0L
	Saab 99 EMS ('70-'74)
	VW 1600E [Type 3]
	VW 411E 1.7L
	VW 412E 1.7L
	VW 412E 2.0L [was this available in the US?]
I believe the first one to use D-Jetronic was the '67 VW Type 3.  The 411
was introduced for 1969, and the 914 for 1970.  The list is extracted from
"Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management" by Charles Probst, available
from Robert Bentley publishing (617-545-4170).

And, yes, LH-Motronic (as used on the 928S4 and 928GT, among others) has
its roots in the humble AFC L-Jetronic...

    I still don't think you can argue with the fact that the 1.8 makes less

Step into the Way-Back Machine: in 1974, lots of things happened. That's
when the 5 MPH bumper laws hit, and the real start of the CA-style obnoxious
emission laws propogating to the rest of the country, and all kinds of other 
fun stuff. To reduce emissions, they lowered compression. Compression on the 
1.7 was 8.2:1, compression on the 1.8 went down to 7.3:1. The '73 CA 1.7 that 
you mention *ALSO* has a 7.3:1 compression, but less displacement (hence even
LESS power, right?)

Nope. The 2.0 was being raced in a variety of venues. The MPC system is just 
better for high RPM situations, unless you use a whole pile of umm, 
"sophisticated techniques" to compensate for design characteristics of the
AFC injection. *EXPENSIVE* "sophisticated techniques" that you can justify
for your personal car but that you can't justify for a production run.

That's why you have that otherwise-completely-useless 1st gear! 8{) Seriously,
you *can* fix the low-end power problem with when the engine is being
rebuilt, but you won't be legal for any "stock" classifications afterwards.
Unless stuff like that doesn't bother you...

Not necessarily. If the Cold Start Valve is dead, dead, dead, then the Thermo-
Time Switch can be OK, but ineffective. Check the valve first, then when
you're sure it's OK, check the switch. Remember, unlike the regular injectors,
the cold start valve only gets run a little bit every now and then. It does
tend to gum up and die much more frequently than a regular injector.

It could be like honda, change to newer tech systems on the cheaper cars so
as to not alienate your bigger customers if something goes wrong.  In the
mid 80's the CRX could be had with FI while the Accord still had a shitty
carb.  Just a guess.

stock except that I know from my previous car that this one is missing the
deceleration valve and the charcoal canister stuff, and I'd like to know
how to get it as close to normal as possible.  I have pano going back 3 years

1.7 is essentially the same as the '73 2.0. Or should be. So says The

First, a 1.2 ma draw will not (I repeat NOT, **not**, absolutly
will not) run your battery dead in a week.  Unless, or course,
the battery is hosed anyway.

I know there are some functions in the car that require power
all the time (most radios and (i think) the carrera (motronic)
fuel injection).  I had always assumed that these were fused...

Next, do you know about the fuses in the engine compartment?  
Actually, I don't know if they are present on an '86, though
they are on the '80.  These fuses are located on the left side
aft of the fuel filter (again on an older car).

Finally, is your battery clean?  With enough dirt on it, a battery
may discharge quickly.  I would also clean the terminals (with 
a scraper or wire brush type cleaner) as dirty terminals may 
keep you from getting a full charge.

  My '72 914 has it all stock, except for the injectors that are off

  Also, the '73 1.7l is closer to the 2.0l than my 1.7l.  I would go

I'm speculating, but does your DME "remember" fault codes and such?  If 
so, it'll pull a little current constantly for its memory.  It's quite 
possible that it wouldn't be fused - Porsche has a couple unfused 
circuits in the car.

Good Morning:

I'm hoping that I can get some information to end my confusion in
trying to find a new exhaust for my 1972 914. I've built upa 2.0
liter motor and have it installed in the car. But, I'm having trouble
getting the exhaust system worked out. Can someone here on the
Porschephiles list help me?

I have two separate pairs of exhaust manifolds w/ the exchangers but
each is slightly different so I don't know which set to use. The
diameter of the tubing where it mates to the head are the same on both
sets. However, on one set, about three or four inches from the flange
the pipes take a turn back up toward the body about four inches. I
assumed this was for better ground clearance since the ride height
varies from year to year. But, upon trying to bolt up a muffler I found
that the falnges at the muffler don't line up properly with the flanges
on the exhaust manifold. The muffler flanges aren't as wide as the
manifold flanges.

Does anyone know how far apart the flanges are supposed to be? Does this
measurement differ from year to year and from manifold to manifold?
Can I heat the exhaust manifolds and try to angle them closer together?
The flanges only seem to be out by roughly two inches.

Anyone have a spare 2.0 liter muffler for a 914 that they would be will-
ing to get rid of? Can anyone give me some help so I get the right parts
installed?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or info,

The cold start valve just needs 12 volts across it to open.  Polarity

LH-Motronic and LH-Jetronic don't use the flapper box.  They use a hot-wire
anemometer (look ma, no moving parts!) to measure air mass.  The rest of
the system is indeed derived from L-Jet, though.

Subject: 911 clutch


   Porschephiles,

   I forgot to mention that I have already changed the clutch to a
   spring centered disk.

   Also looking at an ad from Vosak Polak you can get an RSR clutch
   disc, instead of a PUC type. I would imagine the RSR disk would
   give OK feel,and better durability than stock. Is an RSR pressure 
   plate lighter than stock SC?

   Any comment on this set-up?

Here's the do-dad on the RSR clutch setup:

225mm. This setup works in 915 transmissions.
1. RSR disk: segmented 7 sections like a PUC type. Very hard
	material. Known to chew up flywheels and pressure 
	plates.
2. RSR pressure plate: aluminum like stock. Not appreciably
	lighter than stock but holds much more pressure.
3. RSR flywheel: steel, lightened.

All of these components together will make the clutch very
close to the PUC type, much stronger than stock, more 
durable but faster wearing and difficult to make a smooth
start.

A great (and popular) intermediate solution is to use just
the RSR pressure plate  with the stock 225mm spring
centered disk and the stock flywheel. Then you'll get the
increased holding power of the RSR pressure plate and the
benefits of the street disk/flywheel. You can go racing
with this too.

The PUC disk is altogether nasty and not recommended.

Subject: 911SC sump plate

Hi,

The sump plate for my 79 911SC has been stripped of the drain plug
threads. The part has been superceeded by the turbo sump plate,
according to GPR (German Parts & Restoration), which does not
have provision for the drain plug. Does anyone forsee a problem with
this? As far as I am concerned, the oil (Mobil 1) is changed often
enough that get the extra few quarts out of the sump is not critical.
But the advantage of having the magnetic drain plug in the old style
is lost. Any opinions?

You can still drain the last few quarts by loosening or removing
the plate.  This can get *messy*.

You should still have the magnetic plug in the oil tank, so that 
should not be a concern.

However, I personally would not leave that much old oil in the 
engine.  I figure that there are already 1-2 qts in the cooling 
system that do not get removed and I don't like that!

In your place, I would call a few salvage yards and find a used
plate.

How often is often enough?  I change my oil ('80 sc) about every 
3500 miles.  I do it more to remove particulate matter (can you 
say dirt?) than because I think the viscosity has changed.  I use 
Kendall instead of the synthetic primarily due to the cost.  

I suspect that with 3000-4000 change intervals the difference in 
wear is insignificant between synthetic and non-synthetic oils.
If anyone has information to the contrary please let me know!

Subject:  '81 SC oil and water leaks 

 I am slowly but surely investigating the possibilities of getting a '78+ 911SC and
coincidentally got talking with a guy on my hockey team who is just putting his
'81 up for sale for aprox. CND$22.5K (he says he may take CDN$20K or so ).
Although I doubt I can swing it right at this moment I investigated the details of the
car nonetheless to see what you can get out there. After asking many questions about
what work had been done on the car I felt that although the asking price may be a tad
high (or is it?Canadian $$ though) it had been well maintained. It had fresh paint,
new clutch, rebuilt tranny, rebuilt heads, brand new rubber and was just being tuned up
at the time. It has 55K miles and was brought to Canada from Florida. No winters.
 The thing that caught my attention was that he let slip out that it had a few *small*
oil leaks but the engine was still resonably clean compared to many other 911's. As
well I asked him if the Targa top leaked at all and he said "Oh yeah, a bit, if you 
leave it out in a downpour it'll have some water in the back, but I never drive it in
the rain". He tried to explain that there was a visible gap you could see a little
daylight through near the front of the pasenger window between the window and the 
Targa top. He was pretty vague but seemed to pass it off as a regular thing for a 
Targa top. He also said that it whistled at high speed. 
 My question is this. Are oil leaks (even small ones) and Targa top leaks a rather
common occurance for this vintage of 911. I would have thought that after all these
years Porsche would have perfected the Targa top and this relatively newer car would
not have bad rubber already. Also, if I paid $20K for a car and it leaked oil on a
regular basis (and probably increasing basis) I think I might get a little annoyed.
If you bought an Accura for 20K and it had a few *small* oil leaks, I think you might
be crying LEMON. I know this car is 12 years old but can you expect an oil leak free
911? Also, can all the oil leaks be fixed with the engine in the car as on the 914.

Back around '83 I put 2 liter jugs and a cam in a '74 1.8 with the stock FI.

*******

I think the plate is a bit thin for a helicoil.

In any event, a TimeSert (tm) is generally a better choice, 
though I wouldn't use one here anyway.  Just how much risk
are you willing to accept with your oil?

A timesert is a cylinder threaded on both the inside and outside.
A helicoil is just a coil.  Much less contact with the original 
metal.

Thanks.  Is there any benefit to running 2.0 injectors in the 1.7?  Since
(for '73) the computer is identical between the 1.7 and 2.0, and the
pressure sensor and injectors are different, I am assuming that these parts
are the final metering factor for the fuel and changing would probably
make it run worse.

    --Are you _sure_ it only has 55K miles?  I'm no 911 expert (to say the
least), but it sounds like someone did some real thrashing of the gearbox if it
and the clutch had to be re-done before 55K.  Also, I thought the heads would
last just a _wee_ bit longer, barring abuse.  You probably should not buy a car
with this many problems.  At least, not for _US_ $20K  (I have no real idea

John,

     I wouldn't touch an '81 SC with 55k miles, head and
transmission work, oil and water leaks, unless the price was VERY
attractive.  SC's are VERY robust.  The engines/ trans. are good
for 150k miles minimum.  My '83 with 110k miles shows no
degradation.  It leaks no oil when driven regularly.  When it
sits for a week, the oil return tubes start to leak as the oil
slowly drains from the tank into the case.  The tubes are easily
replaced, but the drips aren't a problem.  It sounds like your
friends car has not been well cared for.

For the 911, the following oil leaks can be fixed with the engine in
the car:

* indicates more commonly seen leak.

*1. Oil thermostat O-ring
 2. Oil pressure/temperature sender seal
*3. Oil return tubes (collapsing type)
*4. Camshaft O-ring/paper seal
 5. Any oil lines
 6. Valve covers
 7. Timing chain covers
 8. Timing chain housing to case <-- not 100% sure about this one.
*9. Front crank seal
 10. Intermediate shaft seal

Cannot be fixed with engine in car (without major difficulty and
perhaps some cutting of sheetmetal):

 1. Case halves leaking
 2. Cylinder to case seal (accompanies broken head stud)
*3. Cam housing to head
*4. Rear main seal

Since the big part of the MPC injection is that it *computes* the duration
that the injectors need to be open to supply the gas required, based on what 
it knows about engine speed and manifold pressure, a BIG part of that 
computation has to be knowing the flow rate of the injector.

If you change to bigger injectors, or to more fuel pressure, or modify the
pressure sensor, you *WILL* flow more gas. Depending on any number of other
things you may or may not have done, the car will either make *MUCH* more
power, or run very poorly.

PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Wow, here is is mid-month and I'm just getting the monthly updates
done! This is starting to sound familiar... Unfortunately, I'm just
busy, not getting rich at it...

My big news: I blew up a motor at TWS late in April. Well, "blew up" is 
a bit strong -- all of a sudden, my  exhaust valve clearance went from
.006 inch to .25+ inch. *NOT* good. Not conducive to running very well
either... I still haven't split the case, so I don't know why it happened.
A full report will be forthcoming once I open it up.

Point of interest: if you're a PCA member, would you be interested in
affiliating with an "electronic region" in addition to a local region?
And if you're not a PCA member, would you be interested in joining with
an "electronic region" as your "home" region? As an FYI, regions are
defined by ZIP code, and this idea of an "electronic region" that's global
(i.e. Porschephiles, of course!) has stirred in a few brains... This is 
just a feeler for support. I suppose that there would be region "goods"
like T-shirts, patches, car badges, etc. to show that you're not just a
PCA member, you're one of The Elite...

Last call: is there any interest in a Porschephiles get-together at 
Parade? I'm not sure I'll be there, but there is a very good chance of
it....

A FAQ is supposedly under preparation. 

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available, which is perhaps unfortunate. Oh well.

Remember, while it seems like a good idea when you're first starting out
on the list to know what has gone on before, there are OVER 7 MEG of 
archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. Period. And PLEASE DO 
NOT FTP between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll have to take access away. 
We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, you know...  Also DO NOT 
ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in

        The disk thickness is OK and I did replace the pads so I guess my
idea about piston travel may not be the case. I think what Bill Buetow said
about the master cylinder seals leaking may be what's causing the problem.
Now I have to figure out if I should try and rebuild the master cylinder or
replace it to the tune of $150 (not to bad but the rebuild kit is $80 )
After redoing the master cylinder the manual says that I have to bleed the
brakes and clutch. I've never done the clutch and from previous posts it
seems like some what of a pain.

        Anyone ever rebuilt/replaced a master cylinder on a 944?

        Advice on bleeding the clutch?

This *might* be normal.  The rear brakes don't get a lot of wear, so 
it's very possible that they just aren't worn in yet.  For instance, 
I've replaced 5 sets of front rotors on my 951, and 0 rears, after 68K 
miles and about 5K on the track!  I haven't needed to even resurface 
the rears...

             Also, one of those little hand pumps works nicely.
          Have a freind up to pouring fluid in (almost constantly)
          as you pump from under the car.  If you don't get any

I suspect that the loser engineer is the one who chose the angled mounting.
I assume that the cylinder itself is a stardard or near-standard ATE
part.

To provide further support, the combination of jacking the back very high
and keeping the reservoir full does work. I would not expect problems if
you do these carefully.

You don't need the friend if you use the often discussed technique of
applying 20 PSI or so to the air above the fluid reservoir. This works
fine for the clutch as well as the brakes. Just bleed slowly, to
avoid sucking air.

Subject: Re: Caliper - Master cylinder part II

Blaine -

Not clear on what your criterion is for the rear brakes doing nothing.  They
do tend to wear pads and rotors a lot less quickly than the fronts.  To get
a measure of the relative braking force at a particular end, first set the
brake pedal at some fixed position, eg, by wedging a length of 2 x 4 between
the pedal and the seat.  Then, with the car jacked, use a swept-wand-type
(non-click) torque wrench on a lug nut, at right angles to the radius from
the axle axis to that lug.  Be careful not to exceed the torque spec for the
lug nut.

You should not need to bleed the clutch after doing a MC replacement if you
pinch off the blue braided supply hose from the reservoir to the clutch MC. 
Any air between the pinch and reservoir can be removed by gravity after
reconnecting.  Otherwise, don't try bleeding the clucth without a
positive-pressure (ie, at the reservoir) power bleeder.

Notwithstanding absolute wear limits, marginal rotors will reduce brake
effectiveness at the track.  This is because rotors sink heat energy, and a
smaller rotor mass will mean a hotter rotor, meaning pad fade and fluid boil
problems.  Rotors are cheap and easy to replace.

Subject: Thermovalve on a 911?

In the latest Excellence, there was a question about a '79 930
idling fast when cold to which they replied that it was normal, and then
started talking about the thermo-time valve which tells the ignition to
advance itself 15 degrees, blah blah. (I think that's what they mean)

So, my question is:

Does my 1980 911SC have a similar system to prevent sputtering and backfiring
when the engine is cold? My idle is the same on cold and warm -- somewhere
around 900 to 1000 RPM, but my car does need to be warmed up for a small
period of time when cold to make it drivable. If my 911SC is supposed to
idle faster when cold, would all I need to do is replace the thermovalve?
(cheap question -- it's probably more complicated than that! :-))

That's basicly it. You'll also want cam, and maybe head work too. Depends.

For the "much more power" you'll also want to boost compression to about
9.5:1, which is pretty much the limit for air cooled small engines on
street gas (that's super unleaded street gas, too). I recommend using the
flat top pistons and 0.0mm of deck height, then re-contouring the combustion
chamber to give you the right number of CC's for 9.5:1. This may mean you
flycut the head up to 1.50mm or that you have to re-shape one or more chambers
to bring up the volume a little bit (i.e. remove metal for more space). If
*all* the chambers are too small, you can use spacers to add deck height.

It's interesting to note that all of the significant experimental work in
this area was done in the 1920's by the air cooled airplane engine guys...

Well, the executive summary is: different problem.

You *DO* get a faster idle until the engine is warm. That's normal on
(near as I can tell) *ALL* cars. However, in really warm parts of the
country (like Houston) the engine gets warm really quickly, so you hardly
notice.

Your problem sounds very different. If it's the "won't take the gas" problem,
where if sputters and dies if you mash the accelerator pedal, then you
definitely have a different problem. Since that's what it *sounds* like you
have, from your description, I'll discuss that some...

I have the same problem with my 911SC. It runs *GREAT* -- once it's warm. 
But it may have to idle (roughly, at that) for up to 2 minutes before I
can give it enough gas to get it out of the driveway without popping and
maybe backfiring. This has developed in the last 6-9 months, and for the
previous several years, did not happen. Hence I beleive that it's some
kind of part failure as opposed to a "feature" of the engine.

I have replaced the control pressure regulator (A.K.A. warmup regulator)
because that's what's traditionally wrong when this happens. No change. I
then replaced by aux air valve, because that's the number two cause of this
symptom. No change. So now I'm down to the real problem....

It seems to be the case that I'm getting un-metered air into the system, via
some channel that closes up when the engine gets warm. So my next foray will
be to go check the engine air plumbing (including injector seals) for leaks.
Simplest way to do that it is spray carb cleaner on/near anything you think
is leaking air. If it is, then the engine speed will jump up as it gets a boost
of "enriched air" carrying carb cleaner. If that doesn't pan out, I'm just 
gonna have to get out the gauge set and check all the control pressures. 

Last possiblility is that the lambda stuff is hosed, if you have that. I don't.

There are really two different heat exchanger types: the under-2.0, and
the 2.0. All my 2.0 stuff is on cars right now, but the tubing that
mates to the head forms an oval of roughly 1.5x1.25 inches on the 1.8.
I seem to recall that the 2.0 is bigger.

There are also really four different exhaust systems: "early" -- '70-73 1.7 
*and* '74 1.8; "early emmissions" -- same with EGR; "two liter" -- '73-4 2.0; 
and "full emissions" or "evil" -- all '75-6 models. I've never seen the
"early emissions" set, as it's pretty rare. The "full emissions" setup
has a primary muffler and a final muffler, and (I think) either a cat
or a thermal reactor. I've seen both, not sure if both were factory. I
know that *one* had to have been. The other two, "early" and "two liter"
are pretty much the same, main difference being size of plumbing (consistent
with the heat exchangers, natch).

>Does anyone know how far apart the flanges are supposed to be? Does this

I have *no* idea. And as you can tell, there are any number of options that
would make this get funky. *PLUS* you have the various aftermarket stuff
that could just be plain wrong to begin with...

>Anyone have a spare 2.0 liter muffler for a 914 that they would be will-

Anyone have a few diamonds laying around? Maybe some platinum? You could
also give that to Brett to help him *pay for* a 2.0 muffler (best price I've
seen recently on a factory muffler is about $500). I've got a spare Monza,
but I need it for state inspections (can't run supertrapps all the time...).
I'd recommend a Bursch aftermarket muffler setup. Should be under $200 from
most of the Porsche aftermarket guys.

When I got tree sap on my car a few years ago, I found that rubbing alcohol
did a fine job of diluting and moving it off the car.  The sap did not stain
my (dark coloured) paint; it was just there in globs.  I would assume the

I have a Euro '79 928 that fires up and runs for about 4 seconds

real running. Turning the key of and letting it sit for a few minutes
has usually allowed it to start but now it is pretty much the
same all the time. We have recently gone from less than 30 degree
nights to more than 45 degree nights. If the car does start, it
takes some light revving to hit on all 8. Once the car has been started 
and warmed it is ok throughout the day, even after sitting for
8 or 9 hours.

My guess is some combination of cold start valve and ignition problems.
Which framus is which under there? - The sort of pie shaped one is the
warm start and the thinner one is the cold start?

I saw a Bosch injection manual in the "Performance" catalog for $15.00 -

gives good historical and/or engineering review of the 928,
then please steer me to it.  Having done that you can tell
me to go RTFM and I won't be the least bit insulted.

From what I can tell the S4 was introduced in 1987, corresponding
to the knee in the market value curve for used 928s.  Is the
increased value due solely to the S4, or are there other market
forces at play that make pre-87 928s that much less expensive?

I've been warned about inordinate synchro wear in early 928s.
Was this really a design problem, or simply due to the increased
wear experienced by older cars?  Are there any persistent
mechanical design problems that lead to accelerated wear or
failures?  I know some things like timing belts, engine electricals
and even water pumps require replacements as a matter of
preventative maintenance.

Was the A/C designed with sufficient capacity to do the job?  In
US models was the A/C retrofit in the States, or was it factory-
installed?

What is your experience insuring the car?  Any inordinate liability
fees due to it's performance category?  And inordinate
collision/theft fees?

How easy, or difficult, is routine maintenance on this car?  Will I
have any problem changing fluids, replacing brake pads or rotors,
performing a standard engine tune-up, adjusting the clutch, etc?
These are all things I've done on my Volvo sedan, so I'm familiar
with what's involved.

Did Porsche incorporate an anti-theft system in '88 and earlier
cars?

How well does the 928 fare in autocross? :^).

Thanks to one and all for your responses.  And remember: if you

Subject: Balance shaft/belt problem on 944/951

I've been feeling a vibration recently on my 951. It seemed to have its
first resonance at about 1600 RPM. Over the weekend I discovered the source
 - the balance shaft belt had broken. Pieces of it were everywhere. Luckily
the camshaft belt was unaffected!!! (From the looks of it, the odds against
the camshaft belt being unaffected are about nil...)

One of the balance shafts is very difficult to turn and has almost frozen
up. My working hypothesis is that letting the car sit for ~7 weeks this
winter caused the balance shaft to stick even more and sheer the belt when
I started it. The nubs on the belt have been sheered off for at least 6
inches.

Anyway, the question for this group is why might the balance shaft have
frozen? Anyone seen/heard of this? I pulled the seal at the front of the
affected balance shaft and that was not the cause. The parts guy at the
dealer has never sold a set of balance shaft bearings in his life, so it
can't be common (or can it?).

Other facts: 1986 951 with 43k miles. All belts were replaced 13k miles ago
and retensioned 3k later. The car has run Mobil 1 for the last 13k miles. I
have owned the car for 13k miles (notice a pattern here???).

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Re: 944 Brakes

Blaine,

I agree with Kevin that you can change the master cylinder without bleading
the clutch.  I didn't need to when I replaced the master cylinder on my '83
944.  I carefully removed the clutch supply hose, capped it, and let gravity
bleed air out of the reservoir when I reattached it.

My cylinder started to leak around the seal to the vacuum booster.  My first
thought was to do a rebuild.  Two manufacturers of master cylinders were
used, Girling and ATE.  Mine was a Girling which rebuild kits were not
available.  Kits were only available for ATE.  I decided to puraches a new ATE
unit from Automation for about $150.  Other people that I talked to suggested
against rebuilding due to contamination risks.  The new replacement was not
too difficult.

Speaking of the rear brakes, I was also warned that the rear calipers tended
to be difficult to bleed completely because there was a tendency for air to
get trapped in a remote corner of the caliper.  I used a hand operated vacuum
pump and lightly tapped on the caliper with a hammer to dislodge any trapped air
with the bleed nipple as high as practical.  This worked for me.

 914 Fuel leak
Fellow PorschePhiles--
    As I put my '74 914 in gear this morning to take the both of us to work, I
noticed a _pool_ of liquid which had been under the car.  I jumped out and
looked, and saw gasoline dripping down from under the gas tank (roughly) at
quite a rapid rate!  PANIC!  So, I killed the engine, pushed it back into the
parking space just vacated, and biked to work.  (Whew!)
    I have had two prior leaks from this location, neither of which were in any
way this big, and both of which stopped on their own.  I thought my new
mechanic had found and fixed this, but he told me that he couldn't _make_ it
fail....  It is an intermittent problem, which only seems to occur when the
engine is running (or possibly just the fuel pump?).  Even though this is a
'74, the pump is in front--the previous owner moved it there.  I have had
problems with his "work" in the past, so maybe he screwed this one up, too.
    Anyone have any insights?  I won't be able to get under it until Wednesday
at the earliest, but any suggestions before then would be more than welcome.

Dave,
     This happened to me several years ago. It was fun trying to find several
gas containers inorder to empty the full tank before it flowed all over my
garage floor!
     In my case, the problem turned out to be that the fuel line slipped off
underneath the tank. It's held in place by a clamp which sometimes wiggles
loose. I had to unbolt a metal panel from underneath to get to the bottom
of the gas tank.
     Other possibilities are a leaking or broken fuel line or a leaky gas
tank. Good luck...

Hello,
The sun is shining, everything is wonderful, right?  We own Porsches.
We are happy people.

Car gets grumpy.......owner gets unhappy.

Does _anybody_ out there have any simple instructions pertaining to
the parking brake on a '72 914 ?  I have read Haynes, talked to
several people that I will let near my car, and when I answer "yes"
to the question about whether my car has the 'funny kind of parking 
brake', they change the subject in a hurry.

The emergency brake part of the mechanism is working.  But isn't there
some way to park on a hill without a wheel chock?  Can I safely
assume the cable is connected properly since the car can be stopped with
the hand brake?  Is this a leave it alone kind of problem?  Since
the car is running (engine-wise) I don't want to get involved in a
major project requiring a lot of down time.

And while I'm here, does anybody know of a way to keep the windshield
washer nozzle pointed at the windshield and not move around?  I don't
want to glue it in place or anything crazy, but one of them refuses
to stay in place.  My car has the pneumatic windshield washer system
operated from pressure in the spare tire.  The cut-off valve doesn't
seem to stopping at the recommended 29 lbf/sq in.  Any way to test
this valve?  (oh please be easier than checking fuel pressure in the 
injector supply line :) )  It isn't listed in Haynes as one of the items 
requiring engine removal, which is a good sign.

Happy trails,

I have a question on oil changes with synthetic oil (Mobil 1).  I have
a '77 911S modified with 2.7RS pistons/cyls, 901 4 bearing cams, 
Webers, Time Serted & Line Bored case, port&polished heads, etc.  
Being up North, the car gets stored for about 5 months during the Winter.
I only drive the car 500 to 1000 miles per year (7 months).  Normally I 
change the oil before the car goes into storage, and then change it again 
when I take it out of storage.  The reason for changing it when I take it 
out (and this is my question) is that I was once told that the oil should 
be changed every 6 months, even if it has zero miles on it, because it 
absorbs water (hydroscopic).  Is this true for synthetics, or are they like
silicon brake fluid (non-hydrscopic)?  If the answer is that I should
continue to change the oil when I take the car out of storage, how
about the filter?  The oil change is not a big expense (~$60) but I don't
want to throw money away either.

Sounds like your rear calipers need an adjustment!

The 914 e-brake is quirky but it *will* hold the car on a hill
as long as it's not completely rusted out and it's adjusted
properly. As you know, the rear pads double in function as the
emergency brake, unlike the 911 where there is a separate set
of drum-like pads to do this. 

The rear pads have to be adjusted to within a certain distance of the
disk when no pressure is applied, the Haynes manual should have this
number. I ususally just adjust the pads until they begin to drag on
the disk and then back off about 1/4 turn on the adjusters. The 
adjusters are metric allen sockets and are located on the caliper
at right angle to the pad surface. The inboard one is accessed
*through* a long port in the rear trailing arm. Unfortunately
they tend to strip out and then you have to take the whole caliper
out of the car to fix it. 

But if yours aren't stripped then they should be adjusted and you
should be able to park anywhere!

The cars have a low price WRT to their original price for several
reasons. One, they are really 'boulevard' cars in the States 
meaning that they are usually not bought by hard core sports car types
and don't have a 'got have one at least once in your life' following.
Two, the mileage is low and requires the most expensive fuel so
people who can afford a used one, generally will lean towards
a more economical car.
Three, even though the car costs $10-15k the parts still cost
for a car that is now ~$80k new.
Four, because of one, two, three above, the hard core used sports car
buyers stay away from them which makes the resale value even softer.
The one thing harder than finding a really excellent used 928 is selling
one. 5speed w/Sunroof and leather are best. An original '78 with the
'PopArt' cloth seats is probably the only 'collectable' 928. The first
4 valve (82?) would be next on the list but either way they are not
much in demand. The only truly valuable 928 would be Holbert's Bonneville
car, wherever that is. Buy the best one you can find and enjoy it. It
is definitely not an investment car.
(Side discussion -  For price vs investment possibility I would pick a
914-6 in good original condition. Less than 10k would get one, maybe -
will be over 20k in 3-5 years. For price vs investment vs usability, there
are several 911's that are outstanding values )

Most 928's with >50k miles on them (and a 5 speed) seem to have 
worn 1st and 2nd synchros. I believe that the long linkage insulates
the shifter from the 'feel' of the gearbox and makes it easier to 
overload the synchros on a down shift. Additionally, the synchros have
the inertia of the drive shaft to combat, which makes them have to 
work harder. In a conventional gearbox, when the clutch is pressed in,
the rotating mass for the synchro to work against is minimal.

The engine compartment looks forbidding but I fell in love with the

failure after 10 years) and in all cases the job was straight
forward compared to most other cars. It is sometimes involved but
not inanely complex. Routine stuff is pretty easy.  
The 928 is a well engineered machine as opposed to a well designed

It is important to note that on the inner side, there is an allen head
cap which protects (and locks the position?) of the adjuster, which
also has an allen head. It is this cap which sometimes strips.
A stripped cap can sometimes be removed using a punch against its
edge, inserted between the caliper and the trailing arm, without
removing the caliper. If you remove a stripped cap, don't be tempted
to leave it off. The adjuster just slides in, and will slide out
and get lost without a cap. There are aftermarket stainless steel
caps available. In fact, I seem to recollect that there is a
standard DIN allen head cap which works, but my memory has faded.

There is a similar locking cap on the outside, but it is a plastic
piece with a standard outside hex.

While on the subject, you should also be aware that these adjusters
need to be backed off to allow the application of new pads, and then
readjusted with the new pads. Once adjusted properly, they are
supposed to be self adjusting for pad wear, and that feature always
worked on my car, where I went through lots of brake pads at track
events.

You can often work around this by:

      Stopping

      Putting the car in second (or just pulling the shift half

Sure. Best one I *EVER* heard was to bump third gear on your way into

third, just sort of bump it into the detent.

For a real fix, you get to rebuild the transmission...

I had this problem and DID have my 915 rebuilt.  They replaced all the 
synchros.  The problem is better, but is still will not go into first
all the time.  I always "bump second" now just in case.  I read somewhere
that this was a problem with the Porsche designed synchros.  That may
be one of the reasons Porsche went to the Borg-Warner style synchros
in the '87 911 transmissions (G50?).

On 4 valves:
The first 4-valve 928 was for the '85 model year, but for U.S. cars only.
In '87 the S4 came out, so that everyone had a 4-valve engine.
The '85-'86 car put out around 280 HP, whereas the '84 was in the 230
range. I forget what the '87 S4 put out, but my guess is something like 320.

On A/C:
On '86 and later cars, there was an option for a second A/C port between
the rear seats (there's an armrest/package compartment otherwise).

On Transmissions:
Something like 85% of US 928's had automatic transmissions, so the 5speeds
are rare. The throw on a 5speed is pretty long, especially from 1-2.

>From a friend:

I have a 82 924. Recently, I have been having a problem which
is baffling. The ignition spontaneously cuts out for no apparant
reason. When it cuts out, it does so briefly, but its enough to
cause me to pull off the road and spend a few minuits restarting
the car.

Once the car has been restarted, it seems to work fine for the
rest of the day, but it has become more frequent.  It is to the
point where the car is not drivable.

Symtoms:

   -Tach drops to zero even though engine is still turning.

   -Seems to occur when engine is not cold but not at normal
     op temp.

   -When engine quits it will restart eventually, but it isn't
    faulty long enought to trouble shoot.

   -I checked ground strap and coil connection, which seem okay.

Anybody have any clues?? Much appreciated!!

this varies through the time in question ('78 to present). when they

were 85% 5 speeds, since porsche thought it was a sports car. their 
customers thought it was a boulevard cruiser (in the 450SL mold) and 
demanded an auto, so the
mix started changing, by about '86, it was 85% automatics.

the bottom line is that its quite hard to find a newer 928 with a 5

ones had mostly 5 speeds.

Subject: fuel tank hoses

The 914 hose sizes discussion has reminded me of a matter I need to
attend to on my '69 912...

Ever since I've owned the car (3.5 years) I get a strong fuel-in-the
passenger-area smell for the first 1/4 mile after filling the gas tank
(I don't top it).  Under-the-hood investigation shows nothing definitive
(ie. no *broken* or openly-cracked or even loose hoses), but I did find
some clear plastic hoses that I'm wondering about.

Hose #1 is about 1" dia., runs from top of gas tank up to a small box.
This box is a little bigger than a cigarette box, and is attached to the
cowling near the left hood hinge (forward of the instruments).  Hose #2
is about 3/8" dia. and runs from this same box down to the lowest part of
the spare tire well and ends there, without going through any hole to the
outside.

Questions:

1. what is the little box used for?  Could it be the source of the gas
fumes?

2. should hose #2 terminate where it is, or should it vent to the outside?

Could someone with a factory parts/repair manual kindly look this up and
let me know what the story is?  Thanks...

924 ignition  switches are a good place to start looking. Consider hooking
a temporary light to the switch to determine where the fault lies. Also
look at the fuse panel for the fuel pump relay fuse, although that doesn't
really explain loss of power to the tach. Hmmmm... cooould take a while to
isolate. The whole fuse panel is a good place to look for troubles. It's
just as bad as the VW Rabbit. Happy hunting.

Mentioning the fuel pump relay stirs memories... the fuse boxes in both the
Rabbit and the 924 I used to own developed fractures in the 12VDC bus bars
providing power to the fuses and relays.  In the 80 Rabbit I sold last week,
it was just the fuel pump relay that intermittently lost power at first... we
found that and soldered a jumper around the fracture.  A while later, it broke
farther up the bar and more stuff would intermittently lose power.  Gave up at
that point and popped the bucks for a new fuse box... problem went away for
good.

I was having similar problems with the 924 when it got totalled, so I'm afraid
I never got around to resolving the difficulty... but you might want to poke
around the fuse box with a voltmeter even if none of the fuses appear blown to
see if there is a loose connection or broken bus bar...

I had precisely the same experience with my '84 944.  I too ended up
buying the ATE replacement, since it was the only one available at a
reasonable cost.  However, one nice feature of the Girling cylinder I
replaced (that the ATE cylinder did not have) was a "leak bore"
drilled into the casting to provide an escape route for any fluid that
got past a failed rear seal.  Thus, instead of the fluid filling
the booster, it leaked down the outside of the booster (taking paint
with it of course) and onto the garage floor where I could see it
before too much fluid had been lost.

Subject: Fixing der 914 II


	Howdy all,

	Last night was the first chance I had to continue debugging the
Bosch fuel injection on my 914 1.8L.  I FINALLY got a chance to try
out all the suggestions I got back from the net and continue working on 
testing the fuel delivery system.

	First off I took out the cold start valve, put it in a
container and applied 12 Volts to the connector.  It worked (or at least
it squirted fuel).  Good, another working part.

	Next I took off the Aux Air Regulator.  Stan has sugested that
it may be causing some problems.  It's resistance measured out
perfectly (30 Ohms), and as you applied 12 Volts to the connectors it
would close (slowly) over a period of minutes.  None of the manuals
gave a spec on how long it should stay open, so I assumed that that
was okay.  WOW! Yet another working part!

	I didn't bother checking the Thermo switch since it is summer
here is DC and will not be under 50 until November :-(.  It doesn't
matter if it works when cold, and I know that it doesn't do anything
at room temp.

	I just got a Bosch Fuel Pressure testing set from Automotion
(thanks Stan) so I could check the pressures in the system.  I started
to check the fuel pressure on the tap on the fuel rail on the drivers side 
first.  After I disconnected the vacuum line to regulator (the one on the
drivers side, right?) and connected the Air Flow Meter, and turned the
ignition to the On position the fuel pressure SLOWLY went up to 34 PSI.
(and open the flap in the Air Flow Meter...)
Okay, that is within spec for the car.  The only wierd thing is that
the manuals say that the fuel pump should only be on for 1 -3 seconds,
and mine is ALWAYS on whenever the kay is in the On position.  But, that
relates to the next test.  I next tested the fuel flow at the same tap.  
Each manual had a different location to test the fuel flow, so I figured 
that it wasn't critical WHERE I check the flow.  The manual said that in
a minute between 1 and 1.5 liters of fuel should be deliverd.  My car
only deliverd 1/4 of a liter in that time period :-(.  My diagnosis is 
that either I tested the flow in the wrong spot, or that there is something
wrong with the fuel pump/ fuel filter/fuel hoses.  What do ya'll think?

	This would explain why the car is really hard to start (hold 
down gas pedal for a couple of minutes and then start car), and doesn't
idle (just dies when your foot isn't on gas pedal), and doesn't respond
to throttle changs very quickly (feels like turbo lag :-))

	Any comments and suggestions?  

	Alex (who is going to get this car to work if it kills him)

_____________________________________________________________


My 71T 1st gear synchros are shot and so I either bump or grab second on
the way to first while at a stop.  If you're in traffic and don't 
need to come to a complete stop you can get first if the car is rolling 
slowly.  When I was 18 I had a 66MGB with bad 1st gear synchros so I 
developed the bump practice early and find myself doing it even on newer
cars that don't need it.  It's a hard habit to break.

I seem to recall a thread about a year ago where someone was suggesting
that 901 and 915 owners should grab first as the car is almost stopped
and then sit with the clutch in and 1st gear engaged.  I did not follow
the outcome of this discussion.  Does anyone remember the outcome if there
was one?  There was a lot of discussion about whether or not throw-out 
bearings would be damaged.

These are the classic symptoms of a failing fuel-pump relay in
the early 944s.  My guess is that it is the same for a late 924.
As I recall the relay is about a $35-40 item.

The relay becomes pitted and/or corroded. Through the normal
expansion/contraction effects of heat on metal the contact is
broken.  If you turn the ignition key off and than try to restart,
the relay is reactivated, makes contact, and away you go....until
next time.   And then, inevitably, will come the day that no
amount of trying will get the little sucker to make contact.

Since I get the digest version of the list now, this has already been answered
a number of times.  I learned how to drive in a 68 VW.  You had to shift into
2nd and then 1st (or reverse) or it would grind.  1st and reverse didn't have
syncros.  I have been using the same practice ever since, even on these new
fangled cars :-) with syncros on all of the gears like my 81 911.  My 911
will shift into 1st much easier if 2nd is only bumped (with clutch in move
the gear shift an inch or two back against 2nd until a little bit of pressure
is felt).  This is both before and after new syncros were put in it.

Hmmmm. Well, the pump being on is controlled by the fuel pump relay, the
"double relay" under the passenger seat, and misc parts of the seatbelt
interlock system. Odds are that at some point, someone disabled the
seatbelt interlock stuff and bypassed the signal from the double relay
to be "on" if the power is on, which will close the relay and start the
pump. Don't worry about it. The pump is on all the time on most EFI
cars.

The lack of flow is a *BIG* problem. And it usually does matter where  
you tap the line. Use the *RETURN* line off of the pressure regulator.
That's the one that goes back under the engine, towards the front of
the car. Disconnect that, hook up a short piece of hose to the regulator
and run it into a container. I can't find anything on the flow rate 
except that the pump is supposed to have a *MINIMUM* of 50 liters/hr.

Don't forget, it could be a kinked line, or a dead fuel filter, or 
stuff in the bottom of the gas tank obstructing flow or a clogged
filter screen in the tank. So have a second look. If you still don't
get flow, try using compressed air to blow back up the line from
the pump to the tank, then trying again.

Yup. Nothing like no fuel to make your whole day... If you have to 
replace the pump, consider getting a '75 and up pump, and mounting
it up front. You'll like it a lot better, less chance of vapor lock, 
etc.

Some of this is good, while in other areas the folks at Porsche

The water pump mentioned earlier is a joke.  You have to strip the

is that no one ever gave servicability any thought.

Make that all electricals.  Their electrical reliability is pretty bad
(compared to my Toyotas).

 - -->Did Porsche incorporate an anti-theft system in '88 and earlier

Yes, but again it's limited to the electrical reliability.  They have
an alarm system that's controlled by an extra tumbler in the locks,
and that cars can be locked using either the short (unalarming) or
long (alarming) key.  If alarmed, can only be unlocked with the long
key.  Unfortunately the last tumblers have a small voltage across
them.  What do you get when you have voltage, moisture and time on
metal?  Corrosion.  Most older cars' alarms don't work and it's $600
to have the car re-keyed with working locks.

Not what I've seen.  In my experience about 60% are sticks.  The autos
have reputations for being much slower than sticks.

I said some things that sound pretty negative about the cars, but
don't get me wrong; I love the cars (they're my favorite wheels!).
Just keep in mind that if you want to drive one and keep it in
flawless condition, then it's a labor of love.  Although I don't care
for the idiosyncracies of the car, the strengths of the car more than
make up for them!

Hi,

I'd check the fuel filter.  You can even cut it open to see what is
inside.  If it is rusty, sand like stuff you might need a new fuel
tank.  A lot of crud in the tank can't be fixed by just replacing
the filter, and if it is bad enough you could have damaged the
fuel pump.

Lets just say that the 1978-1984 (Non BW type syncro trans) has a
tendency to be weak relative to the 1985->current manual trans.  I
have a 1980 5-spd and initially had problems but once it was fixxed I
have been very happy (~12K miles, ~5 drivers schools and a 1/2 dozen
Autoxes), you just have to get a feel for the shifts.  You can't just
SLAME away like on a Mustang-GT (which btw is a BW style trans).  True
Porsche manual transmissions in general have rather weak trans
characteristics in the pre 1985 time frame.

Important point to consider is that 
        1.) the 5spd is faster PERIOD.
        2.) If your considering a 6+ year old 928 Auto, the
        trans is probably getting mushy or due for a rebuild.


>Was the A/C designed with sufficient capacity to do the job?

My A/C has worked flawlessly for 3+ years.

>What is your experience insuring the car?  Any inordinate liability

Here in MI, relatively decent driving record with a $500.00 deduct
on my 1980 928 is 230/6-months (AAA).

>How easy, or difficult, is routine maintenance on this car? 

Maintenance cycle was designed for 15K mile intervals on the 928.
Although I don't follow that recommendation (I change my Mobil 1 oil and 
gas, oil and air filters with 3K frequency) it my justify some of
the precieved higher cost for maintenance relative to a 944 or 
an air cooled P-car.

>Will I have any problem changing fluids,

EZiest oil change I've ever done.

Not as simple as on the Vette but very doable and simple, I can't
speak for the changing S4 brakes (I'd love to have those).

>adjusting the clutch, etc?

Clutch replacement is a bit more involved than your standard
front engine/front transmission configuration.


>How well does the 928 fare in autocross? :^).

Here in the Detroit area a kid drives a 91 MR2 Turbo and I've
never lost yet.  I am not saying it's the B-stock ticket but
for it's weight it seems to be very respectable.  All national
stats would disagree (he MR2 is the car to have in BS)), but
this is my own personal experience.  (Paxing my results are
also encouraging).

Subject: Re: 911 chain tensioner.

>1_ What are these chain tensioners?

They are semi-hydraulic gizmos that keep the cam chains near a
certain tension, to compensate for expansion from heat in operation.
There are three types: solid, which are for use in racing motors *ONLY*,
both because there isn't a wide heat range (it's full-hot, always)
and because you need to check them every 20-30 hours of operation; 
"Old Style", which are the semi-hydraulic (pre-Carrera) tensioners
which *WILL* fail eventually; Carrera, which rarely fail as they're
pressure fed and hence have a tough time unexpectedly collapsing.

>2_ How do I check them? Where are they located in the
>   engine compartment?

You can't check them. You can hear chain noise if it's nearly
too late, but not before. They're under the cam tower covers
at the rear ends (ie. closest to rear of car) of each cylinder bank.

>3_ Should I just go ahead and replace them after a certain
>   mileage as a preventive maintenance?

YES. Depending on what year your car is, and whether or not they've 
already been replaced, odds are that you should just do it. Now.

>4_ Can a shade tree mechanic performs 3 above?
>
>5_ Can a shade tree mechanic performs the upgrade to the

Given that the shade tree mechanic in question didn't know what
nor where they were, I'd be disinclined to recommend that you 
try it.

And you need some special tools, to hold the tensioner compressed until
you get it installed, and to hold tension on the chain. 

You will probably also need to replace the plastic chain ramps at the
same time. That's NOT a fun job with the engine in the car (particularly
if yours are cooked and break into little pieces when you pry them
out -- little pieces that then drop into the case. Bleah.)

A set of Carrera tensioners should be about $349 from AJR or Imparts.
A set of ramps should be about $90. Installation should be about
$300 at a competent facility.

The 911 SC has about 69K miles on it, and had been converted to US

Brendin:

I'm sending this to the whole list, as other people may be wondering what
sportized means.  Besides, I want to show off my art-work (below) :-] .
The muffler was "sportized" by Stoddard Porsche.  Here's what they do: 
They start with a stock, genuine Porsche muffler.  They then cut off the
tailpipe and weld a plate over the hole.  Two new holes are cut rear
center-right ant center-left, and two new straight pipes are welded on, as in
a VW bug.  Pipes approx. 2-2.5" diam, with chrome covers.

Top views of the two mufflers:

Regarding how loud it is, it's maybe a little louder than a new 4->1 glass
pack, and possibly about the same once the glass has blown out of the
pack, as it will.

Subject: 911 Tyres and wheels



Hi there! First mail to this list so here goes...
 
I just put a set of Fuchs 7x16 and 8x16 on my 1988 911 Carrera.
I got the wheels second hand, and had them re-anodised. There
is a shortage of 7x16 and 8x16 sets of Fuchs in the UK, so expect
to pay a premium if you want these. I put 205/55 and 225/50
Yokohamas (AV30008P - can't remember exactly) on the new wheels. 
There were no clearance problems on the wheel arches.
 
The handling of the vehicle on the new wheels and tyres is hugely
improved. Traction, balance during power transition, grip on 
bends, braking, steering response and precision etc are all stunningly
good.    
 
The downside (apart from the hole in the bank balance) is that
the 911 is now a little more sensitive to strong side winds at high 
speed. Tyre noise is increased on some surfaces, and the steering is
quite heavy at parking speeds. I don't find any of these a problem 
myself.  
 
Questions... 
 
Does anyone know if it is possible to fit wider, lower profile
Yokohamas on rear 8x16 wheels on the standard 3.2 Carrera body?    
 
What would you people recommend for the next performance mod.,
suspension or engine management system? 
 
Does the 1988 UK 911 have a catalytic converter? If it does, is there 
a non-cat Porsche supplied exhaust available, as with the
Carrera 2/4?

Except for milage. I bought mine 5-6 years ago with 80K+ miles on it,
and have it up to about 130K or so now. Has everything this one has except
the factory alarm. And I had to do the import paperwork, having

You'll want to bear a few things in mind: first, make sure you have a 
copy of the EPA and DOT paperwork, then check with those agencies to
make sure they're still happy with the car. A few years ago, there were
many fly-by-night places doing conversions by faking paperwork, and if
your car was done by one of them, *YOU* get to pay to have it done right
or have the car exported or crushed.

Second thing: the car is almost identical to US spec 911SCs. You won't have
any trouble except with three things: first, which you should never have
to worry about, is pistons which are different for higher compression;
second, is the distributor, which has a different advance curve if it's
the stock Euro distributor; last, the fuel injection, particularly the
fuel distributor and control pressure regulator. Euro FI parts are *NOT*
available in the US.

>I am planning to send the car to a mechanic to perform a "leak down"
>test as a indicator to find the "health" of this car.

I'd also have him fish out the part numbers on your distributor and FI
system pieces, and check them via the Bosch cross-index to see what they're
originally used for. If it's Euro-spec stuff, you may have to figure out
what piece you can rob from some other car that has the same performance
characteristics as the dead part you have at some point in time, or
just ante up for a whole US spec FI system (which you can find used from
people who put on carbs, pretty cheap).

And make sure you have a *GOOD* mechanic. You can't set these guys up 
"by the book" if you're using a US spec book. You have to use the
Euro specs, or you have to know enough about race prep to know how to
figure out the right specs the hard way.

See if Cool Carbon or Performance Friction carbon fiber pads are 
available.  For my 951, they're cheaper than OEM pads and have a MUCH 
higher coefficient of friction.  They last longer than DS-11's (track 
use), but also get the wheels very dirty in only a few miles.  
Excellent retro-pads, though!  They suck my eyeballs out under braking!

> He wonders about metal braided hoses. (I suggested that this is a waste

I concur.  I've got metal braided lines, but they really didn't do 
much, and in fact can fail suddenly if installed incorrectly.  "Rubber 
be good for street."

> He says that higher boiling point brake fluid is important. (I think this is

Higher boiling point is moot unless he's boiling.  Wet brake fluid 
boils at a lower temp than dry, so keep clean fluid in there.  A good 
DOT4 should suffice (Castrol LMA).

> Drilled rotors?
Don't do this with the original rotors!  Your friend must buy properly 
ENGINEERED material that's drilled by design, not afterthought.  
Drilling creates a stress concentration point can lead to rotor 
cracking upon high pedal pressure.  We do not allow aftermarket drilled 
rotors at tracks in the Northeast Region due to this.

> What about air ducts? Are there kits for Integra?
Air ducts are good if your friend has a cooling problem in the front.  
Dunno if they're availabel for Acura.

To answer your question, 245/50R16 is the largest you can go.

More generally, to answer the question of "What is the *largest*
wheel/tire combo I can put on a stock bodied SC/Carrera (in
Fuch alloys that is)". Front you can put 944 turbo offset 8x16
with 225/50R16 and in the rear you can put 930 turbo 9x16 with

I know that there are quite a few UK people on the porschephile

I have taken my 911 over three times in the past year. Best trip was

Porsche/driving front, the Alps offers amazing driving, mountain

the UK) and are great for exciting driving. And of course Bavaria
offers Autobahn driving with no speed restriction. Not that great

Also - make sure you take vehicle documentation with you. The UK 
Customs people pay particular interest to Porsche going out the

Double clutching is definately the way to go when you need to get 1st
while decelerating--a must for slow corners.  The issue is how to get
1st while you're at a dead stop (sitting at a stop light for example
in neutral).  The bump technique works great for this.

BTW thanks to all the folks who wrote to me and pointed out that my 66MGB
did not have weak synchros--it had *no* synchros.  Apparently they didn't
synchronize 1st gear until 68 or so....

  A question for all 951 owners out there (or anyone else who knows

  that I should look for when deciding if I should put my good
  money down or not...

  I have a '83 944 now, so I'm familiar with the standard problem
  areas surrounding that car (water pump, timing belts, etc.)....
  so what I'm looking for is a list of similar (and especially unique)
  ailments that effect the turbo models... I've heard through the years
  that the early turbos (86-87) had troubles with exhaust manifolds,
  number 2 bearings and clutches... I know the exhaust manifold was
  corrected sometime during '87, but what about the other two?
  Are there any other glaring maintenance items I should be aware of?

  Any information you could send would be greatly appreciated...

Stan and others,

To see the 912 Targa belonging to Gregg Crandall winning the E Prod.
season opener at Sebring, take a look at page 52 of the March issue
of SportsCar.  Even though it was only a three car field and two finished,
the sight of a 912 in race trim was worth a photo! :-}

While Gregg's effort isn't really a high budget program the reason that
he is considering Sports 2000 has more to do with the entry of all the

Yeah, it's just about got us to decide to drop the 914 from EP as well.
I *KNOW* we can get 220+ HP from an MR-2 that will last more than one
season. Given that, and all other things being equal, even hot 914s look
like lap traffic. Which is really too bad...

I figure we'll hold out at least through the end of '94, but after that,

Yes, this screw changes the operating pressure.  You need to hook a gauge
up to the point on the metal fuel rail.  My manual says the pressure should
be between 28.4 and 29.6 lbs/sq.in.  This is apparently the same for both
the 1.7 and 2.0 D-jet systems.

 914 Fuel Leak
Hi, again!
    I finally got under my 914 with the fuel leak this weekend.  I checked the
fuel pump installation, and the quality and workmanship seems to be down to the
usual level of the previous owner's.  However--the leak is not coming from the
pump, or (it looks like) even from the lines above the pump which run to the
tank.  The filter seems OK (if hard to get to), and the lines _appear_ sound. 
The fuel comes out of a drain hose just behind the belly plate which covers the
pump.  I think this hose is to let water out of the body, but I'm not very sure
where it leads.
    My speculation is that the leak is somewhere in the attatchments to the
"hard" lines in the center tunnel, or possibly in the hard lines themselves. 
Do I have the right general idea?  Any advice?

Thanks!

Subject: 944 transaxle

I seeketh the wisdom of the almighty net.....

To save traffic on the net, please respond directly to me and I
will compile the responses and re-broadcast them.

I was at one of the Lone Star Region Porsche Club autocross events
yesterday when my trusty 944 decided it had enough. Coming out of
a turn and hard on the throttle, a strange noise came from under
the car. No, it wasn't a pylon. It sounded more like metal.....

  After bringing the car to a full stop and shifting to nuetral,
I tried letting the clutch out. Smooth engagement, no noise. I 
disengaged the clutch, shifted to first, and tried again. The
clutch felt the same, and the car started to move forward for about
a meter, and then the same (I'll use a technical term here) clunk-
clunk-clunk sound emerged from the transaxle. The car was pushed
back to the pits where the same experiment was performed w/reverse
to try and identify the cause of failure. Based on this information
we concluded that it was most likely the ring and pinion. 

  I drained the fluid last night after flatbed towtruck delivered 
it home . I confirmed that little chunks of metal were indeed 
present and that they looked like teeth from a gear ( whether from 
a ring, pinion, or drive gear is unknown ). The car is an `86 944 
and the transaxle is NOT a limited slip.

So, here are my questions:

1. Do you agree with the diagnosis? Is this a common failure?

2. If I go with a used transaxle, what year model 944 (or what P/N )
   will have the same gear ratios and will serve as a direct
   replacement? ( I have heard that starting in 85.5, the speedo 
   sensor was placed in the translaxle, correct? )

3. Should I consider having this one rebuilt? What are the costs?
   (I probably could rebuild it myself, but I am unsure of my
   ability to set the back lash for the ring and pinion correctly)

4. Should I go ahead and replace the clutch while the transaxle
   is out or is the drive tube removal the real time consuming
   portion of the process of replacing the clutch?

5. If I replace the clutch, I've already decided to replace it with
   the spring center type disc. What else needs to be replaced or
   modified or done ?
       a) new pressure plate
       b) new throwout bearing and guide tube
       c) machine the flywheel for new surface and clearance
          for new clutch disc type
       d) new flywheel and pressure plate bolts

6. Does anyone out there have any recommendations on where  to buy
   a used transaxle?

7. What are the prospects for finding a limited slip transaxle for
   a non-turbo 944 (I've heard I've got two chances, slimsky and 
   nonesky) ?

8. How much benefit does limited slip provide for autocrossing?
   I'd like to get a Quaiffe differential but $1400 is a little
   much.

9. Am I missing anything? Are there other things I should consider?

Answers to any and all questions will be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,

Sounds (unfortunately) like you're right. I hear it's common if
you dump your clutch "at the wrong time". Not being a water-cooled
guy, I can't confirm that.

Well, some years ago when I exploded the tranny in my Volvo 242GT
which was an autox/time-trials type beast, I asked my mechanic about
getting a used transmission. He sort of just *looked* at me, then 
after a few minutes said "Well, you could do that -- but you ALREADY
HAVE A USED TRANSMISSION". His point, though not completely appreciated,
was well taken.

>3. Should I consider having this one rebuilt? What are the costs?
>   (I probably could rebuild it myself, but I am unsure of my

I'd split it open first to see what the problem *REALLY* is and get
an estimate. Then I'd consider getting a used tranny to rebuild instead
of mine, hoping that I'd have at least all the hard parts good between
the two. 

My 911 is so hard to shift into 2nd that my crew chief (Elmer Fohey) 
jokes about needing to put both feet on the dash and pull with two
hands to do it. (I take a lot of ribbing about stuff like that, since
I'm both larger and stronger than average). It's not that bad, but it's
*REALLY* hard to shift. I *KNOW* that I have bad gear teeth on at least
two gears, and figure that at this point, there's no percentage in a
rebuild. I'll drive it til it drops then get a used or rebuilt transmission
from someone else, bolt it up and go.

>4. Should I go ahead and replace the clutch while the transaxle

I seem to recall that you pretty much have to take the back end of
the car apart to replace the clutch, so you'd be halfway there when
you drop the transmission. I say, look at it and see...

>6. Does anyone out there have any recommendations on where  to buy

AASE Brothers, PartsHeaven, and Oklahoma Foreign are the "national"
guys I've had good luck with. Closer to home, Grumpy's in San Antonio,
Austin Vee Dub in Austin, and Absolutely Foreign in Houston have never
let me down (if they've had what I need in stock).

>9. Am I missing anything? Are there other things I should consider?

Stan

P.S. Call Elmer about locating a used transmission. He seems to have
all kinds of magical contacts, and is in 944 mode with Lindauer's

There are three things here I can think of which would slow you down,
potentially:

 1. If the rim itself is heavier, it will suck more energy to spin it up
    to any given speed.  Energy which goes into spinning the wheel cannot
    go to accelerating the car.  The heavier component also detracts from
    the car's handling: unsprung vs. sprung weight.  Of course, you also
    have to scrub off that useless energy in braking.

 2. If the rim necessitates a tire with a larger circumference, that will
    have the effect of making your gears taller.  This is just the
    opposite of what some autocrossers do: put undersized tires on smaller-
    radius rims to shorten gearing.

 3. With the exception of a few specific sizes, you generally cannot get
    R-compound (sticky) tires in 17" sizes.  And forget about 18"
    altogether.  There are a few sizes available, specifically for
    Corvettes, and Toyo has a supply of sizes made originally for Carrera
    Cup use.  This should be less of a problem in the coming years as
    more and more 17" rims appear on new cars, but for now...
    
>Does it make that much of a difference, will I notice??

I sort of hate being an arrogant ass, but I could easily turn the question
around and say that if you have to ask the question, no, you won't notice
the difference!  Sorry, cheap shot.

>I currently have the stock cookie cutter rims..
>I want to go to a 17'' rim or even an 18" will the 18" fit??

It is not unlikely that you will have to alter one or more things to get
clearance in your wheelwells.  Porsche issued a tech bulletin describing
changes necessary to fit 17" OEM rims on late model 911's.  I forget the
details, but I believe some hardware had to be moved and something had to
be done with steering stops.

If you are buying non-Porsche wheels, be very careful.  The clearances
even for the OEM rims are tight.

>I have an 87 930

With cookie cutters?  Are you sure you have the right terminology?

Subject: Re: 944 transaxle

Tony -

First off, ignore everything Stan says.  The cars he drives have dog gears
which can be replaced independantly of their main gears, so his value
system is different than yours and mine.  Moreover, his advice to buy
a 911 can only mean that he is coming off a bad week-end with a 914.

>1. Do you agree with the diagnosis? Is this a common failure?

a. A clear case where the Weber manual's advice of "suck it and see" is
appropriate.  Like Stan says (wait, didn't I just say...), disassemble it
before giving out your Visa number.

b. No.  More often, people will trash dog gear teeth.  The only R&P
failures I knew to be common occurred a few years ago when some silly 951
owners started putting 944S R&P's in 951's to shorten the gearing.  It
worked: the R&P's got shorter, dramatically.  Bad idea.

The 944 type 016J transmission was used from 85-1/2 through 88.  It
apparently was changed for MY 89, but I cannot tell without digging
deeper what those changes were.

>3. Should I consider having this one rebuilt? What are the costs?
>   (I probably could rebuild it myself, but I am unsure of my

As opposed to buying a new one?  Absolutely, barring catastrophic failure
discovered during disassembly.  The only difficulty you may have is finding
someone who's done a 944 transmission before.  They just don't fail that
often, and a lot of very good Porsche mechanics simply have never done one.
Not that it's rocket science or particularly hard.  Guys who do 915's in
their sleep may have to crack open a 944 workshop manual.

>4. Should I go ahead and replace the clutch while the transaxle

Check it for wear, then decide.  Yes, it is a great time to do it, since
you're about half way home.  But getting the transmission out is only the
first thing you do in getting to the clutch.

OK, personal experience time.  I just did my clutch last Thursday, and
after a few years of pee-pee touching about someday upgrading to a macho
spring-centred clutch, I was finally faced with the opportunity to do just
that.  But in the calm light of reason, I put a new rubber-centred clutch
in.  Why, you ask?

 a) The old one, original, survived over six years of my driving it.  Lots
of autocrosses and track events, not to mention my learning curve.  Pretty
good deal, if you ask me.

 b) A rubber-centred clutch transmits less stress to the rest of the drive
train than a spring-centred one.  It's sacrificial, and that's a good thing
when you consider the price of the rest of the transaxle.

 c) Spring-centre clutches do indeed fail, and it can get pretty ugly
when they do.

With respect to your list, I would replace the pressure plate (because the
springs fatigue), the drive plate (aka friction plate, because it wears
and the rubber fatigues and hardens), and the t/o bearing.  I would check
everything else but not replace anything unless I saw a problem.  Check
the flywheel for run-out; replacement is not generally necessary.  Check 
the release fork's needle bearings for play.  No need to replace any bolts
unless you messed them up.

>7. What are the prospects for finding a limited slip transaxle for

You only need one, and I am sure that someone will be happy to sell you
one.  George Beuselinck, late of this d-list, has in fact started a
business of parting out 944's.  I'd call him first.

>8. How much benefit does limited slip provide for autocrossing?

And you haven't paid for the labor yet.  An LSD, and I would assume a
Quaiffe as well, can be a net negative at autocrossing.  They let you
put power down a little better.  But they inhibit use of trail braking
and throttle steering, which can be very useful and a lot of fun in
autocrossing.

>9. Am I missing anything? Are there other things I should consider?

Figure out why and how you hurt your transmission.  Fix that too.

We always take the tank to a radiator shop, have it "tanked", then check 
for leaks. Then use a Wurth products epoxy goop on the inside to seal
it, and Krylon the outside. There are other approaches, but something like
this needs to be done. Sorry, don't have the Wurth part number and stuff
in my head right now, but it's in the archives somewhere...

>Also, I'm going to be using carbs instead of the fuel injection. What do
>I need to do w/ the left over vent lines and return lines for the tank?

The return line is easy: your fuel pressure regulator should have a 
return, and since your pump wants to push out about 34 psi, and your
carbs are gonna want like 5-7 psi, you *REALLY* want to do something
what that extra pressure....

The vent is harder. I usually don't do carbs for anything but racing classes
where I'm required to use carbs. However, for those cases where I've had
a gun held to my head (or a case of Bass Ale brought by the shop) I fab up 
a fitting for the top of both of the air cleaners and just T those together, 
then run the vent return back into there. Works on 911s, too.

	In the UK, cars have to undergo an MoT (named after the Ministry of
Transport, which no longer exists!!) test which is basically a vehicle
roadworthiness test. My '85/2 944 has just failed and I have 14 days in
which to fix it.

	History : this car had a 12,000 mile service from a main Porsche
dealer (Lancasters in Colchester) 6 weeks / 1300 miles ago (for a mere 280
pounds!). At the same time I replaced the front brake pads (refusing to
pay the 150 pounds they wanted to do this!!).

	The failures were:

1. 	"Both rear disks [US = "rotors"] badly corroded (although the
brakes work fine on the rolling road)". I have had a look at these and it
is only the outside 1/2" of each disk which is corroded, and then only
slightly. I plan to clean this with fine wire wool and then brake cleaner.
Questions (1) is there any problem with doing this (given that the brakes
work OK at present)? (2) what could cause the rest of the disk to be nice
and shiny and the outer 1/2" to be rusty?

2. 	"Imbalance to the front brakes (50%)". Again, I'm looking for
clues. Bleed the brakes? Spray the calipers with brake cleaner? See if the
pads I recently fitted are binding on one side? Rebuild the calipers?

3. 	"Both headlamps aimed low". I guess I can deal with this, but I
would have expected a main dealer to have checked this as part of the
service!

	Thanks in advance for any help.

Philip

P.S. I may write to Lancasters and to Porsche Cars Great Britain about
this (I would have expected the corroded disks [The service manual says
"Brake system: visual inspection of brake pads and discs to check for
wear"] and low headlights ["All headlights: check settings and, if
necessary, correct"] to have at least been mentioned to me), but what can
I expect from a garage which charges for 6 litres of oil as 12 X 1/2 litre
bottles?!

P.P.S. On another tack, anyone know when Upixin' Der Porsche Volume IX
will be published (if ever!)

Kevin,
Yup I know that, I took physics in school. But relative to the overall weight

But the new 93 911 turbo w/ 18" looks great wonder who makes those tires?

Well maybe not a cheap shot but I have only owned the car a short time and
have only put a couple hundred miles on it.
My old 85 vette on the other hand I can tell you there was a difference but
a small one...

I was looking for someone else that might of already gone up in rim and tire

handling, and braking

I was wondering-

Perhaps this is the reason why the Cd of the 924 is still one of the lowest
around, or maybe it is just a thing with my '77.  How is the ventilation 
in your car?  Even with the fan on, and the vents open, my ventilation is
kind of lame.  I remember reading an old R&T that did a road test on the 924,
and they mentioned this problem too.  I have been toying with the idea
of putting a ram air scoop *someplace* to get more air into the cabin, but 
would not know where to put the damned thing.

   I was told that if I went to a heavier rim ie. the Ruf rims or the new
   turbo rims my car would be a little slower in acceleration and longer in
   stopping.

Oh, I just thought of one thing to consider with respect to braking.
The larger rim will require more braking torque for a given stopping
distance. This will translate into possible higher pedal force. At the
extreme with 18" rims and very wide, sticky tires you can run out of
caliper piston diameter and/or really throw off the brake bias. But
being a turbo with enough brakes to stop a semi I doubt you'll have
a problem.

PS: The rims you have now are probably stock 8,9x16 Fuchs alloys, not
	"cookie cutters".

A friend of mine with a stock '87 U.S. spec Carrera once did an 
experiment.  He lapped Lime Rock and got some representative lap times, 
then installed Autothority chips and retested.  He went about 1 second 
/ lap slower.

This was about 3 years ago, so hopefully the state-of-the-art has 
improved.  I've heard that generally, a slight improvement is felt with 
the aftermarket chips, but it's all from subjective, seat-of-the-pants 
statements.  Except for the above, nobody has compared chips 
back-to-back quantitatively.

If you have a turbo, then the difference would be substantial.

Subject: Engine sheet metal (911)


This is one of those "may be a dumb question" posts, to which, hopefully,
the "no such thing as a dumb question..." saying will apply:

	What purpose(s) does the sheet metal surrounding a 911 engine serve?
I am referring to the "tray" pieces attaching to the heads and rear of the 
motor, not the pieces that conduct air from the cooling fan.  I can guess
that they stop dirt and water from the rear tires from getting up into the
top of the engine compartment, and maybe on hot days at slow speeds they keep
hot air from the exhaust port area from getting up to the carbs and air intake,
but is that it?  Does anyone run their dry-weather only 911's without it?
My reason for asking is that engine accessibility would be a little bit
better without it (undoing the bolt holding the distributor in is difficult
from the top with the sheet metal there), and it would save 5 minutes of
disassembly time every time the motor comes out - which is becoming a semi-
regular thing for me.

Thanks

This is indeed not a dumb question. At least, the answer isn't dumb.

The sheet metal keeps the engine temperatures consistent. That's what the
thermostats are for - they open when the engine temp goes up, allowing
more cooling air flow through the metal housing, which in turn cools the
engine more, which closes down the thermostat...

The upshot of it is, the engine is designed to run with that sheet metal in
place. Take it off, and you may not notice any operational change (or you may
even get MORE POWER), but for certain the engine isn't running the way it
was designed to run...

I have found the main purpose is to catch sparkplugs and

serve as a catch-tray for upper valve cover leaks.

As has been noted, they're there for cooling purposes. THEY MUST BE THERE
or you'll melt your engine. Seriously. The SCORE/HDRA guys who do off-road
racing sometimes use 911 engines without all the cooling tin, but then
they rebuild (with new parts, BTW) after just about every race. Not something
I'd want to contemplate on *MY* budget...

Even on street engines, just the little "finger" pieces of metal that
go on the underside of the cylinders, and separate them somewhat, are
critical. I've seen engines come apart with out them, that overheated
to the point that the pistons started to flow...

Ditto on VW aircooled engines, too.

Hi Andrew,

My 931's pretty poor in the heating/ventilation department too.  Sheesh, any
system that relies on _outside_ air to push heat into the car in the winter is
not exactly what I'd call well designed.  I end up using the AC blower a lot to
supplement the fan.  Since my ac's broke (I've even removed the belt to the
compressor), this works year-round.  As far as a scoop goes, you do have one
neat alternative -- get a repro 924 Carrera hood scoop (usually about $75) and
stick it right in the center of the hood!  You could easily cobble up a little
under-hood ducting to direct the air straight back into the heater intake.

BTW, I wonder why Porsche never considered a swing-out arrangement for the rear
quarter windows, ala 320i or beetle.  Would have been a nice.

Stoddard's catalog lists both new and rebuilt Bosch 770W alternators
for 1969-1973 911s.  My couple-of-years-old price list says that the
rebuilt alternator was about $200 plus a core charge of $50, while the
new alternator was about $800!

oh, reading further down the page the catalog says,

  "Starting with the 1982 model year, Porsche used a Marchal
  alternator with built-in regulator.  This supercedes all earlier
  Marchal 980W alternators from 1975-1981.  To properly fit this
  alternator to '75-'81 cars, the mounting kit is required (The 1974
  [I think they must have meant 1966-1974]
  Marchal 770W now has a built-in regulator but does not require kit.
  Separate regulators are still available for earlier alternators.)

And for 1966-1974 ,911s an SEV/Marchal/Motorola alternator
*w/regulator* is listed.  This is probably the same regulator you've
been looking at for $400.

So, it appears that you've been told something that's half true. It
looks like there are alternators for some years that aren't available
as rebuilds, but your alternator doesn't fall in that range, and you
have the option of either getting a rebuild or using a newer
alternator with built-in regulator.

You can confirm all of this by calling Stoddard directly at 800-342-1414.


Hope this helps!

|    I was wondering if there are any readers out there who could send me
|    some general information on Porsche 911's and 928's, in the early to
|    mid 1980's?

the 928 is powered by a water-cooled, front-mounted, all-alloy V8, of linerless
cylinder construction. it has a single overhead camshaft for each bank 
of cylinders,
driving the valves through self-adjusting hydraulic lifters. the cams, 
water pump, and oil pump are driven from a toothed belt at the front of 
the engine. (later engines had DOHC and 4 valves per cylinder). they 
are all fuel-injected. in early cars (pre 85, i think) this engine put 
out about 240-270HP, with about 285lb-ft of torque.

the clutch is a two plate, dry clutch, driving a rear-mounted 
transmission/diff unit (transaxle). the car has nearly perfect 50/50 
weight distribution. the body is a steel unit-body, with aluminum used 
for the front fenders, doors, hatch and hood. the suspension is 
upper/lower A-arms with coil-over shocks in front, and a complex, but 
gorgeous, 5-link independant suspension in the rear (the Weissach(sp?) axle.)

|    I am mainly interested in information pertaining to the possible

|    them.  I have heard that they break down quite often. Is this true?

NO. they require proper maintainence, perhaps a bit more so than some other
vehicles, but when maintained properly, they are as realiable as my old Honda
Prelude.

an item to remember is that a new 928 costs about $80,000 these days, and parts
prices tend to be in line with that number, not with the 10-20K that 
you're likely to
pay for a used, early one.

|    Are they as reliable as a standard everyday vehicle?  I have heard
|    that 911's are more reliable them 928's. Is this so?  What are these
|    cars expected durability?  With moderate abuse over the engines life
|    time, what is an average point that requires a major over hall?

the 928 engine, especially in its early, lower-powered incarnations, is quite
long-lived. i've heard secondhand stories about the engine going 
250-350K miles before you need an overhaul. i would expect that the 
newer cars, where the HP is
closer to 400HP, might need overhauling a bit sooner.

  Is
|    there a certain mileage trend that major engine components give out?
|    I have heard that the 928's develop a 5th gear problem at low
|    mileage.

clutches and synchros on early 928 aren't the most robust in the industry. 5th
gear problems? first i've heard. the synchros in second usually aren't 
too long-lived;
you really can't slam the gearbox around like a ford and expect the 
synchros to live.
the only problem i have with 5th gear is that prolonged use tends to 
activate the
little 'police attractor circuit', hidden somewhere in the car :-).

|    Any information offered would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Balance shaft/belt problem on 944/951 (follow-up)

Synopsis: Lower balance shaft severely binding causing balance shaft belt
to break into many small pieces

I was finally able to remove the affected balance shaft over the weekend
and take a look at it. Removal was not as easy as I expected (what else is
new). The cover over the lower balance shaft is "wedged" underneath the
right-side motor mount on my '86 951. From the manual it looks as if the
cover was redesigned in 1987 to include an integral bearing cap. That would
have been nice, since the major problem was lifting the older style cover
over the bearing cap and its associated studs/nuts. To accomplish this I
needed to unbolt the right-side motor mount, raise the motor slightly, and
remove three bolts from flange that attaches the motor mount to the engine
(the fourth bolt can be loosened, but not removed, since it interferes with
the underside of the exhaust manifold). The balance shaft cover can then
just be removed if it is rotated in exactly the correct way and the motor
mount flange is lifted enough and the oil line to the cooler is stretched
enough and ...

There are two bearings on each balance shaft. One set of "normal" bearings
(two halves w/cap-type arrangement) at the back (between the swinging
weights) and another bearing pressed into the front carrier. That carrier
is bolted with three bolts to the front of the engine/balance shaft cover.
Also attached to that carrier are the turnbuckles used to adjust the power
steering belt and the alternator/air conditioning belt.

As for the bearings, they look in pretty good shape (to me), except for
some uneven signs of wear on the front one that seem to show the carrier
was cocked slightly and causing the shaft to bind. I'm wondering if the
torque from the two turnbuckles could be enough to twist the carrier and
cause this. If so, then this could be more than an isolated problem. Any
thoughts on this???

Don't do this!  The hood scoops are for engine cooling only.  Air

No, they aren't interchangeable, the difference is in the offset.
The standard 8x16 found on the rear of an SC/Carerra is 10.6mm.
The 951 wheel is 8x16 with the `turbo` offset of 23.3mm, which
offsets the rim inboard. They also look different, with the
'turbo' offset 8x16 having the appearance (from the outside)
of a 911 7x16.

Mark,
  I have found that some of these wheels will have the same width 
and offset and are interchangeable. The differences are in the 
depth of the 'spokes' relative to the rim edge. Some of them are
set deeper than others for brake caliper space requirements or for
the visual affect of matching rims front and rear with different rim
widths. You can tell the difference easily by looking at the lug nut
seat on the rim. A rim with shallow spokes will have a deep lug nut
hole/seat in the rim and deep set spokes will have a shallow lug nut 
hole/seat. I used to have part numbers on a lot of these rims, but 
have been unable to locate the file, sorry.

Hope this helps,
Tony Eggers

Most strange.  When you say "will not stay adjusted," do you mean that

They normally wear evenly to almost the edge of the disk.  You can feel

showing this corrosion?  If so, I'd first check that I had the right pads
in them.

What is meant by "imbalance?"  Do they mean you're locking the fronts and
delivering no braking to the rears?  That could explain (1.).  As I
mentioned in a recent message, you can test the front vs. rear braking
as follows:

To get
a measure of the relative braking force at a particular end, first set the
brake pedal at some fixed position, eg, by wedging a length of 2 x 4 between
the pedal and the seat.  Then, with the car jacked, use a swept-wand-type
(non-click) torque wrench on a lug nut, at right angles to the radius from
the axle axis to that lug.  Be careful not to exceed the torque spec for the
lug nut.

Not sure what would cause you to lose rear braking, but there are a lot
of things, from the tandem master cylinder on back.

This increase in 951 offset to 23.3 ends up as a benefit to 911 owners wishing
to run 8" -w- 245-45-16 rubber on the rear w/o lip mods.  It's also popular
up here to run the 951 8" on front of carerra flared 911s with 911 9" rears.

The 8" 951 wheels make nice front 911 wheels and work well -w- fans
(specify 7" offset for the fan though!).

As an aside: Running 930 suspension on the front of a 911 (or S-4 style
for that matter) can be accomplished by runing the 53.3 (951 87+, 928,
carrera4 offset) on the front.

As of 1990 all wheels were made to be 53.3 offset.

Hi all,

I am experiencing some bizarre temperature fluctuations
of the radiator coolant liquid on my 944 (86, 63000 miles). 

I checked the level of the coolant
liquid and saw it was below minimum. I added coolant up to 
maximum level. After 1 day, some of the green liquid spilled 
on the floor after I parked the car. The level was again 
below minimum. I filled it once more but this time 
up to mid-way between min. & max. There has been no more
spilling since and the level stays steady. However, 
there are weird temperature fluctuations:

Before the only way the temperature would go up
was when I was stuck in traffic. Now it goes up at 
high rpm (above 4000). (It does not reach red level
though). 

Also, before, the temperature never went down below a certain 
level. Now, at low rpm, it does that.

Any guesses on what's wrong given these symptoms?

Thanks in advance,

You have air in your system, possibly from a blown / blowing head 
gasket.  I've been through this scenario twice...!

On the engine compression stroke, air gets into the cooling system, 
which overpressurizes and blows the cap.  On intake stroke, it sucks 
antifreeze in and spits it out the exhaust.  So, it's possible to see 
your antifreeze level go down, whether there's a tell-tale puddle or not.

I'd also check your oil/exhaust to make sure you aren't leaking into

I am experiencing the same brake problems as Philip with my 1987 951. I ordered 
Mintex brakepads (made in the UK) from Performance Products (MDP 1456, 951/930 
models). The pads fit well but unfortunately I failed to compare new and old 
ones side by side. The result is 1" on top of the rotors that is not being used. 
It appears tat I have the wrong pads. My car has the M474 sport suspension 
option (Koni yellow adjustable shocks). Does anyone know whether that option may 
have included different brakes ? What pads should I use ? Thanks,

Bart

Subject: 911 Speedometer

The speedometer on my 1987 911 Carrera has been intermittently dying. It happens 
suddenly and lasts for a few minutes. It then again works. Today, however, it 
remained dead. I already pulled the unit to check for loose contacts. What to do 
next ? New unit (>$200)? Is there a way to test some other possibilities ? 
Appreciate any help.

Subject: Re: 944 coolant temp.

Andre -

As others have suggested, it sounds like you may need to bleed your system.
Pockets of trapped air will both mess up the flow of coolant, and will
give false readings to the thermostat and temp sender.  Even with a proper
bleeding after coolant change, it is not unusual for some air to remain
trapped and to gradually self-bleed over the next few days.  This is
largely due to the ever more complex passageways inside heads, esp. 16-
valve heads.  Charlie Learoyd suggested a while back that raising the front
end can help the bleeding process.

I have been reading posts in this group for a while so I thought I'd get
into the question asking.

I have a 1978 911SC and seems to be leaking oil.  I don't drive it on a regular
basis.

Could I get this group's expert opinions on the causes of the problem and 
possible remedies.  Or maybe where I should be looking for the possible causes.

Thanks.

These kind of symptoms happened on my 1987 911 Targa about a year ago.
As well as the speedometer not working the odometer was not working.  It
was real intermittent and had symptoms of a loose contact.  One day
it would work fine, the next it might be OK for a few miles after I started.
Then it would cut out and then later in the trip might start working again.
Some days it wouldn't work at all.

I got it fixed pretty soon after being followed real closely by a cop
with no clue of how fast I was going :-)

It turned out to be the sensor.  I had it replaced and everything has
worked fine since.  Cost <$100 including labor.

The engine being air/oil cooled the leak could be coming from just
about anywhere. But a good suspect is the original valve covers
on these engines. Mine was warped and leaking. I replaced it with
the Turbo covers which are thicker and reinforced and it did
the trick. They sell for about $100 with the gasket kit.

    I had the same problem in my 914 and I ran a new wire in the center
tunnel of the car.  That is where the Oil temp wire runs also.  Once you get
the wire in the tunnel it not too hard because their is pleanty of room the the

Who are the best suppliers of parts for the 928?
"Best", in this case, means both "best price" and

Subject: 928 Prices

The other day a Porschephile wrote me, asking my opinion on
the price of an '83 928.  Part of my answer contained
my understanding that, in general, asking prices for cars
are inflated about 10% over the seller's actual "baseline"
price. Do you folks concur that this is true for Porsches?
If not, what's a more accurate percentage?

By the way, I noticed in the duPont Registry that a dealer
in Georgia is offering an '87 928 for around $9000.  In
the accompaning photo this Guards Red car had an ugly "chin
piece"-style front bumper jutting out between upper and
lower fairing, and also had 924-style pop-up headlamps instead
of open-faced pop-ups. Was this a legit 928, or did somebody
chop it up?  The rest of the car was 928 bodywork, so I know
I wasn't looking at a mis-captioned photo of a 924.  Knowing
Porsche's philosophy of evolutionary design change, I
can't imagine it would introduce the 928 with a clean nosepiece
and open-faced pop-ups, switch to a split nosepiece with
dis-integrated bumper and faired pop-ups, then switch back
to the original design.  That raft of chopped-up body designs
that came on the heels of auto safety regulations had "smoothed"
out by '87, hadn't they?

Insure the pistons are rotated into the proper position.  The leading 
inboard & outboard piston has a slight step in its face; this must be 
positioned according to the factory's recommendation or the pad will 
wear improperly and the rotor will show corresponding wear / lack of wear.

Hi all, 

special thanks to all who responded. 
Since my last posting, temperature indications
on my Porsche 944 ('86, 63000miles) are back to normal
and there are no more weird fluctuations.

In any case, I am bringing the car for retensioning
of timing belt next week to my regular mechanic. I'll
have him check the system. His diagnosis over the phone 
was either air pocket, warped valve or thermostat malfunction.
Obviously, he also told me to stop immediately if it overheats.  

If the problem does not reoccur, Kevin's explanation about
trapped air gradually self-bleeding may be right.
Anyhow, if I find out, I'll let you know.

ON ANOTHER SUBJECT:  O I L  TIP
- -------------------------------

I have started to use use AMSOIL (100 percent) 
synthetic 10W30 since the middle of the winter 
(Canadian winter: -30 deg. Celsius / -22 Farnheit). 
I am also using AMSOIL synthetic for differential/transmission
lubrification. 

Boy, what a difference with conventional oil (e.g. Castrol GTX for engine): 
Easier start-up, quieter engine, smoother stick shift...
The car just "feels healthier".
I highly recommend AMSOIL. The improvement is not subtle. It's huge!

this is definitely a hacked up car, or a miscaptioned '87 924S with 
some customizing work.. the price is also a giveaway. '87 928's should 
command 38-50K, if you can buy it for 9, its probably BYOB (bring your

well, i've used automotion (santa clara, ca) and performance products
(van nuys, ca) for new parts and kempton brothers (florida) and 928
international (anaheim, ca) for used parts.  i've been happy with the
service i've gotten from all four, and (in the case of the used parts)
the quality of the parts when they arrived.  usually, i'll call all of
these places when hunting parts and then compare prices.  so far, the
used places have exceeded my expectations for stock availability and
parts quality.

if anyone needs phone numbers, send me email and i'll dig them up.

hmm.  truthfully i don't know.  when i bought my (1980) 928 five years
ago, the seller was asking considerably more than 20% over book value,
but was willing to come down to almost wholesale (the car needed new
door locks and a new water pump and had three leaking injectors but
everything else was good).

my guess is that it was either a really hacked up 928 or a modified
924S.  to the best of my knowledge, porsche did not play with the
standard 928 car design mid-year: meaning that two cars from any one
928 model year look more-or-less the same (modulo front/rear spoilers
and/or side skirts, excatly the same).  if the car you describe is
really a 1987 928S4, they would be asking more like $29k-34 (this
seems typical for out here -- san francisco bay area -- and in the
autoweek classifieds).

$9k for an 87 928, huh?  can you say "roller"?  :-)

Developed same on my racer. Having no regard for aesthetics (it's a *RACE
CAR*...), I just ran a wire through the firewall to connect to the relay
plate, then down the interior firewall, and sort of across the floor board
up against the inner rocker, then up under the dash. Used RTV to hold
the wire down, then painted it all flat black like the rest of the
interior. Works great.

One bit of advice, put a connector between the relay plate and the firewall,
makes disassembly lots easier...

****************************************************************************

In addition to the valve covers (and, I think more likely) things you 
should check:

1)    The oil return tubes.  There are two on each side.  They may
      be seen under the engine running from the head assemblies to the 
      case.  The seals at the ends tend to leak.  Collapsable tubes are
      available (about $50/set) that may be installed with the engine
      in the car.

2)    The (infamous) "breather area."  This is where your oil light
      sender is.  It is **forward** of the throttle body/fuel 
      distributer assembly.  I had my oil light sender fail and 
      piddle oil onto the heat exchangers.  This area may also be
      reached without removing the engine, but it is more work.  I will
      mail or post details if anyone wants to know.

See if you can see where the oil is coming from and post with more 
information.

i have made arrangements to get a copy of the japanese F1 broadcast of

All Bilstein shocks/struts I've ever seen have been Green in color(colour)
while the Boge's are Black.  For autocrossing, most of the people I know run
the adjustable Koni sport shocks/struts.  This adjustability gives you some
control in tuning the suspension as well as allowing you to soften up the
ride if you intend on driving the car on the street with reasonable comfort.
I've never used the Koni's myself, but intend upon putting a set on the RS
sometime in the near future.

i would really recommend against the photocopy route because some of the
pictures are a little dark as it is, and the black lines occasionally
drawn across the figures to point out locations of things just simply
won't show up (even if the rest of the picture does).

Can anyone give me some insight into fixing a problem I have.
1987 930 but I'm sure the regular 911 is the same
The problem:
My heat does not shut off all the way.
I have a climate control switch between the seats not the lever type.
With it set on zero and all the knobs on the dash to the left I still get some

Any suggestions on what I can do??
Jack it up and climb under and turn the valve with my hands or a wrench?
Is it an adjustment with the climate control??

My '80 928 is leaking oil apparently from the distributor side cam seal and
I'm thinking of trying to replace the seal myself.  It looks, from the parts
diagram I have, to be a simple matter of removing the timing gear and taking
out the old seal and putting the new one in.  Besides the matter of the belt
having to be replaced and tensionned, is it that simple?

The car's been at the dealer b/c it wouldn't run over 400 RPM.  They fixed
it saying that the distributor shaft had jumped!  Anyway, they're supposed
to fix the seal, but have claimed they can't get  it. I want to try it. Thanx

Subject: need early 356 part

OK, this is wierd: I'm looking for a 356 flywheel, 180mm size, that's
been surfaced so much that it's no longer usable as a 180mm flywheel.
Thus, it would be "dead" and useless to anyone needing a 180mm flywheel.

This is an experiment. Reviewing some dimensions, it looks like I can
take a 180mm flywheel, drop it on a lathe, and make it into a 200mm
flywheel within wear limit. If I'm right, this will save lots of people
who need 200mm flywheels money. If I'm wrong, then I haven't wasted much
time and the 180mm flywheel was dead anyway...

So, if you have one of these guys, or trip across one, or know where
to lay hands on one, do drop me a line.

I think you're mostly correct here, Tom.  However it's my understanding 
that all 944 engines were built in Stuttgart.  Audi built the 944 under 
contract until the end of the 944 series.  The 968 is built in Stuttgart.

Just to contradict myself though, I visited the factory in '86 and 
recall 911 & 928 engines being built, but can't say I recall any 944 engines.

. . . stuff deleted here . . .

Stan,
I have it from a pretty good source that the wear limits on both 180mm and
200mm flywheels are the same.  Are you sure that the 200mm flywheel has a
greater wear limit (the clutch can engage "deeper" into the thing before
it runs into problems with the gland nut) than the 180mm does?
(Also, DO NOT thin the head of the gland nut for more clearance with
clutch disc hub.)

You get at least an extra millimeter of depth on the C/SC flywheel. That's
a lot. And some of the other dimensions are such that you can surface some
off the edge to reduce the apparent depth and gain more room to machine.

>(Also, DO NOT thin the head of the gland nut for more clearance with

Yup. Figured that out back in the old Type I days... Amazing what
happens if you do....

True. Designed by Porsche engineers in Wiessach, the
924/944 series was built in the VW plant at Neckarsulm, just
25 miles from the "true" Porsche manufacturing facility at
Zuffenhausen. Porsche had plans to move the manufacturing of
the series to Zuffenhausen up until the project was cancelled.
I was under the impression that all of the 944 engines, including
the turbo and the S2 were always built at Neckarsulm. Any
historians care to elaborate?

The 968 may be being built in Stuttgart, but is it being *sold*

mean is anyone *buying* them?

I live in Silicon Valley, where one of everything goes by in
the course of a week. (Okay, it's been a while since I saw
a Testarossa, but I *did* see a Ferrari 308 and some sort
of Lamborghini the other day.) I think I've seen maybe,
*maybe* one 968 on the streets around there. If PCNA isn't
selling them here, I have trouble believing that they're
selling them much at all.

Does anyone have a confirmed sighting of a 968?

The 944 engine was produced by Porsche only.
  This is something near and dear to my heart for obvious reasons as I
own an '86 951 (aka 944 Turbo).  The chassis was assembled by Audi, and
they did a fine job.

Mark,
     I toured the factory in 1990 and specifically asked about this. All of
the 944's were manufactured offsite (Neckarsulm) under contract with Porsche.
This includes all bodywork as well as the engine. At the time, the only
vehicles being produced at Zuffenhausen were 911's and 928's. I believe that
the 968 has now been added to the Zuffenhausen line.

How do I determine whether I have a new style or old style water pump in my
951? (If I had thought about this earlier in my balance shaft repair job
then I could have read a part number off the pump, but since I like to make
things more difficult for myself...) By looking at the parts advertisements
in Pano, it appears as if there is also a pulley replacement involved in
changing the water pump style. Did the diameter and/or shoulder design of
the pulley(s) change??? The outer timing belt cover is still off so I can
make measurements, if needed. Other facts: pump was replaced 3 or 4 years
ago, car has 43k miles.

Thanks in advance.

Tom, I think the answer is "false."  My '84 944 was a European delivery car
for the original owner (one before me).  He toured the "Porsche" plant and
photographed virtually the entire manufacturing process.  Every few years he
treats the local Porsche Club members to a slide show of the trip.  To my
knowledge he wasn't able to do the same research on his current 911, maybe
it was really made by VW in Mexico!

i've seen several up in blackhawk (a really ritzy area in the east
bay; in particular, the blackhawk market is a grocery store where you
can get "sushi fillings" :-).  there's almost always an amazon green
one in front of the blawkhawk market, for example.

in fact, about 3 months ago, i came pretty close to trading my 928 for
one.  then sanity hit and i realized how much money i was going to

Well we are a fairly small group here at PCA Intermountain Region 9 and we have
a new member with a white 968, a pretty car. Personally though, the shape of
the tail does not seem to look as nice as the 944 did.

Mark, 
  I toured the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen in the fall of '92.
I can confirm that 911's, 928's, and 968's are being built there, 
including the engines. I don't know about previous years though.

Before I get flamed much more...my apologies to Tom re: the Audi connection.
 The slide show I remember DID include my wonderful water cooled 944 engine
from Zuff...n (fill in your own German letters) but the body parts were
actually 911s.  Research says that just like the MB500sel the early 944 was
assembled in various places.  Those were the days when P was making and
selling so many cars they had to rent space somewhere else.  Nowdays they
can make cars for other people since no one is buying theirs.

I WAS WRONG!  But what the heck - I like Audis too.

Yup. Saw a couple in the streets of Montreal last month,
probably the same one that is in Houston now!
They had an Ontario license plate though. 

The driver's taste in woman was good in my judgement 
given the age group (mid 30's).
I'll let you comment on his taste in cars...
Actually, I might as well comment on his car too:

I find that Porsche's marketing strategy 
must have been devised either by a kindergarden school child or
worse: By its current CEO which I hold at equal level of respect in
terms of good judgement. 

Seriously though, the 968 should have either been positioned as a 
"cheap Porsche" and priced subsequently much cheaper
or alternatively should have been endowed with a much more powerful 
engine (nice aggressive Turbo). 
Granted, it has Porsche quality, maneuverability,... but ANY
japanese sports car or even the new Camaro (V8, 275 hp) beats it 
in terms of performance specs. The 968 is only 236 hp!!!!!

They probably reasoned that by introducing a 968 Turbo model, they 
would be cannibalizing on the sales of their other "higher end" models.
Well, I've got news for them... Their other models are not competitive
in today's market! The only remaining loyal customers are the
911 lovers which will always be there no matter what they do.

Subject: 914 body seals

I was cleaning out my 914 parts closet the other day, and found a cache
of unused Porsche rubber body seals I'd purchased two years ago. Since
I just sold my street 914 (the 1.8), and since the racer doesn't *NEED*
rubber 8{), I've decided to make someone out there a good deal on the
kit.

Here's what I have:

PART NUMBER		DESCRIPTION			"DISCOUNT" PRICE
914.531.82[12].10	door seals that mount on body		$ 65 ea.
914.531.81[34].10	door seals that mount on door		$130 ea.
914.511.901.10		front trunk seal			$ 35
914.512.317.10		front part of rear trunk seal		$ 55
914.512.315.10		main part of rear trunk seal		$ 60

							total	$540

Price shown is my discounted cost via my cheapest supplier. For reference,
check the current Automotion catalog -- I don't have one handy right now,
but looking recently I think this is lower than their prices, and is at
least 15% under normal cost at the dealer, but I could be wrong on that too.

I'll sell this whole package for say $400. All the rubber is Porsche OEM,
not repro. You *CAN* get some of these pieces cheaper in repro, but they
just don't last as long (which is why I got the Real Stuff...)

Shoot me a note if you're interested. I may be interested in dealing/trading
for stuff, too.

Yeah I live in the area too and have seen only 2 on the road since
they first came out.  I still think they should of put a 5 cylinder

Mark -

The easiest solution is to get the part number off the pump if at all
possible.  I believe that the updated pump added a metal "rail" or
what would perhaps be better called a guard, which I also believe is
visible if you remove the timing belt cover.

In any case, there is a tech bulletin with photos of the old and new
pumps, showing the parts differences.  I can dig it out and mail you a
photocopy if you'd like.

Two interesting models of the 968 in Europe are the 968 Club Sport,
devestating handling, 20mm lower, sport suspension, no electric gizmos,
100 kilos lighter, fat wide turbo-style wheels, turbo brakes, no
silly seats in the back, ligtweight racing seats etc etc.
In the UK the is 28000 sterling, at least 6000 sterling less than
the standard 968 version. I think that this is very competitive on price,
and unmatched in price/performance/quality ratios.

For those with 70000 Sterling there is the 968 Turbo S. Handbuilt by the
racing department at Weissach (sp?), this is an utterly brutal (I think
380HP plus massive torque) road racer with suspension and brakes seriously
uprated over the standard 968.

The top line Japanese "sports" cars are all far more expensive 
the 28000 sterling 968 CS in the UK at least, and personally I would rather 
drive a Trabbant than a Kamosukazdaota MXLCII 12x-15a loaded with pointless 
gizmos, (But in the meantime I will stick with my 911!!)

All 951s should have had the "new" water pump installed.  Non-turbo 
944s had a switchover period, with some having old pumps and some new 
ones.  The "new" pump has additional outputs for turbo cooling, which 
are plugged when used on non-turbo cars.

I don't know anything about dimensions or measurements for identifying 
which pump you have.  I'd expect that there wouldn't be much choice 
anyway, since you have a turbo.

The latest Christophorus (in the U.S. - probably March issue) has a 968 
Turbo S article.  Something like 300-310 bhp is available in the 
"standard" car, and 336 bhp in the special, race-only version.

They really should just sell the darn car, without worrying about what 
will happen to the couple hundred 930's they sell annually!

I'm starting to look at some (fairly) recent model 911's.  I'm
considering an '88 or possibly a little older (because of cost).
I'm not really a gearhead, but I do basically understand what's
going on in the car, are there specific things I should be looking
for wear on this age of a 911?

Any recalls, or defects that I should make sure have been fixed?
What is most likely to fail on this age car?

Are the pre-purchase inspections that a garage does worth doing?  Does
your average garage know enough about these kind of cars to look
at them?

Another thing.  The closest Porsche dealer is about 3 hours away from
here, but there is a very good sports car repair place in town.  Is
an established Porsche-shop worth the money?

Late model Carreras are some of the best built and durable road
Porches ever made, so very little should be wrong with an '87-'88,
mechanically that is.

Since these cars hold value pretty well every body shop drools at
the prospect of buying a wreck and patching it up and selling it
for a nice profit. So my word of advice is to look carefully for
body damage because often it is not repaired correctly. I recently
saw a supposedly "mint" '83 cabrio which looked really nice from
the outside. But a minute hairline crack in the paint on the rear
quarter where the leaded seam runs from the rain-gutter to the
decklid opening revealed a car that was probably run over by a
train and sectioned in the rear (commonly know in body-shop
parlance as "clipped"). If you suspect this sort of damage either
pass the car up or have it more thoroughly inspected by a
competant bodyshop.  I'm not saying that a car *can't* be properly
fixed after a major accident, I'm saying it's not likely.

The absolute *best* way to discover this sort of thing is to look
at many prospective cars and memorize what the welds look like.
Look at door jams and lockpost area. Look at how the factory weld
is finished with seamsealer in the joining of the lockpost to
rear quarter. Also look carefully in the front trunk and around
the rear deck for signs of nonstandard welds. Porsche is very
sparing in the placement of seamwelded joints, with most metal
joined by spot-weld. There are too many tell-tales to mention.

There is no substitute for the experience in seeing alot of examples, 
and there is no greater disappointment than finding out that your
new purchase can't be properly aligned.

Subject: 968

My wife bought a '92 968 coupe last fall.  I had owned an '86 944 Turbo and she
never forgave me for trading it off.  We were looking around at the
VW/Porsche/Audi/BMW dealer one Sunday and I jokingly suggested she buy the 968
in the window.  The next thing I knew she had negotiated a very good price,
thought it over, talked it over, and bought it.  Great lady - I love her a lot.
  Oh, her name is Kathy Porsch (no e), and owning a Porsche has always been a
dream.

After driving her's (when she'll let me!), I believe the 968 is terribly
underrated. It has all the good things from a 944 or 951 and more.  Suspension,
brakes, engine (in particular), 6-speed transaxle, design make it a worthy
Porsche.  It is more fun to drive than my 944 Turbo was: step down and it goes
 - right NOW.  Kathy's not quite convinced to do a PCA driver ed event yet, so
it hasn't been to the track, but I suspect the car would be a blast.

Also, IMHO the designers did an excellent job of making it look more like a
Porsche than the 924 or 944.  It's amazing to see a current 928, 911, and 968
side-by-side.  They all share a classic Porsche look, but have their own
personalities.

Yes, it costs too much (we and Porsche all know that Porsche has to get it's
act together), but if Kathy's experience is any indication, the price is pretty
negotiable.  She's very happy with the car and I like it a lot.  Yeah, there
are probably "better" buys, but then I'm not on the mazdaphile list...

Subject: 944 coulant temp


Hi all,

in case you want to know what the problem behind
the weired temperature fluctuation was, here it is:

There was a tiny hole on the rubber tube carrying 
the coolant out of the engine which gave off coolant
at high rpm. The thermostat and gasket have also been
changed even though I can not see anything wrong with 
them. The hole is due to a design flaw as the positioning of
steering mechanism which pushes on the tube and slowly grinds 
the rubber over several years. For this reason, the new 
replacement tubes come with a protective extra coverage.

On another subject, while retensioning the timing belt, 
my mechanic told me that it was not properly installed. 
Some pully which was supposed 
to push counter-clockwise on the belt was pushing clockwise.
Also, one of the pullies pushing the balance shaft belt 
was left unused. Is it possible that my engine would have worked 
for a whole year (since the timing belt change last year)
if these statements were true? 

Anyways, there is a difference now in the feel of the car. 
The engine is much more nervous and the car responds 
more promptly to acceleration.

My opinion: NEGOTIATE!  Based on magazines and some opinions in

This car is on sale here in Australia, too.  It has been competing in
various production car races and has done extremely well, finishing
first or second.  The only car that beats it is the new Mazda RX7.
Porsche are pushing the car for sale, and are definately willing
to negotiate (a little bit!).  Other models are being offered with
favourable leases, etc, as well.

I agree it is probably not selling well, probably because of the
flat economy, but I also can't agree that it is so far behind the
competition.

Subject: 928 Timing Belt

Has anyone successfully replaced their SOHC 928 timing belt *without* the
special belt tension meter 9201 ($400)?  Alternatively, do you know what the
tension would be on a standard tension meter that a typical service station
might have?  The tool is too expensive and the dealer wants hundreds to do
it.  The Chilton's urges the 9201 tool in one place, and then in anothersays
"Tighten the... bolt until the belt can be twisted only 90 degrees between
the tension roller and the right camshaft sprocket."  Finally, can I putthe
belt on myself & get the dealer to cheaply tension it?  Thanx, Jeff

An item of note to Texicans and neighbors from OK and LA, and any
passing wanderer who happens to be heading this way at the right time:

It's that time of year again... the 13th annual Little Le Mans
high-speed auto cross is coming up on June 27th in Austin, Texas. This
is an autocross whose course design is scaled directly from the original
Le Mans road course, including the Mulsanne straight. BTW, you'll top out
3rd down that straight in a hot street 911, and be well up towards topping out 
4th in a Prepared or Modified car...

This event is limited to *EUROPEAN MARQUES ONLY*. As the event is put on by
the Hill Country Region of the Porsche Club of America, lots of Porsches 
are expected, but in years past, Alfas, BMWs, Ferraris, Lamborghini, and 
countless British models have filled out the field. And lots of "race cars"
of mixed parentage have shown up too -- I think that under some quirk of
logic that FVs are "European", for example... Not sure about FFords,
though.

Snell 1980 and later helmets are required, and both the car and helmet must
pass tech inspection. Cars will be classed similarly to SCCA Solo II rules
but there are some variation.

For further info, contact Jim Bob Bryant at (512) 835-1647.

   I'm starting to look at some (fairly) recent model 911's.  I'm
   considering an '88 or possibly a little older (because of cost).
   I'm not really a gearhead, but I do basically understand what's
   going on in the car, are there specific things I should be looking
   for wear on this age of a 911?

I agree with what John C wrote, esp. the part about experience.  Which
you almost certainly do not have, like most of us.  So I would recommend
that you take any prospective purchase to both a good body shop and to
a good mechanic.  I certainly would.

The great news is that you're in the market for a recent car, and they
are terrific.  What you will count on the body shop and mechanic to find
are signs of abuse or poor maintenance, rather than age.  Things like body
repairs (good or bad), marginal clutches and transmissions, and so forth.

As of the end of '91, there had been no recalls or service actions by
Porsche on MY 87 or 88 911-series cars.  When you do buy a car, let PCNA
know that you own it by filling out and mailing in the card in the car's
Maintenance book (or if that is missing, get a card from any dealer).  Any
dealer can call up your car's service action history on their computer.
By registering with PCNA, they know how to find you if they ever need to.

I would select the body shop and mechanic by getting several recommendations
for each from local PCA folks.  Then go out and meet them, and check out
their shops.  With respect to selecting the mechanic, there are plenty
of excellent Porsche mechanics working for dealerships and working as
independents.  I would not be prejudiced toward or away from dealerships.
In either case, there is nothing like volume to foster quality.  So find
a mechanic who works on a lot of 911's, not just one roughly every week.

Well, *my* dealer tells me that this information is avalable only
for warranty repairs...they don't keep any other records.

Subject: 1987 944 Turbo (951) Compression

I did a cylinder compression test on my '87 951 with 60,000 Miles:
Cylinder 1 : 120 (all are average of two readings but were consistent)
         2 : 127
         3 : 125
         4 : 125

Are these acceptable ? I can't find the information as to what they're supposed 
to be. Am I correct in assuming that these readings are probably fine (Less than 
10% difference between cylinders). Does this exclude are at least make a blown 
head gasket less likely ? The pressure came up progressively with each stroke. A 
mechanic told me that when a head gasket blows you'd expect about 20 pounds less 
pressure in adjacent cylinders than in the other 2. Is this so ? Do head gaskets 
always break between cylinders ? Do they break at the sides ? Would a 
compression test tell you that ?
I'd appreciate the input of the more experienced porschephiles out there.

Thanks

Bart

Sorry for not being more clear.  I said "service action" meaning work PCNA
authorized and paid for, as opposed to normal "service."  "Service
action" is PCNA-ese for "hidden warranty," and "campaign" is for "recall."
