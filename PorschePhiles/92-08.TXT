surface of both rear disks ("rotors"?) is not clean and shiny, though the

"exercising" them.

Philip,

Exercising calipers is a method of breaking loose caliper pistons that have 
bonded to their rubber seal ring.  I first saw it in an article by Chuck 
Stoddard in Panorama years back and I've since discovered it in my shop 
manual for the 914.  For a dual piston caliper (911's, 914's, some others), the procedure is simple.  Remove one pad and replace it with a piece of thin wood,
a worn out pad, or anything that will allow you to get the piston most of the
way extended and still retract it manually.  Retract the piston as far as you 
can by pushing it back with a C clamp or whatever works.  Now extend it as 
far as possible by pumping it out with your foot on the brake pedal.  Retract
and repeat three or four times.  Do for all caliper pistons.  Check your brake
fluid often while doing this; retracting the pad could potentially overflow the
resevoir and extending could drain it (for extremes of low/high level). 

Since you have a 944, you probably have single piston calipers, unless you have
a turbo or at least turbo brakes.  I've never done this on a single piston 
caliper, but it seems easy enough to adapt.  Remove both pads and replace with
worn pads or something thin, retract and extend piston several times.  The worst
thing you can do (I've done it) is to forget to put in the thin object.  Then
you have to somehow retract the piston off your disc with no place to push!

The problem you describe does not sound like a sticky piston.  Assuming you
do have single piston calipers, assymetric (one pad more than the other)
disc or pad wear is more likely due to excessive drag in some other component 
of the caliper.  I would remove the pads and inspect the areas where the 
(floating) caliper slides over the fixed mounts.  The pads should be free
sliding.  From what you describe, I'd expect the inner pad to be stuck, so 
the outer one is doing all the work.  I saw this problem on a Honda recently, 
one pad was totally worn away, while the other had about 6 mm left on it.
My experience with single piston calipers is limited (my Fiesta and my Ford
truck, plus a Honda I "consulted" on), but I think you'll find this to be 
accurate. 

You might try a few maximum performance stops from moderate speeds (100 kph)
in a safe area to exercise the brakes in a different way; sometimes this 
dramatically improves their feel.

Subject: 944 rollbars again...

Sorry to keep bringing this up, but after much soul searching, I'm still
having a hard time deciding what sort of roll bar/cage to put in my 944
turbo. 

I've looked into the Saftey Devices cage and I was (until yesterday)
ready to run out and either buy one or have a local shop cutom make me
one of similar design.  It'll require a little welding inside the car,
but I think I'm resolved to go ahead and do that. The nice thing about
this design is that, while the rollbar hoop is permanently attached to
the car, the rest of the cage is 'easily' removable (the sales dude at
Shoestring Racing claims "10 or 20 minutes to install/remove the cage by
yourself"). (BTW: does anyone know of any other suppliers of SD bars
other than Shoestring?)

My mechanic _strongly_ advises against a bolt-together cage. His
reasoning is that in the event of a crash, the bolts (or the welds near
them) will probably fail -- he cites an incident several years ago when
he crashed his Spitfire and says that the cage almost killed him when it
broke apart...

My reason for leaning towards a bolt-together cage is that the car is my
street car and a full cage would appear to be rather invasive for
day-to-day driving (e.g. the A-pillar bars look like they'll impede
airflow out of the side fresh air blowers and block access to the window
switches; the dead-pedal will be partially blocked). Can anyone with a
caged 944 comment on the cage's impact on the car's creature comforts?
Unfortunately all the local caged 944's have been sold out of the area
recently so I won't be able to look at any examples until my next event
(at which time, I hope to have already installed the cage...)

I drive at 6-8 club (PCA/BMWCCA) events per year. Once I get the cage, I
plan on competing in the HSR Walter Mitty events 2-3 times a year at Rd.
Atlanta -- I'll drive in the "Sports" class which from what I gather has
similar passing rules, etc. to PCA club events.  I have no plans to
start wheel to wheel racing in this car. [My apologies to the w2w list --
I'm a lurker looking for as much advice as I can get: On this particular
topic, I'd guess that you guys to have more experience than the school
or porsche lists...] 

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Brake Bleeding Kits

Steve, I have the Mityvac bleeder and am pleased with its functionality.
It's only drawback is that you do tend to suck air through the threads
of the bleeder valve (that is not a problem, but it is disconcerting
the first time you see it).

There are two levels of mityvac available.  The first is a plastic,
light duty one (I believe that performance products sells this one).
The second is aluminum (or metal, at least), has a vacuum gauge, is
rebuildable, and comes in a plastic carrying case.  That is the one to
get. It is available from Imparts in St Louis.

The bottom line, out with the old fluid, in with the new, and don't
get any air bubbles in the lines while you're doing it.

I use a homebrew approach which works quite well, assuming you have an
air compressor or other source of compressed air at relatively low
pressure and volume.

Buy a replacement brake reservoir cap (914 and 944 are interchangable),
either new or at a swap meet. Drill a suitable hole in the center of the
cap and install a standard tire valve. I bought a metal one (actually
a set of 4) designed for mag wheels which uses a nut and several rubber
washers for mounting, to make sealing to the cap relatively easy.
Buy an air chuck which clips onto a tire valve (they are more frequently
used for getting initial bead sealing in mounting tires)- Pep Boys
has them, but I'm sure others do also.

To use, replace the standard cap with the cap with the valve. Set the
compressor to about 20 PSI and attach the air hose to the tire valve 
in the cap. Use standard bleeding equipment (e.g. a hose and a can or
bottle) at each wheel. Just open the bleeder, and fluid comes out for
as long as you leave the valve open. Note that you can go through a
lot of fluid quickly, so check the reservoir frequently. Don't forget
to reduce the pressure to 20 PSI or so, or you WILL make a big mess.
If you use something other than a compressor (like an air bottle),
I would still rig up a regulator to hold the 20 PSI.

Subject: Wax?

This may open the flood gates!  I have been very happy using 100% (is it
really?) Carnuba Wax on my '84 944.  The car is Copenhagen Blue (VERY dark
blue) and I've found the Carnuba Wax keeps it looking new.  My Porsche dealer
is now stocking (and pushing) a "system" by ZYMOL.  I also had ocassion to
visit a very reputable body shop whose owner recommends (but DOESN'T sell)
something called "AQUA-SEAL" (by Vespa? or Vesta?).  He saids there is nothing
better for very dark colored cars.  I can't find it.  Any one know it?

The literature for the ZYMOL is impressive, a different pamphlet for each of
at least 3 steps, a "bathe" (the cute "e" puts me off), a pre-wax cleaner, and
a wax. The wax comes in 3 varieties (one for light colors, one for dark
colors, and one for Japanese paints of any color; the latter is called "japon"
 - that's two cuties, yuk).  Supposedly this stuff is great for all cars but
especially good for those with "clear-coat" finishes. The pre-wax step is $14
and the wax (enough for two applications) is $35!!

Are there any "concourse" types among the readers who have knowledge (or
opinion?) about waxes and wax-like compounds for cars which we pretend will
last forever and, unlike their drivers, look like it?  Obviously there are
climatic variations; some "waxes" are better for sunny climes (NOT Michigan)
and some better for snow and salt (that's us).  Seems obvious anyway.  But, I
don't have the answer.  Do any of you?  I'm sure there are a lot of scams out
there.  It's not that much different from oil additives, rust proofing, and
other schemes designed to separate me from my $.  Can anyone help cut through
the haze and....I'll end before I lapse into any more double entendre.

the oil pressure sender and allows the oil pressure sender wire to pass

I got one of the MightyVac's from Imparts, it's great. The model is
the SilverLine which is their all metal delux version. They also make
a plastic model with out the vaccum gauge for around $30 but I'd 
spring for the SilverLine. They outline a number of uses for it int
the manual besides brake bleeding. It has saved me hours on my
'77 Mercedes tracking down vaccum leaks. One thing is that the
rubber fitting that attaches to the bleeder valve on the caliper
does allow some air to slip into the bleeder line (not back into
the brake system) so it looks like you are sucking out a lot of 
air, but it's just the way the adaptor seats. I think a bit of 
silicon vaccum grease would stop it.

Robert,

For your missing oil sending unit grommet, I'd try Automobile Atlanta in 
Marietta, GA.  I hate to recommend them, but sometimes they have 914
parts you just can't get anywhere else.

Your drivability problem could be lots of things.  If you get black smoke out
the exhaust, the pressure sensor is likely bad.  Since you just put the engine 
back in the car, I'd look for disconnected or broken vacuum hoses.  Make sure
your timing and dwell are OK, especially since the timing marks on the 
impeller can be hard to find on some cars.  I once had the timing so far off
the exhaust lines were glowing red, all because I mistook a red smudge
for the 27 BTDC timing mark.  If nothing found, do an RPM drop test to see if
all the cylinders are working OK.  If still nothing, try either a leak-down or
compression test.

You really didn't say what maintenance was performed while the engine was
out.  The above is a generic troubleshooting procedure.  Tell me more specifics
and I'll try to be more helpful.  The universe of possible problems is much 
larger after major engine work than if it just started happening by itself.

And don't expect to find 914 parts at a Porsche dealer.  We`ve been forgotten
as Porsche has taken its vehicles so far upscale that only 4500 people in the
US cared to purchase them last year.  My favorite parts source is Zim's @
800-356-2964.

Steve,

I have two 914 race cars, one with a welded cage and one with a bolt in Safety
Devices cage.  If bolt in wasn`t good enough, SCCA wouldn't allow it for 
racing.  Showroom stock and IT both allow bolt in cages.

I suspect your mechanic's problem was due to improper bolts or improper design.
You should get a copy of the SCCA General Competition Rules for a guide to 
the right way to do safety systems.  

One of my cages is from Safety Devices, and I'm sure these folks never read
the GCR.  The cage is strong enough, but it doesn`t comply with an SCCA 
requirement that all portions of the cage be made of the same material.

I recently helped a friend with installation of a fully bolt in cage on a 
944.  There are lots of people making cages for 944's and prices vary
widely.  The cage did not seem to block anything in the pedal area and the
window switches were accessible (I think).  If the cage you are looking at
blocks these things, find another manufacturer.  I prefer a full cage (minus
the door bar for accessibility) even when driving on the street - racing's
safer!

I have met a number of people who really like the Zymol products, including my

Me, I drive my car year-round.  It's certainly not a concours baggie car, but I

I hate doing a sub-zero wash of my car in January, only to learn that it needs a
coat of wax!  The Zymol products are not durable (this wisdom from several

I have other friends who use the polymer sealants rather than wax, and they too

Subject: re: Brake bleeder tools

I may have mentioned this before.  I have this absolutely wonderful shade-tree
pressure bleeder.  It's called an Eezi-Bleed, and Moss Motors sells it for a tad
under $40 (800-235-6954, fax 805-968-6910).  Moss is a british car
aftermarketer, kind of like Automotion is to Porsches.

The Eezi-bleed comes with the world's assortment of reservoir caps.  Like
Frank's system, it has an air chuck which gets fastened to a tire.  Differently,
the air pressure first feeds a bottle you fill with fresh fluid.  A second hose
leaves the bottle and plugs into a reservoir cap, which you screw onto the brake
fluid reservoir.

They recommend you use no more than 20 lb. of pressure.  I just did my car with
a tire that had 16 lb. in it, no sweat.  The lower the pressure, the less risk
of cavitation during bleeding, which is a somewhat bizarre way of getting more
air into the system rather than out!  This tool is absolutely recommended if
you're going to bleed a hydraulic clutch.

When a friend called two weeks ago, saying he was putting together a Pegasus
order, I splurged on a pair of their Tilton brake fluid catch bottles. 
(414-782-0880).  I had just flushed my wife's car's brakes, and was annoyed (so
to speak) at my clumsiness with a piece of hose and an old spaghetti sauce jar. 
The Tilton catch bottle has a  top and the hose enters into it - no chance of it
flopping out.  The only stupid thing is that you have to remember to crack open
the top, else you'll compress air in the bottle, and when you pull the hose off
the calliper screw, fluid shoots back out!  (You might guess I learned this the
hard way.)

The pair of bottles went for some outrageous price in excess of $20.  However,
with both the Eezi-bleed and the catch bottles, I really love the convenience
they bring; they're worth it.  Moreover, I can get a great bleed with flowing
very little brake fluid, which is darned expensive when it's the high temp
stuff.  I used maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of a bottle this evening.

The one other tool I recommend is a glass turkey baster.  (When doing a complete
flush, you use a baster to remove first as much fluid as possible from the
reservoir.  Then fill the reservoir with fresh fluid.  You end up flushing less
fresh fluid, because it has less of a chance to mix with the old stuff).  I had
a plastic one, but after a few months it hazed up, became brittle, and cracked. 
My wife found the glass one for me at a high-end cooking store.

My car did this for several weeks once about eight years ago.  I
"fixed" it by changing plug plug wires.  A couple of months later it
did it once more, one day, and cleared up.  Hasn't done it since.

Even given the breif recurrance, I still think it was ignition
related.

	I recently wanted to bleed the brakes on my 944, and in the absence
of anyone to help me went around to the local accessory store to see what
they could offer me.

	For the princely sum of 4 pounds (about US$7), I got a low-tech but
effective tool. I can't remember the name of the manufacturer, but
basically you get a length of transparent hose with a one-way valve at the
end and a container which this valve sits in.

	You attach the tube to the bleed nipple, loosen the nipple half a
turn or so, run around and pump the brake pedal a couple of times and then
have a look to see how much air is in the tube. Pump the pedal again until
no air, tighten the nipple and move on to the next wheel.

	You don't need to have the one-way valve immersed in brake fluid,
and you don't have to worry about air getting back into the system when
you take your foot off the pedal (because of the one-way valve).

	As I said, very low-tech, very simple, very cheap *and* it works -
my pedal is a lot firmer since doing this.

Philip

P.S. The hydraulic clutch on the UK spec 944 has a separate reservoir to
the brake fluid. Does anyone know if it is possible to bleed this system?
I've not seen anything which looks like a bleed nipple anywhere. I don't
have any problems with my clutch, but after seeing the improvement to my
brake pedal ...

Subject: 914 Information


ODO Problem:  Very common.  Usually stripped plastic gear that drives odo unit. This problem is caused by the driver resetting the trip odometer while the car is moving.  Appx $40 to fix by reputable speedometer shop.  Problem also common  to several VW 
models, so any speedometer shop that does decent volume of business should
be able to adequately address the problem.
Note: Parts are available, but fixing this yourself is really a pain in the ass.
Oil Leaks/Cleaning:  Take floorjack and car to car wash (do-it-yourself-type)
jack car; remove wheels; go crazy with washer hose.  Highly recommend that this 
be done when car wash is not busy, and owner is not present, as flying clumps
of grease tend to make proprietor irritable.  Drive car home, jack again and 
find oil leaks.  Probably push rod tube seals.  Recommend removal of engine
to replace (much easier), although replacement can be done in car.  Get only
Viton seals as replacements (Available various aftermarket vendors).

Windshield Washer:  Most nifty trick of all!  914 late (post 1972?) have an
additional set of contacts that close when the wipe/wash stalk is pulled.  These
are originally intended to activate the intermittent wiper option, though few
cars were so equipped.  Find appropriate contacts (switched ground) using VOM
at bottom of column connection cluster or visually by removing switch.  Hook
up electric washer pump to these contacts for ground, and ignition hot.  New
electric washers work exactly as if stock but no hose under dashboard, no flat
spare and no unsightly hoses wandering through the luggage area.

Unless you've "looked" above the starter on the clutch bellhousing then you
wouldn't have "seen" the clutch slave cylinder. I use the quote marks
because on my '86 951 it is not possible to see much of anything - only
feel. There is a bleed nipple coming straight out of the slave cylinder to
the rear of the car (same axis as the driveshaft/torque tube). On a 951, at
least, there are also one or more exhaust heat shields (shielding the
starter). One or both of them need to be removed before bleeding. Hope this
helps.

I had a similar problem with my 914 2.0 right after I cleaned 
the distributor.  I took it completely apart, cleaned it and 
greased it. Well, the grease inside started to get gummy in a day
or 2 and the timing
advance weight just can't move until the engine's rpms gets to 3K.
It felt like a turbo engine. Well, I took it apart again, cleaned
it and re-oiled with some high tempature Bosch grease.

Good Luck

I also bought the tool that Kevin mentioned. The Eezi-Bleed works great.

I have a mityvac vacuum pump also. But it draws air boubles thru the 
threads of the bleeder valve; it is Ok but I can't tell if that is
air coming from my break system.  I used it for the complete flush;
vacuum out the old fluid from the reservoir, re-fill the reservoir,
than the Eezi-Bleed or ask my wife to come on out and step on it.

I can't find a more appropriate place, so I'll my Porsche and Autocrossing
friends.

I've been coveting air tools for some time now, but when my new Craftsman
Tool catalog came yesterday, I was looking through it and couldn't figure
out why air tools should be better than electric.  All the statistics,
including price, are pretty similar.  The only significant difference I
could find is that the electrics tend to be a little heavier.

So, why is it again that I really want air tools?

Since you are at Stanford, I might recommend High Performance House in 
Menlo Park.  I tend to think of that place as "the graveyard of all 914's".  
They have a truly amazing number of corpses lying around there.  You can 
find them on (I think) Bay street, just off of Woodside.

They managed to get a few parts for me that I couldn't seem to find 
anywhere else.  They can be a bit pricey--They wanted $150 for a used 
front brake caliper, and I (eventually) found one for about $100.


Another place to try which is a bit more out of your way is EASY, European
Auto Salvage Yard, in Emeryville.  I've heard good things about that place.


Luck!

Well, if you have a compressor and a shop, air tools are great
because you can get so many different things. I routinely
use the air hammer, chisle, impact wrenches, screwdriver,
and blow-off nozzle. Once you have the compressor, the tools
are relatively inexpensive.

With electric (and I have the Sears tool as well) you get a
good tool that you have to replicate the motor for every time
you need a new tool. So, for all of the tooling I have (not
counting compressor) it's far cheaper to use air tools than
use electrics. 

If I needed just an impact wrench, the Sears electric is a 
good thing to buy. Since I needed a compressor anyway, it
was a relatively easy decision to get air tools. 

You really don't want to know how I also wound up with an
electric tool....

I disagree. I spent as much or more on tools as I did on the
compressor, and I bought a *BIG* compressor. By the time you add
bodywork tools (3 sanders, paint guns, etc) into the equation at $N ea,
it gets up there.

	Say, how about a list of useful air tools.

	Impact Wrenches (1/2" anvil and 3/8" butterfly)
	Air rachet (3/8")
	tire chuck
	blower with tip asst.
	reversible high speed drills (3/8" and 1/2")
	sanders (orbital, jitterbug, in-line, rotary)
	grinders (4 *and* 7 inch)
	air hammer with bit asst. (esp tie rod separator!)
	body saw
	hacksaw
	engine washer
	paint guns (airbrush, touchup, and fullsize)
	die grinder &| cut-off tool (1/4")
	siphon feed sandblaster
	Bournulii vacuum thang.
	a couple of old inner tubes (used for lifting things)

Anyone stupid enough to install the air deflectors upside down
deserves a seized engine :>

The Haynes manual also shows the pistons installed upside-down in their
cylinders with the intake cutout in the piston crown pointing downward.
If someone is going to rebuild a 911 engine and be as gulible as that,
then the engine will probably never run anyway :-O

I get a kick out of this stuff! =8-)

The location of the slave cylinder is as Mark described it.  It is mildly
inconvenient to get to even without the extra shields he apparently has.  But
you can reach up to it and get the needed 7 mm wrench and hose onto the nipple,
which should have a protective rubber booty on it, like the brake nipples do.

I found it really easy to get air into the slave cylinder when bleeding it with
someone pumping the pedal, probably because the bleed screw is hard to reach.
Once in, the air is difficult to get out because of the angle of the slave
cylinder.  I recommend you not try bleeding unless you have some sort of
positive-pressure power bleeder, like the Eezi-Bleed.

Someone also suggested to me a while back that it's best to let sleeping dogs
lie.  If the clutch has not been bled in many years, and it is working well,
then bleeding it may only move crud around which damages the master or slave
cylinder's seals.

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

And I only THOUGHT I was busy in June.... I've been gone so much I
didn't even remember I *had* a 911.... I sat down to do list maintenence
tonight for the first time since July 14. Please keep this in mind if you 
have had problems with your subscription.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA. 
If you happen to have on-line copies of your regional newsletter, or
at least the interesting articles, maybe we can set up an article exchange.
Or, if you'd like to write something or have something written that you'd like
to see in print outside of your own region, let me know....

Several members have sent me stuff, and it's great to see guys around here
going "Geeze, this guy must be important to have his article printed so far
from home" Little to they know how easy it all is!

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes) at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

I also struggled with this operation, but, at least in my case, I
think the problem in keeping air out of the system was mainly due to
the fact that the hose connecting the reservoir to the clutch master
attaches fairly high up on the side of the reservoir.  If the fluid
level drops very far at all during the bleeding process, it is
extremely easy to begin sucking air into this hose.  This problem is
exacerbated by the fact that the partition of the reservoir that feeds
the clutch is fairly small, and, at least on my car, it is very hard
to see the fluid level in this little chamber.  Although I have not
used the Eezi-bleeder on the clutch (I have used it on brakes with
great satisfaction, thanks Kevin!), I agree that this is the way to
go.  The Eezi-bleeder will keep the reservoir completely full and
under pressure during bleeding, which should solve the problems
mentioned above.

 -Milo

P.S.: Don't forget to disconnect the battery when attempting to bleed
your clutch.  Although this is good practice in general when working
on your car, it is particularly important when bleeding the clutch
since the starter terminals are in close proximity.

Subject: new to the 'phile group; replacements for the glass hatch on 924/944/944S

Greetings.

I've got a 1977 924 with about 125,000 miles on it; please add me to your
list of people/car type.

If my memory serves me right, there was an aftermarket option that replaced
the glass hatch on a 924/944 that made the car look like it had a notch
in the back:
	
					
		-------_ 
			\   <--- new rear window, canvas/type cover for 
			 \__________.		  horizontal area	
		924/944		     \		
				     |			
			            /		 



(excuse the poor ascii art)

Has anyone ever had any experience with such an option?  Personally, I like
having the hatch; it gives me more room to throw stuff; yet having an
open back seems like an interesting option, especially since the internal
ventilation on my car seems a bit inadequate (no A/C).

We have a 914 whose seatbelts won't retract

    <kyle sez:>

    For all of you out there who are contemplating air tools i would like
   to share my experience with these.
    If you have ever used an air drill for long, you know that these get
   colder the longer you run them.  The same is true for almost all air
   powered tools and is one of the reasons they will outlast an electric
   tool.  Air powered tools are also easier to manufacture and because of
   this, are cheaper, especially the far east vended variety.  These tools
   are simple and relatively easy to get parts to repair them yourself.

    Air tools are also totally worthless without a compressor of sufficient
   capacity to drive them efficiently, and this is where the greatest 
   expense lies.  A good 3 Hp, 30 gallon, single stage compressor will set
   you back 3 or 4 hundred bucks and will only produce around 5 cfm at 
   useable pressure (less cfm at max. pressure).
    Many air tools consume 4 cfm or more and will drain a 30 gallon tank
   down to 40 psi in 3 minutes or less, most tools are weak at that pressure.
    Meanwhile the pump is consuming around 1500 watts of energy. 
    A single stage (any number of cyl.)
   pump is good for around 45% efficiency, a dual stage pump is good for 
   almost twice that.  There is tremendous loss in the making of compressed
   air at 125 psi using any method other than a two-stage pump.
    Your best bet with air tools is to pinch yourself at the onset of
   procurement and buy the 60 gallon, > 5 hp, two-stage compressor -doesnt
   matter if it is gas or electric powered.  By doing this you will save time
   that would be lost in waiting for your pump to build up a useable head
   of pressure to continue working.  Unfortunately, this big tool will set 
   you back nearly a $1000, so you must balance your requirements and
   practicality (your wife, too =8^)).
    With compressors and air tools it comes down to CFM and receiver(tank)
   size if you want to retain your sanity when using these tools.

    Other useful air tools;
   
    Air nibbler  (not a scissor shear type)
    cylinder leak-down tester
    Air powered lift

Thanks for your help - Here's some more information:

My 914 2.0 seems to be missing between about 1800 and 2300 rpm, whether
or not there is load on the engine (when I have it in gear, this causes
lurching/bucking).  A couple of people suggested dwell - I just
installed an Allison optical ignition, so that isn't it (problem existed
before and after installation).  I reset the timing, and the thing idles
very well and is very smooth above 2500 rpm.  It's not an off-throttle
transition problem - if I hold the rpms at 2000, the engine continuously
misses.  I'm pretty baffled!

While the engine was out, I did some rust work on the body and replaced
simple things like fuel line and intake seals.  I didn't split the case
or pull the heads. 

thanks,

Subject: headers 4 911

Is there anyone out there who has a left-side header that they would want
to trade for a right-side header? Or just forget the trade, I need the
left side anyway.  Or maybe a good set of heat exchangers (yeah right!).

BTW I posted a long time ago that I had a complete belly pan for a 911,
(from front suspension mounts, to rear torsion bar area). Someone was 
interested in it, but got cleaned out of my mailbox. Anyway, some idiot kid 
jumped the fence in my backyard and stepped on it :-(   I paid $200 for
it and was asking $150 last post, well considering that it now has a small
dimple at the mid section of the floor, I'm now asking $100.  It isn't
a big dimple, but alas it isn't "perfect" anymore. If anybody is seriously
interested, I can send a picture of it, (probably won't be able to see the
dimple). It is just laying around and I'd rather get it out and under someone's
baby. ;-)

Subject:    914 Inner Rocker Panel Repair

 I'm absolutly brand new to this list and also new to my '73 914 1.7 and as
such I am starting all of my info gathering and self education all over again
since my Austin Mini and race engine building experience doesn't really carry
over very well. The car I bought is in decent shape overall but it is afflicted
with what I understand is the standard rotting inner rocker panels.
 My first thought was to locate a book outlining structural restorations such as
the series "guide to purchase and DIY restoration" that is availlable for the
Mini and various other collector cars. Unfortunatly I haven't seen anything like
this type of book for the 914; is there such a book. I have been told that the
PCA would send me a package of the 914 articles that have appeared in Panorama
but in looking through the magazine I haven't seen any mention of this service
or the cost. I will be joining the PCA shortly.
 So, my question is basically how to do a correct job with the inner rocker
panels. Is there a FAQ about this sort of thing. I am sort of embarassed about
asking this because the veteran 914 owners are probably saying" Oh no, not
another inner rocker repair thread!"
 The main thing I want to know is how to assure the car is straight before
welding up the panels and any tricks or pitfalls that I may need or encounter.
Also do you have to disturb any of the suspention, or to put it another way,
what has to be removed to do a proper job.
 Also, should I worry about getting the highest quality inner rocker panel or
even factory. Could it be a case of the ill-fitting cheaper panels are not worth
the effort in custom fitting as opposed to an identical factory one. I am for
the moment going to assume that places like Automobile Atlanta, Tweeks and the
other big guys are going to supply decent quality in an aftermarket panel. Is
this a correct assumption.
 Maybe there is a back issue of European Car or some other that has covered this
that I could get photocopies from one of you guys or at least a month/issue
number so I can order it.

 One other question. Should I be able to turn off the heat COMPLETLY. I find
that even with everything off I still get heat. I am assuming that the flapper/
valve operated by the floor lever is not closing completly.

Subject: Re: 914 rubber engine parts

Robert,

Thanks for the additional info.  With no engine work done, the troubleshooting 
task gets easier, although driveability problems are really the hardest.  I'd
rather fix a won't start problem, usually (not always) it's obvious.

I once had a miss that I could hear at around 1800 rpm, and every once and
awhile at full throttle. Since this was at a qualifying session, I had to 
fix it, but really didn`t have a clue.  I checked the injection grounds at
the rear of the engine, (fine) dwell and timing (OK) and then did an RPM
drop test.  Two cylinders did not seem to be firing all the time.  Also, 
when I pulled the injector plugs to do the drop test, two cylinders actually 
caused an increase in RPM while the plug was being removed.   The two cylinders
happened to be two that inject at the same time.  A component common to these
is the set of injection points located in the bottom of the distributor.  
Although a failure here usually kills the engine, I found the points were very
oily.  I put in a different set (removed from a different car for the same 
reason and cleaned up) and the problem was solved.  This could be your 
problem.  It would be a coincidence that it happened at the same time as your 
engine removal, but!

Assuming internal engine condition is good and the items on my previous hit 
list have been done, I`d swap injection components one at a time to see if
any affected it.  I'd do it in this order:
 - pressure sensor (easiest to get to and most fragile)
 - trigger points in distributor (mentioned above)
 - injection harness 
 - ECU (most reliable component, do this with harness)
I maintain a stockpile of these parts for this reason.  If you don't have these
spares, bribe a friend with a 2.0 and spend an afternoon swapping.

Another assumption I make is that you've made everything that effects engine 
performance perfect.  Serious troubleshooting of a problem like this should
start from a known baseline: new plugs, points, condensor, good wires, injectors
know to be good, perfect dwell and timing (I'd revert to conventional stock
ignition for the troubleshooting), new good fuel, fuel pressure correct, engine
warm, valve clearances correct, no vacuum leaks, hoses plumbed to correct
locations etc.  Many of these don't relate, but it is sometimes hard to predict
 the response of a system that isn`t in its normal state.

I'd still be suspicious of a vacuum leak (or a trigger points problem).

Let me know what you find out.

Gary

Wow, someone complaining about *too much* heat!  The mind boggles.

This reminds me...  Has anyone converted their 914 (or other air-cooler car,
for that matter) to electric heat?  I am considering going to headers rather
than heat exchangers, removing the messy heat system, and installing some
electric heaters for the defroster and occasional floor heat when I drive
the car in April and October, when it's still occasionally cold.

Is this a crazy idea?  Will it work?  Any thoughts where I might find the
appropriate parts?

Subject:      Damaged Rubber / lawsuit

I have learned via what I believe to be a reliable grapevine that Porsche
is involved in a damages suit with the manufacturer  of Armorall. Apparently
Porsche used to have a deal with Armorall in which they provided an Armorall
car care kit with each new car. The result was a great deal of decaying
rear spoilers, cracked dashboards and so on. I have serious damage to the rear
spoiler on my '81 931 and a typically cracked dash. Does anyone know the
details of the deal with Armorall? ie. What model years did this occur?
Furthermore, can we get any kind of warranty or other assistance from
Porsche?
We would have been better served if they had thrown in a handful of assorted
jumper wires and a good circuit tester with the tool kit instead of
something which eats rubber I think.   :^O

The problem with Armor All and cracking dashes/destroyed rubber is not using
the product.  By this I mean that if you start using it, don't ever stop or
your dash will crack, but as long as you apply it every two weeks or so, your
car will be fine.  Armor All is the drug dependancy of the auto care world.
The have a pretty good racket I think, get a bunch of people to start using
the product, and then build in a cemical imballance that requires constant
reapplication of their product or watch your dash disintegrate.  

Every detailer I have talked too recommends staying as far away as possible
from Armor All if you have never used it yet.  Its sort of like cocaine.

I thought there was some product that contained plasticiser (sp?) which is
the ingredient that makes vinyl soft. I read that this is the preferred
product to use over Armor All. But I don't know the name of the ingredient
nor the commercial product.

I once used Armor All on my 911, and have had various detailers and
car washes reccommend various things none of whihc I would use again.

I HAVE found an off the shelf a product called "something 503" I
think. It is claimed to be used in the aircraft industry and contains
NO petrolieum (sp?) products.  It appears to work after over a year of
use and 6 mos of neglect I don't get the whitening effect Armor All
would produce in a month or two of non-use.

I will get the actual name tonite and send it out.  I buy it in
non-chain auto supply stores but it is hard to find in the Santa Cruz,
CA area.

Actually did this to a 914/6 some years ago. Heat exchangers are made of
unobtainium, and I had this header laying around... Used a VW kit, some
orange 911 heat/air duct tubing, and bent some other metal parts. I forget
what all was necessary. Located it where the gas heater would have gone 
had it had a gas heater (Note for the underexposed: Porsche used to use
a gasoline heater in the Euro versions ofthe older cars. Basicly a little 
ram-jet engine with a heat exchanger. Nice, but wierd. Even late 911s still
have vestigal gas heater fitments. Which is even wierder.)

To get to the seatbelts, you have to take the back panel off of the
rear firewall. To do that, you have to take out the seats and if
you have it, the rear portion of the console.

They are not unit repairable items. They are fairly expensive when you
can find them. The last place that had them was Dennis What's-his-name
who runs the 914 Owners Association. I grabbed a pair at $50/ea. two
years ago, and count myself luck at that price.

How about Lotus being only 4 points behind Lotus in the Supercar series

How about Lotus having an extensive dealership network in the U.S.?

How about the fact that the former president of the U.S. distributor of
Lotus was president of the Porsche distributor before that?

How about the fact that Lotus was the second largest importer of cars from
the U.K. into Japan in the early 80s?

Another thing I read about vinyl "plasticiser". The film that builds up
on the inside of your windows on hot days is evaporated plasticiser. The
article I read said that you want to restore the plasiciser into the vinyl
to keep it soft and keep it from cracking. The article said stuff like
Armor-all was actually bad for vinyl, because it "seals" the vinyl and
actually makes it brittle.

Subject: 944 mpg gauge

A "does this mean something worse is soon to happen?" question.

Yesterday, a beautiful sunny (80 degee) day in Michigan, I was cruising at
about 65 to 70 mph on an almost perfectly flat two lane road (no traffic).  I
noticed the "miles per gallon gauge (simply a vaccum gauge I guess) was buried
in the rectangle at the extreme left of the dial.  This is a 1984 944.  I
seldom pay much attention to this dial but thought it odd that in 5th gear
cruising, not accelerating, the gauge would continue to read like I was
stomping on it. I backed off of the gas and the gauge, as usual, swung quickly
over to the other side of the dial, the 60+mpg side.  As soon as I'd bring gas
back (even though I may have only dropped to 60 mph) the dial would again bury
itself into the rectangle.  On one occassion I even noticed the upshift
indicator light flash - IN FIFTH GEAR!!

I tried changing my driving pattern dramatically, speed (less of it), stopping
and starting again, etc.  I noticed no change in the way the car drove.
Suddenly, and associated with nothing, the gauge came back to the "normal"
position and the upshift indicator light was working as usual.  I drove about
30 more miles and shut the car down for about 20 minutes; Started it and
everything was fine for 10 miles or so (still cruising country 2 lane roads;
5th gear, occassionally 4th - it's straight and flat in this part of MI).
Then, again with no warning, the mpg gauge buries itself, and the upshift
light doesn't come on at all.  I get home shut the car off, go inside get the
Haines (right? Like the underwear??) manual to see what I can figure out - not
much - the wiring diagrams are of limited detail.  But I thought I'd try to
switch a few things on and off to see.  Started the car and everything was
fine again (at least "seemed" fine).

I virtually never use either of this displays (the mpg dial or the upshift
indicator although the latter is remarkably sensible).  But what is going (or
has gone) wrong and what else is linked to it?  Are these displays on the same
circuits as other things I might try to diagnose what's going on?  Or should I
just forget them altogether?

	I have a UK spec 85.5 944 and I also had a problem with my mpg
gauge not working. I don't have an upshift indicator on this car (though
if it's good enough for Formula 1 drivers I wouldn't mind one :-) ).

	In my case, once the ignition was on the gauge would go to
"maximum" (i.e. extreme RHS or 0 mpg), and when the ignition was off it
would rest on the LHS (as normal).

	I must have spent 12 hours or more trying to trace this. Even with
the relevant bits of the factory technical bulletin (which Kevin Gross
kindly sent me) I was having no joy, until I got to the point where I was
disconnecting *every* electrical connector in sight, so that I could clean
them and re-assemble.

	Eventually I came across a red 4-pin connector under the dash on
the passenger side (driver's side in the US) in which one pin had come out
of its socket! I had seen this connector on the wiring diagram but had not
known where it was physically located until I came across it by chance.

	I don't think that the mpg gauge is a vacumn gauge - it's fed from
the tachometer and speedometer (I think). The "intermittentness" of your
problem (and the fact that the upshift indicator is also involved) sound
like a loose connection to me. Try taking out the instrument panel (you'll
need to remove the steering wheel first) and looking for any loose
connections. The Haynes manual covers this for the pre-85.5 car (though
not the later ones, despite what it says on the cover!)

	If you send me your fax number or address, I'll send you a copy of
the tech bulletin which Kevin sent me.

Yes, there is a cure.  I was a Armor All "user" and didn't like the
greasy feel and the whitening that happened if I didn't get to all the
rubber regularly.

After trying several things, I found "303 Protectant" a fall out of
the aerospace industry it claims in the pamphlet that comes with it.
It also says "no petrochemicals or silicones" both of which cause the
problems with Armor All as I hear it.

I've been using it for over a year and often don't get to the rubber
for weeks at a time (as much a 8) with out any bad effects except
looking bad.  It also doesn't give that greasy-glossy look of some
treatments if you use it sparingly.  It has lots of UV protection
which is needed here in Calif.  It is a little hard to find, ususally
in independant Auto Supply/Parts Stores.  Another product I liked but
can't get regularly comes from a Calif Comp called The Wax Shop.

Hope this helps.

said that one can:

  a) replace ("feed") the plasticizers in the plastic, or
  b) seal the plastic in such a way that the plasticers cease to evaporate
out of it.

Which is not to say the neither is possible - I just don't know one way or
the other.

Another thing I read about vinyl "plasticiser". The film that builds up
on the inside of your windows on hot days is evaporated plasticiser. The
article I read said that you want to restore the plasiciser into the vinyl
to keep it soft and keep it from cracking. The article said stuff like
Armor-all was actually bad for vinyl, because it "seals" the vinyl and
actually makes it brittle.

I have never seen any, but you may be able to do what I did.  Go
down to your local Porsche repair place with a small bottle and ask
for a few dribbles of your paint.  You don't need much for touch-ups
(they gave me about 400ml, which has lasted now about 5 years).

I must say my '83 944 doesn't have a particularly good paint job.  It
is thin, chips easily and is prone to fading in the sun quite quickly.
I have waxed the car a number of times to try and stave off the dull look,
but of course the cutting takes yet more paint off.  So much for
Guards Red!

I have a bottle of Guards Red touchup paint -- it's a tiny 18ml bottle
with integral brush (just like VW paints). The color matches my '87 951
very well.  I seem to remember it cost a few dollars at the dealer.

I bought  a small bottle of Porsche factory touchup paint at the
local Posrche dealer.  It came with a brush built into the cap
and a small wire brush on top of the cap.  It was cheap -- around
$7, and it was in stock.

Two things:

1. When you ask for the paint, you have to know the official Porsche
name or number for the color.  For example, "Guards Red", "Alpine White", 
or "Chiffon White" (my car).

The name/number is supposed to be on a sticker on your doorpost or in
your trunk.  My car had no sticker, so I had to flip through the
color brochure for my year to find the name.  The dealership was
very helpful.  Note that different models within the same year
have different available colors.

2. Don't use the brush on the inside of the cap; it's way too big
for touching up small nicks.  Go to a hobby shop and get a smaller
brush.

Subject: Re: paint?

Paul -

I know from looking in a PCNA parts catalog recently that at least some of the
standard colours are available as parts (guards red, grand prix white, etc).  I
don't know about the less long-lived paints.

As Jon mentioned, the paint code is printed on a sticker somewhere in the car. 
In 944-series cars, there's a silver paper sticker on the body in the engine
bay, between the fresh air fan and the central electric board.  I believe all
cars also have a full build list sticker somewhere.  In 944's and 928's, it's
under the carpet in the rear hatch.  It will show the paint code (not its name,
but some code like "LY5Z").

Moreover, if your car was made for the US, PCNA has all its particulars in their
computer.  Any dealer can, given your VIN, look up its build list, production
date, and so forth.  For non-US (or perhaps all) cars, Porsche AG has the info
in their Cardex system; I have an address somewhere to which you can write.

My preferred technique for application is a straight pin.  Beforehand, clean out
the stone chip, and the pin, with a solvent like Prepsol, Pre-Kleeno, or
Acryli-Clean.  Rust, wax, and dirt in the chip will not only interfere with the
paint's adhesion, but can also discolour the paint, esp. metallics.  With the
non-metallic paints, you can flatten and blend the edges of the chip with fine
sandpaper.  This works a lot less well with metallics.

	I was able to get touch-up paint as a stock item from my local
Porsche dealer for my black 944.

	I don't have it with me, but think it has a 911 part number. It
comes in a small bottle with quite a thick brush built into the
handle - too thick for small spots.

	It was relatively expensive - about #6 (compared with #1.50 for
touch-up paint from a GM dealer when I had a Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel
Ascona).

	You will need the "paint number" for your car - on the 944 this is
on a sticker behind the spare wheel.

No personal experience with the 008P's but a good friend uses them on his
Turbo-look for street, track and the ocassional autox. He claims to get good
tread wear, and seems to be reasonably sticky on the track. I usually
toast him in my Euro 911SC with AVS Intermediates, though, so who knows?
Then again, he's clearly not a 10/10ths kind of guy...

I did just order a new set of AVS today. I've gotten about 18 months of
wear out of them, including about 20K miles of street wear, 20 autocrosses
(that's events, not laps), and 4 track days. I *HIGHLY* recommend them.
At least for the air-cooled crowd. No claims for water-pumpers.

Watch out, or Mark Sirota will get you! (Hint: there at least 4 people on 
this list actively campaigning 914s SUCESSFULLY in autox or road racing. 
Be careful about such statements....)

The rules are different, but in some classes, 914's take names and kick ass.
Both autox and road race. Depends on the car and driver combination A LOT,
and to some extent who else is driving what else.

You call up the national office and ask for a set of rules. Ruth can usually
UPS them to you in a day or so. If you're a member, look in the back of Pano
for the phone number. I don't remember what they cost these days. If you're

Pretty much the case. They charge points oddly, to my way of thinking.

Don is undoubtably aware of that...  In SCCA autocrossing, 2.0's do very
well in C Stock (Reitmeir just keeps winning), 6's do quite well in F
Prepared (Team.Net's own David Ferguson has popped into the autox world and
done impressively well), and it's not unusual to see some former 914's in E
Modified.

In Street Prepared, though, 914's just don't show up, and that's the
conversation on the autox list to which Don is referring.  They are
currently misclassed in SP, but it looks like that will be correct next
season, and hopefully we'll be trophying in CSP soon.

Re: '83 911SC Euro with pinging

I just had a tuneup and mentioned what I have learned from the

He mentioned there is a vacuum advance in the control circuit of the
FI that is *JUST* for coming on when load is high but *NOT* at
full-throttle.  This is just what I experience at high engine and
ambient temps.

Anyone know of this to be true of just Euro cars?  What would this be
for?  He says he will disconnect it if I still get ping and want to get 
rid of this possible cause.  

By the way, it is not pinging right know, immediately after the tuneup
and we are having a heat wave, 90-100 F so I can test it readily.

Yeah, the service records!

A friend of mine bought a 86 944 and a week later, his water pump failed.
Two main design flaws on the 944 concern the water pump and the timing
belt. The water pump was repaired using an update kit and he cautiously
replaced the tming belt. Needless to say, it cost him $$$. The service
record for the car should indicate that these mods have been performed or
you should negotiate the price accordingly.

Good luck.

The pressure control device AKA "warmup regulator" and fuel distributor
are *DIFFERENT* for the Euro SCs (and probably other Euro CIS 911s too).
I tried to map the curve for the two, but given what the device does,
that is use temperature and manifold pressure to regulate fuel pressure,
it's not hard to believe that things work as described.

Nope. Don't do that. It's there for a reason. The trick is, do you have the
right warmup regulator for your fuel distributor? And secondly, is it working
right? 

By the way, if he's offering to do that, TAKE THE CAR TO SOMEONE ELSE. He
obviously doesn't understand what he's doing on your CIS. Not to worry, 
most people don't. But still, it's criminal to pay someone to knowingly
fuck up your car.

Unfortunately, my limited experience has been that the water pump fails at some
entirely random point in the 944's lifetime.  It may fail at 10K miles, it may
last till 80K miles.  There is an updated design, but I have not heard it said,
one way or the other, that the new design is less prone to failure.

The problem is that you're not getting enough gas for the load on
the engine. Load in this case is measured by the CIS system in terms of 
temperature and manifold pressure. The key elements are measurements
at the warmup regulator and metering at the fuel distributor.

Trouble shooting this takes roughly forever, because it typically won't
reproduce itself at idle in a shop, and requires either luck or a 
chassis dyno so you can make it happen under controlled conditions.
The method involves using a high-pressure fuel pressure guage and a 
fairly complex set of plumbing. Most of the aftermarket guys (Automotion,
Performance Products, etc.) sell the setup for about $120 or so.
In case you're able to scare up all the right tools, and a factory manual,
what you're looking for is discontinuities in the pressure curve under
load -- particularly between 3 and 5K RPM, when you depress the accellerator
further. What part of the pressure path you see the discontinuity in
will indicate which piece is probably broken.

Typical causes: bad fuel pressure regulator, bad "warmup regulator", bad
fuel pump (i.e. can't make enough pressure at the high end), bad fuel
distributor (often clogged distribution slots in the flow control plunger),
bad injector(s) (often just one or two, but it makes a difference).

Due to the failure mode, most places won't even attempt to really diagnose
the problem, but will replace the warmup regulator as a matter of course. If
that doesn't work, they usually shoot for the fuel distributor. By this time,
you're into them for say $1200 or so and may be reluctant to take the car
elsewhere. So on it goes....

One other thing: it is possible to adjust the CO mixture to about 5% on non-
Lambda cars, and very slightly retard the timing to keep this from being
a problem on the street. For Lambda cars, this doesn't work, and if you
autocross or track the car, you still have to be careful or you'll overload
the engine and it will be back. Pinging in an aircooled engine is a serious
problem, unlike a US cast-iron V8 or something. If you hear pinging, take
your foot off the gas -- right then.

I picked it up about a week later, paid $165 and appear to have solved fuel

they cut open the tank in several places, grit blast the interior (after

then coat the interior and oven bake the tank to cure the coating.

they also repaint/coat the tank exterior. it  all seems to work quite well

He helped me evaluate 911s and steered me away from four or five

Subject: 928 Brake Pressure Light

Help!

I'm going nuts trying to find the source of a warning system error.
I have a 79 928 and the "Brake Pressure" warning light keeps coming
on.  This is of the flashing variety and can't be cleared until you
disconnect the ground strap under the tool kit.  Now, more often than
not, it ALSO requires that you mash the brake pedal a few times to
reset the pressure switch (and by mash I mean put your foot through the
firewall!)

As I understand it, there is a switch that senses the pressure
differential between the two braking systems and warns the driver if
the pressure isn't equal on both sides.  It's a sort of "toggle"
switch wherein a finger gets pushed to one side if the pressure is
off.  This switch has a long history of failures and the first thing
to do when encountering this problem is to replace the switch.  
Another failure mode is that there is air in the lines and one side
compresses while the other side doesn't, triggering the switch.

I've replaced the switch and bled the brakes twice, and the problem
seems to be getting worse.  There's no pattern to when it trips,
sometimes during hard braking, other times with just a light tap.

Can anyone out there offer any advice?


While I'm at it, I also have two other questions concerning the
brake portion of the warning system.  How do the brake pad and stop
lamp warnings work and what makes them come on (aside from starting the
car before you first tap the brakes)?

Thanks in advance

Tell me more!  I need to strip my '73 914 -- it has a really shitty, ugly
paint job over the beautiful original paint.  Is this something I should
consider?  What is "strip-away" exactly, where can I get it, what does it
cost, what does it involve, how does it work, etc....

I've found a place that will bead-blast the car for about $400 -- bead
blasting seems preferable to sandblasting or hand-sanding, and is probably
preferable to chemicals too.  Any opinions there?  I plan on completely
removing the trim, windshield, rear window, gaskets, etc before stripping.

Beadblasting is beneficial for small corners, seams, and otherwise
unaccessable areas. It is detrimental to sheet-metal body and exterior parts
due to the shot-peening effect that ends up warping the sheet-metal.

Not being a ba.native, I can't answer the last part, but Garretson's disappeared
about 5 months ago. IRS problems, mainly. The IMSA team I participate in
just missed getting all of the remaining G-series camshafts before seizure.
The truck with our parts and several other items of interest forgot something
and went back to the shop, where it was impounded. I hope they found
good homes 8{(. Garrettson's will be missed.

On to the other point: despite a good reputation, a friend of mine had
a clutch done under warranty at Carlson's, and they basicly didn't do it
right. Didn't replace obvious stuff, didn't use new parts in places where
you should never re-use the old part given that you've taken it off the
car, etc. In short, the work actually done (or rather, the work that seemed to
have been done on inspection after he had it taken apart to get fixed right)
didn't match the work order or work claimed to have been done. 

As a side note, I'm finding this more and more as other friends who are
had work done other places are switching to this one shop with which I have
a very close association. Many of the other shops in the area are selling
used parts as new, rebuilt parts as original equipment, or charging for
work that is not done (i.e. using carb cleaner to spiff up electrical parts
to that they look new and charging for the work, or using Soft-Scrub to clean
tranny cases to let them claim to be new or re-built, etc.)

Be *SURE* you can trust your mechanic. The more ways I learn to fake work,
the more scared I get....

The only thing I've found that works is something called Soft-Strip, which is
a franchise operation. It does however take it right down to the metal. If
you think about it, it's hard to build a chemical that eats so many mils
of paint then stops....

DON'T DO IT!!!! Ghost Racing has two 914/6's and a regular 914 2.0 which have
recently been done. We didn't take the enging out of the 2.0 or one of
the /6's and are now in the process of re-building them. Beads aren't as
bad as sand, but they get just everywhere. Even in the oil. NOT good.
The other /6 was fully stripped, no interior, no drive train, etc -- just
a roller. We got to replace all the bearings and rebuild the calipers
after that -- sand in the brake fluid -- ick!

The right thing is probably to either fully strip the car to nothing but a 
roller then soft-strip it, or trim-strip it and take it to a reasonably
competent body shop for sanding to the metal then re-painting. Paint is
one of those places where there just aren't any short cuts.

Having recently had a new CD/Tuner installed in the Carrera 4 I noticed
stickers *everywhere* saying not install non-Porsche telephone
equipment at the risk of electrical interference.  Before getting the
car kit for my Mitsubishi MT5, I checked with the local Porsche garage
(Chariots, St Albans, UK) and talked to their telephone installation

and I could fit my MT5 or indeed just about any car-phone on the market
without worry, and without voiding my warranty.

Subject: High Volume Low Pressure painting systems -questions


  Greetings netters:
     I will soon be shooting paint upon my beloved 914 and i am curious about
   the latest in paint technology.  I will be using Glasurit 21 glasodur
   L-32-K urethane acrylic.  In the documentation i see a gravity feed gun,
   John Paterek uses these in his shop and claims he uses only paint and
   activator with no thinner.  He says thinners cause most paint failures.
      Anybody got experience with this?

     On a related thread; has anyone got experience with the HVLP (high volume
   low pressure) painting equipment?  I understand that these generate air
   pressure at 5 to 10 psi at 60 to 100 cfm.  The larger cfm are for thicker
   paints.  These are claimed to produce a transfer efficiency of ~80%, as
   compared to ~40% on older tech systems.  Do these improve the chances of
   success and reduce chances for maladies?

Subject: You and RFI, EMC (electro-magnetic-crabbbiness)


  RFI:
       I was wondering when this was going to come up...
    The fact that Zuffenhausen is prohibiting use of certain electronic gear
   is evidence there is a problem.  I do EMC work (among other things here)
   and it was tough proving to managment here that it was safer to design-in
   EMI and RFI controls than try to 'patch' the system after its built.
    A damn sight cheaper too.
    This makes me wonder what emission signature the recent Porsches portray.
    Since what goes out can also get in.  The term for this is "radiated
    susceptibility"

   Considering this is Germany we are dealing with, I find this extremely
   disconcerting.  Mostly because the krauts have the tightest EMC regulations
   in the world! (the VDE)  They are pissing us off, they have to be....
   Our own FCC wont even let you sell a product that does'nt meet or exceed
   emission limits, conducted or radiated.

   This kind of work (EMC) is sort of like black magic, partly why I like it
   so much.
   I think it funny that some folks out there are radiating tens of watts of
   RF from a mobile, these are probably ham's so they should already know
   about shielding.  Perhaps they modified their ride so 'keying up' doesnt
   disrupt anything.  A retrofit to any model could be made to 'radiation-
   proof' for any type of electronic gear, the only problem is it requires
   a couple million $ worth of calibrated gear to test.  Otherwise you get
   to play trial and error.  PCNA's behavior is similar to our product
   designers; well, just tell them not to do that (until we get a fix).


   Its a good thing that most of the nuclear powers have agreed to stop
   testing bombs in the air- an EMP pulse would kill all non-rad-hardened
   electronic gear within at least 300 miles of ground (space) zero.  That
   means
   all cars with electronic anything are dead too.  We better hope that
   saddam and the mad iraqi's dont get the nuke...

Subject: RE: paint stripper (advised methods)


  <Kyle sez;>
                In response to the threads about stripping paint from a body,
   I would like to share my general (researched) methods.
   
   According to Bob and Bill Jones (and John Paterek), chemical stripping is
   by far less intrusive and damaging to your car's body.  Blasting should be
   reserved for only the most difficult areas, even then the blast media will
   entrain itself in the body and must be removed using a variety of methods.
   Dipping for stripping is decidedly bad for any future coatings as the stuff
   remains in the body seams and will leach out when you least need it.
     This is one instance where there are no short-cuts if you want a 'right'
   job done, brush application of the stripper followed by scraping with a
   putty knife and or scrubbing with steel wool.  Another valuable aid is a
   DOTCO with 3M scotchbrite cookies -medium to fine will leave your bare
   metal shiny.  All this is so much easier with your car mounted to a 
   ROTISSERIE!... 
   Leave the blaster for the last, and then use it sparingly, i use a rag to
   psuedo-contain the blast.

   Chemical strippers;  strip-eez automotive grade will do a fine job.
    <i wound up using Eastwood's Aircraft grade @ $75/4 gal.>
   Multiple applications may be neccessary to remove several layers of paint
   putty, or primer/filler.  Stripper compounds contain methyl chloride and or
   methyl alcohol as active ingredients and will soften the asphalt sound
   absorption pads.  I found this to be a boon because i found rust under
   them, and removing with a torch really makes a sooty mess.
  
   Hazards;  This generates toxic waste and must be disposed of properly.
             The fumes are bad for you, but not deadly.
             Dry sanding creates toxic dusts.
             The stripper is caustic to skin.
 
   My application is specifically to restore a rusty 914, i firmly believe
   in completely dismantling the car- to less than a roller in efforts to
   annihilate all rust.  (for now anyway)
   The factory really did a marvelous job painting these bodies, in some
   places it seems like they dipped 'em in paint.  But after being inside
   the inner sanctums, I can testify this is not the case.

I quit using Chevron a long time ago because they had a red dye in it
that would clog/gum up my carb in my mustang (I did my own maint
then, this was the '70s).  Is it dye-less today?  Here in Calif Chevron 
is NOT a "green" company according to all the press from the environmental
people although if they had a better product then BP or U76 I'd probably use
it.

While I'm on "myths", I also heard in the '60s from a Porsche owner
that worked in the Standard Oil of Ind chem labs that Shell was
dangerous to Porsche alloy engines at the time.  What does anyone know
of Shell gas today?  Any tear down experience, what does the inside of
an engine look like after running a particular gas for a while?

Out here in Calif, ARCO is rumored to have the cleanest gas, but I've
been runing BP, Union76, and a little Shell with seemingly OK results.

	In the UK, Porsche Cars GB actively recommend Shell petrol ("gas").
According to a recent article in one of the car magazines, the detergents
which Shell add to all their petrols (unleaded, leaded and super unleaded)
are better than those which any other company use.

	Shell had an advert in Porsche Post (the Porsche Club GB
equivalent of Panorama) showing a 911 at a Shell pump under the heading
"Porsche recommend Shell detergents in their front loaders" [pun on washing
machines, in case the terminology doesn't travel across the pond].

	At the time (a couple of months ago) I rang both Shell and Porsche
Cars GB and they confirmed that Porsche Cars GB are recommending the
stuff. Also, when I was in a 968, the under-bonnet ("hood") sticker said
something about the car being filled with Shell lubricants from the
factory.

	I was also told by Porsche Cars GB that my '86MY 944 could run on
super unleaded (98 octane) without modification, as it needed the higher
octane of leaded petrol (97 octane) but *not* the lead as lubricant. I
could only use unleaded (95 octane) if I got mt timing adjusted, but would
suffer loss of performance. I have now switched to Shell super unleaded,
but still use Shell leaded about every 4th tank, just in case!

I was hoping someone else would answer this, but since it's been a few
days, I'll take a shot at it and hope my memory is correct.

I just had the brake pads in my 944 (951) changed a few months ago. The
mechanic showed me how the warning light wouldn't be triggered until
the pads were *this close* to being totally gone. As I recall, there's
a thin piece of metal near the bottom of the pad lining that becomes
exposed when the pad wears and makes contact with a wire that leads to
the warning light. He said at that point, there's a good chance of the
rotors being scored. I.e., don't wait that long to replace the pads.

While looking for a place to have the brakes changed, I called one guy
who said, sort of sneeringly, "Why would you want to change the pads if
the light hasn't come on yet?" I took the car elsewhere. I don't believe
in doing unnecessary work on the car, but I also don't care for the
idea of creating problems by putting things off.

Subject: Re: Porsches and RFI

I'm a little surprised by George A. LocCascio's vague letter to the AARL.  To
the contrary, Porsche has recently published two bulletins aimed at helping
install aftermarket equipment and diagnose problems.  I have a great deal of
sympathy for Porsche and PCNA in this matter.  Porsche builds a first rate
electrical system (my opinion) in their cars.  I have seen any number of
absolutely awful accessory installations in Porsches: loose and/or unsheathed
wires in the engine bay, splice connectors, vinyl tape, lousy crimps... blech.

Tech bulletin Group X, No. 9104, dated 10 Sept 91 is a litany against poor
aftermarket installations.  I think PCNA is simply trying to, quite reasonably,
protect themselves from warranty claims brought about because of poorly
installed aftermarket systems.

Tech bulletin Group 9, No. 9003, issued 22 June 1990, gives detailed
instructions on how to install telephones in Carrera 2 and 4, 85-1/2-forward 944
series, and 928S4 and GT models.  They show where to mount the equipment and how
and where to hook it into the CEB.

Missing is a catalogue of available connector parts, notably the odd ones used
in the CEB plugs.  I think Porsche or PCNA would do themselves a great favour in
publishing a guidebook to CEB theory, practice, and parts.  I've educated myself
here by exploring, gleaning bits from other tech bulletins, and having a patient
and persistant parts man who's made a number of calls to Reno in search of
ordering information.

I think most of the discussion so far on this topic has related to
the risk that the RF emissions from the radio equipment will affect the
operation of the car. The opposite direction, where the car affects
the radio, is a well studied problem. For CB, most of the ham radio
wisdom should be applicable, and there are lots of reference books.
On your particular (apparent) problem of commutator noise from the
small fan motor, I would try an RF bypass capacitor with short leads
directly across the motor terminals.

You are welcome to try your radio in my car, but from my experience this
sort of thing varies from car to car and also with time, so checking
another car (or buying a new motor) may not solve anything.

A couple of other places didn't have a pump for a pre "S"

Went for the Stoddard pump, had it 14 hrs later via UPS next day air. $25 extra.
Used the opportunity to get some little bits and pieces only 
a dealer would have.

PLUG ON: Stoddard has always been suberb to deal with and I always
         call them. In most cases they get the business.
PLUG OFF;

I haven't found a shop manual set I can afford so I used a cheapo
Haynes book for pointers: 
"Remove all brackets and hoses obstructing" covers quite a bit more
than one would suspect...
They left out the fact you have to pull the harmonic balancer to get the
pump out - not a difficult job - also allows replacing the timing belt,
which I did.  The balancer is not pressed on so a little judicious pulling
gets it off easily.

I haven't tried this before, so no idea of correct form, etc.  My problem is
with a 3/4 to full tank of gas in my '81 924 if the car is on a slope so the
passenger side is somewhat lower than the driver side, the gas tank leaks.  It
clearly comes from the top of the tank and not the fill-tube.  Is there anyway
to work on this short of dropping the whole rear-end?  
I have a friend with a later 944 and he says he observes the same problem. 
Thanks for your help.  TJ

Hurf -

The 928 wheels you describe, p/n 928.362.115.00/01, are 7x16" rims with a 65.0
mm. offset.  The '87-forward 944-series cars came with rims having a 52.3 mm.
offset.  So you may have a clearance problem with these wheels, esp. in the
front.

Patty -

The pad wear indicators you describe are sacrificial.  That is, if the light
comes on, you have to replace not only the pad but also the wear indicator.  I
would replace the pads before then, because

 a) who want's to pay for the silly indicator, and
 b) if you do track events, having at least 50% pad depth is both safer and
    dissipates heat better.

Ah, by "artwork off the mound," they must be referring to my splendid driving
over last weekend's three days at Watkins Glen.  Where I happily achieved a
no-hitter of a slightly different, but just as pleasing kind!  Truth be told,
this guy's got five years on me.  And I've never been to LA.

And while on the subject, I was working pit-out at the Glen when the course was
red-flagged.  Next thing I heard was that the ambulence was underway.  You know
how that feels, esp. when we had no idea what had happened to whom.  Turns out
they had to transport one of the professional flaggers who work the Glen to the
hospital.  We never found out why, but it had nothing to do, so far as anyone
knows, with cars on the course.  Very strange experience.

Subject: Re: Gas Tank Leak

First thing I'd do would be to pin down the source of the leak.

Most of the fuel system is pressurized to 3+ bar.  If there is leaking induced
by car position, it is almost certainly from the tank or filler.  (Something
else could be really messed up in an extreme case, of course.)  As Gary
suggested, looking at the fuel level sender is the first step, since it's easily
accessible.

It may be that your fuel pump or hoses to it are leaking.  Fuel may be
accumulating in its shroud, and spilling when the car is parked on an angle. 
The pump is under the gas tank and accessible from under the car.

I would next look at the filler neck, expansion tank, and related hoses.  I've
never gone digging here.  According to the wkshp manual, part of the multi-step
process of getting to it involves removing the right rear window.  I hope it
doesn't come to this for you!

Last spring I posted a question I had about my car (early '83 
944, 30K miles) and its problem with overheating (on long uphill 
stretches on warm days). Well, I had a new radiator put in it 
this spring and have finally tested it to my satisfaction. I can 
say that the fix solved the problem. The new radiator is an 
updated design, a bit thicker than the old one.

I just returned from California, a 2000 mile trip, and the car 
never ran much above where the thermostat opens in spite of long 
grades (some fairly steep) and 100+ outside temperatures. Of 
course the air conditioning was going all the time too. I did 
notice that running on flat ground the engine seemed to run 
cooler at speeds over 80 than under 80 (that was on a track, of 
course :-).

On my next trip I'll put the bra on the car and see if it stays 
cool.

You have to remove the window because they tuck the upholstery for the
interior panel under the rubber gasket for the window.  You won't be
able to remove the filler tube shroud without removing this part of the
interior.  Not a fun job.  I went through this process once when I
installed new speakers in the rear.  I bet the leak is from the vent
hose near the filler tube or the filler tube, both on the passenger
side.

Here we go again ....!!
Noise is coming from rear left wheel. Mechanic says it is a wheel bearing
problem. I did an initial inspection with the following scaring findings:
  - Wheel is not very stable. I can move it slightly along its vertical axis.
    When I move the wheel, the drive shaft moves also.
  - The noise is very noticeable when making turns (sounds like a group of
    high-speed ducks is following me). It is also noticeable when I slowly
    decelerate at low speeds, until full stop.
    
If it really a bearing problem, which one is at fault? I think my car
(87 951) has a big bearing (referred as inclined bearing) and a smaller one.

Christopher,

It is certainly possible in so far as you could go out and buy all the parts,
new or used.  As a practical matter, the cost of new parts would be prohibitive.
For that matter, finding and installing used parts would be an immense pain as
well.  If you really, really just had to have ABS, you would probably be better
off selling your current S and buyimg another that came with ABS.

In shooting the breeze recently with an '87 944S owner who has ABS (Bill
Gilbert), he mentioned that very few dealer cars came through with ABS that
year.

Subject: Re: Noise in rear whell

Tassos -

There is a single, rather large rear wheel bearing in 944-series cars, at least
the 85-1/2-forwards.  (Dunno about the earlier ones but expect the same to be
true.)  It is pressed into a heated control arm, retained by a circlip.

Sounds like you know which side is bad.  I am not an expert in these matters. 
But if you have significant play in the bearing, I would replace it ASAP.

In general, you can diagnose which side has the bad bearing by loading it up. 
Driving spiritedly down a stretch of road, rock the car from side to side.  Nine
times out of ten, the loaded side will exhibit the noise.  You can apparently be
fooled once in a blue moon - the unloaded side may in fact be the bad one. 
(This wisdom from my mechanic when we replaced one of my bearings over last
winter.)

The noise, at least in my case, was not unlike tire howl.  The giveaway that it
was indeed a bearing-on-a-short-string was the rocking test, which quieted
things down on one side but not the other.

	The following is reproduced (without permission) from _Autocar &
Motor_ dated 19 August, 1992. The heading is "Porsche to kill off 968?" -
my comments are in [square brackets].


Porsche will kill the 968 next year if new, cheaper versions don't halt an
apalling decline in sales.

The lower-cost 968 coupe and cabriolet models will be launched in October
at the Paris show.

Porsche is looking to knock 3,500 off the price (DM10,000 is the official
target) by scrapping luxury items such as electric seats and windows and
the cabriolet's power roof. That should reduce the price of a 968 to less
than DM80,000 in Germany. For the UK, that could mean a 968 coupe for
28,300 [you can currently get a 944 for about 27,000].

Sales of the 968 have never reached Porsche's projections, despite heavily
reduced prices in the US, the car's most important market outside Germany.

In the US, sales of the 968 for the first six months of 1992 totalled 552
cars, compared with 477 sales of 944s in 1991 and 1346 in 1990.

When the 968 was launched, Porsche predicted production levels of 33 to 35
cars per day, but when the Zuffenhausen factory went back to work on 10
August after the summer holidays, 968s were coming off the line at the
rate of only 30 per month [sic].

At their peak, in September/October 1985, 944 production reached 152 cars
per day, although this declined to 44 a day by mid 1990. Porsche believes
the extra 3500 the 968 cost compared with the 944 in Germany and the UK
is the main reason for plunging sales since the 968 was launched a year
ago.

Potential buyers weren't fooled by Porsche's claims that the 968 was a new
car, realised it was a facelifted 944 and stayed away in droves.

So unless there's an immediate upturn in demand after the cheap 968 is
introduced, Porsche insiders predict the four-cylinder model will be
replaced by yet another version of the classic rear-engined 911 late next
year.

It could happen even sooner than that. One source inside Zuffenhausen
says: "The 968 could be dead in a couple of months; it's out of our hands
now."

The entry-level 911 would cost DM90,000 in Germany (about 32,000 in the
UK).

It will be powered by a 3.2-litre variant of the flat six and will exclude
expensive equipment such as anti-lock brakes and a driver's airbag from
its standard specification.

By comparison, the cheapest current 911, the Carrera 2, costs 48,311 in
the UK or DM119,120 in Germany.

Sales are down so much that Porsche is believed to be losing money,
despite lay-offs and short working weeks that reduced the break-even point
to less than 25,000 cars per year.

[For comparison, UK1 is about US$2 currently. Also, the same issue of
Autocar has an article about "The best driver's cars in Britain" in which
they compare the Renault Clio 16v, VW Corrado VR6, Ford Escort RS Cosworth,
Caterham 7 K-series, Porsche 968, Mazda RX-7 and Honda NSX. The concluded
that the NSX was "out on its own" with second place split between the RX-7
and the 968.]

I thought the 968 was a replacement for the 944. Are they really still

	No, but at least in the UK Porsche still have very large stocks of
944s to get rid of. Sales have been very sluggish (the recession is a
major factor - not only can most people not afford an expensive car, but
those who can don't feel it is right to flaunt it. The only plus point is
that used car prices have put some of these cars back into the hands of
the enthusiasts rather than speculators or those who buy the car for the
badge), and I have seen photographs in the press of a huge compound full
of unsold 944s.

	My local dealer is doing a very good price on the 944 (UK27k as
against UK35k or so a while ago) and Porsche Cars GB don't seem to be
pushing the 968 until they get rid of their 944 stocks.

	What this will do to the second-hand market I don't know, but I
wonder if the 968 will end up with collector status as the shortist-lived
production Porsche model :-)

	As Porsche don't seem willing to develop the 944S2/968 into a turbo
version for fear of losing sales of 911s :-(, I wonder whether they will
soon disappear off the planet and Porsche will try to exist as a single
model (911) company?

Sure is tempting to speculate...  I think the net of Arno Bohn's showdown
with the Porsche and Piech families a few months ago would lead me to
guess otherwise.  Briefly, my understanding of their understanding was:

  1. Porsche will not become a boutique company, like (alas) Ferrari.
     They will re-assert themselves in the "low end", if you will, of
     the luxury car market, for now with the 968 and in the next few
     years with its successor (I forget the model number).

  2. The families were once again told to butt out and let the company
     get on with its business, by people who have to work for their
     salary.  (Again, I forget the exact term, but I think it's the
     Management Board as opposed to the Board of Directors.)

The rumor-to-fact ratio runs pretty high.  Some months ago, I heard
through the US dealer network that we could expect to see Mercedes running
Porsche Cars NA within a few days, for example.

The one interesting fact I've learned recently is that Porsche AG is
apparently losing some of the Weissach R&D contract volume which has
supported it so much in the past.

>hurf

There's (was?) an out-and-out Eagle M+S, I went through a set and
have used the GT+4 as well on the same car and a 931 as well.  I'd
say the Eagle M&S is made obsolete by the GT+4, which has rather
good snow and very good wet compared to anything else I've run accross.
Going from P6s to GT+4s on the 931 just transformed it from something
you dared not push into a plaything.


Not that I'm sold on the GT+4, kinda pricy, seem to chunk easily, but
to me wet performance is top priority, you can make good time on
dry pavement with any tire whatsoever.  

Call KT Motorsports in Vorheesville (518 555 1212) and pick their brains,
they might have a good Dunlop rain tire or somesuch.  They might even 
have an applicable Nokia snow or rain tire to get you up and down them 
hills.

It seems to be garge cleaning time at Ghost Racing. Joe Shemenski, the
king of the 914/6s, has finally decided to sell off his non-6 914's and
his autocross 911. If you are interested, give him a call. Be warned:
he's a stock broker by day, and can negotiate the smell off of doggy doo.
He is however fair minded, and pretty motivated to sell, so if you're in
the market, call. If you want more info on the cars first, shoot me a 
note and I'll let you know what the deal is (since I'm 1/4th of Ghost Racing
and know the cars).

1974 914 2.0L. Autocross car, known as "Cone-an" in these parts. Undefeated
in last 12 autocross outings. Prepared to the limits of SCCA SoloII Stock
rules. Solid car, could be daily driver but you might get tired of the
seriously stiff ride. Asking $4500. Engine is in the process of being re-built
even as we speak, so if you want it built differently than stock *this
is an unmatched opportunity to have it your way for VERY small difference
in the price*.

1974 914 2.0 Special Edition. This was an investment car, and he decided 
he'd sat on it long enough. Only will be sold to a good home. Bone stock.
Was getting front motor mounts and a tune up earlier this afternoon.
White with orange trim. I forget the interior color. Has original orange
Mahle "gas-burner" wheels, owners manual, some paperwork. Can be a very
different daily driver, or concours car (after prep, natch). No asking
price, but I know that the market is between $5500 and $7500 on these
cars as they're pretty rare. He'll know that too.

'8? 911. Was Divisional Champ in some East Coast SCCA region in the
F Prepared class. Tubbed cabrio body, single Recaro racing shell, roll
bar and bracing. Lightened to the extreme, 300+ HP 3.6 liter engine
with Webers, on a 915 transmission. I think it's on 9 & 11 by 15 wheels,
with fresh Goodyear slicks. THIS IS NOT A STREET CAR. Blue, with louvered
slope nose and 934-style flares. Not sure what he has in the car, not
sure what is reasonable to offer for it. We have determined that it will
not be readily usable for anything but FP Solo II or GT-1 road racing
(and then you'll need a zillion dollars worth of other stuff to be 
competitive). However, for the *FASTEST* 911 ride of your life, it
can't be beat.

Now, for contact info: Joe Shemenski, (713) 623-7037 work, and
(713) 665-5646 home. This is Central Time, and don't call after
10:00 PM.

I have no financial interest in any of these cars. Let him know
I sent you, though.

Thanks for all the responses re: Shopping for street tires.

I ended up ordering the newer Comp T/A 225/50 ZR 16's @$170 mtd & balanced ea.
Another 928 owner around here had them and was very happy with them. The local
Goodyear guy didn't mentiontion anything but the Eagle GT4 vr's and they were
more $$. 
Will let you know how they do.

Subject: Mail Order Brake Pads

Take this post for what it is worth but I believe the most important
message is buyer beware.

A few weeks ago there was some discussion on the Mustang list about
the "Great New Carbon Kevlar brake pads" that some list members had
used.  After attempting to track down the "Carbon Kevlar" (CK) pads I
wound up going with "Porterfield Racing" they have a full line of
racing brake pads and components from AN hardware to FERODO products.

On August 24th ~8:00 AM PST I called Porterfield racing and asked to
talk to Andy (Who is the owner).  I asked if he had the CK pads for
84-87 Corvette.  He told me he did, I asked him to ship them UPS 2nd
day air as I had an event to run on Thursday Aug 27th, He told me no
problem.  I waited around Wednesday prepping the Vette for the Porsche
Club Drivers' school and to my surprise NO pads.

Thursday came and I was forced to run on my Bendix pads (Not alot of
fun, the 84-87 Vette brakes are marginal for the amount of rubber on
the ground for the weight they must handle).  When I returned from the
school I found the pads at my door.  I opened the box, after closer
inspection of the actual braking surface I saw (2) grooves per pad
which I assume are for letting gasses escape during use.

The groove depths were inconsistent between pads, but that wasn't the
problem.  The problem is that the grooves broke away a fair amount of
brake material from the pad.  In fact, only one of the pad's grooves
had a clean 90 degree cut in them.

To say the least I am not impressed by:

	1. Mr. Porterfield's promptness in shipping (When someone calls 
	you at 8:00AM your local time and requests 2nd day air I would 
	think it would be shipped that day).  

	2. The quality of the product (If these were a set of street
	pads I might accept the poor quality but for racing pads I 
	expect something a bit different).

Prior to purchasing the pads from Porterfield I had heard nothing 
negitive about them, in fact all feedback was positive, including
custom pad services.  Since, I have found another list member who has
had worse service than what I have just described.

I talked to Tim at Porterfield today (8/31/92), he told me that the
pads had to be "custom made" on Monday and that's why they were
shipped on Tuesday.  His explaination for the chips in the pads were:
"That's just the way it is" and followed with: "The decreased surface
area will increase friction and not effect overall pad life".  Why
don't I believe him???  He told he didn't have the authority to do
anything further (Which leads me to believe that this is how they
treat all of their customers) I asked to speak to Andy Porterfield who
took the order.  Of course by now it was not a surprise that he was
unavailable.

In the past I have ordered pads from Performance Friction for my 928
and been very pleased.  I would've gone with PF once again but they do
not offer a pad for the 84-87 Corvette brakes.  I believe my only
solution is to switch to the larger 13" rotors and dual piston
calipers (88-later Z51/Z07 type) and to stick with the Performance
Friction pads.

Finally, could anyone who has received the Carbon Kevlar pads from 
Porterfield relate their experience, good or bad with me directly.

Thanks in advance.
