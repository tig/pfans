Subject: Wheels

I've been bitten hard by the autox/driving school bug. I've decided that
I ought to buy a set of tires and to simplify track preparation, a set
of wheels. I drive an '87 951 (944T) with stock 7x16 and 8x16 phone
dials. These have been pretty majorly scratched up (they're painted! not
anodized...) by a couple of incompetent tire mounts.

I checked into the recent tip about PCNA's wheel blowout, but none of
the sale wheels will fit my car (the 951 club sport wheels would be
great, but they'll only fit '88 and later: apparently they have a
different offset than the earlier cars (aside: what would it take to
modify my car/the wheel to mount these on my car?)) I'd like to use the
phone dials on the car now for the track and get another set (hopefully
more cosmetically durable) for the street.

The local dealer wants to sell me a set of 'used' phone dials for
$250/each. New price (with a PCA discount) is about $310 for the fronts,
$360 for the rears. I haven't seen them, but I suspect they are 'like
new' - he said they were taken off the car at about 2K miles since the
owner wanted BBSs or some such.

What would y'all consider a good deal on a set of decent wheels for the
951? I was hoing to get down into the $150-200 range: can I do that? Can
I do better?

Subject: Polishing Phone Dials

For general information:

I had a set of phone dials, painted and scratched, which were rather
unsightly.  I took them to the shop who does my paintwork, and was
quoted $75 each for sanding, prep, prime and repaint.  

Given that I didn't want to blow the money, I went to True Value and
bought some steel wool (medium, $1.59), some Enhance water soluble fume free
stripper ($5.59) a cheapo paint prush ($.88) and picked up some latex
gloves ($.99).

About 3 hours later, the first wheel was completely stripped and
polished (the steel wool actually gives a relatively scratch free
finish).   Although they do not have a mirror finish they are quite
attractive (better than pain imho) and should be easier to maintain,
with a little vaseline and / or car wax.  The second one took about 4
hours (hands getting tired).

Anyway, I had heard not to use chemical strippers on AL, so I tried it
on a junk wheel first.  There seem to be no detrimental effects.  One
note:  buy LOTS of latex gloves or some chemical proof gloves.  Use
S.O.S. or similar between applications of stripper and as a final polish
as it neutralizes.  It takes almost exactly 1 can of stipper per wheel,
so buy the gallon if you plan on doing a set.  

Two down, two to go!

Steve,

It is possible to install club sport wheels on the earlier cars, but
Porsche expressly advises against it and dealers will not perform the
modification (at least the one I tried to get to do it did not want
take responsibility).  It is clearly best to use wheels that fit the
car without the use of spacers, adaptors and such.  Nevertheless, I so
much prefer the look of the club sport wheel on 944s that I decided to
tackle the job myself on my '86 951.  I have had no problems
whatsoever as a result of having performed this conversion, and the
car really looks great.  Although the procedure described below was a
bit of a hassle, I think it was worth it in the end.

First, I bought four 930 wheel spacers from Automotion and some 72mm
studs.  The 930 spacers are 27mm thick, which, by my computations, is
only a couple of millimeters less than the exact difference in offset.
There is room under the rear quarter panels to increase the track
further with a slightly larger spacer, but this would require the use
of longer studs than the readily-available 72mm I used, and I don't
think it is worth the extra effort.

The 930 hubcentric spacers fit nicely on the rear, but require some
machining to fit the front hubs.  If you are still interested after
reading all of this, I can mail you a picture with dimensions that you
could take to someone with a lathe.  The machining operation is
straightforward, requiring only the inner bore to be increased to
clear the part of the front hub into which the dust cap fits.  Since
you will probably want to remove the front hubs anyway in order swap
the stock studs for the longer ones (I also used the opportunity to
repack the bearings), it would probably be a good idea to haul the
hubs along to the machine shop too just to make sure the spacer does
in fact fit properly.  I ran into a slight problem with the unmachined
parts of the front hubs that needed a little bit of filing down to
allow the spacer to clear (don't mess with the machined parts on which
the wheel is supported, though).  In the end, the modified front
spacers fit as snugly and centered as the rears.

The last trick you need to know is how to install the studs in the
rear hubs.  Because the rear hubs ride in the wheel bearings of the
85.5+ 944s, removing them is (I believe) impossible without pulling
apart the sealed bearing assembly.  This is in contrast to the early
944s on which the rear hubs are splined onto the stub axles and are
relatively easy to take off.  Therefore, it is best to leave the hubs
on the car.  In order to get the old studs out, you will need to
remove the emergency brake shoes.  You will then need to rig up
something to press the studs out, like two C clamps and a metal bar.
The old (shorter) studs can then be wiggled out from behind the hub
flange.  To install the 72mm studs, I had to remove the emergency
brake cable from the trailing arm in order to create enough clearance
to angle the longer studs behind the hub flange (there is a cavity in
which the emergency brake mechanism attaches to the cable that is deep
enough to temporarily accomodate the long stud).  The studs can then
be pulled into the flange with a lug nut.

Good luck,
Milo Dorr

Regarding putting the new style 951S wheels on '87 951's, I have been told that
they fit just fine.  Rich Brekus of Northeast Region picked up a set from Robert
Wood, great price, and apparently has had no problem with them on his 951. 
Charlie Learoyd, 944 person on National Tech Committee, knows Rich and his car
and can be contacted to comfirm the fit.  Yes, there is a tech bulletin which
says not to do this.

This is for an '87-forward car, note.  The '87 cars (and forward) have a 52.3
rim offset front and rear.  The 951S wheels have a 65 mm offset on the 7x16
fronts and a 60 mm offset on the 9x16 rears.  Ie, real close and probably not a
problem.  The old rule of thumb, which I think still stands, is that you want
the height of the lug bolt/lug nut grip to be no less than 1.5 times the lug
bolt diameter.

As Milo notes, the '86 and earlier cars have a different suspension, different
rim offsets, and a history of spacers and 911 wheel swaps.  A lot of this wheel
stuff is ultimately empirical, which means find someone who's done it before!

You can get the dinged telephone dials repainted.  There is a tech bulletin
describing the painting process, very simple and with products specified, which
I could forward to you or your body shop.  The folks I patronize here did a set
for a friend a few years ago and they looked just fine.  The work was easy and
they were a little unsure what to charge the guy!  They have a very hard
(Imron-like) clear-coat which they used on my car and it has been very durable. 
The wheel-well lips they shot with it have stood up extremely well to winter
abuse, better than the original paint I think.  I expect they used it on my
friend's rims.

If the curb damage is any more than superficial (ie, goes into metal), you may
be better off letting Robert Wood do the work for you instead.  He is,
apparently, willing and able to clean up aesthetic metal damage.  He will not
weld or otherwise repair wheels which are, in his opinion, too damaged to safely
repair.

Ruf will also do this kind of repair work.  A friend had a set of messed-up Ruf
(ie, Speedline) 17" rims done through Exclusive in NJ.  I don't know who really
did the work, and I don't know whether they're interested in non-Ruf wheels, but
you might call them and ask.

Another alternative, depending on your budget, is to leave the scratched up
'phone dials as-is for competition use, and get a nice set in whatever style you
like for those evenings on the town.  Me, I wear my forged alloys on the track
and keeps the telephone dials for town and poor weather.  I guess that shows my
priorities...

Hi folks,

(good or bad) or any alternative suggestions ?  I have also read that some
steel pattern exchangers have welds inside the heat exchanger box itself and
that these may not be 100% gas tight - any comments (I may have to get a steel

Ah... You too, eh? I got bitten recently at a CVR track event
at Lime Rock. However, my requirements are slightly different.
I have an '88 951S, so the car is slightly different. I cannot
afford new rims, so I'm more curious as to which kind of tires
would be good on the track but passable on the road, too. I have
heard that Yokohama makes a certain kind that's pretty good.

May I recommend (as I was recommended by many people) that you 
get rid of your stock brake pads? Apparently these do not transmit
heat too well and can warp your rotors. A brand "Frodo" or something
like that was recommended to me.

Any other suggestions, anyone?

Well, I'm not sure I can either, but it doesn't hurt to shop around. All
the hot drivers at last weeks autocross were driving on Yokohama 008Rs.
Everyone was very excited about a new tire just out: the 008RS or 008S
(? they were just calling them 'S').  Someone said he picked up a set
mail order for about $85/each and they're supposedly 'even better' than
the 'R'. These are probably the tires I'll end up with - I just hate to
tear up my street Potenzas at $180 a pop. The reason I'm considering
wheels too is that my painted phone dials were badly scratched up last
time I mounted tires - I'd like to minimize the chance for that
happening again. Steve Timmins' suggestion re: stripping the paint and
polishing the aluminum is tempting. I may convince myself to try it.

Everything I heard said that there were two things you should do ASAP
if you plan to track your car regularly (which I must admit I do plan
to within the limits of my finances). First, they said, change your brake
pads. You apparently have to get a set of pads which transmit heat to
the brake calipers really well, and in order to do that they are generally
made out of much harder or metal-containing material. As I said, they
mentioned a "Frodo" (or something like that) that they recommend. They
(my they's are generic to people I met at the track) recommended as well
to consider some sort of method of cooling the brakes even more. Something
like a vent that goes from that small little hold in front of your front
wheels on a 951 to point it directly at the brake rotor or something. I'm
not sure, and that was of secondary importance. The breaks do get REALLY
hot. Remember NOT to engage your parking brake after coming off the track...
That'll ruin your rotors too!

Anyway the other thing they mentioned would make a big difference was putting
on new rubber... So, I'm going to get rid of my Eagles and put on something
that is passable on the street. I don't drive my car much due to school... It
sits in the garage weekdays without use.

Of course not... Need that be said?

Okay, those of you who have the autocross bug, listen up.

Tires: There are currently two major selections - the Yokohama A008RS and
the BFGoodrich Comp T/A R1.  You can't go wrong with either of these tires.
I use the BFGoodrich for a number of reasons, which I won't go into here,
but the Yoko is also an excellent tire.

Some quick words on the Yokohama line of competition tires: the A008RS, new
this season, replaces the A008RTU, which replaced the A008R a year and half
ago.  Also last year, the A001R was discontinued.

The BFG Comp T/A R1 is new this year, too; BFG has two compounds - the 204
is the high-heat compound for track use, and the 206 is the low-temp
compound for autocrossing.  The 204 will also work well for autox, and is
probably comparable to the A008RS.

Bridgestone and Hoosier also make reasonable tires for this sort of use.
Goodyear and General have made stabs at it, but have not really come too
close.

It's worthwhile to have a second set of wheels with your competition tires
mounted.  It's a significant initial expense, but it pays off in the long
run (competition tires are cheaper, and your street tires don't get chewed
up so much and still work well in the rain).  Not to mention that the
difference in handling and braking with competition tires is *AMAZING* -
it's just lots more fun on sticky rubber.

Ferodo would be the company you're thinking of.  A word of wisdom - these
high-heat brake pads don't work very well for autocrossing.  They're a must
for the racetrack, though.  For autocrossing, use stock pads.  Your brakes
just don't get hot enough to make the race pads work well.

Always a new question:

A 1977 924 is getting:

How's everybody else doing?  More directly, I'm getting on my '84  
944:

15 mpg city - tiny city averaging 10 minute driving time :-( I know I  
	know...
23 mpg hwy - I rarely get a full tank of highway.

How's that?  It's been consistent for a long while though I noticed a  
slow drop to these levels about 6 months after coming to this little  
city 2.5 years ago.

Since I don't know how to drive fast (yeh, yeh I know what a waste to have a
89' 951S), I tried to achieve another record: highest mpg per full tank.
So far - 26.3 mpg, and that was taken shortly before the 15,000 tune up, and
of course 95% of the driving was done on the freeway.

I haven't tried to take the measurement since the tune up.

Talking about the side effect from not knowing how to drive fast, I don't
see why tires need to be changed every 10-15K miles.  Mine with 20,000 miles on
them look like new to me.

Tsk tsk tsk!!!  Sounds like a candidate for immediate enrollment into  
the nearest auto-x school.  You'll find that your 951 doesn't even  
feel right unless it's running around 4-5k rpm (at least that's what  
it is for me, in my ancient 944 so I imagine it's a little broader  
for you) then the mix of power and control really start to mean  
something.  Just make a rule not to shift into fourth or fifth gear  
and you'll get a new appreciation for your car. :-)

Consider this a very light light light flame...  I'm certain that  
your "waste" puts the shudders in a couple of people out there like  
myself.  I'll give you some lessons if you want, free of charge :-)

I'm getting roughly :

         28 mpg hwy  - I do mostly hwy driving  (without a/c)
         23 mpg city - again without a/c.

on my '86 944T.  But as summer is rapidly approaching, I will have to
start using the a/c again shortly... <sigh>

I have been having pretty damn good luck with the Repcos on 951S brakes.
Concidering $33 a set and $28 a set (F/R) they stop pretty damn good.

This is track usage.  I'm not a slug on the brakes either.

I have heard nothing but good things about the SSI heat exchangers.  But I drive
a water-cooler, and observe from that remove.  I know Bruce Anderson likes 'em.

Avoid any heat exchangers with welds inside the boxes!  A very few early 911's
had them, and any leak can easily be literally fatal.  I read a piece last year
about a UK driver who passed out at the wheel because of the carbon monoxide.  I
cannot imagine any reputable part being on the market these days with this
misdesign.  Ie, if it has it, it's a cheap knock-off.

Steve and Doug,

The pads you refer to are Ferodo DS-11's.  You can get 'em for 951 and 951S cars
(and I would assume the 944S2 since they have 951 brakes), but not for 944 or
944S.  These pads are NOT suitable for street use, because they must be warmed
up before they start gripping.  

The brake cooling kit is the Holbert Cool-Brake now being sold by Bob Russo.  I
don't know anyone else who sells such a kit for 944-series cars.  There are a
number of suppliers for 911-series cars, for example, Alan Johnson Racing.  The
Holbert kit is a bear to install, and was IMHO not a very well made thing.  I
can send you soft copy of an article I wrote on the subject a couple of years
ago.  It is indeed worth it if you need it.

If you're new to track events, you really don't have to get DS-11's or a
Cool-Brake to go faster or have fun.  You can wait until the symptoms arise with
your stock set-up: pedal fade, glazing, warping.  Your instructor can point it
out to you when it happens.  Of course, once you've warped your rotors it is a
little late...

The tires are Yokohama A008RS', and if you can get a set of 245/45 x 16's, CALL
ME COLLECT RIGHT AWAY: 617 621 0095!!!  I have been trying to get them ever
since Tech Tactics, but Yoko is, as far as I can tell, jerking people around as
they did last year.  Folks are living off of last years A008RTU's and random
A008R's left in stock.

(and faster), and safely explore the handling of your Porsche:
try an autocross (especially if your area has an beginner's autocross
school, which many areas offer early in the year).  It's cheap
(you can graduate to $1000 track courses with Bob Bondurant later),
and a lot of fun!

Subject: oversize wrist pin bushings

One of the connecting rods from the 356 engine I am working on has a spun
wrist pin bushing.  My machinist said he doesn't have any over-size
bushings, and he says the hole in the rod is about .001" oversize as a
result of spinning.  The old bushing is loose enough that it can be pushed
out or back in by hand.  He said he can make a new bushing which will
custom-fit.  The cost would be ~$30.

Is this the way to go?  Are there premanufactured oversize rod bushings
available?

Subject: PAP

I've had problems ordering from PAP - am I the only one?

Specifics: I ordered several items, one of which was not in the package,
but was billed anyway.  When I called to report the missing item, they
said just add it on to the next order - we won't bill you for it.  The
missing item was a $3.50 valve cover gasket, so I was not too worried.

The next time I ordered, I mentioned that I had been shorted, explained
what I had been told, the salesman said no problem.  The order arrived 
without the missing item.  At that point I didn't feel like making an issue
out of it.

Last week I called to check a price for a pressure plate, and was quoted
$80.  I called back and placed the order, along with 8 valve springs
and some bearings.  This time I was quoted $115 for the pressure plate.
I mentioned the previous quote, and the salesman said "I can live with
that."  The order arrived without the pressure plate and with used,
rusty (!) valve springs, at $5 each.  Boy, was I mad.  They agreed to
take the valve springs back, and issue a credit, but the salesman
insisted he had said used valve springs when I placed the order.  He
didn't see anything wrong with sending rusty valve springs!  I asked 
about the pressure plate, and he said they don't back order.  The
price was $115.  It was in stock.  After some pointed discussion, he
agreed to send it for $80.  It remains to be seen if it will arrive.

I'm getting 20mpg (about 75% hwy, 25% city) in my 1980 928, with 77,000.

Strictly hwy has yielded 23mpg. Strictly insane driving yields about 10mpg!

Subject: Tech Tactics XI
Message-Id: <95910405020059/0004056890NB1EM@mcimail.com>

At the suggestion of Chris Welty, here's a copy of an article I wrote for the
Northeast Region's newsletter on Zone 1's Tech Tactics XI, held a month ago. 
For those of you silly enough not to be PCA members (hi Paul!), Zone 1 covers
all of the top right corner of North America.  Tech Tactics is a week-end affair
much like the longer-extant War Bonnet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tech Tactics XI                                       Kevin Gross

Each spring for the last eleven years, Zone 1 has hosted a week-
end get-together known as Tech Tactics.  From Friday evening
through Sunday afternoon, several hundred PCA'ers spend time
talking about all manner of Porsche-related things.  This year,
saw a very large contingent of Northeast folk in attendance, too
many to list here.

It became apparent last year that we had outgrown the Enfield,
Conn. Harley Hotel, and so the site was moved this year to the
Springfield Sheraton at Monarch Place, right in the downtown.
This change turned out very well.  The hotel is much larger, and
the rooms are nice.  It has a few restaurants of its own and,
because it's right in Springfield, there are a number of good
restaurants within walking distance.

Four tire companies sponsored different parts of the week-end:
Yokohama, B.F. Goodrich, Pirelli, and Bridgestone.  With the slow
economy these days, tire companies are being a lot more selective
in their promotions.  We must be doing something right to get all
four of them.  Yokohama got us off to a start by sponsoring a
hospitality suite Friday evening, complete with a fine selection
of German beers and wines, and assorted munchies.

Saturday morning started with a talk by John Paterak on
"Streetwise: Preparation for the Boston concours (street class)."
Sort of.  A big part of John's talks always covers what products
and processes he's discovered over the last twelve months.  He
started with a long list of advice on preparing your cars for
concoursing (you had to be there...).  For example, you should
avoid overdoing polishing of engine parts such as the 911 series'
fans, which come rough from the factory.  He recommends Wurth's
HS 2000 for lubricating hood latches and doors, since it can be
directed and dries to a gel.  Do lubricate things - you'll lose
points if a dry latch won't open and your trunk cannot be
inspected!  And, of course, clean everything and everywhere,
especially behind the gas pedal (right, Alex?).

John's product picks include 3M Imperial Hand Glaze, which he
recommends for polishing.  It works especially well on black
cars.  Check your progress with a spot light or a flash light,
which will show scratches and swirls better than fluorescents.
Put the glaze onto a 100% cotton rag, and fold any seams under,
balling up the rag.
The factory has just come out with new targa door and roof seals
for the 911's.  They are made of a new rubber which apparently
will not deteriorate in the traditional fashion.  Surflex is now
being recommended by Porsche for redying worn leather seat
bolsters.  Black is a standard color; other colors will be mixed
to sample.  PCNA will now issue new door jam stickers for those
of you who have lost the original, if you provide them with
proper documentation.   And the list goes on.  In fact, John
handed out the list of twenty-eight different products he
recommended.

A coffee break followed, and this was our first chance to mob the
concession area.  Each of the sponsoring tire companies had a
manned booth.  And there were booths manned by Stoddard Imported
Cars, 912 Enterprises, Performance Video, etc. with all manner of
products for sale.  Our own Nann and Don did a land-office
business selling Boston '91 tee shirts.

Bruce Anderson, our National Technical Chair, followed the coffee
break with a talk on the "Evolution and Modifications of 911
Engines."  You want to know about crankcases?  You came to the
right place.  One bit of trivia is that, with a small number of
exceptions such as the 906, Porsche has always used the same
crankcase on their street and race cars.  Another is that Porsche
updates styles when their tooling wears out.  For example, the
928 fenders and 911 crankcases were updated once the old tooling
was shot.

Despite his long history with Porsche engines, Bruce is a firm
believer in the electronic engine management systems in use
today.  The future of hot-rodding engines lies, he says, in the
DME, using systems like Haltech's.  Of course, making changes
involves updating many, many data points in the chip sets, unlike
swapping three jets in a carburetor.

Bob White spoke next.  We got the benefit of his years working
with Porsche in the form of a history and photographic tour of
the Weissach research center.  Porsche AG derives a surprisingly
large fraction of their revenues from research work done there on
contract to any number of companies.  Projects have included the
A300 Airbus cockpit design, firetrucks, ambulances, crash testing
of Corvettes, all-wheel drive Fords, forklifts, and BMW
motorcycles.  And did you know that the Porsche/Piech family also
imports all of VW and Audi for Austria?

Bob brought along some film footage Porsche shot in the late
fifties.  They were evaluating the handling of their cars and
others on in conditions very much like autocrossing.  "Handling"
is perhaps much too genteel a word, especially when the passenger
had to hike out his window to keep one car from flipping.

After a buffet lunch sponsored by B.F. Goodrich, the ever droll
Jim Newton gave a talk entitled "Understeer, Oversteer, Where to
Steer?"  One point he made was not to focus too closely on wheel
well heights; instead, it is most important that the weight borne
by each wheel be balanced.  Since restoration is his job, Jim
advised us to watch for wear and rust in suspension parts,
especially the torsion bars and chassis parts to which the
suspension bolts.  Rusted torsion bars can crack.  He also went
through a number of photographed examples of reinforcement pieces
welded into 911 series cars.

Next up was Mike Valentine.  He was one of the founders of
Cincinnati Microwave, the folks who make the Escort, Passport,
and Solo radar detectors.  A few years ago, he left to start
Valentine Research.  Their product is the g-Analyst, ads for
which you have probably seen in just about all the car magazines.
One tidbit he offered was its ability to record up to 54 minutes
of track time if you have a laptop computer with you in the car,
rather than the eight minutes it is normally limited to.

There's no new g-Analyst hardware or software planned for the
near future.  If you haven't upgraded to the "level 2" software
yet, it's available for $10.  Mike does have a semi-secret
project in the works: a radar detector.  His non-competition
agreement with Cincinnati Microwave keeps him from saying
anything else about it at present.  If it's half as revolutionary
as his prior products, I would expect great things.

And there were, as might be expected, plenty of radar and speed
control questions.  Mike addressed them in a matter of fact
manner; he clearly knows his facts.  Oh yes, apparently radar
guns have been classified by the FDA as Class C carcinogens.
That lead shield the officer is wearing may not be for bullets...

At 4 o'clock, representatives from the four tire manufacturers
composed a panel: Bob Strange from B.F. Goodrich, Rick Brennan
from Bridgestone, Jack Demaio from Pirelli, and Tom Mason from
Yokohama.  Each gave a brief talk on the state of his company's
art.  Jack Demaio dropped the only bombshell, introducing for the
first time in the US their P Zero C "specialist" tire.  Its
asymmetric tread resembles that of the Yoko A008 series.  It will
be available in 13 - 17" size, is Z-rated, has a 7/32" unshaven
depth, and has a high modulus tread compound (whatever that
means).  Pirelli worked with the Porsche Club Italia in
developing the tire.

Tom Mason was extremely apologetic for his company's broken
promises regarding the RTU series last year.  The A008RS will be
available by the second quarter this year, and at "dramatically
reduced" prices.  Yokohama will be bringing a truck track-side to
SCCA national, regional, and solo events, and to PCA zone-level
events.  Late breaking news: this reporter has been on the phone
regularly with KT Motorsports in New York state.  The latest word
is that the RS's have been released from port, and they are just
waiting for the truck to show up at their door.  Prices are
indeed dramatically less.

Bob Strange fielded a few questions from the audience.  One piece
of advice was that shaved tires generally need more wheel weights
to balance; four or five ounces is not unusual.  Wurth make wheel
weights with a very strong glue, which will help those of use who
lose weights at the track because of melted glue.

And so ended the first day of presentations.  Pirelli sponsored a
cocktail hour, and Bridgestone sponsored a fine dinner.  The
after-dinner speaker was PCA's Alan Friedman, who brought us up
to date on the PCA racing program you've read about in Pano.
Judging from the audience's questions, there is still a fair bit
of uncertainty concerning the expected (and tolerated) level of
competitiveness: is this an SVRA-style Sunday drive, or is it
more of an SCCA Solo program?  To help clear the waters, Alan
showed a very exciting videotape of a like series run by the PC
Great Britain.  Their cars are clearly not street-driven and each
driver is sponsored.  We saw very little car-to-car contact,
despite what was definitely hammer-and-tongs competition.

Sunday's session ran a half-day.  We started with Louis Ruf, head
of the famed Ruf tuning shop.  He brought with him a videotape of
Stefan Roser driving the Yellowbird at the Nurburgring.  I would
hate to be Stefan's tire sponsor; he demonstrated a very smooth,
consistent, technique of sliding the car through every turn.

Louis ran through a list of new products planned or ready for the
964 series (ie, the Carrera 4 and 2 cars).  They have a new
series of 8x17 and 9x17 wheels, asymmetric "run flat" hump design
like Denloc, but able to wear conventional tires.  There will be
a spoiler lip for the front, bolt-on shock tower braces, a
lowering suspension kit, springs and shocks.  And a sports
muffler which works with the existing catalytic converter, has a
right side twin-pipe tip, and restores the 911 baffle sound.
How about a 75 mph relay for the rear spoiler?  It seems that
some police have caught on to the speed at which the stock
spoiler is raised!

In the planning stages are a BTR modification for the new 911
Turbo, and a brand new CTR-2.  The latter will be a 964 twin
turbo, with a 3.4 litre engine.  Initially available as a two-
wheel drive, later as a four-wheel drive.  And 962 brakes for the
Carreras with ABS.  Finally, Ruf is working on two lightweight
Carrera RS', and has started taking on 356 series work.

Our final speaker was Tim Deroin of In-Car Cameras.  He gave us
an interesting overview of the way all those in-car cameras work,
and just how expensive they are.  Some Daytona cars are currently
carrying as many as three or four cameras, pointing out front,
from the rear bumper, at the driver's face, and at his feet.
They get controlled from the infield by a guy with a joystick.
Running an in-car camera can cost $20,000 for the equipment plus
another $500 and hour for the helicopter needed to relay the
signal.  And then the driver hits the wall, of course.

Tim had a bunch of advice for amateur set-ups.  The new Sony
Handicam is a great way to go, easy to mount in the car, for
example to the roll bar.  "Chip" cameras are recommended over
tube models, because they won't be damaged by glare.  A Lexan
shield is easy to make and will protect the camera from debris.
One thing you may notice is that high-horsepower ignition can
cause signal break-up.

Finally, the event ended with all speakers assembled into a panel
to field questions from the audience.  After all the questions
were answered, several hundred Porsche drivers made their ways
homeward, more knowledgeable than when they came, very eager to
get their cars on the road for another season.

Subject: Distler Brothers


Greetings fellow Porschephiles!

I had the unfortunate circumstance of having the wheel bearing go on the
right front wheel of my 928.  This had the effect of allowing the rotor
enough play to get into the caliper and for the hub and spindle to be damaged
as well (have you ever seen the wheel nut literally welded to the spindle
due to the heat?).  So, I have need for major parts.

The nearby shop wants $1363 for the spindle, caliper, hub, bearings, seals,
nut, rotors and pads (basically everything that goes between the balljoints
and the rim) for new parts.  There is a used dealer in Anaheim by the name
Distler Brothers.  They want $440 for the used versions of the same parts.
The guy I talked with claimed the parts were in "fine" condition, whatever
this means, but, I have to admit being a little skeptical at the wide
disparity in cost.

Has anyone out there had dealings with Distler Brothers?  Good or Bad?
Any other recommendations (I'll try Kempton and DH Industries, both in
Florida, tomorrow)?

Thanks for the help!

Keep her 'tween the ditches,

Bert

 all 944 83-86 including turbo have 23.3 mm offset, and wheels as large
 as 8 and 9x16 can be fit on ALL MODELS, turbo or not
 
 all 944 87-91 have 53.3mm offset, and largest is 8 and 9x16.  Porsche
 SAYS the club sport wheels only fit TurboS, but this is not true, they
 have been seen on 87s, and can even be put on early cars and all 928

 and 944S2 wheels are available in 6" (c2 frt) 7" (S2 frt) and 8" (both
 rear)  All prosches currently made have the 53.3 mm offset.  Thes above
 wheels are cars and available from robt wood at about $300 + 15 ship.
 
 A last option for these cars are the rare magnesium 8" and 9" phone
 dials which came on the Rothmanns cars.  These have been seen on 5 cars
 last weekend, so they are available.
 
 On the aftermarket marsh wheels - if you notice, the 951 theels have a
 very odd shape in the inside, as shown in the illustration below.

 -----> inside
 
 99% of aftermarket wheels ore more or less flat on the inside, and will
 not fit the 87 and later 951 because the brake caliper sicks out farther
 than the wheel hub due to the ABS stuff.
 
 I had planned on buying marsh myself, but found that their center plates
 will not clear the brake calipers, especially on turboS cars. and 828
 S-4 models.
 
 I ended up putting 8" phones (87) on thr front of my car.  The 7" jobs
 will interfere with the S-4 style calipers.
 
 Perhaps more than you wanted to know, but I spent alot of time on this
 one.  BTW - 9" on the rear is no problem.  The only aftermarket wheels
 that seem to work on these cars are BBS, which fit in 7.5" and 9.5"
 sizes....

Some of these are "wear" items which I would not re-use from another car except
in the cases of abject penury or being stranded far from home!  Of course,
knowing the history of the car the parts came off helps.  If it was totalled,
there may be hidden damage you're buying.

The parts I would consider re-using are the spindle, caliper, and hub. You
should not, imho, re-use the bearings, seals, nut, or tie-rods.  The rotors and
pads are a toss-up: check the rotors for acceptable depth, any warping or really
jagged grooving.  If you take pads out of a car, they should ideally be put back
in where they came out, ie, right front outer goes back in right front outer,
etc.  I suppose if you're careful and easy the first hundred miles that they'll
bed in to their new homes, though.

Shop the new parts prices around.  Not all dealers charge the same, by any
stretch of the imagination!  I think they tend to really mark up the 928 stuff
more than the other models, to boot.

I'm curious: why did this problem happen in the first place?

Bert,

Sorry to hear about your mishappening.  Maintenance alone is enough  
fun on our Porsches w/o repair.  I just wanted to give you the  
cheapest Porsche parts place I've found thanks to Jim Selders.  They  
give either 10% off factory price or pay for shipping.  Dealers  
aren't much fun.

The place is Claire Motors (800) 354-5100.  I've talked with Barry,  
and Jim says to talk to Mack.  Their other number is (617) 323-4600  
and their fax number is (617) 469-4908.

Good luck with the repair.

James

P.S.  Way to go Violet!!!

Sorry I missed you! Which run group were you in? I was in 1 (my second
time at Rd. Atlanta), driving a red 951 (marked #252). Glad you enjoyed
it. It sure got my blood pumping. I'm seriously thinking of heading up
to Mid-Ohio some time this summer and my instructor is egging me to
drive at Road America over Labor Day (my folks live NW of Chicago, so I
can 'justify' the long trip).

I got to sit 'right seat' for Joe Cogbill when he was 'checking cones'
at lunch time on Saturday. He drove my car to the limit! (and well past
mine - I was hanging on for dear life - we were doing about 130mph in
the 'dip'.)

Sounds like you had good times - I was getting 2:02 - 2:10 (I'm not very
consistent yet). I hear that the heavily modified street 930's were
getting on the order of 1:44. Sheesh!

Just out of curiousity and future reference, is there any handling advantage to
putting the 53.3mm  wheels on an 86 951 (23.3mm)?  Also which wheels are 
considered better (lighter, stronger, etc) the Fuchs or phone dials?

Subject: Laps at Road Atlanta

	What'd you do this weekend?

	I had a great time at Road Atlanta with the Porsche Club 
of America (PCA), and wanted to share some of the fun. Highlights:
	* great (but scary) track, 
	* faultless SCCA track/corner support, and 
	* lots of fun miles learning the track and techniques 
	  with the PCA region's instructors.

	The PeachState region PCA rented the track for the weekend
(2.5 miles of rolling terrain, reminiscent of Road America, but not 
so heavily forested).  As an aside, apparently Porsche is the only 
marque club planning a weekend at Road Atlanta in '91, which seems odd. 

	Instruction
	-----------
	Instructors rode with each driver classed as Novice or 
Beginner; Intermediate drivers make the transition to driving solo; 
all Advanced drivers (and Instructors) drove alone on the track.  
Although driving instructors are not allowed in the cars of Advanced 
drivers (as is done in the NE), the local policy was discussed this 
weekend (and may be changed in the future).

	A Lap at Road Atlanta
	---------------------
	The track features many significant elevation changes,
complete with a roller coaster finish.  Here's a lap:

	You enter on the front straight (1/2 mile), 
leading onto a long, sweeping right-hand turn (1) uphill, 
which crests *just* before a 45-degree left turn (2),
and then you enter a long, 180-degree right-hand carousel (3),
leading to the esses that go down and then again uphill 
through a gulley framed by two hillsides. The first right 
hand turn is downhill and off-camber (4), followed by a 
flat left-right jog that precedes a severe uphill left (5)
leading to a short chute.  Crest the hill, thru the chute,
and you bend around a banked right (6), shortly followed by a 
hairpin right (7) onto the back straight.

	Here's where things get really interesting.
The back straight is about a mile long, full-throttle 
through the entire length (if you dare).  The roller coaster
starts with a mild crest (this track always presents you with 
the Q: "I wonder what's over that hill?") a loooong straight section, 
then a sweeping, blind right hand turn (9) made over "the hump"
and then, suddenly, down into a gulley (10) and back up the hill.
(Be sure and cross the crease at the bottom at the hill
perpendicular to the crease!  And don't do anything funny,
like braking early for the end of the straight, that might
upset the car at this point!).  The roller coaster isn't over yet.

	After a mile of acceleration, you're now presented with 
one exit: turn into a hole in the side of the hill (under a 
pedestrian bridge) - it's a blind right-hand turn (11).  You brake hard, 
aided by the hard uphill slope, turn hard right under the bridge, 
peering over the road to search for the apex of the hill, and then the 
road drops away (300 foot drop in 1/4 mile), as you plummet downhill 
towards a sweeping 90-degree right (12) in front of the grandstands. 
Now you're on the front straight, ready for another lap.

	Now I ask: Is that fun, or what?

	I got to run about 50 laps this weekend, got lots of helpful
instruction, moved up in classification, and met some nice people.
Fast laps in stock Porsches run under two minutes, mine ran are around
2:05, or about 75 mph average speed.

The 52 mm wheels won't fit well on a 23 mm car.  The suspension is really
different, which means your handling will go down the tubes, as I understand
things.  And there's the problem of fitting rims and tires under the wheel well.

Forged alloy wheels (eg, Fuchs five-spoke or dish-shaped) are lighter than cast
alloys (eg, telephone dials).  The fancy term is "sprung mass."  The reason is
that forged metal is stronger by the pound than cast, which means the same net
mechanical strength can be had for less weight.  My limited understanding is
that unless and until you get to be a very accomplished driver, the lower sprung
mass won't make an appreciable difference to your driving.  In the long list of
things to do to improve your times (driver, tires, bars, shocks, etc.) I don't
think I've ever seen wheel mass figure in.

If you have an pre-'87 car, you can get forged rims for a bunch less money than
the '87-forward cars.  Advantage yours!

John, surely you're joking.  The Long Beach GP is this weekend, April 13
and 14.  I'm there.  You can watch Eddie win his first IndyCar race, his
first open-wheel race since his Osella F2 days in '79.  Afterall, he scored
his first F1 points at Long Beach, so why shouldn't he score his first CART
win there.

Oh yeh, if you are into motorcycles, the USGP is the following weekend at
Laguna Seca.

For all you (water cooled VW/Audi 4-5000/Porsche 924,944) owners out
there:

This is an informal survey of security techniques for those of us with
the easy-break-in door handles, please respond via mail.

   Are you using some sort of door-plate/pry guard for your door handles?
      What brand?
   What other security measures (if any) do you have for your car (this
      includes removeable radios/etc)?

   Has you car ever been broken into?
      Were any security measures in place at the time?
      Did that cause you to buy any current security measures?
      What did they break into it to get?

Thanks for any responses, I will (of course) summarize my findings to
the net in some sort of chart.

Subject: 911 Cam Tensioner legality
Cc: 0004537177@mcimail.com


The attached message about the legality of certain cam chanin tensioners 
in SCCA racing was sent to Bruce Anderson by a friend of mine.
I suggested to him that I post this note here in an effort to find out
what is known by other Porsche people.  Can you help?

Thanks.

SUBJECT:  LEGALITY OF PRESSURE FEED CAM TENSIONER UPDATE
     FOR SCCA A STOCK SOLO II RACING
     
Dear Mr. Anderson;

I am currently driving a 1972 Porsche 911T in SOLO II-A Stock.
The problem I have encountered is the legality of the pressure
feed cam tensioner update that has been done to my car.  Since
the car is very competitive in this class, it is under high
visibility for any modifications done to the chassis/drive train.

Under the current SOLO II rules, the pressure fed cam tensioners
are not legal, since the original tensioners are still available
from Porsche.  My worry, as with other 911 owners, is that the
use of this "stock" tensioning system can result in massive
engine failure, especially in this sport.  As a side note, I have
experienced a cam tensioner failure on my 1972 911S, which
resulted in a very expensive rebuild!

Specifically, could please assist me in the following:

1.   Is there ANY literature from Porsche that would support the
     updating of the cam tensioner to the latest pressure feed
     design?

2.   Since this update is not a "performance upgrade", is there
     any information that would, officially from Porsche, suggest
     that this update be recommended over the use of the "old
     style, hydraulic cam tensioner" design?

3.   Could you please direct me to someone at PCNA that could
     assist me with any information to support my case.

4.   If possible, could you assist me in developing a plan to
     appeal and change this ruling.

Since the majority of all 911 owners running in A Stock use the
standard tensioners with the aftermarket mechanical collars, they
to are illegal.  Those not having this protection risk engine
problems.

Please, at your earliest convenience, assist me in this problem.
Please sent a written reply to the aforementioned address, or
call me at either phone number.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Regards,

Glenn B. Ingram

Bob -

A quick pass through the Tech Bulletins yielded the following:

I hope this helps.  I am sure your friend will need back-up, and will be happy
to FAX or mail copies of these bulletins to you or him.  Let me know.

Subject: sun roof

First, I may have had a few messages bounce.  That problem has been
fixed so if you took me off of the list, please add me back on.

My friend has a new MR-2 which has a sorta T top.  The inside "shades"
come out and you are left with clear "glass".  This is a raelly cool
effect, espeically in the rain.

I'm wondering if any third market vendor has a "glass" top for a 944.
I have a '89 944 Turbo.  I've considered just removing the top and
trusting my life to the alarm system (which has a proximaty sensor)
plus I would cover the car in these cases so the thief would have to
work as hard (well almost) to get in as he would to smash a window.

But the problem is the wind noise.  I really like quit cars and the wind
noise would frustrate me I think.  I plan on trying it anyway just to
see.  But does anyone know of such a top or a way to get one semi-custom
built?

Thanks;
pedz

BTW, my cluch went out after just 12K miles.  Sorta bums me out.  It takes
16 hours to replace the damn thing.  Is this usual?  I drive the car
pretty hard but I try not to abuse it.

Yes... There is one of these sunroofs sold by both Automotion and Performance
Products. I think the Automotion price is a hundred or more bucks lower, though.
Get both of their catalogs... The have neat gizmos for your car. I have the same
car in the initial-release '88 version. NO! NOT WITH THE STRANGE RED!

I have a proximity sensor on my alarm... Removing the top will allow
anyone who walks
down the street to set off your alarm... Plus the disadvantage of a strong wind or
some leaves setting it off. I've found that the proximity sensor is rather a pain-
every false alarm I have is caused by it. I'm considering jacking down
the sensitivity
by a LARGE margin.

Wow! Mine's still healthy with over 15k miles and 4 days of track... Yes the track
has hit me like a sledgehammer...

Getting 12Kmiles on a clutch is quite low, so it isn't usual.  You're
making your clutch work too hard.  

16 hours to replace is also *not* usual - if you paid for it.  I
replaced one a few months ago and it took us something like 12 (or
maybe it was 10), and it was our first time.  BOOK on the job is
supposedly 6 or 7.  I sent someone on the list a message about it with
the exact numbers.  Anyway, point is if you paid for 16 hrs of labor
you got ripped.  If you did it yourself it's understandable.

Subject: Help!  914 rear brakes

I cannot for the life of me figure out how to retract the inner pistons on the
rear calipers of a '73 914 2.0.  If it matters, they are ATE calipers.

The outers are retracted by turning an allen screw on the outside of the
caliper.  There is another allen screw on the inside side, but it is
certainly not connected to the inner piston by any mechanism, and does not
have a lock nut like the outer one does.  Another good question would be,
what the hell is this screw for?

Please help me, ASAP!  Thanks infinitely in advance!

Perry,

I believe that the sunroofs Doug referred to in the Automotion and
Performance Products catalogs are made by Saratoga.  It turns out that
one can buy directly from them at a significant savings.  They have an
ad in the April edition of Excellence magazine, in which they are
advertizing tops for $399.  A couple of years ago, I bought a sunroof
for my 944 directly from Saratoga for $350.  The roof had been used as
a demonstrator, but had no flaws or other indication that it was not
brand new.  I don't know whether the $399 tops they are currently
advertizing are new or used, but I would assume they are new, since
they do not specifically mention demo tops in their ad as they did
when I bought mine.  If you are interested, the address is:

Saratoga Sunroof Corp.
821 Main St.
Clifton Park, NY  12065
(518) 877-8588

I have been basically satisfied with my Saratoga top, although it does
not seem to fit quite as well as the factory top.  On my '84 944 and
'86 951, the wind deflector hinges had to be lowered using shims and
longer screws (which are provided by Saratoga along with
instructions).  In spite of the shimming, I was not able to get the
front edge of the top completely level with the car's roof, so there
is a very slight step.  This is not a cosmetic problem, but there is
some wind noise at highway speeds.  I suppose I could eventually solve
this problem by making my own shims or some other kludge, but I have
not been bothered enough to make the effort.  The sunroof also rattles
and squeaks a bit, although I understand some silicone spray might
solve this problem.

To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

Anyone run into this problem?

A friend of mine just replaced the front brake pads on his '74 914.  There
seems to be **much** more drag than with the previous pads, and the brakes
make noise all the time, not just when in use.

Are the pads just wearing in, and perhaps thicker than stock.  The pads are 
from NAPA (don't say it, I know), not from someone reliable.

I didn't see the work done, so I have no info there, just the above symptoms.

Subject: ball joints question


Greetings one and all!

In the course of fixing what James has termed "the bearing bummer," I have
run across the need for replacing the lower right front ball joint.  Simple
enough, right?  I get the new part (which fits just like it was designed
that way :-) and begin the bolt-on process.  So now I hit a snag: the ball
is rotating so that I can't tighten the nut onto the ball joint stud.

So, the question:  how do I keep the ball joint from rotating so that I
can tighten the assembly?

Thanks!

Bert

PS.  I'll post the full "bearing bummer" story when it becomes past history.

I haven't done this on a Porsche, but on other cars in similar situations i've jacked up the car on a point that compresses the balljoint, enabling you to tighten the nut up to the required torque.

Does anyone have any experience with brake pistons turning in their caliper?  I
changed my pads today, and noticed that one seemed to have turned itself
noticeably in the floating caliper of my '87 944S.

What's the best way to calibrate and correct the situation?  I've been told by a
local mechanic that I can pump it out enough to grab the piston above the boot
with, for example, a set of tongue-and-groove pliers, then turn it gently.

Ola Folks!

Its time for the '72 Targa to go topless (happy twentieth, dear).

After market kits seem to be about $3000, and I have seen an oem parts
package for $4500 (Porsche Plus in Denver, now).

I've also located an oem frame for $1800. 

Being a designer by trade, I'd really like to do a clone of my own. 
So, has anyone out there put in an aftermarket or oem frame?
Has anyone fabricated one from scratch?

Anybody know where the guy that did the 1970 Oakland Roadster Show
speedster is now?  Anybody converted a Targa to a speedster?

Please mail or even call collect.  

Also need a pair of seats, in black.


Regards,

I just talked to Mike Upshaw at The Steel Works 619.598.4390 about their
product. It's $2800 to shops, and sounds like it takes only minimal effort
to install. He told me what was involved, and it should take a reasonably
skilled person (with a plasma cutter and MIG/TIG welder) an afternoon  to
install the frame; it was designed to bolt in on any Targa. The rest of the
story is that you then need a substantial amount of work from an upholstery
shop to do the headliner and top on the frame, and to re-finish the rear
deck area (which really isn't there any more...).

I found a guy locally who had purchased the kit and had the installation done
instead of doing it himself. Total cost was about $5k, taking a net of about
4 days in real time. Finished product looked really nice, pretty 
indistinguishible from the factory top. But it's *not* a factory top.

The TSW kit is designed to fasten to the Targa windshield bar rather than
having to do metal fab work there, or take your old Targa top and rip out the
header bar and  weld it to the top (there are kits that require that, BTW).
Using the factory top would require some additional work in that area.

As the car never could have had a factory top to begin with, and as most
of the roll-your-own cabrio tops (i.e. top cover and headliner, not whole
top) I've seen installed were nicer than those done using the factory 
fabric kits, I don't see a real win to using a factory top unless it's 
cheaper or something. Now, if I were doing a '83 and up car, where it
*could* have had the factory top, that's a different story...

One additional work of advice: the pre-78 Targas don't have as much  structural
stiffening as the SC and up cars, and also didn't have the "long-life" 
galvanized bodies (making them susceptible to rust weakening in hidden 
areas). TSW recommends additional stiffening for the pre-78s, and notes
that this might be a really nice time to add that roll cage you've always
wanted...

I'm considering it, but would still rather trade cars for a '86 factory
turbo look cabrio....

On-line porsches

For those Club members who have access to a computer hooked to
either bitnet or internet, a vast resource may be at your
fingertips without your even knowing it.

If you are familiar with how electronic mail works, then you can
sign up for the PORSCHEPHILES mailing list.  Here's how it works: 
you send mail to a central location, and it is automatically
forwarded to everyone on the list.  If you choose to respond to an
article or question, you may respond either to the entore mailing
list of only to the sender.  Information is transmitted almost
instantaniously.  Best of all, for people who already have an E-
mail facility, it is more or less free.

To give a feeling for the scope of the list,  Bruce Anderson is on
it and often answers technical questions, and topics vary from tire
reveiws (by members of the list who race or run track events) to
targa-convertable conversions.  Traffic on the list is medium,
which is to say somewhere between 2 and 10 articles are posted
daily.  Some of the articles from our newsletter get posted, as do
those of other regions.

The address of the list is:

There are both club and non-club members on the list, but we have
been pretty sucessful in our conversion efforts.

Other mailing lists catering to  varying interests also exist.  For
example, the "schools" list talks about driver's education for all
marques, and the auto-x list, with maybe 20-30 articles a day deals
with all aspects of autocross.

If any club members care to contact me for further information, I

Actually this is the best way to contact me for any reason!

	I'm sure that this discussion did the rounds a while ago, but I
thrashed a hard disk and lost a lot of mail, so apologies for
bringing it up again ...

	I am in the market for a used 944. My top budget is 10,000 pounds
(about $US17,000), and on this side of the pond that might buy me an
'85 with about 50,000 on the clock (buying privately, not from a
dealer!).

	So .... what shoul I be aware of when looking at these beasts? What
goes wrong? Are there any particular extras worth getting (or
avoiding!)? Were there any significant changes about that time,
where it is worth getting the later car?

	Thanks in advance for any info.

Philip

Remember Al Caldwell's article in Pano last year about the differences between
the OEM and after-market 911 oil filters?  Well, I changed my 944S' oil today,
taking out the last of my Imparts-supplied PER 165 filters out and putting in a
PCNA-supplied PER 165.  Guess what - you can see the same difference in them as
with the 911 filters, just by looking in their bases.

Does anyone know WHY these same-numbered parts are different?  PCNA: what's the
deal - why does Purolater (well, Knecht really) market a same-numbered part
which is in fact different?

My little red car is going blinkey these days.  This happen to

First the light behind the climate control panel was blinking and a

I going to be driving a car without dashlights soon?  Anybody know

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

Hi all,

 Today I happily removed the cover from my 944S to speed off to a
matinee.  The engine starts fine and I get a good feeling about the car,
especially since she's been waiting for someone to drive her all week.
Just as I get ready to engage first, I am bewildered by the apparent
disappearance of the clutch pedal; I could have sworn that I just
depressed it...  A careful look under the dash finds the pedal sitting
idly against the floor panel.  Well, to make a long story short - there
seems to have been a catastrophic failure of all or part of the clutch
hydraulic system.  Since there is no tell-tale wet spot under the
tranny, I am puzzled as to where the problem might be.  I've tried
pumping the pedal manually to no avail and even tried to fill the brake
fluid reservoir to maximum.  Since there is absolutely no pressure
developing with the pedal, I am very concerned about this car's future.

 Anybody care to venture a suggestion or advice before I resort to the
moneysuckers to get the car going?

p.s. sure wish I hadn't put off buying those factory manuals - but then
again; even if I had, would I have been able to effect the proper
repairs?

Subject: 914 suspension conversion


 Greetings again, folks.

 Well cruised to the Automotion swap meet again this weekend
 and got the necessaries to convert my 914 suspension to a
 911 suspension (front strut towers, struts, "S" calipers, and
 rotors).

 The question I have remaining is what wheels to buy. I've
 been thinking about going to 16" wheels (7" phone dials all
 the way around). I gather that the early phone dials will
 fit under stock fenders. If they don't, no biggie. I'm
 planning on having the car painted and bodywork done in
 the very near future (like next month). 

 So I need some advice as to what wheels to get. Any reason
 I shouldn't go to the 16"? Are 15" or 16" wheels more
 expensive? What about tires (A008s of some form). Anybody
 know what offset I should look for wheels in? 

 Has anyone on this list done this and do you know how much
 my fenders would have to be flared to accomodate 7" wheels?

 thanks in advance,
 Stef

Subject: ATE calipers


 I had a question vis a vis Porsche brake calipers.

 My 914 has ATE calipers and I picked up both alloy
 and steel calipers for the 911 this weekend that
 are ATE. 

 Is this a subsidiary of Porsche? Have they always
 made Porsche's calipers?

 The alloy calipers are rather nice - unibody 
 construction, very large dimensions but very light.

 Anybody know if Koni struts are hard to rebuild (mine
 need it very badly). Am going to put rebuild kits in
 the calipers as well. I figure that they probably 
 need it..

ATE is a German OEM brake part manufacturer. ATE is used on Audi, BMW,
Porsche, and perhaps VW and Mercedes as well.

I have ATE rotors and master cylinder on my '85 Quattro. Good stuff!

On the Konis, I think they are lifetime warranty -- send 'em back!

You probably have one of two problems.  The first is that you got air in your
clutch, which is a bear to get out because of the angle of the master clutch
cylinder.  It is unlikely to have snuck in unless you tried bleeding it.

The other possibility is a leaking or failed master or slave cylinder.  If your
master fails, you will likely get fluid in the driver's footwell, staining your
mats or carpets.  The slave cylinder, however, will leak right onto the ground.

There are probably a number of other things which could cause this sort of
failure.  Your should probably seek professional advice.

ATE = Alfred Teves, and as mentioned, they and Girling are two independent
suppliers of braking, etc. components to Porsche and other manufacturers.

The Koni lifetime guarantee doesn't exist if you bought the shocks with your
Porsche, or from PCNA.  If this is the case, you get PCNA's standard one-year
guarantee on parts.  However, PCNA has proven to be very flexible with parts
which have broken long before they should have.  If you have Koni's which leaked
(or whatever) after, say, 18 months on your car, by all means ask your dealer
who will take it up with your area rep.

I have no knowledge or experience re: rebuilding shocks.

Subject: ATE calipers


    The alloy calipers are rather nice - unibody 
    construction, very large dimensions but very light.

Be careful of these if you're building a track car.  They flex
a lot, giving the pedal a very spongy feel.

Subject: 928 key problem


You might try PCNA, although I suspect if Stoddard sent you the wrong
key that the core has been changed.  Does the key they sent you not
fit both the door and ignition (and glove box, and trunk)?

    You probably have one of two problems.  The first is that you got
    air in your clutch, which is a bear to get out because of the angle
    of the master clutch cylinder.  It is unlikely to have snuck in
    unless you tried bleeding it.

  If there is air in there, he would still be able to feel some
  pressure, and should be able to pump it up.

Alas, this ain't so.  When I got air in mine, it went to the floor and stayed
there.  I could pull the pedal back up and repeat the experiment with absolute
repeatability.  Because of the slant of the cylinder, air which is in it stays
there and compresses - pumping won't help.  You feel a bit of pressure as the
pedal goes down, but then it "thunks" to the floor.

  Apparently, there is a large spring aft of the firewall and connected
to the clutch pedal that causes the initial slight pressure.
(creates an effect not unlike that found on a compound bow)

  I've tried repeatedly moving the pedal to and fro at high speed to
no avail.  Looking under the bell housing where the slave (master?)
cylinder is, I see an cylindrical opening where a small rubber knob-like
protuberance moves slightly when the pedal is exercised.  This, in
addition to a general lack of spilt fluids in the immediate vicinity
gives credence to seal failure (ala Welty) or possibly trapped air (ala
Gross).  Although I've never had the occasion to fool with either clutch
hydraulic cylinders...

  Thank you, guys.  I've determined that, right now, my time is a bit
more valuable than parts and exploratory surgery by my trusty teutonic
paisan - so off to the shop she goes   :-(

  I hope this never happens to you!

Call any competent locksmith. It's a pretty easy, although somewhat
expensive (~$100) job to pull the lock, read the numbers and code-cut a 
new set of keys. 

I've had to replace various keyed items (door handles, targa top releases,etc)
on my cars over time, and usually trot  right down to have the new piece
re-keyed to fit the old keys. It makes life *so* much simpler...
