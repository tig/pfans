Subject: 951 suspension upgrade?

My '87 944 turbo needs shocks.  A friend wants to sell me his shocks
(Koni adjustable), adjustable front springs, sway bars, and rear torsion
bars from his '89 turbo (Turbo S suspension). He took them off the car
at about 5k miles.

I've called a few mechanics and they all 'think' that everything will fit.

I'm driving Rd. Atlanta and Talledega 3 or 4 times a year each.  I swore
that I wouldn't spend money on upgrading the car (it's still stock - I
haven't even put a chip in it), but if the price is right I'm tempted.
I'll have everything torn apart to install the shocks anyway -
installing the new springs and sway bars shouldn't add too much to the
job.

So I guess I'm looking for a little net wisdom: will the springs and
sway bars make a noticable difference on the car (I'll be buying shocks
regardless)? Has anyone ever done this? I've called Kemper Bros. and PAP
to determine a 'fair' price on the parts, but neither had any in stock
and would not quote a price. Where else might I call?

Thanks,

BTW - I decided not to buy that bolt-in-the-seat-belt roll bar. I'll
probably eventually break down and bolt in an SCCA-approved bar.

Steve -

This is a good question, and I'm not completely sure of the answer.  The Turbo S
front axle is a little different from the '87 Turbo.  According to the manual,
the changes were made to:

  strut bearing
  shocks
  springs
  struts
  steering knuckle
  wheel hub
  brake disk

all of which jibes with my memory of changes.  The springs themselves are not
adjustable.  It's the threaded spring perch on the strut which allows them to be
adjusted.  I suspect the springs, by themselves, just might be useable.  The
pre-S springs are softer and taller, and the "S" springs were available as part
of the '87 951 option M030 sports chasis, aka Club Sport.  Then again, perhaps
the M030 package included the different struts as well.  I am unsure.

You can get a stiffer set (with spacers) from Weltmeister if that's what you'd
like.  Very cheap.

I believe you can use the sway bars and torsion bars.  They too were available
as part of the M030 package, and I don't think any suspension components with
which they mate were changed.  The Turbo S package just put a new name on
something which was largely already available.  Remember that, initially,
Porsche sold the Turbo S as a separate "option package."

Let me knowwhat you learn.

Subject: 944 balance shaft seals

Last weekend I decided to change the antifreeze in my 87 944S (and at the
same time change a leaking heater valve). When I removed the splash pan
on the bottom, I saw some oil drops on the bottom of the belt housing,
so I decided to investigate. I removed the front belt housing (upper and
lower parts), and found a fair amount of evidence of oil leakage. Near
the upper balance shaft sprocket there were black, relatively hardened
oil deposits, as if there had been minor leakage for a long time (the car
has 33K miles on it). There were similar "old" oil deposits elsewhere,
including near the bottom shaft sprocket, but they were most significant
near the upper shaft. There were traces of fresh oil in lots of places,
so it is hard to tell what is leaking now. Incidently, the balance shaft
belt was very loose- I could actually rotate each of the balance shafts
slightly using the play in the belt. The "expensive noises" belt (e.g. 
the cam belt) at least felt quite tight to the touch. I plan to replace
both belts as a matter of course (the cam belt has only 13K miles since
the factory recall replacement (944S only)). However, I have some other
related questions:

How much evidence of slow oil seepage is typical when one removes the 
housing to tension belts?

Are the balance shaft seals prone to leakage, or is the leakage symptomatic
of a bigger problem (such as play in the front balance shaft bearings)?

Can the balance shaft seals be replaced just be removing the sprockets,
or do the front bearing housings need to be removed?

If the latter, can they be removed with the balance shafts and side covers
in place?

To get there, I assume I will need to pull the crankshaft pulley to get
off the back half of the belt housings. Any insights on holding the
crankshaft to loosen the bolt, or gear pullers which fit without
dismantling the rest of the car (I don't think any of mine will fit)?

While I am there are there any characteristics (play, noise, etc) which
indicate impending water pump failure?

Any thoughts on "preemptive" pulley replacement (and wuich)? I will
of course replace any if the idlers or tensioner pulleys which are noisy.

Any guesses as to why the balance shaft belt got as loose as it did?
I assume it was tensioned 13K miles ago when the cam belt was replaced.

Thanks for the help.

Frank,

I don't think any oil seepage is typical in the sense of "to be
expected and tolerated".  Certainly if the oil is entering the
belt covers, the problem should be addressed.

>Are the balance shaft seals prone to leakage, or is the leakage symptomatic
>of a bigger problem (such as play in the front balance shaft bearings)?

I had a lot of trouble with all of the seals on the front of the
engine in the '84 944 I used to own.  The seals in my 951 seem to be
behaving much better.  I think leaking seals are not at all
uncommon on these cars, and are not necessarily an indication of more
serious problems.  The fact that Automotion sells a front end seal
"kit" for 944s makes me think that they found a need and filled it.

>Can the balance shaft seals be replaced just be removing the sprockets,
>or do the front bearing housings need to be removed?

I believe that the seals can be replaced without bothering the bearing
housings, but I have not done this myself to say for sure.

Yes, the pulley has to come off to get the back cover off.  You have
to remove the starter and use the flywheel to prevent the crank from
turning while you turn the center bolt (which requires significant
torque).  There is a tool you can buy that engages the flywheel teeth
and bolts into the starter mount.  The tool costs about $45 and makes
the job a one man operation.  A cheaper alternative that I have used
successfully is to get an assistant to hold a screwdriver between the
side of the starter opening and the flywheel teeth.  I did find that a
large gear puller was necessary to get the pulley off the crankshaft,
but I don't recall having any problems getting clearance for it (ie,
didn't have to remove the radiator or anything radical like that).

>While I am there are there any characteristics (play, noise, etc) which
>indicate impending water pump failure?

All of the above are indicators of a pump going bad.  In my
experience, a pump can exhibit these characteristics for quite some
time before it actually fails, so it is hard to predict "impending"
failure.  The most obvious indicator of a failing pump is whitish
coolant residue on the bottom of the engine and belts covers.  If you
have the belt covers off, you can easily see a trail of coolant
issuing from the pump shaft.  With the belts off, the pump bearing can
be tested by grabbing the pulley and seeing if you can wiggle it.
Failing bearings will make noise after a while, the frequency of which
changes with engine speed.

>Any thoughts on "preemptive" pulley replacement (and wuich)? I will
>of course replace any if the idlers or tensioner pulleys which are noisy.

I have wondered about this myself.  I can imagine what a worn sprocket
might look like, but have never actually seen one.  With only 33K on
your car, I would guess that you wouldn't have to worry about this for
a while (but it would still be nice to know the answer).

>Any guesses as to why the balance shaft belt got as loose as it did?
>I assume it was tensioned 13K miles ago when the cam belt was replaced.

Hard to say.  One can speculate on all the possibilities (belt
stretched too much (was it a Porsche belt or an after-market?), belt
wasn't retensioned when the cam belt was replaced, belt was not
tensioned properly, the nut on the tensioning pulley was not torqued
properly (45 Nm) and the the tensioner moved, etc.).  It will be hard
determine the exact cause unless you did the tensioning yourself and
knew that it was done correctly.

Good luck,
Milo

Frank -

My understanding is that balance and cam shaft seal leaking is not uncommon, nor
is it something to worry about a lot.  When PCNA bought me a water pump a few
years back, the mechanic noticed that my seals were leaking and replaced them. 
I would worry if the rate of seepage were great, or if there were any chance it
could leak onto the cam belt.  I have never heard that oil leaking from the
balance shaft indicates bearing disease.

I dunno about having to pull all the sprockets to get the back cover off.  Could
be.  The workshop manual tells you how to line them back up, in any event.

Btw, the sprockets are a "wear item" I have learned.  When my belt broke, they
replaced "everything the belt touched," which I take to include all the
sprockets and the idler.  Dick Howe (the 'beast' car) has replaced his a number
of times.  I believe the idler roller is generally replaced with a new belt, but
am unsure. (I know who to ask if you don't get a definite answer from someone
else.  Let me know.)

The special "pusher" for inserting the balance shaft seals looks pretty useful. 
You apparently need two special tools for the flywheel-end crank seal.  I don't
know whether these guys are vital to the job.  The two balance shaft seals and
the crank seal are all different sized.

Oh yeah, Milo, the torque on the tensioner nut and bolt is 20 Nm, not 45!  It's
the idler roller that gets 45 Nm!

I visited my mechanic this AM, and asked him about the balance shaft seals.  He
recommended attending to them promptly, because oil and belts shouldn't be
allowed to mix.  He also said that the "spacers" (what the manual calls them, he
had some other term for them) onto which the BS seals push are replacement
items.

Jerry also said to point out the importance of coating the drive gear bolts with
sealant, as described in the workshop manual.  Apparently it is not uncommon for
a mechanic to fail to do this, oil leaks like crazy, and heads are scratched.

I just forgot you and Frank have the mechanical belt tensioner.  My
car has the old eccentric tensioning gizmo that definitely wants the 45Nm
(as does everything else associated with the belts).

Subject: Chain tensioner failure?

  I've always heard that chain tensioner failure is preceded by a rattle
"just above idle".  Is this the correct symptom?  Is the noise just above idle
or is it at an RPM just above idle?  Hmmm...

  I have 83 SC style tensioners with those little blue safety rings on my
engine.  It was rebuilt in 83 and has only 40K miles on it since then.  What's
happening is a nasty rattle will begin while driving (not at idle) after the
engine has been at a higher RPM for a few seconds.  The rattle can be quieted
by letting the engine go back to idle and then engaging the clutch again.
After a few more seconds, the rattle will reappear.  This mainly occurs when
it is cold outside, and more recently when the car is fully warmed up (but
not in between...?).  Sometimes I can get it to occur with the hand throttle
full up and I've poked around trying to find where it's coming from, but to
no avail (it's not the heat exchanger covers...).

  Is this the bad news I've been waiting for?  Are my tensioners failing?  Or
did someone just drop some bolts into my exhaust manifold...  The rattle is
very obnoxious from the outside, but can barely be heard inside the car with
the windows up.

REPLACE YOUR TENSIONERS NOW.

You'll be sorry if you don't.  The old style tensioners should be
rebuilt every 20K miles.  Or an upgrade to the Carrera tensioners
once.  

The chain rattle occurs in "overrun", when you are backing off the
throttle, bacause this is the time when the slack on the chain is
greatest and if the tensioner is failing it isn't taking up that slack
and the chain is scraping against the housing.  If it's really bad
you'll hear it at certain constant RPMs, where the harminic motion of
the chain hits the housing (this means the tensioners have already
collapsed). 

Your problem may not be your tensioners, but they will fail
eventually.

REPLACE YOUR TENSIONERS NOW.

Kevin,

The car is apart now (at least the belt cover is off), and I will at least
replace the seals and the belts (partially because I can't prove they haven't
been damaged by oil). The key issue is to figure out if there is anything
else I should do at the same time.

I assume I will just buy the "seal kit", either from Automotion or
AutoMechanica, and install the balance shaft oil seals, the associated 
flanged bushings the seals ride on, and the o-rings which seal them to
the shafts. Unless I find evidence of leakage, I may not replace the
cam oil seal. I don't know what else is in the kit.

I'm not sure what you (or Jerry) means by "drive gear bolts". Does he
mean the crank and cam pulley bolts? I will have to look further in my
shop manual, because this doesn't ring a bell based on my first reading.
Also, how does an oil leak "scratch the heads"?


You commented in an earlier response that the sprockets are wear items.
I haven't heard that anywhere else. I have heard much discussion about
replacing anything with a bearing in it, toothed or not, but not the
sprockets which are on the crankshaft, camshaft and balance wheels.
Do you really mean sprockets? If so, can I measure the degree of wear by
comparing the portion of the sprocket the belt runs on to that which
it doesen't run on? Do others replace the sprockets for the balance
shaft belt as well, or just the cam belt?

By the way, Milo's comment on 45 nm of torque for the belt tension
adjuster was in the context of the tension on the balance shaft belt,
where I believe the torque is still 45 nm (we were discussing why the
balance shaft belt on my car was so loose). The 20 nm number (at least 
from memory) applies only to the cam belt tensioner on post-87 cars.

Frank -

The head scratching is human fingers on a human scalp!  Ie, trying to figure out
how "that" could have happeneded.  Ah, the foibles of natural language.

The bolts in question retain the drive gears for the balance shaft.  They are
called out as items 1 and 30 om pg 13-44 of the wkshp manual.  The installation
instructions are to "Coat threads with Loctite 574, torque: 45Nm, hold with
Special Tool 9200."  This is the orange stuff the factory uses to seal cases,
aka "Flachendichtung."  I believe Curil makes a similar product.  Its purpose in
life is sealing, not locking.

Regarding sprocket wear, yes, I mean the sprockets.  This was the first time I
myself had heard them described this way.  Perhaps one need not replace them
except in the event of a belt failure.  I have never seen any guidelines on
evaluating their condition.  Does anyone else out there have any experience in
this matter?

Subject: 944 T fan problem


Radiator fan is permanently on!
As long as the ingnition key is at position 'I' (radio on), the radiator fan
turns on and it remains on until engine is off and ignition key is trurned off.
The fan does not turn on after the engine is off (I assume that this is 
because the engine is not hot so there is no need for it). 
Does it look like a thermostat problem?

Thanks in advance,

Sounds like a thermoswitch problem.  Easy way to check: remove one of
the connectors to the thermoswitch.  The fan should stop running.

When you replace it, you may wish to consider the "early-on" type of
thermoswitch (advertised as "activates 25 degrees F. sooner").

Tassos, George -

Like George says, check the coolant temperature switch.  If that isn't it, the
problem is almost certainly with the relay (G10).

I have a question regarding the aftermarket 25F lower-temperature switches to
which George refers.  Why and how to they help?  I would assume that since the
engine is designed for a particular thermal operating point, then lowering that
point by some amount will only hurt.  (I remember reading a while back that
early 911's suffered from the fact that their two-litre engines did not generate
enough heat under street conditions to keep the engine at an acceptable
operating temperature.)

I recently put an oil temp sender and gauge in my car.  Two relevent
observations from pure street driving.  The first is that the oil temp (in New
England fall weather) is about 190 - 200F, which seems fine.  The other is that
the oil warms up a lot slower than the coolant.  The water temp gauge is at its
steady-state point (the lower white mark) a lot sooner than the oil.

I am looking for increased cooling capacity, as mentioned in the past.  It is
not clear to me that diddling the coolant temp switch will help at all the this
respect.  Perhaps I am missing something and one of you can correct me.

Recently, I had the pleasure of driving a 912.  The car was in
wonderful shape, with a recently rebuilt engine and newer paint.  Any
rust was well out of sight, and my eyes were in and under all of this car.
I have heard that rust is hard ($) to repair on the pre-'70 cars.  Is 
this true?  Has anyone repaired rust or had experience with this?

The engine looks and sounds very nice, with only the stubborn drip-a-day
from the oil drain-plate.  The motor hadn't been started in about three
weeks.  Upon starting, the motor shot plenty of smoke out the tail.  This
left black spots in a cone on the driveway which looked like jet-black
soot.  Is this normal?

The carbs (Solex PII 40's, I think?) seemed to be misadjusted or not
balanced, as the thing idled poorly.  There were audible carb backfires
through the left side, and the motor shook like a paint shaker.  The
carbs were generally clean, with only slight gas discoloring around
the sides.  There were no leaks around the throttle shafts, and the linkages
were very tight and well adjusted.

On the engine, there is the relatively large vertical container with
the oil cap and the breather hose to the right carb.  After a spirited
drive, the water vapor from the oil was easily visible in this container,
and there was plenty of it.  Strangely, there was a LOT of rust inside
the container.  The inner walls were completely covered with a thick
layer of rust.  I am assuming this is caused by short trips in a moist
climate.  The oil absorbs moisture which is evaporated into the breather
box on the short trips.  Not all of the moisture is evaporated upon 
engine shutdwon, and some condenses on the walls of the box.  Can this
be harmful to the engine?  Just sticking my finger into the box caused
rust to flake off and fall down to where ever the bottom of this box goes.

I was surprised to find this car in such good condition.  Even the
clock worked!  Isn't the clock the 'wear meter' of the 912?  The tach
seemed sticky.  They are mechanical, with the measuring point on the
pump on the driver's side of the engine, right?  The car shifted,
clutched, steered, and braked like a dream!  Of course, like all of the
Porsches I have ridden or driven, the whole car was tight and rattle-free.
It felt like it had been machined from one chunk of material.  The only
audible sound was the engine...  The way driving SHOULD be!

Any thoughts, stories, anecdotes?

Yes, I have a 1966 912 (actually bought in 1965 and one of the first
off the line) that I got to restore.  Needs lots of work but doable. 
And then I got into grad school.  I instantly fell in love with the
machine, for its simplicity.  I don't care how many cylinders it has,
the owners manual says o-60 in around 11 seconds, and 119 top speed
looking at the graphs.  That is plenty for me.  I love the simple
but effective brakes, suspension, steering, dash, seats, everything.
I get very upset when I see a  horn grilled 911 (meaning an early
model) with a whale tail and air dams and wheel wells.   Thats about
all I can say about my 912 excet:  I finally started to give in to
my parents "get it out of here" stuff and sell it for a couple of
hundred bucks, but after reading your driving imression "shifted,
clutched steered and braked like a dream" I'm not certain I can do 
it any more.  Only thing I'de rather have is a 356.

I presume you're thinking of buying this car?  If so, get a Porsche-expert
to look at it.  My 912 is rust-free, so I can't comment on your rust.

Yeah, I get this, too.  :-/

Sure.  The Solex PII 40 doesn't have a choke, so you have to pump it like
mad to get it started and keep it running, especially after several weeks.
Still, it sounds like you're running rich.

912's were famous for rough idle, though mine is no paint shaker and idles
pretty smooth.  There could be serious internal carb problems (and no spare
parts are available beyond rebuild kits - gaskets and jets) that could cost
you big bucks.

My '69 912 is a daily driver...  it's in decent shape, and looks better
these days...

Three weekends ago I finally got fed up with the oxide-ridden paint (the
color is guards red).  I've been looking at the deeply-scratched and
oxidized surface for months, lamenting the day when I'd have to fork over
major bucks for a paint job.

I stopped at an auto parts store that I trust (not a Pep Boys or Trak Auto
but a place where the guys REALLY know what they're talking about) and
asked for a five-minute lesson in oxidized paint and what to do about it.

I walked out with three products (all made by "The Wax Shop"): "Dark Magic"
(a paint deoxidizer - non-abrasive (chemical??)), "Super Glaze" (a liquid
wax) and "Cam Metal Polish" (for the wheels - Fuchs) and about $25 poorer.

My girlfriend and I got some clean rags and towels and rolled the car
outside (it was a cool, overcast day - perfect!) and went to work with the
"Dark Magic".  This was a Saturday morning around 8:00am...

Four hours later, we had removed 95% of the oxide - and scratches - from
the surface.  It shone like it never had since I bought the car.  The oxide
was so bad on the roof and rear fenders that it took four applications to
remove the oxide.

Then we waxed the car - that took all of 45 minutes.  I got the windex out
and did all the windows - inside and out, and cleaned the upholstery as
well.

We showered and went to dinner in Long Beach at a restaurant on the marina.
By evening it was raining lightly (misting, really), and the 912 looked
"killer" in the parking lot, now glossy with rain.

I feel sooo much better about my 912 now...

Subject: Koni Shocks
Date: Fri, 15 Nov 91 10:09:17 PST
From: dick@elliot.cdc.hp.com

Does anybody have any experience with rebuilding Koni shock absorbers?
I have a 62 356B -90 with Konis and have had the front shocks get very
hard.  I got Koni to replace them under their lifetime warrantee as I had
a sales slip in my files.  Yesterday I noticed that the rear shock was 
also getting very stiff and I pulled them off the car.  One shock is normal
and the other has a variable stiffness, as though there is something 
jamming the valving.  Unfortunately, I must have lost the sales slip for the
rear shocks. I have owned the car since new so I know I bought the shocks,
although I don't have proof of purchase.  

Talking to a local salvage yard, EASY, in Emeryvill, CA, they said that if
the car is not driven very much the shocks will go bad.  This is now 3 of 4
Konis, (actually 7 of 8 if you count the original Konis delivered with the
car) which have failed for this reason.  I guess that the price is so high
because of warrantee costs.  

My plan at this point is to pick up a used shock at EASY ~ $20 and pull the
failed shock apart to see what is happening. I would appreciate any tips on
what to look for.

Anyone know who the US distributor for Cibie BOBI headlites is?  I've
used them for several years, need a new one and can't find anyone
that carries them anymore.  Something about distribution practices
being quite unfavorable.  A name of a retail outlet would be even
better.  I may have to switch over to the very expensive Bosch US
legal setup (I know about several Bosch and Hella lites that are not
DOT approved that still use the H-4 bulb).

Subject: 3.2L Induction Mods

In a recent issue of _European Car_ (July?) there was an article about a
shop in California that does induction mods to the Carerra 3.2 motor.
They claimed to take a motor from 199hp to 249hp by just doing mods on the
induction side of the engine, including opening up air passages, changing
air metering, creating a matching DME chip, etc.  This is without going
inside of the engine!  They then took the motor from 249hp to 259hp by
changing to SSI heat exchanges and a Bursch muffler.

I know the exhaust change figures have been well documented but what
about the induction mods?  Is it really possible?

I haven't changed to a Carerra from my SC, yet, but I do want to get
information about inexpensive (yeah right), reliable, REAL ways to get
more horsepower.

Just for reference the shop is BRD Engineering.  I'm not sure of the exact
name since the article is at home.

Disclaimer: this is not an add, it is a reality check.

Subject: tire blowout

Here is what happened.  About a month or two ago, my car started to feel
a little squirrly.  This progressed into a slight tug to the right
on Thursday.  Friday, I drove for a long while going to a camp ground
and the tug turned into a strong pull.  On Sunday coming back, the
right front tire blew out.  The inside of both front tires were basically
gone.

I had P0's (on a '89 951) which I bought in May '91.  They were not that
used.

One quess is that my alignment was so bad that it caused the tires to
were out very quickly and I just didn't notice the uneven tread wear.
I sorta doubt this since it is a relatively new car and I haven't been
curb surfing in it.

The other guess is that the right front had a defect.  My guess is that
the inside side wall was defective.  (At this point, there is a tear all
the way around the tire about a half inch above the rim).  This cause the
pull to start, which caused the excessive wear, which caused the blowout.

I feel sorta stupid since I should have noticed the wear.  I did check
the tire pressure twice during this time and it was at the 2.5 bars it
is suppose to be at.

Anyone have any guesses.  I don't know what the tire folks are going to
say but I wanted some insight before I go talk to them.

Thanks

Andial and Ollies have been doing this kind of work for some time (not
to mention RUF).  Porting and polishing, expanding the intake
manifolds, changing the DME chip, and of course a less restrictive
exhaust - the horsepower boost is most significant.  This past summer I
finished a 3.2 Carrera engine with just such a modification, and put
it onto an SC.  The result was incredible.  The car had so much power
(it wasn't dyno'd) we broke a halfshaft.  Had to update to the Turbo
shafts.  We also machined the heads for twin-plug, but the second
ignition system hasn't been installed.

The best thing to do is to call Pirelli.  Don't go back to the place
you got it from, they are generally very stupid.  

Pirelli's customer service number is: 1-800-243-0167.  Just tell them
the truth and see what they say.

has bruce anderson disappeared from the net?  0002549486@mcimail.com used to be
his email address, but i just had a message bounced by mcimail.

here's my question, in case anyone else on the net would like to take a stab
at it:

i have a question about ride height and cv joint longevity.

this month's issue of sports car international has an article about the carrera rs,
a 300 lb lighter version of the carrera 2 meant for carrera cup racing in europe.

after slobbering all over the car, sci says oh by the way it isn't available here
because of N various things, including the ride height being 2" below the current
us model carrera.

in passing they mention that the european ride height is in between these figures.

so my question is, what is the "designed in" ride height, eg that height at which
the half-shafts are parallel to the ground?

is there such a thing as a "correct" ride height?  does having a constant, non-zero
cv joint angle affect longevity?

the inside side wall was defective.  (At this point, there is a tear all
the way around the tire about a half inch above the rim).  This cause the

      In my experience this type of wear is indicative of underinflation.
       
I feel sorta stupid since I should have noticed the wear.  I did check
the tire pressure twice during this time and it was at the 2.5 bars it
is suppose to be at.

      I would be sure to leave no doubt that the tire was correctly 
      inflated.  Until I read the above paragraph, I was sure that
      this was an inflation problem.

      I would:
          Check for polished metal near the inside of the tires.
          Check for broken or loose suspension parts.
          Check you pressure gauge.
          Not buy Pirelli tires in the future (I already have a bias here).

      Just FYI, the ONLY blowout I have ever had was a brand new (>2000
      miles) P3 on a friend's car.  The friend's father is a mechanic and
      his car is WELL maintained and I know the pressure was correct 2 days
      and about 400 miles before the blowout.  There was no pull or other 
      indication of a tire problem.

      I have also noticed the 65 mph shimmy on P7's.  From talks with
      others, it looks like I am not the only to notice this problem.  
      Rumor is that it is caused by belt delamination.

      As long as Yokohama is in business, why buy Pirelli tires? (I know,
      they probably came with the car)
 
Anyone have any guesses.  I don't know what the tire folks are going to
say but I wanted some insight before I go talk to them.

Subject: Suspension upgrade really worked (and chip query)

A few weeks back, I enquired about the advisability of updating my '87
951's shocks/ coil springs/front swaybar with turbo S parts from a
friend's '89 car.

Well, I went ahead and did it. _Boy_ does it make a difference. I cut
_2.5_ seconds off my lap times at Road Atlanta. More importantly, the
car handles much more predictably, and I feel much more in control. 

I really like the adjustable shocks (Konis) - I set them full stiff for
the track, then back them off to full soft on the highway. Great
handling on the track without a bone jarring ride on the street.

Unfortunately, a friend from Tampa blew his head gasket on his '89 951.
First session, 5th lap. Clouds of white smoke everywhere. Ruined his
entire weekend. I had pretty much convinced myself to install a stage
2.5 Autothority chip next year, but now I'm leary. (That's what he was
running (only 6k miles on the engine!), and the scuttlebut at the track
was that every 951 head gasket that anyone had ever heard of blowing
were on cars that were 'chipped'.)  I had the impression that the new
Autothority chips were relatively 'safe' - am I mistaken? The word at
the track is that the Autothority chip's timing is (too) radically
advanced but that other chips were more conservative (someone mentioned
an 'escort' chip based on Porsche factory chips for the turbo cup cars).

| did your friend who blew a head gasket say what he was running for boost?
| there's a calibration procedure you're supposed to go through when you put
| the chips in.  people i know who have blown head gaskets have since restricted
| their max boost to .8 bar.

Yes - he said that he'd had continual troubles w/ overboost (in the 1.9
- 2.0 bar range). He'd experiemented (in consulatation w/ Autothority)
with several banjo bolts but nothing ever worked. He also said that his
temp guage had been reading high ever since the car was new (even with
stock chips). The dealer claimed that it was normal, but his guage
always read just shy of the redline (mine never gets past the second
hash mark).

And I thought it was because I spun my SC (only half way around) on the
autox course ;-).   Regarding the delamination rumor...
What would be the cause of delamination?  Overheating?  Rotating tires
to the other side?  I'm seriously persuing alternates to the P7's.

Subject: 911/914 master cylinder

I wish to upgrade the brake master cylinder in my 914 to a better one.  In
the class I race in, I can use *any* master cylinder.  In particular, the
rule reads:
	Any brake line, single or dual master cylinder, vacuum brake
	booster, brake proportioning valve may be used.  "Safety breakers"
	are permitted.

People say to use "a 911 master cylinder".  Are they all the same?  What's
the best master cylinder for me to use?  Are there any other weaknesses in
the 914 brake system that I might be able to improve upon?  I see no reason
to go to vacuum-assisted brakes, by the way.  I'd rather not go that far.

Thanks for any expertise you can provide.

Another data point for the 951 crowd:

* My head gasket blew at around 63000 miles and about 10000 miles
  after installing the Stage II (version 2.5) Autothority Chip in
  my '87.

* In Autothority's literature for the Stage III mods (340 HP) they say
  that "O-ringing the head cures the head gasket problem".

* I read somewhere that the factory racing chips [Escort etc] blew
  head gaskets too - I think Bruce Anderson wrote about it in Pano
  quite a while ago.

Didn't the last Excellence magazine have a letter from someone who blew
theirs at 12,000 miles (with the chip) ?

Sounds sort of like the belts separated on that tire.  This is visible, I
believe, on inspection of the sidewall.  Is it possible that you hit anything,
leading to this failure?

What version of the AutoThority chip was your friend running?  His problem
sounds like the same one encountered by friends running the version 2.2 chip. 
As you know, 2.5 is the latest and it is the one which, as far as I can tell,
seems to be safe.

1.9, 2.0 bar sounds like overboost, esp. if he was seeing these figures at or
near redline.  I don't know that the Escort series chips from the factory are
any less aggressive.  They might even be more aggressive, in that they were only
available to pros and not mass-marketed (relatively speaking).

Subject: 911/914 master cylinder


   I wish to upgrade the brake master cylinder in my 914 to a better one.

It is common to upgrade competative 914 to the 19mm 911 master
cylinder.  Bruce Anderson and I got into an argument about this a year
ago.  The basic idea is this:  by shifting to a larger MC you lose
some mechanical advantage (it's like moving closer to the fulcrum of a
lever), but you increase the amount of fluid the MC can move, meaning
you can use bigger calipers.  Also the reduction in mechanical
advantage makes the 914 brake pedal feel stiffer.  I know when I drive
914s at the track, I find it too easy to lock the brakes, not being an
attuned 914 driver.  The larger MC makes the pedal less sensitive, but
you have to work harder to achieve full braking.

Really the only reason to upgrade the 914 MC is if you want to use
bigger brakes (calipers).  I've put Carrera brakes on 914/6s, and I
know people put Turbo brakes on them as well.  For those who remember
Rich Luzardo's monster 914/6, I helped him install 928 brakes on that
car, with a 22mm MC.  The pedal was so stiff, and required so much
force to activate, that we were afraid the pedal would snap.  The
next step was to install a booster on it, but that was about when I
discovered his "side" business and I diassociated myself quickly.

Seriously persuing alternatives to the P7's is a good idea.  This doesn't
mean that Pirelli is a bad company.  What is means is that P7's are *OLD*
tires.  They're ancient, by modern standards.  How long has this model been
around?  Have you noticed that it has been replaced twice (by the P700, then
the P700Z)?

Use a modern tire.  You'll be much happier.  I highly recommend the BFG Comp
T/A line, though the P700Z and related tires also have great reputations.

Did you have the overboost problem problem that Steve's friend had?  If you were
seeing overboost, or no roll-off as you approached redline, there's the problem.

I spoke with Larry Bershtein this summer, and although they were advertising the
Stage III kit, they still had not finished it.  Ie, they were probably still
having problems keeping engines together.  I don't know about this so-called
o-ringing.  Last I heard they claimed a "trick" head gasket was the cure (ie,
one which the engineering staff at Porsche is too stupid to pick off the same
shelf Autothority uses... right).

> Didn't the last Excellence magazine have a letter from someone who blew
> theirs at 12,000 miles (with the chip) ?

Yeah, and coming right after Larry's letter and exonerating Autothority as it
did (no way it could have been the chip!), it sure read funny to me.

These words from Charlie Learoyd, PCA 944-series tech committee member.  He
feels that, properly done, the stock 951 engine is good up to about 300 hp.
"Properly done" means no excessive boost, rolling off the boost at higher RPM's,
no drilling the cycling valve, no shimming the waste gate.  (It was Charlie who
suggested use of an adjustable needle valve between the manifold and the control
pressure side of the cycling valve, by the way.  About a year later, they
started shipping it.)

Hello,

I just became aware of porschephiles through a message on another distribution
list.  I presently own a 1979 911SC and previously owned a 1970 914-6 2.7.

I am interested in being placed on the list.

My e-mail location is Chicago.  I am a member of PCA, Chicago Region.

I am also a vintage racer.  I vintage race a mini-cooper but travel with
three friends who race 356s.


thanks,

jim fuerstenberg.

next reply (Mark's):
 
Seriously persuing alternatives to the P7's is a good idea.  This doesn't
mean that Pirelli is a bad company.  What is means is that P7's are *OLD*
tires.  They're ancient, by modern standards.  How long has this model been
around?  Have you noticed that it has been replaced twice (by the P700, then
the P700Z)?
 
Use a modern tire.  You'll be much happier.  I highly recommend the BFG Comp
T/A line, though the P700Z and related tires also have great reputations.

my new reply:

I have not driven on the comp T/A's.  However, from what I have heard about
the hard compound tires (not the R1's), they are good if you want a long
wearing tire that may rub your fenders, and you are not planning on driving
them at the traction limit.  Traction is not particularly good and I hear (on
this list no less) that the break when they go is a bit abrupt.  The tires 
are manufactured slightly oversize (compared to all other tires with the 
same numbers on them).  But hey, they're cheap!

I agree with Mark's comments about the P7.  I remember the tire was new 
about 15 years ago (18 years ago?).  I don't agree about the company.  I
plan on NEVER driving on their tires.  Their tires are not cheap, don't 
seem to have any performance advantage, and I have seen what I consider 
significant manufacturing defects in both the low and high end tires.

I've been running the Yokohama A008 on the street and the A008rs for auto-x.
I think the rs stands for "real sticky."

I have been very happy with both.  I will mention that for my next set of 
street tires I will probably go with something a little cheaper, longer 
wearing, and less sticky.  The reason is that I just don't drive hard 
enough on the street to use all the performance I have with the A008.  I have
this strange phobia about my stopping distance becoming more than twice my 
visual range, which is what would happen if I drove those tires at their 
limit.

Oh yeah, these are on a 1980 911sc.

Subject: 911SC Questions...



I've recently had the misfortune of experiencing a charging system
failure on my '82 911SC.  First, it was an occasional flicker of the 
battery idiot light causing me to shut down and check belt tension.  
Tensions are fine.  Soon thereafter, strange things begin to happen...
Tach begins bounce around wildly at low RPM,  no more blinking of the
charging light now.  Other electrical things begin to fall offline, but
the engine still runs.  Eventually the battery is dead and the car stalls.
Fuses look good.  Assumption is that alternator is toast.  Perhaps regulator
also given strange activity from tach.

Question  1: Is alternator/voltage regulator failure commonplace on the 911
series (realizing that Porsche likes to tinker from year to year) and does
failure have a tendency to fry components that don't like the taste of AC
voltage?

My current plan is to replace both (costly, but effective) as I don't
personally have access to nifty diagnostic gear for making the
exact determination of cause.  Looks like the alternator swap will
cost somewhere between $200-300.  No clue on VR replacement yet.

Question 2: Am I brain damaged to be attempting this on my own ?(assuming
that I have the books and am a relatively accomplished mechanic though
a neophyte with Porsche).

The car's garaged at home until spring :-(, so I'm not in a really
big hurry.  

Question 3: Any special hints on proper procedure for storing a 911
for 3-4 months other than blocking it up, changing oil, full gas tank with
water-absorbant added?

Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Where to buy tires???

Hello Porsche-people,

It is time for me to get new tires and I was reading the bit Tire Update
that was posted on this list last month. The updates are great, but one
thing puzzles me: Where do you get tires at the prices listed?

I have decided on the RE71RAZ's (245/45 back 225/50 front). The 
Bridgestone message listed the 16" sizes ranging in price from $125
to $135. 

The quotes I have been getting in Portland Oregon, which include mounting
and balancing, are like:

$233/tire for the 245/45
$219/tire for the 225/50

I am a novice when it comes to getting good deals on tires. Is this
a "good" price for a local buy? Should I go mailorder? If so, where?
Are there places that will put tires on that you bring in?

Sorry if some of these questions are stupid, but a $400 difference is
worth asking dumb questions about!

Thanks much in advance...

Drew -

My first inclination, from the symptoms you describe, would be to look for a
bad/loose ground.  Rapid fluctuations in several gauges and lights almost never
reflect actual engine conditions, almost always some systemic electrical
malaise.

A friend recently had similar symptoms with his 944S.  Turned out to be a loose
ground point at the back of the engine block.  After tightening the bolt, the
poltergeists fled from his car.

If you do find a loose ground, be sure to clean things well before tightening
them down.  If it's a bolt, use some blue Loctite.  No, you're not crazy to go
after this one yourself!

Happy hunting, and let me know what you find.

Kevin

Steven -

You should check out the ads in Auto Week, Road and Track, etc. for places like
FastTire and the Tire Rack, mail-order discounters.  As you have guessed, you
have to take into consideration the total package cost: tires, shipping,
mounting and balancing.  Most tire storefronts will charge you a lot more for
the mount and balance if you walk in the door with tires.

Almost anyone has the equipment to mount tires.  Ask around among local Porsche
folk to a shop with a good reputation for mounting tires without scratching
rims.

My ususal trick is to get someone at FasTire or Tires-to-Go or somewhere
to FAX me a quote that includes shipping, and take that to the manager 
of my favorite local tire shop. If the local guy can't get to within
about 5% of tires plus shipping, he deserves for me to take my business
somewhere else.

I've also been known to take said mail ordered tires to the offending
store for mounting, making a BIG DEAL about how much better prices 
you can get by mail ordering the tires and how wonderful it is that
you can still take up their mounting bays for an hour for $10 a tire.
Never ever have I had to do this more than once at a given store 8{)

Drew,

I agree (with Kevin?) about checking for a loose ground.

I had an alternator failure on my 1980 SC just after I bought it (about 105k 
miles).

My symptoms were charge light on all the time and good belt tension.

My solution was to remove the alternator and regulator and take them to 
the local alternator shop (yellow pages).  They tested the regulator.  I had
already looked at the brushes and they were shot.  When the shop looked at 
the regulator, they pointed out that the comutator was also quite worn.

Having my own alternator rebuilt, which I believe consisted of replacing the
brushes, other contact surfaces, and bearings, cost $77.  This is probably 
what is done to any rebuilt alternator that you buy.  So far, mine is working
fine.  It's been about 20k miles.

If you do it yourself:

      There are some vanes behind the alternator.  The location is important.
      MARK the location of the parts as you remove them.  It will make your
      life much easier.  Ditto for the wire connections.

      I took the alternator into the shop with the fan still attached.  The 
      shop broke a blade on the fan.  They replaced the fan ($200), but it 
      took another day for them to get it.  You need a puller (or a trick I
      don't know) to remove the fan.  Don't pound or pry...  The shop may or
      may not accept the thing with the fan attached.  My local shop won't 
      any more ;-).

      Disconnect the NEGATIVE battery terminal before starting ANY electrical
      work.  This keeps you from welding a wrench to your car...

In regard to a trick required to get the fan off a 911 alternator...

I just rebuilt the alternator on my '77 930 and found an easy way to
do this using a simple hand-made tool. Assuming all fans are built like
mine, this is how I did it. First, go to the local hardware store and
get some of the perforated galvanized steel tape that's used to fasten
pipes to studs in houses. It's about 3/4" wide and has 2 sizes of holes
that alternate at periodic intervals. Cut 2 pieces of this about 5 inches
long. Put the 2 pieces together face to face to double the strength. Next,
put a fairly large bolt (about 1/4") through the hole in the center of
the strip. This will be the "pusher" bolt. Put a nut on the other side for
something to push against.

Now the tricky part. Get 2 "puller" bolts about 3/16" in diameter and about 1"
long, along with their matching nuts.
The bolts have to be just thin enough to slip through the holes in the fan
that are around the shaft.
The nuts can't be thicker than about 1/8 inch.
Now, take the whole
alternator/fan assembly and set it on a table with the fan down. Drop one of
the nuts in between the inside of the fan and the outside of the alternator.
Then, pick up the alternator and, while holding it with the fan down, shake
it until the nut lines-up behind one of the holes around the shaft. Have a
helper stick a small screwdriver through the hole to hold the nut, then
flip the alternator over with the fan up. You can now take one of the 3/16"
bolts slip it through one of the outside holes in the steel tape, and thread it
into the bolt behind the fan. This gives you half of your puller. The process
is then repeated with the other nut. The finished assembly can then be used
just like a gear puller to push the shaft out of the fan. It looks like this:


                                    1/4" bolt
                     ~3/16" bolt       ---

                 |
      3/16" nut -
    (dropped in from rear)



The key to the operation is dropping the nuts in behind the fan. This
worked great for me and didn't damage anything. I needed to get the
fan off to replace some noisy bearings and didn't have any electrical
problems.

This is a request for advice.

I have what I think is a ground problem on my 1979 SC.  The symptoms are as
follows:

seat belt warning light tends to come on when I accelerate away from a 
stop.

the wipers trigger for one cycle intermittently, usually when I pull away
>from a stop.

the headlights H-4 (55/100) brighten when I increase revs.

the battery charges just fine and the car runs fine otherwise ( except for 
what I think is a defective cold start valve) hard cold weather starting,  but
the warm-up cycle operates correctly. uh... make that 2 problems.

I welcome any suggestions.

Sorry I missed the past postings of these electrical problems.

You probably have a bad ground, as suggested by others.  But a bad
ground can blow your voltage regulator, this in turn can fry the rest
of your electrical system, so you may have more than one problem.

First thing to do:

Go to every ground strap on the car and remove it (this includes BOTH
ends of the battery ground), the transmission -> body ground, and the
ground on the alternator.  There are a few other less important ones
in the left of the engine bay, and the head&parking lights each have
their own ground.  There is a diagram in the parts manual that shows
all the ground points (I am reciting it from memory which isn't
accurate...). 

Remove the battery (s).  Clean and wash the area around the battery well.
A blown VR will boil the battery.

Clean the daylights out of the straps and the places it makes contact,
especially on the battery terminals.  Make sure there are washers on
top of them holding them down for good contact.

Remove each fuse (one at a time so you don't lose your place) and
clean both ends of the fuse, and the terminals.  This includes the
engine bay fuses.

Now you probably have a clean electrical system.  Hook up a voltmeter
and see if the voltage fluctuates by much.  I think the acceptable
range is up to 14 volts, but it shouldn't fluctuate wildy even within
that range, if it does replace the regulator.

Hope this helps.

Glen -

I know my mechanic orders OEM stuff made by Lobro, Zimmerman, ZF, Sachs, ATE,
FAG, etc. from a few distributers.  Apparently these distributers only deal with
shops placing orders worth many thousands of dollars, ie, high volume.  They
import the stuff by the container-load.

Since you're local, perhaps he (my mechanic) could help you.

Subject: 911sc FI questions
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu



I've got a question for any FI gurus out there...

My car, 1980 911sc, has been getting hard to start in the mornings.

Symptoms:
      Engine fires and runs briefly, then dies.  The engine speed prior to 
      dying is low, perhaps 400 rpm.  This happens (typically) 2 or 3 times
      before the idle speed picks up and the car runs.  Once the idle picks
      up, the car runs fine.  When the idle does pick up, it is like a 
      switch was closed, the effect is very distinct and repeatable.  I have
      the feeling that if the fuel system would start out in the condition/
      configuration is achieves when the engine runs, this would not be 
      happening.

My suspicions:
      I suspect the warm up regulator or the cold start valve.  The WUR is
      my first guess as I believe it controls the CSV.  I've also heard bad
      things about the WUR for this model.  One person said "oh yes, thats the
      warm up reg, replace it with the later model" ('81 or '83).  However,
      at $250 (automotion), I'm not about to use the shotgun approach.

Questions:
      Aside from the obvious (what's wrong?), is there a sensor someplace 
      that could be causing this problem, i.e. WUR and CVS ok, but getting
      bad information about engine condition?

Oh yeah, the problem seems to be getting worse with time, or maybe it's 
just getting colder...

Sounds like the warm-up regulator.

The pin in the regulator could be out of position, which could be
corrected by simply disassembling and reassembling properly.

The best way to tell if it is the regulator is to obtain a CIS fuel
pressure gauge (two hoses, a tee, and a valve) and compare the control
pressure change with the warm-up cycle listed in the service manual.

In the latest "Upfixin der Porsche" (available from the PCA national
office), there is a modification procedure to make the regulator
adjustable.  This is a refinement to the "knocking the plug" technique
of changing the control pressure for a cold engine.

The modification is cheap (Do-It-Yourself) and works.

Good luck...

Soren -

I would go with George's suggestions.  To answer one of your questions, there
are two other sensors which come into play on a K-Jet car.  The first is the
thermo-time switch.  Its job is to inhibit the warm-up regulator (and thus the
cold-start injection) if the engine is already warm.  The switch is mounted to
the engine.

And there is an auxilliary air device, whose job it is to allow a little
unmetered air around the throttle when the engine is cold.

Happy hunting.

Kevin

Small amount of radiator fluid is running out of the clutch housing. Any ideas
what the problem may be?

thanks in advance,

Tassos -

The 944 and 951 have their heater valve at the back of the block.  This is a
vacuum-controlled valve which regulates passenger compartment heat.  It
eventually leaks coolant and is easy to replace.  The part costs $25 - 30.

However, because of its position, it leaks onto the clutch bell housing and will
enter it and destroy your clutch.  You are probably seeing fluid which has gone
through.  (I think there is an open port in the top of the housing.)  Big bucks.
Get the valve fixed ASAP, and have your clutch checked for damage.  This
happened to a friend's 951, under warranty, and PCNA ate the clutch.

By the way, on the 944S (and I think S2), the valve is relocated to the front of
the engine, and sits right next to the oil filter.  I can guess why.

 I have the same starting symptoms with my SC as Soren does.  My thought was
 that it was not the warm up regulator but the cold start valve.  My basis
 for this possibly erroneous thought was that the once the car is started the
 warm up cycle works perfectly and it is only in getting it started that it
 demonstrates the symptoms Soren describes.

Amen on clutch repairs to a 944Turbo, prepare to make your credit cards or
checkbook bleed.  According to my friendly mechanic, one had to drop 
the whole rear suspension, the torque tube and perform numerous time consuming
chores plus the price of the clutch parts.  One could spend $3000+ on a clutch
replacement.  Hope you do not.

Jim -

It's not quite that bad, financially.  You do indeed have to drop the
transmission and move the torque tube.  You don't have to drop the rear
suspension per se.

The whole job takes about 8 - 10 hours, I am told.  So you're looking at that
much labour plus parts.

Soren and James -

Checking the cold start injection is pretty straightforward.  I did this on my
wife's KE-Motronic Jetta 16V last winter.  The procedure to follow is described
very well in Probst's "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management" book.  It is
NOT a) removed the valve b) stick it in a jar c) start the engine!

If you do as he suggests, you'll not only diagnose the timing and overall
function of the system, but you'll also see what a good (or perhaps bad)
injector spray pattern looks like.  No special tools needed.

Happy hunting, and let us know what you find.

Kevin
