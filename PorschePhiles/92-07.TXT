Subject: Driving School

Folks,

I received an offer from the local Porsche dealer to attend a "one day high
performance driving school" run by CSK Sports, Inc at the Blackhawk Farms
Racetrack not far from Chicago.  The cost is $400 for the day (bring your
own car).  

Is that a lot of money?  I mean, I know what $400 is worth, but is that a
lot of money for a day of driving school?  Anyone ever heard of CSK Sports?


They say space is limited to 20 students.  Anything I should ask about if I
call them for more info?

Assuming I don't hit anything, how hard is this likely to be on my car?

Assuming I've never done anything like this before, do folks think its
worth doing?

Thanks

Chris

Driving schools are definitely worth doing, but $400 is rather steep
(especially if this is your first time doing this sort of thing). 

I think the Chicago Porsche Club sponsors events at Blackhawk and I'm
almost positive that the cost will be _much_ less (probably < $100/day).
They also sponsor events up at Rd. America (they usually have one on
Labor Day weekend). I believe a local sports car association (don't
recall the name: Midwest Sports Car Assoc?) also has weekday events at
Blackhawk that are relatively inexpensive.

It could be that this event is worth the money (20 students is low so
you'll probably get a lot of track time), but you're probably better off
contacting the local PCA (and _join_ if you haven't already!) and
getting introduced to high performace driving via the PCA.

But be careful: high performace driving is addictive!

Yes, it's worth doing.  I learned more in one day at Lime Rock Park than I did
in 25 years of driving before that.

$400 is way too much.

Join the PCA and go to driver's education for 65-80 dollars per day.

Yes, you will push the car, but, if your car is a well-maintained
late model (1982 and newer) Porsche, you will not come close to the limits
that the car is designed for.

Subject: Your Monthly Update....

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

My travel schedule isn't letting up. Which sucks, because Avis doesn't
rent 911s! Anyway, list maintenence will be infrequent unless I get lucky and 8
have more time. Please keep this in mind if you have problems.

Phil Katz, in the UK, notes an interesting problem. It seems that some
of you are sending out messages written in some sort of auto-wrap mode
that gives you an on-screen view that your message is less than 80 chars
per line, but it's really one *REALLY* long line. The problem with this?
One of the mail gateways out of the US truncated messages at 132 chars
per line. PLEASE BE SENSITIVE TO THIS IN THE FUTURE.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA. 
If you happen to have on-line copies of your regional newsletter, or
at least the interesting articles, maybe we can set up an article exchange.
Or, if you'd like to write something or have something written that you'd like
to see in print outside of your own region, let me know....

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

I bought a car cover two years ago, and I use it most days I take
my 911 to work.  Judging by the amount the cover has faded, I'm
doing my paint and interior a big favor.

I have a Covercraft polycotton flannel cover.  It cost about
$100 at a local store.  I also bought a lock and cable, but I've
never used them.  Whatever you decide on, get a cover with stretch
material at the front and back.  Mine has this, and it has never
blown off.

I don't cover the car if it looks like there might be rain, simply
because a wet cover is a major hassle.  But, it never rains in 
California.

Let me pass on a tip I got from someone:
When removing the cover, unhook the front and back ends off your 
bumpers. Then, flip the sides up all the way onto your hood and roof.  
Then, roll or fold the cover starting from the back, working towards 
the hood.  You'll end up with the cover neatly on your hood.  To put 
the cover back on, reverse the process.

This keeps you from sliding the cover so that any dust or dirt 
won't scratch your paint.  Also, if you do this consistently, you 
won't put your cover on backwards (or inside out) and look like an 
idiot to the crowd of admirers.

Chris,

$400 is a terrible deal for one day at blackhawk.  You can rent the whole
track for yourself for $600...

Porsche Club, Chicago Region has lapping days at Blackhawk for about $85-90.

Even Porsche club at Road America is only about $200 for TWO days.

For $400, they should supply the car.

If you would like more info on Porsche Club events, call me at 

(708) 394-3952 eves, or (312) 825-6818 during the day.

The PCA events at Blackhawk divided drivers into three groups based on 
experience and performance potential of the car.  There is free instruction
in the morning for beginners ( I have taught).

You get about 4 one-half hour sessions on the track.  This is a lot of time
for one day.  You should bring extra brake pads and brake bleeding tools.

They also accept other cars, there being enough space.  Last year at one 
event, I brought my mini (faster than most of the 911s) and a friend brought
his Landar D/SR (faster than damn near everything).  There were also an NSX,
an F40 and a ZR1 (my student).

These event are relaxed and a lot of fun....

Actually '66 911S do exist.  I have one and there's documentd proof to back
it up.  My car was originally a German car that was brought to this country
in late '68.  I found out about my car after numerous times of trying to get
various suspension bits and pieces to fit correctly while rebuilding the
suspension.  It seemed that the dimensions were those of the "S" model and 
not of the standard 911 model.  Also the car had 3 of the 4 lead weight in
the nose that are supposed to be in the "S".  After doing some research I
found that in late 1966 model year, Porsche had number of european orders but
was missing some parts to complete them.  They were starting to ramp up
production on the '67 model years and had bits and pieces ready for those, so
they just used what was available and created a ew 1966 911 S vehicles.
These were only available in the european market since all the US spec
vehicles had been built.  My car has the thicker torsen bars, bigger antisway
bars, higher output 2.0 litre engine with Webers and nitrated cams, "S"
pistons, sport guages, weighted front nose, and the large philips head bolts
below the rear windows for attaching the factory roll cage that fits on the
911S from '67 to '68, also it has the electric factory sunroof.

There were about 35  '66 model year 911S' built, all originally went to the
european market.  

I'll forward this to the list since it might be of interest to others....

Subject: Inner Loop at Watkin's Glen

Zone 1 of PCA ran a drivers school at Watkin's Glen last weekend 
(July 3,4,5), and we ran the new "inner loop" at the end of the
back straight. I thought that both the "porschephiles" group and
the "schools" group would be interested. Please excuse the duplication
if you subscribe to both.

First, a few points about the inner loop itself (or the "suitcase",
as some are calling it). For those of you who haven't been following
the discussion, Watkin's Glen has installed what is effectively a
chicane in the back straight shortly before the old turn 5 as a way
to reduce speeds there. The primary motivation appears to be a recent
rash of serious accidents there, including J. McDuffie's fatal accident.
The basic layout is an offset section of the straight parallel to the
old straight and perhaps 100 feet to the right, with a right-left pair
of corners to get from the old straight to the new, and then a left-right
pair of corners several hundred feet later which returns you to the
old straight just before the entrance to turn 5.

There has been previous discussion as to whether everyone would use the
inner loop, or if club events might be able to skip it. Based on our
experience, it looks like everyone will use it. However, the old main
straight continues, and is (at present) only blocked by cones, so
nothing physically prevents its use. In fact, it acts as an escape
road. If you used it last weekend, the RCA workers treated it as an
"off course", and expected you to use standard, flagger guided course
re-entry procedures. Someone mentioned that at a recent race which used
the inner loop, each driver was allowed one free "forgetfulness",
as long as they didn't pass anyone who was in the loop. 

Someone reported recently that the flag station at turn 5 had been moved
to the outside. I talked to the flagger there on Friday, and he said
that they moved it temporarily due to the lack of suitable protection,
but it was back on the inside last weekend, and the flagger said it
is expected to stay there.

The design has been changed within the last
few weeks. Previous reports from PCA schools at the Glen a few weeks
ago indicated that the entry and exit to the loop was very tight.
These previous schools did not use the loop, but had a chance to
study it as it was being built. Both the entry (the first right hander)
and the exit (the second right hander) have had their apexes moved
back what looks like 20 feet, as judged by the different paving.

Driving the inner loop is better than I expected it to be. The length
is such that it can be taken in one smooth arc connecting the two
left hander apexes and still clear the exiting right hand apex,
and the resulting exit angle is such that there is no great danger of
leaving the track on the left side of the old main straight (although
someone with a bazillion HP car managed to do it at our school).
You do carry most of the way to the left hand edge, which makes the
entry to (old) turn 5 somewhat different (at least for me). I was
pleasantly surprised that you can carry enough speed out of the inner
loop to make (old) turn 5 interesting. In an unprepared car with
R series tires I could get out of the inner loop at 75-80 MPH, which
was plenty. I had to feather the throttle somewhat. One interesting
problem for many was where to shift. The 70 MPH or so (I didn't look)
in the middle of the inner loop calls for 3rd gear (in most Porsches),
but you run out of 3rd gear (90 MPH or so in most Porsches) before
the exit to (old) turn 5. There is no place you are straight for a shift
between exiting the inner loop and entering turn 5. Some tried the
inner loop in 4th, giving up some acceleration coming out, and some
tried to manufacture a bit of straight for a shift between the exit
of the inner loop and the entry to 5. Time will tell.

An interesting challenge for me was remembering the inner loop was there.
The view up the straight is relatively unchanged except for the cones.
Once I am on the back straight I go into "automatic" mode while I check
gauges, etc. and manage traffic, and on several occasions I almost
forgot to brake in time. Yes, there are new, large braking markers.

The inner loop seems to cost about 4 Sec. per lap in a street car,
by a very rough non-back-to-back comparison (about 2:30 flat before,
low 2:34's after).

Overall, I found the inner loop a pleasant surprise. It seems to reduce
the danger without turning (old) turn 5 into a non-turn. I am assuming
the same will happen for the race cars, where turn 5 is a lot faster,
but they will presumably do the inner loop faster as well. All-in-all
an excellent job.

Bad injector seals? Bad fuel line? Depends on where the leaks were.

In general, though, if CIS components have sit around for long time without 
fuel in them, they should be considered suspect. CIS is great stuff, but is 
MUCH more susceptible to contamination induced failure than the pulsed 
injection systems.

Subject: 914 Exhaust mods

A buddy of mine recently saw a couple 914's that had modified
exhausts.  Instead of having the four (two on each side) exhaust pipes
combine into a single muffler in the back, they went through two
parallel glasspack mufflers and then straight out the back, like so:

            /===           ===\
           //     headers     \\
           || /=           =\ ||
           ||//             \\||
           ||||             ||||
           \  / Y-connectors\  /
            ||               ||
            ||               ||
           /  \             /  \
           |  |  glasspacks |  |
           \  /             \  /
            ||               ||
            ||               ||
            ||   tailpipes   ||

I was thinking about trying a setup like this, but I thought I'd ask
those with more experience in such things on the net what they thought
about it first.  My primary motiviation is that I like the sound I
hear from glasspacks on other cars, although it also seems like with
this sort of direct flow setup, there could be a performance boost
also.

Some specific questions:

*  Can I buy headers with the right bolt patterns, etc., cheaply so
that I don't have to cut up my current heat exchanger assembly where
the pipes would go into the Y?  I want to be able to swicth back to
stock in the future if I need to, and I know those heat exhangers can
cost an arm and a leg.  The bolt pattern on my headers is the rounded
one found on the 1.7 litre engines, although my engine is actually a 2.0.

*  Do I need to worry about airflow issues when I remover the heat
exchangers?  Obviously I won't have interior heat, but that's ok with
me.  I'm more concerned about whether this could pose a problem for
engine cooling.

*  Any other issues I should consider?

Thanks in advance!

Get a look at Bruce Anderson's book.  As I understand this stuff there
*is* a science to it.  The setup you saw may sound great but could
actually cause a performance loss.  I know that they spent a bunch of
time and dyno hours at Garrettsons (Bruce Anderson's old shop)
perfecting a tuned exhaust for their race cars (914 and 914-6?).a  It
didn't look anything like your schematic.

You want equal length exhaust pipes for each cyl and as
non-restrictive mufflers as you can get away with.  If I remember,
4-cyl engines are more touchy about this than bigger engines.

I use a similar setup on my ITA car, except I use SuperTraps bolted
directly to the ends of the stock exhaust header minus the heat exchanger.

I know Performance Products and I think Automotion have special
header systems for 914s. And there is some guy in New MExico who advertises
in Panorama for a similar system.

Nope. That's all fine.

> *  Any other issues I should consider?

You bet. It's gonna screw up your fuel injection like there's no tomorrow.
The manifold pressure will change as the breathing characteristics of the
engine change. We had to do all sorts of stuff to accommodate this. If you're
running carbs, you'll have to re-jet as well. (Don't run carbs. Just don't.)

Hi, 

I just bought a '73 914 2.0 with the sports and appearance packages. It has
relatively few miles and is in great shape.  I see that quite  a few people
on the list have 914's and I was hoping that I could get a few suggestions
as to where I could get parts and information.  I would like to set the car
up for mild autocrossing or something like that and also find out about getting
into the sport. 

Also I was wondering if any one could pinpoint a cold start problem from written
symptoms.  It will always start, but then die in a few seconds. After the third
try it will keep running and after a minute or so I can give throttle without
killing the engine. A start after the car has been driven for a while will usually
be trouble free.  It has new hoses, new fuel injection trigger points, new ignition
points, etc. I understand that the cold start problem could be the temp sender,
the aux. air valve, or the fuel pressure regulator, or ???. Does anyone have
some suggestions on how to test these things?  

Forgive me for asking so many questions ...

Are koni shocks better than the bilstiens or visa-versa?  Has anyone played
with installing one of the Tilton proportioning valves on the brakes rather
than the original? I'm trying to cure the sponginess in the brakes.
Also my driver side window rattles ... is this associated with a common problem
etc.

thanks in advance for any info.

Both are good shocks.

If you plan on keeping the car street legal you may want to consider not
making the suspension rock hard.  Koni's, even adjusted in the softer
setting are not comfortable on the street.  Maybe you live somewhere where
the roads are smooth and it doesn't matter as much?

The point is that you can use something like KYB's on stock torsion bars
and coil springs, with aftermarket anti-sway bars, sticky tires, a good
alignment, and still get go-cart like handling from your 914.  The car will
have minimum body roll and your tape deck wont vibrate out of the dash.

  the question asked was "given your earlier "don't use carbs" remark,

Nope. I don't like them because they don't work as well. For the street,
they're fine. But on the track or in autocross, they suck. Think about
it: They're supposed to. 8{)

Carbs work based on a Bernoulli venturi suctioning gas from a bowl through
a metering jet.  Here we have the root problems: bowl size and bowl capacity 
management.  The bowl size for any "street carb" can be depleted almost 
instantaneously by a properly jetted carb on a transition from say about 
3000 RPM to wide open throttle. Well, carb fans say, you can deal with that 
by bigger gas lines and slightly higher pump pressure. Which is where you 
hit the next problem: the "floats" *don't* under high G forces. Which for 
our purposes seem to be about .6 G. Or about half what you'd need for 
autocross and about a third what you  need for serious racing.

Also unless you have a throat per cylinder, you have a gas distribution
problem, i.e. the cylinders nearest the carb will run rich and the ones
furtherest away will run rich. And, if you have a throat per cylinder, you
have the often mentioned synchronization problem (which isn't too hard
to beat but does take a *LOT* of work each time you mess with the carbs.
Which, if you're doing the performance thing, is frequently.)

You also can get cylinder wash-down from running over-rich, you get fuel
seperation where the gas-air atomized mix becomes air with gas dropping
out and running down the manifold walls. Nasty, nasty stuff, on the whole.

If carbs are so great, why was the last Porsche to have carbs from the 
factory the '71 911T? And when was the last time you saw an Indy, F1, or 
IMSA GTP car with carbs? Ever wonder why? See the first part of this note.

You don't get any of this with fuel injection. But you get a whole different
set of problems, and it frankly is easier to bolt on a set of carbs and
notice how, on the street, they work a lot better than an incorrectly
calibrated FI system. Which is the real problem: no one (well, almost
no one) *REALLY* knows how to work on FI systems. Certainly not the early 
FI systems.

Hi everybody,

*Yes.  This is the same '78 SC that was pinging a couple of months ago.
Well, my mechanic tells me that the magnets in the distributor have
been re-glued and that causes the sparcs to jump around at higher
rpm and therefore the pinging.  He says this part that has the magnets
on it is not available and I have to buy a new distributor.  What do I do?
How much should I expect to pay for a new/used distributor?

*Remember how the car would just dies when hot?  Well the mech. thinks it's

Stan,
It's hard for me to discuss your earlier message about carbs point-by-point
(or paragraph-by paragraph), because I somewhat agree with most of your
points, but not with the final conclusion!

no arguments here. One small remark, though: there are some dual-throat
Webers around that you can get, which give you enough bowl capacity, and
one throat per cylinder. 

>Also unless you have a throat per cylinder, you have a gas distribution
>problem, i.e. the cylinders nearest the carb will run rich and the ones

See above. I also agree that synchronising a set of twin Webers is a lot of
work (I've never actually done it, I watched my mechanic do it once), but
once they're set up, there's no need to do it again, under normal
circumstances. Although I didn't autocross my 914, I ran the same carb
setup for a couple of years with no need to adjust it (they always came up
fine during tune-ups).

Unless your carbs are properly set up and synchronised.

Can't fight progress!! :-) :-)

Now you're hitting on the _main_ problem:

That's exactly it! Frankly, I got tired of the fuel injection on the 914. I
blew a couple of "black boxes", and It was hard to get it tuned properly. I
didn't know anybody who could do anything with the 914 and early 911 FI (I
still don't). I would've loved to get an aftermarket FI system on it, but I
was too intimidated, and I didn't have the right equipment. Even now that
I've worked on the Electromotive FI, I still wouldn't be able to install it
on a car, mainly because I don't have ready access to a dyno or a laptop.
It takes a long time to get correct calibration, even with a dyno. And, as
you say, an incorrectly calibrated FI system is useless: won't idle, won't
accelerate properly, knocks all over the place, etc...

So, here's where our conclusions differ: if you can get your hands on a
dyno and a laptop PC, then by all means go ahead and install and
aftermarket FI. They're worth it. We got >15% in HP from a carburetted bike
engine that way. Plus you can always have different maps stored for
different engine characteristics, and it takes a couple of seconds to
download a map, as opposed to the time it takes re-jetting and re-tuning
carbs for different tracks. Otherwise, stick to a set of good carbs,
preferrably dual throats and synchronised, esp. if you're not going to do a
lot of racing, and a lot of different tracks. Hope these two point of views
(points of views? points of views?) help. Take care.

On the 924 and 944 I owned, this this was due to failure of the  5th injector 
(part of the cold start system, injects some fuel into the airstream early)
not coming on correctly.  There's a thermal sensor that I had go out once... 

On the 924, I put in a manual override switch under the dash, that directly 
switched the injector on, and got used to leaning on the switch for a couple
of seconds when starting the car cold... a hack, but cheaper than the
replacement parts.

Regrettably, it's been a while, and I've never been under the hood of a 944S,
so I'm unlikely to be of much help debugging beyond that...

Welcome to the 914 autocrosser's club!

Okay.  Where are you located?  I can probably put you in touch with an SCCA
autocrosser from your area.  Perhaps there is a PCA autocrosser from your
area right here on porschephiles.

There is an autocrosser's mailing list, with 268 members at the moment.

> Are koni shocks better than the bilstiens or visa-versa?

Yes and no.  I firmly believe that Bilsteins are the best shocks on the
market, bar none.  Their design concept is simply better than anyone else's,
for a number of reasons.

Koni's, however, are adjustable.  If you plan to autocross, this is a big
win.  I've got Koni Sport Yellow's in my '73 2.0, along with stiffer torsion
bars and springs, plastic suspension and sway bar bushings, adjustable front
sway bar drop links, and that sort of stuff.

Konis and Bilsteins are about the same price, and they're more expensive
than everyone else.  You get what you pay for.  Konis also have a lifetime
warranty, dunno about the others.

Someone else recommended just going with cheaper shocks, but upgrading your
sway bars.  I disagree.  While the front sway bar can freely be changed in
SCCA Stock category for autocrossing, in reality it's not the right thing to
do with a car like this.  Sway bars eliminate the advantages of independent
suspension.  A bigger rear bar will also increase wheelspin.  The car is so
low, and the center of mass so low, that big sway bars shouldn't be
necessary.  I recommend getting Konis or Bilsteins, which have adjustable
spring perches in the rear, and lowering the car down.  Lower the front to
match, or perhaps even further if you want to install the bump steer kit.
That will take care of body roll, and you can still use the stock sway bars.

I've got 140# rear springs and 21mm front torsion bars with the stock sway
bars, and it's not as stiff as I thought it would be...  It's really still
quite reasonable.  I do have a bit of an oversteer tendency, still, so I may
have to go with bigger rear tires or a stiffer front sway bar, but first I'm
going to try a little more toe-in in the rear (currently at zero) to see if
I can fix it cheaply.  I will also move the battery to the front to see if
that helps.

Hope that helps...

The 944S does not have a separate cold start injector. The system increases
the length of the pulses to the standard injectors for cold start. The
first order control is from the water temp. sensor, so I would start
there, including verifying the wiring back to the brain box (measure
the resistance to the appropriate pin on the brain box connector).
If that is ok, there is also an air temp sensor in the airflow sensor box.
Do the same thing (measure resistance at the brain box). PCNA publishes
DME diagnostic books, and they have one for the 944S. Ask your dealer to
see the list, and the dealer can order it (about $8, if I recollect).
It has appropriate parts of the car's schematic, descriptions of the tests
and expected results, charts of symptoms and appropriate tests, etc.

I had a similar but perhaps not identical problem with my 87 944S where it
was occasionally hard to start either hot or cold. I went through all
of the sensor diagnostics, etc. without finding anything. Finally I
gave up and added, if I recollect accurately, a shunt resistor to
the load resistor in the brain box associated with the water temp.
sensor, thereby increasing the mixture enrichment. That worked splendidly.
I don't think you will get a shop to do this for you, and if you do
it yourself you are playing with a $1000 or so (I think) brain box
so you better be relatively confident in your abilities. I would
suggest that you start with checking all of the relevant sensors,
and if they are ok and you are interested in duplicating my fix I will
dig up exactly what I did and send it to you.

There are really two choices for an overall manual. The first is from
Haynes, and costs about $15 or so. It is useful to have, but covers a
great deal less than the factory manuals. The second choice is the
factory manuals. The factory manuals are available from a number of
sources other than the dealer, and my recollection of prices I have 
seen recently is in the $200 range. I purchased the 6 volume set of
944 manuals about 2 years ago. The aftermarket prices were in the same
$200 range, and to my surprise my local dealer undercut them significantly
(about $160 plus tax). This included the PCA 10% discount many dealers
give (if you are not a member of PCA, join).

Overall, I would buy the Haynes manual if you only plan occasional,
relatively simple maintenance on your own car. If you plan to tackle
everything that comes by yourself, buy the factory manuals, but at
least price them at one or more dealers.

You can also try various PCA swap meets.  I found a copy of the $250

Well, I was just a little bit too late.  But I still have hope.  And Haynes.

I just picked up my set last week. What a great source of info! For
me they have really enhanced my appreciation of the mechanics of
my 944. I thought about buying a used set but it's nice to get all
of the updates. If you order them from a dealer you get all the
supplements and service info up to date and you become a registered
owner and will be notified of new service bulletin releases. I paid
$180 with my PCA discount and received them three days after I placed
the order. I was going to order them from Kempton Bros. but they said
they had the four volume set - don't buy them! That's the older set and
they still want $200. If you buy a new set go through the dealer.

Subject: A rotisserie for 914 body restoration


   *** THE 914 ROTISSERIE ***

   For those of you out there who have expressed interest in my very own
  designed labor saving device and underbody inspection aid, this is for you.

   What it does:
    Allows the proud owner to upfix der porsche's underside (engine and trans
   removed), 360 degree rotation of body on front-rear axis.
    Stops provided to lock body in 90 degree increments, one-person operation.
    
   Why?
    In restoring a body it may be necessary to "patch" or replace panels and
   or other structures inside or outside the body. Fusion welding is normally 
   employed to join the replacements to the affected areas.  The surfaces to
   be fused don't always present an ideal welding site and may require the
   weldor to perform the task in an inverted or other difficult orientation.
    This is known as "out of position" welding and places the heaviest demand
   on the skills of the weldor to maintain a dependable weld.
    The rotisserie aids in this process by allowing the weldor to better 
   position the site, this also tends to improve access.  It also lessens the
   degree of skill required since "in position" welding is simpler to master.

   Who needs it?
   Abstract:
    My design allows the body to rest approximately 24" off the floor, (center
   of gravity shifts as components removed) in normal orientation -feet down.
    In many instances, the car can be worked on while sitting on a chair or
   standing upright... this reduces fatigue and greatly improves access to
   a variety of areas.  A good example of this is in working on the front
   struts, i was able to remove and replace the ball joints, tie rod ends,
   and shock cartridge while sitting on a stool.  The same is true of the
   rear suspension which can be completely removed while leaving the sway 
   bars intact, which saves one from pounding out the ball and socket.

   Possible disadvantages of this design:
     Some tradeoffs had to be made in the design.  Access to some portions
   is restricted because of the structural needs and placement of mount points
     These include the front suspension rack, floorpan, and engine mounts.
     This could be avoided by removing the rack before attaching the roto-
   frame (if necessary), the floorpan access can be made from within the 
   cockpit after removal of the interior.  If the forward engine mounts
   are in need of work, another means of attaching the rotoframe near this
   point would be needed (the forward mounts are used by the rotoframe).

     Weight:  I tried to keep weight to a minimum without affecting performanc
   of the framework, but the frame still weighs in at near 200 pounds.
     The stanchions at either end of the rotoframe are of hefty construction
   contributing to the total weight of over 300 pounds (estimated).

     Bulk:    The frame spans the entire lenght of the 914 plus room for 
   rotation plus room for the stanchions and their supporting legs total
   length is around 20 feet.  This could be a problem if your shop is a
   'one holer' garage (mine is a 1 1/2).  Flatness and level of the floor
   is not critical, but still important.

     Another note; the rotoframe is at this time in one piece as it was
   90% assembled "in place".  I will probably cut it in two for shipping
   purposes and ease the attachment to the car.  In mounting the frame, lift 
   up to the car and bolt on, then lift the entire assembly at least
   30" off the floor to meet the swivel points.  This is very hazardous
   unless you have a hoist or big jack capable of lifting to this height
   both ends of the car.  Disaster could result if tipped, a sheepish
   explanation to your insurance person or nurse if this should happen.

     Legalities:
     Should you kill yourself or your car with this device, well, sorry
   about that chief...you got it "as is"  with no other warranty than
   replacement of failed components due to workmanship or materials.
   I have verified the design with a mechanical engineer, and followed
   safety guidlines in welding and reinforcement of the structure, but as 
   with most things, your mileage may vary and alcohol may intensify the
   effect blah, blah, blah...    
  I cant offer any more than that, Oh, if you are re-doing a '49 packard

porschephile moderator, Stan Hanks (stan@casc.math.uh.edu) will be 
working in the area (sort of) and may drop in (sorry Stan, I don't know
when the Newsletter Editors' seminar will be). Walt Thode 
(thode@nprdc.navy.mil) says he will probably come down and prowl around 
to see what's happening. Last, but not least, new PCA member Pete 
Gregory (pete@wvus.org) wants to see first-hand the ultimate PCA event.

The locations for the main events are:
   Host Hotel: Town & Country Hotel on Hotel Circle.
   Concours: Playa Pacifica Park which is on Mission Bay (the east 
             side, as near as I can tell from a map)
   Rally: Somewhere in the area (but probably not too far west).
   Autocross: San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (I'm not sure if they will
              try to limit access to Parade participants)

For everyone's benefit, I'll give the schedule of events and the names 
of the people putting on the Parade. I apologize for any errors in the

Subject: 911 static and air

Just a general question for the list...

I have an unusual but minor problem with my 79SC.  When I step on the brake
pedal, I get static in the radio.  The static is less when I step harder on
the brake and peaks at about 1/3 pressure.

I guess I could probably solve it by putting a noise suppressor in the radio
power line, but it seems like a strange problem.

BTW, has anyone had any experience with the rotary compressor upgrade kit
>from ICE?  I feel that I may need one soon, although we will see how the
latest recharge works once I dig up a new high pressure line (NOT FROM A
PORSCHE dealer) the whole rotary compressor upgrade would probably cost less.

Subject: 914: moving the battery

Question: Is it a good idea for me to move the battery in my 914 from the
stock location to the front trunk?  This would help weight balance and would
place the battery weight much lower, theoretically helping handling, and
really wouldn't be much worse for moment of inertia.  Any thoughts on the
merits of this would be appreciated.

If I do this, how do I go about it?  I would need some kind of battery box and
a way of mounting it, as well as the appropriate cables.  Has anyone done
this?  What did it involve in terms of parts, labor, and money?  Thanks for
your help.

Subject: flat-four intake systems

Okay, so I am still working on coming up with a new fuel injection system for
the 914.  I've studied a bunch of systems on the market, and have a good idea
what's out there and what I'm looking for.  Much research is still needed,
however.

One approach is to use Stan's upcoming system, which is largely based on the
stock D-Jet.  Another is to go to an all-new system, such as the Electromotive
TEC-II.  A third is to start with something clean and elegant, like Bosch
LH-Motronic, and make it work on the 914.

The latter two systems have some real logistical problems.  Intake manifolds,
for instance.  For best throttle response, the air metering system and the
throttle should be as close to the intake ports as possible.  Therefore, it
makes most sense to have separate throttles and meters for each side of the
engine.  That means dual throttles and dual air meters (whether it's a
hot-wire anemometer, or whatever).  This is a problem mostly because most of
the aftermarket systems are not prepared to handle dual inputs.  Will I need
a separate computer for each side?  This is sounding expensive.

Question -- what do the latest Carrera motors do to handle these issues?  What
fuel injection system are they using?  Do they have a single throttle, or are
they split?  How do they measure air mass?  What do the manifolds look like?

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Subject: Thermal reactors???

911 fans,

I was looking at a 74 Targa the other day.  The owner mentioned that one of
the benefits of this car was "no thermal reactors".  What are thermal reactors,
what years were they used, why are they considered sub-optimal, or are they?
His description was that reactors caused a lot of heat extremes which would
tend to result in oil leaks and frequent gasket replacement.

Sorry if this is a FAQ, and I know I could look it up somewhere, but the books I
have only mention them associated with 912E's.

Thanks,

Subject: 911 Rebuild

Greetings Fellow Porsche Freaks:

I'm new here so forgive me if this is an FAQ.

To keep it short, I'm looking for suggestions and tools for an engine rebuild. 

In early '85, my '69 911E engine (2.0 w/FI) went south on me with some banging
noises like I lost a rod bearing. I checked the chain tensioners which I've
lost before but they looked ok. Haven't opened it up yet but there was a lot of 
bearing material in the bottom of the block. Anyway, I've got the engine out 
so far, the tranny and clutch off (I've done that a couple times before), and 
I'm about to start pulling the engine apart. Yes, it's taken me 7 years to get
this far but I've always said that you don't want to rush into these things...

I've got a couple of the manuals from Clymers, etc., Anderson's 911 Performance 
book, and Vol III & IV of UpFixin derPorsche. But, never having tore into the 
engine, I don't have a copy of the factory manuals and none of the special 
tools which I'm going to need (i.e. crowfoot and cam holder for the cam nut, 
long 8 and 10mm allen wrenches, star allen wrenches, etc). Does anyone out 
there have any of this, that they want to get rid of, or am I just going to 
have to go to Performance Products and get it?

I'd appreciate any input.

cheers,
jt

Is there a way to get the FAQ's?

I did the whole ICE kit, not just the upgrade. It is a high quality
kit, and installed with a minimum of effort. Provides superior cooling
to factory 911 air up to '86, when they really got it right.

They're kinda flakey to deal with, but the parts are sound. You have to
do some of your own engineering to make it all go in right. And the decklid
mounted evap coil is mis-mounted so that you rupture the hose from rubbing 
on the compressor. A little hole fiddling fixed that. After I replaced
the hose, natch.

Yes. It is a win, provided you are (a) in a class where it's legal and (b)
don't have a fuel cell or oil cooler (hmmm - remind me to tell you about

I used the kit from RadTech Racing aka Stephens' Machining. Was about $90,
had the right size and length cables, etc. I'd have to measure the cable,
but it's 0 or 00 gauge. You can get same in local *serious* electrical
supply houses (like GrayBar, not Radio Shack). The other thing is the rubber
grommets you need to place around the holes you cut in the metal. I recommend
gluing them in, as losing one is a big shock, so to speak.

My day for 914 questions....

The fuel pump (pre-'75) is in one of the hottest locations in the car. So,
you get (a) hot gas which has a lower density and hence makes you run
leaner and (b) vapor separation, which causes cavitation or our old buddy
vapor lock.

Moving the pump fixes the problem, but has a few of its own: you are now under
full pressure for the whole length of the car. If your hard plastic fuel
line is old and brittle (if you don't know for sure, it is. Trust me)
then you have significant risk of rupture, and filling the car with gas
under pressure (29 psi for 2.0s, up to 70 psi for 1.8s). Not fun.

Moral: move the pump, change the line. Or go to Aeroquip.

The Carrera and the other Porsche motors (except the 962s and the racing
version of the 928 engine) use a single throttle. There are many, many
things that matter more to response than closeness of air metering to the 
intake throat. The physics of the Otto cycle engine as an air pump gets pretty
interesting fast.

The Bosch Automotive Handbook has a wealth of info on induction systems.
And other things. Good physics, and the right math (most of the time).
I also have two other sources I use, both from the olden days. Since I'm
in NYC, and the books are in my shop, bear with me... One is something
like "Internal Combustion Engines" and dates to about '48 or so. Wonderful
text, lots of good science behind it. Covers Otto cycle engines only, though
so Wankel-heads can't benefit (not true for Bosch manual, BTW). The other
is called something like Modern Performance Engineering, and dates to the
early 60's. Good stuff on tuned induction and exhaust systems, etc.

OK, there are two of "Stan's Upcoming Systems". One is the re-fitting of
modern programmable digital control systems to your tired crufty old
D-jet system. Out with your old brain, in with the new. No other changes.
And it's massively adjustable, so if you want to screw with it you can.
Target is to have a product version out by the end of the year. Price
isn't set yet, as I don't know what it will take to build in quantity.
And I'm looking at getting a CARB certificate for it too, for you West
Coast Weinies.

The other is a balls-out built-for-racing system that's the testbed for
some of my ideas. Using things I've learned from everything I've ever
taken apart. Built to eat TEC IIs for lunch, and shit HALTECHs afterward.
However, it's a system without a home, since I can't use it in GT-3
and you can't run 914s in IMSA. Still, I can run it at PCA driver ed events
and the like....

Not sure what the commercial status of that one is going to be. Since it's
still under construction, the point is moot for another month or so...

So.. is Stan up for the Parade award for best electronic newsletter..



Thermal reactors:

a device on your exhaust system to get exhaust temps high enough to burn
off pollutants, I believe NO specifically.  You do not want them on your
car.  They burn off pollutants and up your motor.  They tend to raise the
operating temp of the engine.  This is not a good thing on an air cooled 
vehicle. avoid thermal reactors or remove them if you have them.

if you can't pass the sniffer test without, remove after sniffer test.

914's suffer from vapour lock in warm weather.  I knew one guy who's '73 2.0
would vapour lock and stall on the highway.  My '74 2.0 did it once in city 
traffic.  (Both these occurances were in 33-40 C ambient temperatures)

Relocating the pump keeps the suction side away from the hot engine, exhaust, 
and the bypass from the heat exchangers.

Automobile Atlanta sells a kit which includes some wire, hose, a new set of 
fuel pump mounts, and instructions.  The procedure looks pretty simple, you 
can even do it with the fuel tank in the car.  I haven't had a chance to 
try it out yet though - the car is still undergoing extensive cancer surgery.

Porschephiles;

I get very busy in spurts and have to dump my porschephile mail
frequently without reading it.   If someone has a question they want
me specifically to answer then mail to me directly  (don't cc it with
porschephiles cause my mail reading system automatically classifies
anything with that in the header as low priority - and my low priority
queue gets flushed when it gets too big).  I am getting to the
backlog of such questions now - in the future, with the expertise that
is growing on this list now, you might be better served to ask the
list first.  I'm not sure I can give better answers than a lot of the
people here.   

I did manage to read the latest bout of pphile mail, so...

Mark;

There is another reason to move the fuel pump aside from what Stan
mentions, it is always better for a pump to push than to pull.  The
closer the pump is to the source, the more reliable your fuel pressure
will be.  If you check out any race prepared car, you will see the
pump close to the tank.  This matters under extreme conditions.  TO
reiterate and add to Stan's warning - It is very important, if you are
moving the fuel pump, to use good race quality gas lines.  Steel
braided (to prevent punctures not to maintain stiffness - which is the
original reason for braided brake lines, btw) is best.  Seat belts,
helmets, and fuel lines are perhaps the three most important items you
don't want to get cheap with.  I would rank fuel lines highest since
burning is the worst way to go.

The guy with the 69E (lost the msg);

I have rebuilt 69E engines and I am doing one now.  I have no tools
to sell, but if you have questions go ahead.  Since you've waited a
number of years to start my own turnaround will probably be your
speed.  

For those I told the story of my blown 69E engine at last years Redman
Invit, it wsn't the tensioners.  The previous owner/mechanic, not
having the correct crowfoot&cam holder, used a hammer&chisle
(acceptable for a quick roadside repair, but not a permanent one).

	What is the best place to relocate the fuel pump too. I have heard that

that I can put it with out having to remove the tank. And last time I looked
the gas lines run in a tunnel to the back of the car. Is it easy to replace

We eventually decided that the optimum fix was to grab a '75-6 fuel pump
fitment and use that. It's basicly a plate that covers an opening from the
trunk area into the gas tank area. The pump bolts up to the plate, and as
a result, you can pop the pump out without having to get under the car.

The routing of the solid plastic lines depends on the car. You can buy 
steel line any number of places. What you're looking for is dealers of 
Earle's or Aeroquip. See you Yellow Pages under <mumble>Racing 
<mumble> Supplies, etc under Automotive or possibly under Hoses.

OK, have you ever seen a 914 with an air conditioner? Know how they
punch a big hole in front trunk for the evaporator? Well, I did the
same for an oil cooler!

You get a 12 to 24 pass cooler, and cut a hole to fit so that the
cooler can be bolted to the new cooler-sized hole you just cut in the 
front pan (where the spare used to go). Be careful not to have places for 
air leaks around the sides of the cooler!  And be careful to get at least
5/8" I.D. core cooler! Also, you might consider building a cage around
the cooler to prevent breaking it by dropping things on it...

Then, flange up a piece of metal to go under the car and "scoop" air up 
from near the ground and feed it up through the cooler. You're all set except 
for air vents (if you don't put them in, you pressurize the trunk and don't 
flow more air. Sort of like driving down the highway with your safari windows 
open on your VW microbus wondering why you're soooo hot....)

For that, I cut a number of 4" holes in the inside wheel wells. You can 
louvre your front trunk lid instead, I guess,but I didn't think of that
until too later 8{(. I'd guess it would be optimal.

I also relocated the oil filter to the front trunk while I was at it. And,
to make it all possible, I used a spin-on filter blocking replacement plate
with threaded fittings, and ran my hoses down the right side of the car, under 
the outer rocker (just like on a 911 with oil cooler).

Works like a champ.

I have a 914/6. Is it necessary to move the fuel pump?
Well, when I was restoring the car last year, with mix
comments from different people; the pump was relocated.
I am still not sure if that was the right move.
I used the Automobile Atlanta's kit to move the pump
to the front. As far as the plastic fuel lines goes;
since the pump is near the tank now, the return plastic 
line was discarded. Just a short rubber hose was enough.
I brought a standard size stainless steel tubing for the
pressure line. The out side diameter is a little over 
size and it's end were machined to metric size on a lathe.  
I made a small bend for the front first and fed it 
through the center tunnel to the front.  I had to do that
a few time and increae the bend slowly. I didn't want 
to start with too sharp of a bend and can't get through 
the center tunnel. Then the tail end was bent to fit the 
engine compartment.

PS- I think it was a 3/8 tubing.

Subject: Re: european version of 914 ? what is difference?

Eric,

The only significant difference I've seen mention of was the use of a different
piston that raised the compression ratio to 8 to 1 instead of the US 7.6 to
one.  The engine case code is GB instead of the US GA.  I've never seen one
of these cars, but the spec book gives them another 5 horsepower if I remember
correctly.  (100 vs 95 or 91 for US cars).  The euro P and C 's seem to be 
what most of the supply houses sell and they seem to be cheaper than the 7.6's.
The folks at Automobile Atlanta once tried to sell me the Euro P and C's by 
saying that the 73 and 74 cars used these and Porsche intentionally dropped the
horsepower in 75 and 76 by using the 7.6's.  Needless to say, I restrict my 
purchases at AA to those items no one else has.  Because of the racing rules,
I have to stick to 7.6 pistons, but most people I know use the 8.0's when re-
building.

There are some non performance changes too, such as the Wolfsburg crest on the
steering wheel instead of the Porsche crest, the VW-Porsche emblem, different 
turn signal lenses etc.  Apparently, no right hand drive 914's were produced by
Porsche.

Maybe our friends in the UK could provide more information?

I helped build a 914 track car for Henry Hammer of Metro PCA region.
I don't knwo who has the car now, but one of the things we noticed was
that the front oil cooler we installed (in a similar way to what Stan
describes) was venting air under the car, foiling the front air dam,
and creating lots of lift.  We welded together some sheet metal to
the back of the cooler and vented the air through the trunk and
through the hood to the top of the car (like the inverse of those
ridiculous hood scoops you see on hopped up camaros).  This produced
so much downforce at speed that the car would bottom out.  We fixed
that by getting the 962 struts, and upgrading to the stiffest torsion
bars we could find.  The result was a car with enough grip to ripple
your cheeks.  Henry Hammer was able to get sub-2min laps at
Bridgehampton easily, and this was a 2.7 webered thing, and more
iportantly Henry is a lousy driver.

You can see a dark stain from the leaking fluid contained in the motor
mount on the aluminum crossmember under the engine when the mount leaks.
I assume that is what the mechanic saw when the car was on the lift to 
change the oil. In most cases the right mount fails first due to its
proximity to the exhaust system, and it is common to just replace the
failed mount rather than to replace both. You want to make sure you get
the latest version of the mount, which looks significantly different
from the earlier versions, and can be retrofitted to all 944's (I don't
have the part number with me here). Aftermarket prices for the new
mount are in the $135 range, and it took me perhaps 2 hours to install
mine (the dealer should be a lot faster). I don't know what the dealer
would charge, but I would guess that their price for the part is
in the neighborhood of twice the aftermarket price, so $300-400 is
a reasonable guess at the total.

        You will notice a considerable amount of vibration at idle
        when the mounts get bad. I've not heard anything bad happening
        to a 944 with bad mounts that were not replaced immediately

        I didn't notice any leakage right before I had mine replaced but
        it was under warranty and I went ahead and had the dealer do them.
        for something horrible like $650. The updated turbo mounts only
        cost $135 ea. mail order. Next time I'm going to look into doing
        it myself. Anyone out there replaced them?
>How else
>does one tell if the mounts are going?
        There is a tool that checks a gap distance in the mount and when
        it is less than xxx cm you are supposed to replace them. The mount
        the right side tends to go first because it's right next to the

        exhaust manifold and the heat kills it first. As long as you are

        going to have one replaced you it's not much more work to do both.
        I would think that the right one, the one that usually fails first,
        would be the hardest to replace because of the exhaust system getting
        in the way.

Good luck,

Subject: Re: 944 m mounts

Bruce -

I agree with what Frank and Blaine have said.  The best way to ultimately judge
the state of the mount is with the tool, which is what Porsche calls "locally
made."  You can do what I did, which is cut a piece of 1/2" steel flat stock and
bend it just right.  There's a factory tech bulletin showing the shape, and I
can forward it to anyone given a USPS address or FAX #.  Piece of cake.

The reason for the tool is that it's pretty hard to judge by just eyeballing the
part.  It is almost always the exhaust-side mount which fails because of the
heat, and as someone said, it's a toss-up as to whether to replace the
drive-side mount while you're in there.  I didn't 'cause PCNA was buying.

Last time I checked, dealer list for the passenger-side mount was $148, or maybe
this was my discounted cost, jeez, I forget.  Not too bad.  There was some
diversity of opinion regarding the need for an alignment after the mount swap; I
dunno myself since I am not 100% sure what you have to take apart to get the
mount in.  Frank?

Symptoms of mount failure are the hydraulic fluid stains, if you can see 'em. 
More noticeably, a distinctly macho rumble to the engine after cold starting.  I
noticed that after replacing the mount, I could once again hear the fuel pump. 
Maybe that would be a good diagnostic criterion - er, maybe not.

It turns out that the 914/6 didn't have the same problems, due to
(1) having carbs, not EFI, (2) as a result, using lower pressure
and a different pump, and (3) a different mount point.

It can't hurt, as the fuel will be colder and denser -- or should

Subject: 944 Motor Mounts

I have helped with the replacement of several mounts on early 944s.
By the time I saw them, any fluid which had leaked out was no longer
there.  The primary symptom was that the steering wheel would shake at
idle, and smooth out above 1200 rpm or so.  As a matter of fact, when
I bought my 944 (83 - used) the exhaust side mount was already bad, so
I thought that "they all do that".  After reading Upfixin, I decided
to give a new one a try and "Oh, what a feeling"...

The replacement requires the removal of the crossmember which supports
the motor mounts (and thus supports the motor).  That removal, in
itself, will not require a wheel alignment as a result.  However, the
best lift for providing the leverage and support you will need to
change the mount is one of the new Hunter or FMC alignment racks,
which also have the moveable air jacks built in (which will support
the motor when the mounts are not doing so).  Fortunately, the best
local tire distributor is a PCA board member, and allows us the use of
his facility for tech sessions and the like.  That is where I learned
all of this stuff.

Yes, it is always the exhaust side mount that goes bad (first).  The
driver's side may go bad, but the heat from the exhaust manifold
causes a rupture of the membrane which keeps the hydraulic fluid
inside.  If I were doing one today, I would just do the exhaust side
only, but inspect the driver's side while under there.  I suppose that
you could order two and return one if you do not need it.

"With the proper tools and lift" --- the job takes about 2 hours.
With the proper tools, but laying on your back under a car on
jackstands, I would estimate an agonizing 4 hours or so.

You definitely have to lower the crossmember at least an inch or so, as
well as raising the engine. Conceptually you could raise the engine only,
but you would in my opinion have to raise the engine enough to require
disconnecting everything (exhaust system, fuel lines, etc). In my case,
one of the mechanics at the local dealership who was assisting us with
a PCA tech inspection prior to a drivers school noticed the characteristic
stain on my car. I asked him how he went about replacing the mount, and
he mentioned the idea of only disconnecting one end of the crossbrace
to avoid disrupting the alignment. I didn't verify that disconnecting
both ends would in fact mess up the alignment, I just took his word
for it. The procedure he described (disconnect one side of the cross-
member and pull it down somewhat, lift the engine) worked reasonably
well. I still had to do some juggling to get the mount in and out, and
getting to the upper bolts was tricky, but it all eventually worked.

Just to add my $.02 worth on motor mounts. When mine was replaced ('83 944),
the biggest change I noticed was not the vibration at idle but the vibration/
shudder that occurred as the engine returned to idle from some higher rpm.
With the worn mount, a shudder seemed to go through the car; with the new
mount, nothing.

There is a modification that should be done to the pan that consists of
changing one of the louvers (or maybe a new one is cut, I don't remember
off hand) so that more air passes by the right side mount and keeps it a 
bit cooler. I believe the change was recommended by Porsche (Kevin, you seem
to keep track of these things; do you recall something like that?).

Subject: 911 sway bar questions


I have a question for any 911 autocross experts out there...

I have a 1980 911sc with the factory sport suspension, Bilstein struts, 
front and rear sway bars (not sure of diameter).

Last weekend during an autocross, the body roll became objectionable 
during some fast esses.  One of the common mods I've noticed on the cars
in my class (IP under PCA (zone 7) rules), is the addition of aftermarket
(weltmeister) sway bars.  These bars are adjustable, sooo...

I thought I'd get the largest ones available (22mm front and rear 
(i think)) on the theory that I'd be able to soften them up for
street driving and still reduce the body roll for autocross.

Questions:

1.      Has anyone used the weltmeister sway bars?

2.      What size did you use?  (on what car?)

3.      Would you do it over?

4.      Does anyone know of another adjustable sway bar?

5.      Am I approaching this wrong; should I consider stiffer torsion
        bars?  I'd rather not go this route as the car already rides
        fairly hard.


More info:

I already have sufficent road feel for street use.  The shocks are fairly 
new (2 years) bilstiens; they are not worn out.  The car is lowered.  I 
used to raise the inside front tire in most turns.  However, I felt 
the front end was lowered a bit too much and raised it slightly (now I 
can get out of my driveway w/o scraping).  I do not know if the inside 
wheel still is off the ground.  I autocross with 15x7 and 15x8 fuchs and 
225:50 and 245:50 bfg comp ta r1's (204 (rr) compound).  I have the 
weltmeister front shock tower brace.

I objection I had last weekend was that the transitions from side to side
were affecting the amount of speed I was able to carry down a fairly 
long, almost straight section.  After walking the course, I expected to
be able the take this section flat out.  Almost went through about 6
cones my first run.  Usually, I underestimate how fast I will be able to 
take a section like this.  It seemed that reducing the body roll would
have helped to keep the wheels firmly on the ground.

Any comments welcome.

	The throttle cable on my 944 (85.5, UK spec, stock) was obviously
replaced sometime in the past - it looks newish and the cable clip which
should tie it to the output manifold was missing (I have since replaced
it).

	There was a reasonable amount of slack in the cable when I looked
at it, which had two consequences: (1) when I first put my foot on the
pedal, there was some delay before the throttle actually opened (while the
slack was being taken up) and (2) even with my foot to the floor (not that
I would ever do this :-) ), the throttle was not fully open.

	I have now adjusted the cable (at the throttle end) so that there
is no slack, and even a slight touch on the pedal opens the throttle. I
don't know if things are optimised at the other end (i.e. if `pedal to the
floor' = `fully open throttle').

	Finally I get to the question - is there a more scientific (or
Porsche recommended!) way of doing this?  My Haynes manual has a section
entitled "Removal, Fitting and Adjustment of Throttle Cable", but doesn't
actually say anything about adjustment :-(

I don't know the "Porsche recommended" way, but I have a few comments.
I see no problem with your removing essentially all of the free play
at the idle end of the travel. I would simply make sure that it is the
mechanical stop on the throttle body rather than the pedal which is
acting as the stop on throttle movement. However, there is also an
important adjustment to make at the other end of the travel (full
throttle- just in case you ever find the need to use it :-) ). You
need to make sure that the pedal travel is limited by the mecahnical
stop on the pedal, not by the cable and the throttle body. It is
surprising how hard you can push on an accelerator already at the stop
(especially in a low power car :-) ). There is a mechanical stop
under the accelerator pedal which is adjustable. It looks like a
plastic cylinder, and it is threaded into a mount on the floor.
Turn it until the pedal stops against it just as the throttle plate
gets to its stop at the throttle body. There should be no significant
tension on the cable when you push hard on the pedal at its limit.
You do however want to make sure this occurs with the throttle
fully open. This is easiest to do with two people: one to push hard
on the throttle, and one to make sure the throttle is fully open,
but that there is no extra tension on the cable.

RE: 914 oil coolers.  Just my $.02.

when I owned a 914/6, I had two coolers mounted side by side in the front of
the trunk.  they were fed air by removing the big round plugs in the
body above and behind the bumper. sheet aluminum was use to box in the front
of the cooler to the body to force air through them.  exhaust air can be let
out by a hole in the trunk floor and similar ducting.  I used a space saver 
spare from a newer 911 to replace the full size spare. 

I used a 908 thermostat from the tank to the lines which ran under the right
side of the car, tight up through the right wheel well and into the trunk.
the coolers were hooked up in series. oil went through the right cooler to
the left and back in to the return line. I used /12 hose throughout.  I
believe the coolers were Earls.  The car had a 2.7 in it and cooled fine.

Oh yes. I never found it necessary to relocate the fuel pump.  I did however
add an external starter relay so that the starter would work when the engine
was hot.

Subject: 928 question

A few months ago, I sent a message about a leaking rear cam oil seal on
a 1983 928S. It was leaking about half a teaspoon of oil per night. Now
that winter is finally over, I decided to do something about it, rather
than just keep filling it with oil for the few miles I've done in it
this year. I discover that I have two problems:

(1) The cam cover seals on the back of both banks were leaking only
    because the bolts were only finger tight! No problem, says I. I
    took off the air cleaner and all that other neat stuff in the
    vicinity, and whipped off the cam cover seals to install new gaskets
    while I'm at it. The problem (which may not really be a problem)
    is that there are only three bolts in each cam seal cover, but
    there are four holes in each cover itself, plus four holes in the
    cam cover that they mate to. The hole with the "missing" bolt is
    a little larger than the others, and the same bolt is missing on
    both banks. Anyone know if there is really supposed to be four
    bolts here? If not, what's the hole for? 

(2) Bigger problem. I discovered a small oil leak from the oil drain
    plug. I decide to take it out and put in a new O-ring. It seems
    as if the drain plug itself screws into an insert, which then
    screws into the oil pan. The insert and the drain plug all came
    out together, and there's no way I can separate them to install
    a new O-ring. It looks like the previous owner had trouble with
    this as well, judging by all the bloody screwdriver marks all
    over the place (I haven't had this beast long, and haven't had
    to change the oil myself before on this car). My parts guy
    claims that the drain plug just screws straight into the oil
    pan - there's no insert. There obviously is on my car, however!
    It looks to me like the oil may be leaking from between the
    insert and the oil pan, which probably means a new oil pan and
    big $$$. Anyone know what the scoop is here? Is the insert
    supposed to come out with the drain plug? If so, why both with
    two separate plugs and an O-ring which appears to do nothing?

Thanks!

Just read this in the "Fastrack" section of the August issure of
Sports-Car (The SCCA's monthly national pub.)

The following class moves for Autocross.

The 928 GT/S4 has been moved from SS (Corvette Domain) to
AS (Now runs with 911s).

The 944T & 944Turbo S from SS to BS.

This should make both models much more competitive in both
of their respective classes.  The move of the 951 to BS is
a shocker.  If I owned a 951 and autocrossed I sure would
take my shot at Nationals this Sept. in Salina KS.  

The bad news for me is that my 928 (2V) also runs in BS (Not that I am
a good enough driver to compete in BS at Nationals.  I don't do to bad

Maybe you could remove the oil pan and clean the insert threads then use
one of those Loctite assembly (i.e. not to be removed with out great force)
thread locker type stuff. If that doesn't work you've got the pan off any
way and probably could find another one, maybe used. I think the most

The OXS light on my '83 911 came on a few days ago.  
I reset it yesterday by removing the tachometer and pressing

My question is, what is the purpose of this light besides to tell
you when 30,000 miles have elapsed?  I know it's supposed to remind 
you to have the car serviced, but the manual states that if the
light comes on, you might have a problem with your engine.

Is the light connected to the lambda circuit?

How does the black box know when 30,000 miles have elapsed?
(actually, mine clicked on almost 10,000 miles too late.)

When I reset the box, it made this terrific mechanical "clack"
sound.  It seems that to turn on the light, it physically 
locks a connection closed.  I bet it doesn't use a normal relay 
so it won't drain the battery.

Subject: 951's in B Stock


The 951 has been an SCCA Solo II B Stock car for several years.  David
Schnoerr finished second at Nationals last year in a 951.  The reclassification
affects the 951S model (247hp, 9" rear wheels, bigger brakes, stiffer
suspension, etc.)  All 1989 951's were configured as S models, so the S 
designation was dropped.

I don't think the reclassification takes effect until next March,
so the 951S will still run in SS at Nationals this year.
My issue of Sports Car hasn't arrived yet (so I haven't seen the official
announcement), but I've been following
the discussion of the pending reclassification on the autox mailing list.

The reclassification of the 951S was overdue.  Unfortunately, some of the
other pending reclassifications do not make as much sense.
I own two cars: an '89 951(S) and an '86 Mustang SVO.  The Mustang SVO
has been the second fastest car in G Stock (to the Chrysler Conquest) for 
the past few years.  I have been gradually restoring my SVO to fighting trim,
with the idea of racing it in local Solo II autocrosses.  Now it looks like
I should race my 951S instead.  Both the Chrysler Conquest and the Mustang
SVO will be moved to B Stock.

My SVO is surprisingly fast for a chopped Ford Fairmont powered by a Pinto
motor on steroids (a turbocharged, intercooled 2.3 liter four), but it is 
not remotely competitive with a 951S.  I wonder if anyone involved in the 
reclassification process has ever driven both cars hard.

Does anyone know where I can buy a set of 951S wheels cheap?  The best price
I have seen is $1600 for a used set, which is a bit more than I want to pay.

911 Fans:

Well, I've certainly given up any silly notion of settling for a 912
over a 911, and based on input from this newsgroup, I have been looking
all over for that perfect '70, '71, or '73 1/2 911E:  One with a straight
chassis, no rust, decent paint, good interior and about 10-20k miles
on an engine rebuild from a reputable shop--with documentation.  I've
driven a lot of low-end cars and some high-end.  Most of them seem to
be in the last 10-20% of their engine rebuild cycle--hence the reason
for selling.  Really high end cars seem to be 12-15k and are out
of my price range (10k is ideal, but I'll go to 12).  Clearly I have
let go of the "buy-a-low-end-car-and-work-on-it-over-time" strategy,
and am leaning toward the "buy a car that is 80-90% straight and
enjoy it for a few years before I have to do anything major to it" plan.

Anyway, I made the mistake of driving a 74 Targa with the 2.7 (non S)
At this point I have not researched post 73 1/2 cars so I know very
little about it.  All I know is that I may now be spoiled by the
extra torque and refinement of the 2.7 vs the 2.2.

What is the conventional wisdom about the relative merits of this
car vs others within a few years of it?  Since my price point is about 10k
it's pointless to talk about anything much newer.

I think the HP for the straight 911 of that year is about 150. Is this
true?  What is the torque?  What are the known drawbacks of this car (if
any).  For example, it seems that 74 is a better year than 75-77 because it
does not have the "thermal reactors". 
  
Thanks for any insight you can give me,

There is general wear, particularly on the fronts, due to various track outings.
Coupled with the nail, maybe this is the time to replace all 4 rather than
merely fix/replace the one with the nail.

Question: What should I get? My requirements are the usual ones. I want
great lap times, but also demand that they have a reasonable lifetime
and that they are safe in the rain. In other words these will be both

Subject: Re: 928 question

Because it has an alloy pan, the 928's oil drain plug is secured with the help
of an insert something like a Helicoil.  If it backs out, which it occassionally
does, you need to buy a new one from your dealer.  If you cannot get the drain
plug free of the old insert, buy a new drain plug as well.  They're not terribly
expensive.

By the way, as of a year or so ago, Porsche changed their oil drain plug to
delete the magnet.  Its job was to accumulate ferrous particles out of the oil. 
I don't know their reason for the change, but it is likely due to the dominance
of non-ferrous materials in their current engines.

BF Goodrich wrote about tire repairs in their latest "Team T/A" newsletter. 
There advice was:

  1. repair with an interior patch, never a plug, and
  2. never take a repaired tire on the track.

I myself found a nasty self-tap bolt buried in one of my Comp T/A R1 rears just
before going out for my third run on a day at Lime Rock last year.  I drove up
to Canaan, had the tire dismounted, patched, remounted, and balanced for all of
$8.46 by a very conscientous fellow at Canaan Tire (I think that's the name),
and made it back in time for the fourth run group!  I ran the tire the rest of
the season, a couple more events, without a problem.  The nice part of the
experience was that it was such an unbelievably gorgeous fall day, peak leaf
season, that I enjoyed the outing.

So I would have to say that BFG's advice (2.) is a judgement call.

There's a guy in the Houston area with one of these suckers. From the look
of it, "sucker" may be the operative word. He did the engine conversion.
Then discovered that placement and plumbing of the cooling system hadn't
been well thought it. Took a long time to get it to run without overheating.
That being settled, he then had to completely sort out the suspension and
brakes. Wound up with 911 suspension in the front and custom Eibach springs
in the rear to give acceptible "street" and "spirited" handing characteristics.
Then discovered that the brakes, even with 911S front brakes, wasn't enough
(yes, that huge horsepower difference is noticable). On went JFZ stock car
brakes. Ooops. Lost the parking brake on that move, so can't get it inpsected
for street operation without swapping the regular 914 brakes back on (which he
does once a year, just for that purpose..) Then he can drive it hard enough to
discover that it handles like a pig on roler skates. So he had to figure
out where and how to re-inforce the chassis, then add *big* sway bars. And
then he neeed more tire on the ground, which meant going to flares (a Chalon
kit in this case).

All in all, he has about $19k in this. He turns his own bolts. He fabricates
about half of the parts needed. I estimate that it would cost a civilian
about $28-30k to do the same. And one of my partners in Ghost Racing is
*STILL* faster in a "mostly" stock 914 2.0 with some of our  master mechanic's
engine tweeks and my EFI tweeks.

Still, it's an impressive car. But I don't think having to re-engineer your
transportation is really the right way to do this... For the money, I'd
buy a 911SC and trick it up some.

Stan

P.S. The limit on  *reliable* horsepower on the basic 4-cylinder seems to
be about ~150 or so. At no weight increase. For about $5k or less. In case
it matters. Ultimate horsepower is substantially higher, for significantly
more money and engine life measured in hours.

I agree, at speed there will be a lot of front end lift.  You will
have to brake harder than necessary to get the front to grip.  The
only good choices are wheel wells (helps brake cooling), over the
hood (adds downforce), or inside (adds sweat).

On my 914-6 with bottom exit,  I had no problem with lift.  the car had
an air dam also.

I noticed no lift at 115-120 going into canada corner at road america.

I also know one other 914-6 that ran at the same time with lower exit. that
car was very fast...2.8 260hp.  he had one big modine cooler up front with
a lower exit and was much faster than my car.  he also had no problem with
lift.

I designed mine after his, but I used two shorter coolers instead of the big
monster he used.  but my stock 2.7 did not need quite the cooling.

Subject: Tires... 944


My Yokohama A008 tires (yes Just "A008" if there is any such thing
any more) are history.  It's definitely time for me to get 
something to keep me going.  I have totally loved the A008.  My
biggest problem is that I could never get them to make a noise aside from that 
characteristic cackle they make going down smooth roads.  But 
who wants to screech anyways, really.  So the questions are:

What is the comprable tire to the A008 these days?
What are other tires that my '84 944 could go with
and what are the prices?

Thanks for the info!

Boooom!

I don't know what hit me but I'm glad I didn't see it
coming.

I must have glanced away for just a moment when, from the looks
of it, a large nasty chunk of something very hard flew into my 
windshield on the freeway and hit just below the left wiper
blade knocking it up about two inches and putting an 1.5"
long, 1/4" wide gash in my windshield.  

Time for windshield #3...  Many of you might recall #2 was
needed when I sortof kneed my rear-view mirror as I was climbing
over my stick because my driver's side door latch mechanism
snapped...  but that was back in Texas.

Now I'm in So. Cal (Basically Los Angeles, San Fernando VAlley) and
I want to know who to  talk to, where to go, and how much.
Out here in the land of Porsches, perhaps it's even possible to 
find a windshield in a junk yard.  Recommendations???

The engines are the same with the exception of the turbocharger.

The chips, however, are not interchangeable because the 88 and 89 turboS
chips are phyically different, i.e. have more "legs" then the earlier
951 chips.  I think it's 28 and 32 legs, or somesuch nonsense.  

You should use the chips designed for the engine you have since AutoTH
optimized the chips for the turbo size, i.e. if you upgrade to the S
turbo, use the S chips.

Power is limited by the actual amount of boost you run and the
efficiency of the turbos.  Last I checked, with similar boost (.9 peak)
the 951S turbo is worth 8-9 horsepower.  Those are AutoTH's figures.

Saturday the Oregon region of the PCA hosted a multi marque
track day for the Porsche, BMW, and Alfa Rameo clubs at
Portland International Raceway.  There were about 60 cars
including Porsches, BMW's, the assorted VW, an NSX, a Stealth, ...
Some people came down from Seattle to join us.

The Oregon region always pays a couple of the SCCA workers
to come out and work turns for us.  This always makes the
day run very smoothly.  You also know you can trust the flags.

There was a BBQ during the lunch break.  This was the first
time and it was great to have.

The weather was hot - 95!  The heat slowed the people down
so there weren't any problems with cars overheating.  The
people would get a little tired and pull off early.  Every
one was very safe.  I heard there were only a couple of
spins all day.

Personally, I took my VW Golf race car out and had fun
chasing a few 944's.  They were only about a second quicker
and that was because of their straight line speed.  I left
my slow car at home (the 911SC).

There is a local 934 (bright orange).  It's a pretty car
but I hope he gets the motor sorted out.

That's all for now.

Fred:

I don't think there is a single answer to your question. You are going to
have to make tradeoffs in one direction or the other. At the "great
lap times" end of the spectrum are the "R" series tires: Goodrich Comp
T/A R1, Yokohama A008RS and Bridgestone RE71R, in order (IMHO) of
fastest lap times. Also, not surprisingly, in inverse order of durability.
A friend of mine who drives relatively agressively gets 6 days of track
time on a set of Comp T/A R1s on an 85.5 944. Thats close to $100/day
for tires. The others wear somewhat more slowly, but still wear faster
than most real street tires. These tires are molded at 6/32" (at least
the first two), so they are never great in the rain, and get really
exciting as they wear.

At the next level are the top of the line real street tires, such as
the Yokohama A008 (I think what they sell now is the A008P, which
essentially just says it conforms to Porsche's specs), the Comp T/A
Z, and the regular RE71. Here the A008 is probably best on the track,
but poorest in the rain on the street. The other two run the risk of
chunking if you really drive them hard at full tread depth. A lot
of this depends on how much drivers education experience you have.
if you are in the novice or beginners groups I would be surprised
if you had a chunking problem with either of them.

There are obviously lots of other choices if cost is a significant
issue as well, but I don't have a lot of experience there.

By the way, I ended up with a second set of wheels (which I was lucky
to find for a song at a swap meet) which have RE71s on them for the
street. I use A008RTU on the track now, but will probably have to go
to the A008RS when they wear out, since Yokohama no longer makes the
RTU. I think I am giving up a second or so to the Comp R1's, but the
Yoko's last a lot longer, and that matters to me. The only issue with
this setup (other than the cost of a second set of wheels and tires)
is the drive to the track on tires which are not great in the rain.

Subject: Re: 74 911

Volney

I own a 71 911E (the 14th E of 71), and believe the mechanically injected cars
are the best choice of the lot, especially for the money you're talking about.
My car has 155 DIN horsepower, which doesn't seem like much these days, but
it only weights about 2280 lbs.  I assure you, the performance is acceptable.

You asked about the desirability of the 2.7 cars.  The 74 through 77 are viewed
as the least desirable 911's. By that time the engine had grown a bit too 
big for the case and the cars had some overheating and pulled head stud
 problems.  The 911 Performance Handbook has a good discussion of this.  If you
can find a 2.7 with an engine which has been rebuilt by a trusted mechanic, it 
might be worth a try.  The head stud pulling problem can be prevented by proper
action during the rebuild, but a while back there were lots of counterfit studs
(non Porsche, wrong material) so even a professionally done engine could be 
suspect.  I'll leave the esthetics of the post 74 bumpers to you.  

One distinct advantage these cars have (post 76) is a galvanized body structure.
Rust is the big problem with the early cars and this was almost eliminated for 
76 and later 911's.

Concerning 69-73 911's:

The E is a good choice for autocrossing since the horsepower is available at a
broader range of RPM's.  The S is better for high speed track events.  The T is
better for actually driving on the street since many T's were built - they are
cheap and relatively plentiful.  The E came with strange hydropneumatic front
suspension struts which fail every 40,000 miles.  Most have been refitted with
normal front suspension components.  When you look at these cars, pay attention
to rust.  Also see what front brakes the car has, the large aluminum S calipers
are more desirable than the smaller steel calipers.  

At least in 71, there were more S cars produced than E versions, so strictly by
the numbers, the E is rarer.  Very few are advertised for sale in Panorama.  The
S still has more popular appeal, however, so E's can be picked up for a 
reasonable price.  Avoid cars with carb conversions, since this reduces power,
originality, and resale value.  Most E's came with 14 inch Fuches instead of the
15's on the rest of the cars.  These wheels are getting a bit rare, although
for performance the 15's are better.

Subject: Re:  Track/Street Tires

Regarding tires that work well both on the track and the street.

My personal opinion is that once you start driving aggressively on  
the track, you will want race tires.  Aside from lower lap times,  
which really aren't important at track events, race tires will have a  
much better feel and make your car more controllable.

Buy a second set of wheels and put shaved tires on them.  I picked up  
some 7x15 cookie cutters at a local used auto parts place for $50  
each.  They aren't perfect cosmetically, but who cares?  225/50R15  
work great on all four corners.

You can fit all four mounted wheels in the back of your 944, and  
change wheels at the track.  If it rains at the track, put your  
street tires back on.

This will end up being more economical in the long run than  
destroying your full-tread-depth street tires on the track or  
crashing your car on the street when it rains.

In the autocross world, there's only two choices -- the BFG Comp T/A R1
206-compound, and the Yoko A008RSII.

The 206 R1 is the autocross compound.  It's not speed-rated, and they say
"don't even think about using it on a track.  It will melt."  It is designed
to heat up very quickly, and so it overheats easily.  This is not an issue
for street driving or for autocrossing, though.

The A008RSII (that is, RS-2) is Yoko's latest bid to catch up to the 206
R1.  Some autocrossers are not sure that they like it.  I'm not sure what
the real difference is between the RSII and the RS, I'm afraid.

If you're talking about high-speed racetrack events, you won't want the
206.  You might consider the 204-compound R1, but someone else is probably
more familiar with what's available in high-speed tires.

I've always used interior patches on my tires, and I have autcrossed on
patched tires several times.  BFG's, in fact.  So while I see their point, I

I had a similar experience patching a 1/4" bolt hole in a Yoko A-008G. The
patched tire endured at least 10 track days before I decided to sell the
car. An additional piece of advice from Euro-Tire (the place that repaired
my tire) was that the hole should never, even temporarily, be "plugged."
Once plugged the tire will never be able to be repaired correctly.

      I have been wondering about these chips too... They are called EPROM's
   around here, (well, we are a .com address) and we have equipment that
   facilitates the programming of these chips.
      Can someone out there with a handy chip read off some of the numbers,
   text, etc, and read the numbers off the chip under the label and post
   them here.  I can reference that data to determine what the size of the
   memory and who the vendor is.
      The difference in the number of legs in the eprom chip from the 'S to
   the turbo version says to me that more memory is needed for the turbo
   tables the DME uses.  Correct me if i'm wrong.  It may be possible to
   play with the tables in efforts to pseudo-code the best of the turbo
   characteristics into the 'S chip.  or vice-versa 
      If we knew more about the DME tables.

      Stan;  Are you hearing this?  have you tinkered with a DME like this?

There is an 1985 944 for sale for $3200.00 that has had a front end collision.
It has 75K miles on it and from what I was told, still runs and drives well.
It sounds like it needs a front clip but he claimes the fenders and hood are OK?
Sorry for the vague description but its all I was told.  

If anyone is interested, I can get more details.

The car is located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Subject: 914: tires, harness and brakes

I finally worked out the sticky throttle problems in my 914 (turned out
to be a sticky throttle body) and I'm now ready to buy some rubber and
mount my harness.

1) I have a set of cheap Fuchs 15x5.5" replicas that I'm planning to
   use. I know they have a poor reputation and are disallowed at speed
   events in some regions, but I'm just planning on using the car for
   autocrossing, occaisional road events at the relatively low speed
   events held at Talledega GPR, and occasional street use (1-2
   days/week).

   Conventional wisdom says that 205-60's are the largest tires that
   will fit under my non-flared fenders. Since this particular car will
   probably rust out from under me in a couple of years anyway, I don't
   mind hammering the fenders out to accept wider tires - is that
   recommended?  How wide can/should I go?  I'll probably be using Yoko
   008rs's, though if my cheap side wins out, I may settle for street
   Comp/TA's (this is not my primary track car).

2) How does one mount a harness in a non-rollbar equiped 914?  Do I just
   drill into the firewall and put a backing plate on the engine side?
   It looks like I can use the existing lap belt mounts for the lap
   belt.
   
3) While the 914 handles really well, after driving my 951 day in and
   day out, the brakes are _really_ spongy. (I'm not exactly sure how
   this 914's been modified (I bought it from a disinterested relative
   of the original owner...) -- it has very stiff springs, better
   steering response and better brakes than my Dad's 914, and the
   smoothest transmission of any 914 I've ever driven).  I've read (in
   the 914 Owner's Association's handbook) of a mod to use BMW 320
   brakes -- supposedly a lot cheaper than using Porsche parts... Are
   there any cheaper (or more effective) ways of get a firmer pedal (and
   hopefully better braking)? Would upgrading to stainless steel lines
   make a big difference (it didn't on my 951)?
   
Thanks!

Early SS lines weren't sized to match the stock lines, and you got into
some interesting differential pressure situations. And, the "conventional
wisdom" (note: my definition of "conventional wisdom" is "wisdom best
suited for a convent") was that they were OK on race cars that you inspected

this is due to potential liablity issues, not anything factual.

Remember, wider equals (potentially) stickier. If it's a roling ruster, then
you have to think really, *REALLY* hard about doing things that may make
the tires stick more, and hence rip the suspension out of the body.

We also tend to use *narrower* tires because they are available in shorter
heights. 195/50 is a great size for this car. It screws up the speedo and
what because the rolling diameter is smaller, but adds a lot to the
performance by shortening the effective gearing. And, it's softer on the
body.

Lap belts can be mounted in the same fittings. The shoulder belt needs tob
be better reinforced. Try fabricating a bar that goes between the mount bolts
for the top point on the street belts, just across the top of the padding
on the back wall. And again, be careful. If you ever really need these belts,
you want them mounted in solid, solid steel. Don't drill the firewall on
these guys -- it's made of paper or dried leaves or some such.

There are all sorts of brake hacks out there, but few more effective than
replacing the master cylinder with a 19mm unit from an early 911 and
then replacing the proportioning valve with something adjustable. BIG
win.

They are decals, and I'm pretty sure they were OE on the 924's anyway.  Pretty
nice looking.  I've seen them for sale through Tweeks (int+800.428.2200) in the
states, but I'm sure others have them too.

I think the convent(ional) wisdom on SS brake lines for street Porsches
is that there is potentially a quality control problem, since the lines
can be assembled by anybody with a hacksaw and a vice, and there are
plenty of ways they can be assembled incorrectly, leading to brake failure.
Therefore, you should know with some confidence that the ones you buy
were assembled by someone who is competent and consistent. The issue
on sizing relates to expansion. The whole reason many Porsche owners
went to SS lines was the (to some extent erroneous) assumption that the
lines played a significant role in their spongy pedals. Those who
installed -4 (1/4" ID) SS lines found that the surface area was large
enough that they expanded as much or more than the stock lines.
Use of -3 (3/16" ID) lines in fact may help the spongyness a little
(but the big winner is, as Stan said, the 19 mm cylinder and a better
pressure reducing valve).

On the use of SS lines on race cars, the convent(ional) wisdom as I
understand it was that the stainless steel jacket was tougher than
anything else, so if a brake line rubbed on a suspension part, it
was the suspension part, not the brake line, which wore through.
My view of the "frequent inspections" called for was to assure that
the brake line wasn't abrading something else, and perhaps to look for
kinks from overextention.

On a 5.5" rim, 205 is a bit beyond the limit (but it will work).  I
autocrossed last season on stock Fuchs 5.5" alloys with BFG Comp T/A R1
206's in 205/50-15.  The sidewalls were rather pinched, but they stuck
nicely.

As Stan advised, beware of making the car too sticky or too stiff for your
weak chassis.

There are two issues on tire size -- width and diameter.  You probably want
195 or 205-section tires for width; that's pretty easy.  Diameter is tougher
- -- it's a tradeoff.  For autocrossing, there is absolutely no doubt that
smaller diameter is a win.  It shortens the gearing for better acceleration,
gives a smaller sidewall for better handling and more grip, and lowers the
car and reduces body roll.

However, the teeny 195/50-15 or 205/50-15's may be too small for other
uses.  The smaller sidewall makes the ride worse on the street, and the
gearing advantage may not be realistic at higher speed events, and of course
it screws up the speedometer, and makes your engine work harder at speed.

You shouldn't need to stretch the fenders for 205/50-15's, if your replica
wheels have the stock offset.  You might need to for 205/60-15's.  If you
need to stretch the rears, be aware that the left side probably has 0.5"
less clearance than the right, so you'll have to stretch it further.  The
technique that worked for me was to warm the metal, then stretch it using
the classic baseball-bat rolling trick.

R1's or not?  The R1 doesn't come in 195/50-15, just FYI.

The firewall never seemed particularly strong to me.  Use a bar like the one
near the back of the Automotion catalog (you can buy that one or use that
picture as a guide for fabricating your own).  It's a steel bar that bolts
into the stock shoulder belt mounts.  You hang the belts from there, just
like if you had a full roll bar.

As the token s/s brake line wet blanket, I'll make it easy for those of you
who're sick of my opinions by simply reposting an article Bruce Anderson wrote
for Excellence in the last year or so.

- ---------------------
"A Word of Caution About Replacement Brake Hoses

"Stock rubber hoses are fine for a street car.  In fact, I prefer them.  They
are a low maintenance item and very seldom fail.  Their most common failure mode
is swelling from old age or contaminated brake fluid.

"The Teflon braided hoses are designed for race cars where they will receive
heavy maintenance and frequent inspections.  All of the successful race cars in
the world use these braided steel hoses.  However, if you get an inferior
product, or if they are improperly installed, you can create a worse problem for
yourself than the one you think you are solving.  There is probably no more
frightening experience than having brakes fail, so be very careful and check out
the fit of your aftermarket brake lines very carefully.  If one fails, the
results can be tragic.

"I know, I know, a lot of people use steel lines for their street cars.  If you
feel you must switch to the Teflon braided steel lines, be sure that they are
dash three size hoses.  The dash four size that was some common a few years ago
on the aftermarket actually causes a spongy brake pedal.  When you install
stainless steel brake lines, make sure they match the same position and follow
the same lay that the original rubber lines did.  Lower the car after you are
done to inspect the lines making sure that none of them are in a binding
situation.  There should be some slack in the brake line in every condition.  If
there isn't slack, reposition the line until there is some.  Recheck the brakes
lines after you have run the car for a while to make sure the lines are free and
not kinked.

"The problem that I have seen with these brake lines over time is that they
become stiff and try to loosen themselves up and cause a leak or become brittle
and break where the fittings are swaged on.  I have seen and/or heard of quite a
few of these braided steel Teflon brake lines failing over the years and I only
remember seeing one stock rubber line that had failed so I have to recommend
against steel lines for street use.  For a race car they are fine because race
cars receive a very high level of maintenance."

 - 30 -
_________________________________________________________________________

I would agree with you mechanic that s/s hoses for parking-lot-style autox is
very questionable.  The problem there tends to be cold brakes and not over-hot
ones!  His reference to failure at the swaged fittings is correct.

I would add to what Bruce has written that you should check the lines from lock
to lock, on the ground, at least try to imagine addition slack needed as a
corner would be loaded out on the track.  Have a friend double-check.  (A friend
and I did his one day, mine the next.)  Like Bruce, I have seen a number of s/s
hose failures, and no rubber hose failures.

If you secure the front s/s hoses to the strut with cable ties, be sure to first
wrap the s/s hose with, say, a section of slit fuel hose.  The edges of some
cable ties are very sharp and will wear quickly through the steel and Teflon.

In my track experience (humble, but I do pound on my brakes), changing to s/s
hoses netted me absolutely zero benefit.  What has helped me is:

 - adding braking cooling scoops and ducting (Holbert kit for 944's),
 - higher temp brake fluid (currently AP 550),
 - pad compound choice (currently Cool Carbon, wonderful for street, autox,
   and track),
 - sufficiently thick pads and rotors (rotors have wear limit stamped on hub),
 - front/rear proportioning valve adjustment (esp. in 914's), and
 - bleed, bleed, bleed!

Subject: 914 spongy brakes

I inadvertantly deleted the original message, but with prodding from Kevin,
I'll offer my thoughts.

Nun's knowledge (Stan's term?) talks about ss lines, 911 master cylinders and
adjustable proportioning valves.  Before changing to non-stock components, 
you should consider whether the rest of the system is correct.  I have one
914 with the stock proportioning valve that has a nice solid pedal.  I have 
another with ss lines and an adjustable proportioning valve that sometimes
has a slightly spongy pedal.  George Hussey of Automobile Atlanta fame recently
answered a similar question in Mid Engine Views, but even he missed one of the
possible causes.  I'm doing this from memory, without that article or the 
workshop manual, so I'll probably miss more.

For 914 (and many other cars) with spongy brakes, check for the following poss.
causes:

1) Front wheel bearings bad or improperly adjusted.  Any play will retract the 
caliper piston and increase pedal travel, resulting in a spongy feel.  Nun
knowledge often tells you that 911 and 914 front wheel bearings are supposed 
to have some play.  This is absurd for a high performance vehicle and 
reference to the manual will reveal the proper specification as "tight enough
to just be able to move the washer" or words to that effect.  The key word here
 is just.  If you meet
this requirement, there will be no perceptible play.  I won a protest at the 
87 parade on this point.  Play in the rear wheel bearings would do the same 
thing, but is less likely.

2) Bad discs, either grooved, pitted or especially warped.  Anything that causes
the surface of the disc to be uneven can knock back the piston, again 
causing spongyness.  I just found this on my street car, which had spent several
years in layup and had lots of pitting on one disc.

3) Air in the system.  The rear brakes can be hard to bleed after major 
maintenance, prob due to the proportioning valve.  I find it helpful to rebleed
after a day, with the car sitting in a different position.

4) Sticking calipers.  I'm not referring to a frozen piston.  I'm talking about
a bonding between the piston seal and the piston, pulling the piston away from
intimate contact with the disc when brakes are no longer applied.  This
 condition is  discussed in the intro to the brake chapter in the workshop 
manual and you can check for it by measuring the clearance between pad and disc. 
I believe Porsche specifies a maximum of .008 in.  Corrective action is to 
exercise the caliper per the manual or rebuild if that doesn`t work.  My brakes 
always feel firmer with new pads, by the way.

5) Possibly a defective master cylinder?

6) The rest of the items already discussed.

If I were chasing spongy brakes, I would:

 -bleed, bleed, bleed (in Kevin's words)
 -Tighten or change wheel bearings, as appropriate
 -Put on new discs/change pads
 -exercise or rebuild calipers
 -change master cylinder for a new one
 
 - then consider lines
 - finally consider proportioning valve

The significance of the last two is considerably overrated.

I've probably left something out, but I hope you find this helpful.

Subject: 914 wiring harness removal


    Greetings again.
       This may sound strange, but has anyone out there completely removed
    the wire harness from a 914?  I would really like to get the harness
    out of the body so i can quit worrying about messing it up with the
    paint stripper, and blasting media.
       I have pulled most of it off of each end of the body, but the biggest
    headache is getting the ganglia to pass thru the rear bulkhead.  There
    is a pair of grommeted holes the harness passes thru from the engine
    compartment to the cockpit -these are very tight and i doubt the harness
    will pass without removing something from that end of the wires.
       The factory must have installed the harness and then placed housings
    on the pre-terminated wires, as was the case with the headlight wiring.
       The rearward wiring in the harness uses mostly crimped on terminals
    on each wire, but the relay board uses a large multi-pin connector.
       I have considered cutting the bulkhead holes open and adding PEM's
    to close them again after servicing the harness, but this seems drastic.
       I wish I knew how the factory installed the harness.
       I wish i knew how Zuffenhausen did a lot of things.

Subject: Re: 914 spongy brakes

Also, to dredge this up again, "upgrading" the  914 master cylinder to
a 19mm 911 MC makes the pedal feel "firmer" by reducing your
mechanical advantage - sort of like moving your hands closer to the
fulcrum of a lever.  It is a mistake to think this will solve the
spongy pedal problem, the only reason to change to the 19mm MC is if
you need to move more brake fluid (because you installed larger
calipers).  Note that changing to the 21mm (928) MC can be dangerous -
that MC was made to be used with boost, and the effort required to
depress the pedal and brake hard w/o power assist is often enough to
break the pedal.

914s, because of the small MC, should have excellent brakes, the best
recommendation is to keep it stock, check all components, and bleed.

Subject: brakes again

at the risk of adding extraneous material, my .02 on brakes.

I highly recommend putting in a proportioning valve (adjustable) on your
914.  I had one on my six  (the garretson model).  It worked fine.  Once it
was set we never had to reset it.  I just performed a number of wheel locking
stops, until we had it set to where the front wheels locked just before the
rears.

I used stainless lines on the six and on my current SC.  The lines on the
six were installed about 1984 or 85 and are still fine.  I talk to the current
owner occasionally.  I put stainless lines on the SC in 1987 and they are
still fine.  I do check them a couple of times a year or so.  When I was
doing more PCA track events I checked them more frequently.

The stainless lines on both of the above cars are not of the any idiot can
assemble variety.  They have swaged on (crimped on) ends and are dash 3.

I have the Holbert Brake Cools on the SC.  They do help.

Use good brake fluid!  I recommend the Wilwood 570 deg fluid or AP550 if you
do a lot of track events.  The only downside is that those fluids are very
hydroscopic and most be bled (flushed) prior to each event.

A much less hydroscopic fluid is Castrol LMA, but it will boil much quicker
under hard braking.  You might want to try Ate SL brake fluid.  I remember 
using it successfully a couple of years ago.   The only current dealer I know
for it is Northstar Motorsports in Wauconda, IL  area code 708.  If you talk
to Brian, say hi for me.  Ate SL is DOT 4 fluid.

I also run stainless  lines on the Mini and check them frequently. They have
been on the car for 3 years.  Just before the  last race, I noticed a kink
in one of the fronts and replaced that line.   That is the only problem I
have noticed so far.


as they say, your mileage may vary.

Subject: Basic Questions (+ a 914 question)

Hi!

I've got a 914-specific question, and a few general questions here.

First the general beginner-style questions:
The VDO odometer in my 914 stopped logging miles even before I got the car. 
Since the speedometer works, I assume that the sender is fine and that it's
some gear within the odometer that's stripped, slipped out of position, or 
something. The question involves the legality of popping it open to fix it. 
Actually, I know that it's illegal to open an odometer in California, the 
question is just how illegal is it? It's unlikely that I'll be selling the 
car (I prefer to drive my cars forever -- my poor late Volvo got over 220,000 
miles on it, and would have gotten more if it had been stick)... Any 
recommendations?

Second, the engine of my 914 ('73, 2.0 litre) is leaking oil in small 
quantities. After any drive that gets the temperature up for a while, it 
will leak oil at the rate of two or three drops a minute. The previous owner 
left the car sitting for about eight years in his driveway, and I'm assuming 
that smog or something attacked one of the gaskets or seals. The problem is 
finding the leak. What's the right way to clean all the old accumulated 
grime off an engine? I've heard of steam-cleaning engines, but have been 
told by at least one Porsche mechanic that he wouldn't recommend it because 
of the possibility that there's a bad gasket (he said the steam cleaning 
could drive nasty deposits in through the same places that the oil is 
leaking). 

OK, now for a 914-specific question. Has anybody found a good way 
to improve the windshield-spraying system? The previous owner tells me that 
over the course of ten years, he replaced the water reservoir three times, 
and that each time it developed pressure leaks. As it is now, it leaks air 
pressure until the shut-off prevents it from emptying the spare.
I'm not committed to keeping the car stock - if there's a good system, I 
want to use it. Living in L.A., you get lots of dust and smoke stuck on your 
windshield, and it never rains to wash it off :)

Thanks (and sorry if these are too basic. I gotta start somewhere.)

Subject: 914 speedo

In response to Samuel Goldstein's 914 speedometer question, which I can't
seem to include in this post:

I also had a couple of these have the odometer stop while the speedometer
keeps on working, and since my car was not in great shape I decided to
open one up myself rather than send it to VDO for $$.  I think we're talking
about the same unit here, the 150mph since mine was also a '73.
Opening the thing up is not easy if you want it to look good when you put
it back together (crimped ring).  The pry marks on it though will be on the
back where it won't be obvious.  If I remember correctly, mine didn't have
anything stripped, but the drive at the end of the real odometer is on the
end of a smooth steel shaft, and after so much time and a bit of grease,
it just turned on the shaft.  What I did to fix it was to add some epoxy
to hold the drive on the shaft, and to disconnect the trip odometer from
it, which is a large load on it.  The reduced load let the crude fix stay
fixed until I junked the car.  I probably still have the speedo somewhere.
This fix is okay assuming you don't need to trip odometer to work.  I can't
remember how to disconnect the trip odo, but I'm sure it will be obvious
once you see it. 
My 2 cents

This was the case on mine also.
The first time I got the car over 100mph, it started working again.

I opened one of those bad odometer on a 74 2.0.
One of the plastic gear was stripped.  I should have send it
to VDO.  The one in my 914/6 is also not working.  
Where is VDO in the northest?

Yes, I removed everything off my 914. It was Mr. tin-man last
summer.  All the paint was blasted off, even the bottom side.
It was a lot of work but not that bad for the harness. 
You pointed out the terminals at the end
of each wire; well, in many cases, I had to pull one wire
thru the grommet at a time. Just can't pull a complete bunch
at one time.

Try to label everything. It really helps you to put thing back.

Subject: K-Jetronic questions..

Hello there.
I am new to this group and am wondering if anyone can tell me about
BOSCH K-Jetronic fuel injection that was fitted to (turbo) 930's
supposedly (NB this may be our local (Australia) market but I don't
know)
Apparrently it is a fairly simple mechanical injection system with a
'Depression plate' that actuactes some form of valve that controls flow
to the fuel injector(s).. Ie a glorified variable jet carburettor.

What I'd like to know is how easy is it to tune,or set up if you have it
on a modified or another engine (I'd like to put it on a **Eek** mazda
13B rotary),And the K-jet was on ~2.5 liter volvos here,which is about
the same capacity as the 13B,hence my question about setting it up.

Oh,BTW we don't have any 914's here. Only:356,924,944,928,911,968, plus a
few 911's in a **959** body kit (look pretty tough).

Thank you for any information about the injection,.
Craig.

I don't really have an answer to any of your questions.  I have bought VDO parts
from North Hollywood Spedometer, who are a distributor for VDO and advertise in

The previous owner of my 914 found one solution to that type of problem.  He
installed an electrical pump in the lines between the resevoir and the washers.
 He got the hoses out of the passenger compartment completely, and could
disconnect the air pressure hose from the spare.

The pump is located on one of the vertical posts behind the gas tank in the
front boot.  I think he did this one while the tank was out for some other
reason.  Anyway, he put a switch down under the dash (by where the Trip
Odometer reset knob is) to turn the thing on and off.  It works alright, I
guess--I don't really use it that much.  Usually, I just wipe off the
windshield with a towel while I wait for the little sucker to warm up.

I have heard of people doing a similar conversion, but putting the electrical
switch on the same arm that activates it now.  This requires disassembly of
(part of) the steering column, which is just a bit out of my league.
