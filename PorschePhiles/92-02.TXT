Subject: Questions related to preparing car for track season


Well, come March 20, I'll be heading up to Lime Rock for the first time this
season. I figure last year I learned enough to get myself in trouble
pretty bad, without the experience to get out. The solution is of course
to get into trouble at autocrosses instead. :)

No, but really, I'm going to put harnesses into my car this season.
I have an '88 951S. My questions are of course:

1) What kind of harness (beyond the 'H', 5-pt model) should I get? In
terms of buckle, straps, etc.

2) What kind of mounting should I get? Who should I get to install it?
(I'm in the New Haven, CT area) It should be noted that I would like
to retain the car as "stock" as possible. I've heard cons about using
the factory bolt-in for the shoulder straps.

3) How much is this going to run me? This is a year where money is a
bit more scarce. Where would you recommend I buy the equipment.

Okay; that's my safety plug for the year. Now is my tires question. I
know this has been belted over and over. I have Bridgestone RE71's, but
their street tires (and damn good ones) which I had the misfortune to
wreck a set of last year at the track. I'd like good (and inexpensive)
tires... And the place where I can get them inexpensively.

Finally, I'd like to know where I can get DS-11 (or similar) pads for
my car, inexpensively. I figure my current set has one or two more
weekends at the track before needing replacement. Having paid $300 for
'em last time I figure I got ripped.

Well, PorschePeople, thanks for the time and I'd appreciate all the
grossly in depth information you can supply.

Thanks,

Doug
CVR member, Metro wannabe ;)

Subject: Monthly Update


February 1992
Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

As racing and autox season is upon us, expect heavy traffic on the list
from people trying to get their cars ready. Don't feel inferior if you
don't know what they talking about. However, conside this an official
note of encouragement to contact your local PCA or SCCA chapter and get
involved. You'll like it. Trust me.

If you haven't joined PCA, please consider doing so. To join, call
(703) 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST. Have your Visa/MC number *AND*
your VIN number handy, if you own a car. Dues are $36/year. They'll be
happy to sign you up. There are other ways to join, but I figure you're
all instant gratification type people so...

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are about 125 members of the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes).

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address. Such messages are discarded.

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: request for info (about *you*, singly and severally)

Geeze, I know I'm going to regret this, just before another trip and
all, but hey...

I've decided that I want to try one more time to compile a list of what
everyone drives. So, if you could send me a one-liner, with your name,
where you live (like "Houston, TX" or "Outer Snowshoe, NE" or whatever),
and what you drive (like "'81 911SC" or "'74 Vega" or "nothing").
And, if you have multiples, particularly multiple P-cars, list 'em all.

I'll post the results. I may even do this every month like the autox
guys do. Who knows where it could all lead....

Stan

P.S. BTW, this came about as I was trying to help someone figure out who
else drove what they did, figuring that it could be easier to extract
info from a few people than the whole list, particularly as this wasn't
very interesting. So this isn't just idle curiosity, it could be useful
next time you need to know where to get a 3rd undersize main bearing
for a Carrera GS or something...

Disclaimer: The remaining text is only for those wishing a higher
understanding of braking systems, the original thread is from a
few months ago.  If your still interested please read on as I
believe the original thread contained much misinformation IMHO.
_______________________________________________________________

The first 2 Excerpts are from Panorama (The Porsche Club of Americas'
monthly rag, The respondent is Bruce Anderson highly regarded
"certified Porsche person").  The last excerpt is from "Prepare to
Win" written by Carroll Smith "certified racing person")

-------- Excerpt From Panorama 12/83 ----------------------- 
914 OWNER: Braided steel brake lines: I recently installed braided steel
brake lines on a 914 I have owned for several years and I feel that
the brake pedal is more spongy now than it was befor I made the
change.  I have bled the brake several times and the pedal still feels
spongy.  What is my problem?  

Bruce Anderson Replies: 
I also have experienced similar problems and have done some
investigation to termine the cause.  I feel that the spongy brake
pedal is cause by the fact that sometimes we are not getting the
proper braided steel teflon brake lines for the job.  The diameter of
the braided steel teflon hose is too larg and the braid is not a tight
enough weave.  I have compared some of these aftermarket braided steel
brake lines with those that we get from Porsche factory for the
Porsche 935 race cars and find them to be much different.  The factory
lines are a very small diameter wiht a high quality tightly woven
outer housing.  You can get the parts to assemble similar high quality
lines but the preassembled samples I have examined do not seem to be
up to the job

	The teflon braided steel hoses that these brake lines are made
from come in dash sizes.  Most of the manufacturers of these
replacement brake lines use a dash for size hose, when dash three
would be a better [four] [when I was at Averill racing supply asking
about hoses he told me that -4 is too big and that -3 was the ticket.
-4, he said, would be too spongey]

solution.  The dash four hos has too much surface area and allows the
hose to flex as much and possibly more than the stock lines.  The
reason for this is that this large diameter hose presents too much
surface area to the hydraulic pressure which cause the lines to flex
resulting in a spongy brake pedal.

	Another problem that I have experienced with some of the
preassemgbled brake lines is inconsistent lengths which can cause
broken brake lines if they err to the short side.  Also with age, old
lines will take a set and get stiff and the working of the suspension
can loosen the fittings causing leakage.  Some manufacturers of these
braided steel brake lines go on to recommend that the brak lines be
installled only by professionals who can be sure that they are
installed properly.

---- Bruce Anderson followes up from Pano 10/84

Braided steel brake lines revisited: In the December 1983 issue I
discussed the problems that I have seen with aftermarket braided steel
brake lines and my thoughts on the probable causes.  One of the major
suppliers of braided steel brake lines has contacted me to let me know
the latest on commercially available braided steel brake lines and
some of the history behind some of the problems we as users have
experienced.  First, the -3 size hose is now available which satisfies
my main objection to the previsouly available -4 braided steel brake
lines.  There have been some additional problems whith some of the
braided lines on the market.  About a year ago some inferior thin-wall
teflon hose got onto the market.  The problem was caught but not until
some of the thin-wall hose was sold and used.  This thin-wall hose
also aggravated the soft pedal problem I mentioned in my December
column.  An additional problem has been caused by some discounters
selling a commercial grade, tin-plated steel line which is also of
inferior quality.
	The supplier also provided some background on the "recommended for
competition only" tag that appears on most of these aftermarket
braided steel brake lines.  In 1966-67 the U.S. government was
considering legislation to define requirements for brake line
manufacturers.  Rather than worry about the legislation the
manufacturers chose to put these tags on their brake lines indicating
that the brake lines are not recommended for street use.  It turned
out that there never was any legislation governing the manufacture of
passenger car brake lines.  One of the leading manufacturers says that
they have had prototype hoses tested to the DOT recommendations and
their hoses exceeded the recommendations in all categories.  They do
go on to warn users that they should not install the hose kits
themselves.  They recommend having a professional mechanic install
them and having the mechanic check to be sure that there can be no
combination of wheel travel that can cause stretching or crimping of
the hoses.
	In conclusion, let me say that there is nothing wrong with braided
steel brake lines.  All of the successful race cars in the world use
them.  However, if you get inferior braided steel brake lines or they
are improperly installed you may have created a worse problem for
yourself than the one you thought you were solving.  One of the car
world's most frightening experiences is having the brakes fail, right
up there next to having the throttle jam wide open.


------------Excerpt From PREPARE TO WIN by Carrol Smith------------------
						   HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS

	I have yet to see a new race car delivered with brake and clutch
plumbing that is unsafe.  A noticeable functional improvement can and
should be made by substituting Aeroquip 66000 series Teflon and
stainless steel flexible pressure lines for the often supplied fabric
and neoprene units. This eliminates line swelling under pressure,
resulting in a firmer brake pedal, which in turn improves the
drivers's feel and hence his control of the vehicle under braking.

-----------------------------End of Excerpt------------------------------

Well that's it, I know everyone can draw their own conclusions,
but in one of Kevins original posts he stated something to the effect that
<If your rubber line swells then it needs replacement>.

Obviously you don't want to get stuck with inferior lines but C. Smith
makes it very clear to use the Aeroquip lines PERIOD!

(BTW Kevin I hope the references are good enough)

	I have yet to see a new race car delivered with brake and clutch
plumbing that is unsafe.  A noticeable functional improvement can and
should be made by substituting Aeroquip 66000 series Teflon and
stainless steel flexible pressure lines for the often supplied fabric
and neoprene units. This eliminates line swelling under pressure,
resulting in a firmer brake pedal, which in turn improves the
drivers's feel and hence his control of the vehicle under braking.

-----------------------------End of Excerpt------------------------------

Well that's it, I know everyone can draw their own conclusions,
but in one of Kevins original posts he stated something to the effect that
<If your rubber line swells then it needs replacement>.

Obviously you don't want to get stuck with inferior lines but C. Smith
makes it very clear to use the Aeroquip lines PERIOD!

(BTW Kevin I hope the references are good enough)

Just my 2 cents about braided steel brake lines.

I bought a set from imparts ($46) about 8 months ago.  After I installed the
lines (and flushed and bled the brake system with the nifty little vacuum
thingy) the car had the hardest brake pedal I've ever felt.

About a week later, I drove an autocross where they checked the pedal feel
during tech.  The inspecter mentioned that my car had the first hard pedal
he'd seen that day.

Unfortunately, I don't know if the lines are aeroequip (?) or not, or 
whether they are -3 or -4.

I don't think I'll ever go back to rubber lines tho'...

Subject: EFI Diagnostic equipment

I am looking to buy some diagnostic equipment to tune and
troubleshoot my Electronic Fuel Injection system (Bosch Motronic
in particular). Anyone out there have experience with this???

I'd like to be able to check out oxygen sensors and do some
open loop fuel mixture adjustments. Some articles I've read
say that a scope is needed to look at an oxygen sensor.
Apparently the voltages at an oxygen sensor should display
sharp peaks and valleys. When it has started to decay it will
still make corrections but not as "assertively" (for lack of
a better word). Has anyone used a scope for this or a DMM???

Also has anyone adjusted the open loop fuel mixture (with the oxygen
sensor disabled)??? Is it possible to use a DMM on the disconnected
oxygen sensor to check the mixture instead of buying an exhaust gas
analyzer?

What about these ~$400 Fluke 80 series DMM's? Are they worth the
money for this type of work? Will I still need a scope? Is anyone
still listening to these questions... ?


Thanks in advance.

Hello fellow netters,

I've been waiting for all Winter looking to buy a double-axle trailer
for the Corvette, no luck.

So this is what I am looking for:

Absolute Requirements:
	Double Axle, 
	NO! Gooseneck trailers,
	4000 lb min.

Would be nice:
	Electric brakes,
	Electric / Manual wench.
	Tire Rack.

I will be using a BB Suburban to haul with, hence the 
"NO! Gooseneck" req.

I know what I can have one built for, but I figured I should
be able to get a decent deal, considering the time of year,
and the economy.

BTW I am located in Ann Arbor MI, so location is another consideration
(The closer the better).

Thanks in advance

Oh come on, give him a break. Maybe he just needs a wench who is skilled in
electric and hand tools to be the head mechanic for his pit crew...  :-)

Oh, come on, Judith!  Electric wenches are the Fizzball way!  You
leave them on a shelf all day while they get charged up, and then
when you need to use them, you press a button and they let you
screw for hours.  It's much better than getting your wrists tired
out twisting and twisting by hand.  You just have to remember to
lubricate the studs from time to time or the nuts can get too hot
from continued screwing with an electric wench.  A long extension 
and a couple of deep sockets and you're set.

A spot of grease around the base of the nipple (sealing the threads), works
wonders.  Be sure to remove the grease once done, don't want it melting onto
your brakes.

Don -

Excellent research!  I was unaware of Bruce Anderson's prior musings, and have
not read Smith's book.  It is only fair that I in turn, despite my miserable
typing skills, pass along the latest from Bruce on this subject, which appeared
in the Dec '91 Excellence.  As long as I am filtching from them, I might as well
point out that this is a really neat magazine devoted to Porsches.
_________________________________________________________________________

"A Word of Caution About Replacement Brake Hoses

"Stock rubber hoses are fine for a street car.  In fact, I prefer them.  They
are a low maintenance item and very seldom fail.  Their most common failure mode
is swelling from old age or contaminated brake fluid.

"The Teflon braided hoses are designed for race cars where they will receive
heavy maintenance and frequent inspections.  All of the successful race cars in
the world use these braided steel hoses.  However, if you get an inferior
product, or if they are improperly installed, you can create a worse problem for
yourslef than the one you think you are solving.  There is probably no more
frightening experience than having brakes fail, so be very careful and check out
the fit of your aftermarket brake lines very carefully.  If one fails, the
results can be tragic.

"I know, I know, a lot of people use steel lines for their street cars.  If you
feel you must switch to the Teflon braided steel lines, be sure that they are
dash three size hoses.  The dash for size that was some common a few years ago
on the aftermarket actually causes a spongy brake pedal.  When you install
stainless steel brake lines, make sure they match the same position and folow
the same lay that the original rubber lines did.  Lower the car after you are
done to inspect the lines making sure that none of them are in a binding
situation.  There should be some slack in the brake line in every condition.  If
there isn't slack, reposition the line until there is some.  Recheck the brakes
lines after you have run the car for a while to make sure the lines are free and
not kinked.

"The problem that I have seen with these brake lines over time is that they
become stiff and try to loosen themselves up and cause a leak or become brittle
and break where the fittings are swaged on.  I have seen and/or heard of quite a
few of these braided steel Teflon brake lines failing over the years and I only
remember seeing one stock rubber line thathad failed so I have to recommend
against steel lines for street use.  For a race car they are fine because race
cars receive a very high level of maintenance."
_________________________________________________________________________

I would add that you should check the lines from lock to lock, on the ground, at
at least try to imagine addition slack needed as a corner would be loaded out on
the track.  Have a friend double-check.  (A friend and I did his one day, mine
the next.)

If you secure the front s/s hoses to the strut with cable ties, be sure to first
wrap the s/s hose with, say, a section of slit fuel hose.  The edges of some
cable ties are very sharp and will wear quickly through the steel and Teflon.

I have been told that the 944 Turbo S takes the same dimension pad as the 962,
except that it must be ground to 18 or 19 mm instead of 25 mm.  That being the
case, Pegasus has them as item FRP304-DS11, $130 a set.  414 782 0880.  If they
can't supply them, let me know and I'll ask someone I know has used them from
some source or another.

You should also probably check into available carbon metallic pads.  I am not
familiar with the differences between "black," "blue," and "red" variants of
same.  My mechanic recently told me that he has a line on a new twist on these:
apparently the pads come with a thermally insulating backing plate, which
reduces the heat flow to the calliper quite a bit.  If interested, give Jerry
Pellgrino a call at 508 651 1316.

I assume you saw my description of my harness set-up in mail at some point over
the last few months, and won't repeat it here!

A real hazard to SS braided lines is that a nicked wire can lead to a ballooning
of the tube, and possibly its rupture. For street use, Aeroquip and maybe
some others, have rubber-coated SS braided lines that protect the braid from the
hazards associated with street use. They don't look neat, but work just as well.
(And are impossible to tell from stock, if you get the right ends!)

For the survey:

mostly stock, except
strut bar
holbert brake cools
SS brake lines
no cat converter or air pump.
16x7s and 16x8s


One more note on SS lines.   I put the lines on almost five years ago and
the brake pedal is hard as a rock.  Do SS lines require periodic replacement,
it is hard to tell just looking at the lines??

Subject: Questions related to preparing car for track season

| 1) What kind of harness (beyond the 'H', 5-pt model) should I get? In
| terms of buckle, straps, etc.

I bought the old 'aircraft' style harness - it's a lot cheaper than the
new 'cam-lock' style (about 1/2 the price), but a lot more of a hassle
getting strapped in at race-time. I got a 6-point model since it was
easier to mount the crotch straps that way. I only had to drill two
holes for the sholder straps -- the lap belts use the existing mounts.
The crotch straps bolt into pre-existing holes in the bottom of the
seat.

| 2) What kind of mounting should I get? Who should I get to install it?
| (I'm in the New Haven, CT area) It should be noted that I would like
| to retain the car as "stock" as possible. I've heard cons about using
| the factory bolt-in for the shoulder straps.

Make sure you use grade-8 nuts and bolts. Don't try to use the rear
seat-belt mounting points for the sholder belts -- you'll compress your
spine - the angle is all wrong. In my '87 951, there are two little
dimples in the sheet metal on the rear deck just behind the fuel tank
(as if the factory had anticipated people installing harnesses) -- I
just drilled holes using those dimples as guides and put a 2"x5" steel
plate underneath the car to reinforce the deck (NOTE: don't take my word
that the dimples provide the optimal position for the harness! Be very
careful when drilling back there!)

| 3) How much is this going to run me? This is a year where money is a
| bit more scarce. Where would you recommend I buy the equipment.

I bought my stuff at Racer's Wholesale (they have an 800 number, but I
don't have their catalog handy at the moment - try 800-555-1212) a few
months ago for about $80. I've heard from fellow track junkies that
these guys are generally the cheapest around.

| Okay; that's my safety plug for the year. Now is my tires question. I
| know this has been belted over and over. I have Bridgestone RE71's, but
| their street tires (and damn good ones) which I had the misfortune to
| wreck a set of last year at the track. I'd like good (and inexpensive)
| tires... And the place where I can get them inexpensively.

I did the same thing with my street RE71's (the chunking was pretty
dramatic!). I now track on Yokohama 008rs ~$130/tire from Tire Rack
(another 800 number you'll have to find for yourself). Not only do they
hold up better than the RE71's, but the stick is absolutely incredible!
The Comp T/A R1's are also very popular (and some think better), but
they're another $20-30 extra per-tire.

| Thanks for the information about the harnesses. Just one more question.
| Can you mount the passenger harness the same way as the driver harness?

Probably - there are no dimples in the rear deck on that side, and the
fuel tank extends further to the rear, though (as I remember). You may
have to mount the passenger harness more forward than the driver's side.
I have a second-hand second harness and have been thinking about
installing it, but haven't made the attempt yet.

Good luck,
Steve

[and just to reiterate: on older 944's, the rear deck mounting positions
are in a very different location than on my '87. It wouldn't surprise me
if the factory changed things again for '88.  I spent about an hour
sticking my head up above the muffler trying to convince myself that I
wouldn't hit the gas tank when I drilled (not to mention agonizing about
actually drilling a hole in my baby...) 'Twas well worth it though. The
harness really improves your ability to control your car. Between it,
the yokohamas and an 88 951S front suspension upgrade, I bettered my
time by about 4 seconds at Rd. Atlanta (I attribute another 4 to some
great instruction and practice, practice, practice).]

Subject: Shock places

I'm ready to get new struts for the 914...  I'm leaning towards Koni because
they have a contingency program for Solo II.  Is that correct?  How much do
they pay for Solo II Tour and National events?  Do any other shock companies
have contingency programs?  If so, do they make a 914 competition strut?

I remember someone (Doug, maybe?) had a connection with the Shock Warehouse...
Does anyone have a phone number (800 numbers are much preferred)?  Any other
recommendations on where to get struts cheap is quite welcome.

I'm really interested mostly in Koni, 'cause I know they're good.  I'd also
consider Bilstein.  I am not interested in Boge, KYB, Sachs, Tokico, or
Monroe unless someone can convince me that they have a contingency program
or have other redeeming features other than price.  I'd also consider GAB if
they have struts for my application.  Phone numbers, please.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Wish me luck gang! I am putting a lot of faith in the 924 T-FH (Turbo From
Hell) this weekend. I leave Kingston Ontario on Friday afternoon and ram
through to Rochester NY. The next part of the trip is where I need the luck
given the "reliability" level of this car. I am leaving late Saturday afternoon
for Toronto Ontario and I have to be there by 6 a.m. Sunday or I forfeit a
great whopping bit of airfare. Given it will be Saturday Night with a lot of
miles through the middle of nowhere, I can't depend on finding a rental car
if the little brute lets me down. Sure hope I don't have to call on you guys
to bring that trailer you've been talking about.  ;-)
I really hope I don't have any horror stories for you when I get back.
Hope I get a chance to fix up that waste gate before we leave!

Mark -

I don't have a direct answer to your questions.  I would recommend picking up a
copy of Probst's book: Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management, pub. Robt
Bentley.  It covers theory and trouble-shooting Bosch systems pretty well.

And since you drive a 951, the factory workshop manuals are helpful.  Check out
chapter 28 in both Volume 1 of the main series and in the 944 Turbo manual. 
Update #21, which came out in 1989, added a chapter which gives a detailed plan
of attack to diagnosing the 944S and 944S2 DME (pp. D 24/28-1 through -33). 
Although written for these models, and assuming in part you have the 9288 or
9268 tool, lot of the information and test procedures are nonetheless generic.

Happy hunting!

Kevin

Subject: RE: EFI

Kevin,
        Actually it's the manuals that started me off thinking
about all of this. Specifically these service information booklets:

        WKD-491-321     1985 944 Turbo Service Information
        WKD-453-920     1985 944 Turbo DME/KLR Service Info.

The first one is about 80 pages and costs $1.22. The second is about
40 pages and costs $5.94. They explain the car and fuel injection systems
very well, with voltages and and other specifications, though certainly
not everything I would want. I don't have a copy of the Bentley book
you talk about, but I've been meaning to get one.

There are also special service information booklets on the 944 Turbo S,
ABS brakes, and Air Bags. They also cost ~$6.00 each. I can get the
numbers if anyone would like.

Apparently the European/ROW DME unit is the same as the American one
except for an altitude compensator (US) and some other "coding plug"
connection to the DME left open. The specification for open loop CO
adjustment is 0.6+/-0.2 %CO on the US car and 1.0+/-0.5%CO on the
European/ROW car. Assuming the European car did not have a CAT
(I'm pretty sure about this), would it hurt the CAT or cause it
to run too hot if I bumped up the CO adjustment to 1% or even 1.5%?
As I understand it when your foot is heavy on the gas (throttle valve
gap of 65 degrees or more) a "full load" contact is triggered and
the computer ignores the oxygen sensor anyway. So the computer really
only regulates emissions at part throttle and idle. This is one
reason why the wastegate dumps directly into the exhaust downstream
of the CAT. Anyone know what it takes to damage or destroy a CAT,
short of dumping raw gas into it???

Everyone, please no flames about tampering with emissions. I have no
intention of taking off the catalytic converter or doing anything
seriously bad. I would just like to understand the car a little more
and optimize it.

Thanks.

Subject: Weltmeister tubular torsion bars

Weltmeister has a new type of torsion bar which is tubular instead of solid.
They say they're a little lighter, and are stronger so they have longer
lifetimes than the solid bars.  They're also a little more expensive than the
solid bars.

Anyone have any opinion about this?  I will be ordering something this weekend
at the latest, so any feedback is welcome.  I'm leaning towards the tubular
bars, on the theory that newer is probably better and lighter is definitely
better (for a race car).

As you can see, this takes in much of the USA outside the Northeast, and
I'm willing to make diversions from the most direct route; I could just
as easily go through, say, Huntsville, AL, and Amarillo, TX (on the
Atlanta/Salt Lake leg) as I could through Nashville, TN, and St.Louis,
MO.
 
My schedule is somewhat flexible, and I'll be travelling alone for most
of the distance, so any type of car is all right.  I'm a sympathetic
driver and a good mechanic, too, if it comes to that.
 
I'll fly if no one needs a car moved, but it would be more fun to meet
a few netters and help someone out if I can.
 
This isn't really a "net" subject, so if you have a car you need moved
along this (approximate) route, contact me directly.  Please accept my
apology if you see this on more than one car-oriented list.

Hey,

In my recent 914 information quest, the subject of replacing the fuel
injection w/ dual webers/dell's/etc.has come up several times. However,
whenever this is mentioned, people say that there is a good amount of
power increase, and it's generally a good idea- IF DONE CORRECTLY.

My question is- How is this done correctly?  Or, how can I tell if it
has been done corectly if I buy a car which already has this
modification?

As it stands now, I plan on looking for a car with this mod., or doing
it myself after buying the car.  Are there any warnings, etc. or
encouragements/advice anyone has to offer?

thanks,

If your state tracks emissions like they do here (Utah, home of mountain snow and 
valley smog) the conversion of FI to carbs is ILLEGAL for street use.  I believe 
that Automotion sells these types of kits, and that they state in bolded letters
that the carb conversion is for offroad use only.

Nothing new here. George Stephens at RadTechRacing has been making these
for a long time. I think I recall seeing them from other sources too starting
about 3 years ago.

So long as you get the right spring constant, lighter should be better, as
in theory it will give you "quicker" spring response. The other "ligher
is better" part isn't that critical -- it's only a few pounds of *sprung*
weight, in (for you) about a 2000 pound car. You'd do better chopping out
your dash or something... 8{)

My problem is that given constant metal properties, I know how much additional
stiffness I get going from 17.9mm to 21mm bars. However, when one bar is
made of Brand X metal, and the other is Brand Y and is gun-drilled, I no 
longer know what the relative stiffness is. Any mech-eng or materials
guys out there?

Thanks for the numbers.  Yes, I would appreciate getting the others as well.

I don't know what performance difference you would see by bumping the CO to 1%. 
I know a friend whose mechanic gooses the CO a tad on an '80 928 for just this
reason.  I dunno if it makes any difference in reality.  The different emissions
numbers reflect cat/no cat.

As you point out, the throttle body has two limit switches: one for idle and one
for "wide open throttle".  When the WOT switch closes, the mixture is enriched
and runs at lambda in the range of .85 to .95.  The ignition timing is also
advanced for more power, subject to air temp and knocking.  I don't know that it
runs truly open loop wrt the lambda sensor; there doesn't seem to be any reason
to.

There are a number of ways to hose your cat.  If you run chronically much too
rich, the unburnt hydrocarbons will combust in the cat, getting it real hot. 
Apparently temperatures above 800 degrees C will cause the platinum and rhodium
coatings to sinter.  Misfiring also raises the temperature in the cat.  And you
can poison the cat with either leaded fuel, or with engine oil in the exhaust.

I don't know exactly what the DME coding plugs do.  I would guess that they
indicate what country-specific equipment you have in the car.  In the US, the
944 and 951 (but not the 944S or S2) have the altitude switch.  In Japan, there
is a temp sensor in the cat.  Etc.

Mark -

I passed along your questions to my friend the mechanic (MFTM).  He said that to
really get the CO number up, you have to disconnect the lambda sensor in
addition to making the adjustment at the air flow sensor.  Otherwise, the DME
will just try to bring the CO back down to spec.

He suggested that a better approach to this might be to replace the air flow
sensor's damping spring with a lighter one.  You'd get the faster response
you're looking for.

He also cautioned against running the engine much too rich.  The excess fuel can
wash the oil off the cylinder wall, leading to greatly accelerated wall wear and
contamination of the oil with gas.

Stan, here's the info ...

Now for a question ... I am going to try my hand at hillclimbing this year,
as this is my first foray into any form of motorsport has anyone any hints
and tips re car preparation (I don't have an F1 style budget :-( ).

Kevin,

I'd really like to start off by doing a basic adjustment of
the open-loop fuel mixture on my stock Bosch DME system. I'm
not looking to dramatically alter to CO number. Unfortunately,
I'm getting the idea that noone has done this. Thanks for your
help anyway. I'll let you know what I find out.

Hi-

Doubtless, this is a FAQ, so apologies in advance, but dammit I don't want to
wait until summer to finally try out the 924t I got last month.  The Dunlops
(16" D40/M2's) on it now should be great in May, but ought to be outlawed
between November and April.  I can't even get out of my driveway!

So, what would you all recommend for winter use here in snowy, hilly, slippery
Upstate NY?  I have 1 strong recommendation for Yokohama AVS U+4's, and beyond
that, no clue.  Any other thoughts?

Thanks!

Folks-
 
There are some interesting cars listed for sale in the Atlanta papers,
although not all of them are in Atlanta ...

Please don't call me about these cars, 'cause they aren't mine!  I will
be happy to help you check them out if you are seriously interested in
one of them, although I am no expert on any of the makes involved.
 
FYI, area code 404 is North Georgia (including Atlanta), 912 is South
Georgia, 205 is Alabama, and 615 is Tennessee.
 
I'm still planning on making my Atlanta-to-California trip in mid-late
March, and, although I have had one nibble on delivering a car to 
California, my travel plans are still open and still flexible, and I 
can deliver a drivable car to/from any point enroute.

I can't resist letting people know that Australian readers will
be extremely pained by the prices quoted in the original article
(I couldn't possibly repeat them).  You could easily quadruple
them to get a picture of what equivalents would be here in Oz,
although more so for the German machinery than the English or
Swedish toys :-).

Some interesting news from here: The oldest Porsche dealer in the
world outside of Germany has more or less collapsed.  Hamilton's
Porsche dealership of Melbourne (distributor of Porsche cars for
Australia since the early fifties) has been sold to Porsche Germany
to keep it afloat.  The poor economy, high prices and low volume
has taken their toll.  Unfortunately I missed the official release
of the 968 where all the details were made known, but that is the
gist.

This must be sad for the Hamilton family, who, from father to son,
has raced and sold Porsches since almost from day one.  However, I am
glad it is Porsche itself that are keeping the dealership going.
Perhaps in the future control will once again return to local hands.

Subject: survey  and brakes

Date: 10 Feb -- I sent this a few days ago -- it must have gotten lostin the
ether.

I can strongly recommend VCI in Dover NJ as a supplier of brakes.  Doug Arnao,
the owner, even holds the lap record for his class (I think in a 914) at Lime
Rock.  201-366-7800.  He helped me when I needed track brakes pads for my
944S2 (which seem to be in no catalogs) by realizing that this is the same pad
size as in the 930, for which there are Ferodos.


For the survey:


1989 944S2
Pirelli P700Z
stock, except
nifty removable Pioneer CD/radio
aforementioned 930 Ferodo pads
5-point belts

Mark,

I once attempted to adjust the idle mixture on my 951 by following the
procedure in the factory manual and Probst's FI book.  As you probably
know, this procedure amounts to reading the voltage from the oxygen
sensor while you turn the screw in the air flow meter.  Supposedly,
the voltage at the ideal setting (lambda = 1) is the average of the
high and low voltages seem by turning the screw one way then the other
(as I recall, clockwise richens the mixture and increases the sensor
voltage).  This reading should be about 0.5V.  The procedure is to be
performed with the engine at operating temperature and with the idle
speed control disabled as described in the manual.  I did not have the
oil temperature sensor that the manual recommends, so I had to guess
the operating temperature.  Unfortunately, at this temperature
(whatever it was) I was not able to see much difference in the sensor
reading as I turned the screw.  As the engine warmed up from a cold
start, the sensor voltage just steadily increased to a maximum voltage
of 0.8V and remained there regardless of the air flow meter setting.
I eventually gave up and decided to wait until I needed to go in for my
CA smog certificate and have an expert look at it.

Subject: Porsche 917 info???

Dear Gearheads:

Are there any 917s being raced in vintage events?  I'm primarily interested
in the coupe versions, but I'd also like to hear about any 917-10s or 917-30s
being raced as Can-Am types (still legal as SCCA ASR, right?).  I read
about a 917K converted for street use many years ago by some guy in LA.  I'd
appreciate any information on the current whereabouts of 917s.

Yes, at age 16 I saw the movie "Le Mans" 8 times....
THANKS!

Absolutely.  In fact, I think it would be sort of hard to measure the
voltage on the sensor without unplugging it, except by penetrating the
insulation somewhere or measuring the voltage at the DME box itself.

-Milo

P.S.: I should also add that the oxygen sensor was brand new at the
time I undertook the adjustment, in case there are any concerns about
the reliability of that part.  The thing that got me starting messing
around with this was a stumbling on acceleration from idle problem.  I
put my meter on the O2 sensor and got 0V.  Replacing the sensor solved
my problem.  I then proceded to try to set the idle mixture with the
new sensor and had the experience reported previously.

Subject: Boston Area Dealers

I just stopped by my friendly Porsche dealor on Saturday and found out that 
they had been sold and no longer service Prosches.  I bought my car at Annis
Porsche, Auid, VW on Route 9 in Natick.

I would be interested in hearing about other readers of this list success
with other Boston area dealerships or about private service operations.

Thanks

Joe Wieswenfeld
