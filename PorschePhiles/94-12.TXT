Hmmm.... I've seen four reports suggesting three different engines: a 
fairly conventional 1.3 liter DOHC gas motor, a similarly sized turbo diesel, 
and the diesel/electric hybrid. So, it's a bet.  A bottle of Texas' best 
(St. Genevieve Vintner's Reserve Cabernet) against whatever sort of thing 
you Californians are calling wine these days... Terms: if there's not an 
electric hybrid offered, I pay up at Parade; if there is, you do. If one 
shows up later (like next November or something), we'll work something out 
for the Parade in Oklahoma the year following.

Congrats!

I bought a Century infant seat that fits fine (forward only) in the back of
my '87.  The key was to find one that includes an adjustment for the height
at the point underneath the bum.  With this adjustment all the way out, the
part that was too wide to fit is positioned above the narrow area of the
rear bucket seat.  Good luck!

Yes, I have added my oil temp sender gauge there.  The panel I have is
not terribly pretty.  I am told that auto stereo places have textured
black plastic panel material, generic in a size which you would cut
to fit, and it ought to look pretty nice.

The standard VDO gauge size is 52 mm, which will just fit in the
height of that cubby spot.  I recommend picking up a 2" hole saw,
using it then opening up the hole a little with a round file to
fit the gauge.

Dear Tim,

The problem is obvious. The flywheel 0 ring needs to be installed inside the
back of the flywheel, not between the shims and the flywheel!

In fact, the old 0 ring is still probably in your flywheel. I am sure this is
what is "locking down" your engine. 

Make sure crankshaft endplay is .07 - .15mm only and set with 3 shims.
Excessive play will damage the case and not enough will tighten the engine!

Good luck!

Subject: 911 comfort on LONG trips

Hi all,

I've driven my '72 911S autocross car from Connecticut to Kansas, 30 hours
each way, 4 times, from '85 to '88. This is 12,000 miles in 16 days. It has
stock suspension/engine but Bilstein Sport shocks and performance tires. I
drove with 4 spare tires/rims in the car, tools, floor jack, and stuff for a
week of serious competition. Also took the wife once (she will never go
again, she had no sense of humor when the heat exchangers caught fire in
Saint Louis.) And of course no serious competition car has air conditioning.
The front vent windows are great for cooling, but make too much noise which
is fatiguing.

We usually cruised at about 70 MPH. After about 8 hours, the next 8 hours or
so are no different-you get into a groove and there is no further pain. You
settle low into the 911 as if in a capsule. I use the hand throttle which is
designed for cold-running high idle as a cruise control. Once up to speed, I
can run 80MPH with the "choke!".

I have learned that it helps to take aspirin before a 2 hour or longer drive,
lessens the noise buzz-hangover. I also learned that my Targa top comes loose
at about 130MPH...

I also drove an '86 911 Cabriolet for several hours and it was much better on
the highway.

So I guess I cannot say that my 911 is comfortable on long trips. But it was
a great experience that I fondly remember when I am in my quiet, air
conditioned, 4 speaker stereo, comfortable Jeep Grand Cherokee V-8 towing my
911.

I've had similar trips many times, although, not 30 hours one way...my 
"long" trips are usually 12 -13 hours. These trips have been in old and new 
911's, and a 914.  All of them great trips except for the one where my fuel 
injection system died in nowhere North Carolina, with snow coming down, 
spending the night in some very nice people's farm house waiting for help to 
arrive...well, *now* it doesn't seem that bad.

>So I guess I cannot say that my 911 is comfortable on long trips.
For the 12-13 hour trips I was still comfortable...I don't know how I would 
feel after 30, if I could feel at all!!!

I second that thought!  But I do miss the engine and its sounds and the

Subject: 944 Motor Mounts

P-philes,

I have just becomed the proud owner of my first Porsche. It is a pristine 
guards red 1986 944 with the factory optional sway bars, 55,000 miles young. 
The mechanic that inspected it gave a clean bill of health. The mechanic 
does recommend that the motor mounts be replaced. There is a little 
vibration in reverse gear and when the car revs down coming to a stop. I 
would like to start driver's education as soon as possible (there is an 
event in the San Diego area on 12/10). Would it be safe for the occupants 
(novice driver & instructor) and the car to drive in an auto-X/time trial 
event? Once the mounts start to deteriorate, do they fail catastrophically, 
or they just continue to get worse until the vibration is unbearable? 

On a different subject, the reception (FM/AM) of the radio is very 
inadequate (it sucks). The car is equipped with the factory Blaupunkt 
Monterrey/windshield antenna. Is there an antenna booster or similar device 
available for this application?

Thanks,

Guys,
  Has anyone come up with a non-messy way to add oil to your 
911 when you aren't at home ?  
I generally check my oil whenever I get gas but wait till I get 
home (2 miles away) to add oil using a funnel with a tube attached.  
I tried a one of those filler necks that screw onto the oil bottle.  
It didn't work that well - squeeze, glug, squeeze, glug,..
Something like a big syringe with a cap would be just the ticket.

It could be excesive preasure build up in the tank.  Most gas stations now have 
new pump nozels which automaticaly shut off when they sense the preasure 
building up.  I can only guess that this is some way to tell if the tank is 
NEARLY full to avoid spilage.  I have also seen signs at these stations warning 
not to top off your tank for the same reason.  One thing you may want to try is 
to hold the nozel out about an inch from its fully inserted "at rest" position.  
It could also be an issue with the fuel being pumped in too quickly for the 
internal preasure to be released which will also trip the nozel. ?????  
Fuel for thought.

This works really well on 911's and Jeep Grand Cherokee's (aka Convoy 
Commander :-))...  Cut the top 1/4 (depends on how big you want the funnel 
to be) off of a two liter soda bottle, save the cap -  you have a quick, 
emergency funnel.  Actually, I use this all of the time on the Jeep and I 
put a rag in the "mouth" and screw the cap back on so leftover oil doesn't 
get all over everything.  It is also very flexible so you can put it in some 
tight places like the 911.  I've seen this "funnel" quite a bit...just my 
.02!

Gee, I don't have any problem with my '72 - I just open the passenger door
a few inches, push the button to open the flap, unscrew the cap,
pour in the desired amount of oil, close the cap, close the flap,
close the door, and I'm on my way.  I even have one of the gas flap
rubber pieces for my oil filler.

Oooops!  You guys with non-'72's (and non-959's, I believe) can't do
it this way.  You gotta climb into the engine comparment!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!

Hi,

I recently paid 535$ Cdn (400 $US) to get the steering rack 
removed/ change seals/ reinstalled.
I remember shopping for just the rack in the US 
and the best price I could get was 500$US with the condition
of giving my old rack in exchange.
It seems that it is one of the rare cases where things are 
cheaper in Canada compared to the US. 

From my experience, more than 700$US given the fact that you 
are giving back your old rack is organized robbery.

Winter time use of oxgenated gasoline (along with yearly emissions
testing) has also been required for the past several years in the
Minneapolis/St. Paul area.

The local pollution control agency has recently been touting the
effectiveness of the oxygenated gasoline program, in that air quality
has improved x percent over the past several years.  However, the
state DOT is claiming that the emissions testing program is
responsible for the increase in air quality.

Yet a third group (using the same test results and the DOT's automobile
registration data) claims that there is a greater correlation between
the increased air quality and the decreasing number of registered older

Subject: Oxygenated Fuels

All of this talk on oxygenated fuels leads me to a question for those
of you in Colorado. My 1994 Ford Ranger is running like crap on the 
alcohol blended fuels. Are any of you experincing this problem? Also 
in past years there have been blends with MTBE available. I have not been
able to find an MTBE Blend this year. Do any of you know where MTBE 
can be found. I understand that it has a higher energy content and 
will avoid some of the problems with Alcohol and will increase my 
MPG wich is down about 20%.

Subject: CIS FI pump

I'm bench-assembling a 77 CIS system preparatory to putting it on an engine
that is running Zeniths temporarily, in my Vanagon.  The fuel pump hums but
doesn't pump.  (I know, Stan, it's used.)  So my options are ANOTHER used
Bosch pump ($85), or new pumps by Hella, Purolator, or Peerborg (~$130).  Or
maybe when I go home tonight the penetrating oil that's been in my dead pump
for 24 hours will have freed it up.  Assuming that dead stays dead, which do
I want more, Bosch or new?  If new, any recommendations among the three brands
given?  Your insights appreciated.

I can attest to the 20 gallon + capacity. On my car, it typically requires
about 18 gallons to fill up once the warning light has come on.

One candidate for the problem is that your fuel gauge is wildly mis-reading.
That is , telling you it's empty when it's really half full. About the
only other possibility is that the tank capacity is reduced by about
one and a half cubic feet, which seems unlikely. I guess I would be
tempted to try siphoning gas out when the gauge indicates empty - if you
can get another 10 gallons out, the sender is probably at fault.

Here is another possible explanation:

Recent I saw on the news of a similar case, where a lady had a car that 
wouldn't hardly take any gas.

She took it down to the dealer, and they ended up replacing the gas tank.
Guy goes to throw the tank away, and sez:  "Gee, thats kinda heavy!" so
they rip the tank apart and find it full of marijuana!!

Might be worth it to poke a flashlight down there - you might have enough
to buy a real Porsche (Deliberate, tounge in cheek flame bait!)

Grayson,

This is a little to simplistic don't you think? Burning a quart of oil
every 3000 miles is not that uncommon. Also, many people don't change their
oil every 3000 miles anyway. Synthetic users may wait 10000 miles.

Well, I did it.  As if 2 projects were not enough, I have added 
another one.  I closed the deal on that 64 356SC that I asked all of 
you to help evalutate.  Part of my decision to buy the car (besides 
the emotion of owning the car itself) is really the people -- all the 
great messages I rec'd from people on the list, members of PCA San 
Diego that I've met through interaction with the BMW CCA, and a few 
special people I wanted to thank publicly here (hope you don't mind).  
First of all The Maestro with all the info. - hope I get to meet you 
soon.  Pete Albrecht with the time, inspection and tune of the car to 
help me decide.  It was Pete's time, attention, and contact with Steve 
Schmidt (of Honest Engine) that pushed me over the edge for this 
particular car.  And of course, Steve of Honest Engine, who isn't on 
this list, but called me last night and spent 2 hours talking cars & 
walking me through an engine inspection.

I drove it back to work & couldn't be more excited.  Those in PCA San

I hate to admit it, but my car does the same thing.  In fact, there
is one left turn on the way home from work where I can count on the
engine cutting out.  My car will even do this slightly when changing
lanes on the interstate!!  Just like above it only occurs at part
throttle - full throttle or on the track, it's fine.   

Some sort of fuel starvation thing seems logical, but my CIS
is in pretty good shape right now and I can't fathom a loss of 
fuel pressure that quickly.  I'm all ears if someone has any
suggestions.

Seems like this anomaly would be next to impossible to diagnose
due to the specialized circumstances in which it occurs.  Maybe
run a pressure gauge measuring system pressure into the car and
drive around taking left turns and watching the pressure?  I don't
think so...

Any suggestions?

Subject: Re: Intercooling the 931.

Hi.
Thanks to everyone for the replies on the Intercooler issue.  It seems a bit
more complicated than I had anticipated though.  I recon that Rick's plan to
install an intercooler in the right front (displacing the water reservoir
and the oil cooler) sounds promising.  
I was shocked to notice the difference between the 1980 924T and the 1981/82
Turbo's.  Porsche really went all out and changed the transaxle, compression
ratio, engine management (by adding DITC).  Even the intake manifold and
throttle body was changed (not to mention an entirely different turbocharger). 
Any theories as to why Porsche made such radical changes only 12 months into
the 931's production run (...is my 1980 THAT bad?)?  Anyway, I am on the
lookout for a wrecked (low mile) 1982 as a donor car so that I can upgrade
to the later spec. (when my present engine is worn out that is).  I think
the 1982 car has a beter ventilation/AC system as well.


>Why is it you consider an air/fuel guage important on a turbocharged
>car?  I'm not techie enough to care.

I installed my air/fuel ratio guage after I installed the "dial-a-boost"
kit.  I increased the boost from the stock level of 8Psi to anywhere from 10
to 12 Psi.  I became concerned that the stock fuel injection could not cope
with the demands of such (relatively) high boost levels and was running lean
as a result.  This lean condition is very undesirable since the engine will
overheat and pre-ignition (pinging) will occur (made worse by the lack of an
intercooler).  I was a little dubious of installing a ($30) Cyberdyne (LED)
guage amidst the 931's VDO guages, but it looks quite nice and seems VERY
accurate.  The hookup is easy, just switched positive, a GOOD ground and a
hookup to the oxygen sensor wire.  Now, when I crank the boost up, in the
corner of my eye I can see that the mixture is full rich at full throttle at
about 12Psi( and the car really HAULS at this boost level).

I suppose that the engines longevity will be adversely affected by this, but
I only increase the boost occasionally, and I do have that 1982 engine to
look forward to...

December 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Car-wise, things are on an even keel. Only excitment was getting to take
the doors completely apart on my 356 twice last month. And getting
ready for two races I didn't get to drive in, due to breaking some bones
in my right hand playing golf (and yes, it was on one of those 310-yard
"bone crushing" drives... 8{( ). I'm better now, but still have intermittent
problems with gripping and twisting motions.

List membership is at a propitious 962, with the split between digest and 
message-at-a-time still right at 50-50. Growth continues, as we're up about 
almost 100 from last month. Wow.

The new much-smarter mail software is a big win, and an even smarter
DNS system with an unrestricted size cache further sped up message delivery 
time.  A new statistics package I wrote says that tta.com has averaged
just under 38,000 mail messages a day during November. That's a lot.

The digest still has one bug, a race condition that is hard to tickle.
I keep thinking I have it fixed, but it keeps popping up in some new
way. I'll eventualy get it... So if you get "doubled" digests, don't
worry about it in the meantime...

More new software is in the works -- one of my staff is playing with
an FTPmail package that would let you send mail to a server and get
specific files returned to you. This will let those of you on services
which do not yet support FTP to access the archives and images library.
Should see deployment before the end of the year.

idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 if you have to.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop

Subject: RE FW 944 fog lamps(guage question)

In response to adding guages...

I hate to write in since I'm not an owner, and I'm not even sure what guages
come standard in the various models.

But I will, because I did add an oil press, volt, oil temp guage to my 88 VW
Jetta. It was a fun project. Took VDO guages out of an Audi, bought sending
units from a import parts store, wired it all myself. Blank plate got from
dealer to mount guages on. Good luck

Subject: 914 related.  For sale or trade pressure sensor 0280 100 100.


  Thanks to those who responded to my query on this sensor.

Ok, it is time for me to backup my used parts with more used parts.
I have exactly one sensor for my 914.
This application is for a '73 914 with 2.0 4.  The correct sensor
part number is; 0 280 100 037
Anyone know if these are interchangeable with other year's sensors?
That part number is 0 280 100 043 and applies to '74 to '76  2.0's.

  The sensor I have offered is for a Mercedes 4.5L v8 and is NOS minus
the box.  It wont break my heart if no one wants it . . . I will take it 
apart for
the educational worth.  Betcha it can be reprogrammed for a 914.
 Dunno what it is worth in cash.  One kind soul said $190.
That's kinda steep IMHO, but for a Mercedes maybe not.

  What I did was swap my 914 from weber 40IDF's to oem FI.
 -The parts had been in a box over 10 years and traveled the
US during 4 interstate moves.  I got tired of my rebuilt carbs flooding
my engine with raw fuel, so off they came.  I put the fi parts back on and
once I got the hardware timing correct the car started on the first hit!
  Only thing left to do was get the vacuum plumbing correct, and now
we are back to trial runs in time for sub-freezing weather.
  In retrospect, I miss the 'punch' and roar of carbs, but I sure like the
start and idle fuel injection gives without pumping the thottle in cold
temps.  All that's left now is trial runs and smoothing the response
thru minor adjustments.

  I am debating selling my 40 IDF setup complete with crossbar
linkage, manifolds, K&N filters, Facet pump and 009 distributor.  The rig
has no more than 30000 miles on it and the carbs have a rebuld kit with
 less than 2k miles.  Anyone got an idea what they's worth these days?
 I think I paid $650 for the whole shootin' match.

Hi Scott:

Have you stopped beating your wife? Glad to see that you've been 
released again. Hope you can stay clean this time. We're all pulling

I understand that your cars need quite a lot of oil between changes,
but usually it's a sign of excessive wear or some sort of mechanical
problem. Adding oil instead of correcting the problem is like taking
demerol for a broken arm. It temporarily stops the pain, but you
still have a broken arm.

I don't know who made the comment but that is correct. The reason it should
not be used on rubber is it dissolves the chemicals which resist oxidation
and attack by ozone from the surface. This will lead to premature aging
which might result in cracking of the surface.

Actually, I've heard bad things in general for Armorall... that with
prolonged use, it will eat up/crack your dash, etc.  Don't know if it's
true, but when I had some seats redone on my Supra ( who did excellent
work, btw), I asked him what he used.  Said he preferred this stuff from
Turtle Wax called "Clear Magic" or something like that.  Been using it ever
since, but it really hasn't been long enough to say whether or not it too
hasn't caused damage.

Subject: Info on 912E,Owners?Parts?Recommendations?

I recently picked up one of those Porsche "buff books" and read with 
interest about a car called the 912E, made in 1976 only. I looks like a 
normal '76 911, but Porsche put a leftover 2.0 engine from the 914 in it. 
Are these cars any good? Do they have the same transmission as the 914 or 
is it the 911's? It sounds like a good deal to me, to have a 911 without 
the $10,000 engine rebuilds that have scared me away from them so far. 
How much would a 912E rebuild run? As far as I can tell it should be 
perfect for me, but would its rarity (how many were built?) drive the 
price for a decent one out of the $10,000 range? I'd like to get some 
information about the 912E from either owners or someone who knows about 
them, any info would be helpful.  Mail to jkarolyi@southern.edu. 
Thanks!

> Are these cars any good? 

Yes. And No. They're not as well balanced as the "real" 912s from '65-69,
but are still OK. The 2.0 only makes less power than the 914 2.0, in a 
chassis that's 700 lbs heavier then the 914. So it's not a rocketship.
On the other hand, it's a nice car, and can be a lot of fun to drive if
you don't expect 911ish performance.

The problem is, many 912E owners *DID* expect 911ish performance, and
lots of them have been thrashed hard as a result. Not having the performance,
they also don't have the value....

> How much would a 912E rebuild run? 

It depends. If you don't need any of the one-year-only parts, it's just 
like a 914. Elmer Fohey gets $1100 for a rebuild, plus parts and outside
machine work, so it can be $2500-6000, depending on what you need. If you
want more performance, that is, of course, extra. 

> As far as I can tell it should be 
> perfect for me, but would its rarity (how many were built?) drive the

Rarity makes it hard to find, but the prices I've seen have been well
under $10k except for concours cars. *HOWEVER* you didn't ask the real
question -- what's it cost to keep it running?

All of the body/suspension/brakes/electricals are 911, so you pay 911
prices for that stuff. There's no cost savings versus a 911 for the main
body. The engine, well, that's 914ish so isn't as expensive to do 
the routine maintence. Then you have the "glue" -- the stuff that holds
a 914 engine in a 911 body and makes it work: the EFI, the engine wiring
harness, the tach, etc. All that stuff is *ONE YEAR ONLY* and for one
specific model that they didn't make many of, and a relatively unpopular
model at that... So finding those parts is next to impossible. The good
news is that most of them have a 20 year service life or so, the bad news
is guess how long it's been since they were made...

I'd prefer a real 912 or a real 911. Except I keep having this nagging
feeling that if I combined what I know about 911 racing chassis setup and 
914 racing engines and combined that to take a 912E into SCCA E Production 
racing...

Subject: Perlux Ignitor for 912's

Just though I'd put in my $.02 about the Perlux Ignitor. I purchased one a
while ago and it is by far the best $80 I have spent on my 69 912. I think you
can get one now for about $50. For those who don't know, the ignitor replaces
the points and condenser in the distributor and converts it to a much more 
efficient electronic ignition. I first put the ignitor into an 031, and what 
a difference! I then replaced the 031 with an 009, no problems, bolts right 
in. Now I have put in an 050 and had to modify the rotor to make the ignitor 
fit. Basically, I had to trim the rotor flange off and check the clearance
with respect to the top of the ignitor module.
The wiring is simple and I did have a problem with the magnetic sleeve
that goes under the rotor, but the people at Perlux were more than helpful to 
get it replaced/repaired.
All in all, if you have a 912 this is one modification I would recommend.
No more points to fool with. Set the timming and forget it. (almost)
I think the model number of the unit I used was #1847(I don't have the stuff
in front of me right now but...) You can contact Perlux direct. they are in 
southern CA.

Subject: Long Distance 911s


Hi all,

Back in the 1970s, I drove my 911s cross-country a number of times to the 
Washington DC area. I usually did it in three days. Never had a problem, no 
tickets, though I met the infamous Baltimore County cop, Bob Speed. I 
think my longest leg was one where I left Washington DC at 8:30 am and got
to  Davenport, Iowa at 9:30 pm. (I know the distance, I spent an hour for 
dinner in Champaign, Illinois. Figure out my average.) My mileage in my 911S
was 21mpg, the 911T 23mpg. Both were '73s with mechanical injection.

I never did figure out how to add oil on the road except by stopping. Both 
cars had sport seats, which helped a bunch. The one thing that did occur was that I lost a windshield in Pennsylvania to a *very* large chunk of coal.
I still have the chunk of coal. I never used a radar detector, the one time 
I did, I was a lot slower. 

When I bought my 924 in '77, I took it east on one of these trips. It was a
revelation! Much more comfortable, though not with the power. I put the 911S
away and sold the 911T, a new era had started.

Subject: Possible Porsche Purchase from California


I am considering purchasing a 1976 914 2.0 from a shop in California with 
a good reputation in the 914 world of racing and repair (IMHO) - 
with only having seen pictures of the car!  Tell me that I am crazy.  
I would like to give a short discription about the car and have all of 
you tell me that I should not spend the money - or otherwise.  Here is a 
breakdown of the info that I have so far.
	
	- No rust, " California" car: what is the difference between that 
          and the "Washington" car that I have stored in my parents garage?

	- original Malaga red paint/black interior: both in excellent 
	  condition.

	- 145,000 miles: sounds high to me with a rebuild

	- new mechanics installed by the shop:
		
		new Bosch starter motor
		new 911 master cylinder
		brake pad X4
		rotors turned
		stainless steel brake lines
		new shocks and springs: Bilstein rear/KYB front
		new 911 tie rod ends
		new igition+wires+cap/rotor+condensor+points
		Vitton pushrod tube seals
		rear engine galley plugs?
		clutch cable
		shifter bushing
		new (911S) clutch
		resurface flywheel+Vitton FW seals+mainshaft
		new oil cooler+seals
		tuned up and aligned

	- other new items:
	
		4 Yokohama HR radials
		2 New speakers in their OE positions
		new Porsche floormats
		new door and top rubber
		new hardtop storage brackets front/rear
		new owners manual
		Momo steering wheel+hub+shift knob

I have the VIN number as well but not the engine #.  Photos are in the 
mail.  I have asked them a few questions to which they responded, but 
what sort of hard questions should I ask (this is the first 914 that I 
have looked to BUY)?  What concerns should I have besides the high 
mileage?  Any assistance would be appreciated.

Grayson,

I do not understand why you you responded the way you did as far as the
personal attack is concerned. Maybe you are having a bad hair day....

Anyway, all internal combustion engines (4-stroke) burn some oil during the
combustion process. As Bruce Anderson pointed out to me, Porsche now
recommends a 15,000 mile interval for oil changes on the new cars. It seems
reasonable, that an engine may need to have a quart or so of oil added to
it every once in a while. This does not necessarily indicate their is a
problem with the engine. Unless of course the engine is burning a quart of
oil every 1000 miles.

Also, when engines are used at sustained high RPMs, more oil is burned.

All was trying to do is point out that burning a quart of oil every 3000
miles does not mean the engine need to be rebuilt and that was the message
you were giving.

Please keep the personal attacks to yourself.....I don't want to see them
and I don't believe the other folks on the list want to either.

I know you all will correct me if I'm wrong, but...it is not unusual for the 
older 911's to go through a quart(+/-) of oil in 1500 miles or so, right?? 
 I thought I remembered reading this in the manual for my 71 T, and 
experiencing it while I had it.

Porsche proposed this engine/generator set idea for the Tiger I under Porsche
project type 101. Despite the German military's historical predelection for
buying the most complicated, difficult to produce toys in the world, somebody
was bright enough to see that this thing would take years to develop and they
needed tanks NOW. So Porsche's system was rejected in favor of Henschel's.
Porsche had proposed two transmission variatons, one electric, one hydraulic.
Like the rest of the drive, the air cooled engines weren't ready to go either.
 
The Porsche Type 100 tank destroyer was based on the Tiger chassis. Ninety
of these were shipped off and rebuilt with different hulls. The two Porsche
designed air cooled V 10 gasoline engines were replaced by two standard Maybach
water-cooled gasoline engines, but retained the electric drives and steering.
This thing was originally nicknamed the "Ferdinand," later officially called
"Elefant." Only the original ninety of these were built, and one reference*
says "These vehicles proved to be more of a liability rather than an asset
to the units receiving them." The 88 mm gun could hit effectively at three
miles or more, but the tanks themselves were maintenance hogs and consumed
hard-to-get parts. Sounds like that's where they got the idea for the 928
<g>.
 
These things had chrome-moly hulls and torsion bar suspension, so like all
Porsche production vehicles they could easily be converted to race cars <g>.
 
One of these is preserved at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, I think.
 
Other Porsche type numbers -- Type 102, Tiger with hydraulic drives.
Type 103 -- Same as 102 but with two engine blowers to cool transmission.
"Tests were also conducted to investigate the feasibility of using half a
Volkswagen engine as a starting motor for air-cooled tank engines."
Type 180 -- gasoline electric drive proposal for Tiger II.
Type 181 -- gasoline hydraulic drive proposal for Tiger II. (And you thought
it was a VW "Thing.")
 
Type 205 -- the "Maus," biggest tank ever made, 187 tons.
 
Type 212 -- New tank engine design, just in time for the outbreak of peace.
Sixteen cylinders in X layout (like two narrow V8s on their side, sharing a
crankshaft), 37 liters, 700 horsepower
 
So when somebody asks Porsche what they did during the war...
 
>I have a real yearning to turn up

I understand there is some guy in Nevada who has a licence do drive an M4
Sherman tank on the road. OK, how about some REAL competitve driving for a
change -- M4 Sherman vs. Porsche Type 100 "Ferdinand." 'Our' long 88 against

When they passes aren't closed by snow, the old St. Gothard pass is
incredible, and nearly deserted because Europeans are all in a hurry to go
through the tunnel. Some Freudian problem, I guess. Other good passes are
the four forming a square near Andermatt, just N of the St. Gothard --
Susten, Grimsel, Furka, Oberalp. When I first got my '81 SC, it was a simple

In the same vein, there was a prewar Fiat Topolino drag car (well, it wasn't

This is more important than it may sound.  We get a lot less rain here (at
least in So. Cal.) and the dry climate means a lot less rust.  We also
don't have to worry about salted roads like people in colder climates do. 
914's are prone to rust in the engine compartment (esp. the battery
tray) and also in the rear trunk.  Rust repairs are no fun.  From my
experience, if you can find rust in one location, you're likely to find it
elsewhere.

That's actually below average mileage for that car.  How many miles ago

My only advice to you on buying long distance is to get a sense of the
character of who your buying from.  If its a shop get references. If its
a private party, was the car just transportation or is the person in love
with the car like you'll be?  Good luck.

I've seen Groits sells a "valve" that screws on the oil bottle which allows 
you to get the bottle in position without spilling any oil.  It's looks to 
about an inch high.  There is a collar around it you pull  to open the valve 
which makes it easy to stop the flow should only a partial bottle be needed. 
 Small and compact , which probably matters in a 911 as much as a in a 928. 


I believe it's about  $6 if I remember correctly, but verify that first.  I 
don't have their catalog here at work, but perhaps someone else here can 
provide it if you don't have it.  I never added oil to a 911 or seen it

Never mind the formula, it only gives inexact results. You can get exact
results by the following means:

Graph the torque transmitted to the drive wheels over the RPM range
for each gear, all on the same graph. Starting with the first gear
curve, trace along it until it either drops below the second gear
curve or it reaches redline. That's the point at which you should shift
to second. Then trace along the second gear curve until it either
drops below the third gear curve or reaches redline. That's the two-three
shift point. And so on.

Naturally, the best way to get the torque curves is from a chassis dyno,
with the engine speed increasing at approximately the same rate it
increases at on the road (which takes the rotational inertia of the
drivetrain into account). Failing that, you can get a reasonable
approximation by taking the engine torque output curve (which is
most likely in your owner's manual, otherwise it's probably in the
relevant review articles regarding your car) and, for each gear,
multiplying the indicated torque by the effective gear ratio (including
final drive). Then plot the torque curves as above and read off the
shift points.

Subject: Re: Escort mounted in-dash?

I "remoted it". the front panel is in the dash and the "guts" are mounted
behind the front bumper (plastic). Its just a matter of disassembly and
extending the wires from the main board to the controls on the front panel.
There used to a place that would do it for you (for $$), but I heard they
did the same thing, maybe with capacitors to ground to prevent noise
buildup. The loss in range (if any) would be due to lowering the height of
the receiver and any attenuation from the plastic bumper cover (who knows).
Seems to work ok. the only problem was resealing the unit so water doesn't
get in. I used plastic sheet and RTV. BIG mistake. The RTV has vinigar in
it and corroded the board as it dried. The quartz crystal is VERY
sensitive, and I had to return mine (all disassembled) to the factory to
get it fixed: a $20 lesson.

The reason to remote it was as much to avoid getting it stolen as anything
else. I'd heard of people getting their cars broken into even if only
suction cup marks or cable were visible. A friend of mine installed a
magnet arrangement on his headliner to both supply power and hold the unit
physically.
The only speed trap that ever caught me was BEFORE I remoted the thing and
got stopped with it in the glovebox. Imagine my embarassment at getting a
ticket for 45 mph in a porsche!

Grayson,

Really, it's okay to change the oil as infrequently as every 3000-4000 
miles.

[The factory spec for unacceptable oil consumption is 1.5 liter/1000km,
tho' I admit that I would consider that a bit extreme...]

Anyway, lighten up.  Lots of the older cars use a quart every 1000 miles
or so and keep doing so for years.  Oil is *a lot* cheaper than engines.

As far as adding oil goes, what's the problem?  Add it a quart at a time
and there shouldn't be any mess.

By the way, when the spout of the oil bottle is offset to one side, the 
correct thing to do hold the bottle so that the spout is on the top when 
you start pouring, not the bottom.  This way the air can escape and the 
oil does not go "glump-glump-glump" all over the engine compartment.

Due to the restricted space I usually wind up holding the bottle almost 
sideways with the spout elevated slightly.

kiss and the idle hunts slightly and seems to forget its setting.
ie:after acceleration it might idle a 1200 or 1000 or 800 RPM.  Dwell is

look super.  How to procede?  

Another [unrelated?]  problem is I cant get the cold start system to

Hi all,

Back in the 1970s, I drove my 911s cross-country a number of times to the 
Washington DC area. I usually did it in three days. Never had a problem, no 
tickets, though I met the infamous Baltimore County cop, Bob Speed. I 
think my longest leg was one where I left Washington DC at 8:30 am and got
to  Davenport, Iowa at 9:30 pm. (I know the distance, I spent an hour for 
dinner in Champaign, Illinois. Figure out my average.) My mileage in my 911S
was 21mpg, the 911T 23mpg. Both were '73s with mechanical injection.

I never did figure out how to add oil on the road except by stopping. Both 
cars had sport seats, which helped a bunch. The one thing that did occur was 
that
 I lost a windshield in Pennsylvania to a *very* large chunk of coal.
I still have the chunk of coal. I never used a radar detector, the one time 
I did, I was a lot slower. 

When I bought my 924 in '77, I took it east on one of these trips. It was a
revelation! Much more comfortable, though not with the power. I put the 911S
away and sold the 911T, a new era had started.

It would have been maximum torque, not horsepower.

Yes, it's for when you don't have the torque curve.  What their formula gives
you results in starting each gear (after first, of course) at maximum torque.
If I remember correctly, you take the ratio of the gear ratios and multiply
by the max torque rpm.  This gives you the rpm to shift at.  If it's above
redline, shift at or near redline.  Your engine will thank you :-)  (And if
it's below the max torque rpm, invert the ratio of ratios and try again).

Naturally, this doesn't take into account the shape of the torque curve,
which is its big flaw.

Quite so.  But next time you want to get the old Yugo up to speed asap, the
above approximation isn't too bad :-)

Interesting idea, Herr Listmeister. Because I know what it feels like to have
a John Mehelich or Don Overby drive away from a 356 powered EP car in their
914's, this sounds good. Do you think SCCA would keep the minimum weight low

Yes. I forget the numbers, but it's competitive. Something like 2400 lbs
plus driver. A 914 EP engine makes about 185-190 HP, so I figure that's
no problem to do in a 912E. I can make a 911 chassis "driveable" cheaper
than an EP 914 chassis (any idea what's involved in making a repeatable,
easy to adjust rear toe gizmo for a 914? or how hard it is to get reasonable
brakes given that you can't use vented rotors?)

There is at least one that's winning national races, so I figure it's 
really doable. Now, if you won the Runoffs, they'd surely change something
because we can't have Porsche having an unfair advantage in the SCCA
now can we...

Here's a problem I've been trying to tackle lately:

My '79 911 SC (US) has a problem starting after it sits for a week or two.
The motor turns over fine, but acts like it doesn't have any fire.
After multiple tries (roughly 10) it starts firing on one or two
cylinders, then slowly catchs on two more cylinders and so on.  Sometimes,
it will just run on 4 cylinders until I hit the top of #5 and #6
fuel injectors.  Once all cylinders are running, it still seems to
be off song slightly.

Engine conditon:

   - 110,000 miles
   - good compression
   - new ignition wires, distributor cap, rotor, plugs, air filter and
     altenator
   - valve adjustment OK
   - timing OK

Possible causes and solutions?

   - #5 & #6 injectors move slightly in intake manifold - bad injector seals
   - clogged injectors - replace injectors
   - clogged fuel filter - replace fuel filter
   - fuel pump
   - fuel system check valves
   - fuel distributor
   - ?

Any input would be appreciated.

A Carrera Targa with a little longer 5th and a little tuning (around 250hp) 
like mine (non-turbolook) can do 162mph on a long straight (we tried 
measuring it in Germany) - but the noise is awful in a targa at that speed!

That can't have been fun. The last time I got passed by a bike at 150mph
it looked horrible with the bike flexing quite a lot (bad adjustment?)!

I wouldn't want to do it...

But you wouldn't drive a car at 250km/h comfortably either before you had 
thousand of kilometres experience/practice, would you??

The Honda VFR 1000R is the closest one gets to a real race bike, I 
occasionally drove flat out with it.
 
*Very* stable at high speeds, not like the VF1000F for instance,...which is 
a real 'shake' at high speeds.

Fun is maybe not the right word, 'Adrenalin pumping' is more to it! I don't 
think it's fun driving a car at high speed either, great for cookin' 
adrenalin, but not fun...

I just experienced quite similar symptoms on my car, it turned out to be a
bad connection in the coil-to-distributor spark cable. Apparently enough
moisture had gotten in that when it froze, there wasn't enough spark.

From: cohen@ATB.teradyne.com (steve cohen)
Subject: Re: re; oil consumption in 911

I have never worried about being a quart or so low.  What I worry about
is oil temp.  The oil is the coolant and the less oil in the system
the less time each blob of oil has to lose heat to the air.  The other
problem with being more than a quart or so low is that the oil level
gauge doesn't give you any useful info.

There is a spec. on oil consumption.  For my '77 targa the spec was a
quart per 600 mi.  I have read that the big problem with excessive oil
comsumption is that it can indicate excessive clearance in the valve
guides.  This is what finally killed my 2.7.

My take on the sacred cow of oil change is this:  Oil gets dirty and it
also wears out.  The wear out I'm most concerned about is the loss of
the scarificial additives that the oil vendors put in to keep your
engine clean and to buffer the acidity of the oil.

My regimin has been to change the filter every 3K miles to keep the
dirt out and every 6K miles to replace the additives.  The 3K miles oil
change number has been around a long time and may apply to engines that
use 4 or so quarts of oil.  Fron the point of view of the additives
wearing out.  I dont think they wear out any quicker in a 911 than they
do in a Chevette.  6k miles seem quiet reasonable.

I change in the fall to 5W40 and in the spring to 20W50.

 -Steve

p.s. my 2.7 went 185,000 miles before it died of valve ingestion.

Subject: Moving and Porsches


Text item: Text_1

     Hello philes,
     
     I am moving, and am trying to find the best way to move my Porsches.  I am 
     planning on renting a Uhaul for my furniture, so I won't be able to drive 
     the Porsches.  I don't mind pulling the 944 behind the Uhaul (as long as I 
     am not towing the 944 on it's own wheels), but I don't have a way of moving 
     my 930.  
     
     Ideally, I could drive the 930 into the Uhaul (if I get a big one).   But I 
     don't know how much weight the Uhaul can handle, or if the Uhaul people 
     would freak out if I tried.  Has anyone tried this?
     
     Are there other ways of doing this?  I seem to remember a moving company 
     advertising in some car magazine about their covered trailers and good 
     care.  Anyone have experience with one of these companies?
     
     Has anyone moved across state boundaries (or know someone who has) and has 
     successfully moved their Porsches with no damage?  If so, how was it done?
     
     Thanks,

Great setup.  My brother HAD an original escort also and yes, it was stolen 
with a bunch of tapes and other stuff.  He figures the wire he left plugged 
in his dash gave it away.

Never knew RTV ate away at electronic hardware, I'll have to remember that, 
I'm sure I'll run across similar situation someday with all the electronics 
in newer cars.  The $20 service charge seems very reasonable considering 
labor costs.  The local electronic places around me charge $45 just to look 
at it and tell you what's wrong.  Then you pay whatever to fix it plus the 
$45 fee.

Loose?  What does loose mean?  To the point of actually comming off?
I have not had problems with mine at 145+MPH, I was more concerned with
the feel of the car on the road at that speed.   I do not regularly
speed, and have only had the car to extreme speed twice, to see how fast it
would go.  One of thoose times, the top was off.  I was told after that
that the car would probably go faster with the targa top on, to cut down
the significant wind resistance.  At 145, there were still another 600 or
so RPMs to 6.5K (redline), and I only had it there for 6-10 seconds of so.  
But at 193 feet per second, that was as fast as I needed to find out about the 
car.  I do not advocate speeding (my disclaimer).

putting the car inside the truck is often what the poor unfortunates do

depending on the truck, a flat bed truck may be required to get the bed

This is exactly what my '81 911 did when it got it's first tank
of oxygenated fuel this year.  A friend of mine is a manager at
that gas station and said they started getting oxygenated fuel
early this year.  He also told me the local areas to go which
don't have oxygenated fuel.  The car is running fine again on the
second tankful with occasional, brief stumbles in the power.

          I have found a solution to making long distance 70+ mph
          travel more comfortable.  Foam earplugs, the same as I use
          in track events.  They knock out the annoying frequencies
          and you  turn the radio up high enough so that you
          can hear it, but not the engine noise.  So...you lose a
          little fidelity, no big deal.

          These are available in any pharmacy very inexpensively in
          the 25-30db reduction range.

          This worked great on my 914-6 2.7 when I took it on the
          road.

          Jim

== Or even better yet; wire in a headphone jack and use a pair of those 
padded earcup (sealed) headphones . . . no loss of fidelity at xxxdb power 
levels.  Hazards to this are;  you cannot listen to your machine to detect a 
developing problem, and traffic noise like approaching emergency vehicles 
(siren, siren! I didnt hear no steenking siren).

== I did this on a 914.  When properly wired into the audio system -the 
speakers are shut off (which requires some load resistance to maintian 
proper energy tranfer and protect your electronics).

== I suggest this for use on highway travel only -not urban commuting.
== Watch your gauges, mirrors.

Subject: my new 911

I am about to purchase an 82 911.  I understood my previous car ('77
911) pretty well but I dont know beans about this one.

Specifically, the engine warm up cycle seems to last about 10 minutes
whereas my '77s warmup cycle lasted about half of that or less.  The
high idle does drop somewhat after about 2 minutes but only a few
hundred rpm (from 2000 to 1800).  After the 10 minutes the car idles
down to about 1000 and stays there and is smooth.  Is this what others
with this year car experience?

Secondly, this car has some electronic contraption under the seat that
I think has something to do with the oxy sensor but I am not sure.
What does this thing do and what happens when it breaks.

I have been an electronics designer for many years and still dont
really trust the stuff.

Thanks for any help.

I moved my 73 911 along with my wife's Supra in the trailer of an

the way and did some minor damage to the Supra, but the 911 came out

Several people have written me stating that the cruise control will 
deactivate if the clutch is engaged. When I stated the above, I was only 
commenting in regards to the cruise control keeping the car at a constant 
velocity and not at a constant engine speed. I do realize (and should have 
stated) that engaging the clutch will deactivate the cruise control (but 
after the engine revs) bringing the engine speed back to idle.

Thanks for the concern and definitely feel free to correct me in the future.

== Well now you've touched on a lengthy subject.  I have mucked with 
machinery and cars for 25+ years, it aint easy and it only comes with a 
'just do it and dont give up' attitude.  I got my start in 1967 at age 12 on 
a $5 used lawn-boy push mower.  after that it was a honda moped, my dad's 65 
mustang, a 5 1/2 hp johnson outboard, and then when I bought my first car 
($175 '64 plymouth sport fury) in 1971 it really took off.  Oh, and a '69 
dodge dart swinger 340 wedgie rocket ship..

==  I think my urge to wrench stemmed from how cheap a broken machine cost, 
and to repair it, then moved into the realm of  'I want it to run and look 
better'.  My father was an important element in this thanks to his and my 
younger brother's support and never ending love of broken cars, etc.
  My pop was so cheap he squeeked when it came to car fixin' which is why I 
learned very early on the difference between a hammer and a screwdriver. (a 
hammer hurts more when it hits you on the head)    This was a whole family 
enterprise.

==  So while in high school, I took all the auto classes they offered.  In 
my senior year (1973) I was doing a two hour a day class in the shop working 
on everything; but you start by doing brakes . . . (LEARN HOW TO MAKE IT 
STOP BEFORE YOU LEARN TO MAKE IT GO).  I also had a ravenous appetite for 
industrial arts and that is where I learned drafting, woodwork and metal 
work (including welding).  I graduated from high school with 24 credits more 
than neccessary to pass.

==  Then after wheat harvest (driving a combine -custom cutting) I went to 
DeVry institute for a couple years and got an associate's in electronics 
(ASET) which has carried me thru a working carreer up to now with NCR err 
AT&T err Hyundai.  Working on cars/bikes and TV's/stereos/computers went

my '82 911 idles after cold startup (like today below freezing) at 12-1400
for a few minutes then goes to about 1000 (or right away to 1000 if
I back out of the garage right after starting).  The idle doesn't drop
to the normal 850 until quite a while later.  In fact I can drive it for
a while and if the oil temp hasn't come off the peg it'll still idle

> 2. Is air conditioning worth it or even a big deal?

Air conditioning is very, very bad for 914s or any of the flat fours
for that matter. The huge impulse load across a very long lever arm
means that you tend to bend the crank right behind the Number 4
main bearing, and also tends to wear out the bearing in about 10K miles.

No. A friend of mine who was service manager for a Porsche dealer in the
early 70s says that they all had rust as the came off the boat. The closest
to a rust-free model I've ever seen was a '73 1.7 that was taken directly 
from the showroom floor and turned into a race car after being stripped and
cleaned first.

Does anyone have any Porsche repair manuals applicable to a 1987 944 S
that they would like to sell?  I currently do only light maintenance on
my car, however I would like to learn to fix some more complicated
problems.

== cant help you on 944 manuals (most people just bite the bullet and buy 
them) and they are expensive.  I justified my 914 manuals ($350) because I 
will always own a 914.

Also, most porschephile list members seem to be backyard mechanics to
one degree or another.  Where does one pick up the expertise needed to
rebuild an engine or replace a clutch?  Just learn by doing?  I am always
amazed at the complexity of the technical discussions that takes place on

== Well now you've touched on a lengthy subject.  I have mucked with 
machinery and cars for 25+ years, it aint easy and it only comes with a 
'just do it and dont give up' attitude.  I got my start in 1967 at age 12 on 
a $5 used lawn-boy push mower.  after that it was a honda moped, my dad's 65 
mustang, a 5 1/2 hp johnson outboard, and then when I bought my first car 
($175 '64 plymouth sport fury) in 1971 it really took off.  Oh, and a '69 
dodge dart swinger 340 wedgie rocket ship..

==  I think my urge to wrench stemmed from how cheap a broken machine cost, 
and to repair it, then moved into the realm of  'I want it to run and look 
better'.  My father was an important element in this thanks to his and my 
younger brother's support and never ending love of broken cars, etc.
  My pop was so cheap he squeeked when it came to car fixin' which is why I 
learned very early on the difference between a hammer and a screwdriver. (a 
hammer hurts more when it hits you on the head)    This was a whole family 
enterprise.

==  So while in high school, I took all the auto classes they offered.  In 
my senior year (1973) I was doing a two hour a day class in the shop working 
on everything; but you start by doing brakes . . . (LEARN HOW TO MAKE IT 
STOP BEFORE YOU LEARN TO MAKE IT GO).  I also had a ravenous appetite for 
industrial arts and that is where I learned drafting, woodwork and metal 
work (including welding).  I graduated from high school with 24 credits more 
than neccessary to pass.

==  Then after wheat harvest (driving a combine -custom cutting) I went to 
DeVry institute for a couple years and got an associate's in electronics 
(ASET) which has carried me thru a working carreer up to now with NCR err 
AT&T err Hyundai.  Working on cars/bikes and TV's/stereos/computers went 
hand in hand all these years and it has saved my bacon MANY times!  The 
result of this is I never have owned a new car (but I did buy a new dirt 
bike in 1981).

| Thanks to the people who responded to my earlier post on the subject, 
I have a
| pretty good procedure to follow.  Any last minute tricks or hints I 
need to be
| aware of?  Do I really need to disconnect the steering U-joint?

Yes. I found that I had to lower the crossmember about 2 inches along with
raising the engine about and inch and a half in order to get the mounts out/in.
The crossmember cannot be lowered unless the steering u-joint is disconnected.
The u-joint clamp bolt must be completely removed, not merely loosened,
as it runs through a depression in the steering rack input shaft. The 
nut on this
bolt is the self locking variety and very hard to turn. This is where my air
ratchet wrench paid for itself! BTW, purists say to never reuse self-locking
nuts, although I hadn't bought new ones so I reused the old ones. Hasn't
fallen apart yet!

I lifted the motor from above using a device that I fabricated from wood
to be a close approximation of the tool shown by the shop manual. I
guess it could be lifted using a bottle jack from underneath, but I would
be *real* _careful_ about how I put pressure on the cast aluminum oil
pan. At the least, use a large block of wood to spread the force about.
I also resorted to a large pry bar to lower the cross member.

Figuring how to rotate the mm about to get one out/in is a good test
of ones spatial cognition skills!

| What size sockets or wrenches will be required?

Just about all of a 3/8" drive metric socket set! Actually, if I recall 
correctly,
I needed 10, 13, 15, 17, and perhaps 19mm sockets. I found that a 13mm
swivel socket was a big help for the top mm bolts. That and about 18"
of extensions.

A ratcheting box end wrench is a big help in removing the bottom nut from
the motor mount. I believe it is 15mm, although I bought a set of these
wrenches. I tend to buy sockets and wrenches in sets rather than
peicemeal, since you will undoubtedly need the size you don't have;
if not this weekend, then someday soon.

Good luck!

Two companies we have used are Intercity Lines (800-221-3936) and TNT
Trucking (who actually transported the car via rail car).  I have no
reservations recommending Intercity, they handled the cars with kid gloves
and 3 out of 3 have arrived perfectly; they try to minimize the amount they
have to change your car's position in the truck or between trucks.  TNT,
with their rail-yard "longshoremen" putting our car on and off a train and
flat bed truck, managed to scratch it up on the drivers door.  The car also
arrived looking as if it had been tarred and rolled in a dust bowl.  the TNT
service cost about $800 to/from any major point in continental US, the
Intercity was close to a kilobuck.

On purchasing your car:  If you haven't got one picked out yet, don't pass
by the substantial savings by buying one from the ridiculously cheap Texas
market (at least in Houston).  Prices I've seen can be upwards of $5K less
on  $20 - $30 K range cars in Houston than either right or left coast...
 The buyer of our Carrera is still running around Nor Calif. bubbling about
the deal he got (even after paying to ship the car).

YMMV,

a U-Haul trailer.  (I discovered a 4 cyl S-10 truck can pull and even stop a 
911 on a 2100 lb flatbed trailer up and down some rather winding mountain 
roads.)

The problem is that the car usually has an irregular miss and occasionally 
COMPLETELY cuts out (even at a steady speed of 75+ mph).  While it is 
cutting out, plumes of white smoke pour out of the exhaust.  Usually it cuts 
out momentarily, but this time it cut out for good until about 5 hrs later. 
 It's got new wires, cap, rotor, plugs, O2 sensor, and even the new style 
cylinder head temp sensor.  I haven't replaced any of the ground 
straps/wires, but they all appear to be secure and in good shape.  I've 
discounted the possibility of having a borderline failed fuel injector 
because when the car cuts out, it goes immediately and completely (fuel pump 
or all injectors quit simultaneously).  I have yet to put a scope on the 
speed and flywheel position sensors to see if they're marginal.    If anyone 
has had any experiences with this type of problem, please give me some 
insight.

Regarding moving cars, I once moved a '70 Mustang, a Ford Galaxy 
convertible, and the furnishings of a 1BR apartment about 800 miles using a 
Rider truck.  The Mustang and the furniture rode inside, and the convertible 
was pulled on a dolly trailer (driveshaft was removed).  Aside from blowing 
one of the rear tires on the convertible, the trip was uneventful and the 
rental truck handled it w/no probs.

For the radar-detector surgeons among us:

It is well known in electronics manufacturing that everyday RTV (aka
silicone) is cured with acetic acid, which does two things other than
curing the stuff:

it iritates your nose, and
it eats metals (ie current conductors) as it cures.

There is an electronics-compatible RTV, called Dow Corning 3145.  You
might find it at a well-stocked electronics shop (=! Radio Shack).  It
works great for making PC boards weather-tight and vibration immune.

Jon,

The US source for the part is PCNA.  It's a K6 x 720 mm belt, p/n
999.192.290.50.  Be aware that to use it, you need to remove your
A/C compressor and your current alternator manifold, and install
a non-A/C manifold, p/n 944.603.134.01.  This is because the
polyrib belt in a car with A/C is tensioned by a turnbuckle to the
A/C compressor manifold.  The same turnbuckle is retained,
with some small changes to its mounting hardware, but tensions
the alternator on its new bracket.

You also need to replace the alternator cooling shroud with a
different one, 951.603.115.02.  Dependining on your car, you may
need to shorten the hose to it.

You will also have to replace a few fasteners.  The best thing to do
is review the US 'fiche, which gives a complete parts explosion
except that it does not call out a number for the bracket.  Nonetheless,
all parts are available from PCNA.  'Cause that's where I got mine.

Porschephilers!

Fellow Porschephile Wade Guthrie (wade.guthrie@nb.rockwell.com) had two photos
published in the current (that is December) issue of European Cars Magazine!!!
I believe the photos are on page 66(?) in an article about the POC "Tribute to
Le Mans" 3 hour night enduro.

The feature article is about PCA/POC member Mark Manda and his 912/935. Those
of you on the West coast who attend the PCA or POC club events out at the
"Springs" have probably seen Mark's car running against the likes of Martin
Snow and Rick Raimist. Mark recently won the POC one hour night enduro. The
article makes good reading.

Anyway... This was Wade's first time having photos published so blast him a
note and let him know if he has a promising career as a Porsche photographer. :)

Joe.

BTW: Wade is still in search of a '73 911 S. So if anyone knows of one for sale
please let him know.

Subject: Lambda FI frustration!

I have a desperate plea for advice I'd like to send out:
My humble but beloved 81 924 has developed a serious problem in the fuel 
injection system. Over the course of several months its Lambda FI system 
started pumping more and more fuel to the engine. At first it would just 
foul up the plugs, but now there's so much fuel being dumped it won't 
even run. I now have a new O2 sensor, new injectors, a new (used) main 
fuel pump and I've had the fuel distributor checked out.

Could the fuel pressure valve on the side of the distributor be at fault?
Or, as was recently suggested to me, a fuse somewhere in the system?!?

The car sat for a few years before I bought it and the system was filled 
with rust and dirt. I replaced the fuel tank and had the lines flushed 
when I discovered the problem, but I had already driven the car several 
thousand miles (and replaced the fuel filter a few times).

Any ideas out there?

JPL obviously knows more about this than I do, but we do have a
DOD materials expert on post, and he spoke very strongly (at least
in re the mid-80's AA formulation) about not using Armor All.

As I understood the explanation (pardon my possibly faulty
recollection of the chemistry involved), the vinyl (or other material)
in question is usually made from a resin (often hard or powery stuff)
with a plasticizer added to make it pliable.  The solvent used to keep
the Armor All active ingredient suspended in liquid also dissolves the
plasticizer, and hastens its departure from the material in question.

Think if it as trying to moisturize your skin with rubbing alcohol.
It may seem better when wet, but only accelerates washing the oil out
of your skin to leave it dryer than before.

Hi Stan, 
Sorry about the mix up on not finding my name on the p-who's list. I must be
losing it.
Well, the 65C sunroof is mostly  original,some touch up respray, small dent
in passenger door-car came off jack- gave me list of owners-three- with
mileage but no real records.

John Eisenbud,in Denver, found her the car in 87. I talked with him and he
feels it is original and really a nice car. Also, Jim Kellogg, also of
Denver, felt it was a  nice example of an original car, but he felt the car
is worth $18-$20. ( Do you  know these guys?) Now, it sounds like a nice car
without the proper pedigree papers. I must admit it's about the nicest one
that has been made available to me, besides a 65 SC that I wanted to purchase
last month in a Ca. I just was too far away to act on it fast enough. I don't
mind paying the fair market prices. Too often, because I have the WANTED sign
up for the 356, some owners add a few$$$$$ and want me to pay for their kid's
education. One guy called me with an all original 64C coupe. It has 100K on
it and he wanted $37,000.
 Although I am not a 911 ,928,or 944 person, the porschephiles have had some
interesting topics that I really enjoy reading. I do EMail some of the guys
directly and once in a I join in by posting something, I am more of the
silent supportive group. But thanks for keeping this most interesting forum
going.
 
I am also a member of the Lotus group. Although quite an entertaining and
commited group, I have never been able to "get into" the early British thing.
I own a 91 Elan which is like a world away from the more solid Porsches. But
this little turbo Elan is one fun car to drive and it is quite enjoyable
 discussing it with some of the 547 U.S. Elan owners .

Greg Crandell races a 912 targa (not 912E) on the national level, in the
Southeast Division (VA, NC, GA, FL), and other easily towable tracks
around the east coast.  He wins national races each year, and goes to the
Runoffs.  Still needs to have better luck at the runoffs, car is reliable,
but may be a little too heavy, and underpowered, but the suspension will
certainly be better, compared to the 356's.
 
He got involved in the big EP pileup at last years runoffs in Atlanta at
turn 11, and had to rebuild the car this year.  Plus, he got married, so
all of his race money dried up this year.  This year he has continued to
spend time building motors and putting them on dyno's, looking for
additional hp.
 
His 912 targa started life as a coupe, then after a couple of years racing
he cut it down to a targa, to be able to put the weight where he wanted
it.

Hi, Chris,

First thing to do is get a set of fuel system pressure gauges on the car and
see how close you are to nominal.  

That having been said, it is most likely your fuel distributor is
contaminated and allowing way too much fuel through.

Disassembly and thorough cleaning by a qualified person might help, or it
might be a waste of money.

Good luck,

Well....I've made five trips to Yosemite this year, most of them in the
Porsche. That's 200 miles each way. A year ago August, I drove up to
Ashland, Oregon--about 350 miles, I think. I may have used the CC part
of the time on that trip, since I was mostly on Interstate 5. I've also
driven the Porsche to and from San Diego (500 miles each way). Again,
I probably used the CC some.

But to me--and please don't anyone take this as an attack on using
CC!--the main reason to have a Porsche is because they're so wonderful
to drive, and when I don't have my foot on the accelerator--or I do,
but the car is in control of it--I feel as though I've lost a major
point of contact with the car. I depend on feeling what the car is
doing through the steering wheel, the driver's seat, and the
accelerator; when one of those is missing, it feels strange to me,
like the car is on autopilot or something.

YMMV--and I although it never would have occurred to me to include
CC if I'd bought the car new, it is nice sometimes on long, straight
roads with little traffic, such as interstates between urban areas.

Thank-you to all who responded to my request for info about interior &
exterior care - lots of what sounds like good advice based on experience.

About armorall:

When I bought my 944 only a year ago, its dash was nearly perfect - no
cracks. During the spring, before I applied armourall, the dash still had
no cracks. Then I applied armorall (twice, sparingly). And now there are
cracks radiating from most of the defroster vents! I can't conclude that
armourall was the cause of the cracks because it could have been the sun or
somthing else (or even a combination of factors), but I'm sure supicious,
especially in light of the comments I've seen here lately.

Now my was-perfect dash has cracks in it and I'd sure like to know of a way
to repair it or at least stop the cracks from growing. Anyone have any
ideas? (When the weather warms up, I plan to apply the vaseline treatment
several of you recommended. I'll also look into the 303 stuff.)

What is your oil pressure generally?  I notice that it is a lot lower in my

through the turbo & oil cooler as well.  I get about 3 to 4 bar at 3500 rpms
(hot 5W50 Castrol Syntec oil & an FRAM extraguard filter).  My 924 (on

             WANTED: Specs on 924S and 944 8 valve
	I am trying to determine which of
	these would be more competitive as a SCCA C Stock car.
	Also, if someone has information about different options
	on the car I would like to hear about them (e.g., 
	Franklin Wong's M030 924).

The M030 option is no longer legal in C-stock, these cars (924S and 944) have
been bumped into BS. They were barely competitive in CS, but the Solo board
had to punish them because of the rule change allowing lowering ride height
for cars which have adjustable height (911, 914 front, M030, etc). But they
did not know about this option on the 944 Turbo of '87-'88, they stay in
B-Stock with other non-S turbos and 944S(2).

I think the best Porsche bet in CS would be the '89 944, which had a bigger,
torquey engine. In PCA they are bumped up with the 944S, but in SCCA they are
with the normal 944. In BS I think the above mentioned M030 option 944T is a
good choice- maybe even a killer. In AS I hope my antique 911S can compete
with the MR-2 turbos.
I would like to see a 993 in A-Stock, but the stock wheel sizes available are
not so good for the available autocross tires.

P.S. If anyone is planning on running the Florida pro-solo in February, I am
looking for a car to co-drive. Also maybe some west-coast events???

Hi, Trond.
 
What is the size of the new overpriced former East German Pneumant tires? I
know that Pneumant has been making 165 R 15 exclusively for Porsche Classic
GmbH, at a price of DM 356.50. (And who said Germans have no sense of
humor...) That works out to about $240 a tire!!! You can get the biggest,
stickiest performance tires in the world, for more modern cars, for less
than that.
 
There is some sort of evil conspiracy in Germany between the TUEV and the
tire maker (and maybe Porsche Classic, or whatever they're called this week)
to put these things, and these exclusively, on 356s. It seems that the
regulators require H-rated tires on the 356, but there are no other brands
that make H-rated 165 series tires. Or something like that.
 
In this country, where it's nobody's business what size tires you put on a
car, you can buy Yokohama 008 or Bridgestone RE-71 for about $80 to $100
apiece, in 195/60 VR 15, and put them on 5 1/2 inch wheels. In Germany, the
5 1/2 inches are Verboten, or verboten for non-disc brake cars, (Aha! you
might overload ze suspension! You might bend ze front arms!) even though the
suspensions are identical for late and earlier cars (and identical, for
practical purposes, to Beetle stuff).
 
Oddly, there are German-made S-rated Continental 165 R 15 tires available
for cheap, like $65. But I understand that in Germany they are not approved
for the 356. I have them on my all-original '65 C coupe, because that's what
the factory Cardex said came on the car, and they give the car that
wonderful vintage feeling. It's all over the road in crosswinds, just like
the old magazine articles said. The '65 SC with modern 195/60 doesn't even
know what a crosswind is.

The reason for a Porsche is to drive it.  My recommendation is to

spend some of the $$$$ you might have spent on a transporter to get
it ready and then do it.  :-}  I drove my 32 year car halfway

Subject: *** SNOW SURVEY RESULTS ***

A couple of weeks ago, I asked the question:

Are you going to store your Porsche, or drive it in the snow ???

The possible answers were:

        a) will not drive the car at all (up on blocks for whole winter)
        b) will bring the car out for a spin if the roads are clear and dry
only.
        c) will drive in the snow unless it's really bad ...
        d) will drive in the snow no matter what.

I also asked what kind of car the person drove. I assumed that everyone
participating in the survey lived in an area where they would at least
encounter some snow this winter. Most people stated where it was they lived
so I could verify their "snowiness".

List participation: 48

Results: (by answer):

a) 12 (or 25%) - 5 911, 3 944, 1 914, 2 356, 1 unknown

b) 18 (or 37.5%) - 9 911, 3 944, 1 914, 1 951, 2 930, 2 928

c) 6 (or 12.5%) - 3 911, 1 924, 1 914, 1 951

d) 12 (or 25%) - 5 911, 6 944, 1 924

Overall, we have 50% in the middle (b or c) with the hard-core (all or
nothing) occupying the other 50%.

I was thinking of presenting the above data in various formats (by car,
etc.), but I figure with the raw data, anyone can manipulate it however
they like. It would have been nice to see more list participation (since by
Stan's count, there are over 900 people hanging out in this garage - I knew
I was feeling cramped for a reason !!!) so that more meaningful data could
have been collected ... oh well.

blends in with the snow so is hard for the average oblivious dork in his

really careful not to expose it to rust agents.
   The only other thing that could possibly change our winter driving

Subject: Header pipe diameter


Hi gang,

This car building stuff can sure be a pain...once you think
you have something figured out, you stumble across
something to prove you wrong.  Well, here is another
example of how Stan is right - what's good for race cars
is *NOT* necessarily good for the street.

Up until today I was going to get a set of stainless steel
headers made for my 3.0 SC engine in the 42mm (1 5/8")
diameter just like the factory race headers.  After all, I want
to go fast and if it's good for them....

The November Kit Car magazine has a section on headers
and their example was a 350cid Chevy V8 pumping out
about 300hp.  They tried different size headers (1 5/8, 1 3/4,
and 1 7/8) and found that the best overall compromise
results were obtained with the smallest headers they tried
(1 5/8").  They had dyno graphs of hp and torque and the
results surprised me - the small headers were 20-40 lb-ft
better than the larger ones from 3000-5300rpm.  The torque
fell off like a rock around then, but this engine redlines shortly
past that point anyhow.

For street driving and autox where acceleration is the name
of the game, not lengthy high-rpm driving like our friends on
the NASCAR circuit, the small diameter headers seem to
be the best way to go.

So, if this is 350 cid V8 experiment actually applies to the 911
boxer engine, what diameter of headers should I put on a
3.0 SC engine with Webers (otherwise stock)?  At first I thought
my 2.0 914/6 heat exchangers would be way too tiny at 33mm
but they may be OK after all - at least as good at the lower
RPMS like an oversize racing header...Perhaps 35mm would
be good since my exhaust ports are 35mm?

Have any of you experimented with this?

Thanks,

Subject: Should the next Porsche be a motorbike ?



Hye all of you !


I had a look last week-end on a french magazine dedicated to motor-bikes.

There was an article about the next Porsche ... a motorbike.  Is this just
a joke or a serious project ?  I don't know.  But if anyone is interested
in it, I can send him a short translation of the article.

In a few words, the bike had a beautiful shape and was tell to be very effi-
cient ... as a Porsche should be.


Even if this project should be sell in a few years under a another name
(BMW for example), it shows how Porsche is still efficient in high-engineering
dispite its actual financial difficulties (as far as I know).

Chris,
You can make a funnel by cutting the bottom out of a 1 qt. plastic oil
bottle. It's flat and crushable so it fits up front in a canvas bag with
quarts of oil and other messy maintenance items. When it's time to add
oil, just put the "funnel's" neck in your oil filler opening and you'll
have a LARGE target to aim the new oil at. Sure beats plugging the oil
bottle hole with your thumb, and keeps those extra tools from rusting,
too. A shop towel under the filler is a good precaution in any case, and
useful for wiping your hands after the deed is done.

Subject: Smoking 911

Hello, fellow Porschephiles;
    I sold my 1983 944 and purchased a 1983 Euro-spec 911 Targa last
Thursday.  I must say that the car is a blast to drive (not to mention all the
attention it gets). The car generally runs great except when it is first
started.  Upon start-up with the engine cold, there is a puff of
blue smoke (read: oil-burning) and during warm-up it smokes very
faintly and I can smell a trace of oil-burning from the exhaust.
When the car is fully warmed up, the oil-burning smell seems to be
completely gone withh no oil-burning smell whatsoever.  Does anyone
have any idea what may be causing this?  Also, the car has numerous
oil leaks from the engine compartment on to my driveway.  Is oil
leakage common problem among 911's or did I get taken for a ride on this
deal? Thanks for any help in advance.

Harry Hall did some dynoing down at Autothority on his twinn-plugged
ported webbered cam'd 3.4 ltr.  He found the cross over point for
horsepower to be about 6800 RPM for 1-5/8" to 1-3/4" headers.  This is
a pretty happy motor and has been run up to 7500 without braking.

In other words, unless you're building a 3.4 ltr or running something
smaller in the 8000 RPM range, you should stick with 1-5/8 max.

I have 1-5/8" on my 3.4 and it seems perfectly happy.

Subject: Leaky 1986 911 Carrera Windshield


I have just bought my first Porsche, a Black, whale-tailed 1986 911
Carrera Coupe. (I'll be joining the PCA shortly. :-))

On the way to work this morning, to my absolute shock and horror, water
was dripping out of my dashboard above the glove compartment and also just
below the central vent (dripping on the stick).  The contents of my
glove box where a touch damp. 

Not a good way to start my week.

I noticed wettness around the inside seal on the lower side of the windshield.

Questions:

1) Is there any PorschePhile recommended way of doing a "do-it-yourself"
   job on this seal? A dealer told me that no sealant is used on the gasket
   around the windshield. Thus to fix it means to replace it. To replace the 
   seal there is a risk of breaking the $600 windowshield, which, of course, 
   the dealer is not responsible for.

2) Given that the interior of the dashboard is now somewhat damp (possibly
   drenched), is there anything I should do? (take apart dash board and
   let air out, leave it sit, etc.) A dealer told me to just air out the
   car. (It's now inside with sunroof and windows open.)

3) Where does the "vent" on the outside middle front of the car just below the 
   windshield go? (I haven't ordered the shop manuals, or Bruce Andersons book 
   yet, so I have no diagrams or reference material on the car). Could this 
   vent be an additional source of water leaking into the dashboard?

Any replies to yml@radixii.com would be greatly appreciated. I'll summarize
any suggestions for the list.

    Since a Metallic paint actually contains particles of aluminum in it,
   if you don't clear coat it or keep an inch of wax on it, it will oxidize.
   A  "correct" restoration would probably use lacquer, which ages poorly,
   but I think everyone would suggest clearcoating over the base metallic.
     As far as paint types, you can't go wrong with Glasurit urethane, though
   Sikkens and Deltron are other very popular and very good paints. DuPont
   also probably has a comparable paint (not Imron) but I haven't used it.
   A lot of show cars get painted in acrylic enamel, but I can't fathom why 
   this is a popular paint as the urethanes are so good.

     The difference between the durability of your '91 Beemer and '72S is
   probably not the topcoat itself (which are probably both Glasurit).
   Especially on older cars most painters tend to use a -lot- of primer; 
   keeping the overall paint thickness down (remove -all- existing non-factory
   undercoats) and using Epoxy-type primers (PPG's DP-90 series is very good
   stuff and very popular) will help (most high-build primers are really 
   kind of weak, but shops use them to make their work easier). Other chips 
   are adhesion problems between types of paint or contamination (water or
   oil) or bad panel prep (especially on rusty surfaces) rather than just
   film failure.

Subject:      914 newbie questions

Actually I'm not even a 914 owner yet, but I've been
looking at a '75 "kit" and would welcome expert opinions
and advice.

1) Rust. Comments I've read via this list suggest that
virtually every 914 has some rust, and those in my locale,
the northeast US are the worst with good reason. The car
I'm looking at has rust through in a small area on the
fenderwell footpedal area up front and rockerpanel
rust from both jacking points back. The rust has also
gotten up into the dorr sill a bit on the passenger
side. I've poked and prodded in other locations, front
bay, engine compartment, floors, door and windshield
posts, abd everything else seems solid.

I rust repair in the areas I've mentioned feasible ?
If so, is it done via replacement pieces or fabrication
from meat sheet ?

2)Does anyone have any experience with CA emission
testing on 70s era Porsches ? New York state in its
infinite wisdom will institute emission testing, to
CA standards I believe, in 1995. I'd really hate to
get involved in this project and then find out I
can't drive this car. I was originally thinking of
substituting carbs for the elec. fuel-injection, but
now I wonder what ramifications that might have in
the emissions area as well.

Thanks in advance for the supportive advice I'm sure
that Porschephiles will contribute; if I decide that
this project is beyond my ability/budget I'll be sure
to post the particulars for the car I've located so
that another enthusiast can have a crack at it.

This sounds like my story about two years ago.  I bought my '72 911T which 
had a "slight" oil leak.  Being the fairly talented backyard mechanic that
I am (used to rebuild VW engines, etc when I was younger), I thought I could 
easily solve the problem.  The oil leaked onto the left heat exchanger, which
burnt the oil, causing smoke and smell.  Well, it first looked like it was
the valve cover gasket, so I replaced them all.  No difference. Then it looked
like it could be the seal where the camshaft exits the housing for the injection
pump, as it was oily around there. Changed it, but only a slight improvement.
Then I cleaned it all up and put the car on jacks and ran the engine and just
laid under and watched with a bright trouble light.  I quickly became depressed
when I could see that the oil was coming from the joint between the cam housing
and the head. Especially since the seller of the car told me that it had been
rebuilt about 10K prior to my buying the car. (I figured that a little oil leak
was worth fixing in order to get a nearly rebuilt engine).  Well to make a 
long story short, I pulled the engine and started to strip it down, finding 
shot tensioners, missing washers under screws and nuts, liquid gasket instead 
of proper gaskets, and other garbage.  I decided to pull the heads once I had 
the cam housing off and found two burnt valves so I went to work on the other
side of the engine.  (When I bought the car I did a compression check which 
showed high, even compression! I thought the engine was good!)  I then decided 
to pull the cylinders off even though the cylinders looked fairly new.  The 
number 3 piston was missing a circlip on the pin, which was allowing that pin
to float back and forth, scoring the cylinder wall.  Turns out some idiot
friend of the prior owner "rebuilt" the engine for him... Sorry to be rambling
here but this is good therapy for me to let this out to an audience who can 
possibly understand!  Well anyway you know this was all quite expensive and
frustrating to fix.  I now have it all together and am fairly satisfied, 
except I still get smoke at startup with new valve guides and seals!  I have
just learned to live with it.  My theory is now that the scavenge action of
the oil pump is weak or the pump gears are badly worn which allows the
crankcase to fill with oil which overflows into the cylinders where some
seepage around the pistons may be occurring while the car sits parked.
Does that sound plausable?  Well Gene, I probably didn't answer your
question but misery loves company...

Bill.

I agree this should be a good CS car.  The one advantage of the '86 944

I loosened the steering ujoint expecting it to

it looked like a pain to re-align while raising the
cross arm, lowering the engine, rubbing my belly,

I used the large block of wood on the oil pan with no
ill effects, and the largest pry bar available for the

You'll need 10, 13, 15, 17, 19 mm stuff. The motor
bracket to motor mount bolts were the toughest.  On
my '84 944 these were 13mm.  I didn't have a racheting box wrench

about 15 degrees of rotation each time, and used up a lot of

Yes there is help for you.  I have gone throught the exercise of replacing the 
tumbler pins in my driver door lock since the previous owner replaced it with a 
new assembly and new key (which did not come with the car).  All you need to do 
is pick up a used tumbler assembly ( I belive any year will do ) and remove the 
lever arm at the tail end and install it on your lock.  If the tumbler casting 
is destroyed you will need to open it up very carfully and remove the tumbler 
pins and springs.  Open your old assembly and do the same, be shure to keep the 
tumblers in the correct order and reinstall them in your new assembly in the 
SAME order ( this is critical if you want to use the same key again).  Make sure 
you lightly lube the lock cylinder with white lithium grease ( not too much or 
it will get all over your key each time you insert it).  While you are at it you 
will want to clean and lube the rest of the locking mechanism and latches.  
This is a tried and true method I performed my self with the direction of a 
profesional locksmith.  My lock never worked better after this proceedure.

An alternate solution is to have the original dash repaired.  They
recover the original.  I hear it looks like new and most guarantee it
never to crack again.  In addition to recovering it, there was a company
down in Texas that was selling "replacement" dashes.  They were not
padded, but hard hard plastic.  I think the cost was about the same as
the repair.

This info is 2 years old....  I posted it back in Oct 92.

Subject: Dash Restoration


For those of you with cracked dashes, especially the ones that own
924/944 cars, read on.

I have been collecting information and have found three companies that
do this work in the USA.  I found other companies that sell 911 and
other European car dashes and do repairs.  These companies can restore
the 924 style dash.  They don't care about the condition of the dash.
They rebuild it from scratch, using some sort of vacuum forming
process.  The price range is from $335 to $430 for the 924 and takes 2
to 3 weeks I was told.  This compares to about $200 in Australia per
Kelvin Ross, who started me on this research project.  I really hate
the Dash-Topper / Coverlay fix.  Of course, you have to remove the dash
and live without the car for a couple of weeks...  Removing the dash is
the easy part.  Living without the car is something you learn to do
when you own a 931.  I forgot, you might have to justify the expense to
a significant other.  That could be the hardest part.

     I don't know about Armor all breaking causing plastic or vinyl to
     age prematurely and crack.  I have been using it on my 1980 Toyota
     Corolla for 10 years.  I have seen the same model and year cars
     in parking lots with cracks the size of the grand canyon. 
     (obviously no armor all used).  I can attest personally to the
     protection power of the liquid.

Yermo,

     Even  here in So. Cal., where winter prep means putting  the
Targa  top back on, window seals sometimes leak.  Mine was easily
solved  with  a $5 tube of window sealer from the local  discount
car parts place.  Also, windshields don't cost $600, not even for
Sigla.   I  had a domestic windshield INSTALLED for $160.   As  I
recall, Sigla would have been $100 more.

     That   hood   vent  supplies  the  unheated  air   for   you
"ventilation".   There  is probably  provision for  draining  off
water that enters.  I've never had a problem there.

my '82 911 idles after cold startup (like today below freezing) at 12-1400
for a few minutes then goes to about 1000 (or right away to 1000 if
I back out of the garage right after starting).  The idle doesn't drop
to the normal 850 until quite a while later.  In fact I can drive it for
a while and if the oil temp hasn't come off the peg it'll still idle
at 1000.

Martin,
        My '82 911SC Targa does take longer time to warm up than "Older"
'73 911E I had, in cold weather maybe 10 minutes idle is 2K +, also I 
notice it will "Hunt" between 1500-2000 if weather is cold and very damp,
I think it's just because engine generally runs much cooler.

I believe fuel economy and pollution is the two main reasons the 4cycle 
engine successed over the 2cycle engine.

The problems with the 2stroke is (was?); not so efficient combustion (=high 
consumption) and pollutions from the 2cycle oil that is added to the fuel.

The advantage with the 2cycle is; less moving parts, high HP/liter specs 
(=smaller engines).

Actually *those* are the tires they tested. Guess the sale was not what they

It seems however they have decided to adjust the price a little.

Has Michelin left their MXV(?) or 'what M was it' production? I think they 
had (have) very competitive tires for the 15 inch wheels. Standard driving 
that is. I have used Nokia tires on Beetles, and been very Happy with them, 
tremendous life and good grip! not like Dunlop Sport SP (?) but a lot 
cheaper too.

I have nearly zero knowledge of this subject, but I DO want to raise a
flag here.  I understand (forget where I heard this, sorry) that one of
the active ingedients of A-A is Mineral Oil.  Vaseline is also Mineral
Oil, albeit with a somewhat higher pour point.  Both are highly refined
petroleum.  Same origin as the stuff in your gas tank.

My experience with Mineral Oil comes from submerging various electronic
assemblies in it for the purpose of dropping them to the bottom of the
ocean.  Though the stuff seems innocuous (you can buy it in the store as
Baby Oil, after all), it has a fair degree of solvent power.  I've seen
printing and adhesive labels removed, and of more interest here, ** PVC
(poly vinyl chloride) plastic wire insulation hardened to the cracking
point** !!.  I now regard mineral oil about like I regard paint thinner,
and I believe I'll be looking for something else when baby has a diaper
rash.

My amateur explanation is that mineral oil can leach the plasticizer out
of vinyl, thus by extension Vaseline *probably* would also.  To me, the
ideal thing to rub onto vinyl would be more plasticizer... though I've
heard entertaining things about the toxicity/user friendliness of these
compounds (or in other words, "don't drink out of a garden hose that's
been lying in the sun").  Perhaps one of the actual Real Chemists among
us could comment further on the subjeck?

Bruce,

The oil I am now using is Valvoline 50W racing oil. Before that I was using
Castrol GTX 20/50.  Your question "how come some of them don't smoke" makes
me wonder if you are implying that many of them do smoke at startup.  Is this
something that many owners of earlier cars just live with?  Interestingly, 
the smoke from my car ('72 T) is much worse when it has been parked on a 
downhill slope than when parked uphill.  Do you have any suggestions about
proper oil which may reduce smoking? 

On a brighter note, I am happy with the engine once it is warmed up.  While
involved with doing all of the repairs, I felt I needed to see some performance
benefit after going through all of the trouble of cleaning up after that 
"Yahoo" mechanic.  I installed a pair of E cams, Webers, and SSI exchangers.
That combination made quite an improvement in the seat-of-the pants feel.  Of
course the gas mileage has suffered, but I don't commute in it regularly so its
tolerable.  Fun car!

Thanks, 
Bill.

I experience the same thing even after changing to SWEPCO gear

I thought synthetic oil is not recommended for brand new and newly
rebuilt engines because it prevents the proper break-in of the
various engine parts. Are the 993 engines broken-in at the factory?

After my 3.0 SC engine was rebuilt, I did not use synthetic oil till
I had 3000 KM. Was that the correct thing to do?

Yo fellow P-philes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had a great weekend w/cars (carb rebuild on my babe's Toyota (got to stay 
current w/the masses!) and PLENTY of 928 action.  I replaced the master cylinder
with one from Performance Products (it was complete, clean, and had all the 
holes plugged w/little caps!) and the part fit perfectly.  I bled the brakes
w/my great little MityVac and replaced a few more of the junk vaccuum lines 
w/good stuff.  And, most importantly, I confirmed that my by-pass surgery for
the angioplast-less crankcase vent hose worked perfectly.  The bottom line is:

		I'll be racing in San Diego on Saturday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll be number 403, the ugly blue '79 928 w/a dented left front fender (no Pete,
I haven't got that fixed yet!).  

Someone wrote (a 928 owner) that sometimes their brake pedal seemed to stick. 
Does this happen when the weather is cold?  The car is cold?  My car used to do
this before I replaced the master cylinder.  It was a really wierd feeling having
your brake pedal bounce from the floor to your foot; made for some less than 
smooth stops.

And as for tire size verses wheel width, is it safe (for racing and street) to
put 245/45 tires on 7x16 inch wheels?  All I'm concerned about is safety; if it 
is safe, I'll worry about clearance issues later.  Has anyone tried this?  And
how many Zone 8 (S.D.) points will I be awarded for deviating from stock 225/50
tires?  Is it a point per tire or per axle?  Mr. Albrecht (either one since I'll
see you both at Murph on Sat AM), will the rules makers be there too?

This tire size point thing is a real drag.  But eventually I'll understand the 
rules!  Please be patient with me!

Hello all,

Myself, my father and a mutual friend are toying with the idea of building
a 911 track/auto-x only car.  The primary purpose would be to save on
the wear and tear of our street cars, secondarily to avoid having to
make the compromises one is forced to make if one drives the car to
work every day.

At the moment we are in the "Hmmm, how much will this really cost ?" stage.
We are thinking that we might be able to get something reasonable in the
$12,000-15,000 range.  Allowing:

Early 70's 911, not cosmetically good but rust free
w/either no motor/trans or after selling motor/trans.
on good susp/brakes wheels                                 2,500

915 Tranny core                                              800
SC motor core                                              2,000

Rebuild tranny (ourselves)                                 1,000

Rebuild motor ourselves - not full race but some           5,000
performance incl webers/headers instead of FI

Roll cage, 5 point belts, 2 good seats                     1,800

We plan on a continuing upgrade program over the life of the car with 
at least the early emphasis being stopping and turning better before
really making it go faster.  Again, this is not intended to be a
really competetive car, just one to let us have fun and pretend
like we're in with the big boys.

If anyone can give me some input on my prices or direction I'd appreciate
it - we're not at the point yet to be able to use the detailed info
(like which pistons to use) but help us out on the big picture.

Someone also mentioned that we might be able to defray some operating costs
by renting the car to people who don't want to use their own cars.  Does
anyone know how PCA or SCCA would feel about that ?

Bill,

Going by the 1994 Zone 8 Driving Event Competition Rules (in effect for
this one last event, BTW) you'll get 2 pts for the 245 tires on your
early 928.  And, that's points for the car.  If only one of your tires
is 245 and all the rest are 225s, you get 2 points same as if you had
all 4 245s (as the rules read, the widest tires on car).  As for worring
about the rules makers, what you really have to worry about is that 
Bob knows. 8-)

No, No, Yes, No, depends, No, probably not.

Seriously, if the rule book does not SPECIFICALLY STATE that a modification
is legal, it is illegal. That is the main point to remember. Any chip mod,
a larger turbo, stiffer springs, wider wheels, and other PCA legal upgrades
(bushings, rear swaybar, etc) are all ILLEGAL. These would only be legal
to change if they were factory options INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY (not by a
dealer) for your model year car. Adjustable shocks are legal because the rule
book states that any shock mounted in the original manner is legal. Exhaust
behind the cat converter is free for the same reason.

In SCCA there is Stock, Street prepared, Prepared, and modified groups.
Each car can compete in only ONE class in each of these groups. So once
you put on a strut brace, you can only run in ASP.  BSP is for completely
different cars. The rule book lists your car in ASP only. In PCA, if
you do a few modifications you can move up into one-faster (usually) in
the same group (i.e. P13 to P14). This seems "friendlier", but at high
levels of competition it does not work. SCCA is friendlier in a few
important rules : Any tire diameter is legal, as is ANY factory option.
In PCA you get bumped for a Stock limited slip, which you need anyway.
The rule that bumped you may seem to make no sense, but it has to be that
way so everyone plays with the same rules. If they let you run with a
strut brace, then maybe they would have to let someone else run with a chip,
or springs, etc.

>One last question - as long as I'm in ASP, what else can I do to the car to

See the SCCA rule book for legal Street Prepared modifications. Basically,
a 944 Turbo will never win ASP with evenly matched drivers. A 911 or
Lotus is much lighter and quicker. It is unfortunate that there is not
another SP class where the 944T could be competitive. Off the top of 
my head, you would be wise to go to stiffer springs, shocks, sways,
headers, low-restriction exhaust with no Cat, bigger wheels, Hard suspension
bushings, strong limited slip dif, etc if you want to do your best in
Street Prepared in your 944 Turbo (what is a 951??? Why do you guys keep
calling them 951's? I guess it started when 924 Turbo owners learned their
cars were officially "931" models - sounds cool, related to a 930! 944 Turbos
are great cars, don't be shamed into calling them 951's. 
Sorry for getting off the track.)

My advise would be to stay in BS! You have the KILLER car in the class
now if you do a few simple things :

1) Remove the strut brace
2) Get all parts for the factory M030 option package (struts, springs, 
   sway bars, etc). (First double check with SCCA if it's legal).
3) Lower the car as much as possible with the front M030 struts. Then
   set the rear height about the same.
4) Get the car aligned and weight balanced. Get some negative camber-
   1 1/2 to 2 degrees front and rear (I'm not a 944 expert, but this should
   work OK).
5) Remove any heavy options (only options, not any standard equipment).
6) Kick butt in BS! ! ! !

You know, I heard from someone (a few months ago) that to get better performance
you should mix tire sizes from left to front.  Will this be a left-hand track
or right?  Seems his name started with a "T".   Maybe that was just a nightmare.

I understand that the reason is the big E word: Emissions.

Most 2 stroke engines, including Wankel rotaries, have a lot of
unburned fuel blowthrough because of the lack of distinct intake and
exhaust cycles.  This translates to excessive tailpipe HC's unless some
heavy-duty catalytic conversion takes place.  Also, fuel economy
suffers if you're blowing it out the back.

Orbital Engine Company evidently has a proprietary way of solving
this problem, and is aiming at the outboard engine (and other)
markets. I have heard of Chrysler efforts to cure the problem using a
blown (supercharged) engine.  Supposedly, the trick in both of these
cases is direct, high pressure fuel injection... a la Herr Diesel.

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute): 
          Houston: e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
                   voice:  (713) 661-2084 
                   FAX:    (713) 661-0633
          Edison:  e-mail: stan@netsmiths.com 
                   voice:  (908) 287-8070 
                   FAX:    (908) 287-3883

     His cars currently include:  
          '81 Euro 911SC Targa (daily driver when he's where it is)
          '74 914 2.0 (SCCA ITA/PCA Club Racing)
          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America.  What do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

=======================================================================

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1966 through
            1969.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a Porsche-built variant with a two-litre 911 engine 
            inserted in place of the four-cylinder engine and other 
            refinements.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, introduced in 4/94.

=======================================================================

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

=======================================================================

What are the meanings of terms and acronyms I've seen in the list?

     BTDT = Been there, done that
      BTW = by the way
      FAQ = Frequently asked questions (but you knew that)
      FTP = file transfer program
     FWIW = For what it's worth
     IMHO = In my humble opinion

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even

carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed

=======================================================================

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

=======================================================================

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications.
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.
If they want to be known, they will announce their presence.  (Besides,
your definition of "renowned" may differ from mine.)

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute can do
so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are always
welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

my '82 911 idles after cold startup (like today below freezing) at 12-1400
for a few minutes then goes to about 1000 (or right away to 1000 if
I back out of the garage right after starting).  The idle doesn't drop
to the normal 850 until quite a while later.  In fact I can drive it for
a while and if the oil temp hasn't come off the peg it'll still idle
at 1000.

Martin,
        My '82 911SC Targa does take longer time to warm up than "Older"
'73 911E I had, in cold weather maybe 10 minutes idle is 2K +, also I 
notice it will "Hunt" between 1500-2000 if weather is cold and very damp,
I think it's just because engine generally runs much cooler.

     The Electronic contraption under my driver seat is the Alarm System
and under the pass seat is a Bosh Power Amplifier for the Stereo. I 
believe OXY sensor is located in engine compartment however my car is a
Calif. Car and could be different. I have been told if sensor breaks not
that big a deal, car may idle a little funny.    Bob

Subject: Building From Scratch 911 race car

Here are some other conciderations you may need or have overlooked:

Torsion/sway bars  	$1000
Shocks		   	$500
Carrera Flares	   	$500 (installed, if you're lucky!)
Wheels		   	$600
Carrera brakeS/
Aluminum trailing arms  $600
Oil cooling/lines	$500
Replacement oil tank    $100
Replace Axles		$200
SS Brake lines            50
Brake pads		$100
			$4150

May I make an intrusive suggestion?

It MAY be cheaper to start with a running '78 SC.  You'll have the
flares, trailing arms, adequate brakes on the rear, some oil cooling,
and galvanization.  I'm not convinced that the weight can't be taken
off.

Just an opinion.

I once started adding my car up and gave up...

It ususally is cheaper to find a car that's close to what you want and
let someone else have eaten quite a bit of the price.  Even if you
completely assemble it, you;'ll have all the parts on hand.  I
understand the appeal of an early car but it can nickle and dime you to
death.

S


- ---------------Included"
At the moment we are in the "Hmmm, how much will this really cost ?" stage.
We are thinking that we might be able to get something reasonable in the
$12,000-15,000 range.  Allowing:

Early 70's 911, not cosmetically good but rust free
w/either no motor/trans or after selling motor/trans.
on good susp/brakes wheels                                 2,500

915 Tranny core                                              800
SC motor core                                              2,000

Rebuild tranny (ourselves)                                 1,000

Rebuild motor ourselves - not full race but some           5,000
performance incl webers/headers instead of FI

Roll cage, 5 point belts, 2 good seats                     1,800

We plan on a continuing upgrade program over the life of the car with 
at least the early emphasis being stopping and turning better before
really making it go faster.  Again, this is not intended to be a
really competetive car, just one to let us have fun and pretend
like we're in with the big boys.

If anyone can give me some input on my prices or direction I'd appreciate
it - we're not at the point yet to be able to use the detailed info
(like which pistons to use) but help us out on the big picture.

Someone also mentioned that we might be able to defray some operating costs
by renting the car to people who don't want to use their own cars.  Does
anyone know how PCA or SCCA would feel about that ?

*YES*  It's okay if it's a '72, but it's gotta be a Targa.  Thanks for

Phil,
    
The Bridgestone tires are in their race compound.  At a typical drivers 
ed weekend (appro 1.5 to 2.0 hours track time, you may get two weekends 
out of these tires.  Use very high pressure (44 lbs cold) to prevent 
rollover.  IMHO, these are really better suited for autocross.
    
This was my experience in my 914 2.0 with 205/50 15's.  Your results 
(+1000 lbs over the 914) may vary.

| Hello Porschephiles!
|
| My '87 924S (same drivetrain as 944) is having difficulty shifting when
| cold, esp the 1st to 2nd shift.
|
| Some people have mentioned changing the transaxle lubricant to Redline MTL
| or something from SWEPCO.
|
| What's the general wisdom on this?  What are the sources for the above
| mentioned oils?  I seem to remember there being a 800 number for Redline

I was having a terrible time shifting between 1st and 2nd, especially down-
shifting, in my '84 944. I then filled my trans with Swepco 201 and things
have improved dramatically. It still is a little sluggish when cold, but is
much better at all temperatures.

I got the oil mail order from Zims in Texas.

I understand that Redline is every bit as good as Swepco...

BTW, the fill and drain plugs use the same size internal hex drive as VWs,
so I got the hex head 3/8" drive tool from a VW parts place. And I used a
"giant turkey baster" suction pump to get the gear oil from its container into
the trans. These things look sort of like a cross between a syringe and a
grease gun and are invaluable for this sort of application. Available at your
local auto supply.

Subject: Re: Smoking 911

Welcome to the leaking oil club! Remember, your engine is a vertically 
opposed beast, so some of the oil never drains downwards. Also, many 
rebuilders don't put seals on the exhaust valve guides, the thought being 
it's better to transfer heat to the valve than to worry about a little 
oil leakage. You also have 12-13 quarts to work with. There are many more 
horizontal and vertical gaskets on your engine than other types, so 
unless you have a concrete driveway, or it really bothers you just put in 
a quart every once and a while.

Subject: 2 stroke versus 4 stroke

Given the usual measure of engine size (displacement) small 2-stroke
engines can generate more power than an equivalent 4-stroke and can
be tuned for higher RPM because of no valves.  This high power comes
at the cost of a rather narrow power band because the need for a
tuned exhaust.  Without this, 2-strokes are not better.  In addition
they are very fussy about fuel mixture and commonly sieze if allowed
to run lean.

If you scale the cylinders to larger displacement (say 400 cc/cylinder)
the advantages of a 2-stroke greatly diminish.  They are significantly
more polluting because of the use of the crankcase in the fuel flow
(unless supercharged) and the need to lubricate mains and rods.

Supercharging works, but is generally considered suitable only
for constant speed fuel injected applications (mostly diesel).

I raced a 100 cc two-stroke twin bike years ago.  It would generate
something like 20 hp and about 100 mph on the track.  I still have
my 59 Berkeley 500 cc sports car, but it sits as a car needing a
small project to get it back on the road.  That was a great car
when my everyday transportation was a similar year beetle.

The subject of 944 motor mounts has been a sticky one. The present mount is
NOT hydraulic. It has a mechanical spring internally integrated. It should 
last many miles longer than the hydraulics. Probably 150,000 miles due to
the construction. All 968s have this mount, very few have had any mount 
problems.

If your mounts are bad, get them replaced! Other damage can occur.

968 for sale. Requires some work. It needs some front body work and a minor

I haven't a clue if Porsche is actually planning to build a motorcycle,

machine meant only to raise Yamaha's technological profile. Moreover, 
Ferrari is right now collaborating with Cagiva (aka Ducati) to build a

Hi, Bill.  According to one of my German tire engineering textbooks,
recommended rim widths for 245/45 are 8, 8 1/2, 9, and 9 1/2. Widths for
225/50 are 6 through 8 inches. Can you use 7 inch? Probably. But it's not
recommended and wouldn't be allowed in Germany (TUeV would get all upset).
 
Rules -- let's see, a stock 79 928 is in I/Stock, which has no penalty
points assessed if you have no wider than 215 tires on it, +2 points if you
have 230-245 as widest tires on it, and +4 points if you have over 245 on
it. So if you have no other modifications, you can run 245s without bumping
up a class. You can even run wider if you want, that will cost you 4 points,
but since you're allowed a total of 6 points before going up a class, you
could even run R compound (any tire with treadwear rating less than 75)
245 tires which would give you 6 penalty points. That would probably be your
hot setup. I don't have any tire lists handy to tell what's available out
there, but you could try European Motorsports in Vista (the guys who
campaign that quick 912).

Subject: 2 stroke vs. 4 stroke, Orbital engine

 
Hi, Mike.
 
The problem with 2 strokes is that there isn't much time for complete
combustion to take place. Orbital's concept is to blow the fuel into the
cylinder with a high pressure air blast, which is supposed to divide the
fuel up very finely and so it vaporizes and burns quickly. (Last I heard,
it wasn't perfect yet.)
 
Diesel fuel burns on a different principle than gasoline. Gasoline burns as
a premixed flame; the gasoline has to vaporize and then it burns. Diesel
undergoes droplet burning; there is a thin surface layer on the drops that
burns, eating its way inward. That's how diesels can run such lean mixtures,
they sort of carry their "correct" mixture around on the surface of the
drops, not spread throughout the cylinder. If you atomize diesel fuel more
finely, it burns faster (small droplet gets eaten up faster) and you have a
harsher combustion process.
 
Old Man Diesel's original idea was to use a high pressure air blast to blow
finely powdered coal dust into the cylinder. Same idea; coal dust burns on
surface. This wasn't too reliable (can't tell from my books if it ever ran
as such) so he switched to a liquid fuel.

Define "feasible". If you mean can you do it at home for $100, then
NO! If you mean can a competent shop do it at all, the answer is 
ABSOLUTELY. In Houston, I use a shop that dose simply spectacular
work (slow, but very very good). They typically fabricate most of
the parts they need, but often by commonly replaced parts (inner
rockers, floor pan sections, door jambs) with Porsche or aftermarket
parts (most of the catalog places have them, as does Mill Supply and
some of the other big replacement metal parts houses). Cost? Well,
down here, if I deliver a *STRIPPED* car (no interior, nothing on the
outside, no trim, no engine/trans/halfshafts, etc) I can typically
get all of the rust fixed and the car repainted correctly in the 
right color for $2.5k MAX -- for a 914. 911s are higher, 356s are
MUCH higher (but one of these guys has experience fabricating 356 parts
back to when you could buy NEW 356s, so it's good work...)

No can do. Gotta have bone-stock EFI *AND* exhaust. Which, BTW, is
the BEST reason to pass on this car -- you really want a '73 or '74
which is a better car, has less emissions crap, and probably if you
look hard enough wouldn't have the rust...

RAZs were the old road racing tire. When you shave it to road racing depth,

Just enough to pass the "tread depth" requirement for SS and IT racing.
Not recommended for street tires, not really recommended for track tires

The old P7s *MUST* go, but I'd **HIGHLY** recommend other tires. As much

Subject: 911 bad noises!'

Here's one for diagnosis!

 The application is a 1966 911. The vehicle has 65,000 original miles on
it. I started my car one evening when it was apx 30 deg out. I heard an unusual
backfire, the the vehicle started normally. I am very careful about not stressing
an old engine while it is warming up. I babied it home (apx 3 miles from
startup). I noticed what would sound like a stuck lifter (in a car appropriately
equipped). After arriving home I though I would take it around the block again to
notice if the noise was for real, or just in my mind ;-). About 1 block from
home I heard a terrible noise. You know the type...sounds like *heavy* bank
withdrawals....repeated visits from UPS and charges to Stoddard!  The engine ran
for no more that 15-20 seconds and was immediately parked. I never lost oil
pressure.

        So....tonight while getting the hands greasy...Begging for the use of
out technician's tools..I decided to attempt diagnosis.

 Observations.

#1 Car has not jumped time. It is within 1-2deg of TDC while rotor is pointing
    at cyc #1. (our tech did that diagnosis)
#2 All 4 valve cover gaskets were removed. Nothing unusual looking with
    any of the rockers.
#3 Passenger side cam cover removed. Nothing unusual there Can't move
    tensions by hand.
#4 Now the bad part (I think) drivers side cam cover removed. When I put
    tension on the chain I can see the tensioner move. Small metal flecks
    observed. Origin unknown.

Questions!!

 Am I correct in assuming I lost the drivers side tensioner? I assume that
there has never been an upgrade done there. How do I tell? Where could the
metal chips come from? Seeing that it didn't jump time, did I just save my self
from going into the engine? What would you do with the tensioners. Upgrade?
Oil feed...or isn't there a spring/hydraulic type?


 I would LOVE to have to drop the motor. You know..do that bonding type thing.
detail the engine area, replace the motor mounts and trans mounts ect..
Heck, if all I have to do is install new tensioneers I might just drop it  and
clean and repaint the shrouds ect.. I don't think there will be too much more
driving to be had in PA! I just don't want to have to drop 2-3k into it when IT
want's it ..not me!

I'm not sure....but a tensioner failed on my 2.3 engine
a while back.  I drove the car over to my friend's place
and he came running up the driveway telling me to
shut the engine off.  He asked me how long that "noise"
has been happenning and I said just a few minutes.

My tensioner had collapsed - but the nifty little clamp
that he installed on the tensioner a year before
prevented the chain from skipping and destroying
my funky high-compression racing pistons.

I don't know what the general "net-wisdom" is on those
little clamps that prevent the tensioner from collapsing
completely, but I'm sold!!!

Subject: Interference on audio system (& factory oil)


I have a '94 911 Carrera 2 Cabriolet (sometimes called a 993).  In
general I'm very happy with the car, but I've got a problem with the
audio system.

I ordered the "Klangpacket" (I don't know what it's called in
English): it consists of additional speakers and amplifiers in the
doors.  This is a big help in a cabriolet with the top down.  When the
engine is running, there's an interference which comes through on the
system.  It's a constant frequency (at about 0.5 Hz I estimate) and
independent of whether or not the car is in gear, moving etc.  If the
engine is off, the interference goes away.  The intensity of the
interference is independent of the volume setting.  The interference
is always present (radio, tape, CD).

My dealer spent quite a lot of time looking at the problem (even had
Bosch in for a day trying to work it out), but hasn't been able to
solve it.  Now I have to decide what the next step is.  I can *live*
with the interference: it isn't very loud, and frankly if I didn't
mainly listen to orchestral and operatic music it probably wouldn't
bother me, but whenever there's a quiet passage I can hear the
interference, which is irritating.

So: Three questions:

1. Is it worthwhile writing to Porsche complaining about this?  I'm
   willing to do this, but I was wondering if anybody on the net has
   experience in dealing with Porsche on issues like this.  I don't
   want to waste a lot of time dealing with Porsche if I'm not likely
   to get anywhere.  The dealer has invested a couple of (completely
   unsuccessful days) looking at the problem, so I don't see the
   point in dealing with them anymore.

2. Any ideas what might be causing the problem?  The fact that the noise
   is constant volume means it must be induced somewhere after the
   amplifier.  The cables to the speakers are (apparently) shielded.

3. Anybody else with a Klangpacket having these problems?

Apart from this problem, I love the car: the audio system is pretty
low down the list of priorities, but for what these cars cost, Porsche
should be able to deliver basics like an interference-free radio.
Maybe the best suggestion would be to get rid of Bosch (Blaupunkt) as
a supplier.

With regard to the discussion on motor oil, I can confirm what Robert
Dean said: my car was delivered from the factory with Shell motor oil,
but the dealers in Switzerland use BP, which is apparently fine with

Subject: 914 keys


For some reason, Porsche does not like to admit that the locks
are very easy to re-key.

My sister took her 1-year-old porsche to the dealer for a broken
driver's door lock, and they forced her to use a secondary (red)
key for the new lock.

When I bought my 914, it needed three keys, and the passenger door
did not have a key.

Luckily, the front hood and the ignition still used the same key.
So I took all the rest of the locks/handles out, grouped them by
key, and handed them to a locksmith.  (Note that I said locksmith,
not key shop.)  Also gave him the ignition key, and said: "Make
them all match this."

Two hours, and $27.50 later, every lock on my 914 matched, and I
had four brand new keys.

If you snag a couple of tumblers from a junk yard, the locksmith
can use the pins to re-pin yours, and play mix and match to get
you the best combination.

I've had the pedal pivot rust and get gunked up with crud on
my '79 914..I mean '79 VW Bus. Once I figured out the problem
and before I fixed it, I would have to reach down and pull back
on the pedal to keep the engine from racing.

I would check linkages in the engine compartment when the engine
is cold.  It appears the heat from the engine loosens things up
after a bit.

Subject: Re: Interference on audio system (& factory oil)

The problem with your audio system is a bad ground. It could be located 
at the deck, or the amps. If the radio is a factory unit, it will most 
likely not be the problem. This type of problem is generally ascociated 
with improperly installed amps. Make sure the amps are grounded to the 
car.... not the doors. As for the cause of the noise:
If it is a ticking noise then it is a spark plug or bad plug boot or wire.
If the noise is an engine speed dependent whirr then it is a bad ground 
on the alternator/generator

All cars make these noises to some extent, but it takes an amplifier to 
make them audible.

I'm pretty familiar with the electronics used in both.  And my
professional opinion is this:  There is absoutely no way that
a celluar telephone could interfere with the ABS system of a car.
 
And even if the ABS system did fail, the car would still stop just
like a car with no ABS.
 
What could happen is that from years of holding an RF transmitter
close to ones head, enough brain tissue has been destroyed that
one could make statements like that.

Just my two cents on the subject:

I changed my "never leaked a drop in its 110,000 miles" 914 over
to synthetic (10W-50) oil, and it started leaking all over.

My guess it that the designers of the engine were counting on the
viscousity (sp?) loss at temperature.......

It could be noisy power.  Checking the ground is a *very* good place
to start.

I've also had very good luck mounting large capacitors near the power
input to the amplifier.  High-end car stereo installers will have the
parts you need to do this.

The fact that the noise does not change with the volume control points
to the amplifier.  If it was the other way around, I'd start with the
control head.


The high currents involved with a car amplifier makes the power
wiring very important.

Some of you have already talk about urban legends.  IMO, this story of cell phone
that cause ABS to fail is a pure fiction.

Of course, I'm not not a radio-physician scientist, but my experience is:
 - I have used for many hours a cell phones in many ABS cars without any pb.
 - There are a lot of more powerful magnetics emissions in a car (CB, sparks,
  alternator, highbeam commuting, ...) that a 5w cell phone (even in those
  frequency range).

But cell phones are dangerous.  When you are talking about something very
important (like a business discussion), you're not paying enough attention to
the road.

Speaking about something important in the heavy traffic of Paris while driving,
using indicators, shifting gear and avoiding this silly pedestrian that is walking
too closest of your car is a real `sport'! (loosing this `sport' is forbidden by
the law)

And my last advice is that if you need ABS to stop, that means that you're not
paying enough attention to the security distance between you and the car in front
of you.

ABS is made to prevent accidents.  In normal commuting, you should never need it.

Beware! The use of the cellular telephone CAN cause problems with
your ABS (or non-ABS) breaking system. This is the effect: You are
using the cellular telecommunications device, talking to your
Futures Broker, trying to get into the 20 year low in porkbellies.
Ahead of you, a hog crosses the road, causing traffic to come to
an abrupt stop. You are unaware of the hog. Because of the cellular
device, you are unaware of the cars ahead of you stopping. Too late,
you notice the bright red lights of the brake lights ahead and you
nail your ABS brakes with both feet on the pedal. Since you were
going about 60 mph and were less than 100 feet from the stopped 
cars, your ABS system "fails" to stop you in time. Thus, the
cellular communications device interferred with the ABS brakes.

Likely different.  My sensor is connected (as I understand it) to a box
under the passenger seat.  Though exactly what it does I have no idea,
since the lambda sensor is only supposed to adjust the mixture a little
bit and the box under my pass seat has like a 32 pin connector.

All this talk of what 911SCs are supposed to do when cold has got
me wondering. Are they supposed to idle high when cold? Mine 
doesn't -- and I don't think it ever did since I've owned it (two years).
As a matter of fact, mine is idling *low* when cold right now, and I have
to push the throttle sometimes to keep it from diving too low and stalling.
Then there's that starting problem I have that I haven't had the time to
mess with.... Now that doesn't sound right, does it?

The mechanics tell me that all the pressures are correct and I have
a relatively new warm-up regulator and fuel distributor (< one year old),
so what does that  leave me? Cold start valve?

    Isn't the East German "Trabant" a 2-stroke car ? Anyone driven

    Seems that in a car, the 2-stroke is cheap simplicity at the cost of
   emmissions and driveability. I don't know if things have changed, but at
   one time only 2-strokers were competitive at motorcycle racing; 4 stroke
   couldn't be made "peaky" enough (!) to compete with the narrow racing
   RPM band needed...if you've ever driven a 2-stroke bike you know there
   really isn't a thing called "smooth throttle response."
    Also Mazda has out a 6-stroke "Miller" engine (in the Millenia),
   Road and Track had an article about it a couple of months ago. If I 
   remember right the extra 2 cycles avoid any of the overlap that 2 or

It is certainly possible. When transmitting on 2m the aftermarket cruise
control in my former VW Golf would freeze with the current throttle setting.
It was on my list to investigate further till the day I sold the car.

This kind of interference is inexcusable because the presence of RF 
transmitters is an unavoidable aspect of modern life. And the problem can
be cured before it happens with proper engineering. Remember the bad old
days when a passing car would cause static on your radio or TV?

The problem is not the presence of RF, but the susceptibility to RF.

Hope the yoot wasn't driving a Porsche, as I'd hope a Porsche driver could
still stop w/o ABS.

The 904 was produced in the early 60's (1964?). It is had a 2 liter flat

Subject: Almost as good as sex....




Well, I just brought home my first Porsche - a 1983 911SC Coupe!
I would like to thank everybody on the net who sent me answers and
support for my postings, including Stan, Bart, Rich, Bruce Anderson
and all the others....great support.

Now for the story.

I had been looking at 1980 - 1986 911's for a while, and had an excel
spreadsheet built up to get an idea of a "good" price. Looked at several
cars, but the later Carrera's where getting pricey. Anyways, I phoned 
a guy who had an ad in the local "Auto Trader" (this is one of several
that I phone ever week) . His wife answered, and
she told me a little about the car, that there was a deal pending on
the car, and she would get him to call back. That was wednesday. I
got busy, and forgot to phone him (remember, I was just looking and not
really ready to buy yet). He phone on Sat morning and asked if I was
still interested. My wife nodded, and we loaded the kids in the Pathfinder
and went to look.

The car is dark metallic charcoal grey with tan interior. Panels and paint
look very straight, and the overall body condition very good (nothing bent,
not ripples under the spare tire, floor under carpets almost new, no
rust anywhere). Leather seats and interior in excellent condition.
 Took it for a spin, and came back with a big grin on my face!! We went inside, 
and he showed me the records for the car. They included:

    - carrera chain tensioner updates
    - recent tranny service included 1st and 2nd syncros, and 1st spider gears
    - full tune up including valves/ignition/all oils 3000 miles ago
    - new clutch 10K miles ago
    - general updates including third brake light, european headlights, and
      trim
    - general service bills back 7 years
    - new tires 
    - always been garaged in the winter
    
He was asking 21K CNd (~14,700US) for the car. It has 95K miles on it.
He explained that he had 2 former deals on the car, but they both fell
through because the people could not get financing (The guys that the 
Canadian banks say "what, you want to spend $20,000 on a 11 year old 
car?") This was Sat lunchtime. I told him he could have a certified
cheque for $18,000 on Monday if the car checks out with a professional
mechanic. We settled at $18,500 ($12950US). He took it. Not sure how
this price is in the States, but this is a pretty good price up here
in Vancouver.

Now, I just happened to know a shop that my friend takes his 76 911S to,
and the shop had a opening at 2:00. I went to the bank to confirm I could
have the bucks sitting on Monday morning, and the owner took it to the
shop. Went down to the shop, and the mechanic had refused to look over
the car until I arrived. We found out that the compression was 175-180
on all pistons, and leakdown was  2% - 6% across all cylinders. Minor
stuff like new front pads, small oil leak on the rear seal on the 
engine, but otherwise it checked out fine. So we had a deal!

Could not sleep Sat, Sun night. Monday morning rolled around, and I 
went down to the local motor vehicle office to see if any liens where
against the car. There was one from one of the guys who had made an 
offer against the car! After some phoning and faxing, I got a discharge
paper from the Bank with the load. We were in the clear!!

Picked up the car on Monday with a one day license (it will be in 
storage in my Garage until March). Started driving. My grin got bigger 
and bigger as the day wore on!!

Almost as good as sex!

Now, the question is, how am I going to last until next March ? :-)

Rudy,

Get your American Express out, because there certainly was a 904.  Peter A.
can no doubt, off the top of his head, give you more information about it
than I could look up.  But basically it was a race car with a four-cylinder
engine, an interim car in the mid-sixties until Porsche had a six-cylinder
engine ready for what was to be called the 906.

As I recall, the 904 had a fibreglass body with some interesting structural
properties.  I think Butzi designed the car.  There are a number of street-
legal 904's and 906's in the US and other countries.  I believe that Betty 
Jo
and Len Turner own one.

Have you checked the clutch fluid level - if you have a slight leak on 
the slave cylinder, you may notice that you cannot de-clutch. An 
indicator here is that pumping the pedal will allow you to get it into gear.

If all is well with the clutch fluid, then the probable cause is a thin 
clutch plate.

It is odd that modern clutches get stiffer as they wear out.

Question - any one out there changed a 944 clutch, how long does it take, 
and what are the usual problems.

ps I'm a brit I assume you call a clutch a clutch.

I have seen this on Porsches and BMW motorcycles. It happens when the 
ring gaps line up on the bottom of the piston. A small amount of oil 
leaks past into the combustion chamber, and the engine smokes on start 
up. 

It was enough of a problem on the watercooled BMW's that they pinned the 
rings in the grooves to keep them from turning.

It's annoying, but not harmful.

Welcome to 911 ownership.  For some reason the windshield seal has a
habit of leaking in the lower right corner directly into the glovebox.
Do right hand drive (UK) models leak on the left or right side?  I think
it has something to do with the seal shrinking over time (German rubber
strikes again).  My first experience was a sharp turn during a heavy
rainstorm... water every where including filling the glovebox.

>Questions:

>1) Is there any PorschePhile recommended way of doing a "do-it-yourself"
    job on this seal?
    NO, replacing the windshield seal is the only alternative unless
    the "Look Mom I did it myself" appearance of windshield sealer
    goo appeals to you.

    Any good windshield shop can replace the seal for you.  Ask around
    your local PCA region for a good shop.  Some do it much better than
    others.

    Use only an original OEM seal which can be purchased from third
    party houses.  Some of the aftermarket seals are junk that require
    considerable effort to install and increase the cost of installation
    plus increase the odds of an installation mishap.  A good fitting
    seal looks good as well as seals good.

>2) Given that the interior of the dashboard is now somewhat damp (possibly
    drenched), is there anything I should do?
    It will dry with no after affects but don't let the leak continue.

>3) Where does the "vent" on the outside middle front of the car just below the
    windshield go?
    That's the fresh air intake which contains a drain to beneath the car.
    If it overflowed, the water would go into the trunk.  Possibly it
    might come into the cabin from under the dash.

Subject: 914 keys


For some reason, Porsche does not like to admit that the locks
are very easy to re-key.

My sister took her 1-year-old porsche to the dealer for a broken
driver's door lock, and they forced her to use a secondary (red)
key for the new lock.

When I bought my 914, it needed three keys, and the passenger door
did not have a key.

Luckily, the front hood and the ignition still used the same key.
So I took all the rest of the locks/handles out, grouped them by
key, and handed them to a locksmith.  (Note that I said locksmith,
not key shop.)  Also gave him the ignition key, and said: "Make
them all match this."

Two hours, and $27.50 later, every lock on my 914 matched, and I
had four brand new keys.

If you snag a couple of tumblers from a junk yard, the locksmith
can use the pins to re-pin yours, and play mix and match to get
you the best combination.

I've had the pedal pivot rust and get gunked up with crud on
my '79 914..I mean '79 VW Bus. Once I figured out the problem
and before I fixed it, I would have to reach down and pull back
on the pedal to keep the engine from racing.

I would check linkages in the engine compartment when the engine
is cold.  It appears the heat from the engine loosens things up
after a bit.

Subject: Re: Interference on audio system (& factory oil)

The problem with your audio system is a bad ground. It could be located 
at the deck, or the amps. If the radio is a factory unit, it will most 
likely not be the problem. This type of problem is generally ascociated 
with improperly installed amps. Make sure the amps are grounded to the 
car.... not the doors. As for the cause of the noise:
If it is a ticking noise then it is a spark plug or bad plug boot or wire.
If the noise is an engine speed dependent whirr then it is a bad ground 
on the alternator/generator

All cars make these noises to some extent, but it takes an amplifier to 
make them audible.

I'm pretty familiar with the electronics used in both.  And my

And even if the ABS system did fail, the car would still stop just

Just my two cents on the subject:

I changed my "never leaked a drop in its 110,000 miles" 914 over
to synthetic (10W-50) oil, and it started leaking all over.

My guess it that the designers of the engine were counting on the
viscousity (sp?) loss at temperature.......

It could be noisy power.  Checking the ground is a *very* good place
to start.

I've also had very good luck mounting large capacitors near the power
input to the amplifier.  High-end car stereo installers will have the
parts you need to do this.

The fact that the noise does not change with the volume control points
to the amplifier.  If it was the other way around, I'd start with the
control head.


The high currents involved with a car amplifier makes the power
wiring very important.

Some of you have already talk about urban legends.  IMO, this story of cell phone
that cause ABS to fail is a pure fiction.

Of course, I'm not not a radio-physician scientist, but my experience is:
 - I have used for many hours a cell phones in many ABS cars without any pb.
 - There are a lot of more powerful magnetics emissions in a car (CB, sparks,
  alternator, highbeam commuting, ...) that a 5w cell phone (even in those
  frequency range).

But cell phones are dangerous.  When you are talking about something very
important (like a business discussion), you're not paying enough attention to
the road.

Speaking about something important in the heavy traffic of Paris while driving,
using indicators, shifting gear and avoiding this silly pedestrian that is walking
too closest of your car is a real `sport'! (loosing this `sport' is forbidden by
the law)

And my last advice is that if you need ABS to stop, that means that you're not
paying enough attention to the security distance between you and the car in front
of you.

ABS is made to prevent accidents.  In normal commuting, you should never need it.

Beware! The use of the cellular telephone CAN cause problems with
your ABS (or non-ABS) breaking system. This is the effect: You are
using the cellular telecommunications device, talking to your
Futures Broker, trying to get into the 20 year low in porkbellies.
Ahead of you, a hog crosses the road, causing traffic to come to
an abrupt stop. You are unaware of the hog. Because of the cellular
device, you are unaware of the cars ahead of you stopping. Too late,
you notice the bright red lights of the brake lights ahead and you
nail your ABS brakes with both feet on the pedal. Since you were
going about 60 mph and were less than 100 feet from the stopped 
cars, your ABS system "fails" to stop you in time. Thus, the
cellular communications device interferred with the ABS brakes.

Walt Disney Co. gave actor Tim Allen his Crhistmas gift a little early

just now arriving in U.S. showrooms.

"We have a policy that anybody who has a No. 1 movie, a No. 1 book and
a No. 1 TV show gets a car," says Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman

Likely different.  My sensor is connected (as I understand it) to a box
under the passenger seat.  Though exactly what it does I have no idea,
since the lambda sensor is only supposed to adjust the mixture a little
bit and the box under my pass seat has like a 32 pin connector.

All this talk of what 911SCs are supposed to do when cold has got
me wondering. Are they supposed to idle high when cold? Mine 
doesn't -- and I don't think it ever did since I've owned it (two years).
As a matter of fact, mine is idling *low* when cold right now, and I have
to push the throttle sometimes to keep it from diving too low and stalling.
Then there's that starting problem I have that I haven't had the time to
mess with.... Now that doesn't sound right, does it?

The mechanics tell me that all the pressures are correct and I have
a relatively new warm-up regulator and fuel distributor (< one year old),
so what does that  leave me? Cold start valve?

     re; 2 stroke cars

    Isn't the East German "Trabant" a 2-stroke car ? Anyone driven  
   a Trabbie ?

    Seems that in a car, the 2-stroke is cheap simplicity at the cost of
   emmissions and driveability. I don't know if things have changed, but at
   one time only 2-strokers were competitive at motorcycle racing; 4 stroke
   couldn't be made "peaky" enough (!) to compete with the narrow racing
   RPM band needed...if you've ever driven a 2-stroke bike you know there
   really isn't a thing called "smooth throttle response."
    Also Mazda has out a 6-stroke "Miller" engine (in the Millenia),
   Road and Track had an article about it a couple of months ago. If I 
   remember right the extra 2 cycles avoid any of the overlap that 2 or
   4 stroke motors have...

It is certainly possible. When transmitting on 2m the aftermarket cruise
control in my former VW Golf would freeze with the current throttle setting.
It was on my list to investigate further till the day I sold the car.

This kind of interference is inexcusable because the presence of RF 
transmitters is an unavoidable aspect of modern life. And the problem can
be cured before it happens with proper engineering. Remember the bad old
days when a passing car would cause static on your radio or TV?

The problem is not the presence of RF, but the susceptibility to RF.

Hope the yoot wasn't driving a Porsche, as I'd hope a Porsche driver could
still stop w/o ABS.

You do...

The 904 was produced in the early 60's (1964?). It is had a 2 liter flat 
four producing 180hp. Top speed 160 mph. I have a picture that I would be

Subject: Almost as good as sex....




Well, I just brought home my first Porsche - a 1983 911SC Coupe!
I would like to thank everybody on the net who sent me answers and
support for my postings, including Stan, Bart, Rich, Bruce Anderson
and all the others....great support.

Now for the story.

I had been looking at 1980 - 1986 911's for a while, and had an excel
spreadsheet built up to get an idea of a "good" price. Looked at several
cars, but the later Carrera's where getting pricey. Anyways, I phoned 
a guy who had an ad in the local "Auto Trader" (this is one of several
that I phone ever week) . His wife answered, and
she told me a little about the car, that there was a deal pending on
the car, and she would get him to call back. That was wednesday. I
got busy, and forgot to phone him (remember, I was just looking and not
really ready to buy yet). He phone on Sat morning and asked if I was
still interested. My wife nodded, and we loaded the kids in the Pathfinder
and went to look.

The car is dark metallic charcoal grey with tan interior. Panels and paint
look very straight, and the overall body condition very good (nothing bent,
not ripples under the spare tire, floor under carpets almost new, no
rust anywhere). Leather seats and interior in excellent condition.
 Took it for a spin, and came back with a big grin on my face!! We went inside, 
and he showed me the records for the car. They included:

    - carrera chain tensioner updates
    - recent tranny service included 1st and 2nd syncros, and 1st spider gears
    - full tune up including valves/ignition/all oils 3000 miles ago
    - new clutch 10K miles ago
    - general updates including third brake light, european headlights, and
      trim
    - general service bills back 7 years
    - new tires 
    - always been garaged in the winter
    
He was asking 21K CNd (~14,700US) for the car. It has 95K miles on it.
He explained that he had 2 former deals on the car, but they both fell
through because the people could not get financing (The guys that the 
Canadian banks say "what, you want to spend $20,000 on a 11 year old 
car?") This was Sat lunchtime. I told him he could have a certified
cheque for $18,000 on Monday if the car checks out with a professional
mechanic. We settled at $18,500 ($12950US). He took it. Not sure how
this price is in the States, but this is a pretty good price up here
in Vancouver.

Now, I just happened to know a shop that my friend takes his 76 911S to,
and the shop had a opening at 2:00. I went to the bank to confirm I could
have the bucks sitting on Monday morning, and the owner took it to the
shop. Went down to the shop, and the mechanic had refused to look over
the car until I arrived. We found out that the compression was 175-180
on all pistons, and leakdown was  2% - 6% across all cylinders. Minor
stuff like new front pads, small oil leak on the rear seal on the 
engine, but otherwise it checked out fine. So we had a deal!

Could not sleep Sat, Sun night. Monday morning rolled around, and I 
went down to the local motor vehicle office to see if any liens where
against the car. There was one from one of the guys who had made an 
offer against the car! After some phoning and faxing, I got a discharge
paper from the Bank with the load. We were in the clear!!

Picked up the car on Monday with a one day license (it will be in 
storage in my Garage until March). Started driving. My grin got bigger 
and bigger as the day wore on!!

Almost as good as sex!

Now, the question is, how am I going to last until next March ? :-)

Rudy,

Get your American Express out, because there certainly was a 904.  Peter A.
can no doubt, off the top of his head, give you more information about it
than I could look up.  But basically it was a race car with a four-cylinder
engine, an interim car in the mid-sixties until Porsche had a six-cylinder
engine ready for what was to be called the 906.

As I recall, the 904 had a fibreglass body with some interesting structural
properties.  I think Butzi designed the car.  There are a number of street-
legal 904's and 906's in the US and other countries.  I believe that Betty 
Jo
and Len Turner own one.

	I remember a discussion on this before, but i accidentally 
deleted them before.  My 944 gets a TON of water in the back seat floor, 
passenger side.  I pulled up the carpet and ran water down the sunroof 
holes, but i saw no leak.  I sat in the car during the rain, but there 
wasn't any coming from the roof, so it must be seeping up from the 
bottom.  Where else can the water come in?  There is literally a puddle 
in the back today.  Please help me

Have you checked the clutch fluid level - if you have a slight leak on 
the slave cylinder, you may notice that you cannot de-clutch. An 
indicator here is that pumping the pedal will allow you to get it into gear.

If all is well with the clutch fluid, then the probable cause is a thin 
clutch plate.

It is odd that modern clutches get stiffer as they wear out.

Question - any one out there changed a 944 clutch, how long does it take, 
and what are the usual problems.

ps I'm a brit I assume you call a clutch a clutch.

60k plus seems to be the range - it probably depends on the sort of

long distance freeway driving is very easy on them

I have seen this on Porsches and BMW motorcycles. It happens when the 
ring gaps line up on the bottom of the piston. A small amount of oil 
leaks past into the combustion chamber, and the engine smokes on start 
up. 

It was enough of a problem on the watercooled BMW's that they pinned the 
rings in the grooves to keep them from turning.

It's annoying, but not harmful.

Welcome to 911 ownership.  For some reason the windshield seal has a
habit of leaking in the lower right corner directly into the glovebox.
Do right hand drive (UK) models leak on the left or right side?  I think
it has something to do with the seal shrinking over time (German rubber
strikes again).  My first experience was a sharp turn during a heavy
rainstorm... water every where including filling the glovebox.

>Questions:

>1) Is there any PorschePhile recommended way of doing a "do-it-yourself"
    job on this seal?
    NO, replacing the windshield seal is the only alternative unless
    the "Look Mom I did it myself" appearance of windshield sealer
    goo appeals to you.

    Any good windshield shop can replace the seal for you.  Ask around
    your local PCA region for a good shop.  Some do it much better than
    others.

    Use only an original OEM seal which can be purchased from third
    party houses.  Some of the aftermarket seals are junk that require
    considerable effort to install and increase the cost of installation
    plus increase the odds of an installation mishap.  A good fitting
    seal looks good as well as seals good.

>2) Given that the interior of the dashboard is now somewhat damp (possibly
    drenched), is there anything I should do?
    It will dry with no after affects but don't let the leak continue.

>3) Where does the "vent" on the outside middle front of the car just below the
    windshield go?
    That's the fresh air intake which contains a drain to beneath the car.
    If it overflowed, the water would go into the trunk.  Possibly it
    might come into the cabin from under the dash.

Experience tells me that one must be careful pulling back on the accelerator
in a 914.  The first time I did this (the day I bought my car) I pulled a
little too hard and the rubber pedal slipped off the ball-end of the linkage
and left me fishing around in a dark footwell for that pesky linkage rod.
Bus pedal assemblies appear much easier to get at.

My car's problem turned out to be a gritty, nasty buildup of dirt and grease
around the pedal assembly, which when the weather got particularly hot,
would bind up the pedal assembly (heat-expansion?), causing it to stick at
around 3/4 throttle.  I suspect extreme cold would cause a similar symptom.
In my case, a thorough cleaning and regreasing solved the problem.

Subject: Re: Smoking 911



Gene,

The puff of oil on startup is a 911 characteristic - nothing
to worry about. Oil leaks are also very common and there are 
about a dozen possible locations. The oil drips down onto the
heat exchangers and makes a big stink. Common areas for leaks
are the oil return tubes and the oil pressure sensor. The other
MAJOR cause of leaks is overfilling. The oil should be checked
with the car fully warmed up (180+) on flat and level ground 
and it's best to keep it on the low side rather than at the 
full mark. If you overfill, the oil will get into the intake
system and some of it will burn (like your symptom) and the
rest will drip out a tube at the bottom, through a rubber gland
between the engine and transmission and onto your driveway.

If you're concerned about rings and valveguides, a leakdown test
($65-$100) will give you a very accurate picture of the condition
of the engine.

It would be unreasonable to expect to be able to install any type of high frequency source inside a modern vehicle with no regard to the impact on other electronic components.  
	If you take the cover off of a computer and put it next to your television, I would expect some interference on the television.  If you put a television inside your computer I would expect problems with both.  The vehicle will act as a shield against emissions from outside the vehicle but if you put transmitters inside the vehicle, even if you put copper plate all around every sensitive component inside the vehicle there will be a limit as to how much immunity you will get.  The more power you transmit, the more will get through.  Also, all the wiring in the vehicle acts as an antennae coupling the noise into power and ground.
	Summary: If you aren't putting out very many watts you probably won't have much of a problem, a lot of watts, some testing would be required.

Well, I know that many cars get stuck throttles in the winter because 
water somehow gets into the throttle cable. Sometimes this will cause an 
immediate stick or it can wait until it gets in the open air and then 
freeze stuck on the road.  Deloreans were the most notorious for this, 
even causing a piece of angled metal to be positioned over the throttle 
linkage to avoid water getting in.  The water freezes in the bottom of 
the cable, holding it in place...

904's were in a class (if i remember right) that required homogolation 
and there were a number of these made in street legal trim.  They were 
interesting cars and must have been fun on the street.

Boy, I didn't realize I was going to be made into such an *authority*.
Thanks, Rudy.

"Streetable" is the operative word.  My list in the FAQ doesn't pretend
to list all of the racing Porsches ever built.  I was trying to keep it
down to those someone might actually buy or drive on normal streets.
If your bet was based on whether there was a 904 of any kind,
streetable or not, then you lose.  If you had any conditions on the bet
about whether 904s were race cars or not, then you have an chance.

Yes, I know there are 904s around that people drive on the street.
However, these are probably special conversions to make them
street-legal.

If we try to extend my list to include *all* P-cars, then we'll have a
*much* longer list.  My resources aren't the best for such an expansion,
but I'm open to submissions.

In any case, I am not paying for dinner.  (Unless you want to come to

			Alarm with remote and kill switch.

			66K miles on the car.

			60K service done 4 months ago.

			All belts done at 42K miles.

			Service records for two years back.

			I am asking $17,500US (obo) for the car.

While I'm very very reluctant to sell it (the car is in excellent

Some of the discussion of "urban legends" lately reminded me of a story 
I heard back in college. If this is an old BTDT topic then I will take 
the abuse I deserve:  

   There was this guy, who knew a guy (these stories never seem to have 
names do they?) who saw an ad in the local paper;  PORSCHE 911 - $1.00  
This "guy" calls the number and talks to a woman who maintains that the 
price in the ad is correct.  The explanation she gives is that it was 
her husband's car, and in a bitter divorce she had been instructed to 
sell off all his assets and give him half of the proceeds.  The "guy" 
realizing that such problems are none of his business, pays the full 
asking price for the car, and drives off smiling into the sunset.  
Presumably he lives happily ever after.... :)

I figure if anyone can elaborate on this story, it would be the members 
of this list.  Does anyone have other P-Car related folklore they would 
like to share?  How about any real-life examples of people buying a 
Porsche way below market value?  Or buying a rare procution version from 
an owner who didn't realize what they had.  It would be fun to see who 
got the best (verifiable) Porsche deal of all time.

Actually, I almost got a 914 for FREE once... it was a '76 1.8,
beautiful midnight blue... I saw the ad in the paper, went to see the
guy, and he said he was moving, had to get rid of the car ASAP,
apparently it was undriveable b/c various mechanical parts had rusted up
(brakes, clutch linkage, etc...)  BUT I could not find a trailer for the
next two days.. the guy told me that I was the first to look at the car,
it was mine, and he refused my offer of cash to hold the car for me
(said it was definitely mine) but the day before I was to pick it up he
called my house and said his brother-in-law had decided he wanted the
car.  Also, I found out from a guy I worked with at the time (who also
went to look at the car) that the motor actually ran (I was told that it
was not running) and was all ready to take the car home (he had a
trailer, I did not know this) until he started talking to the guy and
asked him why I hadn't been there yet (he knew I was a sports car freak
 - the guy told him "oh, yeah, he was here... I told him he could have
the car, but you can take it if you want it."  He left it.)  So I'm
guessing some other random guy has that car now.  Grr.  I woulda tried
to free up the clutch and drive it home if I had known that!  Who needs
brakes anyway... (I live way out in the country.)  This car also
included a set of those "riviera" wheels, new springs, shocks, etc...
still in boxes!  I was heartily pissed.
    But this story has a happy ending... less than two weeks ago, I
brought home my new baby.. a '71 1.7.  Not as nice as the other one, but
it's mine (and it has a cool Monza exhaust..) and for only $800.  So

opportunity for me.  I negotiated a price of $23K, wrote a check, and drove
off with a bill-of-sale in hand.  The dealer told me to come by for the
title in a couple days.

A couple days later I showed up asking for the title, but was told there was
a misprint and it was being sent back for correction.  ... Several tries,
stories and one month later I was finally told the truth:

The car had been listed through the dealership on consignment.  There was a
bank loan on the original owner's side.  Because of the economy, the dealer's
bills had been stacking up, and their landlord was yelling for rent more
than I was yelling for the title.  The dealer then took $9000 from my check
for their rent, and applied what was left to the consigner's loan balance.
And, before I even knew any of this was going on, they filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy.

The full story is longer and more detailed, but that was the meat.  When
everything was exposed:
	I had a car/bill-of-sale/cancelled-check
	The original-owner had a loan balance of $9000 and was defaulting
	The bank had the title and was threatening reposession
	The dealership was broke and filed bankruptcy

Two years later, I'm still trying to milk some money out of the dealership
owners.  The dealership owners are on the verge of filing personal bankruptcy,
so I need to be careful.  I would end up on the bottom of any creditor's
pay-off list (IRS, then banks, then the little guys).  I'm still in a position
to file criminal charges, but ...

Summary:  The dealership had been around for many years.  So, I never thought
much of doing business with them.  I'm still not sure what I would have done
differently.  Motto: BEWARE!

Subject: Motor Mounts 1 - Home Team 0


Hello Fellow Porschephiles;

Well I survived my weekend attempt at replacing the motor mounts on my '89 944 
Turbo, however, the motor mounts won.  Really it was the crossmember that won.  
I could not loosen the two bolts holding the crossmember to the chassis with the  
one 19mm wrench that I currently own.  This seems to require a breaker bar or 
impact wrench.  Luckily, after removing the gravel shield and sway bar I made 
sure I could reach everything with the limited tools I had before proceeding 
further.

After sizing up the job, I have decided to let a professional handle it.  It 
will probably be the best $250 I have ever spent if it cures my vibration 
problems.  Looking up at the motor mount, I still can not figure out how the 
bolts were going to come out the top of the mount.  It did not look like there 
was much clearance up there.  Also, when I tried loosening the nut holding the 
mount to the motor, the nut and bolt turned together.  There is no room for a 
socket, so it would require 2 13mm wrenches, at least one of which must be open 
ended for the nut.

The moral of the story:  you will need more tools other than a socket set and 
one set of wrenches to replace the motor mounts.  On the brighter side, I at 
least got to see parts of my car that I have never seen before 8^).  A man has 
got to know his limitations.  I found mine this weekend with only two skinned 
knuckles!  Happy wrenching.

Clarification. The 906 aka Carerra 6 was the next step in Porsche's racing
effort in the 1960. It was followed by the 908, etc. Thus the 917K "grew"
from the 904 -- or the 550, RSK, RS61, etc.

The 904 was sold as a street legal road car. It HAD to be in order
to meet the FIA's homologation rules. While there were LOTS of race
prepared 904s, it was sold as a passenger car. There may have been
a "racing" version sold as well. Check the enthusiast press of the
day and you'll even find the odd road test. Check the period for sale
ads and you'll find very street 904s being offered.

Subject: Old Engine

Due to a wierd series of events, I need to have the engine dropped in my 911
this winter.  Being low on time and skill, I'll be taking it to a mechanic
who's done great stuff for me.

The car is a high-milage '78 911SC, about 140K miles.  Since the engine is
going to be dropped anyway, I thought a leak-down test might be in order.  As
this is all happening tomorrow, I'm getting nervous -- right, like my kid is
having an operation or something.

Anyway, if the car should fail the test (>8%, right?) and Mr. Mechanic gets
that my-kids-are-gonna-get-braces-after-all look in his eyes, what are the
natural things that I'll want to have done?  I've heard all of the following:
1) "Rebuild the whole darn thing.  You'll just be putting it off if you only
do the top-end."
2) "Just new valves and seals, the bottom-end on that thing is bullet-proof."
3) "Valves, seals and new mains. You'll just be ..."
4) "Never, ever put new rings on old pistons.  It'll leak like a sieve."

Perhaps a little background is in order.  I bought the car a little over two
years ago, with about 125K on it.  It was a competent daily driver until I
moved to the Great White North a year ago.  I think the engine has been apart
(nonstandard gaskets), but all of the previous owners swear they didn't do
it.  Up to a point, the car uses less oil the more it is driven.  Bad
ring/cylinder seal?  I don't think any of the prior owners ever flogged the
car, if that matters.

I appreciate any and all opinions on the above.

Much thanks,
Tim Krone

You may want to check your "auxiliary air device".  This thing
permits more air into the engine when cold to increase the idle a bit.  This
thing may not be opening up during your cold idle

Subject: oil filters

I just bought 4 oil filters from Zims for the 928. These are Mann
filters. The previous filters I bought from them were Mahle.

Dwight Mitchell, at a Warbonnet tech session a few years ago, said that
an oil filter bought at a discount store, an auto parts store, and the
Porsche dealer, even with the same manufacturer and part number are not
always the same quality.

So with this in mind, I compared the Mann oil filter with the Mahle. And
guess what, they are different internally. The Mahle has a (I'm going to
get technical now :) ) springy thing at the mounting threads, the Mann
does not. However, the Mann has something similar mounted at the closed
end of the filter. This does not appear to be a check valve, although it
may be.

The Mahle looks like a better quality: sealed package, better black
glossy finish, and a better looking springy thing. Is the Mann a good
filter? And what brand does Porsche use for the 928, the dealer did not
know.

Don't do it!!!  At least not the fiberglass ones....

Steel parts welded by a competant shop are good....but
I've seen the fiberglass out there...don't do it!

If you go with fiberglass, think of your nice Carrera like
this:

Strong metal unibody construction with good engine,
trans, suspension, etc all covered by wavy, ill-fitting
fiberglass brutally "formed" to fit on your car and smoothed
with a few gallons of bondo to give the appearance of
a solid car.

Here is some of the specs info you asked for:

944          89         162/166 (2.7 liter)     2866

The 924S uses the same motor/transaxle/gearing as the 944 less 110 lbs.
But there is a considerable difference in wheel widths as the 924s is
limited to 15-6/15-7 F/R and the 944 has 15-7 F/R.  The later 944's had
a 16-7/16-8 wheel option. I think the 944 suspension is better and the
924S 6 inch front wheel width is a disadvantage.  There were various
spring rate/sway bar options over these years.  Documentation is critical!

BTW, Franklin Wong's '88 car is an option package that includes the M030
suspension and deletes some of the heavy options. I'm curious what it
weighs.

Yep, could be.

The pads lasting 24K miles is not too far from normal.

I would wonder about the rotors, though.  If you are not getting any
indication of warpage, and there is not a significant amount of wear
(indicated by a lip towards the outer edge of the rotor) you could probably
skate by this time.

Actually, front rotors are not all that expensive (on the order of $60 each)
and are a better deal than machining them if they are worn, if only that
they do dissipate the heat better when they are full thickness.

So, you spend your money and you takes your chances...  After all, you are
driving a PORSCHE!!!

Hi, Gregory,

Usual readings with Castrol GTX 20W50 on a warm day (80 degrees ambient)
range from 2 bar (about 30 lbs/sq in) at idle to 5 bar (about 70 lbs/sq in)
at 5000 rpm, with the engine not being too hot.

After a 20 minute run at Lime Rock Park, at 5000 rpm, the pressure can get
as low as 3 bar with apparently no ill effects.

On a cold day (20 degrees F ambient) the needle will peg at 5 bar at idle
until it starts to warm up.

Of course, YMMV...

    Racing.  Their number is 805 385 7191.  They are quite pricey, but 
    works of art compared to Weltmeister or H&H.  They are fully adjustable 
    tubular bars with bearing rod ends and adjustable drop links.  If you 
    add the adjustable drop links to the Weltmeister bar, they are almost 
    price competitive.
    
    I purchased a "Charlie bar" for my 914 and was sorry I had to mount it 
    in the car.  It was beautiful.  It works great.
    
    Jon

My '81 Targa was doing the same thing.  At first I thought the
leak was at the rear of the "deflector" window.  On closer
examination I thought (but wasn't sure) that it was a little
further forward than that.  When that area is already wet it is
hard to tell.  One day a couple of weeks ago I took the top off
and began looking at all of the seals closely for wear, since it
should have worked properly at one time.  I found the problem.
The side seals on the targa top have an end cap glued on the front
(the end that points at the front of the car).  The glue holding
the bottom part down has lost its grip and allows the bottom part
of the rubber cap to roll up when the top is attached.  This leaves
a hole for the water to enter.  My temporary fix was to bend the
rolled up ends of the cap back down into place and reattach the top.
It hasn't leaked again.

My girlfriends '81 911 has  a leaky windshield.

I was going to run a thin bead of silicone sealer (like for basin-

Went to the hardware store and they had:  *silicone windshield
sealant*.

Now I'm planning a thin bead of this.

Will post results when available, probably next week.

You have to cut the sheet metal to install the front Weltmeister bar.

I have them on my '80 911 (22mm front and rear).  If I could do it over, 
I'd do what we did to my girlfriend's car:  22mm front sport bar from 
a 3.2 and a 19mm weltmeister adjustable in the rear.

I wasn't really excited about the weltmeister rear bar, but it was 
fairly cheap (both ways...) is easy to adjust but kind of a hassle to 
get set up initially: the drop link length adjustment is stupid.

Functionally they work okay.  The front bar is noisy.

I don't know about the H&H.  I sure be looking into it first if I were 
you!

Subject: Targa Top Leaks

For the gentleman who was concerned about his top leaking: sorry, my
experience (two Targas) is that they are going to leak sooner or later
(usually sooner), and always at the front corners. I think the latches lose
some of their strength over time and body flex leads to leaks. You can
replace seals, latches, etc., but you are getting into some noticeable $$ for
what is probably a short term fix. I find it more practical to just carry a
towel in the car.

    Well, it's me agian.. the guy who's restoring that really trashy '71

(before the front end was brutally removed) apparently had a fiberglass
conversion instead of a bumper... but what I have to put the car back
together is and old steel bumper, looks like a '72-'73 (? - you know,
the one like the '71, only with the rubber pads - which will go bye bye
soon) but alas, the fog light grilles are missing, and the one fog that
I do have is in a box (with a cracked lens! grr!)  I have several
questions - first, how were they wired into the car?  My owner's manual
and Haynes manual show nothing about the fogs at all, and there is no
switch on the dash.  Are they wired into the parking lights or
something?  Also, does anyone know where I could get new lights to fill
those gaping space in my bumper?  Apparently Hella doesn't make them
anymore and the cheapest price I've found is $75 apiece for used ones. 
Is there another light that will fit in the same space?  Anyone know
where I could get just a lens for the one I have?
    Please keep in mind that I am a poor college student and don't

We've already beat the "yes Virginia there is a 904" to death, but on
that "streetable" thing: the 904 in rawest possible form is *NOT* streetable
by modern standards even though it was sold as a "road car" to meet FIA

My first sports car was a 1960 Bugeye Sprite that I bought for $150 in
1973.  I began by rebuilding the tranny, and eventually turned it into a
autocross/hillclimb racer (but street legal, natch :-).  
I bought a wrecked late-model MG Midget from a junkyard and used its big
1275cc motor and front disk brakes, also installed 1.5" SU's, 6"-wide
sticky racing tires (bought cheap used from formula ford racers), and
sway bars.  With 5.38 rear gears (from Morris delivery truck), top speed
was about 55mph at 7000 rpm in 4th, but boy did it go like stink around
the tight turns!

I learned a lot of tricks from a friend who raced an HP Bugeye in SCCA.
I used to go over to his shop several evenings a week my last year in
high school, and helped in the pit several times at Laguna Seca and
Sears Point.

                           (&embarassing?)

One of my most memorable experiences was late one night, out in
my dirt-floor garage, standing and chatting with some friends.
The car was up on jackstands with the wheels off. The jackstands were placed
on pieces of plywood, which were in turn on the dirt floor.
I was sipping a beer and leaned back against the car. The car
shifted sideways and fell off the jackstands. After I recovered from
the shock, I realized that I was ok, but I heard a glug-glug-glug
sound and smelled gas. The car had fallen on top of one of the jackstands
that was now on its side, and which had punched a hole in the gas tank.
Fortunately the garage was separate from the house, and didn't have
any appliances with open flames.

I let things stand as they were for a few days to air out, and then
began visiting various welding and radiator shops trying to find someone
who was willing to weld my gas tank.  All were very leery, and told me
how hard it is to be sure that all the gas is out of the tank (and
seams) before welding. Finally a radiator shop took on the job.  
I think they filled it with water before starting.

The Motronic system on the 3.2 is not equipped with the hardware or 
software to accomodate a knock sensor. It is the same generation of 
hardware as used on the 951, which required a seperate ECU for knock 
control and boost control.

The 944S, S2, and 964 all used a later Motronic which included knock 
sensing and sequential injection. A conversion would be possible, but 
costly. And probably not worth the money.

Most of the aftermarket systems, such as Electromotive TEC are equipped 
to use a knock sensor, but unless you are making major changes to the 
engine, I never saw any dyno results that would motivate me to change.

David,

Run away as fast as you can from this motor!!  You should be able to find
a used 3.0 (with ~100,000 miles) with leakdown numbers of less than 10% on
all cylinders for around $4000 U.S.  A similar 3.2 would cost around $5000

Dear P-Philes,

Remember me? I published a message about a pre-purchase inspection that missed
some MAJOR structural damage. Today I received the following in the mail:

"Dear Mr. Lamers

	This Law firm represents <Porsche Dealer>. Our client 
has advised that you are responsible for certain disparaging
statements published on the Internet regarding a pre-purchase
inspection of a Porsche automobile. These disparaging remarks
are false and without justification and have injured our client's
business reputation.

	On behalf of our client, I hereby demand that you 
immediately cease such disparagement through the Internet or any
other means whatsoever. If you fail to do so, I hereby reserve
all rights against you on behalf of our client.

			Very truly yours,

			<some lawyer type>"

So? What to do. It seems that making such statements as "this dealer gave me
bad service" is probably illegal. Therefore I make the following statement:

"<Porsche Dealer>'s pre-purchase inspection was flawless and in every regard
professional. I would highly recommend anyone who wishes to get a first
rate pre-purchase inspection to go to <Porsche Dealer> especially if it is
believed that the car you are looking at is:

1) badly bent
2) has been wrecked in the past
3) has had questionable work done to it
4) has misaligned body panels, doors and a damaged steering rack"

P-Philes beware:

1) if you have had bad work done for you don't mention names (in restrospect this
   was REALLY stupid of me. I keep forgetting this is the USA.)
2) probably you will have to refrain from mentioning that you had bad work
   done for you at all (you wouldn't want people to know the truth, would you?)
3) censorship rules
4) they have more money to pay for lawyers than you do.

Is this a great country or what?

So!? What do you all think about this? Was I in the wrong in reporting a
potentially disasterous pre-purchase inspection?  

I wonder if this message will come back to haunt me.

I had a '67 VW bus, that I put a considerable amount of $$ into, new paint,
motor, trans, interior, etc.

I had a leaking oil cooler seal, so I was gonna yank the motor and fix it,
no problem, I've done it a dozen or so times before.  So I have a buddy 
of mine over and he's gonna help, hang out, what not.

This is last November last year, and its kinda ucky outside, so we're
doing this in my garage.

So I have everything almost ready to go, so I crawl under to pull the gas
line off, and the line, which is in multiple sections, come apart at the
wrong section.  The gas (full tank, of course!) comes pouring down and hits
my shop light - the light bulb type.  Instant flames.  

It was obvious within a few seconds that I wasn't going to put htis out, so
I have to get the bus out of the garage.  Well, chris parked his car in
FRONT of the bus, and locked it, so he has to go get his keys.  

I went to the front door to go inside, but my SO has this fetish with locking
it, so I can't get in, so I have to go back into the garage, thru the flames,
to get inside.

I run in, call the FD, get my SO out of the shower, and go and open up the 
door betwixt the house and garage.  BIG MISTAKE!  Smoke comes billowing into 
the HOUSE!

Close the door, go aroound the outside, and pull the flaming bus out, where
it rolls down the driveway into the street.  On the way down the driveway,
the back two tires blew out - LOUDLY!

If they had gone while it was inside, I'd have never gotten it out.

So there wasn't much I could do but stand there and watch it burn in front 
of my house.  It burned all the way to the front doors.

I was s'posed to have gone surfing that day, but the oil leak held me back,
but I had both boards, wetsuits, ice chest, beach stuf, blankets, warm
gear and all inside the bus.

Now to make it even more embarassing, I was a fireman for 6 years, and if 
anyone should have "known better."  Shit happens I guess, but I got a load
a shit from a friend of ours who is a Captain in the battalion we are within.

I had just painted this puppy 1 month prior.

I also get grief 'cause I'd reconstructed the fairings and repainted a
friend of mines crotch rocket earlier in the summer, and one week later
he laid it down - but good!  It seems anything I touched would be destroyed.

So thats my story.

No. Falsely claiming that someone  provided bad service, or that they

about them on account of the bad service they provided may all get you in hot
water. Factually reporting that someone did in fact give you bad service
and that you are unhappy as a result is completely OK. If anyone is

can sue them for significant damages for all sort of pain and suffering
induced by them fucking with you in the first place (of course, my
lawyer gets paid a lot more to put that a lot more elegantly...) And you'll
usually settle for a significant fraction of the damages asked, provided you

Like I said, if youre careful in what you say, you're fine. If you're a 
flaming asshole like so many of the USENET crowd, then you probably
deserve the legal notice anyway. I did not observe that to be true in
this case.

No. In fact, if you have a friend that's a lawyer who might be willing to
do this pro bono (that's lawyer talk for "free"), I'd be REALLY inclined
to send these jerkwads (that's a moral judgement) a nastygram back suggesting
that you might feel inclined to publish the facts in this case in the 
local PCA rag or the NY Times or something should they be inclined to 
press their action, and on receipt of their quitclaim over this incident
you'll be happy to send a reciprocal stating that you'll take no such
action over this particular incident, but they might want to agregate
their fecal matter (get their shit together) before you come in NEXT TIME.

But then, I hate people that think they can push me around, and enjoy
making them see the error of their ways...

I haven't heard of *any* business that has actually tried to collect 
damages for having their reputation smeared on the net... and i've seen 
some wicked flames against major computer manufacturers ("XYZ's 
motherboards are total pieces of crap, and anyone who buys from them has 
a hole in their head..")  

I don't think a dealer can suppress your posts;   I remember several 
years ago that a man in NY was totally fed up with a cadillac he bought 
from a dealer who wasn't being all that accomodating. (dozens of trips 
back to the dealer, only to get shitty 
service, etc..)    He posted a full-page ad in the NY Times stating his 
displeasure... Sweet revenge & i don't think he got in any trouble for 
doing it.

If this dealer actually takes you to court, it's likely they really do 
have something to hide.

David,

We wish 4000 of our dollars equalled $5400 US, but I think you applied the
exchange rate the wrong way (it sure would make those bills from Stoddard
look better!). $4000 CDN is about $3000 US. It makes a big difference in
price so it could be very important in regards to the advice you get about
the motor.

I heard that Volvo advises (european??) users of their cars not to use
GSM phones in their cars as they have been known (?) to set off the
airbag as well as possible interference with other (ABS?) electronic systems?

I expect that this is due to the characteristics of GSM (higher power,
shorter bursts?) - this is not used in the US I believe.

I repeat my assertion 

oil WILL nack a cat in no time

How many yams ever make 10k miles - let alone 150k

I know that is a slight exageration, but by and large bikes are worn out 
at comparatively low mileage, so cat failure at 20k miles is not a big issue.

It is also much easier to replace a bike cat than a porsche cat.

Christian,

I would second Jon's opinion of the Charlie Bars.  They appear to be
very well thought out, and well made, parts.  The shop I hand around
has put them on a number of customer cars, and so far so good.  They
are pretty to look at, but that's neither here nor there.

I disagree with people who say terribly negative things about the
Weltmeister bars.  I think they are a fine part, and are a very
good value for the money.  Almost all of the "problems" I have seen
with Weltmeister bars are a result of people not installing them
properly, as explained in the instructions.

In particular, with *any* heim joint, you have to install it indexed
so that the load vector is along the heim joint's long axis.  When
you don't do this, you stand a pretty good chance of snapping the
heim joint.  Ditto for the dutchman clamps on the bars, etc.

Hi, Matthew,

$250 per rotor is *WAY* out of line.  You should expect to pay $60 per side.

Even Europroducts (the PCNA knockoff parts) list the rotor (part number
944.351.041.05) for $78.75...

Definitely not $250.

For that kind of money, ship me your car, and I will install the rotors and

I recently fitted new disks (rotors) on my 944 - it took around 40 mins 
to do both sides the disks cost me around 80 uk pounds (120 dollars)

the old disks had done 80k miles and were worn paper thin - they clearly

I don't consider myself a computer "expert", but I do have a computer
engineering degree and have been writing software for a long time (if
anybody had a radio shack color computer and bought 'Megapede' or 'Cuber',
those were mine).

  Anyway, I don't see any way that the virus, as explained in the previous
messages, could work.  Data is data.  It does not run itself.  When you
are reading mail or any text, your computer is running a program which
is reading a file and assuming that it is ascii that should be put on
your screen area.  If it had the ability to transfer execution to that
file, that would be stupid, and this virus would be the least of your
problems.  Not to mention that such a virus scheme would only work for
that particular platform.  The other way for a file to get run is to be
loaded in an area which would normally contain interrupt vectors (program
segments which are run in the event of a hardware signal sent to the CPU).
Again, if your mail program would allow data to be loaded in these areas,
you have much bigger problems than this virus.

If people are really losing their disks, something different must be
happening, and you know how rumors get spread and become completely
different from the original story.

Subject: Porsche diesel tractor

 
The one-cylinder Porsche diesel is the least desirable of the lot. I forget
how many cylinders they go up to (3? 4?) They're not at all rare in Europe,
I have seen them working small farms. In 1991 I visited the Mazda R&D center
in Germany, on the corner of Hiroshimastrasse in whatever town they're in
(near Cologne?) there was a used car dealer with 2 Porsche tractors on the
lot.
 
I have a better story than that. When I got my '84 Carrera, I noticed that
there was a tiny town in Switzerland named Carrera, up a dead end mountain
road, hardly more than a cowpath really. It's in the tiny part of
Switzerland that speaks the fourth language (besides German, French, and
Italian) -- Raetoromanisch. So I felt obligated to load up the girlfriend and
drive up there and shoot the car in front of the town sign. While doing this,
I noticed one of the local rustics taking an interest in the proceedings. He
had probably noticed Porsches parking in front of his farm for years and
didn't know why, so I felt he was finally due an explanation. "My car is a
Carrera, just like the name of your town." A few seconds pause. "Ach SO!"
Then I looked over his shoulder, and peeking out of his barn was a
Porsche diesel tractor. This was just too perfect. "I see that you are a
Porsche driver too." There was again a pause of a few seconds, THE FARMER
TURNS AROUND TO LOOK AT HIS BARN, turns back, pauses again, and says "Ach
so!"
 
I forget the altitude of Carrera, but it and inbreeding probably have had a
measurable effect.

What you were accused of by the dealer's lawyer
was libel. Libel can be proven only when the
statements you made can be proven to be 1. false,
and 2. malicious.  If your statements are true,
you have nothing to worry about, except the fact
that the dealer has lawyers, money, and more money.

Sometimes it is best to make statements like
"<dealer> sold me a car that had hidden structural
damage, and this was not revealed at the time of
purchase. " Notice there is no editorializing

| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax. 

CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your
computer. 

This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header. 
They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
sense of credibility to the alert message. 

There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
 He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
message).  This person then spread his alert. 

As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
 But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert. 

If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

Tell that lame legal dufuss that bad severice is bad service (call a spade a

course provide the very best service.  A lawyer can't cover it up nor can the 
courts keep the the rest of us from practicing the first amendment.

Content-Length: 1988      

Dear P-Philes,

Remember me? I published a message about a pre-purchase inspection that missed
some MAJOR structural damage. Today I received the following in the mail:

"Dear Mr. Lamers

	This Law firm represents <Porsche Dealer>. Our client 
has advised that you are responsible for certain disparaging
statements published on the Internet regarding a pre-purchase
inspection of a Porsche automobile. These disparaging remarks
are false and without justification and have injured our client's
business reputation.

	On behalf of our client, I hereby demand that you 
immediately cease such disparagement through the Internet or any
other means whatsoever. If you fail to do so, I hereby reserve
all rights against you on behalf of our client.

			Very truly yours,

			<some lawyer type>"

So? What to do. It seems that making such statements as "this dealer gave me
bad service" is probably illegal. Therefore I make the following statement:

"<Porsche Dealer>'s pre-purchase inspection was flawless and in every regard
professional. I would highly recommend anyone who wishes to get a first
rate pre-purchase inspection to go to <Porsche Dealer> especially if it is
believed that the car you are looking at is:

1) badly bent
2) has been wrecked in the past
3) has had questionable work done to it
4) has misaligned body panels, doors and a damaged steering rack"

P-Philes beware:

1) if you have had bad work done for you don't mention names (in restrospect 
this
   was REALLY stupid of me. I keep forgetting this is the USA.)
2) probably you will have to refrain from mentioning that you had bad work
   done for you at all (you wouldn't want people to know the truth, would you?)
3) censorship rules
4) they have more money to pay for lawyers than you do.

Is this a great country or what?

So!? What do you all think about this? Was I in the wrong in reporting a
potentially disasterous pre-purchase inspection?  

I wonder if this message will come back to haunt me.

Back in '74, I was the Project Engineer on a large construction job outside
Beckley, WV (where, I have learned, thanks to Chuck Smith of Woodbridge, VA, 
that in addition to snow days, ringworm days have also been built into the 
school system).  I had recently acquired a (then) new Kawasaki Z1b (903cc, 84 
bhp) and an even newer Bride (who was still in the process of training her
replacement as the Budget Officer for the Maryland District Court system, and 
had not yet moved down to live with me).

'Twas a foine, sunny day (whack) er, It was a fine, sunny Saturday and I decided
to take Dora out to the job and show her what a big-shot I was, etc.  We rode
out to the site, and discovered a padlocked chain blocking the road into the 
site.  Just as we were about to turn around and go back, I spotted a narrow
opening between the fence and the chain-post.

The opening was just wide enough to squeeze the scooter thru, if I turned the
handlebars and "wiggled" the beastie thru.  Soooo, I told Dora to get off and
walk thru after I got in.  She got off on the left side, tipping the scooter
to the right.  Well, no Problem, right?  Just put the right foot down and 
steady the bike, right?

Ooops...Unbeknownst to me, the leg of my jeans had covered the kick-starter,
pinning my leg to the footpeg.  Timmmm-beeerrrr! (crunch) (ouch!)

It seemed to take forever for that motorscooter to fall majestically over on
its right side, pinning my right foot under the engine case in the process,
with me still seated on the seat.  If you haven't tried this, trust me, it's a
great way to look stooopid!

I couldn't move until Dora rescued me by pulling up on the handlebar enough
for me to pull my right foot out.  We righted the scooter and made the
grand tour and returned uneventfully.  The next day, the pain seemed a bit
persistent, so I had a doc look at it, and discovered that I had broken the
ends off of 3 metatarsals.  The embarassment of the previous day's ignominy
was *much* more painful...

Cheers,

Alas, over the last many years a number of "smart" mail programs
and psuedo-standards (this MIME bullshit comes to mind) have evolved
to "support true multimedia mail" so that your message can contain
text, sound, live graphics from program execution, etc. If you're
unfortunate enough to believe this is a Good Thing, and are running
on some DOS derivative, you are wide open to anything that someone
clever enough to package correctly might care to send you.

While I hate to see this sort of "danger! danger, will robinson!"
messages, there is a call for it.

I just happen to have the records from the last two rotor replacements in my

The first was 9/91 @ 75k.
The rotors were $104.33 each and the pads were $138.12 for the pair.

The next was 5/93 @ 104k
The rotors were $98.90 each and the pads were $127.90 for the pair.

29K between replacments. Both done at the same dealer (so I don't think you 
should see any higher part cost).

Subject: Expanded list of Porsche models

OK, the flap about 904s caused me to dig out a reference work with
model numbers for additional Porsche-related models.  This will
probably make it into the FAQ eventually, but it needs work.  I've
included here cars designed by Ferdinand Porsche before and during WWII
or by the Porsche factory after WWII.  I've only included complete
cars; the factory assigned model numbers in the sequence to engines,
transmissions, brakes, etc., as well, but I left them out.  (I've also
not included the cars in the current FAQ list.)

Corrections, additions, etc., are needed, particularly post-1983, the
publication date of the book I used (Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide,
by Dean Batchelor, Motorbooks International).  Here's the list:

       7  - Wanderer passenger car design, 1930.

     205  - 180-ton tank Maus, 1942.
     245  - 18-ton multipurpose tank, 1942.
     323  - 11-hp diesel tractor, 1946.
     360  - Cisitalia 4-wheel-drive Grand Prix car, 1947-1948.

I say no. However, since this is the litigation society we live in,
one way to avoid the tracks in the electronic sand, is to post a
report of a "pre-purchase experience of note" - or some such wording,
and encourage any interested parties wishing to know more, to contact
you directly. In this vague and innocuous way, the dealership's name
could certainly be mentioned.

As a general comment, it is truly sad that we have allowed the legal
system to take control of our lives, right down to what we say. The
guy with the most money to pay his lawyers will almost always win,
and the definition of winning too often has nothing to do with the
truth.

tires  between  75  and normal (100?).  You can have up  to  four

Hi, Stan.
 
I think most people with a "streetable" 904 have put the original 4-cam
four-cylinder Carrera engine away, as it's worth 30K and up, and put in a
cheaper, "disposable" 911 engine.
 
While in Germany, there was a red 904 with Ludwigsburg license plates that
appeared regularly at Porsche's repair shops for routine service. I learned
later that it was owned and driven regularly by Eberhard Schulz, the former
Porsche styling employee who went off on his own to found Isdera and make
mainly Mercedes-based exotics. It could be seen on the road every now and
then. I think he had a six in it.

Subject: Street-Driven Porsche Racing Cars


I've seen the thread about 904s passing by. They can definately be licensed
and driven on the street. I drove one cross-country 20 years ago to help 
a friend, from Brumos in Jacksonville, Florida to San francisco. It was
a trip from hell. 

The 904 does not have flow through ventilation, further, a stock, unrestored
one has abysmal door sealing. The four days it took to get to california
covered, floods, heat wave, desert, fan belt breakage, a flood in the car
and electrical failure. FINDING parts for the car in Bum Screw, New Mexico
was a bitch. 

Harvey Smith had one, his was a little better.

Anyway, all of the sports/GT racers built by Porsche up to the 906 model
were certified for highway use in both Europe and the US. This includes:
550 and 550A Spyder (ask James Dean), the 718 RSK, RS-60, RS-61, 904, 906
and all 356 4-cam varients including the Abarth Carrera. In 1965-66 the FIA
issued rules that allowed for strictly race cars, but equipped with all 
street equipment, lights, wipers, etc. The true GT class later inspired 
the R, RS, RSR type racing cars which were derived a little from production 
cars. Some were streetable.

There is a 917 (maybe a couple of others) that was licensed in Alabama
and driven in Germany. There were many stories about this car. Anyway,
judging from the Hot-rods I've seen, you could get a 917 or 962 licensed 
as specially constructed vehicles as the LeMans coupes had all street 
equipment installed (the rules require this).

Text item: 

'Twas the Night Before Christmas' as written by a technical writer for a 
firm that does Gov't contracting...
     
                  'Twas The Night Before Christmas
     
'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the 
annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, 
kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this 
potential, including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus
musculus. Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among 
whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St.  Nicholas.
     
The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source 
thereof.
     
Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing 
this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance 
without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline 
precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian 
itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to 
behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight 
diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, 
aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly 
apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his 
ungulate motive power travelling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated 
loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and 
addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen - "Now
Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior 
level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the 
concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.
     
As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost 
celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He 
was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from 
oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls 
thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the 
plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious 
cloth receptacle.
     
His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry.  His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so 
much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment 
appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.
     
Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey 
fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive
of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was 
high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region 
undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical 
container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, 
multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly 
frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly 
lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to 
one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.
     
Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned 
appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise 
extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth 
receptacle.  Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, 
placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, 
inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith 
effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then 
propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical 
expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered 
quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto 
observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I 
overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation
beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary 
constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a 
salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and 
dawn."

you should take your story to your State Legislature and try to get a law passed.

My opinion is,  if they shank it, you have the right to bitch 
about it.  Are they going to go into your home and wash your mouth out
with 20W50 if you mention their crappy job to your friends, or if you
mention it on the street?  I would think not.  So why should they
muzzle you in this forum?

Personnally, I'd have gone right down there and had a chat with them 
myself.  I think they're trying to bully you into a retraction.  Its
not like you said anything that wasn't true;  now if you'd said something 
like "<dealer> and his lawyer are a bunch of hetrosexual competent 
mechanics/lawers" then they could get you on the false statement stuff.

Immediately following, I'd have posted a message re-stating the earlier 
claim, to every list i coudl think of, and mentioning the lawyer joke,
to every list I was on.

If more people did this, and defended our (in the US) right to free
speech, we would have a lot fewer of these pesky lawyer problems.  I realise
that lawyers have to eat too.. wait, hold on... Hey! there went an
ambulance!  Get 'im boys!

Subject: Colorful (i.e. Painful) experiences


While not too physically painful, this was truly embarassing (Even to 
this day).  The only Good thing was it was My SUBARU.

A few years ago while in grad school, I did some automotive work that 
eventually cost me a transmission.  This is a good lesson in recognition 
of profound sleep deprivation.

The story.

Every year in Undergrad, a group of my friends and I would go to the 
Bahamas for spring break.  Now erase those visions of cruise ships and 
little umbrellas, We did it the hard way, bare boat charter.  Not even 
good bare boat charter, cheap bare boat charter.  This involved leaving 
Raleigh NC about 10 PM Friday, driving all night, arrive Dania Fl 
Saturday noon, buy food, beer etc. get on the boats, leave Sat night, 
sail across the Gulf Stream, Fix boats, have a big week and come home.

Being one that refuses to grow up, I figured I would do it again during 
grad school, this time with my then new SO (now wife).  Well, the 
challanging schedule for school in second semester of engineering grad 
school left me with about 11 hours of sleep for the preceeding week, and 
thursday, I realized I REALLY need to change my oil.  So in between 
finishing a computer program, and studying for a midterm (Robot dynamic 
matricies) I changed the oil.  I drained the oil, and noted the oil 
wasn't as dirty as I expected it to be, I also didn't remember the oil 
plug being that big, oh well so much for my memory.  Then added the usual 4 
QTS of 20W50 and went on to study.  

The next day I drove to the store, and noticed a funny sound in the 
engine, then a bit of a wirrrr in the Tranmission.  Suddenly, a very 
clear vision of disaster flashed in my mind.  I slammed on the brakes in 
the middle of the road, stopped the engine, jumped out of the car and 
checke the oil.  YUUUPPPP.  Dunderhead. HMHIS  Read 4QTS over full.  My 
supposition (later confirmed) was that I would find my TRANSMISSION 
rather depleated of fluid.

I went very slowly home and cleaned up my mess.  Drained the engine, 
really changed the oil, Put fluid back in the transmission.  The car 
drove OK, made a bit of a whine in 5th, but not bad.  The car made the 
trip to FL and back, but was never quite the same.  About 3 years after, 
the transmission experienced catastrophic failure at 80K miles, due 
mainly to this misshap. 

Oh Yeah, the Trip that year was a really rough one too, Hit a storm that  
put us out in the Stream for about two days.  Very ugly.  At the end of 
the trip, I added up my sleep for the 2 weeks, and with all the midterms, 
projects, programs before the trip and 2 all night drives, 2 all night 
crossings, bad storm and a few late boat parties, I averaged about 3 
hours of sleep a night.  Makes me hurt just to remember it.

Thanks George for your input.  I think I will try to replace them myself.  
Since my current shop is not quite satisfactory, I would like some suggestions 
for a shop in the San Jose/Campbell area of California.  The shop should be 
very familiar with 944s and the 944S in particular.  Thanks in advance.

Howdy,

I am seriously thinking about getting a 1987 928s4; only year I can afford.
Can some 928s4 owners elaborate on this subject? Any pros and cons and the
things to look out for. I am new to watercooled Porsche, I've owned 911 and
912s.
Are there any half-way decent shop around Chicago area to do pre-purchase
inspection?

Many thanks

Mike,
I have an 82SC with the single control levers.  My owners manual shows
both options.  I don't have the manual with me but I think there is
a difference depending on wether you have A/C or not.  I have A/C
and three levers.  The top one controls fresh air fan speed, the second
one controls where the fresh air goes (up or down) and the bottom one
controls where the hot air goes (up or down).  I have two heater
control levers between the seats.

THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND  
  
In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests  
about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply  
by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received:   
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |  
|                                                                           |  
|  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |  
| America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called "Good    |  
| Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |  
| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message  
originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university  
at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.   
  
CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any  
electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your  
computer.   
  
This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the  
fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header.   
They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have  
saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false  
sense of credibility to the alert message.   
  
There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with  
"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because  
he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he  
checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.  
 He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the  
virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail  
message).  This person then spread his alert.   
  
As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through  
reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.  
Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have  
been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious  
being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm  
(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).  
 But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert.   
  
If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply  
ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

Pete,

I don't know about that.  My sister and Brother-in-law, both research 
bio-chemists, tell me that there is a big movement to replace the rats used
as research animals, with lawyers.  Consider:
    Lawyers are becoming more pleantiful that rats;
    Reaseachers are not as apt to form emotional attachments to lawyers;
    and finally; there are *some* things that rats just won't do.
The last probably applies to starving somalis as well...

Subject: Aux mirror replacement

I had an unusual thing happen the other week.  Within three days, both of the
small round mirrors fastened to my outside mirrors fell off.  The adhesive in
the center seems to be good, but not that around the circumference.  And of
course I'm afraid to reattach them with enough vigor to ensure that the center
adhesive is making good contact.  So, can anyone suggest an alternative method?
I've got some silicone RTV that I think should work, and I'm not adverse to
just replacing both mirrors if that's the best solution.  Is there a canonical
repair strategy for this?

Thanks!

Subject: Blinking Light Gremlin


Maybe some else has had this problem  I've been chasing it for 
two weekends.

The little red blinking light at the top of the oil temperature/oil 
pressure gauge in my '72 911, the one that's supposed to warn 
you that the handbrake is on, blinks all the time.  It doesn't go 
out.  It's not the handbrake switch.  I removed and checked it.  
It's not the wires from the swtich to wherever they go.  They're 
not shorted.  But something's making that thing blink.

If I pull the flasher unit itself, the one that hides up behind the 
speedometer -- you know, the one that you can only get at if 
you first remove your wristwatch so your hand will fit in, and 
then you still have to brave the cuts you get as your hand 
scrapes every darn thing on its way in and out --if you pull 
that, the blinking stops.  But then the directional signals don't 
work.

There's got to be a diode or something somewhere, someplace 
that's either open or closed.

What's particularly annoying about this, no, not annoying, 
actually embarrassing, is that I've got a dgree in electrical 
engineering.  Sometimes I think that those who design 
automobile electronics went through an entirely different 
curriculum, and their's was better.  At least they'll know how 
to troubleshoot cars.  Sometimes I don't even understand their 
schematic diagrams.

Help.  The car's not on the road yet -- it's reaching it's final 
stage of restoration -- but it'll drive me nuts when it is.

Many thanks.

My 79 928 has 109K and has crunchy synchros in 1st and 2nd when cold, but if
you match the revs carefully, you can change gears cleanly, even when cold.  I
also tried 75-90W hypoid oil (recommended) but it didn't help at all.  When
warm the syncro's seem fine, all of them.   Are you sure the level is correct?
ATF is also recommended for the 928 transaxle if hypoid oil is not available.
I've used ATF in my Dodge Daytona's transaxle since day 1.  No problems.
If it doesn't help, learn the shift points of your car and check your decel
vaccuum valve (it allows the engine revs to decrease more slowly when 
shifting (foot off the gas as you select another gear) which helps in matching
revs, making smoother shifts.  

later,

All this talk of what 911SCs are supposed to do when cold has got
me wondering. Are they supposed to idle high when cold? Mine 
doesn't -- and I don't think it ever did since I've owned it (two years).
As a matter of fact, mine is idling *low* when cold right now, and I have
to push the throttle sometimes to keep it from diving too low and stalling.
Then there's that starting problem I have that I haven't had the time to
mess with.... Now that doesn't sound right, does it?

The mechanics tell me that all the pressures are correct and I have
a relatively new warm-up regulator and fuel distributor (< one year old),
so what does that  leave me? Cold start valve?

    Henry, my 911SC Idles at a little above 2000 RPM, when cold, for about
5 to 10 minutes, depending on how cold. I do not have any kind of starting
problem,sounds like you might try another mechanic, or take second look at
cold start valve and warm-up reg. Keep in mind I live in California, but
lately we have seen 32 Degs F in AM. Maybe you experience a lot colder??

There is absolutely nothing that should prevent anyone of us from 
presenting the facts - naming names makes this list more affective and is 
true to its intended purpose.  The same can be true of opinions insofar as 
they are indicated as such. 

The problem arises when statements are made without justification, which
is certainly *not* the case here.  No person or thing should *ever* prevent
anyone who participates on this list from expressing an opinion and/or 
relating an accurate account of an experience such as yours.

To hell with the blasted lawyer(s).  Let them waste their money.  You were
completely in the right to do as you did, and we're all the better off for it.

Remember to name names and hold people accountable for their actions/inactions!

No one these days has the schmakus to accept any personal or professional 
responsibility for what they do.  In my eyes, the appropriate action for this 
Porsche dealer would of been to send you a letter of apology for missing such 
*major* problem areas during the inspection.  Sending in the lawyers is a 
foolish thing to do when you're wrong.  

In my opinion, they only have served to further tarnish their reputation;  I 
certainly have no respect for them.

      Yes- LET THE CAR WARM UP ! This is normal behavior for a lot of
   transaxle cars, there is nothing to fix.
     A Porsche tranny will last but you have to be sympathetic to it;
       1. Even though the shifter is balky, feel it into gear--never
          jam it. A light touch works, heavy-handed shifters have real
          fits with a 928. On cold days, keep steady pressure on the
          shifter and let it fall into gear.
       2. Let the car warm up, on cold days this does take a while but
          as you see it gets there.
       3. Try and keep the rpms up between shifts; nothing fancy, just
          blip the throttle between gears to keep the rpms somewhat
          matched.
       4. The only common points of wear on the shifter is the forward
          Heim joint (anchors the front of the shifter linkage onto the
          torque tube) and the rear universal joint just forward of the
          transaxle. Both are $40, a pain to put in (esp the forward joint)
          and will cause a sloppy shifter.
     If you are impatient you'll have trashed synchros quickly, after
    100k miles a brother borrowed my '79 and had 2nd gear really hurt
    within 3k miles.

Dear Greg,

I'm frankly surprised that a "Yankee car" has so little rust, and where it is
rusted is an easy fix - it just takes time.

Since all of the rust repair panels are now made in the after market and are
quite inexpensive, it is futile to fabricate sheet metal only to end with a
"butch-job". Repair the 914 properly and have a Porsche of lasting value.

Never remove the fuel injection; it is a wonderful system that makes the 914
run the best, pollute the least and deliver the best gas mileage. All states
are moving towards California-type emmissions standards, so it is best to
leave the 914 the way it came from the factory.

Unless they have some sort of full-flow capabilities, I SERIOUSLY doubt that
any sort of exhaust (only from the head to the collector) will improve
horsepower a full 12 points, especially on a 1.7 (which only spits out
something like 60 or 70, anyway).  

UNless someone else out there in P-land has documented, signed proof that
these will boost you 12HP, don't bother.  For $550, you can pick upa good
used engine (2.0L!), which will boost you about 20 or 30 over the stock
1.7.

Turned out to be a diode -- very old style -- always open; about two 
inches long, off-white color 1/4 inch cylinder. Yours is probably always 
closed. Isn't it in your electrical diagram? Mine was, and the diode 
itself was right in back of the bulb in the dash.

One other possibility: This light also comes on if master cylinder 'sees'

I have heard this mentioned before.  Were they involved in the development
of the Evo engine?  If so, or even if they did some other work with
Harleys, I'd be interested in some hard facts.  There's a Harley rider who
works with me who might show a little more respect for Porsches if he
heard of this.  Someday, when I get a bike, it'll be a Harley.  I just
seem to have a thing for loud vehicles that go fast and leave puddles of

Subject: Driving the winter Porsche

Sorry I missed your survey, but here is one you might be interested in.

I have a '77 1/2 924 with automatic

While living in Alaska, I drove the car everywhere, everyday, snow, rain, 
sun or volcano.  The car really handled great (after getting a matched set 
of tires all around.  Bought it with 4 different size shoes, but that's 
another story). It was very well mannered on slick roads, being almost 
impossible to spin.  I would highly recommend Bridgestone Blizzard Tires all 
around for snow/ice conditions, they really do stick.

The only execption to winter driving was when the car wouldn't even crank at 
 -35.  Then it was back in the old Volvo and off to work.  Come home, jump 
the 924 and off again.

We used the 924 everyday after moving to Wisconsin.  However, it didn't 
start one morning right around Christmas last year, and I haven't gotten it 
up since then.  Just cranks, won't start.  I hope to get some time to work 
on it, but, right now (and for the past year), no time.  But I would take 
that 924 up and down the steep hills of Duluth without much thought in the 
snow (ice at 15* slope is another thing).

Hope that helps.

Subject: 912 Carburetor Needed: Weber OK?

My mechanic (DM Motorcars, Palo Alto, CA) told me that my carburetor needs
to be rebuilt (about $400) or replaced ($500).  He stated that he would
replace the carburetor with another used one from the junkyard (Solex,
I believe) rather than use a Weber, because the Weber was actually built
for a Fiat and occaisonally has problems in a 912.  Is this a real concern?
Are there other carburetor alternatives?  How much should I realistically
pay?  He also said that if it is rebuilt (sent to the machine shop), that
there is no guarantee that something might not be wrong with it on the
inside (I have never had the 912 running-I inherited it and know that it
has been garaged for over 4 years).  I also have spent about $4000 on the
engine rebuild, brakes, and more repairs (high since the value is not that
of a 911, although there is no rust on the body and it is stock except for
the exhaust).

Subject: some 914 ideas

    Well, winter break is approaching.. time to get out the old metric
tool kit and actually do some wrenching on my 914... here are some ideas
I was thinking of doing to it, any input is appreciated.
    First... I have to replace the battery tray, for the usual reasons. 
I was thinking that if I need to get some of the battery tray paint
anyway, why not get some extra, clean up the suspension area, and paint
it with battery tray paint... just as a little extra insurance, should I
get another leaky battery.  Would this be a good idea?  Could I spray
body color over the battery tray paint when I get around to repainting
the whole car?
    Also, I need to get new outer rockers.  (the old ones were ABS and
are only about half there.)  Obviously this is a rust danger area... I
was thinking of getting aftermarket fiberglass ones, and then cutting
small slots along the bottom edge to help any water/road foo drain out. 
Good idea/not worth it?
    On the inner rockers, which would be the best way to keep them from
rusting again- 1. strip off all undercoating and repaint.  (suggestions
on paint?  Appearance is obviously not important.)  2. After all the
patching is done, apply more undercoating and paint over the
undercoating to seal out any water that might slip in the cracks.  3.
Spray on undercoating and leave it raw.  I live in PA, so keeping the
rust monster away is a big concern.

Thanks for any help,

Kovert. It had a 3.0 SC engine, and had been modified for the street with 
radio, heater, and "T-tops", as documented in Pano in, I think, 1970.

I really can;t say how it was as a street car. The owner was in the

Hi Nathan,

>    On the inner rockers, which would be the best way to keep them from
>rusting again-

I've been asking around about combatting rust on
non-galvanized cars and it seems that everybody has
their own opinion which is different from everybody else.

Here's what I'm going to do:

1) Strip all paint, etc from the rockers, doing one at a time.
2) Spray a liberal coat of zinc paint (sold as cold galvanizing
paint - sometimes for marine use).
3) A layer of rust-eating primer (just for fun!)
4) A few coats of paint (similar to the body colour)
5) Some canned spray undercoating
6) Some more body colour paint

Sound like overkill???  Sure....but what the hell.

Oh yeah....the best thing you can do no matter what you
decide to paint them with is to remove the outer rockers
a few times a year and clean off the inner rockers.  Especially
after driving around in bad weather.  You wouldn't believe
how much dirt gets caught in there!  The dirt traps moisture
which rots out the car.

One more point is that whenever you strip paint from
metal so it's bare, rust will start to form after as little
as 30 minutes so that's why you should do one rocker
at a time - or even 1/2 a rocker at a time....

As a resident of Vancouver we get a lot of rain and I to had the same

Subject: How I Spent My Summer Vacation, or Is It OK to Cry Now?

In case any of you had wondered why all of a sudden earlier this year I 
wasn't showing up for nearly as many Porschephiles-on-the-road impromptu
gatheriings. And because I know I have a lot of friend out there who
will want to know this:

Today ended the hardest period in my life. Beau, my second oldest cat,
had to be put to sleep this afternoon. He was nearly 12; we'd had him
since New Year's Eve 1984. He is survived by 8 housemates and two humans.

Mary, my wife of 15 years, and I decided not to have children a long time
ago, but have these 10 wonderful cats that really in the deepest sense 
*are* our children. This is, near as we can tell, like losing a child.

Late last year and early this year, I'd been out of town a lot, working in 
New Jersey. When I arrived home at one point in March after being gone for a
length of time, Beau demanded my attention FIRST. This was not atypical, as 
we'd always had a special bond, so that night, we played for an extra long 
time. I even let him chew on the bottons of the dress shirt I was wearing, 
a favorite but forbidden playtime activity of his, as  a special treat. The 
next morning at early feeding, he had a half-golfball sized mass on his left
upper lip. We rushed him into our regular vet, and got the word back that 
it was probably cancer. He was then scheduled over to an oncologist. 

Beau had a non-encapsulated fibrosarcoma in his left maxillary sinus 
that had burst through to his lip. He was a real trooper, and we decided that
as long as he was fighting,and most importantly, having fun, we had to give 
him every chance. He had surgery twice, a ton of radiation, chemo,
and was due to start in an experimental gene therapy progam. He looked truely
gruesome from the left, with a fistula midway up his nose with tumor hanging
out, an eye damaged by radiation, and totally smooth skin from all the hair
loss. But he was having such a good time and doing so well that there was no
way we could possibly have denied him whatever was available. And we're
extremely luck to have an exceptional veterinary oncology practice literally
about 2 miles from the house. Their care and expertise made all the difference
in the world -- for him and for us -- and I have only the best things to say 
about Glen King, his staff and partners.

Beau lost his sense of smell in July, and would only eat live food he caught
on the hoof under the theory that if it was just alive, it can't be "bad".
(cats won't eat what they can't smell -- something I didn't know until this)
So I spent a lot of time trapping lizzards, his favorite, and feeding him 
store-bought mice. By August, he wasn't even really that interested in
killing dinner, so we started force feeding him twice daily. The change in
my life from go go go go to having to be someplace for 45 minutes twice a
day -- *HAVING* to, not just a good idea, or whatever -- was pronounced.

He got to go outside under adult supervision because it perked him up 
so much. It started as a special treat, then became a post-feeding perk,
then eventually, just what he did most of the time. Fortuantely, Mary
was able to make the time committment to him, to spend whatever time it
took to help him do whatever made him happiest. She said that he'd given
her ten very good years, and that giving him a few months wasn't that
big of a deal. So that's exactly what she did.  Eventually, we started 
letting our oldest cat, Klaws, go out with him since they were such big 
buddies. Klaws would even catch things for Beau to play with or eat. Then 
in late October, Klaws just fell over dead one morning from heart failure. 
It was a crushing blow for all of us -- completely unexpected.  With Beau, 
we knew that his cancer was end-stage and we would only have him for a few 
more months; with Klaws, we figured that since he was only 12, that we would
have many more years to look forward to.

Beau's last month was just wonderful. He was exceptionally active, having a
very good time with life.  He did miss doing things with Klaws, but had
a very good time visiting people in the neighborhood, climbing trees, 
terrorizing small dogs, etc. Then on Saturday he started having very odd
looking stools, and on Sunday started a serious decline. We eventually
had to take him to the animal ER (also about 3 miles from the house) where
they did a blood workup that showed him to be in very serious condition.
He got a transfusion, IV, some IV antibiotics, O2 tent -- the works. Mary
spent the night with him there, since I had a super important business meeting
the following afternoon. I stayed home with the other cats and tried to
sleep, not that it did any good. I was very uncertain as to whether there
would be a cat to take to the onco clinic the next morning. 

Monday AM he was obviously better, and we took him in to the clinic. They
elected to leave him on the treatment started the night before, and asked
us to come feed him and visit with him that afternoon. He was doing better, 
but they had him stay the night. The next AM we came to visit and feed him,
and our vet suggested that we take him home, and then evaluate how he was
doing today. They left the IV shunt in so I could give him the IV drugs 
he needed, and off we went. 

Yesterday was a good day -- he had some fun, but was pretty tired. Last night
he got to go in to forbidden places and play, and was purring a very big
purr when I finally went to bed about 4:30. We took him in for a 9:00 AM
appointment, where they ran some blood work that indicated to me that
he was declining despite the positive spin the vet put on it for us.
He asked us to take him home for the day, and then bring him back for
radiation tomorrow. On the way home, he jumped out of my wife's lap and 
looked out the window at passing cars, jumped up in the rear package shelf and
had a blast. When we got home, he stayed there for a long time, purring
and play-fighting when we tried to remove him. 

By about 1:00 PM he was just laying around, and by 2:00 he was looking very
bad. We tried things to perk him up, but he just wasn't interested. Then
he started making a very distressed noise, and we started talking about
the fact that this was probably "it". We cried, and told tales of the good
times, and prayed, and he sort of went into a semi-concious state. Since it
wasn't clear how he felt, we thought it best to wait a bit. Then he "told"
us as clearly as possible: he literally dragged himself out of his box, around 
the corner of the house to the door of the car he usually got loaded into
for the trips to the vet, made a horrible distressed sound, and collapsed.

We immediately took him down to the clinic, and by 4:00 PM, he had been eased 
on to the other side. We'd had him for almost 10 years, but had known him 
for 12. It almost seems like a dream or something at this point...

We had both Klaws and Beau cremated by an organziation called Little Friends.
We opted to have the cremains returned, where they'll both have a place with
us in the physical world as well as in our hearts. When Klaws died, it was
so sudden that we felt it necessary for the other cats to say goodbye, so
we brought him back home for a kitty-kat funeral before sending him for 
cremation. It was sad, and touching, to see everyone sniff him, touch him, 
say *something* in cat talk, and go on. Beau and Number Four, both of whom 
were big buddies with Klaws, spent a lot of extra time with him. For Beau, 
we felt that everyone had said their goodbyes already, so just had him taken 
straight from the clinic this afternoon.

So, I'm surviving, somehow. It was bad enough losing Klaws so unexpectedly.
He was my best friend, and in a particulary grim period in my life, the
only reason I had for living. Beau had been such a big part of my life too
even before the recent illness. Even though he truely loved Mary, he was
"my" cat. He just lived for me to come home and be with him, to play with
him rough but somehow in a "special" way that noone else ever seemed to
do just right for him. 

I'm still amazed at how empty a house with 8 cats still in it can seem.

I most likely won't be doing too much for a few days. I'll probably check
my mail at least some, but won't be busy keeping the world (or at least 
the list) safe for Flat Fours.

It would be unreasonable to expect to be able to install any type of high 
frequency source inside a modern vehicle with no regard to the impact on other 
electronic components.  
 If you take the cover off of a computer and put it next to your television, I 
would expect some interference on the television.  If you put a television 
inside your computer I would expect problems with both.  The vehicle will act 
as a shield against emissions from outside the vehicle but if you put 
transmitters inside the vehicle, even if you put copper plate all around every 
sensitive component inside the vehicle there will be a limit as to how much 
immunity you will get.  The more power you transmit, the more will get 
through.  Also, all the wiring in the vehicle acts as an antennae coupling the 
noise into power and ground.
 Summary: If you aren't putting out very many watts you probably won't have 
much of a problem, a lot of watts, some testing would be required.

My personal favorite is 3M Protective Gel.  It also works well on interior

I don't know about HP gains or heat interior gains from SS heat exchangers
(haven't installed mine yet).  Were I to guess, I say the HP gain would be
non-existant to minimal.  The heating gains would depend on what you are
replacing.  In my case, I expect significant improvements in interior heat.
The old heat exchangers on my 2.0L were no longer attached to the exhaust
pipes.  One was so bad, I could rotate it about 40 degrees around the pipes.
Both sides were full of holes.  Any heat actually making it too the interior
was probably coming directly through the firewall.

You should be able to do a little better on price.  I bought mine from
German Parts and Restoration: 1-800-321-5432 for a $190 per side.  They are
SSI brand and from the vantage point of my living room they appear to be of
good quality. The gents at GPR get high marks for phone manners and

That's what I said. My original message read "Re the Mazda Miller cycle,
it's all just hype. This is a conventional four-stroke Otto cycle with
slightly unusual valve timing and a supercharger."
 
Yes, I've driven one. The rest of the car has its good and bad points like
any other manufactured product. 210 hp notwithstanding, its performance is
less than stellar. Yes, I drove one to form my opinion, and here are my
condensed notes.
 
Mazda Millenia S, August 1994
 
Seems to be a very well built car, has a heavy, solid feel like a Mercedes.
Great road isolation without having a floaty suspension.
 
Interior of Milennia has a Honda-like feel, in that the cowl is rather low
and there is a panoramic view out the windshield. Very well finished, good
materials, good fit and finish, good design. The interior has restrained,
tasteful use of that rubbery black plastic coating which is used to such
wretched excess in the Lincoln Mark VIII. It's only used on a few parts of
the dash to contrast with the leather-grained vinyl.
 
Poor visibility to the rear. Although you can see OK through the mirror, if
you physically turn around to look, you can't really see over the high rear
parcel shelf.
 
There is a clunk in the driver's seat under cornering. Something in the
seatback is sliding around.
 
0-60 at nearly 9 seconds isn't going to blow anybody's socks off, I'm
sorry. It should be a lot quicker than it is. Nothing we do seems to make
any difference, including shifting manually in the "hold" mode. 0-60 in 8.9
seems to be what it wants to run.
 
One passenger complained that there wasn't enough footroom. The lower part
of the dash intruded, so feet had to be kept at a sideways angle.
 
The transmission is this car's weak point. Really sluggish kickdowns, and
inconsistent kickdowns. Sometimes you can get a kickdown to first, sometimes
not. It's almost impossible to achieve a kickdown in first gear if you are
above 30 mph. One friend in the car business says that he thinks it's done
on purpose to meet the 30 mph noise driveby test. Kickdowns, when they do
occur, are not very smooth; there is too much hesitation before the
shift.
 
A current 929 owner feels there is more tire noise in this car than in his
own car. Tires are Michelin XGT V4, P215/55 R16 91V M+S.
 
Actually feels quite good in the slalom, my very first run had no unpleasant
surprises, actually got the back end out a bit, unusual for a front-driver.
Steering is quick, and the back end comes out just enough to set you up for
the next cone. You build up a nice rhythm. Very predictable car on the slalom,
I like its slalom behavior. With this much steering boost, you have to be
careful not to crank it too quickly.
 
Traction control really dials back the power if you take a turn at too high a
speed.
 
Best stop 166 ft. from 65 mph is mediocre for a car.
 
There is some suspension harshness when you hit bumps under hard cornering, you
get some clunking from the front. Very forgiving on freeway hop but I was able
to bottom the suspension several times when going into driveways. Not bottom
the body, but rather crash the front end all the way to the stops, a hard
thump when it ran out of travel. Even relatively little dips are enough to slam
it to the stops.
 
There isn't a whole lot of performance available at full throttle below 30 mph.
I think with this engine's very late intake valve closing, and with the
inability of the Lysholm screw compressors to effectively fill the cylinders
at low rpm, you don't have much torque at low rpm. That may be
part of it, and the other part is bad matching of the engine to the
transmission. The Milennia may be a great car without the hotrod engine,
and I don't recall from the Monroney sticker what the premium is for this
engine, but frankly I don't think it's worth it. It may be a perfectly good
car, at a more attractive price, without it.

    Getting the water out is only the start.  All kinds of crap gets
stuck in those damn rockers.  I've found everything from dirt and sand
to gravel to candy wrappers to some sort of screw/nut/fastener thing!
All that will just trap the water, and plug up your slots.
    Resign yourself to opening up the rockers periodically--undo the
three screws along the bottom, pull the bottom out, use something to
knock the crap loose, (clean it,) put it back together.  Your car
will thank you for it.

Happy to recommend two places.  One is the shop I hang around,

The other is Precision Performance, in Framingham.  Ed and Carol

    Stock 1.7 is rated at 80 HP, stock US 2.0 is rated at 95 HP.
    But I agree with you--from several sources, I get the impression that
the exhaust system is not the big limiter on 914 engine performance.  Even
if the SSI had good flow, other things (heads on a 1.7??? valves???  duuno)
are the "bottleneck", so it wouldn't gain you much/anything.  Most people
seem to think the SSI exhaust on 914s is only good for keeping the thing
from rusting to pieces.  Which is a pretty real concern, at least with the
mondo expensivo 2.0L exchangers and exhaust.

Oh wise Porschephiles:
Have looked in the  Porsche FAQ on the WWW, and followed the P-phile list for
a couple of weeks, but most of you seem to be air-heads, er, I  mean,
converse about the air-cooled variety of Porches.  I haven't seen much
mention of 928's (haven't watched long enough, maybe) , so I'd like to ask a
few neophyte pain-in-the -ass questions (928 FAQ anyone?).
 I'm thinking of buying a mid -80's 928-slushbox (my other choice might be a
V-8 Audi quattro, but more difficult to find).  I figure a $20k budget tops
me out at about an '87 or 88. Some general questions: 1) What's the diif.
between 85,86, 87 and 88 as far as engine ratings (size, HP, etc),
performance (0-60, brakes, etc), general ( interior,electronics, suspension,
any design "quirks" to avoid/fix).  and 2) Can this be a daily driver (90
mi/day), and what kind of maintance should I expect. Comments as to how long
the engine/trans should last before a rebuild, timing belt change, do rotors
warp in 10k miles, --you know the normal questions about what to watch out
for. What especially should I check or have checked when I go to look or
test-drive one of these bad-boys. Oh, one more question for now, what's the
chance of a 928 staying on the road in the snow.  I don't expect it to drive
like an Audi quattro, but maybe with a set of narrower "winter-wheels"... 
Any experiences, good or bad? //Thanks  in advance for any wisdom that you
all might want to throw my way.

You may or may not have been smoking any of that...stuff..., but for fiscal
'94 Porsche lost 150 million deutschemarks, or about $96 million. In fiscal
'93 the company lost 239 million dms. The company anticipates paying no
dividends on its preferred stock for the second straight year, which is
significant because preferred shareholders gain voting rights for the first
time at shareholder meetings. Those rights expire once the company resumes
paying dividends. As we are all aware, the Porsche and Piech families control
100% of the common stock, but only 40% of the preferred stock.

Subject: Ignition Key Replacement Procedure
- -----------
Pfellow Pfilers:

	After some months of procrastination and aggressive
laziness, I have finally replaced the ignition switch in
my '84 911 Carrera.  The following is how I done it.

Tools Needed:
- -------------
27 mm socket and extension for steering wheel nut
Easy Out (size isn't marked, needs 5/64" drill bit)
5/64" drill bit and drill
13 mm open end wrench
needle nose pliers
flat head screwdriver
13 mm crowfoot and extension

Parts Needed:
- -------------
ignition switch assembly, contains both mechanical
and electrical portions of the switch.  I bought mine
from Performance Products for $328.75.  Note that there
is an extra connection this switch that isn't used.  I
solved this by ignoring it completely.  People that live
in a high humidity environment may want to plug it.

Procedure:
- ----------
1)	Disconnect the battery ground, and cover with a plastic
bag.
2)	Remove the switch cover plate.  I was able to screw mine
off by hand.
3)	Remove the horn bezel by gently pulling at a corner.  I
have the sport steering wheel, and started at the bottom.
4)	Using the 27mm socket, remove the steering wheel retaining
nut, followed by the steering wheel itself.  Watch out for
the horn power wire.  Be sure and mark the alignment of the
steering wheel and the shaft before removing the wheel.
5)	Unscrew the 6 screws holding the steering column switch
covers.  Four are visible as you sit in the drivers seat, and
there is one on each side of the covers.
6)	Unscrew and remove the wiring for the horn contact ring,
and remove both cover halves.
7)	Unscrew the 2 screws holding the headlight dimmer switch
to the bracket, remove the switch from the bracket, and tie
to the steering post.
8)	Drill starter holes in both breakaway bolts and back them
out using the easy out.
9)	Remove both connectors from the ignition switch.  Both
will pull out without any tools.  The big connector is a pain,
as there isn't a lot of room.
10)	Now look in the hole in the dashboard just to the left of
and underneath the steering column.  You will see a stud with
a nut attached screwed into a bracket welded to the side of 
the steering column.  Using the 13mm wrench, loosen the nut
and unscrew it until you can get the jaws of the needle nose
pliers on the stud itself.  Now gently rotate the stud until
you can remove the switch.  NOTE:  In the course of figuring
the above trick out, I ended up drilling out the rivets holding
the plate to which the switch is bolted, and removing the plate.
I therefore don't know exactly how the switch will move when
it is ready to slide.  I slid it to the left, away from the
steering column.  If you don't drill the plate out, it will
have to move towards the front of the car, somehow.
11)	Installation is the reverse.  I put the switch in place,
loosely installed the bolts and screwed in the stud, attached
the connectors, and then tightened everything up.  I don't
know what sort of socket is used to fully tighten the breakaway
bolts, as I haven't done that yet.  I used 5-40 cap head screws,
1/8" long, to secure the switch plate to the dashboard.  1/8"
pop rivets would work, but my rivet gun head wouldn't fit in
the space available.

The bad news in all of this is that you now have a new ignition
key that doesn't match the door keys.  Oh well.

The good news is that it will start reliably.  I removed the
electrical portion from the old switch, and still had trouble
rotating the switch into start all the time.

Along the thread of dirt getting trapped behind the 914 rocker panels,
has anyone seen 914 inner fender liners for sale?  I'm thinking that
they would be curved plastic, shaped to fit up inside the wheel well.
(Hopefully high enough to prevent tire clearance problems.)
If they came down far enough in the front of the rear wheel wells, they
might help keep the rocker area clean.  They would also help keep
any stones thrown by the tires from denting the fenders from the inside.

The rumors I heard, were not that it causes problems while you were using
it, but that the deterioration if you stopped using it would be greater,
because you're no longer regularly replacing the softening ingredient.
I don't know if this is true or not personally.  My interior is pretty 
much gone now, but I'm trying Mothers' product, I forget the name.  One
good thing that made me try it is no oily feel after using it.

Do you (or any one else out there) know of such a place in the Chicago area who

When they repaint the car do they strip it (chemical or blast)to bare metal ?
Do they keep the *original* identification tags on the car after repainting ?

The latest updates from the legal bleeding edge.

I talked with the <ScumSucking Porsche Dealer> [<- notice legally correct
notation] and they are set in their opinions. They are comparing this mailing
list to a newspaper or magazine because of the number of people involved. They
are trying to apply the laws that regulate those media to this one. As it turns 
out there is a technicality in my original post. I did, in fact, not talk to the 
service manager, but instead to a service advisor who I thought was the
service manager. ( Call up <ScumSucking Porsche Dealer> ask for service manager
get service advisor. So there is a small inaccuracy in my original post upon
which they are basing their claims. "But he didn't talk to the service manager"
which is true.)

It turns out that <ScumSucking Porsche Dealer> is not on the list. They don't
know much about the Net and therefore think that EVERYONE on the net 
participates in this list. I think part of the problem revolves around all
the hype that the Internet has generated lately. If they understood this list
then they probably wouldn't have gotten lawyers involved, they probably would
have posted a message to the list explaining their position ("They don't check
the body during pre-purchase inspections") which would have been fine,
constructive, positive, etc.

I, unfortunately, don't have the resources to wage a legal battle with these
people. 

However, I think that they should be put into their place. The original problem,
that they overlooked some major damage, can be excused. People make mistakes
and one incident should not necessarily cause a good reputation (that this dealer
has) to be lost. But this kind of intimidation is a serious problem.

Should "we" let this one slide and go away or should we make a big deal of it?
I am inclined to let the matter rest. I've met few lawyers in my life that
I like and the thought of becoming involved in a legal battle leaves a bad taste
in my mouth.

I, for one, will never have anything to do with these assholes again.

I appreciate all of the responses and opinions expressed on the matter. It seems
that we have a good bunch of people on this list. Thanks.

By the way, I am proud to announce that I have obtained my first Porsche :
a Black 1986 911 Carrera Coupe in incredible shape. (I found out about this
car through this list. Thanks Dr. Kresh!) I now understand what everyone has 
been talking about. What a car!

I think this is the motor that they use strictly in the Buell motorcycles

Re: They would also help keep any stones thrown by the tires from denting

You want to know about denting the fenders from the inside?

Coming back from the 1988 Parade at Colorado Springs in my 914 2.0, just
outside of Salt Lake City on I-80 traveling west, a tractor-trailer full of
hot asphalt accidentally lost its entire load covering all west-bound lanes
with 6" of asphalt for about 3/4 mile. Going the same direction with the
setting sun in my eyes, I didn't recognize the stuff until too late to slow
or pull off. It looked like a shadow to me. All of a sudden the car launched
onto the stuff at speed with a machine-gun noise that continued until I
reached an off-ramp.

I dug most of the stuff out with the lug wrench. But not until both front
fenders showed a very severe and costly case of acne. Ended up re-painting
the entire car Allis-Chalmers Orange (I forget what Porsche calls the
color). If you have this color, keep handy a can of Rust-Oleum #7458. It's a
perfect match.

Nothing sticks together like hot 008Rs and hot asphalt.

Hi Pete,

>Along the thread of dirt getting trapped behind the 914 rocker panels,
>has anyone seen 914 inner fender liners for sale?

I saw these for sale a long time ago....a few months later they were
on a closeout sale for 50% off.  Now I don't see them advertised
anymore.  Hmmmm.....

I'd be afraid of them trapping stuff in your fenderwells to assist
in rotting those out.

Also watch out for rust starting on your door jams from the inner
fender area.  Rocks get thrown into that area and rust will start
to form.  Those fender liners would help stop rock damage,
but like I said, they'd probably help rot out other areas of your
fenders.

There are a bunch of areas on a 914 which are prone to rust like
the inner rockers by the jack spur, door jams (from the fender area),
floor under driver's seat by the e-brake, floor by the pedal
assembly, under the front and rear trunk seals, trunk floors (esp the
rear by the taillights), underneath the battery.

Did I miss anything?  :-)

What *EVERY* 914 owner should do is to perform a visual
inspection of their car a couple of times a year.  Pick a nice
day to jack your car up and place it on 4 jackstands.  Remove
all the wheels and get dirty.  Clean the underside of your car
completely to remove all dirt and crud.  If you see any chips
in the paint, sand down the area and treat it your own special
way.  I posted my way yesterday.  For those areas where
rust is forming and you can't get in there and sand it - use a
rust converter such as Rust Mort.

Don't be afraid to get in there and do it.  Get a flashlight and
look EVERYWHERE.  Hell, for most of you I bet even your
trailing arms are dirt-covered filthy chunks of metal!!!  Just
remember that dirt traps moisture and this causes rust.  So
keeping the dirt off the underside of your car will help the
battle against this.  Just make sure your car is securely held
up in the air by jackstands, and whatever else you can find
so it doesn't fall on you.  Oh yeah...in some cases you should
definitely wear goggles to stop crud from getting in your eyes.
(BT,DT)  :-)

Have fun!

I like Glasurit.  Both my p-cars have been shot in glasurit.  It seems to be a

You may want to use a single-stage paint instead of one with a clear coat 
because the clear coated paints are much harder to repair (and have it look like
the rest of the car) later if you have a fender bender.

Alan,  I put a set of these on my '74 914 back in 1979 - the factory
ones had rusted and I had no heat.  I'm presently starting to restore
the car a but, but these heat exchangers will definitely not need 
replacement.  Best parts I ever put on the car.

I have no idea about the horsepower claims; my interest was primarily
longevity, which I have achieved and then some.

As for the price, I think I paid somewhere around that for them back
then, but I really don't remember - it could have been $125 - the old

Has anyone tried this.  The can sells for $9, the adaptors you rent for

My brother took it to the Dealer and they want to charge him $700 for

that fails, change the injectors.  Isn't $700 kinda steep for changing
six injectors??  Can't trust the dealer you know.

The 2.0 ss hear exchangers have a larger diameter pipe than the stock

From: Ryan John Cousineau <rcousine@sfu.ca>
Subject: Porsche Harley Motorcycles: the truth

I'm writing this to remove some of the misunderstandings around Harley, 
and of course, the Nova engine project by Porsche. My dad may own a 928 
(reason I'm on the list) but I run the family fleet of motorcycles (three 
or so; a record 2/3 work right now!)

Since the early 1980s, Harley-Davidson has had three significant in-house 
engine programs that are public knowledge:

Nova, Evolution, and VR1000

Buell is not an engine program or anything. More on that later.

Nova

Nova was a Porsche-designed, Harley-commissioned engine program. It was a 
liquid-cooled V4. I have a photo of the bike, and it looks like a generic 
big-ole touring bike (maybe a Honda Goldwing or a H-D Tour Glide) with a 
V4 engine that looks a lot the engines used in Honda Magnas over the 
years. It doesn't look much like a Fat Boy, that's for sure.

The radiator was under the seat in order to disguise the liquid-cooled 
nature of the bike.

After much soul-searching and a lot of testing in the early 80s, Harley 
killed the project. I don't know why for sure, but Harley probably 
recognized the need to build a bike that more closely recalled its 
heritage as a builder of big V-twin engines.


Evolution

In 1985 or so, Harley introduced the Evolution engine, a pushrod, 
air-cooled 45-degree V-twin that was a significant and thoroughly 
redesigned replacement for the previous "Shovelhead," but had also 
clearly evolved from that and previous Harley engines. This motor is now 
the only motor found in regular-production Harleys, though in three flavors:

Sportser 883cc and 1200cc (Evos with unitized transmissions), and "Big 
Twin" 1340cc (separate tranny).

The Evo has been a runaway success. It's a better motor in all ways than 
the Shovel. It produces an all-day, easily-boostable, dead-reliable 50hp, 
and it looks good. The Nova was probably a better engine, but can you imagine
a Fat Boy with a V4? Me neither.

VR1000

This year, Harley unveiled a racing-only engine, the VR1000. It's a 
liquid-cooled 60-degree V-twin, 8 valves, four cams, thoroughly modern 
and they only plan to build a homologation number (50?) Good thing too, 
because the engine needs a _lot_ of development work. It finished about 
one or two races this year with a top-flight rider on it (Miguel 
Duhamel), and had hilariously frequent engine failures. Hopefully it will 
be competitive next year, but Duhamel gave his vote of non-confidence by 
signing to ride elsewhere.

What's a Buell?

Erik Buell is a former H-D engineer. In the 1980s he chased his dream by 
quitting the company and building Sportster 1200-powered sportbikes. Last 
year, Harley bought 49% of the company, leaving Erik with 51%. Erik 
responded by creating an all-new bike, the Thunderbolt, still based on 
the Sportster. Buell has little or nothing to do with the VR1000, though 
speculation is rampant that Buell will be the name this sportbike will 
bear if it ever makes it to the showroom. Buell does no significant mods 
to the Sportster engines unless the customer so orders, though they do 
have a different exhaust pipe and muffler from any Harley. Buells are 
very innovative bikes, but they don't compete with top-flight Japanese or 
Italian machines. Buells are available at selected Harley dealers.

Hi:  You have 2 carburetors on your 912 so I guess they both need rebuilding.  
If it's going to be registered in California, you have to have it smogged and 
in order to pass it needs to have factory installed equipment i.e. Solex.  
This may become a driving factor in your decision.  Webbers and Dellortos are 
options but I doubt you'd get past smog checks.  Ask your mechanic to be sure.

My mechanic (DM Motorcars, Palo Alto, CA) told me that my carburetor needs
to be rebuilt (about $400) or replaced ($500).  He stated that he would
replace the carburetor with another used one from the junkyard (Solex,
I believe) rather than use a Weber, because the Weber was actually built
for a Fiat and occaisonally has problems in a 912.  Is this a real concern?
Are there other carburetor alternatives?  How much should I realistically
pay?  He also said that if it is rebuilt (sent to the machine shop), that
there is no guarantee that something might not be wrong with it on the
inside (I have never had the 912 running-I inherited it and know that it
has been garaged for over 4 years).  I also have spent about $4000 on the
engine rebuild, brakes, and more repairs (high since the value is not that
of a 911, although there is no rust on the body and it is stock except for
the exhaust).

If dealers would worry more about providing good service at a far price
you would not be in this situation.  It is not your fault they did not 
provide good service.  

You know, in the 80's it was QUALITY, the 90's is the time for. customer
service.  Thats right, *CUSTOMER SERVICE* you arrigant dealers.

I ran into the same type of issues w/ a local Audi dealer.  The dealer
says "you need a whole new hyd pump".  I say "no just replace the leaking
hyd line".  Hence I use another reputable service group.

Enough dealer bashing.

Dear Nathan,

914 foglights are still readily available although expensive. The 914 is
wired for them from the factory, so installaiton is easy. The foglights for
USA are wired to both the headlight switch and the low beam flasher, so they
only work with the headlights on and on low beam! (Although they can easily
be wired differently!) On a budget I would suggest the following:

    1. Eliminate the foglights and install a pair of "horn" grilles (they do
not have the foglight hole cut in them)
    2. Buy one foglight used $50.00 and a lense used $15.00 for the other
one.
    3. Go to a parts warehouse with your used foglight and match it!

Good luck!

any mirror I get would be an electric one, and that I just wouldn't hook up

I go hunting?  And lastly, does anyone have a good source for this either 
new or used?  I saved a copy of the steps to install one of these a while
back and am thinking of doing the work myself after it gets painted.  Any
words of wisdom for going with either new or used?  I have glanced at some

Subject: Re:  General info needed on 928's

I have an '84 928S - manual transmission - last year of the two valves
per cylinder engine in the US. The shop manual describes the details of
engine and other stats for each year, but I don't think there are major
differences. Somewhere in there was the change to the 928S4, which has
a somewhat different body (mainly the big front and rear plastic pieces,
I think). There are the usual continuous product improvement kind of
changes - disk rotors got a little bigger, clutch went from double to
single plate, injection went from K- to KL-Jetronic, etc. - but it's
not my impression that there are important years to seek or avoid.

I use mine as a daily driver, for far fewer miles, and think that it
would be an excellent choice for a long commute. There was a recent
thread about long trips in 911's - none of the 928 owners on the list
spoke up, but we were probably all thinking smugly about the creature
comforts of the 928 and what an excellent car it is for long drives
(at least I was). Engine and trans should be very long-lived; timing
belts at 50K miles; I've had no weird failures, but we are talking
about cars that are 5 to 10 years old, and things do break and wear
out occasionally, and they are not cheap.

With the 225 tires, mine is a pig in the snow. Skinnier tires, as
recommended by Porsche for winter driving, would probably help a lot,
but I put mine away for the worst of the winter last year. There is
SO much salt on the roads in Massachusetts that I really didn't want
to subject a car I really like to such a bad environment, even
though it is aluminum and galvanized steel. 

It is a totally different car from a 911 (although they have gotten a
lot heavier over the years, they still have several hundred pounds to
go to reach the 3300 pounds of the 928). Try it, you will either love
it or hate it. And let us know what you decide.

      Whoa on #2 ! If you read the can, it says that the cold galvanizing
  compound (which is like 90% zinc and 10% Epoxy) is an incompatible
  primer for most paints ! Which ones ? Well, the one you plan to use, of
  course  (Murphey's law...!).  I'd just use DP-90 Zinc Oxide/Epoxy primer
  in step 3 and forget the Galvanized compound...

     Make sure you "flexibilize" the body color you put over the undercoating
  (on the outside of the rocker). If you are painting the whole car, an
  important detail step is to spray paintable undercoating under the wheelwell
  inside edges, and paint these with flexibilized paint. This keeps the
  perpetual rock banging from eating the paint (thanks to Bruce Anderson's
  book for pointing this out years ago).

    The cold galvanizing stuff is good stuff, practically the only thing
  you can use between spot-welded body panel seams. But don't plan to use it
  like a regular primer.

     You were probably right to say what you did the way you did. But
 unfortunately, "right" has got nearly nothing to do with the civil justice
 system. The code of ethics lawyers swear by includes a statement to the
 effect that the cost of the lawsuit itself may not be oppressive; but if you
 go to a lawyer, the first advice they'll give is "We'll file a bunch of 
 motions and run up the other guys fees...." Who wins ? What "ethics" ?

     "Scumsucking Dealer" chalks off $175/hour legal fees to his business and
 discounts the cost from his taxes. Real people spend a day with the lawyer 
 and give up a mortgage payment. Scumsucking Owner got picked on as a kid and
 finds he can beat up people with his lawyer present. You were pissed and said
 so.

    You can recite what the law -says-,  but the industry that lives by
 "The Art of War" knows that the Art of Law involves litigating long enough,
 expensive enough, and forcing the other guy to buckle under financial 
 pressure instead of legal principles. Threaten to burn someones' business
 down, and you're an extortionist; threaten to break them by a lawsuit and
 you'll find a dozen lawyers to help. The rules were made by and benefit 
 lawyers themselves and are sustained to promote the industry by encouraging
 filing lawsuits; only Alaska provides that the plaintiff is responsible for
 the defendants legal fees in case they lose their case. A defendant has 
 nothing to win in a lawsuit and everything to lose. Law is the only business 
 where its okay to throw the first punch and ethically claim they only did
 what their clients were privileged to do.

    There are decent lawyers, there are a lot of wrongs that need a system
 to be righted. I can sympathize with any workman (like the mechanics
 at Scumsucking Dealer) who can't fix everything and are faced with Deceptive
 Trade Practices consumer law when a car owner lands an expensive bill on
 an expensive car.  But this list is full of owners telling about how
 "Princely Porsche" dealer did them right; "Scumsucking Dealer" had the
 option to make up for their mistake and instead apparently decided to cover
 their asses....

Subject: 911 Shifter unattached problem


Hello,

I am having a problem with my gear shifter.  I am cursed!
Just as I was backing my 1981 911SC Targa into my garage for winter
storage, I was hunting for reverse with the shift lever, while the
clutch was pressed in, and the gear shift went into the position for
reverse, or close to it, and I could not move it from that position.
It did not actually go into reverse gear though.  This would have been 
the LAST shift of the whole summer!!!  And now its broken. :-(.

I could only move it up and down, and not out of the reverse track.
But it is not in reverse.  It is in some forward gear, I think
its fourth, since when I let the clutch out, the engine bogs, and
begins to stall.  Thus clutch seems to be working fine.  It is just the
shift lever, or the linkage just below the pivot point of the shifter
that seems to be out of whack, or off track.  Is it possible for the
gear shift to become diss-attached from what ever it attaches to below
the floor boards, and thus stuck.  It moves freely, up and down
within the reverse track of the shift pattern.  After trying to wiggle
it back into the neutral left-right track, it did free up out of the
reverse track, but felt very loose, as if completely unattached
below its gear shift pivot point.  As if I had sheared off some
connecting bolt.  Is there a bolt that I probably broke, or that wore
out form shifting over time?

I can only start the engine with the clutch in, since the it seems to
be stuck in 4th gear.  The reason I think it the shifter orriginally
only moved and was stuck in the reverse track, and not the fourth gear 
track is that it seemed to appear all the way over to the right (versus 
being more leftward, or centered for the fourth gear track).  Now it
is completely free, and when I wiggle it around, there is something
interfering with it (probably the arm that it was orriginally connected
to.  Is it difficult to reattach?  Expensive to fix?  Is this something that
could happen realitively easily?  BTW: I do not have a short shifter kit
installed.  Right now, the car is stuck in the garage, down a sloped
incline, in 4th gear.  But at least its garaged for the winter and now
I have my $100 Chevette rolling - what performance the vette has :-).

Someone please help me, I still need to wash the car, and fill the tires
with extra air and cant get it out of the garage becuase of the slope.
Maybe a sponge bath?

I had a similar dilema with my wife's Volvo 240.  A local Jiffy Lube had a 
service simillar to what you want to do and they charged only ?29.95.  It was 
amaizing at the improved performance. No need for new injectors ethier.
Remember that injectors have these tiny little holes for spraying the fuel in a 
fine mist and it doesn't take much to clog them up.

It's probably the LM stuff, which is very good. Racing gas does not have
detergents, so fouled and sticky injectors are a fact of life. While you
can opt to replace them, I figured something a little less expensive might
be in order...

Enter LubroMoly. I got turned on to their products a long time ago by
IPD, back when I had this fire-breathing Volvo 242 GT. Liked the products
and thought I remembered an injector cleaner kit. Quick check of a few
catalogs and yup, there it is: a cleaner kit for CIS and L-jet systems.
And funny thing, Performance Products had it on sale at the time for
pretty cheap.

Basicly, you disconnect the fuel pump (pull the relay or something) then
hook this stuff up to the fuel rail, and run the car until it stops running.
Then you put everything back, and you're done. Takes about 45 mintues all
told. Makes a HUGE difference in the way the car runs.

The basic kit has banjo and threaded fittings for Bosch CIS, and a barbed
hose fitting for L-jet. Getting that to work right takes a little imagination
and in my case, some spare hose -- but not too much since you have to fill
it with the contents of the can!

It's gotten hard to find the cans of stuff lately, but I can still order
them from out of state. Highly recommended.

Sand to the metal on all exterior panels, strip with rotary wire brush in any
suspect areas. Chemical dips and blasting have some problems. There *IS*
a place in San Antonio that has a process where they dip the whole car,
then dip in neutralizer, then hot galvanize  what's left. Great for those

Hi Lee,

Thanks for the reminder....yeah, I read the can a long time ago
and it mentioned something about compatibility with paints - back
then I figured I'd hunt down something compatible to spray
overtop.  Paint sealers are available for when you have an old layer
of paint on the car you don't want to strip and you think it'll react
with the new top coat you are about to apply.  Simply spray the
sealer over the old "reactive" stuff and it's like having a base
of neutral metal to paint the new stuff on.

By the way, I'm just starting this procedure.  I've used a wire
cup on a grinder to strip the inner rockers and have sprayed
the zinc on to stop rust from forming.  That's all so far.

I like zinc....it's my friend.  How much zinc is in the DP-90 stuff?

Subject: Carrera vacuum leak

I figured I pass this on to you Carrera Owners:

If I remember correctly, there was a thread a few months ago on slight
hesitation at mid-rpm level on Carrera models (MY 84>). I don't recall
if a solution was ever found...

I also noticed a slight hesitation in 5th at about 2800 RPM. Never thought
much of it.

Last night, while doing some checking around, I think I found the problem.
I found a vacuum hose that was dry rotted. The hose seems to connect a vac
port from one side of the throttle to the other. Now, the deal is that it
cannot be seen unless you look really hard!

I first noticed that there was a slight cut where the hose met the manifold
port. So I decided to pull it out and change it. After pulling it out, I
noticed that it was all cracked, allowing all kinds of air to bypass the
FI metering unit. I replaced it with a piece of vacuum hose I had.

Here's how to find it. Look at the connection where the accelerator pedal
meets the throttle body. You can also follow the cruise control cable.
Directly to the right of the junction (butterfly inside TB) and behind it,
you will see a hose that connects to the TB. The hose is preformed and curved
Its about 1/4" in diameter.  About 2" in lenght and with a curvature of about 1"
I'm sure there is part number for it (Any one out there...?).  I just made
sure that my replacement hose was long enough not to crease it. About 5".
Look hard, its there...

I think this has solved my problem at 2.8K rpm. And the car seems to idle
much better. It might be worth checking in your car. My car is an 84, so
it has been around for 10 years. And NJ is really not that hot all the time
as let's say CA or TX. Hope this helps...

I just put my "new" '86 911 through inspection at a local gas station

Of course, one of the front wheels had to come off during this exercise.
(Damn those lugs nuts are light!) The steering wheel was rock solid before

1) are 911 wheels balanced while mounted?
2) is the fact that the steering wheel now shakes indicative of an

HI Y'all!

	I have a question about maintenance for 911 Turbos vs. 911 Carreras.
I know (at least think...I never know :) ) that you need to get a service
every 15K miles in a Carrera (3.2 litre).  Is it the same for the 3.6's (non-
turbo).

	Also, what are the maintenance differences between say an '88 
911 Carrera  and a turbo of the same year.  Does a turbo bring any differences
to the 15K services?  What kind of maintenance does the turbo bring itself?

	I have friends with other turbo cars (Japanese), and they have had no
turbo problems at up to 60K miles.  Can I expect the same from
an ''87 or '88 911 Turbo?

	Thanks a bunch,

Can be, but should not make a difference, unless the rotors are unbalanced
(which should not be the case...)

A steering wheel should not shake.  The problem might be one of several
things:

a) a bent wheel
2) a tire that is not round
III) a wheel/tire combination that is out of balance
D) a Tire that has delaminated (i.e. the belts have come loose inside the
   tire, causing a hump on the tread.)

> 3) is there some special knowledge required to balance 911 front wheels?
>    (i.e. can any shop do it or is it a Porsche Dealer Only Operation?)
> 

There is no special knowledge, just a good, well calibrated dynamic balancer
that is operated by someone who cares about the end result.

Most balance problems are caused by machines that are out of calibration and
by idiots who cannot put wheel weights where the machine tells them to.

Since your steering wheel did not shake before, and does shake now, I would
inspect the one wheel which was removed for the following:

a) evidence that a wheel weight was recently removed or knocked off.
b) an indication that the wheel is not properly attached to the hub, or that
there is some foreign matter that is not allowing the wheel to seat properly.
c) evidence of a wheel being bent or a tire out of round.

The last thing that you might try is relocating the wheel/tire combination
rotationally on the hub (i.e. mark the location of the wheel on the hub,
remove it, rotate it clockwise one fifth of a turn (72 degrees) and
reinstall it, torquing the lug nuts to 96 lb-ft) and taking a test drive to
see if something has changed.  

It is possible that the location of the wheel on that particular hub makes a
difference. Not likely, but possible.

If all else fails, pour 5 gallons of gasoline in the interior and light a
match...

A) Your vibration (I assume that it is a vibration in the steering wheel at
idle that goes away with higher RPMs) is most likely your passenger side
motor mount.  If you did your steering rack yourself, the motormount is a
piece of cake.

B) Cheaper manuals can be had from any of the larger aftermarket places that
advertise in Porsche Panorama (don't ask me for the names; if you're not a
member of the Porsche Club, you don't deserve to know the information)

c) There is a special timing belt tension tool (also used for the balance
shaft belt and alternator belt) that is necessary.  Don't try the job
without the tool.  

d) In order to do the balance shaft seals, you also will need the balance
shaft sprocket spanner and the flywheel lock tool.

If you don't have the tools to do it right, and/or don't have the factory
manuals in order to know the right settings and torque settings for the job,
just take it to someone who can show you the tools he is going to use.

You can either spend $600 for someone else to do it, or you can spend $600
and have the tools for yourself when you are done doing the job yourself.

(I got into this business by following the motto: "I would rather spend
$1000 on tools than $1000 on a mechanic...)

Subject: Emission test

I just had my 87 911 smog checked. It passed with what seem to me to be low
numbers: HC=2 of an allowable 200, CO=.04 of an allowable 1.2. I cant remeber
if this was at idle or at 2500 RPM but the ratios were roughly the same. I
waited to the last minute and had to have this done by a mechanic (i am being
genorous here) who did not appear all too bright. While the test was
underway, the machine flashed up a message that said DILUTION. When the test
was complete, the O2 level read 1.8% and the mechanic claimed that I must
have an exhaust leak because "the dilution warning means the O2 level is not
0% so you must have an exhaust leak" (probably not an accurate quote but you
get the idea). He also said that the O2 level can be as high as 20% before
you fail. I'm sure the O2 level should not be 0% and I am reasonably sure
that I don't have an exhaust leak - what shoud the O2 level be? what does
this mean?

The 904 was a frequent sight at those races around 1966.  It was built as a
race car and was quite successful.

To my eyes it was a *very* pretty car.

Then a few years later I saw a large group of 908s at the Nurburgring.  That
was a sight!!  (I was in the pits working on a Sunbeam Tiger crew.)  The 908

Subject: Questions from a new 911 owner.... ;-)



Hey, now that I have my car, I can ask some real questions !!! :)

I have my 83SC sitting sleeping in my garage, and since its winter 
outside, I will start to do some maintenance and detailing. I have 
looked over some of the old archives, and have some questions:

1) Has anyone posted a good summary of the maintenance schedule for the 911?
   For instance, how often should I change the fuel filter? Some of these
   details are in the Warranty and Maintenance Guide, but I have found that
   lots of details are missing. A checklist would be nice.
   
2) The guide recommends oil changes at 15000 miles. I plan to do it every
   3000 miles with dino oil. Oil is cheap, and the engine isn`t. Is this
   overkill? Kinda afraid to switch to synthetic since I don't know about the 
   oil consumption on this 911, and hate to see that $6/litre oil go up in
   the air. Also a little afraid of the reports of "new" leaks occuring when
   switching to synthetics on old cars. And how do you get the oil filter out
   without spilling oil over everything?

3) I am going to flush the brake fluid. Any recommendations on the type 
   of fluid (ie. brand or dot level)? I have flushed other cars (hondas,
   nissans, american cars). Any gotchas, or is it the standard around the
   car until you have bled a couple of litres of fluid out?

4) Did anyone come up with a conclusion on the best oil filters? The previous
   owners would by Porsche oil filters from the dealer at $28 a pop. I have
   always used Fram filters in my Japanese metals, but am not sure if they
   are "good" enough for the 911. Comments?

5) My car is schwarz metallic, which is basically dark metallic grey. The pain 
   has lots of little scratches all over. Not noticable unless you look real
   close. Is it worth trying to buff them out? How exactly would you do this?

6) Looking under the car, I noticed that there is sand/dirt from road spray 
   inside all the wheel wells, and under the car. Is it worth washing this
   out, or am I asking for trouble? Should I use a steam cleaner, or pressure
   washer, or stick to the safer garden hose? I don't want to start damage in 
   areas where no damage exists.

7) Any recommended leather/vinyl treatments. The back deck (below the back 
   window) is very dry. The seats are not bad but need leather treatment.

Well, I could go on and on, but I think that that is enough for now ;-)

Thanks in advance.

Howdy,

Here is an update on the new SCCA rules, and some other info.

I friend of mine in Connecticut (Brian Moran) bought one of these '88 cars
without knowing what it was. It is not really a "club sport", but a couple
of options packages : The M030 suspension (stiffer springs, swaybars,
adjustable front spring perch and Koni sport shocks) and the 756 "delete"
package. This deletes power windows, sunroof, passenger side mirror,
rear deck wiper, and AC. It also adds a nicer radio, leather wheel, 7"
wide rear wheels, and mud flaps(!). 500 were made, maybe all black
or half white, as a kind of "commemorative package" according to PCNA.
They did not come standard with limited slip, and most had the sunroof
and AC added back.

It seems that some Porsche dealers ordered the 756 option to get some
cars on the lot at lower prices! They were cheaper because of roll-up
windows, no a/c, etc. One guy in Connecticut bought THREE 924S/M030
cars from a dealer's lot for each of his children, with no idea of
the performance option (just because they were cheaper).

Thanks for pointing this out. The SCCA makes so many proposals and
re-proposals and then they go before the Board of directors... it's
always very confusing (and in small print in FasTrack). Its strange
that the ride height rule deletion did not even appear in any recent
FasTrack. The October FasTrack made it sound like the stock class
moving (914 2.0 CS->AS, 924S/944 w/ M030 option CS->BS, 914 1.7/1.8
DS->CS) would be done as a "Package" (their term, not mine).

** 09-DEC-94 Update

	I talked to Jim Leithauser from SCCA today, and the rule change
is as you thought : the 914 2.0 and 924S/944 M030 stay in CS, but the
914 1.7/1.8 moved from DS to CS. Also, the ride height rule 13.8 was
dropped, so it is legal for us to lower any cars which are factory
adjustable.

The 15" advantage is a good point. I have proven that 15" wheels are 
significantly faster than 16" wheels on an '86 Carrera. I wonder if this
advantage would outweigh the '89 torque advantage??
Is your car "CS" a Club Sport, or C-Stock? If a club sport, what is
the difference?

Hi, Fred,

I have to admit that, at my very first driver ed event at Lime Rock Park,
my instructor was driving a 904.  During my stints at the wheel, he just
couldn't get it through to me how the corners at big bend and the esses all
flowed together into one big serpentine group.

So, he insisted that I ride with him in his 904.  I still remember his
telling me to put my feet on the battery and put my right arm down into the
door pocket and off we went.

At the time, I didn't know what kind of a treat was in store.  The car was a
rocket.  My weight in the passenger seat was enough to cause the right front
tire to rub on the fender.

Haven't seen a 904 at a track event since (that was 1986, at a Schattenbaum
event at Lime Rock Park...)

If you get a chance for a ride, don't turn it down...

Hey Wayne,

Ihave a '73 911T with an '83 SC engine and I got the microfiche
for '72-'83 at the local Porsche dealership for <$20. I don't
know if they have the '84s and later on fiche, but it would be worth it
to check. Also, the local dealership here sells the factory manuals
cheaper than any of the mail order houses and gives a 10% PCA discount
to boot. It may be worth your while to check the prices at your
local dealership; it won't be used prices but it may still be reasonable.
YMMV.

Subject: 914 woes (revisited)


IS there a way to test the injectors for fault?

My 914 is insane.  It is hesitating, and you can see bubbles in the 
fuel return line (the one on the way back to the tank).  I've replaced 
the fuel pump and the HTC, so I know it's not those.

Any ideas?  I suspect that an injector may be stuck open, and occasionally
working properly.  Since it will sometimes only run on 3 cylinders, and
other times it seems to just "lose" fuel.  I would imagine that a 
stuck injector would suck all of the fuel out of the line, causing the
bubbles, while at the same time flooding out the cylinder and restricting
fuel to the other 3 (or all of the downstream neighbors).

Since I don't claim to know sh*t about my Porsche's fuel injection
system, can anyone help me out?


(BTW - the main entry feed line is full of gas, so I know the gas is at
least getting to the first injector.  After that, I dunno.  Maybe a 
plugged line?)

Thanks in advance

I like to use a suction device and remove all the fluid from the reservoir
before starting the mondo-flush. I also (now) like very much to use the
Eezibleed (evaluation written up months ago in my brake job from hell
note), since it makes it go much faster.

There is all sorts of talk about the "hot" brakefluid -- Ford Heavy Duty,
AP-550, etc. -- but I still use Castrol LMA GT (*NOT* plain LMA!). Works
good, and since I flush the system after track days, I've never had any
trouble with it.

You can buy the OEM filters from Zimm's for about $8 a pop instead of
paying dealer prices, but *DO NOT* use Fram, AC, Delco or anything else.
The German Purolator and Mann filters built to Porsche spec are the only
thing you can reliably use. I've *blown up* Frams, not to mention the fact
that they don't have the right bypass valving...

Use the high pressure spray at a self-service carwash.  Once you have the
big stuff off, it may be worth going at it with a bucket of soapy water
and a toilet brush.  (Oooops. I forget -- I'm not supposed to know anything 
about *cleaning* cars... 8{) )

Here's what I use on my '83 911SC:

1)  Fuel filter, every 12,000 miles.  Use only factory filter.  Adjust valves 
every 6000 miles.
2)  Mobil 1 15/50W synthetic. No leaks. Change 3000-6000 miles depending on 
laziness and budget.  Costs $3.29/quart where I am.  Put a couple of paper shop 
towels under the filter before removing.
3)  Same as any other car.  I use Castol LMA.
4)  I use only the factory filter.  It has a special valve that dumps if the 
filter becomes blocked.  It won't cost $28 if you mail order from Imparts or 
Zims.  Less than $10 is about right.

7) "Black Again" and "Something Else" for vinyl/rubber.  "Hide Food" for leather
or Lexol.

Hey, now that I have my car, I can ask some real questions !!! :)

I have my 83SC sitting sleeping in my garage, and since its winter 
outside, I will start to do some maintenance and detailing. I have 
looked over some of the old archives, and have some questions:

1) Has anyone posted a good summary of the maintenance schedule for the 911?
   For instance, how often should I change the fuel filter? Some of these 
   details are in the Warranty and Maintenance Guide, but I have found that 
   lots of details are missing. A checklist would be nice.

2) The guide recommends oil changes at 15000 miles. I plan to do it every
   3000 miles with dino oil. Oil is cheap, and the engine isn`t. Is this 
   overkill? Kinda afraid to switch to synthetic since I don't know about the 
   oil consumption on this 911, and hate to see that $6/litre oil go up in the 
   air. Also a little afraid of the reports of "new" leaks occuring when 
   switching to synthetics on old cars. And how do you get the oil filter out 
   without spilling oil over everything?

3) I am going to flush the brake fluid. Any recommendations on the type 
   of fluid (ie. brand or dot level)? I have flushed other cars (hondas, 
   nissans, american cars). Any gotchas, or is it the standard around the 
   car until you have bled a couple of litres of fluid out?

4) Did anyone come up with a conclusion on the best oil filters? The previous
   owners would by Porsche oil filters from the dealer at $28 a pop. I have 
   always used Fram filters in my Japanese metals, but am not sure if they 
   are "good" enough for the 911. Comments?

5) My car is schwarz metallic, which is basically dark metallic grey. The pain 
   has lots of little scratches all over. Not noticable unless you look real 
   close. Is it worth trying to buff them out? How exactly would you do this?

6) Looking under the car, I noticed that there is sand/dirt from road spray 
   inside all the wheel wells, and under the car. Is it worth washing this 
   out, or am I asking for trouble? Should I use a steam cleaner, or pressure 
   washer, or stick to the safer garden hose? I don't want to start damage in 
   areas where no damage exists.

7) Any recommended leather/vinyl treatments. The back deck (below the back 
   window) is very dry. The seats are not bad but need leather treatment.

Well, I could go on and on, but I think that that is enough for now ;-)

Thanks in advance.

Being in the Chicagoland area (Naperville), I can add some info on places
in the suburbs.  They place I used to finish welding in my pans has gone
off to Idaho, but, here's some places I'd recommend:

1.  Redi-Strip in Rosell, IL (708-529-2442) will take your car in
a totally stripped down state and either media blast or "dip" you car
to remove all paint, undercoating, rust, etc.  The car is covered in a
light water soluable solution to preserve the fresh metal until you
can wash/dry the metal and immediately primer.  They are great, helpful,
can unload your car from a flat bed truck, and do a great job.
Dont have to remove the wiring harnes/rubber since its not affected.

Dont go to the Joliet Redi-Strip, if you want details, I'll share them
privately.


2.  AAAA Towing (Naperville, 708-420-1426) is great to move your rolling
chassis around and understand you watching over them the whole
time like a nervious owner that you are.

3.  Gengler Sheet Metal, Aurora, IL (708-898-8790) will take a piece
of sheet metal you cut out of your car and reproduce it for you.  They
custom made new inner rails for the luggage areas and other various
pieces of metal I couldnt either buy or were beyond my budget.  They
are VERY reasonably priced, I felt guilty paying them so little (at
least until I left their parking lot).

4.  Crest Auto, Crestwood, IL.  Don, their machinist, has removed
more stubborn bolts/nuts/suspension bushings/misc that were rusted
beyond my abilities to get loose or drilled out.  He has pressed in
my new suspension bushings and takes great pride in doing a perfect
job.  He'll sand blash small parts and other stuff.  The price is
always $20.00 even though he has admitted to spending half the
day putting on something I brought in for him.  He's done stuff
other Chicagoland machine shops refused to work on.

5.  Riggs Brothers, Downer's Grove, IL (708-852-2434) does interior
work.  They (for $100) recovered my '66 912 dash board beautifully.
When we couldnt figure out how to punch in the holes in the fabric
to match the original, they loaned me the equipment over the weekend
to punch the 100+ holes myself and then they installed the new fabric.
Great place.  They do headliners, etc....

6.  Becker's Auto/GoodYear (Naperville, IL) Suspension setting (racing
or street), general maint, 356s to the latest stuff.  They are reputable,
professional, race 944s themselves, and are Porsche fanatics.  I have
several   friends who swear by the great work they do.  I've had
them clean/fix/polish my alloys, $80/wheel, and they are perfect.

7.  Got lots more contacts of painting places, various people to
do different kinds of stuff, am willing to trade more Chicagoland
info to a subset of folks if interested.  Beers over the holidays
is a nice idea.....

Just curious, but do your valves *need* adjustment after 6000 miles?  I
seem to have read somewhere that 911 valve adjustments are pretty
"stable".  I'm about to undertake the valve adjustment thing on my 911
for the first time (first time on a 911, not the first time for me) and 
have a game plan of "check and adjust if necessary".  Sound reasonable?

As always, preceed everything I say with "Correct me if I'm wrong..."

Subject: Re: 911 Shifter unattached problem

Have you had any transmission work done lateley?  There is an index
pin (or something) that can be put in upside down that will cause
the gearbox to go into gear and not come out.  (This happened to
me on a 74 911 that I bought last year.)  Apparently the pin will
drop out after a while.  My mechanic (Don Jackson Enterprises in
Phoenix -- highly recommended!) told me that this was not an
uncommon problem with work done by people who haven't done much
transmission work.  I'm afraid I can't be more specific about the
part in question, but I approach gearboxes with fear and loathing.
I'm sure one of the other Porschephilers could give you more
details.  Correcting the problem is labor intensive, as the gearbox
needs to be pulled apart, but the only parts required were the
appropreate gaskets.  If you had work done on it, I would think
the shop would eat the costs.  In my case, the car had come like that
from the previous owner, so I ended up pulling the engine/gearbox in
the driveway and carried the transmission to Dons to be corrected.
It only took a couple of hours for him to fix it.

The only linkage to check would be in the tunnel behind the seats, but
if that comes loose the shifter moves freely.  Good luck.

Subject: Bad noise update 66 911

 Last night I did a little more work on my 911. Drained the oil and decided
to take a look at the oil screen. Good thing I had a screen! It kept those
1/4 pieces of aluminum from ruining my oil pump ;-0. I found what looked like
part of a wrist pin, part of an oil ring and part of a piston. So I guess it 
is time to remove it for rebuilding. Should I go stock? The vehicle is for 
street use. Any hints, sugestions or tips? It's my hope that I still have a 
good case and crank. This will be the determining factor in whether I rebuild
this one or by a used one. I have found Engine Rebuilders Supply Co has a 
rebuild kit for about 2k for the 2.0. I figure that if I go to a 2.2 then
I have a cost of about $600 more. This is aside from shop costs and the fact 
that I am not familiar with what I am doing (as far as changing specs.) 
Well, I'm about 20 min from having the motor and trans out...so off to work 
I go.

You know, in the past I have left valves unadjusted for 9000 miles.  I'll do it 
at 6000 miles if the valves pass the audible test, i.e. sound noisy.  It'll bug 
me enough to get down and do it at 6000 miles.  My 911 is a pretty high mileage 
one, with 182K miles and I don't know if the valves go out of spec any quicker 
because of this.  My guess is that they don't.

Yeah, I guess "check and adjust if necessary" is reasonable.  Are you going to 
do it with a feeler gauge only or with a dial gauge as well?

Just curious, but do your valves *need* adjustment after 6000 miles?  I 
seem to have read somewhere that 911 valve adjustments are pretty 
"stable".  I'm about to undertake the valve adjustment thing on my 911 
for the first time (first time on a 911, not the first time for me) and 
have a game plan of "check and adjust if necessary".  Sound reasonable?

There were no fuel, oil or vacumn lines when I purchased the car, so
I really didn't notice when stripping down the engine.  Any information

Subject: 911 parts and info needed

Fellow Philes,

I recently was the victim of the most terrible crime imaginable for a Porsche
owner. My perfectly restored '67 912 was stolen.

Fortunately the car was recovered but the SOBs that took it rape and pillaged
the engine, trans, rear suspension and all the brakes. The car is worth (to
me at lesast) rebuilding but since the heart and soul has been stolen I am
looking at rebuilding her with the heart and soul of a 911. I loved the 4
cylinder but if I'm going to rebuild her I'm ready for a little more power.

My questions are these:

1. Besides the moving of the motor mounts backwards for the 911 engine, are
there any other mods that will require a torch?

2. Does any one have the following for sale:
A. 911 engine and trans (any size or year).
B. Brakes and rear suspension that will fit or can be converted to fit a 67
912.
C. Perhaps a complete 911 for parts.
I'm in the Knoxville, TN area but love road trips for Porsche parts so
distance is not an issue to me.

3. Any tips or helpful insight that will help in this conversion. Any
information pro or con will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve Smith

Subject: 930 Oil Leak: Sources??

My '84 930 is leaking oil from what appears to be the junction between the
rear of the LH cylinder head and the timing case.

Before I pull the engine, any other sources I should check which would result
in oil appearing in this area?

By the way, I have replaced the turbo oil feed line, the oil return tubes, as
well as other oil lines in an attempt to gain an oil tight engine. It has
about 60K miles and otherwise runs great.

Does anyone out there in Porschephiles land have experience with the VW
Vanagon "Waterboxer " engine?

I recently bought an ' 85 Westfalia camper as a winter fix up project. The
previous owner had trouble with combustion leaks into the cooling system, and
had repairs made a couple of times which didn't last. The engine has about
64K miles on it, and seems to run all right otherwise.The chassis has 124K
miles on it.

Does it need new heads and barrels, or just a can of good 'ol Bars Leaks? Is
the bottom end durable on these things? Is there a VW mechanical update which
applies? Can the heads be flycut, like a Porsche?

On the transaxle, the LH CV drive plate seal is seeping. Checking further,
the plate wobbles just a little. Should it be replaced with the seal, or are
the drive splines on the (differential case?) irreparably worn? Any other
ideas?

Thanks,

Subject: 928 fuses.

Lately, I have been blowing fuses in my 84 928S.  The fuse I blow is #23.
This is for the interior lights and clock.  When it blows, my interior 
lights go out and the door chime begins to go off.  The chime does not 
stop until I either put a new fuse in or turn the car off.

This is no big deal.  I can fix this problem with a little time.  I do 
have one thing that is really bugging me.  I have no fuse in slot #22.  
This is the fuse for the fuel pumps.  What I am concerned about is how 
the car start/runs with no power to the fuel pumps?  Has anyone seen this 
before?  My car has an aftermarket stereo and an aftermarket alarm.  I am 
pretty sure the people that put in the stereo and alarm did not do it too 
well as it looks pretty sloppy.  Oh, I also do not have a fuse for the 
brake lights #10.  The brake lights DO work though.  

Anyone have any comments?

BTW: This car is excellent for long trips.

Subject: Re: 914 woes

Hi, I saw your message about 914 fuel injection problems.

If it is a 2.0L, here are a few things to look for: The electrical 
connection to any injector might be loose or detached. After one came
loose during a track day, I very carefully plugged each one in and made 
sure that the rubber grommet that covers it was very tight.

Are any of the injectors leaking fuel? Just underneath it? If so, it 
needs replacement. I replaced all of mine after I found that one was 
leaking a lot, and one was seeping fuel. Also ALL of the fuel injector 
rubber seals (2 each) were very old and very dry, and they were replaced 
at the same time. I get great mileage now, much smoother and quieter 
running, and I am not leaking fuel. Took me 1 hour and I never did it 
before and I am not super experienced. Injectors cost $50-60 each, come 
with fuel hose attached.

This needs equipment for testing, the distributor has extra 
points for the fuel injector electrics. These might be bad. It might just 
pay to replace these if the injectors aren;t leaking and the seals arent 
too old.

What about the fuel pressure sensor? I think this is the part on the 
right (looking forward) near the battery; has a long flat electrical plug 
into it. Just over the decel valve near the battery. Is it plugged in? I 
am not sure how to test it, but if all other parts I've mentioned work, 
this could be the culprit. (you will need to detach this to get at the 2 
right-side injectors most easily.)

Good luck.

Mark

Subject: 944 idle problem

I've got an idle problem that perhaps someone out there can help
diagnose.  My car is an 85/II 944.  When the car is cold, it will
at times idle abnormally high.  Say, around 1300 rpm (per
the dash tach).  As the engine warms up, the idle speed will increase
to around 1800 rpm.  At that point, the idle begins to oscillate
between 1300 and 1800 rpm, maybe at a rate of about once per second.

If I drive it long enough, it reverts to a proper idle.  Or, once
the engine is good and warm, if I park the car for 5 or 10 minutes,
it will idle properly when I start it.

This only happens when the weather is cold.  I know the problem is
heat related: I first experienced it two winters ago.  I was never
able to get my mechanic to experience the problem (it doesn't happen
every time I start the car cold).  As winter became summer, the
problem went away.  Then last winter it happened a few times, and
I was once again unsuccessful in getting it taken care of.  Last
summer, no problem.  Now it's back again.

Any ideas?

Hello all of you,


I'm sorry of replying so late to the people who want to know the references of
the magazine I was talking about.

It's a french one, nammed `Moto revue' #3162.  Its ISBN # is M2163-3162 and costs
18 French Francs (about $US 3).  I think it might be difficult to find it in US.

I will ask them if I can be allowed to scan one of their picture as send it to
anyone who want it.  But I don't espect them any answer before '95 !

Here is the *abstract* of their article (I assume I can *summerize* it without
violating any copyright laws !?).

`` Porsche engineers are working on a new bike that should be sell in 1996 or
1997.  By the past, Porsche had worked for other bikes-builders.  Many years ago,
the Yamaha XS750 transmission was designed by them.  They had also designed a
water-cooled V4 motor for Harley-Davidson.  They work with Honda and Yamaha engi-
neers to make the HD's Evolution motor less polluant.  Researchs still continue.

The bike was designed from scratch and should be sell as a Porsche product. It's 
a  hich-tech bike: 4 cylinders, 5 valves per cylinder, 1.2 liters, 140 HP, Anti
Skating, ABS, catalizer, ultra aerodynamic shape, variable valve timing,
tiptronic-like gear-box, computer drived shocks and the front brake plate is on
the rim (more surface to cool the brake).

It was designed first to have oval cylinders, but it's too costly.  Even for a
Porsche !  Although, due to the very-high end technology and performance, the
price should be very expensive.''


I hope that my english is OK.  I hope I will be allowed to send a scanned file of
this *beautiful* bike.  We'll see that next year.

I've found that that if I rinse the car with the spray nozzle removed

Subject: 924 rear end noise !!??

Hello Porschephiliacs,

	My '77 924 is having a WEIRD problem in the right rear wheel.  
For the last few months the locknut on the drum has been working its way 
loose. I tighten it to specs but it loosens again!  The cotter pin is 
still there & in good shape, but it works loose anyhow. Recently a weird 
noise that sounds like a wind whistling through the trees (REALLY!) has 
been coming from the rear wheel.  A mechanic friend says its probably the 
wheel bearing or the splines on the drum are worn out.  I know what a bad 
bearing sounds like & this is different, so maybe its the drum splines. 
Any ideas would be appreciated.  Maybe VW people would know more about 
this part, what is the address of the best VW list?  I need to know soon, 
I'm about to embark on (what my friends consider) one of my crazy long 
trips in my 18 year old car.  THANXXXX!!! :^)

I saw a real live 959 in USA
 
Hi, Sidak.
 
While I was at Porsche I showed a furniture manufacturer from NC around
Weissach. I think his name was Hendricks or Henderson. (Larry Hendricks
maybe? For some reason that name sticks in my mind). He was really eager
to get a 959. Maybe he got his wish. Can you ask the shop if that
name/description matches? If so, after 8 years or so, I should get in touch
with him and congratulate him. I didn't think he would be able to pull it
off.
 
There is at least one other car running around, a silver one in the Bay
Area, owned by a doctor I think. He has it serviced at Andial in Santa Ana
down in Orange County.
 
A friend at a car manufacturer's R&D facility here in the L.A. area says there
is yet another around here that isn't really legally allowed out on the
roads but the owner apparently puts plates on it from one of his other
Porsches and takes it out anyway. The Feds are apparently looking to catch
him at it.
 
Bill Gates of Microsquish (apologies to "Outland") apparently has one, sort
of. U.S. Customs lets him look at it every now and then, in impound.
 
Otis Chandler allegedly built a whole automotive museum in order to get an
excuse to bring one in.
 
There was a cover story in "Excellence" a few years ago (Aug 91) proclaiming
"FIRST U.S. LEGAL RACING 959" on the cover, but that's total BS, there never
was any place for the thing to race. No sanctioning body ever allowed it in,
certainly not IMSA for GTO as the article claims.

Nothing personal, but sending credit card numbers VIA E-MAIL to ANYONE is
still _NOT_ A GOOD IDEA.  Even if the intended recipient is a legitimate
sales organization, there are _no_ guarantees that your e-mail is not
being read by third parties. Think of it as being a little like giving out
your card number over the 'phone... while you're talking on a party line. 
And encryption does not validate the recipient.

This assumes validated keys which is _not_ a given.  Suffice it to say,
there are still authentication issues remaining.  And as this is neither,
uh, germane nor german, i'd suggest we take further discussion off the list.

Hi, Pete,

Yes, there is currently one in New Jersey, having been recently been 
delivered there from Ohio, where it was wrecked on the owner's estate.

Seems that he has enough property to be able to drive the 959 at speed, but 
screwed up and backed it into a tree.

The fixer (who shall remain nameless) is looking for another 959 to take 
measurements for straightening the chassis.  Seems that it is different 
from any 911 or Carrera 2 he has seen to date, and he has seen a few.

BTW, it's guards red...

Oh, and the fixer is documenting the fix with lots of pictures for an 
eventual article in Panorama, and perhaps a presentation at the Zone

I agree with this warning as well, and I accept VISA/MC for Porsche Market

My '84 930 is leaking oil from what appears to be the junction between the
rear of the LH cylinder head and the timing case.

Before I pull the engine, any other sources I should check which would result
in oil appearing in this area?

By the way, I have replaced the turbo oil feed line, the oil return tubes, as
well as other oil lines in an attempt to gain an oil tight engine. It has
about 60K miles and otherwise runs great.

 just purchased a 1980 928.  He says "Wow, aren't those supposed to be the best
 production car ever built?"  I laughed and asked him where he had heard that.
 He said he couldn't remember, but that he recalls hearing that when someone pu
t all the stats together for all cars in production and asked a computer or som
ething which was the best all around car, it spit out the 928.  I love my 928,
but best car in the world is stretching it.  Does anyone have any idea what thi

    It was restored some years ago by the owner from a correct

    I have agreed to help him with as much advice as I can and to  
help him agree on a price. 
    If the description is correct then it is a very interesting  
possibility, and he can be assured getting it at less than market  
price. 
    Not much to go on yet but... anyone any idea of full market value  
for this car? 
    Later I may have some technical questions. 
    Can anyone help? TIA

Clearly the value of the vehicle in question is dependent on the model and the 
condition. 
 
For comparison the going prices of 1955 vintage Speedsters listed in the "Cars 
for Sale" section of the most recent issue of the 356 Registry are listed 
below  (copy abbreviated): 
 
   o  '54 Speedster - "Runs. Needs restoration." $10,000 
 
   o  '55 Speedster - "'94 PCA Parade concours winner." $68,000 
 
   o  '56 Speedster - "Restored." $35,000 
 
   o  '57 Speedster - "Rebuilt everything; needs interior/top and assembly 
with        correct new trim and other parts to complete." $38,500 
 
There are two more Speedsters of similar vintages listed with prices at 
$67,500 and $72,500. 
 
Clearly your collegue is going to need some expert assistance to make an

Subject: Help: Buying an old Porsche (long!)



Hello,


Here we are.  Christmas again, as every December.  What shall I have for a gift?
What about a Porsche ???

I'm giving up the idea of buying a Euro 928 in US.  It's simply too costly for me.
May be buying an old Porsche to rebuild it should be a good solution?

I know a french '83 928S, 15kms far away from my parents' home.  It belongs to an
old lady (I assume she's 75).  The beast had belonged to his husband.  He died 2
years ago and since this day, the car is parked outside and hadn't moved at all.

The weather is not a californian-like.  Usually, there is 5 days of snow per
winter and a lot of water during spring and fall.

I was not alowed by the old lady to see the car in all the details.  The visit
was *short* (10 minutes).  Let me describe you what I saw.

The car does not seems to have rust.  Does not seems to have been involded in a
crash.  When I oppened the door, it made a lot of noise but inside it didn't smelt
water at all.  Every stuff of the dash-board is there, even the radio (a
Blaupunkt!).  It have 128000 kms. There is the same key for all the doors and the
motor.  It have black leather, AC, power-windows.  There is no sun-roof, no power-
seats.

There is a 5-speed gear-box.  I can move it without making any noise.

When I gently push the brake, it seems to works (very hard to explain in english
but it made me the same impression as if I push the brakes on my BMW I use
everyday).

Leather is in a good condition, but 2 years under the summer sunlight is a bad
thing for inside.  Everything seems to be gray, not dark.

The car was parked near trees.  I didn't saw the back of the car.  Seems to be
there and OK :-)

Outside : the brakes plates are dead.  It haves 16'' wheels, no corrosion on
them.  All tires are ok, but I assume I will have to change them.  Battery is dead,
I can't check the lights.

Of course, I can't start the motor.  I didn't want too.  I think launching it
after 2 years of stop could be the best way to brake it.

I opened the motor hood.  There is still oil.  It's black oil.  I assume that the
car wasn't stored with a broken motor and then filled up with new oil.

No corrosion on the motor, but many spiders.  It looks like a small jungle.

The exhaust systems seems to be OK and is a nice place for the tiny critters who
have decided it was their home.

Then I had to leave.  That was all I saw.


The lady wants 120000 French Francs for it (yes, more than $US 20000) !!!  Of
course, I won't do that for such a price.  We will bargain, but I think that $5000
is a very good price for it.


The major problem is that she is *stubborn*.  I cannot take the car for half a day
into my favorite car-dealer to see exactly what's wrong with it.

The only think I can do is going back and have my own checking.  And then make an
offer.


Here is my questions:

1- What should I look ?  I will have 10 mins and no tools.

2- If I buy it, what should I espect to be dead.  Is it reasonnable to espect the
motor to be OK ?  Rebuildable ?  And what about A/C ?

3- I read that there is a society named 928 Internationnal.  Do they sell
after-market parts ?

4- Somebody talked about the `Project 928 articles'.  I can't understand the
meaning of the title.  Are they helpful articles to rebuilt a 928 ?


I thank in advance any help.  Of course, you'll have news about this story after
Chrismas.



Bye,

Pierre F-F.

On our '85 GTI (rear disk brakes), the mechanism to which the p-brake cables

Subject: CATS

Reason Porsche owners have cats is because we cannot afford anything else after
buying and maintaining one.  But, help might be on the way!!  Did any one see
the article about Porsche in the Dec. 5-11 issue of Autoweek.  Apparently for
the past 18 months Porsche has been developing a "people's car" for the Chinese
market.  Codenamed C88, this car, available in 3 different versions (2  door, 3
door, etc.), is powered by a 67 hp 1.1 liter four.  A little smaller than an
Escort, the C88 will ride on 15 in wheels.  For those ready to fax your order
to Porsche for one of these beasts, your engine choices are--1.1 liter gas  and
 1.6 liter Diesel. The gas engine will move you from 0-60 in, hold on to your
hats, 14 SECONDS!! WOW!! Top speed is estimated at 102 (I can do better than
that in my VW Golf), although roads in China aren't long enough for this to be
verified.  If the design is approved by the Chinese gov't, Porsche hopes to be
building 300,000 of these babies by 1996 in China.  Porsche is banking on this
beeing the next VW Beetle.  Whatever it takes to keep our beloved marque
afloat, right?

I was sipping a beer and leaned back against the car. The car
shifted sideways and fell off the jackstands. After I recovered from
the shock, I realized that I was ok, but I heard a glug-glug-glug
sound and smelled gas. The car had fallen on top of one of the jackstands
that was now on its side, and which had punched a hole in the gas tank.
Fortunately the garage was separate from the house, and didn't have
any appliances with open flames.

;  One day in high school auto shop, another group of guys had just finished 
doing a new input shaft bearing on the tranny in a '68 SS Chevelle 396. 
   When they dropped the car off the jackstands and started it up for the 
first time there was this horrendous clatter at rpm.  -It turned out they 
had left a small bottle jack under the engine pan while the trans was out. 
 They forgot to remove it before they lowered the car.  The result was a

Feh!
  I'm running my '73 914 2.0 4 EFI on a pressure sensor for a 1.7..!
Took time yesterday to scrub the paint off of my 'box o' parts' special and 
found the part number . . .
it ends with a 049.  I can tell you that a 2.0  will run with a 1.7 pressure 
sensor.  (it just acts funny)
It acts like the throttle is sticky, even though I am sure the butterfly is 
closing all the way and there are no vacuum leaks, bypass valve is OK, and 
throttle switch properly adjusted.  This is maddening in traffic when you 
want to leg it -then shift. <overrev>

  So I am in the market for at least one (possibly two) 0 280 100 037 
manifold pressure sensor
for a 1973 914  2.0 four.  (Bosch part number)

  I have tried a phone number for "Dealer Marketing" as shown in Feb. 1994's 
PANO (pg 102), but the
number is always busy.  These guys advertise in the classified's for EFI 
parts at or below dealer cost.   800.875.6911  in Bonita Beach, FLA.

  Anybody BTDT?  Is there such a thing as 'discount' EFI parts?  Gotta

Subject: Re: 914 newbie questions


Dear Greg,

Only California 1975 and 1976 914 models were equipped with a catalytic
converter. However, in anticipation of the Clean Air Act, Porsche completely
redesigned the heat exchanger system for all 914s to eventually wear a
converter. This exhaust system was of very poor design as all exhaust had to
be routed through one pipe (49 states) or catalytic converter (California).
The final muffler was low slung to fit and moisture accumulated in it,
rotting it out in as little as six months. On the heat exchanger side, the
sheath over the exhaust pipes coroded loose, exhaust manifolds warped and
finally the built-in branch tube at the front quickly rusted away to nothing
or fell off leaving the heat exchange totally unable to provide heat to the
car!

Subject: Re: heat exchangers (914, SS)


Dear Alan,

My friend John Danials at Stainless Systems maufactures the superb stainless
steel heat exchanger for the 914. They are such a work of art that they
should be hanging on your living room wall rather than being hidden away
under your 914! They are so well made that they will still be perfect long
after you and I are in our graves!

The interior diameter of tubing used for the stainless heat exchangers is
slight larger than the factory 2.0 and much smoother inside, hence the flow
is better. This directly affects low end power and when switching from early
3/8 diameter 1.7 heat exchangers to stainless, as much as a 5hp increase is
realized. This is the most! with the later 1.7, 1.8 and 2.0 factory to
stainless switch, some increase will be realized.

Testing was done early-on with stainless steel heat exchangers and a Bursch
muffler. Top end power with this combination was increased a maximum of 12hp
as the Bursch provided much less back pressure than the factory muffler and
with less back pressure, more top end power is realized.

The conclusion:  If you are planning on keeping your 914 forever and want the
hottest heat, buy stainless steel heat exchangers. If you want optimal power,
make them with a Bursch exhaust.

Subject: Re: some 914 ideas


Dear Nathan,

Great advances have been made in rust-proofing metal and now we can coat 914
metal so it will never rust again.

The best coating we have found is POR-15. It is rust conversion paint that
once dry will not come off. We spray factory color, polurethene paint over
this and have the toughest and best coating available. To the batter tray, we
add the acid absorbing battery mat and the larger battery cover.

The procedure for metal coating is as follows:
     1. Wire brush or sandblast
     2. Wash with metal ready rust remover
     3. Paint with POR 15
     4. Seam seal as needed
     5. Chip guard if needed
     6. Paint with factory match polyurethene paint

Only purchase fiberglass rocker panels if you are on a budget or need to save
weight for racing. They are cheaply made and are difficult to fit. Steel
rocker panels, on the other hand, help reinforce the chassis and fit
perfectly. My friend Bill at Lansing Steel manufactures an excellent set of
repro galvenized rocker panels. They are available anywhere for about 200 a
set. I highly encourage anyone who needs to replace the rocker panels to use
these.

ABS plastic rocker panel covers (with the raised Porsche lettering) were
designed to be used on top of the original steel, not to replace them. That
is why they are so flimsy.

Subject: Re: 914/911 clutch


The 914 virtually always had a 911 clutch assembly. The pressure plate and
throwout bearing were the same and the clutch disc was a 215mm variety,
either 4 spring, 5 spring or rubber centered. They have all been superceded,
now, to the four spring variety.

Several clutch assemblies will fit your 914, all using the same 911 type
throwout bearing:
     1. 911 T/914 type pressure plate with four spring 914 clutch disc
     2. 911T/914 type pressure plate with five spring 911T clutch disc
     3. 911T/914 type pressure plate with five spring VW bus clutch disc
     4. 911S aluminum pressure plate with 5 spring 911S clutch disc

It is important to note that with number four choice besides being
prohibitively expensive, the pressure plate is thicker than stock 914 and the
clutch disc is thinner. If you mix and match, you could end up with a clutch
that will not release or one that slips, so beware! The benefit of the 911s
aluminum set up, besides saving weight, is that it dissapates heat more
rapidly.

So, you can actually say you have a 911 clutch set up in your 914 and be
factual! (NOTE:  The 914-6 cares used a 911T setup, but the four cylinder
variety will fit this car also)

   There is supposed to be a gasket at the seam you mention (between the
 timing chain case and the head) where the cam comes thru (by "rear" of the
 engine I assume that you mean the crank-pulley end ?). The 2nd time I rebuilt
 my 911 engine (the first time the distributor pin fell into the case) I
 forgot that gasket altogether, but was able to replace it without removing
 the engine. Remove the muffler and the sheet metal around the rear, I don't
 remember the whole exercise being toooo painful, everything was pretty
 easy to get to and it saved a lot of effort over removing the engine.
   Of course you'll have to re-time that cam, but that isn't difficult.
 In case you haven't done cam timing, you'll need a crowfoot (about $70, it is
 important to get the 5-side one, 3-sided crowsfoots won't work), a dial-gauge
 and a holder, all available thru Performance Products (for one).

               Good luck- Lee

I think this is Cedar Rapids, though I don't recognize the 390 number.
This is probably the same car that has been for sale here all summer.
I talked to the owner earlier this summer and at that time she was asking
$20k for it.  She seems to have taken good care of it, but if I 
remember right it hasn't been driven at all for several years.
If anyone's interested, I'd go look at it.  

We seem to be in a real 951 slump here.  I know a local place 
(in Cedar Rapids) that had an '86 951 with 92k miles for sale most 
of this summer and fall. It started at $9500 and went down from 
there in price.  The last time I was by in early November and 
the car was finally gone.

   This gizmo is the Manifold Pressure sensor.  If it ain't connected,
the car won't run.  (BT,DT)  Or, rather, it'll run until the gas from
the cold start valve is burned (10 sec +) and then stall all at once.
    While you're checking the connections for the injectors, check the
connectors themselves--one went bad on my 1.8L and caused me no end of
problems.  The metal inside the connection would slide around--the 
thing would miss going over bumps and around some corners.  A verrry
frustrating intermittent problem!

Subject: 959 Racer


Pete,

There was one raced (?) at the Daytona 24 hour race under IMSA auspices. 
From all accounts, it was a turd to drive. It was red and I believe it 
is the same car Bruce Canepa sold to a guy up here in the bay area. I 
have a slide or two of it on display at Clairidge's for a Concours.

There is a funny story about a Doctor in Marin county with a Getty 959
facsimile. Seem Herb Caen, a local gossip columnist, made some remarks 
about an arrogant Doctor that smuggled in an illegal 959. Caen reported
that the guy had the nerve to drive it to the hospital where he worked in
rush hour traffic to rub everyone's nose in it. Well, what happened was 
that the Customs guys followed him and had the car impounded. It was 
quickly released when the Doctor's attorney produced all the registration
necessary to affirm that it started life as an 86 Carrera. Said Doctor 
declined to sue, stating that "too many people believe that dumb sh*t
columnist. THIS proves he doesn't know what he's talking about."

Studying the laws and all, it is possible to buy a 959, disassemble it, 
ship it here and carefully reassemble in steps to gain initial 
registration as a specially constructed vehicle. At least that's how
it works in California. As I've  said before, when you see some plastic
hot-rods that are legally registered, a Porsche is a piece of cake.

Years ago I used a Fram filter on my '70 Beetle after an oil
change.  When the engine got up to temp, the oil pressure
dropped to 10 psi at 3500 rpm!  I removed the Fram and installed
a Mann. Pressure stayed 40-50 psi at 3500 rpm.  The filter was the
ONLY thing I changed. I'll never touch another Fram.

Subject: '89 944 transaxle woes


I bought this car a year ago, when it had 28,000 miles on it. It was in 
excellent shape in general, good maintenance records, etc. The only 
problem I found after driving it for some time was a looseness in 
shifting, along with some metal-to-metal clanking noises when shifting. I 
took the car in to the local dealer, who decided that it needed to have 
all bushings, bearing,seals, etc. from the clutch back to the transaxle 
replaced, and while we were at it, replace the clutch. Two thousand + 
dollars later I had the car back in fine running shape--for about four 
days. I didn't mind the 2 grand--I expect to spend that on any used car 
to get it into top shape. I did mind having the transmission totally lock 
up on me after having paid so much to get it repaired. The dealer's 
mechanic mumbled something embarrassedly about over-torqueing a bolt that 
snapped under pressure. He took it apart and put it back together. It ran 
well for about three months, including a long shakedown to Chicago, 
Detroit and back. Day before yesterday I took it out for a short ride 
around the neighborhood just to give it some use, not having driven it 
for a week or so. Everything was fine, except the usual stiff shifting 
when cold. Put it back in the garage in apparently good shape. Later that 
day I went to move it to get at something overhead in the garage, and the 
transmission was locked up again. The shifter would move into three 
positions (same as before): fifth, neutral, and reverse. All three 
positions moved the car forward as if in fourth or fifth gear. Attempts at 
all other positions were as if meeting an unmoveable metal wall. It has 
now been towed back to the dealer, but my confidence in them is lower 
than whale poop. Either the mechanic missed a part last time, or is doing 
something else wrong in putting the thing back together. Anyone out there 
had any experience with the trasnsaxle locking up like this? Any ideas 
about what the dealer's mechanic is doing wrong to cause the problem to 
occur.
 For the record, I am not a speedster, rarely taking the car above 
5000 rpms in any gear, so I do not think I am over-torqueing the gears. 
If I had the choice, I would take the car to another repair shop here in 
Boulder that has a much better reputation, but because it is warranty 
work, I have to rely on the dealer until the problem is fixed.

NO, you have to replace all 9.  At least on mine, as I understand it,
these bolts stretch at the correct torque (designed to do that) and are
therefore weakend and should not be reused.  I got a good price on them
from AJR - course my order was $2,000 and the bolts were $10 of that.

The 86/944 is a fundamentally simple car no more difficult to maintain 
than most other single OHC's

The manuals always recommend no touch on cam belts but I suspect this 
more because of your product liability than real difficulty.

I have a UK spec Ford Granada, the Haynes manual says all the usual words 
about special belt tensioners - then says " if not available then check 
that the belt can be twisted thru 90 degrees at the mid point of the 
longest run"

I applied this tack on my belts with no problem 25k ago - I will be 
checking the belts again during the xmas break.



I guess if most 86/944 owners are like me (skint - 2 weeks before xmas) 
then they may be tempted to leave the cam belt a little longer. This is 
possibly more dangerous than the slight risk when changing the belt 
without all the tools -- you pay your money you take your choice.


FAMOUS LAST WORDS!!

Of course you must take extreme caution in making sure you do not 
rotate the engine/cam whilst the belt is off.

Total cost of my DIY 50 uk pounds for cam and balance belt.

I don't know about Mann, but Mahle is actually now a Purolator ( Purolator 
was sold, then the purchaser was bought by Mahle).  Purolator is generally

Subject: 911 Valve Adj

Hi -

Regard 911 valve adjustment interval, here's another datum point:

My '83SC has around 175k mi of which 100k are mine.  I always did the
valves every 15k or so and never found anything of interest (eg changed
clearances), and also never observed any repeatable effect on that 911
clatter noise which just kind of seems to be a fact of life.  So last
time, being a Bruce Anderson reader ("... very stable...") and lazy too,
I let them go 25k.  Verrry iiiiinterestink... several clearances 
were down (reduced) by .0005 to .001!  Yikes!  Burned-valves-ville!
I believe I'll be sticking with 15k in the future.

My interpretation is that either the valve head or the seat (or both)
*gradually* wear over life.  Result, valve sits a little deeper each
year, and clearances gradually close up.  Cam lobe or valve train wear
would tend to oppose this, but on this car at least there is *zero* sign
of valve train wear.

Subject: Blinking Light Gremlin is Dead!

Got it!  Got the 'gremlin'.  My blinking brake warning light 
no longer blinks.

It turned out to be the master cylinder warning switch after 
all, the switch that indicates whether one of the dual brake 
systems has failed.  When I rebuilt the master cylinder, I 
removed the switch and checked it.  Worked just fine.  When 
I checked and rechecked the parking brake switch which 
was all that was left in the circuit that could cause the light 
to blink (it's  in parallel with the master cylinder switch), and 
discovered that it too was OK, I removed the master cylinder 
switch  and checked it again.  And again, it worked just fine.  

That's when I posted my plea.

It turned out that the master cylinder switch worked OK out 
of the cylinder, but when screwed up tight, something 
internal shorted one of the terminals to ground,  which is the 
same as turning the switch on.  If you didn't screw it too 
tightly, it worked.  The switch consists of a  plunger that is 
"pushed" into contact if there's a brake failure.  On the theory 
that the plunger was being "pushed" when the switch was 
screwed up tight, I put a  thick aluminum washer between 
the switch and the cylinder  and by gosh everything's 
working just fine.

Long answer to a short problem  Isn't that always the way?

Many thanks to all who helped.

Subject: my first hot rod

> Maybe a few brave souls will
> explain some of their most colorful .......

Well I have been enjoying the "baring of souls" that this has brought out,
and have decided to give you all an early christmas gift of laughter.

How I loved my first hot rod.....
20 years ago,  I cut my teeth,(knuckles, etc.) on a 1966 Mustang.   

   Humbled first by the gods of the clutches the evening went like this...   
Heading home after helping a friend with a V8 Vega project lighting struck,  
the 3500lb clutch was absent and the pedal was on the floor.  
   1st sign of fortune was I was able to limp to the parking lot of work.   
Inspection showed no clutch adjusting rod to the fork... fine, machinist 
next door made me a new one, however not straight but L-stock and threaded 
rod.    
   A couple days later heading home the clutch engagement point kept 
inching toward the floor until the last several stop signs were clear but 
still embarrassing.   
   Inspection showed that the new adjusting tool had stressed the bracket 
due to the angle of force and bent it to useless.  2nd sign of fortune was 
that while removing the broken bracket I spied the original adjusting rod 
stuck in between a couple of pipes of the headers.   

   Next was the turn of the gods of valves,  journeying to the house of my 
parents, one intersection launch and shift to second allowed me the fastest 
view of a tach going from 5,000 to 0,  lightly off the clutch bought 
braking, so back in.  3rd sign of fortune (ha) was that I was close enough 
to coast into the driveway and garage where it was to rest for a while.  It 
gave me the opportunity of rebuilding my first V8.  4th sign of fortune ( I 
had to keep looking at the bright side of things..) I had purchased it with 
lots of spare parts (engine, etc.) so all was around but labor.   The 
three points of sorrow were that I, due to impending lack of high octane 
fuel, had the 11.5-1 pistons brought down to 9.5-1, could find a way to use 
the roller cam or 5.13 locker rear.

   Next was the gods of gaskets, engine done, fired up for a minute, off and 
look for leaks.  Sh*t,  oil down the back of the pan, no, no...  Hey, did 
you know that there was supposed to be a gasket at the back of the intake 
manifold..... now I do.

   Next for the gods of vehicle inspection (Texas DPS), brought it to Texas 
in the late 70's to find out you needed a lot of stuff I was unwilling to 
do.    Well between tickets, heavy clutch that the wife could not operate 
and no AC, it was gone.  

   After all these years I can with humor look back on the experiences it 
brought me.    It sure was nice to be able to sit in the engine compartment 
with the engine in it. 

Safe Holidays!

Subject: 914 Project

Friends,

I got started this weekend on my 914 project (tired '74 1.8). After removing
valances, bumpers and rockers I considered myself lucky not to find any rust
or structural damage there. The rust is confined to  1. Rear trunk floor
                  2. Front member lip between lights
                   3. Rear lip of trunk lid
                   4. Front lip of front trunk lid

I have these questions:
1. Any suggestions where I can find the front cross ? Looking in my catalogs,
only AJ racing lists it for $400. (This is the part where the lid closes on)
2. Anybody has any experience with POR-15 or similar products (Hirsch
distributes a similar product called Magic Paint or something) ? Not
necessarily as a permanent problem but as a temporary rust fix.
3. I understand that trunk lids cannot be repaired on these cars because of a
foam core construction. If the rust is minimal, has anyone ever tried
fiberglass repair ?
4. How are experiences with the fiberglas replacement lids ?

Thanks,

Subject: Lambda sensors...


I have an '89 3.2 litre engine in my '71 911, with the full factory
fuel injection and everything else on it. The only thing missing is
the lambda sensor to the fuel injection. Now I know if you put an
authority chip in they tell you to disconnect this sensor, or at least
according to my mechanic. But I keep hearing different opinions on
wether or not this has any effect with the stock chip. 

Does anyone out there have an opinion?

thanks,

Subject: Re: tires for 914

   Fellow Porschephiles, I would like to tap your collective fount of
knowledge.  Does anybody know what the aspect ratio of the original 165R15
tires for my 914 was (I no longer have them).  I would like to buy new
tires that preserve the original tire diameter, and I think that a 185R7014
will do this.  Also, would skinny original-sized tires help in snow and
rain by preventing hydro-planning?  If not, why ever did Porshe equipment
the 914 with such narrow tires. Opinions? Thanks, MIchael


   First, what *is* aspect ratio? 

   Second, I don't know about the 185R7014 tire but I replaced the Michelin
   165SR15 XZX tires with Dunlop D60 M2 205HR15 tires and enjoyed a quantum
   leap in cornering ability.  The car is also no longer a potential death
   machine in the rain.

   The guys at the place where I bought the tires initially refused to beleive
   that the Dunlops would fit on my rims (stock Fuchs) but I had recently
   attended the PA 914 reunion and had witnessed the tire on several 914's so
   the tire guys eventually acquiesed.

Your friend John DOES make a nice H.E., I have a pair on my 911.  But
could you ask him why they have to be so heavy?  I would've thought that
working in a corrosion resistant material he could've gone down a gauge
or two on the tubing and sheetmetal, saving some pounds back behind the
rear axle where it counts.  Building a 50 year heat exchanger is a nice
excercise in compulsion, but I would've been happy with 20 years and 10
pounds lighter...  maybe he could offer a "race/sunbelt" version...

Subject: tires for 914

Porschephiles, What Bill Kennedy says, that an aspect ratio of .8 is
understood if it is not specified, agrees with a dim memory of mine, so I
take that as gospel. Thus, the original sidewall of the 914 2.O was
(.8)(165) = 132 mm. A 185R7015 (not 185R7014 as I mistyped before) has a
130 mm sidewall, depending on the rim width, which is close enough to
preserve speedometer accuracy. Still no idea why Porsche tires are so
narrow. Michael

Dear Mike,

I don't know the year or engine size of your 914, but fuel injectors are not
your problem. A pinched fuel line or debris in the tank could cause the
bubbling, although we have seen fuel line bubbles in perfectly well running
914s until they ran out of gas!

Hesitation is caused by one of the following:
     1. Dwell/timing misset
     2. Leanness (Vacuum leak, low fuel pressure mixture misset)
     3. 1.7, 2.0 throttle switch disconnected or misset
     4. Missing on one cylinder (low compression tight or burned) valve, bad
plug wire, plug, etc.

If your car is missing, free the wires from the distributor cap and then
replug loosely. Next, pull one wire at a time and see which one does not
affect idle (but insulate yourself from the car and the ground!) The wire
that does not make a difference is the suspect cylinder!

Subject: Re: 914; Kyle needs a pressure sensor.


Dear Kyle,

The 037 pressure is commonly available new for about $195.00. It is the best
to use on all 2.0 litre 914 for optimum upper end torque. It is not worth
these days even shopping for a used 037 sensor as most have leaking or broken
diaphrams.

For general running, the 1.7 pressure sensor will suffice. The only relation
between it and sticking throtttle is high idle due to leaner running.
However, sticking throttle is usually caused by one of the following you
mentioned:
     1. Sticking acc cable or throttle body butterfly
     2. Leaking decel valve or a misrouted vacuum line.
     3. Vacuum leak (vacuum retard)
     4. Leaking or dist plate sticking, vacuum line split or loose)

914 fuel injection parts are unfortunately expensive. However, most last for
quite a long time and rebuilds are offered for others (most 1.7, 2.0
no-longer-available auxillary air valves can be repaired). I suggest you
check with a supplier who purchases 914-only fuel injection parts in
quantity. That is where you will get the greatest discount.

That indicates a bad wiper switch.  I had the same problem in my 79 SC and
I was able to repair the switch.  I think some contacts were just dirty or
had bent out of position.

I have had the same problem with my '78 911 SC since I got the car.  
The intermittent wipers don't work, and the wipers don't park when I 
turn off the switch on the column.  My mechanic looked at it and 
diagnosed a bad wiper motor.  After several misadventures, I managed to 
replace the motor myself, but much to my dismay, the problem remains.

Anyone else solve this problem?  Seems strange that the column switch 
would control the intermittent wiper circuit, since the switch for that 
is located on the dash, you'd think the two would be isolated.  I could 
see the main wipers going funky due to a bad column switch, but the 
intermittent circuit as well?

For most tires, the "default" was .78, which is close enough to .80 for
most purposes... If you  look real hard, you'll still see some old "wide track"
literature touting the vastly improved 70 series tires from back in about 
1972 or so... look at tire ads in very old Playboy and Road and Trck for
grins sometimes...

165 is a fairly respectable width, for a car of that vintage. You must
hold the car in its original time, or you just can't reason about it well.
That was *SIGNIFICANTLY* wider than the tires on most other European
sports cars (the real deal here -- two seat open cars *ONLY*, not 
GT coupes posing as sports cars!). The car was designed in the late '60s
and was produced with essentially no suspension, tire, or body changes
for six years. In that time, and certainly since then, things have changed
a lot. But there's no way you could have purchased 205/50x15s in 1970, so
why burn calories wondering why they weren't the default?

Subject: Blinking Light Gremlin is Dead!


Got it!  Got the 'gremlin'.  My blinking brake warning light 
no longer blinks.

It turned out to be the master cylinder warning switch after 
all, the switch that indicates whether one of the dual brake 
systems has failed.  When I rebuilt the master cylinder, I 
removed the switch and checked it.  Worked just fine.  When 
I checked and rechecked the parking brake switch which 
was all that was left in the circuit that could cause the light 
to blink (it's  in parallel with the master cylinder switch), and 
discovered that it too was OK, I removed the master cylinder 
switch  and checked it again.  And again, it worked just fine.  

That's when I posted my plea.

It turned out that the master cylinder switch worked OK out 
of the cylinder, but when screwed up tight, something 
internal shorted one of the terminals to ground,  which is the 
same as turning the switch on.  If you didn't screw it too 
tightly, it worked.  The switch consists of a  plunger that is 
"pushed" into contact if there's a brake failure.  On the theory 
that the plunger was being "pushed" when the switch was 
screwed up tight, I put a  thick aluminum washer between 
the switch and the cylinder  and by gosh everything's 
working just fine.

Long answer to a short problem  Isn't that always the way?

Many thanks to all who helped.

Well, I'm 99% sure it's the column switch.  Maybe I can try to explain why 
I think this is true.  Also maybe someone can confirm this by going throught
the wiring diagram.

I think the power to the park mechanism in the motor is supplied through the 
column switch.  Why?  Because when you turn the column switch off, the wipers 
don't park.  That could also mean the park mechanism in the motor, but you 
already tried that and it didn't solve the problem.  When the column switch is
on, you are bypassing the park mechanism in the motor.  But, when the column
switch is turned to "off", the park mechanism kicks in, and if no power is
supplied to the park mechanism, the motor stops without finishing the cycle.
That is why when you jiggle the column switch, you supply power to the park
mechanism and the motor starts turning.  The Intermitent relay produces a 
pulse that turns the motor just enuff to kick in the park mechanism and that
is all the intermitent does.  The pulse frequency is determined by the knob
on the your dash.  Sometimes grease or junk can get in the way the contacts
in the park mechanism in the motor wich will produce the same results, but
again, you have already changed the motor with no results.  Take the steering
wheel off and get to the column switch.  Put the wipers in an unparked 
position and play with the contacts in the switch.  That should tell you
where the problem lies.

Hope that helps.

Among the places where I know enough to realize I need extra help:

	- When (and on what models) was the tea-tray rear wing (and,
	  for that matter, the other rear wings) used?

	- I need all the information on the more recent models.

	- What are the options I didn't mention?

Well, at any rate, here's what I have so far.

Q. What's a 911?
A. Yikes.  Okay, in 1964 Porsche announced the 901, a model based on 
the venerable 356 model.  The car, which was renamed 911 because Peugeot
had a copyright on all 3-digit car model numbers with a zero in the 
middle, has continued to become, arguably, the most popular car ever 
produced by Porsche.  The car had (and continues to have) a six cylendar 
opposed engine.  The body of the car was designed by Ferdinand "Butzi" 
Porsche (Ferry's son) while the engine was designed by Ferdinand Piech 
(Dr. Porsche's nephew).

- --
Q. Which 911 Should I Get?
A. The standard answer is "get the newest 911 you can afford".
Unfortunately, it's more complicated than that.  I had occasion to meet 
Joe Rusz (sp?) once; his answer to this question was simply "if you can 
afford it, get one with Motronic Fuel Injection" (those'd be the ones 
built in 84 and after).

You really have to decide for yourself what you want.  Many feel that 
one exception to the 'newest you can afford' rule is the middle year 
cars (1973 through 1977) due to their short engine life span (circa 50K 
miles).  Others (like myself) prefer the early mechanically injected 
cars (light and sparcely appointed with quick, torquey engines) over 
the newer 911SC (with their air conditioning, electric windows, and
bullet-proof engine).

Hopefully, the information in this document will help you decide.

- --
Q. What are the differences between the various 911s?
A. There's *lots* of differences:

First, there are numerous of body styles:

	Coupe		4 seats (well, 2 and a couple postage 
			stamps) and a hard roof.  You know. . .
			a COUPE

	Targa		Like a coupe, but with a roll bar and a 
			removable top.  The earlier targas had 
			soft rear windows, but the later ones 
			had glass.

	Cabriolet	A full-on convertable.

	Speedster	A version of convertable, but with a
			short windshield and a fiberglass tonneau
			(the 356 speedster was different, but we're
			talking about 911s here).


There are several trim and tune options:

	T, E, S		The early years (the latest any of these
			were produced was 1977) cars in touring, 
			injected and super (also fuel injected)
			states of tune.
			
	Carrera		For the earlier cars, this was the quickest
			standard customer car.  After 1983, the Carrera
			was the standard customer car.
			
	SC		This was the standard car (there was also the
			turbo for some of theses years) between 1978 
			and 1983.

	H, N		Rare models: Homologation (20 made in 1973) and 
			a Euro model in 1976.

	L		The one-year replacement for the 911S in the US.

	R, RS, RSR	911 in race trim.  These cars are always rare
			and expensive.

	Turbo		This one is, well, turbo charged.


And, finally, there are the various changes over the different model
years.  Major Eras Include (the names are, partly, my own):

    - 1964-1968 short wheel base (SWB, 2211 mm to be exact).  In 
      contrast, the long wheel base (LWB) is 2268 mm long.

    - 1968-1973 early power.  These 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 liter 911s
      (my personal favorite) saw either mechanical fuel injection 
      or carburators.

    - 1974-1977 middle-year 911s.  These cars had the 2.7 liter 
      engines that had a notoriously short life span.  This is
      the beginning of the crash bumpers (with the accordian
      sections at the edges) and K-Jetronic fuel injection.

    - 1978-1983 911SC.  These 3.0 liter SCs are powerful, 
      luxurious, and nearly bullet-proof.

    - 1984-1989 Motronic Carreras.  Like the 911SC, but with a
      3.2 liter engine and Motronic fuel injection.

    - 1989-1993 964 (original 911 Carrera 2/4).  These cars have
      the one-piece, all body color bumpers and the engine cover
      that raises at 50 MPH to form a wing.

    - 1993-today 993 (today's 911)

Note: Years given are model year.  The model years start in August
or September of the previous year (example 1972 model year starts
in September of 1971).  Much of the research for this document has
been clouded by research materials not specifying whether they
discussed calendar year or model year.

More specific differences are given in the following (big) table.
This table contains the following headings:

    -Model / disp	Model / Displacement (in Liters)
    -ind'n		Induction
    -0-60		0-60 MPH in Seconds
    -HP			Horsepower (DIN)
    -top spd		Top speed in miles per hour
    -weight		Weight in pounds

== General Recognition 1964-1968 =============================================

    1968 and earlier cars have a shorter wheelbase than the 911s built in 1969
    and after (recognition hint: the tortion bar tubes are right next
    to the SWB cars' rear wheel well -- there's a gap in the LWB cars).
    Other accoutrements of the SWB cars are:

  	- glass lens covered headlights,
    	- exterior door handles that opened via an exposed push-button 
	  (rather than the flying-buttress protection or trigger of 
	  later years), 
  	- no side marker reflectors, 
    	- Hella 128 fog lights mounted through the bottom half of the 
	  front bumper, 
	- a vertical structural strip running under the rear engine 
	  grille,  
    	- sunroof models during these years had a drain slot above the 
	  rain gutter above the back side windows,

    And, in the interior:
	- chrome instrument bezels with green lettering, 
	- ceiling-mounted rear-view mirror (1968 was as well, but
	  it was break-away type)
	- a one piece under-dash knee guard,
    	- pleated door pockets, and
    	- push-buttons to open the doors from the inside.

    Until 1971, non-S models had silver painted slotted steel wheels; 
    S models had Fuchs alloy wheels.

    911s before the 1967 model year had the '911' designation 
    diagonally across the lower right corner of the engine cover and 
    the PORSCHE script in one piece (well, actually it was two pieces, 
    but it looked like one) on the bottom.  


== 1964 2.0 liter=============================================================

 -Model / disp---ind'n---0-60----HP------top spd-weight---------------------
 911 2.0	Solexes	8.8	130	.	2380	

- -- Recognition Tips -------------------------------------------------------
The 1964 cars have no rocker-panel trim and and no model designation on 
the engine lid or on the dash.  Supporting clues are that 1966 and earlier 
911s have wooden dash trim and open A-frame window cranks.

- -- Notes/Options ----------------------------------------------------------
There were four 901 prototypes produced (serial numbers 13326, 13327,
13328, and 13330).  Porsche went on to build 125 first year (1964) 901 
cars.


== 1965 2.0 liter=============================================================

 -Model / disp---ind'n---0-60----HP------top spd-weight---------------------
 911 2.0	Solexes	8.8	130	.	2380

- -- Recognition Tips -------------------------------------------------------
These cars look nearly identical to the 1966 cars.  The things that 
separate these cars from the 1966s is in the interior.  The 1965 cars have 
no wrap-around knee guard, aluminum backing on the wood dash trim, or 
rubber shift boot (I think they were leather).

Both years are similar in that they have the rocker panel trim (this is
not found on the 1964 cars), wooden dash trim, and open A-frame window 
cranks.

- -- Notes/Options ----------------------------------------------------------
A four speed transmission became standard mid-model year.  Options:

These cars look nearly identical to the 1965 cars.  The things that 
separate these cars from the 1966s is in the interior (see the 1965
description).  Of course, if the car is an 'S' model, it has to be
a 1966 or later.

US models have all chrome vertical bumper guards (standard equipment) -- 
911S bumper guards are all rubber.  

- -- Notes/Options ----------------------------------------------------------

The window cranks on 1967 cars are of the covered A-frame type but had 
a hard plastic knob.

US Models have chrome vertical bumper guards with a rubber strip 
(standard) -- 911S bumper guards are all rubber.  The bases for the 
switches on the dash go from black to chrome and the dash is matte black 
(S model had basket weave vinyl).

== General Recognition 1968-1973 =============================================

    Side marker reflectors appear in 1968 (tacked-on side reflector) -- 
    in 1969 and later, the reflectors are incorporated into the turn 
    indicators.  1968 and later 911s have the model designation mounted 
    horisontally centered on the engine cover (the hood?).  The covered 
    headlight is replaced with a rim bezel over a sealed beam headlight 
    (US) or a lens covering bulbs (non-US).  Inside, the window cranks 
    are one-piece with a soft vinyl knob.  The door pockets under the
    arm rests are vinyl-covered hard cardboard.

    1969 is the first year of long wheelbase 911s; these came with 
    flared fender arches; also, the targas come with glass rear windows.

    The 911s between 1969 and 1973 used a 2 battery system.  

    From 1970 on, the doors opened via trigger-type door handles.  The 
    under-dash knee guard is a two-piece (with room for the ash tray in
    between) unit during this time period.

    1969 and later, the rear-view mirror is mounted to the windshield.

== General Recognition 1978 on ===============================================

    The fenders were flaired more dramatically from 1978-on.  The rear 
    badge of the 1978-1983 cars had, of course, the '911SC' designation.  
    Between 1984 and 1988, the badge on the engine lid indicated the
    then-current model name, "Carrera".  From 1980-on, the headlight
    washers were mounted flush with the front bumper.  The cabriolet 
    body type was offered for the first time in 1983.

Subject: Re: Windows

	On the same subject, my new(?!?!?) 914 has a problem with the passenger
side window.  When I bought the car, the windows were stuck down, so I
did not notice this problem initially.  Upon lubricating the window
mechanism, I found to my dismay that the window was crooked, i.e. when I
rolled it all the way up the front of the window was about 1/2" below
the windshield header and the back of it was about the same above the
top of the roll bar.  What to do?  Just get a whole new mess o'stuff? 
Or is this a common problem with an easy fix?

TIA,

Nate

PS - Oh, I forgot, it's a '71.  Forgot that made a difference (and yes,
both regulators work fine.  For now.)

Since I bought my 84 930 the wipers always acted strange. The main problem
was that they would come on by themselves with no warning, work for a 
while and then stop. The dash switch would always activate the wipers and 
they always parked O.K.

Since this happened only occasionally I decided I would live with it for 
a while. Then a couple of days before a driver's ed. event they started going
crazy. Any time I revved the car past 3000 R.P.M the wipers would come on.
I decided I had to do Something!

I traced the problem to the intermittent relay. This relay DOES control 
the wiper park in my car. If you disconnect it the wipers will not park.
The relay is in the front of the car behind the blower motor and the ducts
for the heat/ac. Takes about an hour to get to it and 1.5 Hrs. to reassemble.
Parts Heaven had a relay (used) for $15 but it didn't get here in time to 
install before the weekend so I installed a toggle switch inline with the 
12v. supply to the relay (temporary). I haven't had any problems since
then. Of course the intermittent won't work until I have time to install 
the new relay.

Hope this helps,

George--

I saw that red 959 when it was in Ohio!!  Across from my school is an exotic
car dealer called Jeff's Auto Sales.  One day on the way into school I saw it
and went wild, so after school my dad and I went over and took a look at it. 
The owner who brought it into the U.S. drove it 2 times around the track and
then stored it for a couple of years.  Jeff's was acting as a broker for the
owner who wanted to remain anonoumous.  The 959 was a full race spec car
straight from the factory with built in roll cage.  The car made the front page
of the local paper with the picture taken in front of my school.  Asking
price-- cool million 8^).  What an awesome car.  Told the sales guy at Jeff's
if he was pressed for space, there was plenty of room in my garage!!!

Entries will be opened based on postmark date. If the parade is 
oversubscribed then a region by region formula will be used.
If you want to go send in your reg. If you are not accepted you are put

Being from canada should give you an advanage unless eveyone from your

Subject: Fram oil filters - 914


    Fellow p-philes,
    
    FWIW,  I used Fram oil filter on my 914 2.0 club racer as recently as 
    May/June of last year and blew them all up.  I figured it was because I 
    ran the crankcase 1/2 quart over full (a common practice for track 
    driven 914's).  However, I went back to the Mahle's and have not had a 
    problem since.  I would say that Fram may have improved filtration, but 
    their mechanical design doesn't suit Porsches.
    
    However, I do need a new engine and if Chris could kindly forward the 
    name of his contact at Fram and any other pertinant info, I am sure I 
    will be using Fram in the future.  ;^)
    
    Hope to *VROOM* soon,
    Jon

Subject: embarrassing moments

Well, I can't believe I did that!  I've been doing woodworking for home
repairs in the garage my 356 is in.  That had involved several rounds
of starting it up only to get backed out onto the drive which gave me
a guilty feeling even though I could push it back in.  On Thanksgiving
day, my son asked to be allowed to put his old Accord into the garage
for brake work.  This time I decided to at least take a spin around
the block (five miles).  The car was balky and stopped halfway round.

After a two mile walk home, I towed it back with a simple loop of
webbing around the bumper to pull it by.  The loop squeezed the bumper
and gave me an excuse to try bodywork.  Yesterday I looked at the car
and couldn't find anything wrong except dirty plugs (no surprise) and
apparently no fuel flow.  Yes, it was only out of gas.  No the fuel
gauge doesn't work, but I should do better than that.

For race cars, I take a different approach: the Canton/Meca canister filter.
It's made of CNC machined T6 aluminium, 1/4" thick, with four bolts and an
O-ring between the oil on the inside and you on the outside. 1/2"NTP fittings
for inlet and outliet, filters to 6 microns at 110 gallons per hour.
Optional plate for direct attachment of an Accusump, something no racing
Porsche flat four should be without.

Can't blow it up. Can't clog it up unless you're stupid and don't change
filter elements, or your engine grenades. Sure, it's $90 plus plumbing,
and cartridges are $7 each, but isn't your $10k engine *WORTH IT*?

    I've heard this several places... are there really no ill effects
(cavitation, leaking cylinders where they attach to crankcase, etc.)? 
If not, why didn't Porsche recommend putting in that extra quart?

I can't decide between the 993 (two) or the 993 (four). If I purchase the
(two) what options do you recommend.
                    17" wheels?
                     ABD (automatic brake differential)?
                     Electric seats?
Please advise me, I'm new to the porsche world.

For street 914 it is strongly recomended to add oil to a quarter of inch 
above the full mark on the dip stick. In fact my has another cut in for 
this. The 914 eng will let all the oil move to the side of the case on 
hard cornering and you will run the bearings dry. This is only nec if 
you do not have oil traps etc on the crankcase.

Nate, re your message


    Do most Porsche dealers carry these on fiche?  Is there anywhere I
can get these read and printed out (instead of buying a reader and
leaving it in my garage?)

thanks,

Nate

I think some of the Porsche microfiches come in two different sizes. There is
an american 4x6 and an european 6x9 (or whatever the conversion is...)

Your local library might have a microfiche reader/printer. Give them a call.

I think the later 944 manuals are in the 4x6 format. 911 fiches are in 6x9.

I'm sure that they could be carefully cut and mounted on a 4x6 transparent
sheet (like that used in viewgraphs:) and thus allow you to see it in an 
american size viewer.

YMMV :)

Hey, wait a minute !!! Everyone tells me "Don't even look at the timing
belt without the gauge, it's bad luck". I have had my car's belts done by a
p mechanic, and since I left the cover off when I took the car to him (so
he charges me less ...  ;-)    ), I got a good feel for what the belts are
supposed to be like when they are properly tensioned, and how much
"sloppiness" there should be in the belts when the car is running. Now, I
wasn't intending to do my belts without the gauge, but is the gauge really
needed if one is armed with the experience of how tight the belts should
be?

I have asked my local p mechanic about this, and he does suggest using the
gauge. He did go on to say though, that if I was careful and made sure that
a) tension everything as accurately as possible, and if in doubt, tension
the belts a little on the tight side, since a loose belt can do more damage
than a tight belt, b) the belts did not exhibit too much slop while the
engine was running, and definitely did not slap against anything !!!, and
c) that the belts did not whine when the engine was hot (and the belts at
their "maximum" tightness). He then restated how super careful I should be
about doing this without the gauge. He also suggested that I check the
belts every 10k, and replace every 20k since the belts might exhibit a
shorter life when slightly overtightened. He also noted however, that most
of the p-car mechanics he knew (all working in auth. dealers) tended to
slightly overtighten the belts when replacing to account for belt stretch
and the fact that an over tight belt will do far less damage than a too
loose belt, which runs the risk of the cam or counter shafts skipping time.

Does anyone have any comments about this ? Is is nuts to not use the
tension meter, or can a person do this without it if he is **super**
carefull ???

Last time I checked, PartWerks of Chicago (800-366-9147 / 312-472-1096)
made fender liners for about $100 a set.

They also made "sealed" rocker covers that were supposed to stop dirt
from sneaking in.

And I put a pair of their Resupport/Stiffening panels on my car.  They
took a lot longer to install than they said that they would, but the
car is much stiffer that it used to be.

Subject: 944 timing belts and tension guages


In my Autodata timing belts book, special tension guages are
listed for many cars. They all operate in roughly the same way
by measuring the deflection of the belt.

What is useful, however, is that the book lists a guage
comparison table, so that one 'standard' guage can be used
for a multitute of cars.

It lists the following guages

Borroughs BT33-73F
SEEM C.Tronic 87
Lowener (Ford 21-113 Vauxhall 510-2)
Peiseler (VW 210 Volvo 5197 SEAT U.10.028)
BMW 11.2.080 (Volvo 9988500)
Borroughs/Rover (KM 4088AR)

Of course, it doesn't even cover P-cars , so no useful comparison there.

However .... Someone who has the correct guage, and access to a more
'generic' tension guage, could easily take some cross reference readings
and post them here.

The Borroughs guage mentioned above is calibrated in Newtons, so it
would seem that a reading from a similarily calibrated guage could be
quite handy.

Lets face it, it's hardly rocket science, it just load for a known deflection,
or deflection for a known load.

Subject: Re" timing belts

Well, I guess that if you can afford a new engine, you don't need to spend 
the money on the proper tools to do the job.

The timing belt gauge is specified by the factory because there is little 
room for error in setting the tension and also because, when you do make that
error, the results are usually catastrophic.

My recommendation is just that, I recommend that you use the proper tools to 
do the job, and one of those tools is the proper gauge.

I'm posting this for a friend...

She bought a 968 last year at a local dealer (the one that never has any 
parts when I go there...) She was only given one key to unlock the wheel
locks. You guessed it. She has misplaced the key.

Do you know if she should have been given 2 keys? I have 2 of them for the 911.
She need to have the wheels rotated and was wandering what to do?

Can they make new keys based on the key ID tag that you get from the factory?
Should she get in touch with PCNA and explain her situation?
It looks like she is going to have them drilled out...

On a related matter, my 300d has developed what sounds like a deep growling
from the FE starting at about 35MPH. It is speed dependent, increasing as speedsgo up. Checked the wheel bearing play and seems ok. I think I had them on
too tight before. Could they have been ruined (scored/overheated) by that?

Yep, should have received 2 keys. I don't think PCNA replaces keys for wheel
locks, just ignition and door/hatch...

Drilling is the cheapest way.  Having the locks picked by a locksmith a bit
more expensive, but esthetically more desireable.

Growling sounds like wheel bearings to me...Jack up the front end and listen
for any roughness as you rotate the wheel slowly (in a quiet garage)...

A 185/70R15 tire has a 70 aspect ratio. This means that the tire section is
70% as high as it is wide. I emphasize section because most tires are wider
than their tread. Aspect ratio is also a measure of the load carrying
capacity of the tire. A P215/75R15 tire will have a higher load carrying
capacity than a P215/70R15. They are not interchangable.

Have intermittent problem with cabin fan speed switch.  Sometimes speeds 1,

pressing the defroster switch fixes the fan switch - i.e. if fan switch at 2 
 - but fan not working - pressing def switch kicks in the fan.  Anyone have 
an idea where I could start looking here - or if there's a known 944

Subject: re; Stupid Home Mechanic Olympics


        While replacing the timing belt on my wifes Escort last night
    (the shop that did it put the -wrong- side of the belt on the 
    tensioner !!) I thought of a few things I'd done way-bad before; this is 
    my most embarassing one, made worse since it wasn't all -that- long ago.
  
      A brother's Ford pickup came home with -zero- oil pressure, so I spent
   a Memorial Day tilting the engine up off its mounts, pulled the oil pan
   and replaced the oil pump, pickup, etc. Hard, nasty work. By evening of the
   3rd day, it was done---and I was very anxious to start it up.

     Got in, turned the key--nothing at all, no juice to the solenoid.
   Rechecked the tranny linkage/interlock, all appeared fine, still the 
   starter wouldn't kick. Intent on getting past that danged electrical 
   bug and starting the motor, I put the tranny in Park, left the key on,
   and walked to the passenger-side fender-mounted solenoid.
   GrrrGrrrGrrrVRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOMMMMM----The motor ran immediately up 
   to 3000 RPM, way too high for a startup. But as I started to make for
   the open drivers door to shut it off, the truck started inching backward,
   picking up speed as the tranny picked up fluid. I was too late to catch
   it, it sped up to 10mph, autodrove 30 feet backwards and crashed into a 
   wooden fence. 
      Luckily the only damage truck was the drivers door mirror, where it, uh,
   hit the right front fender...(as the open door folded 180' on its
   hinges...).
     The ignition interlock had worked fine, the throttle linkage had been
   jammed when I tilted the engine up (causing it to rev so high) and the
   shifter linkage really pointing to reverse, not park. Living in flat
   country, I didn't even think to put on the parking brake. 

     My dad (as a pilot) used to tell me that accidents rarely occur because
   of a single mistake, but are usually a succession of ignored warning
   signs. Case in point.

              -Lee A (Glad I'm no Doctor ??)

    ps. Of course there was the time I took a derelict 924 to a reputable
     Porsche Garage in Houston to get it running, which they finally did,
     drove it around in circles in the parking lot before they crashed it
     into a fence (they forgot it had not brakes either...)

Subject: Re: 911 flaky wipers


I'm finally pleased that I can offer some advise.

I've had this exact problem.  After ordering a replacement wiper motor and
other trouble shooting...turned out to be the wiper relay.  The relay was not
really broken, its just that the contacts were corroded.  The relay is located
near the wiper motor in the "behind the ducting, infront of the firewall,
under the windshield, abyss" accessible by removing the speedometer and
reaching through.  I removed the relay, pryed it open, and filed the contacts.
Works like new now.  If you simply want to replace the relay, I think they're
only $20.

BTW. I have an absolutely-like-new wiper motor for sale ($85) if anyone is
interested.  Intended application was an '87 911, but no longer needed (see
above).

    Sounds like the story my dad tells to this day if you ask him...
apparently he lost the brakes on his '55 Chevy (back when this car was
merely old, not classic) and took it to a garage to have it checked out.
 He told the pump jockey, "can you have the mechanic check out my car,
I'm losing my brakes."  So the pump jockey says "sure, let me run it
into the garage for you," takes the keys, fires 'er up, revs up to about
3000, and dumps the clutch...
    And I really wanted to inherit that car, too.  Guess it wasn't meant to be.

Subject: Choice of MIG welders

A few questions for those of you who do there own bodywork.

I'm considering buying a MIG welder. I'm not sure whether to buy a
normal MIG or one of the new "no gas" MIG welders. I understand that
buying the gas in home restoration type volumes is expensive, but I'm
not sure whether the "no gas" MIGs are as good. 

I notice that the "no gas" welders are available only in the lower
power ranges. I imagine this is OK. I want to run the welder off the
household electricity circuits so I'm restricted anyway. 

So, for any of you who have used both:

How do they compare?

I imagine that the wire for the "no gas" is significantly more
expensive than the normal stuff. Is this true?

Does the "no gas" welder leave slag behind like arc welding does? 

Can you weld panels as thin as with a standard MIG? 

How does the weld compare as far as malleability is concerned when
panel beating?

Is there anything else I should consider before I buy?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Willis (ye79@gec-mrc.co.uk)

Subject: RE: timing belt advice. (was: technical manuals for 86 - 944)


Trevor,
I have a 16 valve 928 and replaced my own belt, tensioning it so that I 
could just give a 90 degree turn on it's longest run.  Found this tip in a 
Chilton book.  I put about 50,000 miles on that belt before having it 
replaced (no time this year to do it myself again).

It worked for me, but then my valves will not meet the pistons when the belt 
breaks (US model 16 valve 928), unlike your 944.  If you want to do the job 
yourself, I would suggest replacing the belt (two on a 944?) and adjusting 
it close as you can.  Then without stressing the engine, take a mild trip to 
the dealer and have them check/adjust the tension with their tool.  I bet 
you can get pretty close.

Cheaper than having them replace the belt, but not as much as buying the 
tool, which I believe goes about $375-400.

this could also be an adjustment problem, as was the case for both rollup

the adjustment is not visible unless you remove the window mechanism, but
you can find it by feeling on the back of the mechanism pivots - one of them

Subject: Re: 944 cabin fan speed switch malfunction


Agree with George's diagnosis.  You sometimes fix what you have by
cleaning the contacts on the resistor block's internal circuit breakers.
They open when the unit gets too hot, which happens when the resistors
start to fall apart and lose thermal contact with their cores.

To clean the contacts, remove the resistor block and shoot the breakers
with a cleaner such as Wurth Contact OL.

If you need a new one, get it from George.  List on the part from Porsche
is obscene, like $180.  It's almost as expensive even to shops through the
wholesale aftermarket.  And, no, it's not repairable.

I have a '72 911 T (not Targa) and was wondering if anyone knows where I might
find the "metal rear window shelf" for my car.  Before I purchased the car
someone had broken into the car through the rear window, while it was waiting
for repairs at a garage.  The perpetrator was kind enough to set the window back
in place after exiting but the car sat at the garage for several months over a
harsh winter.  Needless to say, rain and melting snow entered the car around the
window seal and built up inside the car.  But the only place that was really
affected was the rear window shelf.  Water must have penetrated the sound
proofing rubber material on the shelf and rusted it out.  I've looked in Tweeds
but they don't seem to have that body part.  If anyone has any leads on where I
can find this part, I'd be most appreciative.  Thanks in advance!

1971 Porsche 914 parts:
    -Hood (good except slightly bent around driver's side headlight
area) - easily made perfect
    -Front suspension parts - a-arms, struts, steering rack.  Can't
guarantee condition of struts, but the boots on the rack look like new.
    -Rear suspension parts - arms, driveshafts, CV joints.  Again, no
guarantees, but the boots on the CV joints look like new.
 
    I can't sell any of this stuff (except the hood) until after I drive

Subject:      Annoying ABS light

On an '89 944 I have a recurrent problem that the ! warning light on the dash
stays on along with the antilock brake warning light.  I've taken it to a
dealer twice and he resets the controller, clearing the warning.  Each time
this worked for about one month and the light stayed off.  My question is
whether anyone knows if there is a permanent solution to this short of
replacing the ABS controller ($$$).  Alternatively, does anyone know how to
clear the fault code as the dealer is doing (sort of like a monthly maintenance
chore).

I've heard mixed things about "gasless" MIG - but most
sources say that isn't as good as using a proper shielding
gas.

MIG welders are very versatile devices and can do wonders,
and I have two pieces of advice:

1)  Buy a GMAW (MIG) welding book.  I have one by Miller and
it has 142 pages of VALUABLE info on the topic.  Get a similar
book before you buy a machine.  I got mine at a local welding
shop.

2)  Buy a welder that has as many variable adjustments as
possible.  Ideally, you'd like variable wire feed speed, voltage,
slope, inductance, and being able to change the polarity.
You probably won't find all these on a small 110V unit, but
look for them.  Oh yeah, if you don't know what those adjustments
do, buy the book!!!

One last thing....try to support your local welding shop and buy
a machine from them instead of "sell-everything" stores like
Home Depot.  They are a valuable source of info - and you
should probably get a "proper" MIG which will have shielding
gas so you'll be there every so often to get your tanks filled.
These guys have done all sorts of welding and can assist
you in this new area (tricks of the trade, etc).

Martin,
  I have the info folder from the people that make the supercharger
kit.  From what I can tell it seems like an idea worth pursuing.
I think the name of the place is German Precision and they
have ads in Excellence.  I called them a year or so ago and
they sent me lots of info answering most questions you would
have.  
  Right of the top of my head, the supercharger's (claimed) advantages
include less heat than a turbocharger, smoother onset of power
and less "plumbing" to interfere with maintenance. Interestingly, they 
also claimed it will _increase_ engine longevity because the engine
doesn't need to be revved as much to produce the same power.
  To me the power to cost ratio seems a lot better than other approaches
such as "Cash Flow", chips, pistons or exhaust.  I read in 911 and Porsche 
magazine where someone in England is racing  a C2 with a supercharger 
system developed by these same guys.

 vrooom,

Subject: RWR AutoX (last waltz)

        The last event of the season in the Bay Area was the autocross run
by Redwood Region last Saturday.  It was also the last event we'll be able
to hold at that site, because it's being torn down any day now.  'Course,
we've been hearing that story since May sometime, and it's still there.
        It was a fun course.  One big Figure Eight, except that the
cross-over on one side was toward the end, while the one on the other side
was in the middle.  One chicane right in front of the start/finish turn to
slow us down.  That was it.  No tricks, not even a ride through the go-kart
section.  (Aaawww.)
It was a fun, fast course!  Everyone but the 930s were in third gear for
much of it.
        I didn't actually catch who got TToD, but it was almost certainly
Hank Watts, in the Elf, once again.  The Elf is a green 911, which started
life as a 69 911 E.  I think it's got a 2.4 S engine in there now, but I'm
not certain.  All I know for sure is that it's fast.
        We were treated to two spectacular exhibitions of Agricultural
driving.  Victor George figured that, since his 930 has a whale tail, it
would be more comfortable swimming.  He ran off the pavement, and ran his
right-side wheels through a very LARGE mud puddle.  He said that he would
be washing the car Sunday, "as penance."
        Our own Soren LaForce had the throttle stuck open on one of the
cross-overs.  At least, that's what he *says* happened.  >;-)  He was
evidently trying to turn when he discovered this fact, as he locked up his
brakes and skidded straight off the pavement into the weeds.  We both
wished we'd brought our cameras to take photos of the skid marks.  They
were LOOOOONG!  I guess he was carrying a lot of speed through there.  No
obviously bent metal or extra wind noise, as of the last report from him.
        Tom Provasi didn't go off-course, but he did show us that a 914
will indeed travel sideways.  And I do mean sideways--almost 90 degrees!
And the most amazing part is that he got it back under control, and he
didn't even hit a single cone!  Wow.
        I am personally rather happy with how I did.  I recieved several
compliments on my driving, some of which came from people who actually know
what they're talking about!  But the best part was that I finally beat Ber
Del Villano.  You may remember me talking about Bert in the past--he used
to beat me pretty thoroughly in Stock class, then he upgraded to sticky
tires and moved to Improved.  The past several months, I've been creeping
up on him.  Well, I finally got him!  The margin of victory was only 0.08
seconds, but it's as good as a minute to me!  [gloat, gloat, sounds of
chest-pounding in the background]
        So Dave had a good weekend.

I have a gassless-mig (lincoln 100)

I paid $9 for a 1lb spool of wire a few weeks ago.  I would have bought
a 10lb spool, but neither I nor the store had the required adapter.
a 10lb spool is like $25 or so.  Big enconomy factor.  A 1lb spool of
wire takes me quite a way, though.

>Does the "no gas" welder leave slag behind like arc welding does? 

No

How thin?  I'm welding VW sheet metal with mine from 18-20 guage or
so,

>How does the weld compare as far as malleability is concerned when
>panel beating?

From what I've seen and done, the metal is going to be stiffer after
welding.  Thats why i try to get everything lined up perfect 
first, so I don't have to "adjust" it with hammer and dolly.

>Is there anything else I should consider before I buy?

I paid $300 for my welder, and I love it to death.  Other on the list
have bashed me in the oast for this, but for my budget, my skill level
and the type of projects I'm doing, it fits the bill perfectly.

Also, for about $80, plus the price of the gas, you can upgrade these
to gas MIG.

I know a guy who does a lot of VW off road racing and has the exact same
welder I do.  He is an accomplished, trained, welder, and uses his
for all of his frame stuff.  Not only that, but he takes the welder
and a generator with him to races, and makes extra cash welding stuff
for people on the spot!  He's way more than paid for the welder and the
generator from that alone!

Subject: Re: Supercharger on 82 911 ?

Re Supercharging:

I recently had a chat with Steve Dinan about what sort of upgrades he would
be offering for the new BMW M3.  Our discussion, which included "drawing"
curves on a dirty windshield, was quite enlightening in that he had some
very good reasons for (curently) choosing superchargers over turbochargers.
This is from memory, and I have neither a turbo- nor a super-charged car,
but I think it's accurate. Apologies to Steve if I mis-speak.

There are basically two (reasons).  First:  Recall that engine power is
fundamentally a function of how well you can fill the cylinder(s) with
air/fuel. Compared to a normally aspirated motor, the addition of a
(low-boost, say 0.5bar) supercharger tends to "raise and flatten" the power
curve nicely so that the power band is quite broad. Put another way, even a
peaky (hp-wise) motor ends up, with the addition of a supercharger, with a
much flatter and wider (i.e. "torquey") hp curve. This is because the
supercharger has a linear "multiplicative effect" at all rpm (up to a
limit) with regards to cylinder filling. The supercharger's
filling-ability-vs-rpm curve is a linear ramp, and when multiplied by the
engine's hp-vs-rpm curve, tends to raise the low- and mid-rpm regions while
holding the high-rpm region from falling off too quickly.  A turbocharger's
curve is much more peaky in the middle, and it only aggravates a peaky hp
curve. 

The second reason is simple economics.  Today's conventional engines all
run compression ratios that are much too high for a turbo - a teardown
w/piston replacement becomes necessary - $$$.  Plus, exhaust plumbing is
often difficult to deal with, as the necessary room may not be available.
However, 0.5bar or so of supercharger boost is often  well-suited to a
10+:1 engine - the new M3 runs at 10.5:1 or something and gives 240hp -
Steve expected to get more than 300 out of a mildly supercharged version.

Hope this helps,


Andrew

Subject: Re: 914 Project


Dear Bart,

If only the front panel gutter is rusted, it is easy to fabricate and install
new "C" channel or purchase a repro piece from a reputable 914 parts
supplier. The same supplier would stock an excellent galvinized rear trunk
floor as well. If you absolutely need a complete front panel, ask the
supplier to supply old new stock or used (unless you have a '75-'76 914) as
Porsche only supplies the '75-'76 variety that will not fit the earlier cars
without modification.

We have used POR-15 for years and like it so much that we have become a
distributor. Although expensive ($1950/pint), a little goes a long way to
permanently solving the rust problem and providing a good base for
refinishing.

Rear decklids can be repaired if you have a lot of time and patience. We
first cut out the rust with a die grinder and then dig out the foam. After
then soaking the hole with POR-15 and letting dry we cut and weld in new
sheetmetal, grind and bodywork. If the framing underneath where the trunk
latch attaches is rusted, it is then not worth fixing. Fiberglass has never
worked well for rear deck lid repair and not worth the time investment.
Finally, fiberglass rear decklids are for racing only. They will not stand
trunk spring tension, are never able to be made smooth, fit poorly and
distort at high speeds! Don't abuse your 914 with a rear fiberglass lid!

Subject: Re: tires for 914


Dear Chris, Michael, Porschephiles:

Tires have evolved substantially since the 914 was first manufactured. If
only wider street tires were available back then who knows what rave reviews
the 914 would have received for its handling!

We recommend the following tire sizes for stock 914-4 steel or alloy wheels:
(Many aftermarket wheels, originally designed for VW Bug (like EMPI or
RIVIERA) have an outset that will not accomodate the widest tires).
     1. 165x15 stock size original equipment for concours display or old
people wanting the softest ride.
     2. 185/70x15 stock size original equipment for concours display or old
people wanting the softest ride.
     3. 195/60x15 for autocrossers on a budget. Lower than stock height, will
affect speedometer readings, lowers the car, good footprint, not recommended
for street use.
     4. 195/65x15 Great all around choice for the 914. Very near stock
height, good foot print fits wheel well. Good buy for the money.
     5. 205/60x15 Must be purchased with 2 rating and stiffest side wall as
the tire bulges out from the 5-1/2 inch wheel. Good tire for high speed
racers who heed the ultimate width under the stock fender wells. Near stock
height.

All of the above choices fit under the stock 914 fender wells when mounted on
a factory wheel. You will notice fender well to tire differences side to
side, however. This is normal; 914 body dimensions vary. Always remember,
though, the wider the tire, the more sensitive it is to the road. As a
result, increased noise and a harsher ride are to be expected. (A wider tire
does also not work as well in snow and rain as it wears.)

Subject: Re: Windows


Dear Nathan and all,

1970 - 72 and early '73 914s with a 4732900-- serial number suffered from
poor window mechanisms. The problem was corrected wonderfully in 1973, but
unfortunately, all 914-6 owners and we early 914-4 owners have to suffer.

The windows can successfully be adjusted, but we first need to make some
preliminary determinations and repairs (in no particular order):

     1. Since this particular mechaninsm used glued-on guide rails instead of
window felts, it is very important to make sure the guides, have not
loosened. The front guide is firmly glued to the front edge of the window and
four rollers are attached to it. In the rear, the bottom corner has glued to
it a combination steel platic guide. Often the rivets break and the part
falls apart and into the bottom of the door. This causes the window to
cockeye in the track. Rerivet the part and glue firmly to the rear lower
corner of the glass. Grease both the front and rear window guides.
     2. The window regulator button:  Originally snapped onto the regulator
guide pin, this button slid front and rear in a horizontal channel, pushing
the window up or down! With this small button bearing the weight of the
window glass, it was bound to fail. As the regulator strained to push up a
stiff window in dirty loose window guides, the button would pop off, the
regulator pin and the window would come crashing down, usually shattering
into a thousand pieces. Since this button is not available without purchasing
a complete window regulator, we purchase an excellent reproduciton from
Dennis Deeds of the 914 Owners' Association, install it, pin it with a cottor
key so it will not be able to pop off and lubricate the horizontal C channel.
     3. The window regulator:  Clean with solvent and thoroughly reoil (not
grease!)
     4. Chassis sag:  This causes a tight door gap and very tight upper
window fit. The sag can be caused first by rust or just by age (on a rust
free car). The solution is to either replace the rusted panels and/or pull
the chassis on a frame manchine. We have had to pull several cars to achieve
proper door/window adjustment even though these 914s had never been wrecked
or rusted. Check door fit carefully starting at the front. Make sure the door
aligns with the cowl and the gap is perfectly uniform to the front fender.
Make sure the door and fender make one perfect curve (you can check this with
a plastic straight edge). If in perfect alignment in the front, check the
rear. The door should fit evenly top to bottom with uniform crack (above the
door latch, the gap will naturally be wider). Ignore the latch cup fit as the
alignment here is always off. Finally, check door to quarter panel
smoothness.
     5. Vertical roll bar and top side seals:  if not fresh and factory
originals a good glass seal cannot be obtained. Make sure the top is squarely
latched into the windshield frame and onto the rollbar. Most aftermarket sels
fit poorly and as adjustment becomes critical, they fail to comply. Close the
rolled up window against the seal to check for uniform front to rear contact.
Since the glass cannot be bent, if uniform seal is not achieved, the seals
are mismounted. Adjust or bend their attachment gutters.
        A. Rear window guide cap. This holds tight the rear glass when it is
rolled up. If broken or missing, the window will rattle with looseness and
not seal.

If all of the above is corrected, window adjustment is easy:
     1. The annodized front window guide adjusts forward backward in and out
by way of a 13mm nut and slotted adjusting lug sunk into the bottom inside
edge of the door (no reason to remove the door panel). This adjustment will
move the glass towad or away from the top side seal or higher in the front or
lower in the rear or vise-versa. If the annodized divider is factory correct,
the upper black vent window cap rests easily into the windshield top seal
with its edge and the seals edge in alignment.
     2. Window stop:  at front edge of door underneath at the front of the
window regulator, it allows the window to roll up higher or lower. Perfect
height is when the vent window cap and front glass make a smooth curve
together (loosen adjusting screw for height and tighten to shorten). 
     3. Rear window guide:  adjusts with two phillips screws at the rear
bottom of the door. It allows the rear of the window to be adjusted in or
out.

The above operation should achieve perfect window fit on all 70 - early 73
914 models. Always keep the window guides lubricated and the window seals
lubricated with silicon grease.

Could someone explain to me why? If you compare two engines - one with a
turbo and one with a supercharger - both set to 0.5 bar. Why should the
supercharger be "kinder" to the p&c's? They both has the same preassure,
thus giving the same effective preassure to the chamber, so what's
the difference? They should be equal "bad" for the cylinders...

I don't get it.

   It will be interesting to see what a 993-based RS America would consist
of and, more importantly, what it would sell for.  Given the price of the
standard 993, it would seem that the RS version would potentially be priced
near a loaded 968.  Granted, this assumes that a 993 RS would be a stripper
model like the 964-based RSA to keep costs down... 


On factory-built racing P-cars...
   I don't know if anyone else saw this, but Porsche Motorsports has been 

advertising a successor to the 3.8 RSR called the GT-2 in Autoweek.  Based
upon the picture and the description, it looks to be a 993-based wide chassis
(possibly the same platform as the twin-turbo) running, most likely, an 

updated 3.8L.  This time, though, the didn't give a price like they did with
the 3.8 RSR...

That's a "about 9 hours labor" estimate, most likely. Does not cover
replacement, just re-bending and painting. When my 911 got rear-ended,
the offending party's insurance paid $3200 just to replace the whole
right rear quarter panel with new FACTORY metal... Of course, she *DID*

That's a tad low, but you may be able to find them for that.

Seems about right for the "real" part -- AIR, etc make them cheaper but
may require more labor for right fit and finish.

That also seems low. Check Stoddard for a good benchmark price.

Yes, there was a Club Sport option, for Europe only. This option was never

may have included roll cage and racing seats and harnesses.

| Hi group,
|
| I've developed a problem with my C2 I'd like some advice about. Under braking
| the front end shimmys. The car rides fine the rest of the time, no shimmy,

|
| 	A) Is there any thing else I should look for as a cause?

If this is happening only on braking, then warped rotors are a likely cause. It
is worth ensuring that the rest of the front end is tight and properly 
aligned. I
think a bad toe setting could cause problems like this, as could bad ball
joints.

| 	B) Is there anyway to inspect the rotors while there on the car?

Yes, if the wheel bearings are in good condition and properly set, then a
dial indicator can be used to determine if the rotor runout is within spec.
My front rotors are borderline wrt the spec and I can detect a slight, well,
I would call it a vibration rather than shimmy, under heavy braking. I don't
worry about it since I have floating calipers. It would probably be more
of a concern with multiple piston calipers such as yours, since more
stress would be transfered into the caliper frame and the steering
knuckle.

Gee...only $2K per pint.  Or perhaps you could just buy another
car which doesn't have any rust?  :-)

What is the "net wisdom" re: welding metal reinforcing patches
overtop of existing metal (a la 914 chassis stiffening kit).  What
would be the correct procedure to install such a kit so you don't
induce corrosion?  I've seen a couple of "homemade" jobs that
are rusty as hell so right now, my kit is sitting in a box.

George:  Do you strip the car, paint POR-15 on the areas to be
welded, then lay the 16-guage piece of metal overtop and
procede with the welding?  Then what?  More POR-15 followed
by paint, undercoating, and "flexible" paint?

Living on the Canadian West Coast, rust is a major concern.

On the subject of 914 tires....I've been told I'm a little insane,
but I stuffed 8x15 wheels with 225/50 tires on my 914.  After some
quality time with a large brass drift (my friend didn't have a baseball
bat), we managed to get the front tires to fit - with only slight rubbing
going over bumps and really hard corners.  As for the rears - where
did I put my chainsaw....???

Although not entirely practical, I must admit it looked damn cool
having 9 inches of tread planted on the ground with stock front
fenders....believe what people say about rough riding 50-series
tires though - I began to memorize where all the cracks in the
pavement were.  :-)

Oh yeah - don't even think about doing this to your 914 unless
you plan on having flares installed.  The 225's are just too
damn big.

It's not that 205s are too short, it's that the 50 series aspect
ratio is too short for a 205 width on a 5.5" rim... So if you can
find some 195/50s...

I'd *HIGHLY* recommend that you try to score some 15x7s, and run 
those. I've even run 15x8s on a couple of 914-6s with the fat
fenders, runing 225/50x15s, with simply spectacular results.

Subject: Superchargers

It is about 35 years, but in 1959 I bought into a roots blower and
put it onto my bug.  The performance about matched the 356 super
that the guy in the basement apartment below me had.  What a nice
sleeper.  The only clue was that the engine cover was popped a
couple of inches.  It would blow off the usual sleepy Chevvy V8's.

Alas, neither the crank or clutch were up to it and I removed it
after a couple of months of great fun.  Part of my deal was to sell
it to the Porsche owner when I was done.  I don't think it was
ever used again.  Wish I still had it.

A real supercharger is a nice thing.  It has no turbo lag.  It
simply boosts the pressure into the engine at all revs, but it
isn't as 'free' as the turbo which extracts its energy out of
'wasted' exhaust.  It is a cheap way to horsepower, but in a
modern engine with real-world gas isn't so easy to slip on.

They're actually OK even as rain tires, provided you just have wet

Er, stripping that bolt out is easier than you think. At least I don't think
I am a bozo...

I am doing the valves and other sundry work on my '84 944. I went to remove
the cam gear and discovered that M10 internal drive (12 pt.) bolt. I found a
tool at a jobber's auto supply that fit it. It had the star patern on 
one end and
a 7/16" hex on the other, so one could put it into a 7/16" socket. 
Well, its been
my (sorry) experience that these internal drive fasteners strip out when the
driver is not seated all the way so that the full bearing surface is not being
used. So, being a woodworker as well, I took a large bar clamp and placed
it around the cam tower to hold the internal driver bit firmly into the 
bolt. This was
all on my workbench, BTW, I had already removed the head and taken it
to the machine shop for milling and a valve job. So I clamped the cam
tower to my workbench, propped the end of the driver bit with some wood
blocks and put a 12" cresent wrench on it. Started pressing, thought,
"geez, this is tight" and pressed a little harder. Then it moved, or so
I thought. Took the wrench and moved it to the next pair of flats and
pressed again. This time it moved too easily; the bolt head was stripped.
I don't know how I could have been more careful. Maybe these bolts
are a one shot deal. They are, after all, torqued to 65Nm. Anyone have
any suggestions on a way to avoid stripping this bolt?

We recently put oil into our 993 for the first time (as the dipstick was at

stands now, pressure is basically pegged at 5 bar when the engine is at
2000rpm+. Is this correct pressure? (Note: we live in the NE, and as its been
pretty cold, I gather this does increase pressure.)

Also, regarding the suggestions posted as to keeping oil levels on the low

I kind of doubt the claimed power increase, most vendors advertise a
significant exageration over the dyno'd reality... HOWEVER I do *NOT*
doubt that you an build a 3.0 or 3.2 based car that makes 100+ HP over
stock using a blower...

This is a full-on re-engineering job, if you want to get it right. For
a few years now, I've wanted to buy a late 930 with a bad motor and
rebuild it for a Paxton blower instead of a turbo. Why? Well, the motor
and drive train and chassis are already set up for handing both
higher combustion chamber pressures *AND* greater power to the wheels!

*THAT* looks like a reasonable project, but will almost certainly require
significant tweaking, since I'll have to come up with a better exhaust
system that will still pass emissions, and since I'll probably want to
play with the injection. Putting a blower on an otherwise stock engine
is an invitation to have something EXPENSIVE break from being over
stressed...

Feh. Sure, along with using Slick-50 and synthetic oil that you only
need to change every 100,000 miles... Do The Math. Power means extra
heat of combustion and extra loading on all loaded parts. That means
that if you exceed the rated load, it doesn't matter *WHAT* RPM you 
do it at, things won't last as long...

Indeed, if it were only all true, you'd be right... You *CAN* make real
power with a blower, whereas most of the other stuff is horse puckey.
Problem is, how does it load the rest of the SYSTEM?

Superchargers?!?

Actually I think the name of the company that makes the supercharger is here
in Knoxville, TN. Their name is German Auto and their phone # is
615-691-1541. German Precision is in Sunnyvale, CA and does machine work.
Both advertise in Excellance and Pano so its an easy mistake.

Subject: Early 911 question

Hi everyone.
Yesterday, I saw a really neat looking car. It was an early 911, early 
70's I think. It was a really deep glossy red- more like Ferrari Red than 
Guards Red.

It had chrome headlight rings, and I don't remember if it had old or new 
style bumpers- I think the old style, with chrome trimmed indicator 
lights too. At the back, it had a ducktail spoiler, and the decklid said 
"911S." 

So would this be a '74 or '75 911S? I think the ducktail spoiler came out 
in '73, with the Carrera RS, right?

Just to satisfy my curiosity.....

==================
Another in what seems and endless list of "oil related" questions on 911's.

We recently put oil into our 993 for the first time (as the dipstick was at
the very low end) and have noticed a marked increase in oil pressure. As it
stands now, pressure is basically pegged at 5 bar when the engine is at
2000rpm+. Is this correct pressure? (Note: we live in the NE, and as its been
pretty cold, I gather this does increase pressure.)

Also, regarding the suggestions posted as to keeping oil levels on the low
side, we've been told that the car can actually be down several quarts of oil
before any engine damage can possibly occur. Is this really true?
=================================

I doubt that your new car was low in oil. How did you check the level?
Are you aware that oil levels on 911s should be checked at operating temps,
with the engine running at idle, and measured after about 1 minute or so to 
give the oil system a chance to stabilize itself? This procedure is fully
described on the owners manual.

If you did not follow the procedure, you might have TOO MUCH oil in your
engine!

    Neither do I--whether the compressor is driven off the crank or off
  the exhaust, physically it still has to  heat up the air. Is there an
  intercooler available for this supercharger ?

    The one explanation I can fathom for adding a supercharger without
  lowering the compression ratio is that (given the same cam profile) the
  overlap at low RPMs is going to give you a lower effective compression
  ratio and a richer (cooler) mixture. An engine with a cam grind tuned for  
  peak Hp at 6krpm might be okay with boost at lower RPM, but at high RPM it
  seems like high compression and high boost would be an expensive problem.
    My understanding is that a correctly engineered supercharged engine works
  better with a cam with quick ramps and low overlap/duration, the bolt-on 
  approach must take advantage of the fact that the car was never really made 
  for boost...I can't imagine how a 9.8:1 compression ratio is going to 
  survive with any boost, no matter how its blown.

   Seems like a cheaper way to get wheelspin is by spooning Nitrous Oxide.

Subject: 1st Time Porsche Buyers

This forum and others seem to offer lots of advice on buying particular
Porsche models, but first time buyers are often overwhelmed with the "mystic"
of the marque and rush into a purchase irrespective of "cooling down" for
reflective thoughts.

I offer my suggestions as an owner of Porsches for almost 35 years covering
nearly every model (no 924s and thankfully another buyer got the US spec
factory 928 that I offered to buy in Germany in 1983).

To put the recommendations in perspective, most of you are familar with the
fine magazine called "Excellence".  I have thought many times that an
accompanying Porsche-interest publication should be called "Arrogance".
 (Interestingly, the original title of "Excellence" was changed perhaps due
to arrogance).

Porsche rarely (and sometime almost never) gets it "right" in early serial
production of new passenger cars.  Chain tensioners, exploding clutches, AC
design and integration, cam timing belts, etc are all examples of a stubborn
refusal to change when change is long overdue.  Part of this may be due to
the truly brilliant beginnings of Ferdinand Porsche as a  superb "inventor"
who often encountered  difficulties with the companies  he worked for on
transitioning ideas into production.  (Except for the VW "Kubelwagen
derivatives, he probably should have been awarded an Allied decoration in WW
II since most of his overly complex designs could not be maintained on the
battlefield and  severly taxed German R&D resources and production
capabilities in futile attempts to get them into volume production ...but
A.H. liked him!)  But again, the true "father" of Porsche production
automobiles (outside VW) is Ferry not Ferdinand.

I suspect, however, the real reason is "us" ...Americans.   Starting in the
late 1950s, Americans started "fawning" over the Porsche mystic
fanned by the admiration for a small company who enjoyed considerable racing
success with mini-motors against much larger competitors.  I too, on $300 per
month plunged deeply into debt in Germany purchasing a 62 356 for $3862 when
I could get a VW (with sunroof) for $1426..   As Porsche progressed, company
officials, particularly in marketing and sales, believed they could sell
anything at any price and dismiss "shortcomings"  as unknowledgable views of
the unappreciative.  This philosophy reached a high point in the late 70s and
early 80s (unfortunately under the leadership of a german-born American) when
the cars were loaded with unneeded, unwanted "conveniences" (what air
conditioning?) that increased weight, selling price, with often  poor
dependability and high cost to maintain without  commensurate increase in
"fun to drive".  But sales volume and company profit continued to climb
through 1986 to where California sales alone in the US outweighed those in
Germany in total..

But a lot of newfound affluent buyers (apologies to Lawyer & Doctors)
found even they did not  like the cars after buying on impulse ("Not like my
Eldo or even my wife's SL").  Why even Ferry drove a MB 6.9 to work and
parked in his spot at the office complex in Ludwigburg.

Some of the more blatantly arrogant have left Porsche A.G. through retirement
or other "circumstances".  (If you want real humor, read the "Dr. Ing Prof
XXX departed the company on YYY to return to the University of Gottdamerung"
 in Christophorus).   The plunging sales and the disasterous bottom line
(they now predict returning to profitibilty in business year 1995) with
significant employment layoffs and terminations may have helped quell the
arrogance-factor...We'll have to wait and see.  (Will the Chinese People's
Republic be the fawning devotees of the year 2000?)

Enough of my unbiased views of the past.   I would add to recommendations
already made in Panorama on buying:

1) Stick to the latest cars in a series, (i.e. 87-89 Carreras, 80-83 SCs,
etc).   Porsche does make modest  changes over time.

2) Avoid the "sickies" (i.e. 2.7 litre Alusil 911s from 75-77) unless you
want only a garage car or trailered concours piece.

3) Pay the 20-25 percent premium for a quality, well-maintained, low mileage
car (under 50K) rather than an "I can fix it just like a Beetle" that you
think is a " find".

4) Ask someone who had one.  Call on ads in Pano and negotiate.

5) Pay someone to do a pre-purchase check unless the car is mint original low
mileage with verifiable records.  The $50-$100 spent will save much later
anxiety.

6) Don't fall in love with the "Mystic".  Most make great 2nd, 3nd, or 4th
cars, but if you have to have rock solid daily dependability, buy a pickup or
SUV, and enjoy your Porsche on weekends.

This posting is not a condemnation and I still "like" Porsches in spite of
their often not-admitted weaknesses.  Yes, I've driven the new 993/911 ("It
has 36 percent more luggage space"....But for what kind of luggage!).
   Unfortunately, either the price, luxury/sales/gas guzzler  taxes,
continued quirks, or my own advancing age and memory don't seem to give it
the "fun to drive/$" factor of the early 911s.     We'll see if the Boxster
can wrest the Miata from my wifes grip.....but that's another story.

Very interesting and well thought out note! Of course, what else would

of comments...

Arrogance on the part of PCNA -- it was a litigation issue, as the publisher
was served with papers saying he'd best cease and desist in using the 
name "Porsche" in his magazine masthead... The new name, "Excellence",
with the subhead "A Magazine about Porsche Cars" was a compromise, and
PCNA *STILL* wasn't happy about seeing "Porsche" on the cover, even though
in that context they could do little about it...

In that vein, did you know that even the *silhouette* of the 356 and 911 is
copyrighted? And that if you *REALLY* want to make life difficult for
a non-dealer mechanic that has a Porsche crest, logo, banner, etc displayed,
all you have to do is call Reno and complain about someone using the
copyrighted materials?? (asking about their "dealer" at such-and-such
address usually does the trick too... 8{) ) Ditto Mercedes -- I've
seen them come out with a lawyer and make shop owners paint the star
over on the side of the building right then while they waited...

Or later versions. I joke that "German Engineering" is best at taking
a Bad Idea and then *PERFECTING* it.... The 911 should have been moved
to wet belt drive roughly forever ago.

Nope. No *unless* on this one. I've seen clever fakery that you needed a
qualified and experienced person to spot. And even low mile cars that
*look* "mint" can have significant problems...

I had the same problem w/ my car when I bought it.  After

That alone did not solve the problem.  I also found a

contact.  After fixing that I have had no troubles for 3+ yrs.
The def switch is an interesting twist, maybe it helps the fan

James,

You didn't mention what model car you own.

With respect to new bolts, I would re-use the ones you have unless
there is a problem with them.  If they are corroded or the threads are
distorted or damaged, replace them.  I wouldn't use fasteners from
the hardware store, though.  There is just a little too much counter-
feit fasteners and other kinds of junk sold there.

The easiest thing to do for you is probably to buy the bolts from
a Porsche dealer, or any German car dealer.  They may be a few
cents more than another source, but it's quick and you are guaranteed
a quality part.

There were "Club Sport" editions of most of the models available in the late

the front right fender.

Eric is probably thinking of some other editions of the car.  There were
Firehawk versions of the 944, 944S, and 944S2 available in the US, but
probably only really available to racers who asked for them.  Per the series

Subject: Shift Linkage position question.

Hi,

I posted last week about how my shifter in my 911SC seemed to
be stuck in gear.  Well, with all the responses about how to fix
it, last night I removed the plate just in front of the rear
seats, and sure enough, the C-clamp and bolt had lossened up and
the shift linkage came unattached from the tranny input shaft.

It was stuck in third gear, not 4th.  Is it a matter of preference
how far onto the input shaft the clamp must go?  By varying this
distance, the position of the shift lever in relation to the driver
while shifting can be changed.  As much as 3-4 inches.  I just set it
to where it was before, or thereabouts, and tightened it up.  
Thanks again for all the help.  Now I can get around to cleaning
the car up and winterizing it.  

One question, is it bad to wax a car when the temperature is
just above freezing, like say 35-40 degrees F.?  Will the wax rub off
or will it even stick on the car?

Chances are that it was a 911S that someone added a spoiler to... Could have

Around here (in New York State) what you can do is look at the registration

can give you a pretty good shot...

Subject: Superchargers


Hi all,

I've been reading the thread about superchargers. Yes, the supercharger
will add a better torque curve. But it has a big price (as does a 
turbocharger).

Depending on the boost, there will be a larger load put on the top half of 
the rod bearing shell. More heat generated at a lower rpm from the 
additional load. Displacement-type superchargers (Roots, etc) tend to take
some of that new horsepower for themselves. Impeller type (Paxton, Vortech)
have characteristics similar to a turbocharger, they have gear trains to 
step up the driven speed. Boost curves for both vary. There is also the 
vane type supercharger (McCulloch, B&M), I have had many problems with them.

Now for some history. Early tinkerers found that the early superchargers 
added power to the old flat-head Ford V-8 (Model B 4 cylinders, too). The
bearing material of the day would not take the added stress of the 
artificially raised compression ratio. Fact is, they didn't like milled 
heads or anything over 9.2:1 very long. The big end of the rod would
get hot from the load on the bearing, eventually tossing the bearing 
material (and the rod). The early oiling systems did little more than get
 SOME oil to the rods. If you were lucky, you had a rod that was a 
beautiful blue from the heat. If you weren't, it went out the side of 
the block. Those that toasted their engines this way were called "hot-
rodders", a derogatory term at first (meaning you didn't have enough sense
to treat the machinery right).

Porsches should be able to physically take the added load. The oiling system
is plenty adequate. I would LOWER the static compression on any of the
engines selected to that of the like Turbo model. Then I would add boost
to equate to 11.5:1 at the highest delivery rate. All superchargers have
a cavitation point, the point where no more air can be passed. Select
a model that can deliver 5% more than your engine can at redline. 

Why use a supercharger or turbocharger? The make mucho torque as well as
horsepower. You can use taller gears, get a higher top speed. That was
the goal of a lot of those kids in the late 30s and 40s. The supercharger
can give you much better low end, depending on the coupling ratio. 

My last supercharger installation was on a 5.0 Ford Mustang. It was a very
nicely done Vortech kit with a 4-pound boost, .27 bar or so. With a
static 9.5:1 compression, it is enough to get 35 more real horsepower and
a much better low-end response.

Remember, horsepower and torque are produced by compressing fuel. The higher
the compression, the better response (this assumes it is a decent engine in 
the first place and the fuel is good). This is one of the reasons I feel
chips are hype, you can dick around with enrichment and timing, but the cam,
compression and combustion chamber really get you more power.

Kevin -

The 625 figure that you have heard is correct, but should be interpreted 
as couples and not individuals.  The PCA Parades haven't sold out 
(oversubscribed is their term) since the late 80's.

In fact, last years Parade was still advertising openings a month or so 
before the event.

They are real serious about the date if it oversubscribed.  Then the 625 
figure is used.  first they deduct from 625 the amount of National office 
members, then they deduct Region presidents going leaving the balance of 
regular members.  The amount then accepted from any region is based on 
the size of the region (although four couples/members are guaranteed 
from each region) and  percentages are used to arrive at the total 
allowed from your region.

Hope this helps.

Well, I guess it was just wistful thinking that this wouldn't make it to 
the list.  [Thanks Dave ol' buddy]

During my last run last weekend (sixth of six, not just the last run I 
made...) I had a somewhat "interesting" experience.

Came up to a turn, lifted and started my turn-in.  Well, I lifted the 
*pedal* anyway.  Throttle stayed on, though possibly not 100% [things
were happening just a little fast  :-O ].

At this point I'm heading for the weeds, brakes on, car not slowing.  Finally
get the clutch in (should have gone for the ignition in retrospect) and get 
the car down to around 10-15 mph before hitting dirt.

Fortunately dirt is soft, there's no great bloody ditch like there is 100
yards
to my left, initial berm is not too high, and car is almost straight to berm 
when I hit.

Ignition off.

Open door (door opens normally!!!).

Yell to course worker to *go back and get fire extinguisher.*  [Not necessary,

weed are damp]

Restart engine, "high" idle, shut off engine

Work throttle, seems normal.  Open engine compartment and work throttle; all
still seems normal.  Start car and get normal idle.  Weird.

4 or 5 people push car back onto pavement.

Drive back to parking area.  Car seems normal.

Look for damage.  Can't find any shiney or bent metal.  Drive home.  No new 
wind noise.

On drive home, there is a slight pull to the right.  As soon as I put the
street 
tires back on the car, it's off to the shop for allignment and corner ballance

check.  I had the car alligned and corner ballanced a few months ago, so I 
should get a good idea if anything's really out.  For now, I'll tell myself
that
it *could* be the front tires (wheels were turned and locked) that's causing
the pull.


Lesson:  Remove cruise control on 911sc's that you auto-x.  I suspect that 
the CC cable is what hung up.  Mostly this is a guess based on lack of any 
other suspects, but I've never really been happy with the CC cable 
arrangement.

Everything considered, I'd rather rally the truck.

The really annoying part is that up to that point, it really looked like it
was going to be my best run!

Hi,

I'm new to this list, have a question regarding 356SCs.  I am looking to buy
one, a coupe, as cheap as possible but in full working order and reasonably
solid.

Currently, I am living in New York for a year, but will then return to London.
 Are 356s sufficiently easier to find and cheaper here in the US to make it
worthwhile getting a car here, with the aim of taking it back to the UK later
(considering that it would be LHD, plus the import costs etc.)

Also, can people give me a rough idea of what amount I should be looking to
pay.  I have found a 64 356SC for $6000 (maybe get it for $5500/5000) over

  Having owned a couple of 944 Turbos in the past I could
see how someone might get that impression that Porsche's
are not reliable enough for use as an only car.  [My 951's and
my friend's had distressingly small MTBFs.]  One only has to
see/break the live plastic hinge used on the storage compartment
between a 944/944T seats to see that quality may not be universally
present in these cars.
  I suspect 928 owners (no flames please) may suspect that
Porsche may be performing one of those tests, you know the 
one that goes like this:
 "We've secretly switched the electrical components in this
 fine car for Lucas electrics.  Let's see if they notice."
  On the other hand, my 911 seems to be quite well behaved
in the short time I've had it.  Perhaps Porsche quality "problems"
are related to their small build number and the greater
amount of handwork involved.  
  It's all right to love the marque but I think one should also view them
from the "beauty is as beauty does" perspective.  In this light, I think
they are still worthy of a place in our hearts.

 vrooom,

	I have the 2-wheel drive version here in the Vail valley, CO and 
have no complaints. I also have the 17" wheels, but I feel that it is 
also an unnecessary expense. The ABD is only important if you think you 
will get one wheel stuck. It only makes sure that both wheels are going 
the same speed (approx.) at all times, it does not modulate acceleration 
overall, only on one side at a time. I had to deliberately put one wheel 
on ice and the other on dry pavement to get it to come into play. The 
limited slip by itself is probably adaquate for most buyers. I happen to 
like electric seats, but the manual seats would weigh less. The base 
"strippo" model with limited slip is quite a car, as is.

In the December 94 Issue of excellence David Coleman writes

"The already inviting price of the Carrera 4 looks even better when you
consider that several of it's standard features, like 17 inch alloys, 
dynamic
driving differential, and ABD are all pricey options on the Carrera 2. In 
fact
if you add just those three important options to the base price of the 
$59,900
C-2, you end up with a car costing only $2,000 less than the C-4. And $2,000
seems rather a small price to pay for the added sophistication of the C-4's
four wheel drive, viscous center coupling, and front differential axle gear"

Subject: Supercharged 911=Nasty sleeper


    With all this writing about supercharged boxer motors, I just wanted to
add my viewpoint:

    Supercharged Porsches are just plain nasty sleepers.

    I say this from a personal experience which was both disappointing and
enlightening.

    There I was, sitting in traffic with my recently finished 1956 Chevy
(don't condemn me yet), a car which I built to go really fast in a straight
line.  And it indeed goes really fast in a straight line.  With only seven
hundred miles on the fresh motor, I had been taking it rather easy while
trying to get used to the overpowered gas-guzzler.
    Low and behold, I found myself talking to the owner of a 1989 911 in the
car next to me.  I was asking him where he had his rims polished (his rims
were polished), because I wanted to have the rims polished on my 1984
Cabriolet Widebody (911's always look good with polished Fuchs).
    Before long, we were holding up traffic, I was asking about his 911, and
he was asking about my Chevy (it's a Nomad, brings back the feeling of the
muscle of 60's,  and it is a classic).  He tells me to meet him at the Diner
which is about 800 feet up the road.  Just our luck, we end up next to each
other at the stoplight.  I think that he is in the bag, as of this car is much
quicker than any 911 I have ever been in or had the pleasure to race against.
    Well, the light turned green.  He took off while I was trying to get at
least one wheel to stop spinning.  When the tires spun into second, I knew
that I would never catch him.  By the time I hit third, He was in the lot.
    I pulled in and shut my car off.  Getting of the car, I complimented him
on his car and immediately asked to see the motor.  Well, he opened up the
lid, but all that could be seen was a HUGE Paxton, a rather large K&N, and two
distributors.  I crawled under only to see a set of stainless headers.  Surely
this was a professional rig.
    The car was quick, and he claimed 0-60 was well under 4.0 (I am not so
sure about this one).  A definite sleeper. From the outside, a regular run of
the mill bone stock 911, underneath a 3.5 (or maybe it was a 3.4)
supercharged, twin plug, fire breathing monster!!!
    All I can say is that not many cars are quicker off the line than my
Chevy, but I was clearly outclassed.

    Just goes to show you that it is not always the big motor that wins at the
Drags.

    In more recent news, the Chevy is up for sale to fund a 3.4 or 3.5 for the
Cabriolet.  Maybe even twin plugs, turbos, and...

First, "Grade 8" means SAE Grade 8 (in accordance with SAE
J429, if I remember right).  That means the bolt is alloy steel
with an ultimate strength of 150ksi minimum and a yield
of 130ksi (all of this is from memory - forgive any slight
errors).  As to what you should use in your application, try
to replace the bolt/nut with the equivalent of what was there.
Look at the head of the bolt - any markings along the lines
of "8.8" or "10.9"?  These are metric strength ratings.  For
instance, 8.8 means the ultimate strength is 800MPa and the
yield is 80% of the ultimate or 640MPa.  If I remember right,
the conversion from MPa to PSI is .00689, so an 8.8 has a 
strength of about 116110psi (ultimate) and a yield of about
92888psi.  As you can see, a Grade 8 is stronger than an "8.8".
I would suggest you attempt to replace the fasteners with some of equivalent
strength.

What would be a good price for an 85 911 w/100k miles ? Is 100k alot of 
miles for a 911 ?

Re: Lou's comment on our 993 oil pressure,

We did check the oil at normal operating temp with the engine running. We too
were suprised that the car needed oil so soon (1100 miles). After putting in
the oil, the gauge is barely above level when the car is warmed up, and the
dipstick under the same conditions is about less than 2/3 up the spiral. So I
am confident the level is now good. Given that we do not have an oil leak and
that the car has shown no mechanical problems, our conclusion is that the car
must have left the dealer without being topped off.

Given all this, does our current pressure seem "normal".

Thanks for the help,

David and Cherith

Subject: Re: Your 17" wheel/tire combination...



	I have had few people ask me about my car's mods. I would like to share
my experience with you p-nuts:

I bought an 84 Euro 911 from a 2nd owner who had it for only two months. He said he
he lost his job and was selling the car.Anyway, I got it and started adding some
things to it. This is my first Porsche of any kind, so keep that in mind. Here
are the mods I did to it (the car drove very well stock):

17" Turbo look wheels, 8 and 9's. They are 944 offset and each weigh in at about
6-8 lbs more than the stock wheels w/o rubber. They are silver finish and are
made in Japan. They run very true  and I am happy with them.

Yok AVS-I 265-40/17 on the rear, came from my ex Supra turbo. Excellent, see my
previous email.

Dunlop D40M2 215-45/17 on the front, YES, YES, My buddy and I rolled the lips
and it works great. 

Lowered the car about .75". there is minimum clearance left between tires and
body, but it works so far.

KYB shocks, cheap but they work very well indeed for my kind of driving.

'87 Factroy sway bars and new bushings (want to sell old ones if interested)

MOMO steering wheel with 1/2" spacer and 13.2" diameter.

Turbo knob and leather boot.

Factory short shift, prefered over aftermarket.

930 tie rods and boots.

Steering rack spacers to correct bump steer.

Ferodo brake pads, street compound. Front does NOT have sensor pockets, rears
do... go figure!!

Motul brake fluid, flush and bleed.

27 mm rear torsion bars.

Adjustable spring plates and bushings.

Weltmeister banana arm bushings and special grease from Automotion, no squeeks
yet and driven in the rain.

Carrera rear wing , used, Factory. Front spoiler, new, Factory.

Installed new Targa top my self and did an ok job, better next time.

Bursch exhuast system, small improvement in low to mid range when used off
road with a test pipe. Nice sound and not loud.

Drilled air box for more air.

Car was four wheel aligned and weigh balanced with me in it at +/-20 lbs at
four corners. I think I have -1 degree rear and -.75 degree front. I have to 
get the printout from the guy. The front right will rub very slightly if I have
a lady who weighs in at 133 lbs, but will not rub with a 110 lbs lady when left
turning at speed!!! (No flaming please on this one, it is true thu)

Now, I am having problems at 2300-2400 rpm when cruising, the car hesitate and
builds up to a voilent level. If I push the gas it goes away!. Also the tranny
is getting hard to get in 1st (94k miles on the car), may be time for a rebuild.
The heat blower went on me the first time I had a date at nite and going up
a mountain road in San Jose!!! The battery lite goes on in the morning but then
goes out after a while, I think a new battery is needed.

	I drive the car daily to work since it is my only vehicle. The car
handles way better than I can drive. My friend who has a good amount of racing
and Porsche background told me he likes it more (handling) than his 84 911 with
Factory sport suspension. He tried to steal it from me and left me his 911 keys
but I caught him red handed. 

I enjoy the car every single time I turn the key on. It is better than the most
recent sex I had (does not mean much!). I am planning on a chip in the near
future, so if interested I let you  know the results. I will probably go with
Autothority one since they say they will tune the chip to your riding style
within limits. I also have a Euro model so it makes sense to me. 

I have been changing oil every 2-3k miles with Castrol 20/50, and filter every
other oil change. I am using tri-tipped plugs. Replaced air filter, fuel filter,
and tranny oil (Amsoil 75-90 Syn).

Sorry got carried away, but hope it helps.... you people who are buying 993,
get the 18" option.... you only live once!

I must be an exception - I've had nothing but good luck with my 951 over

Well, the fact that a clutch replacement is a $~1k job may qualify as

perfect weight distribution?

Subject: Buying a 356SC (very long)


Hi Dan-
Although I am no expert (not even up to novice level yet), I just 
finished buying a 1964 European spec SC (imported from Italy in 1979) 
and went through some steep learning curves that I might be able to 
help you shorten.  I am going to attach a checklist below that I made 
up for checking out cars.  FYI, I paid $8500 for a very clean Ruby Red 
car with no options on it with an engine due for an overhaul soon.  I 
believe that I got a really good deal on this car.  The only person on 
the list to have seen it so far is Pete Albrecht and he can let you 
know if I am blowing smoke on the car's condition/value.

I second the motion made to have the car checked out by someone in the 
business of 356s for at least 10 years if your serious about buying 
one example.  You can't believe what someone will pick out that you 
will miss.  I didn't look long for SCs this time, but did once about 6 
years ago and the lesson I learned then and still applies today is 
know what you want up front and don't change your mind to fit a car 
that pulls on your heartstrings.

Hope the checklist helps.
PS. I copied this note to Dan to the list to get your 
opinions/additions on the checklist. If anyone can add to it, let me 
know.  Nobody can ever hope to accumulate enough to compensate for 
experience, but this checklist should eliminate a few cars right away 
before spending too much on pre-purchase inspections.

Well, I don't think your opinions are unbiased. Opinions are, by their
nature, biased. You seem to think of your opinions as facts (since you say
they are "unbiased"). I think most people on this list will agree that
buying a Porsche (new, used or whatever) is the cheapest and most practical
way to get into a high performance car that is made by a company with a
"heritage" behind it. We all love Porsches because they are what they are.
You can take them or leave them, but I would think that everyone here takes
them, since they are here.

I own an '84 944 that in the last year and a half I have put 50k on (I
bought the car when it had 42k on it, so it now has 92k). When I bought it,
it had just had the belts and water pump done. Over the last year, I have
replaced the following:

        clutch slave cyl.: $50
        clutch: $500
        cam & balance belts: $200
        radiator: $200

In the spring, I will be installing new motor mounts (about $250 or so for
both) when I have probably put about another 12k on the car.

I bought the car for $7000 and have put about $1000 in required stuff into
the car, for a total of $8000. This means the car has cost me $.16/mile to
own and maintain (excluding gas and ins. of course). I drive the car in all
kinds of weather (it is my only car) and have never had a problem. I also
know their are others on this list who put high miles on their cars and as
long as they do the required service, don't have a whole lot of problems.

You seem to really be down on Porsche because of their engineering of their
cars (in terms of reliability). This summer, by S.O.'s '90 Mitsi Eclipse
had a timing belt falure, and bent four valves in the head (thank God for
warranties). In any case, I find out from the dealer that this problem was
created by the failure of the spring loaded cam belt tensioner. The belt
lost tention, and the car jumped time. A short time later, Mitsi had a
recall for this problem. The point is, all cars have engineering problems,
particularly early on in a model's life. I don't understand why you think
that Porsches have more problems than other cars.

Hmm ... I don't really like the Mitevac all that much (I found that the
pressure was inconsistant and therefore, it made it very hard to bleed the
system). I also think it is too expensive ...

A product known as Ez-Bleed (or something like that) is cheaper (about $20)
and provides very consistant pressure (you get the pressure from a hose
that connects to your tire - although you don't want to use anything like
30psi - you have to use low pressure so that the fluid dosen't cavitate (sp
??) and create bubbles).

The Ez-bleed has a nice big bottle that you can fill up with your fave
brake fluid and then you can just walk around and crack the bleed screws on
the brakes until you're done (it took me a couple of bottles full of brake
fluid actually - but that may just be because I like to run a lot of fluid
through the system to make sure I have all of the old stuff out ...

Just my $.000002 worth !!!

I've seen these things in various auto parts stores, although I can't
remember where right now. In any case, shouldn't be too hard to find if
this is the one you want ...

Hi, Patrick,

Good question, but it implies that you have never seen a(n) H3 bulb next to
a(n) H4 bulb.  Their bases are different sizes...

So, the short answer to your question is "NO"...

The longer answer is "try using a higher wattage H3 bulb (they are
available) and consider using a load reduction relay to cut down the chance
on burning out the switch or the fuse block due to higher amperage..."

George is, as usual, quite potty.  What you really want is a positive-

Trevor:
Certainly I agree that opinions by definition are biased but based solely on
an individual's experience or the influence of others whom they believe.  If
I did not get the point across as to my "opinion" for Porsche's stubborn
refusal to change, it was in the top part of the note.

Your experience and thus opinion are positive to date, and I would expect a
type of admiration for Porsche from the nature of the forum.  I have been
fortunate enough to have one or more American or import cars for direct
comparison in the same environment as my Porsche with presumably equivalent
engineering/production technology.  Sometimes, Porsche was a hands-on winner
(but against a 74 Dasher or Vega GT!) .  Other times the comparison against
daily (repeat daily) drivers like a 82 Accord or 90 Miata left it far behind.
 Of course the comparison is not on the track or sustained high speed,  but
there too my opinion of the MB 190-16 is far more favorable than the 84 944.
Look back at the owners reports on reliability and cost of ownership for 944s
in Consumer Reports annual..  (They never did lower volume cars like the
911).   I certainly don't dislike Porsches but I would hope I've learned to
keep their strengths and weaknesses in perspective.

Thanks for your reply.

Hey John, 

I'm not sure about Houston, but here in Las Vegas Texaco uses MTBE in 
their gasoline. You might look for a sticker on the pump that says
what kind of oxygenate that station uses. I don't think that they have to 
say WHAT they use as long as they say THAT they use it.

I had been using unspecified oxygenate gas (probably corn gas) and then
used Texaco's with MTBE and there is a noticeable difference.

Actually, you should check on your engine. The last time I bought
sparkplugs, when I read up on installing them, it said to check the
emissions plate in the engine compartment. It specified a different
plug to the one the catalog showed - in fact I believe an 8 instead of
7 (or maybe the other way round? for an 86 944). So I had to take them
back to exchange them.

So just go with what your engine asks for!

BTW a lot of people swear by platinum plugs ("P" instead of "C"). I use
them, but I've never used copper, so I can't give any comparisons.

Subject: Re: Hand-held brake bleeder kit

A couple of quick notes on this subj.

A pressure bleeder can be easily built.  I built one some years ago
with good results.

I wont take credit for the design but I cant remember where I saw it
either.

I drilled a hole in a spare fluid reservior cap and glued a tire stem
into it.  Next I purchased a hose from the local auto parts store that
had a female tire fitting on both ends.  The last piece of gear you
need is a hemostat or any sort of locking pliers.

The deal here is to apply air pressure atop the fluid reservoir using
air from a spare tire.  The hemostat is to prevent air from leaking out
of the reservoir vent tube.  When you crack the bleeder on the brake
the fluid just flows out.

Downsides: remember to fill the reservoir before you put the pressure
cap on.  This saves time spent refilling and forgetting to shut off the
supply from the spare tire and pumping up the spare a few extra times.
;)

Bigger downside:  At one point in time, I noticed that my brake peddle
was a bit sticky near the top of the return stroke and that led to some
drag on the brakes.  The cure was to depress the brake peddle to the
floor a few time to clean up what ever crud had accumlated.  This
problem never recurred.  It would probably never have occured in the
first place if I had bled the brakes the 'ol fasioned way.

Good luck and may your fluids run clear.

Christopher,

	When you order the ABD option, here, they require the limited 
slip. I assumed that was because the ABD would be working too much in 
slippery conditions and overheat all the time, whereas, with the limited 
slip the ABD comes into play only under severe differences in traction 
side to side. Driving through the snow here, my ABD has only come on 
once (as indicated by the green ABD indicator light) and that was when I 
deliberately put one tire on ice and the other on dry pavement and took 
off fast.
	Regarding 4wd, (this is meant for everyone else since you also 
have the 2wd, Christopher) I think that it is more an emotional decision 
than anything, since I just can't imagine it being that useful except 
for all out rallying and I drive my car year around in and around a ski 
resort. The magazines got hyped up because of the wonderful bit of 
marketing that Porsche has done. My personal preferences are for minimal 
weight (I shoulda left off the power seats :->). Even though the new 4wd 
adds only 80 lb, it is another 80 lbs added to the gradual upward 
creeping of the weight of the 911. I really had to argue with my wife 
because I wanted the lighter coupe and she wanted the Cab. She won!

I bought a Mityvac with the intention of using it to
bleed brakes. Since then, I have found that it is _last_
method of brake bleeding I will choose. It is nearly
impossible to tell if all the air is out of the lines since
the vacuum created by the Mityvac tends to pull
small bubbles around the bleed screw.

In defense of the Mityvac, I has found several uses
for a good vacuum/pressure pump. Everything
from testing EGR valves to power brake boosters.
The book is over a hundred pages and describes
test procedures for nearly any vacuum/pressure
related engine control system.

Overall, I like it, but not for bleeding.

Dear Ed,

I can answer both of your questions in one note.

First, no, we do nothing but Porsche and have done so since 1977. We do,
however, order wholesale from many giant parts warehouses that also stock BMW
parts so if you ever need a major mechanical part, we can at least help you
with the expense. They don't sell performance chips, however, and I do not
know to get one.

Next, I do not know where a decent 356 is available for under $10,000! We
have seven of them, but the cheapest is a 1962 coupe for $13,950. We believe
that unless we are selling a parts project, we should sell a car someone can
drive every day with success, hence we "go through" our cars and make them
reasonable. If you are interested, call and speak with Sean or me.
(404-427-2844) Thanks for your interest. Sean can probably steer you towards
a cheaper car as he talks around the nation every day!

It's hard not to fall in love with mystique.  To do so with a car that is
also
a joy to drive and rock-solid reliable is heaven.

I'm on my 4th late model Carrera.  I've run them as high as 120k miles.
In my experience these cars (and the SC's that preceded them) are as
reliable as they come...every bit as dependable as the Hondas I owned in
the 70's and 80's.  Just do what you're supposed to do to maintain them!
The problem really is that 911's are expensive to service and some
owners get in over their heads so they scrimp (or they are careless about
timely service).  And of course some  buyers try to save money by getting
a cheaper (poorer) example that was not taken care of properly.

911 reputation for reliability takes a big hit with the mid 70's models.
These cars can be had for a song, often by  first-time buyers
(unfortunately).  And of course the pre-76 ungalvanized models have a
serious rust problem.  But the cars of the last 15 years have made me a
believer.

I drive a 911 every day.  Hard on twisty roads, sluggishly in heavy
traffic, fast on open highways, in all kinds of weather.   Dependability
is just not an issue.

Subject: Purchasing a new 993

 
Hi, Kevin and Kim.
 
Colman got the numbers wrong.
 
Base C2 -- $59,900
Base C4 -- $65,900
Price of 17-inch wheels & tires for C2, std. on C4 -- $1378
Price of ABD for C2, std. on C4 -- $1195
 
Add those up, and you find that a C2 optioned to reflect the C4's standard
equipment (not counting all-wheel drive, of course) is $3427 less expensive
than the C4, not $2000. Less than 3.5K for an all-wheel-drive system is
still an incredible bargain.
 
Is it worth it? I like rear wheel drive, but the C4 is pretty amazing. I
could nail the throttle when turning a street corner in first gear in the
wet, and the car absolultely does not spin its tires. It doesn't even
change its line. For that reason, I would also get the ABD on the C2. It's
there when you need it. Before this experience, I was skeptical about the
ABD, thinking it would be some sort of kludge like Mercedes and Cadillac use,
to just dial down the engine power and apply one brake. But this thing's
operation is transparent and very effective without detracting from sporting
performance.

Brian Foster isn't blowing smoke. He got a pretty good deal. I saw the car,
it's all there, complete, and yes it needs a few things taken care of but
it's basically solid and drivable. Brian towed it to my place and wound up
driving it home.
 
I just saw a car in similar condition, perhaps slightly better, which
will sell retail in the low 20s because it has a sunroof. It would be in the

Actually the difference is $3k, assuming you compare a Carrera
with ABD and the sport package w/ 17" wheels to a C4 which
already has this.  Then there's the gas guzzler tax the C4 is subject
to (but not the Carrera -- yes...and they're only one mpg apart!).
Then factor in the dealer's inclination to reduce price (I got $6k off
the Carrera but they wouldn't budge on the C4).  The difference in
my case was almost $12k...more without the ABD and sport package.
Of course not having to wait many months for a C4 was also an
influencing factor.

There are TWO things wrong with this message:

1) IT WENT TO THE WRONG PLACE!!! Damn, can't you people *READ*??? It
   only says in *EVERY* official piece of correspondence that you 
   ever see that you send "administrative" requests such as adds,
   drops, changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com". PERIOD. Not
   to the whole list....

   If Bart Chambers didn't forward that stuff to the right place,

2) WHO THE HELL IS "tom"??? There's no headers in here, nothing that can 
   possibly be used to identify who it is that wants to be dropped.

OK, enough yelling for now. While I appreciate the effort, I'd appreciate

Subject: Porsches at Starlite


Some of you may remember the Monte Carlo Rally that my wife and I were
going on and I posted that there were openings.  Well, the rally,
Starlite, was held on Dec. 9-10 and I thought I would report, as the
Porsche Club had a good night.

Starlite this year started in Santa Barbara with first car out at 
10:01pm on Friday and arriving in Las Vegas over 13 hours later.  The
scores are kept by the 100th of a minute.  

The Santa Barbara Region of PCA had 10 cars this year for the rally
(and many of the cars this year were actually our Porsches!).
This tied for the largest club turnout.  For the novice class (no more
than 2 twelve+ hour Monte Carlos preceding this event) my wife and I
took 2nd place with an error of 7 which included 1 penalty point for
not hitting the timing hose fast enough to get both sets of wheels
across on the same 100th.  We were also early 2, then strung together
four perfect legs (all 0's), four 1 earlies, and finished the last leg
with a perfect leg.  So, for ten legs, we were 7 off (4.2 seconds).
One better and one place better than last year.

Also from our PCASB team, the Regular class (this is for people who've
run 3 or more of this style rally - some of these guys have rallied
with the same partner for 15 year!) we had the third place car (score
of 3 for the rally) and the first place car (score of 1).  And the
team (average score of best 5 cars on each team) took second place
with an average of 4 hundereths of a minute (first place was 3.6, very
close).

All in all, this is by far the best way to get to Las Vegas.  If
anyone is interested in joining us for next year (the 25th running of
Starlite) please let me know.  Even if you're in other parts of the
country, we have several people fly in from other parts of the
country, rent cars, and run with us.

Thanks to George at 944 Ecology for the help with the switches and
plugs for the extra lights I added.  I used a factory switch in the
center console of my '86 944 wired from the high beams to trigger a
large relay under the hood that supplied the power to the pair of 9"
130 watt off road racing lights that I mounted on the front bumper
(without drilling extra holes either!).  Good lights really made a
difference out in the middle of nowhere - the help you see the ice and
sand on the road before it's too late.

Subject: Ignition Key Replacement Procedure
- -----------
Pfellow Pfilers:

	After some months of procrastination and aggressive
laziness, I have finally replaced the ignition switch in
my '84 911 Carrera.  The following is how I done it.

Tools Needed:
- -------------
27 mm socket and extension for steering wheel nut
Easy Out (size isn't marked, needs 5/64" drill bit)
5/64" drill bit and drill
13 mm open end wrench
needle nose pliers
flat head screwdriver
13 mm crowfoot and extension

Parts Needed:
- -------------
ignition switch assembly, contains both mechanical
and electrical portions of the switch.  I bought mine
from Performance Products for $328.75.  Note that there
is an extra connection this switch that isn't used.  I
solved this by ignoring it completely.  People that live
in a high humidity environment may want to plug it.

Procedure:
- ----------
1)	Disconnect the battery ground, and cover with a plastic
bag.  I had to use the 13mm crowfoot to back the nuts off
(for the first time ever).
2)	Remove the switch cover plate.  I was able to screw mine
off by hand.
3)	Remove the horn bezel by gently pulling at a corner.  I
have the sport steering wheel, and started at the bottom.
4)	Using the 27mm socket, remove the steering wheel retaining
nut, followed by the steering wheel itself.  Watch out for
the horn power wire.  Be sure and mark the alignment of the
steering wheel and the shaft before removing the wheel.
5)	Unscrew the 6 screws holding the steering column switch
covers.  Four are visible as you sit in the drivers seat, and
there is one on each side of the covers.
6)	Unscrew and remove the wiring for the horn contact ring,
and remove both cover halves.
7)	Unscrew the 2 screws holding the headlight dimmer switch
to the bracket, remove the switch from the bracket, and tie
to the steering post.
8)	Drill starter holes in both breakaway bolts and back them
out using the easy out.
9)	Remove both connectors from the ignition switch.  Both
will pull out without any tools.  The big connector is a pain,
as there isn't a lot of room.
10)	Now look in the hole in the dashboard just to the left of
and underneath the steering column.  You will see a stud with
a nut attached screwed into a bracket welded to the side of 
the steering column.  Using the 13mm wrench, loosen the nut
and unscrew it until you can get the jaws of the needle nose
pliers on the stud itself.  Now gently rotate the stud until
you can remove the switch.  NOTE:  In the course of figuring
the above trick out, I ended up drilling out the rivets holding
the plate to which the switch is bolted, and removing the plate.
I therefore don't know exactly how the switch will move when
it is ready to slide.  I slid it to the left, away from the
steering column.  If you don't drill the plate out, it will
have to move towards the front of the car, somehow.
11)	Installation is the reverse.  I put the switch in place,
loosely installed the bolts and screwed in the stud, attached
the connectors, and then tightened everything up.  I don't
know what sort of socket is used to fully tighten the breakaway
bolts, as I haven't done that yet.  I used 5-40 cap head screws,
1/8" long, to secure the switch plate to the dashboard.  1/8"
pop rivets would work, but my rivet gun head wouldn't fit in
the space available.

The bad news in all of this is that you now have a new ignition
key that doesn't match the door keys.  Oh well.

The good news is that it will start reliably.  I removed the
electrical portion from the old switch, and still had trouble
rotating the switch into start all the time.

I have seen postings about factory workshop manuals on microfiche and have
some questions.

a.) For a 1986 911, do you need the 65-71 and 72-83 manuals? It would seem
    that a 1986 911 would almost be totally different from an early 911 in
    relation to details on internal parts.

b.) Can the parts diagrams and numbers be obtained on microfiche? I ask my
    local dealer parts counter about it and they said that it was illegal
    (PCNA law) to sell them to the public. If available, a source would be
    appriciated.

Thanks to all and Merry Christmas.

I just bought the parts fiche from Stoddards (1-800-342-1414).  I got
the 72-83 and 84-89 sets for $24 each.  So far I have not had to look
at the 72-83  set.  I am tempted to say it is not worth getting the
72-83 set.  I am fairly certain it is not worth getting the earlier set
(even though I have never seen it).

My recommendation is that unless you get a big discount for buying the
lot, just buy the 84-89 and see if it covers everything you need.
You can always buy the 72-83 later.

PS when you copy the fiche, the diagrams do not copy too well.
Basically I tend to read up on the section I need and then copy those

     - 102k miles
     - engine re-built @ 60k
     - slight leaks from engine
     - body is in good condition (no dents/rust)

I'd say it depends a lot on what was done during the rebuild.  The 2.7
liter engine in that car is known for having studs pull out of the
case over time.  If that happens, you are looking at a very expensive
repair.  When the engine was rebuilt, this problem could have been
corrected.  In car ads the phrase "rebuilt" can cover everything from
a major overhaul to adjusting the valve timing, so get details.

Find out if the engine was rebuilt with Dilivar studs (whose thermal
expansion characteristics match the magnesium case, and therefore
don't undergo as much stress) and if the case was "time-serted", a
process in which the stud mounting holes are reinforced.

If these upgrades were not done, I think that you should avoid the
car, unless the prospect of a complete and expensive bottom-end
rebuild at some point in the future doesn't bother you.  I got burned,
and wish the experience on no one.

You should also find out why the engine was rebuilt, if possible.

If the engine was strengthened as described above, then you are
probably on the right track.  Another improvement to look for is the
upgrade to oil-pressure-fed Carerra-style timing chain tensioners.
These are more reliable than the original equipment on that car.

In any case, you MUST have the car evaluated by a competent
professional Porsche mechanic.  I emphasize competent, because I had
the car checked by a mechanic when I bought my '76 911S and not only
didn't they find any of the car's problems, they didn't even warn me
about the known weaknesses of the '75-77 model year engine.  

People on this list can give you a reference for a good San Jose-area
shop.  Good luck.

Subject: Re: 911 flaky wipers


Its probably *not* the wiper stalk control, but the wiper relay.  The relay is 
responsible for completing a circuit that allows the wipers to park in their 
proper place.  This relay (at least on the SC, but can't imagine the early 
Carrera is much different) is a tough to get to.  The easy way, which may or may
not work is to remove the clock and put your hand inside towards the center of 
the dash and down.  The relay is mounted on the chassis of the car.  This 
technique did'nt work for me because my hands are'nt octopus legs.  The other 
way is to remove the fresh air system from the trunk.  The relay is behind the 
fresh air system.  This will take a while to take out and put back but should 
guarantee success.

  The windshield wipers on my '84 911 Carrera have started acting flaky the

  The intermittent wipers would work for a while and then stop completely, 
  they now no longer work at all.  When using the control on the steering 
  stalk the wipers will not always come back to their home position when
  I turn the switch off.  With a little juggling they eventually return to 
  their home position.

  Any ideas where to start looking for problems or potential solutions?

Subject: Porsche Stuff... What else?

Haven't consumed any bandwidth in the last couple of weeks, so here we go 
again...

Took the 928 on a jaunt to Topeka from Dallas and back. In so doing, I 
had the opportunity to see in a microcosm the effects of oxygenated fuel.
Going up I ran my usual Mobil Super. Got 17mpg and the engine ran 1/2 to 
2/3 hot with an outside temp of <>25 degrees. Coming back I ran some 
Standard Super, I assume non-oxy (Kansas, no pump markings), got 22mpg 
and engine ran less than 1/3 hot with outside temp of <>32 degrees. In 
fact, it took almost an hour and a half to get out of the bottom white 
bar. Car was also smoother, quieter and more prone to launch on the way 
back. Speeds were mostly 75-90mph both ways.

Either I got a bad tank in Big D and a great tank in Kansas, or oxy fuel 
and my 928 just don't get along. Given engine temps and conditions, 
though, I'm looking to blame the fuel... YMMV, obviously...


OK, so all you porschephiles have cats. So do I. My cats want to ruin, 
and have pretty much succeeded at, ruining my paint job. No garage, just 
a carport, and the kitties don't like the house. I've got scratches *ALL* 
*OVER* my poor car. They didn't do this to my truck, my shelby, or my 
wife's honda. While I admire their taste, it is certainly having an 
impact on our owner/feline relationship. After scratch #1 I immediately 
put a cover on the car, one the gent at the store said would be adequate. 
Guess again. I think this poly/cotton thing just made it easier for them 
to *climb* up the sides and made them think it was a new bed. I've doused 
the cover with Cat-away type sprays and seen them immediately on top of 
it, unphased. Car is now being parked out in the elements <dammit> to 
keep it away from these beasts. What can I do? (Already started the 
search for a domicile equipped with a garage).

And in that vein, what are the odds that a good paint/body shop can do a 
decent amount of touch-up? Some of the scratches buffed out, but many did 
not. Am I looking at a new paint job? And what does a *good* paint job 
cost? I'm sure the cats will gladly get a paper route to pay for it. :-<


One last comment: the 928 was heaven on the open road. Quiet, could hear 
the radio and talk, glided over the highway and ate up the road. It looks 
like I'll be making that trip many times in the next year, and when I can 
it'll be in the 928. No complaints at all! (except maybe the mpg).

Appreciate your time to listen to my ramblings, and as always, I've 
enjoyed reading everyone else's. See you in my rear-view... :-)

I had the same experience with a similar hand vacuum pump from a lab 
equipment maker. Actually, I ended up bleeding the system myself by 
simply attaching a clear hose to the bleeder screw and submerging the 
other end in a bottle of brake fluid.
 
What I observed was that on the pump stroke, more fluid (90% more?) would 
squirt out than would get sucked back in (10%?) on release of the pedal. 
Therefore, all I had to do was to slowly keep pumping and releasing. I 
knew that no air was being sucked back in, otherwise I would have seen 
air bubbles on the pump stroke. This seemed to work fine with no hassle 
so I cannot see why one should bother with these pumps at all. I've seen 
another method where the end of the tube has a ball-bearing to prevent 
the fluid from being sucked back in, but why bother if it's only 10% and 
you're only sucking in the fluid which was just in the brake a few 
seconds ago?
 
I've heard that one should be very careful not to hyper-extend on the 
pump stroke as this causes the rubber seals in the master cylinder to 
traverse a section of the tube which has not previously been 'polished' 
by regular use. This in turn causes premature wearing of the seals.

I have a 993 with ABD and limited slip. Being and avid autocrosser, I tried
to order the car with limited slip and the the ABD deleted but the factory
would not go for it. After further consideration I decided that the ABD was
not such a bad idea. ABD brakes only one wheel at a time and works below
about 44 m.p.h. This behavior, in conjunction with the differential causes
the torque to be redistributed to the wheel with less slip. Yes, I know
that the limited slip causes a certain amount of linkage between the wheels
but the limited slip is only 25% going forward. I think that ABD can be

Road and Track (I think) is the only publication so far that has admitted
that the new C4 does exhibit more push (understeer) than the 2wd version
although the C4 is said to be much better than the old C4 in this respect.
As an autocrosser pushing the car's limits in relatively slow (2nd and 3rd
gear) situations, I am particularly sensitive to this (as well as the
amount of weight that 4wd adds) and feel that even the 2wd version needs
wider front tires. Even the factory uses less of a spread on the race
version (admittedly the suspension has significantly different settings as
well) between front and rear wheels and tires, just as they did with the
previous model C2.

Subject: Teflon additives in Porsches


Hi Gang,

I stumbled across some info relating to the use of the old
formula of Slick 50 which contains Teflon and how you
shouldn't use it with silicon alloys.  A while back Stan said
something about Slick 50 "leeching" the silicon out of the
engine case so I investigated this:

Teflon contains flourine, and this reacts with silicon.
One example:  Hydroflouric acid will actually eat through
glass - and glass is mostly silicon!

So keep all teflon products away from your Porsche.  Many
of you have alusil or nikasil cylinders and teflon in the oil
could react with these.  I don't know how much silicon is
present in your engine and tranny cases, but if so, that's
another reason not to use teflon products.

Slick 50 and Duralube now use something else and I don't
know if this new stuff contains flourine or not.  If I find out I'll
let you know.

Just keeping you "scientifically" informed....

Subject: autocross!!!!!

Well, I had a blast last Saturday; the San Diego Region Autocross at Jack
Murphy Stadium!!  And I have a new respect for the 78-83 911SC's that ran in
my class!  Our own Bob Albrecht may have become the champion in I-stock but
I'm not sure how the points tallied out.  
	The day started out (for me) very cautious as I was trying to push
my car ('79 928) without causing the dreaded anti-FBI smoke screen to magiacally
appear in my rear view.  As I got up to speed, it smoked a little and I pulled
off to check it out.  Hmmm.  The oil is definately from a leak onto the header.
Hmmm.  No oil in the air box so that part of the operation (angioplast) was a 
success, but where was the oil coming from?  The oil pan.  Turns out the oil
pan bolts were all loose and I was able to reach 13 of the bolts and tighten
them up.  i swabbed away the oil and went back out to practice a little more.
I was pushing the car HARD and my little heart was really pumping!!  Since
these were not timed runs, I had no idea how i was stacking up to the other 
drivers but I mentioned to Bob and Pete (Albrecht, 356sc) that I felt I may
be able to give Bob a run for his money.  I was excited!!  The car was really 
screaming on the straights but pushing like a pig in the corners, but I still
felt good.  
Bob's run group goes off and he's rattling off times in the low -83 second
range.  I'm watching him and thinking, "Well, I hope I can break 90", and then
he's finished.  Pete's group goes out and he rattles off some 90's and 89's.
I'm feeling confident; a 928 should easily beat a 356-ancient car from LA!!!!
I mean, it's not even silver like Ferry would have wanted!!  It's white!!
And then it's my turn.  The first run is smooth and fast and it's a
90-something.  I was lauging so hard in my helmet 'cause I had tried REAL hard
to be smooth, but the pig was pushin' big time.  My next run is a little better
at 89 ish, but still I'm thinking, "How am I going to catch Bob?"  My last run 
was enough to beat Pete (barely) but not Bob.  Rats.  I think I even hit a cone
too, something I've never done.  They're loud when you hit them going 65 mph!
So I've decided to buy some tires other than 205's that are on the front; maybe
I can catch him then.  And then the real kicker; the January drivers school will
be free to 356 drivers and the March school will be free to 928 drivers!!  
I wonder if they made their decision after seeing Pete and I get beat by Bob!!

later,
bill

p.s. It's amazing how much you can push a car when you have confidence in the
repairs that you made to it.  Understanding how a car works will almost always
make you a better driver.

p.s.  The girl beat me this time

FWIW, I put 100W H3's in my 914 without any relays etc. and the results
have been good. For real lighting improvements though, install H4's for
your main headlights. I use 100/80W with good results. The car is low
enough that the brightness doesn't bother anybody as long as the lights
are aimed properly. I was driving behind an MGA once and they weren't even

It seems pretty clear that the cats particularly like the broad, smooth,
WARM hood of the 928. A couple of possible approaches:

1. Never drive the 928. The hood will therefore be cold and uninviting,
but the mice which will eventually take up residence in the car will
attract the cats back, so that's not so good.

2. Aim a fan - possibly a nice oscillating one - at the general area
of the hood. The annoying draft might just convince the cats that you
wife's Honda is a nicer place to sit. Unfortunately my wife's car is
a Vanagon camper, so the most appealing place to sit is out of reach
of all but the most determined and athletic cats.

3. Connect the 928 to a van de Graff generator - the cat probably won't
like it when his hair stands on end and emits blue sparks...

Actually the second suggestion might work - has anybody tried it?

If you want to slap on 18" wheels, you're going to have to roll out the

Actually, I should have phrased the question better: I meant can the fog 
lamp housing handle a different bulb - size - that would provide better 
lighting.  I realize they are different animals, however, I thought that 
there might be some interchangability between an H3 and an H4 bulb.

     I know several people have answered a few ways, but on my 911 with this
    exact same problem the wiper switch itself was bad. There is a connection
    that must get made even while off (or using the intermittents) that
    goes bad at the stalk. That you can jiggle the stalk and have it return
    pretty much proves this.              
     You have to remove the steering wheel to get the plastic shroud off 
    around the switch, as there are 4 hidden screws that hold it on (in 
    addition to the 2 on the sides). Pop off the horn pad (just pull it off)
    then use something like a 22-24mm socket to get the steering wheel nut
    off (removal and installation of the steering wheel on a Porsche is
    pretty easy). Fishing the new wiring thru takes a little patience, but
    will fix your problem (and is worth the aggravation of trying to hit
    the switch to get them back "home)".

Subject: Some 914 Euro-Spec Conversion Questions [long]


PORSCHEPHILES:

As I hope to bring my 1975 2.0 914 (or another one if I am able to make a 
purchase) to Finland between now and next summer, there are a few things
that I will have to update or add back to the car, that were not OE on it 
when it was sent to North America.  After checking a few of the regs here 
and using my Authenticity Guide to see what was once an option for 
European model Volkswagen/Porsche 914s, I have some questions that maybe 
someone has the answers too.

1. Front Turn Signals: is it possible to even find the dual-bulb signal 
unit with the amber/clear lense in the U.S.?  And as the turn signal lights 
act as the running lights simultaneously, is there going to be some sort 
of electrical wiring upgrade needed to handle the dual bulb set up, i.e., 
one connection for the running lights and another for turn signals?

2. An OE headlight washer system was an option for 1974 and later Euro 914s 
headed to Sweden (and Finland, though very few did) and this is something 
that I will have to install.  I think I remember seeing an ad for this in a
VW&Porsche about four years back from a firm selling Porsche products out of 
Nevada.  Ring any bells?  As I recall, the price then was around $150.00.  
Has anyone installed these on their 914 (for the heck of it or because it was 
an interesting option)?  Furthermore, would this system use the same 
washer fluid resevoir as the windshield washer?

Would this modification require upgrading to the 911 electrical pump 
system for windshield washing?  The authenticity guide did not specify 
anything about this.

3. Another OE Euro-Spec option for all 914s was a rear mounted, red fog 
lamp, borrowed from the 911 and attached with its own, 914 only, mounting 
bracket.  Where would I find such a lamp and bracket?

4. Will a European model 250 km/h speedo fit directly to a U.S. model 
without changing the cable or other equipment?  The only difference in 
the gauge seems to be the location of the high beam indicator.

If anyone has any comments or info, I would appreciate hearing about it!  
Be in touch.

Thanks,

Patrick

There is a product on the market called a "scat mat" that has a variable
strength electric grid running through it. When the cat completes the
circuit with its' paws he gets a very mild, but annoying, pulsing shock.

Before someone cries cruelty, I tried this product on myself at all three
voltage levels and found it irritating, but not painful. It just makes the
surface less appealing to lay on.

Check "Cat Fancy" or another cat magazine to find out who sells them.
Seems like they are ~$50.

Teflon and hydrofluoric acid [HF] are two entirely different things. 
HF is an extremely nasty, reactive, poisonous substance; teflon
[(C2F4)n] is an extremely unreactive, inert, non-toxic substance--one
of the least reactive polymers available (it's used in medical
implants, etc.).  Laboratory glassware is often made of teflon and
glass in intimate contact, and let me assure you that the teflon does
not eat the glass--nor will it eat metal.

However, when burned, teflon can give off HF.  So if you have some
teflon in your oil, and the oil is getting burned, it could
theoretically do some dammage.  In any case, DuPont has stated (from 
what I hear) that teflon in oil is pointless, so you don't need to be 
putting the stuff in your engine unless you want to make someone else 
richer.

> So keep all teflon products away from your Porsche.
This is certainly not necessary or even wise.  Teflon is a very 
versatile polymer, and there's probably a few grams of it scattered 
about the car as gaskets and low-friction parts.

One thing to consider with these kinds of device and any other device that
scares the cat, is that when kitty is on top of your car and receives
a scare, he/she extends his/her claws.  This is a bad thing :-).  You get
extra scratches (and extra deep ones at that).  Most of what I have
read indicates not to scare kitty off of your car !

ObStory:  How my parents got a cat.

My brother works on a farm.  It is a good place for cats to breed.  One day he
went out to drive to the farm and his car wouldn't start.  He checked under the
hood and finds a kitty sitting on the air box.  Apparently the day before, the
cat had got into the engine and finding it a warm place to sit, had decided
to sit there.  Not realising this my brother had driven home with the
stow-away in tow.  My brother took the cat back, but the farm owner said
if he wanted it he could keep it.  So.... my parents got a cat.

I wonder how many of her nine lives she used up ?

PS my parents didn't call the cat Lucky :-)

So this is probably what lead to the "silicon-munching teflon"

Subject: Alternator noises

Well, on this morning's lovely commute, I noticed some unusual
underhood noises.  Further study revealed the alternator was making a
sound somewhere between a rattle and a grind. :-[

Does this likely portend imminent alternator doom??  Are the shaft
bearings even replaceable?

   Hi again,

    In about a week I will be home and working on my beloved beater, a
'71 914/4.  Here's the question - I would like to keep it running well
as long as possible, so I was planning on cleaning as much of the motor
as I could get at without removing it and then using synthetic oil
(sorry, I'm still a little nervous about this air-cooled thing...)  What
is the recommended oil to use?  Mobil 1?  Syntec?  Any dino oil with
outstanding properties???

TIA,

All,

I believe this question of how to prevent cats from scratching 
your car was posted quite some time ago.  As I recall, some of
the solutions presented were:

    1) Moth balls
    2) Orange peels
    3) Car cover
    4) Electrical device that repels via ultrasonic waves   

I was going to purchase the device that emitted ultrasonic waves
but my neighbor who owned the cat had moved. so I never had to

Subject: What to buy, what to buy

I have been looking in papers sort of on and off for the past few months.
Mostly just watching prices and options available on 911's.  I knew that the
current situation was going to happen soon:  Paid the last payment on my
wife's Suburban, meaning we can possibly afford another car payment.  

So, the task for presentation to the collective wisdom contained here is thus:

I think that I want a pre 1990 Carrera, no turbo, no targa, 17" wheels if
possible.  My goal is to have a 911 I can take to track events, share daily
driver duties on my 30 mile backroads commute, and basically have fun
updating or tweaking without running into the moral dilemas and rarity
problems I face with my 1966 911S.  I'll take performance (sport seats, 17"
rims, tweaked suspension) over creature comforts (CD player, AC, supple leather 
seats) anyday.

By my research it looks like 1987's can be found for close to $25K, 1988's for
about $28K, and 1989's for about $30K.  Turbo-look seems to add about
$2K-$5K.  I have seen a couple of 1989 Carrera 4's for ~$35K-$38K, but that
is out of my price range.

I also know that 1983 911SC's can be found for under $20K.  I've seen ads for
cars as low as $16.9K, but the car was sold immediatly.

Here are the questions:

Should I hold out for that 1987 Carrera? 

What options would be most desirable for a trackable car?  least desirable?

Am I wrong to not look at Targa's due to possible body flex?

Should I give more serious consideration to saving money on the purchase
price and look for an '83 911SC, and then make updates to it?

I've found a '93 RS America with 3217 miles on it, seller is asking $39,750,
I think I could get it for $36K, this would strain the budget a bit, would it
be worth it?

Bottom line:  $27K cash available to buy a later model 911, what should I be
looking for model wise?  I know enough about buying cars to have it inspected
etc...I'm looking for the Conventional Net Wisdom on configuration here.

Subject:       Door Seals, stripped bolts

I am plagued by wind noise in my '75 911 coupe.

On the passenger side, the noise comes in thru the door seal at
about the level of the dash at the front.  I think a new door seal
would cure this, but I'm not sure.  If I do get a seal, what's 
involved in installing it?

Also, in the Automotion catalog I see that one can acquire a "velvet
upper door seal, on door."  From the picture it looks like this goes
on the top of the window frame and down the front.  I don't have any
seal in this spot on my car at present--should I pick up a couple of
these, or is it overkill?

The driver's side noise is due to a bad window felt.  I bought a new
felt a few months back, but after dissecting the door (you have to
remove the window frame to do the switch, I found that two of the
allen bolts that hold the window frame in are frozen.  Worse, I
discovered this by stripping them (I hate allen bolts sometimes). 
The one on the outside of the car will be merely miserable to fix
(I've got a set of screw extractors...), but I don't know what the
hell to do about the one inside the door.  This bolt is in the door,
below the window crank handle and a bit to the rear.  You can get at
it from either side with an allen wrench, though it's an awkward
reach if you want to put any torque on it (that's how I stripped the
damn thing).  I can't see any way to get a drill in there.  The
bracket it screws into can be unscrewed from the door, but I still
can get the whole assembly out of the door.  Any good ideas out
there?

Thanks

Hi Porschephiles

A couple of weeks ago Volney Spalding posted a question on whether or not an
automatic antenna would fit in a '71 911.  I saved the post for some reason.
 Unfortunately, a few weeks later somebody broke my antenna in half while I
was at the beach ... oops, sorry I forgot that it was winter for some people.
Now that I needed an antenna I tried E-mailing him, but it bounced so I got
no response. I called imparts and they said that both the Hirschmann and the
clone would fit my car. I then drove to Vertex and was about to buy a
Hirschamnn antenna when I took the antenna out of the box and noticed it
looked way to big to fit. Since I can't get in touch with Volney can somebody
tell me if an automatic antenna will fit in my 911, what model I need, and if
it is really difficult to take the door off my car to get the antenna in.

   I have heard this is a common problem.  It certainly was with my car.  I
   have also heard about many remedies.  This is what I had done:

   Replaced front calipers with 911 "M" type.
   Replaced stock proportioning valve with "T"
   Installed steel brake lines
   Replaced pads with "Cool Carbon"

   This is a huge improvement but still not ideal.  For one thing the  "Cool
   Carbon" pads are incredibly noisy.

   I'm interested in other approaches.  What about an adjustable prop valve?
   What's kind of pads are people using?

Subject: Re: Teflon additives in Porsches


Dirk,

It's always nice to see people with college educations and e-mail
accounts making pronouncements about the worth of something,
while having absoutely no factual information to back up those claims.

On a slightly more useful front, I can tell you that a friend, professional
chemist, and local PCA'er did in fact perform some tests a few years
ago.  At the time, I passed along his detailed results to the list.  The
bottom line was that when a mixture of aluminum/silicon alloy, motor
oil, and Slick 50 was heated, the aluminum bits lost significant mass.

This suggested to him that the PTFE was decomposing to HF acid,
and that the acid was attacking the alloy.  I emphasize "suggested,"
as did he, since we don't know for sure.

Equating the use of teflon or other materials in gaskets with its used
dispersed in an oil additive is just wrong.

Nate,

I'm not a synthetic convert yet.  I'm told in order to take full advantage 
of synthetics the engine need to be designed for it (smaller bearing 
clearances) because of the different shear properties.

I dumped (bad pun) Castrol after using it for many years and now use Kendall 
products.  There is an excellent white paper done by Chevron engineers that 
really explains lubricants and dispells a few myths.  If you (or anyone 
else) is interested, I'll dig out the address of the research/marketing

Hi Miq,

My philsophy about combination daily drivers/track cars:

I'm retiring my RS America from track events and am building up
my '82 SC for this purpose because I can't stomach the thought of
eating the cost of the car after an acquaintence wadded his up
on the pit wall at Willow Springs.  An SC makes a great combination
track car/daily driver due to its relyability/durability and the 

fact that if you do shunt the car at the track you can always
buy another one for $10-12K and use the damaged one as for parts
Granted, your chances of getting t-boned by a Range Rover
on the highway are probably greater than damaging the car on the
track, but I am now more of a believer that if you decide to take
the car out on the track, you have to be prepared for it to be
disposable.  


Re: RS America with 3200 miles for $36K?
Wow!  This is about $10K less than I've ever seen one advertised for. With
that kind of mileage, I'd say that either: the car is a salvage repair (it
wouldn't happen to be guards red and owned by a guy in Santa Barbara
would it?), somebody that's extremely desperate, or they're just plain 

stupid.  For that price, you could easily sell the parts for more than
the car cost (assuming the body panels weren't filled with Bondo).  


Good Luck,

Drew

replaced my Hirshman on my '82 911SC Targa. It's difficult but you dont 
need to take the door off, just work inside the wheel well. Also I replced
mine with one from Performance Products (1-800-423-3173) with their "low

 Unfortunately, a few weeks later somebody broke my antenna in half while I
was at the beach ... oops, sorry I forgot that it was winter for some people.
Now that I needed an antenna I tried E-mailing him, but it bounced so I got

Yoko A-509s or AVS Intermediates. You can get the AVS in 195/65, which also
works well on a stock wheel and gives almost the same rolling radius
as the stock 165  tire.

That's harder. The 914 brakes are not stellar, but should be grabbing
enough to lock you down. Try changing to Cool Carbon RED compound (for
street/autox only, ORANGE if it's a track car). Also try using brake cleaner
to de-grease the rotors before you swap pads. Have a look at the front
bearing seals, and the calipers too -- if you have oilish goop leaking
onto the braking surface, well, it's NOT good...

Subject: MIG welders

P-philers,

Recently some members were inquiring about MIG welders.
Since I am in the market I have been looking at low cost Lincoln and Century.
I do like HTP but they are really in the higher price range. Today I received
a flyer from Daytona MIG, representing Cebora, an italian made welder sold
renamed by Matco and Snap-On. (1-800-331-9353). They have some pretty good
prices:

Pocket MIG 110A/115V................................$329 (24 Gauge to 1/4"
steel, 1/8" aluminum)
Pocket Turbo 130A/115V..............................$445 (24            
 5/16"          3/16"            )
Revolution Combi (MIG+gasless)130A/115V...$484.(24              5/16"       
  3/16"            )
MIG 140 140A/115V.....................................$584 (24
             3/8"            1/4"              )

They currently have a special if you buy a welder and plasma cutter (Pocket
Plasma 30A/115V - 25A output - cuts steel up to 3/16"). The package includes
a full 40CF gas cylinder, single gauge regulator, welding helmet, a welding
cart to fit both units, and leather welding gloves. Prices are as follows:

With Pocket MIG..........................................$884
        Pocket Turbo....................................... $974
        Combi..................................................$1055
        MIG 140...............................................$1124

Does anyone have any experience with this equipment ?(or under the
Matco-Snap-On brand)
Is it really helpful to have gasless capability ? (If gasless is so good, why
do MIGs still exist ?)
For automotive restoration work (primarily sheet metal) and some "around the
house" work is 130A a good compromise ?
Are these indeed good prices ?

Any comments are welcome, especially from seasoned restores and welding master
s among you !

This tire works fine on 6" wheels, I have even had some luck with 225/50/15
on my 6" rims due to stupid PCA diameter rules. 

The 205/50/15 has also been used by most of the fastest 914 2.0 drivers in

I'm not up on the level of detail necessary to identify 356 variants on

Hi, fellow Porschephiles;
    Has anyone ever experienced hot-start problems in their 911's.  I have an
'82 911 Targa which is suffering from serious (and embarassing) hot-start
problems.  When I turn off the motor it sometimes will not restart if I let
it sit for more than a few minutes.  The motor turns over fine but the engine
does not show any sign of even trying to run.  If I let the car cool down for
an hour or so, it will start and run perfectly.  The fuel pump seems okay
since I can here it running.  As always, thanks for any input.

Subject: Mice in the Plenum (No Cats!)

I don't know what the "cat" thing is, but does anyone have a good "short
term" solution to removing the odor of mice infestation in heater/AC ducts?

Several years ago, we were amused when a friend's new BMW 525 was constantly
invaded by mice in the garage during winter, but his wife's Acura sitting
next to it never had a problem. (Taste for German vintage material?)  Dealer
removed the entire heater/AC unit, ductwork, and dash twice under warranty.

Two months ago, it became less funny to me!  I had left the 533i in the
storage building we rent when we took our motorhome on a trip for a couple of
weeks.  Still early fall in the Midwest with day temps in the 60s.  Upon
return and a nice 60 degree day, I opened the dash vents and was covered with
insulation bits, debris, and you know what!  Later on, could actually see one
of the critters in the duct and ultimately was able to lure 4 to their timely
demise.  (At least one looked very reproductive!).   After cleaning out to
extent possible without total dash, heater, AC disassembly, I used the
commercial deodorizer spray liberally.

My wife reminds me the smell is still there at the touch of the heater by
rolling down all the windows and opening the sunroof in 15 degree weather (I
know the solution for her!)

A friend in the restoration business had a more serious problem.  Seems a
customer decided to end it with a Magnum to the head in his new Buick.  Wife
wanted to keep the car "for sentimental" reasons!  Even after removing and
replacing seats, headliner, insulation, etc the odor remained.  Finally, a
friendly mortician used some embalming fluid magic which they guaranteed
would "kill anything" (no pun).  Anyone know what this substance is ?

I just know that someone on this forum is planning to be buried in their
Porsche!  Perhaps a wife, ex-wife, girlfriend, etc has thought this through
for ultimate reuse of the car and is storing the elixir for the appropriate
time.      Any suggestions .......

Subject: Re: Buying a 356SC and Reliability (Long)

Great check-list; however, another option I didn't notice on it is the
aluminum door trim strip.  My 1965 356SC Karmann coupe was delivered with
this option, and it is one I've seen on relatively few coupes.  This
particular strip, by the way, was used by Chuck Stoddard as a pattern for his
later replacement part (he literally jumped onto the trailer as I arrived at
his shop to measure it and inspect the mating angles at the door openings!)
 This car may also be the best and most reliable automobile Porsche ever
built, even considering its reputed weak crankshaft.  For the first three
years I owned it, it served as sole family transportation, sitting outside in
the weather, hauling babies to the grocery store during the week, and
blasting up North Carolina mountain-climbs on weekends.  With the local
terrain and its four-speed transmission, it saw the red-line regularly but
never complained.  A ring finally cracked at 98,000 miles and 13 years, so I
trailered it to Stoddard and had him do a complete mechanical rebuild
(engine, transmission, suspension, and brakes), replace rubber, and rub out
the paint.  (Yeah, it was expensive, but this car was, by now, part of the
family!)  For the past 16 years it's been my fair-weather, three-season pride
and joy, looking as new in its original Signal Red paint (from 25 feet away,
at least) as ever and joyfully carrying an old guy back 30 years every time
he cranks it up.  One of the keys to this kind of reliability is sensitivity
to the equipment: I'm an engineer and I pay very close attention to tuning,
maintenance, and driving stresses.  Nothing mechanical is break-proof, but
the 1965 356SC is surely an outstanding example of design evolution at its
peak.  Merry Christmas to all.

Hi, Fred.
 
The hitter was one Donald Turnupseed, who is still alive but very unhappy
(you would be too with a name and reputation like that -- and living, if you
can call it that, in Tulare or someplace).
 
Turnupseed did an illegal left turn onto another road directly in front of
Dean, who had the right of way.
 
Dean's co-driver, Rolf Wuetherich, was a Porsche employee who after that had
a reputation of being slightly batty. He was thrown out of the car. He went
back to work for the factory in Germany after his tour of duty at the
American west coast importer was up, navigated the 904 that came in second
in the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, left the factory in 1979 to work for a Honda
dealer about 60 miles from Stuttgart. He was killed driving a Honda in 1981.
 
Dean was driving a Type 550 Spyder.

There MIGHT not be one.  Several years ago a friend of mine and I got paid
$75 each to go and drive different cars, including Porsches, then fill out a
200+ question survey for each car driven.  Everything from "Is the angle of
the front windshield appealing?  How would you change it?" to " Would you buy
this car?"  It was very complete, covering interior, exterior, performance,
looks, comfort, etc....  The "survey" took about 4 hours, which works out to
less than $20/hour.  A lot of people consider their time more valuble than
this...
My guess is that your name and phone # was sold to the  research company. 
The money being put out is relatively small compared to the information
obtained that could sell more cars.   Consider yourself lucky, you are a
CHOSEN one.  Go forth and have FUN!!!

Chris,

	I think that if you were really stuck with one wheel and the car 
is in deep, there are times when the limited slip wouldn't quite get you 
out, since it is not locked. The ABD basically locks both sides. I may 
be wrong about this, maybe others can add to it.

Why is everyone so crazy about big diameter wheels??? The tires are
way too expensive. 15" wheels will be faster on the track, more comfortable
on the road, and WAY CHEAPER (tires and wheels)! Don't be "romanced" into
big wheels by Madison Avenue. Also good 17" track tires for a 911 are not
readily available in the narrow front width.

These prices seem very high, at least $5K too high each. Even in Connecticut
where everything is too expensive, they are available for $5K less than your
prices. In other parts of the country they should be much less than this.

> Should I hold out for that 1987 Carrera? 

Sounds good for track. Best power, trans, suspension of any original 911.
No advantage to an '88 or '89.

> What options would be most desirable for a trackable car?  least desirable?

The '87-up turbo look is great if you can find one reasonably, but they are
very rare. Cloth Sport seats as you mentioned would be great.
You might want a LSD, but not imperative. Don't really need any options,
the '87 came standard with all the good stuff. Put on some good shocks and
tires and lower the car and you are all set. Wide wheels are what you need,
7's and 8's work well (15" or 16"). They all had AC so you're stuck with it.

> Am I wrong to not look at Targa's due to possible body flex?

A Targa is fine with stock suspension, body flex is not bad at all. (Many
people will disagree with me, but I can beat them all in my antique "flexi"
'72 S Targa). Would be less safe than a coupe in an accident, though (unless
a full roll cage is added - not great for a street car).

tradeoffs... depends on your ca$h situation. Go for the '87 if you can find
a nice one and afford it.

The other day on a cold New England morning while warming up  my 1980 924 the
oil pressure warning light came on, and stayed on.  Naturally, I shut off the
engine immediately and drove the truck to work instead.  The engine was not
overly hot and the oil level was full.  Any speculation on weather or not
this is a bad pump or bad sender or otherwise?  Does anyone know of a
procedure for testing the oil pressure sender?  I know the procedure for
checking the pump, but I do not want this to be a bad pump, I really want it
to be a bad sensor (cheaper, easier, It's cold here in CT).  Don't worry, it
will stay parked until fixed.

I think the 205/ "55" -14 would work fine if it fits the fenders. I don't reme

Might want to be careful from what I have heard Porsche has put 
something in the computer that when a chip it used it turns on a rev 
limited in the computer and also voids your warranty. A friend of my son 
works at dealer and gave us this infor. Do not know which year this

Hi,

I don't know why I was watching it, but ESPN "auto racing - Thrills and

of 993 bumping, crashing, and at least one rollover.
Of course lots of good F1 and Indycar stuff too.

There was also a scene that looked like early 911s bumping in a slow

Well, I do know that your warranty will void if you install a chip (I don't
think that would be a consideration on an '86 though). But hey, the chip
will not **induce** a rev. limiting situation. It is that very chip (ie. -
the one you just replaced with the aftermarket chip) that determines the
rev limit in a car with Motronic fuel management. Most of the time, an
aftermarket chip will **increase** the rev limit beyond what it was with
the factory chip.

just my .02 worth !!!

Didn't all U.S. bound 2.0 914s after model year 1974 come with the center 
console and gauges?  This has created a little confusion on my part.  

There were optional Fuchs wheels after 1973 (that I thought were called, "2 
litre wheels" - at least I have seen them advertized this way) that were 
standard on the A.G. 2.0s.  I guess these were an "option" for non-A.G. 
cars?

I can't seem to figure out the difference bewteen Appearance Group and 
non or otherwise, after 1974.  My 1975 2.0 has the gauges, the arm rest that 
opens, fog lamps, maybe it had a leatherette stearing wheel cover, but does 
this mean that it is neceassarily an Appearance Group car?

Sport Group, Appearance Group and Limited Edition cars.  Could someone

Subject: Steering Bushing Repair

OK, here's a repair that's irritating me.

The nylon upper bushing of the steering column on my '87 911 completely
disintegrated.  This caused the steering wheel shaft to have significant
play, and as you hit bumps in the road, the steering wheel would bounce
around in your hands.

I purchased the replacement bushing (SH*T ... $20 for 1/8 ounce of
nylon???).  The bushing has a wide flange on one end, and a rounded
bead on the other.  

Removing the steering wheel was easy just as people have mentioned in
this list.  After studying the bushing and where it needs to fit, it
became appearant that the bushing cannot be inserted from the top of
shaft (where the steering wheel was), but should be inserted from the
bottom.

This, of course, requires removal of the steering shaft.  So, a possible
20-min./1-tool repair is now looking like a ridiculous 1-day/#-tool
fiasco.  I have yet to figure an easy way to get at the steering shaft
u-joint.  Can this be done without removing all the air ducting and
blower in front of the firewall?  

At this point, I'm considering just filing off the bushing bead so I can
slip it in backwards and from the top.  But, then there would be nothing
to prevent it from wiggling itself back out.

Looking for suggestions.  Thanks.

Kim's on the right track, the limited slip is not a locker differential. The
Carrera 2 mechanical limited slip inside the differential case has a lockup
factor of 25 percent under power, and 60 percent under engine braking or
coasting. The Carrera 4 has 25%/40% lockup. If the ABS wheel speed sensors
detect wheelspin despite the action of the mechanical clutch-pack
differential, the ABD comes into play, applying the brake on the spinning
wheel. This automatically transmits torque to the wheel on the other side.
 
On the Carrera 4, if both rear wheels spin despite limited slip and ABD,
more power is diverted to the front wheels by the central viscous clutch.

Subject: Where to buy sheet metal pieces

 
Bill Harper writes
 
>Where can one buy sheet metal pieces at a good price...someone told me
>there was a place in Texas...
 
The place in Texas is Zims. Their sheet metal prices for the stuff they
import from Denmark are incredibly high, but they're the sole importer. The
Danish stuff is the best anywhere, but Zims marks up some items 300 percent
or more over wholesale. Zims is at 1804 Reliance Parkway, Bedford, TX,
76021. Tel. 1-800-356-2964.
 
Example of markup: T6 battery floor, wholesale Denmark 390 Kroner (about $59),
Zims gets $172.50. Another: T5 and T6 floor pans, 1300 Kroner ($159), sells
for $625. Oddly, wholesale on the pre-A floorpan is identical at 1300 Kroner
but Zims seems to feel that pre-A folks enjoy being abused for owning one of
these rare cars so they add another $25 to the price.
 
Simonsen, the Danish maker, seems to have a real problem with his nationally
exclusive dealers. A friend in Germany had some problems with the local
importer first not having the part and making some lame excuses about
changing trucking companies and the order was somewhere out on the road,
then doing an attempted bait and switch on the price. If the maker got away
from these exclusive deals he might sell a whole lot more parts at lower
prices. (Europeans apparently have had the first chapter of Economics 101
censored out of their textbooks; see Porsche's pricing history in the 1980s.
"Oh, sh-t, we're selling less cars than last year. Gotta raise the prices to
keep profits up!")
 
There are others making repro sheet metal. Some is trash, some is a pretty
good alternative to the hyperpriced Danish stuff, it varies from maker to
maker and from piece to piece. I've seen some real trash sold by Tweeks.
Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and buy Danish. Many top restorers
don't even mess around with domestic repro, they just buy from Zims. But then
they are able to pass the cost on to the car owner anyway.

Lance,
I couldn't agree more! Actually my '80SC is more dependable than the 79 Honda
Civic I drove to work in the late '70s-early '80s and certainly longer
lasting( my Civic was falling apart a 65k miles ). My SC has over 220k miles,
it's driven daily in commuter traffic and has stranded me once (for a broken
clutch cable) in the last 100K miles.
I have to admit the AC is tired, it leaks some oil, and in those 1 hour
commutes on I15 I sometimes long for an automatic, but this is still a great
car.

As a different data point, I have had very good experiences with BFG HR4's
(either the old or 'new' HR4).  They have provided near race tire grip on
the street, while doing a very good job in the wet.  Haven't tried them in

(race car) and a VW GTi.  I have ordered a set for the 914, but it
needs an engine before I can try them out.  I agree with Stan on the
size, a 195/65 is a good compromise with tire width, speedo accuracy,

I would assume that Stan was talking about road racing as opposed to
autoxing.  When the BFG came out with the 205/55R14 last year we tested them
back to back with the 185/60R14, and found that they were worth quite a bit
of time at an autox in a Honda.  In the 914 you are fighting different
battles, but I think it is an interesting data point.  It was all worth it
to see Mark D.'s face when we told him what we were doing :-).  He didn't
think that it would work.  [We did make him a believer that weekend though
when I made the Challenge and Lisa did really well in Ladies!]  BFG has
changed their spec sheet to recommend the 205/50 for 5.5" rims for 14's and 
16's, but not 15's - anyone know why?

So, modern race tires have SUCH STILL SIDEWALLS that you can fit them
on a smaller width rim then you might expect.  However, test it before you
depend on it!  The 205/50 was such a win for us as it is exactly the
same height as the 185/60, so we just got more rubber with a slight
weight penalty, but no gearing penalty!

YMMV, as always.

Alex,

Are those the BFG Comp T/A HR4's? If so, that's what I have on my 914
(195/60's) and I can tell you that there is a world of difference between
them and the 509's. I have 509's on an Alfa- they almost make it handle
like a 914, live rear axle and all! The HR4's are probably a good
recommendation for an all round reasonbly priced street tire, though.

Yes they are.  I drove the HR4's on the same car after driving with Yoko RS's,
RSII's, and BFG R1's (autox), and was really impressed with them.   They 
were very hard to get to squeal in the corners and you could actually DRIVE
the car in the wet.  I have never tried the 509's or the AVS's - so YMMV.

This is a pretty common problem on CIS cars. It is usually caused by a 
bad check valve at the fuel pump, which allows system pressure to bleed 
down. Cranking for a long time sometimes starts the car.

The problem can be diagnosed with a fuel pressure guage.

A quick fix, of sorts, is to just barely touch the starter a bunch (12+) 
times before really cranking the engine. Every time you hear the fuel 
pump cycle on and off, it will build up a little more pressure, until 
there is enough to open the high pressure CIS injectors (about 35 psi, I 
think.)

Again, if this proves to be the problem, Porsche supplied at least three 
styles of in line check valves to as a cure.

Hope this helps.

A couple points about chips in general and 944 Turbo's in particular.

First, in my own experience, the upper limit on performance with street 
fuel and only making tuning, i.e. chip, changes, is in the 300 to 320 HP 
range. Even those numbers are only possible with running very high boost. 
The AutoThority Stage 2 kit, which I helped design, runs around 260 to 
270 at 1.0 to 1.1 bar. I always felt that was safe, though not without 
some risk. Experiments with 350+ HP engines usually resulted in bent or 
broken connecting rods; they are just not designed for that kind of stress.

All of the above are my own, personal opinions.

What is not just an opinion is the law surrounding warranties. A 
manufacturer may not void the warranty unless they can show a direct 
cause between any modification made and the part which they do not want 
to warranty. They must do this in writing! Any warranty denial problems 
should be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at 202-326-3128, along 
with the manufacturer of the part in question. 

I have seen PCNA bully too many people in this fashion over the years. 
They make a performance vehicle, one that the owners enjoy so much they 
have the interest in enhancing them. In Germany, the factory supports, or 
at least did in the past, aftermarket tuners. In the US, they threaten 
them and try to discourage Porsche owners from using their products, in 
spite of the law. 

Just in case PCNA's legal guys are reading, let me point out this last 
bit is my own personal opinion.

Also, I pulled the phone number for the FTC out of the article "Factory 
Warranties vs. Aftermarket Performance", in the April, 1993 issue of 
"Truck and Sport Utility Performance."

One last note: Porsche started "checking" for modified chips with the 
968. If the ECU saw that the data on the EPROM was changed, it dropped 
the rev limit to 6100. I don't know if that is being used on the 993, though.

I guess I must be another 'exception' too...  I bought my '87 951 at 80K,
and it's still going strong with 126K after a summer of 10 or so days at
track and auto-x events.  Had to replace the CV joints this summer, but
that's about it other than normal tune-ups.  The current clutch has lasted
for 100K, and the water pump 70K.  I guess I'm either driving a tank, or a
time bomb! 

Chris, had you or your friend with small MTBFs done many upgrades?  I'd be
interested to know if other you or other 951 owners have seen a substantial
increase in failure rates (especially when used at the track) when chips,
larger turbos or other similar upgrades are performed. Thanks.

Subject: Re: RE : What to buy, what to buy

I agree with most of what Mike wrote.  With respect to the 17" wheels,
you also need to consider the limited availability of track tires in
17" sizes.  Better than it used to be, but still largely dictated by
the needs of showroom stock Corvettes.  Also keep in mind that it's
one thing for Yoko or BFG to list a particular size, and it's another
thing for inventory to actually exist.

With respect to the '87 turbo look, I would personally ix-nay the
idea.  On the plus side, you get a wider stance and some turbo
equipment.  On the bigger negative side, you get inferior aerodymanics
from the wider car, and a significantly heavier car.  (I have a big
thing against boutique cars...)

I've never owned or much driven a targa.  But I would say that by all
other reports there is a performance disadvantage.  You probably won't
notice it for a few years, if you're just getting into the track
thing.  And if having the wind in your hair is a big plus, then by
all means buy and enjoy.

I don't know anyone who's had an RS America and not loved the car
to death.  If the $36K car is clean and otherwise meets your needs,
absolutely go for it.  And know that I am jealous!

Subject: Re: 944 turbo chip questions

Hi,

I think most people I know with 944 Turbos have chipped them.
Esp. the folks who play at the track.

I don't know anything about Protomotive, nor do I know anyone who
has used their products.  So I don't know whether they have come
up with their own chip or are reselling one such as Autothority
or Super Chips.
                                    
As a rule of thumb, I disbelieve the horsepower claims in these sorts
of advertisements.  From my experience, it is amazing how many
vendors make quantitative claims without ever having put their
product on a dynamometer.  (The most flagrant, by the way, was a
fellow who recently started running ads with pictures of the dyno
in the shop I hang around, and with which he has no relationship.
The shop owner has since asked him to stop!)

The chips are all geared to give you better torque and horsepower
throughout the RPM range.  They generally claim to make
proportionally more torque in the mid range.

There are basically two avenues to getting more power from a car,
software only.  One is to adjust (advance) the engine timing and/or
lean out the fuel.  Where a car was originally set up for 89 octane
fuel, upgrading to 92 octane and adjusting the timing will get
you some very safe power.  Where a later model car already spec's
premium grade fuel, there is very little if any power to be had this
route.

On turbocharged cars like yours, the second avenue has to do with
modulation of the waste gate circuit.  The waste gate bleeds off
induction pressure.  Porsche rolls off the max boost above 4.5K RPM
(roughly) to lessen the strain on the engine.  The aftermarket
chips are somewhat more optimistic about longevity, and run more
boost higher up.

It's not possible to give a yes-or-no answer to how safe this is.
It depends in large measure on the extent to which the boost is
raised.  You can defeat the waste gate circuit completely and make
all the boost in the world.  For a little while.

Charlie Learoyd was the 924/944 guy on the PCA's tech committee.  He
once suggested that the stock 951 engine could safely make 300 hp.
Charlie's an engineer and a fairly conservative person, and I would
believe him.

I also feel pretty sure that a 944 Turbo engine making 425 hp is a
hand grenade.  Pull the pin, and start counting.  Even professionally
prepared engines, for pro racing, are barely in that power range.

One other thing to keep in mind when chipping 944 Turbo's.  When
they came out with the Turbo S package, Porsche also upgraded a
bunch of other drivetrain components, including the clutch first
and second gear sets (harder surfaces), and the differential.  Not
to mention the brakes!  They did all this to ensure reliable
service from the parts.

Hope this helps.

Seems to be some confusion about the ABD. Kim writes:

I think that if you were really stuck with one wheel and the  car 
is in deep, there are times when the limited slip wouldn't quite get you 
out, since it is not locked. The ABD basically locks both sides. I may 
be wrong about this, maybe others can add to it.

According to what I've read, and what I think I've ordered,  the ABD
functions to limit rear wheelspin relative to one another; if both wheels are
spinning at the same speed, the ABD allows them to spin. (In other words, it
is not traction control.) If enough loss of traction occurs, the
viscous-coupled center differential in the new C4 then begins to transmit
power to the front wheels. This is the gospel according to Car & Driver, at
least. It seems that every automotive magazine gives a slightly different
description.

Also, I'm curious: Anyone out there have any comments on the windscreen that
is now an option on the 993 Cabs? Is it a worthwhile addition or a pain in
the posterior? Thanks.

If we're talking about the Windschott that sits above the rear seat,
I have one and have to say it's excellent.  It folds very neatly into
the roof when the roof is closed.

It's very effective at eliminating vortices at any normal speeds, but I
have to say that the only time we used it on the German autobahn,
it was quite uncomfortable driving with the top down at anything above
about 240 km/h.  At 270 km/h, it's rather difficult to hear anything.

One advantage it also has is that you can drive with the top down in
the rain without getting wet.  You need to run the red traffic lights,
though.

It sounds like vapor lock

Does the pump sound as if it is spinning in air?

If so you need to find a way to get rid of the heat around the pump

UK spec TR6's were famous for this trouble - the cure was to get a length 
of fuel pipe and wrap it around the pump, this pipe was then plumbed into
the injection return pipe. In this way you use the returning fuel as a 
cooler to keep the pump cold.

Subject: 944 - Dies from time to time 


1983 944

The car runs fine most days, but about once a week it just dies. It
always waits until I have the wife and 1 month old baby in the car, and
it's always in the middle of nowhere ....

It has happened after around 10 mins driving, but sometimes after 4 hours.

I just cuts out. It won't restart, but if left for around half an hour
it jumps back into life and runs fine.

OK, now here's what it isn't.

Ingition - no problems.

Fuel pump/relays/whatever - no problem

I know that it's the fuel injection system somewhere. It appears that
the cause of the failure is much too rich a mixture. If I disconnect the
leads to the injecters the engine will fire and run for 1-2 seconds. When
reconnected it won't start again.

The problem with diagnosing this is that it will happily run all day long
on the driveway, or when I have all my tools with me (no wife/child), and
have the time to poke about.

I've tested, as best I can, the temperature sensor, throttle position switch,
air flow mas/temp sensors and all seem OK.

In the midst of months of diagnosis I actualy went down several self inflicted
false trails, bad connections to the DME control box/ temp sensors and the like.

I've cleaned up all the contacts (including the earth leads on the engine), but
the problem still appears.

What else could cause the mixture to go suddenly so rich as to kill the engine
stone dead ?

My next line of attack, when it happens again, is to check the fuel rail
pressure. It's normally fine, but maybe the regulator is getting jammed. Any
other things I should be thinking about ??

Last, but not least, how hot should be DME control unit get under normal
running condidtions. Some days (but not neccesserily the days the car fails),

DME should not be hot.  Have you opened it up to see what is making it so???

I would check engine temp sensors...Perhaps one is telling the DME that 
your engine is still cold...

Of course, it could be your DME with an intermittent failure.

>I've seen mentioned here that 15" wheels are faster on the track.  I missed
>the original argument.  Can someone fill me in?

Most people are probably referring to the gearing differences between
different sized tires.  Let me give some numbers from the latest BFG
spec sheet:

size		diameter	section width on rim width
225/50R15	23.8		8.8 / 7.0
245/50R15	24.6		9.6 / 7.5
265/50R15	25.4		10.5 / 8.5

225/50R16	24.8		8.8 / 7.0
245/45R16	24.5		9.2 / 8.0
255/50R16	26.0		10.0 / 8.0

In an ideal world you would have the widest tire with the smallest
diameter to maximize your contact patch and gearing.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't always work that way, though it does sometimes.  
If you look at the 225/50R16 vs 245/45R16 one would ask why would you
run the 225?  The 245 is wider and it is SHORTER!  Big win. 

If you upgrade to 16's it would behove you to pick a rim size that
would work with the best tire width to minimize your tire height.

For instance, the 255/50R16 may sound pretty trick, but it is .6
inches higher then the 265/50R15 (which is also high) and gives you
.5 LESS contact patch!

Going from the above numbers it looks like ALL the 15 inch tires
have advantages over the 16's.  And I have not even mentioned tire
weight and cost!

Based on the above table you will see that the 16" vs 15" tires have MORE
sidewall height, not less, so that is not a good reason to upgrade.  That,
and the fact that the sidewalls on the BFG 230's are SO stiff that you don't
worry about them.  You try to maximize your width on rim size.  Their
stiffness if how we manage to fit a 205/55R14 on a 5.5 inch rim!

Subject: Re: 944 turbo chip questions


Hi all,

I have to agree with Larry on the Porsche turbo chip issue. The maximum 
we have seen on a stock engine running reliably is 315 HP. This is at 15 
PSI or 1.1 bar boost. Over this the head gasket soon goes and over 17 
PSI the injectors run out so the engine runs lean and melts. So, any 
claim to get more than 350 HP on a chip only is very suspicious. Chip, 
injectors and a head-block modification to prevent gasket failure would 
be required at the very least. Then you would run into more problems with 
the transmission, fuel pumps, seals and lots of other things. 

The rev limiter on the Bosch management system was introduced on the 968 
and continues on the 993. It works like this. If you modify the chip 
without defeating the rev limiter protection, the car will run for about 
5 minutes and then rev limit to 3000 RPM approximately. It makes it very 
difficult to beat because it takes 5 minutes to test each change you 
make to the software. We beat it but we had some help from Porsche!!!

The people who are offering this upgrade to 400+HP are not Superchips 
dealers

Boy, I knew I shouldn't have said anything about this <grin>..
  My friend's '87 951 had no modifications.  His worst experience
was his clutch going.  (A problem which was further exacerbated
by the flatbed operator's mishandling of the car.)  
  Off the top of my head my experiences ('87 951) included:
 - C02 test tube breaking off
 - A/C hose leak(s)
 - Gear tooth sensor failure (poor diagnosis made this
   a _very_ expensive experience)
 - sunroof no longer working automatically
 - head gasket failure
The head gasket failure I attribute to the Autothority chip's
higher boost.  My mechanic's opinion of these cars was
that they were "60,000 mile cars".  He said we had been
better off than most (of his 951 customers) in our experiences.  
  Don't get me wrong, I really love the 951. IMO, there are few
areas in which my 911 is superior - such as the larger parcel
shelf on the engine lid. :-)  My 951's were faster, quieter, had more
room, better brakes [?],  better handling, better shifting,
better heat, better A/C.  And the '87 even had airbags.  I suspect
the S or 89 Turbos would be even nicer.  
  BTW: Even then, depreciation was such that my friend's 951 
was his winter "beater".  His summer car was a 911.
  mind the flames,
    Chris

Thicker is better if you can master welding a thick sheet to a thin sheet.
There is a definite tendency to burn through the thinner (or rusty) sheet
while trying to get the thick sheet hot enough. If you are doing resistance
spot welds alone and no gas or MIG welding, the thickness is no problem at
all. Usually it's rare to be able to resistance spot well all of a repair,
but it's the way to go for appearance, originality, and ease. Clamp --

Subject: tires/wheels clarification

I need to clarify one point in my original posting of 15" vs 16" rims.

OD in my terminology refers to Outside Diameter = rolling diameter.

When I was looking for tires and thinking of upgrading, I was told that
     215/55R15 had OD=23.7
     225/50R16 had OD=23.8
Or something of this nature.  Wider/lower-profile tire on bigger rim had
approximately the same OD as Narrower/higher-profile tire on smaller rim.

So, this was what I meant by "comparable OD".  Seems that a bigger footprint
with shorter sidewall, for the same OD would be good.

There really isn't an 'optimal' temperature for your tires.  The pyrometer 
is used to determine the proper tire pressure.

Right after a nice hard run, the pyrometer is used to measure temp across 
the tread.  If the temp is even, you are at the 'proper' temperature for 
that day in that ambient temperature on that track with those tires.

If the center temps are too high, your pressure should be decreased, and 
conversely the pressure should be increased if the outer readings are higher 
than the center.

Wish I had one.

Fred Pack and I had some time this morning, so we opened up the dash on
our blue 914, replaced the diode to the handbrake light, and voila,
the handbrake light works.

Thanks Gary and Craig, both of whom, I think, suggested this as the
problem. And the replacement diode 1N4001 was 49 cents for 2 at Radio
Shack, thanks Gary.

Mark

   My warning light just went out.  Where exactly does this diode reside? On
   the back of the gauge?  I presume it needs to be soldered?

   Because this light was not working, I, like a moron drove of with my
   parking brake partially engaged and thoroughly cooked my right rear rotor.
   I thought the car felt awfully sluggish!  At a stop light, someone pulled
   up pointed to my left rear wheel and mouthed the words "your on fire".
   What a wonderful feeling.  It turned out that nothing actually ignited but
   the rotor looked like molten lava.  The next day, upon inspection I found
   the rotor actually looked alright!  It doesn't appear to be warped and
   the car continued to brake as normal.

   I decided to bleed the system and everthing was going alright until I moved
   to the right front wheel.  I could get no fluid expelled from the caliper
   and from that point I lost *all* brake pressure.  What did I screw up this
   time??!!  Did I damage the master cylinder with boiled fluid?

One good thing about the "Scat Mat" is that is doesn't scare
the cat. They jump on it and decide that it isn't as comfortable
as they expected, so the get down. No drama, no trauma.
Eventually, they learn that there are more comfortable places
to sleep. (probably wherever the mat isn't :-) They make
dummy mats for use with a cat who has already learned to
visually inspect the "landing area".

It is a very heavy gauge mat. I doubt a scared cat would
damage the car under it.

Subject: 914 Brakes

Porschephiles, Thanks for all the comments on 914 brakes. To summarize
these comments, most people don't seem that happy with 914 brakes in their
stock form. I wonder if this is an effect of age, or whether the brakes
were always unsatisfactory. I wish I had a brand-new 914 for purposes of
comparison! (Come to think of it, if I had a brand-new 914, why would I
bother with the comparison?) Anyway, since my brake pedal is firm, and
lacks excessive play, perhaps the suggestions most relevant to my problem,
which is a lack of "grip", is to replace my Feddoro pads with Cool Carbons
(street formulation),  or to completely replace the front caliper/
rotors/master cylinder with another type. Also, personally, I wouldn't
increase the diameter of the master cylinder, as suggested, unless the
slave cylinder was also increased, since this would reduce mechanical
advantage. Of course, it really depends on how much you can leg press, as

    Chris,
    
    FWIW...If the car is getting hot (ie... idling in a MacDonalds 
    carport), the fuel pump pressure may not be up to snuff.  I had a 
    similar problem in my Jetta, where the car would run great and then 
    just die.  It really only happened when the car got hot and then the 
    car wouldn't run.  The fuel pump would continue to pump, but just not 
    enough volume to increase the pressure sufficiently for the 
    temperature.

Subject: Grabbing Brakes on '86 928S

Hello P-philers,
I am having a problem with the brakes on my '86 928S and was wondering if
the net wisdom could give me some help in dealing with it.  Sometimes as
I am driving, I become aware, through a noticeable vibration of the steering
wheel, that the brakes are beginning to engage without any initiation on my part.
If I lift the brake pedal up with my foot, the dragging goes away at that time,
but could slowly return as I continue to drive.  A mechanic whose judgement I
trust told me that he does not believe there is anything wrong with the master
cylinder, but that the power boost may need to be looked at.
Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing with P-cars or know what the
problem might be?  The car is in otherwise excellent shape, and has outstanding
stopping power when I do need it.
Thanks,
Jim

Hi Gene.  

Years ago, I had a 1981 924 which experienced similar problems.  
After driving the car, I would let it sit for about 1/2 hour and it would 
not restart.  If I let it sit for extended periods of time, or if I 
restarted the car right away it would work.  Does this sound familiar?
  
If so, I you should see if your check valve is working properly.  After a 
great deal of frustration, I finally got the problem fixed for only $70 
or so.  

I realize there is little similar between an old 924 and a 911, but it 
may be worth a look.

  Last year I went round and round with BFG about getting them to build
some tires to fit the front of my RS America (i.e. 205/50-17).  I finally
got my set in April of this year.  For people wanting to autocross an RS
America in SCCA stock, these are a must.   The last time I talked
to the BFG people, they had planned production for a 235/45-17 which is
about perfect.  The way I resolved the inventory thing was to establish
a good working relationship with the ladys at BFG that take the phone 

orders.  Instead of ragging on them, I cut them some slack and just 

asked them to keep me up to date with what was going on and said 

"Thank you".  Having done this, they initiated calls to me on several 

occasions to let me know what the status of production was and I received 

them very shortly after they rolled off the line, shaved and all.  Yoko, on 

the other hand, basically told me to piss off when I asked about the 

possiblity of getting fittment.  YMMV...

Amen.  The problem is that the car is so quick and stable, it's easy to
find yourself driving at 10/10ths (me, not the car) and occasionally over.
Mine's getting a reprieve from track events while I get some more seat

Good point, based on the responses I've been getting, 17" rims are way over

These are the average prices, for every car $5k less, I've seen one $5K more
as well.  I know I could do better than those prices in a real deal, but
that's what I'm seeing in asking prices.

After doing some detective work, I found out this car had serious damage done
to it on Pacific Coast Highway during a landslide.  The body panels were
replaced, and the frame was straightened.  I think I'll pass on it for now.
If anyone is interested in the car, send me private email, its still for sale
as of noon December 19.

The search continues, field narrowed a bit in some area, wider in others.

Given that I tend to do my own work, I think that the mechanical clutch is
better than the hydrolic for me.

Thus far, I think the car that I am looking for is:

1986 Carrera Coupe/Targa, 16" rims ok, wide 15" rims better, sport seats,
lsd, spoilers don't matter, color don't matter, won't pay extra for nice
stereo (don't use it), track options big plus (5 point harness, bolt-in cage,

Subject: Re: 15, 16, 17 wheels and tires

>I've seen mentioned here that 15" wheels are faster on the track.  I missed
>the original argument.  Can someone fill me in?

Most people are probably referring to the gearing differences between
different sized tires.  Let me give some numbers from the latest BFG
spec sheet:

size		diameter	section width on rim width
225/50R15	23.8		8.8 / 7.0
245/50R15	24.6		9.6 / 7.5
265/50R15	25.4		10.5 / 8.5

225/50R16	24.8		8.8 / 7.0
245/45R16	24.5		9.2 / 8.0
255/50R16	26.0		10.0 / 8.0

In an ideal world you would have the widest tire with the smallest
diameter to maximize your contact patch and gearing.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't always work that way, though it does sometimes.  
If you look at the 225/50R16 vs 245/45R16 one would ask why would you
run the 225?  The 245 is wider and it is SHORTER!  Big win. 

If you upgrade to 16's it would behove you to pick a rim size that
would work with the best tire width to minimize your tire height.

For instance, the 255/50R16 may sound pretty trick, but it is .6
inches higher then the 265/50R15 (which is also high) and gives you
.5 LESS contact patch!

Going from the above numbers it looks like ALL the 15 inch tires
have advantages over the 16's.  And I have not even mentioned tire
weight and cost!

Based on the above table you will see that the 16" vs 15" tires have MORE
sidewall height, not less, so that is not a good reason to upgrade.  That,
and the fact that the sidewalls on the BFG 230's are SO stiff that you don't
worry about them.  You try to maximize your width on rim size.  Their
stiffness if how we manage to fit a 205/55R14 on a 5.5 inch rim!

Hi, Pete.

Well, it's a little hard to describe, but I did the long form.  Oh
yeah, just for reference, we left Santa Barbara at 10:24.00 pm, dawn
was a little before Barstow.

Here's the route we took for the Starlite Monte Carlo Rally:

Started at San Marcos High School on Hollister Ave. in Santa Barbara.
Left the school going west on Hollister Ave.
Right on Turnpike Rd
Left  onto 101 North
Right (exit 101) at Buellton and then turn Left onto the 246
Right on Drum Canyon
Right on the 135, go under the 101, turn Left to enter the 101 North
Right onto Palmer Rd
Right onto Foxen Canyon
Left  on Tpusquet (There's a pair of gates on this section were there
                   there's a dirt road that is washed out in the rain.
                   It wasn't intended as part of the route, but we
                   took it to save time.  Remember to slow down.)
Right on 166
Right on Perkins Rd (go down 2.5 miles, turn around and come back out)
Right on 166 (again)
Right on Kirschenmann (go down to Schaeffer Rd, turn around and come
                       back out)
Right on 166 (again)
Right on Cerro Noroeste Rd
Right on Klipstein Canyon Rd (at the "T")
Left  on Cuddy Valley Rd (go all the way and cross under the I-5)
Left  onto I-5 North (this is in Gorman, just after the Grapevine
                      summit.)
Right exit I-5 at Grapevine and turn Left at first intersection
      (Now, try to get gas at the slowest pumps in the state while
       you're here.) Go down 0.5 mile, turn around come back out.
      Enter I-5 North again.
Right exit I-5 at first opp. and turn Right, then Left to get onto
      Wheeler Ridge.
Left  on Valpredo Rd
Left  at "T" (Possibly Legray Rd)
Left  on Kraft Rd (becomes Wheeler Ridge)
Right on the 223
Right on the 58
Right exit the 58 and get on Woodford (follow this as it becomes
      Tehachapi Rd)
Left  on the 202
Right on Tucker Rd
Left  on Highline Rd
Right onto Tehachapi Willow Springs Rd
Left  on Backus Rd
Left  enter 14 North
Right on the 58
Right exit the 58 at Gephart Rd.  Turn right on Gephart at the end
      of the ramp.
Left  on Twenty Mule Team Rd
Left  on Borax
Left  on Suckow
Left  on Twenty Mule Team Rd
Right enter the 58 East (again)
Left  at "T"
Right first opp., go to just before the freeway, turn around and go
      back.
Right on Irwin Rd
Right on Ft Irwin.  (Go over the I-15 and find the last road to make
      a Left on.)
Left  last opp.
Left  on Calico Road
Left  enter the I-15 North
Right exit the I-15 at the first exit for Baker
Left  on the 127
Right on Old Spanish Trail
Left  on Tecopa Hot Springs Rd
Left  on the 127
Left  on Old Spanish Trail (again)
Right on the 160
Left  onto the I-15 North
Right exit the I-15 at Craig Rd, turn Left onto Craig Rd.
Left  on Losee Rd
Right first opp (Lone Mountain)
Left  on Belmont St
Left  on La Madre Wy and end just befor the corner.

I know this is a bit strange, but from the maps, this is the route
that was taken by my wife and myself on the Starlite Monte Carlo
Rally.  So, next time you're going from Santa Barbara to Las Vegas,
grab a bunch of AAA maps and you'll have another route to try.  Travel
time for our car was exactly 13 hours 36.50 minutes.

I'll add another minor think to check.  I had a similar problem in my 930 (and
that's pretty unnerving!).  Turns out my problem was that the rotors didn't meet
spec for surface smoothness, even though they seemed pretty flat.  The rears
were resurfaced, fronts needed replacement (youch) and I also dropped in a

It definitely stops now.  This is obvious, but might be worth a look...

Dear Pat,

By all means, change your '75-'76 914 to the earlier ('73-'74) 2.0 heat
exchanger system with Bursch muffler. 5 HP will certainly be added at the top
end!

This system will still pass a 49 state emmission check (if air pump is
retained) and pollute little while providing the hottest heat.

The Bursch muffler, unlike the '75-'76 factory original, does not retain
moisture to any great extent and therefore will last a long time.

As to your second question:

1. Dual bulb front turn signal units are readily available and will directly
pllug into the US spec wring harness.
2. I cannot believe you have to add a headlight washer, but if you do,
purchase the unit in Europe as it was never exported to the U.S.A. It is
completely independent using its own tank pump and lines.
3. The rear foglamp is easily added with special bracket and harness. It
plugs into the rear taillight harness quite easily.
4. The kilometer per hour gauge will plug in directly.

Pat, it seems that your conversion is an easy one. Good luck!

Since the factory welded metal over metal when manufacturing the 914, we can

I works great and will not corrode. We chip guard any exposed to the road

Dear Robert,

The rear glass and frame separation is a common one. The two parts are
factory jigged and glued into one strong piece.

Because of this, the do-it-yourself repair is impossible. The solution is to
have a glass shop remove the hatch and reglue it for you.

Often, when the frame separates, it begins to hit the roof and/or will not
release, so be careful!

<Gary.

Any 914 with the dealer installed air has been fairly well butchered and
never should have the air conditioning removed. However, the engine is not
too badly butchered. Modifications for air are as follows:

  Engine:  1. Right cylinder cover shortened near j pipe attachment
approximately 3/4"
           2. Spacer removed behind fab and pulley added.
           3. Oil cooler bracket removed
           4. Front engine sheet metal removed

  Car body:  1. Approximately 12 one inch loes cut into the body for hoses
with various sheetmetal screw holes cut for bracketing.
              2. Large, approximatley 2x3 foot hole cut in the bottom of the
front trunk for the condenser assembly
              3. Hole cut in pass carpeting and body for water drain.
              4. If console equipped, console cut down approximately three
inches for interior unit clearance

The conclusion:  If your 914 is equipped with AC, do not remove it!

Subject: leakdown on #4

Hi all,

I'd appreciate the collective wisdom on something. I just had
my 45K mile major service done by a mechanic I have had real
good luck with over the past 2.5 years. I have an '88 911
Carrera. The car has been running great - no problems of any
kind and no history of any. As a part of the service, he did
a compression check and leakdown on all 6 cylinders. 5 of the
6 checked out great, 180-185 with miniscule leakdown. #4
showed compression OK at 180, but had a 44% leakdown. My
mechanic said that the car is just running too good for
this to be a real problem, and he thinks it is probably
just some carbon build-up on that one cylinder. He
suggested a fuel additive (Swepco, STP, etc.) for the
next few tanks full of fuel, and then a re-check.

Anybody out there ever have similar experience? Any
thoughts or advice?

Thanks,
David

A pyrometer can also be used to help tune the suspension settings

The above is gleaned from a book that I am currently reading and

Bob,
	I too, have checked into this battery situation with similar results.
However, at Kragen Autoparts, they sell a small(?) battery for $38.88.  It
measures 9 23/32 x 6 7/8 x 6 7/8.  I haven't purchased and tried this
yet, so don't know if this will fit. Do you have the dimensions of the 
OEM battery?

OZ makes some great centerlocks.  They provide wheels for F-1 applications, 
but I don't know about composites.

Find someone who orders from OZ in Italy.  They have models which aren't 
offered here and most dealers don't even know they exist.  They do special 
orders, ($$$) but it can take up to 4 months to get the product.

   PORSCHE ANNOUNCES WORLD SPORTS CAR RACING PROGRAM FOR 1995

RENO, Nev., Dec. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche today revealed plans to
contest the world's three premier sports car endurance races in 1995
with a new thoroughbred sports prototype race car.
Created to compete in the World Sports Car (WSC) category, the new
entry is an open-cockpit tw-seat design built in cooperation with TWR
of the U.S.  It is powered by a three-liter turbocharged Porsche engine
which is limited to 530 horsepower by air restrictors and boost pressure
regulations mandated by WSC category rules.  The new entry also
incorporates the gearbox and driveline from the 962 LeMans GT model.
Porsche began the project in October of 1994 after sanctioning
bodies for the world's three leading endurance sports car races, the
24 Hours of LeMans in France and the 24 Hours of Daytona and the
12 Hours of Sebring in Florida, all agreed to permit WSC entries powered
by turbocharged engines to compete in their 1995 events.  The new model
is currently undergoing testing prior to its debut in the Rolex 24 at
Daytona on February 4 and 5 of 1995.  It will then contest the Sebring
event on March 18 and the famed LeMans racing classic in June.
With more overall victories in these three prestigious events than
any other marque, Porsche is the most successful manufacturer in the
history of international sports car endurance racing.  Since 1960,
Porsche-powered entries have won the three races a combined 48 times.
This total includes 18 victories in the 24 Hours of Daytona, 17 wins in
the 12 Hours of Sebring and 13 titles in the 24 Hours of LeMans.

What can happen you (eng) can get a piece of carbon between the valve 
and seat and get a misreading on leakdown. I agree use so cleaner swepco 
or red line for next couple of tanks. The fuels now containg detergent 
and  this builds up on the back of the valves.

Consider the advantage of going to (using the above example sizes as a

gearing. Lower gearing may not be an advantage for road racing, but it
usually is for autocross.

True, given equal OD.

The limiting factor in wheel size is usually one (or both) of two things: brake
size and sanctioning body rules. My PCA region specifies minimum diameters
for stock autocross classes. Where rules are not the issue, then the diameter
of your brake rotors and the size of the caliper mounted over the rotor will
constrain the minimum wheel size you can use. In general, to maximize
cornering ability, you want to minimize CG and slip angle, which means
minimum wheel diameter and sidewall height. (You also want to
maximize the tread width up to a point, but you knew that).

Note that some people simply prefer the looks of larger diameter
wheels when used with super low profile tires. They fill the fender
openings better. So, while beauty may be in the eye of the beholder,
lap times are another matter altogether. ;-)

Subject: Re:15,16,17 wheels and tires

Alex,

I inferred from your reply that you say 16" tires have more sidewall
height than 15" for the BFG sizes you listed. I agree that the ones
you listed have a larger diameter for the same section width, but I
would not agree about the sidewall height. Sidewall height to me is
the distance from the road surface to the rim and is the distance of
concern for sidewall flex. This number is approximately

    (tire diameter - rim diameter) / 2

So for your listed tire sizes:

size                diameter           sidewall height

225/50R15           23.8               4.4
245/50R15           24.6               4.8
265/50R15           25.4               5.2

225/50R16           24.8               4.4
245/45R16           24.5               4.25
255/50R16           26.0               5.0

This is what is meant by aspect ratio: The first number is related to
section width/the second number is sidewall height as a percent of
section width/R is for radial/last number is diameter. So the percent
is the aspect ratio, ie. 245(width in mm)=9.6" x 50% = 4.8" height.
These numbers are approximate and each manufacturer is slightly different
so you need to check their specs. Also deflection under load is not
taken into account here. Obviously, the 45 series tire(aspect ratio)has
the shortest sidewall height which implies less deflection for equal
sidewall construction. But, overall I agree with you that tire construction
of the sidewall(like a BFG R1) has the greater affect on sidewall deflection.
Smallest diameter with the widest section width should be selection criteria
for equal tire construction.

Yes, this is true if you are using 60 series tires (factory size) on your 15"
rims. But why not try 50 series tires?

Your '87 911 Targa will be very competitive with 7x15 front and 8x15 rear
factory Fuchs alloys, with 225/50/15 front and 245/50/15 rear. These wheels
were a factory option on your car. These tires will have a lower OD than any
normally available comparable width 16" tires (and they are cheaper too). The
front (left probably) fender lip may need to be rolled under, and your water
bottle (?) may rub if your car is very low. 

I ran this combination on an '86 911 and it worked (and looked) great. Very
low, great gearing, and lots of tire for accelerating. We didn't even need a
limited slip (which would make the car plow too much anyway in slow corners).

    Just a thought here... don't know if you've already done this or
not.. have you thought about a relief valve for your airbox?  Don't know

Well, my 944 ('84) does exactly the same thing. I've never understood why.

On a slightly different note, I have had an intermittent problem on my 944.
This happens only when the car is warm and has less than half a tank of
gas. I will be driving along and all of a sudden the car will lose power
for a split second and then resume as normal. Sometimes it does it multiple
times, and other times just a couple of times and then it stops. It has
only done this about three times altogether, and the last time (about one
month ago) it was doing it quite bad, but then *immediately* stopped when I
filled up with gas. It did this again today. Up until now, the car had
always started to act up when I was on a tank of gas that probably had
ethanol in it (and I never worried because I figured it was just the sub
standard gas causing the problem). Today however, it started acting up on a
half tank of Amoco premium gold which shouldn't have ethanol. Again I
should point out, this is a very intermittent problem.

My question is, is this the sign of a fuel pump going bad ?  In the past my
experience with fuel pumps is that they just go dead (on my 924 the body of
the pump actually rusted through).

Please let me know of any ideas any of you might have !!!  If this is the
fuel pump, I want to get it out of there and get a new one in before it
completely fails and strands me, but on the other hand, I don't want to
spend around $200 for a fuel pump I don't need.

BTW, this is an '84 944 and as far as I can tell (records, etc.) the fuel
pump is the original one (ie - it hasn't been replaced). The car has 90k on
it.


Thanks !!!

to go.  Just curious, what is the mileage of this route?  Can't wait to try
it out!

Subject: 944 wheels and tires

I am posting this for a fellow 944 owner.
He recently purchased a Kelly Moss prepared 944S2 Club Sport for use at track  
events including some PCA racing. The car weighs about 2830#.  His previous  
car is a modified '86 951.

We are curious about recommendations for wheel/tire combinations
on this car.  Currently it has 225/xx/16 and 245/45/16's
He would like wider rubber and says that a narrower front than rear
tire is what Kelly Moss recommends.

I remember recent posts regarding 951's running 8.5's and 10x17 with 255/40  
and 275/40s and recall that there was no rubbing.
This would be a reasonable setup for this car.

The main reason for the change to 17" wheels is that it seems that
the largest 16" tire with a low (<=45) profile is a 245 width.

I think the car came with two sets of 16" wheels however, so
a 16" solution would be cheaper of course.

Comments appreciated!

Hello P-gang,

I'm just curious about a couple of things....

Is it considered "good practice" to use them even with steel studs and
steel cylinders (eg 2.0 engine) when they may not really be needed?

Should you use them with 3.0 and 3.2 engines?

When you use them, should you use the large (14x2?) or small
(12.5x1.5)?  I know of at least 1 machine shop that swears by using
the large ones.

Is there a case when you should never use them or where using the
large ones would do something bad?

There ya go....everything you wanted to know about Time Serts but
were afraid to ask - so I asked for you!  :-)

Thanks,

I recently experienced similar problems with my 930.  After trying many 
things; including new injectors, new fuel pumps (both front and rear), 
instalation of a check valve infront of the fuel pumps, and rewireing the 
fuel pump so it could pump gas through the line prior to ignition....none 
of which worked, the problem was solved by replacing the accumulator.  
Simple and relatively cheap item.  Not familiar with the 911 engine, but 
you might chech out the accumulator.  The symptoms you described were 
identical.  Wouldn't start after the engine was turned off for a few 
minutes, then after several minutes, usually >30, it would.  Mimicked a 
vapor lock and kind of is, since the pressure leaks back from built up 
heat passed the leaking accumulator.  Hope this is of some help.

Thats interesting - I didn't mention it but my car also experiences this
intermittent cut out prob.

I may have been driving for 30 miles or so when it starts to miss, the 
miss is irregular, on one or two occasions it has been so had that I have 
been forced to pull off the road - the car then 
bubbles and farts, the engine continues to run and then after a couple of 
minutes it settles down and I am able to resume with normal power.

It usual happens when I am running with less than full tank, I drive 
around 85 miles to work, so I am usually pushing along as fast as traffic 
will allow (nudge,wink - luckily we don't have many radar traps on UK out 
of town roads) it never happens at high speed usually it happens at 50-75 
mph. It has happened ever since i bought the car 40k miles ago and has 
not got any worse

I do not think this is related to the grunting phenomena - but perhaps...

Very interesting two lines of discussion.

I  wonder if they are related. In my case, the car behaves the same
way, but slightly more drastically (ie it's so bad that it stops altogether).

I have once had it just miss in this irregular way, and then catch again, about 
10 minutes before it did one of its hour-dead little games.

I haven't noticed, and can't recall, how much fuel exactly was in the tank
when it goes wrong, but around half could be possible.

Mine has never happened at high speed either. Normally in traffic, or less
than a couple of minutes from the last junction/stop.

I haven't noticed any 'grunting' noise when stopped with the engine off,
but I have noticed what I could only describe as a 'singing' noise from
that area , sometimes many hours after the car last ran.


In reply to a couple of other suggestions made to me .

	I don't think it's the engine temperature sensor as I have measured
	the resistance between DME control plug pin  13 and earth when it is
       'dead' and got around the correct reading (200 Ohms).

	If it were the fuel pump not managing to generate enough pressure,
	would I still see the 'flooding' when it won't start. i.e. It will
	fire if I disconnect the fuel injector leads ?

	Oh, and I've tried therapy, for myself, car, and family. Maybe it's
	the Dog that doesn't like the new baby and is p*&&#%^ in the fuel

Could this be caused by a clogged tank vent? Is it possible to have enough
negative pressure build up in the tank that the fuel pump cannot draw gas
from it. After the fart (some relief valve openning up?) pressure returns
to normal and symtom goes away. Pressure would also be released when openning
the tank to fill up...

Chances are this is just the result of some carbon on the valve seat, and 
there is really nothing to do. Might be worth rechecking in a few 
thousand miles.

One idea I always liked was to do the leakdown at the same time as the 
valve adjustment. If there was excessive leakage on one cylinder, carbon 
was usually the culprit, and this could lead to an incorrect valve 
clearance. What we would do is just tap the valve (retainer actually) 
with a brass drift while pressure was being applied through the leak down 
tester. This usually cleared up the problem and insured an accurate valve 
adjustment.

          DATE:      12/20/94
          SUBJECT:   911 MFI Questions
 
 
I have some questions about Mechanical Fuel Injected Cars, and would like
to find out from other owners of MFI cars what their experience has been.
 
I have a '72T (94k miles) that I purchased over the summer, that looks
really good, and drives great (I can only imagine what a "E" or "S" would
run like!).  The previous owner had to replace the MFI pump with a rebuilt
unit, one month before I purchased it ($3000.00 repair bill, ouch!).  I
guess he realized how little he was driving it, compared to his ratio of
repair cost.
 
One of the problems that I would like to solve is the idle.  It idles very
low (~500 rpm) and I can not get the idle up.  Because of this low idle I
think there is a miss.  The miss disappears once the rpms go above ~1500.
 
I have the Hanes Manual, and purchased a copy of the MFI factory manual.
Both are incomplete when it comes to details of the MFI system.  The
factory MFI manual is interesting reading and gives the proper order of
setting the throttle links and everything else, but after walking through
the steps I have not improved the idle.
 
I have an Unisync carburetor sync tool that I have used to try to even the
flow between the stacks (at 3000 rpm).  I noticed that no matter how much
I turned the air correction screws on some stacks the flow never changed.
I figured that they may have been carboned up, and cleaned them like the
MFI book details, but saw no improvement.  I then determined that the
throttle plates must be at different angles.  When I disconnected the
throttle rods and then sortend or lengthened them I was able to get the
flow of the stacks more even.  Of course this would affect the position of
the throttle plates at idle, since all the plates may not be on their
stops.
 
I then felt that I was onto something, and after searching the archives I
found a posting by someone who detailed how to set the throttle plates.
They describe the process as using a piece of paper to set the initial
plate opening, then turning the plate stop screws evenly until the idle is
close to where it should be, installing the throttle links with no
preload, then performing the 3000 rpm sync, using the air correction
screws.  Is this a reasonable procedure?
 
I know I can send the intake system to Eurometrics and have the system
rebuilt and flowbenched, for $$.  Is it reasonable to rebuild, and spend
$$'s on the intake system without fixing/replacing anything else on the
motor?  The car runs great, and I do not plan to open up the motor before
it needs it.
 
Has anyone else adjusted the MFI system, with success?  The mechanics that
I talk to say "If the MFI system runs OK, then don't touch it".  I
understand why, it can take a lot of time, and one can quickly begin to
rack up a lot of $'s in fixing small MFI problems.
 
Also does anyone have a source for the MFI throttle links?  I have several
that are bent or the threads are stripped.  I know that I can probably get
the ball joint ends, and would have to have the shafts made, but are there
sources of complete links from other car types, carburetor setups, or
specialty racing suppliers?

Len -
This could be it

there is always an escape of air when i open the gas filler cap, I have
been unable to determine if the air is rushing in or out, there appears to
be no air vent on the cap itself, is there a separate vent? if so where is
it?

On UK spec cars, the filler is on the right side, only a matter of a foot 
from the pump and fuel filter, so logically the vent must be in the same 
area, the noise may thus be coming from this vent rather than the pump.

I will investige further.

I am afraid that it is not technically possible to write a program
as stupid as the T*dster given current scientific knowledge. Further 
advanced research in Artificial Stupidity Systems (ASS) will undoubtedly 
produce a suitable breakthrough eventually. ASS are thought to have a great

What a stupid idea!  I can't believe you'd have the nerve to suggest 
such a foolish stunt.  What's worng with you?  You must drive one of 
those pathetic Volkswagen-Porsche wannabe cars.

Regarding this thread about wheel/tire size: You people are a bunch 
of idiots!  Can't you see that a narrower tire will give less rolling 
resistance, thus allowing you to go much faster?  A narrow tire will 
also give a more symmetrical cross section, which will greatly 
improve cornering.  My times at the last autocross school were 
significantly better because of my tire selection.

Enough of this foolishness.

P-Files,

Are there any 911 owners on the list that have gone to the trouble of 
installing a top-notch stereo in their car?  I've seen 911 competition 
cars with subwoofers mounted in the front trunk area, ported to the 
interior (lots of metal cutting I would guess).  I've also seen systems 
with midbass and tweeter configurations mounted in the front footwells 
and angled up towards the ceiling.  I know A/D/S once marketed something 
called the 911 Music System.  I'm curious if anyone has one of these or 
knows any of the details about it.
Right now I'm in the research phase of my project.  My last stereo 
installation (not in a 911) took me over 300 hours to complete and more 
$$$ than I care to remember.  The 911 seems to be a very challenging 
project.  There really isn't much space available (especially for 
subwoofers).  I expect it's going to require a good deal of creativity 
to do well.
Any input from the group would be appreciated...

Subject: Bolt grades

I've started doing the strut job from hell and these bolts are rusted solidly 
in place.  I managed to round one completely and after repeated applications 
of heat,oil and much swearing, I finally got it out using **vise-grips** (no 
room to drill out).

Anyway, does anyone have a summary of metric bolt grading schemes?  For 
example, the bolts I'm replacing are marked "115".  I'm assuming this means 
11.5.  I seem to remember reading somewhere that the higher the number, the 
more brittle the bolt.  I got 2 replacement bolts from a friend marked 8.8.  I
know I should get the exact replacement from a dealer but what is the scale 
used here (not logarithmic, I hope)?  What is the difference in tensile 
strength between 8.8 and 11.5?

I have a contact who is promising *NEW* 951 Factory lower control arms for 
~$300-$400.  This part lists for $700.  It seems he's worked out some private 
deal with PCNA.   Contact me privately if interested.

While on the subject, we had a lengthy discussion on 951 ball-joint failure.  
One possible reason is due to much larger sway bars than stock which puts too 
much load on the ball-joint and control arm.  The SCCA racers (Firehawk 
series?) were running Turbo Cup suspension, the 'vette weenies went crying to 
SCCA saying the 951s were using race susp. Since sway-bars are free, the 951s 
then went to  **50 mm** sway-bars in front which exceeded the design limits of
the stock ball-joints/control arms.  This information is being relayed 
second-hand from conversations with Jon Milledge so don't take it as gospel 
but Jon should be a very reliable source.

Anyone else know anything about this?

From: drozt@comm.mot.com (Peter Drozt)
Subject: My First Porsche


Ever since I was about 9 years old I wanted a 911; now I think I am
finally in the position to buy one.  Since I just completed graduate
school over the weekend, what better present could I give myself?

Anyway, I've spent a lot of time lurking here, and have collected a
lot of advice.  I even padded my Christmas list with a lot of the
books and magazine that I've seen suggested here.  (I just hope Santa
thinks I was good this year.)

After putting together all the information that I've learned so far,
I decided that the ideal car that I was looking for is a black '83
911SC with black leather interior and front and rear spoilers. However,
being in the Chicago area, there doesn't appear to be too many cars
currently for sale.  (I assume that most of them are in hibernation and
will be out again in the spring.)

So in my relatively short amount searching I've come across an '86 911
Turbo.  It is white with a blue interior.  Although I'd prefer a 
different color, this is a turbo.  When I called the dealer selling
the call, the person with which I talked didn't know too much about it
except that it was "fast, very fast".  But I did also learn that it has
about 80K miles, has a new clutch, they fixed "sticking values", and they're
asking about $25K for it.  Unfortunately, the car is also up in Milwaukee,
but they said that they'll send me photo of the car along with more
information.  (Since I'm not convinced that this is the ideal car for
me, I figure I can wait; otherwise, I'm sure I would have been heading
for Milwaukee soon after I hung up the phone.)

Obviously one of the first things I need to decide is how big of
a budget I can set for my purchase and more specifically what I
want.  But in the meantime, I have the following questions:

1. How does an '80-'83 SC compare with an '84-'89 Carrera in terms of
   maintenance, performance, handling, ergonomics, comfort, etc.?
   What would be the benefit be of a turbo?

2. What kind of reliability can I expect?  How big of deal is the
   "sticking value" problem which was fixed on the '86?  Is this
   a symptom of more serious problems to come?  Are turbos more
   prone to problems?

3. In general, what kind of routine maintenance is required for a
   Porsche?  How much of my budget should I set aside for this?
   How much extra maintenance and expense is there for a turbo?

4. How much should I expect to spend in insurance?  Since I'm only
   26, I expect it might be high.  But since it won't be my daily
   driver, I hope it will be reasonable.  How much extra would
   insurance be for a turbo?

5. Since I don't intend to race this car, is a turbo really that
   useful?  Would I really notice a difference in normal street
   driving?

6. As I attempt to define my ideal car, what sort of things should
   I consider?  Is there any book that I can look at to find out
   what sort of options and features were available for each year?

7. Once I do find a car, I intend to have a pre-purchase inspection
   done by a Porsche certified mechanic.  What should I expect to
   done is such and inspection and how much should I expect to
   pay for one?  Can anyone recommend a good place in the west or
   northwest suburbs of Chicago?

8. Is there anyone in the Milwaukee area that would like to look
   at the '86 turbo and maybe save me the trip from Chicago?

I'm sure this is only the beginning of many more questions to
come, so I'll appreciate any advice or suggestions that you can
provide in general.  I hope I'm at least asking the right questions
as I begin my search.

        Funny you should asked this, I just got an alarm installed by

top end stereo sound in 911's, I always thought it couldn't be done (done to 
engine noise, and wind noise from Targa top).  He's convinced me otherwise, sez 
he'll invite me back to listern to a customer's car (911). He has a system where
he mounts 10" subwoofers "over: the back seat (I don't think he has to 
cut)...and then build "pods" of the midrange and tweeter up front.

     2 areas that frequently start leaking are;

    1. Cam seals; these are not terribly hard to replace, but if you replace
       your timing belt at the same time that job gets expensive (like $500).
       If you don't know when your timing belt was replaced last, you may want
       to....you won't have engine damage if your belt slips or breaks, but
       you might avoid being stranded on a lonesome highway or (probably)
       on a date...
        You can replace the seals without completely removing the belt,
       removing the belt requires taking off the crank pulley, magnesium fan,
       shrouding, and (in my case) the radiator (to get the crank pulley off).
       Replacing the cam seals requires mostly just removal of the plastic
       covers, taking off the cam gears, and slipping in the seals.

    2. Pan leaks; for some reason, the 6mm bolts just seem to work loose.
       This is easy, just get underneath the car and start tightening.
       Use green or blue Locktite if you want. This probably -isn't- the main
       source of your leak.

       There isn't much similarity between 911s and 928s (except for the
      color of the oil they leak) so I'd avoid the mechanic that wants to
      suggest a 911 problem on your car...

In response to Peter Diffey's comments about an intermitant failure on the 
road. 

Check both the DME and Fuel pump relays in the post 1980 924s and 944s. 
While the 924 does not have DME, the fuel/ignition interlock is very similar
and uses the same relays.

These aren't strictly electrical relays. These have current limiting devices
and some electronics added. I have found that the electronic portion, having
real transitors or FETs has some failure modes that are intermittant until 
full failure of on of the devices. These relays are identified on the 
electrical schematic with the outline of a transistor, either on the device 
or next to its outline on the drawing. 

One other failure mode is a bad contact on the electrical portion of the 
ignition switch. this is a pain because the steering column on the 
earlier cars must be disassembled. I haven't done a later (85 1/2 on)
car yet.

Hello pfiles,

 Thought you might like to hear what happen to me last week. Well, it all
started when my *TEENAGERS* were playing basketball in the front driveway
around 6:00 PM when I was coming home from work.

 RULE #1 When dads car is home,Garage must be closed when playing basketball.

As soon as I pulled into the garage and shut off the car, the kids pull down
the garage door. (I'm thinking... "I finally got them trained").
When dinner was ready, they came in and I asked, "Did you guys put the
basketball away".(they have been leaving it on the front lawn lately)
Yea dad, "its in the garage". The next morning I warmed up the porsche and
just started to back out of the garage when I felt something strange.It felt
like my handbrake was on. I looked at it, but it was laying flat. I thought that
something must be behind the wheel so I got out and looked behind the back
wheels. I looked down and saw *OIL* pouring out on the garage floor.I screamed
F**K and ran back to turn the engine off. Once the engine was off I looked under
the car and saw a basketball wedged between the oil hose and the oil tank and
when I backed up, the basketball pulled OFF the hose. By the time I found a 
container to put underneath the car I had a black river in my garage. After I
got the black basketball out and put the hose back on I drained the remaining
oil. (I wasn't sure how much I lost) and put a new filter on.
NOW WHERE ARE THOSE KIDS!!!!!!

I am also looking, so I looked around a bit.

The Interstate batteries may be available directly from your interstate
dealer in your area, look in the white pages under Interstate or Yellow pages
under Batteries. If you have a business it may be easier to get him to sell
direct to you, but it's worth a shot. I haven't gotten a proce yet.

I was at Sears today and they have a group 42 battery that should work, but
it is $60 like the ones in Pano (DECA?). Also it has ridges on the sides
which may have to be cut off to fit, and a handle that will probably not fit
in the battery boxes.

Subject:  911 Headlights (and T*d)

On 911 headlights...

I've noticed that the light output on my '85 911 is markedly better than
the rest of the fleet, so I pulled a trim ring to see if I had non-OEM
lights from the prior owner...err, "NOT EXACTLY"???

It's a sealed beam, but it looks like it has a halogen bulb in there as
opposed to ye-old-fashioned American (exposed element) style.  Was this
a legal setup in 1985?

Hmm...to the catalogs...what-a-mess!  Let me see if I have this correct:

1.  There's "OEM", whatever that is
    (probably old-style sealed beam?)

2.  There's "maybe OEM" which may be what I have
    (ie, a halogen bulb INSIDE a sealed beam)

3.  Catalog has something that looks and sounds like #2, above
    (Catalog says "legal...200% more light"; ~$30)

4.  Then, a (Euro?) halogen assembly that probably requires new trim rings?
    (H1, H4 bulb, over $100)

5.  Finally, there's the 993-style assembly...nice, but $300 each (ouch!)


Mixed in here somehow is a headlight 'cage' assembly that's to make
something (the halogen light, probably #4?) become a 'drop-in'???


I'm not standing completely in the dark, but...OK...who's been through
this mess before and what's the skinny?  Which need new trim rings?
Which don't?  Primed vs. Chrombed?  What other questions should I be asking?


Thanks,

Subject: Re: Re: 951 control arm bargains

If you are going to replace the control arm make sure you use, at least, the
Turbo/S control arm as it is MUCH stronger. They are more expensive and the
ball joints are no better but the arm will not fracture with normal use.
I find it hard to believe that 50mm sway bars were used on any 951. That's
20mm larger than the turbo cup unit. My quick math tells me that 50mm is
about 2" in diameter.

Subject: Re: 951 Control Arms/failing

To answer Jim's question about breaking control arms on 951's:

I have been doing track events/racing with some variation of the 951 since
1987. Before that I has a 944 that was tracked. I put allot of track miles on
my cars per year and have never had a control arm fail or have seen one fail.
However I have gone thru a number of ball joints. They usually let you know
they are failing with increased play and/or noise in the form of a clunking
sound.
When I inspect my car before a track event I pay particular attention to the
ball joints. If they are loose I whip the control arm out of the car and send
it to European Dynamics for replacement of the ball joint. They have a method
that seems to work ALTHOUGH one of their replacements has failed also.
Recently I have heard that even the 951/S control arms can actually break. I
have heard they fracture across the area of the sway bar bushing hole.
I suspect with the advent of better tires (I use BFG R1's) we are putting
increasing greater loads on suspension components.
As a result I am checking out my car very carefully. I have recently sent my
spindles out to be crack checked for instance.
The fabcar parts are getting increasingly attractive although I am not sure
they are legal in the stock class of PCA racing.
Hope this helps. I would be glad to hear input from others

Subject: Re: 944 wheels and tires

The answer to that question is determined by the purpose of the car. If the
car is to be run in a stock class in PCA racing then you can only use one
inch bigger wheel that that which originally came with the car.
In this case the car came originally with 7 x 16 in the front and 9 x 16  in
the back assuming the M30 option. 
The ideal setup would then be 8 x 16 in the front and 10 x 17 in the back.
That allows the use of 245's in the front and 275's in the back which is all
you can cram under the stock fenders. Remember no bodywork can be modified in
stock classes.
If you are planning to run in modified or prepared classes they you have
opened a can of worms that I can't answer with any authority. I do know guys
that use 315's in the back in the modified classes.

When I bought my 911, it had about a $2500 system in it. I remember describing

then dropping as I shift.  Sigh. I need to go have a driving fix....

     I think Porsche put sh*tty stereos in our cars for those reasons. The
reception is so lousy that you don't turn it on and if someone does steal
it...well, the joke's on them. BTW, the stock mono radio with the twisty knob

Can't speak for George, but around here a "good" conversion is at least a
$6k investment, a "correct" conversion (using original 914-6 oil tank, 
etc -- NOT the right way to do a "street ride") is about $10k, and if
you want to build an SCCS GT-2 legal 914-6 race car, that's more like $85k
including a $40k racing engine with state of the art EFI and some spares...

Of course, these are "retail" prices for a "done deal" conversion. You drive
in with a car, and about two months later, drive out with a car with 
the conversion all done.

If you can do some of your own work, it'll be higher...

I haven't actually taken a hacksaw to one, but it's GOT to be a rising
rate regulator. These devices raise fuel pressure based on changes in
manifold pressure (just like the 914 D-Jet!) to effect more flow in
high demand situations. Microdynamics used to make such a beast for about
$350.

Subject: Re: 951 Control Arms/failing


Correct me if I am wrong.  I believe that all aluminum control arms are
the same, and there is no strength difference between the aspiro,
turbo, and S/M030 parts.  There are differences in the hardness of
the bushings used.

With respect to failures at the sway bar pick-up, Nathan Ulrich observed
that he has seen them only on cars which have gone to substantially
larger sway bars without also increasing the coil-over spring rate.
Since you really want to set basic suspension springing with the
coil springs, using the sway bars to fine-tune, that sort of mode ought
not to be a big issue.

Especially if you play at the track, my feelings are that you ought to
replace and not refurbish the control arms.  I say this not knowing
exactly what the process is that people are using to replace the
ball joint.  My understanding is that the arm is a forged piece, and
that the original ball joint is peened into it.  That being the case,
I'd like to know exactly how a new ball joint is being fixed in place.
(I bought myself one arm last year, if "dues paying" is important!)

Checking the ball joint condition is straightforward.  With a large pair
of pipe wrench pliers, place one jaw under the ball, the other on top
of the clamp nut which secures the ball joint shaft.  Squeeze the pliers
together, which compresses the joint.  If you see more than a mm.
or so of free play, it's time.  Porsche does not publish a spec for
the wear limit, althought Puhn says that other manufacturers do.

Lots.

Lots more if you can't make up your mind and buy the wrong parts
the first time (BT,DT).

IMHO (someone correct me if you see something wrong):

1) Learn how to drive your car

2) Buy 911 brakes.  I've seen 911 Carrera front ends for $850 or so.
19mm master cylinder ($100), rears are a pain....I have 911 stub
axles and hubs with 914/6 rotors ($400???)

3) Buy a set of wheels and tires to match the 911 bolt pattern ($800???)

4) Re-learn how to drive your car.

5) Now it may be safe to install the 911 engine.  You have now spent
about $2150 and are ready to begin.

You'll need:

    Oil tank ($450)
    Headers ($300) or heat exchangers ($800 - used)
    Muffler ($75 used)
    Motor mount ($250) or make yourself ($20)
    Tach ($50)
    Oil pressure/temperature guage ($50)
    Oil lines ($?)
    Shift linkage (make yourself $20)
    Early 911 clutch ($300)
    911 engine (2.0 - 2.7) - a 3.x engine would mean a slightly different 
list
        What do you want to spend?  $1500 for a dying engine or $9000 for
        a rebuilt 2.7 RS spec engine????
    Engine sheet metal ($400)
    Suspension mods to suit your taste and driving requirements
        ($100 - $600+ for street; easily $1500 and up for track use)
    All the labour costs to do this ($?)

6) Re-learn how to drive your car again

So, to do this "cheap" but still "right" (ie buy the brakes FIRST),
then you could probably look forward to $4000 plus the cost of
the 2.x engine and labour.

Of course this doesn't cover the 3.x engines, race stuff, "handy"
things like short shift kits, etc.  I wrote the above for street use and
I probably forgot stuff.

You could always buy cheaper parts somewhere and get cheap
labour, but be very careful....quite often you get what you pay for.

The actual task of installing everything isn't that bad.  My factory
tank (not good for the street, Stan???) required a few holes to be
drilled in the engine compartment.  That was the "roughest" part
of the conversion - drilling the holes correctly.  Everything else
just bolts together if you have the right parts.  Your last bit of
fiddling would occur with the shift linkage but some companies
offer pre-made pieces to make this easier.

Yup.  Works.  For the specific problem that they sell it for.  E.g.,
here in Monterey it is sort of 55-60 degrees year round (thanks Pacific
Ocean), I drive to work in the AM, by the PM the engine was cold enough
to want cold start enrichment, but not cold enough to close the factory

There just isn't enough room in the wheel well if tire is allowed a free

you may be better off, especially if its a race car with coil-overs.

Well, I've gotten a few answers to my question (a really burning P-car 
issue, of course), namely:

Is the speedster in the new Janet Jackson video a real Porsche? Well...

From: "Jim Bauman  jbauman@btr.com" <jbauman@btr.btr.com>
I think it's real -- it looked a bit beat up, and didn't it have an
old style California plate? I'd have to see it again....

From: norrid@rpi.edu (Daniel Norris-Jones)
Could be wrong, but I thought the 356 was a 356C convertible, not a speedster,
because it had twin grilles on the engine lid.

From: uo14@freenet.victoria.bc.ca (Eric R. Cherneff)
I've seen the video (mute buttons come in handy) and the car is a T6
Cabrio I believe. Going from memory, I think it had the body coloured
window frame (if it was chrome it would be a Roadster or a cabrio
butchered to look like a Speedster). Check the dash- if it has three large
guages in a row, it definitely began life as a coupe or cab. Butchery of
the lower cost coupes and cabrios to look like speedsters is becoming
increasingly common. I can say with absolute certainty that the car is NOT
a Speedster.

   ------

So, it appears that the car *isn't* a Speedster, but is a Porsche. If 
anyone regularly subjects themselves to MTV (or has teenagers), and can 
add some more light on this very important matter (c'mon, lunch at McD's 
is riding on this, and I'm the loser so far - I thought the car was a 
clone-kit-car, 'cause it didn't look right to me - and I couldn't imagine 
anyone cutting a coupe or roadster - yuck), please e-mail me. Thanks for 
your replies!

Best of the season,
Craig.

I just replaced a sealed beam halogen in our 89 Range Rover.  Yup, they're

On 911 headlights...

I've noticed that the light output on my '85 911 is markedly better than
the rest of the fleet, so I pulled a trim ring to see if I had non-OEM
lights from the prior owner...err, "NOT EXACTLY"???

It's a sealed beam, but it looks like it has a halogen bulb in there as
opposed to ye-old-fashioned American (exposed element) style.  Was this
a legal setup in 1985?

Hmm...to the catalogs...what-a-mess!  Let me see if I have this correct:

1.  There's "OEM", whatever that is
    (probably old-style sealed beam?)

2.  There's "maybe OEM" which may be what I have
    (ie, a halogen bulb INSIDE a sealed beam)

3.  Catalog has something that looks and sounds like #2, above
    (Catalog says "legal...200% more light"; ~$30)

4.  Then, a (Euro?) halogen assembly that probably requires new trim rings?
    (H1, H4 bulb, over $100)

5.  Finally, there's the 993-style assembly...nice, but $300 each (ouch!)


Mixed in here somehow is a headlight 'cage' assembly that's to make
something (the halogen light, probably #4?) become a 'drop-in'???


I'm not standing completely in the dark, but...OK...who's been through
this mess before and what's the skinny?  Which need new trim rings?
Which don't?  Primed vs. Chrombed?  What other questions should I be asking?


Thanks,

 -Hugh

Another key giveaway: there is a scene where someone is shown turning
the ignition key. It's a flat panel mounted key, not an on-the-column
key. Since the 356 has a left dash panel mounted key, and *ALL* of the 
kit cars I've seen have VW column-mounted keys, I take that as a clue.

And, BTW, a clear indication that the one on 90210 is a fake...

Let's start with some definitions:

"these things" -- I'll talk about rising rate regulators, not the Power Box.

My current perspective is that I don't really know what's in the Box,
I've probably pissed off the vendor by this point given my posts on 
this topic over the last 8 months, so I'm not likely to get an eval
unit. And since I think it's overpriced for what I think it is, that's 
probably OK too..

Do they damage the car? NO and in fact can keep you from damaging the
car if you need more fuel at high RPM. YES if you mean make it not
be concours....

Are they hard to install?  Not on a normal car, but for the 911 where all
the interesting bits of the CIS are in a hard to get to location unless
you drop the engine (that is, if you're built like me...), you milage
will vary. For most, you replace the stock pressure regulator on the side
of the fuel distributor. 

What kind of performance increase? Well, it depends on the rest of the
car... There is no silver bullet, there is not magic dust. All power
gains are hard-fought. In my car, that plus a few other things took a
stock Euro 911SC from a nominal 205 HP to about 260. *MOST* of that was
in the "few other things" but *NONE* of it would have been possible
without tweaking the fuel system.

Screwing up gas milage, well, your milage may vary... When you're driving
"normal" for a normal person, no, you can't tell it's there. When you're
driving "normal" for *ME*, you need a gallons per hour meter. Then again
I'd do stuff like drive the freeways in 3rd, so you can't use me for a
real example...

Asking too many questions? What? About cars??? Naaaaahhh. No such thing...

Hmm.  I think I spend most of my time on freeways split between third
and fourth, depending on which freeway and what traffic is like when I
get on.

I'd like to know how other people drive around town most of the time.  When
I got the car, I was informed that running the car at low RPMs in anything
but first (and presumably reverse) could be worse for the engine than
running it above redline.  Given that advice, I spend most of my time
driving around town in 2nd, and even downshifting into 1st if I have to
start accelerating from about 10-15mph.  Has anyone else either been told
this or come across it the hard way, or was the previous owner just trying
to make me downshift more often than I'd like to?

Don't fporget that the initial batch of 951S control arms were
defective and replaced by PCNA.  If you are getting one used make sure
it isn;t one of these.  PCNA or your local dealer should be able to
supply casting stamp-dates.

I did not realize you worked for Hal. Did not mean to ruffle any  
feathers. But was just playing on the Pentium story and the movie 2001.
 
Picture this, one Pentium chips gets misplaced and then found in the next 
century. And ends up replacing a corrected one in mission critical application.
Would make a great movie. Maybe Arlnold coud starr it!

Take care!

Tony:

My best advice for you regarding buying your first Porsche is don't flop 
for the first car you see or drive.  Take your time to find the right 
car--be patient.  

There are plenty of 86 or 87 944's out there that 
neurotic owners have babied.  For example, my 87 944 S spent its entire 
life in a carpeted garage under a cover snuggled between a few other 
sports cars.  I paid only a couple thousand more for this car than I 
would have for a comparable year car that had been an everyday driver 
with 80,000 or 90,000 on it.  

Also, be prepared to shell out money.  Especially buying an older car, 
don't be surprised to get some big repair bills.  If you can't afford to 
drop an occassional $500 or $1000 or more, don't get the car (unless you 
are a good mechanic and can fix it yourself).

Hi John, I have a 71T too. The red lever on the dashboard controls the
DIRECTION of the HOT air. move the lever toward the driver and the air goes
down to the floor vents, move it right toward the passenger side and the hot
air goes up to the front window vents. The blue lever just above the red one
does the same for the COLD air. The top lever controls the VOLUME cold air.
All the way toward the driver shuts off all cold air, move it more toward
the passenger side and it lets in some cold air, move to the I, II or III
and it starts up the fan. To control the volume of HOT air, you use the red
lever down by the handbrake. All the way down shuts off the hot air, up lets
it in.

Subject: Metric bolt grades

Hi, Stephen.
 
Metric bolt grades --
 
Old 356s often have bolts marked 8G or 10G. This is a superseded
classification system. The modern equivalents are 8.8 and 10.9. There is
also a 12.9 . You'll find the higher numbers in more critical locations --
brakes, suspension, etc. These are higher strength. The 8.8 is a common
ordinary bolt used just about anywhere. 8.8 is equivalent to about SAE Grade
5. 10.9 is about like SAE Grade 8. 12.9 is "8-plus".
 
Bolt grade does make a difference. I remember while working at Porsche we
had an engine on the dyno that used to keep shaking its flywheel loose. We
went to 12.9 allen head bolts, tightened to higher torque, and the problem
(and associated fretting corrosion between flywheel and crank) stopped.
 
According to Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners & Plumbing Handbook, 8.8
and 9.8 are medium carbon steel, quenched and tempered. 10.9 is medium
carbon steel with additives such as boron, manganese or chromium, or other
alloy steel, either way quenched and tempered. 12.9 is alloy steel, quenched
and tempered.
 
The first figure gives 1/100 of the nominal tensile strenght in N/mm^2. The
second number is 10x the ratio between nominal yield stress (when the thing
stretches and becomes unusable) and nominal tensile strength (when it
breaks). Multiply the numbers ahead of the decimal point by the numbers
behind it and you magically get 1/10 of the nominal yield strength in
N/mm^2. Example: 8.8 bolt has 800 N/mm^2 tensile strength, .8 of that is
nominal yield strength, or .8 x 800 = 640 N/mm^2. Or 8 x 8 = 64, 1/10 of the
nominal yield strenth.
 
The 12.9 by contrast has a UTS (ultimate tensile strength) of 1200 N/mm^2,
and yield strenght is closer to ultimate strength (relatively speaking)
than in an 8.8 bolt, being 90 percent of UTS, or 1080 N/mm^2. Yes, they're
more brittle (yield is closer to ultimate strength) but they're nearly 70
percent stronger.
 
Conversion factor: 1 n/mm^2 = 145.037 lbs/in^2. So that 12.9 bolt will yield
at a stress of about 157,000 psi. That's one strong bolt, about the same
strength as many of the NAS series (National Aerospace Standard) bolts, which
are 160,000 psi. Aircraft industry "superbolts," like NAS 624 through 644,
are 180,000 psi.
 
That's why you should never use 8.8s in an application that calls for 12.9
or even 10.9. If you torque it like the book says, it might already be
plastically deformed, never mind what happens when you start putting a
cyclic load on it. Not good for things like brake calipers, brake hats,
suspension arms...

  Greetings -

  Could someone explain what leakdown is?  Compression testing is pretty
  obvious, but I have no idea what a leakdown test is.  Also, how does one
  test for leakdown and on that topic, compression as well?  I'm not
  looking at doing these tests in the near future, just curious...

This is a little off the Ptrack but I am reasonably sure that I read in

I don't see how it could hurt, but my 2.0L engine with 250K Miles on the
case and 2.4L engine with 200K on the case have never pulled a steel stud.

I plan on timeserting my 2.0L when I rebuild it to 2.2L, but
this might be overkill.

Even bought the TimeSert kit on a visit to the TimeSert factory when it
was in LA.   

>Should you use them with 3.0 and 3.2 engines?

No real experience with this, but I'd say Bruce Anderson's book
gave a strong recommend to using them in any rebuild.

>When you use them, should you use the large (14x2?) or small
>(12.5x1.5)?  I know of at least 1 machine shop that swears by using

Does this machine shop usually do VW cases?

These inserts do not appear to be true TimeSerts, but more likely VW case 
inserts with different thread pitches inside and out.

A true TimeSert must have the same thread pitch inside as out since they 
are constructed similarly to a solid Helicoil.

The "Time" refers to "timed" threads, with the internal thread 
and external thread synchronized.

Here is a poor ASCII drawing. 

               <<   >>
               >>   <<
               <<   >>
               >>   <<

So, for a given internal thread pitch/diameter, the only dimension that varies 
on the TimeSert is the length.

There may be enough material in the 2.0L-2.4L case to tolerate a VW case
insert, but why bother?   The true TimeSert is a more conservative approach
with less metal removed from the case.

Subject: Dual batteries 69-73 911

On the subject of dual batteries in 69-73 911's.

My 69T and 72T both have OPTIMA sealed lead acid gel-cell batteries.

The battery fits on its side in the driver's (left) side battery pocket.

The passenger's side (right side) battery pocket is left empty, an OPTIMA
battery will not fit here due to interference with the spare tire. 

The more recent OPTIMA battery purchase was from 

                          Chatham Motorsports
                          1116 W.43rd
                          Vancouver,WA 98660
                          1-206-693-6720

It totaled $116.87 delivered to Northern California.

Chatham Motorsports is run by Mick and Dawn Michelsen, I placed the
order with Dawn, Mick called back to clarify payment method.  They
advertise in Excellence classified.

They don't take charge cards, but personal checks are fine.

They gave prompt service, as I remember, the time from the
mailing of the check to receipt of the battery was less than 7 days.

Since a leaking battery in a 911 can cause expensive rust problems
in the front suspension mounts, the sealed construction gives me
a (false?) sense of security.

Also, a truly sealed battery like the OPTIMA won't even allow checking 
for water consumption.  I often skipped doing this job with the old
batteries.  Now I have a solid reason to NOT check.

After 3 years in the 69T, the battery developed a small white deposit on the
positive terminal.  There is no evidence of any fluid leaking.

The battery protrudes from the left side battery box.

I put the ground terminal inside the battery box, the positive terminal
is outside the battery box to get it away from the chassis sheetmetal.

Since the battery is sealed, it can be mounted in any position.

On the 69T, the positive terminal points toward the front, on the 72T, 
I have it pointing to the back.   Pointing toward the back brings the positive
terminal further away from the chassis sheetmetal.

On both cars, I needed a longer ground strap, but the positive
lead length was fine.  I disconnected and removed the + lead to the second
battery.  

I brazed up a new mounting strap.  It was about 3" longer than the stock strap,
but it is easy to braze the inner hoop end first, trial fit the strap by 
creating a loop at the clamp end, and then braze on the other end after 
trial clamping. 

They also sell a 6v version, it is only three cells and physically
is the same height and length of the 12V, but 1/2 the width.

Subject: Help! Cold 911

Fellow Porschephiles,

My '74 Carrera runs very cool during the Winter. It takes at least fifteen
minutes to warm up to 120 degrees and it basically won't get any hotter. In
fact, even in the summertime it runs at about 180 degrees at highway speeds.
Of course, 180 is within the 180-210 degree normal operating temperature
range, but 120 is certainly not!

Is it likely that my oil cooler thermostat is stuck open?

Could I be exposing my engine to excessive wear by driving the car with
a fairly cold engine?

By the way, the gauge and sender are new and I'm using Mobil 1 15W-50 which
supposedly flows well even at low temperatures. Also, the car has no
supplementary oil cooler, just the engine cooler.

At just what oil temperature is the engine oil cooler thermostat
supposed to open?

PS- The 930, like most blown cars, doesn't seem to have a problem getting
plenty warm.

Many thanks,

Hey Bob,

I have a '73 911T (also 2 battery) that had the batteries go south last

I had to insulate off the terminals for the unconnected battery and

Bruce,

Thanks for the guidance.  Once I replaced the injector "O" rings and cleaned
the injectors with contact cleaner the engine starts on the first try and
doesn't have that annoying misfire.  Had to reset the idle screw up a bit
when warm(from 500 rpm to roughly 900-1000 rpm). What a difference!!!

The injectors for the cylinders that weren't running(#5 and #6) were easy 
to take out, the rest were a real pain. "O" rings were hard and flattened.

Cold start seems to be working great.  On 25 - 32 degree mornings, engine
starts on roughly the 3rd or 4th revolution, stumbles a bit, then revs up 
to 2 grand.  Seems kind of high compared to my Euro model's 1600 rpm.

I used to have an 85.1 944 and every now and then (maybe twice per year) it
would almost die.  If I revved it really high it would stay alive, but it was
very scary getting home. (One time I had the wife and baby in the car in the

After a few years of this I realized a common factor: the problem was only in
the winter, and only on the coldest of winter days.

I concluded that something in the fuel delivery must be icing, so I started
putting dry gas into the tank, and voila! no more problem.


If you can remember the Naked City, you recall that New York has 7 million
residents, each with his own story, so your 944 may die for a different
reason, but anyway this the reason that my 944 would die.

Subject: Attention Hofco alarm owners


The transmitter for my Hofco alarm died recently (I guess dropping
it on the pavement didn't help :-) ), and the local Porsche dealer
told me about someone who fixes them. He did a great job on mine,
so I thought I'd pass his information along to the list.

His name is Ron, he calls his company Ronel Systems, and he can
fix most xmitter problems for a flat fee of $15. If the problem
turns out to be more serious than a dead component or two, he'll
contact you and discuss what it would take to fix it.

So, if you have a dead Hofco handheld unit, put it in a padded
bag and send it with a check for US$15 to:

	Ronel Systems
	P.O. Box 70776
	Sunnyvale, CA 94086

If you want to ask him any questions, his phone number is 
(408) 370-0100.

Nice to have my alarm working again!

Those of you who think it's cute to suggest different ways 
to maim or kill cats who walk on your precious Porsches may 
wish to consider three things:

1. It isn't in the least amusing.

2. It doesn't help the person who was looking for a humane 
way to prevent scratched car paint.

3. Since you know full well that Stan and his wife just lost
a cat that had been dear to them for 12 years (and just a few
months after the unexpected death of another of their cats),
perhaps you could keep your immature "humor" to yourselves out 
of respect for the person whose hard work makes this mailing 
list not only possible but a friendly, helpful place to hang

Subject:       I Need Wheels

The latest chapter in my ongoing wheel hell has just unfolded.

Last week I bought a set of somewhat beat-up 6x15 Fuchs wheels from
my mechanic for $350 (seemed like a good price, given that the retail 
places want $200 each for used wheels).  I took them home and 
cleaned them up, and they looked OK.

Today I took them in to have tires mounted.  The guy calls me at work
to tell me that the wheels require tubed tires.  He said I might be
able to get them machined to take a stem, but I don't want to open
that can of worms.  So I am out of luck, again. The mechanic will
take them back (he's selling them for another customer who owes him
money), but I am once again without a viable set of wheels.

So I am now looking for a set of 6" or 7" by 15" Fuchs silver spoke 
wheels.  I would prefer to buy from someone in the San Francisco Bay 
area--I am not about to get into another pig-in-a-poke deal if I can 
help it.  I'd like to pay less than $200 a wheel--if I wanted to do 
that I'd go to High Performance House.  I don't need anything like 
concours quality finish, just a set of viable, straight wheels.

Please help.  Respond by email (krid@unix.sri.com) or phone 
(415.903.9660).

Thanks,
Dirk

Subject: 911 search humor

While looking for a new-to-me 911, I ran across this one in the paper:

1986 Carrera,  guards red, alarm, leather  $27,000

Turned out it was at a _High_ end used car reseller (his indoor lot had newer
Jags, a Land Rover Discovery, a "Rambo" Lambo LM5, a Ferrari 348, and a bunch
of Porsches.

I go to look at the '86, it has the black Fuch style rims, black leather, bra,
heated sports seats, 78K miles, tow previous owners, sunroof coupe, a fiarly
nice nakamichi stereo and an alarm of some sort.  No modifications from
stock.  No accidents.  Records from 1988 (2nd owner).  Paint was about what
you'd expect for an 8 year old car, no oxidation, but some chips in the hood,
a slight dent in the engine cover.

I drove it around the block, the sales critter wanted to close up.  I brought
it back in and the humorous conversation ensued:

me:  "Say how long have you had this car here?"
sc:  "close to 60 days now."
me:  "I see, how firm are you on the price?"
sc:  "Why are you thinking about dealing tonight?"
me:  "Well, possibly.  I'd like to drive it a bit further, and get it in all
     gears.  But your price seems to be about $8 grand too high."
sc:  "Sorry, no deal.  You might get it for $26,500, not for $19,000"
me:  "I've seen newer cars for less, 1988 targa 55K miles for $25.900...
sc:  "Oh, well Targa's are a completely different category of car, much less
     desirable than the sunroof coupe."
me:  "Uhh, yeah, right.  I notice you don't have any Targa's here.  How much
     for that 1992 C2?"
sc:  "That's a nice one, I think we're asking $50,000"
me:  "Alright.   Good night.  Thanks for letting me look at your cars."
(start to leave)
sc:  "Would you like me to call you tomorrow after talking over your offer on
     the Carrera with the boss?"
me:  (walking out still) "No thanks, good luck selling it at 27."
sc:  (just not getting it) "How about the C2?"
me:  (gone)

- ----------------------------

That dealer was nuts right?  I've seen turbo look '86's for less.  Cab's too.
I pity the fool that parts with their money at that place.....

P-philes - 

Is there anybody out there who can tell me what
the avg. retail is on a 1966 911.  I know it
depends alot on the condition, but a rough
estimate will do.

I haven't seen the car, but from what I've heard
the car is in original non-restored condition,
is stored in a garage (sounds like it's been
there for a while), it runs, and probably has
some rust.

Any other insight on this year car would be
appreciated.

Might go next week to take a look. Sounds interesting.

you send the person the correct address instead of forwarding it to

This prevents Stan from getting multiple messages for the same person

Patty:  1. Some of the comments are amusing.  Don't think either of us is 
qualified to be the humor arbiter for the masses.  Your reaction to the  dead 
cat humor smacks of political correctness, something we don't need more of.  
There are I've noted, humorous books in the best bookstores about "How to kill 
a cat", various "roadkill" humor stories and jokes, etc. so lighten up.  
	2. Perhaps these comments don't help provide a solution but  for those 
of us who are tired of dealing with cat hairs, cat lunch residue and misc. cat 
body fluids in addition to scratches they may provide some release of 
frustration thru humor that may ultimately save some kitty from lead poisoning. 
	3. I'm sure that all of us sympathize with Stan.  We have a very old 
cat that we will greatly miss when she goes. Perhaps though you've forgotten 
about opc's (other peoples cats).  There are no leash laws for cats.  They 
roam freely in most environs and have little respect for property or other 
wild life i.e. birds,rabbits, squirrels, etc. A few years ago I had to leave a 
Pcar outside for lack of garage space.  Stray cats took up residence so I 
bought a car cover to protect it.  They turned the car cover into a scratching 
post and shredded it.  I sprayed cat retardent on the cover, they shredded 
more.  I escalated, finally solved  the problem  but won't risk your 
sensitivities by telling you how.  Moral is that some cats are pests, 
especially if they're not yours.  So frustration leads to humor, I think 
there's room for that...Immature humor?  Hey, that comes with the testosterone.

    P-philers,
    
    I would like the proper procedure for a leak down/compression test and 
    the passing specifications for a 914-4 2.0.  I have a pitted valve stem 
    that needs replacement, and if the leak down/compression test is weak, 
    I may tear down the engine (and increase pressure on the pocketbook) at 
    the same time.
    
    Also, somebody please print the saga of T*d.  As a new p-philer, this 
    thread is going over my head and "Enquiring Minds want to Know."  It 
    sounds hilarious. Shipping the trophy might get expensive if a non 49

Oh, I look for that sort of stuff... And in general, they haven't done
anything patently stupid, such as the twin-grill "Speedster" in "Tales

using the "classic American" technique: left hand on steering wheel,

Can't do that in a 356. Unless your arms are an extra 3 feet long and

Subject: 951 Engine Block Problem

I own a 944 turbo which is promarily used on the track.   Last July, while
using the car at Watkins Glen the engine began to develop a
rod knock when hot & over 4000 rpms.

After disassembly of the engine it was dicovered that the infamous #2 rod
bearing spun damaging the crankshaft (note: the bearing had been replaced
around 75k miles, now has 94k).   I was able to easily locate a crank and
piston set with low low miles.   Upon further disassembly I discovered the #2
cylinder wall was lightly scored (can feel with finger nail but not with
finger tip).

Any suggestions??  Sleeving the block has been suggested???  Reassembling it
as is has been considered, knowing it will burn oil, but how much??   Has
anyone installed steel sleeves (liners) in a 944 block and have any history
of use??

Subject: 2.2 Ps & Cs, transaxle

The engine for my 71 911E 2.2 liter is still in hock at the machinist's,
but I hope to have it out by mid-January.  I think I've been talked into
going for new piston$ and cylinder$, and am leaning toward the original
ones (for an E), but the machinist mentioned that I could alternatively
use the ones from a T.  This would lower the price few $100 and the
compression ratio from about 9.5-to-1 to about 8.5-to-1.  Given that my
engine was originally designed for leaded gas which is no longer
available, should I give it a break and go for the lower-compression
option, or should I keep it original and go for performance?  Any tips
of what brands of Ps and Cs to use or avoid?

My synchros are gone - how hard are they to replace? I would really like
to take care of this while the motor's out if it's not too big of a job.
Should I tackle the job myself, or take it to a specialist?
Are there any bearings that are noted for howling when they get old
(pinion bearings)? 

Thanks,

$50K?!? How many miles on it? I know someone who got a '92 C2 coupe, 
brand new, for approx. $55K (maybe 2-3K less, I'm not sure) with 17" 
wheels, maybe limited slip too. I think he got a great deal, though.

For $27K, or maybe 2-3K more, I would think you can get a '86 or '87 930. 
Am I way off? Anyway, you can get a _really_ nice 911 '87-'89 for that much.

My washer bottle stopped giving water to the windshield. After taking 
the bottle away (not that straight forward with corroded bolts etc) 
it appeared to be the strain (filter) at the end of the suction hose 
that was totally clogged with some black "slime". When cleaning the bottle 
lots of this black slime came out. 
 
One question therefore arises. Is it the detergents in the washer bottle 
that is "solving" the plastic? I presume that the chemicals in the 
detergents are not the same today as they were in '82 when the car 
was built. 
 
Does anyone has any simlilar experience??

I certainly have . . . in the little used washer bottle and associated tubing 
in my '73 VW bug.  It turned out to be black algae which thrives in dark, warm 
places.  If you use plain water or very delute "window washer fluid" in your 
washer bottle, this is almost certainly your problem. 
 
Although I was advised that I could use a very weak Chlorox solution to 
eliminate the growth, I was very wary of the effect the bleach might have on 
the plastic over time . . . especially given the age of the bottle. 
 
Instead I opted to clean the bottle with soap and water and replace the 
tubing. This eliminated the problem for several years until it recently 
appeared again  this summer.

If the car has the original MFI, then *DO NOT* do this.I just had
this discussion with someone today who's '72 E wasn't running right.
Made him go check, and sure enough, he has cast iron cylinders (T stuff).
The compression is wrong, the flame front propogation is wrong, and as
a result, the MFI adjustment is wrong. In addition to running poorly
it's waaaaay down on power relative to the normal Es of that vintage.

Folks,

My two cents worth on the rising rate fuel pressure regulator.  At
the risk of stating the obvious, let me point out that by itself
it will do only harm.  The only reason to modulate the fuel
pressure is to modulate (ie, increase at higher RPM's) the fuel
being squirted.  If you modulate the fuel pressure in a stock
engine, you will only either run lean at one end and rich at the
other, and probably both.

IMHO, in the days of programmable ECU's, the rising-rate fuel
pressure regulator is an antique.  Like dicking around with
carb jetting and venturi size, it's a crude and obsolete approach
to engine management.

Of course, coupled with an Autothority throttle body and mass flow
sensor, you may have something!

Just like CIS, right?

Which is, in my opinion, the ONLY time to use it.  I guess I didn't 
make that clear enough.... Oh wait --- you *CAN* use it on L and LH
setups, but they also are obsolete, aren't they?

For a from-scratch, clean-sheet-of-paper approach, the ONLY reasonable
thing to do is to use a programmable setup. Most of us have know that
for a long time, for sure if there's been *ANY* recent racing involvement
of a serious nature. However, reasonable setups for the 911 start at 
$7-10k, and go up from there depending on any special tuning you need. 
I know I used to make at least modest amounts of money tuning EFI for 
racing, and know what that used to do to the total install cost...

For a geeze-what'll-make-my-obsolete-CIS-motor-perform-better (including,
BTW, all 930s until VERY recently), the answer is that you gotta use even
more of that obsolete technology.  Hence old tricks like rising rate 
regulators, injector tuning, recuving the fuel distributor, figuring out
how much cam and compression you can use before the CIS gets upset, etc.

One of the few times you'll catch me disagreeing with Kevin, but there it

I think you might want to think about uploading the file to tta.com (or
putting it on your own server) and then posting a message to p-files that
those who want the file can come and get it. It is somewhat annoying to get
a big file like that when I didn't even want it in the first place. You may

The "real world". What exactly is your definition of the "real world". You

useful work done on my Mac that is obviously so isolated from the "real

I saw that Janet Jackson video again and paid attention to the car. It had
a T6 body and disk brakes, so that would make it a 356C. However, it had a
Speedster windshield, and a coupe/cabrio dash (vs. the Speedster/Roadster
"pod" of instruments). Therefore, there are two possibilities (accepting
that it is a real 356): it was originally a 356C Cab and they cut off the
windshield frame, replacing it with a Speedster windshield, or it was
originally a 356C Coupe and they cut off the roof. Too bad.

As I thought about this, and looked it up, it became clear that on all
early open cars (roadsters, speedsters, Convertible D) the ignition
switch was to the right of the steering column, and a starter button was
used to start the car, also to the right of the steering column.

This continued up to the A series. The familiar key-on-the-left didn't
happen until the T2 body style.

Sheesh. That's twice the month...

 - Use them as a REPAIR for 2.0 to 2.4  (steel studs) and the 3.x

 - Use them with dilivar studs in 2.7 engines all the time (unless you

 - Use the smaller 12.5 x 1.5 size - allows a further repair to be done

Dear Craig,

The new R-134-A freon seems to slip by seals easier than the old R-12 and is
not as efficient.

Replacing components such as the compressor, expansion valve and system seals
is a start. However, everything is still "up-in the-air" to quote several AC
installation specialists I spoke with. Since the manufacture of the old freon
(R-12) will be discontinued some time in the future, many businesses are
hoarding it so it will be available long into the future. The new air
conditioning charging machinery uses a recovery system that saves and cleans
any freon left in the system, hence recharging may not need as much freon as
in the past.

I would not worry about converting any old car's AC system to the new
refrigerant. I am sure there will always be allowances made for R-12 charging
of old AC systems impossible or too expensive to convert to the new R-134-A.

Subject: Leakdown test : answer &question

Howdy,

A leakdown tester forces compressed air into a cylinder which is set to Top
Dead Center with it's valves closed. Usually an air compressor is used as an
air supply, but I have been able to use an air tank filled at the gas
station. There is a pressure regulator which allows some pressure into the
cylinder, and a guage which measures the difference of pressure before and
after the regulator (or something like this). The measurement shows you how
much of the air is leaking out of the cylinder, and is usually a percentage
value.
A high percentage means your cylinder is leaky. Something like 2% would be a
fresh engine. This is a much better test than the standard compression test
which measures the compression pressure under cranking.

Just as important as the percentage leakdown, is finding out WHERE the air is
leaking. This can be determined by listening in various places to hear the
hissing of leaking air. Listen to the exhaust pipe to  check the exhaust
valves. Listen to the intake or air cleaner for intake valve problems. Listen
to the oil filler or crankcase vent to check for leaks into the crankcase
(around the rings). You will always hear a bit in the crankcase, as the rings
leak a little. You should find all cylinders measure about the same leakdown
if all is well.

Now for my question for those with more engine expertise than me :

My cylinder #3 misfires and gets a fouled plug often. The compression has
always tested good. But once I tested leakdown and it was TERRIBLE, leaking
into the crankcase only. I guess it was going through the rings, is there
anything else on a 911 engine that could have caused this leakage? When I
tested the leakdown months later, is was OK.  Any ideas what could be going
on here? What else could I check? I would really appreciate help, as I plan
to compete nationally in Solo-II again and need my power back- now I am about
.5 second slower 0-60 than before my engine went sour in '89.

You will have to pull out the gas tank. Remove the guage sender and look
inside to check the
condition. You can remove some rust inside by putting a clean chain inside
and shaking it. I'm not sure if this will cause more damage than it fixes.
Rinse out the tank. 

Hirsch makes a good coating for tanks that has instructions on how to do
this. You pour some of this milky stuff in the dry clean tank and shake it
around so it gets everywhere. You can repeat the process a few times.
I did it on my '72 S tank a few years ago and it still seems good.

When you reinstall the tank, you probably need new sealing material between
the tank and trunk floor. I used some cheap weatherstripping with one
adhesive side, but the factory style gooey sticky stuff is probably better.

Subject: 944 Suspension Changes


The 944 has just experienced its (and mine) first auto-x and we both made it 
without a scratch, well, almost. I did knock over and ran over a couple of 
cones during the timed runs. It was extremely exciting and I look forward to 
the next event and driver's ed. 

The car behaved great. However, it is very obvious that the tires the car 
currently wears are not at all appropriate.They are Winston's 215-60's ( I 
swear they came with the car) mounted on the stock 15" x 7" wheels. My 
driving instructor made a remark to the effect that he has never seen such 
tire brand on a Porshe car and that I should get rid of them outright or 
wear them out ASAP so new tires can be fitted to the car. I agree. My first 
question is:

1. What tire brand/size would be best suited for Auto-X and daily driving, 
and still fit on the stock wheels?

The car came with the front and rear stabilizer bar factory option. I would 
like to upgrade to larger diameter bars and still use the same mounting 
points. Question two is:

2. What size/brand sway bars should I upgrade to? 

Along with the new sway bars I do plan to replace the shocks with adjustable 
Konis.

BTW, I upgraded to the latest turbo motor mounts this week. It is amazing, 
what a difference! Particularly when I had already gotten used to the 
vibration as part of daily life with a 944! 

Any advice is greatly appreciated,

Subject: Deteriorating washer bottle

 
Hi, Michael and Magnus.
 
I've seen crud like this on various washer bottles over the years. Algae
sounds as good a culprit as any. I remember in Germany Porsche used a very
strong alcohol solution of some sort as washer fluid. I don't think anything
could live in there (except maybe our own Herb Myers :-)  ) I don't know
what alcohol it was; I thought methanol, but does that take paint off? Might
be interesting to try some methanol on a rag in a non-obvious spot like inside
the trunk. This stuff was strong; while it was dissolving bugs or melting ice,
people inside the car also got a good whiff of it. In Germany I think it was
also common to use ethanol (not methanol) which has been made undrinkable so
it's sold as a solvent and fuel, known as "Brennsprirtus."
 
I have in my hot little hands a bottle of Wuerth Scheibenklar ("window
clear") brought from Germany by a friend. Bottle says "all-season windshield
cleaner with antifreeze protection for the windshield washer system...
methanol free, environmentally friendly." This stuff seems intended
primarily as an antifreeze; printing on back emphasizes this. It's thinned
3:1 for protection to -10 deg C, (14 F), straight it gives -30 deg C (-22 F)
protection. Then it gives an ASTM (American Society for Testing of
Materials) number, which I can't look up without going to the local
university, ASTM D1177-65. That's probably the test procedure. It says
"harmless to paint and rubber...methanol free...flammable." Why does it
emphasize "methanol free" twice, unless maybe that's what other, less
environmentally aware <g> solutions employ?

Nope, we agree.  I wasn't clear enough in my post, which is what happens
when I read mail after a Christmas party...  My point was that diddling the
fuel pressure in and of itself with an otherwise stock engine is a waste of
time, money, and the engine.

Yes, if you start playing with turbocharged cars, esp. CIS engines and 
others
without knock sensors, you are going to need enrichment.  And there are
lots of other mod's you can do which will require diddling the fuel rates. 
 The
RRPR is one solution, depending.  Most modified CIS turbos are happy
with a simpler, cheaper solutions.  (Jerry and Bill at the shop came up
with one which is so simple and effective that I want to kick myself.  Helps
a bunch of 930's, the 924 GTS, and seems to work better than the Andial
mod.)

Sorry, I get tetchy when I see these "Instant Bolt-On Mega Power!!!" ads.

Given the recent hoax of a virus scare, and Mr. Katz' flame about the xmas
note posted here, I'd like to point out, that this would not be how a virus
would infect oyur system.  Mr. Katz, you could use a refresher as well it
seems.

If this message had really been a virus, it wouldn't have mattered.  While
reading the message, it is inert, you are running a _Mail_ program, not the
message itself.  While saving the message, same thing.  Unless you're using
a Mail package that is a virus (I've been thinking that Elm and Pine are
viruses sometimes), there is no risk of getting a virus in your system.

While editing the message to delete the headers, you are running an _Editor_,
again, not the possible program in the supposed virus.

And finally, when viewing the message (presumably with cat -u <filename>) you
are running the _Cat_ program, again, NOT the possible program in the
supposed virus.

Even if you were looking at the file under DOS, you would be using the built 
in function _TYPE_ which is part of the basic DOS interface, once again, NOT
the possible program in the supposed virus.

If this message was indeed a virus (and it wasn't, just a nifty ascipic of a 
choo-choo train making the xmas rounds about a Tree, then a glass of champaign
being poured), you would have had to save the file, edit it, make it
executable (as a shell script or call it foo.bat under dos since the file
type is ascii text, we know it's not a binary), and then run the script you
just created as the command itself and NOT an arguement to a program.

Please don't spread unfounded fears, and half informations.  Yes viruses are
serious, but they are easily avoided.

Well connected to the informaiton superhighway for close to 15 years, and no

Subject: 914 crankcase assembly

Okay, I tried twice to no avail.

I laid out the assembled crankcase, FAT FI cam, and the crankcase halves.  The
#2 main bearing shells, the cam bearings and the dowel pins were all installed.
I laid the crank into the crankcase half containing the dowel pins, perfect fit.
Checked that all the bearings were properly seated and the crank moved freely.
Next, align cam and lay in place, again everything turns freely.  Ok.
Insert case studs into other half of crankcase, snap vibration dampers in place,
and holding the #1 and #2 rods up, laid the second half of the crankcase over
the first.  Everything ok.  Used a rubber mallet to tap fit the case halves
and hand tightened the crankcase stud nuts(6).  Everything turns nice and 
smooth and easy up to this point.  Whenever I started to torque down the 
center two studs the crank would get bound.  Argh.  Disassemble, clean, re-
check all bearings on dowel pins, locktite, reassemble, same result.

I'm in search of wisdom.  Anything I'm missing?  Anything to look for?  Should
I try again without the cam to rule that out?  Any tricks of the trade?  I
know that the bearings are the correct size(standard).  I'm assuming that the
crank should *never* get bound during the tightening process and it isn't 
possible that this is normal and would 'fix itself' by continuing to tighten
the studs to the specified torque.  Would this happen if I overtorqued the
studs(after all it is a craftsman torquewrench)?  I could always free the 
crank back up by backing off a bit on the studs I was tightening.

Learning experiences are so much fun.

upgraded suspension parts are easy to come by. The crazy 944 turbo people
are all upgrading their cars to race suspension, freeing uo a lot of turbo
parts. As an example, I have factory sport sway bars, front discs and
rotors, and 4, 8x16 forged fuchs with early (23.3. mm) offset sitting in my
garage. Soon the rest of the suspension will be up for grabs, too.

Hi,
  I realize this may be a little off the standard Porschephiles

 My friend and I have decided to do the clutch in my '86 911
ourselves, thus saving enough to pay for a set of workshop

 The Plan is to drop the whole lump (engine+trans) then seperate.
Q: Would it be better/easier to seperate first then drop engine only ?
Q: Any things that should replaced rather than reused, besides the

Q. I know I need the '84-89 workshop manual set.  Do I need the

Q: Any suggestion for doing this operation without a lift -
    just a floor jack (or two actually).

Read it, and as usual when I read a review of theirs on anything I know
anything about, it pissed me off.

1) they use H rated tires since that's enough for your average Camry

2) they used the WRONG TIRES from Yokohama, the AVID instead of the
   AVS Intermediate or the A509, mainly because they'd be V or Z
   rated. Since I'm a Yoko guy, that stood out for me. I'd bet there
   are other better "sport sedan" tires from the other guys too.
   (BTW, a core difference: to me a sport sedan is like a Jag or
   BMW M5 or Tarus SHO similar; to them it's a Camry with a V6 -- and not 
   even the SE, which *IS* a sport sedan)

3) their testing is mainly subjective

4) their testing is highly biased for "best value" and *DOES NOT* indicate
   "best tire".

Feh. As usual, another lame review.

No. The "whole lump" is the way it comes out.

Well, that's an "as long as you're in there" deal. I usually check the
engine for oil leaks while it's out, especially since the oil 
sender always leaks and can't be replaced with the engine in the car
if you have forearms the size of mine. CLutch cable is good to replace,
since they DO break, and I can assure you, limping home without it is
no picnic...

In theory, no. In practice, sometimes. I'd recommend owning the earlier
manuals at some point, if you can. You should not need them for this
job.

> Q: I read that the fuel lines should be capped with plastic or

Your average parts store, or you can get rubber stoppers at most
hardware stores. I forget what all sizes you need, and don't forget
the oil lines either!

Works just fine from the floor. In fact, I've done more from the
floor than from the lift.

Nope. And it's a good idea. Like I said, it's *OUT*. Take every

I also have some questions about 944 suspension upgrades.

My front a-arm bushings are shot and I want to replace them with
solid bushings. Is there a better choice than the Automotion poly-
graphite bushings?

Also, Automotion does not offer front sway bar bushings. Does any
one know of a source of chassis bracket bushings for the sport
suspension option bar?

Lastly, I have a question about the Koni sport adjustable strut
insert shock. I was told this is a gas charged unit and that some
autocrossers were having better results with non-gas units. So,
is this true and is there a non-gas Koni adjustable?

From: gblanche@qntm.com
Subject: Wheels, Tires, etc...(long)

P-Files,

I was reading Bruce Anderson's book (911 Performance Handbook) to learn 
more about wheels/tires and upgrading to larger wheels and tires.  The 
data in this part of the book seems to have some inaccuracies.  Page 185 
lists a number of different combinations in the 1978-83 911SC and 1984-
87 3.2 911 Carrera sections that appear to be typos.  (15" tire sizes 
matched with 16" wheels, 225/55-16 rears instead of 225/50-16, etc)  I 
decided to do some more research to clarify this to myself.  There has 
been quite a bit of interest lately on this topic, so I've decided to 
share what I've learned for the benefit (hopefully) of the group.  The 
results are listed below:

To really understand what's happening, you need to know how to decode 
the tire sizes. For example, a 205/55-16 tire is 205mm wide (approx 8"), 
has a sidewall height that is 55% of it's width (205*.55 = 112.75mm, 
approx 4.4" tall) and the rim itself is 16" diameter.  By adding the rim 
diameter and the sidewall height twice, you get the overall diameter of 
the wheel.  The only other trick is converting all the different units 
(millimeters/centimeters/inches).  The formula I used is:

      Sidewall Height = (Tire Width * (Aspect Ratio / 100)) / 25.4

So in our example above:

      Sidewall Height = (   205     * (   55        / 100)) / 25.4
      Sidewall Height = (           112.75                ) / 25.4
      Sidewall Height = 4.438"

Then plug this into the next formula:

      Overall diameter = Wheel Diameter + (2 * Sidewall Height)

      Overall diameter =     16         + (2 * 4.438          )
      Overall diameter = 24.88"

So our sample tire, 205/55-16 has an overall diameter of 24.88"


There's probably a simpler way to do it, but this gets the job done.  
Keep in mind that the numbers you generate with this formula are not 
absolute.  The actual tire on an actual wheel may have a slightly 
different overall diameter.  The important thing to remember is that the 
diameters you calculate are accurate relative to each other.  So if you 
do the formula for a number of different size tires from the same 
manufacturer, you can get a feel for which ones have comparable 
diameters.  Different manufacturers making the same "size" tire may 
actually have slightly different overall diameters, so be careful when 
comparing different brands to each other.

I have gone to the trouble of listing tire sizes offered by many of the 
popular tire manufacturers below.  I have them sorted by their overall 
diameter.  The objective would be to find your current tire size on the 
list, and then find a size you like as close to your original diameter 
as possible.  This would insure that you wouldn't hurt your acceleration 
with an overly large tire, (or your bodywork!) or screw up your 
speedometer calibration either.  Here goes:

235/60-16     27.10
265/50-17     27.43


Based on this table, we could make a proper selection for our sample 
205/55-16 tire if we wanted to upgrade to a 17" wheel/tire combination.  
Look at the chart for 24.88" and you'll see three candidates nearby:

215/45-17     24.62"  difference of -.26"
245/40-17     24.72"  difference of -.16"
225/45-17     24.97"  difference of +.09"

My guess is that a difference of .2" or so in either direction is 
probably acceptable.  Of course, you'll have to consider the WIDTH of 
these tires also.  Getting that 245 under the front fender of your 911 
is probably going to be tough ;)

One more thing...(I know you're probably wishing I'd shut up already!)  
If you look at examples of Porsches coming straight from the factory, 
they have almost identical diameters for front and rear tires:

1989 911 Turbo    205/55-16  24.88"
                  245/45-16  24.68"

1989 911 Carrera  205/55-16  24.88"
                  225/50-16  24.86"

I doubt that this is a coincidence!  If you decide to vary your overall 
diameter by much (smaller than stock) you'll probably want to insure 
that the diameter decreases equally on both the front and rear tires.  I 
don't have any facts about why equal diameters are important, but I'll 
bet someone else on the list could explain this.

That's all for now.  I welcome any comments or corrections.  
Happy Holidays Everyone! *<]:)

Subject: 951 Oil Change question


Hello All;

It's time to change the oil again in my '89 944 Turbo.  I switched to 
Mobil 1 15W50 with my last oil and filter change.  I noticed that it took only 7 
quarts to fill the crankcase to the top mark on the dipstick.  The owner's 
manual calls for 7.4 quarts.  This isn't a big difference, but the car seems to 
be going through oil faster than before the switch to Mobil 1.  I have had to 
add 4 quarts during the last 3000 miles, but that included two days at the 
track.  I am afraid it is because I am leaving out the extra 0.4 quarts.  The 
owner's manual also states the difference between the upper and lower marks on 
the dipstick is about 1 quart.  When I add oil, it only takes about 0.5 quarts 
between the two marks.  Any thoughts?  Maybe I have the wrong dipstick?  Thanks 
in advance.

More on Porsche's WSC Car 
(courtesy, PCA Editors Mail List)

The press release issued December 19 by Porsche Cars North America announced
the new open-cockpit two-seat Porsche, to compete in the World Sports Car
(WSC) category, would be built "in cooperation with TRW of the U.S." TRW,
the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Team based in Valparaiso, Indiana, is no stranger
to world-class sportscar racing having fielded the Jaguar factory campaigns
in the IMSA GTP series.

The December 30, 1994 issue of ON TRACK has more interesting news, and some
speculation, about the Porsche WSC car. According to ON TRACK, Porsche
intends for its new prototype to become a customer car, but will run it as a
factory entry initially. Because the car employs a 3.0-liter turbo, it will
be allowed only in the IMSA endurance events at Daytona and Sebring. At Le
Mans, the car will be entered in the WSC category along with whatever other
categories Porsche decides to enter. IMSA officials are reported to have
indicated a "strong possibility" the Porsche WSC car will be included in the
Exxon World Sports Car Championship in 1966 if the turbo proves to be
equitable with the atmospheric engine now required.

Of even more interest, ON TRACK has speculated that Mario and Michael
Andretti might be booked to drive the new Porsche at Daytona, just eleven
years after they gave the Porsche 962 its race debut in the 24-hour race.
According to the same rumors, Mario Andretti might also race the Porsche at
Sebring and Le Mans.

Now, doesn't that just make your day?

Chris:
	regarding dropping the engine...

I think is better to do the whole thing as a package. Then dismantle the trans from
the engine.

Check your library for CHilton's import big book. Also try Haynes' manual. I just
borrowed the Big Book and it has pretty good coverage. THe Haynes' also covers
repairs. I don't think you need factory manuals. Clutch replacement is pretty straight
forward.

Baggies and masking tape might be just as good to cover your gas lines. Once they stop
draining. You just want to protect them from junk...

I dropped the engine twice (Don't ask :)  years ago on my old '71 911T in front of
my parent's house. I used 2x4 to build up ramps. jack it up, put a 2x4, jack it up,
put a 2x4 under the wheels. I was able to get enough clearance. You need to remove
the rear apron (by license plate). I used one floor jack and a brother in law to 
manhandle the engine... Sister has since divorced. Good for her!
I had Zenith(?) carbs. They were pretty tall...

YOu migh need to make some spacers to release pressure on the clutch assembly... I 
used 1/2" pipe with a cut:

	-----
	|   |_
	|    |
	-----

This allows you to release the pressure on the Pplate. Don't know if that applies
to the newer cars. It would be nice to do the valves at the same time. Would also be
nice to have a mover's dolly to wheel engine around...

YMMV!

Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: 911 MFI Questions


Todd-

Here's what I've learned about MFI.  Maybe it'll help.  I'll 
know a lot more when I actually get to drive this project 
that I've been working on for over a year.  But I do have it 
running, and have played with it a bit.

You should be able to change the idle speed three ways.  
With the "stop" screws on each air stack, with the air 
correction screw, and with adjustments to the rods lengths.  
But that doesn't mean you want to use them all.  Only the 
first two.

The idea, at idle and at speed, is to have each cylinder 
ingesting an equal amount of air, so to speak, so they are 
balanced.  What you're trying to achieve is a condition 
where the throttle plates are at identical angles, i.e., they all 
let in the same amount of air, no matter whether at idle or 
at high speed.

The position of the throttle plates at idle should be adjusted 
with the stop screws.  The paper test you mention is a good 
way to do it.  It will tell you that at idle the throttle plate is 
just cracked open a bit.  But, since the opening required at 
idle is so small,  it's hard to get them exactly the same with 
a coarse adjuster like the stop screw, and since there are 
also bound to be slight variations in dimensions of the 
plates and the air stacks, you have a finer adjuster --the air 
screw-- to even things out.  So set up the stop screws first, 
then use your Unisync to even things up with the air 
screws.  Make sure that with the stop screws set, the 
linkages are all just "slack".  You don't want them affecting 
the idle.  The air screw, by the way, won't change speed 
much.  But you ought to be able to see its effect with the 
Unisync.  You can raise the overall idle, if necessary, with 
the stop screws, equally with each.  Then trim 'em up with 
the air screws.

At 3000 rpm the air screws won't matter.  They really only 
affect idle speed.  Here's where the linkages have to be 
equal.  What you want to wind up with is linkages just 
"slack" at idle, and adjusted so air intake at each stack is 
equal at 3000 rpm or so.  It's harder to write it out than to 
do it.

I think you had most of this.  The only real mistake I think 
was your assumption that the correction screws would 
help adjust things at 3000 rpm.  Won't work.  That's not 
what they're for.  The plates are so far open at this speed, 
and the adjustment provided by the air screw is so small, it 
just won't matter even if you took the screw out entirely.

Does this help?

I got one of the Zims arms in today.

I opened the box and found a pretty silver control arm.
It had been spray painted!

There is also a grease fitting that my old arm didn't have.
I was told the rebuild used an OEM joint because cutting the casting
for an aftermarket joint would weaken it. 
I guess drilling for a grease nipple is O.K.?

If it's not raining tomorrow I'll put it on.

Hi pfilers:
	Here's my saga, I need your advise. Could this have happened?
Cam and balance shafts were leaking. Proceded to dismantle front of engine:

1. Found TDC on #1, timing marks lined up @ timing hole, @camshaft and bal shft.
Locked crank with tool. Removed plugs.

2. R&R oil seals on BS and Oil Pump.

3. Had a stripped 12 pt CS timing gear nut. Started to drill out. Used a large
wrench to turn cam to get better angle to drill nut.

	Note: I think this is where I screwed up! Did not relize that

4. Got nut out, R&R seal

5. While crank still locked, put CS to TDC. Installed timming belt. Spun the
crank around. No weird noises. Back to TDC. Everything lined up. Locked crank.

6. Installed BS belt. Checked timing marks. Rotated crank. Everything lines
up.

7. Reassembled ancilliaries. Disconnected DME connector @ CPU. Cranked to
prime oil pump. Got pressure. Undo battery, connect DME, redo battery.

8. Try to start. Cranks and have spark. Engine starts only by flooring
accelerator. Runs a bit, misses, some noise (valve hitting :( ? )

9. Recheck timming. Removed plugs. Fouled. Car will not start.

When I had the mechanic perform the pre-inspection on the 911 I purchased
he told me to keep the revs above 2500rpm.  This was for two reasons.  It
keeps the oil flowing (and we know how important that is on the 911
motor), and prevents undue stress on the crank bearings, since the boxer
type motor with the pistons laying flat would stress the crank.  When I
drive around town I do keep the revs up over 2500, and that is why my gas
mileage is so bad, maybe 15 mpg.  On the highway (freeway, turnpike) I
hate to put it in 5th, since at legal speeds the car revs so low.
 
As a side note, I got a speeding ticket in VA, about a month ago, 75 in a
55, I was stupid, I did not have my radar detector out (what, aren't they
illegal in VA).  Well I was in Anahiem, CA last week, and crused around LA
and down to San Diego, for almost a whole week at 70 to 75 mph on the
freeway.  I guess things are different wherever you go.

Check your paper fresh air hoses (about 3" diam, go from blower to

You probably will need the whole set of 911 workshop manuals, 
from the beginning.

Buy the Haynes guide for $20 to use as a rough outline, and for
something you can flip through when your hands are greasy.

> Q: I read that the fuel lines should be capped with plastic or

dunno. if they're rubber lines, plug them with a pencil, pen,
or punch, and tighten a hose clamp around them if necessary.

if they're metal, you could use masking tape.

> Q: Any suggestion for doing this operation without a lift - 
>     just a floor jack (or two actually).  

I used portable metal ramps and two floor jacks, one for the engine 
and one to stabilize the trans. The one for the trans didn't help. 
The one for the engine is critical. Get a full-sized floor jack like 
they use in a professional shop, you can rent one from a tool rental 
business. Don't try to get by with a cheap small one, they are not as 
stable and probably will not extend high enough.

I was very glad to have 3 friends help: I was directly behind the
car manning the main floor jack, one person was on each of the rear
corners of the engine tugging back on the exhaust headers, and one person
was looking underneath the car from in front of one of the rear wheels
keeping an eye on whether or not the engine was staying on the jack pad
and manning an extra jack under the trans (probably not needed). The 
fourth person came in handy helping to disconnect the oil cooler line
that I had forgotten to disconnect (fortunately I had already loosened it!).

No, sounds like a good idea provided you have an engine stand.
If you don't have an engine stand it may be tough to get to the
bottom valves.
If you don't have an engine stand, gather some planks and 2x4s so
you can support the engine beneath the case, rather than by putting
all the weight on the exhaust system.

Take your time, be careful, and have fun.

I'm not an expert, but I would recommend that you have a complete valve
job done while the head is off, and check it for flatness as well. I just RnR'd
the head on my '84 944 because of a blown head gasket. The head was
warped, so I had it milled. I also had a valve job done (130K miles on car).
The machine shop replaced the exhaust valve guides and installed the
new seals that came with the top end gasket set.

If you do take the head into a shop, remove the exhaust manifolds and
clean it up. The shop will do a better job for you if you make it easier for
them. Make sure you soak the exhaust manifold nuts with penetrating oil
overnight so that you have a good chance of removing them without
shearing off a stud. Ditto for the manifold-to-head-pipe nuts.

Regarding the intake manifold, rather than disconnecting everything, just
disconnect the minimum to allow swinging it out of the way.

And do remember to drain the water first!

BTW, do you have the factory shop manuals? The procedures in the
Haynes manual were inadequate. For example, they didn't give the head
torquing sequence.

Good luck!

Hi,

I was driving my '73 911 in the rain yesterday and when I stopped at a red
light after a few miles I heard a faint clicking noise coming from the dash.
 I took out the clock and noticed that it was the turn signal relay that was
the culprit.
The symptoms: it occurs when the engine is on, but not when the key is in the
last postion (the position right before you engage the starter). It clicks
every 4-5 seconds but only half as loud as when the E-brake or turn signal is
on, and everything else works as usual. My question is: Do I need a new relay
or is there a short somewhere that is causing the relay to click every 4-5
seconds?

Thanks a lot  and have a Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday,

If only Consumer Reports had not claimed to be rating performance tires.
I'd have let this slide if they'd said "touring tires for performance

>> "best tire" not equal to "best value"

Sigh. This gets back to my old story about buying tires, when I first 
hit "sticker shock" on motorcycle tires. I rolled the Beemer into the 
local dealer and asked about tires, figuring that I'd get some sort of
generic tire for about $30 a wheel. They rolled out the Michellin, the
Conti, the Dunlop, and the Avon. I looked at them, said "OK, how much".
Just about fainted when I was told that it was close to $100 a tire. 

The don't-need-no-stinking-car old timer behind the counter could tell
that I was having trouble with this, despite the fact that I rode in on
a Beemer and he knew I had a couple of Porsches (this was a *long* time
ago...). So he said, "Do the math -- how big is your contact patch at 60MPH?"

When I thought about it, and realized that there were about 4 square inches
of tire between me and intensive care, I stopped thinking in terms of what
it was costing me to buy tires, and started thinking in terms of what the
cost of NOT buying the best tires might be. 

Fast Forward  a short time to the first time I had to by 911 tires. The car 
had real piece of crap P7s on it. I loved the car, but knew that it didn't 
handle as well as various friends' cars, and I wanted better. But I'd been 
used to buying tires for "normal" cars, where "great tires" were measured 
in terms of how long they'd last, usually were about $60 a piece, and could 
typically be put on your Sears charge card. I decided to do the research,
and discovered that there were some really decent tires out there, but they
had really crummy wear characteristics, and were sort of expensive. This 
bothered my sensibilities, carefully crafted around the mass market tire
mentality.

Further investigation showed that *all* of these tires, regardless of 
manufacturer, had a common characteristic: they were made in small quantity, 
and for a discriminating audience. A much smaller audience, that meant there
would not be the quantity pricing, an audience that didn't care about the
length of wear nearly as much as the quality of what you could do with  the
tire while it still had life.

After my first drive in a 911 with A001s (I said this was a while ago), I 
understood immediately: the difference between a Road Handler and an
A001 was like the difference between a VS brandy and a Cour Imperial
cognac. Sure, there is this gross similarity, but the difference! And I
was hooked -- *WHY* would I own such a wonderful car and then hobble it
with cheap tires that didn't let it perform? To me, tires have become
like oil -- just part of the cost of owning the car. And to not chose the
best is to seriously deminish the performance of the car, and hence my
enjoyment of it.

Clearly, you don't buy PZeros for a Corrola, or put A008RS IIs on a
Lumina. And, when you review performance tires, you *DO* need to keep
in perspective what they'll be used for. My wife's car does not have the
same tires that the Porsches do (but it's the same manufacturer!)

But consider this: how, in any reasonable sense, can a magazine that thinks 
the ideal car is zero maintenence, has dual airbags, abs, an automatic 
transmission, cup holders, and a really nice stereo, a magazine that *DOES 
NOT EVEN REVIEW* **ANY** Porsche, possibly have anything relevant to say 
to a Porsche owner? Value is where you find it. To me, saving a buck or
two on tires to deminish the value of the car is NOT reasonable. 

Neither is trusting Consumer Reports to pick a reasonable performance tire.

Yes they have. They did a comparison test of a Honda Prelude Si, a Mazda
RX-7, a Toyota Celica GT-S, and a 944 in August 1986. All four were rated as
acceptable, so all were "winners." I thought the comments on all four cars,
which I drove at the time, were quite good, unbiased, and reflected my
impressions - but again, calling these four vehicles "sports cars" is
pushing it.

(I couldn't afford a 944, and got a 924S instead. The only comfort I have is
passing 944's on the back straight...)

On the other hand, its up to the reader to interpret the results, and take
what they want from the report. At least Consumer Reports is (supposed to
be) unbiased, if a little out of its league on this topic. Compare that to
tire tests in British car magazines, which always favour Dunlop to some
extent, and to American ones, which are always kinder to BFG and Goodyear...

Subject: Two 914's for sale

I have friend whose brother has two 914's that have been siiting in her 
parent's drive way for several years.  One car is a '71 (I believe) 
daily driver and the other is a '70 (I think) twisted wreck parts car.

'71 car:

1.7L eng. Needs work leaking fuel lines other misc., probably needs a 
major over haul. The car starts with out any problems, though.  The body 
is in ok shape, no major rust that I can tell.  I checked around the 
battery area and it did not appear to have any major rust.  The front 
left fender at the signal light needs to be replaced along with some 
straightening of the bonnet as they were damaged in an accident.  The 
interiors of the two trunks and driver compartment are perfect.  Needs 
new paint as the paint has lost it's luster.

'70 parts car:

has good front left fender and bonnet.  Definite beer can materail.  The 
engine is out of the car in the drivers seat.

The '71 needs some tlc to bring it back to life.  If any one is 
interested they can contact my friend, Franceen at work at 408-377-8700.

I don't know what the asking price is.

Disclaimer:) I don't know very much about 914's in general, only what 
I've read here or in magazines.  But, I would be willing to check 
specifics on the cars if you are out of the area and need some one to 
look them over more thoroughly.

Tense alert.... Sure, they reviewed the 944. But I went looking once, way
back in the stacks, and while I found 944, 924, and even 914 (!) reviews,
there's nothing in the recent years, and *NOTHING* in the performance

The best modifications depend on the use. If you're a street-only guy, then
by all means, spend it on things that add to reliability and safety.

If you're an autox guy, then you want tires, shocks and *MINOR* modifications
that keep you in  a "stock" class until you figure out what you're doing.

If you're a track guy, then spend it at Skip Barbour....

Seriously, dollar for dollar, *NOTHING* improves a 914 like good tires
on wider wheels (at least 5.5" styled steel or real 2.0 Fuchs alloys, 
or 7" custom Panosports if you're doing the track thing or "prepared" autox). 

Once again, though, *KNOW THE RULES*!!!! The single biggest mistake
I see people make is spending money on what they *THINK* is the "hot
setup" because they read about it in a magazine, then they decided to
do something competitive with the car and find they're running with
the 935s or something because one specific modification bumps them into
pure race car classes...

Subject: 951 Power Steering Hemorhage


Power steering exhibited typical low-fluid symptoms. (Insane noise as the
pump cavitates under load).  Re-filled and vented the system.  Looking under
the car, there is almost a steady drip of fluid on the right side (Bad sign).
 The pump fittings look ok.  I don't have jackstands, so I really can't get
too far underneath to look.   And the air dam makes it such that the car
cannot go up the ramps I do own.  There is a buildup of fluid around the
right steering boot (unsure if that's the correct name) but I'm not sure how
the power connects there.
       The questions are:  What is the likely culprit?  Can a reasonably
competent driveway mechanic fix it?

Fred, 

If you do not have the cars repair and maintenance records, your '66 911
probably does not have the upgrade. 

For years I was paranoid about the tensioners going on my '70 911E. My car
had over 250,000 miles on the original engine, I knew my tensioners days
would be numbered sooner or later. About 30,000 miles later we dropped the
engine and decided it was time to rebuild the engine. Timing (no pun
intended) was on our side. The tensioners were weak and would have broken at
any time. 

We upgraded the tensioners and they have brass fittings outside the cam
housings (on either side of the fan).  Beleive me it is a relief to know they
are there!

I would not start the car again with metal chips inside the cam.. If you
belong to PCA, there maybe someone in your region that can take a look at the
cams for you. If not and the weather permits, you may want to tow it to your
friendly Porsche repair shop. 

Wish you the best of luck,

Was that you holding up traffic to San Diego on Friday? <g> I usually go

Subject: Dupont paint

 
Centari is nothing special, just an ordinary acrylic enamel. I use it for
stuff like undercarriage parts, steering columns and such, but I wouldn't
do an entire car in it; there are better (and more expensive) products for
that. It seems the top restorers like two European-based brands, Sikkens
and Glasurit, for their catalyzed enamels. I have shot Glasurit 21-line on a
356 and liked the results; if anything, it's TOO good (no more factory orange
peel). I have seen a "black" 356 (actually a dark root beer color) done in
Sikkens paint and it looked so deep you could dive into it. Both of these
brands are used by the factory when they paint the new cars. They don't use
DuPont as far as I know. It makes sense to me to repaint with the same
brands chosen by the factory.
 
I use Centari because it's a no-brainer to mix and apply; just paint and
reducer, no catalyst. It's not terribly durable stuff. For really durable
undercarriage paint, I should use a catalyzed or epoxy product like DuPont
Imron, but I'm cheap and lazy and don't want yet another line of cans and
bottles on the shelf for yet another specialized job. I wouldn't use Imron
for the outside of a car because it's too difficult to deal with in the event
of a later accident and necessary matching/blending of the repair. Imron is
great for show cars that will never get spot repairs or stone chips, and
aircraft which tend not to bounce off other aircraft.
 
BTW, refinishing paint is not the same as what the factory puts on. It's
formulated differently because you can't bake a car which is filled with
wiring, plastic, leather, vinyl, and such like you can bake an otherwise
empty shell. So even if you buy the same brand as original, it's not the
same product, strictly speaking. Paint delivered to car factories is a
special animal.
 
You might consider looking at cars that have been refinished to concours
quality and ask what paint they used. OK, so you may not need to do a show
car, but if you skimp on paint now, you may be sorry in 3-5 years even on a
daily driver. The difference in cost and quality between a $8,000 or $10,000
concours paint job and a daily driver paint job lies more in the preparation
and post-painting sanding and polishing than it does in the cost of the raw
material.
 
It's probably no use to tell your shop to shoot some other brand of paint.
They're not set up for it, they're not experienced in it, they resent being
told how to do their work... Ask at some other shops first.
 
Pete

Well, those cars aren't really part of their target demographic audience, 
are they? <grin> As they buy all their cars, I suspect recent models are 
a bit out of their price range... and whatever big-buck cars they do test 
are the lower-end luxo-sedans.

Errr, by "target audience," I mean those who would base a purchase 
decision on their report... I doubt any buyer of a 993 would be swayed 
into a decision by CR! :)

I suspect they included the 944 in the above test as a "Standard of 
Comparison".... and are you saying the 944, 924, and 914 *aren't* 
performance models??? tsk, tsk... heheheheh. <just kidding>.

> Maybe they'll have a Boxter versus Miata versus Geo Metro LSi "battle

It'll be humourous reading if they do... "The Boxster's luggage area was 
confined compared to the others..." <snicker>.

Anyways, if you think of a car as an appliance, CR is great. Otherwise...

I believe IsoPropanol might be the alchohol to use in the washer bottle. 
Methanol has a strange smell and you shouldn't drink it either,...on the 
other side, *IF* you drink it; the problem with the deteriorating water 
bottle might be solved too...!  ;-)
Methanol is great for washing parts in though!
Isopropanol could be used for other purposes too, at my former location 
(..one of Norways biggest Chemichal companies) we did some tests, drink 
isopropanol and get drunk tomorrow. It was taken up in the blood *very* 
slow. (..don't try it at Home, unless you have 4 feets and 2 teeth, and is a 
relative to Mickey.)

>also common to use ethanol (not methanol) which has been made undrinkable so

That is the biggest *abuse* of Ethanol I ever hear of! The only glass 
justifiable to wash with Ethanol, is a Whiskey glass,...and that on the 
INSIDE!!  ;-)

Actually you should use Isopropanol mixed with water to make the BEST (and 
cleanest) water bottle solution. Now why should someone wanna' use Methanol? 
I suspect it to have something to do with the price fo the stuff, you can 
get methanol cheap, (under 1NOK a litre, (22/12-94; $1 = 6.88NOK) but 
Isopropanol is expensive. (..around 3-4NOK a couple years ago). 
Since the other ingredient (water) is free, at leats here in *my* part of 
the world, from an economical viewpoint it makes a sense to use methanol 
instead of Isopropanol.

I always get a kick when I hear people beating on their 911s (or other
sports or gt car) spinning at 2500, 3000, or better at 25 or 30 mph in
town. Screaming your engine in the lower gears around town will have two
outcomes. First, it will increase the wear on the machinery. Second, it
will waste fuel. A very long time ago, Porsche engines were fitted with
roller bearing crankshafts (Hirth) which COULD BE damaged by low revs in
the wrong gear. Modern bearing insert materials, today's synthetic oil and
electronic ignition have taken away any valid reason to spin your engine
at highway speeds in the lower gears around town. I consider doing so an
affectation -- like the nouveau BMW drivers that run around with their
fog lights on.

2	buy car for  8k sell for 20k after 13 weeks & repeat for ever

first case I make 5k x 12 = 60k profit in a year for lots of work

Grayson,

I don't know about your 911, but mine sounds GREAT between 3000-4000 RPM.
I find that driving my 911 at less than about 2800 RPM makes it lug and  as
I recall, it is about 1200 RPM below the peak torque range of the engine.
I have yet to see an adverse affect from this "beating" aside from my gas
mileage.

Besides, one of the things I love about my Porsche is the wonderful sounds
that she makes.  Almost better than sex.

published in the _Prieta Post_, the Loma Prieta Region's newsletter.

     Porsche Bells
    [To the tune of "Jingle Bells"]

Dashing through the Valley
In my Nine Fourteen Porsch-ay
Up Highway Nine I go,
Sliding all the way.
I need new piston rings,
I need some decent tires --
My car is held together by some old AT-bus wire!

(chorus :)
OH, rust and smoke,
The heater's broke,
The roof just blew away!
I see a flash
Beneath the dash,
And then I start to pray-ay!
The A-arm's bent,
The muffler went,
The Blaupunkt, it's okay--
Oh, what fun it is to drive my Nine Fourteen Porsch-ay!

I went to the Pak'n 'Sav
To get some Christmas cheer.
I just passed up my left front tire
And it's gettin' hard to steer!
Down to the El Camino,
Right past the Sunnyvale cop.
I had to drag my Reeboks
To get the car to stop.

(chorus)

Down the road I go
In a big blue cloud of smoke.
People laugh as I drive by,
I wonder what's the joke?
I've got to get to Valco
To pick up the lay-away--
Santa Claus is coming
In his li'l mid-engined sleigh!

Stan, I have to agree that Consumer Reports doesn't always rate products
according to criteria that I would use, or  rate products I would want to
buy. But, on the other hand, they are the only magazine that does not
accept advertising, or free cars, and so they only one I trust to be honest
and critical. So if they say Dunlops have a shorter braking distance than
brand X, I believe them. If they say that Michelins are noisy, I just
ignore them.
I remember that Consumer Reports rated the 912.  As far as I can recall,
they said that it was the perfect car for long distances on windy secondary
streets, but that it really was <not> the right car for cruising down the
highway. They also rated the 914 favorably, and maybe the 944, but I'm not
sure. Typically, their excuse for such  departures from their normal
penny-pinching is that they want a bench-mark to rate other cars. Michael

JamesD,
At this time of year my 87 924S steering does the same, i.e. groans/cavitates
at temperatures below freezing at startup.  Conclusion I've reached after
talking with mechanics and seeing other messages on the list in re 944s/24s in
that age c. 85-88  is that there is an air-leak due to a cold weather
contracting seal somewhere in the bowels of the steering rack.  At one time,
evidently, you could get a rebuild kit with new seals, but no longer. One
mechanic(Ivan in the Northern Virginia area) found that a Mazda? seal fit.
Another (Doug in Central Pa.) looked at steering rack and said that same rack
is used in certain model Audis for which there is a rebuild kit.
Bottom line is that it is irritating but not critical problem, occurs in cold
weather, goes away when steering fluid warms up, and can be fixed without major
parts replacement.
Hope this helps.

Keith. If you spend $2000 on a 914, then my guess would be that how you
spend your remaining money will be dictated by what need fixing, but I
might be wrong (and you might have gotten a real good deal). Anyway, the
suspension, brakes (and tires) are probably most important to upgrade,
since handling is what the 914 excels at. New springs, new torsion bars,
new shocks, wider tires, and a professional alignment couldn't hurt. From
what I've read in this list, engine mods which really increase performance
are expensive and complicated. Michael

Subject: 944 Front A-arm Bushings


Eric,

I do not recommend plastic bushings for street use. A new set of Porsche
bushings is far superior for most situations. Also replace the ball joint
while the arm is out of the car. The ball joint is a larger problem with 
steel arms (I'm assuming you have a car with Steel arms here). The 
joints will get loose, not break. The arms can bend.

I replaced both front arms on my 944 with OEM new arms and all bushings
and ball joints for $204. The front end actually works very well with 
the stock bushings.

On shocks, the Koni gas SPORT shock is the desired setup. Works very well 
on the track also.

If you are refering to the bushings for a rear swaybar, most Porsche 
dismantlers will give you the bushings and hardware if you ask. 
If you buy new Automotion bars, the bushings are included, if you need
new replacements for any Weltmeister bar, call Automotion directly 
for prices.

Subject: RE: 951 Power Steering Hemorhage


James,

Look for two different things.  First and most common is leaking of PS
fluid from the feed and return hoses at the base of the reservoir.  The
solid hose clamps Porsche put on there are responsible, and they
upgraded them (per some tech bulletin) to more flexible "Zebra" hose
clamps.  Doing so will solve most of the seepage there.

There is also a hose clamp on the banjo fitting at the end of the feed
line to the PS pump.  Replace it too -- same problem, same solution.
If possible, get hose clamps with rounded edges, as they will not cut
the hose.  You can get 'em from your dealer for short money.

The second thing to look for is leaking from the steering rack.  To
check it, you will have to remove the belly pan.  Clean around the
rubber boot at the end of the rack before pulling it back, because
you do not want grit, etc., getting in there and ruining the rack's
internal seals.  Pull the boot off the end of the rack and slide it down
the tie rod.  If when you pull the boot back you find there is fluid
within it, you have a rack needing replacement.

When you top off the PS reservoir, and if it was really low, you also
need to bleed the system.  This is a simple matter of starting the
engine, then turning the steering wheel from lock to lock a few times.
You should hear the groaning stop, which means the air's out.

Merry Christmas to all.

Subject: Replacing a 944 hydraulic clutch hose


I recently replaced a leaking clutch hydraulic hose on my '86 944. 
Apparently, this is a common item for replacement due to heat and it's
proximity to the engine which eventually wears through the rubber due
to vibration. I'd recommend putting a piece of tubing around the area of
contact to minimize this. BTW, the part was 951.324.189.01 ($190 cdn).
If you're interested in my procedure, read on...
 
1. Raise the rear of the car several inches. This will ensure the air bubbles
   are at the top when you bleed the slave cylinder. It also lets you crawl
   under the car.
 
2. Disconnect the end at the firewall. Unscrew the end at the slave. Unscrew
   the clamp which holds the rigid portion of the hose to the bell-housing.
   I was able to perform the job without removing the starter, though it
   would have made it easier.
 
3. Install the new hose and clamp. I found it easier to install the end 
   at the slave first.
 
4. Bleeding - Contrary to the posts I've read, I found no need to use any 
   bleeding kits etc. Here's how I did it. Initially, with the bleed screw
   open, I pumped the clutch pedal several times (you have to pull it back
   up by hand) to get fluid coming out. I then closed the bleeder.
    
   What actually pushes your clutch pedal back up is the clutch pressure 
   plate. I positioned the seat so I could prop up a piece of wood to 
   compress the clutch pedal to the floor. I then open the bleeder, releasing
   the fluid, and closed it off once the fluid stopped. Then I pulled the
   pedal up by hand (slowly), compressed it with the wood again and repeated
   the process until no more bubbles came out. The pressure plate pushing
   on the release lever was in effect pumping for me.
 
5. Just to make sure, I measured the travel of the slave piston through the
   inspection hole and it was within spec (15-18mm) at 15 mm. I also adjusted
   the pedal at the locknut so there was less free-play .

David:
   $1000 "installed" is a terrible price for a built-in radar detector,
particularly a secondary brand such as K-40. List price for a Bel
wideband-laser (651 STIr, I think) is $349, which means you can get the unit
for as low as $180 from a mail-order schlock-house. Installing the unit in a
993 is a bitch. As my installer moaned: "The thing is all sealed, it's built
like a tank." Right. Figure $150 for the installation. In my car, that means
the Bel detector is in the ashtray, and the only thing visible is a brief
length of wire from the sun visor to the laser detector stuck on behind the
rear-view mirror. I figure $500 tops is what you should pay for a top-flight
built-in detector, even in Fun City.
    (Of course, you -do- realize that these things don't really work against
laser, right...?) Happy motoring,

They are overpriced, but adequate products. Equal or even superior
quality can be had from Megiuar's, Eagle-One, Liquid Glass, Harley,
and a few others. Zymol was the marketing creation of some guys
from Connecticut. When you check the price of 100% pure carnauba
wax from a chemical supply company (about $20 per kilo), you will
wonder what you pay for when you buy Zymol wax at $100 or even
$499 per one-half pound. It is no better and no worse than any
quality carnauba product. This assumes that you want to use a
carnauba product instead of the alternatives -- and why. Waxes
are only protective layers -- carnauba being one of the best
organic compounds -- but inferior to synthethics. If you're after
appearance and not durability, stick with a glaze such as 
Meguiar's or 3M. If you're after durability, then you will
want a synthetic. Check out some of the good detailing books
(Jacobs is good), the marque club publications, and the owner's
manual. Get the facts, and spend your money wisely.

	The 993 is a bit boomy at 2500 rpm, so I also enjoy driving 
between 3000-4000 rpm. The new exhaust is significantly noisier 
than the C2 from about 2000 to 3000 rpm. Besides, response is quicker at 
these rpm (important up here at 8000 ft where hp drops by about 25%). I 
agree with whoever it was that said that it is difficult to shift up to 
5th on our slow expressways. And I'll probably never use 6th again since 
I drove it in Europe! I still am averaging over 19 mph, even though I 
tend to enjoy using higher revs.
	I do agree with the comments about running around town at very 
high revs, but 3000-4000 rpm just isn't that high. (Actually, I tend to 
shift before 4000 rpm unless I am having some fun).

Generally I shift right at 4000 RPM in "normal" driving and I push the

	I find the blower to be superfluous.  Having removed it and covered

dependance upon engine speed.  Re quality; the one for $289 may not be as

P-Philes,

I posted a message about a week ago for some items off of a 1982 911 SC Targa
that I had bought while trying to rebuild my '67 that was a victim of theft.

I first wanted to thank all the people who responded with their needs and I
was able to help.

Secondly I wanted to list the things that are still available as well as new
stuff that I have discovered  while dismanteling the car.

1 Passangers side door (no mirror)
Complete rear suspension including sway bar, brakes calipers and rotors,
swing arms, plates, the whole nine yards.
Rear bumper (Red and in great shape)
Front bumper (Also red but with a scrape on the pass. side that is fixable)
Targa Glass
AC Compressor and mounting brackets
Steering rack
Front calipers
Wiper motor
Front suspension minus the struts including sway bar
A bunch of other relays and little stuff.

Like I said in my original message I'm not trying to get rich but would like
to keep this stuff from the crusher. A recyclable Porsche part is too
dignified for the crusher!

And once again as I mentioned in the original message, I potentially will
deliver this stuff. On Dec 26th I leave for San Francisco and will be happy
to deliver what every you want as long as your on my way. Please respond
directly and I will be checking e-mails while on the road.

Subject: 911: Dropping engine

Chris,
  I took the engine out of my '82 911 SC a few years ago and found it to be
a real pain. The main thing I can tell you is that there are so many wires,
hoses, etc to disconnect that there is no way to remember them all, and
that was on my '82 SC; your 86 likely has even more. The only way to cope
with it is to *TAKE*REALLY*GOOD*NOTES* I can't stress enough how helpful
the notes that my brother took during disassembly were to putting things
back together. He wrote down *EVER* thing during disassembly.
  To answer your questions -
A: Engine & trans come out together (unless you take the body off)
A: Trans is easy to rebuild compared to getting the engine out.
   I've heard conflicting reports about replacing the flywheel bolts.
A: I bought every manual I could get my hands on, Clymer, Haynes, Porsche.
   They're all helpful. The later factory manuals rely on the earlier
   ones, I have about 20" of manuals (my set goes through '86) Maybe you
   can borrow a set from a fellow Philer.
A: I think I used saran wrap and rubber bands for capping the lines,
   but auto parts stores sell rubber caps.
A: There was a thread about how to get the engine out not long ago.
   Martin Walker posted excellent instructions for his car, an '83SC,
   which I can email you if need be. I used a large T-shaped piece of
   3/4" plywood and 4 (!) floor jacks on my car. I jacked the car WAY up
   on giant jackstands to get it over the engine, and pulled the engine
   out on three of the floor jacks. What a moment!
A: Great time to do the valves, update to Carrera pressure fed tensioners,
   admire the engine, rebuild the transmission, you name it.

Bob,
 
Thanks for answer on the MFI adjustment.
 
I did realize that the stop screws make the coarse adjustment on the idle,
but did not realize how little the air adjustment screws affect it.  I
know with my limited exposure to my 911 and MFI, that the factory
procedures leave alot to be desired.  And with my fooling with the MFI I
have already learned alot.
 
I did wonder about the throttle links and the stop screws.  I can see that
one could get the stacks evenly flowing at idle, with the proper idle set,
and the throttle links slack.  Then at RPM, with the throttle links set
with slack at idle, they may open the throttle plates at different
degrees.  Is that what the air correction screws are suppose to take care
of at idle?
 
My idea on progressing from here is:
 
        Adjust valves
 
        Check vacuum lines, and replace any that look cracked
 
        Adjust timing, then try to raise the idle speed up.
 
        Set the air correction screws to 4 or 5 half turns from full stop.
 
        Set the throttle plates, using the stop screws and paper feeler
gauge.  I then know that they are somewhat equal.
 
        Warm-up the car to operating temp., and adjust the idle to ~950rpm
using the stop screws, turning evenly.  Then using the air correction
screws, try to equalize the flow using the Unisync.
 
        Attach the throttle links, setting them so that they do not pull
on the throttle plates.
 
        Check the flow at ~3000 using the Unisync.  Maybe adjust the
throttle links, if changes are needed.  If I change the throttle links,
then check to see that the throttle plates come to rest on the stops.  If
they don't, then what?  I guess its a compromise, that is what a flow
bench would do for syncing.  One could play with different settings easier
than with the plates being on the car.

Subject: 911 Search Humor

 
Peter Diffey gave us his analysis of buying a 912 at 8K, selling for 20K, or
buying at 20K selling at 25K. I ran into one of these situations last
Monday. I looked at a 356, advertised as "runs, drives & looks great, orig.
body & eng., compl. car, new red paint/blk int., garaged for several years
while upgraded, asking $6000 or best offer." I had already been warned about
this car by a friend who had been offered same several months earlier, but
just for grins I went by the place anyway. The owner was in Arizona and had
a friend show the car.
 
The best way to describe the bodywork was "artfully sculpted." There was at
least a half inch of plastic filler EVERYWHERE I looked, as if the whole
thing had been dipped in a vat of the stuff like a giant chocolate-covered
cherry. If one looked at the fender lips, they were a half inch thick; the
holes for the nerf bars (replacing bumpers) also showed half inch "tunnels."
The dash had been covered over by a plastic plate with all aftermarket
instruments. The engine ran but ran lousy, with Webers instead of Solex and
the f**cked-up throttle linkage common to every 356 Weber conversion I've
ever seen. For this he wanted 6K.
 
Owner called yesterday.
"Did you look at the car?"
Yup.
"Whaddya think?"
Well, it's pretty bad, isn't it?
[Chortle] "Well, I guess so..."
There isn't a salvageable item on the car except the engine. Even the body
doesn't have any clips or panels that can be used on other cars.
"Well, it runs pretty good."
I can give you $900 for it. You can keep the body, I'll take the engine."

... on the old wives tales.  At very low RPM, the fuel burns before
the piston has moved much past top dead center.  This means that the
cylinder pressures are higher (if you are at full throttle) and the
ring seal and bearing loads are high.  This of course means wear, even
with new oils.  It is OK to be at low RPM and low throttle, but if
you want to accelerate out, shift down and use the engine in its
design range.
... hirth crankshafts were only on early speedsters along with a chain
driven overhead cam head.  They were marvels of machining that could
be disassembled to remove the bearings.  They didn't like high
cylinder pressures either, but they weren't intended for daily

Subject: 911E trip (long)

Dear Porschephiles,

I'd like to share a Holiday trip in the 1971 911E coupe. We here in
Missouri have enjoyed a mild fall/early winter. Since there has been no
salt applied to the roads yet the 911 has not been placed into
hibernation.

Yesterday morning Betsy mentions we have to bring an appetizer to a
Christmas Day dinner. She asks if I'd be up for a trip to Herman Mo.
Amongst other things, Herman has an excellent German resturant in one of
the many wineries there. Herman was sits along a hilly stretch of the
Missouri River about 75 miles west of St. Louis. The town was founded
before the Civil War by a band of German immigrants who claimed this
site reminmded them of their beloved Rhine Valley. The resturant is
known for its fabulous home made pate. This is a win-win-win
situation... a chance for a nice diner in a peaceful setting, acquisition
of a great apetizer (and some nice local wine) AND an opportunity to
exercise the P-car!

The temperature during the trip was in the low to upper 30s. After 800
plus miles I reckoned the new Yoko AVS-Is were now broken in and I
adjusted the tire pressure to 32 front/34 rear. The starting procedure
for the MFI eqipped 2.2 l is the same at 35 deg and 95 deg - turn the
key and let the fuel pressure build up; pull the hand throttle all the
way up and crank the starter for about 15 seconds (the motor will not
start); wait ten seconds or so and crank again; now the motor will catch
immediately and the hand throttle is set for about 2k rpm. The 911
engine is now emitting copious amounts of water vapor (and a bit of oil
smoke as well I'm sure) and at this stage it runs a bit rough. After
about two to three minutes of this the rpms jump to 4-5k and I reset the
hand throttle for 2k again. Now the engine is running rougher but not
for long as the rpms increase again and it's time to motor off (after
resetting the hand throttle a smooth 1.5K rpms. This exercise goes
quicker at warmer temperatures but the basic drill is the same. Before I
crank the engine Betsy always yells "contact" as she claims the 911 is
as complicated to start and louder than a Cessna 150.

I keep the revs below 4K as we drive along the Missouri River bottoms
(this piece of road was 6 to 20 feet under water during the great floods
of 93) toward I-70. By the time we reach the Interstate the engine has
warmed up to just below 180 deg. I'm all alone on the long clover-leaf
sweeper entrance ramp and I take the engine up to 5.5k for the first
time. The 911 is a joy to drive as the acceleration, cornering Gs and
engine note all increase simulatneusly. Traffic is heavy and I leave the
car in third gear. Traffic is heavy as we are in a holiday diluted
version of rush hour. I keep the 911 in third gear and begin to weave ny
way across six lanes of traffic towards the left most lane. With the
Valintine-One on alert I shift into fourth gear at 80 mph indicated
(about 70 actual). The 911 engine is a freeway dream in third gear. You
are in a good place on the torque/HP curve and the quick response of the
MFI lets yu claim the patch of highway you want. Before long the engine
temperature has stabilized at exactly 180 deg indicated. I shift up into
fourth and watch the oil pressure run settle to just below  at 60 psi 
indicated at about 3700 rpm and wait for the traffic to thin out as we
head west. Traffic thins and the speed limit increases to 65. I
downshift into third and run the engine up to 5500 rpms and then back to
fourth at 4,000 rpms. The oil pressure now is right at 60 psi. 

Keeping the interior warm is no problem at all. I guess the new driver's
side SS heat exchanger was a good move. I never used the fan. Except for
some brief downshifts to third for passing, the 50 or so miles down I-70
is very routine and the constant engine note of the engine is pleasant
and reassuring. We exit I-70 at Mo. route 19 and head south. I take
the second gear to redline and settle down to 60 mph on this dark, two
lane road. The H-4 healights throw out an impressive high beam pattern.
I have never seen so far ahead.

Rt. 19 has gentle curves and hills. About halfway to Herman there is
trouble. Three cars are pulled over on the shoulder on our side of the
road and people are standing around. We slow way down and sadly note
someone has collided with a deer. Less than 5 minutes down the road the
H-4s illuminate three deer crossing the road as I enter a left hand
curve.I jump hard on the brakes. The 911 stops quickly with just a bit
of driver's side rear wheel lock up. The dear scamper into the woods and
we make it into Herman and enjoy a pleasant and delicious German
holiday dinner.

The trip home was uneventful. The 911 engine was smooth and lively. The
car did not seem fast at 75 mph. I topped up the tank with fuel (you
nevr know when it will snow/ice and have to put the car away). I
computed 21 mpg during the trip which was spent mostly at 4k rpms.

This trip was a Christmas bonus. The next visit to herman will have to
be during daylight hours so I can take the long way (two lane roads
winding through the woods the whole way.

Best wishes to all P-philes during the Holiday season and here's hoping
you all have a safe  Porsche-filled 1995.

This reminds me of something I'd really like: parts and manuals on CDROM.
Rather than get my precicious service manual dirty I xerox the section of

CDROM wouldn't cost any more to make than fiche and would not need the

Subject: Sex and Christmas Eve



Lots of P'hilers have talked about their cat, so I thought I mention mine.
His name is Sex. Oh I know, it's an unusual name - my Uncle gave him to me
with that name when I was nine years old. I've had Sex ever since.

When Sex was a couple years old (I was was eleven), I took him to the vet
for some shots. "I'd like to give Sex a shot," I told the vet. "Yeah, you
and all the other kids you run around with - you're too young." No, no, I
protested - "Sex is my cat!" After I explained, he gave Sex a shot.

As I grew older, Sex became beautiful, so I took him in the Porsche to a cat
show at Cal Expo and told the organizer I had to go to an SVR autocross at
2:00 p.m. and wanted to have Sex on the stage no later than noon. "Great,"
he said, "I'll sell more tickets." "That would be fine," I replied, "just so
long as I have Sex on the stage during Channel 31 coverage of the show."
"Sex on TV", he exclaimed - "Sure, why not? It's on pay TV all the time."

Many years later, when my wife and I got divorced, we split-up the property
during the proceedings in court. "I don't care what she gets, so long as I
get Sex," I said. "I've had Sex since I was nine years old." "This isn't a
confessional - keep your testimony to relevant issues," the judge
threatened. She got the Porsche, I got Sex. I thought it was a good deal.

Sex used to be an outside cat, but lately I've had Sex indoors all the time.
But last night around midnight, the cat got out and I had to go up and down
the neighborhood alleys looking for my pet. Unfortunately, a Sacramento
County Sheriff patrol stopped me and asked what I was doing in the alley.
"Looking for Sex," I replied. My case come up next Friday.

But, I'm going to have Sex Christmas eve, so the holidays will be great. I
hope you all have a happy holiday season, too.

My experience buying 914's reveals that there are two basic types
that are offered for sale:

The $2,000 914.  This is a daily driver that has been beat to sh*t.
You're usually lucky if you find a part on it that *doesn't* need
replacing.

The $4,000 914.  This is a car that some fool (like myself) bought
for $2,000, then replaced everything, and at $4,000 is loosing more
money than he will ever admit.

How does one test an oil cooler for leaks on a 2.0L 911? I'm not sure if the
oil cooler itself is leaking or just everything else.....The engine is out
of the car so it can be removed if necessary.

Subject: Really need my porsche now

So I have really been enjoying the option of driving the Mark & Fred 
jointly owned 914 racecar on a day to day basis, much more fun than my 
Legend.

But, this morning, the gremlins got me: The very sturdy looking 100 year 
old maple in front of my house fell down and landed, you guessed it, 
right on the hood of the Legend. Hood gone, front qtr panels gone, 
windshield gone...expect 1 month at the body shop. Car is sturdy: I drove 
it there, no other damage, which is truly amazing. Glad the 914 wasnt 
hit, it might not have made it through 10 tons (my guess) sitting on it!

And very glad that the tree fell out -- away from the house -- not in 
towards  the house.

No more option for me: Glad we put the heater boxes back in etc.

Do you know that the bearings are standard? Have you measured them, or are
just going by what it says on the box? If for some reason they were mixed
up, you may have a wrong size in the set- that would cause binding. Check
the bearing dowels-if one is longer than it should be it would pinch the
bearing. Also, if the engine has had an over-revved, hard life, the case
material around #2 bearing may be fretted, and actually worn away so that
it is oval shaped. If this happens it will pinch the bearing when you
torque the studs around #2. Assemble the case with the cam and #2 bearings
installed but no crank. You can check the cam for free rotation and use a
flashlight to check for light through the crack between the case halves
(look through the hole that the crank comes through at the fan end while
shining the light from the flywheel end) around #2. Significant light
(there really should be none) would indicate a need for an align bore.
ASSUMING that the bearings are correct.
	An assembly hint: when tightening the case halves twist the rotor
to move the crank back and forth a little. If it begins to bind at all you
will notice it quickly this way, and its a lot easier than rotating the
assembly.

Good luck and Happy Holidays,
Eric

The original post did not speak to shift points -- 4,000 sound reasonable
as a shift point -- YMMV depending on the car. On the other hand, holding
a steady 4,000 in 2nd and 25 mph would be silly.

In issue #1029 Peter Rosvall (Rosvall@nbnet.nb.ca) asked about testion the

I have a 914 but I assume some similarities.  Therefore, the advice remains 
the same: oil coolers *don't* leak, oil cooler seals *do*.  If the seals are 
suspect it may be cheaper and easier to simply replace them -- especially if 
they're old.

You could, of course, obtain a leak kit (from J.C. Whitney or just about 
anywhere) that uses phosphorescent dye to detect the leak.  Clean the engine 
compartment, dump the dye in the oil, idle the engine for a while, turn on 
an ultraviolet light and look for the glow.  The kit is fairly cheap as I 
recall and can test for oil, transmission, coolant and whatever other leaks 
you may have.  (Maybe not all of them.  I've never tried them on the cat ;-) )

Subject: Porsche, BMW factory tour 

 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monty,

I took some notes during the Porsche and BMW factory tour and I thought I would
send the info over for you to read. 

The Porsche Factory in Zuffenhausen (Stuttgart). 

The tour had around 8 people in each group, one english and one german speaking
.
It lasted around 1 1/2 hours. One gentlemen from the U.S showed up without a
reservation for the tour but was allowed to attend. The tour guide made a point
of saying they normally don't allow people without a reservation. One couple in
my group was picking up a new Porsche. I attempted to take some notes during th
e
tour and here is what I wrote down.

Production quantity per day 
80 of the 911  model six cylinder  cars (The  new 993 model) 
8 of the 968 model four cylinder cars
2 of the 928 model eight cylinder  cars
12 of the Audi S4 Avant (station wagon) with modified five cylinder 315 HP
engines and Porsche brake system.(There was a nice blue one parked nearby)
12 of the 500E modified Mercedes sedans

The tour guide in his heavy German accent mentioned that Porsche has built over
1 million cars since the first car built in 1948. He said "If someone tries to
sell you a Porsche older than 1948, don't buy it". He commented there are
approximately 850 thousand Porsches still around with 600 thousand being  drive
n
on a daily basis. 

Porsche has recently revamped their production facility with the help of a
japanese consultant incorporating the japanese kanban (just in time) system
which reduced the 911 assembly time from 120 hours to around 80 hours. The
entrance to the factory has a display with a engine block, crankshaft, rods and
pistons for the 968 , 911, and 928 with graphs showing the HP and Torque output
s
for each engine. The guide made a point of boasting about how large the 4
cylinder displacement is and how the new engines have more HP and are more fuel
efficient etc.  The 911 engine assembly line is U shaped with a slow moving
conveyor system that moves the engine past many assembly stations. The moving
conveyor  holds the engine during assembly and has two moving racks next to eac
h
engine that hold all the larger pieces required to assemble the engine.
Previously the engine assembly person worked from a fixed position and had to
walk back and forth to a parts bin and select each part. The engine assembly
workers are rotated around to each assembly station and every worker is capably
of assembling the complete engine from start to finish. It takes 2 hours to
build the 4 cylinder engine, 3 hours to build the six cylinder 911 engine, and 
4
hours to build the 8 cylinder 928 engine. They mentioned that each crankshaft
journal is color coded and has several different size bearings available t
blueprint the engine clearances (similar to the Honda engines). Each engine is
tested on a dyno for a total of 32 minutes. Our group was able to see one of th
e
911 engines being tested on the dyno. The engine is warmed up for 20 minutes an
d
checked for leaks or abnormal noises and then run at 5000 RPM to check the
torque output and then raised to 6100 RPM to check the horsepower output. The
engine is inside a small room and the operator works behind a glass panel and h
e
has a large lever that controls the throttle.  The horsepower output must be
within 2% on the lower range (270 horsepower nominal) or the engine is  checked
to find the reason for the low horsepower. They indicated that the average
output is closer to 280 HP.  They have 15 engine test beds (dynos) to handle th
e
different engines they produce. It was amazing seeing so many 911, 928 and 968
engines in various stages of assembly. The amount of $$ in that one area was
staggering. We then headed for the final assembly area. 

The final assembly area is located in a different building and is not very larg
e
with two rows of 911 vehicles passing by us at chest height on conveyor. He
pointed out the subtle differences between the U.S. versions and cars for
Germany and other countries (center mounted brake light U.S. and side marker
lights for Europe etc). We walked past racks of various vehicle parts, painted
brake calipers etc. The vehicle final assembly process is done by a 6 person
team.  The completed engine and transmission assembly (engine, transmission and
front differential on 911 C4 vehicles) is installed as one unit in under 5
minutes. Porsche makes available an option which has buttons mounted in the
steering wheel to control shifting with  their optional Tip-tronic
semi-automatic gear box. The guide mentioned that Porsche allows the customer t
o
select custom colors for  both the interior and exterior of the car, (for an
extra fee of course). So if you want to purchase a car that matches your wife's
finger nail polish you can bring in a sample and Porsche will take care of the
rest.  There are over 2000 colors available with this system. It takes 2-3 days
to paint the car, with the color spraying of the car still being done by hand
without the aid of a robot. Only the primer and undercoating is done by a robot
.
This allows the paint to sprayed in different proportions in certain areas of
the car that need it.  After the car is built it is test driven by professional
drivers on public roads for 60-80 Km to ensure every system is working
correctly. This is done all year round even when there is snow and ice on the
roads. The tour guide pointed out that the 911 car does 0-200 Km (~125 MPH) in
20 seconds and 200 to 0 under braking in 5.7 seconds. The brakes have 5 times
the power output of the engine! He said "You must be very careful when followin
g
a Porsche on the Autobahn because of the superior braking system. Most Porsche
drivers are rear-ended by cars with inferior brakes".

950 3 Series cars produced each day
900 engines built each day , 6 cylinder, 8 cylinder, 12 cylinder , M3 and M5
engines are produced in Munich. 
The 4 cylinders and diesel engines (1700 each day) are produced in Styria,
Austria. 

The tour began in the metal or body part fabrication area. The steel 
arrives in large rolls where it is then cut into individual sheets. Four to
seven pressing operations (with unique dies) are required to make each body
part. Each die that is inserted into the hydraulic press weighs 25 tons and is
the size of a king-size bed (3 ft thick) and costs $325,000 each. There is a
large overhead crane that is used to transport the dies into the presses. The
Munich factory uses over 500 dies to make all the required body parts. The
hydraulic presses used to stamp out the body parts are two stories tall and 20
ft wide and weigh 300 tons. There are 6 or 7 presses lined up in a row with
automated feeders that pick up the sheet steel and transfer it to the next
pressing operation. Workers are used to remove and stack the finished parts. Th
e
hydraulic presses use 600 - 2000 tons of pressure to stamp out the body parts.
They process over 100 tons of steel per day. The next part of the tour included
a video showing the paint process and the body welding process. BMW affixes a
microwave transponder to each body that transmits data on each cars particular
needs and changes. It is also used to track material flow through the entire
system. It takes 7 1/2 hours to weld the entire body. The welding process is 95
%
automated using 275 Kuka robots. The paint process is  completely automated wit
h
the exception of the 2nd  primer coat. It takes 10 hours to paint the entire
car. There are 2 shifts at the plant. They have teams of 4 persons who do the
assembly process. It takes 1min and 20 seconds to install the windshield. The
windshield has the rubber adhesive installed on it, then it is delivered  to th
e
workers who lift it and put it in place. Each assembly station uses around a 1
min and 30 second cycle time. They currently have use over 500 suppliers. There
are over 20 thousand parts per car. 15% of the cars weight is from plastic
parts. It takes around 2 hours to build the engines. Each engine is tested for
10 minutes. The engine and transmission are installed as a unit in 1 minute and
25 seconds. They have one person in a room doing the PROM burn for each cars
unique engine, transmission and Brake system controller. The cars utilize a
plastic intake manifold and a plastic gas tank located in front of the rear axl
e
for safety. The total assembly time for a BMW is around 30 hours. This compares
with 18-20 Hrs. for U.S. and Japanese cars. After being assembled the car is
driven off the line and into a room where it is run on a dyno to check engine,
transmission and braking functions. The operator using a computer monitor to
prompt him through the individual tests. The BMW tour was the longest (2 1/2
hrs) and the most complete. The only thing missing was the engine assembly. The
tour guide mentioned that special tours (ie. engine assembly) are available upo
n
request.

Subject: DuPont Centari Paint - my .02


I've used Centari paint on 6 or so cars - the latest for repainting
the front spoiler and rear bumperettes on an early 911.

I like it because the "system" is good, starting with Epoxy primer
that is hard as rocks and water-tight. I used the urethane modified
hardner system and while I agree with Peter that it isn't the same
as Sikkens or Glasurit, but it's readily available, easy to spray
and very durable. You do need to heat dry the paint for maximum
hardness.

My only criticism is that it is a little too glossy looking in a
"plasticky" sort of way. However, after the paint is thoroughly dry 
(a couple of months) you can buff out the paint with Meguires or 
another very light buffing compound and it looks fantastic.

Subject: [Q] '87 924S Fuel Leak (Tank?)

After filling up (maybe overfilling) when almost empty, the rear started
dripping *BAD* around/behind the passenger rear wheel/fuel nozzle
area. Drip Drip Drip -- like a badly leaking faucet. In an hour it made
a spot about 13 inches around. 

The car was garage kept by the PO and by me. It was moved from So.Calif.
to Atlanta in Sept. This is its first winter, though the temp. has not
been really low yet.

If only someone had dropped a match. What would a fire in a 6 story 
garage do to an attached 40 story building? It wasnt too hard to get
a bunch of construction workers to push me out. They didn't seem to want
me to start it either... 

So I took it to Jim Ellis Porsche, Atlanta's local monopolist.  They
have been nice, but slow. They've had it 4-5 days now but complain 
that a lot of their mechanics take time off around now (funny, that). 

Last I heard, they were going to lower the fuel tank ($300 or so labor)
and see if I needed another one. Can both metal and plastic tanks be
repaired (e.g. welding, chemical goo) or just one or the other? Welding
on something that used to be filled with gasoline sounds like fun. :-|
Fuel tanks were like $800-900 new, $400 used.

So, here are my questions:

This is the first major work the shop in Atlanta has done. How much
of this sounds reasonable ? Prices ? I expect them to make money, but
in Pasadena I found I paid within 20-25% of the market price, sometimes
better -- on the parts.

What sorts of simple things could this be ? It apparently only leaks
when very full. It stopped leaking, according to the shop, after a short 
while. I'm kind of hoping for a hose or some sort of overflow device...
As soon as it is filled, it starts up again...

Also, are the fuel level gauges just complete trash? Is it possible to
get one that reads accurately across the scale.  Is this a good time
to do that cheaply?

Thanks

Well, now, why can't there be performance/reliability 
differences?

Rumors abound that the Japanese , when they make a Dodge
Eagle or Whatever "clone" used to tune down the engine.

In addition, other parts might be somewhat different. Maybe
they do QC and sell the 1st rate cars as Itsy-Bitsys (oops,
Mitsubishi) and send the lemons to their American partner.


I don't know -- I'm just perpetuating certain rumors.

Does anyone know for sure? Anyone want to go buy both and
take them apart :-) Just curious.

This isn't much about Porsches -- the Europeans dont seem to be

Subject: re; Centari (acrylic enamel) as a paint choice


       For some reason, a lot of top painters still prefer Acrylic enamel
    over urethanes, even on jobs where cost (of the materials) isn't
    a consideration; and I've also wondered why.

      Guys who use acrylics generally add a -lot- of hardener and also 
    clearcoat. The clearcoat isn't an acrylic, its a urethane; strength
    of acrylic paint relies on the pigments put into it, an acrylic clear 
    would have no strength; witness an older laquer job (cracking away)
    and you'll see. I don't know the difference between that kind of clear 
    urethane and the Glasurit or Imron type urethanes.
      Straight acrylics enamels get gloss in the very top layer of the
    paint; unlike a lacquer or the Glasurit/Sikkens/Deltron urethanes, you
    can't buff down a layer and still get any gloss. The hardener apparently  
    helps that, when I was painting with Centari usage of hardener wasn't that
    popular yet, but it still didn't keep the gloss after buffing. 
         
      My own suggestion is that changing the type of paint is only okay
    for an overall paint job, or to add some accessory (like a spoiler)
    thats likely not to match anyways. It never makes sense to change the
    type of paint for a panel repair. Glasurit and Deltron make for
    fantastic, extremely durable paint jobs, and they are the 2 paints I'll 
    continue to use; but if the work of the shop you've picked looks great
    with Centari, they just may know what they're doing...

Subject: Cam Tower (911) leak?

I see that only few of us on the net this week, I have a pressing need
to confer with my friends. I decided to put a deposit on a 1988 Carrera:
very low miles (25,000) car, excellent cosmetic condition, drives well with
some front shimmy. I lifted the car (brought my shop jack) no signes of any
suspension problem; located a large screw in front tire! 

I did notice oil saturated left cam/chain cover. My guess is that there is 
some leak from the cam tower oil line. If this was a long standing problem
are there any "side-affects" other than possible loose tensioner?? The
oil pressure was high (4-5 at 4000-5000 rpm). I remember hearing about an 
update to the left cam oil line.. does that ring a "bell"?      

The seller was going to take it to his mechanic to have that "attended" to.
Any porschephilers in south New Jersey... is there a good shop to take the car
to (Marlton/Hammonton area)?? Thus far I did my own prepurchase Inspection :-O

May all the Joys of the Holiday Season be Yours Today and Always.

Subject: RE: To Sleeve or not to Sleeve


Hi there,

You have two choices if indeed the cylinder wall is damaged.  The first is
overbore the block, re-etch the cylinder wall surface, then equip it with
oversize pistons and rings.  The pistons and rings are available from
Porsche.  I am not sure whether you can do a single cylinder without
doing them all, for weight and balance reasons.  The workshop manual
should call this out.

The second choice, as you've pointed out, is to overbore then use a
cast iron sleeve.  If you do this, you have to use a different kind of ring
because of the wall material difference.

I don't know who in the US is set up to do the etching, or work in general.
I know that there is a place in Toronto which does it.  I would get in touch
with two people who will have the answers.  First is Dave Truax at Andial,
714 957 3900, second is Jon Milledge at 617 834 3932.  I think Dave knows
people on the west coast who are set up to do the work.

If you decide to go with a good used block, give some thought to finding
one from '89 forward.  Porsche upgraded the oil galley size from 5 to 7
mm in 85.5, doubling the cross section and improving the oil flow.  It is
said that there remained a flaw in the passge geometry which was
responsible for #2 conn rod wear.  Apparently the flaw could cause
cavitation or some other effect which led to an air pocket at that location.
I personally don't know whether there is an updated block, and the part
number may not reflect it.  I also don't know how much of an "urban legend"
this #2 conn rod business is.

Let me know how it turns out.

    My sentiments exactly!  I purchased my first 914 (about 3,000 bucks).  
    It was non-original blue, didn't shift well, had a ratty interior and 
    had the rear trunk welded on were it had been hit. 3 weeks later found 
    my current car, a 74 914 Ltd Edition.  It is original black, had race 
    harnesses ($250), Bilstein's ($500), front mounted oil cooler with 
    steel braided line($900 installed, have receipt), A008 tires ($500 
    installed) , fire extingusher, perfect interior, strong engine, and 
    good transmission.  I bought it with a credit card check ($4,500) and 
    sold the first car (for 300 bucks more than I paid for it!) and drove 
    my first time trial about two weeks later.  I felt very lucky, because 
    I dodged a big buck bullet by selling the first car in less than a 
    month.
    
    The point is, your car is out there, waiting for you to eagerly search 
    the Auto Trader, classified ads, Panorama, and local Porsche shops.  
    You should spend your time researching what you want (two months?) and 
    then purchasing a finished car that someone has put way too much money 
    into only to now decide he wants a 911 or 944 Turbo.  Your car is out 
    there, but only if you are willing to do the research and buy with 
    confidence.

This would be an important time to remind everyone that the 911 makes a fine

I have 3 smallish children, 4,6,&8, and generally they prefer to ride in the

damn fine navigator on rallies or road trips.

Our PCA region (SVR) did a tour to Eureka from Sacramento this year, and we 
managed to fit the four of us and all of our camping gear and food in the

The 4 year old thought it was a race, and consequently would keep me

Don't think you can actually do it this way.  Unless the 84+ cars are

I didn't bother.  just disconnect the battery, and plan on a little fuel
leaking out (not much) which you can catch in a cup if you want to.
I think there is a process outlined in the manual for bleeding air from
fuel lines.

I made up a dolly w/2x4's and castors, with the rear wheels and axles

Subject: HELP! '72 911S CD box weak spark

Hi, Thanks for reading this.

My '72 911S has a weak spark, much weaker than a friend's '69 E with
the same type of CD ignition. If I pull a connector off the distributor cap,
the spark is not strong and will not travel far to the connector (the length
of the spark should indicate voltage). I have 2 CD boxes and they both
seem about the same (1 may be slightly stronger).

I swapped "coils" with this friend's car and it did not help.

I measured the current flow as stated in the manual, and it was OK,
about 2 amps I think to the CD box.

I have some electrical knowledge, and know that most capacitors dry out
after about 10 years and will no longer work like they used to. I tried
opening one of my CD boxes to see if I could replace some capacitors,
but after a while the wiring was too tight. They are not made to be
rebuilt yourself! The wiring is very primitive.

Normal consensus has been that if your CD box "whistles" then it is OK.
But I think that it is not a good/bad situation, there is some weak area.

I can not use an aftermarket product due to SCCA Stock class rules, so
need to keep the Bosch CD box and points (yuk).

1) Is there anything else I can check to see if the problem is
somewhere else than the CD box?

2) Is it possible that my CD boxes are weak because they are over 20
years old?

3) If so, could anyone recommend where I could get one rebuilt?
I have seen that someplace advertised rebuilding these CD boxes, but not too
cheap.

Thanks for any help!

This was not necessary for my 71 911E, despite what it said in the Haynes
and Porsche factory workshop manuals. They even provide a little drawing
similar to the diagram above showing you how to fabricate the special 
spacers.

The manuals say you need to do this in order to disconnect the clutch
release lever from the throwout bearing, which is attached to the engine.

I tried to buy some of these special spacers at the local Porsche garage
and they said they had never heard of them, and told me to do the following:

Stick a long screwdriver through the inspection holes in the tranny bell
housing and rotate the throwout bearing until the flat spots line up
with the retainers, then you can separate the release lever from the
bearing. 

Worked fine.

You may have to push gently on the release lever in order to
permit the throwout bearing to rotate, but I did NOT have to compress
the springs of the clutch pressure plate.

Subject: RE: Cam Tower (911) leak?


Jascha,

Dunno about an upgraded part, could be.  It is not uncommon to see leaking,
and the fix is pretty simple.  You should clean the area, run the engine, 
and
see exactly what is leaking.  If it's the rubber hose or there is a crack in 
the
metal line or fittings, replace them.  If it is simply a leak at one of the 
union
bolts or the ferrule, I would reseal the union bolt (new seal rings), or 
take
apart and inspect the ferrule fitting, replace if damaged.

Any damage would have to come, I believe, from a loss of tension in the
chain.  As part of the pre-purchase, you ARE going to have the engine
leak-down tested, no?  If that's fine, and it runs well (ie, hasn't jumped a
sprocket tooth!), enjoy.  I suppose that in an extreme case, you could lose
lubrication to the top end.  But if you just have a little leaking and not a
catastrophic failure, I think you're OK.

Subject: Repairing old 911 Door Pockets

I repaired (rebuilt might be a better way to put it) the very 
sagging, somewhat torn and terribly forlorn door pockets 
on my 911 last week, and thought some of you might be 
interested in how easy it was.  

The cardboard material they are made of is impregnated 
with a resin that softens when heated, can easily be 
shaped, and then holds its new shape when cooled.  Just 
remove the vinyl (Pop out the staples and peel it off.), and 
use a few clamps and bailing wire to force the pocket into 
its original shape.  Heat it in an oven if your wife will let 
you, or keep the peace and do what I did.  Heat it with a 
Bernz-O-Matic torch equipped with the flare tip they 
come with.  

You'll be able to feel the cardboard softening so you'll 
know when to stop the heat.

Release the clamps and wire, and the pocket is back to 
normal.  If you didn't apply enough heat (It's best to err 
on the side of caution...) just reclamp and reheat.

Mine had a several tears in the cardboard which I 
repaired with a layer of fiberglass.

You can reuse the old vinyl, or cut a new piece.  I used 
new material, and glued it on with 3M Vinyl Adhesive.  (I 
had a bunch left over from installing the carpet.  It's the 
best stuff for the purpose that I know of.)  3M  trim 
cement would work as well.

At $300 or more a pair, it's worth giving it a shot.

Why?  My engine has 92,000 miles on it.  At about 70,000 miles I put
1,000 miles of hard track miles on at Portland International Raceway.
It has never had bottom end work or top end work and doesn't need it.
My mechanic (and his family) don't like me because I'm having them
rebuild the engine all the time, the like me because Porsche parts
are expensive. :-)  Actually, they like me because we are all Porsche
(and VW) enthusiasts.

You have this mistaken impression that anything over 2500 is abusing
an engine.  You are wrong, especially when it comes to Porsche 911
engines.

Porsche has a well deserved reputation of building engines which last.
Maybe that is why they have won so many endurance races.

Everyone has said that you can't or don't do it this way and I know the

I'd like to see this.  When I did mine, two of the studs holding the tranny
and block together were unreachable with the stuff installed.  Maybe they
lower the engine/tranny a bit ?  I also had a devil of a time getting the
two bits apart once they were out and the nuts removed - lots of wiggling
back and forth and prying with a persuader - don't see how you could
do this with them both in the car.

Happy Holidays All!

I read a request from someone - I apologize I deleted some previous
p-file digests....it was a request for prices seen on nice early
short-wheel base 911s, maybe even a '66?

Anyway, I saw a VERY clean, white, all original - never restored,
'66 911, with alloys, all around beautiful.  Having recently welded
in just about every replacement piece of sheetmeal possible on
my '66 912, I think I've got a good idea of where rust can form,
and this car was clean.

The person was asking $8900 or best offer, ran like a champ.  I wanted
to just sit there and cry - it seemed very cheap to me.  If I had
the $$, I would have bought it.


Happy Hunting!

What sort of leaks are these? Do you have puddles of oil and/or water under
the car? Do you have oil in your water or water in your oil? What is the
compression like in the eight cylinders? Is the car overheating? Is the oil
pressure low? If the oil is comtamenated or its pressure is low or the car
is overheating, then it would not be a good idea to continue driving it.

Question for the list: do 928s have oil/water heat exchangers like the 944?
The oil cooler on the 944 is a common source of oil/water mixing when its
gaskets fail.

I understand from a friend (list member Jim Harriger) that R and R'ing 928
heads is a major bitch because of the tight working spaces. It would almost
be easier to pull the engine than to RnR the heads in the car. If it is 
in fact a
head gasket, then $1500 may not be too far off, about $300 in parts and 16
hours of labor.

FWIW, I just had to replace the head gasket on my 944. Cylinder one's
combustion products were leaking into the water jacket which was causing
loss of water and overheating. The head was warped and had to be
milled. I did the RnR myself and took the head to a machine shop for its
servicing (had the valves done while it was there).

Good luck!

Subject: Pilot Bearing

Chris-
You'll need to press the pilot bearing out, and a new one in.

A simple way is to find a socket that just fits the bearing,
and use it as a "drift" to gently hammer the old one out and
the new one in.  That is, put the socket up against the
bearing, and hammer on the socket.

Also, I find it real easy to take out the 911 engine (yes,
with the transmission, it's the only way) by simply jacking
up the car and putting jackstands under the torsion bars on
each side, removing the license plate valence, and then putting
a floor jack under the engine.  I bought a big jack from 
the local outo parts store for about $100.

It's nice to have a helper to stabilize the engine on
the jack as you lower it and slide it out the rear.  My
wife helps me.  It doesn't require strength, just a hand
on the engine to make sure it stays level and doesn't tip
from side to side.  If the jack's in the right spot, it's
pretty stable.  In fact, I don't need her help to
reinstall it.  It's a one man operation.

Hope this helps.

It's hard to second-guess over the 'net, but your shop sounds like they are
chasing the wrong thing, and on your nickle.  If the leak is as you describe
it, I would look at the plumbing in and around the fuel filler, incl. the 
expansion
tank.  As far as I know, this requires some disassembly of your car's
interior around the filler neck.

Absent other information, I would *not* start by dropping the fuel tank, 
which
takes quite a bit of time (remove transmission, etc.).  Nor does it sound to 
me
like you have a bad fuel tank.

This is a pretty common upgrade.  You can also go with the latest version 
mechanical tensioners, and then use limiters.

I've heard (I'd appreciate clarification on this) that the Carrera 
tensioners are designed to operate at a lower average oil pressure, due to 
the fact (?) that Carreras operate at a lower average pressure than the 
earlier cars.  (Is this true, or is the sensor just in a different location 
in the system?)  I've heard of 2 cases where the pressure-fed tensioners 
failed in an older 911, due to excess pressure.  I've also heard that you're 
crazy for NOT going with the pressure-fed tensioners.  So what's the real 
story, folks?

It's been a couple of years now but this was the basic flow:
 -  We disconnected everything related to the engine, the bolts holding the 
trans/engine together(except one or two that you can't get to) and the shift 
linkage up in the tunnel, and, with the engine resting on the floor jack, 
took out the two engine mount bolts; now the trans/engine combo pivots down 
as the car is raised
 -  Then you raise the car enough so that you can get to the couple of bolts 
at the top of the trans/engine
 -   I don't remember it being a major problem breaking the two apart (a pry 
bar was used to help with the initial separation while wiggling).  Wiggling 
back and forth as the two separated was required;  we also would lift/lower 
the car slightly to obtain a better relationship between the engine/trans as 
they separated and help with the wiggling.

I went through this 3 times in a six month period, it got easier every time 
and it takes about have the amount of time that it does the "normal" way. 
  I'm sure I've forgotten steps since then...maybe Bruce, Stan, etc could 
fill in the gaps.  Actually, in a month or so I'll be replacing the clutch 
and can give an update...really, I'd like to know if this is a bad method 
before I start the clutch project!!

It's all in the synchronizers. Yes, there are synchronizers on first gear,
but they are worn out. And the ones on second are weak, probably. And
furthermore, you are going to have to learn to double clutch, because it
costs more than you are wiling to spend to have the synchronizers
replaced. The "porsche-design" synchronizer was pretty clever for the
1950's, but it appears to be somewhat inadequate for the 1990's.

Sean,

A bad head gasket will not explain oil leaks.  Look elsewhere.

As to sweating vs. leaking, a little sweating or minor seepage isn't the
end of the world.  When you start losing significant amount of coolant,
like the reservoir gets lower and needs to be topped off more than once
every N months, you need to get it fixed.  Your mechanic can also
test the coolant for exhaust gasses, which is another sign you should get
it fixed.  You can also smell coolant in the exhaust; it gives it a sweet
smell.

With respect to the $1500 cost, why not ask your mechanic why it costs
that much?  S/he should be able to tell you it's so many bucks for parts,
so many bucks for labour.  And yes, they make money on the parts.  I
don't know what book is for a 918 HG.

I believe the head gasket can be done with the engine in the car.  The
$1500 quote has to be for doing it in the car; you don't want to know about
the labour in pulling the engine...

Try double clutching. It works even if the synchro doesn't. Besides, your

To respond to the message of Sean P. Simmen about shifting down to 1st 
gear.  When my '87 944S is cold, ie the trans is still cold, it does not 
like it when I try to downshift to 1st gear with the car moving.  It gets 
much better when the car warms up, but still it resists some.  My '85 Mazda 
626 does not like it shifting to 1st gear while moving period.  But, 
there is an easy way to get around it, called double-clutching 
(double-declutching I guess for the Brits).  Both the Mazda and the 
Porsche will downshift to 1st gear very happily if I double-clutch 
them (again the Porsche will have to warm up before it starts liking 
it).  Try it and just might find yourself wondering how you ever drove 
without double-clutching (at least I did).

Subject: leakdown redux

Hi Folks

I'm still looking for the real scoop on the Leakdown Test.  I understand
the concept: feed pressurized air into cylinder and measure how fast it
leaks past valves, rings, etc.  I even understand some of the details:
regulate shope air to 100 psi, pass thru some kind of flow restrictor,
apply to cylinder, read pressure drop across flow restrictor, and quote
as "leakdown in percent" (the less the better).  Or maybe the flow
restrictor is actually a flow meter, and reads leak rate directly.
Though then you'd think the units would be cc/sec or c.f.m. or some
such.

OK so far?  Here's the question: what is the "flow restrictor/meter"??  
I assume it is either an accurate orifice (maybe a carb jet?) with a
pressure gauge, or a floating-ball sort of flow meter like one sees on a
Uni-Syn or a flow bench.  Does anyone know for sure?

I can only speak from my experience with my '85 911 with 130K miles: it also
does it. I would guess that the first gear synchros are worn. You have two
options- get the transmission rebuilt for mucho $$$ or learn to live with
it. Actually, it's a good incentive to hone your double-clutching skills on
downshifts. With a bit of practice you should be able to execute a 2->1
downshift without a crunch at any speed. (Well, I mean within a reasonable
1st gear speed range - non-redline - of course.)

It's *perfectly* adequate for the '90s. It's just that, as it was in 
the '50s, it wears out in about 10k miles. The BIG difference is that in
the '50s (and '60s and '70s) we didn't have the Million Mile Maintenence-free
Japanese Mechanomonolith telling us that it was *natural* and *normal* to
expect all cars to run essentially forever with no maintenence. 

If you rebuild the transmission every 10-25k miles, to keep everything
in perfect tolerance, you'll be real happy with the performance. If you
want that "perfection" and don't want to do the service, you'll be
real happy with a different breed of car.

Don't feel bad if you at least have syncros left in the higher gears.
Even my 2nd and 3rd gear syncros have been pretty well toasted by an
enthusiastic former owner.

> Is there a way to fix it?

Perhaps someone with a new Porsche can comment on how good the first-gear
syncro can be.

The simplest (and cheapest) solution is to come to a complete stop at stop
signs :-), touch second before you put it into first, and on the occasions 
when you must when you really must downshift into first, very carefully 
double-clutch.

Mike,

Time to go inside!  You've already determined a leakage into the crankcase,
go inside!  Otherwise you'll never know and you don't want to start the
season ignorant.  Your '72 engine isn't too hard to pull out and overhaul.
 Unlikely that you'll need major parts, but plan on some head work, studs,
rings and bearings.  If you're willing to tackle it yourself $'s are not that
bad, I'm amazed at how inexpensive 911 engines are to go through, considering
the quality of the parts.  Just give yourself time (but not too much or
you'll forget where everything goes even with notes).  

Please forgive my ignorance regarding OEM '72 ignition systems and the rules
requirement.  I simply threw the silly thing away on our '73 and replaced it
with breaker points, capacitor and coil (I seem to recall wiring a ballast
resistor to help points life).  The car and engine performed flawlessly
through two seasons of ice (damn coldx to coldx F) racing. If this is an
option, I highly recommend it.  Cheap, revs fine, reliable and simple.

Grayson,

I can see that none of the 911 drivers here are going to convince you that
running a 911 above 2500 RPM is just fine.  If you lug your's along at 2500
RPM you're missing one of the joys of driving a 911 and you're probably
slowly killing it!

Now, I had a Chevy Vega (yeah, I know, I was young, what can I say) a long
time ago that got real cranky when run above about 2800 RPM.  I drove a
glass truck while I was in college that had a Chev 454 with a 4 speed and a
4:27 rear end, I think it redlined somewhere around 5000 RPM (no tach).  I
could smoke the duals through 3rd but it wasn't very happy at high
(relative) RPM's. And I don't think my VW bus will even reach 3000 anymore
at it complains at 70 mph.  These are all vehicles that you *want* to keep
below 3000 RPM either to contain your wallet or your sanity.

But my pride and joy, my Porsche, is not and never has been happy running
consistently under 3000 RPM.  I understand the the early "S" felt downright
doggy at anything below about 4000 RPM (can you S owners verify this?).
They just sound SO SWEET at higher revs!  WOW!

From a practical standpoint, mine has over 150K on it without significant
mechanical problems (for the most part) and only routine maintenance and
she's 23 years old! I will admit that it had a total rebuild (not really
necessary, but since it was apart, why not!) at 110K but that was part of
the early 911 plan anyway.  Later SC's if Bruce Anderson is right, will run
350K without major problems if properly maintained.  Talk about reliable!
I'm sure that most 911 owners will concur that this is the norm.

So do yourself and your Porsche a favor, run it up to redline now and
again.  Enjoy that beautiful Porsche sound.  If you don't like it, sell the
Porsche and get a Chevy with one of those big American V8's.  They're real
happy at 2500 RPM!

I guess I'm ranting here, but driving a 911 is pure passion.  Either you
love it or your don't.  But if you LOVE it, then DRIVE it.

I go to the Pomona Swap Meet now and again.  Usually I come away pretty
satisfied.  I'm currently looking for a set of good Fuchs for my 911.
Though I have no experience with 356 Rescue, I have found that some people
feel that what they have to offer is better than everyone else's stuff.
These guys aren't willing to deal and the best thing to do is walk away.
They only become more secure when you try to cut a deal with them.
Remember, it's their loss, not your's.  If you can't find what you want
from someone else at the show, you can probably get it mail order for about
the same price.  Plus you have the joy (or is that agony) of anticipation
while you wait for FEDEX to bring your part.

Now, if they have that rare part that you REALLY need and you know you
can't find it else where then it's a sellers market and you've got to buck
up and pay the price.  Bartering is then only an exercise in frustration.
They've got you!


Remember those immortal words, "There's a sucker born every minute".  At a
swap meet, I think that's the sellers creed. :->

Subject: 944 farting and engine hessitances


After the theories last week, I had another bout of engine hiccups.

This time I had time to investigate, and rule some things out.

I had driven 50 miles when it started to miss I was doing around 75 mph 
and the tank was 2/3 full, the temp was 3deg C and foggy it had been very 
foggy over night.

The he-he-hessitancy was such that the car stopped pulling for perhaps 1/2
sec every few secs - it was most noticable under slight accelleration,
full throttle seemed OK

I stopped and removed the fuel filler cap, there was no hiss as I 
unscrewed the filler, therefore I don't think it is a blocked breather.

I drove on and the symptoms persisted for the next 30 miles (until I 
reached work)

On the drive home, and in the subsequent 500 miles the car has run fine.

The car has not been spontaniously farting recently so the two things may
not be related. 
 
I am wondering about water in the fuel (over night condensation)

I note the comment last week about DME woes - what is a DME and what does 
it do?

Note - regarding fuel filler caps the original equipment one fitted on my 
car is not vented, it is of screw-in type, the screw section being 
made of pressed steel with no holes.

Nah, in the '50s all the synchronizers had to do was get gearing bits and
pieces adequate for transmitting about 60 hp to spin together. Little
light things, and the synchronizers could last for 100K miles (at least
mine did, on a '59). Now the gearing has to transmit perhaps five times
the torque and hp, and has to be correspondingly heavier, plus on the 928's
we have the inertia of that long
drive shaft contributing to the wear and tear on the synchronizers. It
would be nice to have the transmission brought back up to spec on a
regular basis, but if I could afford that I wouldn't own an '84, would I?
Porsche really could have done better on that particular aspect of the
design.

Subject: Getty dash for 914 & gauge upgrades [longish]


============================================================================

G E T T Y  D A S H

Prior to owning a 914, I recall seeing some 914s in various magazines 
(VW&PORSCHE) with a Getty Design dash that featured the same number of 
gauges as the 911.  I believe there was additional space on the right of 
the gauge enclosure/pod allowing for a larger VDO clock to be installed.   
Right or wrong?  Furthermore, does this aftermarket dash still exist?  If so, 
is it a major hassle to install?

G A U G E S 

Of course by installing the OE 911 sized clock, the console mounted clock 
would be redundant and it would be possible to put something in its place. What 
would be advisable?  Don't say an exhaust gas analyzer gauge ... ;)  
Maybe a second oil temp gauge threaded into an aftermarket deep sump?

I suppose it would also be possible to upgrade the combination gauge to 
the 916/911 style - that included (vertically on the right) OEL DRUCK & 
OEL TEMP (vertically on the left).  This would again eliminate the need for 
another gauge, the 2 1/16" diameter oil temperature gauge mounted in the 
center console (of 2.0 cars), so something else could be fitted in its 
place.  Perhaps a cylinder head temp gauge of the same VDO Cockpit design (just 
an idea).  

However, this different combination gauge would require installing a 
sending unit + wiring for the oil pressure gauge.  Is there an access 
hole somewhere on the case that has been drilled & threads tapped for 
this but is plugged as it is not used?  If not, what would be the procedure 
for installing such a sending unit?    

Please repond if anyone has done any of this or has any other knowledge 
herein.  Thanks.

	On my 40 mph commute to/from work, I often get into 5th gear,
spinning about 1800 to 2500 rmp. The engine is showing no sign of distress
and I can't see any point in using up petrol (at nearly 3 pounds per
gallon!) needlessly. My general rule (remember - this is in traffic, not
when having fun) is to stay in the highest gear which the engine is
comfortable with, but not forgetting the IAM's maxim of being "in the
right place on the road, at the right speed, in the right gear" at all
times.

	In normal driving I also will usually shift up at around 4000 -
sadly this is where the engine is just coming on song, but traffic
conditions usually dictate my acceleration!

	When having fun, I usually change up just before the rev limiter
has its say - is there any problem in bouncing off the rev limiter (I do
it all the time in hire cars!!), or is that what it is there for?

     Early models don't have an oil cooler like this, but at least my brothers
    '84 Euro "S" does have one located in the radiator.

      Getting the heads off an early car is a nightmare job; the problem is
   getting the cam towers off. They are attached to the head with small
   (like 6mm) allen-headed bolts; the bottom row is "accessible" from under
   the car, but the top row is recessed into the cam housing and the access
   hole (you remove a $4 rubber plug) is too small to get in any kind of
   real wrench. I know people have been able to get them out otherwise, but
   on a '79 we pulled the engine.
      I don't know when Porsche changed, but the later models changed from
   that recessed allen-headed bolt to an 8mm bolt accessible from the top
   of the cam tower. If you are going to pull off a cam tower, I'd recommend
   looking into this change of bolts on the way back.

      The common area of coolant leaks for a 928 are bad radiators and bad
   hoses. They are both OEM -crap- and always eventually fail. Usually a bad
   head gasket is the result of one of these that was overlooked and still
   driven on (e.g., brothers' 79 develops a leak, but being "too busy" to fix
   the leak the car gets low on coolant, overheats, then you have r&r on a
   pair of heads and gaskets....).
      $1500 is a frightening but realistic quote for the job. My brother's
   '84 Euro car lost a timing belt (those do hit !) and he got a non-Porsche
   shop to commit to  $550 labor for the job but they really ended up 
   swearing at him in the end....

   Make real sure you really have a bad gasket first -- Lee (ex '79 928)

Get a proper kit - I got mine from AJR - which has two new cam covers, 
gaskets, idler arm spacers (which you may not need), new oil lines for
cam tower, new oil lines from main cam tower oil lines to tensioner,
nuts, washers, tensioners (of course), all fittings etc, BRACES for

There have been changes over time to the shape of the "dish" that sits

  P-philes,

  Adding my "Happy Holidays" to the chorus, from a
  mostly-lurker-new-914-owner-who's-mechanically-inept, and who has at
  several points solicited advice from you.  I've not been part of a better
  group, willing to help out, explaining all sorts of technical points,
  friendly, accessible... I for one am very appreciative, and count this
  list as a valuable resource.

  And, to wrap up a very old thread... several weeks ago I had posted a
  question about a 914 door key cylinder.  I got all sorts of good advice
  from about 7 of you (who I won't name, but you know who you are).
  Printed it out and fixed up the lock with the new cylinder the other day.
  Special thanks to Jerry Brady (jrb@one.com) who UPS'd a lock cylinder to
  my parents' house, sight unseen and without wanting the $$ first.  Trust
  has not yet disappeared from society.  My thanks to all.

  May there be peace...

Subject: high revving


If high revving is better than under revving, then why are Le mans racers
restricted to something like 70% of F1 engine revs.

Cosworth F1 engines are revved to 12-13k where as the same engines when 
fitted to Le Man racers are normally limited to around 8-9k, that is the 
only way they can get them to last 24 hours. It isn't just the engine 
wear itself, but the consequences of high revs ie cracked exhausts, and 
other types of vibration damage. Porsche's may be better balanced, being 
boxers, but the laws of dynamics still apply.

The facts are quite straight forward, car wear is pretty well 
proportional to the square of engine speed. Clearly trundling around at 
1200 revs will cause the engine to soot up , but it puts little strain on 
anything, and a regular burst on the open road will clear the carbon and 
and the mental cob-webs.

High revs almost inevitably implies rapid gear changes and high shock
loaded applied to the clutch, transmission and engine mounts. 

Simply put revving at 4k in heavy traffic is good for flash but pretty 
ST.... for anything else.

	Brooklands Books are a publishing house who (among other things)
publish books of reprints of articles from _Road & Track_ and _Car &
Driver_. A typical book will have all the articles about Porsches (though
they do many other marques as well) from, say, 1982 to 1985. They also do
model-specific books (e.g. 924). The books are very cheap (about 9 pounds
Sterling) and I think I have seen them advertised in every auto book
catalogue I have seen.

gratefully accepted) dealing with Porsches are:

Subject: 944 Washer Bottle Leaks


Over the weekend I was working on the 944's dead washer system. Removed and 
replaced the wipers, check valves, cleaned the hoses and nozzles. 
Unfortunately, also found out that the bottle has a leak, of course 
somewhere around the bottom, facing the wheelwell where I cannot get to it 
without removing the bottle. From the look of it, the removal requires more 
than just unbolting the bottle itself. The HAYNES manual is of no use for 
this operation.

Can anyone provide tips on removing the bottle? Any tips on repairing the 
bottle?

Thanks,

It's not obvious from looking at the washer system, but the head lamp 
washer feed comes off the bottom of the bottle.

When I bought my car I found that at some time, the hose to the light 
washers had got damaged and water leaked out through that, it's a while 
ago now, I seam to remember that you can only see the other pump with the 
engine under shield removed ( 8 screws )

The passenger side door has the pim nuts already mounted for you to install 
a mirror similar to the driver's side mirror (a mirror image, so to speak).
All you have to do is take off the inside of the door, use a center punch
to mark the middle of the insert and drill a pilot hole from inside the
door, then use a larger (6mm I believe) bit to open up the hole enough to
get a screw through it. 

Of course, first you have to *FIND* a passenger side mirror. I've seen 
them advertised in placed like Automotion, Automobile Atlanta, Tweeks,
etc. It's not a real readily available item, so price shopping may be
pointless.

Good luck.

Bob Brewer's comment on Vol's new arrival reminds me of the days when Betty
and I ferried three small children around in the back of our 356SC coupe.
 The addition of an upholstered foam pad to the folded-down rear seats made
for a comfortable (albeit cozy) shelf for all three, and they made many, many
long trips there.  Luggage went into two surplus U.S. Army duffle bags
(painted black with convertible-top dye) lashed to the Leitz rack.  On one
trip home to Mississippi for Christmas, Betty's folks gave our oldest child a
small tricycle.  After pondering how best to carry it back to North Carolina,
I simply tied it onto the top of the duffle bags, upright with the big wheel
toward the front.  When we pulled into a service station for gas somewhere in
mid-Alabama on the return trip, the attendant walked out, stopped to eye the
tricycle, and said, "Looks like you carry your own dinghy, young fellow!"
 Being a sailing enthusiast, I particularly appreciated his humor, and we've
laughed about the remark many times over the years.  Growing up in the back
of a 356 made Porschephiles of all three of our children, and now my
nine-year-old grandson even thinks the old bathtub is "cool".
 Congratulations, Vol.  Get them involved while they're young.

Eric Brown mentioned the 944 oil cooler being a potential source for mixing

years on my 1988 924S, and the local Porsche dealer said he had a bulletin on
it so replaced the oil cooler and all the main and crank bearings, under
warranty (even though the engine ran fine).  I make it a point now to check
the coolant for oil whenever I look at the other fluids.  No repeat, so far.

Hi, Jeannie.
 
(Saaay.... this isn't by any chance Miz Jeane from San Diego? Old Net joke,
never mind...)
 
I don't know if a certain short, bowlegged character named Morley calls
himself 356 Rescue or not, but it sounds like you're describing him. He has
all of his stuff displayed in boxes with chicken wire tops. Yes, you're right,
his prices are outrageous. He had a glass pre-A one SWF one-liter washer
bottle with its steel cage and bakelite top for $800. That was 2 years ago.
He still has it. It's now a bargain at $700. <g> The same item is being
reproduced by the Mercedes owner's club because it fits in 300 SLs and the
like. I don't know the MB club's price, but it won't be $800. I reproduced
the Bakelite top (in resin) for a friend, who, last I heard, is still trying
to get molds made to blow the glass jar, with the right pattern on it.
 
Other Pomona stories -- For a while, I was looking for 911 space saver rims
to use on my 356. At one Pomona swap, I found a new, never used rim with
space saver tire for $20 (dealt down from $25), so I bought it. That was
near the end of the section. Walking back, I spotted another. He wanted $40.
Next aisle over, a guy wanted $80. And then I found one for $100. I told
this guy that the wheel under my arm was $20. "Well, you got a real deal
there." I offered to sell it to him for $50. He wasn't interested <g>. I
have since found three more, two for $20 and one for $25.
 
Another thing to beware of is junk that passes for good repro parts. There is
somebody there regularly selling repro deco strips for 911 and 356. If you
look at them closely, they must be factory rejects from the maker, Tasker
Industries; the ends aren't quite right, etc. These are not a bargain if
you're doing a car "right." It's better to go to a supplier where you can
actually pick and choose parts, or deal with a reputable mail order house
such as Stoddard's (but not Twinks).
 
Also rubber parts -- International Mercantile is there with the full
selection of repro rubber parts, but one should beware that some of his
stuff is not the best on the market, others make better repros. And
sometimes his stuff is good or it's the only game in town. This is why it
helps to have a supplier who knows the difference, or to do your
homework/pay your dues and know the differences yourself. Case in point is
rubber floor mats. International Mercantile's are about 3x as thick as the
originals. Stoddard has much better reproductions. But nobody makes correct
thickness rear floor mats so you might as well get the IM items. Other
things to look out for: molding flash on rubber gaskets and seals (like
teardrop light rubber). Others make it without the flash.

Subject: Electrcial problem

I'm having an unusual problem with my '68 912. For seemingly no reason the
battery will just die. The car will run perfect and show no sign of the
battery losing it's charge, then it will not even crank over. The battery is
less than 2 years old and is the maintenance free type (you can't add water).
The 1st time this happened I found a loose connection at the battery. I
tightened it up and thought the problem had gone away. That was about a month
ago, last weekend it happened again. Is there some way to test the circuits
to see if something is draining the battery while the car is sitting? What
kind of voltage should I be reading at the battery when the car is running?
Or at the generator? This is kind of embarassing as I test electrical systems
in the 747,767, & 777 for a living. But we hardly ever (OK...never) have to
deal with dead batteries...Why don't these cars come with voltage/amp gauges?

Words of wisdom from a Chevy Vega owner:

Low speed tractability is a measure of engine performance, tuning, and the
level and skill of maintenance. The redline is the maximum recommended limit.
Manufacturers used to provide us with a greenline and a maximum recommended
steady speed limit or cruising speed. Anywhere between greenline and maximum
steady state is fine for (more or less) constant speed driving. Within that
band, the question becomes what is the optimal engine speed for steady
state cruising at 30 miles per hour?

Engines are usually specified with a redline, greenline, and maximum
sustained engine speed. Off the race track, acceleration to redline is
fine, although the car may actually accelerate faster if shift points
are calculated; calculated shift points are usually less than redline.
Off the race track steady state operation between greenline and
redline is fine.

Consider the case of my C4 and a steady 30 mph:

1st gear gives about 5.15 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 5825 rpm
2nd gear gives about 9.56 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 3140 rpm
3rd gear gives about 13.98 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 2150 rpm
4th gear gives about 17.64 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 1700 rpm
5th gear gives about 21.47 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 1400 rpm
6th gear gives about 25.30 mph/1000 rpms so 30 mph requires about 1190 rpm

Clearly, one can cruise at 30 mph in any of the 6 gears. Assuming the
oil is warm and you have several miles to go at 30, which gear is
appropriate? For my money (and it is MY money), holding it in 1st
would be silly as would 5th or 6th. 2nd, 3rd, or 4th? The C4 makes
over 240 ft. lbs at 5000 -- at anything over 2000 it's fairly torquey
and the thing NEVER fouls plugs so 3rd seems like a good choice. I
reject 2nd as pointlessly spinning the engine faster than necessary.
I reject 4th as just a bit too close to idle and not into the torque
curve.

In 3rd at 2150 I can accelerate smoothly, there is no gear lash
problem as I've experienced with some Japanese cars and bikes. There
is none of the dreaded "turbo lag." As a matter of fact, the pick up
from 2150 to 2500 is very quick and I'm going more than 10% faster.

Subject: 951 Power Steering Fluid leak


Hello Phellow Porschephiles;

My '89 951 has a power steering fluid leak which seems to be slowly getting 
worse.  In November, the local Porsche dealer diagnosed the problem as a bad 
hose, not the power steering pump itself, and replaced the short hose going from  
the fluid reservior directly to the pump.  The problem seems to have gotten 
worse since the hose was replaced.  After letting the car sit for several days 
over the holiday weekend there was a noticeable reddish wet spot on the garage 
floor.  I added about 0.5 pints of fluid yesterday to bring it up to level.  
When I was last under the car, the fluid appeared to be running down one of the 
steel lines near the pump and collecting on the skid plate before hitting the 
garage floor.  I could not locate the source of the leak.

Q.  What are the most likely failure points for power steering fluid leaks?  Any 
suggestions where I should look or how to go about isolating the leak?

I will be crawling under the car this weekend to change oil and locate the power 
steering fluid leak.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Please respond 
directly to me to save bandwidth.  TIA

After my 911 shopping experiences this sort of thing doesn't surprise
me.  One place I called had a "highly desireable" Porsche 912 for
around $20K.  I suspect that when the sportcar market was
hit by the recession that a lot of dealers began using drugs - just
a theory mind you...

This is a general answer since I am not familiar with 912 electrics.

To test for electical system shorts, with the ignition off, disconnect 
one battery
lead and place an ammeter in series. If you have an electric clock, you can
expect a small current. I don't imagine a clock would draw more than a few
milliamperes. You could disconnect one of the clock leads and measure
the current draw there for comparisons sake. Most newer car radios also
draw current when off to keep their memory refreshed. So, anything more
than a few milliamps at the battery with the car off would be a sign of a
problem in the wiring loom or one of the switches. Since you are familiar
with electrical testing, you know to start with the highest amperage setting
on the meter and then to work down so as not to fry the meter's fuse...

Batteries can also develop internal short paths. Professional battery
testers can measure the battery's internal resistance to see if the it is
internally shorted. Too little resistance means it won't hold a charge,
To high a resistance means it won't deliver adequate cranking
current.

Subject:       Heater Blower redux

I received several good responses to my query about the 911 heater blower 
(thanks to all of you).  Collective wisdom has two contradictory 
messages:  1) take the thing apart, get a replacement Bosch motor for a 
lot less that the whole blower. or 2) don't worry about the blower, 
you'll get enough heat without it.

My new question is this:  Is it really wise to live without the
blower--doesn't it have some cooling effect on the engine?  Seems to
me that pulling air through the heater boxes would help to cool the
engine (at least in slow moving traffic) by taking heat out from
under it.  I seem to remember the owners manual saying that the 
blower runs all the time, whether or not you have the air directed 
into the car.  This would argue that it has some purpose other than 
just keeping you from freezing to death.

My '75 runs a bit warm for my taste (about 205 F in the summer), so
I'd like to have every bit of help I can get... 


On a side note, I got to spend some hours working on the car this
weekend.  Put in new hood shocks--no more getting clocked on the
head every time I look in the boot.  Also installed a new windshield
washer squirter and associated hoses.  An amazing quantity of slimy
grey stuff had taken up residence in the reservior...

Subject: oil pressure high when cold!

I bought a 1983 911SC last year.  The oil pressure reading at that time,
seemed to correlate with the RPM's, that is at about 2K the oil pres was
approx 2 and etc.  I did not notice any particular differences when I started
it up or when it had been running for a while.  However, soon after buying
the car, I had the upgraded chain tensioners installed and I had new oil
return tubes put on due to some leaking.  Since then, the oil pressure is
always high (4-5) when I start the car, and can even exceed 5 if I raise the
RPM's to between 2-3K.  Once the engine is warm, the pressure then correlates
with the RPM's as before installing the tensioners.  I've asked the mechanic
about it and he cannot come up with any reason why the pressure readings have
changed.  He tells me I could blow my oil reservoir if I raise the pressure
too high, but I've read that idling the car until it is warm is not good
either.  Does anybody out there have any experience with this or ideas?
 Thanks in advance.

Yup.  Works.  For the specific problem that they sell it for.  E.g., 
here in Monterey it is sort of 55-60 degrees year round (thanks Pacific 
Ocean), I drive to work in the AM, by the PM the engine was cold enough 
to want cold start enrichment, but not cold enough to close the factory 
thermo switch.  A few days' worth of ohmmeter checks showed the 
correlation between "switch hasn't closed yet" and "embarrassing 10 
second cranking time".  (Probably the factory switch had drifted a bit 
over the years too.)  The Stoddard switch fixed this occasional

(raised eyebrows!)  By the way, I tried 4000rpm in 2nd gear yesterday.
With the 915 gearbox and factory tire size the mph is about 45.

On the topic "How is you Porsche Driven?", once in a while I merge on
the freeway at 65mph in 2nd gear.  I normally shift around 4000rpm or
4500rpm.  If I'm on the racetrack I shift at 5500rpm.  Now here comes a
purely personal opinion - the sounds, vibrations, and feeling the car
transmit to me tell me the engine is happiest when operated between
3000rpm and 5000rpm.  I love the personality of a 911!  When I want
to enjoy the car's personality I shift down and get off the interstates.
Otherwise it gets really boring driving in 5th gear at 65mph in a
straight line.

P-philes;
A while back there was a thread on the weaknesses of the

I have an '84 944 which shimmys at 70mph and everything is
in good condition (tires and balance - new).

Surely these cars didn't shimmy the day they left the showroom!

QUESTION: What is it that wears and results in the shimmy?

Has anyone replaced it and seem the anticipated improvement?
Has anyone determined if it is, struts, bushings, tie rod ends,
joints, wheel bearings, or what?  It seems to me that it should be
a 'fixable' problem.

I looked at a 1989 911 coupe today during lunch. The car has 29100 miles on it.
The owner says that the car has been through a pre-purchase inspection already.
He claims that they only found two things wrong with the car 1) cracked fog light cover (light still works) 2) leaking cam oil lines. He didn't have a copy of the inspection with him ( I called the shop, but the service manager was at lunch). Also, car has 900 miles until its time for a major service. He is asking
26900 for the car. The car is black, it has lots of scratches on the hood. He 
claims that they are minor and probably can be buffed out. It has one small dentat the front of the hood about 2 inches long. Is this a fair price for this car?I'm thinking of offering him $25000 for the car (after either I see his pre-purchase inspection or have one done myself). I'm thinking roughly 900-$1000 for    major service and $650 to have cam oil lines replaced. Please email me your
response directly.

So that they grenade at 24.0001 hours instead of 2.0001 hours. Plus, of course,
there's the rules. Not much point trying to spin the sucker any faster
if it can't suck any more air through the damned flow restrictor plate...

But we aren't talking about race engines here, not most of us anyway.

That was two years ago. It's 14.5k or so these days. And 70% of that is
still 10,000rpm...

So they do! And the laws of dynamics say "Don't lug your engine!"
The impulse generated by combustion is partially opposed by the
decceleration of the piston at TDC: at low revs, that effect is
out of balance, resulting in more shock being transmitted to the
wrist-pin, rod, big end, crank, mains, etc., which for small throttle
openings doesn't matter much but if you like to mash the gas pedal
(well, I do, anyway) it's not a good idea. Some Porsche racing engines
(the 1500 Speedsters for instance) are known for flat-spotting the
mains if the gas pedal is mashed below 1500rpm.

Unless you actually care to take some care in shifting gears: ease the

What allarmed me in the begining was the change in the guys attitude as soon as

Topic: 951 speedo and tire size
I've got a mystery of life to which someone knows the answer
I have a 951/S that normally has 245X16 tires on the back and does about
65MPH in second gear at stock redline. Recently I changed to 275X17 tires in
the rear.
Since the 275's are larger in diameter than the 245's it seemed to me that for
 any given axle RPM I would be going a bit faster. Therefore the speedo
should be reading a bit low since it had no way of telling what tires are
installed. I also believe that the Speedo is driven off the transmission.
Imagine my surprise when I now see about  70MPH at the top of second gear.
The only solution I can come up with is that the speedo is not driven off the
trans but is being read by the ABS sensor at the front wheels. Therefore the
speedo is about right.
Can anyone enlighten me or am I missing the obvious?

Subject: Week-and-a-half-old algae

Hello all --

I was away for a brief period of time and I'm just getting caught up on my 
required reading.  Forgive me.

Beginning with Magnus Ottenstrom on 19 December there has been a discussion 
surrounding algae in windshield washer bottles.  Robert Albrecht suggested 
that using Biobor Diesel Doctor in small amounts might due the trick if it 
didn't destroy your paint.  I can't say from experience, but putting a fuel 
additive in your washer bottle sounds risky to me.  The Biobor product is 
used because removing the fuel cell on a regular basis for cleaning is 
entirely unreasonable.  Removing the washer bottle on a regular basis is 
only slightly unreasonable.

Another suggestion was to clean the system with bleach (I didn't write down 
who suggested this).  The author expressed concern, however, that the 
caustic chlorine substance would damage the bottle and hosing.  I doubt it.  
If you *stored* bleach in the bottle it could cause the plastic to become 
dry and brittle, but if care is taken to rinse the system thoroughly after 
cleaning I don't believe there would be a problem.  On the other hand, you 
probably shouldn't run it through the pump . . .

Either way, I mentioned the problem in from of a woman who immediately 
remarked "vinegar is a good algicide."  Should work fairly well as a window 
cleaner as well . . .

P.S.  More recently Tracy Meyer (28 December) asked for private response to

Yeah, commuting is such a drag.  I'm sure that fuel economy is an important
issue given the price of fuel in the UK.  I suspect that I'd run a gear
higher if I were paying such prices.  With my '71T on US freeways without
traffic I generally use 5th gear when I'm driving at or above a consistent
70 MPH which translates into just under 3000 RPM.  In traffic moving at
that speed I'm generally in 4th, shifting into 3rd at about 55 MPH or so
depending on whether traffic is accelerating or slowing.  This is what I
consider "normal" driving and may be mildly inconsistent with my previous
posts.

But our freeways are a totally monotonous place to drive a Porsche and I
try to avoid them at all costs even though it *may* take longer to get to
my destination on the side roads.

I think that in my own car I'd avoid bouncing off the rev limiter just
because it's SO violent.  Yours may be more gentle.  One problem I have
with the rev limiter is that the 911 engine sounds like it still has much
more to come when that thing kicks in.  So, I keep a diligent eye on my
tach when I'm "having fun" and I make sure to shift just below the rev
limiter. On my '71T, the only place where the rev limiter is really at
issue is the 1 - 2 shift.

I'm going to have to get a more powerful Porsche soon!  Got my eye on a '93
RS America, low mileage, never raced (yeah, right), blah, blah, I just have
to convince my banker that I REALLY NEED it!

Subject: Hi-perf. tires

Porschefolk:
   The Dec. issue of Auto Motor und Sport has an interesting test of
hi-performance tires for the 993 Carrera. Why is it interesting? Because the
Yokohama A-008P, much beloved of Porschenauts,
finished dead last. My German is a little rusty, but the summary of the test
is as follows: The Yokos went up against the Bridgestone Expedia, Conti CZ
91, Dunlop SP Sport 8000, Michelin MXX 3, Pirelli P Zero Assymetrico, and
Toyo Proxes. The Bridgestones came in first in dry handling, followed my the
Michelins and the Contis, with the Yokos last. The Dunlops scored first in
wet handling, followed by Michelins and Pirellis. The Yokos were last.
Dunlops performed best on what AM&S called a wet skidpad, with Yokos last.
Dunlop also came in first in the aquaplaning test, followed by the Toyos and
Yokos, with the Bridgestones last. In the braking distance test, it was
Bridgestone, Michelin, and Dunlop, with the Yokos in last place.
   I know tire testing is extremely subjective, but I wonder whether you have
any comments on these results? Let me also add that the point spread between
"winners" and "losers" was narrow. All seem to be fine tires. Still, one
wonders about the Yoko mystique. I have been happy with the AVS Intermediates
on my wife's 325i, and I just replaced the 17" P Zero Assymetricos on my 993
with 18" A-008Ps, and a recent rip through the countryside produced no
unpleasant surprises. Any thoughts on the test results? And... on a related
note, any recommendations for 18" track tires, assuming such things exist?

New Porschephile here
Hello and Happy New Year to all of you.

Can anyone help me with address of a German parts supplier of a starter motor 
for '89 3.2.  Obviously they cost a lot more here in Rome!!

Any help would be appreciated.  

It is normal to replace the starter motor at 50K kms???  She did give me lots 
of signs in the past 8 months, but I left her for a month and the cold  
weather came. I wanted to take her out for a run on Christmas Day 
to stretch her legs and the starter motor had bit the dust.  Typical!

Three years ago I had replaced the starter motor twice in a two-year period
on my '72 750/5.  In this case, the electrics of the old BMW are prehistoric 
and I know how those starter motors bit the dust.  And then she and I bit the 
dust together.  I've since sold her for spares.

I await your response,
Yours appassionatamente

What is a 951 is it a derivative of the 944? we don't have that model no 
in the UK.

If it is a 944 deriv, then it is possible that the speedo is a la 944, in 
which case yes the speedo is driven from the front left wheel, the cable 
goes thru the centre of the stub axle, emerges thru a square hole in the hub 
grease cap where it is secured with a circlip.

I am surprised that with those girt great truck tyres you can actually red 
line it!!

Curious how much do those tyres cost in USA?

One further observation -

I have run small engined fords and large engined fords, all the engines 
came from the same product family, so were presumably of similar product 
quality, the small engine regularly needed to pull 6000 revs, the large 
engine rarely execeeded 5000 revs

The small engines typically wear out in 70k the larger ones 120k

I would conclude that it is the high reving that has done the damage

PS quick disclaimer - these were company cars 

further odd fact - the second hand value of small engine fords is higher 
than the big engine types in the UK, aren't people strange

further admission - I regularly red line the 944 but never before I get

A particularly good test is to send out a sample of the engine oil for

This is also a good test for a car going out of warranty.

If anyone would like more info please send mail

The cost of an oil analysis is about $15.

My familiarity with fuel injection is based primarily on the Honda
PGMFI and not Motronic.  My Porsche has carbs :-) and alufin drum
brakes, so I am not expert on all the new high tech cars.

Clearly with computer controlled injection, and individual injectors
on each cylinder, it is possible to control the amount and mixture
for each and every cylinder as well for the overall engine.  In
most engines, parametric information is not available on a per-cylinder
basis (even temperature) so that the control runs based on averages.

Secondly, all the injection systems that I know of (except diesel)
are 'intake port' which inject the fuel into the intake line just
outside of the intake valves.  This is a region of high turbulence
so there tends to be good mixing of the fuel and air as it fills
the cylinder.

Modern fuel injection systems can have a variety of inputs like
atmospheric pressure and temperature, cylinder head temperature,
oxygen content in the exhaust, RPM, throttle setting, and rate of
change of throttle setting, and presence of engine knock.  This
data is used to control both the fuel injection and spark timing.
I do not know of any passenger cars that have data on a per cylinder
basis, but clearly this is possible.

The original Bosch (VW) fuel injection system had many of these
features, but in crude mixed analog/digital fashion and no real
computer chip as a brain.  The 'throttle pump' was simulated by
a contact moving across a fan of printed circuit lands whenever
the throttle position was moved, giving a set of extra pump pulses
for extra fuel when going from low to high throttle.  This was
a 60's product.  Today's systems use real digital controllers with
a set of back-up software to handle failure of individual sensors
and usually even the whole computer (with badly degraded performance).

Still, none of this helps bearing pressures if you use full throttle
at very low engine revs.  A 'proper' mixture will fill the cylinders
and burn when ignited.  Unless the ignition occurs at well past
TDC (and usually it doesn't) the mixture will burn and build up
full pressure before the piston has had much chance to move much.
This gives higher combustion chamber pressures than at high RPM
(and is also related to why the engines knock at low RPM).  These
high pressures are maintained for longer periods, making the
lubrication more difficult as well.  New engines are not exempt
from this, except that those with knock sensors will retard the
ignition enough to avoid that extreme in pressure build-up and
flame front speed.

The basic rule is that if you are running at low RPM (2000 or less)
and want to accelerate quickly, shift to a lower gear first!  The
design point of newer engines is to allow them to run freely at
higher revs and does not significantly change the problem at low RPM.

If you are puttering around without need to accelerate rapidly,
it is quite acceptable to run the engine at low RPM.  The pressures
are not unduly high and the lower speeds will help engine life.

If you are racing, you shouldn't ever be near this engine speed
range except while waiting to start or after the event is over.

If the car has the turbo look package then it should have the turbo flared

The antenna locations on 911's seem to vary and depending on where that hole 
is it may be difficult to put an auto antenna where a manual ant exists.  My 
71 T had the hole on the driver's side and it was only accessible through 
the door opening, not from underneath fender like my 82 SC (passenger side 
location)...don't know if the motor housing will even fit in the 71 T 
location, anyone tried that??

Subject: 356 Synchronizers

Porsche has always been a leader in design and synchro mechanisms
were one or their early ones.  When my 356 was new, a typical
British car (MGA) had synchronizers that would always fail by
30k miles in spite of owner care.  Most cars of that era did not
synchronize first gear.  The technical standard for excellence
in synchronizers was Porsche and others advertised it when they
adopted the 'Porsche ring synchronizers' to their transmissions.

Still, any respectful driver of the day allowed enough pause in
up-shift for the gears to roughly match speeds and double clutched
on downshifts, particularly into 1st and 2nd.  In normal street
use, even without this care, 356 transmissions generally kept their
synchronizers working much longer than anything else.  Racing use
is something else and you expect to pay considerable in shortened
useful life.

My synchronizers are just fine at 80K original miles.  I don't know
the driving habits of the first owner, but he didn't trash the
transmission.  I'm saddened to hear that owners of newer Porsches
are less satisfied than I am.  The synchronizers in my 88 CRX/SI
seem very durable with quick shifts and no thoughts about double
clutching over 120k miles.  The Japanese seem to have the problem
in hand.

Subject: 85 911 Exhaust

I currently own an 85 Euro 911 that was imported and legalized.
At some point during its life, the previous owner decided to put
headers (not stainless steel), a Triad muffler, and no catalytic
converter.  Unfortunately, he did not save the parts.

The car sounds great, but performance isn't so great and it is not
street legal. I have not had the engine dyno'd, but I have taken it to
a drag strip and turned a 14.7 @ 95mph. I know the 911 is not
a drag car, but the 1/4 mile is a fairly good indication of how the
engine is performing.  I expected times closer to the low 14's based
upon published times.  Remember this is a Euro 911 (~230HP not
200).  Yes, the car has been serviced/tuned recently. Please, no
flames for dragging a 911.  This was included just for supporting
information.  Also, please no comments on my driving skill, etc.
I know launching a 911 properly is a difficult task.

Anyway, I need to put a street legal exhaust that has fairly decent
performance.  Does anyone know of a stainless steel header
system that is street legal (i.e. can be used with a catalytic
converter)?  I have spoken with the people at SSI and they don't
currently make anything that is legal for a 911.  I also spoke with
someone at AutoThority about a full dual exhaust system that
is street legal.  It is very expensive, and currently being tested.

Does anyone have any ideas?

     Eric-
     
     I have a 1980 911, and had a similar experience this last summer.
     
     The previous owner had a shop test leakage currents with no results 
     (he figured faulty alarm or stereo installation).
     
     The first time it happened, I had the alternator bench tested. The 
     connection that the voltage regulator was making with the rest of the 
     circuit was determined to be intermittent - thus in theory the 
     problem. (Every once in a while, the voltage reulator would stop 
     charging the battery)
     
     The second time it bit me (yup second) my mechanic played with it 
     until he got the problem (not charging the battery) to occur -- both 
     times a flatbed ride would cause the problem to go away. He pulled the 
     noise suppressor (have no idea why he did this, he just did) and 
     viola' the problem went away.
     
     That was several months ago, and it hasn't died on me since.
     
     It is a real bugger to catch intermittent electrical problems 8-(

Happy Holidays All!

I read a request from someone - I apologize I deleted some previous
p-file digests....it was a request for prices seen on nice early
short-wheel base 911s, maybe even a '66?

Anyway, I saw a VERY clean, white, all original - never restored,
'66 911, with alloys, all around beautiful.  Having recently welded
in just about every replacement piece of sheetmeal possible on
my '66 912, I think I've got a good idea of where rust can form,
and this car was clean.

The person was asking $8900 or best offer, ran like a champ.  I wanted
to just sit there and cry - it seemed very cheap to me.  If I had
the $$, I would have bought it.


Happy Hunting!

Would buy the higher rev engine as the "little ole lady from pasadena" 
car would blow up when you did rev it up. The engines get set into 
a certain way. Plus the low rev would full of carbon etc. and may have 
to be taken apart to run right.

Subject: Tire tests/car suspension/Nationality of roads!


On the recent thread on tires and tire tests I have the following to add. One
needs to consider the road and car suspension as well as the tires to decipher
tire tests. It may well be that the same tires on the exact same car will
behave different on European and on US roads. The quality of the roads is
different. And because of the different suspensions the weight distribution
shift to the front that occurs during braking is different on soft and hard
suspensions.

In a 1991 trip to England I drove a rental Ford pegged for significant
stretches of the A-1. With the same car I had a nasty experience in the back
roads of the Northeast. A small lorry (small truck) pulled in front of me from
a side road and took my lane. I hit the horn and brakes at around 70 mph; the
lorry  stopped in my lane; I skidded (no hope to stop before I hit it); an
oncoming car X from the other direction slowed down just enough; I saw X
slowing down and pulling nearer its curb (to its left in the UK); recovered
from the skid, floored it and overtook the lorry in X's lane, missing X by
about 4 feet. In the maneuver I used quite a bit of what I have learned in the
track with the 911 (another reason to try drivers ed). Neither X nor I slowed
down to below 35 mph. It would have been nasty if X hadn't slowed down or if 
I hadn't seen him doing it. I probably owe X's driver my life. 

I went back and looked at the tarmac. Rough asphalt, a lot of friction, even in
the wet. Looked and felt significantly superior to Missouri's best. It looked
better than the track we use in St. Louis for drivers ed. No way would the two
cars have behaved/handled the same on US roads. Most of us have seen (dare 
I say driven?) the US couch-mobiles slouching all over the road - they couldn't
handle like X or the rental Ford. Bottom line: the accident would not have been
avoided on US country lanes due to inferior roads and slouching suspensions. 

When I came back to the US I called the Missouri Highway and Transportation
Department (MHTD) and talked to their engineers. Here are the conclusions:

a. Missouri engineers agree that our roads (in the US in general) are inferior
   to and cheaper than roads in the UK.
b. The tarmac/asphalt/cement we use is cheaper than the UK stuff.
c. They had sent to the UK some of their engineers to study UK roads, and the 
   report wasn't back yet, but the general consensus was that we are
   significantly behind in the US.
d. It comes down to a choice of economics. In the UK they spend more for
   initial road installation and every upkeep. In the US we spend less for 
   initial installation and every upkeep, but we need to do more frequent
   upkeep. 

Back to tire tests. I understand the tires tested (on German roads) were close
to each other. Life is not linear. I suspect the ratings might be different if
the tests were done on US roads.

I am due for new tires (tyres?) this season. Has anyone seen tire tests on
correctly lowered (stiff suspension) 1984-89 Carreras on US roads? Source?

Thanks for the nice words. As far as how many times the throttle blips,
it edpends on how much of a hurry I'm in. If I'm shifting in a leasurely
manner, and double-clutching only to save the synchro's, the revs tend to
fall off a bit too far with a single blip so I have to re-blip just as the
clutch is about to engage. That's much less common on upshifts, but it
still happens. When I'm pushing, I time the final clutch engagement such as
to exactly match when the engine reaches the right rpm, so there's only
one blip.

you're just asking for more problems by introducing an oily product into your

Text item: 5-pt harness in 911s



  Greetings p-philes:

  I am searching for some advice on installing a 5-point safety harness in
  my '84 911 coupe.  The car is a weekend driver as well as an auto-x and
  PCA track car.  It has stock seats, seat belts - well, I guess stock
  everything.  I wouldn't be too happy to do any drilling, but if it's
  absolutely necessary, then...

  It seems that the primary problem is how to attach the shoulder harness
  straps.  These are my five options that I came up with:
  1)  Install the shoulder straps to eyebolts that are in the rear seatbelt
  holes.  Run straps over a bolt-in harness bar.
  2)  Install the shoulder straps to eyebolts that are in the rear seatbelt
  holes.  No harness bar.
  2)  Install the shoulder straps to the bolt-in harness bar.  (Ugh - I
  don't trust the strength and integrity of these harness bars)
  3)  Install a roll cage and attach should straps to bar of cage.
  (Getting pricey but defintely the best solution)
  4)  Just be happy with what I have (3" lap belt in addition to stock seat
  belts)

  The roll cage would be the best solution, but I'm not ready to spend that
  kind of money.  I am leaning towards option (1), but would be interested
  in hearing about some solutions that you may have implemented.  I
  understand that there are inherent risks associated with an improperly
  installed harness (ie spinal compression, etc).  Anyone have any thoughts
  relating this to my options listed above?

Subject: Re: 911 CD box

The "whistling" you refer to is caused by the box's method of raising the 
DC voltage from the 13 or so at the alternator/battery to several 
hundred. The box actually chops the dc and converts it to a rather 
unsinusoidal waveform, but one that can be raised by using a toroidal 
(wound on a donut shaped) transformer. The higher voltage ac is 
essentially then rectified back to dc. This whole process can work 
because the box creates the ac at a fairly high frequency, typically 
15-30 kHz (compare this to 60 Hz in your home or 400 Hz on aircraft). 
Using the high frequency allows the use of the toroidal transformer which 
would need lots more steel in it's core at a lower frequency. Thus the 
ac frequency is actually in the hearing range of most good human ears. 
One word of caution; the ground connection from the box to the chassis is 
important for two reasons. If it becomes poor, so will your resulting 
spark. And secondly, if you touch a poorly grounded box, it can whallop 
you! 

Happy new year!    Dave Christano, P.E.

As far as I know, SSI, Bursch and B&B make headers that will match a Cat and

Mine are also just fine at a bit over 500K original miles. The tranny

Well, you have to remember that the 356s and 914s *basicly* only have
three main bearings (the nose bearing, number 4, hardly counts since
there are no rods between it and number 3). For maximium longevity,
it's best to keep 356s under 5k RPM. 

That is, of course, not how I drive mine....

Subject: clutch shake

Dear p-philes,

	I recently had the clutch replaced on my secondary vehicle, a 1978 
Chevy full size van.  It has a 3 speed manual "on the column" transmission 
and used to take off very smoothly with the old transmission.  Since I 
replaced the clutch a few weeks ago, it has developed a bad shake whenever 
taking off.  There is a certain point in the releasing of the clutch where 
it just causes the whole van to shake.  The problem is worst starting on 
uphills.  When I can release the clutch without giving any gas at all (when 
moving  slightly or going downhill)  the shake is minimal or nonexistant.  
Any ideas what the problem could be? The mechanic says that a litle shake 
is normal when taking off but I don't think he is right. Should the 
flywheel be ground? Anyone with similar experiences?

	Also, I was recently at the National Capitol Area Auto Show 
(excellent) and had the opportunity to speak with a Porshe dealer 
salesman.  He said that Porsche offered a program that provided warranties 
for used Porsches purchased from dealers.  Has anyone heard of this or 
used it?  My brother is considering  a used 944, late eighties- how much 
do you think it would cost per year for the warranty?  Thanks for the

Subject: 911 CD box

Dave and all,

Thanks for the info on the CD box, explaining the method of getting
high voltage from 12V with transformers and rectifiers. This part I
understand. But what does the "capacitor" do in this circuit? (It is
called "Capacitive" Discharge, not "transformer" discharge). I believe
a capacitor is charged with this high DC voltage, and discharges when
the points open, into the "coil" on the engine (which is actually
a transformer I think on the CD cars).

I am wondering if it is worth rebuilding a working unit. Transformers do
not "wear out"- they die, and the same with most components. But
big capacitors do wear out and mine may be weak. I tried cleaning up
my ground wires, as you suggested. What do you think?

Also, nobody suggested where I could get it rebuilt yet.

Thanks again, Mike Piera, P.S.E.  AnalogMike@aol.com '72 911S Targa

On my normal Carrera I'm running 8x17" with 215/45, BUT I've had the
edge cut off the fender! Before this, they hit the fenders too, but
I think 225 may be pushing it a bit. Of course you could use a rim that
moves the tire a bit closer to the body, but then you might not be
able to turn the wheels all the way! (On my turbo-look I'm running
9x17 with 245/40 in front without a problem, and no cut edges)

Yes, the roads are different, but so are the tires! Porsche Club Denmark
was invited to an evening at Goodyear where we were told that the tires
for Europe and US (as well as the far east) were different in the compound
to make up for temperature and road quality differences! Interesting stuff

Subject: Double Clutching/ plus 914 questions

Greetings,

OK,  I'll go ahead and admit my ignorance.... What exactly is double clutching 
and what is going on in the transmission during this.  (my understanding is that
the procedure is: (1) press clutch, (2) shift to neutral, (3) release clutch, 
blip the throttle a tad, (4) press clutch, (5) shift to next gear.)

Specifically, what is happening to each shaft in tranny?  Is this used to up AND
downshift or just one of these?  Doesn't this take alot longer to shift this 
way? If so, I assume racers wouldn't want to double clutch?

I have successfully obtained the "shift with broken clutch cable" feel, and I 
assume this is OK on synchros as long as revs are well matched.

Now, 914 stuff:

(1) 1.8L engine is ready to drop out of my 1974.  Rebuilt 2.0 will go in.  When 
I do rebuild the 2.0, what cams are suggested for street/FI use.  FAT has one in
the catalog, I think Stan mentioned another one but I forgot what it was and 
where to find it?

(2) 2.0 was supposedly rebuilt within last 10K miles.  I want to open it up 
anyway to make sure everything is kosher and to make sure it seals well.  
Anything I should specifically look for (crack in oil strainer bolt hole, 
pounded out bearings. etc)?

(3) Where is the best place (i.e. lowest price!) to get factory workshop 
manuals.  I am in this 914 hobby enough to make it a wise purchase but I don't 
want to spend too much.  I think German Parts up in San Luis Obispo had a price 
around $270.  Good?

(4) In the Haynes manual it shows that the CV joint boot has a retaining flange 
that fits up to the CV joint proper.  My CV joints seem to have a permanently 
attached flange (i.e. it doesn't easily come off).  When the engine goes in, I 
want to put in the new boots.  Anyone care to clue me in?

(5) (and final).  Last time I removed the 1.8 (4 years ago) I hung it off an 
engine yoke designed for a VW engine.  Well, experience and subsequent reading 
has shown me that this is insufficient -- it bends!  On the other hand, the yoke
advertised in TWEEKS/Performance/Automotion or one of the others costs something
like $150... maybe even more!  Is there a better solution?  Can I use those four
metal arms that come with the engine stands (they work on the Triumph engine.)

many TIA and apologies if this is too long, involved and boring!
 -Tim

A couple of things on the chattering clutch 1. Grease oil etc and disk. 
or 2. flywheel needs surfacing or if done during cluthc job then it 
could be that surfacing is not smooth, true. Or  the clutch disk is bad.

If you had it done take it back and have them fix it.

double clutching envoles as you slow down putting the trans in neutral 
for a second as you "blip" the throttle to speed up the engine to match 
the speed of the car for the next lower gear. Just a you end the blip 
you put in the clutch shift down and let up the clutch. In theory the 
engine rpm' will now match the gear you are in and there will be no 
sudden engine race up as you let out the clutch. This takes practice and 
is used with heel and toe braking in racing.

Subject: Re: 1989 911 coupe, current 911 market (longish)

I know I shouldn't do this.

The original question being 'is $26.9K reasonable' for the car described.
 Per the NADA Used Car Guide, Blue Book for 26 December 1994, a 1989 911
Carrera Coupe in Average condition (and this one sounds a bit below average)
has a wholesale value of  $23,850.  Figuring an average used car markup (in
this price range) of $2-3,000, the asking price would be ok to start assuming
an average car, you should correct for obvious problems and start low (this
isn't the hot sports car market time of year).

What should an 'Average' condition late model 911 look like?
Body and interior cosmetics? Services up-to-date and documented (I know that
we believe Porsches get serviced properly, but the truth is relatively few
new Porsche cars are adequately serviced by the first owner).  At what point
should we expect wear items to have been replaced (clutches are of particular
concern).  Many people are afraid to admit autocross or race time, but others
feel this requires more attention to the car and a 'better' car as a
consequence, disregarding potentially overstressed components that may be
near the end of their service life.

I believe that there are three levels of quality:

The 'Clean' or exceptional, where the car has been driven regularly enough to
maintain seals, gaskets, lubrication, etc. and maintenance regularly to
replace contaminated fluids (I would not pay substantial extra money to the
low mileage car that has not been driven in three years, has five year old
tires and original brake fluid).  On this car the paint and interior will
look as good or better than factory new, the car has been exercised
regularly, has not been modified, has current service records, and has not
been damaged.
  
The 'Average' car, where I accept that some light cosmetics are needed (a
polish, leather dye on the driver's seat bolsters, new floor mats), services
are suspect but it starts/drives/brakes/handles as anticipated, has a little
light valve train ticking indicating (hopefully) that there is still some
valve train clearance, clutch and transmission feel good.  This I would price
anticipating a 'major' service, set of tires and brakes within one year.

The 'Rough' car, this does not mean 'Basket'.  Rough mearly drops the price
another couple grand because of obvious deficiencies: paint, dents, noises,
whatever.  here the buyer makes a 'best estimate' to bring the car to
'average' and bids accordingly.  Unless the buyer has considerable experience
on the model and potential reconditioning, stay clear.

Regarding my previous comments regarding the white 911 at Sears Imported
Autos, I agree: the car is no better than average (it's 'just a car'),
indicating an excessive asking price.  Following my model: I think a
realistic offer for that car (giving Mr. Raeder what I feel to be a
reasonable 'retail' price, not 'wholesale') would be about $22,500 (average
car wholesale = $20,625 + 'about' $2 grand markup).  Two things regarding
this: 1) Mr. Raeder may have put too much money into this car (he's certainly
had it a long time) and not be willing to lose money on it; 2) having a model
to help price something does not mean you can buy it for that, it only helps
you decide where to turn and walk away (do not ever fall in love with car a
before you buy).

Subject: High revving

 
I bought a 356 from a little old lady from Glendale (next door to Pasadena).
Yes, there was a Dodge in her rickety old garage (but it wasn't shiny red, it
wasn't a SuperStock). She was the original owner of the 356. It runs fine.
Revs fine too, when I choose to. No, it doesn't blow up when I rev it. No,
engines don't take a "set" when run at low revs, not if they get revved
occasionally. The only way I could imagine them taking a "set" is if there
is a carbon ridge deposited at the top of the upper ring travel, and if the
car has been run exclusively at low revs and part throttle for zillions of
miles (long enough to build up significant carbon) and then revved high and
hard, so that intertia forces result in just enough stretch/flexing of stuff
to put the top ring into the carbon by a few microns and thereby break a
ring. That scenario is pretty farfetched anyway. And gas forces tend to act
downward on three of the four strokes (the exception being the intake stroke).
 
The most recent 911 has a steep rise in the torque curve to 2000 rpm, then
it's flat to about 3500, then rises again to the torque peak at 5000 rpm.
What that means is that in around-town driving, the engine will have very
smooth, non-peaky response from 2 to 3.5 or even 4 K before the 'kick' comes
on. Porsche designed it that way for a reason; low-end torque makes a car
tractable and gives what the guy in the street calls "good pickup." The fact
that the engine is happy cruising at 5000 rpm doesn't mean you have to drive
it in third (out of 6) on the freeway. Under steady state at least, when
maximum acceleration is not called for, 2000 or whatever will do just as
well. And of two cars of equal horsepower, or put another way equal torque
at some given rpm, the one with a wide, flat torque curve will just plain
outdrag the one with the peaky Fiat-like torque curve.

Is the battery really dead or will it just not start? Do you have lights,
radio and all but the starter doesn't make a sound? If the latter, there's
nothing wrong with the battery, look at the wiring to the starter (including
check contacts at ignition switch). My 356s do this on occasion. So I have to
get out and wiggle some kludged up wires at a non-stock relay somebody bolted
to the underside of my daily driver (old VW trick to fix hot start problems
caused by old wiring/bad connections). Then it starts fine.

OK, all you Porsche buffs, I need your help. This is along the recent thread
of pricing on used 911s. I have an '89 911 Cabriolet that I'm trying to sell
(I've previously posted it here, with no real responses). Guards red, black
interior. It has 35K miles; recently underwent full 30K mileage service. Body
and paint are in superb condition (one scratch near right headlamp, visible
only on close inspection), as is the interior. Has a Clarion Pro Audio CD
player with upgraded sound system (a/d/s amplifier and speakers). Recently
replaced the back window and weather stripping around the windows, and had
recent brake service. I'm no mechanical expert, but as far as I can tell, the
car is mechanically very sound and I honestly know of no defects.

Now, I know that January is not the best time of year to sell a convertible
in Chicago, but circumstances are such that now is when it's up for sale.
What is a reasonable price to expect? I've got it on consignment at a local
dealership; I know they get their cut, also. What is a fair and reasonable
profit for them? I am a very good customer of this dealership; my new 993 has
been ordered there. They sell several top-flight marques and between myself

Hi Steve,

Re: 8" sub woofer location in a 911. If you buy the speaker enclosures 
from Z-box,(very nice and pretty expensive) you have a couple of 
options. 1. They make an enclosure that fits in the rear window and also 
houses 2 pair of satellite speakers, this model only fits the  targas. 
2. They also offer an enclosure that fits in the rear side panels that 
house an 8" sub. I built an enclosure thats similar to the one I see 
advertised in the P mags that fits behind the front seats and sits on 
the floor, the problem I had was it really restricts how far you can 
move the front seats back, a real problem for the passenger seat. I 
ended up taking out the rear seats and building an enclosure thats 
approximately the same height as the rear seats when folded down and is 
flush with the front. The speakers face forward and are located about 
where your butt would be in the rear seat. The enclosure size was 
determined by the cubic feet needed for the speakers. The enclosure is 
also ported.  I also wanted to be able to put stuff in the back, and not 
have it look obvious that I had speakers back there. I also have a pair 
of the Z-box front satellite speakers I haven't gotten around to 
mounting yet. If you can afford it the Z-boxes are pretty cool. The're 
available in vinyl or leather and look absolutely stock. The only thing 
I didn't like about them(this was 10 yrs. ago) was that the satellite  
speakers were not of the highest quality.

I'm surprised none of you 944 guys answered this. The 951 is a 944 Turbo
(it follows the 931=924 Turbo scheme).

As far as someone saying the 912 engine shouldn't be revved over 5000rpm,
weren't the 356/912 engines revved up on a test stand to full power before
being put in a car? I seem to recall seeing this on the factory tour video
of the early sixties. Anyways I'll keep revving my 356SC motor to 6000,
and when something breaks, I'll tell everyone.

Subject: Electromotive Direct Ignition?

I am looking at an '86 turbo that has been modified with dual plug heads
and "converted" to use an Electromotive, Inc. "HPV-1" Direct Ignition 
System. There are two of these units mounted on the shelf at the rear of 
the engine compartment (and would be virtually inaccessable after the 
engine is reinstalled. The engine is out of the car with one 
burned valve and piston (Yes, there is a huge boost control located in 
the console).

Can anyone respond with information about these units? Are they still in 
production or at least documentation available?

Should I assume I'll have to buy a distributor, CD unit, and coil?

Seller is "anxious" to move the car fast (aren't they all), so any quick

Subject: double clutching inquiry

If double clutching is intended to match revs when downshifting while 
slowing down (let me know if that is not right), then would you have to 
switch feet on the pedals?  I drive with my left on the clutch and right 
on either throttle or brakes (or both if heel-and-toeing) like most 
red-blooded Americans.  If double clutching requires moving my right foot 
from brake to gas and my left from clutch to brake, wouldn't it be 
extremely awkward?  Does this manuever then replace heel and toe 
downshifting?

Subject: Double Clutching Explanation


    To any interested,
    
    Double Clutching is an attempt to synchronize transmission speed with 
    engine speed during downshifting.  It used to be a required skill prior 
    to the introduction of "synchronized" transmissions.  In racing 
    applications, it is most often used with "heel/toe" braking.  Here is 
    an attempt at a description:
    
    Car traveling in 4th gear approaches a 3rd gear corner
    Driver brakes with ball of foot (toe)
    Simultaneously depresses clutch and puts car into neutral and release   
        clutch
    While still braking, driver blips throttle with heel to bring engine    
        speed up to expected transmission speed in 3rd gear.
    Driver depresses clutch and downshifts into 3rd
    Driver releases clutch and turns into corner.
    
    This all happens in the space from the initial braking point to the 
    turn point and is supposed to keep the rear wheels from locking up (and 
    send the car backwards) due to a large variation between engine speed 
    (too low) and transmission speed (too high).  At turn in to the corner, 
    all braking and downshifting needs to have been completed unless you 
    are trail-braking, or are planning an off-road excursion.
    
    That is my definition of double clutching along with its application.  
    If you are planning to race where shifting is required, the heel/toe 
    double clutch is a requirement for smooth driving.  To learn, however, 
    you need to practice on the street until it becomes automatic.

For pricing comparison (we're about 160 miles west in the Quad Cities), the
local dealer has an 89 Carrera Silver Anniversary Cabrio with under 25 K
miles.  Cosmetics sound equivalent to your car.  Was asking $38K for the car
(bought from the original owner), but I think they would let it go for $36K.
 They're pretty aggressive on pricing (have a new 993 Guards Red for

I think $35-36K is about what you can expect here in the Midwest.

Subject: 911 SC Engine Problems

I hope that I will not be abusing my status as a newcomer to the list by
posting this detailed request for help.

I have a 1978 911 SC with 138,000 miles and uncertain history.  It has been a
delightful car for 25,000 miles or so since I have owned it, but there are
some problems that are vexing me.  

First, some background information.  I have no service records at all.  The
car has had some major work, since the camshafts are the Carerra style, with
the single bolt holding the sprocket on.  The cam drive chains and guides
looked new, the tensioners have been upgraded to Carerra style.  The car
consumes a quart of oil (Kendall 20w-50) every 1100 miles.  Oil pressure is
indicated at about 1.5 bar at hot idle, and peaks at about 4 or 5 bar hot. I
have always felt the the low-end torque of this engine was inadequate, but it
has good power up top.(It runs more like an S than an SC) In all other
aspects, the engine functioned as new, with smooth idle, even progression up
through the rpm range, and a feeling of good balance up near redline. On a
hot day with the AC on, the oil temperature peaks at an indicated 245 degrees
Fahrenheit (about 120 c) (HOT).

My problem is that on hot days, if I ran the engine up above about 5300 rpm
under full throttle in any gear,  the engine would begin to stumble and black
smoke would pour out of the exhaust (embarrassing! probably harmful!).  It
was more prone to happen after a hot soak or heavy traffic, or with the AC
on, and seemed less likely to happen if I retarded the timing 2 -3 degrees. 
There was no audible evidence of detonation. How do I correct this problem?
(Besides  limiting revs to 5300 in such circumstances)

I have performed a leakdown on the the left bank and excessive blowby (rings)
is evident in number three. I have not done the leakdown on 4 through 6 yet,
because I was disgusted and wanted to retire for the night.

My theory is that I have a cracked ring and worn or broken ring lands on #3
due to inaudible pinging. Overhaul is indicated. (Gulp) I am concerned that
the overhaul will fix the resulting damage without fixing the problem that
caused it. I am guessing that the air flow over the engine is inadequate
using the stock fan, and that I should upgrade to the later style fan and
shroud. Any suggestions?

When I go into the engine, I will be looking for ways to improve performance.
I have always felt that the "right" level of performance for me was that
obtained with 10 -12 lbs/hp. That would mean about 220 hp; Stock was 180 hp.
Does anyone have a recipe for such a street engine? Can such an engine be
built using stock P&Cs? I can afford the Euro P&Cs @ 9.5+ CR, but will I be
able to prevent alledged pinging that may have cause the early retirement my
#3? I cannot/willnot afford a 3.2 ltr set of jugs @ $4,000.

I have ordered (but not yet received) the 911 performance handbook. I have
access to the factory manuals. Any other sources I should use? 

Thank you in advance for any help you can give. Mail me directly if you wish.

Subject: Heater Electricals


I'm having debugging problems with the heater blowers in my '87 911.  Here
goes.

This year/model has the center console with the driver/passenger
control levers and a 3-position rotary switch.  Currently, the levers
control the main blower and registers just fine.  However, the rotary
switch has no effect at all.  I have disected the the console and found
that the rotary knob is a cam that engages 2 switches as follows:

  knob pos. |  switch 1 | switch 2
      0          OFF        OFF
      1          OFF        OFF
      2           ON        OFF
      3          OFF         ON

I think the additional blowers behind the kick panels should be engaged
with one of these knob positions, but.....
At this point, I can't remember how it used to work.  Does anyone know
how it is supposed to work so I can figure what is wrong.

I suspect there is a relay for this system somewhere.  Does anyone know
where to look?  All of the fuses in the fuse panel look OK.  Also, there
is a tiny light bulb under the facing for the rotary knob.  Any suggestions
where to get a replacement (burned out)?

Subject: 914 accelerator stuck

   I'm about to leave work to have this problem looked at before I do
   perhaps someone can save me the trip.... 2 weeks ago as part of a routine
   maintenance I had both my throttle & clutch cable replaced.  Both the
   clutch & the throttle felt great for a few days but the accelerator has
   become increasingly difficult to depress.  When I "blib" the accelerator
   upon downshifting I hear a pronounced "squawk" from the pedal area.  I am
   presuming that there is some friction occuring in the pedal assembly.  Does
   anyone know what this is likely to be?  Based on the good work this
   mechanic has done in the past I think that it is unlikely that the
   installation of the throttle cable was done improperly.

   I have always experienced a great deal of frustration removing the pedal
   board to get at the pedal assembly and last night I eventually gave up (Is
   there a trick to this?). I don't have garage, I live in NY, and it was just
   too cold outside.  I'm willing to give it another try if anyone can offer a
   suggestion that might save me a 40 mile trip to my P-car mechanic.

Subject: UK road surfaces


In the UK the roads approaching junctions are often surfaced with a 
special compound designed to be extra grippy.

This stuff is/was made by Shell and carried the "delu-grip" trade name.
It is the same stuff that Silverstone - and probably many other tracks 
are covered with.

It is a mixture of ground rock in some form of hard resin, the big advantage 
is that unlike tarmac, it does not soften and allow the grit to become 
pushed flat.

Most roads over here are built much the same way the romans did it, layers 
of graded stones with a fine surface finish - mostly this is tarmac.

The big problem, is this technique is useless with 40 ton trucks, the road 
I use daily has 4 parallel grooves running down the inside lanes, these 
are something like 5cm deep, this causes horrible tram-lining with big 
fat porsche tyres.

Concrete roads are IMHO far better than tarmac, they have one major draw 
back in the UK, the joints tend the break up, when the joints do go, the 
roads are then tarred - yes they pour molten tar on the road and then 
throw granite chips on it - you can well imagine the chaos this causes. 
It is not unusual to see ten cars in a lay-by waiting for the window man 
to fix them. 

UK concrete roads have a very course finish, so that light rain does not 
completely cover the surface, I have noticed that US roads tend to have 
smooth, almost polish surfaces.

Which are the better road? 

I am not sure.

Another difference I've noticed is that when it rains here in the US
cars kick up a horrendous spray. On busy highways, there is almost a fog
and windshield wipers can hardly keep up with it. In the UK, with the same
degree of rain, there is very little spray from car tires. It's really a
very noticable difference that must have safety implications.

The biggest difference between US and UK roads is the lane discipline
of the drivers. They just *don't* pass on the left side and they keep
left except to pass .... hmmmm, come to think of it, it's not too
different from New Jersey! Of course, were talking about opposite 
exteremes on the politeness scale.

One thing I can recomed to extend the life of your gloves is a plastic 
glove insert. (you can buy them at sporting goods stores since they are 
made for golf gloves.) They are shaped like hands and they keep the shape

Yo, Eric. No videos in the '60s. What you probably saw was the film, "Made
By Hand," which was produced by the factory in those days. 

I visited the factory in August, 1961 while having a 6k check-up done on my
'61 Normal Coupe. I don't remember seeing an engine-dyno room in the new-car
factory (could have been there, just didn't happen to see it), but I still
have a vivid picture in my mind of the chassis-dyno stands outside the
new-car factory to the south overlooking the autobahn that separated Factory
#1 and #2. They had a half-dozen or so chassis-dyno stands, each with a
plastic roof to keep the car dry. As each new car (35 per day in 1961)
rolled off the production line on its 3-wheel cart, it would be placed on
the ground and taken to a chassis-dyno. 

I walked by one stand just as a mechanic, with the driver's door open and
with one foot on the gas pedal and one on the ground, fired up a 356B, lit a
cigarette, and immediately pegged the tach (I didn't notice what gear). I
thought it was a little harsh on the engine since I was more used to the
gentle break-in period required of American cars of the day. My wife and I
continued walking down to the chain link fence overlooking the autobahn,
watch a couple of new cars zip by going out of town on a test drive with
their funky tan bras, and then walked back along the row of chassis-dynos.
The same mechanic was still sitting in the 356B, tach still pegged, and 2"
of ash still clung to his cigarette. So, I figure a full five minutes went
by at a sustained 5500 to 6000 rpm.

I'm not sure what the lesson is, but the good Doctor obviously thought he
had built an engine that should rev to the limit with regularity.

Subject: double clutching

The thread on double clutching seems to have missed the obvious:
double clutching is meant to reduce the wear and tear on the
transmission synchronizers. When the clutch is released with the
shift lever in neutral, the transmission input shaft and the gears and
synchros mounted on that shaft will then be spinning at engine
RPM. The throttle is blipped to about the RPM that the engine  would
be at once the downshift is completed. Then, when the clutch is
pushed back in and the downshift completed, the meshing gears
and synchros will already be spinning at about the same speed.

Many older cars don't have synchros on first gear (like the original
VW bug). If you wanted to get it into first without coming to a complete
stop, you had to double clutch it.

In a racing situation you don't need to double clutch it to match
engine speed at downshifts. You just need to give it some throttle
before letting the clutch out (and if braking, this is done "heel and
toe"). In endurance racing where mechanical longevity is more
important than ultimate lap times, double clutched downshifts may
be called for. But I don't think double clutching is used much in sprint
races (unless, of course, the synchros are shot!).

Real race drivers get the Italian-type driving glove with leather palms,
knit backs, and with no finger-ends so they can pick their nose without
removing the glove - usually best done while doing a double-clutch downshift
from 5th to 2nd to demonstrate their driving prowness.

If you get these gloves, the companion part of the outfit is the
Mickey-Mouse polo-type helmet like Sterling (Moss, for you younger
P'philers) used to have on his head.

What Michael Willis said about the flywheel needed to be smoothed out.
 
When I replaced the clutch on the Triumph that I owned before the 911, I
had to take the transmision out twice.  Once to replace the clutch, and
then once to run sandpaper over the flywheel.  One has to learn sometime
or another, and when you do something twice (expecially when working on
cars) you never forget.
 
Again, if you had a shop do the work, then they need to fix the problem.

Larry,  

Let's pick some nits:  "Made by Hand" was originally filmed but now is a

dyno'd.

Engines are dyno's at various power and rpm levels, including full power
runs.  Reving an engine at full power on break-in is  
ok.  Sustained running at high rpm and high loads is not.

continued walking down to the chain link fence overlooking the autobahn,
watch a couple of new cars zip by going out of town on a test drive with
their funky tan bras, and then walked back along the row of chassis-dynos.
The same mechanic was still sitting in the 356B, tach still pegged, and 2"
of ash still clung to his cigarette. So, I figure a full five minutes went
by at a sustained 5500 to 6000 rpm.

I'm not sure what the lesson is, but the good Doctor obviously thought he
had built an engine that should rev to the limit with regularity.

While the story relates to old American iron, the message should
be clear.  Some years ago a friend purchased a used Corvette which
he was told hadn't been driven hard.  The first time he took the
engine to red line he cracked the top rings.  It had never been run
at top engine speed and at high speed he hit the ridge that builds at
the top of piston travel.  Things stretch a little at high RPM.
He was able to hone the ridge and replace the rings.

The old adage that it is good to 'blow out' an engine once in a
while by taking it to redline has some sense to it, even if you
never race.

Concerning this thread on double clutching, can someone explain why it is
better to blip the engine with the transmission in neutral and clutch out
rather than transmission in gear and clutch in.  I assume this is a matter of
wear on the clutch, but would appreciate the education.  I assume a related
issue is the advice I've always heard to put the transmission in neutral and
clutch out at stop lights to reduce clutch wear.  Just how much friction is
there with the clutch in?

Bob, (excuse me a moment while I don nomex...unnngh... grunt...ummmph) I know
leather is cool and everything, but I recommend cloth, as in common, cheap-as-
dog sh*t, brown cotton work gloves.  They give good grip, they are warm in
cool weather (I've used 'em all week with the top down here, and the temp has
ranged between 50 down to 30 - ok, I cheated & put on a set of GI wool liners
inside the cloth today, but the temp was 25 when I did).  The best thing is
that they give you great feeling, which I've always felt leather robbed me
of.

I keep a set in the driver's door pocket, and will 'em to my frau for the 
garden when they stretch too much or get nasty.  They're handy if you need
to change a tire, check the oil, or do anything else that could get your
hands grungy.

Hmmm....

Double clutching itself (the act of putting the shift in neutral and
letting the clutch out, setting the engine revs, then pushing the
clutch back in to complete the shift) does nothing for the rest
of the drivetrain. The trans is in neutral when this is done.
How could it affect the rest of the drivetrain?

What does help the rest of the drivetrain is to set the engine
RPM when letting the clutch out after the gearchange has been
completed. And this can certainly be done without double
clutching.

Maybe this is a terminology problem. Maybe I'm bored 'cause
there's just about nobody else at work this week...

Hmmmm, must be the season, but this triggered several (both) of my remaining 
sysapses to join-up again...

The day I picked up my new '66 327/350 Corvette from the dealer in Marlowe, OK, 
I started immediately back to Lawton (and dear old Ft. Sill).  You go south
about 5 miles, on US 281, then hook a right onto OK 7, then straight for
about 40 miles, and break when you hit Lawton.

Well, at the turn onto OK 7, 7 is 4 lanes for about 100 meters, then becomes
2 lanes for the rest of the trip.  An 18 wheeler was in front of me as I
came upon the turn, and danged if he didn't turn west also.  As soon as he 
cleared the turn and a lane was open, I blasted by.  60 MPH in first, shift 
to second, watching the tach for redline.  Just as I started to pull the 
shifter into third, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, the speedometer needle 
sweep past 90.  Mortar Forker, I gently whispered (read, "shrieked"), 90 mph in 
2nd; I *am* gonna love this beaste... Drove it that way up to the last, and 
never a hiccup!  (Of course, in fairness, I should note that "the last" arrived
at about 17K miles, but that's another story.  And the engine lived on, at
that...)

what do I know???

Subject: A Question Re: 914 1st Gear and Double-Clutching

Let me preface by saying that I double-clutch on all of my manual-tranny
cars (4 have band-type synchros, 2 have cone-), and I have yet to wear out
a tranny or a clutch (some > 80,000 miles). And three of them are driven
hard!  I'm not a tranny-abuser ...

What troubles me is why it can be so hard to get into 1st gear on the 914
when at a stop? I know about getting into 1st before coming to a stop, etc.
 Going into 2nd (or 4th) first is not always sufficient - usually I have to
get the car _rolling_ from 2nd to go into first.  The tranny (newly rebuilt
w/all new synchros, < 3000 miles) shifts like a dream at all non-zero
speeds, both up and down through the gears (thanks, John!).

My understanding of this 914 "idiosyncracy" is that the dogs on 1st gear
are of the usual square-peg-in-a-sqaure-hole variety, but without chamfered
"tips" to them.  (I'm not a tranny expert, so please excuse my perhaps
incorrect terminology.) Hence, unless things are lined up perfectly between
the carrier and the gear they just won't go in. I've been told that all the
"earlier" trannies are like this, and I cannot believe that it has anything
to do with Porsche's use of band synchros over, say BMW's use of cone
synchros. 

Alfas (dream gearbox, admittedly) also have band-type synchros, and they
never have this problem, though they are quite susceptible to 2nd-gear
synchro wear. 

Any enlightened comments or explanations will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: 914 accelerator stuck

In Porschephiles Issue #1038 Chris Fender asked about a sticking accelerator 
cable on his 
1973 914 2.0 . . .

While you could be right that it is the pedal cluster bushings, the problem 
I ran into with my `72 914 1.7 was an improperly grounded engine case that 
caused the accelerator cable to be used as a grounding wire.  This, of 
course, generated quite a bit of heat, melted the plastic sleeve the cable 
is housed in and would cause ever-increasing drag until the cable seized 
completely.  Since you described the system working properly for a short 
period of time, I think this scenario is likely.

Unfortunately, if this is the case you will need to replace the cable again, 
ground the engine block (my current -- excuse the pun -- `74 2.0 has a thick 
wire running from the fan shroud to the battery's negative terminal) and 
test drive.  Do others have a better solution?

If you're right and the pedal cluster bushings are at fault and they are the 
stock plastic type, you will want to check your brake master cylinder for 
leaks.  This isanother typical problem with the model.

Good luck!

Remember there was a thread about Porsche dealers having better prices on

I need fresher stock torsion bars for autocrossing, so I called some Porsche
recyclers for used low mileage T Bars. Oklahoma Foreign had a set of front
bars from a late model 911 for $200, which I thought was a bit high.

I went to my local dealer and new factory bars are CHEAPER!!!!

I used to get parts cheap from Oklahoma ($200 for a 2.4/2.7 crankshaft, when
others were about $500). I guess they aren't cheap anymore...

So it pays to check the dealers for parts, EVEN USED!
Now if only I could find some used rear spring plates with the rubber
bushings in good condition (the dealer wants $350 each)...
I got and returned a set of "good" ones from Foreign Intrigue in Maine, but
they were worn out on top like mine.

All the comments so far seem to have missed a point about double-clutching:
it is properly used both on up-shifts and down shifts, if you do it
correctly.  Blip the throttle on down-shifts, DO NOT blip it on up-shifts.
 It's a technique that was required on earlier cars (and trucks) having
unsynchronized transmissions (not just unsynchronized first gear, but
unsynchronized all-gears!)  In today's modern cars (at least off the track)
it can be debated if it's worthwhile: is the accelerated wear on the clutch

occasionally use it when shifting into first while rolling along at a good
clip.  Happy New Year!

when something breaks, I'll tell everyone.
 
Way to go, Eric. Yes, the 356/912 engines were revved to redline (5500 for
C, 6000 for SC/912) right there at the factory. That makes sense; that way
you can tell if everything works like it's supposed to. I take my SC to 6000
and beyond (we regularly peg the tach at slaloms, and I know that the tach
reads about 200 rpm low at 6000). So far, in 60K miles, nothing internal has
broken or even gives sign of getting tired. On the street, I touch 6000 on
upshifts. I can cruise comfortably at 2-3 K on city streets with adequate
torque for accelerating if max performance is not needed.
 
Limiting a 912 to 5000 rpm isn't called for. It will take more, unless
the engine is in very questionable shape.

Subject: "Amco" Bars???

I am looking for a set of "amco" bars. They are the bars that connect the 
bumperettes on early 911/912. Let me know.

Mitch,
There are a few special tools required to rebuild the 911
transmission (known as a 915 style)

The only transmission noises I've heard occur during shifting. These are
fixed by replacing lots of the syncro parts. So I don't know about any
howling or moaning noises.

 - A hydraulic press is essential to press on and off the various
  gears and assemblies on the two shafts.

 - Syncro hub tools are helpful but not strictly necessary.
  (page 168 of 20th anniv. Automotion) I have one of these for 1st & 2nd.

 - An assortment of big metric sockets - not too expensive to buy as needed

 - There are a few small parts to be aware of - The back up light
  switch has a small pin in the end casting that may try to fall into
  the transmission if you have it propped vertically during initial
  disassembly or final assembly. Also there are a few detent balls, pins
  and springs located under 2 bolts accessible from outside the trans.
  All these are well detailed in the manuals. I recommend using a torque
  wrench on these bolts during final assembly.

 - One of the first things you'll see inside the transmission is the big
  nut holding 5th and reverse together. The old-timer's trick to holding
  its shaft still is to put the trans into 2 gears at once. And I used a 5
  ft piece of angle iron with 2 holes drilled in it to hold the case still
  while cranking mega-torque. You'll probably want a torque wrench to
  tighten this later.

 - Mark the position of the shift forks on the shafts if you move them.

 - The service manual says to use two special tool to get the nut off the
  input shaft. This nut holds the 3rd & 4th gear syncros on. Depending on
  the condition of your transmission, you might skip this part of the job,
  or do what I did - hold the shaft from turning by clamping a clutch disk
  in a vise and turn the nut with a big pipe wrench.

 - The 2 large thin shims that set the pinion depth are susceptible to
  bending if you're not careful. These are near the clutch under a plate
  held on by bolts that requires some perseverence to get off.

 - I found Gary Fairbanks Co. to be very reasonable on prices for
  parts & gaskets.

 - You'll need the giant allen wrench to refill the transmission with oil,
  and Swepco 201 makes for better shifting than Mobil synthetic.

 - Finally, transmission oil is very smelly so think about where you're
  going to be working.
