Subject: 911sc FI questions


   I've got a question for any FI gurus out there...

   My car, 1980 911sc, has been getting hard to start in the mornings.

   My suspicions:
	 I suspect the warm up regulator or the cold start valve.  The WUR is
	 my first guess as I believe it controls the CSV.  I've also heard bad
	 things about the WUR for this model.  One person said "oh
         yes, thats the warm up reg, replace it with the later model"
         ('81 or '83).  However, at $250 (automotion), I'm not about
         to use the shotgun approach. 

   Questions:
	 Aside from the obvious (what's wrong?), is there a sensor someplace 
	 that could be causing this problem, i.e. WUR and CVS ok, but getting
	 bad information about engine condition?

The WUR does not control the cold start valve.  The cold start valve
only operates when the engine is starting by spraying more fuel into
the mixture.  The thermo-time switch controls this by disabling that
function when the engine is already warm.  If your CSV or TTS is
broken you will have trouble starting the car, but it will not affect
idle.

The WUR controls fuel pressure by moving valves in the
fuel distributor.  It changes the mixture gradually as the car warms
up by manipulating the fuel pressure.  The WUR is located in the front
(front being towards the front of the car) of the engine, behind the
airbox.  You have to lower the engine to get to it.  

Your problems sound like the WUR.  There's really not much else that
can change the idle of the car based on temperature.  It can be tested
with a fuel pressure gauge, which is a worthwhile tool if you are
going to do a lot of FI work.  The factory manual describes the proper
fuel pressures for the WUR and the adjustment procedure.  I wouldn't
call it simple, though.

Also, I saw a msg about 944 clutches being $3K.  That would be a
ripoff.  Compared to most non-porsche's, the 944 clutch is a fairly
easy job, and the suspension does not need to be removed (only the
sway bar).   I would say 8-10 hours for an amateur and 4-6 in a shop.
I forget what the book time is, but I do recall it was small.

I heard that 944 clutches are fairly easy as described, but that 944 Turbo 
clutches are the ones requiring substantial labor plus the usual overpriced
parts.

I've never done a 944 Turbo so I can't say if it's different, still
$3K seems steep for what is certainly routine in other cars.  If you
are getting a clutch done I would check around for prices, especially
the dealer, they are *supposed* to charge a standard amount, and any
independent shop should certainly be charging less than a dealer.

  I had my clutch fixed under warantee, but the dealer would have
charged me $980 for the parts and I think it was at least day's
labor.  They took the transmission down to fix a rod?.  The original
clutch lasted me 45K miles.  (I'm easy on a clutch, even a 951 ;->
Too bad the engine only did 55K, 8-<

Interesting mail I received over the extended weekend from AutoThority,

928 Engine Development

Any engine can be thought of as an air pump.  To make more
power, you need to pump more air.  In a turbo, boost is the 
easiest way to do this.  A normally aspirated enginge requires
more work.

Starting with a stock 1981 928, we set out to improve the 
engines's ability to breathe.  Our efforts were concentrated
in the camshaft and valve areas.  Larger intake valves were 
installed with new valve seats, and the cams were ground to 
emphasize mid-range power.  Many hours were spent on the flow 
bench improving the port characteristics.  Finally, the heads
were shaved to give an increase in compression ratio.

To give us the flexibility we desired in tuning, we adapted 
our COMPUTERIZED ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (C.E.M.S.) to the 
engine.

After a careful break-in, we spent many hours testing and
tuning on our SuperFlow engine dyno.  We tried both the stock 
U.S. intake system, including throttle body and intake
runners, and the larger European version.  The European parts
yield similar results except at the top-end, where there was
a clear horsepower advantage.  The final configuration
topped out at just over 300 horsepower (SAE net, corrected).

On the street, the engine has tremendous pulling power and
fantastic throttle response - the type you can only get from
a large displacement V8.

This package can be duplicated or expanded in a number of ways.  
We can supply the components to duplicate these
results, or we can provide a complete turn-key job at our location in 
Fairfax, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C.
If desired, we can continue from this base-line with
further development.  We will be happy to discuss your needs individually.


>>>>> End Mailing

Some interesting things to note.

1.) They milled the heads (And had to mill the intake manifold) to increase the
compression.  (I've talked with Mr. Anderson at "928 International" about 
some pistons they are developing to have the same aluminum expansion characteristics as the sleeves, they should be available in different compression ratios.
Has anyone out there heard or had experience with these pistons?)

2.) They use a different engine management system.  (I talked with Paul at
AutoThority and he said they used a TEC unit and did the programming themselves.
Has anyone had any experience or heard of this unit?)

Paul said he would send me a break down of prices for the work they did

Subject: 74 914 2.0L Limited Edition prices
Cc: cork@enceladus.cs.rice.edu

I'm contemplating purchasing a 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 Limited Edition
(VIN 4742915093).  I'm interested in knowing how much I should offer for
the car.

The car has approximately 100,000 miles on it and
has very little rust.  The owner claims it has no rust on the inner rocker
panels, but I haven't yet inspected the car on a lift.  The car spent
most of its life in Florida, and the last three years in Texas and
Mississippi.  For the the past three years the car has been driven very
sparingly (3K miles total).  The motor was
rebuilt 5K miles ago.  The air-conditioning system has been removed
and the fuel injection system has been replaced by twin Webers.  The console
does not meet the dash, because the air conditioning vents and ductwork
(removed by the owner) fit in the gap. The
car has been completely or partially repainted in the original white with 
orange trim color scheme; the quality of the repainting is mediocre and
highly variable.  Some panels look perfect; other look like amateur work 
(which suggests it was partially repainted).  For an 18 year old car that
is intended for driving rather than concours shows, the car looks surprisingly
good.  The Limited Edition front spoiler has been replaced by an aftermarket
metal imitation.  The radio has been removed and replaced by a modern
Blaupunkt (sp?) unit that the owner wants to keep. 
The owner has all the original parts except the radio: fuel injection
system, distributor, and fuel pump, and air conditioning system, and damaged
but repairable front spoiler.  He has an assortment of spare parts (brake
calipers, seats, etc. taken from a wrecked 1.7 liter car).  

I drove the car and it feels tight and solid.  The engine seemed strong,
but did not run as smoothly as a modern fuel injected car when I lifted
the throttle (which is not surprising).

Assuming the car passes inspection as the local shop reputed to know the
most about 914's (Euro Car Werke), how much is the car worth? The owner
is asking $5200.

There's no wire to adjust the clutch.  It's all hydraulic.  You can measure both
release lever travel and wear through an inspection port on the bottom of the
bell housing.

Regarding price, a friend had his 944S' clutch replaced not too long ago, and a
motor mount done at the same time.  The total bill came to about $2K, parts and
labour.  This probably included an alignment, since I know the mechanic likes to
realign the car after changing a motor mount.

There is no substantial difference, to my knowledge, in the time and effort
required to change a 951 vs. 944 clutch.

Subject: 951 Clutch

Here's my personal experience:

18 hours shop time (It was my time, but that's what the dealer charges)

Parts: $600 for clutch, to, pp
       $10.00 or so for "Cheesehead" screws on clutch (must be replaced)

That's it.  Period.

The procedure is:

Pull trans
Pull Exhaust at coupling to turbo outlet pipe and at 3-screw connection
on crossover pipe, after disconnecting wastegate hose (wastegate comes
out too)

Diconnnect ground strap at motor, pull 2 speed sensors (NOT THE THIRD)
as on 944. 

Remove starter and slave cyl.

Remove all exhaust hangers including that for wastegate

Unbolt torque tube (4 bolts) and slide back about 8" (this is a bitch
because it has hangers on it to keep it from moving in accident

Pull TO lever

Pull Bellhousing

CAREFULLY remove 12 cheesehead screws, use drill if necessary.  DO NOT
USE EASY OUT!
(Above refers to pressure plate)

Replacement is reverse of removal.  You can save some time by unbolting
slave but leaving it hanging out of the way by the fluid line.


The above is from memory but gives a decnt overveiw.  The only special
tools highly recommended are:

17 and/or 19mm flex-head sockets from sears (bellhousing bolts) and 2'
extension and a 12pt allen (cheesehead) wrench available at pep boys.
You'll need this for the axles anyway.

One last note:

My dealer said he wanted $1800 for the job.  As such I enlisted the help
of a freind (Glenn) to help me out.

After it was all over he said "Boy! that was fun.  Next time you need to
do it, just give me a call......I'll help you go door to door to raise
$1800.


'
You don't need a lift but the car should be at least 12-18" off the
ground.  I reco0mmend cinder blocks under the tires AND jackstands, just
for safety.

Subject: 911 wreck

Well, it finally happened.... some idiot rearended my 911 doing
about 40 MPH. The rear bumper is pushed down about 4", the rear
valance part behind the tire is *touching* the tire on both sides,
there is about a 1" gap under the targa glass between the bottom
of the glass and the top of the metal (that should be covered by the
gasket).

The good news is that the engine and mechanicals all pass my mechanic's
scrutiny (except maybe one of the heat exchangers and the muffler). So
that leaves the bodywork. 

Anyone out there ever lived through this before? Anything in particular
I should watch out for? Or is this just a hope and pray and sell the
car quick deal?

I lied!  I was chatting with my mechanic today, and he corrected my
misunderstanding of the 951 vs. 944 clutch.  The difference is the stuff that
needs to be removed when doing a 951 clutch: the single-part cross-pipe which
appears on earlier 951's.  According to the manual, you also have to remove the
intake air manifold; I dunno why this is.

He also told me that PCNA has just put the prices up on 951 clutch sets, to $928
list I think.  Apparently PCNA allows ridiculous times for clutch replacement. 
If you decide to have a dealer do one, this may be a point to bargain on.

Hey, I only learn things when they break on my car!  I still have my original
clutch (but maybe not for long...)

Subject: 20w-50 Oil in the winter?


Well its is getting pretty cold here in Northern Cal, lows around 40
degrees at night , highs maybe reaching 65-70 during the day.  Does
anyone know if my running 20w-50 oil is to thick for this climate?  I
have a '73 911T.  Most of my driving is in the order of about 10 to 15
miles at a time and the engine reaches full operating temperature most
times I drive.  I am not doing any really hard driving or extended long
high speed drives either.  I was thinking of dropping down to 10w-40.
Does any body have any suggestions?

Just a reminder, due to EPA regulations (if I'm not mistaken), manufacturers

check very carefully for rear suspension damage and in particular the 
torsion tube which runs the width of the car and anything connected to it
such as trailing arms.  It is critical to making the car drive in a straight
line and expensive to fix.

If it has been replaced, it will have an accordian style bellows on the

I believe that the EPA requires 5/50 on the emissions system of the car.
The dealer should have a list of what's included as part of the emissions
system.

Subject: 15x8 Panasports for 914-4

I'm trying to find 15x8" wheels for my 914-4 (4-bolt, please don't suggest
going to 5-bolt, because I can't).

Anyway, Panasport will make them, but they'll be way cheaper and be available
way sooner if they can make lots of them.  (They'd have to make them up new;
there is no standard 15x8 mold, and the 3-piece is not available in 15".)

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else would be interested.  If I can tell them
that I know there are several people interested, they'd be more likely to do
it soon and do it cheaply.  At a rough estimate, the wheels would be about
$250 - $275 each.

If you are interested, please reply and let me know.  Try to give me an idea
of how interested you are, and how many wheels you might want, and I'll try to
put it together.  Let me know if you want more information.

Thanks!

As far as I know they had to replace the crossover, the manifolds, and
the short tube to the wastegate as a unit.  Our dealer replaced this as
a matter of course with a clutch job since it all had to come out
anyway.

I just sent a similar message to the autocrosser's mailing list and the
porschephiles mailing list.  I apologize to those who are seeing it more
than once.

I'm trying to find 15x8" wheels for my Porsche 914-4.  Panasport will make
them, but they'll be way cheaper and be available way sooner if they can
make lots of them.  (They'd have to make them up new; there is no standard
15x8 mold, and the 3-piece is not available in 15".)

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else would be interested.  If I can tell them
that I know there are several people interested, they'd be more likely to do
it soon and do it cheaply.

At a rough estimate, the wheels would be about $250 - $275 each.  The offset
would be somewhere between 30 and 38mm, which works out to roughly a 5"
backspacing.  The bolt holes and center hole are drilled/machined after
casting, and the offset can be slightly changed by machining after casting.
I don't know for sure if they can do a 5-hole bolt circle, but they can
definitely do 4...  The Porsche circle is 130mm, which is rather large.

If you are interested, please reply and let me know.  Try to give me an idea
of how interested you are, and how many wheels you might want, and I'll try
to put it together.  I don't need commitment, just intention.  Let me know
if you want more information.

Your night temperatures do not get near cold enough to switch from 20-50.

Here in Chicago it gets quite a bit colder.  Admittedly I keep my car in
a garage which only gets down to about 40deg, but I use 15-50 Mobil 1 year
round.  Unless it was getting below about 10deg regularly would I switch and
then I would switch to Mobil 1 10W30.

The synthetics have several advantages, they flow freely in real cold weather,
I get oil pressure right away even at 5deg above with 15-50 and they do not
experience viscosity breakdown until much higher temps than ord. oil and in 
an oil/air cooled car like a 911, this is important.

For what it's worth, my car had the manifold replaced and did not
have that crossover pipe replaced under warantee (16 months ago).
I sure would be interested if anyone has had both the manifold and
the crossover replaced under warantee. My latest price quote on
the crossover and elbow pieces is ~$800. Since my current one piece
crossover does not fit well, I am inclined to replace it this winter
when I do my clutch job (assuming, of course, I can find a used one).

        Reply to:   944 Turbo info sought.


(Please reply to me directly, I am not on the list porschephiles since the
address change.)

Sorry to bother the group about this, but I am looking for experiences/opinions
about 944 Turbo (or 951 for those into project numbers :->) with regard to
reliability. I remember seeing comments a while back but unfortunately I didn't
save any of the msgs. 

The particular car I am looking at has 34K miles, 87 model year with ABS,
telephone dial wheels, airbags on both sides (to protect my groceries), is
receiving a major tune-up, timing belt. I drove the car prior to the service
and thought it ran quite rough, alignment, balance were completely off, I also
heard noise from either steering pump or belt at full lock. THis concerns me a
bit since the mileage is quite low, since I heard bad things about the
suspension (A arm)

Here's what I know about the generic problems:

1. Water pump, how often does it fail?

2. Timing belt. 

3. Cooling system? radiator?

4. Motor mount. Again how often?

5. Lower A arm??

6. Kevein Gross mentioned the upgraded exhaust manifold, ceremic port liners,
what year were the upgrades done?

7. #2 bearing failure prone, from people who take the car to the track.

8. How is this beast on snow? with snow tires? what brand? Does anyone run them
on regular VR or ZR tires? what brand? My experience is most (all?) of the ZR
compounds are undriveable on snow. I live in the Boston area. Does anyone have
recommendations for service places etc..

9. Do all 944T from 87 on have ABS?

10. Prices? this car is being asked $14.5K. is this high? considering all the
services will be done prior to selling? It will also need 4 new tires.

11. Were most of the changes between 86 and 87? of course ignoring the latter
944Turbo S variance.

  My 86 951 has a slow leak in the steering system somewhere, every 6
months I have to had a pint of fluid to the resevoir.  Check the
steering fluid level, it could be it's just low.  Top off with Mobil ATF.

  The only thing I've heard was for people doing track time, it can

  I still have the original (55K miles).  I am going to have it

  No problems, changed every major service.

  I burst a radiator hose, drove home okay, but it took a week to get

  I've dealt with snow with my RE71's on Rte 128, et. al.  It can get
stuck, you must be very cautious.  I got everywhere I wanted to go,
but I always had to wait for plowed roads.

  I got Bridgestone RE71's for about $142, good street tire.

  I lost compression on #4 cylinder, cause unknown, yet.  I'm saving
for a spring rebuild.  The 951 is very expensive to maintain.  I've
spent $1500 a year over the last four years, exlusive of my upcoming
rebuild.  It sure is a fun vehicle though!

  I've received some shop referals if you're looking for a mechanic to
check it over.  I would say 14.5K is too high, more like 12K, but each
to their own.  Shop around.

Jay -

There are two places I would begin to look for the fluid loss.  The hoses from
the reservoir chronically leak at the reservoir.  You can reduce the seeping by
replacing the original solid metal band+machine bolt style hoses clamps with
garden variety worm-drive clamps.  Reduce but not eliminate.

The second place to look is at the steering rack.  Jack the car, remove the
belly pan(s).  Thoroughly clean the rubber boots at either end of the rack
(Simple Green and water or whatever).  Then pull back each boot and look for
fluid in it.  If you have any but the slightest amount of brown fluid, the rack
or its seals are damaged.  (The reason for carefully cleaning beforehand is that
you want to avoid getting grit inside the boot.  It'll chew up the seals.)

There's a place advertized in Pano which sells rebuilt racks.  Could be the best
route if yours has a problem.  I inspected a 928 for a friend a few years ago,
and found a leaking rack.  He bought the car, had his mechanic put in a rebuilt
unit (source forgotten), and has been a happy camper ever since.

Random.  Wait for noise or leaking fluid, then take care of it ASAP.

(Grumble, grumble.)  Current religion is retension at 30K, replace at 45K. 
Retension at 2K after a replacement.

> 3. Cooling system? radiator?

Very few problems.  Once in a while an oil/water heat exchanger leaks.  I heard
of one case where lack of clearance between the lower hose and power steering
belt caused rubbing and failure.  (There is a service bulletin for this problem
on 928's.)

Random.  Not a calamity when it does happen.

The pre-85 1/2 cars had stamped steel VW arms which, when tracked, were prone to
fatigue.  Not an issue with later cars.

He's an idiot; I would ignore anything he says.

Received wisdom is that conn rod bearings have about a 60- to 70-hour lifetime
when thrashed at the track by a very aggressive driver.  I know of no failures
personally (except maybe the Curtains car?).

The compounds or the tread patterns?  I revert to my 215-wide P6's for the
winter.  No good when there's more than an inch on the ground, but this is
Boston.  No doubt the car would be superb with 195's.

Not an unreasonable price.  The service work isn't much of a factor.  What I
would look out for is needed major maintenance (clutch, water pump) or body
problems.

- ABS as an option, plus accompanying major changes to front suspension 
  geometry, different wheels (23.3 -> 52.3 mm offsets)
- side moldings
- luggage area cover
- air bags
- tranny cooler an option, no longer std
- split fold-down rear seats
- headlight washer system option, no longer std
- sport suspension package
- new audio equipment, seating options

I believe that what Kevin has stated is the current factory religion.
The current PCA wisdom seems to be retension every 15K, and replace every
30K, with retensioning 2K thereafter.

At least the normally aspirated 87 944s had an o-ring problem in the oil to
water intercooler, which was the (apparently) last remaining vestige of
more complex problems on earlier cars in that area. I know a number of 87
owners who went through it, but I don't know many 87 turbo owners. Look
for any sign of whiteish muck in the water reservoir, in particular on
the top of the inside of the reservoir using your finger.

The early cars had a fatigue problem in the arm itself when they were tracked
relatively hard and long. The later cars have a fatigue problem in the
stem of the ball joint under the same circumstances, which requires replacement
of the whole arm. I wouldn't worry about it in a car you are buying unless
there is other evidence that the car has been tracked a lot.

There have been a number of examples of this other than the Curtin's. The
current wisdom seems to say it is a function of HP output as well as
how hard the car is driven. Worry more if you start "chip-ing" up the
boost. I don't see any issue here in evaluating a car for purchase unless
it has been tracked hard.

Subject: 944 Turbo info: some wisdom?

I now have an 89 944S2. Prior to this one, I had an 85 944:

1. Water pump, how often does it fail?
     on my 944, it did start leaking a little  at about 30K.  It never
     actually failed.

4. Motor mount. Again how often?
    on my 944 I had to have it replaced twice. Once at 30K and again at 50K.
    The lore has it that the 944T mount did not have the problem of the
    evaporating fluid. PS: The only symptom was a vibration at idle.


8 How is this beast on snow?
    Both my 944 and 944S2 are 100% horrible in the snow They wore Pirelli P6,
    Bridgestone RE71 and Pirelli P700 at var times.  I have gotten stuck
    numerous times on only very slight upgrades.  Also, merely getting off the
    gas will often provoke a slide.  (I find you can avoid the slide if you
    declutch while you get off the gas.)  Much as I LOVE my 944, I must say
    that it is really awful in the snow.  Maybe it would be much better with
    snow tires.

Just curious, 

How ofter do you change your oil?  Doesn't the synthetic oil run about 
$5/qt?

I run 20-50 Kendall (SF bay area, 30 degrees is COLD here...) and change it
about 3k to 3.5k miles.  I always get immediate oil pressure.  I seriously
doubt that the viscosity changes significantly during this time (3-5 months).

My car is a 1980 911sc.  I hear the  older 911's ran somewhat hotter, but 
the only time I see the temp gauge higher than just into the operating 
range is during an auto-x  There, I've gotten perhaps 2/3 of the way across
the normal range.  I think the low end of the gauge is about 180 degrees, 
I'm not sure of the high end. 
 
I also seem to recall being told that the single viscosity oil breaks 
down more slowly.  This was attributed to multi visc. oil really being 
light weight oil with additives to raise the viscosity.  Anyone have any
solid information on this?

Hey, what does everyone out there do with their used oil?  Where I live the 
curbside recycling service takes it away, but without that I would have a 
problem.

I have a friend that drives his 944 ('84 I think) in the snow on a fairly
regular basis (lots of skiing).  He has a second set of wheels that he 
keeps snow tires on.  If anyone is really interested, I will find out what
size tires he runs.

Also, I have a set of Centerline wheels (23.3 offset) for sale.  They are
15 x 7 so about the narrowest tire you could use is a 195.  I want $250 for
all four (what I paid, you benefit from my bargaining ;-)).

Well, I actually figure I save money (or at least break even) by running
the synthetic (Mobil 1) oil.

Around here Mobil 1 is $3.48/qt+tax, I use 4 qts, thus $15.03 per change.
Castrol is $1.19/qt, thus would be $5.14 per change.
thus I spend an extra $9.99/change on the oil.

HOWEVER...
I get an extra 2mpg with the Mobil 1 (23mpg vs 21mpg, I am NOT conservative
with the gas pedal).
In 3000mi with castrol I spend ~$188.57 on gas ($1.32/gal super unleaded)
In 3000mi with Mobil 1 I spend ~$172.17 on gas
Thus I spend $16.40 less on gas using Mobil 1

$16.40 saved
-$ 9.99 extra
-------
 $ 6.41 total savings per oil change

If it is only a 1mpg improvement I would only spend $1.42 extra on the
better oil

Also there are the other benefits: Easier starts, quieter running, no valve
chatter from the slow-to-fill lifters, easier revving, etc...

Subject: Cam chain questions

I've been looking into the cam chain options for a '74 911, and have been 
getting a confusing set of alternatives, both from the list and from the
various vendors (Performance Products and Automotion). The guy at Automotion
seemed very surprised at the notion that the cam chain should be replaced
regularly (meaning 30,000 to 45,000 miles), and seemed to think that such
would be a waste - he said something along the lines of "those are basically
good 'till rebuild time". I've seen recommendations from the net that the
chain should be re-tensioned at 15,000 intervals, replaced at 30,000, and
retensioned after 2,000 miles. He then went on to describe the update kit they
have for the new-style tensioners, costing $520 (less todays discount), and
also indicated that the old-style tensioners with a special guard that they
sell might be a better option since it's about half the money. The guard 
prevents the engine from lunching if the tensioners fail - the new style 
tensioners, he said, could not be guarded in this way, although they are less
likely to fail. Performance Products basically had the same upgrade kit for 
about the same money. What's the story? Should the chains be replaced (they
have about 60,000 on them)? Should I go with the old-style tensioners with 
guards, or the new-style kit for twice the money?

Soren,

I use the same oil change interval as you do, 3-3.5K miles.  Mobil ! costs
3.99 at Trak Auto, 3.69 on sale.

remember, an oil would have to be pretty darn expensive to cost more than 911
engine work.

I take all my use oil, gallons and gallons to the local Amoco station, at least
in this area they accept it for recycling with no hassle.

I have installed a calibrated oil temp guage, I highly recommend it.  the 
non calibrated guages can not be relied upon.  It probably would not hit the
red till 280 to 300 deg.

I have found that I never go over about 230 even in the hottest weather, but
I have seen 250 at a Road America PCA event on a warm day.

I would strongly recommed carrera tensioners and you should not pay over
400 for a set, see the various ads in Panorama.  I have heard both ways on
replacing the chain, but when you do the tensioners, you should also replace
the chain rails, they are usually worn.

Subject: Clutch Answers?

6 Dec 91

Rubber versus spring centered: I don't know, but can discuss my 85/1, which
developed a shudder -- like the car was going to launch itself into orbit --
at 52K.

To my amazement, the problem turned out to be the rubber center of the
clutch. There was NO clutch slippage. So the bottom line is that I had to
replace a perfectly good clutch (for mucho $$$) because the rubber insides
were shot. Needlesstosay, this did not make my day.

Meaning? Maybe spring centered is the way to go.

Hey - don't be so apologetic. Your 924 turbo is as much a Porsche as my
944 turbo which is as much (or more? :-)) a Porsche as the 911.
Modern-day 911-philes seem to forget that the first Porsches contained
lots of non-Porsche (VW) parts (I've heard it called the ultimate
hot-rodded bug). The beauty is in the final product, not in whose name
is stamped on the window cranks...

All of the discussion of frequent replacement and retensioning of timing
belts (not chains) applies to the 944 series, which uses a "gilmer" type
toothed belt to drive the cam(s). These belts, as in many other cars which
use them, are subject to breakage (actually to srtipping off enough teeth
for the crank and cam to move independently). The probability (and it is
an issue of probabilities, as Kevin Gross will verify) of failure is
increased by age and lack of tension, hence the guidelines on both
retensioning and replacement.

The 911, by contrast, uses a chain to drive the cams (actually, 1 for
each cam), which, as suggested by the suppliers you spoke to, is good
to rebuild time, if not longer. The achilles heel of the 911 is the
means of maintaining tension on the chain. Since the chain cannot stretch
like a fiber belt, it cannot be tensioned with a fixed position tensioning
roller, like the water coolers. The air cooling, which involves higher
temperatures and therefore more thermal expansion, also play a role.
The tensioning system for a 911 therefore has a means to adjust slowly
to changing spacings between the chain sprockets while maintaining
a constant tension. It needs more than a spring due to the high dynamic
loads of opening valves at speed. From its inception, the 911 used a
tensioner which is essentially a piston and cylinder full of oil, with
a one way valve to let oil in but not out, and a small spring to push the
piston out as far as possible. the piston and cylinder would leak very
slowly to allow slow but not fast adjustments in the direction of a
looser chain, and the spring would take up any slack in the chain when
it was not under tension, with the oil cylinder preventing it from
moving back.

The problem has always been that it takes a very clean system to prevent
the one way valve from leaking, and causing the chain to lose tension
(which in turn can allow the chain to jump to another tooth on the
sprocket, letting the valves hit the pistons). The original 911s simply
used splash engine oil collected in a cup like arrangement on the top
of the tensioner. In 1968(69?) the 911 went to a fully sealed tensioner
with an internal oil supply, which seemed if anything to fail more often
than the old open cup type. Porsche then went through a bunch of revisions
of the sealed tensioners, without ever fixing the problem completely.
In 1984 they changed the fundamental strategy from a sealed unit to
a unit fed with pressurized oil, thus providing a continuing supply of
oil to balance any leakage. To my knowledge this pressure fed system
is essentially bulletproof, and, with varying degrees of difficulty,
can be backdated to any 911.

Are you confusing 944-series cam belts with 911-series chains?

I'd be interested in learning, from those of you who've had negative experiences
with 944's in the snow, what size (as well as type) tires you're using.  There
is such a difference, imho, between my off-season 215's and my in-season 225's
and 245's.  I've no doubt that, were I to go to 195 real M&S tires, the
difference would be even more impressive.

Like, there's nothing inherent, to my knowledge, in the 944's design that makes
it any worse than any other 2,900 lb. car in the snow.  Or am I wrong?

Subject: Re:  Cam chain questions

The recommendations you've seen from the net are about retensioning a 944
timing belt.  I've never heard of anyone replacing the timing chain of a 911
except at rebuild time - however that is exactly what I am doing to my car
right now.  Why one of my chains suddenly decided to stretch I don't know...

Get the new style Carrera tensioners for your car - the guard that is put on
the old-style ones is a piece of crap.  I have these guards (had as of
yesterday) on my 83-style tensioners and the guard had slipped up the
tensioner shaft so that it wasn't doing anything useful.

You can find the new Carrera tensioners for as little as $350 for a kit
(minus some studs which you may or may not need and the spacers for the
idler arms, which you may not need if you've had the tensioners replaced
before like I had).  Ask the seller explicitly what is included in the kit.

This is common to all '87-forward cars, to my knowledge.  They changed the
design of the inside of the exchanger case and, bottom line, blew it.  There
have been new versions of the o-rings to correct the problem.  I don't know that
any pre-'87 cars had this or any other oil/water heat exchanger problems.

The symptoms I have seen are a little different from Frank's description.  Look
for oil scum in the coolant reservoir, "iridescence" as you peer in the top
after removing the cap.  Look also for a coffee-and-cream-coloured blob stuck to
your oil dipstick.  Look for service managers telling you, gee, it must be the
head gasket.

Right.  There's a whole list of stuff to look for in 951's that have been
tracked.  With absolutely all respect to their owners, I would just stay clear
of any car that had been tracked.  There are so many street-only/"garage queen"
cars on the market, why bother with one which has been on the track unless you
know the owner and the car real well?

For 944, 944S it is about 19 mm front and rear.  It's pretty unusual to wear out
rear rotors; fronts are the ones which go.  Whatever pads you get, it is
preferable to match fronts and rears.

Replacing rotors is very straightforward.  Be sure to torque the calliper bolts
properly when you put them back on, and be sure to pump the brake pedal a couple
of time to re-extend the pistons before driving off.

944's in the snow:

Last season I had the original Goodyears on a 951S, and it drove rather
well considering the size of the tires. The ABS was flawless, but you
just had to take it careful. In terms of comparison, I'd say it
holds the road just as well as a Mercedes 450 SL/C, if anyone has driven
one of those in the snow.

This year I have the RE71s...

I would assume that the 944 would be inherently excellent in the snow, 
like its predecessor the 924:

    "Near-ideal 48/52 per cent weight distribution made it a much
     easier car to drive fast...  This was clearly underlined by an early
     ice race where only a highly-developed 911 Carrera could do as 
     well as a brand new 924 of half the power."

                       Sloniger _Porsche 924 928 944_, Osprey 1987

I run 924 rims on my 4000q and occasionally put them on the 931 with
165/70 Nokias for winter joy rides. The thing is just great on snow
with the right tires, and with that damn turbo and rear drive it's
fun and challenging as well.

Thanks for the responses concerning the coolant that is running out

I looked into the workshop manuals for the 944, and 944T and the only info
I found was a picture indicating that the heater valve is somewhere underneath
the oxygen sensor. No information about how to check it or how to replace it.

I'd appreciated if anyone can give some more info about the heater valve.

Subject: Clutch Answers?


   Rubber versus spring centered: I don't know, but can discuss my 85/1, which
   developed a shudder -- like the car was going to launch itself into orbit --
   at 52K.

   To my amazement, the problem turned out to be the rubber center of the
   clutch. There was NO clutch slippage. So the bottom line is that I had to
   replace a perfectly good clutch (for mucho $$$) because the rubber insides
   were shot. Needlesstosay, this did not make my day.

   Meaning? Maybe spring centered is the way to go.

I'm surprised no one else responded to this, but with all this traffic
it may have been missed.

Spring centered clutches are definitly the way to go.  The rubber
centered clutches (on ANY car) are often referred to as "exploding
clutches".  You wont experience any slip if the center goes (unless
the rubber gets caught between the clutch and flywheel) the purpose of
that part of the clutch is to absorb the initial impact when the
clutch is engaged.  When it goes you will feel a shuddering whenever
the acceleration on the clutch changes direction.

Subject: oil


I hate to bring up oil, it's always so overdone, but there are some
changing opinions out there now...

More and more lubrication experts are saying that 10W30 oil is the
best oil to use YEAR ROUND.  In the summer (and especially at the
track) your oil will run cooler, your engine does less work moving it
around since it is thinner, it lubricates BETTER, and the viscosity
stretching technology has advanced to a point that there is no added
temperature vulnerability (as there used to be in the lighter oils).
This means it will not break down (or gunk) even at track
temperatures.  I've heard from Valvoline that their racing and turbo
oils will work up to 300 degrees (oil temp), and withstand engine
temps in excess of 500 degrees.  Standing policy has been that 250
deg. oil temp is when you should stop, but Valvoline is saying that
that's been increased.

Also, more and more people are claiming (empirically, Mobil will not
officially verify this) their gas mileage AND horsepower gain from
using synth oil is noticeable.  Synthetic oil also has about a 200
degree wider range of temperature tolerance (about 50 colder and 150
hotter).  Vavloline is coming out with a synth oil now, too.  I
definitely recommend synthetic oil during the winter if it gets below
zero (F).  Even 10W30 oil below zero is dangerously thick, and
synthetic oil flows quite smoothly.

Subject: 914 engine stand?
Organization: AT&T Network Systems, N. Andover, MA
Reply-To: vwp@cbnewsk.att.com

Gee, there seems to be a lot of activity here lately.
To get back into the air-cooled universe, I have a question regarding engine
stands for 914.  I'm hopefully going to rebuild the beast before too long, and
I usually check the various mail-order catalogs for general pricing when I
need something, then get it locally if possible.  In the case of engine stands,
there seems to be a very expensive one for ~$400, down to ~$25 dollars for a
'fits VW and air-cooled porsche' from JCWhitney (not that I would go for that).
Is there somewhere I should look to get a good stand inexpensively?
Thanks.

It was pointed out to me that my calculations were based on a car that only
used 4 quarts of oil vs the 12 that a 911 uses. Well, they were also based
on a car that started out with 21mpg.
the figures were
(for 4 quarts and 21mpg start)
  @2mpg improve : $ 6.41/3000mi saved by using Mobil 1
  @1mpg improve : $ 1.42/3000mi extra to use Mobil 1
I was told by a local 911 owner that he gets ~18mpg, thus the numbers would
be:
(for 12 quarts an 18mpg start)
  @2mpg improve : $ 7.67/3000mi extra to use Mobil 1
  @1mpg improve : $18.09/3000mi extra to use Mobil 1

there is nothing wrong with neutral handling in snow, I agree with the other
comment, if you buy a set of narrower steel wheels and much narrower radial
all season or snow tires, the handling will improve dramatically.  You will
also avoid the effects of winters on your alloys.

Rubber center clutches were used on early 911 SCs,  At the time I purchased
mine (1987), virtually everyone I knew was changing to spring center whether
or not the clutch was worn.  This was done because the rubber center usually
goes before the disc and when it goes it can jam things up something awful.

silky smooth engagement is no reason to have a rubber center clutch, although
I do not thing they are that much smoother than a spring center.

the local warehouse clubs, sam's club etc... sells engine stands which are
pretty sturdy for about 35-40.  For any engine stand, you may need some
sort of adaptor fixture to attach your engine, unless it is a chevy or ford.

George -

I have a five-point Simpson harness in my car.  My mechanic has made up a bunch
of telescoping bars with flanges on the end.  The flanges accept the original
seat belt's B pillar bolts and span between the pillars.  The shoulder belts
loop over this bar and snap onto eye bolts threaded into the rear seat's two
points, keeping their angle pretty much horizontal and thus eliminating the risk
of spinal compression in an incident.

He has also had some belt-material cross pieces made up to slide over the
shoulder belts to make up for the fact that the sewn-in original cross piece
falls right where the seatback does!  I tried to do without, but ended up
stitch-ripping the original piece out and putting in this piece.

I know these bars have been put in pre- and post-85 1/2 944 series cars and
911's without a hitch, perhaps other by now.  The only adjustment consists in
bending the flanges a bit to best match the angle of the B pillar.

Oh yeah, the lap belts snap into eye-bolts put into the original lower two
points.  So the OEM three-point harness remains in the car as well, fully
useable.  I use it every day.  I also added the anti-sub strap via an S-hook
into the seat frame's front cross piece.  You don't really need it given the
seating angle, but I find it helps locate and tighten the whole harness a bit
better.

If interested, call:

Needless to say, I have no financial interest in this matter.

Response:
	Several years ago I worked at a shop that specialized in performance
street car suspensions.  The objective was to make the car handle the best
on the street but still please the week-end autoX type.  The philosophy
was to eliminate as much body roll without making the car ride like a truck.
Assuming shocks were functioning well, upgrading swaybars and bushings,
using sticky tires, and a non factory alignment, provided subsantial handling
improvements.      
	Stiffer shocks can actually deteriorate the cars handling on rough
roads as well as cause your dental bills to increase.  This is not to say that
new shocks don't help.  They probably will, depending on how stiff they're set
to, and what type of road conditions you plan on driving through.
	The negative arguement is that sway bars can transmit shock from 
one side of the car to the other.  But the sway bar twists like a torsion bar
when subjected to nasty impacts like pot holes.  The shock reaches its limit
through its valving and can transmit a greater force opon striking a pot hole.
Its a real solid "bang" feeling that makes you want to call city hall to
repair the roads.    	
	Gas shocks can help this problem.  I think Koni sells gas shocks now.
I have been out of the suspension world for years now but I am sure you 
will get loads of updated info from others.  
	Back in the early 80's we setup hundreds of different cars this way
 and had a lot of happy customers taking freeway off ramps without slowing
down much, including several from the PCA.

Bob -

Weltmeister makes front and rear sway bars for the 924S.  Call Automotion for
application details.  Whether they are appropriate for the driving you are doing
is a question I don't know enough to answer.  Perhaps someone else can.  I would
recommend Fred Puhn's book, "How to Make Your Car Handle".  It's on my own
over-winter reading list.

Subject: Turbo replacement in a 951S

I'm reasonably certain that the bearings in the turbocharger of my 951S
failed on Friday.  While I driving on the freeway, my engine failed
respond with the usual surge of power when I accelerated to
pass another car.  I looked at the boost gauge and verified that the
turbocharger was not producing any boost (a reading above atmospheric pressure)
even at moderately high rpm (4-5K) and large throttle openings.  The failure 
was sudden and unexpected.  Less than a minute earlier, I had accelerated 
hard in third gear on an open stretch of road.  There were no preceding or
accompanying symptoms that I could detect, e.g. unusual
noises or vibration.  Except for the absence of boost, the engine seemed to 
be performing normally.  Since I suspected possible turbo failure,
I quickly got off the freeway at a nearby exit and stopped at a
friend's house.  As I came to a stop, I noticed that my car was
producing black oil smoke out the tailpipe.  I shut off the engine and decided
not to drive the car anymore.  A few hours later, I had the car towed to a
local garage that specializes in rebuilding Porsche engines.

The mechanic has not started working on my car yet, but the symptoms match
those I would expect if the bearings in the turbocharger failed.  My car
has 36,000 miles on the odometer; 19,000 of those miles were put on the
car in Germany by the original owner.  (My car is an American
model that was delivered to the first owner living abroad in Germany.)
If this diagnosis is correct, should I buy a new turbocharger or a rebuilt
one?  What is the cheapest source?  Should I consider installing a higher
performance turbocharger such as the turbocharger (produced by Windward
Performance in Vermont) used on the Andial 951S in July 91 Pano?

The Windward turbocharger is tempting because it is less expensive than the
best price I have found on a new replacement and competitive in price with
units rebuilt to original specifications.  Windward Performance reportedly 
makes some modifications in rebuilding 951S and 930 turbos to improve
the efficiency of the turbocharger and produce more horsepower.   I don't know
enough about turbocharger technology to understand what improvements can
be made in the rebuilding process, but I was impressed by the fact that
Andial installed the Windward turbocharger in the 951S they tuned for
the Pano article.

Corky -

A friend, Jim Selders, had his '86 951's turbo rebuilt last summer by Turbo City
and was pleased with the results.  His had started leaking oil, although if
memory serves the leak was external and was dealt with before it became
catastrophic.  Rebuilding was definitely a lot cheaper than replacing it!  Give
him a call at 617 861 1721 (home, EST) and he will be happy to give you the
details.  Apparently getting the turbo out then back in was a learning
experience.

Just make sure the replacement turbo is water cooled.  Most aren't.

I have not heard of any 951 turbo failures.  Had it not been for[B the
smoke I would assume the boost bypass valve was stuck.

I got an engine "real cheap" when the previous owner replaced the turbpo
then the motor in search of lost boost.  Turned out to be the bypass
valve.  (thet little top hat looking think on the throttle inlet pipe
with the hose on the top.)

Pardon my typing - 2 broken fingers.

Is lasting 30K good for a 951 turbo?

What devices does the car come with to extend turbocharger life?
   a) watercooled bearing housings
   b) electric pump to continue cooling housing after key-off (ala Audi)
   c) electric oil pump for turbo bearings

Is the 951S any better is this regard than the 951?

Lasting 30K miles??? That's BAD! I have not heard of any car which died
before 60K, at least not any that weren't tracked seriously (which are then
recommended to get the bearings replaced every so often). I have heard of
951s with over 120k miles and no engine replacements.

As to your "electric pump to cool off" I often notice that the pump (or some
pump) keeps going. I see the coolant resevoir in agitation then, so I assume
it is the water pump keeping going, so you don't cook your turbo (a la
the old 924 turbos).

Subject: New 911 owner seeks advice

Hello -

I have just recently purchased a '77 911S because the 914 -> 914/6
conversion seemed to be taking a long time :-)  I know that it would
have been cheaper just to fix up the 914, but common sense wasn't working
that day, and it seemed pretty cheap.  In general the car seems 
to be in pretty good shape, but there are a few things that I would 
like to fix.  
The car has 95k miles and has been repaninted white.  A 1 piece fiberglass
tail and carrera emblem was added (the previous owner thought it was a
carrera!  He was quite bummed when I brought this to his attention).  The
oil cooler developed a crack and put mondo oil on the ground at startup
on the second day :-(   I have replaced it, and the car seems to be
drivable again.

Electrical:  1) Where can I find a good source of information?  The wipers
		do not stop where they are supposed to.  Both turn signal
		lights are on all of the time (except when turning then
		the opposite one flashes)

Exhaust      2) The 2.7 has those whacky catalyst thingys under the
		cylinders, and I was told that they tend to heat things
		up higher that I want... Is this true? What is a good
		source of stainless header/exchager and muffler?  I 
		do not want to increase the exhaust noise too much.

General:     3) I read the autox group too.  I want to join the 
		PCA (I think) and was wondering if there is anyone
		in my end of the world (N. End of Seattle Wa) that
		I could _talk_ to about joining PCA, and where to
		get parts/etc

Oh yeah, I do almost all of the work on the car myself.  My brother
thinks that we should weld on some carrera fenders, but He has one
with the "turbos" and it seems HUGE.

In general I like the car, its not perfect (yet) but It will be getting
better in the future.  Also I am in the process of rebuilding the
2.0L on the 914 and would be interested in any advice on buiding a
reliable putt around town engine until I become rich and can put 
in a 6 cylinder.

My neioghbors are accusing me of trying to collect a whole set, but
I think that I will need to get a big garage to do that!

Well, I am not in Seattle, but your local Zone rep for PCA is Don Murray,
6110 79th Ave., SE, Mercer Island, WA 98040.

You need to join PCA and start receiving Panorama.  One of the first purchase
suggestions I would make, prior to buying parts, if you can wait, is the 
appropriate volume(s) of Up Fixing Der Porsche, a collection of technical 
articles from Panorama.

The thing you describe as a converter is probably a thermal reactor, meant
to make things run hot and burn off the pollutants.  It is counterprodutive
to the long term survival of your engine.   For example, Imparts, among 
others, sells a complete change over kit to stainless steel SSI (the best)
heat exchangers, free flow muffler, oil lines...etc.  The kit costs $1275
for your car and would probably make a noticeable improvement. Their tel.
number is 1-800-325-9043.  I have purchased from them in the past.  But, get
an issue of Panorama and you will see many other vendors.

good luck...

Subject: Old Porsches never die, they just tilt over on their suspensions


I have been dumping money and time into my 1966 911S recently and have a few
questions to pose to the collective wisdom of you fellow porschephiles.

I'll start with the easy ones and get to the harder ones.

1)  On the dashboard on either side of the hazard lights are two switches.
One lights when it is pulled out, the other looks like it might have lit at
one time but not any more.  What do these do?  The driver side has a small
orange light, the passenger side has a 3/8" diameter glass lens that might be
white.

2)  The control for air/heat, which way is which?  This is the lever on the
underside of the dash to the right of the steering column.

3)  I just recently noticed that the passenger side of the car is about 1/2"
higher in the front and 1/8" higher in the back.  Suspension travel/firmness
seems normal.  The car has been lowered 2" in the back and 1 1/2" in the
front, has koni catridges in Boge struts in the front, and koni's in the
back.  It also has the thicker "S" anti-sway bars front and rear.  There is 
not much rust (none actually) so I don't think its a broken floorpan oor
something drastic.  But, I'm not sure when this started happening, as I just
noticed it last night after putting new tires on the car. 

BTW I got BFG Euro Comp T/A's in 195/50/15 in front and 205/50/15 in back,
total price including tax, balancing, mounting, and swaping my old spare was
$411.  Pretty good for a local tire shop and not mail order.

Im memory is getting fuzzy, but on my 67 911S I believe that the foglight
switch had an indicator light and was next to (or at least on the same
general area) as the headlights. I believe there was a similar switch
with a light for the rear window defroster (look for small vertical
(yes, vertical) lines in the center part of the rear window, assuming
it hasn't been replaced).

My (poor) memory is that the lever just opened the vent for fresh air
from the cowl. Heat was turned on and off with the lever on the floor,
and with the control for the separate gasoline fired heater in the
"contraband compartment".

It sound like a simple case of ride height mis-adjustment. The front
wheels have separate ride height adjustments, and cranking the RF up
would seem to create roughly your symptoms (significantly high RF,
modestly high RR). Note that there are lots of tricks to measuring ride 
height accurately, and equal heights may not be the right objective,
depending on your proposed application. For ultimate performance,
equal weight is optimum, which may not correspond to equal height.

Subject: 911 that hates taking me to work

OK, here is one for you people who know about 911 engines.

This happened this morning on entering the parking lot at work after
a 5 minute drive from my house.

Idle was up around 2000 RPM (this has happened a couple of times before).
The RPM needle then started swinging between 2500 and 4500.  It then started
moving up around 5500 RPM.  The engine sounded like it was around
2000 RPM and not changing RPM.  At one point the RPM needle stayed on
0 for awhile.  The engine then sounded like it was idling at maybe 500
or 600 RPM and it sounded like one or two cylinders were not firing.
I got out and opened the engine compartment and it felt like puffs of
air were coming out of the air intake.  The engine ran for maybe a total
of a little over one minute, when it was missing, before I turned it off.

The car will be going back to the shop but I would also like to hear if
anyone has any ideas about it.

I took the car in last week for its annual tuneup and drove back to work.
When I tried leaving work the fuel pump was dead.  Banging on it a couple of
times got it started.  It now has a new fuel pump.

Maybe I should have titled this
           "911 develops affinity for parking lot" :-)  :-(

these symptoms sound familiar though.

It's cold there, right? 5 minutes is not long enough to warm up the engine
when it's warm out, let alone 10 degrees (which is the current outdoors
temperature here in MA.

> Idle was up around 2000 RPM (this has happened a couple of times before).

Details! FI, carb, manual/auto choke... ? Sounds like FI... and fast idle.
As if the car is not properly warmed up...

> The RPM needle then started swinging between 2500 and 4500.  It then started
> moving up around 5500 RPM.  The engine sounded like it was around

This sounds rather a lot like a flakey tach line. This has happened to me
in more than one car - the 914, and the Rx7. Cleaning the connectors and
crimping them a bit so the contact was more secure fixed it in both cases.


> At one point the RPM needle stayed on
> 0 for awhile.  The engine then sounded like it was idling at maybe 500

That's sounding more like an engine-related problem. Could be fuel injectors,
dirty plugs, clogged fuel filter, valve adjustment, valve seats, piston rings,
just about anything. Hopefully just bad plugs - when you make a bunch of short
runs in the cold (such as a 5 minute commute in the winter) the plugs will
tend to foul more quickly than usual, due to extra rich mixture and ever
properly warming up.

> I got out and opened the engine compartment and it felt like puffs of
> air were coming out of the air intake.

Sounds like a misfire, alright.

>            "911 develops affinity for parking lot" :-)  :-(

Perhaps it's trying to send you a message... like "work hard, it's time
to spend money on me".
Good luck!

Electrical:  1) Where can I find a good source of information?  The wipers

      The best (possibly the only) source of electrical info is the factory
      shop manual.  The Hanes manual has diagrams for some cars.  However,
      their diagram for the year after my car ('80 911sc) is A LOT different
      than the wire in my car.  Either there were a lot of changes, or the
      diagram is incorrect.

      Yes, its true.  Just whack the sukkers off.  Get a copy of Panorama
      and look through the ads in it.  I've seen complete sets of SSI 
      heat exchangers for about $1300 and individual exchangers for around
      $400.  By the way, they are thermal reactors, not (I think) catalytic
      converters.  Anyway, the do make the engine run hot, which shortens the
      life of a short life engine.  Another mod you might consider is to 
      replace your fan and pully.  I am pretty sure that '75-'77 all had 
      the small fans to keep the engine running hot.  Automotion (and others)
      sells an upgrade kit.  It runs about $300.

 
General:     3) I read the autox group too.  I want to join the 
		PCA (I think) and was wondering if there is anyone

Oh yeah, I do almost all of the work on the car myself.  My brother
thinks that we should weld on some carrera fenders, but He has one
with the "turbos" and it seems HUGE.

      If you are going to auto-x in the PCA I would get the local rule
      book before starting any fender changes.  In my area (Golden Gate 
      Region, Zone 7) there are seven catagories that one may run in.
      The two most popular for 911's are stock and production.  Stock
      allows almost no mods, your proposed exhaust system changes would
      move you to production.  You might be able to change fenders as long
      as you can demonstrate that whatever tires you run would fit under the
      stock fenders.  On the other hand, you might not be able to...  I 
      can't remember and zone 7 rules may or may not be the same as yours.

Greetings,

I am currently looking into purchasing a 1974 911 Targa and I was wondering
if anyone has any advice I should consider when thinking about this purchase.
Details are as follows.

    Red 911 Targa
    56K miles
    White leather interior
    A/C
    Original stereo (I believe)
    Dealer wants $8200

Is that a good price??  The car seems to have no rust and everything looks to
be in decent shape.  As this would be my first 911 (I have previously owned
a couple of 914's), what should I look for?  Any help would be GREATLY
appreciated.

Thanks

Its about 35 - 40 degrees F out here and wet.  I know that the engine doesn't
get warmed up very fast but everything has not gone haywire all of a sudden
like this before.  The drive to work yesterday was a little colder with no

It already knows I spend a lot of money on it so maybe its saying,

Check out the electrical system, specifically: ignition.  This might explain
why both tach and engine seem to be behaving badly.  

I encountered a similar problem on mine that I'm still in the process of 
chasing down.  Some of the culprits could be things like ground straps 
(thanks for those who brought this to my attention in an earlier thread), 
distrib cap/rotor, bad coil, etc... 

 My tach acted in exactly the same manner and mine is very definitely an
electrical problem.

Good Luck,
Drew

Three of my favorites (on 911's) ...

Paul Frere's "Porsche 911 Story" (I think that is the title - the book is at home) is
excellent with detailed descriptions of the changes to the car itself, the engine, gearbox,
running gear etc.

Bruce Anderson's "911 Peformance Handbook" some history (including stuff on racing) and is
a must anyway for all the tech stuff.

If you are interested in the detail differences between the older cars the "911 Guide to 
Authenticity" (I can't remember the author) is an excellent source book.

Greetings,
 
I am currently looking into purchasing a 1974 911 Targa and I was wondering
if anyone has any advice I should consider when thinking about this purchase.
Details are as follows.
 
    Red 911 Targa
    56K miles
    White leather interior
    A/C
    Original stereo (I believe)
    Dealer wants $8200
 
Is that a good price??  The car seems to have no rust and everything looks to
be in decent shape.  As this would be my first 911 (I have previously owned
a couple of 914's), what should I look for?  Any help would be GREATLY
appreciated.
 

Kevin,

The '74 is the first of the 2.7 liter cars.  I describe the 2.7 as the 911
engine from hell.  However, the '74 is the best of the 2.7's.

Pros:

No smog pump or thermal reactors.
Light weight car, pretty fast.

Targa body.  Many people like them.

Cons:

2.7 liter engine.  Short life.  Pulls heads away from cylinders by over-
stressing the case where the cylinder (not connecting) rods thread in.  The
Divlar inserts will cure this problem.  Find out if the divlar inserts have
been installed (I would not take the dealer's word on this...).

Body and chasis are not galvanized like the '75 (or post '75?) cars.

Targa body.  I know some people like this body.  However, it flexes (like 
a 914) and if you want the best handling, this is not the best choice.  One
mechanic told me that many (most?) targas flex enough on the fork lift style
lifts that the doors will not open when they have been lifted.

Red.  What can I say?  I don't like red cars.  C'est la vie.

Bruce Anderson (911 performance handbook) estimates about 70k miles per top
end, and a complete rebuild every other top end.

If you do buy the car, I would drive it 'till the engine croaks, then replace
it with a 3.0 liter.  This would be a GREAT car.  All the relibility of an
SC with (about) 300 pounds less weight.  I've seen complete 3.0 engines in 
Panorama (ad said for 2.7 conversion) for about $5500.  I suspect the engine
was used, not rebuilt (perhaps new top end?).

$8200 is probably ok if the car checks out well from an independant mechanic.
$7000 would be good.

Suggestions:

Remove all light lenses and the headlights to check for rust.  Run your hands
around all the wheel wells (on the inside) to check for rust.

Read the "911 Performance Handbook" ($20) by B. Anderson.  Particularly read 
the section on buying a used 911, and on the 2.7 liter engine.

With a 2.7, I would insist on a leak down test as well as a compression test
when the car is inspected.

Observations:

Falling in love with the wrong 911 can cost you a fortune.  Buying a cheap
911 can be very expensive.

The AC on my '82 911SC works just fine here in Utah (100+ degrees F. at times
in mid-summer).  Just keep the belt tight and the freon charged.

I just got the car back from the shop and they couldn't find anything.
They checked the wiring, ground straps, distributor cap, plugs for
indication of water around them, etc.  My mechanic told me if it
happens again to open up the engine compartment to see if I hear any
sparking.  He said it is possible that something is generating an extra
signal and confusing the CD unit, or maybe the CD unit is acting up, or...
The shop has had a whole bunch of cars show up this week with wierd and
difficult to find problems.

Good luck to you too.

Subject: Pirelli Tire Question


I got two Pirellis P700Z 205/55R16 (88 V) to replace the front P7 in a 87
951 from mail order (What is the 88 number?).
The tires came with sidewall arrows that I assume they represent the direction
of torque which will pull the tire together.
Christopher Welty in his "1991 Tire Update" (Reprinted from the Porsche Post at 
Tue, 22 Oct 91) indicated that for Yokohama tires "the direction of the arrow
should point opposite the direction of rotation, and rear tire arrows with
the direction of rotation". I wonder if this true for Pirelli tires also.

I took this morning the car to the Merchants and they claimed that the arrow
should point at the direction of the rotation in both rear and front wheels.
Besides that, they refused to install the new tires because they claimed that
the VRs are underated since the car is coming out with ZRs. I looked
in my owners manual and it does not even mention ZRs. Apparently they were not
very happy that I bought my own tires. I intend to write them a "nice!" letter.

Thanks in advance,
Tassos Markas

PS. The coolant that was coming out of the clutch housing was indeed a heater
valve problem. I fixed that and everything is ok now.

Not to second guess the fine details of manufacturing, but the arrow
really refers to the tred patern and its ability to get the water out
of the way.  A reverse mounted tire could actually force water towards
the center rather than out.  This is usually the reason that the 
dirrection arrow is there - for the tread patern's water expulsion
rotation need (think if it as a vane pump, one way it sucks, the other
it pushes).  
The H and V rating has nothing to do with if you should mount the tire.
If you do not plan to drive over 90 an unrated tire is fine.  Since
the speed limit is 55 they have no reason not to mount the tires.

Tassos -

I'd call Pirelli and ask them for their recommendations.  Their number is 
800 327 2442.  I know that with Yokohamas, the arrow's directions should
nominally be one way on the driven axle (rear for us), opposite on the other. 
Which means we put the A's front-left and rear-right, B's elsewhere.  Perhaps
the same is true for Pirelli; they can tell you best.

I agree that tach symptoms along with any kind of poor running point to
a likely ignition problem, using the "try to find one problem which
explains all of the symptoms" approach. However, most tachs operate from
the primary side of the ignition somehow. I'm not sure what your mechanic
was doing looking at distributor cap, plugs, etc. Does this mechanic have
a good track record with you or other Porsche drivers? 

I don't know how the tach tap-off works in your car, but if I had to
guess I would guess at the CD box. Do you know anyone with a similar
car (or at least a similar CD box) that you could swap with for a few
hours? Also, does this car still have points, or some type of inductive
pickup for timing? These are also candidates. A shorted turn in the coil
is also on the list. There is not much else to go wrong, assuming a
steady supply of battery voltage.

the reason for the arrows being reversed on the front tires is too improve
braking.  traction is better on the rears with the arrows pointing in the 
direction of rotation, conversely, traction is better under braking on the 
fronts with the tires reversed.

Subject: Pirelli Tire Question


So far as I know, only on Yokohama high-performance tires is the arrow
supposed to point in the direction of applied torque, all other brands
I've seen have the arrow pointing in the direction of travel for water
dispersion but I don't know that for sure for Pirellis.  As Kevin
suggested, the best thing to do is call Pirelli to make sure.

To other respondants to Anastassios message, please be careful in
giving advice when you don't know what you're talking about.  Yokohama
arrow indicators are not for rain dispersal (yokos don't disperse
rain), nor does reversing them increase braking.  The arrows indicate
the way the tire was manufactured, and the direction in which the most
torque can be absorbed.  Due to the process in which the tires are
made, torque in one direction tends to unwrap the rubber, and torque in
the other direction tends to tighten it.  The arrow indicates the
direction of torque which tightens.  On Rear wheel drive cars, the
direction of highest torque on the tires is different on the front
wheels (which absorb all the braking force) and the rear (which absorb
all the accelerative force), so the arrows should point in opposite
directions. 

Again, though, as far as I know this is only true for Yokos, and only
for the A008 line.

I believe it is true for most unidirectional tires.  But yokos are the most
popular unidirectional so one most often finds yoko arrows reversed at the 
front and rear.  

OF Course, if your car is fwd, do not reverse the arrows in front.

Yes, this mechanic is one of the best in the area for Porsches.  He was
looking at those things for signs of water which might be causing shorts.
He has found, on a few older cars, that shorting can generate a frequency
which gets into the CD unit and cause false signals.

I was talking with a guy at a Porsche dinner party and he said his tach
was acting up in his SC because of a bad voltage regulator. Unfortunately
my car didn't stay broken so it is going to be difficult to track this one
down.  The problem only showed up one morning for 3 or 4 minutes.  I have
driven the car several times since then, including in the rain, and it has
ran just fine.

Well, here in Texas, where it never gets too hot 8{) the answer is
"it depends". I had A/C installed on my 911SC using the kit from
I.C.E. It works great, but only on high. You can vary the speed
that the air is flowing, but not the temp with any kind of reliability.
On "most cars", the A/C and heat/vent air flow is via the same conduit.
This menas you can run the A/C and heat at the same time to dehumidify
the heated air in the winter or to get less than totally cold air in the
spring/fall. Not so on the 911s, at least through the SC.

I'm told that in '86 the Carrera A/C was switched over to work the way
most cars do. I know for a fact that the vents are *MUCH* larger, which
has to help in moving air around.

Also, I'd highy recommend tinting the windows. I really helps.

Stan

P.S. Yes, this means I'm back in town and will be starting list maintence
as soon as I've caught up on my back reading... Update on the wreck
damage repair will be forthcoming, but it looks good so far!

Hi - to my chagrin I'm learning that it's nearly impossible to find
a 195/70-15 for my '69 912 (stock fenders, Fuchs 5.5x15).  Some people
recommend 205/65-15 or 215/60-15, but I'm concerned about clearance (I'm
running about 1/2" between rear tread and sheet metal now with standard
ride height).

What's everyone else doing about this?  What tire sizes are working for
y'all?

BTW, I'm looking for an under $100-each tire.  I don't race at all or 
drive 100mph+ often enough to justify VRs.  I just need a good street/
highway tire that won't break the bank.

I think you will find that 195/60 - 15 tires will work just fine.  I had
them on my 914-6, which had similar wheels and clearance.  the tires were
A001-Rs which were great, but not for year round use.  I am now on my second
set of Comp T/A's and I like them, although they are not the ultimate perf. 
tire.  They are pretty reasonably priced from the Tire Rack.

The 195/60 is the common upgrade from the old 195/70s and the diameter is 
probably only approx. 5% smaller.  You can also go to 205/55 -16s on 6x16
wheels which are widely available and not expensive.  6x15 takeoffs are a
result of people like me with SCs going to 7s and 8s from 6s and 7s. 

I have
a pair of 6x16s with Comp T/A Rs (used) which are available for $225 for the
pair FOB Arlington Heights, IL.  The wheels are original Fuchs alloys in the 
proper offset.  The other pair you need should not cost that much more than 
mine.

In any event, I would definitely go with the 195/60s with no hesitation for 
a current performance tire I would go with the Bridgestone RE71s, which cost
a little more than the Comp T/As, but are stickier (if you intend to do some
track events).

Further questions, feel free to e-mail, or telephone me at 312-825-6818 days.

If your really having difficulty getting the right sized tire for a good
price, you might want to try converting to 14" fuchs rims, I'm 90% sure the
offset is the same and they will work (anyone??).

They were offered as part of a comfort pack on the '77 911S with (I think), 
205 70HR 14 tires, and were frequently exchanged or replaced with 15", so
someone might have a set laying around. 

You might try places such as Robert Wood wheels or your local porsche club to
see if anyone has got a set for cheap.  They arn't very desirable since they
are the smaller diameter, which limits type of tire and therefore the  all
out handling capabilities. They may be ideal for your modest uses, since an HR
14" tire is  generally much cheaper then a 15", also your ride harshness 
might be reduced a bit.

I think a friend of mine has a set on his '77 911S, which he may be willing
to part with or trade. E-mail me if your interested.

Hope this helps!

Paul 

P.S.  You might also check in some of the car rags tire advertisments for
      places like Tire Rack, they sometimes have wierd sizes at a decent $$.

The 14" wheels were also offered as part of a comfort package in '70 -- I
have some on my 911T with 185-14 Klebers. I've been waiting for these to
wear out to get some lower-profile tires. Bruce Anderson recommended 195/70-14's,
saying the 205/70's would give too high gearing; I was also worried that the
wheel width might be a little small. Another consideration is that I believe
the 70-71 911's had a little more fender clearance than earlier models, so the
205's might give problems ...

I concur concerning the 5 1/2 x 14 fuchs.  those are the wheels which 
originally came on my 914/6, I immediately upgraded to the 6x15s for the
wider selection of good tires.  I recall that at least in Chicago PCA, it
is was pretty usual to run 195/60 15s on early 911s and 914-6. There are a 
number of tires available in that size.

The same is true of the 85 1/2-forward 944 series.  The larger vents, etc.,
really help the AC, apparently.

Greetings,

I was down at the local Dodge =8> dealer on Sunday, and found a 1974
911T for sale.  It is # 9113100861 according to the sticker.  I could
not get inside since dealers can't be open for business on Sundays here.
The car is listed for under $4000.  It was painted powder blue very
recently, and the paint-prep was not done very well (bad masking, who
knows about the sanding), although the paint itself looks like a pretty
good job with high-quality materials.  The overspray goes well under the
car and completely covers any trace of the old color.  I get the impression
that it was a rush job.  The car is completely clean inside and under
the engine, and there is no evidence of wrecks or their cover-ups.  Overall,
this is a fine car, in very good shape.

Now that you are all drooling on your keyboards, I will ask if anyone
knows why such a fine car would be painted hurriedly, basement priced,
and placed in front of some very nice BMW's in the lot?  My best guess
is that the car might be stolen or of otherwise questionable heritage,
and the dealer might want it gotten rid of.  I know that the T's were
lower priced to begin with, but wouldn't they go for more than $3800
in bad or good shape today?  How should I go about quickly finding out
if this car has been stolen or repoed?  Does PCA keep information on 
stolen cars?

By the way, how much is a PCA membership?  Who do I contact in Colorado?

This is a good question, and it's a good excuse to remind everyone
that ever buys a used car that you should run the numbers first.  Get
the VIN and the Engine serial number and call your local police
department with them.  They can (and are supposed to) check the
various registries to determine if the car or engine has been stolen.

If the car has been stolen, and you buy it, you are out the money you
spent if it's found, and there is nothing you can do.  I know of a
couple people who got bitten, and it's very frustrating.

Subject: 914 parts and suspension help

Happy New Year!!

I finally flatbedded my 914/6 home after 9 months of 
restoration.  To make room for the garage, I am trying
to sell some parts that I am not going to use.  The prices
does not include shipping. Please call me at (908) 758-2880
or Email me.

*****************  PARTS  **********************************
5 911/914-6 wheels  $200 or partial trade for Fuchs wheels.
Original 914/6 Mahle 5.5X15 magnesium wheels, weights around 9 lbs.
sand blasted, primed with Glasuit epoxy primer, and painted
with Glasuit urethane silver. 3 OK, 1 with one ding on
one spoke, 1 with a 1/2" crack on the inside rim (for spare only).

K&N air filter pair for 911  $50
Less than 500 miles on the filter setup. The pair has
aluminum bottom and top with no rain hood.
Not recommended for 914/6, the filters are right under
the engine grill. I got water in the engine 
because of that.

914 sure-flex airdam w brake ducts $50
New, never mounted, too low for me.

2 Konig Prinz racing seats $350 each 
New, never mounted, Black cloth, holes for shoulder and lap
belts, adjustable back (around 15 degree), mounting brackets
can hinge the seats forward to allow rear seat entrance for
2 door cars. 

*****************  WANTED  **********************************
6X15 Fuchs

*****************  HELP  **********************************
I need some advice on 914 suspension setup please.

The suspension needs
to be reset from scratch.  I am going to try to 
align the car myself.  I plan to use it for mostly
autoX and some PCA track events. 
The car has stock torsion bars, springs, Bilstein 
shocks, and stock 914 sway bars.  

-I have the PCA Tech Q&A article by Allan Caldwell on
914 suspension (sometime earlier in 1991). 
Is that autocross setup a good start?
In that article, 914 rear height was said to be 
control by the rear shocks and not adjustable.
Since the Bilstein rear shock can set the rear height,
which slot on the shocks should I set the springs,
or what is the proper height for the rear? Should I set
the rear height so that the rear axles be perfectly 
horizontal? Mark, Nigel, any suggestions?
 
-I saved Calvin's article on wheel alignment. For a 914,
anything I should pay special attention to?

-Where can I get some of those BFG tires(218??)?
I can use some 195/60 15s.


Thanks very much
Alfred

The sale starts 2 Jan, if memory serves.  Prices are $40 - $50 a tire,
selection is limited but healthy.
