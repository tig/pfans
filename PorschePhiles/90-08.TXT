I've lost Scott Presnell's address, so here's my reply.  It might
be of interest to other's also.  I must state up front that I'm
no mechanic- I learned the following mostly by trial and error.
Follow my advice at your own risk. I request that the experts on 
the list correct any glaring errors.

No, I used the two binder Factory Service Manual published by
Porsche (covers from '65 til '71 or '72 and describes how to
adjust the Bosch mechanical injection and linkages and everything
else).  I strongly recommend buying this.  Performance Products
sells them for around $250, I think.  You might post a request to
this list also.  Also see if u can join a local Porsche club.
You might could do some xeroxing then.  I've heard of a separate
book for the pump, but I don't think it's in publication, now.

> How did you adjust the linkages?  Side to side, or the individual links?
> In general, how do you suspect that might be necessary? 

the pump delivers identical volume to each intake.  If ALL the
linkages are not correct, varying amounts of air enters which
varies the mixtures.

My engine was an S not a T, so i don't know if the pump is the
same.  the second screw is behind an allen bolt cover on the
front of the pump- The screw is readily accessible with a
straight screwdriver after you remove the allen bolt.

never examine your plugs after idling a long while.  Do a hard
run, shut it off and let it cool.  Look at all your plugs.  If
they're a uniform color, your linkages are probably OK- look
elsewhere.  I recommend slightly rich, you'll run cooler.

Yes, on the 'blower-accessible' screw. realize its spring-loaded
and you have to push it in firmly to turn it.  try it one click
at a time and drive it hard.  never go more than 2 clicks in
either condition.

on the other screw, try a quarter turn at a time and drive it
hard.  do not change both screws at the same time! Both
adjustments are made with the engine off.

Overheating is an indication of a lean mixture.  Is it running
hotter than in the past?

Use an air flow gauge like Unisyn to check for uniform air flow
at idle and at 3800 RPM.  Clean the inside of your tailpipe and
check for deposits occasionally.

Also don't forget the choke assembley. It's held onto the front
of the pump by two screws and has a hose going down for manifold
heat. hold it firmly when loosening it- there's a spring inside.
Clean the elements in solvent then lube it with WD-40.  You may
also have an enrichment line running from the fuel pump to the
throttle bodies. It should stop enriching after the engine warms
up.  Pinch it off with a clothespin to see if its delivering gas
when it shouldn't.

My problem problem turned out to be that the engine hadn't been
cranked in two months and it mainly needed to be driven hard.  I
also recommend adding STP injection cleaner when your tank is 1/4
full.  This makes it much more concentrated.  Then add it with
every third full tank of 91 octane gas.

By the Way, I sold my Targa (along with the Service Manuals) to
Frank Letts (letts@ficc.ferranti.com) last week, he gave it to
his wife, and she won't let him drive it :-)

NO.  Put your bucks into service manuals and maybe a CO2
analyzer.  Why do you think Porsche put Bosch mechanical
injection into the 2.7RS?  Because it was their BEST.  You've got
one of Porshce's best.  Pre-emission controls, before CIS
injection.  [ Watch the flames from carb users!]

Good luck, keep your revs up,

This brings up something I've been thinking about for a while.  Does
anyone know a source for a reasonably priced CO2 analyzer?  My MAC tool
supplier seems to have only super high priced set-ups for full smog
checking.  K-Jetronic specs alot of things relative to CO2, and I'd
like to be set up to handle that but there is no way even I (an
incurable tool addict - such a sad case) can afford multi-thousand
dollar test sets that check other gases as well and are really only
practical for a commercial garage.

Thanks

P.S.

I switched to swepco a few weekends back and I really like it.
Shifting seems smoother with less effort required.  2nd gear
synchro seems to work better as well although now that I've gotten into
the habit of double clutching on 2nd gear upshifts as well as
downshifts maybe that's my imagination.  Cost me about $35.00 for a
gallon for reference (ouch, but nothings too good for der Porsche eh?)

Subject: F1 engine...


Greetings fellow Porschephiles!  With the F1 season already heating up,
things could turn interesting if Porsche managed to get the F1 engine
into the Arrows cars sometime toward the end of the season.  Who would've
believed a Leyton House would score a second at Paul-Ricard?

>From the rumor mill, the Porsche V12 has been tested on a dyno for
quite some time (rumors of almost 900 bhp @14000 rpm SAE net abound) and
apparently, an engine was fitted to one of Michelle Alboreto's backup
cars for testing at Porsche's backyard track in Stuttgart.  Anybody out
there heard any rumors, good, bad, or ugly?

Thinking about Porsche's last F1 effort (the TAG engine) really has me
eagerly anticipating the end of the season, particularly in the face of
the tremendous bad luck in Indycars this year.

Comments?

Subject: CV Joint Fun

Well, it finally happened: I exploded the outer left CV joint on my 911,
under acceleration, in a corner. Pretty spectacular, indeed.

In doing the post-mortem, my mechanic noted that it looked as though the
CV joints had never been serviced. He mentioned that you should have the CVs
packed and inspected every 50,000 miles or so. Having the service done is
about $180 or so, including grease and gaskets. CV joints are $110 each, and
you have four of them, if you understand what I'm trying to say here....

Just thought I'd pass this little tidbit of info along.

Subject: restoration of a 1966 911

Hello to all.  I am new to this group.  I hope I can some day make
a contribution to it, but for now am seeking advice.

I am considering the restoration of a 1966 (or possibly '65) 911.  I
have gone over the car, and have located two areas in desperate need
of attention.  The first is the exhaust/heating system.  Both heat
exchangers are badly rusted, and the muffler is not far behind.  The
heat ducting looks OK for now.  The other problem area is the brake
system hydraulics.  I intend to replace every rubber part between the
brake pedal and the pads.  All the rotors look OK.

My first question is this: can you recommend your favorite supplier
of parts?  I need heat exchangers, a muffler, and brake rebuild parts.
Once those problems are solved, I'm sure others will surface
immediately, so am looking to establish a long-term relationship with
a single supplier.

Since I am a 911 neophyte, I don't know the specific weaknesses of this
model.  I hope you can help me here, too.  On the early 911s, which
components or systems require the most attention and/or money to repair
or maintain?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experience.

How much does it cost to maintain a 911/12 per year?  What are the

but is that the only difference?  Also, what years were the 912's made?  
I'm assuming the the cost to maintain a 914 is about the same as my type

Mike,

>I thought I'd look at getting a 914 or posssbily a 911/12.

All are good  choices. Actually, any Porsche is better than no Porsche....

>How much does it cost to maintain a 911/12 per year?  

It varies, and depends on how much work you do yourself. Tuneups run about $500 
each or so, and there are people who claim that you really need one a year, 
perferably two. Oil changes are about $90 for 911's and about $50 for 912/914.
You need of those every 3000 miles or so. If you do it yourself, tuneups are
about $200, and oil changes are $30 or $12. Maintenence varies -- I'm
into my 914 for about $2600 over 3 years, and have another $4000 or so to
go if I'm gonna do the tranny and engine soon; my 911 has cost me a tuneup
and a $700 repair over the last year. Who knows?

>What are the differences in a 911 and a 912.  I know the 912 has a 4 cylinder 
>engine, but is that the only difference?  Also, what years were the 912's made?

The 912 is a 911 with a 356 engine; the 912E is a 911 with a 914 engine.
912's were made from '65 through '70 (I think), and 912E's were only in
'76. Makeing them somewhat rare, and hence a pretty good investment.

>I'm assuming the the cost to maintain a 914 is about the same as my type
>III or a little more.  

That's a good assumption, but unfortunately invalid. Type IV engine parts
apply, and are more expensive than Type III by 50 to 200%. And the body
and mechnicals exclusive of the engine are all Porsche.

>Last, but not least, what are the differences in the following designations.

And don't forget the 911L!! Basicly, it's like this:

	911   - basic car

Let's try this (by model year, not calendar year):
 
1965                                   911
1966     912                           911
1967     912                           911       911S      911R
1968     912                 911T      911L      911S
1969     912                 911T      911E      911S
1970                         911T      911       911S
1971                         911T      911       911S
1972                         911T      911       911S
1973                         911T      911       911S      Carrera RS(R)
 
After '73 the US market diverges from the Euro market and the engine
designations and the trim levels get muddied up pretty badly, i.e. US S model
the same as Euro plain model.  '74 Carrera RS gets same engine as Euro 911S
but in trim US and Euro Carrera models are the same.  The 911SC finally gets
things back together again.  Also of note is the US Turbo Carrera is the 911
Turbo (930) in Europe.  Blame the marketing guys and the DOT, NHTSA and EPA.
 
The early models start out with Solex carbs, but by '67 have switched to
Webers for the S model.  The L model and the E model are the same except the L
has carbs and the E uses injection (Bosch mechanical).  The engines on the 911
line get bored out to 2.2 liter in 1970 and stroked to 2.4 liter (with a drop
in compression ratio for emissions) in '72.  The '73 Carrera uses a 2.7 liter
for the street (RS) and 2.8 liter for the track (RSR) though this is of _very_
academic interest to most of us (prices in the $US 100k and up catagory).  In
the US market R&T found the quickest of the early 911s to be the '70 911S
model.  The 1/4 mile published of that car was about 14.8 sec at 92(?) mph.
Of note also is that the '74 models got the 5 mph bumpers which caused a
weight gain of about 500 pounds, coupled with the decrease in compression
ratio resulted in great cars for driving around town, but not able to rev
worth anything, IMHO.  Final commentary, I owned a 912 and it was the best car
I ever drove.  120 mph top speeds and 32 mpg economy.  What more needs be
said.

Didn't they bring out the 912 in '65? I know they were still making C 
and SC 356 models in '65, but I thought you could get a 912 then, too...

But my main question in this mail is what is a 911R? I assume
it's a racing model, but what were the specifics?

The '67 R is where the idea to move the oil tank ahead of the rear
axle (as on the '72 models) came from. Reduced polar moment of inertia,
etc.  I don't recall anything else about it.

Yeah, 356SC models were available for the '65 _model_ year.  The 912 came out
in August '65 for the '66 model year.  So it is true that both were available
in '65, but as far as model year designations go they were in different years.
This is from memory, but I am pretty sure of it.  I will however check up on
it tonight (If I don't trust me, should you?).

There were 18 R models made (and 21 serial numbers assigned).  3 were retained
by the factory for racing and the rest were customer cars.  All used plexi for
all glazing except the windshield (which was a custom thin glass).  There was
extensive use of aluminum and fiberglass in the body work.  The motor used 906
cams and put out 210 bhp (can't remember if that was SAE, DIN, or something
else again).  The cars weighed on the order of 1900 lbs.  The FIA took a dim
view of them and said they would have to race as prototypes, not production
cars (Porsche was up to its eyeballs working on the 917 prototypes, so nobody
was available to put 911Rs together).  theye were the _HOTTEST_ 911 prior to
the Carrera RS in '73.
 
But as I said before, from memory.  I will try to remember to check for
tommorrow.

  From all the information I've been getting from the net and from co-workers, 
it looks like the '76 912 is best for what I'm looking for in terms of lower 
cost to repair and still fun to drive.  I have seen one in the paper for $8000 
with a sunroof.  What is a reasonable price range for a '76 in fairly good 
shape?  Thanks for all those who sent information.

So I second Stan's call to check them if you are at 50,000 miles

My mechanic (now) suggests that I have them checked at 30,000 miles.
After looking at the wreckage of the surviving CV's, I'm inclined to 
agree. Most of the ball bearings were black. Several were pitted. All
races were scored, some looked like they'd been carved on with a 
sharp implement. Ugly. Real Ugly.

Subject: 914 transmission rebuid

I'm the proud new father of a '75 914 2.0.  Overall, it's in good shape,
except for the tranny.  I'd like to rebuild it myself, but I've never
done something like this, and I have a couple of questions:

	1) How long should this process take?  Keep in mind that I
	   basically don't know what I'm doing, but I do have pretty
	   good mechanical aptitude.

	2) Where can I find a good manual on this procedure.  I currently
	   have a Haynes' manual, which is pretty good, but it's not as
	   explicit as I'd like it to be in the transmission section.

	3) What types of tools do I need?  I know the basic stuff (ratchets,
	   wrenches, &c.), but what about measuring devices, any chemicals?

	4) Where is a good, cheap parts supplier?  I'd prefer to find a
	   place in Santa Cruz, but the Bay Area is close enough.  Barring
	   that, mail order would suffice.  I need a place that either
	   stocks 914 tranny parts, or can get them fairly quickly.

Thanx in advance.

One comment: don't do it.

You need a total of about $1200 in tools that are only good for this
activity, and another $300 or so in general purpose machine-shop
stuff that you can use for other related projects.

You can order a precision rebuilt tranny for about $1395. You can get
a less precisely rebuilt for $900. There is no percentage in doing it
yourself.

BTW, mercedes is toying with the idea of bringing the silver arrows
here next year.  that would be boss.

anyone going to the group c race in canada in sept?

also, a great article on the can-am series of days gone by.  real nostalgic
stuff.  i remember going to laguna seca back in the very early 80's to see
them run.  now that was racing... for race fans.  none of this high society
thing where it's chic to be seen at a race.  (esp. cart,  the _month_ of indy,
come on.  i can handle a week, maybe 2, but a month?)

i really wish people wouldn't show up all dressed up, i.e., women in fur coats
in high heels with their "drowned rats" called dogs.  come on!!!! how can you
get to the great viewing placing in heels!!!

just blowing steam.

   I've been considering buying a Porsche this fall.  I like 914's a lot and
I buy cars in the 2000-3000 dollar range.  I usually look for a car in a state
that doesn't salt the highways (I live in Minnesota.)  But, from reading about
all these repairs and such, I think that I'll have to wait until I can afford
a $10,000 car and up-keep for the repairs.  I'm not into racing, but I like
Fast little cars.  I've heard that the 914 has a very responsive steering
linkage, which results in high amounts of wear.  Can you guys suggest anything
for a would-be Porsche owner who can't afford much?

Eric -There are a couple of books on buying used Porsches, and I wouldrecomme

There are also books which go into a heck ofa lot of obscure detail, and they're terrific for concours restoration but probably inappropriate to your current needs.Salt is far from the only thing you have to fear.  Corrosion is a nastything and can appear in all sorts of unexpected places.

(The C pillar is the trapeziodal member rising from above engine and supporting the roof.)I have an article in front of my nose by Bruce Anderson: "Buying a Used911." It appeared in Excellence some time ago, but the footer omits the year. I can mail it to you if you give me an address.  The article also goesinto 914 and 914/6 concerns.The 914's are a lot of fun to own, autocross, and race.  How m

Subject: 944s don't like racoons...


Well, somebody else can make a pretty story about a poor little
racoon and a poor little 944 driver.  I don't have the time but
I just wanted everybody to emphathise with the situation...

Late night driving from San Antonio to College Station.  Stay
in a hotel or just go home...  Oh what the heck, let's keep going.
Shadows of critters in the road.  Jam on the breaks.  But to
no avail...  We're ok, the racoon's not.  But what's that 

horrible vibration coming from under the hood?  And why does
the shaking begin before the engine is running?  Could it be
another fan???  But how?  How could the huge animal jump up
into my engine and eat my fan if there's a nice protective
shield under the car?  Oh, it made a big hole in that too?
And in the heat of the Texas summer, I'm left with a one
bladed cooling fan and a cracked fan housing...  I thought
racoons were smart.  Poor little thing.  Darn it, it wasn't
my fault.  These things happen all the time.  I was the
only car on the road at 4 in the morning and there's only
two lights on the car.  Who says there's a solid object
between them?

Anybody know how to get the racoon out of my engine?  Actually
there's no signs of one there.  But does anybody know
how to take out the fan housing and replace the fan and
the cost of the housing?  The fan is $195...  

We're talking about an 84 944.

James with a red *hot* car.

James Saxon -

You'll need Porsche special tool 9209 to remove racoons from all
normally-aspirated engines.  There's a different tool for the turbo's because of
the risk of fur contamination of the turbo's centre bearing...

Actually, the removal of the fan doesn't look terribly hard.  The workshop
manual says to remove three bolts top and bottom.  And the Haynes manual lists
about seven steps - which is about the average decompression ratio between the
factory manual and reality.

I'll quote you from the updated Haynes manual, having yet to do a fan myself.  
Despite claims to the contrary, the manual is almost 100% focused on the early
944's, with zip on the S and S2, and asymptotically zip on the Turbo and Turbo
S.  All to your advantage.

1. Disconnect the negative cable from the battery.

2. Remove the bracket between the air cleaner housing and the upper raditor
support.  [Illustration shows two bolts on the cleaner, two nuts on the
radiator.]

3. In the engine compartment, cut the wiring harness straps [tie-wraps] attached
to the fan shroud [the piece of metal with a sticker on it right behind the
header panel].

4. Remove the three bolts retaining the fan shroud assembly to the top of the
upper radiator support.  [Illustration: just beneath the headlight side-to-side
linkage.]

5. From under the engine compartment, unplug the fan motor connector adn
disconnect the harness from the shroud, cutting any plastic retaining straps
[more tie-wraps].  [Illustration shows hand yanking plug from fan motor in
centre of the fan assembly, popping wire clips.]

6. Remove the three bolts [these on the bottom, again from underneath] and lower
the fan assembly from the vehicle.  [Suggestion: have a friend hold it from
above during this last step.  Dental work is so expensive.]

Hope this helps.  I don't know whether Porsche sells single fans for this
assembly.  If not, you might try PAR or Kempton Bros. for the needed single fan.
 They might have a corresponding half from a junker.

Well, Porsche is only entering F1 as an engine supplier.  And guess what --
by having someone *buy* their 3.5L atmo F1 engine, they can finance part
of the development cost of their WSC endurance car, which uses, let's see,
oh, it's a 3.5L atmo engine.  :)  No, F1 won't be a strain on Porsche's
resources.

As to CART -- well, the year has been disastrous, but the team has yet to
accomplish its stated goals of winning the Indy 500 and the PPG cup.  The
morale on the team is low, byt at least the people on the team seem to think
that they're still running a March-Porsche next year.

	One comment: don't do it.
	
	You need a total of about $1200 in tools that are only good for this
	activity, and another $300 or so in general purpose machine-shop
	stuff that you can use for other related projects.
	
	
I habe rebuilt several 901 gearboxes with regular workshop tools,
and with reasonable results. If the gearbox has the classic intermediate
plate bearing noises, or perhaps some mediocre synchros, it is quite
possible to rebuild it with a reasonable general purpose tool set
and some ingenuity. You will need to do the operations calling for a press
with a brass drift and a hammer, (unless you have a press or are looking
for an excuse to buy one), and you will need to be careful not to do
any hammer and drift work "through" a bearing you want to reuse.
Mark the position of the shift forks on the shift rods for re-assembly
without the Porsche special tool, assuming they are aligned correctly
to begin with. You can replace the synchros themselves, but not the portion
pressed onto the gear set without the special tool, so the degree of
wear (or non-functionality) may be an issue. I'm not sure I remember
all of the tricks (the last one I did was perhaps 10 years ago),
but most of them are intuitive.

If the condition of the gearbox is worse than that described above,
many of the above assumptions will not be true, and a suitable shop
is probably the better part of valor. Certianly that is true if any
ring and pinion work is required other than perhaps the ring gear
carrier bearings.

Another alternative if you really want to try it yourself (or you are
really cheap, like me), is to find others in your area (through the
Porsche club for example) who have some or all of the special tools. I think
I could lay my hands on most of the factory tools or homemade equivalents
for a 901 gearbox (now that I sold my cars which had 901s) in the
central NJ area. By this point there is a lot of knowledge on the 901
gearbox (and the cars in general) in the Porsche club, so if you try it
and get stuck, you should be able to get advice and perhaps help.
Good luck, whichever way you go.

Subject: transmission rebuid



I would agree with Frank, and disagree with Stan.  If you're a
reasonable mechanic, you can rebuild a transmission.  Here are some
tips, which I actually got from Karl Hens (who is also on this list
but currently in California), as we rebuilt his transmission. Most of
this he learned while working as a factory mechanic for Mercedes in
Stutgart. Some of the information is a little scanty, but I don't have
time to even write this... 

There are some very expensive special tools for adjusting the shift
forks. The fact is, however, that (at least for 901 and 915
transmissions - both of which I have rebuilt) you will not need them
if you do it right.  Both the factory
manual and the Haynes manual tell you during the disassembly
to loosen and remove the shift fork bolts and washers.
If you do that you will need the expensive special tool for later
adjustment. You can keep all shift fork bolts tight and
remove the shaft assemblies (together with the shift forks and rods)
from the housing without ever separating the shift forks from the
shift rods.  Once out of the housing, your shift forks with rods will
fall off and spearate, and you can disassemble the transmission
shafts.  When you reassemble your transmission, you will have to
simultaneously insert the two assembled transmission shafts and the
two shift forks and rods into the housing. You can do this by getting
help from someone (it takes four hands).
Therefore, don't loosen any shift fork bolts
during the disassembly (they are the bolts that clamp the shift fork
in position on the shift rods!).  

Synchros are easy to butcher though.  It's sometimes better to just buy
a whole new gear set with the synchro ring already installed.

The main tool you can't do without is a press.  If you don't have
access to a press you can't do it.  

Also when tightening the nut on the main shaft, rather than getting
the special tool that holds the shaft, you can manually engage one of
the forward gears and reverse at the same time, which locks the
shafts, allowing you to put a good amount of torque on that nut. 

Also, don't expect to do it quickly if it's your first time.  Use the
first weekend to take the tranny apart.  Clean and inspect it.
Determine what needs to be replaced (Only replace what needs to be
replaced - be safe, but don't go nuts replacing everything). Order the
new parts on Monday.  Then use the next couple weekends to finish.
The point is not to order anything until you've pulled it apart, you
save yourself some shipping costs since there will *always* be
something you notice once it's apart.  The other point is don't be in
a rush.  Take your time or you'll just be sorry.  It also helps to
have someone around who has done it before who's willing to give you
advice.  Most PCA regions have a technical committee that love to help
people out.  

Have fun...

according to the aug. 13th issue of autoweek, March and Alfa no longer
have any association related to CART.

i understand that Porsche's March was built to Porsche's specs and
mostly designed by Porsche.  the result is supposed to be quite different
from the March used by Alfa (and others).  Porsche's singlemost source of
problems this year (esp. the early part of the season) were related to
heat from the forward mounted turbos (a feature unique to Porsche).

may the rest of the season (and next?) be more successful.

Subject: Racoons and insurance adjusters...


Hey everybody, it appears that as long as the animal was alive before
you hit it, it's covered by comprehensive insurance!  But how
do I explain that the racoon, or some part of it managed to fly up 

through the bottom shield, ripping a hole, eat my fan blade, fortunately
only one, and then vanish completely.  Maybe I'll find some evidence
on sitting on the shield.  Secondly, how does one get an estimate for
car insurance from a car mechanic???  They always underestimate.  The
body shops always overestimate...  hmm..

I think it's better to just avoid little animals in the road.  Though
I'm glad that when I jammed on the breaks the car slowed in a perfectly
straight line.  Just the way it should.

	There are some very expensive special tools for adjusting the shift
	forks. The fact is, however, that (at least for 901 and 915
	transmissions - both of which I have rebuilt) you will not need them
	if you do it right.  Both the factory
	manual and the Haynes manual tell you during the disassembly
	to loosen and remove the shift fork bolts and washers.
	If you do that you will need the expensive special tool for later
	adjustment. You can keep all shift fork bolts tight and
	remove the shaft assemblies (together with the shift forks and rods)
	from the housing without ever separating the shift forks from the
	shift rods.  Once out of the housing, your shift forks with rods will

You can also carefully scribe the location of the forks on the shafts,
both longitudinally and axially, and then loosen the bolts, using the
scribe marks on reassembly. Actually, if you plan to do this more than
once, you can buy an old 914 gearbox case (frequently very cheap at
a swap meet) and cut the sides away with a band saw to make a fork
alignment tool which is in my opinion nicer than the factory tool.
We did this locally in JSR, but not until after I did several 901s
by the "scribe" method.
	
	The main tool you can't do without is a press.  If you don't have
	access to a press you can't do it.  
	
I have done them with only a brass drift and a hammer. You have to pound the
bearings off of the two shafts via the outer races, thus necessitating
their replacement, but this is frequently planned as part of the job
anyway. Reassembly can be done with only pounding on the inner race
where it presses onto the shaft, thus not damaging the bearing.
The transmissions done this way were fine for many thousands of miles
(I haven't kept track of them recently). It is certainly much easier and
more elegant with a press, though.

Subject: 951 advice?

Well I did it. I'm finally a Porsche owner (not just a Porschephile). About 6
months ago, I decided that I 'needed' a Porsche. At that time, I really wasn't
sure what kind of Porsche that would be (and indeed, waffled back and forth
between air and water cooled several times). As it turns out, I made the
'mistake' of driving a 944T and fell in lust. Despite the ridiculously high
insurance rates, I made the plunge and bought an '87 - 45k miles. It has been
very well maintained (and has had some recent (<5k miles) high $$ repairs just
before going out of factory warrenty: new brake pads, shocks, exhaust system).

So, are there any words of wisdom? (I've already mailed my application for the
PCA - one of my main reasons for buying a Porsche was the PCA-sponsored driving
schools and (maybe) autocrosses). 

What kind of oil do you recommend? The previous owner used Castrol - are
synthetic oils preferred?  How about turbo cool-down? I know the 951 continues
to pump coolant through the turbo to help prevent thermal shock after engine
shutdown, and the owner's manual does not recommend any special driving habits
- how important is it to 'take it easy' for the last few minutes before
shutdown?

Also, the 951 suffers from the same lack of low-end torque as the normally
aspirated 944s. Is it considered 'bad form' to rev the engine and slip the
clutch to achieve better off-the-line performance (without that, I get a
sinking feeling every time I pull out into traffic - that is until the turbo
kicks in at about 20 mph)? For now, I'm hesitant to make a habit of this -
don't want to cause premature death of my clutch... Are the Autothorithy /
Hypertech chips a solution (and how much of a solution)?  Where can I find a
review that tests and compares these chips (a back issue of Excellence or
Panorama perhaps)? I talked to the service manager of one of the local dealers.
His advice (unofficially, of course) was to install said chips as soon as the
car goes out of warrenty. Anyone out there have any personal experiences?

Now I guess I need a second car to drive when the Porsche is in the shop. Maybe
a late 70's 911SC... (wish I could afford one!) Maybe a nice 2L 914...

Steve

BTW, there's a severe drawback to owning a 951. One gets very little sensation
of speed on the highway. If I dont' pay careful attention to the speedometer, I
find myself cruising quite comfortably at 90-100 mph. Thank god for the cruise
control :-). Atlanta traffic cops are known for being somewhat leniant when it
comes to speeds on the interstate (mean speed is about 72 in posted 55), but I
have a feeling my guards red 951 is a ticket attractor... My insurance rates
are high enough!

Subject: Tickets and Porsches


Congratulations Steve on your new car.  Porsches are fun, expensive, and teach
people the real meaning of "an ounce of prevention".  Your last note about
tickets made me reflect upon the common myth that red sports cars get tickets
more often than other cars...

Maybe I'm a special case, but in the three years that I've had the car, I've
never (knock on wood) gotten a ticket based upon my car or its color.  How do
I know this?  Because my three tickets were for speeding in the early morning hours
on long interstates by radar when it was dark.  That's why.
I've been pulled over other times too but I've noticed a different attitude from
the officers since I've been sitting in a sharp 944 rather than an old green Toyota.
They're more polite.  Now, I've got long hair, I wear messy clothes occasionally,
and can act quite strangely sometimes, yet, when a policeman is giving a ticket
to a person who's driving a nicer car than he's ever been in, the tables seem to
turn a little bit.  It's always, "Um, sir, did you know that you were speeding
back there?" rather than (with my toyota) "YOU WERE SPEEDING!  S P E E D I N G,
SPEEDING!"  I mean, I've never had an officer yell at me since getting my Porsche.
It's like the officer is thinking, "well, I wonder which judge's kid this is."

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a reckless driver with a reckless attitude, or
an spoiled bastard, I did buy the car myself.  But getting tickets and keeping
insurance low is not just a matter of luck.  There's an art to it that goes beyond
hiding behind trucks.  There's concern for others on the road, radar detectors,
a healthy attitude about responsability, lawyers, politness, stealth driving,
and also a little bit of luck.  


Now that you have a 'respectable' car Steve, observe the difference in 

your street presence, it's really weird.

Oh, and that lawyer bit...  Let me just note that they can be extremely cost
effective under the right circumstances.  Although I've had two rather
hearty speeding tickets, with the help of lawyers, or the court directly,
and a little plea bargaining or whatever, my insurance record is clean.
Sure it cost me a little bit extra but nothing compared to the $900 my
insurance would have gone up over the three years of having a single ticket.

Steve--

When I bought my '86 951 about ten months ago, the salesman at the
Porsche dealership (he used to be the service manager) told me to
let the car idle for 2-3 minutes before turning it off. Sometimes
I cheat on that if I've been driving really slowly before I arrive
at my destination (such as along city streets), but otherwise I
try to do it. Hey, it gives me time to hear the end of whatever
Pink Floyd song I'm playing on the cassette, and reduces the feeling
that I'm always rushing from car to meetings or whatever.

As for lack of pickup power until the turbo kicks in--well, I guess
that's a matter of personal preference. The first few weeks I had the
car, I found myself attempting trickier maneuvers (such as pulling into
traffic when another car was starting to get close) simply because I
knew I could get out of close situations more easily than with my
previous cars. Luckily, that attitude wore off pretty quickly. Now I
try to judge situations the way I would with a less powerful car, so I
don't cut things so close. It's great knowing, though, that the
additional oommph is there if things get hairy inadvertantly.

To: PORSCHEPHILES@bcm.tmc.edu

Tickets first:

Part of the change in attitude may be your age, James (for the rest of
you, James and I know each other personally.)  I've noticed in the last
few years that Johnny Law treats me a bit differently than he did when
I was younger, and I was driving the same car for nearly 9 years so
it wasn't a change in wheels, and the car is a sporty type.  It just
seems that they have a bit more laid-back attitude toward us as we
approach 25 or so than when we're closer to the teens.  I had never
gotten a warning before this year, it had always been tickets if I
were stopped, and I've gotten warnings for the same speeds that I'd
previously been ticketed.

Turbos:

The car I'd had for nearly 9 years is turbocharged...1980 Mercury
Capri (unfortunately I'm only a Porschephile...haven't made the big
financial leap yet.)  I always ran more gently before shutdown, and
let it idle for a while before switching it off unless I happened to
be in a desperate hurry.  It paid off, there are VERY few cars left
with that 2.3 turbo engine, mine has always given good service in
return for good care.

The coolant circulation after shutdown is a VERY good thing for the
turbo, but it doesn't address one of the major issues.  If you're
driving hard, the turbocharger is spinning at VERY VERY high rates,
and when you switch off the engine the oil pressure drops to zero
quickly.  Add these two conditions and you can just FEEL the money
being sucked from your account for a new turbo bearing, and even if
you're capable of doing the work yourself the parts bill will choke
several horses.

Clutches:

Slipping the clutch for higher RPM is bad form, unless you have the
bucks for the clutch replacement.  Stick to getting your jollies
after you get off the line, it's a road racer not a drag racer.

Enjoy your car, and rest assured that I (along with many others who
have more taste and enthusiasm than cash) am terribly envious!

Steve -

Congrats on the purchase of the 951!  You even know its correct model number,
which clearly places you among the cognoscenti.  I'll try to ante up my two bits
worth on the several questions you asked.

Regarding cool-down, this is always a good thing with any car, and an especially
good thing with any turbo-charged car.  Take it easy on the off-ramp and into
the parking lot, listen to the end of the song, and let it idle a bit.

Regarding oil, I will give you such wisdom as I have received from several years
attendance at PCA Zone 1 Tech Tactics, and from my readings.  As far as brands
go, oil is oil.  Stick with a name-brand, like Castrol, Pennzoil, Quaker State,
etc.  Stay away from K-Mart brand, and for that matter, any brand whose name
sounds like that of a medieval Carpathian war lord.  Years ago, oil was indeed a
subject which deserved and received a lot of consideration.  The current
generation of multi-weight oils obviate all that.  By the way, do use a
multi-weight oil.  Depending on where you live, either a 10W40 (my winter
choice) or a 20W50.  I happen to use Castrol because the local Anne & Hope has
sales on it often enough.

There is no absolute need to use a synthetic oil in non-CIS turbo Porsches.  The
CIS cars are the 924 turbo (931) and the 911 turbo (930), and they apparently do
benefit from the extra overhead a synthetic gives.  (For that matter, it occurs
to me that synthetics might help a 911 which tends to run hot.)  There are a lot
of weird claims made about synthetics, like shear strength and so forth.  I'm
not someone who can evaluate them, though.  I have a friend who owns an '86 951
and has started using Mobil 1.  He sleeps better, but I don't think anything
else has changed.

Regarding low-end performance, you can do one of several things.  You can get a
944S (like me).  Or you can buy a 911 Carrera, dang torquey things.  Or you
might try the Autothority chips, which improve low-end performance as well as hp
and torque.  The current version for the 951, version 2.5, seems to work very
well.  Earlier versions, notably version 2.2, caused a number of head gasket
failures.  (Or, as Autothority would have it, merely exacerbated problems with
Porsche's head gasket technology.  To which end Autothority says they're working
on an improved head gasket for our cars!)  Avoid any kit or design which
includes drilling your car's recycling valve or shimming its waste gate.  These
techniques, as well as some chip designs, ran roughshod over your DME's built-in
safety features, like overboost protection.

Don't waste you money on anyone's throttle cam.  Doesn't do a damn thing you
can't do with your foot, and you already have feet.

Finally, onto the subject of red cars.  In these days of instant-on radar, the
best thing a "professional speeder" can do is avoid being obvious about it. 
This involves several road-tested techniques of your truly's.  A red car jerking
in and out the left lane, flashing his/her headlamps, driving 10-30 MPH faster
than everyone else, and blaring Heino tapes is pure bear food.  You stick out
like a sore thumb and you will be rewarded for it.  What can you do?  My
suggestion is to be smooth, be polite, and use as much cover in the right lanes
as possible.  Not looking like Charles Manson might help once you're stopped;
but if the officer has you dead to rights at over a buck, then any nepotistic
consideration due is the DA's problem, not his.

Anecdote:  I drove from the Boston area to Watkins Glen last summer on my annual
pilgrimage to that fine track.  I drive an ocean blue met car, didn't spend much
time under 80 and did spend a bit of it above 100 through NY.  No prob.  Two
friends who travelled the same route at about the same time, one red 951 and one
red 911 Carrera, never saw much above 80 but saw plenty of constabulary action. 
I made the mistake of travelling with them back from the Glen through NY, down
to Lime Rock for an additional two days of pure heaven.  Boy, did they find
cops!  Your mileage may vary, but I'll never buy a red car.

I saw some discussion of these in a previous note on 951s.  A few
comments:

They make the 951 run quite rich.

They have phenomenal low end kick.

They make a early 951 pretty much equal to the 951S top end, and a bit
better low end, WITHOUT the boost mod (ask bart), which, having lunched
a motor at the track, I feel isa the way to go.

My recommendation would be to run them with boost on the street, w/o if
you go to the track.  The boost mod is a 30 sec. operation (one bolt),
but I would pump down the boost to .9 bar peak by drilling out the boost
bolt to 7/32" (or better yet. it's metric equivalent).

Anyone on the net interested in their products would be wise to let me
know, I am a distributor and give a discount to PCA members. (sssshhhh,
not officially)

They have a 30 day "money back" guarantee, but expect to have your $
tied up for a few MONTHS and many phone calls.

Steve Timmins mentioned a previous discussion of AutoThority chips for 951s.
Did anyone happen to save any of those notes?  Is "951" another designation
for a 944T (excuse my ignorance!)?  I wasn't on the porschephile mailing list
when that discussion first made the rounds and I'd be very interested in any
information on this subject.  I have an '88 944T and I've been considering
getting their chip (and possibly the boost mod), but am wondering if there
are any side-effects/disadvantages to using their products.

On an unrelated note, I was wondering if anyone could help me with a problem
I occasionally see with my 944T.  It occurs when I first start the car after
it's been sitting for awhile (it seems to be worse when it's hot & humid out).
Immediately after I've started the car, it idles pretty roughly and sometimes
the engine even dies.  After the engine has been running for a bit, things
seem to be fine.  However, the manual says to not idle the engine, but to
instead drive off slowly.  Well, when the car's in this condition, the engine
will cut in and out if I drive off right away.  Anyone have any idea what this
problem is?  Should I let the car idle for a bit despite what the manual says?
This problem doesn't happen very often, but I'd like to figure out what it is.
I use Mobil premium unleaded gas, if that matters any.  I'd appreciate any
ideas or suggestions.  Thanks in advance,

Subject:      Rough idle
To: PORSCHEPHILES@bcm.tmc.edu

It's not at all uncommon for fuel-injected engines to have a rough idle
on hot-starts in warm weather.  For fuel-injected aircraft engines there
is even a different starting procedure for hot-starts.

Among the reasons is that the fuel runners heat up when the hot engine
is just sitting, and this causes some of the fuel to vaporize.  Bubbles
in the fuel don't behave like the liquid fuel, and the engine doesn't
get the steady smooth flow of fuel it needs.  My Golf GT exhibits a mild
form of this problem, but not enough to hamper driveability.  Is it
possible that there is some system intended to counter the problem that
isn't working on Robert's 944T?

Subject: Idle

My car is now having this problem.  I am pretty sure it is the idle
valve, tht octopus of a valve below number two intake runner, which the
large hoses from the manifold go to.  It's function is to let in
additional air, other than what goes by the bleeder screw and throttle
plate to maintain idle at 850 RPM, more or less independant of load (ie
with the A/C on.)

There is one way to check it....uncrew and tighten the air valve one
turn in either direction with the car idling (to make sure you know
where you started).  The idle should peal (unscrew) or slow (screw) and
then return to it's original level.  If it does not....it is something i
n the idle circut.

The air screw is the brass screw which goes down into the throttle
plate, at the inlet to the intake manifold.

Good Luck...ps, it could be in the wiring, but is more likely the valve.

My '89 951 has the same problem since 10,000K.  The first cold start generally
stalls within 2 seconds, and the second try will not die, but is very
rough.  I don't have any problem with warm starts.  The car is driven on
weekends only, and it sits in the garage thru the week.  Is there this a
common problem with 951's?

Nevertheless, the cold start problem is there.  Someone mentioned fixing
leaking air hose for this problem.  Is this something that we can check 
by ourself?

Subject: Robert Yen's rough starts

Robert writes that his 944T runs rough right after he starts it.  I am sending
this to the mailing list instead of just Robert because some one out there
might know about this.

I had the same problem with my 81 911 SC.  It's a fun car but that is a
different story.  It started acting up by having a very rough idle right
after it was started when the engine was cold.  After warming up for about
30 seconds it would then run smooth again.  I took it to my mechanic and
he found that (this is where my recollection of the details gets sketchy and I
need someone elses help) a sensor (the cold start sensor?) needed to be reset
or adjusted.  Once the sensor was adjusted the engine didn't idle rough any
more.  I hope this helps.

I also have an '81 SC, and had similar problems. I had the auxilliary 
air valve replace last tune-up, and the problem went away.  It's also 
worth noting that the CIS systems are very sensitive to air leaks. I had
to have the whole thing pulled and wound up replacing most of the rubber
parts to cure the air leak problem.

FYI, the "runs like shit cold, gets better when warm" is usually indicative
of the aux air valve or another source of an air leak if it's not a fuel 
pump pressure problem or a cold start valve or a....

Subject: Two Cents on Idling...


forgive me three for being a little innocent of the relationship between
the 944 and the 951 and the 944T.  But since I'm in the ballpark, I
might as well take a *swing*...

My '84 944 idles roughly under the same conditions...  hot weather, cold starts.
I don't know about you but I'd rather not watch my 944 die idling and I too
know that you should drive right away at under 3k rpm until the temperature
gauge is out of the cold zone (the first block on the gauge).  So, I just
give it a little gas to keep the rpms up and I'm off.  For a while the
car shakes drastically especially with the air conditioner on but then 

eventually it smoothes down a lot.

Of course, the older 944s had a stupid problem with their motor mounts
so my shaking is probably worse than the 951s even though I've already
replaced the mounts once...  


Keith Watson just mentioned the possiblilty of a sensor needing adjustment.
This could be the Oxygen sensor on the exhaust pipe.  Now that he mentions
it, I do remember having it replaced for the 60,000 mile tune...  My idle
got worse at that point...  Hmmm.  Of course, my mechanic assured me that
the Ford Oxygen sensor would work just as well as the Porsche one at
a cheaper price...  Silly thing is that the price in Performance Products
was better than both...  Perhaps with the newer models, the O2 sensor
can be adjusted.  As for my idle...  We'll see what they say after they
extract the racoon ;-).

I must strongly disaggree with the statement oil is oil!
I have ruined a 911 engine by using Castrol GTX oil.
That engine was a 78 SC engine. I had adjusted the valves and found
the camshafts to be in perfect condition when I bought the car.
15,000 miles later, after having used Castrol GTX for all the oil changes 
in-between (3 or 4 oil changes in-between), I readjusted the valves
and found very severe cam wear - mostly pitting wear on the "tips"
of the lobes. I blew air through the cam spray tube and found that none
of the squirting holes was plugged. I therefore concluded it was the oil.
At the last tech tactic I spoke to Bruce Anderson about it, who
said others have seen the same cam wear problem, and funnily, they
were using Castrol GTX as well - quite possibly the oil!!!!!
I then changed to Quaker State. What a disaster!!!! How can Porsche
work with a company like that???? That stuff is awfull, awfull, awfull!!!
It foams like hell!! You open your filler cap with a running engine
on colder days, and you can see the foam just coming out!!! After only 
five hundred miles on the oil it foams like hell. When I then took my
valve covers off, I found all kinds of gum and deposits from the Quaker
State! (I used 10-40 in Winter and 20-50 in summer).
Others I talked to again had found the same for Quaker state.
I then asked Martin Steger from the German Auto Haus in Burnt Hills,
(reputable service place for Porsche and Ferrari - Martin is ex factory
mechanic) what he recommends. He said Valvoline Turbo would solve all
these problems, costs a bit more (about $1.80/quart), but it has
good lubricating and cleaning agents and he has taken engines apart
after many miles that had been driven with valvoline turbo, and there
was minimal wear and no gumup or deposits at all.
I have been using it since in my 911 (for the past 30,000 miles) and
am happy with it. The engine stays clean, the oil doesn't foam,
and I haven't seen any wear symptoms like I did with the Castrol.
I use 15W40 in winter, 20W50 in summer. And it must be Valvoline Turbo
oil, NOT Valvoline Racing Formula, which is far inferior to the turbo oil.

I was surprised when Frank Hens said that Castrol GTX ate his cam lobes
in something like 10,000 miles......I've always used it with no trouble
at all, and it's recommended by most good mechanics. 

Quaker state, as I understand it, is wierd stuff.....

But for the record, I use Kendall 20/50 in my 356. That's apparently 
the trick-hot setup these days. 

I understand from some of my racing cronies that synthetic oil is 
almost universally better than natural oils. 

I think the whole discussion has as much religion as science in it, 
though.....Not to doubt Frank's sincerity or his automotive knowledge,
but I'd seriously wonder if just the oil could cause pitting of a 
cam lobe, and I didn't even know you could detect pitting by checking
valve motion! 

Oh wait, 911's are probably overhead cam, right? (I'm used to 
god-fearing upstanding fine old pushrod motors, you see....) 
Can you explain the whole process in more detail? (the process
by which you determined that the cam was pitted and how the 
oil caused it...)

My '89 951 (12K miles) used to drink oil like water, even though we always
added Valvoline 20W50 (no other specs).  The red light came up like < 1000 miles
after the oil change/or addition.  Both mechanics at two major Porsche dealer
assured us this is common to all Porsches, and all we need to do is add oil
every 600 miles.  However, ever since we switched to Valvoline Turbo in the 
last oil change(its fourth oil change), it's been > 1500 miles, and at least
the light hasn't come up yet. 

Umm!  Come to think of it, I'd better check it again, the oil level sensor
may be broken.

Subject: 951 advice?


My mechanic, Tom Amon of T and D Porsche, recommends the
Valvoline Turbo Oil as well. I just had this conversation with
Tom. He had a 930 motor burn-up using Mobil One which is supposed
to be a top quality synthetic oil. He has had terrific results
with the Valvoline. (If Al Jr wasn't their driver it would be
great but that's another story.)

What is interesting is that I had a conversation with the
owner of Hilton Hyperlube recently in which he mentioned that most
of the oil formulations for the various oil companies is done by
a company in Los Angeles. In general most of the oils are same.
However you hear horror stories about various oils like Castrol,
and Penzoil. The mechanic that works on my Mercedes mentioned
that when he pulls a head off a car he can instantly tell if they
have been using Penzoil by the sludge build-up. Now he recommends
using Castrol which he has had great luck with also. I will have
to tell him about the problems Frank mentions.

	For general guidance (you can come here for *lots* of
specific Q&A) I'd suggest that you consult Dean Batchelor's
"Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide" (ISBN 0-87938-159-0).
It provides descriptions, specs, performance, etc. of all 
of the models in a handy package, as well as specific 
buying tips for each model.  I bought a copy to assist 
my Porsche hunt in Germany, when I worked in Munich for 
a couple of years.  

	As an aside, I didn't return with a gray market car 
- too much hassle and risk - but recommend that one consider 
the purchase of a 5-year old model, if you'd be happy with an 
older model, and have the chance to shop there (with the dollar
strong).  If you purchase a 5-year or older model, you don't 
have to convert the car to EPA specs (this is a one car 
per-person per-lifetime exemption).

Let me second Franks Castrol/QUaker State/Valvoline observations.
Here's something I noticed about Castrol GTX vs Valvoline Turbo: VT
"clings" to polished surfaces far better than Castrol.  You can test
this simply yourself, the difference is noticeable to both sight and
touch.  The VT with the same visc rating seems to leave a thicker
film.  This translates almost directly to better wear protection,
since a lot that gets oil is not immersed in it.  Of course, GTX is
almost half the price of VT, so Castrol may in fact make a better oil,
I've just never seen it.  The cheaper valvoline oils are about as good
as GTX. 

> Quaker state, as I understand it, is wierd stuff.....

It surely is.

Never tried it.

I've heard both good and bad.  The major thing I've heard, and Bruce
Anderson was one of those I heard it from, is this:  Change your oil
every 3000 miles and MOBIL 1 wont make a difference.

No religion here, these are just our observations.  I thumbs down QS
and GTX, and thumbs up VT.  ANything else no comment, because I
haven't tried it, why risk it when I found something that works?  In a
911, when you remove the valve covers the cam shafts are staring you
right in the face, so you visually inspect it for pitting or other
damage.  Plus you usually feel it with your fingers to insure it's
in the correct position when you're adjusting the valves (at least
those of us who like to caress our camshafts...).

The damage to Frank's camshafts was that, among other things, two of
the lobes had been worn down significantly.  The relation to oil, in
fact to the adhesive power of the oil, should be obvious.  If the oil
isn't coating the cam, the metal wears from contact with the rocker
arm.  The most obvious cause of a problem like this would be if the
hole from which the oil squirts onto the cam lobe was clogged, which
is why Frank said he checked that and they weren't.  Therefore it must
have been the oil.  The fact that the wear stopped after switching oil
would be another sign.

    So what's the scoop on Mobil 1

Mobil synthetic products have come in for a lot of critism;
apparently, while they're heavily promoted, they're not
actually very representative of good synthetic products.
in particular, a race mechanic or two have told me that
the Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube is clearly inferior to
the synthetic gear lubes from AGIP, Amsoil, and Redline.
evidently the same may be true of the motor oil product.

i, like one other reader of this list, am running Valvoline
Turbo in my Alfa (sorry, don't have a Porsche yet), again
at the advice of Martin Steger, and have been very satisfied.
but then, i've been running Castrol GTX in my Saabs, and
have noticed no problems with the cams in the OHC engine.

...but on the other hand, the Quaker State Porsche CART team was using
Mobil 1 motor oil (not gear lube) initially, until QS could produce
an oil that'd stand up to the punishment of CART racing.

I use Mobil 1; I don't know whether it makes my engine run better than 
a GOOD conventional oil (surely it will be no worse), but the extra cost
is not large and I sleep better at nights.  :)  Previously I used CAM-2
(not available in the US?) with no ill effects.

This, of course, is in a VW; Porsches have to wait until my salary/mortgage
ratio increases a little bit.  :)

Cough, choke, ahem.  Mobil 1 is a synthetic oil that tries to be
competitively priced with natural (is this the right term?) oils.

Redline is a good quality synthetic.  Not a top quality, but a good
quality.  I've had good results with it.  It doesn't tend to get as
gritty (for lack of a better term) as normal oils, and tends to look
about as thick coming out as it did coming in.

  I seem to recall that one disadvantage of using synthetics with air 
cooled engines it that they don't allow the heat to be disapated as well as 
the non-synthetics.  So in other words you get the wear protection, but the 
engine runs hotter.  I don't use synthetics, can anyone who is air-cooled 
 and using synthetics confirm this?

	YES.  You *always* have to have the car converted to DOT.
Lessee, that included:

	* reinforced doors
	* US-position bumpers (minimally, Germany has bumpers at a

	* different fuel tank (no-spill in rollover?)

	* restraints (DOT-approved belts OR passive" belts XOR air bag)

Hmmmm .. I think that's it.  Depending on the existing equipment,
it could be not too costly (just door reinforcement, and bumpers >= $500) 
or very expensive (PLUS new glass, tires = $$$).

My point, though poorly stated, was that all porsches have oil pressure

the oil light comes on (The exclamation point and the red "low oil"

My oil light comes up whenever the oil level is just below the ideal range.
Even with that light on the oil pressure is usually normal according to the

Porsche added an oil level sensor to the 944's starting with model year '87.  I 
believe it was added during the course of the year.  It has confused mechanics,
because it causes the light to come on when oil is down about half way on the
dip stick.  The mechanics didn't know about the change and assumed that, because
the oil is pretty much there, the pressure sender must be bad.

Regarding Patty's question, the oil pressure should read about 4 when the engine
is rev'ed, but may drop as low as 2 when idling and warmed up.  When the car is
cold, the oil pressure will read as much as five even when idling, and will drop
as things warm up.  I believe the oil pressure may be permitted to drop to as
low as 1 (bar) without endangering the engine, but I'm unsure of this figure.

Message-Id: <52900822183525/0004056890NB4EM@mcimail.com>

And I thought heated arguments about oil were a thing of the past...

There is a wealth of contradictory opinions to be mined.  One opinion expressed
was that Pennzoil sludged, and Castrol doesn't.  Well, I have a mechanic here
(Lenny Cummings at Autosport) who claims just the opposite!  If some brand of
oil caused pitting, I'd like to know why.  Pitting and corrosion will occur if
oil is left in a driven car longer than three months.  The reason?  As oil
breaks down, it becomes mildly acidic.  Leave that acid in your engine, and
things happen.  Put fresh oil in, and pitting will stop.  Pitting and foaming
will also occur in oil which has been contaminated, particularly by water
(condensation or coolant).

Pitting does not sound symptomatic of inadequate lubrication; correct me if I'm
wrong.

You cannot divine subtle differences in a lubrication product via tests
performed under grossly different conditions.  Forming an opinion about the
qualities of an oil by eyeballing its adhesive properties on metal doesn't make
sense.  Unless you've got your head inside an engine case that's up to
temperature and is spinning at a couple thousand RPM.  Otherwise, it's about as
silly as the Mobil 1 add burning oil in a frypan.

I think race teams chose motor oil the same way 4 out of 5 leading hospitals
chose analgesics: price and sponsorship.  Anyway, who cares what they chose?  A
race engine gets torn down and rebuilt every 30 to 60 hours, if it lasts that
long.  I can't do that, and I therefore maintain my car by a different set of
rules.

Ok so, suppose I want to switch motor oils...  I was told that once I use

change?  Can I switch then?  I mean, is it ok to just go from synthetic to

	Let's not go overboard: I don't think that the exclamation mark
means engine damage in *all* cars, Steve, as my '87 944S lights it up
whenever it is just slightly low.  And others (see below - Violet Ken 
and her '86 944T?) have seen the same behaviour.

	I think that the indicator on our 944s is a *warning* of low oil,
not a damage indicator.  I discussed this with the Service Manager at 
my dealership, and he assured me that the indicator was a bit touchy, 
but on the safe side.  Apparently they've had problems with people 
waiting until the idiot light came on, and the oil was *really* low,
and they'd done real damage.  As a result, they've changed the sensor
to go off early - earlier than you 911 sensor, it seems.

	And it seems like my <Low Oil> warning goes off frequently:
my '87 944S drinks a quart every 500-750 miles.  And it goes off 
when the oil is only about 1/2 quart low, which is when I top it off.
So, I've begun the (poor) practice of using the indicator as a 
reminder to add oil.

	Do other 944s have such high oil consumption?
I had a 2-valve 944 that was very frugal with oil,
whereas my 4-valve 944S consumes a quart about every 600 miles.
I've even noticed blue smoke on upshifts, when driving the car cold.

Concerning gray market importation of motor vehicles, I believe that the DOT
and the EPA disallowed this a couple of years ago.  It is no longer legal to
import a car under any circumstances and not meet EPA and DOT regs within 30
days of customs.  After that you get a notice that the vehicle must be
exported or destroyed.  This holds for motorcycles as well.

Porsche complied with this by simply modifying the ride height of their cars.
this is easily modified on 911s by adjusting the torsion bars.  A lot of
Porsche rags have covered this in the past.

You forgot the flamability tests for interior trim.  Also turnsignal color and
all light bulbs being DOT approved (headlights, signals, running lights, etc).
not to mention the proof the DOT _requires_ that these mods were made.
Usually the modification shop is required to have engineering data (usually a
crash test and/or other destructive test to show the mods comply) on file
certifying the modifications for that particular make and model.
 
>Hmmmm .. I think that's it.  Depending on the existing equipment,

I once looked into getting a Yamaha motorcycle imported legally from Canada.
The cost was on the order of $US 10,000 for the RZ 500.  To meet the EPA
requirements it was necessary to convert to propane.  Keep in mind bikes are
not subject to the same rigid standards of emissions that cars are.  Most of
the cost went into the flamability testing required for the seat.  It wasn't
good enough to swap the seat with another, it had to be _retested_.  that
alone was about $US 3000 for the lab.  Needless to say I never went through
with it.  But everytime I see one go by (probably not legally imported) I
still think about it.
 
BTW, the 5 year rule used to apply for bikes and EPA certification as well.
Ducati 900SS motorcycles fit the age requirement, but again there were the DOT
requirements.  Same story.
 
A last note.  Most of the Europeans will deliver a US spec car to you in
Europe, though usually at a cost.  I know Mercedes had a deal some years ago
where you could save enough on the car to make the trip over and back plus
shipping for the car from there back to the US.  I think Porsche had a similar
program.
 
Just another opinion...

The spec on 944 oil consumption is 1.5 litres / 1000 km., which is a lot in my
opinion.  I too have a 944S, and it is very frugal with its oil.  I have very
rarely had to add oil between 3000 mi changes, generally only to top it off a
wee bit before heading for the track.  (Pre-production 944S' had problems with
oil starvation of the #2 connecting rod bearing, due to overly aggressive
lubrication of the upper parts of the engine.  Some paranoias die hard...)

You see blue smoke when pushing your cold car hard.  Well, consider letting it
warm up first; all cars need to warm up.  There are different metals in the
engine with different coefficients of thermal expansion.  For example 911's have
a copper (I think) gasket at the base of each cylinder where it mates with the
block.  I was recently shown the result of one car's owner's routine pushing of
the car when cold: one or more of the gaskets had failed, and his engine was in
pieces.  Your blue smoke may be oil which has seeped around the cold piston
rings, being burnt with fuel.

Hope this helps.  Let me know whether taking it easy when the car is cold
improves your oil consumption.

Subject: re: Rough Idle
Message-Id: <43900823021834/0004056890NB3EM@mcimail.com>

There are, unfortunately, an annoyingly large number of things which can lead to
rough idle in a cold engine.  Some are easy to identify, some are a real pain. 
Herewith a list of as many as come quickly to mind.

1. Leaks in the air intake, vacuum leaks.  I saw a 944S recently in which the
rubber sleeve between the back of the air filter and the throttle body had
fallen off (or been left off when the filter was changed).  Check the length of
the air intake pipe for damage or whatnot; check the clamps.  Check the breather
hose as well.  Check the air filter - has it been replaced recently?

2. An air flow sensor which is clogged or not wired up soundly.  It is a bitch
to get to on my 944S; perhaps not so bad on other 944's.  Or a failed/miswired
engine temperature sensor.

3. Fuel system woes, most often inadequate fuel reaching the engine.  This can
be due to a marginal fuel pump, clogged fuel filter, or clogged injectors. 
Electrical problems can also strike here.  Leaking injector seals are often
overlooked.

4. Spark plugs and wires, and the distributor: worn, incorrectly gapped, or
marginal wiring.  There was a tech bulletin last year on the 944S, describing
misfire which can be caused by arcing from the wires to the hood.  There's a
sheet of insulation available to fix this, although I would probably opt for
some flower-patterned contact paper from the K-Mart myself.

Finally, a rough idle can, as someone else has mentioned, be due to a failed
motor mount.  There are two, but the exhaust side has the one which fails.  The
mounts are hydraulic, ie, filled with a fluid.  When they fail, the fluid seeps
out and the mount collapses.  Porsche has gone through six versions of the
exhaust-side mount.  The latest version (.05) has no paint markings and deletes
a couple of 4 mm shim washers.  (Earlier versions were marked with different
colours of paint: grey, green, and most recently, orange.)

The mount is easy to get to, but a bit hard to meaure accurately.  There was a
tech bulletin last year which gave a template for a simple measuring tool which
can be constructed by bending and grinding a small length of flat stock.

Happy hunting!

Yes, you can simply change to (or from) a synthetic with a regular oil change. 
I would not mix synthetic and mineral oils, ie, topping off with the other kind.
And, if you can still find them, mixing a non-detergent with a detergent oil is
definitely taboo (for reasons I forget).  (Non-detergent is the old, obsolete
technology.)

Working at SCO has been somewhat interesting and mildly rewarding.
Sad to say, though, not really enough of either.

As of August 30th, any mail intended for me should stop going to
banta@sco.com and start going to banta@eng.sun.com.  I won't be
starting at Sun until September 10th, so figure that any mail sent
to me between the 30th and the 10th won't get replied to
immediately.

If this is sufficient notice for the list administrators to add
my new address, please let me know.  If I don't hear from you by
the middle of next week, I'll send in a formal request.

Enjoy

Message-Id: <61900824021116/0004056890NB1EM@mcimail.com>

First off, the real poop on the presence of the oil level warning system is
contained in tech bulletin group 1, number 8706, dated 18 March 87.  Really
weird, they added it in stages.  To wit:

"During the 1987 model year production, components for the oil level warning
system were installed in stages.  Therefore, it is possible, depending on the
date of production, that a given 924S, 944, 944S, or 944 Turbo may have an oil
level sender and related wiring but not have the combination instrument with
warning lamp installed.

"Introduction stages were as follows:

1. Related wiring installed.
2. Oil level sender added to oil sump.
3. Combination instrument with warning lamp added.

"Oil level warning system completely installed as of VIN:

924S      - 92 HN 454504
944       - 94 HN 473616
944 Auto  - 94 HN 474396
944S      - 94 HN 452679
944 Turbo - 95 HN 151471

"Do not attempt repairs on the oil level warning system on cars produced before
the above VINs.  On cars partially equipped with the oil level warning system,
installation of components needed to complete the system is considered _not_ a
warranty matter."

However, my 944S has a lower-numbered VIN yet has the whole shootin' match.  In
fact, the 944S' had a whole bunch of stuff slipped into production during the
year, like the DME which accepts a diagnostic read-out tool (no. 9268).  The
tech bulletins list all these things, and it was entertaining to go through them
to see what I did and did not get!

I have to confess that I did not know where the sender was.  Apparently it's off
the sump, and the wiring diagram indicates a single white/yellow wire running
from it to the DME plug (pg. 97-111, map ref. E-44).  I believe that mine has in
fact a yellow wire.  I cannot find any diagram showing the part itself; the
particular workshop manual pages haven't been updated since '83.

I have no idea how it works.  Hope this helps.  If not, I can poke around under
my car this weekend.

   Cough, choke, ahem.  Mobil 1 is a synthetic oil that tries to
   be competitively priced with natural (is this the right term?)
   oils.

   andy banta@sco.com

>From my original posting Andy's comments seem to indicate that he
doesn't see Mobil 1 as selling the product as better than regular
oil or as a top quality product. In my conversation with Howard
Leendertson of Hilton Hyperlube he mentioned that when they did
their testing of the various oils with the Hyperlube oil additive
added they did not exceed the specifications of Mobil 1. The major
brands of oils without the additive were much less in the
"desirable qualities". I didn't ask him what the properties were
that were missing. Howard mentioned the name of the laboratory
that did the oil formulations and testing but I don't remember
the name. I do remember that he said this lab did the
formulations for the major brands sold. I will try to contact him
and get the information if anyone is interested. But it did seem
to me that he commented that specifications of the Mobil 1 exceeded
the major brands. But we all know about specifications....

Someone else commented about racing teams usage of oil. I called
a driver for one of the CART teams that also runs IMSA and asked
about thier oil changes. They use the oil until the rebuild. This
isn't much time in the engine. For 24 hours events they will
change the oil before the race.

Subject: 914 tranny problems

I mailed a question a week or two ago about doing a rebuild on my
transmission on a '75 914 2.0.  Most of the mail was kind of dis-
couraging about doing a full rebuild.  So now I have a couple of
other questions:

	1) Many people refered to a 901 transmission.  Is this the
	technical designation for the transmission I have?

	2) I think I have narrowed the problem down to a bad first
	gear synchro.  The problems I have include popping out of
	first if I accelerate too quickly, and I can't put it in first
	without grinding no matter how slow I'm going.  It'll only
	go into first at a complete stop.  So does my diagnosis sound
	correct?  And how difficult is it to replace just the synchro?
	And where can I get these parts in Santa Cruz or the greater
	Bay Area?

Finally, does anyone have the address/phone # of the PCA branch in the
Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay area?  I've seen some stuff about events, but
I haven't been able to get in touch.

>The problems I have include popping out of first if I accelerate too quickly

That actually sounds like worn/broken motor mounts! Be sure to check
them, and if you're taking the engine+tranny out anyway, replace them
if worn.

>I can't put it in first without grinding no matter how slow I'm going

That does sound like a synchro, but on 914's can also be a mis-adjusted
clutch. My 914 has this annoying problem of the clutch adjustment "slipping"
and needing to be re-done every two weeks or so if I'm driving it much.
The first symptom: hard shifting into 2nd, and grinding on shifts into 1st.

>where can I get these parts in Santa Cruz...

I'd wander up to Santa Clara and drop in on Automotion. I usually do when
I'm in the Bay Area anyway.

easy to delete e-mail and so hard to grow trees.  I'm sorry that people

My 911SC has shifting problems where: starting out in reverse can cause the
car to shake until the clutch is all the way out, it is very difficult to
consistently start out smoothly in 1st gear, shifting into 2nd gear is always
stiff, and shifting into 3rd is very light and if done too fast will always
grind.

My mechanic said that the 2nd and 3rd gear problems are from a stiff 2nd gear
synchro and a bad 3rd gear synchro.  I have not asked him about the car shaking
in reverse and sometimes in 1st.  Could a lot of my problems be from the
clutch?  (I dont know much about how cars work)

Subject: How to extract mailer's EMail?

	I wondered if anyone has a solution to the following problem:

PROBLEM: I find it bothersome to have *lots* of EMail come in from
a mailer, which gets mixed in with urgent, work-related Email 
(in my mail box).  I need a way to quickly discriminate company mail 
from mailer discussions.

	As a technocrat, I first thought of a technical solution:
create a filter to automatically sort thru my incoming EMail, so that 
it redirects all incoming EMail from a mailer to an appropriate 
folder/directory, for future perusal.  E.g., my machine would run 
a process that extracts all incoming messages from the mailer, "autox" 
(identified as originating from the known address, "autox@hoosier.utah.edu"),
and places them into a separate file/folder for incoming autox mail.

	This solution would provide me with separate EMail folders
where I now have one (a slight disadvantage in overhead), but with
the benefit of relieving me of the task of manually sorting thru 
the mail (and organizing the mail into piles for each separate 
subject area).

	Any better ideas???  Let's share our "best practices."
(There are probably also some useful procedural suggestions that 
each of us employs, but I can't think of one at the moment).

	I have toyed with the idea of creating such a program
in "C" or UNIX shell script, since I receive my EMail via a 
UNIX mainframe, with a UNIX- and MS-DOS-capable PC.  I am sure 
that we use a variety of machines in our net (ain't it wonderful
that they can *communicate*), but there should be some level
of commonality to this solution that we could share.  At a minimum,
if someone has developed such a tool, I could save some work by 
reusing their design (e.g., sharing the pseudocode).

	hmmm, this ought to be interesting!

I use a set of tools that are based around mh. Standard with mh is
something called slocal; using this as a prefilter, you can direct mail
into several inboxes based on header fields. I break all my car-related
mail out this way, for example.

That's a good start, but my mail reader (dxmail, but xmh has most of
the same features) is also smart. I can tell it that certain folders
have their own inboxes. It checks those files and tells me (visually)
when I have mail there, and lets me easily incorporate the mail from
the special inbox into the folder.

I probably get 300 mail messages a day. I couldn't survive without
tools like this (I don't just use it for car mail !-)

According to AutoWeek, PCNA as announced a new program designed to
move 1990 944S2's and 951s by offering attractive lease programs.
I forget the bottom line on the 951, but you can now pick up 944S2
leases for $499 a month.

Plus the $1600/year insurance.... 8{)

I'm paying.....  $700/year for decent liability and good comp/coll $200/$500.  I'm 25.

	I have some good news to pass along on that front:
State Farm has unusually LOW RATES FOR insuring PORSCHES.
My rate is about $800/year, for a '87 944S in the Chicago area.
If you're in the area, my agent (who passed on this good news 
to Porsche owners some time ago) would be happy to give you
a quote:  Manny Hoffman (Agency) at (708) 798-6479.

	This has saved me hundreds of dollars (I haven't found 
anything close), and the service there has been terrific 
(e.g., they went out of their way to explain that they'd 
reimburse me for a break-in under comprehensive coverage, 
with no effect on my rates).

	check it out!

951's aren't available in the U.S. any more.  I believe Autofreak said the <<S2
Cabriolet>> was $599/month.  The coupe was $499.  Of course, there are an
infinite variety of leases in the world, and you can't tell from the news blip
what your equity and buy-out will be after 3-5 years.  If you're gonna pay big
bucks, you should get something for it in the long run!

Robert: thanks for the tip on State Farm rates.  Many people will be very glad
for the information!  Here in MA, rates are set by law such that we pay very
high rates and the insurance companies still have a net loss on auto policies. 
Good system, huh?  We have the highest claim rate in the country (for comp &
collision, I believe)!

Anyone notice the Carrera 2/4 chase car in the Spa F1 race?  Looks like the 928
is history.

	Good point.  Sorta like ads with "only $199 a month!" and no mention
of other important facts like, say, how *many* months.  ;-)

	This does not make sense: How could auto insurance agencies afford 
to stay in business??  Why wouldn't they leave if they suffer a "net loss"?
Reminds me that some agencies wanted to leave CA after their referendum to
(quasi-legally) freeze rates, but I don't know what happened - was it a
threat, or real.  Seems that the public can't legally mandate that a 
company stay in business *and* not earn a profit.  (fiscal suicide).


>>  Anyone notice the Carrera 2/4 chase car in the Spa F1 race?  

	Yes!!  Brilliant red!  It'd make a great lead car for Indy,
wouldn't it?  Now that car could set a quick pace lap.  Hell, why
not pull out all of the stops and run a 959, so that the Indy cars
don't have to worry about fouling their plugs by running so slow.  :-)

They do it because the vast majority of people who insure their cars also 
insure their homes, and unless you had big losses in the earthquake, 
homeowners insurance in California is a HUGE moneymaker. My dad recently
shopped his auto insurance around, and no one was interested in his business
unless he also switched his homeowners insurance......

Plus I suspect that innovative accounting measures also contribute to the 
Insurance companies' decisions to stay in business while claiming massive
losses......

Yes, the 951 is a 944 Turbo.  And 931 == 924 Turbo, and 930 == 911 Turbo, and
965 would've == 964 twin turbo but it was cancelled.

Insurance companies in MA offer auto policies at a loss because by law, if they
want to sell *any* insurance in MA, they must offer all types.  So the auto
losses are subsidized by people who buy other forms of insurance.  If an
insurance company wants to terminate operations here, they end up paying a big
fine/buy-out to the state coffers.

Yah, a 959 would be a great Indy pace car.  Too bad they're so rare and Porsche
is having such a tough time in Indy racing.  Hey, maybe they'd sell a few
hundred 959's the next morning after the race?!

Innovative accounting doesn't even begin to cover it.  The companies are
required by law to show quarterly fiscal reports.  What they do not report is
income from the investments they make with the money that you and I give them.
Now, I am not against them making a profit from me, I am not even against
mandatory liability insurance, but I am against them stealing me blind and
screaming that they are losing money on me!  In the past 12 years I have
_never_ filed a claim against my policy.  Not one penny was paid out to anyone
from my policy.  And yet in any 3 to 4 year period you could buy my cars with
what I pay my insurance company (that is `cars', plural).  BTW, if I `finance'
it with them I get a great 21.9% interest rate, and of course that cost is not
reportable under insurance because it is the finance charge...
 
Sorry, I know this doesn't have anything to do with Porsche's, but I just
happened to have a soapbox handy...
 
Just another opinion...

The way the insurance companies survive in Mass. is by making obscene profits on
other kinds of insurance.  Mass. won't let 'em sell any insurance without
selling auto insurance.  In fact, through some finagling they've barred some
companies from altogether leaving the state.  I don't remeber exactly what it
was; perhaps someone else does.

Subject: insurance and gas

This doesn't really belong here, but...
For any Canadians out there, insurance companies are now required by law
to charge full coverage for car insurance *including* cars in storage.
I have a couple cars stored in Canada, (including my Porsche 912)
when I heard of this.  I used to have just fire and theft in the winter.
(for around .... $40 for 6 months.  hahahaha.  and < $20 for my OPEL GT )

Anyway, if you are with State Farm, they now have this deal to keep their
customers from getting too pissed off, where if you sign a form stating
you will *not* drive this car, then they still charge you full coverage,
but for a reduced rate on all the individual charges.
I don't know if this applies to other insurance companies, and I don't know
how much of a reduction it is yet (I'm in Switzerland, they're in Canada
and the money magically dissappears out of a Canadian account of mine)
but if you have a car stored in Canada, you may want to check out State Farm.

while I think of it...gas!  I think that leaded gas is now extinct in Canada.
They were going to do this a year ago and didn't, but I think they have now.
Can someone confirm this?  Sunoco was advertising that their great new
super-duper unleaded can be used in any car requiring leaded high octanes.
I don't really believe this.  Any comments or knowledge about this?
Are there any Canadians on this list with old Porsches?  what do you do now?
Use lead additives?  My 912 is a 1968 which I think wants leaded 96 octane.

Regarding the requirement for 96 octane:

Unless things have changed, the octane requirement that manufacturers
print in owners' manuals doesn't use the same rating system that is
used to determine the number printed on the side of the pump.  If my
understanding of the situation is correct, 96 should correspond roughly
to 92 or 93 pump octane, so present super-unleaded should be okay.  The
lead is another matter entirely, and it's one of those hot-debate things.

My older car was designed for leaded gas, and the rebuild on the engine
was done before the disappearence of lead was anticipated so we didn't
go to hardened valve seats...20/20 hindsight is annoying sometimes.

It's a '59 Mercedes sedan, though, so it doesn't get the same type of
driving that a Porsche does.  What happens to an engine designed for
lead that is run without it depends very much on the load placed on the
engine.  A gently driven engine shows few signs of increased wear when
run on unleaded, but one from which lots of power is demanded (one test
I've seen was on tractor engines) will show significant recession of the
valve seats.

My understanding of the gas/lead situation is identical to David Boyd's.  Your
alternatives are to modify the head (valves & seats), find leaded racing gas, or
use a lead additive ($$$).  You can probably get away with doing nothing for
awhile - depends on if you track the car of drive hard & fast, i.e., hot and
with high revs.

Interesting how Canada requires you to pay for coverage you don't need when the
car's in storage.  This is bogus!  Can you drop the auto coverage and get a
personal property insurance plan?  Maybe it'll be cheaper.

Hmm. I just saw an ad for "TK7 lead substitute and power booster". They
make outrageous claims, of course ("improves valve recession up to
429%"). I've been using Red Line lead sub in my 1967 triumph (which
wants lead and high octane and gets driven hard) just because I trust
the folks at Red Line. I haven't had the head off to see how it's doing lately.

Anyone know about TK7, or have hard facts about lead substitutes in
general? Over on the britcars list, there was a report of an article in
a British mag that says that none of them really do any good -- if you
run your engine beyond 3500 rpm on a regular basis, your valve seats
will recede. Anyone know anything to the contrary?

(Bay Area readers, I have a list of local suppliers of leaded race gas
and one supplier of leaded premium, if you're interested. Send me mail directly.)

Anybody out there ever done a rebuild on a 944 (turbo, but that shouldn't
matter) master cylinder?  I'm about to do one and would like to hear tales of
misfortune.  I've got the ATE (Teves) parts.
