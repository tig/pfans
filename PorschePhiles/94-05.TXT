No, there's no problem.  However, with drilled rotors there is always,
as far as I know, cracking.  You have to keep your eye on the cracks
and if/when they become severe enough, replace the rotors.  I don't
think there is any nicely quantifiable rule for "severe enough."

Needless to say, when you get into doing track events or racing with
non-original equipment, and especially in the brake department, you
really have to monitor the condition of same more carefully.  In my
own case, temperature paints showed me last year that I had temps of
over 1040F at the work face of my Cool Carbon pads, and at the
outside of my rotors.  This temperature is, I believe, on the edge
at which cast iron starts to degrade more rapidly.

If you don't have a Cool Brake kit on the car, now's the time.

In short, I recommend monitoring the cracks and periodically checking
your rotors for minimum depth.

Howdy Beran

I believe I know EXACTLY what your problem is.

I had the same EXACT problem when i first got my 951
and it had hapened previously.

the reason it shuts down at about 5500 rpm is excess
boost.  The DME shuts the injectors down at 2bar or so.

The problem is in the vacuum/pressure lines to
and from the 'frequency valve' and the wastegate.

In my case the 'frequency valve' had a broken tube
which I repaired with brass tubing.  

the freq valve controls the wastegate, and is located
under the intake manifold toward back of engine,.
it has three hoses attatched, one is to the wastegate.

most likely the problem that freq valve has cracked or broken
nipple.  check carefully and repair with a brass thinwall
tube.  check all hossses for quality ect... 
Check electrical funct8ion of freq valve as well

Any question call or e-mail

Jeff,

>chipping:

The RaceWare fasteners from Randy Hubbard do seem to be the right
stuff.  We seem to have cured a lift-off problem in a friend's race
car with them.  However, keep one thing in mind.  As I opined recently,
the head gasket is the weak link in the system for a reason: it is
a hell of a lot cheaper and easier to replace than the other stuff
which would break were it not for a "soft" head gasket.  If the
aftermarket chips in your car are creating unreasonable pressure in
combustion, something's gotta give.  Nathan suggested yesterday that
the Autothority chips have a detonation problem at 5400 RPM; might
be worth a little investigation.

>tires:

I've seen folks run 245x16's up front.  The only car I've seen with
275's at the back was the Heimrath 968 car running in a support race
before the Montreal GP last year.  The wrench I chatted with was
rather tight-lipped and I dunno what they did to get them to fit.

Avoid 17" rims unless you are real sure that you can get sticky rubber
to fit.  Very little performance advantage, esp. given the sidewalls
on current tires like Comp T/A R1 and A008RSII.

>exhaust:

Never heard this said about the cat.  Which article was it?

>brakes:

Live with the squeal, or invest in some backing plates for the pads.
I think you can get them from Porsche, and VCI definitely sells them.

>turbo:

I think the 951's cool-down pump works fine as is.  If you'd like to
be really nice to the whole car, just let it idle for a few minutes.
I have an oil temp sender, and I let my car idle until the oil temp
drops to 210F.

>cooling:

The factory did change the radiator fan switch in production in Feb '88,
if memory serves.  Unless your car is overheating in traffic, there is
no reason to change the fan switch.  Remember that when you're moving,
the fans do zip to cool the car.  In fact, they really just get in the
way.  At the same time, you want to avoid overcooling the car, which
could happen in street driving with a fan switch which came on too
soon.  Oil temp is ideal in the 180-210F range.

Howdy 

It should not be necessary to take manual control of the turbo
water pump as it thermostatically controlled, as well as running
for a few seconds at shutdown.  The thermostat sendor and wire
are just to the left of the throttle positon sensor.  
If you remove the wire to the sendor and touch it to ground the
pump should come on for about 15 sec. (good test occacsionally)

A better idea in hot climates is to install a manual switch
to turn the radiator fans on.  I did this in Phoenix
it came in very usefull on 120F days when stuck in trafic
jams, or just when the car runs rather hot.  Such as at 
autocrosses, or when car sits and idiles.

good luck

Jeff,

jn>  Currently we are running stock tires and rims. I would like 
jn>           to purchase another set of rims for track use, but would
jn> like 
jn>           to know if I can go to a larger tire size and what those
jn> sizes 
jn>           would be. Can I purchase 17" rims for this car? Is 245
jn> front 
jn>           and 275 rear to large for this particular make?

Stay with the 16 inch rims. They are easier to get tires for (at least at
present) for track use.  You can fit 245/45R16's all around or even 255/50s
on the rear, but your this changes your effective final gear ration, slowing
acceleration.

jn> In the recent issue of Excellence Magazine there was a article 
jn>           about exhaust systems on turbo cars and that if you track
jn> them 
jn>           its not a bad idea to replace the catalytic converter
jn> with a 
jn>           straight pipe during tracktime. The logic was that you

jn>           burning up the catalytic converter do to extremely high
jn> temps 
jn>           during track use. Any comments on this. Considering the
jn> cost 
jn>           of a new catalytic converter this sounds like good
jn> advice.

Gut your current catalyst.  It is cheaper and just as effective, unless you
get one of the Turbo Cup exhaust systems which are unmuffled and can't be
used on the street.  You have to cut the catalyst off to gut it, then mig
weld it back on.

jn> excessive break squeal, very annoying. Any ideas on how 
jn>           to quit these babies down.

You can try one of the spread on compounds on the back of the pads, but in my
experience, one lap at the track will cook the stuff enough so that it does
not work any longer.  Are you sure you have the factory silencing pieces on
your calipers? They go between the pistons and the pads. Look at the parts
microfiche at a dealer to see what the parts look like.

jn> One of the nice features about this car is it has a kind of turbo 
jn>           cooling system that comes on when the car is shutdown
jn> hot. I 
jn>           was wondering if there is any kits out there to gain
jn> control of 
jn>           this system to force it to run longer, maybe a override
jn> switch or 
jn>           timer.

You don't need anything else.  When the car is shut off, the coolant pum runs
for 20-25 secs., then is thermostatically controlled to cycle on and off
after that until the turbo is cooled down sufficiently.  The turbo is cooled
by  antifreeze in your cooling system.

(617) 834-3932 Voice
(617) 834-3935 Fax

Builds all types of racing and high-performance street engines, with most  
work involving 944 Turbo engines, but also including 911, 944 2-valve,  
944/968 4-valve, 944 Turbo 2 and 4-valve up to 3.0 liter displacement, as  
well as Formula Ford, S2000, FF2000, Cosworth BDA, Lotus Twincam, and  
American stock-block V8s.  Also supplies chip kits for 944 Turbos, EFI  
systems, street and race camshafts for above-mentioned engines,  
turbochargers, racing clutch conversions, big brake kits, larger  
intercoolers, Quaife differentials, 375 hp and 417 hp conversion kits for  
944 Turbos.  Has engine dynanometer for custom development or test (up to  
1000 hp).  Most recent major 944 Turbo engine project produced over 500 hp  
at 1.45 bar boost from a 2.8 liter engine (real dyno numbers, not the  
exaggerated claims you see floating around).

Jon is a good friend, and does all our engine work.  He's been involved in  
racing for over 30 years, winning something like 80 races out of 130  
starts, in everything from Formula 5000 to Showroom Stock.  He's most  
known to Porsche fans as winner of the Firestone Firehawk endurance  
championship in 1985, driving a Porsche 944.  He placed sixth in the  
worldwide Porsche Cup standings that year.

Our friendship aside, he's one of the few people involved in aftermarket  
work whose claims are backed by solid analytical knowledge (his horsepower  
numbers don't contradict any laws of thermodynamics :-) and thoroughly  
tested on an engine dyno.  If he doesn't know the answer to a question,  
he's not afraid to admit it.  I could not recommend him more highly.

His chip kits for the 951 are $300, produce 265 hp with the non-S turbo  
and 290 hp with the S turbo (real numbers!), and don't blow head gaskets.

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Well, 'tta.com' got moved OK, and will actually be more accessible in its new
home, having more-or-less direct connectivity to both the main CIX router in
San Jose and locally to Sesquinet and the NSFnet backbone... If you understand 
that, then you'll appreciate it; otherwise don't worry about it...

We had a minor flame-war that started with a mailer that hung and kept sending
messages over and over and over again to the list. So, a few points here, and
*YOU'D FLIPPIN' WELL BETTER READ THIS!!!!!*

1) I don't need individual subscribers to tell me this is happening -- believe
   me, I can tell already.

2) Neither I nor anyone else needs running commentary from other subscribers
   saying "stop already" or whatever. That only adds to the number of junk 
   messages out there.

3) Personal attacks won't be tolerated. If someone really does something out
   of line, *I'LL* sanction them. 

   These are the rules. Trespassers will be violated. Survivors will be
   prosecuted.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have

   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to

Subject: 911T Zeniths

Thanks to the several 'philers who responded regarding my subject carburetors.
Symptom was lumpy idle, poor transition to higher rpms, then running ok above
2500 rpm or so.Also float level gauge just overflowed when I tried to use it,
leading me to question my understanding of how to use it -- could the car 
really be drivable with more than one stuck float valve?

Yes!  I opened the carbs up as far as the float bowls and found three of the
four floats stuck to the bottoms of their respective bowls.  So four of the
six cylinders were getting no idle metering at all, and the car was still
drivable.  Back together, float levels set (I DID know how, after all), and
although highway performance is not perceptibly different, around town it's
like a different car.  Transition from idle to cruise is positively Japanese.

And now maybe I'll get more than 14mpg.  (Engine's in a Vanago, so I don't
expect miracles.)  The change was so significant that I don't really mind that
the $80 or so I spent for new float valves was probably wasted -- I put the
new ones in, but three of the old ones haven't seen a float in at least a
few hundred miles, so they haven't been working real hard.

Be of good cheer, amateurs.  Sometimes we actually find problems and solve
them.

Well, this is a very fast car, but what do you consider "normal"?  A 
chipped 951 can approach or virtually match a stock 87 930 in 
acceleration.  Can you inquire about chips from the previous owner?  If 
not, just examine the KLR & DME boxes under the passenger's feet.

No, absolutely not the problem.

Also not the problem unless you have a bad sensor or mixture problems.

Possibly bad gas or knock sensor shutting off the boost, loose intake 
air line or vacuum-type leak, boost system problem, bad spark plug or 
wire or coil.  Also may be bad sensor on the flywheel causing premature 
rev-limit (I think this is unlikely, as it would mess up the whole fuel 
injection).  Could also be really bad fuel mixture.  Depends on exactly 
what is happening, and other related symptoms: exhaust color, on/off 
characteristics, boost level, engine temp., etc.

Subject: 930 survey results

I received 4 responses, plus my own info. Thanks to all.
Yr.: 1-76, 3-78, 1-86
owned how long: average 4 yrs. (18 mo. to 8 yrs)
average mi. 78,000 mi.
mi. p/yr.: not enough info.
daily driver/pleasure: all pleasure (I've been using mine as a daily 
driver for the past 3 mo. while my truck is being painted.
repairs: most seem to be non-turbo related, oil leaks, chain tensioners,ect.
buy another: No-2, Yes-2(I'm in the yes), no comment-1
Some observations: While I was looking I found 2 basic types of turbos, 
really beat and normal wear and tear. My mechanic informed my that 
disconnecting the speedo was not uncommon, and a good mechanic should be 
able to tell the milage of the car by the motor. I also found that some 
people just drove the car and did little if any maintainence (as in 
mine)and some were meticulous. My goal was to find one in good condition, 
not perfect, because I wanted to be able to drive it anywhere and park it 
and not worry about door dings ect. My main concern was the drivetrain.If 
yours serious about buying one be willing to spend a few hundred bucks 
and have it thoroughly checked out. Also, as with any Porsche, you should 
buy the newest one you can afford. I've decided to keep mine for a few 
more years and then buy a newer one. I've owned the car for 9 mo. and 
have spend $4200, which averages out to $461 per mo. on repairs, with a 
major service. Since I still need to deal with the trans, and possible 
turbo rebuild I see my per mo. average about the same for the next year. 
I pay $1131 per yr for insurance thru A.A.A. On a side note a car dealer 
sold a 79 730 w/5,000 mi. for $30,000. He said the car was perfect. The 
owner drove it for awhile and discovered he had broken head studs. Last I 
heard he was looking at about $5000 in repairs, so ya never know.

     Guys:





         Thanks to all the porschephiles who reported their

Time-to-Coast in neutral from 65 to 55, on a deserted,

straight, level, windless road. From this information (and

the weight of your car+yourself+any passengers), the Maestro

will estimate your Drag Force at 60 MPH and compare it with

Road & Track's.



         When there's enough Drag Force Data on the various

models, the Maestro will present the results.



         And he certainly understands ifin you, like others,

wish to report  YOUR Time To Coast in neutral from 65 MPH to

55 MPH via private E-Mail to avoid being unjustly flamed.



         Oh- and the Maestro recently purchased a Sun

Distributor Tester (many thanks to Larry's Liverwurst

Laboratories, whose initials may or may not mean anything),

and has spent many happy hours testing Porsche 356/912

Distributors, as well as the beloved .050, and various VW's

(like the .009, .010 and .019). Even tested a few '68/69

912's with the vacuum retard. (There's a working vacuum pump

with the Sun, so vacuum retards can be tested too!)



         Data obtained from some 100 Original & Replacement

Distributors includes the maximum mechanical advance for

each type, and  ifin #3 cylinder is retarded and if so, how

much.



         Included too are the Distributor Diseases- no

advance, too much advance, jerky/sticky advance, and the

observed frequency.



         Not to mention some 10 Distributors whose points

could not fire as they were grounded for various reasons. In

some cases, the Engine (and maybe the CAR) was sold because

it just wouldn't run after the tune-up was done. Find out

why you don't want to use cardboard with aluminized mylar

for a points "insulator".



         Since the Maestro has been criticized for long

postings, he is hesitant to post the results here. But he'll

be happy to send you the data via E-mail if you desire and

if enough people express enough Desire,  he'll post the info

here.



          Just let him know.



          And:

 

          Keep The 356/912 Faith!!!

I really think the price is right now, I hope the torsion bar areas are

Hopefully the car is 100% complete,(seller say so) and all or most parts are 
restorable. If I remeber right the car also has a sunroof, I'll check in my 
picture files. It could be a 'smashing' car!


to TRAGEDY...........(IMOLA + FORMULA UNO = NO WAY!!!!)
After the tragic death of Ronald Ratzberger (saturday), Formula 1 was 
claiming its first death victim in several years. Because of that (and the 
fact F1 isn't my main interest) I decided not to watch the Live-coverage 
from Imola. In a way I wish I had, the horrible crash which took Senna's 
life must be a strong indication that the 'circus' is 'off track'. 
Senna was a great personality, true racer and sportsman, and a joy to watch! 
I will miss him, and F1 won't be the same! 

Next time it should be Eccelstone and the FIA executives put in race cars 
with ABS and active suspension to practice in, and the Ferrari 186 to race 
with. Wastegate disconnected..............!!! No barriers, just concrete.

Even if racing at Imola or Monaco GP is breathtakingly to watch, it should 
be banned, i think Estoril and Hungaroring should be 'the standard' to 
compare with when it come to 'track-safety'.

Thanks for the advices, I'll be occupied with removal of paint and bondo the

remover or exenter-grinder, or/and wire brush in some areas. In some areas 
the car has up to 5mm of bondo, but no rust underneath, it seem the previous 
restorer rather put on bondo than try to hammer out and straighten panels. 
Crazy,...eh? After I get to bare metal I'll zink spray the car.
 I will wait with the seam welding etc until I've stripped the outer shell, 
it'll be nice to do something else than cutting, shaping, welding and

   My suggestion is paint pens from hobby store, WalMart, etc. No cleanup

   A good cleaning with a degreaser,

   Spray gloss clearcote (hobbystore etc.) over it with a

  Jim, Andrew, and gang;
 I cant tell yet of the material's efficiency to deaden sound, but i can
tell you the stuff is of value  -like $35 a box  of six puny sheets!!
 Seriously though, each sheet is about 10"X24" , adhesive backed, maybe
a hair over a 1/16" thick and made out of the scrapings off the bottom
of the refinery's cracking tower...asphalt with maybe some rubber?

  Getting this stuff off a car's floorboard is the PITS..
  *But* it does seem to absorb some vibration and most importantly, protect
the body metal underneath, *provided* it was applied well, and a good
seal between the metal and the sheeting is made.
  For those of you with galvanized sheet constructed cars this is less of
a problem, but for Porschemobiles of pre-76 vintage...beware because gaps
and voids can trap moisture and encourage rust.  This would imply clean
surfaces, and one of those cute roller tools and heat guns the factory 
manual mentions for best application.
  
  As far as alternatives, i vote to stay with what the oem folks use and 
that is the asphaltic pads in direct contact with metal, after that you've
got little choice in the carpet pad/carpet or moisture barrier/fiber (door).
  I have first-hand results of someone using foam carpet pad...that is
a sponge waiting for rust, just add water.  Now that car's floorpan is
2/3 rust because the planet is 2/3 water!  And since they were very intent
on using something thick behind something that already fit tight..screws
werent long enough, and the car's interior looked overstuffed because it
was.  Blech!
  I'm speaking of a 76 914, but perhaps 9XX's are similar.
  Inside the car there were many places that could benefit from the 
dynamat (or Wurth's mat) application.  Most notably, the inner wheel house
at the footwell, and inside the front trunk, and inside the doors.  The
factory does apply a dusting of material in the doors, but not much.
  I believe adding some to the doors outer skin (on the inside) would
give the biggest gain (or attenuation, in this case), and be most
unobtrusive.  
  Another product that could be used for this sort of thing, and be much
more flexible in application, would be the high-build undercoatings that
come in spraycan form.  The stuff i have is rubberized and applies 
nicely..but the fumes will curl your eyebrows..beware!
  Hope this was of use.

From: "Jeffrey A. Shorey" <js@ee.duke.edu>
Subject: 911 Clutch change experiences

I had fun Saturday replacing the flywheel seal and clutch on my '73 911S.  It
was leaking 1-2 quarts of oil between fillups, and leaving a trail of oil
drops down the road.  You could rev up the engine using the hand throttle and
see oil dripping from the flywheel area at the rate of 1-2 drops per second ;-).

Anyways, it was easier than applying the same procedure to a 914 in that you
didn't have to jack the car 2.5 feet in the air to get then engine out - 3 or 4
inches sufficed once the 911's license plate panel was removed.  The only hitch
to getting the engine out is the damn air conditioner compressor bracket which
interfered with the right rear engine mount - you had to jockey the engine over
to get the bracket to clear.  Almost got out the Mikita grinder to take the
corner off of the stupid thing.

Stupid mechanic tricks uncovered: 1) one of the flywheel bolts was shorter than
the other five, unbalancing the flywheel.  2) The transmission mount bolts came
out with the threads stripped, mainly because they had standard (not metric)
threads.  Had to really scrounge around town to find some replacement 12mm
bolts...

Stupid parts supplier tricks: somehow I ended up getting the wrong clutch disk.
Of course I found this out after 15 minutes of jockeying the 100 pound
transmission around trying to get it to mate with the engine.  Turns out in
70-71 they used an almost identical clutch disk, but with a different spline
to fit the 901 transmission - that's the disk I got.

Stupid engineering tricks: installing the transmission seal (not my main
mission, but since I had the chance...) required special Porsche tool #xyz for
my '73 915 transmission.  This transmission is different from the later
models in that the throwout bearing guide tube is _cast_ into the case instead
of having two mounting screws.  Replacing the seal took sort of a cylindrical
corkscrew-theory device which pulled the old seal, and a special installation
tube so you wouldn't knock the new seal back into the differential.
Fortunately my local mechanic had one of these, so all that stood between me
and a new input shaft seal was a six-pack of cheap beer.

For the uninitiated: you don't need any special spacers or such stuff to
separate the engine and transmission.  They just pull apart - although its
easier if you remove the clutch fork lever arm from the bottom of the
transmission since it hits the engine at the end of its play.  When you
put them back together, you have to guide the fork into the throwout bearing.

Now the car runs great and leaks nary a drop of oil.  Now if I can just get
that speedometer cable to screw onto the transmission...;-).

From: Lance Flynn <71137.1777@CompuServe.COM>
Subject: ! RE: 89 951 questions (new owner)

  Jeff,
	Congrats on you new car. The 951S is one you'll be very happy with 
no matter what changes you do (or do not) make. Following is my two cents 
worth on your questions:
	Chipping - The head gasket on the 951 is definitely not its 
strongest point. Otherwise why would the factory be on its third (or is it 
more already) revision for this part? Increasing the boost, which is really 
how these aftermarket guys get more power out of these things) puts more 
load on the head gasket. There's no getting around this point. Different 
suppliers have created different mapping in the engine control module and 
some may have better parameters for minimizing the potential for blowing a 
head gasket than others. Maybe Jon Milledge has THE ANSWER. Other postings 
have listed how to contact him.
But why do you want to chip the car anyway? 162mph too slow for you? Losing 
drag races to Corvettes? Want to cheat in PCA Club Racing? Believe me, your 
car is pretty damn fast just the way it is. When you can go 10 or 11 tenths 
lap after lap on a variey of tracks, then go for more power.

	Tires - I tried unsuccessfully to find 17" wheels that would fit 
the 951S last winter, but there may be some. A good track set up is 8"x16" 
in front and 9"x16" in the back. The car understeers too much with the 7" 
rims that come with the car. If you want to avoid wheel spacers you need a 
53mm offset on the 8" fronts and somewhere between 57 and 60 mm on the 9" 
rears. 245-45s fit very nicely on these sizes. If you use your 17" idea 
with 245s in front and 275s in the rear, I think you'll get back to an 
understeering situation.  Besides even if you do chip your car up to 290hp 
I don't think you'll need more rubber on the back than the 245s give you.

Exhaust - I think taking out the converter for a little better flow through 
the whole system (put in a K&N air filter to help the flow on the inlet 
side) makes sense, although I don't think it hurts the converter to use it 
on the track. The Porsche part that replaces the converter is 
#951.111.093.05. I guarantee that the aftermarket replacements don't have 
the heavy gauge stainless steel or the perfect fit of this part. 
Unfortunately, you can probably only get it thru Andial which means $$$.

	Brakes - One of the best parts of the car. Squealing is generally a 
function of the pads you're using. My experience is no squeals from the 
street pads that Porsche supplies with the car. For track pads Cool Carbons 
don't seem to squeal for me, but Performance Friction do. Pads don't last 
long (front pads anyway) if you track the car, so you'll be able to try 
different brands and compounds till you find one you like.

	Turbo - Keep in mind that what keeps pumping through the turbo when 
you switch off the ignition is only coolant - not oil. Even the owners 
manual recommends running the the engine at "increased idle" (can anybody 
figure ouwhat that means) for a couple of minutes after "hard or extended 
driving". I'd be more concerned about doing this than extending the time 
coolant circulates through the turbo.

	Cooling - Can't comment on having the fans come on at a lower temp. 
I've never changed my sensor and I've never had any coolant temp probs. 
This sensor may just be a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

I hope this helps you out. Good luck.

Porschephiles;

I am going to be driving from home (Troy, NY) to Pensicola, FLA in a

Subject: Wire on 944 Hatch

While cleaning out the interior of my 1983 944, I noticed a broken wire which
has me completely mystified.  The wire is on the right side of the car and leads
from a point near where the hatch support strut is mounted to the car to a
sliding clip which is mounted to the shaft of the support strut.  This wire is
broken, and I will be fixing it soon.  I do not know, however, how long the wire
has been broken.  I suspect it has been a long time.  Just from looking at the
wire, I would have assumed it had something to do with the rear window defogger.
However, even with the wire broken, the defogger functions perfectly.  I can't
find anything about it in Haynes.

Any ideas?

Subject: What does SC stand for?


This is a great excuse for me to forward out to you mail-hungry
porschephiles my editor's column for the end of `93.  As usual, you
may use this for your own newsletter if you have one.  I can also, at
no extra charge, configure my mailer to send this out 20 times, since
it's been almost a week since anyone has sent me nasty email.

What follows is a recent interview I did with Santa Claus:

CW: To begin with, whats with the name? "Santa Claus" sounds Spanish,
but I happen to know you are German.  

SC: Ho ho ho. Don't feel bad, many people are confused by my name. I
am actually Saint Nicholas, and I am from a region of western Turkey
called Lycia. I became famous during the height of the Roman Empire. I
was known for my generosity, and most particularly for saving young
girls from lives of prostitution. My fame spread quickly through the
Empire (which is most of modern day Europe) when I was canonized, and
was made the patron saint of children.

CW: But I thought you were German.

SC: Ho ho ho. Many Americans associate me with Germanic cultures
because I was brought into this country by the Dutch, in whose
language my name is pronounced, "Sint Niklaas". The dutch language has
a very rhythmic quality, and the English speaking Americans thought
they were hearing "Santa Claus." That is where my name comes from in
your country.

CW: If I understand you correctly, you're trying to tell me you're not
German.

SC: Not in the least, no ho ho. In fact, my association with Christmas
is equally accidental. Saint Nicholas Day is actually December 6th,
and the tradition on that day was for someone to dress up as me (I
used to wear a red robe lined with white fur due to my station as a
bishop of the Catholic Church) and give gifts to children. After the
protestant reformation, most Europeans decided they didn't want to
give up this holiday, so it was merged with the pagan winter festival
which had already become Christmas. 

CW: This is going to cause a bit of confusion. Why would I interview
you for a magazine dedicated to German cars if you're not German?

SC: Well I ho ho hown a Porsche, if that helps. In fact, the
designation "SC" on the 78 through 83 911 stands for "Santa Claus." I
have a white 78 SC coupe, and I'm having the elves prepare a 73 RS for
Club Racing. 

CW: That's a bit of a stretch - what about Kris Kringle? Is he German?

SC: Ho ho ho. I suppose he is, in a way. You see, Kris Kringle is
another Anglicized Dutch word. The Christmas celebration revolves
around the "little Christ Child," which in Dutch is, "Christkindle."
Americans heard this as, "Kris Kringle." By this time I was already
associated with Christmas and so that name became associated with me.

CW: Well that's just great. Isn't there anything German about you?

SC: I have a summer cottage in Heidelberg. Ho ho ho.

CW: Bingo! That's the connection we'll use. By the way, a few more
sessions on the "stairmaster" wouldn't hurt there Nick.

Kevin,

I don't think you have to worry about over cooling the engine by
running the fan too much.  If the engine gets too cold the thermostat
closes and the fan has no effect.  I have observed this in my car.
I replaced the normal 92 C thermoswitch with an 82 C switch.  Once
the engine comes up to temperature the fan runs continuously but the
temp gauge never drops below the center tick (about 79 C) since the
thermostat shuts at 83 C.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    It is true that a modest gain could be realized by advancing the spark. 
     I would be happy to advance it for you for a small fee.
    
    The 10.5:1 cr cars do require higher octane fuel; 
    
    The DME's can be adjusted manually via the FQS (fuel quality switch) to 
    one of eight positions that will retard the spark 3 degrees and/or 
    increase the fuel injection pulse width in order to allow operation 
    with lower octane fuels.  BTW, this switch can be re-programmed to 
    *advance* the spark and to allow custom fuel injection settings.  As 
    delivered, the DME's do not automatically compensate for low octane 
    fuel.  This applies to normally aspirated Bosch Motronic systems.

Subject: possible stupid 944 question


The other day I was walking to my car in the parking garage at work
and I passed a Porsche owned by one of the guys I work with. While
walking by I read the model designators on the back of the car. On
the left side it said "Turbo". On the right side it said "944S2".
It is a 1989 model year car.

I admit that I don't know a lot about the 944 line-up, but I thought
that the 1989 turbo 944's were just "944S". Since I know the guy that
bought the car brand new, I know that there hasn't been any funny stuff
done to the car. But he doesn't know (or care) what the differences
were between the S2 and the S.

So, my question is: What's the difference? 

Also, I guess I'd like to know how unusual this car is. I can't remember
seeing another 944S2 turbo before.

Many thanks to anyone willing to answer this.

	Funny you should ask, as I just accomplished that fix on my '87
	Carrera.

	The sensor is on the front side of No. 3 cylinder head, behind an
	oval rubber grommet. Under the car, you look above the left axle, and
	to the inside of the left shock. It's low, just above the bottom
	of the sheet metal shroud.

	If you have already purchased the sensor, you have examples of what the
	grommets look like , as the sensor comes with new grommets.

	The plug end of the sensor is atop the engine on the left side with
	two other sensor plugs on a bracket, just forward of the distributor,
	and above the fuel rail. It is the top most plug, the white one.
	to remove the plug, there is a metal retainer which is fastened with
	a single screw, in the same plane as the bracket, remove the screw,
	and slide the retainer out, and the plug will come out of the bracket.

	Wire goes thru a clip bolted to the manifold.

	You may need to reomove a clip which retains the flywheel sensor
	leads to the shroud, just below the cover/grommet for the Temp. Sensor.

	Tools: the sensor has an attached lead, so you need a slotted deep
	socket to install the new sensor, 14 mm hex. The old sensor has a 
	13mm hex head, bummer! I cut the lead off close and used a 13mm deep 
	socket as I don't have a slotted 13 mm.
	Your longest screw driver isn't long enough to push the grommets
	back in place, I used a 24 inch long wood 1x2 to aid in this.

	It is a tight place, so struggle a while, but it'll all go back
	together in time. 

	Hint: tie a piece of string to the old sensor plug before you pull
	it through the bulkhead, as you wont be able to reach back there with
	the engine in the car!  

	New sensor has two leads instead of a single lead and a ground return
	path. Mating plug has two lead connections. 

Good Luck

Subject: 356 clutch problem

Greetings porschephiles,

I spent Saturday replacing the clutch on my '60 B coupe, and ran
into an unexpected surprise.  After getting everything buttoned
up, I started the car and tried to put the car in reverse.  No luck.
It seemed the clutch wouldn't fully disengage, limiting me to 2nd-
4th gears only.  Adjustment of the clutch pedal didn't improve 
matters any, even after all play was removed.  

I spoke with a local VW/Porsche guy who suggested that the fly- 
wheel nut may be interfering as a result of re-surfacing the 
fly-wheel.  He recommended machining the old nut or replacing
it with a thinner VW nut.

Any ideas?  I'm using a modified 912 T/O bearing, and the pressure
plate I put in didn't match the one I took out (but Automotion
assured me that I had the right part).

Zone 7 AutoX School
    Hi, fellow P-Philers!
    I attended the Zone 7 Autocross school this past weekend in the parking lot
at Candlestick Park.  I find myself wishing I know more ways of saying "Wow!" 
It was incredible -- what a kick!
    The first day was full of different excercises.  Everyone started with a
skid-pad excercise, trying to learn about throttle steering.  My group (the
beginning and intermediate air-cooled four-banger group) ran a slalom next,
then went on to a chicane course--close to a tiny autocross course!  Next was
the double-box, where we tried to link left-right turns and also link turns in
the same direction.  There was an Oval, where we tried to cope with a sweeper
at one end and a hairpin turn in the other (I spun about four times!), a
Braking course with three straights and three sharp turns, and finally a
Figure-8 which was two decreasing-radius turns strung together.
    The second day, we ran through and worked two different autocross courses,
a "fast" course, and a "technical" course.  I really loved the fast course. 
The technical one hated me.  Actually, I only spun once or twice on it.
    I was also able to ride with Bill Newton in his 912 around the fast course.
 That car really handles, and he really knows how to get a lot out of it!  My
other ride was with Sandy Provasi, in my 914, around the technical course. 
*That* was humbling.  We needed third gear on the long straightaway by the
timer, but Sandy said she didn't want to go for it because she didn't really
know how what kind of shape the gearbox was in.  Even with that, she bettered
my best time by four seconds.
    As with so many people, my biggest problem is that I won't slow down
enough.  It wasn't much of a problem on the fast course, but the technical
course had a very slow section that I just couldn't seem to slow down enough
for.  I also need to work on making my apexes even later.  Gee, you mean I
*have* to go out and drive more to get better?  Awwww....   ;-)
    So c'mon, everyone!  All you PorschePhilers in the Bay Area, sign up for
the second class!  There are supposedly still spaces open.  I think it's in
August sometime.  98 bucks is pretty cheap for two days of driving fun,
together with some of the best drivers in the area--who are eager to share with
you the knowledge and techniques that will make you a better driver.
    Besides, you didn't *really* need those tires anyway, did you?

  <some deleted>

  Steve, and the gang,
  This topic comes up ever' now and then..
  Let me say this about that...

  I have been running a pair of Weber 40IDF's on my '73 powerplant for
nearly ten years.  I want to return to Fuel Injection.
  Why?
  Well carb's SUCK of course..  can you say LINKAGE?

  The set was originally installed to replace a fuel injection system that
baffled me and was in need of expenditures to fix...what was expensive
back then is not so much now (in comparison).  My carb setup is from PMO
and is of very good quality.  At the time, carbs were very competive
price-wise to fuel injection parts..so the Weber's got in.  And the 
difference is wonderful, throttle response..engine sound..powerband all
improve slightly---or does it?  I think some of this is false...how many
times has your bravado increased by *LOUD* exhaust??  Without a dyno..
i cant tell precisely.
  If you are using/tuning a pair of Weber 40 IDF's..you are really tuning
FOUR independent carburetors that share a pair of float bowls.
  I have found this to be VERY difficult and time consuming...and i am
having some trouble getting it right!  I do have the manual, and 
flowmeters..but a rubber hose to listen to the jet squeek to balance out
the flow..*beat* me with the rubber hose! give me a Colortune and a 
Gastester, but now we are talking money for test equipment of equal
value to a working FI system!  no gain?

  On the other hand, since there is now TWO carburetors..they must be
synchronised perfectly or the discord will drive you nuts.  Ah! you say
adjustments are no problem..wait till you go to clean these out after
30k miles, and now the screw settings are off and you cant remember 
exactly what/how to get it right!
The problem is the finesse it takes to make the combo run over the long-haul.
Fuel injection requires less tinkering over the same period of use than
does carbs, and the carbs will need cleaning if the fume managment is in
place, or if long term storage occurs.
Weather can affect the things, you may not have a choke for cold-start..
so you pump raw fuel into your engine in efforts to keep it lit.
Since this is racing hardware, such amenities as *engine fume management*
are not used, so now your pretty is spewing oil fog all over itself and
fuming up your nose because the airflow thru the motor is also what keeps
your bod warm when you open up the heat valves.
  And the car just is not the same driving on a long cruise...cruising
implies precise control of all four carbs...VERY tough to maintain.

There are other carb combo's available..I've tried them too.
  -they suck also.
I still have my 32/36 DGV setup, and I've added a set of 34 PICT's also.
These have their own peculiarities in use, such as after-run dieseling,
or lack of choke..not a nice thing to have in extreme hot/cold climates
like Kansas.  And then you have the problem of icing, backfire, and flooding
so life is not so blissfully ignorant as a proper functioning fuel
injection system.

  Hope this was of use.

or on the course.  If you haven't ever done this, do it!

I also got to put some faces with the names I see on this net and
that was fun, hi to everyone I met!

I see lots of folks asking for recommendations on how to get more
power, better brakes, tires, suspension, etc.  For my part, I think
that if these folks ever intend to track their cars they need to 
go to a school or auto-x first, and then find out what they really
need.  For me, it's easy.  I need to learn to drive better!  My car
is a stock '70 911T, M&S all weather tires (good for learning about
oversteer), stock 2.2L still running the Zeniths, and I think the
car is great for this type of event, for me, for now.  All types of
cars, 356's, 912's, old and new 911's, 924's, 944's, and a 928.  Run 
what ya brung!

I was a little nervous about taking the 20+ year old car out there and
finding the redline more in a day than I had in almost 2 years, asking
the most from the brakes and suspension, and then driving the car home.
Now I know why Porsches cost so much.  Even this oldie (and every other
car I saw out there) did all it was asked and then drove home.  And
beleive it or not, I averaged 17 mpg for Saturday........ something to
be said for these mild small motors...

I know I'm the rookie preaching to many experienced drivers, but I also
know that there are lots of people out there who have never been to an
auto-x or a school.  Until you have, you don't begin to learn what your
car can do, just the way it is right now.

I was a little suprised (not to sound sexist, really) on the amount of
women instructors.  I had two during the weekend and they were both
great.  Yelling at me the whole time on how to improve, when to brake,
when to gas, and how to drive the exercise or course.  I met a few of
the women on this net out there, I hope the experience encourages you
(and some of your friends) to come out next time.  I trying to talk
my wife into it.  I think we all learned something that can help us if
we continue to do some type of track event or to drive to and from
work.

Quizz time-

how many people drove the car to work today that they took to class over 
the weekend?

how many people left the numbers on the car......

>...As part of my Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing class...I have
decided to design a 'smart' automatic transmission...Porsche has already
done this...Questions follow<

1)  How does it REALLY drive, is it as good as it sounds?  Almost!

2)  Has anyone heard any substantial complaints?  Yes!

3)  How successful was Porsche in selling Tiptronic equipped cars? Not very.

4)  Are there any other sources of information that I should read? Yes!

Having said that about that, Barney now removes his shoe and absent
mindedly begins inserting it into his mouth.

Besides power loss through the torque converter, all automatic
transmissions (smart or otherwise) share two common problems; up-shifting
and down-shifting.  The Tiptronic is no different!  It's been two years
since I last drove a "Tip" but here is what I remember.

As I recall, there is an automatic up-shift from 1st gear to 2nd whether
you want it or not.  For some reason, Porsche engineers have determined
that it is okay to blow up the engine, or at least bump the rev limiter in
their manual transmission cars but not in the Tiptronic.  This is extremely
disconcerting on an autocross course and down right dangerous on a less
open playing field. While I understand that this has been remedied in the
968, I believe it is still built into the 911 (993) map.

The big problem is downshifting.  Unless you're lucky enough to drive for
Frank Williams or those Italian guys, you are NOT going to be able to match
engine revs on the downshift.  The transmission will wait until the
downward gear change will rev the engine to something less than redline. (I
mean we are talking 500 to 750 RPM less than red line.)  This can be a real
surprise when the downshift called for two seconds ago suddenly takes place
right at the apex of the corner.

Lately a new complaint has popped up.  The new 911 manual gear box has six
forward speeds.  Introduction of the 6th gear has improved the overall
closeness of the ratios.  The Tiptronic, with only four speeds, now seems
remarkably sluggish in comparison.

The local P* dealer is reluctant to talk about sales in general, let alone
Tiptronics.  The inference was, however, that the Tip may be the least
requested option.

Additional information may be gained from reading "Can You Believe An
Inside Tip" By Jerry Sloniger, EXCELLENCE MAGAZINE, August 1993.

Maybe you will want to look at the possibility of converting last years
Formula One technology with its up-down, any time, anywhere ability into
passenger car use.

I'm going to post this on the "net" too, so stand by for more useful commentary

However, as I found out, if the wire grounds itself, the light comes on

Hi, I have an 84 930 and was wondering how accurate the factory
boost gauge is. The owners manual states normal boost as ~.8 bar.
most of the time my gauge confirms this, but it occasionally will
reach 1.0 bar.Is this normal for a stock waste gate ?
Also have any other 930 owners used the aftermarket 1.0 bar springs
available at many sources ? Should I be concerned about reliabilty
with a 1.0 bar spring in an otherwise stock engine in good condition ?

  o   o   Today is the HAPPY DAY.  I stopped by Taylorville, Ill. to pick
    |     up my 62/356B which had been there most of a year in as the
  \___/   only Porsche in a shop that specializes in Jaguars and anything
          else English.  It was a 'body only' job because there is nothing
wrong with the original engine.  So far as I know, it has never needed to
be removed from the car.  It started right up and without more than a
'once around the block' trial did 300+ miles today violating the speed
limit as much as I dared the whole way.

There are still some minor things .. like the horn isn't connected and
the new windshield has a scratch in front of the driver.  (my next door
neighbor is in the glass business and will get paid to put the new one
in .. when I get home .. another 800 miles from here)  Also, the radio
needs to get some of its dried out components replaced .. but it still
works and the clock needs to be fixed.  Not too bad for 32 years.

I won't take on the Maestro challenge, because my engine is a stock
normal engine.  It might be fun to see how fast it can go, but 110 is
not there without some mods.

I refinished my Fuchs two years ago. They have a center cap with the brass
Porsche badge and they looked awful when I bought the car. The centers and
the badge had to be stripped from the old paint and I used paint stripper
which worked after 2 - 3 treatments. Then I had to polish the brass badge
which wasn't that difficult. Ordinary brass polish. 


The tricky part was the painting. The centers were painted at the same time
as the wheels but the badges were more fun. I got enamel hobby paint, red and
black (I think it was Bostic). The horse and was the most difficult
because I don't have that steady hands (OK, I got help from my girlfriend).

After that a clearcoat which also came from the hobby shop. The brass has
not oxided significantly on these two years.
 
The paint I used gave acceptable but not excellent results. The brass surface
is not smooth and even with enamel paint you could see the structure of the
surface in the paint. If I had used more paint this may have been better??

The results were acceptable for the wheels but it wouldn't do for the hood 
badge.

I hope this helps.

The spectacular crash and death of A Senna came as a shock to many
(especially after the only days before in virtually the same spot).  My
local paper printed an AP story read, in part, " 'He was the victim of the
new regulations that banned active suspensions, traction control and
electronic accelerators,' Formula One reporter Castilho de Andrade said..."

I am a mechanical novice (is there a lower category?) so pitch any answers
to my level - -
What actually IS an "active suspension"?
I think I know what traction control is (sort-a-like ABS for pulling not
just braking?) but what is an "electronic accelerator"? Sounds like Formula
One is closer to virtual reality and Senna should be alive with his video
helmet on!

Subject: 951 Perf Mods - chips

I recently asked the list about perf mods for my 951 which Charlie, Kevin and 
Nathan, among others, replied to.  Thanks for the info/opinions! 

On chips, I spoke to Jon Milledge yesterday and his kit includes DME/KLR chips 
and wastegate shims which produce 265HP for the 951 with no known head gasket 
failures (at a good price $300) among 600+ customers.  However, Jon was unable 
to provide curves showing torque and HP curves due to his recent move from CA. 
So, does any of his customers have any?  Nathan?   

Since his kits require shimming the wastegate, what exactly does this mean and 
the results?  Is this to spool up boost faster?  Is lag reduced?  How 
difficult for DIY - tools?  Also, this implies that the mod is permanent which 
means you can't simply plug in the stock chips if you want to return to stock. 
 Are the stock overboost controls retained?  Can the clutch handle the 
additional power?  

I'm seeking as much info as possible before I commit to doing this.  

TIA,

Early C4's were criticized for understeer.  This can be removed via the 
usual suspension tuning & mods, and I _understand_ (not very factually) 
that Porsche improved this in later C4's.

Early C4's also had fuel sender problems and cracking tail light 
assemblies.  Haven't heard anything beyond that; maybe others have.

Oh, these cars are easy to make.

Just get a 944S2 (3 litre DOHC normally aspirated), and buy a "turbo"

No S2 turbo's were made, 'cept maybe as an experiment at the factory.

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What can you tell me about the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:

          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How is the list maintained?
     
     The list is maintained fairly regularly.  Stan tries to handle
changes at least once every other day.  There will probably be times
when he's on the road and less able to deal with problems, so be
patient.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  You can also 
reach Stan by phone at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070 when he's not
traveling.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about Unix-based mail problems with the list?

     If you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay attention to 
your replies.  The default will send the reply to the "porschephiles-
request" address, as it is the UUCP "From" address (first actual line 
of the mail header).  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT STAN ROUTINELY TRASHES SUCH 
MIS-ROUTED MAIL!  If your mailer starts screwing up, you will be dropped
from the list.  Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any 
more, send Stan mail and he will do his best to figure out what's
happening.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the copyrights or ownership of material sent to the list?

     The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence
by and between members of a closed community.  As such, the copyright
for EVERYTHING that ANYONE posts lies with them.  PERIOD.  This is 
*NOT* a bulletin board system, where consent for further redistribution
is implied by nature of the the system; it's PRIVATE.  If you wish to
use something written by someone on the list, you must first seek their
permission unless they specifically grant the right in that specific
posting to reprint it at will.  And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD idea
to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing
up down the line.  Remember, when you read something on this list: what
you are reading belongs to whoever wrote it.  They may have plans to
publish it further themselves.  They may want to keep it "private"
(i.e. just for list member use).  They may not care what gets done with
it.  It's still theirs, and before re-use, permission must be
obtained.  Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a
big deal about it.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  Period!!!  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM

mail you archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to
use BINARY mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, due in showrooms in 4/94.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

     FWIW - For what it's worth
     IMHO - In my humble opinion
     IMO  - In my opinion
     PCA  - Porsche Club of America, the major US/Canada Porsche
            enthusiasts organization
     POC  - Porsche Owner's Club, the *other* US Porsche owner's group;
            in the past they have been more competition-oriented than 
            PCA, which has many interest groups participating
     PCGB - Porsche Club of Great Britain
     PCNA - Porsche Cars of North America (Reno, NV), the US importer
     PANO - Not an acronym; this stands for Porsche Panorama, the PCA 
            national monthly magazine
     PAG  - Porsche AG, the mother company back in Stuttgart; "AG"
            stands for "Aktiengesselschaft," which means that the 
            company has publicly traded stock

     :-)  - Smiley face (turn your head 90 degrees to the left to "read"
            it); various iterations exist using different ASCII

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other well-known Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.

Subject: original paint


Michael asks:

>What value is THE origional color vs. A origional color?

The reason THE original color is so important on Porsches
is because of the way they are painted at the factory.
The body shell is painted inside and out - in every nook
and cranny with the body color. In order to do a *correct*
job of changing the color, the body must be stripped to the 
same extent that it was when it was originally painted. Not
too many people are willing to do that. I've seen a few 
total restorations where the color was changed and there was
absolutely no way to tell. I doubt that the value suffered 
much. On a very valuable collectible Porsche, I'd still stick
with the original color, just to protect my investment.

  It was my understanding that the 3.6L's all came from the factory with
Shell synthetic.  When I brought my RS America out of storage this spring,
I changed the oil with Valvoline 20W-50 Synthetic as advised by the
dealership.  YMMV...

My 931 has a similar wire.  The rear defogger gets it's juice through
the rear hatch shocks.  On one side, the switched +12V from the
console goes through an insulated shock to the heater wires on the
window, and on the other side the return current goes through an
UNinsulated shock, to the car chassis.  There is a wire connecting the
shock to the chassis on this side, but if I disconnect the wire, I still
can get defog current through the shock mount itself.

I suspect that the shock swivel mount is not a reliable connection for
the ~15A or so thet the defoger uses, and so Porsche added a wire to
handle that current.  You may find that the defogger works a little
better or more reliably with that wire reattached.

914 Rear Sway-Bar?
    Attention all 914 autocrossers:
This past weekend at the School, I heard quite a bit of talk about
the rear "sway-bar" (anti-roll bar) in the factory Sport Group on
a 914.  The consensus was that I should dis-connect the rear bar,
unless I was running a rather large (bigger than factory) bar up
front.
    What do you-all think?  I'm going to be running in Stock, so
I'm not up-grading the front bar.  Should I yank out the drop-links
and tie the rest of the bar out of the way?  Would the Factory have
done something that decreases cornering ability in the Sport Group?
    All replies welcome.

AutoX School
    Sorry for my ramblings yesterday, but I was still pretty wiped out
and my mind (such as it is) was very scattered.  I'm still excited about
the School, however.
    I'd like to thank Mark B. for his more coherent thoughts on the
school, and to re-emphasize one point that he made.
    Lots of people ask about go-fast parts for their Porsches.  The 
absolute *best* go-fast goodie that you can *possibly* get for your car
is learning how to drive your car to its maximum potential.  Period.
Go out and get some "seat time"!  It will make a *lot* more difference
than simply putting more HP under the hood.
    The school is a good place to get seat time, and you have a *lot* 
of world-class instructors.  If you don't want to use an entire weekend, 
find an autocross that you can get to.  You won't learn as fast, but 
you'll still learn, and there will be instructors there as well.  
They're glad to help people learn about maximum performance driving.

I would like to thank everyone that responded to my clutch problems.
The wisdom on the net to rescue once more.  Really, everyone, the
response was VERY helpful - thanks to everyone.

I plan to take the least invase approach first.  It was suggested that
the strands inside the cable could be tearing one at a time and that
the cable may have been damaged by contacting the heat exchanges.

Yesterday I ordered a new clutch cable, and while I am at it I also
ordered a new throttle cable and the bronze bushing for the pedal
cluster.  My pedal cluster has no bushings in it, and the throttle
sticks sometimes.  I can hopefully fix all this stuff in one shot!

Once I replace all these cables I will be able to tell if the
clutch cable is pulling out of the tube.  If it is I will fix it then.
I really hope that it is only the cable that is broken and not
the mount :-). [optimism is all]

If anyone is interested in the procedures that I go through while 
replacing the cables and the bushings please let me know and I will
post a summary.

On my way to work yesterday, something was definitely amiss.
I quickly put my finger on it - my passenger's side spring plate

had mysteriously stopped squeaking.  The driver's side never
squeaked, but the passenger's side made this annoying little noise
with every slight movement of the spring plate.

Subject: Zone 7 school

Ditto Dave and Mark.  Last weekend's school was a blast.  I have not
yet stopped having flashbacks!  One of my favorites is a right hand
sweeping turn at full throttle with the instructor screaming GAS, GAS,
GAS, GAS in my ear.  The start/finish line was near the exit of the
turn, and I remember thinking that I would probably kill the flagger
(who should have been positioned on the other side of the course,
IMHO) if this pedal-to-the-metal idea didn't work.  But, I followed
instructions and, of course, the car went around the turn on rails
just fine.

At times I wished that I weren't driving a turbo car to begin my climb
of the learning curve, although these thoughts were temporarily
suppressed on the longer, straighter sections of the course :-).  Even
though I was expecting it, the sudden arrival of power nevertheless
sent me spinning a couple of times.  The ultimate in frustration,
however, was exiting a turn with my eye on the approaching apex and
the accelerator mashed to the floor, waiting for what seemed an
ETERNITY for the cavalry to arrive with the extra horsepower.  I
understand that there are techniques for mitigating the lag problem
(better anticipation, left-foot braking, etc.), but these were a bit
too advanced for a beginner such as I.  Nevertheless, I am determined
to learn to autocross a 951 well, which I am convinced is possible
after having had the opportunity to ride with Jon Milledge (who was
mentioned in a few recent postings) at a no-points practice event at
the Pleasanton fairgrounds a couple of years ago.  What an experience!

Candlestick Park lived up to its reputation as the inhospitable place
that nearly sent the Giants to Florida.  Especially in the late
afternoon, the wind occassionally pitched the timing and scoring
trailer around a bit, picking up debris and hurling it at the
assembled cars and participants.  This had a few people worrying about
paint jobs, but I don't think there was any real danger.  The parking
lot surface seemed pretty good (much better than the coarse runway
surface at the previous Crow's Landing venue, I was told), although
there were a couple of pieces of asphalt missing in the line I was
hoping to use in the double-box exercise.  The lot had some elevation
changes that created an off-camber turn on one of the courses (no
high-speed banking, unfortunately ;-)), but this added to the overall
learning experience, while subtracting from several people's scores
(all driving 911's as I recall) who downed multiple pylons there.

As for Mark's quiz, I did drive my autocross car to work yesterday
(thump-thump-thump, I will probably have to get the front tires shaved
to make them round again :-( ), but I washed the number off the
windshield beforehand.  I decided that people on the street would be
more likely to think that I had just come from a used car lot than
would think that I was any kind of racer!

They may seem expensive at first, but since they 'last a lifetime' with
proper cleaning and oiling, they actually end up cheaper after a few
years.  Airflow is supposed to be improved somewhat, giving a small hp

Active suspension is a concept invented by Lotus ? (I think..), all it means is 
that the suspension system is 'smart' in that it stiffens the side the load is

up.

I've got a driveshaft flange that has been helicoiled (actually 3 helicoils

now 1 of the inserts is stripped, and I can't torque the other 3 bolts up
to spec (60 ft-lbs) without them starting to pull out.  I don't really feel
like being stranded somewhere with a disconnected driveshaft and I don't want
to have to check the bolts every week to see if they are working themselves
out - I want to fix it right.

For you welders out there, could I take the flange out, remove the inserts,
mostly fill in the holes, and retap the threads?  Would my weld even stick to
the thing (which is certainly steel, but of unknown metal treatment)?  Or
should I just get a new flange altogether ($$$?)

It appears to be held on to the transmission by a single bolt in its center,
torqued to 20-30 ft-lbs.  Does it just have a spline on the other end or
what?  Will it's removal cause all my $ynthetic gearbox fluid to $pill out?

Soren,

     The K&N  filter will allow your engine to breathe better
*ONLY* if the old filter was limiting the flow (rather than the

ea on paper filters.  The K&Ns for a CIS 911 are about $40.  Then
you buy a spray can of oil, and clean and re-oil them yourself.
I felt no performance difference, but like being able to clean

Subject: '86 951 Stereo Squeals

If there are any car audiophiles out there, here's some questions for you. 
I have decided to get the stereo on my recently purchased '86 Pearl White 
951 in shape for the summer. It is a relatively new Panasonic tuner/CD 
front end with a detachable face hooked up to a Rockford-Fosgate amp(4x20?) 
into stock speakers. The driver's door speaker is blown. I don't want to 
cut anything. I assume the the existing front end/amp with good front 
speakers and a Bazooka for bass should be an improvement over the existing 
situation.

1) What is a good replacement door speaker? According to Crutchfield, the 
speaker needs to be 4x6metric and less than 1.625" deep. They sell nothing 
that works. I would like to use a high-end plate speaker; ie. MB Quart or 
ADS.

2) Crutchfield also says that the rear speakers are hard to change. This is 
not a big deal since I don't want to change them anyway.

3) I would like to hook up a Bazooka tube(s) for additional bass. My 
options are

a) Unpowered 6" Bazooka tubes hooked up to the rear speaker leads in the 
hatch. I would trace the wires, cut them off close to the speakers without 
removing the speakers, and hook them up to the Bazookas. This means that I 
use existing puny wires.

b) Same thing except put the Bazooka(s) in the footwells of the rear seats. 
This would allow me to run Monster cable direct to the amp (in the front 
passenger footwell.) If the amp is a triamp (haven't checked yet) then I 
could have more power for a single Bazooka only.

c) Place 1 powered Bazooka and 1 unpowered Bazooka (wired in series) in the 
footwells of the rear seats. Add Y-connector to existing amp power feed to 
power the Bazooka. Add patch cable to feed music to Bazooka. Retain 
existing rear speakers.

Questions:

What is the best option?

How would a crossover/filters fit into this?

The existing stereo sometimes makes a high pitched squealing noise which 
goes away when I turn the stereo off/on or turn it up enough to drown it 
out. I have experienced this in other 944's and would like to get rid of 
it.

The stereo now is often used at top volume. This is sometimes insufficient. 
I expect that it will be sufficient if I replace the blown speaker. What 
else can be done?

Did I say that I have never installed anything in a car even remotely 
electrical.

And speaking of next month's paycheck.

I am considering KONI Sport gas shocks for the car. I would like to do 
springs at the same time. The only springs that I have found that are rated 
at 250+ lbs (Troutman, Weltmeister) lower the car. This is unacceptable for 
me (live in NYC.) Eibach apparently sells 220lb springs with stock ride 
height. Would this be a big difference over stock? Any suggestions? The car 
is stock now except for an Autothority chip and cat pipe.. The rear shocks 
are soft, which is prompting this exercise. The tires are 205/55 and 225/50 
RE71R's.

   I when to the local hardware store and bought a pressure guage used for
water tanks or chemical sprayers..  It goes to 50 pounds and is in 2 pound
increments but it will tell you close enought what your pressure I think the
book says 29-35 pounds or it that a little high.. I set mine to 32 and it
runs just fine.

Our local commentators (including Grand Prix winner Alan Jones) analysed
the accident and identified a probable suspension failure at the
entrance to the corner. The car in fact veers right into the Armco
instead of even attempting to turn left.

If this is so then the lack of high-tech solutions seemed to play little
role in the accident. The same goes for Alboretto's wheel
failure, causing severe injury to pit crew. Can't say about Ratzenberger.

I saw the accident on TV live and it seemed survivable, but I guess
luck ran out for Senna. It certainly is disturbing when this happens,
and reinforces the dangerous nature of racing cars.

I read the reply to Stan about the supercharger option to improve performance.
I have an '87 911 Cab that German Auto in Knoxville supercharged - I could not
be happier. The car now has the power I had always wanted it to have - no 
turbo lag, just fast from th start. I had them put in the paxton supercharger.
They dynoed the car at 350 horsepower. So far I have put over 5,500 miles on 
the car and have not had any problems. The people at German Auto were great to
work with, and they were very concerned that I be happy with their work - I was!

I understand Bruce Anderson has been to visit them and was impressed with their
work. I believe he went with them to Road Atlanta with a C2 and C4, both with 
wipple superchargers. They set track records while they were there. 

If anyone is interested in supercharging their Porsche, I encourage them to 
contact German Auto (615) 691-1911. If I had to decide whether or not to 
supercharge my 911 again, I would do it in a heartbeat.

The wire is the grounding wire for the rear hatch area courtesy light. There

If you look you'll see a short length of black plastic tube around the piston

Lots of Senna discussions which, IMO, is appropriate even here at 
PPhiles, and the other lists dealing with autos that I'm on. It was 
definatly the most black weekend in racing I personally have ever felt. I 
personally watched Senna win at Detroit and Phoenix, and out qualify 
others at the other F1 venues I've been to. 

He was a master to watch drive, especially in qualifing. Watching his
hands only move fractions of an inch while others steered back and forth
was amazing. Never a hesitation, only sheer concentration and 
determination when going for that "fast" lap. I, and F1 fans everwhere, 
will miss him and his prominance he brought to autoracing.

What is active suspension? Basically, take out your springs and shocks and
replace them with actuators (pneumatic or hydraulic). Tell the actuators
to push or pull based on feedback signals from every imaginably sensor
(pitch rate/acceleration , roll rate/accel, lateral accel, driver input,
force exerted on suspension struts, speed, etc...). The control laws are
very complex and the speed of computation/actuation must be very fast as
well as redundant for safety. 

Watching an actively suspended car around the same circuit as this year's 
passive (springs/shocks) cars is like night and day. They are bumping and 
bouncing much more and have MUCH more instability. I think we will see a 
lot more crashes this year, due to the lack of active suspension alone :-(

The instability caused by pitch changes will cause many high speed 
handling problems. The lack of traction control mostly effects low speed 
handling and is not as much of a safety problem. Besides, the cars 
sounded awful with traction control on (sounds like engine missing and 
sputtering, yuck).

My 91 911 has always done this. I've also seen many Porsches that do it 
also. I always thought it was a feature, but could never figure what the 
benefit was. Seems year and model independent too.

My right turn signal seems to dim and stay on according to the dash when
putting it on while driving, but it is actually blinking outside the car. 
I've never been able to figure it out in almost 7 years now. I think it's
low voltage or something related to it, but I don't know where. I don't
like auto electric work-I'm glad I own my Porsche (as opposed to an
english/french/italian car) :-))) It always works, and never lets
me down.

Kits which require the shimming of the wastegate are a REAL pain the

Getting the wastegate bolts off w/o breaking them is no simple chore,
and if you break something on the wastegate (which is cast iron) you
are SOL.

Personally I recommend the kits which use the modified banjo bolt (like
autothority).  You can change the boost in about 20 seconds (wiuth a
spare bolt and a 17mm wrench) and the bolt is more accessable than the
dipstick (guess that's not saying much). 

You have heard it before but I'll say it again - my opinions may be

Yes, that's a feature, not a bug. Long time ago (1980) many German
municipalities turned off their street lights at night to save energy.
(In my town it was 11PM.) German cars were required to have this 
feature to allow you to park on the side of the road, or half-on-
the-sidewalk style, with a marker light on, and not get hit by
a bicyclist (not a car, which would see your reflector light, but 
a bicyclist.....). The idea was not to leave it on all night; if you
need to park all night you get off the road entirely.

But many times I inadvertently left the light on all night and the 
battery didn't need a jump next day. Could be the US-spec cars 
don't just turn on the front and back marker lights, they turn on
lots more (for more info write: Rolling_Tupperware-request.....).

Bottom line: most Euro cars do it. Just neutralize your turn signal
when you stop and you're all set.

Here's the deal, I don't know where I read this, but years ago, I read that a
German motoring law says that when you park on the street, at night you must
leave a light turned in. I think it has something to do with the width of the
street. 

It is definitely a FEATURE of your car! Read your owner's manual. Not once but
a number of times. You'll be amazed at what you'll pick up.

THis feature, only works when the key is removed from the ignition. Up on the
lever, right side ligths and viceversa. My Mercedes has the same feature, but it
located right on the headlight switch. Two extra positions CCW.

Hope this helps! Just be carefule when getting out of the car...

This is normal European car behavior. In Germany and some 
other countries you are required to display "marker lights" 
on the side nearest the road if you are parked beside the road at 
night. 

It's a good safety idea, but a pain in the neck if you 
pull into a parking space in daytime and don't notice that the
signal lights are on. I've done a few push-the-car-and-jump-in 
rolling LeMans starts over the years. (assuming flat parking 
lot... - key on, push hard, jump in, 3rd gear, clutch out, pray,
doodle the gas, drive away) If you're pessimistic or not the

Hello out there Porsche Pushers!

Here is one for you. I think 911/914 owners could help me...

Checking the shifter linkgage last night, I discovered that the shift coupler
(behind the front seats, under an inspection plate on a 911) had some play.

It can be traced to a plastic bushing. The bushing has elongated in the forward/
backward direction (not up/down). It is about 1mm per direction. THis actually
translates to about 1/2" of free play at the shift lever.

I know there are replacement bushings available. Is the play normal? I would
think that you would want NO PLAY in this critical part. Am I right?

Also, has anyone replaced the bushings? The shift coupler is held by a square
head screw to the trans, and by a C clamp to the shifter... Once I remove it,
Is the shaft on the coupler a press fit? Can it be hammered out with a drift?

As usual, thanks in advance for your wisdom!

He wants $18.5k, which is a rather cheap; I'm guessing he didn't pay that

Should I stay away from this car? Otherwise, it sounds like it could be

It's a feature.  When I was in Germany in March, I noticed it
on our rental car also (it was an Opel).  The Germans use it
when parking at night in a precarious position.  They would
leave the turn signal on for the side of the car that was on
the street (the other side was usually on the sidewalk...).

This also happens on my 951 and I believe it is a feature across all the
models.  It is intended to be a feature.  The idea being instead of
leaving your parking lights on (lots of bulbs) when parked on the street
you can leave the turn signal on and only have two bulbs on.  I've used
this feature a few times, and I've seen a fair number of cars parked
with only turn signals on in Germany.

 Drew Writes:  "In the latest issue of the U.S. publication, Autoweek, there is
an
article on PCA club racing at Las Vegas speedway.  There are some great
camera shots of Utahn's Monty Smith (white, used-to-be-an-RS-America but 

now looks and moves more like a 3.8 RSR), Mike Doolin's Red RS America, Martin
Snow's Martini 934 and a number of others.  Porschephiles own Barny Bettilyon
even gets to say a few prophetic words that I can relate to.  Check it out..."

I saw that.  I too enjoyed the pix and the publicity.  Am I being an elitist? 
I had hoped for a little more content...like a little more on what the classing
system was like, what people needed to do to prepare their cars, what the range
of entrants was from SERIOUS CARS to streetables, how it fills a niche for
Porschephiles between schools and high-dollar racing, and so on.  I think I saw
the word "fun" at least 15 times.  I think we got the message that this is
supposed to be fun.  But for a lot of participants there is more to club racing
than just having fun.  I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I need to get my nose
out of the clouds and have more fun.

Probably the #1 cause of the cable tearing strands one at a time and then
snapping is failure to keep the end of the cable from rotating when adjusting
the nut (or pair of nuts) at the end of the cable.  I suggest you use a set
of vice-grips or equivalent.  What happens is that when you tighten the nuts,
the cable end wants to turn with them and it just happens to be the direction
that unravels the twisted strands, usually breaking several in the process.
This weakens the cable right at the joint between the threaded end and the
cable...eventually the two will part ways.

Another thing you might check is it see if the ground strap on top of the
transmission is still connected.  I have heard stories where the strap was
not connected and the clutch cable becomes the best ground strap available.
It becomes hard and brittle from the heat and eventually snaps.

Now that I am almost out of college (ya hoo!) I would like to get more

I didn't mean to be sarcastic in my previous reply, but your signals are
working as they were designed to work and documented in your owner's

I hope that one of the net wizards can help me with a problem with the fan
switch on my '89 944S2.
It always works in position 4 (the super high speed).  It is tempermental and
works once in a while in the lower speeds (1, 2, or 3).  It doesn't seem to
make any difference if the A/C is on or off.  It does seem to make a difference
in the outside ambient temperature.  It worked properly, to the best of my
recollection during the past winter.  Now that it has started to warm up
a bit, it is unstable.  It was also unstable last summer as I recall but I
didn't worry about it.  
 
Thanks in advance for any help.

Chances are it's supposed to do that. I'm not sure if U.S. spec cars
have this feature, but German-spec cars do. If you leave the turn
signal activated and pull the ignition key, the turn signals on the
appropriate side will stay on (but not flash). It's intended as a
marker light for when you're parked on a dark road or some
such. Not sure if the main light switch needs to be on or in the
parking light position to have the turn signals act as markets.
 
Is your car a gray market car? I can't remember now if US cars
do this too.  Bottom line: Don't worry about it, just don't leave
the lights on.

actually water-soluble.  This is so cleaning of the filter can be done
using soap and water rather than solvent.  "filter coat" as it is known
in the HVAC business, is used on many filters to boost performance.

On active suspension:

In the research/developent facilities of some German automobiles
manufacturers the future of the active suspension is forged.  As Karl
writes:

What is active suspension? Basically, take out your springs and shocks and
replace them with actuators (pneumatic or hydraulic). Tell the actuators
to push or pull based on feedback signals from every imaginably sensor
(pitch rate/acceleration , roll rate/accel, lateral accel, driver input,
force exerted on suspension struts, speed, etc...)

Add to this a front-mounted camera that examines the contours of the
upcoming road surfaces, feed this input to the active suspension, and you
have a wheel that holds its position while going over a pothole!  Neat?! 
Anyway, this is coming.

Dear Fellow Porsche Owners,

I need help! My 1973 914 1.7  backfires upon deceleration.
The backfiring usually occurs between 3k and 2k. I have tightened
all of the header bolts and my exhaust system appears to be solid
and tight all the way through.  I have cleaned the contacts in my
throttle body switch (although were really clean when I opened it).
I have checked the vacuum on my pressure sensor and I have swapped
sensors (I have two that appear to be in good shape). All of my
hoses appear to be tight. I have adjusted the valves and set the
timing. I have new points, plugs, etc.  The engine has about 12k on
a rebuild and the backfiring started within the last several weeks.
I recently replaced fuel injector #1 -- it was leaking. The car
accelerates and cruises very well. There is no popping on the way up
the rpm scale. Other than a leak in the exhaust system, I would
like to know what, if anything, can cause a car to backfire. Could
it be timing, fuel-air mixture?? If you have any insight or
suggestions, I would like to hear from you. I appreciate your help.
Thank you!

 Dear Andrew,

The behaviour you describe is normal and intentional for European Porsches
and perhaps also for Porsches made for the US market.  I have a Eurospec
911.  The purpose for the turn light (either right or left) to remain on
even after the ignition is off is to provide the vehicle with a parking
light.  

If you go to Europe you will see much of this use of the parking light, not
on Porsches alone.  I belief it is a TUF requirement in Germany.  That your
car required a jump suggests a weak battery and/or alternator.

I'm parking on the road next to a curb when its getting dark out.  I
usually set the turn signal for a left hand turn which will only
illuminate the turn signal lamps on the left.  Hopefully this makes it

Much of the observations over the last few seasons regarding F1
advances in technology have focused on the areas of traction control,
semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspensions.  Engines have gone
from turbocharged to normally aspirated with, so it seems, no apparent
loss in speed.  So, engines have gotten better at making these cars to
go faster and advances in handling allowed them to take advantage of
the increased power. The loss of traction control and active
suspensions seem to have upset the balance between the car's ability to
make power and keep it on the track, almost like the problems Indy cars
had a few years ago where the performance of the cars exceeded the
capabilities of the track at Indy.
 

What do Pphiles think ?

Is it a balance of technology problem ? Is it a driver problem, i.e., do 
driver's have to re-learn driving skills they lost as a result of using 
active suspension, traction control, etc. or does FISA need limit 
engine power and speed among other things, ( tire width, crashworthiness, 
etc.),to make things safe ?

What is the problem, if there is a problem ?

What is the best way fix it ?

This is indeed a feature.  It is intended to allow you to park the car on
a street at night (who would do this, I don't know) and turn on the lights
on the street side of the car so that hopefully someone will see it (and
not hit it).

  Jeff and gang,
  I 'spose the flange is forged steel and not cast iron...
  And since it is junk..you cant make it worse than it is so it might be
worth a go.  How much is a new/recycled flange?  How much to pay for a weld
and precision tap on the flange?  That would seem to determine which path.
  Regardless of which route, you will give the tranny a chance to leak your
lube, so drain it before you start.
  On the welding;
  Eesh, yeah the strip-outs could be weld-filled, but getting the tap to
make a nice hole in the exact same spot might be dicey.  If it were mine,
i might try it just so i could file it away for later..
  But i think i would trust a made right and known good part that had
not been 'diddled' with...the doggone thing just has too much riding 
on it to be trivial.  (cheap insurance)?

Subject: Re: Senna Questions

There was also some suggestion that due to the regulation changes some
of the teams were using a little less wing etc.  One of things that
happened right around the point where Senna should have entered his turn
was the dip in the pavement in which his car seemed to bottom.  Could
coming out of this in combination with less down force have been part
the problem? From the angles that I saw it was hard to tell whether or
not the car veered but component failure must be a big possibility.  I
assume that they may figure that out from looking at the car? 


I too am interested in the exact role of the active suspension... does
it also eat irregularities in the pavement surface or is it more coarse
than that? - more like just a left-right (front-back?) bias change?

From my readings in old issues of Porsche magazine (d.b.a. Excellence)
there was only the silver rose limited S model in 1988.  1000 units, I think.

In 1989, all 951's had the same specs & mechanicals as the 1988 S-version,
so the older "standard" turbo model was no longer available, and what was the
"S" became the standard package.  It's actually redundant, though 
perhaps helpful, to refer to one of these as an '89 951-S.

 Your understanding is correct.  Most residential streets are narrow and not
strongly lit.  Oft-times cars will park half up on the curb (this is OK) and
so having some lighting on the street side is a useful safety measure.

    My understanding is that the turn singal light remaing on is
    similar to the parking light "feature." When people in Europe park
    their cars on the street at night, they leave the outside (away
    from the curb, that is) turn signal on as a safety measure.  Could
    you Euro-P-philes confirm this for me?

    Actually, I think that this is a designed-in "feature".  (As

used in Deutchland, but (at least) early-mid 70's Porsches seem

I have wanted to do this for quite some time, and have finally gotten
around to it [even got Stan's approval].

The combined wisdom present on PorschePhiles is pretty tremendous, and there
are many tidbits of knowledge which are really helpful when debugging
problems.  For instance, when my 1.8L 914 wouldn't idle I was totally stuck
until someone suggested: check the oil filler cap gaskets, which solved my
idle problem entirely!

I would like to collect these tidbits.  I am mostly interested in
914s, but out of respect for the other Porsche models I will also
collect techtips on them as well.

Once I have organized all submitted techtips they will be available for
anonymous ftp from tta.com and be distributed once a month like the FAQ's.
Updates will be made as more submissions are received.  As time permits I
will go through my archives for helpful tips, but I only have 914 stuff.  If
someone would like to do that for the other models, please do!

Submitting a techtip.  Send an e-mail message to 
'techtips@tac3.vv.hac.com'.  Do NOT send the message to my personal
mailbox.  Use your own judgement as to whether you want to post it
to the list.  The subject line on your message should include the
Porsche model that the tip applies to as well as a brief description
of what the techtip addresses.  The body of your message will have 
the techtip.  Please try to keep these short: the one or two liners
that can be SO helpful.  If more people seem to be interested in
longer techtips that can be changed - let me know what you are

Subject: active suspension and Senna's death



    > What is "active suspension" ?

       Active suspension is to conventional suspension what Electronic
   fuel injection is to a carburetor; imagine that you take what is
   really a very crude mechanical system (a spring and damper shock) and
   replace it with a computer running at 40million calculations+/second
   tied to a hydraulic controller. Yes, active suspsension can be used to 
   invert body lean (Road and track did an article featuring Lotus testbeds
   years ago, showing settings that actually leaned into corners) but the
   significant advantage is in dampening out the normal spring effects
   conventional suspension have.  I saw a demo video GM produced about 8 years
   ago, showing 2 Corvettes (one with, one without A.S.) running across
   obstacles like speed bumps, high-speed dips, railroad-type risers, etc,
   and the difference was almost laughable; the car with conventional 
   suspension would bounce and settle where the A.S. car absolutely glided  
   across bumps as if they weren't even there. The net is a car that
   rides like a Lincoln but within milliseconds cad adapt to handle as stiff 
   as if it had 1" sway bars, hi-rate springs and poly-bushings. 
       If you ever watched recent F1 video, you'd see the difference from
   the car-cams in how much smoother the Williams-Renault car was than 
   the lower technology cars. But claiming that removing these killed Senna
   is simplistic; Senna advocated these because his Williams-Renault team
   was King at making a car with automatic trannys, throttle control, ABS,
   and active suspension and beating everyobody's butt for years; his 
   remarks probably had to do less with his life than his livelihood.  My
   understanding is that the powers-to-be were trying to a)level the playing
   field for the guys who couldn't engineer that well, and b) try to reduce
   the cost out of F1 by restricting the amount of technology needed to 
   compete (Closed-loop traction control was banned from drag racing for 
   the same reasons).  Some cars (Ferrari) were probably more dangerous with
   their unrefined A.S. than without. F1's efforts at removing technology and 
   Turbos makes a lot more sense than, for instance, talk of removing ground
   effects in Indy cars to "slow the drivers down for safety reasons"
   (spreading oil on the track would have the same effect).  Plenty of other 
   teams have managed to keep drivers alive without this technology for
   years, having it was part of the reason Senna won so much and made so 
   much. 
     The most remarkable reminder of Senna's crash is that so many crash at
   ridiculously high speeds and walk away. If any technology was missing for
   Senna, could it have been a barrier of $50 barrels ??

Subject: tire pressures

Hello netters,

At inspecting the tirewear of my 944 the other day a simple question  
occured me that I couldn't figure out. Given the car's 50/50 weight  
distribution on the axis how come the recommended (manual) tire  
pressures are uneven at 2/2.5 bar (29/36 psi)? Seems to me that the  
usual load of a driver and at most one  passenger cannot much off-set  
the weight distribution as they are sitting quite close to center of  
gravity. So if no serious luggage is carried what is the point of the  
tire difference in pressure? Is it just to make sure that there is no  
wheel damage in bottoming out in with unusually heavy load in the  
back? If I know that I do not have it am I better of with even  
pressures? (I have identical tires&wheels all around but the manual  
seems to indicate that the right pressures are independent of some  
changes like 215 versus 205 etc.).

Mehr Licht, bitte.

I know there are replacement bushings available. Is the play normal? I would

Also, has anyone replaced the bushings? The shift coupler is held by a square

Is the shaft on the coupler a press fit? Can it be hammered out with a drift?"

No the play is not normal.  I experienced that in a 914 1.7L.  There was a lot
of play in the shifter when the car was in gear, which was not good.  I did not
personally replace the bushing, however the person who did indicated it was a

Subject:  Shift Bushings

    Lou-

    I think you may be a confussing the bushings in your shift
    linkage.  The bushings that are readily replaceable are the ones
    at the bottom of the shifter (one is a collar the other a cap that
    the ball sits in).  The coupler that you are talking about (the
    one under the inspection plate behind the front seats in the
    tunnel), at least to my knowledge, does not have a replaceable
    bushing-  the whole unit must be replaced.  I would not, however,
    jump out and spend the $60 or so to replace it just because of the
    play you mention:  as I recall, there is a significant amount of
    free play even in the new units.  I agree as to not wanting any
    play, but it is there.  AS for the coupler itself, it comes off
    by loosening the C clamp blot and by taking the lock/set bolt
    (square head screw) out of the coupler and shaking it off.

    I hope this helps.

The bushing is actually made that way in order to reduce
vibration back to the shift stalk. Even if you replace the
shift knuckle, the new part would be about the same. The bushing
isn't sold as a separate part, to my knowledge, but you can make
one out of Delrin or Nylatron and insert it as you said.

The biggest cause of sloppiness is the two bushings up front.
They're cheap and fairly easy to replace.

I would be very skeptical of a media commentator "analyzing" a crash 
[U.S. spelling!], unless s/he saw Senna's car's right side at the 
fateful corner and clearly saw a suspension problem.  The video from 
ESPN (USA) which came via Italian sources, showed a blurred image of 
the car plowing off the corner, completely intact as viewed from the 
left side.  The image was blurry due to tube-type cameras with 
attendant phosphorus lag, rather than solid state pickups.

> I saw the accident on TV live and it seemed survivable, but I guess
> luck ran out for Senna.
Going into a nearly immovable wall at 186mph at an angle around 60 
degrees is *far* from survivable, due to the rate of deceleration.  In 
Senna's case, extreme skull & brain damage resulted, _possibly_ from 
the deceleration, possibly also from his head hitting the wall or 
cockpit surrounds, or from striking a wheel (etc.) at the moment of impact.

High speed accidents become survivable when speed is reduced rapidly 
but at a rate below human limits (thought to be around 40-45 g's), via 
sand traps, deformable barriers, destructable vehicles, stretchable 
seatbelts, and helmets that distribute impact force around the head.  
Hitting at shallow angles (approaching parallel to the wall) also 
aren't as bad, since the deadly component is *not* the car's forward 
speed, but its speed in the direction of the wall, which will be 
substantially less.

>> Someone who did a thorough inspection of the replays suggested that the

The wing looked attached OK prior to the collision, though the video 
was blurry as mentioned above.  It might have been loose enough to 
provide no downforce, but it was definitely at the front of the car and 
pointed correctly.

After the collision, pieces were everywhere.  Who can tell what hit his 
head?  IMHO, it's not fair for any amateur / announcer looking at 
crummy video to decide, and publish, statements which could easily be 
construed as facts.  I'm hoping that factual investigation and detailed 
analysis will give us an answer.  The phrase "probable suspension 
failure" sounds more authoritative than "possible suspension failure" 
or "I'm guessing it was suspension failure", etc.  Besides, hitting a 
wall at 186mph is enough right there to kill; an accelerated 10 lb (?) 
wing hitting a helmet is "in the noise" at that point!

Subject: Re: air filter

I was wondering if anyone uses their K&N in a CIS airbox with pop off 
valve?  My situation is that my pop off valve goes off every few days due 
to the cold start not hooked up.  On occasion it can also knock open the 
airbox.  I have dents in my paper filter from the pop off valve, and 
would want to make sure that the K&N "gives" rather than possibly 
damaging the pop off valve.

Also, more air doesn't equal more power.  You can drive a 911 without an 
air filter and without the air box attached, and you're not necessarily 
going to get more power.

I would be interested in prices and souces of aluminum air boxes.  The 
plastic one seems chintzy, especially the way the two straps attach the 
cover.

Same problem here in my '87 944S.  Pos 4 works all the time but sometimes
it stops in pos 1,2, and 3.  If I have the A/C on in pos 4 (to cool the
car) and then turn to 3, fan stops.  Back to pos 4, fan is on full. I've done
two things to get it working. One is, turn A/C off, turn fan off, then
turn fan on to pos 1,2, or 3, then turn A/C on.  It will continue to
run ok in that fan pos.  I've also had some luck, rotating the fan speed
switch rapidly back and forth. I've also noted the voltmeter drop ever
so slightly when I rotate the switch, so there's voltage going somewhere.
I haven't been able to consistently reproduce the problem to debug it.

Subject: 944 and 944S

Hello,
 I'm new to Porsche-dome, so to speak, and I have some questions.  I don't 
know alot about these machines yet, but my friend has given me the bug.  I 
can't get them off my mind.
 So, I've started looking for a late '80s 944 and I came across an '87 944S 
with 130,000Km (~78-80,000mi) on it.  With this find comes some questions...

1) 944S is a 16 valve, DOHC version of 944, right?  What are the other 
differences?

2) Does this model have any ugly bugs that I should know about?  Do ANY of 
the late '80s 944s or 944Ss have any ugly bugs I should know about?  Any 
specifics I should have a mechanic look for before buying?

 The price is pretty low from what I've been seeing on the market around 
here, so I'm a little suspicious.  Could someone tell me whether this model 
is worth getting involved with and if it is, what some of the warning signs 
might be?

OK, part 2.
 
 Aforementioned friend has an '83 944 and would like any comments from your 
net-wisdom on:

 1) Autothority power chip.
 2) Bursch headers.
 3) Cam re-grinds.

Thanx in advance for your time...

I believe this has to do with European/German regulations about parking your
car ot the curb and leaving your parking lights on on the side of the car
toward the road.  On my porsche, I believe that the turn signal selects
which side of the car the parking lights stay on.

I competed in my first autocross two weekends ago and thought it was

them off later that day.  I thought it might appear that my car had been
in an impound lot!

My best time was 56s and that was on the first run.  I guess I was trying
too hard on subsequent runs and overdrove it.  The low time for my
class (C Stock, this was an SCCA event) was 52s, so I was not too far
off of the pace.  The first thing that I am going to have to work on, besides
my driving, is setting the tire pressure.  Apparently I was pushing
(understeer) because of insufficient pressure in the front tires which was
producing sidewall rollover.  Gosh, there is a lot to learn!  Time to get a
good tire pressure gauge.  Any recommendations?

Your mentioning the FQS rings a bell.  I will have to look through the service
manual and the Bosch Motronic technical handbook to see if I can figure
out how to do this myself.  Any details that you could provide would
certainly be appreciated.

Does reprogramming the FQS require a new DME chip?

On a related note, I have been wondering how much of an asset
my PC programming experience would be in understanding the
DME.  I imagine some specialized equipement would be needed
to do any modifications (i.e. a logic analyzer, an EPROM burner, etc).

Subject: Turn signal lights

I don't have a true "fix" for the turn signal lights-on problem,
but described below is an enhancement that made it a non-issue for me.

My solution for the turn signal remaining on problem was to get a 
"Light Reminder" from K-MART and add a few sense diodes to make it detect
the different lights-remaining-on problems.  It cost ~$5.00 US.

The K-MART device has a beeper and a red LED.

I don't know if they still stock them.  Probably J.C. Whitney does.

The explanation below assumes not everyone has an electronics background,
read with this in mind.

The "Light Reminder" is a two lead device that is connected between the
headlight supply voltage and the ignition on supply voltage. 

When the car ignition is on and the lights are on, both "Light Reminder" leads 
are at 12 volts, since there is no potential difference the device doesn't beep
or the LED flash.   

If you turn the ignition off and leave the lights on, one light reminder
terminal is at +12 volts since it is connected to the lights and the other
terminal is connected to ground through the ignition coil/CDI/oil 
pressure light.

So the light reminder senses "Lights on" AND "ignition off".

It will beep (for ~10 seconds) and flash the LED (continuously).

If the lights are off and the ignition is on, the "Light Reminder"
sees 12 volts but inverted from the previous sense, and it doesn't beep/flash.

You could use several "Light Reminders" to monitor each condition but
I wanted one "Light Reminder" to sense if I left the 911 turn signal in left
or right mode, the parking lights on or the headlights on.

The "Light Reminder" can sense the different lighting circuits with 
some diode logic.   Any 100V, 0.5A diode is adequate, the popular 1N4004 at 
400V and 1A is fine. 

The diodes isolate each lighting circuit from the others, so one circuit
will not feed the others unintentionally.

                                              |
        to ignition on ------------------------


The 911 fuse box has convenient screw terminals, one wire was run from
the passenger compartment to the 4 diodes which terminated at the screw
terminal box.

The Light Reminder was mounted under the dash and was connected to
the "ignition-on" wire.

I installed this on my 1972 911T, 1969T and even my 71 VW bus, ~3 years ago.
I haven't accidentally left the lights on since.

It preserves the "leave the lights on one side" mode but warns you
it is happening. 

A 12V buzzer could be used in place of the light minder if a continuous
beep was O.K.   If the buzzer is not polarity sensitive, and 
the multiple diode logic assembly is not used, at least one diode must be 
in series, otherwise the buzzer will buzz with both lights on-ignition off 
and also in the "lights off-ignition on" normal daylight driving case.

Subject: C2 vs. C4


I have the 1990 C4 that was used in the auto-x school.  I heard that in the 
hands of a race driver, the C4 is at a disadvantage in handling to the C2.  I 
also heard the same thing about the ABS system.  I assume the driver can't 
get the car to do certain things that a race driver would want out of a race 
car.  The C4 also weighs more than the C2.

After using my car in the auto-x school, I no longer think the C4 was at that 
much of a disadvantage.  I liked how it handled there and I really think that 
it is a lot harder to spin out in a C4 vs. the C2.  I don't have any 
experience on the C2 but my instructor has a Carrera and he drove a C4 at the 
school where he said that he couldn't get the "tail" of the C4 to "push" out 
like he normally does with his own 911.  Also at the slalom portion of the 
course where he would normally "feather" the gas and control the car from 
spinning out, he suggested that with my C4 I should just gas it on through.  
I don't know if these comments are complimentary or critical, but you do have 
to drive the C4 differently than a C2 to get the most performance.
             
I do know that the 89 & 90 C2/4 had a problem with the factory alarm system.  
If you took your radio out (which is connected to the car alarm) the alarm 
will not sound nor will the lights flash.  It just seems normal, but in 
reality your alarm is going off without the visual and audio warnings.  The 
next day, your battery will be dead!  I understand the factory corrected this 
problem for latter years.

Milo, I remember that turn.  I think the flagger was safe from you.  I was in 
my instructor's car at that turn in front of the trailer where we did a 360 
on his pratice run--just before crossing the timer.  What was funny, he 
didn't hit any cones on that 360 and proceeded to his timed run.  All I could 
remember was holding on, smelling the rubber from the screaching tires and 
dirt being throwned into the car during the spin.  I still learned something 
from that run--I could still go faster in my own car on that turn, since I 
couldn't approach his speed at that point anyway.  I didn't have the same 
concern you had, all I could do was keep my eyes on the track and look for 
the apex.  I barely noticed the flag whenever I passed the flagger.

I've never had so much runs pushing my car to the limit before.  The $98 
bucks was cheap, concerning the amount of track time we had.  Nothing like 
knowing the limits of your car before you really need it on the streets.

There is another Zone 7 auto-x school in August at Candlestick again if 
anybody is interested.  Maybe the wind won't be as bad during the summer 
there.  
                                                         
I was impressed by how well organized the event was.  It was so organized, 
that we were able to get more runs than I thought possible.  The school is 
where you get two full days of driving vs. about 5 minutes at an actual 
autocross, but then again you don't get a trophy at the school.

Just a coincedance I guess but I was working on my

I decided to change the speaker setup in the rear.
(under the hatch).  There was a set of 6x9 Pyle woofers
back there wich were just soso.  They where mounted into
plywood custom fited into the rear under the carpet ect..

I removed those 6x9 and the plywood and found some
new 1/5 in. plywood for the new SUBS.
I carefully crafted the new plywood so it fits
all the way across the back under the carpet
(it is split in 2 pieces because of wedge shape of compartment.

I installed the 2x100W Toshiba Amp in the spare tire well
(no heat buildup probs yet) 
I Installed the two eight 8 in. subs in the side pockets
and wired it up!  (line level and power lines installed
on previous hellish occasion)

Fired it up and tuned in the Techno Station WOW
How did I live without SUBS!  What a Whimpy system 
I had without Them!!

I think The Tubes would be a good alternative to
if you dont have a jigsaw or bandsaw, but I love
making things! (

Maby I could make some of the plywood boards for sell
if there is an interest.

Note: the carpet over pockets had holes cut in them for
    6x9 so I had to buy some 'close match' US style

 Just a minor comment on active suspension:

I visited University of Cranfield (GB) during the water on runway trials for
our Saab 2000 aircraft. It turned out that they had been involved in the 
development of the active suspension for the Lotus F1. They told me that
it was very difficult to optimize this system, especially if you would
have it in a street car. The initial testing was made with a Lotus Esprit
(Turbo?) and it was indeed interesting to see the same car with "normal"
suspension in that same turn. The car with the normal suspension "rolled"
significantly while the active suspension car didn't roll at all. 

If the active suspension quit to work the car was almost undrivable and could
be dangerous why it was difficult to add this feature to a production street
car.

Does anyone know if any car is sold with active suspension today?

  He wants $18.5k, which is a rather cheap; I'm guessing he didn't
  pay that much for it.
  Should I stay away from this car? Otherwise, it sounds like it
  could be in very good shape.
 
A nine year old 911 that was repainted is not all that strange.  A good
friend has a body shop that does alot of Porsche restoration work and it
usually has at least one in for a repaint to get rid of assorted stone
chips, dings, etc.  I am always amazed at how many will get a full repaint
rather than just the panel but they want to be sure that everything matches.
Assuming the re-paint was done right, treat it as a plus.  Any good shop
should be able to check the car out to insure it is as advertised.

My amateur guess is mechanical failure, and the sudden change of

Hello, 
Do you have more info about Glockler Porsches? (I'm lookin' for articles
about them, maybe survival cars, photos etc.)
"One of the more succesful European racing machines of the early 1950's
was the Glockler Porsche, introduced by German race car designer/ driver
Walter Glockler (pronounced Gluckler)). Built in both rear- and mid-engi-
ned versions, the aluminium-bodied Glocklers were succesful not only on
the track, but also in influencing Porsche's ... 550 series..." said
an American non-Porsche book.
I took a picture about one at a show which were held before the Frankfurt
Motor Show and I knew about a Glockler-influenced American kitcar called
the Mrozer Spyder.
If anybody has info about either Glockler or the Mrozer please let me know.

Dear Len:





           You, sir, have a 356/912 Style Linkage-U Joint- congratulations!
They last a loooong time, until their plastic bushings fail, then the
shifter play becomes a sight to behold (brings a new dimension to the word
"loose"), with the possible loss of a set of gears (like third and fourth),
as happened just this weekend to a guy who had just bought an Original
California 1964 356C and was about to drive it back to Taxachusetts when he
suddenly found himself without third and fourth gear. Realizing that it
would be a Drag to drive 'cross country in a 356 in First and Second, he
called me at (408) 727-1864, and through the miracle of telephonic
problem-solving I was able to diagnose his problem and provide him with
another U-joint (exchange).

    Now, first of all- there SHOULD be some play- oh, 1/8" gap or so but
only in the fore-aft direction- that is for taking up positioning errors and
is Perfectly Normal.

     Second, the "repair" of the U-joint is best left to a machine shop that
knows how. The steel "T" must be pressed apart without damaging the aluminum
yoke.  Then the plastic bushings must be installed in the eyes of the yoke
(and just try this without a few Special Tools),  and then the steel "T"
piece must be pressed back together without damaging anything (again, just
try this without Special Tools and see what happens! That's why there are so
many broken yokes stuffed with pieces of rubber tire.)  

   I save up the bushingless U-Joints, and then we spend an afternoon
rebuilding a bunch at a time. Much more efficient that way- and Time is such
that ifin your 911 is more than 20 years old and its U-joint hasn't failed
yet- just wait a few months (or years),  and they will!

      So,  ifin you someday suddenly notice TREMENDOUS "slop" in the
gearshifter, peel back that rubber protector in front of the trans, and
watch the pieces of plastic bushing fall out of the rubber protector! The
pieces were the plastic bushings. 

    One-half inch slop in the gearshifter isn't Tremendous slop. You'll know
Tremendous slop when it happens- guaranteed!  More likely, you  might have a
failed bushing under the gearshifter in the little "cup". They're almost
always bad, but they never seem to improve the shifter action much after
replacement. The results of replacing a bad U-joint bushing, however WILL
surprise you! Happily so!

    Should you have to replace the U-joint, no drift is needed, just remove
the safety wire around the square bolt with the conical end and remove the
square, conical bolt. (it DOES have safety wire through it doesn't it? You
WILL replace the safety wire afterwards, won't you? If not, the conical
bolts comes loose and you lose gears, and ultimately, you lose the square
conical bolt- which mean that you LOSE! As it's the ONLY SQUARE CONICAL BOLT
in the whole car! And damn hard to find when you need one. Don't ask me how
I know.

     Then, loosen the pinch bolt at the U-joint/long-linkage-rod-interface
and the U-joint can usually be coaxed out. Don't let a drift or a hammer
near the damn thing.

   Oh, and One More Thing in this single-spaced comment- make sure you
scribe a MARK on the U-joint where the linkage rod fits over it, at the
pinch bolt and through one of the "flutes" of the linkage rod, and remember
which flute you used!  That way, you, like the guy this weekend, might just
get all the gears back, First Try, upon reconnection, without spending many
happy hours using Trial & Error techniques attempting to get Reverse or 4th
to make its appearance from the ether!

     And should you ever find yourself trying to find just such a "missing"
gear, don't forget that the linkage rod moves in the OPPOSITE direction to
the gearshift lever because it's on the other side of the fulcrum, so if the
gearshifter needs to go more "forward", you gotta get the shifter at the
U-joint to go more "rearward"! Don't ask me how I know all this.



      Don't mess with the U-joint unless you have too!  And:



      KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!

fan speed numbers was not sufficient to overcome the high resistance
between the brushes and the commutators.  The solution was to take the

Porsche Friends:
	The following is a summary of responses to my question on 911/914
shift linkage play question.

Subject: '84 Carrera, 28K Miles (for comparison reasons...)
Diagnostic: About 1/2" play on stickshift when in gear forward/backward
Question: Is this normal?
Mechanical check: Shift coupler connecting gear lever to trans has a plastic
	bushing. Noticed play of about 2mm total. 

Summary of responses:

A play of about 1/2" is both normal and needed. Keeps the car in gear while
engine moves around in mounts, and reduces shifter rattles.

Failure mode presents itself as TREMENDOUS "slop" in the gearshifter with
the innability to get car into 3/4 gears.

Most likely culprits for linkage play are shift lever bushings under gearshift
lever. They are cheap and fairly easy to replace. Four screws hold the shifter
assembly to the floor.

For those that need to replace the bushing in the shift coupler, they are 
available as replacement parts from mail order suppliers (Automotion, 
AJR Racing, Stoddard, etc.) The coupler shaft can be driven out with a 
drift to get to the bushings.

Warning: Adjusting the shift linkage after removal of the shift
coupler might be tricky. Might pay to mark alignment befor removal...

So there you have it folks! I hope that this is both useful and informative.

Another way the clutch cable can go on a 914 is at the back end, where you
have that 2" roller on which the cable does a U-turn.  There is a rubber boot
right before that to minimize the amount of the cable exposed, but if it is
in bad shape or falls off, the grease usually on the cable and roller will
capture dirt and pebbles.  These will eventually grind through it.

well, assuming I understand your definition of the problem, I have had about
the same thing.  I didn't really try to fix it, it happened by accident while
messing around with the system.  The pressure sensor on some 914's has epoxy
over the end plug, and some don't.  My current car didn't, so I took the
plug out, and there's an adjustment screw in there.  Turning it too far one
way seemed to have the effect of having to push the throttle a good distance
before the engine would accelerate the car.  Turning it too far the other
way would make the car buck as you describe.  It's most drivable set just
barely away from where it's bucking.

Of course this is all assuming that you have a working throttle position
sensor, are you aware that you can take the black cover off the switch
without removing it from the car?  

YMMV, I'm not sure whether what I did covered up some other minor problem,
or if it compensated for the engine's high mileage.

Hi,
Well this past weekend I bought an 83 944 to complement my '77 911.  Since
the 944 will be used as a daily driver, I wanted to start looking for an
extra set of wheels so I can have one set for Winter.  Currently  the car
has the std. 7x15 cookie cutters.  I believe the offset on the wheels
was changed in '87 (correct me if I'm wrong), but what is the proper offset
for the earlier 944's.  Did porsche ever make 16" Phone Dials to fit these 
cars ('86 951?)?  I want to go to 16" and keep the cookie cutters for
Winter. And what is recommended - 16x7 & 16x8's, or 16x7 all around?  
Will the 16" Fuchs from an early 911 fit?  I would prefer phone dials
because of cost.  Sorry I have so many questions, but I'm new to 944's 
(I've had my 911 for 9 years now).  One other thing, what is the preferred
repair manual (other than the factory) for this car.  I have Bentley manuals
for my wife's 528e BMW and my 86 GTI and love them.  I've seen the Haynes
advertised, but I hope it's better than the 911 manual they have.  (I have
the factory manuals for my 911).

I forgot to mention something in my posting 5 minutes ago.  Fan speed 4 
bypasses the dropping resistor bank entirely, which is why it works 
even when speeds 0-3 might not.

Also, the switch itself, or related wiring, could be getting 
dirty/defective.  Personally, my first area to attack would be the 
resistor bank.  Mine had this identical problem when it was new.

Subject: supercharging


I have gotten a number of inquiries about supercharging since I left
a note stating my experience with having my '87 911 supercharged.
I thought it more appropriate to answer them all at one time, just in
case someone else has the same questions and doesn't feel 
comfortable asking.
 
First, I must correct the comment about a record at Road Atlanta. 
I apparently misunderstood Tommy Vann, at German Auto, talking
about his supercharged 911's having really fast times at Road Atlanta. 
I thought he was talking about record times - the mistake was mine, 
not his.
 
Second, the cost to supercharge your 911 depends on which model 
you have. 
 
If you have an SC or a Carrera, the cost for the kit is $4,495. Tommy
 says that it takes him 25 hours to install the supercharger, and he
 charges $45 per hour. That means you would have to spend another
 $1,125 to have them install it, for a grand total of expense of $5,620. 
You do have the option of doing it yourself or getting someone else to
 install it for you.  
 
If you have a C2 or a C4 the cost goes up to $13,000. ( I don't know if 
that is the kit alone or the kit plus installation - you would need to call
about that.)  According to Tommy, they use the wipple supercharger
on those cars,  versus the paxton on the SC and Carrera, and much
much more work has to be done.
 
Third, for the SC and Carrera there are no internal engine
modifications needed. Some things in the engine compartment have
to be moved around, a new chip is put in the Carreras and a new
ignition system is put in the SCs, but that is aboutit.
 
Fourth, when I talked to Tommy today to get my facts straight, 
he said if anyone is interested in more details, he can be reached at
(615) 691-1541. This is a direct line to his office; the number I left in the
last message was to German Auto, which then must direct the call to
him. He would rather you just call him directly.
 
Fifth, Tommy is just getting on American Online and I hope to soon
have himJjoin the Porschephiles group so he can answer your
questions directly. 
 
Finally, I am not connected with German Auto; I am just a very
satisfied customer. I just love the 911 and am thrilled with the extra
power I now have.  If it has given me so much satisfaction, I assume
that other people may be interested too. If I can answer anymore
questions, please drop me a note, or ifany of you get to Western North
Carolina and want to see my car, let me know.

There's a dropping resistor bank with thermal circuit breakers under 
the wiper area cover.  Most likely you've got an "open" on one of the contacts.

Pull the plastic cover, find the bank, and clean the contacts.  Check 
for connection integrity.  This should fix the problem.

Oh yes, this should excite the purists.

I'm considering converting a worn-out stock MFI system on a '72 911S
to a full-featured Electronic ignition and injection management
system, probably using a system available from Motec.  Briefly, this
would involve adding sensors to the engine (crank timing,
temperatures, air mass and temp, etc) adding electronic injectors and
removing the distributor to replace it with a direct-fire ignition.
The electronics part is not a problem for me, but I am concerned
about (1) placement of the injectors, and (2) suitability of the
stock cam for such a set-up.  I *hope* that the electronic injectors
would be well-located in the old MFI positions, and that the MFI cam
is just a suitable for EFI.

So, does anyone have any experience on such a project, or even some
constructive comments?  Many of you have far more 2.4L MFI experience
than I do.  Thanks in advance.

that you should always fill up to the maximum pressure rating provided
by the tire manufacturer.  (I know, consider the source, right?)  The
story is that the car builder has different concerns than the tire
builder, like "softer ride" or "less noise," and the tire maker knows
at which pressure the tire performs best.  I'm just curious whether
anyone else has heard this story, and whether there's anything to it.

Subject:  Ed's request for comments

    Ed-

    Several years ago, when Porsche was doing so well on most of the
    racing circuits of the world, the sanctioning bodies decided to
    change the rules (presumably to foster competition).  After
    contending with mid-stream rule changes so many times, Porsche
    finally decided that its racing budget could no longer handle
    having to re-tool each time it got competitive.  Eventually
    Porsche was out of racing because of the
    sanctioning bodies' god playing.

    Like Porsche, Senna too is out of racing because of an
    organization that is a victim  of lobbyists
    (why the teams don't just spend the
    money on engineering instead of lobbying is probably because a
    rule change is cheaper to buy than a team of top-notch designers).

    Some of you may take exception to my comments that Senna's death
    was caused by the rule changes (or even that Porsche's absence
    from the racing world in the form of a works team was due to
    the rule changes).  Fine, I will admit
    that it is in part speculation.  But, give me a break, F1 and Indy
    car racing is not historic racing: it is the cutting edge of the
    technology, and as such it is intended to evolve.  If a company is
    not competive in either manufacturing or designing a race car for
    Indy or F1, then take your car to another series.  Lets reserve at
    least some series for the best drivers, cars, crews, and
    technology-  after all, how are we going to make progress in
    the industry without such a venue?

    With each F1 team worth several (or is that many?) millions of
    dollars a year, a limit on technology is not going to make a
    significant reduction in the cost of competing (Gee, now that
    active suspension is outlawed in F1, I think I'll take a second
    out on my house, put a team together, and join the circuit!!!-  IN
    MY DREAMS).  But seriously, even with a reduction in technology
    necessary to compete, the teams with the most money are still
    going to win- it has proven itself over and over again.  So, the
    ones that end up with the short end of the stick are the Sennas
    the Porsches, and of course the industry (and ultimately the
    consumer, who won't see the technology on the market -- ABS
    anyone?).

    In closing, I too would like to express my grief over the loss of
    a great man and a great competitor.  Senna touched the lives of
    many fans (me included) with a tenacious dedication and
    brilliant expertise -- characteristics we all can use
    in our everyday lives.  And throughout he remained a decent,
    caring man.  He will be missed.

Subject: Brazilian story on Senna's Accident

Reprinted without permission.

Brazilians Furious Over GP Safety

SAO PAULO--Ayrton Senna's brother hit out at safety levels in Formula One
n Wednesday and angrily accused the sport of being obsessed with money.
Leonardo Senna accused the sport's officials of skimping on safety after
his brother was killed during Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix when he crashed
into a concrete wall at high speed.

"If there had been some kind of protection, maybe tires or something, Ayrton
would be alive and intact today," he told reporters, his voice trembling with
emotion.  "Unfortunately, in Formula One, all people think about is money."
Brazilian grief over the accident has been accompanied throughout by a
sentiment of anger. The press has been bitterly critical of Formula One
directors over what it sees as a lack of safety in the sport. On Wednesday,
as Senna's coffin arrived in Sao Paulo, banners with messages such as
"Goodbye Senna," "Senna will be in our hearts forever," and "Senna has
stepped up onto the highest podium of all," were mixed with ones of protest.

One group of fans outside the building where Senna's body was lying in state,
chanted: "We want justice, we want justice. They killed Senna." Senna's coffin
arrived in Sao Paulo at dawn on Wednesday on a flight from Paris. Draped in a
Brazilian flag, it was taken on top of a fire engine to the Sao Paulo
legislative assembly where it was lying in state until Thursday morning's
funeral. Thousands of people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects.
The first in the queue had been waiting since early on Tuesday. Around 70
people were reported to have been treated by ambulance staff after having been
overcome with emotion. The motorcade which accompanied the fire engine on the
mile journey from the airport brought Sao Paulo's traffic to a near standstill.
Crowds lined the streets, packed the bridges over the route and threw ticker tape
at the coffin. Government offices and schools in Sao Paulo shut. Senna's death
has stunned Brazil, where his triumphs on the racetrack were deeply cherished
by people who, in nation suffering  rampant inflation, urban violence and
corruption scandals, often have little to smile about.

Subject: Re:  tire pressures

Kari asks:
>...'how come the recommended (manual) tire pressures are uneven at 2/2.5
bar (29/36 psi)?'...<

Barney sez:
The lower front tire pressure is designed to produce understeer or the
tendency of the car to continue in a straight line even though the front
wheels are turned.  Most drivers, when entering a corner at speed, will
tend to lift off of the throttle.  In cars with a 50/50 or greater weight
bias toward the rear, this lifting will cause the rear end of the car to
swing out in the direction opposite the turn, or to oversteer.  The tire
pressure induced understeer helps cancel out the driver induced oversteer
and is mandated into all cars by D.O.T. safety regulations.

At an autocross event or at the track, most P* car drivers will inflate the
front and rear tires to the same, or very nearly the same, pressures.  They
do this because: a) They have learned not to lift in a corner, and, b) They
want to be in charge of the cars behavior and not have it influenced by
some outside factor.

In daily life, things are not so simple.  Driving around on short sidewall
front tires that are inflated to 36 pounds is hard on your car.  On my
daily driver (Carrera) I worked out a compromise.  I increased the front
pressure 2 pounds and lowered the rear pressure by 2 pounds.  This had the
dual effect of giving me a fairly netural handeling car and has decreased
the center of the tire wear on the rear.

I have a K&N in mine, but also have one of the aluminum (newer style than
original stainless steel box) airboxes with a built in metal popoff valve,
so I doubt that the filter could damage it.  I do seem to remember some
mild 'dents' in the air filter, but I'm not sure if that's from the valve
itself or the blowback.

Without an air box attached, you wouldn't get much at all in a
fuel-injected car.  In cars that might be running a little richer than
stock (!!!), the extra air would be useful.  Improved airflow is generally
a plus, though not always.  Wish somebody had those stats on K&N
improvements...

> I would be interested in prices and souces of aluminum air boxes.  The

I heard a nasty rumor that the guy who designed and manufactured those
airboxes died, and his sons decided to discontinue the business or
somesuch.  I have seen one of the original stainless airboxes at a swap
meet, and boy was it an ugly, kludgey looking thing.  Also, the guy wanted
something like twice the original price for it.  The OEM boxes are chintzy,
but the popoff valve seems to do a pretty good job of protecting them.  I
like my version of the aluminum one.  It looks stock, even in the black
color, and the popoff valve inside looks to be of industrial quality.  I
also heard the original stainless boxes had fit and finish problems and
were not entirely airtight (? anybody know for sure ?).  I think the
dimensions were not stock, and thus they will not work in 914 -> 914/6
conversions.  This from somebody who was looking to do that (not me).

    I had a similar problem in my 2.0L 914.  The problem turned out to 
be in the intermittent relay that controls all the flashing lights in
the car.  There are several on/off gizmos inside the one plastic box,
and so what happens to one part doesn't necessarily reflect what's going
on in another part.
    In the 914, the relay was up above the fuse box above the driver's
knees.  Two screws, and yank the relay; new (used) relay; and all's fine!

Bushings are available thru Automotion (at least). Old catalog pg. 168.
 Theory of not transmitting
vibration suits me.  I would surmise that the wear along the horizontal
surfaces would be the area of
concern more so that the fore/aft (it's an ellipse (sort of) shape when new,
anyway).  The more significant
bushing is the nylon cup at the base of the shift lever that *does*

Subject: Re: Porschephiles in Autoweek

Sarah Sprafka writes about being dissappointed  with the AutoWeek article on
PCA Club Racing.

As a PCA Club Racer who has attended 4 races including the "First Ever" race
in Denver, let me tell you about PCA Club Racing.  The program is designed to
let you enjoy the competition of "real" wheel-to-wheel racing without the
fear of undue risk to yourself or your car.  The key is an attitude
adjustment by the participants.  As a driver, you need to be willing to
"share" the track with the other racers, to give them the corner if they make
a move to inside in a turn.  Most participants get their reward from just
being in the race, not from any trophy or finishing position.  

Since the event sizes are small (40-100 drivers), there are typically several
classes running in a single race.  For most drivers, this means your race is
with the car in front of you, and the one behind you.  So what class you car
is in, really doesn't matter once the green flag drops.

But, the Club Racing Rule Book does divide the cars into 8 "stocks" classes
(E1-K), and 4 "super" classes for modified or race cars.  

The stock classes allow any springs, sway bars, 1" wider than stock wheels. 
DME Chips, brakes and ignition must be stock, transmission ratios unchanged,
and tires must be within 3% of the rolling diameter of the stock tires.  If
the car has a different DME  chip, non-stock brakes, or different gear
ratios, then it runs one class higher.  All stock class cars must run on DOT
tires with a minimum of 2/32" tread.

The super classes are divided by displacement, and have sub-classes for race
tires (and/or chassis reinforcement) or street tires.  (Class A has 4
subclasses for Turbo w/race tires/chassis stiffening, Non-turbo w/race
tires/chassis stiffening, and turbo/non-turbo on street tires).  Cars in
these classes must use Porsche built chassis, engines & gearboxes. 
Everything else is free.

I would estimate that 30-40% of the cars are non-street legal race cars
running in the super classes.  More than half of the cars are normal street
cars with roll cages, fire extinguishers, windows nets, racing seats, 5 point
harnesses and cut-off switches (these being the bulk of the safety
requirements).

Some of the fast-guys are really fast (Martin Snow's 911 Turbo for example),
Ron Mistak's 914-6, and we've seen a few 3.8 RSR's.  Next are the SCCA
prepared GT-1/2/3, 914-6 and 911's.
Keeping up with these cars are the big-engined light cars (3.2L 73 911's with
RS flares, etc), well prepared RS Americas (see Monte's Smith's RS and Mike
Doolin's RS shown in the AW article).

Here is the top-10 finishing order (with fast lap times) from the fast group
at the Las Vegas race:
Martin Show     911 Turbo   (A1) 00:57.095 (100.844 mph)
Ron Mistak      914-6 2.8   (B1) 01:00.161 (95.743 mph)
Richard Raimist 911 3.8 RSR (A2) 01:01.030 (94.380 mph)
Monte Smith     911 RSA     (A4) 01:02.457 (92.223 mph)
Rick Ollila     911 3.6     (A2) 01:02.515 (92.138 mph)
Chick Misura    914-6 2.8   (B1) 01:02.015 (92.881 mph)
Marvin Epps     914-6       (B1) 01:02.737 (91.812 mph)
Mark Mehilic    911 RSA     (A2) 01:03.659 (90.482 mph)
Chris Fisher    930         (A1) 01:05.040 (88.561 mph)
Henry Schmidt   914-6       (B1) 01:03.658 (90.484 mph)
(Don't ask, I was ahead of Chick Misura/Mark Mehilic when I DNF'ed....)
   
Ellen and I will be going to the Club Race at Hallett, OK in 3 weeks, and
returning to Second Creek in Denver, CO in June.  Any other club racers at

Active Ride Suspension is a computer controlled, springless system. The 
system constantly adjusts the suspension arms to maintain the ride height of 
the vehicle and compensate for the weight transfer as it brakes, accelerates 
and corners. Therefore the car does not dip as it brakes or leans as it 
corners. the intent is to maintain maximum adhesion on all four wheels at 
all times.

An electronic throttle is what it says, it does not rely on mechanical

The spectacular crash and death of A Senna came as a shock to many

new regulations that banned active suspensions, traction control and
electronic accelerators,' Formula One reporter Castilho de Andrade said..."

I am a mechanical novice (is there a lower category?) so pitch any answers
to my level - -
What actually IS an "active suspension"?
I think I know what traction control is (sort-a-like ABS for pulling not
just braking?) but what is an "electronic accelerator"? Sounds like Formula
One is closer to virtual reality and Senna should be alive with his video
helmet on!

Active suspension is a concept invented by Lotus ? (I think..), all it means
is
that the suspension system is 'smart' in that it stiffens the side the load
is
on though the turn...ie, on a left hand turn, the right side suspension
stiffens
up.

I couldn't agree more!!!!  Talk about a pain.  I am also a 914 racer and

always have to sit down and leverage the damn thing with your foot or legs

I can't see any racing advantage that occurs by changing to studs.  I just 
simply makes it easier on the pit crew.  (You know, us, the drivers at

I have a question about Comas.  If this has been answered already,
I am sorry for asking again, however, I haven't seen this addressed.

While the medical team was working on Senna, a car proceeded down the
track, well after the race was stopped.  First, Was this Comas, as
the commentators suggested.  Second, does anyone know why he was
on the track after the race was stopped?

As for this weekend's tragedies I can only say I wish we were all given
a better oppportunity to get to know Roland Ratzenberger as a Formula 1
driver.  As for the death of Aryton Senna, I may not have known him
personally, but I feel as though I have lost a friend; a friend whose
company I enjoyed on many spring and summer weekends.  Aryton, thank you
for sharing your skills and talent with all of us who will never forget
our appreciation and our admiration.

This was an extremely strange footnote to the incident.  On the
BBC coverage, an interview in the pits was happening.  I noticed
an engine start up in the background and thought....hmmmmm, what
the heck is that?  All of a sudden, you can hear the driver tearing
out of the pits, and accelerating hard through the course.  On
replay, you can clearly hear him max out his revs as he starts
down the straight.  And then suddenly, he appears braking hard
right into the corner of the accident.  What the hell was going
on?  Why on earth was he on the track, and who let him out?
=========================
Maybe he and others wanted to check out Ayrton's condition and talked to
the marshalls. After all, he could talk back to the pits while on the
scene.
==========================
Comas' fastest lap of the race was the first, and I believe he dropped
out very early with handling problems.  I think he was in the pits at
the time of Senna's accident, and the team just were oblivious to what
had been happening, so when they made whatever change they wanted to
make, Comas sped onto the race track.

But surely the team would know what was happening, because they have
another car (umm, who is it?)...  Maybe they figured he could leave
the pits to make the lap and line up for the restart, not realizing
that the track was blocked.
========================================================================
French tv TF1 showed an enlarged view in slo-mo, where you
could barely make out something (debris?) that the car goes
over. Prost remarked that the corner had been resurfaced and
was bumpy and that if it was debris then Senna could have
just lost control completely.

Prost was also very vehement in his attack on F1 politics, saying
in a not-too-concealed way that a major problem was incompetent
people making rule changes without thinking about the possibly
affects on safety. Only money counts. He has called for an independent
committee to be set up to regulate safety in F1, the committee to
be made up of drivers (ex. and current) and engineers.

Prost went on to say how devasted he was by the events (he found it
very difficult to talk about Senna) and that although himself and
Senna were never friends, they always respected each other, and that
the "bad-blood" between them was exagerated by the press. In particular,
he added, Senna and himself had more recently begun to understand
each other. Before the race Senna sent a message via TF1 to Prost
saying "we miss you" and the morning of the race Prost met Senna to
wish him luck.

Prost concluded by saying that without Senna he himself would never
have become what he is.

The max pressure on the sidewall of a tire is used to establish the max
load a tire can carry.  Even my itty-bitty 185-60-14 Honda Civic tires
can carry about 1050 lb. each -- my car weighs about 2300 lb.
If I ran them at max pressure, I would likely end up wearing out the
centers of the tread more than the shoulders.  Go with the 
manufacturers recommendation -- AT FIRST.  After you start to wear your
tires somewhat, check them out.  If the shoulders are wearing more
than the center, increase the pressure a couple of psi.  If the centers
of the treads are wearing more quickly than the shoulders, decrease
the pressure.  A lot depends on your specific tires and the way you drive.

Now, this says nothing about inside shoulder vs. outside shoulder wear
difference.  That has more to do with your alignment and the way you
drive.

No.

The max pressure is just that: maximum cold pressure.  

As in "do not exceed."

Here's the static force ballance:

The flat area on the inside of the tire is going to equal the load on 
the tire divided by the tire pressure.  Increasing tire pressure will
thus reduce the contact patch on the ground.  However this is a gross
simplification.  Contrary to what one is taught in freshman physics, 
(see my book "The Coefficent of Friction and Other Lies") the area 
of the contact patch will affect the amount of lateral G the tire will
support (yes folks, it's official: size does matter :-O)

Generally speaking, the tire is going to perform best when the contact
patch is maximized.  The problem is how and when/where to maximize the 
contact patch.

Also generally speaking, if you run a tire at max press, you will 
notice that all the center tread is gone before the side tread (this
also happens with a wide tire that is underinflated).

To speak generally a bit more, I'm told that most cars will perform
better about 2psi higher than spec - better milage, traction, and 
tire life.  The ride will also be harder.  The spec is a compromise 
between comfort and performance.  Porsche may be an exception to 
this generality.

Now, if you were running 78 serries tires, they might perform best at 
the max pressure because the sidewall compliance is reduced, keeping 
the contact patch maximized in a hard turn.

With a normal aspect ratio tire (e.g. 50 serries ;-), you will get the 
best handling below max pressure.  At least this has been my experience.

For example, I tend to run the BFG comp TA-R1 at lower pressures than the
Yoko A008RS.  The BFG has a stiffer sidewall (and slightly better turn-
in) than does the Yoko and I think this is responsible for the lower 
pressure.  I think both are rated at 44psi.  I would run the bfg's in the
low 30's and the yoko's in the high 30's.

I generally set the (auto-x) pressure by marking the edge of the tread
and part of the sidewall before a run and checking how much the tire 
has rolled over during the run.


- --Soren

p.s. my favorite bit of tire trivia is this:

      At 125 mph a 24" dia. tire has a centripital acceleration of 
      1000 G's at the tread!

F1 engines during the turbo era produced well over 1000 HP, especially
in qualifying trim.  Current normally aspirated engines are somewhere
around 800 HP.  The speed advances have come from the other technologies,
i.e. aerodemonics, chassis design, etc.

Perhaps true, but consider that fast lap and qualifying records set last
year with active cars are being broken already with passive cars.  The
new Benetton is mighty quick.  And just wait until the Williams is
sorted out...

I think that Trond really hit on the point.  The problem is track safety.
The safest car can always be driven off the track at speed.  It is the
design of the sand traps and walls that determine if someone dies...

Watkins Glen, '92 (?) Tommy Kendall busts up his feet and Mc-somebody-or-
other dies in the Nascar race in the same summer.  They ended up building
a chicane at the end of a famous straight to make people go slower through
the turn.  Some think that it was a copout.  I think it was so they could
create another "Action point" and build another grand stand...

It's the same as the dangerous intersection in your town.  They only put
the traffic lights up after somebody dies.

F1 cars will continue to break track records, regardless of the limitations
put on them.  It may take a while, but they will.  F1 cars will figure
out how to live without "driver aids" -- Benetton already seems to be
pretty well hooked up.  And F1 cars will always crash.  Hopefully, the
safety features will be able to keep up with the progress.

As far as Senna, I really didn't like him, but I am really going to miss
watching him race, especially in the rain!

Race In Peace in that great 'Ring in the sky!

Lives in Scotts Valley (20 mins. south of San Jose on 17).

Concerns/Questions:
Forgot to ask about records/books.
Owner is a little fuzzy on facts (guessed that it had drum

I've always had trouble keeping my brakes cool. Currently, I run Motul

in Pano. Has anyone tried them (or any other wheel fans)? Do they work?

I've read that wheel fans are most useful for removing large amounts of 
hot air that is ducted to the brakes (like in a 935 or 962), but may 
not make much difference on a stock car (and mine has the rubber lip 
spoiler, which does reduce airflow under the car).

Subject: Expensive Rattling Noise?

You may recall my posting a couple of weeks ago about a noise 
my 1983 944 (with automatic transmission) was producing.  Well, 
the noise has become a regular occurrence and is no longer 
intermittent.  I brought it to Wiessach Performance, the place  
where I get most of my work done.  A total of three mechanics
went at the problem and I spent the entire day at the garage 
myself. At first, they thought it was a loose heat shield.  
There was also some speculation that it might be a burned out 
element in the catalytic converter or a loose oxygen sensor.

The symptoms -- the metallic rattling noise occurrs when the 
engine is in the range of 2800 to 3100 rpm under load.  The 
noise does not occur when there is no load on the engine (i.e. 
when the car is in neutral).  The pitch of the noise is fixed, 
regardless of engine speed or wheel speed.  The noise is most 
prnounced when accelerating hard from a standing start.  When 
the car is stationary the noise can be produced by putting it 
into gear, standing hard on the brakes, and applying power.  
However, the engine will not rev beyond about 2300 rpm under 
those circumstances and the noise that is produced does not 
have quite the same sound.  The noise does not occur when the 
car is cool, but it takes less than 30 minutes to warm the car 
up sufficiently to produce the noise.

Two of the mechanics took the car for a test drive.  One drove 
while the other hung out of the passenger side with the door 
open and his head near the ground, trying to isolate the 
noise.  Ater this, they concluded that the noise was coming from 
the mid-section of the car, behind the engine but ahead of the 
midpoint between the front and rear wheels.

We swapped my oxygen sensor out for a plug, but the rattling 
noise didn't go away.  So much for that.  The mechanics used a 
rubber mallet to whack away at the exhaust system, but they 
couldn't find anything loose.

After all that, they have come to the conclusion that the noise 
has to be coming from the transmission, specifically the bell 
housing area.  This diagnosis was reached because the noise 
only occurs under load.

Cost -- I am told that the worst case scenario is that 
the flex plate in the automatic transmission (the equivalent of 
a flywheel?) needs to be replaced, in which case I'll be 
looking at Can$2,100 plus tax.  At best, it could just be a 
loose bolt which won't cost me anything apart from labour for 
taking the transmission apart and putting it back together.  
That will still be Can$680 plus tax.

Questions -- This car is 11 years old.  It has been maintained 
well and only has about 50,000 miles on it.  What is the 
likelihood that there is a serious problem with the 
transmission?  ($2,100 to me is serious.  Shit, I'm not even 
happy about $680.)  Can I just live with the noise, and keep on 
driving the car?  In other words, is the noise the only thing 
I'll have to live with, or is the noise an strong indicator 
that if I keep driving something really bad will happen to me?  
If I drive the car until it really breaks, how long have I got 
and will it cost any more to fix at that point than if I pay 
the mechanics to go into the car now?

One last question -- can I get into this part of the car 
myself?  It seems that labour is a huge portion of the cost, 
and if I could work on it myself, I could save a lot.  I am far 
from an expert on these things.  I've got my Haynes, but that's 
about it.  I can do routine things but I've never done anything 
major in a car.  However, I am pretty good at reading instructions and 
then translating that into actually doing it.

Any and all comments are very welcome.  The car will be going 
into the garage on Monday if I don't hear to the contrary, so 
if you have any input, I would be grateful if you would send it 
to me direct before then.  (I'm on the digest.)  Thanks to 
everyone in advance...

Brazilians Furious Over GP Safety

SAO PAULO--Ayrton Senna's brother hit out at safety levels in Formula One
n Wednesday and angrily accused the sport of being obsessed with money.
Leonardo Senna accused the sport's officials of skimping on safety after
his brother was killed during Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix when he crashed
into a concrete wall at high speed.

"If there had been some kind of protection, maybe tires or something, Ayrton
would be alive and intact today," he told reporters, his voice trembling 
with
emotion.  "Unfortunately, in Formula One, all people think about is money."
Brazilian grief over the accident has been accompanied throughout by a
sentiment of anger. The press has been bitterly critical of Formula One
directors over what it sees as a lack of safety in the sport. On Wednesday,
as Senna's coffin arrived in Sao Paulo, banners with messages such as
"Goodbye Senna," "Senna will be in our hearts forever," and "Senna has
stepped up onto the highest podium of all," were mixed with ones of protest.

One group of fans outside the building where Senna's body was lying in 
state,
chanted: "We want justice, we want justice. They killed Senna." Senna's 
coffin
arrived in Sao Paulo at dawn on Wednesday on a flight from Paris. Draped in 
a
Brazilian flag, it was taken on top of a fire engine to the Sao Paulo
legislative assembly where it was lying in state until Thursday morning's
funeral. Thousands of people filed past the coffin to pay their last 
respects.
The first in the queue had been waiting since early on Tuesday. Around 70
people were reported to have been treated by ambulance staff after having 
been
overcome with emotion. The motorcade which accompanied the fire engine on 
the
mile journey from the airport brought Sao Paulo's traffic to a near
standstill.
Crowds lined the streets, packed the bridges over the route and threw ticker
tape
at the coffin. Government offices and schools in Sao Paulo shut. Senna's 
death
has stunned Brazil, where his triumphs on the racetrack were deeply 
cherished
by people who, in nation suffering  rampant inflation, urban violence and
corruption scandals, often have little to smile about.

The above has always been the conventional wisdom, and sounds quite
logical: overinflated tires wear more quickly in the center.  I have been
informed by my very well respected mechanic that this is no longer the
case.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.  I do not recall the reasons,
whether they were related to modern tire design or 911's in specific
(the former, I think), but he was quite adamant about this.  Has anyone
got further info?

At the speed that Senna hit, tires would do no good, unless they were around
20 rows deep -- and then there would be the risk of those same tires doing
the killing.  Tire walls are great only for lower speed contact.

As far as risk, it is true that Senna realized them and was well paid.  But
does that mean that we should just pay people to take risks or should we
devote more resources to advance track safety technology?

I have them on my 951, along with thermocouples on the brake pad backing plate.

I think a number of the electrical contacts (switches, etc) are
prone to oxidation and other "dirtiness" causing them to flake out.
I had problems (as a number of other posters have noted) with the
944 sunroof microswitch. Spraying Radio Shack switch-contact cleaner/lubricant
cured the flakyness of the sunroof. Perhaps the fan switch could also be
prone to dirtiness/oxidation as well.

 This is *bad*!  Yes, from the description they are synchro teeth, probably
from either 1st or 2nd gear.  In P-car trannies there is a ring that slides
to connect the shaft and cluster gears with a friction collar to match the
speeds of the two (that's the synchro part).  If the speeds don't match, you
can lose teeth from the cluster gear (these are really engagement teeth, not
the ones that provide the ratio.  There are only about 50 or so of these per
gear and when some leave, there is much more strain on the remaining ones. 
This leads to a progressive 'decay' that can result in eventually losing a
whole gear.

 One thing to check once the car gets rolling (unless you do a teardown of
the box first) is whether the shifter "wobbles" when you have engaged a
particular gear.  This is a sign that more than a few teeth are missing.

    If you *do* this sort of change, make sure it's done *right*!!!!  The
standard Bug kits out there are *NOT* good enough!  Trust me, I'm looking
at some serious bucks because of one.
    Item one:  The studs are *NOT* long enough in the rear for (at least)
the Fuchs alloys and their look-alikes.  Insufficient engagement = very
very very unsafe.
    Item two:  The studs do *NOT* have sufficient engagement in the hub.
I was re-torquing the nuts on my 1.8L, when OOPS!  Stripped one, and
noticed (for the first time) that the engagement is only about 75% of a
full stud diameter.  THIS IS NOT SAFE!  Now I'm looking at having one
of my huds either Time-Serted or replaced (!!!!) and I need to go out
and buy the *real* lug bolts.  Sigh.  Anyone wanna buy this car?
    Forgive me for being so emphatic, but it's something that just bit
me in the ass, real hard!  If you *do* go this route, make sure that 
the lugs have an adequate strength and hardness, and that *everything*
has *at least* 1 full diameter's worth of engagement!

    The TPS basically has three positions--Wide Open Throttle, Fully Closed
Throttle, or Somewhere In Between.  It's actually just two switches.  Since
this is happening at part throttle, I'd think that the TPS doesn't have
anything to do with it.
    Since it goes away after the car warms up, I'd suspect the warm-up
regulator (= aux air regulator).  I forget where it is on the 2.0L, but
check the resistance, and make sure that it's fully open when cold and
fully closed when warm.  Other possible culprits:  Manifold pressure
sensor, various vaccuum leaks.
    That's my guess.

I've thought about this myself. I wonder if something like a Boston Acoustics

I put Boston Acoustics 6 1/2" coaxes in my Honda and really like these

but I think they would require heftier amplifaction.

I took advantage of a "free" Porsche service clinic and they did indeed
find a few things wrong with my '85 911...nothing too bad, really.

The big surprize was that the left & right transaxle seals are leaking.
Cost estimate is $225...not bad, but its ~$200 labor to replace a lousy
$16 gasket.  I *hate* such high LABOR:PARTS ratios!  


My questions are:

(a) How "compelling" is such a [slow] leak to fix...will it really attack

I like to second Lance's statement. (Nothing to do with the fact that he is my
boss.)
When I attended a tech session hosted by Danny Kohler (sp?) or Kohler Auto in
Danville, Calif. last year. He did said that lower pressure makes the side wall
of the tire softer. So when the tire spins,  it actually elongates and thus
makes the center sticks out more and wears faster. Think of a donut shaped
ballon with water inside. If the side wall is softer,  as it spins the water
(air) inside would push out the center due to centrifugal force.

Subject: Which wheels for 83 944?

Hi,
Well this past weekend I bought an 83 944 to complement my '77 911.  Since
the 944 will be used as a daily driver, I wanted to start looking for an
extra set of wheels so I can have one set for Winter.  Currently  the car
has the std. 7x15 cookie cutters.  I believe the offset on the wheels
was changed in '87 (correct me if I'm wrong), but what is the proper offset
for the earlier 944's.  Did porsche ever make 16" Phone Dials to fit these 
cars ('86 951?)?  I want to go to 16" and keep the cookie cutters for
Winter. And what is recommended - 16x7 & 16x8's, or 16x7 all around?  
Will the 16" Fuchs from an early 911 fit?  I would prefer phone dials
because of cost.

Robert Wood will have an ad in the next Panorama closing out 7x16 Fuchs 
wheels for pre '87 944's (pre ABS) for $100. The wheels are new, have no 
center caps, have a 951xxx part number, and are genuine, new, forged, 
Porsche, alloy, list price $1000+, etc. wheels. They do not take credit 
cards, and expect to sellout in 1 day. You will probably never again see 
these wheels at this price. They are normally available used for about 
$200. They will fit in the rear, but not look as nice (wide?) and will not 
handle 245/45/16 tires like the 8x16 would. They however are lighter, 
stronger, and in all respects  (except looks?) better than cookie cutters 
or phone dials. Buying new wheels from a reputable company is of course far 
less interesting than looking at comparably priced scratched, curbed, bent, 
faded used wheels. If you want 8x16's for the back, you will find that 1 
used wheel costs more than a set of 4 7x16's. I think (no flames please) 
that the correct offset is 23.3. The address is below. They are waiting for 
Pano to be delivered before releasing the wheels. Good luck.

I think you are seeing normal functionality. My car does it ('83 944) and
I've seen another (~'85 911) do it. I dont know how widespread it is across
the model line.

My guess at the use for this feature comes from the way I saw people park on
the streets in Germany. When there isn't much room, cars may hang out on the
street a bit. At night, using the turn indicator keeps the parking lights on
one side lit, making the car visible to passing traffic and using half the
power of using the headlight/parking light switch.

In other words, maybe you can track it down and "fix" it, but I don't think
it's broken.

Tad responses:

Yea Mark,  what gives?  Please forward a copy of the article to me so I can 
have it posted on porschephilles@tta.com and our regional PCA newsletter. 

For those of you that might be interested:  Mark hasn't told the whole 
story.  Yes, he came down from MN to run my humble little 74 914 1.8L toy.   
Since he was the person that got me into racing in the first place (Thanks 
again Mark!) the least I could do was give him a ride!! 

Well,  let it be said that he not only drove my car, he RACED my car and 
almost beat me!!!  Right out of the box. We were running at this years 
Little LeMans run in Austin TX (not MN).  It was a wonderful high speed 
event hosted by the Hill Country Region PCA.  
The course was modelled after the French course.  IMHO, the course clearly 
favored high horsepower cars.  Amazingly, the little 914 held its own.   
There were 50 drivers all in European cars.  85% Porsches, then Alfa's and 
even a Sunbeam.  Mostly stock 911's and 944's.  Although there were two full 
road racing prepped 911 beasts.  Killer machines.

My 914 is a testy,  little tail-out happy (oversteering) beast with a funky 
(aren't they all) shifter. (No sway bars, either.)  It has taken me six 
months to get use to it. He did it by the second run.  (I ran a 90 Civic Si 
for two years.)  It truly was great competition.   With six runs each at we 
both had a chance to try some different things.  Unfortunately,  a little 
rain spoiled the last three runs.  (Of course Mark got his fastest time in 
the rain.)  My margin of victory was VERY small: 100.162 to 100.927.   It is 
a very positive feeling to see another driver do well in your car.  That way 
you know _you_, not just the car,  have room for improvement.

While I too suspect the air leak that Dave Darling alludes to on the
problem 914 in question, it's worth pointing out that the the TPS
really, really does have three settings -- WOT, FCT, and in between.
There are limit switches for fully open and *transition* to fully closed from
somewhat open. There is a bogus squiggly line resistive element for the
"in between" parts. This wears out, and necessitates replacing the part
every 10 years or so. Just take it apart sometime and look....

Subject: What's a fuel damper?

My mechanic informed me that he had replaced a leaky fuel damper in my '86 
951 and that he did it without asking (tried to call but voice mail was 
broken), because it was leaking fuel on a hot manifold. The part price was 
$55 and it took one hour of labor (he did some other stuff that he 
didn't/shouldn't have charged me for so I am not sure that the 1 hour of 
labor is accurate.) The car was in for a timing belt retension. It runs a 
lot better now on a cold start. It used to require feathering the gas pedal 
while driving until the oil temp was up. Until then it felt like there was 
a banana in the exhaust. Now it drives normally from a cold start.

Question: What is a fuel damper, and would replacing a bad one with a good 
one have the effects that I noted?

PS. How much should it cost to paint the panel in between the front 
headlights? My car is Pearl White (like an Audi) and I was quoted $400. 
This panel is less than 2 square feet. I have 5 stone chips. They say that 
it costs so much because it is a special color, they have to remove the 
lights, the car has to be masked, and because it is a Porsche. The panel is 
straight and requires no bodywork. I think that I will invest the $400 in 
WANG stock. If they win their suit against Microsoft, I will cash out and 
paint the whole car.

Subject: Re: active suspension-production cars

My daily driver is an Infiniti Q45a (91) with "active suspension" option.
Prior to this, I had an almost identical '90 Q45 with the normal suspension.
What a difference!!!
Keeping in mind that this is a 4000lb sedan, I can comment to everyone that
the handling characteristics are very impressive. Net effect is like a 1000lb
lighter car.
I drive my 69 Targa on weekends, and the cornering power of the two is quite
comparable, with a *much* firmer overall ride in the 911 as the price for the
good handling.
By far the best aspect of this suspension is it's ability to provide a
smooth, compliant ride the 95 percent of the time that you are just driving
from a to b, while always remaining prepared to keep the car in a flat (they
actually programmed a few degrees of lean into the computer, after
discovering that the total absense of body roll in a turn is disconcerting to
most drivers.)
When a dip or rise is encountered, the car moves thru one damped cycle of
reaction to the change in the road surface, and then returns blissfully to
it's ride-height sensored normal post. 
This version of AS is semi- rather than fully active; the actuators push down
only  @ 0 to 2500 psi per corner, revised every 8ms, I think. The Lotus type
is push-pull (like a low-rider) and can reportedly be programmed to do really
eerie stuff.
Hope this has been interesting to all of you Porsche types.

most of the time my gauge confirms this, but it occasionally will

Also have any other 930 owners used the aftermarket 1.0 bar springs

so the cosmetics are not important. In fact, I prefer that they
have a lousy finish since this will drive down the price.

Thanks for everyone responding to my inquiry about the tire pressures  
for a 944. Among others Jim Pasha and Barney Bettilyon pointed out  
that they can be set at 2.5 bar all around to reduce the  
understeering tendency. Seems to me that one probably wants to do  
this only on dry track conditions though. The increased front  
pressure decreases front brake efficiency and makes it easier to lock  
them up. I certainly like to keep this in mind as it is pretty easy  
to lock them up on a wet road even with lower pressure i.e. larger  
contact patch. Moreover the underseering via lower front pressures is  
enforced by regulations at least in some countries (for safety  
reasons).

Way back in 1987, I had the opportunity to go around Lotus' test track at the
old WW2 bomber airfield, next to the plant. They had put active suspension
in some old Lotus Elites. I drove, while Roger Becker, Lotus' chief engineer 
(or was he just chief engineer of suspensions? don't remember) worked the 
black box. On one lap, the car responded normally -- leaned out for turns, 
etc. On the next lap around, Roger had reprogrammed it to stay absolutely
flat in the turns. "Now watch this," he said. On the third lap, the car leaned
INTO the turns, like an airplane banking.

You point out that the Infiniti system is not completely active, at least not
by Lotus' definition of the word (no springs, hydraulic actuators must
to all wheel positioning and movement). I don't think anybody has a true
active suspension on the market yet.

I understand one problem with the Infiniti system is that if the controls for
the electronic suspension fail, the car becomes undrivable and must be
towed.

The function of the damper in Motronic systems is to smooth out the
high frequency oscillations in the fuel pressure caused by the rapid
opening and closing of the injectors.  Although I've never had one go
bad, it is pretty easy to believe that you would have had some
drivability problems if there was a bad part in the injection system.
I'm glad the leak didn't cause you any REALLY bad problems.

I just went thru the same search.  From what I found there at least two
offsets for the 9x16s (having 911 or 930 series part nos.).  I ended up
buying the deeper backset ones (note change from offset term) that were
about 5.5" of backset.  The other rims (which are still available) are in a
set, and would you believe it, the fronts are 951 series 8x16s]  Both the 8s
and 9s in the set are 5.25" backset....

Now for the bad news:  These wheels were bought new from the factory and
custom painted w/ painted centers (Fly Yellow), then used for about 1K
miles.  Perfect does not come close to describing their condition -- but the
price for what they are is fair: I believe he wants $1400 - $1500 (w/o
tires).  I don't think he's very negotiable on price and he *will not*
separate them.

E-mail me or call if you are interested and I'll relay the phone number on.

2) time trials are competitive events, driver education events are not.  the

  I think Mike has hit on it.  I've been reading here, and no one has come
out and said maybe its time to relegate the drivers to the pits where the
controls for the cars are.
  -because the cars are no longer occupied by HUMANS!
    -It is our inevitable future, would'nt you say.....

  Having dispensed with that pesky weak link --the driver (who has a nasty
habit of getting killed or maimed), now the designers can go full tilt
and design machines that accelerate at 300+ G's, and can decelerate at
1000 G's.  Only problem now is the track surface wont stay put...

  It seems to me that if racing technology in F1 is already being muted
in favor of the human condition,, why are we reproving the frailty of 
our [friends, relatives, and business acquaintances]?

Just for completeness, the "squiggly line" isn't a resistive element,
is is a sequence of switches. Each time the wiper passes from one part
of the line to the next, an extra "injector squirt" is provided. This
therefore acts like an accelerator pump, providing extra gas as a
function of the rate of change of throttle position. Therefore, if you
have symptoms like those of a bad accelerator pump in a carburated car
(hesitation on sudden throttle opening), check these "squiggly lines",
and/or the connections to them.

On the 914 pressure sensor, you can make mixture adjustments externally,
with some care. First, the plug itself is part of the adjustment
system. At the factory, it is adjusted to a particular position, and
then sealed with epoxy. The only ones I have seen without epoxy are
sensors which have already been "adjusted", for better or worse. You
can get the epoxy out of a virgin sensor, but it takes some tricks.
You can't just dig out the epoxy from the back, and then unscrew it.
The epoxy will cause the aluminum to gall. I had success with separating
the halves of the sensor (old units had screws, for new units, drill out
the rivets and replace with screws and nuts). Screw the plug into the
housing, away from the epoxy in the threads. Note the angular 
orientation of the plug and its approx. depth before you do this.
Once the plug comes out and goes back in easily, and you know where
you started, you can start adjusting. There are three adjustments,
in terms of mixture change as a function of engine vacuum. The center
screw is the overall mixture. A collar around the center screw, which
has an internal hex, adjusts a break point where the slope of richness
versus vacuum gets steeper. The plug determines the mixture at minimum
vacuum. One of the issues is that turning the center screw (for more
richness over the whole range) may or may not also turn the collar
with the internal hex. You can make a tool like a hollow allen wrench
to hold one and turn the other. The second, and perhaps biggest,
problem is figuring what you really want to do. I have seen lots of
cars with "adjusted" sensors which don't run as well as stock cars.
I would be very cautious of making random adjustments and seeing if
you like it. At the least, get a second sensor (perhaps at a swap
meet), and play with it, keeping the stock unit as a reference to
see if the car is really better when you get done adjusting. Also,
be careful that you are not adjusting around some other problem.
This has a lot in common with random changes to carburator jetting.

While on the subject of sensors, they seem to have a common failure
mechanism where the internal diaphram cracks, causing a vacuum leak
as well as incorrect mixture adjustment. To test, suck on the vacuum
port of the sensor (through a piece of tubing, if you are squeemish).
There should be no air flow. If there is any flow, the sensor has
failed or is failing. This is an easy test at a swap meet, to make
sure you are not buying junk.

Mike,  I can't help you on the wheel fans.  But in addition to what you are
already doing, I'd try a set of Cool Carbons in the front.  Also, I don't
know what your experience level is, but braking efficiently makes a huge
difference in how much heat you generate (shorter harder braking versus
longer lighter braking).  At your next event you might try talking to folks
that are turning faster lap times than you in similar cars about their
braking points and duration.  If you can get a ride with one of the top
drivers you can learn an immense amount (about more than braking efficiently
too]).  I found that most of my brake heat problems went away as I gained
experience and was more efficient with them (my lap times came down
dramatically, too).

If you are time trialing and have a co-driver you need to adopt some cool
down regimen as well.  On your last lap (cool down lap) be especially carful
to stay off the brakes as much as possible.  If you have room in the pits
you might try running the car at moderate speed without braking to help get
the heat out.  You want to get as much of the heat out *before* you park the
car as you'll have a lot of heat soak occur once the air flow is stopped.
 Good luck...

A friend with a tell-tale 930 boost gauge which I've watched during

while he drove, I noticed that the "over boost" was actually a 
backwards pressure pulse caused by sudden throttle closure during full 
boost (i.e., during upshift @ full throttle).  The gauge pulsed upwards 
on the back-wave from the throttle plate.

The above assumes a pressure pick-off point before the throttle; a 
manifold pressure monitor _shouldn't_ do the same, though you never

Dave,

I've added studs to the rear of my 914 track car.  Quite simple.  
Have the holes drilled out to accept a 911 stud and use 911 studs.
As for the length, you will want longer studs for the rear (has to
go through more).  To do my car, I got a 'cup-o-studs' from one of
the local Porsche body shops that has to remove a lot of studs to
put on longer ones for wheels with spacers, etc., had the holes 
drilled out (rear only so far, I had that apart for the trailing
arm bushings) and press the studs in from the back.  Because my 
914 is a track car, I picked up a bunch of steel lug nuts [4~

I've heard this too.  Old bias-ply tires do ballon-out with high 
pressure, but radials have the opposite effect.  I believe (not factual 
science) the reason is that low pressure lets the tire deform at high 
speed, where centrifigal force (sort of - don't bash this from a 
physics point of view!) causes the [now] softer center to bulge out.  
This is exactly the problem that dragsters have in a *big* way on the 
rear tires.

I agree completely: do NOT let people time trial with rollover

autocrosses.  Don't wait for a serious injury or death to use common sense.

We've found over the years that some people like time trials, but most 
don't.  I agree that it wastes an inordinate amount of time for very 
little payback.  Lots of our entrants leave, since getting 2 cold 
sprint laps for $65 (our amount back then) is a real waste.  Trading 40 
minutes of track time for 2-3 is dumb for us!

PCA racing, along with other venues, fulfills this need in a more 
structured way that works great for the purpose.  Go racing!

I disagree.  Senna's forward speed was 186mph, but he didn't hit the 
wall straight-in (90 degrees); he had some angle between 45-60 degrees 
(my estimate), leaving an impact speed of 130mph - 160 mph.  Now, with 
4-6 rows of bolted-together tires, and a wide side pit preceding them, 
the impact force _might_ have been brough below the fatal level.  
Remember, the tires and sand don't have to _prevent_ the impact, they 
just have to lengthen the time of deceleration to reduce the peak force.

There's no reason to avoid improving safety.  That corner (and others

Someone else already answered the "what is a damper" question.  If you 
have a bad damper, you'll have all sorts of drivability problems like 
hard starting, incorrect mixture (surging, poor high-rev performance, 
detonation, inability to pass emissions inspection, etc. etc.).  The 
part price you gave sounds OK, but the labor might be a little high if 
the hour was _just_ for replacing the valve.

Splitting hairs over 15-30 minutes labor isn't really good for you or 
the mechanic.  It's when they start kicking the bill up by 25% - 100%, 
or also several thousand dollars, that you need to start asking 
questions.  In *any* event, an attempt to call you for work 
authorization must occur in my opinion.

$400 sounds high for a respray of just one panel, especially if you 
bring them the panel (on newer cars with detachable center panel).

(Does not necessarily apply if the car in question has a monster 
bar up front, though....)
    Stan seems to be of this camp, and mentions that his old 1.8L

    Two people suggested keeping the bar, and adjusting the driving

    Two people suggested that it was all personal preference, and
I should think of trying it both ways.

Against most people's better judgement, I'm going to keep the stock

None of the above.  Motor racing is entertainment, and will probably be less

NNJR-PCA (Northern New Jersey Region) has done time trials

I find them totally boring as a spectator, however they do
allow the driver to push the envelope a bit without endangering
other drivers' sheet metal. I've seen a lot of cars off track,
but no serious accidents, whereas in drivers ed events, there 
have been a few upside-down cars and seriously bent fenders.

Ok, I think too much bandwidth has been allocated for the RX vs Porshit 944T.

But that post really hit a nerve...

If I had to choose between a 944 Turbo and an RX7 Turbo II, I would take the 
later. Both are fast. The RX turbo II has one the smooth power, the 944T has 
the loudest , buzziest 4 cylinder in the market. Who came up with the idea of
a 3 liter four cylinder ? Its not my idea of a smooth revving engine.

And if you compare 944 turbo with third gen RX7s, there is no comparison.
The 93+s also beat all the 968s out there. And put $3k on a 93 and you can 
suck the doors of a 911 turbo (great car nonetheless).

Nobody mentioned the reliability of all Porsches. My cousin has a 944 non 
turbo and spends $3000 every year on tune ups , maintenance etc. She 
drives the car like a granny and only on weekends.  

I think Porsche had an edge in the 1960s and 70s. Now rice rules !

Just to offer a second opinion, several regions in Zones 1 and 2 have for
a number of years occasionally run time trials as the last portion of
drivers education events. It was actually more popular perhaps 10 years
ago than today, but I think the data should still be relevant. Several
regions were still running such events up until a few years ago. I don't
know if they have continued to do so now that PCA racing is available.

The safety requirements are the same as those for drivers education (roll
bar in open cars, etc.) rather than the more stringent requirements
of full race cars (cages, full drivers suits, racing belts, etc).
The number of incidents during the time trial phase tended to be as
low or lower than the incidents during the drivers ed. phase. As you
mention, the time trial aspect changes the insurance issue, although
not all insurance companies will swallow a drivers ed. accident
anyway (but some will). On the issue of wasting time, this was always
a strong bone of contention. There were always a set of drivers ed.
attendees who wanted more track time, and would avoid the time trials,
and another set who were very enthusiastic about time trials. There
were enough of the latter to keep running them.

I'm interested in any info on braking technique which would reduce

Subject: Re: 911 valve adjustment

After adjusting the valves for the first time on my 71 911E, I have
a few comments that hopefully will make the job easier for any other
neophytes.

It's just like adjusting VW valves, right? Why pay your mechanic an 
exorbidant fee? 

After psyching myself up (it's been years since I did anything more
complicated than change the plugs), I started to pop off the valve
covers - wait - there are _4_ of them, and a few dozen nuts holding them
on.  OK, no problem.  oops, I didn't expect 2 quarts of oil to flow all
over me and the driveway when I took off the lower covers :-).  

Funny that my Haynes manual didn't mention to drain the oil first.

My local Porsche parts house provided me with a valve cover gasket
set, which comes with a full set of nylock nuts and washers. They
also sold me a special feeler gauge that has a curved handle and
replaceable blade.

After making it through about 4 valves, I broke the blade off my
special new Porsche feeler gauge. I tried my regular feeler gauge
and broke the blade off of that too. Being Sunday afternoon, and
with everyone closed, I had to wait until the following weekend
to continue the job. I left the valve covers off and the hoses and
wires disconnected so I could easily take up where I left off.

A few days later, I got a note in the mail from the apartment mananger:
"We will be resurfacing the parking lots soon, please be prepared to
move your car at moment's notice. Recall that your rental contract
states that non-running vehicles are prohibited." :-)

When I stopped by the Porsche shop the following week, I asked the owner
if it was common to break feeler-gauge blades during valve adjustment.
He said with a straight face, "It all depends on the skill of the user,
I've had mine for years.  I have some mechanics who are in here every
week for a new one."  Biting my tongue, resisting the urge to describe
what I felt would be an appropriate torture for the engineer who ignored
the mechanic when he designed the cylinder heads, I forked over the 95
cents apiece for several replacement blades for the feeler gauge.
One of the mechanics there mentioned that he has ground away parts of
the handle to  get better clearance.

Continuing the job, I tried to psych myself info the brain-surgeon
delicate-touch mode (while rolling around in oily kitty litter
in my carport) and took care to preserve the feeler gauge.

It is worth noting that the crank pulley has three notches, at
0, 120, and 240 degrees, that can be used to aid in valve adjustment
(there are also two marks near 30 degrees BTDC which should be
ignored). Pull your spark plugs and put the tranny in neutral and you
should be able to turn the crankshaft with a wrench on the fan pulley
nut. You will probably have to press the fan belt in with your free
hand to keep it from slipping. Read the decals on the bottom edge of
the engine bay to get the firing order and cylinder positions.
Once you find one cylinder at TDC (it's easiest to start by lining
up the crank pulley at 0, at that point cylinder 1 will either be
on its compression or exhaust stroke. Grab the cam followers and try to
wiggle them - if there is any play, then cylinder 1 is on its compression
stroke and you can adjust its valves. Otherwise, it is on its exhaust
stroke and you need to rotate the crank one turn in order to get to
the compression stroke (if you are not confident, you can always peek
at the distributor rotor, it will point toward the the plug wire that is
firing, i.e. the cylinder that is at TDC on its compression stroke).  
Both valves are closed and can be adjusted when the piston is at TDC on
the compression stroke.  Once you are in sync, you can proceed to the
next cylinder in the firing sequence by rotating the crank 120 degrees
(to the next pulley notch) clockwise.  In this manner you can adjust the
valves with a minimum of crankshaft turning.

The green machine is now back on the road, I drove it to work today
and it seems to be running fine, no leaks, no new noises.

Thanks for the reply.

More air is the key, no doubt. One guy I know who tried wheel fans only 
saw 10 deg C difference with them on, tho I heard this third hand and 
I'd like to know more.

One way for you to do ducting is to replace your air dam with a Carrera 
air dam. It has the cut outs for fog lights and you can run ducts from 
there. You would need to replace your wiper washer tank, and the 
Carrera one is shaped differently to fit behind the air dam. It looks 
more stock than an RSR front spoiler, tho you could use one of those too.

I have heard that most racers have moved away from squirting water on 
the brakes to introducing water vaper into the brake cooling ducts. 
This gives good evaporative cooling, but doen't have the bad effects of 
warping rotors or reducing friction. You might, in fact, use less water.

As you point out, most of these systems are pretty primitive, in that 
it is up to you to decide when to squirt the water. You could leave it 
on all the time, but water is heavy so you'd better have short 
sessions! A better system would be one that has its own feedback loop. 
Temperature Thermocouples are pretty cheap (US$30) tho you'd need to 
build something to read them and respond. Your idea about the brake 
light is a good one - easy and perhaps good enough. You could even add 
in a little delay, like pump for 5 seconds after the brake light goes 
off too, so you could tap your brakes to start the system at will.

Another system I have seen from Tilton (I think), is a brake fluid 
recirculating system. You run brake lines back from the bleed valves in 
each caliper to the recirculator which has it's own bleed valve. The 
action of the brakes recirculates fluid, the idea being that only a few 
ounces of fluid in the caliper get hot anyway. This doesn't cool your 
brakes, but does help prevent you from boiling the fluid. NASCAR guys 
use them so they can run smaller air ducts, meaning higher top speed. I 
think the Tilton peice runs about $300, tho installing it isn't 
trivial. I haven't tried one.

Cool carbons will make a big difference for you. The thicker the pad, 
the better heat isolation from the caliper, so don't run them down too 
far.  Pagids are even better, but more expensive. The Motul will 
definitely help too, and changing it often will help. If you don't have 
Cool Brake ducts, those will also help. Removing the rear brake backing 
plates will also improve cooling, tho it isn't often that the rear 
brakes will overheat.

I don't have any experience with cooling fans for brakes
but an increase in air velocity will improve the cooling.

I have a similar problem and I don't want to cut out scoops
in the front spoiler. So I have considered making some kind
of water cooling of the brakes. What do you think about that?

A bottle could be placed in the trunk (replace the spare wheel
when running on the track). One could use a windshield washer
tank and pump and have the hoses directed to the discs/calipers.

You would then have to press a button on the straights when you
notice that the brakes get hot.

Complicated? Not really. Drawbacks? Cracking or changes of the
metal characteristics?

This metod is used in truck racing although they have a constant
flow of water. One could also consider to take the brake light
signal to control a relay which makes the pump to start when
you press the brake pedal...

Just an idea...

Good luck

P.S. People are telling me that it's my braking technique
that makes the brakes to get too hot and they are probably
right. This season I have new Cool Carbons and Motul brake
oil so it will be fun to see how it works when I go to the
tracks next time.

Bart says:

Come on, Bart, you get what you pay for.  I would rather spend 2/3rds of a

it's just a personal preference.

The way I see all this Autocross, Driver Ed., Time Trial, Club Racing
stuff, (in that order) is that they are all just stepping stones on the
way to learning how to drive your car.  If you don't want to time trial
then don't, but at the same time, don't try to discourage someone else

From: Pete.Rado@Corp.Sun.COM (Pete Rado)
Subject: Time Trials

I first joined the Porsche Club on the east coast, where time trials are not done
and later moved to the GGR region of California where time trials are done.  Saftey
equipment on cars is a function of level of modification.  There are 3 classes or levels
of modification that do not require roll bars....they are basically stock and stock with
minor, reversable mods.

I've seen easterners bounce of tire walls in "driver eductation"
and I've seen GGR drivers do the same.  I can't say I've seen any difference in frequency
or the severity of the accidents.  I've never seen anyone injured.
My observation is that the accidents that involve
bent metal are more often piloted by experienced drivers (yes instructurs) than not.

The plus side of time trials is you can see that you are improving.  At the Russel school,
for example, timed laps are a major portion of the program cause you can't always tell that
your technique is improving by the seat of your pants....its measured in time.  Saftey is
still the number one emphasis and improvement in time is encouraged thru a better smoother
line, not by taking unnecessary risks.  Those felt to be taking too much risk are asked
to leave.

The negative side is the loss of Sunday afternoon to 3 unimpeeded timed laps vs. a possible 
2 @20 minute run groups....But you do drive all day Saturday.

Another negative is that if you caught up in the competition of it all....well, hold
on to your wallets!  There is a lot of serious money, 50K and up, easilly invested
in changes to Porshces to try to be the fastest in the class or on the track.  Most of
the cars here are trailered to the track (not street legal) and those who have a totally 
stock porsche can
be counted on 2 hands.  On the east coast, it was the other way around.

Anyway, if you want to know the specifics of how the time trials are run, the different
classes and level of saftey equipment, contact Henry Watts (his number is in a recent
mail on autox school) and ask him to send you a copy of the GGR time trial rules.
Henry led a group to rewrite the rules for 1994 and they did a good job.  No need to
start from scratch.  I'm sure he will share them with other PCA regions.

I guess this depends upon what you define as "trash"...
People will occasionally do something bad to their cars at a time trial, but
trashing seems to be somewhat infrequent (depending upon whether their driving
at 8/10ths or 10/10ths). People who trash cars at the track probably do the 

same on the street except it just takes a little longer and the safety issues
are much greater (i.e. no corner workers, other drivers, etc.)

The POC does not mandate a roll bar/cage for cars
running in "bone-stock" class, but they remain highly advised.  

I wouldn't run a high speed event without one.

>

Clubs like POC/PCA have driver education events during time-trial/club-race
weekends.  This usually manifests itself as a distinct run group for 

students/instructors where speed is monitored by the instructure and
emphasis is place on car control and learning the line.  Prior to a 

student going "solo" they must be allowed to by their instructor. 

Shit happens, however, so when entering this type of event, one must
be realistic about the possibilities of something happening.  It seems
to me to be the same philosophy most of us may have about driving to 

and from our place of employ every day...    


>

time?

I guess it depends upon how the event is run.  The events I've attended at 

Phoenix and Las Vegas were full weekends where everybody had 8 20-minute
practice sessions with the last session of the day on Sunday being the timed
runs.  During the practice sessions, there were as many as 15-20 cars on the
track at once with strict passing rules.

As far as time trials being a "waste", the seat time provided through the
events (at least the way they're run out here) is invaluable at learning how
to handle the car at speed and to learn the proper line.

For most new drivers on the track, they usually have their hands full just
trying to coordinate the necessary actions to keep the car on the surface
at the correct location and speed without the worry of cars attempting
passes on either side.  


Before I'd go wheel to wheel with anyone, I'd want to feel that I had some
degree of trust in the other drivers' familiarity with the track and ability 

to control their vehicles.

>

Granted.  However, it's probably a good idea to learn how to drive 

before attempting to race.  That is, of course, unless you don't 

care about trashing your car...

I am quite certain he is wrong.  In fact I know that in 69 the wheelbase was
increased by 2.5", moving the engine forward a bit, which resulted in more
than a litte improvement in handling.  The rear fender was also slightly flared
for larger tires, and there were some other weight shifts made for better
balance.  These were important changes for handling.  The performance was
better too with its 170-190 hp lightweight cast magnesium case.  About the
only criticism was the Bosch mechanical injection which is hard to tune.  But
many porschephiles have said they work great(!) if you don't neglect them.

68 was considered a bad year due to the poor air injection emission control,
problems with improper plugs and timing that resulted in pitted/burned pistons;
there was no USA "S" due to emission trouble.  66 had weird front end shake
problems, tire balance problems, and strange iron weights in the bumpers to
deal with the weight bias, front to rear.  The Solex carbs were a disaster.
67 was a better year with its Webers and the "S" was nice.

I think you'll find POWER a tradeoff here.  Earlier cars were lighter so they
were more tossable and very fun to drive (I had a '66 25 years ago).  But later
cars had more hp.  However, the 73S was faster than all other 911's built until
the SC came out in 78 (which matched its 0-60 time of 7.0 sec).  Excluding the
930, of course.

You might look up the 911S Registry, a club for pre-74 911S owners.  I've seen
their ads in R&T or Excellence or Panorama?  I'll bet a porschephile would know
an address & number.  These guys could probably clear up any confusion here.

BTW, some of our European friends on the net have pointed out that they get a
tremendous import break on "antique" cars.  Trond Vidar Olsen in Norway, for
instance, is looking for a 66 or older 911 to save $thousands.  (It needs to be
*manufactured* 30 years ago and he wants to buy it next year.)  I wonder if
this dealer you're talking to isn't confused because of this?  It might explain
the demand.

These old cars can cost a mint to get right, especially if they've been neglected.
If this is in "average shape", as it sounds it is, I would guess that $9.5k is
still
pretty good.  A very good example of a 73S would cost over $20k.  You do the
math.
If the rebuild was good and the rust is contained I'd go for it.  You might
want to
do some legwork on the maintenance history.  Especially the rebuild.  And watch
that rust.  Quarter panels, taillight boxes (actually unscrew them and pull
them
out!), torsion bars, u-joints, floorboard, gas tank, upper rear of fenders,
lower
rear windshield corners.  I would worry about rust most of all.  The dash work
and the rest of the interior is a pain but it can wait.  The engine and body
can't.

Good luck.  Sorry for the long posting.

"Phone dials" are definitely available in early offset and in 7x16 and

Originally Brumos had a twin turbo 993 ordered to run in the GT 1 class of
IMSA. Porsche canceled the order when they decided that they were going to
run the Dauer 962s at Le Mans. Porsche felt that they would be too busy
developing those cars to do the 993 turbo as well. Because there wasn't going
to be anything 993 running here in the US PCNA decided that they wanted to
have the SuperCup races televised. Nick Ham is running a few of the races,
but originally they planned to have both Nick Ham and Price cop running in
the whole series. They had US sponsors and buyers for the cars, but they
never came up with enough sponsorship to make it happen. Ham made a deal with
Franz Konrad to run the car for him for a few races, I think 4. Ham placed
ninth at San Marino. The Porsche Club of America has decals on the car. It is

Kyle, K&N sells an alkaline-solution for cleaning the filters.  It feels
like some petrol-based cleaner in an alkaline carrier.  It's quite an
effective degreaser too (better than say, AutoGlym "Machine Clean").  The
can of K&N oil I have doesn't list the contents though, but I still think
it's oil-based.

Anyway, Methylene Chloride, if my memory serves right, is a suspected
carcinogen and known tumorigen (sp?).  It should not be used around
pregnant and/or lactating women -- it could be passed to the baby.  It was
a good solvent initially, but after reading the MSDS.....

Thanks for the info tho.  I'll check out with the facilities guys if they
can get any of this "Filter Coat."  BTW, what is the colour of "Filter Coat"?
Is the K&N oil red just becoz of colouring matter (curious minds want to
know)?  Again, anyone know for sure?

  We used to run them here in the Northeast but they dropped off due mostly
to taking to much time away from track events.  They were very popular in
the begining and since you have not had them out there, they probably will
be for you as well.  If you want some help setting them up, two very active
Riesentoter members just moved up there and you could probably get them
involved.  The names are Dr. Debbie Cooper and her hubby, Bill.
  BTW, we didn't require roll bars unless you had a cab of course.  Course,
times have changed and cars are, on average, much more powerfull.  One thing
we discussed here was determining the roll bar requirement based on the car.
It was the modified ones we were thinking of, i.e., if someone is willing to
spend mega bucks to get a 500hp car, perhaps a roll bar is not out of line.
It never went anywhere as the time trial series dropped off.

Howdy all,

I ran into a MAJOR problem this weekend while fixing the broken
rear trunk bolts (standard 914 failure).  Instead of the mount
ripping off the engine compartment wall, the bolts actually
broke off inside the mount.  I removed the trunk, and the hinges, but
I can't get out the remains of those bolts.  I used WD-40, and my
snap-on extractor (aka eaxy-out) to no avail.  Those bolt ends
are REALLY frozen.

The only solution I see at this point is to grind off the old mounts
and weld on new ones.  This isn't a really pleasant option :-(. Does
anyone have an alternative that I could try?

I have over 1,000 miles at Portland in a stock 911SC.  I also race a
VW Golf at both Portland and Seattle.  Both cars are very hard on front
brakes.  I started track driving in the 911 and was always dynamiting
the brakes.  It would stop quick on the track when the brakes were hot
but not on the way home when the brakes were cold.  I learned that
longer lighter pressure on the brakes keep the brake fluid from
boiling as bad.

My Golf needs a lot of air getting to the front brakes since it is
heavy (2200 lbs :-) and has disks in the front and drums in the rear.
It has an air dam with brake ducting.  The brake ducting is aluminum
dryer ducting (like aluminum foil) with NO wire in it.  If you go off
course you don't want wire getting caught up in the rotating
components.  A single 2" diameter duct on each side isn't big
enough on my car.  I need either two 2" ducts or one 3" duct.

I would highly recommend what someone else said and get a front spoiler
which has brake ducting holes in it.  Then move the pickup point on
you Cool Brake Ducts to the openings in the spoiler.  The RS style
spoiler looks nice too. :-)

Subject: Re: Which 911 is the better


The previous posts have said it all. The 76 should be avoided. The 73 S
is either being sold by an uninformed person or has some other major
problem. This car should sell for at least $15K ($20K would be more
like it) if it were a really straight 73S. A proper mechanical
restoration could cost $8K to $12K depending. The body and interior
could go to $6K easily (repaint). I am suspicious of the shopping cart
story (what was in that cart  to bend the bumper...lead or uranium?). I
would have a leakdown test performed and a Porsche-experienced body
shop look at the car.  It may have been hit a long time ago. How much
money are you willing to spend to get the S right?


One could argue forever about if the 911 is collectible. I would say
yes for the 911S because they will fetch $20K-$30K for a proprly
restored car. When the price gets to that level more people are
motivated to collect/restore the cars. The 911Es are $8-10K lower on
average and have not reached collector status. But 911E prices have
been going up slowly (wishful thinking here??) as the Ss disappear into
the hands of collectors. 911s are not priced as high as some cars they
competed with in the 70s (XKE for instance)... and are close to some
others (Corvette, Camaro, Mustang). At least the old 911s have a
limited supply (as opposed to SCs which are in some ways a more sound
way to spend your$$) in that they have either been hacked up to the
point of no return by well meaning owners in the late70s/early 80s or
have rusted into oblivion.

While that's true, it's not what he said - he was saying taking it easy on
the brakes - not applying them hard, presumably to get down to the same
cornering speed. And that doesn't work because the disks have this pad pressing
against them for a longer time. They cool better when there's air flowing over 
them instead.

This effect does work - there is an analogue in the coffee drinking world:
if you put your cream in the coffee right away, the coffee is hotter after
ten minutes than if you put the cream in at 9 minutes and 56 seconds. This
is because objects at a higher temperature radiate and convect heat away
more rapidly.

> 3) less time for pad/rotor ccontact reduces the amount of heat

Probably not - the amount of energy involved getting from speed V down to
speed v is the same either way, and it all turns to heat...

> 4) can it be that ablation -
> making your pads disappear faster - dissipates significant energy mechanically

For carbon/carbon brake systems like they use in F1, this IS the best way to
prevent brake system overheat, but for us regular semi-metalic or Cool Carbon
on steel disk types, the ablation isn't much of an effect.

The flat-out best way to reduce brake system heat is: go faster in the turns.
Really, this isn't as dumb as it sounds. Lots of folks try a track event, they
don't have brake trouble, then they start going faster on the straights and
cook their brakes going through the turns slow, then when they pass a certain
plateau, and start cornering faster, the brake trouble goes away...

Subject: Re: Which 911 is the better

Keep in mind that from '76 on, the paint process was improved to prevent 
rust.  Also, although the 74-76 2.7's have major reliability problems, a 
used sports car from the '60s is likely to also have a rebuild or two or 
replacement by now as well as the 70s car.

I'd recommend to new 911 owners to get a '78 SC if they can come up with 
15K or so.  Reason is the 3.0 engine, and body capable of wide 
wheels/tires, plus the improved paint.  None of the previous 911's have 
any of these much desired features, except '76+ have the improved paint.

I think the early 911's probably make excellent project and antique cars, 
but not daily drivers (unless you're a mechanic, and then you probably 
have a "fleet" of british cars too... <g>)

Hi Alex,

   I just heard from a friend that MG (the welding rod company) has a
broken-off-bolt-extractor rod that works really well. You stick in the
bolt hole and apply lots of current, and it welds onto the broken off end
of the bolt or stud. Meanwhile, the rosin-like coating lubricates and
protects the threads of the hole. Once the bolt has been built up enough,
you grab it with a stud extractor (the big beefy kind) and twist it out.
The price is high, but you can do 10 to 15 bolts per rod. You need to have
an arc welder for this...

Subject: Performance upgrades, tire pressures, rolling starts


On non-factory performance upgrades:
- ------------------------------------

I exclude from the following performance upgrades obtained by
disconnecting equipment with the only purpose to reduce emissions.
IMHO, factory engineers have analyzed the mechanical, thermal and other
stresses on the engines and have decided that for a "reasonable"  engine
life under "usual" driver demands (whatever these are), they will go with
the certain fuel-injection and ignition settings the stock car comes in.
For example, here are some concerns on bumping up the rev limiter.
Cylinder and piston wear are a function of mean piston speed and maximum
piston speed,  which increase proportionately with engine rpm. Lube flow
between piston and cylinder, and occasional  piston scrapes and impacts
against the cylinder, are both functions of: lubricant viscosity; 
pressure difference from top to bottom of the piston; piston speed; and
several others. Of course all of these change at different engine
operating conditions (power and speed), and there are statistical
variations from cycle to cycle on the same engine and from engine to
engine.

To compensate, engines expected to give different performance (defined as
combinations of power and torque at different speeds) are designed 
slightly different. For example, I would think and I seem to recall
reading somewhere that the 930 cylinder head and some other components are
slightly different from the 911 similar components (can someone confirm?). 

Since Porsche is rather conservative, indeed there is some room to improve
engine/car performance by tweeking factory settings, new chips,
supercharging etc etc etc. But this performance-upgrade room is claimed at
a reduction from the "reasonable" life. Considering these, it becomes a
personal choice of how much upgrade to go for (from no upgrade at all to
all-out) and how much "life" reduction to accept in our personal vehicles.
Now, let's consider buying a Porsche with some performance upgrades driven
some miles by  an enthusiastic Porsche driver, like we all are....


On "correct" tire pressures:
- ----------------------------

I use the 911 only on sunny weekends, and for the occasional driving event,
using the same set of tires for all kinds of events until it is time to
replace them. I have had CompTAs, PZEROes and RE71s at different times. 
A few years ago I took the family for a spirited country run in the 911.

            -------    |||| |   ====|^(    |
               ----    |||| ----------------
My better half occasionally and very reluctantly agrees to join me in 
some of these excursions  8-)  if I promise to help her choose bedding or
something as important at her next shopping spree  :-( 
The weekend before I had been at an autocross. 

A few miles (3 to 5) into the country roads I noticed bad handling
(understeer in some corners, wiggly Carrera tail in others). 
After a few minutes of this I was forced to stop and investigate, because
I felt it was getting plain unsafe. I checked tire pressures and they were
WAAAAY HIGH (I don't remember exact numbers). I had forgotten to take
the autocross-type tire  pressures down from the week before, and had not
noticed the bad handling on the relatively straight highways on the way
back home from the autocross (oooops!). The tires were hot, had pressure
gage, but had no thermometer and therefore could not use P.V=R.T,  to
calculate how much to lower tire pressures for safe handling. So I did it
the old fashioned way: for the next few miles I gradually reduced
pressures until I was satisfied with the handling. Next morning, when 
I checked cold-tire pressures out of curiosity, they were within 1 psi 
of manufacturer's specs in the owner's manual.

In driver's education events my car handles best at or very close to
manufacturer's spec cold pressures. Granted, this means I have learned to
use the understeer/oversteer characteristics induced by these particular
tire pressures. I think the reason we increase tire pressures at
autocrosses is because the approximately 60 seconds or so of each drive
are not enough time to heat up the tires to reach the "correct" hot-tire
pressures. I believe that cold-tire pressures in the owner's manual
correspond to pressures suitable to driver's education events and spirited
driving, and therefore safe for "cruising".  Wear patterns on shoe polish
at the edge of tires  at driver's education events indicates just-right
rollover.   For my type of driving, these tire pressures also happen to
produce about  even wear from inside to outside of both front and rear
tires, at about the same rates, ie I needed to replace all four CompTAs
with PZEROes (1991) and the latter with four RE71s (1993). The right rear
tire gets A LITTLE more wear than the other three, just noticeable when   
I am about to replace tires, and my mechanics tell me its because of the
way torque is transmitted from the engine to the rear tires to road.

Higher pressures on extended drives would tend to bulge the tires along
their outer perimeter, reduce the contact patch with the road, and thus
also friction. This improves miles per gallon (mpg), but the reduced
friction means less traction for cornering, acceleration and deceleration.
A family friend keeps telling me he pumps up the tires "real good" to
increase his mpg on his frequent long-distance trips, and I have not
convinced him yet of how dangerous it is. I sure hope he does not have to
brake in an emergency.


On rolling starts:
- -----------------

In the past I also had done my fair share of starting cars with dead
batteries by rolling them, jump in, clutch in, 2nd gear, turn key, clutch
out, pump accelerator, hope. Three or four years ago I was told this is
ill advised for fuel injected cars with catalytic converters, because it
dumps raw fuel in the converter, destroying it after only a few such
starts. Does anyone know if this is true?

At the time I had only done it a couple of times on a 924, and
never did it again (I started carrying booster cables instead). The 924
passed emissions tests several times long after I had stopped these
rolling starts, so obviously I had not done sufficient damage.



- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Most automobile owners measure miles per gallon; what distinguishes 
Porsche owners from the others is that they measure smiles per gallon.

Alex,

You can try heating the mount with a torch, then spraying just the bolt
(well...what's left of it) with a cooling agent.  After that, use the
extractor to turn out the bolt.  I've used freon as a coolant; 
I'm not sure what's available now.  Most electronics supply shops should
have something along these lines for use in troubleshooting.  Good luck!

Does anyone know *exactly* where the delay wiper relay is located ?
It sounds like it is up in the trunk behind the heater blower box.
I would like to access it to check the various connections etc.
but I don't want to waste a couple of hours just looking for it.
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated !

Unless you broke the easy-out off in the bolt, you could go ahead and drill 
the bolt out completely to the diameter of the thread root, the re-tap the 
treads to the correct size. If you broke the easy-out off though, I think 
you will be screwed.  ;)

Actually, I would be interested in anyone elses comments about what to do 
when you break an easy-out off inside a bolt that has broken.

Bill,
	Don't let it bother you. I have owned a R100, RX3 wagon, RX4, '79 RX7, '85
RX7 (raced in SSA), RX3 ITA car, and a RX7 Turbo II like the one referred to
in the message. I kept the Turbo II for less than one year and traded it for
a 944S2 sans turbo. The 944S2 was definitely a better car and now I own a C2
and just ordered a 993. They will eventually see the light, too :-).
Seriously, I think the Mazdas are nice cars and the Porsches are nice car and
just don't understand why someone has to waste the time bashing a sports car.
That's like saying Butterfingers are terrible compared to Snickers. Some like
one, some like the other and if you are a car freak, you should be happy
there are so many good cars to chose from.
	BTW, if you are really upset and want to through a damper on the guy, remind
him that RX7 sales are going down and 911 sales are going up (the new 993 is
very successful). In fact, I believe all the Japanese brands are having a
more difficult time in the sports car market.

Porsche obviously had some sort of mirror on right hand drive versions
for the UK and other markets.  Is it possibly the mirror image (pun

Subject: 356 suspension.....

Hi p..people,

Not much new from my 356 restoration.

Since last I've installed front cell panels,(the ones 'behind' the full 
closing panels) these were very easy to manufacture and with the help of my 
new flange/punch tool it was easy to put them in place too. I've also 
completed the front section of the car, inner wings, struts, diagonal, etc 
and used lotsa zink spray and sealer and 'carosol' rust shield to keep the 
car from rusting again.

I've started the dirty task of cleaning suspension arms, brake parts etc, so 
that the front suspension can be finished. I've rebuillt my ZF steering box, 
which involved removing almost 0.5mm of the bottom of the peg, heat treating 
it, polishing the worm, installing 'new' bearings (anno 1961), oil seals, 
making new gaskets and painting it in a low-gloss black enamel. It's 
(almost) as new. 

To a little surprise I found the suspension arms to be stamped with the VW 
brand. Is this normal, or could these be from a beetle? Could I as well look 
around for better beetle suspension arms to use on my car? Mine is showing 
signs of wear both in the inner and the outer surface. The spindles too are 
VW stamped, but it is the large diameter axle, is this too normal? Didn't 
Porsche bother ordering these without the VW stamp?

Well,....I hope someone out there have some clues,......by the way ; it is 
the Bilstein VW-Bus steering dampener that should be used with the 356?
Another question while I'm at it; will Beetle inner and outer tie-rod ends 
be OK for the 356. (.........has TRW parts for Beetle!)

cheers,
trond

My 911 is the '73 so there may be differences BUT I have seen a right hand mirror
in the '73 model official parts catalogue, unfortunately it's NLA - the drivers 
side (left hand) is still available new for about ~200.- Sfr ( about $130). I'm sure
I've also seen pictures of cars of this era with both mirrors fitted.

Subject: Air Filters

Is there any filtration test data on the re-useable oil soaked filters?
This technology was the traditional filter used for internal combustion
engines, but it was supplanted for good reason.  The paper filter
technology, properly done, is vastly superior at getting fine abrasive
dust out of the intake stream.  This is basically the same technology
used in untra-clean manufacturing facilities.  I've built some of those.

Life of modern engines has been significantly extended by two major
factors.  First is better filters for air and oil.  The second is
better oils.  I, for one, will stick with the paper filters.

    Jon-

    First of all, I think $11,000 for a 1983 911 with 93,000 actual
    miles would be a very decent price.  But, the deal sounds suspect
    to me, especially if the fool won't even let you start the car.
    What does the guy expect you to do, slap the $11,000 down, with no
    questions asked, then have him deliver the car to your house on a
    flat bed?  This does not strike me as a deal of a lifetime, after
    all, you can find pretty decent '83s for around $12-13,000 that,
    believe it or not, you can actualy DRIVE before you buy- what a
    concept.  Moreover, for $15,000 you should be able to buy a very
    clean, well maintained, DOCUMENTED 1982-83 SC.

    Good Luck.

Subject:  911 Oil Filters

    Thom-

    I have gone through similar investigations and have concluded that
    the only filter for my 1971 911 is Mahle (or one from the Porsche
    dealer that has the Porsche name on it that is specifically made
    for my car).  This is not elitist or label buying, but based on my
    understanding that the other filters do not have the relief valve
    that the Mahle does that lets the oil continue to flow
    even if the filter is clogged.  While Purulator and even Mann
    filters will fit, I am pretty sure they don't have the relief
    valve.  As for price, if you find the right source at the right
    time you can get Mahle filters for around $7.50 each.


    I hope this helps.

I agree with Ted about checking the '73S out thoroughly.  The price sounds too
good to be true, which means it probably is.  Check for hidden rust, damage from
a crash, etc.  Pull up the carpets in both the interior and trunk, check for
rust around the dual batteries in the trunk, etc.  Leak down test on the engine
is a must.  The 2.4 engines are generally reliable, but lead oil because of the
expansion of the magnesium case.  If things check out, buy it before the owner
discovers what it is really worth.

I have to disagree with Ted, howerver, that early 911s aren't good daily
drivers.  I use my '72 911T Targa daily (summer and winter) in the D.C. area and
it is fun, reliable daily transporation.  In the last 18 months, it has made two
trips to Illinois, two to Florida, one to the Parade in Cincinatti and countless
swap meets up and down the East Coast.  Maintenance?  Oil change every 3,000
miles (of course), a major tune every 10,000 miles and periodic checks of the
mechanical injection pump.  If you have a mechanic who knows how to deal with
early 911s, particularly mechanical injection models, the car can be a
dependable daily driver.  The 911 has to be dependable.  I also own a British
car (TR-6) and need all my time for it <g>.  Actually, the TR is my significant
other's daily driver with over 100,000 on the clock.  Are we tempting fate here?

  Alex, Andrew, and friends..
  Have you tried to drill out the remains with a 'reverse twist' drill?
  -one option  Eastwood has these.
  Andrew is right about the torch stuff..if it works.  Maybe dry ice as
coolant.  You might have better luck using one of those microtorch tools
radio shack sells, with it you can use a tight, controllable, intense
heat.  Get as little heat on the stud as possible.
  When you reassemble, use some anti-seize compound on the threads.
  There is also a mod for the bolt that adds a groove to the bearing face,
and a grease zerk to the bolt head...a shot of grease and the thing is ok.

  What condition is the hinge mount under the body, usually if the bolts
are rusting in place (moisture is present), the mount rots out and needs
replacing.  I would prefer to do that than futz with getting out and maybe
destroying the stud/threads.  Look for cracks around the spot welds too.

  Replacing the hinge mounts is pretty easy and about the same amount of
work (well, for me anyway)... ask me for more detail on how to's if you
wish.  I'm horribly busy now do'in enviro strife testing on our disk array
product.    gotta go...my [mail] box runneth over.

Subject: Re: Outside mirrors for 911T in '72?


The mirrors are an old-fashioned chrome design. I dusted off the books
and road test compilations and found up to and incluiding 2.2 l cars
the mirrors were round. Some photos of 2.4 l cars have a chrome square
mirror, some have the round design( very early examples?). In the US
there was only a left side mirror.  I do not think two mirrors were a
US option. English cars had a single mirror as well (but on the other
side of course!)

Two mirrors are better than one, but the rear quarter vision in the 70s
911 is excellent so a quick turn of the head after a check in the dash
mirror works well. I was suprised how little I've missed the right side
mirror.

Subject: Noisy Distributor Cap/Tuneup

My 951 would occasionally idle erratically or take several tries starting.  I 
started going through the std tuneup of plugs, rotor, cap, fuel filter etc 
since I didn't get service records when I bought the car last year.  I changed 
the Champion plugs to Bosch Platinums.  

Upon inspection, I found that old distributor cap's terminals were worn down 
to the ceramic material so I changed it last night and heard a distinct 
knocking which I confirmed came from the cap by using a piece of wood as a 
stethoscope. 

The replacement cap is apparently not made by Bosch since I got it from 
Carlsen's EuroSelect parts bin.  It started right up this morning and I got to 
work without any idle problems.  My idle speed is fixed now at 1000rpm instead 
of bouncing around.  BTW, I didn't replace the rotor since it looked OK. 
 Is this knock OK?  Should I return the cap and only use genuine Bosch parts? 

Any gotchas for fuel filter, changing brake pads and bleeding?  I didn't see 
special tools mentioned in Haynes.  It looks straightforward. 

P.S. Is anyone from NNJR attending this Sunday's autox at the Meadowlands?  
Pocono Raceway Memorial Day weekend?  If so, drop me a line or stop by and 
introduce yourself.  My PA plate is AJY8878.

Subject: Outside mirrors for 911

Mirrors

For -72 - 73 Porsche had different mirrors for different markets. In Germany and
some other countries it was sufficient to deliver a car with just one left hand
mirror. In Sweden for example cars had to be delivered with both left and right
outside mirror to be street legal. For the -72 model Porsche designed a new
small rectangular shaped mirror for the markets that did not need a right hand
side mirror. The other markets had to stick with the old round ones. For the -74
model year they enlarged the rectangular mirror and, I think also made a right
hand version available. These mirror were later replaced by the big electric
UUpaddlesUU.

Regards,
Paer.

PS. I have the small rectangular on my -73 S Coupe, the right hand side of the
car looks clean and better without mirror.

the car out of storage to the chopping block).  I do not want to harm 
anything mechanical when starting/driving it for the first time.  Should
I remove the airbox cover (with air filter) when starting it the first time
to prevent a possible backfire?  I do not have a pop-off valve.  What about
getting the parts lubricated before starting the car?  Is there anything
special I need to do to the gas or oil that has sat all year?  

Furthermore, what would a decent tune-up consist of, since the car has been
sitting for such a ling time.  Any thing that might need fixing or
adjusting?  It ran ok when it went into the shop last October.

Also, the car has a brand new paint job (Metallic Black).  How long do I
have to wait for the paint to "cure" or "harden" before I wash the car?
What about waxing it?   I was told I may have to wait sometime before
waxing it (30 days?).    Do I have to keep it super clean for a while so
that any dirt or pollen does not get stuck or rubbed into the new paint
job?  What about sunlight?   I do know that I have to keep away from 
thoose guardrails this time.

My '70T sits outside, so many mornings the windows are fogged 
over.  Even if I clean them off they fog right away for the
first 10 minutes or so of driving (and my rear defrost doesn't
work-does anybodies?), so I really like having the right side
mirror.

Up to '72ish? the round mirrors seem to be "correct".  The good thing
about them is I think they'll go on either side by just rotating the
mirror around the base.  Automotion has them for $65ish, a fellow '70Ter
just bought one for the right side of his car.  The only thing I don't
like about them is that they are pretty small.  The later rectangular
mirrors offer better visability, but as we seem to agree, not available
for the right side and are much more expensive.

How about later mirrors?  I'm also interested in a good set of mirrors
for my car.  Previous owner installed incredably ugly "sport" mirrors
that I'm certain he thought made the car racey (went well with his gold
chains) that K-mart would be embarrased to sell.

Re: Recent post bashing the 951 versus the RX7 Turbo II

I have owned two RX7's, a 1980 and a 1987 Turbo II model, both purchased new. 
 The "80" was a delightful car, light, simple and pretty much bulletproof.  I 
put 60,000 mile on that car and had no trouble at all.  The biggest mistake I 
made was trading it for the "87" Turbo II. In the thirteen months that I owned 
that car it was in the shop eleven times.  There was a substantial driveline 
vibration that defied solution.  I became good friends with the Mazda zone rep 
and he finally brought in an expert from Washington who diagnosed the problem 
as a "bent" driveshaft.  It took three attempts with new driveshafts before 
they found one that was straight.  The Mazda people admitted that they had a 
supplier problem and there were a substantial number of Turbo II's delivered 
with this defect.  The Turbo II was a little easier to drive around town than 
the 951 and I could usually out accelerate the local 951's at stop lights but 
found that the Porsche pulled away above 60 mph.  The Turbo II was 
uncomfortable on long trips, the seats are awful, the plasticky red/orange 
dash clashed with the rest of the interior, and it was simply not as much fun 
to drive as the "80" RX7. I was happy to see it go.   

I now drive an "87" 951, it feels much more substantial than the Turbo II, it 
can cruise comfortably at speeds the RX7 can't reach and more importantly, the 
951 feels safer and more controllable at 130 mph than the Mazda does at 90.  
It came with dual airbags and brakes that are incredible.  In comparisons test 
by the major car magazines during the mid "80's", they universally chose the 
Porsche over the Turbo II.  My 951 has 34,000 miles on it and has needed only 
routine maintenance.  All the 951 owners that I know have found the car to be 
relatively trouble free - particularly from "87" on.  With low mileage "86" 
951's selling in the $12,000 dollar range, the price/performance ratio makes 
them a great buy for drivers that appreciate fine machinery.  You need to 
drive both cars back to back to really see the difference between them.

By the way, my troublesome Turbo II didn't spoil me on all Mazda's, I bought a 
Miata for my wife and that car is a lot of fun to drive around town, sweetest 
gearbox I've experienced.

   I've converted 2 928s to use Sankyo-type compressors, converting 2 
different
 brackets (78/79 brackets need to be "re-radiused," early 80's bracket
 is a close fit and only took change to all-thread rod to "hang" it with).
 I started off spending a lot of time at the parts store looking thru the
 billion and 3 different rotary compressors to see which one was closest. 
Then I
 ruined the eventual core value of the new compressor I got by hacksawing off
 the extra mounting "ears" that interfere in the tight space (and will limit
 your adjustment range) and drilling out the threads in the remaining ear the
 all-thread went thru (bracket holes and the compressor holes were different
 size). The clutch/belt alignment worked fine in both instances, though,
 apparently this is one area thats pretty standardized.

   Both cool great and work fine, however even though I've done it twice I
 don't know if I'd do it again; if you spend $350, you will probably be able
 to get a local shop to rebuild yours. This sounded high to me at first,
 but when you consider that any compressor/clutch is $200 plus, then the
 bother of new fittings, its probably the best alternative. You can buy a
 used Alfa for $1600....

   (p.s., 928 international sells rebuilds for $500, I'd suggest checking
    thru your yellow pages or even thru your local parts store for places
    that could rebuild yours cheaper. I even had a condensor custom-built
    for a car once, there is someone out there who can fix your compressor).

Senna killed by wheel says Mosley LONDON, May 11 (May 11) UPI - Ayrton Senna
may have been killed by a blow from his car's front wheel, claimed
International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Max Mosley on Wednesday
in a letter to the English newspaper The Times.

Motor racing's international boss wrote: "There is a strong suspicion that
Ayrton Senna was killed by a blow to the head from the front wheel and
suspension and that, but for this, he would have survived without serious
injury.

"We will all know more when the results of the Italian inquiry are
available."

Senna, world champion in 1988, 1990 and 1991, died after a violent high speed
smash while leading last weekend's ill-fated San Marino Formula One Grand
Prix. The Brazilian smacked his Williams Renault into a concrete wall at more
than 300 kph, destroying the car on impact and ripping both right hand wheels
off the vehicle. He died four hours later in hospital.

Italian authorities have impounded the car while investigations continue into
Senna's crash as well as the fatal smash in practice of Austrian driver
Roland Ratzenberger.

There has been widespread criticism of the Imola circuit where the deaths
occured but Mosley wrote in his letter that the FIA had consulted drivers
beforehand and had allowed concrete walls because history suggested the
corners where the accidents happened were generally safe.

"The leading drivers and the FIA were happy with the Imola walls because
experience of many accidents had shown the angle to be shallow. Injuries did
not occur.

"At the momemt it seems unlikely that doubt will be cast on a principle which
has worked well for years and on which all American oval racing depends."

The FIA held an emergency meeting at its headquarters in Paris last week and
has installed a number of safety measures in time for this week's round at
Monte Carlo - the sport's showpiece race which Senna had won a record six
times.

Both Senna's and Ratzenberger's teams will enter just one car each for
Sunday's 78-lap race and the front two spots on the grid will be left vacant
as a mark of respect to the two killed drivers.

Gerhard Berger, the veteran Austrian Ferrari pilot who has been deeply
disturbed by the deaths of his two friends, remains undecided about his
future in Formula One.

Australian authorities, meanwhile, have re-named part of the Adelaide circuit
 - where Senna scored the last of his 41 Grands Prix victories last year -
after the Brazilian.

Subject: Summary: 914 pressure gauge

I had posted a question last week about where to get a gauge to measure ~30
psi for 914 fuel pressure.  I won't include the responses, since they were
all CC: to the list anyway.  What I found was a local heating/AC supply
store, which sold me a 0-60psi gauge for $22.  They said that best accuracy
and readability is at about half scale, so 60 is the best for this
application.  It has a 4.5in diameter for easy readability.

I adapted the 0.5in NPC fitting to the 7mm tap by using a very short 12mm
heater hose with tight clamps, and an old fuel filter (old but unused)
which just luckily had a 0.5in stem on one side and 5/16in on the other.
I poked a good size hole in the paper element to not have a pressure drop.

When I hooked it up, pressure read 27psi.  I adjusted until it was 29psi,
in the spec for 1.7L.  I didn't notice any difference in driving.  The
funny thing is that when I was going to remove it, I took out the pump
relay and started the car, and could keep it running using the accelerator.
It took forever to drop the pressure even down to 10psi.

I'll probably check it every year or so, since spring type regulators are
bound to weaken over time.  And I ran a lot of water into the gauge, since
who knows what gasoline could do to it.

Hi, Steve, and Jon.
 
One good scenario for the dealer not letting you start the '83 911 is
because he has noticed there is a puff of blue smoke when it first fires up
in the morning. Porsche people know that this is more or less normal, but
the dealer might not know that. He might also not be clever enough to have
the thing warmed up a bit so it doesn't do that.

Hi, Mike.
 
It's the same Gloeckler Porsche. I don't know if the family still owns the

If you look at the results of races in the early 50s, two Gloecklers appear.
Walter Gloeckler (and his employee, Hermann Ramelow) built the cars,
initially based on VW parts (but then so was the Porsche). Gloecker was a VW
dealer, too. Walter's cousin Helm also drove Gloeckler specials.

You ask where can you cruise at 120 mph plus - the Interstates and secondary 
roads in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and western Ontario.  A good radar detector is 
suggested and of course weather conditions may dictate otherwise, but you can 
"cruise" in comfort, albeit with some boredom, as the roads tend to be 
straight and wide.  Enforcement by highway patrol is pretty much nonexistent, 
there is a recognition that those are open spaces and traffic is very light.  
Speeding tickets in Montana for instance are given as "excess consumption" 
fines of $5.00 and no "points" are awarded.  I recommend a good set of Z rated 
tires and a Porsche.  This is how a Porsche is meant to be driven.

You need to find the area's best restoration-grade interior shop. *DO*
*NOT* try to save money on this -- the resulting seats will either be
very uncomfortable or look hideous. Or both, if you're *VERY* lucky....

Anyway:

> 1. Is this possible?

Yes.

> 2. How much will it cost?

It depends. Probably, to do it right, over $500 a seat.

> 3. Can they match the color?

Yes. No problem if you go to the right kind of place. (I can recommend
a place in Houston, but that probably won't help you)

> 4. How much would 2 entire seats cost? (Sport seats would be nice)

Porsche seats would be over $1200 used, and about double that new.
Recaros vary, but are in the same ball park -- and then you'd have to
have them done in leather to match...

> Also, I'd like to replace the door panels for the same reason, although
> maybe I can clean them. What do they cost?

Look, think about this: what about the headliner? The carpet? The
insulation and sound deadening? Smoke is nasty stuff... 

So, try the following: have the car detailed. *SUPER* detailed. Should
cost you like $200 or so, tops. The detailers have tricks and solvents
that can make even a ratmobile smell like a new car by just getting it clean
for a change.

Failing that, the shop *CAN* do the leather. And the headliner. And the
carpet. Or you can get a new car. Or you can learn to get used to it.
(BTW, how did you wind up buying a car with a smell you objected to? I
routinely rule cars out for that reason....)

All the time...

For the looks, if it was just a cosmetic flare to the wheel wells.
For handling, if it involved wider rear tires.  For high speed
stability, if front air dam and rear tail were done.  For braking,
if those incredible 917 four caliper piston drilled and vented
brakes were installed, and for overall agility, if sway bars,
torsion bars, and associated suspension upgrades were done.

The factory turbo look option was almost $14k, according to

Subject: 356 suspension

Hi, Trond.
 
That's correct, Porsche bought the front arms and rear trailing arms from
VW. (Plus a bunch of other parts). The VW parts used in the 356 (for
representative purposes, only the 1960 356 B is listed) are given in a table
on p. 261 (German and English editions) of Dirk-Michael Conradt's book
"Porsche 356: Driving in its purest Form" (Porsche 356: Fahren in seiner
schoensten Form). The table is taken from a factory internal document, so
some parts are not readily apparent (so "rubber sleeve, 1 per car, 0.06 DM
each" doesn't help much) but most things can be puzzled out. There are some
minor modifications to the spindles, I think, like a sleeve fitted over the
arm where it rides in the bearing of the Porsche (plastic bushing pressed
into tubes of VW, little roller bearings in Porsche) and the mount for the
front anti-roll bar. But yes, you can make VW arms work.
 
There were two spindle sizes, the switch occurred in mid-1958, beginning
with coupe #104852, cabrio #150981. Early spindles had a 25 mm inner wheel
bearing, 20 mm outer; late spindles had 30 mm inner, 20 mm outer. If you
need bearings, some are available as VW parts, some as standard DIN-norm
bearings. Disc brake cars were different again in terms of bearings, but I
think the spindles remained the "late" type. (Source: Stoddard catalog).
 
I have heard that the VW Bus steering damper fits the 356, but haven't had
to fool with it myself. Stoddard catalog lists Boge and Koni.
 
I have VW tie rod ends in my daily driver, they work fine. Technically these
are not entirely correct (there is a bend in one rod end for Porsche, while
the VW ends are straight) but they work. If you want the correct ends,
Brad Ripley at NLA Ltd. in Reno has them.

Last night I dug up my old "OnTrack" mags and found the source of my
information.   Lincoln Cobb had written a series of three articles on 
safety in the aftermath of the Watkins Glen turn 5 crashes in 1991.
He is involved in highway safety engineering.  He presents a very 
rational analysis of tire walls in the second of the three articles.

In short, he states:  "...these figures tell us that in the absence of
any added ballast or fill placed within the voids in the tire bundles,
a double tire wall located in front of a more rigid object will do little
to mitigate the consequences of a high-speed impact."  The "figures" show
that a 2200 lb. GTP car hitting at 100mph will lose less than .25mph by
the time the tires are used up.  A 3500 lb. NASCAR car will lose about
.15 mph.  Extrapolate the other way for a 1200 lb F1 car.  And then
consider that the number of tires "used" by an F1 car will probably be
less due to smaller frontal area.

He goes on to say "That is not to say, however that tire walls are now
and forever useless...a tire wall literall takes off more speed for slower
impacts than for high speed impacts...for an impact speed of 10.69 mph
that tire wall will bring the car to a complete halt...It seems that
the lowly tire wall has a place after all -- but that place is not
where high impact speeds are expected..."

If anyone wants any more details, request them.  Obviously, there are
copyrights involved here, but if there is interest, I will try to
work something out off-line.

Does the factor turbo look option include the brakes, sway bars, torsion 
bars and associated suspension upgrades ?

Can't one put on a tail and wider tires without doing the turbo look ?

Sounds like it just comes down to doing it for appearance sake. Which is 
fine. But I thought that reduced the car value.

Did you turbo look have the turbo tie rods on the car? (As delivered from

Also a snide comment on the high-speed stability, it doesn't help that   
much since the flares slow you down! (sarcasm)

The only reason I can see to do a turbo body conversion is because
you like the looks. The narrow body (SC Style) is much more
aero-dynamic (sp) and can have the same brakes installed. The only
real advantage the turbo body has is can take much larger tires.

I looked at doing this conversion to my '78 911SC. It cost too damn
much and would not provide me any benefit except looks. My '78 has
more rubber on it than a standard '84 turbo (225/45 in the front,
245/45 on the rear).

Thanks to Peter Albrecht's advice last month, I began to look elsewhere for
problems I was blaming on my Solex P40-II's.  I found some ignition-related
problems (timing, dwell) that were responsible for most of my performance
problems.

I've one nagging performance problem that I _do_ believe is carb-related:
at 3000-4000rpm and medium throttle, opening the throttle further (not
necessarily to full, but say opening throttle from 1/3 to 1/2) results
in momentary hesitation or 'skipping'.  Must I adjust my accelerator pumps
for more delivery, or look elsewhere?

My mixture is about right (passed smog, behaves expectedly when twiddling
mixture screws at idle, 20mpg city driving), and plugs look perfect.  I'm
not sure where to look for a solution.

I'd really like to buy 'Zen and the Art of Solexes' were it in print.  Can
someone recommend a good book on Solexes?  It's easy to find material on

A word of warning to those of us out there with the mechanical tachs on

Took it back to International Instrument here in Houston (713) 863-0020

Porsche, Mercedes, etc laying about. Was told nope, can't be -- each 
instrument is run in for 2 hours to make sure it's working OK. So, we
took it apart, and voila! we have the culprit.

Seems the tach drive seal on the front cover failed. And proceeded to leak
oil into the cable. Which then got spiraled up the cable, into the tach
itself. Where it gummed up the works.

Stoddard does have the necessary replacement seals, which I'll have in a few
days. In the meantime, my tach is apart soaking in an ultrasonic cleaner full
of trichol or something, and it'll be another $80 to get it back and working
right...

The pop valve should open upwards into the area just below the air filter.  
The portion of the airbox that is susceptible to explosion is the triangular
portion just below the finned part that is visible when you take the air 
filter off.  To the best of my knowledge this is where the cold start 
injector does its injecting, thereby providing the fuel for the explosion.  I 
think some of the later CIS systems moved the cold start injector out of this 
area of the airbox, but I don't  think it totally solved the blown airbox 
problem.

Subject: King Link and the wheel cylinder.

Hi people,

Suspension rebuilld;
I have just ordered TRW's king pin set (K-472), it is for the VW. I'm not 
sure whether this is both K&L pins. At least the king pin has brass bushings. 

Brakes;
I was cleaning and painting brake parts yesterday. Straightforward but dirty 
work. My car seem to have more than enough lining left, but I will have to 
rebuilld the wheel cylinders. At $115 a piece I'm pretty sure I'll try the 
rebuilld them first. 

The bleeder valve was broken in one of the cylinders. I tried the (cheap) 
extractor, and of course did it break. I had to MAG weld the bleeder/broken 
extractor, just pulsing enough to build up a weld big enough for my smallest 
self locking plier. The heat itself is often enough to loosen the old broken 
piece. It came out nicely. 

1 phone call later:
The 'soft-ware' for rebuilding the wheel cylinders is about $ 6 for each 
cylinder, Original ATE stock. Needless to say, I ordered some extra sets 
(long term planning). 

Some questions that arises; can VW wheel cylinders be used in the rear brakes??
Does anyone know whether the VW beetle fuel cock can be used with the 356 
cars? (There seem to be 2 types of Beetle Fuel-cocks. From Germany one can 
get Beetle fuel cocks for $30 or $60.)

 I'm really thankful for all the information I get, I might put it together 
and make a 356 restoration guide-article. Things like what alternative part 
to use, which other cars can supply this item, where to look for specific 
parts, how to restore old and sometimes broken parts, etc.Often I feel these 
kind of questions are unanswered in restoration guides/booklets. You can 
really save a lot of money if you know where to get exactly the same 
part(s), without the Porsche designation. 

cheers,
trond

Subject: Front suspension noise

Hello out there Porsche Friends!

I figured I passed this on for what is worth...

Checking my car the other day, I became aware of some front end noise. Here's 
how I discovered. Using my knee, I moved the car up/down by leaning on the front
bumper. I like to shake the car every so often to listen for rattles and loose
parts.

Much to my surprise, I heard a noise comming from the top of the strut on the
driver's side. Check the other side and it made no noise. Popped the trunk and
placed my hand on top of the strut tower. Kneeling on the car I could feel/hear
play on the upper strut bearing. This is the part that isolates road vibration
from the strut. It also serves as bearing when the wheels turn. 

It had about 1/4" of play. I think the rubber mounting is shot. Pass. side
does not make any noise at all. Ordered the part, and found out it has been
superseded. My car is an '84 Carrera with only 28K miles. I actually ordered
both bearings. I'll rather do a wheel alignment once! Yes, after changing them,
the FE alignment will have to be done since they control camber and caster. 
Bummer!

Any way, I figured I pass this info to the net, just in case you folks are
chasing misterious FE noises (thumps!) specially when going over small bumps
like where driveways meet the road. BTW, parts are $60/ea.

Subject:  Re: Zen & the Art of Solex Carburetors

I have found that at a given float level, adjusting the accelerator pumps
smooths out that nagging flat spot that seems to attack while cruising on the
freeway.  Also, I like to check all four nozzles for not only volumn but
where they are aimed as well from time to time. I think the factory manuel
says the stream should hit the butterfly and NOTHING else.  Also, sometimes a
piece of dirt will clog/pratially clog one nozzle and produce a flat spot.

The factory manual says that the neato feature allowing one to adjust the
float level from the outside of the carb allows one to adjust for different
grades/types of gas.  This indicates that their may be more than one optimum
float level depending on gas and/or...altitude maybe?  Has anyone fiddled
with this concept?  I'm resolved to learn by trial and error over the summer
and any of your experiences would probably allow me more trial than error.

The orginal question was where can you drive 120 mph - I believe that Porsches 
are meant to be driven fast and that includes curves - the autobahn heritage

Did you clean the carbs of accumulated sand and whatnot? Could one of the
jets be plugged? It's not that bad a job, it's helpful to have a factory manual
to tell you which of the brass hex heads lead to jets and which are just there
to plug various holes, it's a good idea to work logically, in a clean
environment such as a good well-lit bench or on the kitchen table, placing
the jets etc. on a white sheet of paper in some exploded-view fashion
as they come out. And do only one carb at a time, so that if you scramble
the parts, you can look at the other to see where they should go. Get some
carb cleaner spray and go to work (don't spray in the kitchen!) Use proper
metric box-end wrenches, not adjustables or pliers or vise-grips! If necessary
go to the local K-Mart or similar Trashmart and buy a cheap set of third
world small metric wrenches. They won't need to take much torque.
 
Then the next step, if that doesn't cure it, is to measure and if necessary
adjust the accelerator pump volume. With ignition off and engine cold (we
don't want to somehow have a backfire at just this time) peek into the
throttle bores and work the throttle linkage. Are you getting a stream of
fuel from each accelerator pump nozzle when you blip the throttle by hand
this way? Then at least they're working somewhat. If the engine is stock,
you shouldn't have to adjust for any more than the factory required. I've
never had to mess with it, and I don't even have matched accelerator nozzles
yet it seems to run fine. I think one side is stamped 35 or 135, and the other
40 or 140, don't remember.
 
I recently had a carb problem. I could run at any speed I liked, but had a
hard time getting there -- no accelerator pump action at all on one of the
cylinders. The cause was not a plugged jet, but rather a loose brass plug
which closed one accelerator pump passage. When asking for more throttle,
three (or maybe just two) squirters squirted into the engine, the one with
the loose plug leaked onto the side of the engine compartment. This
particular plug shook itself loose on a race track, and I'll have to remember
to keep those tight in the future or even safety wire them. Cleaning
everything out fixed the problem, merely because I had to go through
everything and retighten.
 
See, aren't you glad you didn't automatically trash the Solexes? Imagine
how much fiddling you'd be doing now to get aftermarket Webers to
run even remotely as well as the Solexes you have now. And if you'd
done the carbs without first finding the simple ignition fixes, you would
have dropped all that money and still not have cured the cause.

but didn't buy it. No opinion on whether it's worthwhile.
 
Tell me again what car you have, and I'll try to look up the correct jet
sizes. (912, wasn't it? I can look up the last 356 SC jets, which should be
pretty close if not identical).

John,
     Those ears at the front of your transmission are "safety devices" used to 
prevent the engine from entering the passenger compartment in the case of a 
heavy front end accident.
     There are a matching pair of ears welded to the body that will interfere 
with the ears in question as the drivetrain gets pushed back from the force of 
an accident.
     I found out about the purpose of these ears after my mechanic changed the 
clutch on my `87 944S and noticed that a previous mechanic had cut them off to 
allow for easy removal of the trans and torque tube. Needless to say I wasn't 
pleased about this, and this was definately one of the factors behind getting 
out of that car and into the one I really wanted: 89 951.

is according to "The Illustrated Buyer's Guide" by Dean Batchelor.  As someone

There is absolutely no evidence that the change in the rules "caused" the
accidents of Ratzenberger, Senna, or Wendlinger.

Motor racing has always been a dangerous sport. It is inherent. There was
a public outcry about the "carnage" of the first Paris-Madrid race.

The facts are that humans will always make mistakes. Drivers are
human, and we will always see even the greatest drivers make mistakes.
For the last 12 years, we have been relatively lucky. (Ask people
like Clay Regazoni or Nelson Piquet if they feel "lucky?')

At Brazil this year, we saw Senna make a mistake, go off course, and dnf.
Sadly, at Imola, Ratzenberger and Senna were killed in accidents.

Did the drivers accept the risk? No doubt. At the same time, I
suspect each belives that "it can't happen to me."

Sadly, racing automobiles will always involve the risk of an
accident; sometimes that accident will be grave. It is impossible
to protect the driver against EVERY possible risk. The drivers 
accept this; so too, must the fans.

Dunno about "inner."  The tie rod had a ball joint at the end.  It will
loosen up, and past a certain point needs to be replaced.  The way you
check it (and the ball joint at the end of the control arm) is by
pushing up on its base.  I use a huge pair of "channel lock" pliers,
putting one jaw on the base of the ball joint, the other on some
component to which the top of the joint is bolted, and squeezing.

It can also be "bad" because its rubber boot is not intact.  The rubber
boot keeps a heavy grease in and dirt out.  The boot is available as
an Audi or VW part; I don't think you can get it from Porsche.

The tie rod end should be pretty cheap to replace in toto.

Subject: Bike/ski rack on a 944?

  Has anyone put a bike rack on their 944?  I'm getting tired of putting our
  two bikes in the hatchback of my (87) 944 and was looking at racks, there
  are a few possibilities at my local bike store:
  $50 Rhode Gear Rhode Rack (mounts on read of car)
  $90 Rhode Gear deluxe bike rack (mounts on rear of car)
  $150-$180 Yakima combination of towers, crossbars, etc. (mounts on roof,
  good for skis too)
  What experience have you had or what recommendations might you be able to
  make?
  Thanks, Chris Milner
 
Chris,
  I have both of the Rhode Gear racks.  The 'regular' one I got years ago
and used it to carry our bikes on the 944 with no problems.  I have not
tired either on the 911, not sure the turbo tail is up to it :->  Just make
sure you mount it properly.
  The rear mount has some advantages because not all cars today have gutters
to hook the roof type up to and most of the 'gutterless' versions I looked
at seemed like they might screw up the paint.
   I also have a La Prealpina (SP?) that I got years ago.  A roof system
that we used for the bikes and canoe.  944 roof was to short thus the Rhode
gear rack.  I got so used to the Rhode Gear rack I have never used this one
on the Volvo or Quattro.  Right, wrong or whatever, the rear mount seems
more secure.
  Both the roof rack and the regular Rhode Gear are headed to a sale this
weekend - live in the Phila area :->

In an earlier message about the inexpensive '83 911SC someone was looking

Then someone mentioned that the 911 will puff blue smoke when started, but
not if properly warmed up.

I had the same experience once at a Porsche dealership, and I have some
questions.
When I was looking at a '87 911 Carrera, the car puffed blue smoke out of
the exhaust when it was started. The salesman said that this was normal
for a 911, something about oil dripping into the combustion chamber after
the car sits for a while. Is this true, and why does this happen?
Otherwise, the car was beautiful, Guards Red coupe, black leather
interior, 70K miles, but $29K. Ouch! Too rich for my
financially-impoverished college blood.

Another question: Do the newer 911s, the 964 and the 993 still have pedals
which come out of the floor instead of hanging down from under the dash
like other, less sublime cars? Why does Porsche do this? Is there any benefit?

Finally: Are there any plans for a 993-based RS for the US market? I'd
_love_ to drive one, hopefully own one in the distant? near? future. :)

I found the following in the latest issue of Porsche Panorama, which I
submit to the list without comment (yet), for your amusement:
 
On p. 5 of the article on the Cooper-Porsche, we read:
 
"In September 1992, Muller's race team installed the new engine at Watkins
Glen, but after one lap he headed for the pits. 'It wouldn't go past 2500
rpm,' he said. 'I was afraid to go past first gear.' A glancing inspection
by James Cox, the actual engine builder, revealed the fan belt running in
the wrong direction.
 
"Muller explained, 'It was intaking through the exhaust pipe and exhausting
out the carburetors. The car was running backwards!' In haste to make the
race, a starter was installed (not by Cox) which turned in the wrong
direction. The mechanics quickly replaced it with one rotating in the
opposite direction, and Muller was on his way."
 
Comments, gang? I am eagerly awaiting your findings, meanwhile I have to

About a year and a half ago, I put a factory short shift kit on my '85 911. 
 This has been, without a doubt, the best $100 I've spent on the car.  In 
Pano a while back, they compared a few short-shift kits, and the factory 
version pretty much came out on top.  Several of the other versions out 
there greatly exaggerate their reduction in throw.  The factory model is 
cheap (usually around $100, but I saw a dealer in CA selling them for $85 a 
month or two back), definitely not of cheezy construction, and a breeze to 
install.  It shortens the throw a pretty good amount and improves the feel 
of the system.  As with any short shift kit, effort increases as throw 
decreases, but the slight increase in effort with the factory kit was a 
welcome to me.  However, as the 915 gets older, it tends to enjoy 
lightning-quick gear changes less and less.  The SS kit brings this quality 
out in the open a little more.  It will make you double clutch a lot more. 
 YMMV.  If anyone doesn't have this Pano copy, or can't find theirs, and 
would like some specifics, drop me a note and I'll try to dig it up.

Also, a few digests back, someone asked about Turbo tie rods coming standard 
on Turbo-look  911s.  I'm 99.999...% sure they didn't.

Subject: Chrome vs Polish wheels

I have an anti-chrome story to tell.  I bought an '86 928 about 1-1/2 years ago.
It's forged wheels were chromed (I believe at the time of purchase when new).
Right before I bought it the previous owner replaced all four tires.  Turns out
the chrome was flaking under the bead, which caused a series of slow leaks that
showed up over the next 1,000 miles or so.  After talking to a few people about
this, it appears this is common behavior for chromed alloy wheels (explanations
vary, but include the different rates of expansion of aluminum alloy vs. the
chrome plating).  In any case, it was a royal pain to have to keep remounting
tires and asking the tire people to carefully scrape the bead each time.  After
one remount each, things have stabilized.  However, I would fully expect to have
to go through this again when I replace the tires, because more corrosion is
probably occuring right now under the beads, but it won't leak until the
tire/bead interface is disturbed again.  I'll probably have the chrome stripped
off at that time.

I really wish my wheels had never been chromed.

Subject: Machining 914 heads -- questions, questions ...


I have my spare 914 2.0L engine's heads in the machine shop, ready for the
work.  The shop is quite competent in general machining, and they've done
911 work as well, but they've never done 914 heads, let alone modifying
them.  So I have questions that I hope either Stan or someone else may be
able to answer:

 - Three-cut (venturi) valve job
  Is the term "three-cut" general enough that any machine shop would know
  it, or do I need to give them more specific instructions?  If so, how do
  I describe this valve job to them?

 - Porting and polishing?
  Is there any point to doing this?  Looking at the condition of the
  combustion chambers, I think I should have them polished at least, but is
  there any need for porting as well?

 - Current compression ratio
  I have the 95.5mm NPR pistons and cylinders; I believe that these give me
  the stock 7.6 compression.  Is that right?

 - Calculating the new combustion chamber size
  If I figured things right, compression ratio is 
	(swept volume + unswept volume) / unswept volume
  where the unswept volume is the combustion chamber size.  Or is it really
	swept volume / unswept volume
  Using the first method, I get a current combustion chamber size of 74.7cc,
  and a new one (at 9.5 compression) of 58.0cc.  With the second method, I
  get a current size of 64.8cc, and a new one (at 9.5 compression) of 51.9cc.
  I think these correspond to deck height reductions of 2.4mm and 2.1mm.
  Which one should I use?  And are my calculations correct?

 - Machining the deck
  Never having done this before, I can't tell the machinist where he should
  take off the material to achive the deck height reduction.  Does he 
  machine a deeper groove around the edge of the head where the cylinder
  barrel seats?  Or machine the barrels instead?  I expect that he'd need
  to also machine an equal amount from the bottom (not back) of the
  combustion area (looking at the heads as if they were installed in the
  engine) which is currently flush with with the seat for the barrel.

  Are there other things to worry about?  Valve clearance (I'm using the
  FAT Performance fuel injection cam)?  Pushrod length?  I would really like
  to have this done locally, as shipping parts across the border to the US
  and back can be a real hassle -- and time-consuming as well.

  I am grateful for any and all advice for the seasoned veterans...

Yeah, I also cry "bullshit" on the story, since there is no way that the fuel
could get into the combustion chamber to ignite.  Even if it *could* by some
miracle of God (or Ferry Porsche), the spark would occur *before* the fuel/air
mixture was injected.  Also, as mentioned by Kim, if the engine was running 
backwards, the tranny would be "backwards" as well.  Not to mention the problem

First off, three-cut is not the same as venturi... Venturi is three cut
some extra polishing work, to make the air flow across the valve and seat
maximally smooth. Not quite a mystic art, but close enough -- you gotta
know what you're doing to do it right.

In generaly, they should be able to figure this out. *However*, if they've 
not done either VW Type 1 or Type 4 heads, this might be a stretch... I'll
see if I can dig up our numbers (I'm nowhere near my engineering notebook, 
natch) and see if I can get the info for you by tomorrow sometime. Oh yeah --
we run *VERY DIFFERENT* cuts for "stock", "street performance" and "full
race". "Stock" should last a long time. "Street performance" will want a
new valve job in 20-30k miles. "Full race" is measured in hours of 
operation....

Nope. Ignore all that. No porting, no polishing. As I've said about a zillion 
times before, unless you're making *MASSIVE* changes to the rest of the 
engine, the 2.0 heads in their natural state flow more air than you can use.

Sounds right. Those are flat-top pistons, right? If so, then if you measure
the deck height, you can figure it out. If they're dished, you can still do 
it, but it's a little harder...

In this case "deck height" is the distance between the top of the piston
at TDC and the top of the cylinder under correct torque.

It's really (swept volume + unswept volume) / (unswept volume). Which is why
you need to measure the deck height -- unswept volume == head volume +
deck height volume!!!!

That's where you cut the *CASE* so that the barrels all sit at the same 
height from the case centerline, on nice smooth flat surfaces...

You *CAN* flycut the heads (which is what you seem to be describing in an
odd sort of way), but you absolutely have to be sure on the cut you make
there -- you can't reduce the cylinder head volume too much or the compression
ratio goes up too much, and you can't cut too much or the valves kiss the
piston (also not a good thing).

All I can say is *PLEASE* work with an intelligent guy who's willing to

Subject: Car Covers; Senna

Later this year I'll need to replace my car cover.  I've been using
Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories `Stormguard` for the past three
covers or so.  The OEM on the cover is Covercraft, and the material
Evolution 4 (4 layer quilted polypropylene).

I get about 2 years out of the E4 covers here in the midwest.  At about
18 months, the plasticizer gets baked out, and they started powdering
their way to obscurity.  (I've had cotton and poly cotton before that,
and they don't last, and a heavy dew will soak through them.)  The
E4's start at $144.

There was a Gore-tex cover on the market for awhile, but it was
outrageously expensive, over $300, as I recall.

I now see BHMA is advertising "ultraguard" covers above the E4,
with three layers.  Outside layer is UV resistant knit, middle
layer acrylic foam 1 way moisture barrier, and inner layer
cotton flocking.

They claim the Ultraguard will last longer (3 year warranty instead
of 2 f/E4), better sun protection, and is machine washable (E4 is
washable, in a commercial machine {hassle}, and is NOT machine
dryable).

As you'd expect, it's more money, starting at $224.  Does anybody
have any experience with this new cover, I don't mind spending extra
money so long as it's worth it.  E4 works well, though it would
be nice to be machine washable and last longer.

Off topic.  Monaco (or F1) just wasn't the same without Senna.  I
really miss that yellow and green helmet flashing around the track
in the red and white car (never did get used to the Williams w/
Rothmans colors).  I've followed Senna for 10 years, this is an
irreplaceable loss for me.

Still no clear answers to why the car left the track, but the
cause of death has been ID'd as a suspension member piercing the visor
of his helmet and hitting him in the head.

Most include replacing the manifold with something set up for electronic
injection.  For example, TWM has a nice butterfly set-up.

If you're going to use a programmable management system such as Motec,
you also have a lot of freedom in the cam you use.  If you plan to
stick to the 2.4 displacement, figure out what the right cam is for
it based, mostly, on what other folks have found to work.

Didn't the 'pooper' have a Carrera engine? (DOHC gear driven?) Or is this a 
much more uptodate equipage?
Anyway it *is* possible to have one cylinderbank running 'backwards' in any 
engine with more than one bank and separate camshafts. Due to 
'massive_misstiming' one can have such an effect. The criterias for what is 
'backwards' could of course be backwards operating; i.e. breathing through 
the exhausts and blowing through the carbs. But if we are talkin backward 
rotation it seem very strange and as someone pointed out; 1st of April-ish!

The only engines I know of, which will run either ways, are the two-cycle 
engines. I had a 50cc Sachs 'moto-bike' some 15 years ago which was fully 
operational both ways. Quite fun running backwards in 35 mph.

During the past year I have had an intermittent problem with the
speedometer in my 87 911 Carrera Coupe.  During the winter months
(Alabama) the car was driven infrequently, perhaps once a week, and often
the speedometer would not function for the first few miles and then kick
in and work fine for the rest of the trip.  The upshift light (or 
whatever it is called) did not function either but would also begin 
working again when the speedometer did.  With the onset of warmer
weather I have used the car on a more regular basis and have had no   
problem until yesterday.  At the beginning of a 20 mile drive the
speedometer worked fine but about 15 miles out it suddenly quit as I was
slowing for a stop sign.  It didn't work again the rest of the day. I
checked the connections on the back of the instrument and took several
short trips to test it but nothing worked.  This morning everything was
fine.  Yesterday was quite warm with temperature in the mid-80's and this
morning, of course, is much cooler.  Is this a temperature related
problem?  Is the speedometer dying?  Any ideas?

The stuff does work, sort of, as a sound deadener. It has too little
mass to be really effective, especially at the low frequency end of
the scale. But it does help damp out high-frequency resonances, and it
can help add some damping to help prevent outright oilcanning of large
unsupported sheets.

Now, having said that, I would strongly recommend against using the
stuff in a race car, especially sprayed onto large areas. It does burn
very nicely, and as it burns it emits some particularly nasty
combustion products, as well as tending to drip flaming melted
globules as it burns, if it's on an overhead surface. It is also very
unstable when exposed to temperatures well under the flash point, so
if you spray it onto panels that are near exhaust plumbing and run
above 300degF or so, you can expect it to break down.

This is the stuff that everybody uses to make foam-in-place seat
inserts, and nobody ever seems to give the flammability of the stuff,
or its combustion products, a second thought. I wish they would, and
would use the female form they make with it as a mold to lay up a
fiberglass seat, instad of just covering the foam with layers of duct
tape to keep it from crumbling and using it directly... There's not
too much exposed surface area in a seat insert, so it poses less of a
hazard.

I can tell you some really nasty stories from direct personal
experience having to do with burning spray-on isocyanate foams in an
enclosed area, and I can show you the scars if you like. Moral- there
are probably better substances for use in a race car that is likely to
catch fire now and again. Just my opinion.

Subject: 914 Front sway bar mounting tabs - Help

What an awful discovery.  I acquired a stock 914 front sway bar and the 
Weltmiester mounting kit, (hoping to improve my Auto-x performance) only to 
discover that there were no u-tabs to connect the droplinks on my transverse 
/ A - arms.  Currently I can't mount the sway bar!!!

What suggestions can anyone offer?

I called Automobile Atlanta and they said they had a kit that could be 
installed on the original transverse / A - arms by either bolting them on or 
welding them.  I am not a welder, and don't have easy access to anyone that 
is.  So bolting them on sounds like an easier approach.  

Does anyone have experience with these kits or a similar problem?  If so,  I 
am all ears.  

Stan - any advice?  P.S. - I ran into a guy yesterday that knew the old 914, 
you and in particular Elmer Fohey.  His name is Udo Ditges.  He works at a 
Firestone shop on Hwy 6 in Houston.  (They fixed one of the old Pirelli's

Subject: Wrecked 930

At a body shop down the street from my office there is a red 930 which has
been T-boned on the driver's side. It's obviously an older turbo, perhaps a
77 or so, because it doesn't have a whaletail big enough for an intercooler.

After examining the damage, which is extensive to the driver's side door and
rear quarter panel, I found that red is not the car's original color. Rather,
it was a dark metallic grey. The impact was apparently severe, as it flexed
the frame enough to warp the trunk hood.

Call me crazy, but I'm actually interested in trying to buy the car from the
body shop (I doubt the insurance company owns it anymore - I would say totaled).
I guess I'm hoping I can buy it dirt cheap, put the $10-$15K into it for repairs, and end up with a 911 turbo.

So, what would be a good offer to make on the car? $500? $1000? $3000? I know
the drivetrain itself is worth some money, but the rest of the car has been
ragged pretty bad. I may have LOTS of bargaining power. Also, is it really
worth looking into? I have a friend in body repair who looked at it and said
that it could be fixed up just like new, but that it would take extensive effort
and money.

Thanks for any advice.

Subject: Re: Engine running backwards

Maybe it was modified to a 2-stroke configuration ....

When I was growing up in England, there were a number of 3 wheelers --
BMW Isetta (also 4, with two very close at the rear), Messerschmitt,
Bond, ... If they had no reverse gear, you could drive them with a 
motorcycle licence, hence at 16 rather than 17. Which led to an amusing
(and no doubt apocryphal) story of an Isetta pulling yp to a brick wall.
The door opened forwards, and the driver was trapped inside, and had to
resort to asking passers by for assistance.

Anyway, back to running backwards. Many of these machines used motorcycle
engines and transmissions, which usually (except BMW R75's and Gold Wings,
and a Brough Superior -- any others?) have no reverse. One enterprising
manufacturer figured out a way to get reverse, by changing the ignition
timing (maybe it had two sets of points) and using a reversible starter/
charging system. So to back up, you stopped the engine and then restarted
it in reverse -- which gave you possibly 4 speeds, and a maximum of 70 mph,
in reverse. These were cars which weren't terribly stable going forwards ...

Fred Pack asks of the Porsche immobiliser,

| a)	Does anyone know about this device. Any good?

I have the Porsche immobiliser fitted on my 911. It is disabled by
a microchip key, and controls power to a number of different 
electrical systems. The installer chooses exactly which and
keeps a record, most cars have a different permutation plus 
basic fuintionality circuits immobilised. 

The only way to steal a Porsche with one of these is to tow it
away or steal the microchip key. I suppose it might be possible
given about 5 or 6 hours to trace the circuits and disable it
but you would need a workshop. But regular smashed window and 
driven away theft is out of the question.

The UK is the home of car crime, and I have felt a lot more secure
since I had this fitted. Does not stop dorkbrains driving into 
your 911 in the Waitrose carpark though :-(

I don't know how you can find out with respect to a particular material,

It can...

Yes. A friend and I tried this out some, 10+ years back. 

1) If you put it anywhere that it can get wet, it will, and it will hold
water, (especially if it blocks the drain holes) and the constant moisture
will help rust the area. It may not be so bad for filling in fibre glass 
sections, with no steel.

2) If you are going to do it, use good foam (great stuff is ok), or it won't 
set, and will drip out.

914 Rear Trunk Pad
Fellow Porschephiles--
    I guess it would be best to ask the concours guys about this:
I have started putting the spare tire of my 74 2.0L in the rear 
trunk, so I can use all of the front one for cargo.  The tire fits
fine, and the screw that holds it down goes nicely into the threaded
hole over on the LHS of the trunk  8-)   .
    I just picked up a replacment carpet at the Automotion Swap
Meet this weekend, and it has a metal grommet positioned right over
the threaded hole.  Problem:  No such hole in the trunk pad (the
thing covered with black plastic/rubber).  There's a recessed spot
that *looks* as if a hole might be put there, but there ain't no
hole.  What did the Factory do?  Is there a version with a grommet
that I can get?  Should I just chop a hole in myself?
    I may not be able to do it completely correctly, but I'd like
to see what it would take, at least.
    Thanks!

Kevin,
The Tech bullentin is 9202 dated March 13, 1992.  This is a problem for the 
the 1989, 1990 & 1991 C2/4.  You have to have wet oil on the lower part of the 
cylinder heads, otherwise the factory won't authorize the warranty work.  They 
have to replace the pistons, cylinders and replace/install new head gasket.  I 
know there was no recall notice sent out, the dealers are just looking at the 
cars as they come in for service--another way to get you to go to the dealers 
for sevrice.

 I heard about this through the SCCA grapevine, but the story below omits one
disturbing incident:  "... On approaching the pits, Muller flashed his lights
to alert the pit crew and found that since the alternator was also running
backwards the lamps cast shadows!  Only quick reaction on the driver's part
prevented complete loss of visibility to the corner crew."

I found the following in the latest issue of Porsche Panorama, which I
submit to the list without comment (yet), for your amusement:
 
On p. 5 of the article on the Cooper-Porsche, we read:
 
"In September 1992, Muller's race team installed the new engine at Watkins
Glen, but after one lap he headed for the pits. 'It wouldn't go past 2500
rpm,' he said. 'I was afraid to go past first gear.' A glancing inspection
by James Cox, the actual engine builder, revealed the fan belt running in
the wrong direction.
 
"Muller explained, 'It was intaking through the exhaust pipe and exhausting
out the carburetors. The car was running backwards!' In haste to make the
race, a starter was installed (not by Cox) which turned in the wrong
direction. The mechanics quickly replaced it with one rotating in the
opposite direction, and Muller was on his way."
 
Comments, gang? I am eagerly awaiting your findings, meanwhile I have to
replace the Q-switch on my laser printer. :-)

Subject: Factory Visit Report


Just a quick report on the Stuttgart factory visit I
have recently returned from. 

Arrived in Stuttgart on Thursday lunchtime, met up with
the other people from PCGB (who were the organisers). 
Forty-three people in the group, most people had driven
over, about 20 911 and two each 944 and 928. The cars looked
excellent massed in the hotel carpark. People were stopping
in the street to gape at the site of the massed German metal
all with UK plates.

After lunch we were off the the Mercedes factory to visit the
museum there. This was an excellent visit and we saw some
great Mercedes including plenty of early racers, a fabulous
silver 300SL Gull Wing, and the first Daimler-Benz. This last historic
car was most interesting, and the guide started it up for us to
demonstrate that it still runs!

There was an informal dinner that evening for the masses,
and lots of beer and schnapps drinking. A lot of Porsche
stories etc, etc.

The next day was Der Tag. We were off in the coach for the visit
to the Porsche factory and Museum, both on the same site at Zuffenhausen.
When we arrived there was some hanging around and taking the 
air outside the museum. This is just inside the main gate, 
and the air was thick with the noise of new 911s belting in through the
gates and hitting the gas as they headed up the ramp into the main 
compound area. The drivers were really winding these cars up,
no gently does it, just nailing the throttle!

Then we were into the museum. This was fabulous and had many
historic Porsche motor cars and exhibits. The ones that I really 
remember are Porsche 356 number 1, an amazing 914/8 (yes that's right an
8 cylinder 914), a number of Le Mans winning 917s, some amazing
962s, some historic engines, a brilliant display with
a model of every production and racing Porsche type, a 550 spyder
and a Carrera Arbath.

Next it was the tour round the factory. First off was the interiors
department. We saw leather craftsmen at work on various aspects of
Porsche leather interiors, dashes, door pulls, door linings etc.
I was amazed how much of the leather interior is sewn by hand.

Next we saw the little line making soft tops for the 993 cabriolet.
This is an interesting line, it had about eight or nine stages
involving the assembely of the frame (amazing amount of metal in
that hood!), fitting and stretching the cover etc.

After that we went to the engine assembly area, and saw the line
making the 911 3.6 engine. This is a smallish, 20 odd station line.
Each engine has the flag of the destination nation on it's carrier,
and a special parts set on a kind of upright trolley follows the engine
round the line. Each engine takes about three hours to put together.

Next we went on to the engine test area. Here the engines are unloaded
from their trolleys, and connected up to a test bed in a series of 
little rooms with heavy glazing in the window. The test bed has
all the connections that the 911 engine would require for electrical power, control,
power take off, dme etc. It takes about five minutes for the engineer to winch
the engine into position, make the connections. The the engine is
started up and warmed up. The engineer monitors the operating
parameters, such as oil temp etc. The engine is warmed up more or
less unloaded, and when a certain oil temp is reached, the engineer 
applies a known load on the engine using the water brake (engine drives
water turbine through the clutch). The engine is run up to around 5000
rpm and the dual ignition circuits are tested, the oil temp, oil pressure,
fuel pressure, tourque and power output are all monitored. When the engine 
reaches normal operating temperature, it is run up to maximum power rpm, 
and the final power measurement made. The engine has to be within +/- 2% 
of the stated maximum power. Only 1% fail to pass. Even if the engine
is producing more than the stated power, it goes back to a special
diagnosis area where the problem is corrected.

>From the engine department we moved on to the body shop. Here, we saw the
body preparation and paint facility (from the outside, they are fanatical
about preventing contamination in the multi stage cleaning, dipping, 
priming, painting and finishing cycle.) We then moved downstairs and saw the
911 production line, and the mini lines that mate the rear subframe with the
engine, transmission and suspecnsion and pre-assemble the front running gear, 
and finally mate up the sub-assemblies with the painted bodies, and install 
the electrics etc.  Every car has a different spec, and cars for all markets are 
assembled on the line. A complex tagging system ensures the parts for the appropriate 
spec are arranged together in kits to await the arrival of the body down the line.

Then we saw the body fabrication shop, and saw the 911 line, this has 
fairly extensive automation, and a number of sophisticated robots, plus a 
significant amount of manual work with the more fiddly welding operations.
We also saw a number of bodies designated for the RS 3.8 and the Turbo S 3.6,
these all have special constructions with reinforcing and stiffening elements
built in by hand.

Then it was on to lunch in the huge refectory with all the workers and Ilse and
the other Porsche club liason and factory people.

After lunch it was back on the bus and out to the R&D centre at Weissach.
We arrived at the test track just as the engineers were finishing putting a
Carrera Cup 993 and a RS 3.8 round the track. Sadly we did not get to
go in these, but enthusiasts were pleased to note that the RS was the
infamous blutorange colour! Then we settled into the main business of the day
which involved the engineers giving rides round the test track in a brand
new 928, 993 and 968 Club Sport. Needless to say this was a pretty wild
experience, and we saw some great driving skills and motor cars demonstrated.

In the course of the track afternoon, the 911 used TWO sets of tires, and
928 trashed one set in about 25 laps, the 968 seemed lightest on the tyres and
used a new set of tyres in about 50 laps. The poor 928 was really pushed
beyond the barriers of acceptable use on the test circuit which has lots of very
sharp bends and ups and downs, and basically I think that the engineer trashed
the brakes along with the tyres, the brakes boiled and were smoking when he
called it a day for safety reasons. The 911 took the pounding very well, and
the brakes were unaffected by the remorseless punishment, as was the braking
and cooling system on the 968 CS. This was a really excellent afternoon
which was enjoyed hugely by the assembled faithful.

That evening there was a formal dinner hosted by Porsche, and the guest speaker
was Stephen Murkat (sp?), the guy who leads the design team for the 993 and is
now running the Boxster development. This guy loves Porsche style and
functionality, and was a pretty cool sort of person. He would not give away
any Boxster information, as one would expect, but he did promise the hungry masses
that it would be "pure Porsche" and faithful to the concept car that everyone
went crazy about. He was very pleased with the public reaction to the 993 and
happy it was outselling other rolling objects alleged to be sports cars in the US and UK.
In the question part, I asked him what car he drove, he has the latest 928 GTS.

That more or less sums up the Porsche component of my holiday, except for autobahn
speed trials! I got indicated 6100 rmp in 5th, two up, with luggage and it felt like
there was still a little more to go. One of the other 911 people on the trip
claimed an indicated 170 mph! in his modified Carrera RS 3.6.

Then we wnent down to Interlaken in Switzerland for a few days and then
drove back to the UK in a single hop of 12 hours, with 9 hours actual driving time
over a distance of 786 miles. I only got busted by the police once for exceeding
the speed limit. Yup, France, 60 kilometres outside Calais, 160 kmh, 600 ff fine along
with another 911 driver who originally passed us at 140 mph 100 kilometres 
further back. The thing that got us was that loads of French people were getting 
pulled in, and none of them got a fine just a ticking off, but because
we were Brits driving 911s they felt that were justifiable targets. Still
I don't really mind, in the UK I would have lost my license and had a ban
for driving over 100 mph. In fact Les Flics were very friendly once they got the cash,
and there was a lot of joking about what a good dinner they were going to have that
night etc.

All in all I can recommend this PCGB organised visit, and will probably go again
next year.

Ben

Ok, so I have a really easy questions for you all.  What is the 
advertised gas mileage for the 944?  I have a 85.5 944 and I'm seeing
something around 22mpg.  Does that seem right?  If it's too low what's the
most likely cause of it?
I did look in the owner's manaul for the mpg figure, but unless I'm going

Subject: Engine funning backwards

Engine Basics:
  OK, Here's what I understand would happen--
   (let's just ignore such "subtleties" as valve timing)
INTAKE-- would be the same as a "forwards" running engine, then we would take
   that nice mixture and
EXHAUST it until we hit more or less the top of the stroke. Then at TDC, 
   close that exhaust valve it's time to ignite whatever is left for a huge
POWER pulse. But wait that distributor was running backwards too, I wonder 
   what happens there? Anyhow,
COMPRESS those exhaust gases and blow 'em out the intake when that valve 
   opens again, further diluting the next charge.
 So I guess one basic question is, can you get enough power from a small  
uncompressed mixture to compress its own burned volume?

  On a more serious note, awhile back there was some talk of serious damage
occurring if a 911 engine was run backwards (during a spin, not of its own 
accord). I assumed it had something to do with the cam chain, etc. Anybody
have the lowdown on this?
  Thanks,
    Brian

  OFFICE MEMO         911 VINs - help?                      Date:  5/16/94

I have been trying to keep a good record of VIN definitions
for those interested in buying used but "original" 911's
(1981 and later).  Excellence published a definition a few
years back but it was incomplete and inaccurate in at least
one obvious way.  Someone sent me a definition from The
Performance Handbook (I think) but it conflicted with some
other info I had.  And I have tried to glean some of it from
advertisements (with VINs included).

The one digit I cannot get straight is #13 (figures!).
Here's what I have:

13  = Code for the body type & engine
      81-89 (SC & Carrera)
         2 - coupe (USA/Canada)
         6 - targa (USA/Canada)
         7 - cabriolet (USA/Canada)
      89-94:
         0 = coupe (non-USA)
         (1 = turbo targa (non-USA)
         1 = RS coupe (USA)
         2 = coupe (USA)
         3 = targa (non-USA)
         (4 = targa (non-USA))
         4 = targa (USA)
         (5 = turbo coupe (USA/Canada) or cab (non-USA))
         5 = cabriolet (non-USA)
         (6 = turbo targa (USA/Canada) or targa (USA))
         6 = cabriolet (USA)
         (7 = turbo cab (USA/Canada) and cab and speedster)
         8 = turbo coupe (USA)

I could use some more data to get this right.  If you're feeling
helpful would you look up the 13th VIN digit of your 1981-on
911 and send it to me along with:
Year, USA-Canada/Rest of world, coupe/targa/cab/speedster,
and if it is an 89 or later: Carrera/C2/C4/RS.  If you have a
slant nose (the 911, that is), a  930, turbo-look, or some other
body style that might be relevant tell me that too.  Maybe I can
straighten this out.  Please don't confuse me with VINs for
modified cars.

If someone has THE DEFINITIVE VIN list, or can point me, great.
Thanks.

Racing Reforms Aimed at Increased Safety
MONTE CARLO--Motor racing chief Max Mosley announced
Friday sweeping safety reforms following recent accidents
that have cost the lives of 2 drivers and left a 3rd
critically injured.

Mosley, president of the International Automobile
Federation (FIA), said the reforms will be introduced almost
immediately, despite opposition from the teams.
He said the measures are aimed to "reduce the performance
of the car and improve the security of the drivers."
Mosley said the changes, regarded by experienced
observers as the most sweeping in Formula One since the
banning of wings in 1981, will come in to force for the
Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona in 2 weeks.
The new measures have been introduced in the wake of the
accident Thursday in which Austrian Karl Wendlinger suffered
critical head injuries and less than 2 weeks after the
deaths of Brazilian Ayrton Senna and Austrian Roland
Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix.

The chief changes, Mosley said, "do not have everyone's
agreement, but we will do it despite the Concorde
Agreement." The Concorde Agreement is the legally-binding
document of partnership that had controlled the sport.
"The time has come to push aside such things in the
general interests of the sport," he said. "These things have
to be done."

Mosley said the following measures are to be introduced
by the next Grand Prix in Barcelona:
- -- Reduced size for the diffusor (an aerodynamic section
of the exhaust escape at the rear of the car)
- -- Reduced size for the front wing end plates
- -- Reduced size of the front wing.

He said these measures would reduce downforce by 15 %.
Mosley said that for the following Grand Prix in Canada
June 12, the lateral protection of the drivers' heads will
be increased by increasing the size of the cockpit sides.
This would increase the overall weight, and the minimum
weight for cars would be increased by 25 kilos.
Mosley added that the front wishbones in the suspension
of the cars are to be strengthened to prevent the front
wheels breaking away and cockpits would be lengthened to
help avoid the driver striking his head on the front of the
cockpit.

Rules governing the type of fuel also will be tightened
ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix aimed at eliminating so-
called "jungle juice"--fuel with additives that enhance the
performance of the cars.

Further changes, originally intended for next season,
would come into force by the German Grand Prix at the end of
July including the introduction of a stepped base to the
cars to reduce the aerodynamic affect and slow them down.
The size of the rear wings would also be reduced.
Next year FIA would enforce a further reduction in
aerodynamic downforce of 50 %, Mosley said.

He added that teams would have until Aug 1 to come up
with their own suggestions as to how to do this, but if they
fail to agree on any proposals, he said FIA would push its
own plans through again.
He said also that the power of the engines would have to
be reduced to 600 horsepower from the current maximum of
around 800 for next year.

Mosley added that various other safety issues, such as
the use of airbags and foam and driver restraints were being
studied with various experts and a Safety Advisory Group was
to be formed under the chairmanship of FIA's chief medical
officer Sid Watkins.

There was a mixed reaction from the teams after Mosley's
announcement.

Patrick Head, technical director of the Williams team
said: "I have absolutely no comment to make--on or off the
record."

Benetton managing director Flavio Briatore said: "We need
to see what the technical people make of it, but it's a very
good decision from FIA and Max Mosley. I approve of
everything."

A spokesman for Ferrari said they are pleased with the
regulations proposed for this year, but unsure about the
future rule changes.

Ken Tyrrell commented: "I am sure most teams are going to
be concerned about the dates they have to be introduced by.
It's like asking some of them to have a completely new car
designed in time for the German Grand Prix, something that
would normally take us a year or 9 months."

Subject: BBS RS 3-Piece 8" & 9" X 16 Wheels

Dear Friends,

I purchased a set of BBS RS 3-piece wheels with silver centers for my '87 black 
911 Cabrio. I put new KONI's on all 4 corners, and that kind of lifted the car a 
bit. Unfortunately, I have 9" rims for the rear with 245/45-16 Dunlop DM40's and 
8" with 225/55-16 in the front. Now that I want to lower the car (after only 250 
miles) the front rims are just too wide. I have the following options :
	1. Buy two 7X16 rims and 2 205/55-16 tires. Cost $1420.00
	2. Sell the two 9x16 rims and use the 8x16's in the back
	3. Sell the 8x16's - the 9x16's do well on the rear

Is anyone interested in two 8x16's with or without tires, or wants to consider 
trading 7 for 8's ? The rims are in impeccable state. (the turbos came 
originally with 7's but can use the 8's with 225/50-16 tires).

Any suggestions anyone ???

I went to this, and got a door handle fix (the kind you have to drill out 
the old riveted one) for $8.50 and some old Excellence mags. for $1 
each.  A lot of old parts that I couldn't readily determine what they 
were.  I think the surfboard was for the 356 ;)

Re: Backward Running Porsche



 Dear Pete:



  Wow! Another Backward-Running Porsche! Yes, ironically the Maestro had
just such a thing happen to him a few years ago. Actually, it happened to
one of his Customers. And it wasn't an April Fool's joke!

  Oh, Hell, I might as well send you the Story! It's from my Book: "The
Maestro's Newsletter" and entitled: "Why Does my 912 Turn BACKWARDS???", and
is presented here slightly edited to prevent Boredom.

  If you or anyone else wants the Unedited Version, I'll be happy to E-mail
it. (Writing Books on Computers sure does have advantages- all that info
right there at your fingertips, ifin you can remember the subdirectory it's
in!)

  It all started when the Maestro rebuilt an engine for a Customer in That
Great State of Texas.

 One day, when the Maestro was imbibing his Minimum Daily Requirement of
Beer, and reading a story in "Aviation Week" about the first successful
Brilliant Pebble Test, the phone rang.

 It was the Man From Mississippi- finally about to fire up a 912 Engine the
Maestro had built a year before.

 But there was a Problem- the Engine wouldn't run!

 There was no doubt in the Maestro's mind that the 912 WOULD run- and in
fact, HAD run- for the Maestro had run it for an hour on his Test Stand in
California.

 "It's really strange," Maestro- "she's a-popping back through the
carburetors something fierce!"

 "Geez," thought the Maestro, "That's not right. It ran just fine out here!"

 "There's one thing I'd like to ask you," said the Man from Mississippi a
little sheepishly- "Uh, which way is the engine supposed to rotate?"

 "Uh-oh," thought the Maestro - "this sure sounds like one of those Trick
Questions- like on the SAT."

 "Well," said the Maestro, "when viewing the pulley from the Rear of the
Car, all 356/912 Engines Normally rotate CLOCKWISE. Like a Clock."

 "Yeah, that's what I thought too," said the Man from Mississippi. "But MAH
Engine is a-rotating the OTHER WAY!!! It's a-goin' COUNTER-CLOCKWISE!"

 "WHOA!!!" said the Maestro- "that's not right!!!"

 "I didn't think so either," said the Man from Mississippi. "What do y'all
think could be wrong?"

 The Maestro, not having confronted counter-clockwise rotating 912's before,
cogitated on the question before answering. He quarried the Data Base.
"COUNTERCLOCKWISE???" it Cried. "How the Hell can a 912 RUN
Counterclockwise???," it asked incredulously.

 Quick on its feet, the Center of Higher Reasoning jumped in- "If it's
REALLY rotating backwards- it CAN'T Run! Rotating backwards, it'll pump
Exhaust back through the Carbs! Which incidentally, explains the "a-poppin'
back through the Carbs" part."

 The Man from Mississippi interrupted the Maestro's thoughts with- "Uh,
Maestro, I've got my Mechanic with me, maybe you two can figure out what's
wrong with my 912.

 The Man From Mississippi's Mechanic (MFMM) got on the line.

 "Yeah, hey Maestro Man, bo' this is the Damndest thing Ah ever did see! The
damn engine turns over BASS-ACKWARDS!"

 Wanting to be sure that Bass-Ackwards in Mississippi was Counterclockwise
in California, the Maestro asked- You mean when the starter cranks the
engine over, the pulley turns to the Left, Not the Right?

 "Yep, to the Left, not the Right. If the "OT" mark on the Pulley is On Top,
aligned with the Timing Mark in the Case, and the Starter engaged, the
pulley moves to the LEFT!"

 "OK," said the Maestro. "But let's be Sure. I'll show you a little Trick.
Go to the Rear of the 912. Do you see a little Yellow wire over by the
Voltage Regulator that comes out of the Wiring Harness and goes nowhere?
It's got a rubber boot over a Female Spade connector."

 The Man From Mississippi looks around- and sho' 'nough finds a little
Yellow wire with an insulated Female Spade connector.

 "That's the Baby," said the Maestro. "Now, making sure that the car is Out
Of Gear, and that the Brake be on, touch that thar little Yellow wire to the
B+ "Hot Side" of the Voltage Regulator- where the Big Red Wire joins- and
the engine should crank over." Pause.

 Over the Phone the Maestro hears the Unmistakable Sound of a Porsche
Starter Cranking.

 "Dad Burn it," said Mississippi- "You're RIGHT Maestro- it DOES turn over!
Hot Damn, that's a neat idea!"

 "Yes," said the Maestro- "it's a Mechanic's Secret so that ONE Mechanic's
only (not two) can crank the engine over for Compression tests or timing
adjustment. The little Yellow wire runs right to the Solenoid Connection of
the Starter and does Absolutely Nothing unless you touch its other end to
the Hot Side of the Regulator- in which case the Starter Cranks.

 "NOW," said the Maestro- "which way does the engine turn?"

 "Honest to God, Maestro- it STILL Turns COUNTER-Clockwise!," replied the
man from Mississippi.

 The Maestro then flashed through his Data Base and remembered The Strange
Case of Mel, a Gentle Shop Owner who purchased a NEW Battery whose Terminals
had been reversed! "+" was "-" and Vice-versa.

 And BOY did the Gauges acted Strangely Indeed! All of which went away when
the Battery cables were REVERSED, and which went away permanent when the
Battery was replaced with another where "+" was "+" and "-" was "-", and
never the Twain shall meet.

 But I digress. Asked the Maestro- "you said the BATTERY has been changed
too???"

 "Yes," said Mississippi. "I replaced that too!"

 "First let us ascertain that it is NOT a "reversed Battery". Reverse the
Battery connections and try the Starter again." (KIDS! Don't try this at
home on Dad's Carrera GT Speedster!)

 The guy did- "Dad Gum it Maestro, It STILL turns Counterclockwise- and
still pops like hell outa the carburetors!"

 "I'm not surprised," said the Maestro- "even a MaestroMassaged Engine won't
run Backwards. However it WILL suck like hell from the Exhaust and try to
Pump it out the Carburetor! Which is NOT a good thing to do with gas
droplets and high-voltage Sparks all around!"

 "So whaddya think is wrong?" asked the Man From Mississippi expectantly.

 "It is my Professional Opinion," said the Maestro "that what we have have
is The Case of a BAD starter- or more likely- the WRONG starter- maybe it's
for a 914 or a VW Bus or some oddball 911?

 "Y'know said the MFMM, that's what I though too! I just was surprised as
hell to have the engine turn the Wrong Way!"

 "You're not the only one," said the Maestro- relating the Story of the
Gentle Reader back East, near "Joisey", who stuck a Corvair Engine into a VW
bus. Since Corvair Engines rotate backwards relative to Porsche Engines, the
ring gear of the VW Bus's transmission had to swapped to the other side.

 Unfortunately, this Corvair-powered VW Bus got wrecked and the Gentle
Reader made a Deal with the Junk Yard Operator to buy the parts back at a
Good Price once the Insurance Co had paid off on the claim.

 Unfortunately, the Junk Yard owner had other ideas and refused to honor the
deal.

  So, the Gentle Reader merely decided NOT to tell the Junk Yard owner about
the VW transmission mods! Vengeance was to be his.

 So, when the Junk Yard later sold the Transmission to a higher-up in the
Mob's pecking order, the sight of a VW Bus with FOUR SPEEDS in REVERSE but
only one Forward mustave been a sight to behold! As would the Junk yard
owner's kneecaps the next day!

 So, was it really be a Funky Starter?

 Yeah- it turned out that it was the WRONG Starter- a Bosch SR-27X rather
than a Bosch SR-26X for a 912. And WHAT do you think a SR-27X fits???

 Give up?

 Why, a 928!

 So, it was no surprise that a Starter for a Water Cooled, Front Engined,
Rear Wheel Drive Porsche 928 just might turn the Opposite way from an
Air-cooled, Rear Engined, Rear Wheel drive Porsche 912 made 20 years
previously!

 The Maestro was amazed that after all these years and all those differences
that the 928 Starter FIT in the 912!!!

 But all's well that end's well. And with the RIGHT starter, the 912 sprang
unhesitatingly to live. 

 The Man from Mississippi became a Believer. Because he had:



      KEPT THE 356/912 FAITH!!!

It seems to me that if you install the camshaft backwards and use a backwards
starter, you could get an engine to run backwards (badly). The fix would
not be as simple as figuring out that you are in reverse and putting on
the right starter, though. It really doesn't sound like the kind of mistake
that a pro race car builder is going to make.

Are you absolutely sure about that???  My '82 SC has an 85MPH speedo.  If
memory serves me, this was during the oil embargo days when the national
55MPH speed limit went into effect and the DOT decided that if the speedo
only goes up to 85, people will go slower and use less gas.  Of course,
this was 14 years and many millions of brain cells ago, so FWIW....

Subject: 915 Transmission

Last June, I purchased my '86 911 w/10,700 miles, which came with the factory 
used-car warranty.

I've had a fairly consistent problem with grinding/crunching while engaging 
first or reverse gears while stopped.  I recently took it to the dealer where 
I purchased it and had the service manager drive it with me in the car.  He did 
not have the problem.

I have been driving manual transmissions since '54, don't ride the clutch, do 
engage the clutch fully before engaging first or reverse, and am worried that 
this problem could haunt me in days to come (say, this june 30th, the day after 
the warranty expires...)

Any useful thoughts would be greatly appreciated...  Thanks, Bart

Subject: Wrecked 930 part II, Another 930

The car I described in "Wrecked 930" is quite a junkpile. It has been wrecked
more than once, the hood is full of bondo, and, to tell you the type of guy
who owns the car, plastic strips with the words "PUT DOWN HANDBRAKE, YOU DUMMY!"
are stuck to the tach. What sacrilege to treat the near-supercar-status 930
with such disregard. The guy still owns it and it is not for sale by the
insurance company as I thought.

So I found another Turbo...

I talked to the guy that owns the bodyshop (a friend of mine) who has
two turbos: a black gray-market 1984 Turbo, and a white 1978 Turbo which he
has been driving lately. Both cars are gorgeous. While talking to him about
the red 930, he told me that the white 1978 was for sale for $24,000.

It's a one-owner car with 42,204 original miles. It's clean as a whistle. No
rust, the bodywork is in perfect condition, the interior is perfect, and the
engine is spotless. It's not leaking any oil and you could eat off the bottom
of the engine, which is surprising since it doesn't have the late lower rocker
covers. No running problems other than a faulty warm-up regulator which just
slows down cold starting. It doesn't have Carrera tensioners, and since it's
pre-1980 1/2 I think it needs them.

So, is $24,000 really a "steal" for this car? I've seen 1978 Turbos for sale
for $28,00 and up. It is in excellent shape, remember. The car only has 42,204
miles and it hasn't been driven hard (70-year old owned it and treated it
well). Do these engines hold up a long time? Will it need rebuilding before
100,000 miles?

Again, any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

The NHTSA (USA) required 85mph speedo's from sometime in the '70's

You see, with 85mph speedo's, we wouldn't want to speed.  Yah, that's it!

Bart,

What you want to do is convert your 8x16 BBS wheels to the 944 Turbo
offset and mount 225/45R16 tires. This will allow you lower your
car about as far as you want and keep 8x16 wheels on the front.

This is basically what I have done on my '78 911SC. I have 8x16 944
Turbo Fuchs on the front with 225/45R16 tires and 9x16 Fuchs on the
rear with 245/45R16 tires. You do not have to roll fender lips.

By using the 944 Turbo offset, most of the increase in width is
toward the inside part of the car thus allowing the 8 inch rims.

My apologies.  John was right.  I should have known better.  I compared
last night and the turbo-look tie rods are identical to the std Carrera.
I learned from Raman (ramans@microsoft.com) that this detail is
significant since SCCA Solo 2 (autocross) racers are allowed to use
any parts that came on any car from the SAME LINE (which is basically
all 911s, 65-89).  Turbo's are a different line.

Hi Chris.  I have a Rhode Gear Euroshuttle.  It fits my 944 perfectly.  It holds
two bikes facing forward in a classic fork-mount position.  The bikes are very
stable.  I have used it with a variety of bikes and all of them have fit without
any problems.  (My current off-road mount is a 1993 Specialized M2 Team Issue
and my road bike is a 1984 Bianchi Record.)

The rack rests on the car on two cushioned supports which rest on the rear
bumper and on two cushioned supports which rest about two-thirds of the way up
the hatch.  The rack is attached to the car at six points with straps which have
rubber-coated hooks at the ends.  Two hook under the back of the rear bumper.
Two hook over the top edge of the hatch.  Two hook under the sides of the rear
bumper.

The first time I set the rack up and installed it on the car, it took about half
an hour.  However, after the first time, taking it off the car and putting it
back on only takes a few seconds.  It folds up flat and can be stored in a very
small space.

Hope all this is helpful.  If you want to get a permanently fixed roof rack
(which has the advantage of comparatively secure locking mechanisms. I recommend
Yakima, Thule, and Terzo.  The disadvantage with all of these is that the bikes
are mounted much higher, which is less aerodynamic, exposes your bikes to more
bug splatter, and prevents you from driving into garages and underground parking
lots.  It's also harder to lift a bike higher.  With the Euroshuttle, the bike
sits much lower, partially in the slipstream of the car itself, and I have no
trouble driving four levels down in my apartment building's garage.

If you have any further questions, just let me know.

Why don't you have the wheels polished and then clear-coated?  My cookie cutters
have black centres but the rims have been polished to a very high sheen.  Both
the centres and the rims have been completely clear-coated and they look
fabulous.  I don't think they ever looked this good even when the car was brand
new.  To keep them looking that way, I just wipe them down with a sponge soaked
in soapy water and then rinse.

   Are you absolutely sure about that???  My '82 SC has an 85MPH speedo.  If

   55MPH speed limit went into effect and the DOT decided that if the speedo

   Drew

I had an '83 944 made in early 1982.  It had a 150 (or there abouts)
speedo.  A number of 944's came with 85mph speedos.  There ended up being a
lot of mysterious defects in some of the 85mph speedos.  My understanding
was that was the year that they switched back to the 150 speedos and some
cars got them and some didn't.

That's the best argument I've seen for modifying an original Porsche.
How can anyone live with an 85 mph speedo in a 911?  Are there
really Porsche drivers out there that have never gone faster than that?
Or do they just not care to know by how much they've exceeded the speed

There is a pyramid selling organisation here in the US selling something
similar. It may even be imaged as a "chip" but it is in fact simply a 
double sided printed circuit board plug mounted in a case each of the
contacts on the plug is attached to a length of wire. The key a piece of
PC board with a plastic encapsulated handle pushes in the plug mounted
on the dash. The PC board key completes eight circuits through the plug
allowing you to disable up to eight vital function of the car. Very low
tech despite the ads but could be very effective. Really depends on the smarts 
the person who installs it. Could be easy to defeat if only static voltages
are used but if some engine management functions were routed through it
it could be difficult to beat. Believe it's patented or applied for in England
(amazing what you can patent these days - I bet Einstein wouldn't have let them
by). But its easy to build your own. Of course the key can make any terminal 
to any terminal of the plug (lots of combinations).

They also make one for commercial vehicles where a barrel lock is used to
make the 60 amp circuits. I believe the car version is rated at 30 amps.

They were looking for garages/shops to install the kits at a terrific mark up.

On the other hand, my car uses the fuel filter from an '81 but the

>From what I understand, the first gear synchro only works in one direction:
it only winds up the countershaft, it won't slow it down (or maybe the
other way around?). 
In other words: when the car is not moving, clutch
engaged, transmission in neutral, and you press the clutch pedal and
try to put it in first, the countershaft is still spinning (and therefore all 
the forward gears are too); it must come to a stop before engaging the
output shaft, which is stopped. The 1st gear synchro won't do this.
On the other hand, if the output shaft (and therefore the car) is moving
faster than the countershaft, the synchro will speed up the countershaft
to match the output shaft's speed.

Engage first when stopped by pressing gently on the shift lever.

Reverse gear doesn't have any synchros.

Can someone else confirm all this?

happen, I figure I'll at least be happier about it if I can sell
to my other "family".  Offers, intersting trades considered.

If you're serious about buying, shoot me a note and I'll fill in

But then, you've been reading about them on this list for a while too...

All cars are in Houston. 

Here goes:

1981 Euro 911SC Targa, Grand Prix white with blue Op Art interior.
Super fast, tweaked for *streetable* performance. Lots of goodies.
$13,000.

1963 356SC. Ruby Red with black leatherette interior. Third owner.
*INTERESTING* history on this one. Fresh "Elmerized" engine, new
everything. Nearly rust-free. *GREAT* driver. "Birth certificate", 
all numbers match. Some spares, other 356 parts available.
$16,000.

1974 914 2.0 racer. Orange. Decals, numbers (SOWDIV 13ITA). 
Race car interior.  *COULD* be streetable, but would take work for that.
(It *IS* titled, licensed, and inspected for street use in Texas...)
Instead, it's the fastest 914 I've ever seen in SCCA Improved Touring.
(maybe Production, now that I think about it... For sure if  you ran slicks)
Over 150 HP. Best of everything. New everything (from wheel bearings up!).
I'll even tell you how I did it all.... Current log book. Haven't looked
where it fits in PCA Club Racing yet, but since you can embarrass 911s
in it, you'll probably be happy whereever it goes.... Spares come with it.
$10,000.

From reading an old archive file on the 915 Transmission, I remember that it
said that it lacked a little part inside that actually brakes the spinning
countershaft inside the trans. As a result, if you engage 1st right after you
put the clutch in you will grind gears. You must engage clutch, wait about a
second for the shaft to stop spinning and then go into 1st gear.

Most other trans have this "brake" feature. Reverse gear has no synchro and
like most cars, you will have to wait until things slow down. THis is a common
feature of all cars.

Does anyone know whay Porsche left this out of their trans? Is it only on the
911 family of trans?  Were they trying to eliminate frictional losses and thus
extract the most from their drivetrains?

    Thanks to those that responded to my original posting re my
    friend's 2.4 motor that is for sale.  I spoke with him yesterday
    and have some points to clarify: First of all, the injection has
    NOT been rebuilt.  This is a description as I understand it:

    New Mahle 2.4S pistons and cylinders
    New S cams
    New valve guides installed in heads
    Ported/flowed heads (S Specs)
    New valves
    New gasket set
    All new bearings
    New Carrera chain tensioner set
    New Turbo valve cover set (upper and lower)
    Fully counter-weighted/balanced crank
    Re-bushed rods
    Entire engine assembly balanced
    New Weber 40 IDAs (and manifolds)

    T case (no modifications)
    T injection
    Engine oil cooler
    Powder coated (black) sheet metal
    All other parts (shrouding, cam housing, etc.)

    The engine is currently apart and available in the Washington,
    D.C. area (I do travel to Massachusetts on occasion).

    For more information, or for putting in a bid, give me a call or
    post your name and number.

Subject: Backwards Porsche Challenge

I think we may have something here. After all, technology has 
proceeded to the point where any number of highly qualified
engineers can wicker 356 engines to the point of near-theoretical
output. That's not hard any more. 

BUT getting an engine to run..backwards..successfully could be
more of a challenge!

So how about this: Maestro and Albrecht both tune their 356 
engines to run *backwards* to the best of their talents -- and 
then race to decide who can tune engines better? To give an 
international flair, I donate the use of "Mr. Jones' Driveway," 
a 20-meter mostly downhill mostly paved stretch, one hour from Venice,
Italy. Local cops don't mind if you exceed 15 kmph, just watch 
out for the wall at the end. Winner takes home the loser, or 
an inflatable sex toy -- his choice.

SCHMIDT@LNS62.LNS.CORNELL.EDU querried about establishing a list of recommended 
shops to use or avoid.  Damn fine idea, IMHO.  Here's my offering:

In Annapolis, MD, there is on place like "Tri-Tech" for Porsche/Audi/BMW
ask for Barry Fisher or Jim Felsky (410) 224-4377.  Honest and competent, 
Reasonable prices.  They are the only folks I allow to touch my '86 911 or
my '87 Syncro.

Before I was directed to them, the local dealer told me I needed cv joints on 
all axles of my Syncro.  As I had not noticed anything unusual, I decided to 
defer the work for a month or so.  Shortly thereafter I was sent to TT and I 
asked them to do the cv joint work.  They told me I was being led down the 
proverbial garden path and my cv joints were fine.  I could go no, but you get 
the point...

No idea.  According to my tech spec booklet, for MY84 Porsche changed
the Carrera to use a right-hand turning distributor, while the Turbo

Rumour has it that several years ago, a maverick software co. founder was 
in court for his 2nd speeding ticket over 120mph in a Porsche in Santa Cruz 
county.  The judge asked him what kind of car he had, and he replied "a 
German car" to which the judge (a female) replied, "What kind of German 
car, Mr. Kahn?" to which he replied, "A Porsche." 

The judge then asked "Would you tell the court that you never exceed 
55mph in your Porsche?" He then looks at his lawyer, his lawyer is 
shaking his head, and he says nothing.  Judge suspends his license for 6 
months, he has to have a limo drive him to/from work.

There are some pretty other wild driving stories with this guy...

I don't think that is really a great price.  Low mileage is nice, but

Subject:  Theft Protection (Ben Evans)

The problem with disablers is that if they can't start the car they may trash
it. Not desirable! It also does not cope with the problem of car jacking
since this implies that you are with the car. The ideal solution is somthing
like lojack which activates a transmitter in the car when it is reported
stolen. The car can then be tracked with suitable equipment. The problem I have
with this is that as far as I know its a one off charge of approx $500. I think
this is a problem. Remember a few years ago lifetime membership at the health
clubs. Mad rush - no ongoing income - chapter 11. What gurantees the funding
of the ongoing maintenance. The alternative solution is a silent aarm which
when tripped will allow the car to be driven for a short while before disabling
the car and sounding the alarm. I suppose a manufacturer would have to consider
how to disable the car. They might get sued if they just cut the ignition and
an accident ensued. But with modern engine management system it should be
possible for them to make the car impossible to drive, certainly flee while 
still being safe. No one is going to hang around a crippled car with lights and
siren going.

Anyone know of such a device or adapted one of the currently marketed ones to
behave this way?

Fellow Porschephiles,
I need to put new rear springs and 4 shock absorbers on my 1973 914 2.0
with factory sway bars. I want to preserve the stock ride "quality" (ha!). 
Three questions:
1) What shocks and springs preserve stock handling characteristics and are
good value for money?
2) What other suspension parts are convenient and necessary to replace at
the same time?
3) Do I need to release tension on the front torsion bars, as indicated in
the Haynes manual, to install the front shocks, or is there a simpler way?
4) Does a 914 with a more compliant suspension necessarily handle worse
than one with a stiffer suspension?

Bart,

Have you considered buying lower profile front tires such as 
225/45-16 Dunlop SP8000's for the front?  Would the size reduction
be sufficient to permit lowering?  I recently switched
to Dunlop 225/45-16 SP 8000's on factory 7x16 rims on my '89 951 S.  The 
factory tire size is 225/50-16, but I prefer the stiffer sidewall
of the 45 series tires.  They presumably would work even better on 8x16 rims.

- -- Corky Cartwright


P.S.  As far as I know, D40/M2's are not available in size 225/45-16.  But
I like the SP8000 a bit better than the D40/M2 (my previous tires).

914's do the same. Instead of waiting the couple of seconds before engaging

the spinning gears and then engage 1st or reverse. Faster and no clashing.

I've seen this in use as well.  The part that goes into your car, the IR receiver
and timer and multi-lap memory sells for about $169.  I don't know what the IR transmitter
sells for, but it seems that someone at the track always has a transmitter so that people
with the receivers can use their timer.  You only need one transmitter, since all it does
is transmit an IR beam that the receiver in your car picks up.  All the rest is in your
car.

I don't own one but a number of people in GGR do.

Subject: No Headlights

Well I'm experiencing my first problem on the '73 S.  Last night when driving 
to my friends house I noticed that my right low beam went out.  Since the left
one was not working (sellers mechanic said that the he put a new left bulb in
and fuse is okay, so left one has a short somewhere) that means I had now 
low beams at all.  Parking lights and tail lights are okay, as well as
brake lights and back-ups.  Anyway, I tried the high beams (pushed turn signal
lever towards dash). No high beams either.  I checked the fuses in FUSE PANEL
#2 in trunk. FUSE 4, I think was open and FUSE 1-3 all looked weak.  So I replaced all 4 and voila, still nothing, now low or high beams.  I had to drive
home with my hand pulling back on the turn signal lever.  This lit the high 
beams so I know the bulbs aren't the culprit.

Any ideas where I should start to diagnose this problem?  Anyone know where 
I can get an electrical schematic for a '73 911S?

Thanks in advance for the help.  I'll be in Jamaica till 6/1.  Leaving tomorrow.

Subject: Re: Intake manifold-Vacuum Line fitting

If this hose is the soft rubber one I think it is, then the problem
is that it tends to harden with age and heat, and swell from oil
breathed on it from the manifold.  Replace it and you should be all
set.  If you're really fussy, put a baby tie-wrap around it.

You can spend $2-3 a pop for each of the little rubber elbows from
Porsche, or you can buy a foot or two of generic hose from the corner
autoparts store and cut to fit.  I haven't been able to find generic
"Y" fittings, which are about $5.80 from Porsche.

Good goal.

If all you want is stock, then by damn, the *RIGHT* answer is simple:
buy stock parts! However, if you're looking at the plethora of aftermarket
parts, this may be daunting. First things first: call your local dealer,
or Carlsen in Palo Alto (which I think gives PCA and *maybe* porschephiles
discounts -- reality check on that please?) and get prices for stock 
springs. That's an 85 lb spring, btw... Then shop around. If you want a
stock or near stock ride, *DO NOT* get any of the 100-140-180 lbs 
"performance" springs.

There is another very good alternative: Troutman makes a 165 lb progressive
spring. At low excursion, it's about a 90 lb spring. At high excursion, it's
a 165 lb spring. There is of course a linear transition between the two. 
For a street car that gets "spirited" street driving, some autox, etc. it's
just about perfect. 

> 2) What other suspension parts are convenient and necessary to replace at
> the same time?

Consider shocks. If you want a stock ride, there's no substitute for Boge.
If you want improved performance, things start getting better at KYB (which
is usually cheaper than Boge, BTW) and go up through Koni, Bilistein, and
end up at Koni sport yellows... each with progressively "worse" ride.

Also consider new front torsion bars. I highly recommend that for street
cars you stick with the stock diameter. There's just no percentage in 
getting bigger, since any change has a BIG impact -- positive in terms of
handling at the limit, negative in terms of ride quality. (torsion bars
get stiffer as the 4th power of the diameter...)

Finally, consider new tires. Nothing like a fresh set of Yoko 509s or
AVS Intermediate to make your car feel and drive like new... 185/75x15 for
a softer ride, 195/50x15 for the best in performance.

> 3) Do I need to release tension on the front torsion bars, as indicated in
> the Haynes manual, to install the front shocks, or is there a simpler way?

First off, it's not that big of a deal to release the tension. Second, I
usually find that I don't need to do that -- just separate the strut from
the ball joint (NOTE: if you use the little "fork" looking ball joint
seperator, you *WILL* need to replace the ball joint. Take a big screwdriver
and insert it in the "split" at the bottom of the strut, and widen that
until the strut slips off. Don't beat on it, or you may bend the strut 
housing...).

> 4) Does a 914 with a more compliant suspension necessarily handle worse
> than one with a stiffer suspension? 

Yes. Period. But it may not matter if you're not pushing the limits of
the car. Just doing street driving, it's pretty much OK as is. Going to
say KYBs and the Troutman springs will put you in a *VERY* satisfactory
position.

Subject: Resolution of 944 Right-Rear "Whirring"


Just a short posting to close the loop on and to thank the people who helped 
with this issue.  The "right-rear whirring" was indeed the wheel bearings.  
Once the right tools were collected:
              1) 36mm socket (wheel nut)
	      2) 8mm 12pt. serrated wrench (half-shaft bolts)
              3) Heavy-duty snap-ring pliers (inner bearing retaining clip)

and the parts:
              1) Inner bearing                 $13
              2) Outer bearing and inner race  $30
              3) Inner seal                    $ 2

The job was straight forward.

An interesting side note is that I did not realize that the car had adjustable
Koni shocks...they were on the softest setting.  I set them to their stiffest
setting... makes a VERY noticeable difference.

The shaft diameter scales with the torque rating.

Subject: re: Headlights

Speaking of headlights, this info may save 914 people some time or traffic
citations.  Of the 2 914's I've had (in the salty northeast) the screws
for the headlight retaining ring have rusted and are so small (phillips)
and soft that I've stripped them all trying to get the ring off to change
the headlights.

This weekend, while putting in some halogens I've had lying around, of
course it got really involved.  I suggest, before you need to change a
bulb, to put in some more reasonable hardware to hold the retaining ring.
What I had to do was back out both adjusting screws, and remove the spring,
which allowed the whole assembly to come out (oh yeah, first take off the
plastic surround).  Then with a dremel tool, grind off the heads of the
3 screws holding the retaining ring.  Remove the retaining ring and the
headlight.  Now you can grind the screws a little more, apply some penetrant,
and back them out by grabbing the threads with vice grips.  I found in my
box of old porsche hardware, some screws of the same thread, but with a
larger head for a flat blade screw driver.

Subject: HELP!  Removal of 911 Front Fender

Hello!

I have to remove the front left fender on my '75 911 to properly repair some 
minor rust.  The glue holding the rubber seal let go and let some water get down to
where it's not supposed to go!  I think this was the result of using a two-piece
bra so...  if you use one, check the rubber seal!

To the point:

1.  I have everything loose and the fender is moving around nicely.  However, it 
seems to be spot welded up near the top of the door jamb.  Two questions:  a) why?
and b)  how do I properly undo/redo this spot weld?  (note:  I have cut-offs/
grinders/welders/etc.  I'm looking for some advice from someone who's done it.)

2.  I noticed that Wueth has some zinc paint and some primer w/ zinc.  Should I
use both when doing the paint repair?  What's the net's opinion on these products?

3.  What is the caulking-like substance between the fender and body and where can
I get that stuff for the reassembly?

4.  What about the nice, heavy undercoating that's over everything?  What is it, 
where can I find it, and what's a good way to apply small amounts of it?

Thanks for the help!  Oh, just curious...  Are the fenders still bolt-on for the
new 993?  I didn't notice when I went to the dealer last month.  I was more
interested in the test drive of the new Cabriolet they had!  What a car!  Va-room!

>All this talk about backward running engines reminds me of the

    distributor runs backwards (compared to the pre 78 and post 83
    cars).  Does anyone know why Porsche did this?  Also, how did they
    do it, did they merely put different gears on the crank and
    distributor?

================================================================

The story I heard, and forgive me for the sketchy details, is that the gear 
that drives the distributor on pre-'78 cars was one of the last vestiges of
"VW" parts in a 911.  I think someone at the factory decided that that
just wouldn't do, and so the distributors were changed for the SCs.  If I
remember the *story* correctly, someone at the factory was asked about
the validity of this and they hemmed and hawed and scraped the carpet
with the toe of their shoe, but didn't really deny it.

Howdy!

The car is an '87 944 with 50k miles.  Engine is in excellent
condition.

Here's the problem:
With the engine running at mid to upper rpms, take your foot
of the gas, as the engine returns to idle it will often drop down to a
few hundred rpms before it comes back to normal idle.  This is very
noticable with the a/c compressor running.

Some of you may recognize this as a symptom of running a little too
rich.

Here's what I've done so far:

 -Checked for intake leaks.
 -Unplugged and checked lamda sensor--didn't help the problem but it
runs a little better unplugged.
 -Checked engine temp and intake air sensors.
 -Checked idle speed control.
 -Checked speed and reference mark sensors.

Everything looks ok.  I have no clue how to check the air flow sensor
proper, but I did follow the short test procedure from the shop manual
and it checked out.

Thanks,

Doug b.

Hey, where do I get one of those stickers. The handbrake-on-warning light is 
really hard to see from the driver seat. And if one drives with the hand brake

possible bad carrier bearings to interior color schemes.  It
drives fine - it's a lot of fun.  I guess the rear shock valves

I have some parts that may interest a few members. In brief; engine not
assembled, 901 5-speed, complete engine cooling tin. Engine parts; Arias
pistons/total seal rings(from Competition Engr.) Norris cam kit. Engine
complete minus smog equip,oil cooler,Solex. Have one pair new in the box
Weber IDF-XE Plus 44mm carbs & manifolds. Have one pair Weber IDF old style
40mm, 28mm venturii, 32mm venturii,K&N, extra jets,stock manifolds etc.
E-mail me for more complete list. Some parts new never assembled, others used
but good.                Please dont come down on me too harshly, i like
other German metal also and i need some help. While rebuilding my 912, I
purchased a 73 Opel GT. I did not love it at first but they will grow on you.
I have since purchased a 70 GT, and a 71 GT. The Germans like these cars and
have all kinds of aftermarket parts for them. I sure would like to contact
some one in Germany on the net who would be willing to act as a source for
the parts that are hard to get here. A contact at the Adam Opel factory would
be great! I am aware of Lenk GmbH, Irmscher, and Steinmetz. Thanks for any
help you may choose to extend me. I would not trouble you with this but
obviously there is no Opel list. There were only 70,000 GT cars manufactured
so there is not much of a following here. zadok7000@aol.com

Subject: Helmuth Bott, 1925-1994

The German news wires just carried an item announcing that Helmuth Bott,
former chief of Porsche's Weissach R&D facility, has passed away at the age
of 68 after a short illness.
 
Helmuth Bott was one of the handful of people who made Porsche what it is
today. Most of the things we as Porschephiles enjoy in today's 911, 968
and 928 were developed while he was chief engineer at Weissach. Herr Bott
joined the company in 1952, after brief jobs with Daimler-Benz and Bosch,
and retired just a few years ago. His first major project was development of
the suspension for the 356 A, worked on the team that made the 917 (among
many other projects in a long career), and was chief engineer from 1971 (?)
until his retirement. Any Porsche you can think of, whether road or race car,
was influenced by Helmuth Bott and a very small handful of others.
 
I had the privilege of working at Weissach during a few of the Bott years,
and can honestly say that he was a great engineer and a very
approachable human being. Any employee at Weissach could go into his office
to talk shop. Even in retirement, he continued with the work he
loved most, as a consulting engineer and designer. He'll be missed. When you
drive your Porsche today, remember the man who led the engineering team that
brought you this most excellent of machines.

Two strokes (yes), four strokes (no).  Many years ago, I picked up a new
Bultaco (two stroke) motorcycle in Barcelona.  It was sputtering and
popping at idle as two strokes do.  Half an hour later in rush hour
traffic, it eased backwards when I let out the clutch at a stop light.
Light flywheel and a single backfire could reverse its direction.

In a Porsche, you have to alter the differential to reverse its direction.
The VW bus needed this alteration because of the reduction gears at the
wheels.  You also have to make the change for a Corvair Engine (backwards).

Hi Group,

An article in my local paper says troopers will replace their HAWK radars with
KA band radars "which don't set off most detectors," and while the HAWK can
detect speed heading away or toward the trooper the new system "can not detect
speed of motorists traveling in the same direction."

Does anyone know what the KA band radar is and why it won't "set off most
detectors." According to the article the new radar costs $2,050 per unit
compared with $2,600 for the HAWK.

Are they talking about the "instant on" or the laser radar? The article isn't
very clear and doesn't give much information.

Subject: List of Shops

P'philes,
	I think that it is an excellent idea to put together a list
of preferred (and non-preferred) shops.  I woul of course perfer to
do all of the work on my car myself but sometimes time and facility
constraints do not allow this.  Anyway here is my $.02 worth.
	Recommended:
	Europa Imports
	1007 Tower Road
	Winetka, IL 60093
	(708)  446-9500
	They really only do mechanical work on BMW and Mercedes but will
do body work on just about anything and Mike (co-owner) drives a 930 so
he has a soft spot for Porsches.  They have done more work on my 944
than I care to think about and my uncle has been taking his 535i and 300E
there for years with no complaints.

	NOT Recommended:
	The Exchange (Porsche Dealer)
	2050 1st St.
	Highland Park, IL
	I had a HORRIBLE experience here and judging from the conversation
I overheard the shop manager having with another customer I am not alone.
These people claimed to perform the 2 year maintenance but failed to change
either the brake or transmission fluid.  They also dinged my paint while
replacing the clutch and water pump and returned the car filthy dirty
(it was clean when it went in).  I wrote them a letter telling them what I
thought of their service department and I recieved an offer of a free
detailing. I would not let any of those people touch my car ever again.

	I would love to hear other's experiences with these or any other
	shops.

Steve,
  I have run both the stock 205/55ZR16 / 225/50ZR16 as well as the 
225/50, 245/45 combination. While you will notice the extra grip, of course,
you will also find that turn-in is a little slower with wider tires. Also, on
the street, there is much more tendency for the wider rubber to "track"
longitudinal pavement irregularities (here in Vermont there are lots of
"widened" two lane roads where the right wheels run along the seam of the old
and new pavement). Nonetheless, everyone I see at the track seems to run the
wider widths. A friend suggested over the winter trying a bit more toe-in
with the wider rubber, but I haven't tried this yet.

The 225s on the front 7" rims do seem to be the maximum width advisable on
that narrow a wheel (I don't know if a wider wheel will work at the stock
offset). At the rear, I think that wider than 245 will require rolling the
inner fender lip for clearance.

914 Trunk Pad
    I asked this question before, but my mail connection died 
right after so I never saw any replies...

    I (somehow!) have the original rear trunk pad for my 74 2.0L.
The pad is made of some sort of foam/whatever with a plastic or
rubber coating.  The coating has cracked across one side (from
the heat, I'm sure...) and is peeling off in big chunks.  What
kind of glue would you recommend to help put it back together?
    Also:  I'm thinking of putting a hole in the pad, so that I
can fasten the spare tire down in the rear trunk. (more space up
front!  Yaay!)  I'll probably need to put something on the newly
cut sides of the hole to keep the above-mentioned coating from
peeling away there.  Recommendations for that?  (probably just
put more glue on it, right?)  Anyone know how the Factory did 
these holes when they did 'em?

I have had experience with Leland West.  Their prices are very good if
you fit their catagories in terms of mileage, home ownership, 2nd
car, etc.  The best thing about Leland West is that you declare the car's
value.  They also speak our language, which is nice.

It turns out I didn't use them because I found another very good policy
with Liberty Mutual, and when I insured all 3 cars and the house I was
better off.  But I was very impressed with Leland West and their rates.

Dear Porschephiles,

How do you raise the front edge of the Targa roof?  

Locking the Targa roof in place in my 1981 911SC pulls the front edge of
the roof below the roofline causing some distortion of the vinyo roof and
threatening to shear off Targa roof handles.   

Stoddards says they rebuilt the roof to factory specifications. 
Nevertheless, I am not trying to put the roof on a TransAm or some other
Ersatz-Targa.  I am sure Porsche thought of some adjustements that can be
made to fit the roof to the the particular car.  

Is there someone out there who can guide me through these adjustments?

Much obliged.

Ok .. for all of us fast drivers ;)

There are three bands (microwave freq. ranges) allowed for by the FCC

	X-Band	10.x Ghz

	K-Band  20 something Ghz

	Ka-Band 30 something Ghz ..

The INTERESTING thing about Ka .. is that the FCC authorized a WIDE
area around 34 Ghz or so for use by police radar .. hence guns came out
that try a new frequency every time the trigger is pulled .. aka 
WIDEBAND Ka .. aka THE STALKER .. 

To detect this, you need a wideband Ka detector .. a simple photo-radar
capable detector will NOT do !!

BELtronics, Escort, and Valentine Research (among others) all make 
good wideband KA detectors ..

I hate to be negative but....

I normally do my own work on my 73 2.0L 914 but sometimes you just gotta
take it in.  Late last summer I had finally finished rebuilding the top
end of the engine and was having a cut-out problem that I couldn't solve. 
The engine would run fine sometimes and then run extremely rich or
extremely lean for no apparant reason and then cut out altogether.  I
must have checked grounds, timing, fuel and spark a dozen times.

To make a long story even longer, the last test drive we went out on we
stalled and no amount of jiggling could get her going again.  I lost my
patients at that point and had the car towed to the Porsche dealer.  While
finding an extra car in your service lot with no warning may not be
polite, once the paper work is done all should be cool.

I found the mechanic who worked on my car to be knowlegeable and friendly,
even informative.  The problem turned out to be a $35 cylinder head
temperature sensor (I'm sure some of you have already guessed this).  Turns
out taking the car in was the right decision since I don't have the test
equipment for this kind of trouble shooting or enough know how regarding
the FI system.  The car runs great now with the exception of a little
backfiring/burbling on deceleration.   This little tune up cost me 600
bucks!  Maybe thats' reasonable?

What really bugged me is that it took 3.5 weeks for them to fix the car! 
By the time I got it back it was time to put it away for the winter. 
These guys said they had the car in and out of the garage several time. 
Can't say as I believed them because every time I checked it was in
exactly the same spot.?

Anyhow, if you're ever in Ottawa Canada and you have trouble with your
Porsche or Audi I'd recommend you avoid :

		Mark Motors of Ottawa (1987) Ltd.
		611 Montreal Rd.
 Unfortunately they are the only "authorized" dealer in town.


For what it's worth.

Having much more fun this year.

detectors." According to the article the new radar costs $2,050 per unit
compared with $2,600 for the HAWK.

Are they talking about the "instant on" or the laser radar? The article isn't
very clear and doesn't give much information.

>ED, The Newer Models, such as the Passport 4500 (Which I have) are very capable

For places to avoid in the bay area for smogging, I'd recommend staying 
away from the Quality Tune Up on El Camino and San Antonio in Mtn. View.  

3 weeks ago, I took my girlfriend's Tercel and my '77 911 there for smog 
checks.  The guy took a look at my engine and said "that ain't gonna pass"

I then slapped the smog belt on, and said "try it now, it's my $20.00", 
and he said "it still ain't gonna pass" so I kept my $20.

A half hour later the guy comes back to where we're sitting and smiles 
"The Toyota failed too"  We left, I cleaned the carb, got a new air 
filter for the '87 Tercel, and took it back the next week, the re-check 
is free.  It failed again.  I then took it last week, a mile down the 
street to AccuTune on Miramonte (Shoreline) and El Camino and left it 
there for a check, tune-up, check, and then air conditioning. 

The first check failed, but with much better numbers than Quality's tune 
up, though a week of time and some driving was in between the tests.  
After their tune up, it passed easily.  Whole price was $180, about $50 
for tune up, $30 for smog, and $100 for 2lb. of freon.  I'll probably 
take my 911 there too.

Bottom line is that this whole Calif. smog check and supposed calibration 
is a lot of horse shit.  I'd love to take some time, and drive down El 
Camino from San Francisco to San Jose and measure the discrepanicies in 
all of these fucked up smog certifer's equipment.  What a crock.

Does anyone have the factory specs for the 93 C2 alignment 
numbers. I need the camber,caster, and toe. I brought my C2 in 
for alignment and the shop had a brand new Hunter setup. When 
they put my car up they could not get more than -.5 camber on 
the back wheels. The Hunter specs had a range of -.82 to -.5 
for the back. (I was trying for -1.0 for autocross). The Hunter 
specs on the front were -.17 to .17. Also I had a problem with 
the front caster. The Hunter specs called for 4.17 to 4.67 and 
the shop could only get 3.4. I suspect either the Hunter specs 
are wrong for my 93 C2 or the equipment is out of adjustment. 
The spec that is listed on the Hunter equipment lists the 89-92 
C2 & C4 as having the same numbers. Could this be true. Thanks

If you live in a state that Westfield insures thru, they take Porsches, and

There were three different types of Speedsters, not counting plastic fakes.
The first was on the 356 body, a basic no-frills car with minimalist
interior and cut-down windshield. It was built concurrently with the 356
Cabriolet, which has a taller windshield and more substantial interior
equipment. The 356 Speedster evolved into the Convertible D with more
equipment, and then the Roadster. Note that many people call all open 356s
"Speedsters" but that isn't right. Speedsters are special models and are
more desirable. You need to go to Speedsterfest; BIll Oldham wrote

>The 1994 SPEEDSTERFEST will again take place
>at Cal State Hayward on Sunday, June 19, 1994.



Next there was the 1989 Speedster, built with a 911 body. It also had a
cut-down windshield, and used the "wide body" 911 Turbo body pieces.
 
The latest is the 1994 Speedster, with a narrow body. It's the cheapest way
to get an open 911. There are no plans yet to make it in the new 993 body
style.

You don't have to live here long to figure out that the California smog check is 
just a way to forcibly transfer money from your wallet to the station doing the
check. Yes, it's a crock. If you ever saw what car companies have to go
through in terms of high-class measuring equipment to get realistic
emissions numbers, you'll realize that the toys used by gas stations are
nothing more than random number generators.
 
I've had the same idea -- go up and down the coast to have stations check a
car which has previously been proven to pass -- using EPA (not California
CARB) certified laboratory equipment.
 
The entire biennial smog check is a crock. If your car doesn't pass, you can
still drive it by proving that repair will cost more than a certain amount,
I forgot what, let's say $300. Any valve or ring job is going to cost more
than that, even a custom-fit catalyst will be more, so basically all the
gross polluters continue grossly polluting, after paying off the station to
the tune of $300. The system feels this is OK because you've done your
penance, and another 300 of your dollars have gone to feed the economic
recovery or whatever. The gas station stays in business a while longer, 
but the air doesn't get any less browner.
 
A friend had a problem with a Jaguar XJ-6. Too high HC. I told him before he
went in that his catalyst was probably shot, with it the oxygen sensor, and
he might need a valve job. We figured we'd try a "pass or don't pay" Arco
station first. Of course it didn't pass. We managed to keep the
semi-literate former cabbie-type from dicking with the injection system.
(How they read shop manuals is beyond me; far as I know they're only written
in English). After failing, he did offer to "feex" for ninety dallah. Right.
Valve job and cat for ninety dallah. No, thanks.
 
He had a burned valve and it cost nearly $1000 at a Jaguar independent.
 
This whole thing raises an interesting vision of life under the Clinton health
care plan -- will smog station operators be able to upgrade their
certification to do surgery on humans? <g>

Another interesting ripoff -- if you move to California from out of state, 
you have to pay a one-time fee, I think $300 or so, billed as some sort
of "non-California vehicle compliance tax" or something. They bill this
on ALL late model (post-1965 I think) vehicles reregistered in CA, even 
if there were no California-specific versions of that vehicle (i.e. all 
50-state cars were identical). It's a ripoff, just another way to raise 
revenue. California is using for every underhanded trick it can think 
of right now to raise cash. They've lost the military contractors, they're 
chasing other jobs out of state, and the old Proposition 13 (remember 
that?) keeps them from sticking it to us in the form of uncontrolled 
property tax increases. So they have to get it somewhere to pay for 
all those bureaucrats. 

Traffic tickets are just another small way to raise cash. Now you
not only pay the ticket, but there are added "fees" associated with
the thing. And Billary wants to put Xthousand more cops on the
street -- all doing what? Arresting criminals or writing tickets to
pay their salaries? You guess which...

We're not going to see this smog check system go away soon because 
there are too many bureaucratic parasites who survive on our money by
pulling these scams.

RTw  05/22 0926  LONDON POLICE TRY OUT PORSCHE PURSUIT CAR

    LONDON, May 22 (Reuter) - London police, fed up with being
forced to eat the dust of criminals in high-speed cars, said on
Sunday they were trying out a Porsche pursuit car.
     "We are conducting an evaluation of high-performance cars,
including a Porsche, and their role in preventative policing of
motorways," said a Scotland Yard spokesman.
     The Porsche 968 -- top speed 156 miles per hour (250 km/h) --
is to be unveiled at a Scotland Yard-Porsche news conference this
week but the Yard spokesman denied newspaper reports the police had
decided to buy the 30,000 pound ($45,300) cars.
     Despite question marks over the safety of high-speed pursuit,
British police have complained their relatively modest patrol cars
are being outrun by car thieves and so-called "ram raiders" who use
stolen cars to crash through shop windows.

My 71 911E seems to be able to use the same distributor parts as some 
914s and possible VWs of the same vintage. It is not necessary to buy
the $20+ rev-limiting rotor that is the official part, you can get a
~$6 rotor that is listed for I think 914s. The ignition points are also
the same as those listed for some of the poorer cousins.
If anyone knows of a good book for this type of info, e.g. cross-references
(Bosch parts catalog?) and how to get it, please post & mail me the details.

Also a few parts books list only platinum spark plugs as the replacement
part for this car  (youch - super expensive). Bosch copper W5DCs ($2 apiece)
work ok, although I'm about to try a step hotter - W7DC. The local
mechanic told me to run premium and listen for pinging if I do this.

Thanks to the advice from members of the list, I was able to pull the 
steering wheel off my '74 914 this weekend.  It took a 27mm socket, plus
several blows to the lug wrench with a rubber mallet, but, once loosened,
the wheel came off without any problem.

Next, I wanted to take off the turn signal switch, wiper control, and finally
get down to the "guts" of the ignition switch, but here is the problem:
The wires to the turn signal switch are too short to just remove from the
steering column shank.  They appear to be permanently attached to the
switch, but I may be wrong about that- it was hot in the car, and there were
a couple of wasps buzzing around.

How difficult is it to remove the switches?  Can I repair the turn 
signal cancel without replacing the switch?  (It appears that the small
plastic nub that cancels the signal has the end broken)

Hey gang,
        My brain isn't operating real well today, so this question may seem
quite idiotic.  I need to find my engine serial number for some
documentation, I know I wrote it down at one time, but can't find it.
        Where is this located, on the car or engine itself?  It's a '70 911T.
If the answer is on the engine, point me to the right box, because
thats where all the pieces of my engine are scattered right now.
        If someone can help me today, I would appreciate it.
Thanks,

Subject: car won't start


Hello, fellow porschephiles!

Well, I've run into my first problem with my 85.5 944... The beast just
wouldn't start last night.  It's one of those classic "no start" symptoms,
but I wanted to check the net wisdom before I proceeded with a fix. 

Here's what happened.  The engine won't turn at all.  I can hear the relay
clicking and a hissing sound which I suppose comes from the injectors. 
That's it!  But here's another thing that might help you narrow the pool
of possible defects.  While waiting for a AAA towing truck last night (of
course, the car died while away from home just to prove Murphy's law
correct) I was able to start the car by pushing it and popping the clutch
in 2nd gear.  Of course, you might say, it's the battery, you dummy!  No
it's not! The battery it's about a month old and I did try to jump start
it from another battery with no luck.  At this point I think it's the
starter or the ignition switch. 

The car just died all of a sudden without any warnings after I 
attempted to vacuum some leaves underneath the hood (near the fuse box).  
I was pretty careful not to knock any wires, but maybe that's what 
happened.  Do you have any ideas/suggestions as to what to look for?  
My feeling is that I have some loose wiring.  Where/how should I check?  
It was too dark and late last night so I didn't have time to look 
around the engine too much.  I don't even know where the starter 
is located.
Any suggestions are appreciated.  I will keep you posted as to 
what the problem was.

Thanks a bunch,
Sorin

Subject: re; engine running backwards


      The first time I put my 911 engine back together, it ran backwards.
     Thank god for the pop-valve on the CIS box--before I started the 
     car I did a compression check---and only got 90 psi. "Rings and all
     probably need to seat, don't worry about it" said my mentor. So I 
     primed it, turned the key, and BBBBBBRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP, a horrible
     sound. Looked everything over, re-primed, tried 
     again....BBBBBRRRRAAAAAPP. Finally I went thru an exercise...turning the
     motor over slowly and watching; piston goes down, exhaust valve opens...
     piston goes up, then down---both closed....piston goes up, intake 
     opens...Yes, Virginia, there is a difference between the left and right
     cam !  
      BTW, the cams timed perfectly swapped backwards. For the race motor 
     running backwards, to the extreme if you can get fuel into a cylinder 
     and a spark somewheres close, I guess it could run. I don't know for sure
     if my 911 was running backwards or just out of cycle...
       My other strange experience was with an RX-7, way back in '80. For 
     some reason, my brother had considered removing the motor, started       
     removing lines, then backtracked. When we went to start the car, it      
     would idle at about 2000 rpm, but couldn't go higher or lower. After     
     probing around, we were further baffled when the carb was completely
     dry--no gas at all. How could it run ? A check of the oil showed it 
     had been thinned...a clue ?
       The crankcase ventilation and fuel supply lines were side-by-side,
     my brother accidentally swapped these. The result was that the fuel 
     pump dumped into the crankcase. The resulting thinned oil was apparently
     creeping past the wankel seals and volatile enough to sustain the car
     at idle....

Ummm.. this brings to memory a recollection of a story out of the UK regarding
a band of hooligans, a Range Rover, and a wild late night chase. Maybe I'm
remembering a tale told in this very forum.  

I recall that the Range Rover was stolen and was consequently chased all over
the country side leaving a few disabled or destroyed police vehicles in its
wake.  The guilty parties, as I heard it, were never caught.

Anyhow, seems to me that providing law enforcement with more performance
oriented vehicles will accomplish nothing if its not supported with the
appropriate forums for developing improved driving skills.  Also, isn't
ramming the car under pursuit a common tactic used by law enforcement to
disable or "trap" the offending vehicle?  I can't say that I'd condone this
in a 968.  Then again, maybe they'll take delivery with those steel and
rubber buggy bumpers so popular with the Highway Patrol here in California
(groan).

GGR / RWR AutoX at Candlestick
Vroooommm  SKRREEEEEK!
    This past weekend we had two autocrosses at the Stick.  Saturday was
a Golden Gate Region event, and Sunday was Redwood Region event.
    Lotsa fun, lotsa driving!
    Saturday was a very fast course!  The Heathen, Unholy Detroit Iron
(a "well-prepared" Camaro and a recent Vette--possibly a ZR-1) wound up 
blowing everyone away.  Bummer, eh?
    On one run Saturday, I improved my time by 3.7 seconds!  In one run!
Mucho thanks to the guy (I forget his name) who drives another light blue
74 914 2.0L.  He suggested that I try third gear earlier--I stayed in it
through the back sweeper and didn't have to un-settle the car by shifting
in the gates on the way back.  Talk about a difference!  I think that all
the time I made on that run was through those gates.
    Those gates were a bit difficult to find, sometimes.  In fact, we had
one person who made six runs, and had six DNFs!  I think that he just 
plain didn't see the first gate....
    Saturday was very throroughly organized, and well run.  I am learning
that this is typical for GGR events.  We were all in one big run group.  
You signed up to work for an hour in the morning, and an hour in the 
afternoon.  They ran in (mostly) numerical order.  If you missed your spot
while working, when you came off you got into the second driver line, and
got cycled through first.
    The Sunday event seemed to run on Redwood Standard Time--about an hour
later than originally planned.  The orignal course design, a "little Sears
Point," was rejected halfway through construction as being too fast.  
About two revisions later, the course was laid out.
    To be changed after the first run group.  It turned out that there was
a moderate-speed chicane right at a little hill in the parking lot, which
was causing some people to go airborne.  So they made a left-right jog
thing (box chicane?) out of it, and moved it earlier to slow people down
for the hill.  No problem.
    On two separate runs Sunday, I was able to shave two seconds each from
my best time!  Thanks to my instructor, Judy.  Spun out my last run--
bummer!  I had fun, though.
    One word to anyone who signs up as a course worker--always keep your
eyes on the car on track!  Let's just say that the sight of a silver 930
barreling down on you sideways from ten yards off gives a whole new 
meaning to the word, "SHIT!!!"  It was probably further than that, but it
seemed like he was right on top of me....
    Oh, in case anyone's interested, the next Bay Area driving event is an
autocross next weekend at the Oakland Coliseum.  They went through great
pains to tell us that we couldn't use the usual entrance, so you may need
directions if you want to go.  I don't remember what day (sorry) but you
can contact a GGR member to find out.
    Whew!  That's a lot of typing for a Monday!

getting a readout from the tailpipe sniffers. it failed. then
he told me to take a run down to the end of the road, about a mile,
and back, to "blow it out a bit". i went down and back, flat out,
shifting at 7000 rpm. he put the sniffers back in and ran the

Sounds like the starter or solenoid, or related wiring.  May also be 
the ignition switch itself as you indicated.  Maybe a relay in the 
central electric box - did you have that open when you vacuumed?

The starter is under the center/front of the car, just behind the 
clutch (i.e., under the radio).  It's pretty easy to reach.

The engine serial number is on top of the engine case, adjacent to the oil
pressure sender.  If you have the original case, it should start out with
the numbers 610XXXX where 6 is the cylinder designation, 1 is the engine
type "T", and 0 is the year of manufacture "1970".  The last 4 digits are
the production run (serial) numbers.

The 75 is also 100 lbs lighter and faster to 60 and higher top end.
Just a note to add to your curiousity.  Perhaps the extra weight had
to do with the galvanizing that began in 76?

Other questions for the trivia-inclined:
What were the differences between the 74-77 911S vs the Carrera
for those years?  I know that the plain 911 of 74 was dropped for
75, so that your choices became only the above two models, and
that the US Carrera had the same wide rear fenders flares as the
European Carrera but used the same engine as the 911S (due to
EPA reqs.).  Were there other differences in the US?  And what was
different about the European Carreras?   Did all Carreras come
with duck tails and ugly rocker panel/door decals?

It seems like the Carrera models go for a much higher prices than
the 911S's.  Is this just because fewer were made?  Anyone
know how many?  And as Mike says, does anyone care?

I am looking at old 928/944 with automatic. THe 928 is much roomier, for sure.

Anyway, just looked at one with 62K miles on it. 1st 928 I've driven, but I've
tried the 924 and 944. 

On the auto transmission, does it downshift when you push all the way down?
(floor the gas pedal). How long does it take to downshift, or will it only 
do it in certain rpm ranges? 

This one would not downshift unless you changed the setting (i.e. from D to 3 
or 2 ). 

Cruise control was also broke, tires worn, small oil leak. I dont think I want
one that leaks at all (is that unrealistic at this age? ). 

Handling was awesome, and the engine purred steady. Listen to a 10 yr old Ford
when it idles and you will hear all sorts of interesting stuff. Even with the
worn tires I couldnt get it to slip at 50-60 on corners rated 25. 

Someone offered to email me extensive research which they did on cars this
age. I never got it -- but any and all info from anyone is welcome.

In particular, I am correct in suspecting something wrong on the A/T ?

Subject: 911 rear wheel bearing R&R



Sounds like I have a bad rear wheel bearing on my '73 911.
It makes a roaring sound that gets as loud as engine noise
at 50 mph. The noise gets significantly quieter if I turn
sharply left (that's sharply as in 50 mph off-ramp) I checked
and repacked the CV joints and they seem fine.

Questions: 

Can you replace the bearing without removing the trailing
arm? If so, what kind of bearing puller do you need? 

If I do take the training arms off, can the bushing at the 
other end (Fanblock) be pressed out and replaced with an
arbor press? Are there any precautions or tricks to prevent
ruining the new bushing?

Thanks for the help. I have a lot of P-Car experience, but this
is a new one.

The engine number is cleverly hiding from you. It's stamped on the right hand

see because of engine accessories & FI. Bruce Anderson's "911 Performance

Subject: RX-7 vs. Porsche 944

A good friend just informed me that he purchased a used 1988 944.  He
is already giving me shit about owning only a nice RX-7.  How does the
performance of my 1984 GSL-SE compare with his 1988 944?  What about
handling and other characteristics of the RX-7 and the 944?  Also, is
there a Porsche group that is similar to this RX-7 club?  Thanks, Steve

i just replaced the ignition switch on my '74 2.0 last week.

i removed the under-dash 'knee pad' piece of trim (screws underneath and
at each side, under plastic caps) to get to the back of the ignition
switch and the turn signal switches.  this made it much easier to detach
the switch wires, which were joined by multi-plug connectors.  i also
had to remove the windshield washer lines (water in my face).  then four
long skinny screws held the whole turn signal assembly to the
steering column.

if your only problem is the turn signal cancel tab, then you may be able
to fix it without removing the assembly.  i think i had to remove the
assembly to get out the ignition switch, though.

after i put the knee pad back on, i think i decided it would be possible
to detach the wires without removing it, but that may have been only
because i had seen it with the knee pad off, so i knew exacly where the
plugs came off, etc.  i believe the book i was following said to remove
the knee pad anyway...

I read German haltingly, but I want to order some VW and Porsche-related

The order form has a checkbox for "Bankeinzug: Konto Nummer ___ ..."  Is this
an indication that they can accept Mastercard, or something else entirely?
I'm trying to avoid guessing wrong on the amount of a check (if they would
even take one from overseas) and/o

Perhaps you should reread your racing history.  356s routinely won their
class at many endurance races, sometimes able to outhandle hulking four-
wheeled V8s.  IF they are properly maintained, they are damned reliable.

What you are missing is the fact that they are a piece of history and
even though you might (although I doubt it!) be able to outdrive one
in a Terdcel (mis-spelling intended!), you'd have a hell of a lot more
fun in the 356.

I track my Civic Si and with suspension tweeks and race rubber can
easily beat many stock Porsches on street tires (this is on "handling"
tracks -- I really need POWER!).  But that doesn't mean I don't like
Porsches for what they are just because I can beat them with a Japanese
car for less than $15000.

I guess you said it yourself: if you don't understand, so be it.  Thanks
for keeping demand and prices a little bit less/lower for us who do!

William,

According to my Service Information Technik for the '90 C4 (aka Technical 
Manual), it list the factory aligment for the front axle as:
Toe (total) as +15' +/-5'.
The camber as 0 degree +/-10' (max. difference left to right 10').
Caster as 4 degree 10' +/-15' (max. diff. le. to ri. 15').
Toe difference angle at 20 degree steering lock: -40' +/-30'.           

For the rear axle:
Toe (each wheel) as +10' +/-5'.
Camber at -20 +/-10'.

I hope this will enlighten you.  Don't ask me how this interpret, I just type 
them up.

This is changing depending on how strong the currency is in a country.
In the 80's a lot of Porsches were imported to Sweden. Today when the
resession has made the Swedish crown weak, the germans buys a lot of
P cars from Sweden. A couple of years ago it was also beneficial to buy a car
or parts from USA but today the prices are almost in the same region.

The difference is on the other hand MAJOR between two neighbour countries
like Sweden and Norway (right Trond?).

How the relation is between the DM and the USD is not known to me. Is there
anyone from Germany on the net?

Come on Ted, what do you know about British cops? 
With the current inflation rate in Japan, I guess the new Celica Turbo is 
soon to become as expensive as the Porsche. 
Let's be happy the new Porsche is popular both by the 'good and the bad'

	Possibly ... I can't see what difference a single 968 patrol car
will make to overall law enforcement. Then again, many police forces in
continental Europe have used 911s (and 356s, I think).

	Hmm. All police car drivers in the UK have to pass extremely stiff
driving tests before they can drive patrol or other fast vehicles. Only
Police Grade One drivers (and probably only the best of those) would get
anywhere near the 968!

	The Institute of Advanced Motorists (who run an Advanced Driving
Test) only use Police Grade One drivers as examiners, and believe me,
these people are *extremely* competant. I have also had tuition from them
on the local police force skid pan and they can do some pretty impressive
things with their cars.

	Compared with stories which I have heard about the driving test in
other countries (especially the US), the bog standard test in the UK is
quite difficult and the Advanced test is much more so. The Police Grade
One is in another league above that!

	We also don't suffer from revenue generation through speeding
fines, and you are unlikely to get done for speeding below 85mph (official
speed limit 70mph) on motorways unless you were driving carelessly or
recklessly.

Even if the import boom seem to have halted, there is a market for some 
cars. New cars are extremely expensive over here(Norway), but import taxes 
are sky-high, and even if you should import used cars, it is very seldom a 
good idea to do this. It gets too expensive.
The only cars that *is* rather 'safe' to import is Classic Cars, we have a 
special tax system for them. Importing a '65 911 would, if i got a nice car 
for $10k, cost me about $ 1000 in shipping, $ 1000 in different costs, $2500 
in import taxes. The car would have costed about $ 14-15k. But such a car 
could fetch $20k in Norway.

Instead I restore cars as a hobby, and would have bought the $5k car, got a 
$2.5k receipt and pay $500 in import taxes,and have the car for about $ 
7.5k. Then I'd put in evenings restoring the car, and maybe sell it for app. 
$15-17k. But again it is a little market, and you have to know the right 
'channels' so that you meet the interested people.

RE: Rear bearing 911

Dear Reid,

I have been through this repair on my 911 (1981SC), and I see no way to
replace the bearing without taking the trailing arm off.  You need a very
heavy-duty press to remove the old  and to install the new bearing. Neither
the car nor the press can be moved into the right position to do the job -
lest there are some heavy-duty protable presses.  

I did well by following the instructions in Haynes manual.  I took both 
trailing arms off, and brought them to the Porsche dealer.  The dealer
ripped me off: $100 ! for just removing the bearings from the trailing
arms.  After that experience I ordered the new bearings from Stoodards and
had a local machine shop press them in for $ 20.

Be sure to follow the sequence for installing bearings.  The removal of the
bearing ruins them.  Better do it right the first time. 

If you need more help, feel free to write.

Dear Bill

"Bankeinzug: Konto Nummer ___ ..." means your bank account number" which
the publisher can bill directly.  Financial services in Germany allow
routine bills such as rent, utilities, insurance, suscriptions, medical
charges etc. to be directly charged to your bank account.  Paying bills in
Germany bypasses your own check-book (and the stupid activity of writing
checks and licking stamps on a regular basis). 

Giving your US bank account number doe not help, because your bank will not
know what to do with bill from the publisher - let alone read German.  

Simply give them your Mastercard number, and specify Mastercard.  You will
find that the exchange rate on Mastercard is much better than what banks
give you.

As to buying Porsches here and taking them back to Germany, there are many
who have figured out that angle - from here to there, and from there to
here.  It depends on the value of the dollar, taxes, and DOT and EPA
regulations (on both sides of the ocean) before the undertaking becomes
profitable.  As can be expected from such volatile business conditions -
the companies engaged in so-called grey market cars (also for Mercedes,
etc) come and go.

Ted,

Yes my 32 year old 356 just squeaked past our smog inspection this
morning, but its engine has never been out and at 79k miles it is
still tight and ready for every day driving.  In spite of some years
sitting, reliability is not a problem.  Have you tried a 32 year old
Tercel?  Yes, you can buy more horsepower and modern stamped metal
for less, but you won't turn heads when you drive by.

Porsches set the standard for reliable sports cars in their day.  I
like sunny days because I don't have to drive my (also 1600 cc) Honda

he told me to take a run down to the end of the road, about a mile,
and back, to "blow it out a bit". i went down and back, flat out,
shifting at 7000 rpm. he put the sniffers back in and ran the
test immediately. it passed.

Does California have exemptions for different ages.

>Malc, I am not sure anyone here in Calif. understands the rules either!! 
seriously, there is an age cutoff date where the car is exempt(I believe it's
older than '65) Also if repairs are over $250 to make car meet smog reqs they
are granted an exemption, but must try again in 2 yrs. Cars in the late 80s and
beyond have little or no trouble meeting smog reqs because they were designed 
so, such as Elect. Fuel injection, etc.  Bob

The bearings can be replaced w/o removing the trailing arms.

I suspect that any shop will have the tools necessary, one near
me claims to have such.

I did the job myself.  A friend with a lathe built me a set of 
bushings (?correct word?) to press out the old bearings and press
in the new ons.  They operate with a threaded rod down the center.

You also need a slide hammer to remove the stub axle from the 
bearing.  This destroys the bearing.  I do not think (neither 
does the factory) the axle can be removed without damage to the
bearing.

Up until the stub axle is installed, the bearings can be removed
without damage; it's removing the stub axle that destroys the bearing.

I work in North Cambridge and live in the suburbs 20 min westward.  Any leads on
quality local Porsche dealers and shops?

As a mechanical engineer, the engineering quality and power of Porsches has
attracted me for years.  As a student, I assisted with, more-truthfully

auto that I bought very used years ago as a graduating student to my dream -- a
Porsche.

To define this dream more precisely, a friend let me take his unaltered 89 Turbo

Even if the import boom seem to have halted, there is a market for some
cars. New cars are extremely expensive over here(Norway), but import taxes
are sky-high, and even if you should import used cars, it is very seldom a
good idea to do this. It gets too expensive.
The only cars that *is* rather 'safe' to import is Classic Cars, we have a
special tax system for them. Importing a '65 911 would, if i got a nice car

for E10k, cost me about E 1000 in shipping, E 1000 in different costs, E250
0
in import taxes. The car would have costed about E 14-15k. But such a car
could fetch E20k in Norway.

Instead I restore cars as a hobby, and would have bought the E5k car, got a

E2.5k receipt and pay E500 in import taxes,and have the car for about E
7.5k. Then I'd put in evenings restoring the car, and maybe sell it for app
.
E15-17k. But again it is a little market, and you have to know the right
'channels' so that you meet the interested people.

In 1961, while living in France, I dickered for several months with the
Porsche dealer in Orleans before the factory would let me order a
special-color white (not ivory) 356B Coupe because that color was reserved
for the German "highway patrol," who used white 356B Cabriolets in 1960 and
1961 to patrol the autobans. The cars had a blue light fixed to the right
side of the windshield and, except in rain, always ran with their tops
down.

When I took the car to the factory for the 6,000 mile check, I was really
impressed with the autoban courtesy of German drivers who immediately moved
to the right lane to let me through. Then I learned they probably thought
they saw the fuzz in their mirror.

It seemed the chap had owned a 'Porsche 356 '55 with a 250km/h speedo and 8 
or 9000 rpm tach, he didn't know much about these cars, but remembered it 
had a '63 super engine installed.
He sold the car about 15 years ago, but meant it still stood in a shed in 
the area he come from. I asked him to investigate whether the car was available.

Facts: 8 or 9000rpm tach, 250 km/h speedo, 1500ccm engine originally.

What chances this car is a real Carrera??

How many were made in '55?

If it is, and I can get it, I will of course buy it!

From: "Jeffrey A. Shorey" <js@ee.duke.edu>
Subject: Re: 911 rear wheel bearing R&R

I did a couple of these when I first got my car - no, you don't have to take
the trailing arm off to do it...you just need the right tools ;-).

First step is to identify which side has the bad bearing...just because it
gets quieter when you turn left doesn't mean the left bearing is the bad guy.
The 73 bearing is a complete unit with an inner and outer race...the inner
race could go bad and give you misleading sounds.  The way to identify the
correct side is to jack up the suspected side, put the car in neutral (use
blocks on the other wheels!), and spin the wheel.  Hopefully your brakes won't
drag and you can listen to the bearing as it spins.  If it is bad, you will
hear a clickety-clack, like a train.  This translates to a roar while driving.

Next step: removing the hub.  First pull the wheel, disconnect the caliper
(don't let it hang...put it on a can or something), take off the rotor, and
remove the parking brake stuff.  I had a nifty hub puller that had three "feet"
that bolted onto the wheel studs, and had a large screw-type shaft in the
middle that you cranked down on the end of the inner flange to pull the outside
flange out.  Oh, you might want to remove the castellated nut on the end of the
inner flange first ;-).  Use a hammer (on the puller) the help the outer flange
pop out.  Now you've got an outer flange in your hand with the outside race of
the bearing wrapped around it and a bunch of ball bearings on the floor...the
point of no return.  Getting the race off of the flange is a big pain...I
managed to do it somehow without scratching the flange using a vice and a large
screwdriver.  Apparently the trick is to grind a groove somewhere on the
circumference of the race, whack it with a chisel at that point, and it will
break and pop off.  YMMV.

Third step: removing the inner flange, driveshaft, and bearing.  Remove the
driveshaft.  Wear black underwear, 'cause you will get dirty.  Now the inner
flange should fall right out, since it rides inside the outer flange which is
now gone.  Now the fun part: getting bearing out of the trailing arm.  I
happened to have in my socket collection a very large socket (1 1/8"?) that
passed through the inside opening in the trailing arm and butted against the
inner bearing race.  I also had a 6"x4" piece of plate steel, say 1/4" thick,
with a hole drilled in the middle.  Pass a large bolt through the socket hole
and the bearing, place the plate on the outside of the trailing arm with the
bolt running through it, and bolt it all together.  Now you have a homemade
bearing puller.  Crank down on the bolt and the bearing will start to pull out.
A few whacks with the hammer at various points on the circumference of the
socket helps the bearing work itself out.  You may need to shim the plate out
from the control arm to give the bearing room to come out...I don't rememeber
exactly.  Once it gets a little ways out, it comes out easily using a hammer
and alternating blows from side to side of the socket.

Fourth step: installing your new bearing.  You now have a greasy new FAG
bearing in your hand.  I used an additional steel plate to press the
bearing in, with the help of the old bearing casing.  Pass the large bolt
through the two plates with the bearing and trailing arm sandwiched in between.
Crank until you run out of clearance for the plate, making sure the bearing
is going in straight.  Now use the old casing in front of the bearing to get it
to go in the rest of the way.   Do not use the inner race of the bearing to
press it in...you will destroy it.

Fifth step: installing the flanges.  I had just enough bite with the
castellated nut on the inner flange shaft that I could use the nut pull the
flanges together over the bearing.  What could be easier?  You might want to
put the driveshaft back in to keep them from rotating.  Put the parking brake
assembly, the rotor and caliper back on, mount the wheel and you're ready to
go.

PS: at this point I found out that I had replaced the wrong side ;-).

The only really special tool I used was the hub puller - it was a monstrous
thing.  You could probably rent one from your local rental type place.  The
plates and socket worked fine for me.  Been over 4 years on a new set of
rear bearing (did both ;-)) with no problems.  Of course you could spend $250
and get the correct bearing installer, e.g. from Performance Products...
Sorry to those offended by the use of a hammer.

And who is responsible for the 7 billion dollar debt? Not the Browns.

Jerry Brown kept the budget balanced and at the same time kept the costs
down for higher education.  When I started college in 1974, when Brown was 
governor, it cost about $120/year (in-state) for tuition at a California

tenfold, to about $1200/year in-state by 1980.

I've just got to share this one with you all . . .

In the Straight Scoop section of the May edition of Car Craft Magazine (Ok,
cut the snickering!) I found the following:

(reproduced without permission - so cane me why don't you)

STRAIGHT SCOOP GARAGE II

Now under construction in Doug Clark's Lanett, Alabama, garage is this '67 
Porsche 912 powered by a Chevy 350 small-block mounted up front and sending
power back to a Ford 9-inch rearend.  For those of you unfamiliar with
Porsches, this is *NOT* how the factory built the 912 (four-cynlinder version
of the 911).

The car has been equipped with a full frame, and the fuel tank now resides 
where the original engine had been.  The body has been modified with "935"
slope-nose panels from Better Bodies.  Clark promises it will be on the road
by spring.  We just hope the road can stand the strain.

End-of-article

Above the print are two small B&Ws showing the gutted patchwork body (lots of 
plastic, including a whale tail) and the 350 nicely crammed into the front 
trunk.  I'm not sure but it would appear that the rear has drum brakes in the
photo (the wheel is not in place).  Ummm, a small block Chevy can easily 
generate 450HP . . . 

Anyway, thought this might be of general interest, especially in light of the
yearly inquiry regarding V8's and 914s.

it sometimes slipped allowing the seat back to go foreward or

so.  I cleaned and lubed things, but they still slip.  My next
step will be to un-rivet a couple of pieces to get at these bevel
gears and attempt to sharpen up the teeth via filing or grinding.
Suggestions?

     Re Shocks:     I have fiddled with the blue adjustable Konis
on the car.  It seems a rear one has frozen valves, and a front
is worn out.  So - should I (for mostly street use) replace with
red Konis, or Boges?  The real question here is "Are red Konis
set to soft, about as comfortable as Boges?"  If so, I'll get the
Konis.

     Re distributors:  What's the deal with the "050"
distributor?  I don't know what I have - probably whatever was
stock in a '65 SC.

     What do the "stack of rubber donuts-looking" bumpers do for
the rear suspension?  Mine are pretty well beat, but I don't see
them listed in the catalogues (Tweeks, etc).

     That should do for now, but I'm sure there will be more.

When I was a shavetail in Deutschland (in '62) I recall seeing the 
Bundespoletzi in Porsches, on the autobahn, but I seem to recall that they were 
cream and green (maybe w/green doors).  Also, I can't recall just where I saw 
them, but my recollection is that they were not using Porsches everywhere, just 
in certain "problem" areas.  I also noted that they were always seen (in dry 
weather) with the top down (but then, who in the world would drive a Porsche cab
with the top up in sunshine ... ?)

To Trond:
 
Too bad you couldn't get a serial number, but Pops (my dad) gives some of the
following "things" that differentiate (mostly) a Carrera from other models.
 
 
1. rounded edges around the lower bodywork in front(kinda wrapped around a wire)
2. may or may not have louvers on rear deck.
3. came stock with a 547/1 engine (4-cam)
4. 8000 rpm tach
5. 250 kph speedo
6. 2 switches located on the dash that control current to dual coils
7. Gold carrera script on rear deck
8. dual exhaust under the bumper as opposed to through the bumper
9. if it has an anti-roll bar, than it is a Carrera (maybe; depends on year)
10. GS/GT whould have 16 inch wheels (original)
11. Carrera's did not have (normally) have bumper guards.
 
I think the model year of '55 had 5 different engine combo's, too.

Its on the lower right hand  side of the engine at a spot the
is  very difficult to access.  After using both the Haynes and
shop manuals I found the thing but was not able to get a
wrench on it.  So I just flushed it a couple of times with
distilled water to dilute the old coolant then refilled it
with clean coolant.  You have to calculate how much water
stays in the engine to get the concentration right though.  I
think about 1/8 of the total coolant stayes in the system if 
you dont use the side drain plug.

Ted,

I've had about enough of this crap.

If you want to argue that Porsche is not the same as something else,
that's fine. If you want to judge your cars based on a Consumer
Report-ish attitude of  the perfect car has no maintenence costs for
at least the first five years, can be abused systematicly by inept
drivers, and still function more-or-less as intended, that's also fine.
Just realize that Porsches (and for that matter, *ANY* European car)
are designed differently -- to push the envelope, to require maintenence
as a trade off for the performance you get, and to last roughly
forever *ONLY* if you take care of them. And don't try to convince
anyone here that anything different is necessarily better.

Finally, if you want to beat up people that have a preference for Porsches
over something else, go do it on someone else's list.

If your distributor has a black body with an oval tag rivetted to it, then 
it's the right stock piece. If you don't, you *REALLY* want to get the 
right distributor, or at worst, an 050 (Bob Hoy Imports in El Paso TX

Subject: Jumping the Gun...

I've sent in my subscription mail to the -request address, 
but I'm an impatient cuss, so I've decided to jump the gun.
I've read the March 8 FAQ, however, so I'll try to be as
specific as possible.

My first car was a 1958 Karmann-Ghia, the last air-cooled
product I've owned since then (the year in question being
1972).  Every night, when I'd go to bed, I used to hope
that the Porsche Fairy would turn my Ghia into either
a 1958 Speedster or a newish 911S Targa, preferably in
bright orange with black interior, and of course with the
early zip-out rear window.

Well, that never happened.  But now, 20-some years down
the line, I'm in a position to start seriously researching
the purchase of a 911 of roughly that vintage.  I love
the look of the early cars; those slim bumpers with a
little chrome in a few places are what I used to dream 
about, and surely there are enough people on this list who 
understand that the food of dreams is rarely sensible matter.

What I'm interested in is a general history of the early
Porsche 911, roughly up to 1973.  I'm aware, for instance,
that the wheelbase was lengthened during that time, but I
don't know the year.  I know that the original 2-liter six
was enlarged -- I remember seeing the silver 2.4 and 2.7
marks on the engine cover cooling vents, but I don't know
when that happened or whether some motors are better than
others (or what definition of "better" you're using, for 
that matter).  And of course I need to know what to look for 
to indicate bad repairs, botched bodywork, on-the-edge motors 
or gearboxes, or any of the many other reasons to back away 
from a deal regardless of how sweet it appears.  

As for my particular concerns, enthusiasm, or desires: I'm 
more interested in driving than showing or collecting; I don't
want a project car, but I'd rather have a solid, strong
driver than a perfect piece of sculpture that I'd be afraid
to park at work or leave in my driveway if one of the other
cars has to take the garage space for a few days.  Likewise, I'm
more interested in changes that affected the drivability
or "feel" of the car.  And I can guarantee that I'll autocross
the car, and also take it out on marque club open-track events.
I learned about trailing-throttle oversteer before I knew what
it was called, but I'd like my first spin to come in a parking 
lot full of orange cones and not on Calaveras Road...

Of course, I know that Porsche has a general tendency to
keep improving the breed, and that to a very large extent,
each year is better than the preceding.  But I want to 
begin researching the marque so that I can have an idea
of what to look for when I begin shopping in earnest.

Which is...?  Probably in the next two months; I have some
other projects in the pipe first, so if you've got a car
to sell, don't tell me yet, I'll only cringe when it goes
to someone else.  On the other hand, if you've got a good-
condition older 911 in the San Francisco Bay Area and you'd
like to show it off over lunch, drop me a line; I've ridden
in Miq Millman's very sharp black 911S, but not recently.
I live in Sunnyvale, work in San Jose; surely there must be
a few people on this list who are nearby.

Thanks for your attention, and I'm looking forward to being
part of this list.

It was true, they removed the rear seats and registered the cars as 
delivery-trucks, but the rules were changed. One of the good things about 
this was the above resulting in a large import of 944's, 928's and someone 
even got the 911 targa registered in this way. That's why early to mid 80's 
Porsches (944,924 & 928) are almost as 'cheap' as in Sweden. I almost bought 
a 928S some years ago, it was only one year left until I could re-register 
it as a personal car. The rules gave you the possibility to at no extra 
charge register the car as a personal car after 10 years 'duty'.

On your 'drive around the world tour' the Infiniti's 45.000 mile service 
occurs in Zenica, Bosnia-Herzrgovina, you just have to park your car and ask 
around for 'the nearest Infiniti dealer with a good reputation'. To your

hostile armoured vehicle, and decided to take action. KAZOOM,......Mig pilot

You will have to pay Rick's trip, and your insurance company will not cover 
your losses, since you were using your car in a race. With no competition 
the race get's *very* comfortable, no need to sleep behind the wheel with 
Hilton's Sheraton's etc in every major city. Even if the 356 is no gas 
guzzler, and Rick decides to change oil every 1500 mile the cost grows to 
six-figures.

Yes, my sentiments exactly. I am sure there are many `better'
motor cars than Porsche, depending on the evaluation criteria.
Further, there are many motor cars that are more or less desirable
for various reason. I have no idea what an Tercel is, but I am
sure that Ted must have selected because he felt it was right for
him.

However, I can't really belive that he can possibly think that 
because he prefers a Tercel that he is really going to 
convert the 600+ Porsche owning porschephiles to be infinitiphiles.
I am sure that the Tercel is a very nice motor car, however 
for the purposes of the porschephiles list it is just another
rolling object.

Get a life Ted, or a Porsche.

I've seen some Ghias that with suspension and HP mods that

Subject: 911SC won't start when warm (sometimes)

Hi

I'm generally happy with the '83 911SC I just bought, but
one VERY annoying thing has happened several times:
If I drive the car for at least 1/2 hour, park it for at least 1/2 hour,
then try to start it, sometimes it won't start. Not even one sputter.
It just cranks and cranks without ever firing. If I try it again 
10 min - 1/2 hour later, it starts just fine!!
Why??
I'm told that there was once a problem with the airflow sensor's diaphragm 
falling below the bottom of its housing (crude ASCII diagram):


\       /                  \       /   
 |-----|                    |     |     
 |     |      -->           |     |     /|\ Air
 |     |                    |     |      |
/       \                  / ----- \

The theory is that if the plate falls below the narrow center section of the 
housing, the plate is not pulled up at cranking speeds (600 rpm?) because
the gap around the plate is too big and not enough vacuum is generated;
so the engine doesn't get any fuel. When the engine cools off enough, 
the cold-start injector comes on, the engine starts up, and this engine 
speed (~1000 rpm) generates enough of a vacuum to pull the plate up.

Does anyone else have a problem starting when the engine is warm? Could
it be the above situation? What's the solution?
Help!! It's very frustrating/embarrassing when your car, which has a
reputation for precision and quality, and was running just fine 1/2 hour
ago, won't even START.

Thanks in advance!

Re Scotland Yard evaluating a 968 --
 
Cops all over the world will use any excuse to scam bigger guns and faster
cars from the taxpayers. It's a power thing. Other than going faster than
anybody else on the M1, what earthly use would a 968 be? Do they intend to
shoot it out, wheel to wheel, with the "perps?" Or force them off the road?
A little hard on the 968; you can only do this trick once or twice per car.
 
Even in California, home of the high speed chase (at least according to
Hollywierd) the CHP just follow along, taking turns at keeping the suspect
in sight, until he runs out of gas. The highway patrol will only force a car
off the road if it is clearly an immediate hazard to persons ahead, and that
is very rare even in high speed chases. CHP can also commandeer trucks to
block a road in very serious cases.
 
The worst incidents here happen when amateur police, like the U.S. Border
Patrol, take it upon themselves to chase people. We had a case last year in
which 6 persons were killed while walking along a city sidewalk in Fallbrook
or Temecula, I forget which, a good 60 miles from the border, while the
border patrol was chasing a car full of illegals. And the idiotic thing is,
I can hire 20 illegals to work in my garden, any day, every day, just by
going to a certain corner and offering work. Everybody in town knows which
corner, even the border patrol (question -- who does their gardening?)

Subject: Rather have a Tercel??

Hi, Ted.
 
I have a better idea. We wait another 32 years and then accept your
challenge. Our 356s will probably still be running. The Q45 will almost
certainly not. Even if parts go out of production on the 356, we can damn
near make anything ourselves. ("Made by blacksmiths, for blacksmiths"?).
There isn't a single item on the car that can't be bought or made by a
reasonably handy person or a conventional machine shop. You cannot say that
of any modern car; they're far too complex.
 
I predict that in ten to fifteeen years, you will have to search the
junkyards for wrecked cars to replace any failed electronic components;
the car will have depreciated so much that it will no longer be cost
effective to pay the dealer price on any electronic parts they may still
care to stock. And God help you if you got the electronic suspension. (How
many Citroens do you still see on the road, here or in France? And that was
only hydraulic everything, not electronic). And I love their ads with the
smug guy with British accent, telling us how wonderful their new multiplex
wiring system is. Think about that: instead of using somthing simple which
even the home mechanic can replace, like some plastic-covered copper going
to a connector on a bulb socket or whatever, they now have to make the bulb
socket recognize that there is a signal coming down the common wire intended
for it and it alone; behold the birth of the microprocessor-controlled light
bulb. Wanna guess on cost or availability when (not if) a socket fails?
 
We can see the same situation today in the 928. Take a 1978 928; worth maybe
8-10K. It doesn't take many 928 parts at Porsche prices to add up to the value
of the car; at that point you build a good relationship with a junkyard, lay
in a supply of parts and parts cars, or off the thing.
 
I'm not saying the Q45 or 928 is a bad car. Of the current Japanese top-end
cars, I like the Infinity most of all, as it comes closest to the BMW
7-series in feel. And I might someday buy a really old, cheap 928, knowing
full well what sort of parts problems await me. But for survivability, you
can't top an old, low-tech car built in reasonable numbers, like a 356. Or
early Mustang. Or Beetle. etc.

Subject: 356 Misc.

Hi, Bob.
 
I think the bevel gears are welded to the recliner stampings. I never tried
to unrivet or unweld any.
 
I'm told that when they start slipping like that, it's time to scour the
junkyards for other examples. Take a Friday off and come up north to Bill
Perrone's "The Parts Shop" in Huntington Beach, and Aase Bros. Porsche
dismantling operation in Anaheim. Give a call; I might be free and we can
make it a Porsche parts kind of day.
 
Is everything tight when you reassemble the mechanisms? Did you clean and
grease the thrust washer between the recliner stampings and tighten up the
retaining nut with a drift and hammer (not so cool) or make a special
spanner (about 15 minutes work with hacksaw, file, vise, and 1/2 x 1/8
cold-rolled flat stock)? Was the thrust washer still intact? They used brass
shim stock washers for a long time, finally going to plastic rings at the
very end. Which do you have? The plastic often deteriorates so badly and
falls out that many people never realize there was anything in there.
I have extra plastic rings here, which I
made myself. I loaned my spanner wrench to Thomas Pocius, the
address you have. My seat occasionally slips back one notch, under very hard
cornering. I have learned to live with it. Also in slaloms it seems to rattle
my codriver, John-who-beats-me-by-more-than-a-second, more than it rattles me,
and now I need all the help I can get <g>. Maybe yours is worse. If the seat
recliner halves have too much play (nut not tight) that may be the cause of
the seats slipping back. You want them to have a good amount of friction
when you try to move them by hand (recliners off the seat, helical spring
unhooked); keep tightening nut with spanner until halves move smoothly but
firmly. Remember that even if it feels too stiff, it's probably OK, that's a
very powerful spring that will later overcome the friction. Then rehook
spring. Wear safety glasses. I clamp the
recliner in a vise with wooden blocks, then use needle-nose Vise-Grips to
pull the spring in. The way I clamp it, even if the spring comes out, it
won't fly out of the vise jaws. I have photos showing how this is done;
should I send them down? You can return them when done.
 
Replace with Konis. Red Konis set full soft are probably too soft. Set full
hard I don't like the ride on freeway hop sections. Halfway between is
perfect for me. Occasionally there are deals on Konis, check the ads in Pano.
 
There is nothing special about the 050 distributor except that Pellow
recommends it; it's cheap, readily available and a fair functional
replacement for original. It's close to the advance curve of the 022, which
I think is what you should have. The 009 is too far off. But 050 parts are
hard to find -- points and cap; rotor is OK I think. If you have a stock
distributor, and it isn't worn, keep it. If you need it checked, let me
know, I can have a company with test equipment give it a diagnostic. Minor
problems may be repairable. Does your distributor appear to have a black
cast iron housing or a bright aluminum one? There should be an oval tag
on the visible part of the housing, with a Bosch number on it
(9 xxx xxx xxx). The last three digits are the number used to refer to it.
 
The stack of donuts are bump stops. Autocrossers frequently cut off the top
donut. These are still available new or repro, I forget which. Try Bill
Perrone again. Also Brad Ripley at NLA Ltd. has them, part 695 333 311 00,
also special bolt 695 333 513 00. Cost $68.10 and $12.65 respectively. Brad
is at 1-800-438-8119. You need his catalog. Tell him I said Hi.
 
By this time you probably also need to replace the rubber donuts inside the
rear trailing arms. Don't get the hard plastic stuff that Twinks sells. The
correct rubber parts are available. There are two different moldings, late
cars and all the rest. I think there are VW parts that fit our C models. Do
you need to set the ride height of the rear trailing arms? There is a very
easy way to do this, but the trick is that you have to pull the arms out far
enough to clear the bottom rear of the 4 threaded bosses for holding the
cover, otherwise the arm will rest on this and give a false reading.
With the rear on jackstands, pull out just far enough so the arm swings
down, past the boss for the bolt. Use a bubble protractor to find the angle
of droop. This is arbitrary, since you haven't set the car level, but it's
all you need for a baseline measurement. Write it down. Now you can play
with the splines on the torsion bars to fiddle with the angle, in 50
minute increments, to raise or lower the car. This is sometimes called
"decambering" (assuming of course you don't set the rear so high that you
get positive camber). Set both sides to the same angle, or if you want to
get fancy, you can even do some "weight jacking" by setting the left side
with a bit more droop so the car will ride level with only you in it.
 
There is a Porsche junkyard in National City, just up the street and
visible from Lemon Grove Plating. I have never dealt with them. Might be
worth a visit though. It's small. Let me know what you think of the
operation, is it good, honest, etc.
 
There is probably a good VW parts place near you, but if not I've had very
good experiences with a place near my house, Kymco. They're knowledgable and
honest and have never steered me or my VW-owning friends wrong. Kymco is at
2121 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa, CA   tel. 714-642-1835
 
I found my old posting on recliner assembly and sent it to your private E-mail.

I just caught the tale end of the sub woofer box request.If your 
referring to the ad for the sub woofer that sits on the floor behind the 
front seats for a 911, After I saw the ad I built one myself, the problem 
I ran into was it restricted the distance I could move the seats back. It 
wasn't too much of a problem for the drivers seat because I don't move it 
back all the way, the problem was the passenger seat. I was really cramp, 
I'm 5'8'' and couldn't stretch my legs out. I built the box as narrow as 
possible.I opted to remove the back seats and build an enclosure there. 
the top of the enclosure is the same height as the seats were and the 
woofers face the back of the front seats, allowing me to still put things 
in the back. It also looks pretty stock since you can't see the speakers.

Subject: Re: early ignition parts

Well, I really wanted to add to the Toyota discussion (Ted, you asked
for it, you got it!), but if you can't say anything nice......

But the more pertinant comment is about rotors.  I consider using
parts other than factory when I beleive the quality is comparable
and the price is better, and in fact have a one of the less expensive
non rev limiting rotors in my '70T.  I won't do that again.  I always
figured that I'm smart enough to watch the tach and not over rev the
engine, but at the two days I spent at the driving school last month
I was so focused on driving that I couldn't watch any of the gauges.
I was trying to figure out which way was straight ahead!  The exercises
and the courses were set up in a way which didn't require much if any
shifting to minimize the stuff us rookies had to learn at one time, but
I know that if I were to auto-x the car that over reving could be a real
possibility and some type of rev limiter would be one less thing for
me to worry about.  I'll be buying a different rotor before I go back.

It was at the driving school that I really began to appreciate the design
of the Porsche.  My car is in pretty decent shape with a recent motor
rebuild, but it's still 24 years old.  I drove the car 45 miles each way
for two days, to go to the school, drove the car harder than I ever thought
I would (or could), and then drove it to work the next day.  We have 5 cars
and the Porsche is probably only car I would consider "treating" to this
kind of use/abuse with minimal fear of breaking.

  I'd recommend looking at '78 on 911 SC's, they have rust proof bodies 
(as do '76 and later 911s), and have the reliable 3.0 litre engine and 
wider wheel flares than pre '88 911s.

The older 911's can be made reliable, but only with an upgrade to the 
3.0l engine.  There are some good books on 911 out there, 911 Performance

both available at Automotion, a great place for books, but questionable

  Tercel is the low end Toyota (you know, the large Japanese automaker,

I have a '77 911S upgraded to '78 3.0l engine.  However, I do feel my

Since it looks like we need a break from the Tercel and police car
threads, I'll offer up a question...

I've recently purchased a set of springs to replace the stock set
on my RS America and have some time to burn this weekend...

My question is:

   Other than marking and measuring to get the alignment "close
   enough" to get it to the alignment shop, are there any other issues
   I should be concerned about?

I was hoping to be able to perform the spring replacement without 

having to remove the entire strut, but my mechanic advises that this
is probably the easiest route to take. I have a spring compressor
available to avoid eating the spring as the upper perch is removed.

Any opinions/ideas would be greatly appreciated...

Doug:

I wrote last week about this 951.  The car was very mean-looking wearing these 
tires.  The fronts might have been 255/35.  I'll check.  It was race-prepped 
with Cool Carbons/Rollcage/harnesses.  It had very nice seats (not Sport 
seats; black with suede-like finish) with huge side and thigh bolsters which I 
believe were an option on the '89 Speedsters.  I didn't get a chance to speak 
with the owner but I overheard it was putting out 350 horsies. 
I'll see how it does this weekend at NNJR's driver's ed event at Pocono 
Raceway.

A few months ago, European Car had an article on a similarly shod 951 with NOS. 
I'll dig it up and post details if you like.  On a related topic, isn't there 
an optimum tire size for given output/suspension/layout etc?  I would think 
above that optimal point, rolling resistance would negate the extra grip and 
actually slow you down.  Anyone care to elaborate?

Your 944S is the 16-valve 2.7L version of the base 2.5L 944 engine found in 
'87 & '88 924S (not to be confused with Audi-derived 924 of 70's-'82).  The 
924S has all 944 drivetrain components, is lighter and faster than base 944 
and is supposedly the most aerodynamic road-going Porsche produced to date.

   If I drive the car for at least 1/2 hour, park it for at least 1/2 hour,
   then try to start it, sometimes it won't start. Not even one sputter.
   It just cranks and cranks without ever firing. If I try it again 
   10 min - 1/2 hour later, it starts just fine!!
   Why??

This same kind of problem was discussed a while back so you might want
to check the archives.

On my '76 911, a similar set of symptoms was cured by replacing the
fuel pump check valve, basically a device that keeps pressure in the
fuel system after the pump is turned off.

If you don't get a definite diagnosis, definitely try replacing this
before other, more expensive repairs (such as the new warm-up
regulator that my mechanic sold me).

Hi gang,

I want to thank all of you for your experience and wisdom which helped me
on making a wise decision.

Next question is does $1,600 sound too much for a clutch job for a '79
928?  I've seen kits in magazines advertising clutch kits for 928s for
about $400.  How hard is it to do yourself?  Even if it would take a full
weekend to do the job saving $1,200 sound pretty good to me.

I need to replace the battery tray on my 75 914 and would be interested in 
hearing the
experiences of anyone who has done this (or had it done for them).
How complicated a task is this?
To remove the old tray, are the welds drilled out?
What specific areas should I inspect when looking for rust/acid damage in 
the body
below the battery?
If I remember right, the ECM mounts to the battery tray support bracket.  Do 
I need to
disconnect/remove the ECM before welding in the new tray to prevent $$$ up 
in smoke?
Any information appreciated.

Subject: Help on replacing brake pads !



To any 928 owners && / || mechanics :

I would like to replace the front brake pads on my '86 928.
Unfortunately I don't have a service manual or an equivalent.

I have changed pads on GM's, and on Honda cars and bikes.

Is changing the pads on the 928 a more complicated procedure ?

Is there anything signifcant about the prodedure that I should know ?

Do I need any special tools ?

Should I fork out big $ and have it done at the dealership ?

Could someone (please) provide me with a brief description of the procedure
{possibly from a service manual} ?

Any help would be appreciated.


As an aside :

I had a vacuum leak in the vacuum control bladder on the control near the
upper ventalation port above the colsole.
I simply removed the vacuum line and pluged it.
The leak was causing a very high pitched whine at various temperature
combinations, i.e. cold outside <-> warm inside, hot outside <-> any
temperature inside.

What does this vaccum control operate ? That is, what function does it 
have ?

Is this a really neccessary control ?

Will I die if it is not connected ?

Thanks in advance.

Pete, 
  I'm all for simplicity, my old company was called "Amish Software,

or Beetles, to me they seem very very expensive, unless you get a really

I remember hearing about what the German police used to do back when there
were problems with terrorism (post-1973).  If you were speeding and didn't
pull over, they wouldn't try to run you off the road, they would simply
set up a roadblock with a couple of machine guns and wait for you...I guess
people only made that mistake once.

Mind you, this is a second-hand story, so the original teller might have been
exaggerating, but seeing as how the guards in the airports are all young kids
with submachine guns, it wouldn't suprise me.

Actually, when you think about it, its a safer way of doing things, since it

Subject: 993 stuff

We were given a 993 model introduction tonight at Holbert's Porsche for our
monthly meeting.  The local zone sales and tech reps were there to chat.
 Some interesting facts (at least to me):
  This cosidered the perfect 911.
  The car will probably be made till at least the end of the century.
  The under 60k price is not an intro low ball which will shoot up soon.
  The US gets about 300 a month and sells about 500 - something they have
     not seen for a few years.
  The 'average' out the door sticker will be in the low 60s.
  In most markets, there will be some discount but they don't expect anyone
     to 'whore' them out, nor do they expect any outlandish over sticker $.
 Along with the 993's, Holberts put out a display of cars from 356 to now.
One that seemed to catch everyone's eye was a '93 911 Turbo S - fly yellow
(no flames, I don't know the "correct" Porsche color name).  The very last
of the '93 911 run was the Turbo S and 50 came here.  They carried a sticker
of about 127k and while some were slant nose models, most were the 'pure'
style.  Amoung some of the differences were 959 ducts in the rear fenders,
special tail, 18" 3 piece wheels and '25' additional hp.  Why '25'?  Well,
any more and the motor had to be re-certified.  The very unofficial response
to hp was - "Is it more like 400 hp?" "Ja, you could say that very easily"
this, btw, from the factory, not the PCNA people.

If you get the kit for $400, and has the possibility to save $1200 by doing 
it yourself, go ahead and do it!! I'm not even sure how the 928 clutch job 
is, but with the right tools this could be a nice weekend.
The 928 has the gearbox in the rear and therefore only the tunnel with the 
intermediate shaft should be removed.(right???)

Be sure to get hold of the clutch alignment tool. It'll save you a lot of 
swearing!! i'm myself using the 'pinion-shaft' (transformed from 
Norwegian...sp=??) from an old Transporter(VW van) for this task.Much 
cheaper, and also more precise than the tool! 

I can't give you more advices as I haven't done this myself on a Porsche, 
but I've changed the clutch on a handful of Alfa GTV's with the same 
engine-gearbox layout. you can do it!

Hi,

Just a short note on rebuilding front wheelcylinders for the 356's.

Yesterday I was finished rebuilding, my front brake assemblies. What I did 
was: stripping all parts, washing with methanol, honing (?) the wheel 
cylinders and installing new rubber. Painting the backing plates, inatalling 
new 'connector line' between upper and lower cylinder. The assemblies look 
good, and I'm really eager to put them on the car. 

ATE has rebuild sets for the wheel cylinders, I have the part # somewhere if 
interested. After honing the clearance between the piston and wall was .15 
to .20mm and the specification allowed for maximum 0.26.(ATE spec.) 

I rebuillt 8 wheel cylinders for the cost of $50. I took the '60 T-5's too, 
these were stuck, but with the grease gun connected to the brake line's 
inlet, the pistons came out nice.

Does anyone know the limit for rebuilding the brake shoes?

Is the rear wheel cylinders exchangeable with VW ones? Which?

cheers,
trond

I've been told that one can adjust the ride height of the car
by measuring the distance from the wheel arches to the ground.
The distance should be 25.5" front and 25" rear.

The question I have is whether I should take into account the weight
of the driver. In autocrossing and track events there is never anyone
in the passenger seat...


P.S. Even Sweden has a history of Porsche police cars. In late 60's
(and early 70's?) the police drove some 912's and 911's. 

Today, they drive nothing more exotic that Volvo's and Saab's...

	Where in London was this? If I could get an '88 911 with
reasonable mileage for 12k GBP I'd buy it tomorrow!!

	These cars go for about 18k to 20k privately and up to 24k from
dealers, depending on mileage. I have an Excel spreadsheet with about 150
911 prices which I've seen over the last year or so (so that I can
identify a good deal when I'm ready to get a 911!!) and can send it on to
anyone who *really* wants it.

	One data point - my local dealers (Lancasters) had an '86 ('87 MY,
i.e. with G50 gearbox) with 47k miles in blue with black leather sports
seats last week. Price was 21k GBP - may take 20k GBP for cash.

Subject: 914 battery tray replacement

Pete,
With a screwdriver, poke the sheetmetal underneath and a little forward of
the battery tray. On my car, this had assumed the consistency of peanut
brittle. 
I  removed the old tray with a chisel (careful, don't make a hole in the
wheel-well) and cleaning up the remains with a grinder.
This may be unacceptably low-tech, but you might consider pop-riveting the
battery tray into place (no one will notice). If you rivet, you can just
unbolt the brain from the battery tray, and set it aside, but leave its
electrical connections intact.  Eastwood (see FAQ?) sells some rubbery
battery-tray coating that worked well for me. Also, always have a cover
over your battery to shed rain.

As an observer I'd say that there's only 2 ways of running this challenge.

It ranges from not very complicated through "part it out".

The welds can be drilled out, but only if the mounting points still
exist.  I've seen some pretty rusted battery trays.

Thoroughly inspect (visually) the area around the battery.  Sometimes,
the sheetmetal which makes up the inside of the right rear wheel well
is damaged, which will have to be repaired before the new tray is installed.
Also, check the area under the tray:  the right engine shelf.  Usually, this
area is damaged (remember, water flows downhill).  From there, the acidic
water settles into either the right console or the longitudinal.  The console
is the inner tab used to mount the trailing arm.  Check the console and the
longitudinal both visually, and with a hammer.  Light to moderate taps with
a hammer will help disclose any damage in this area.  The hammer blow will
either make a dull "thud" or penetrate the metal if there is damage in this 
area.

YES!  YES!  YES!  Remove the ECM before you start any work in this area.

Not to scare you Pete, but you may want to be prepared for what may lie
ahead.  In the best case, you may just have to replace the tray.  In
the worst case...well...I'll tell you about a car I parted out.  It was
driven into a garage where it sat for eight years before it was given to
me to dispose of.  I removed the passenger seat, then stepped on the floor
to get over to the driver's seat.  The floor panel collapsed.  "Okay", I
thought, "I'll just step on the door sill to step over."  So I did, and
the car floded neatly in half.  Ooops.  Good thing I had the cutting torch.
I don't believe your car will be that bad, but it's best to inspect it
and take care of any problems now, before they grow.

Good luck, Pete!  Let me know if you need any more info.

Subject: RE: 928 Clutch Job

avery,

	there are two things to consider when evaluating this price: what
and whose parts are included, and how much labor are they charging you
for?

	first off, you do know this is a two-plate, racing-style clutch, right? ok.

	the parts prices from Porsche for a 928 clutch are about $700 for
the two disks, the pressure plate and t/o bearing. this doesn't include the
intermediate plate, which may or may not need to be replaced, i've been
told. that plate is another $350 from Porsche. so if they are including the
i-plate, and charging you full retail, that leaves about  10-13 hours labor,
depending on labor charge. so i'd say its high, but in the ballpark.

	the $400 clutch kits you see are generally sachs components,
which, rumor has it, is what the EuroSelect parts are, in this application.
you still might have to fork over $300 bucks for an i--plate, if yours 
is scored.
so you should be able to save somewhere between $1100 and 800
by doing it yourself, and from my reading of the manual, it will take a
whole weekend!

	as you might have guessed, my '79 928 has started asking
for a new clutch, so i've been researching this while i save up the
required number of dimes.

Well, sort of.  Drivers of Volvos are thought to be (overly) concerned
about safety, not particularly automotive-minded, certainly not
enthusiasts.  But careful, conscientious people.

Saab owners are thought to be a little quirky, like the cars (but not as
quirky as say, Morgan owners).  Individualists.  Independent-minded.
Somewhat enthusiastic about cars and very loyal to Saabs (as we are
about Porsches).

Swedish cars are expensive so owners are thought to be reasonably
well-off.  But status-symbol types tend to go for M-B's,  BMW's, and
high-end Japanese cars.

I've probably offended someone here.  Sorry.  Just my opinions, of
course, based on what I see in CA & NY.

     1. Chevy V8 in 912; putting the motor in front is new to me, the
        first I heard of anybody mixing Detroit and Zuffenhausen was 
        in the late 70's, in a hot-rod mag where a guy stuck a Chevy
        302 (from a Z-28) in an early 911S. The article showed the beast
        at speed at Riverside. Both car and speedway and apparently driver
        r.i.p., I heard a few years later from a  907-team mechanic
        (Ken Rosegay) that the driver killed himself in that car. 'Course
        maybe I'm  confusing that with the guy who put wings on his Gremlin 
        and killed himself flying it.
         Since then I guess everyone has seen the twin-turbo Chevy/914,
        928 powered 914, etc. etc. Seems like a terrible waste of the 912 and
        the Chevy motor to me, abandoned V8 Vegas or hot-rod bugs are a lot
        more common and probably better engineered...
                      
          Oh, don't forget that Detroit and Porsche did collaborate on 
        a production car---the 4 cylinder AMC Gremlin. Motor is the same
        as the 924 motor, except the Gremlin was carb'd instead of FI'd.
        If you have a 924, you can get the same hard parts cheaper for your
        Gremlin. Just don't race that Levis Gremlin for pink slips, though--
        he probably has a 6-cylinder motor and could blow your doors off.
        I suppose that bell-housings and etc might somehow link up, if you
        wanted to put the 6-cylinder AMC motor in your 924. But putting 
        Nitrous in a Chevette may mean more...

     2. Clutch job in 928; You are in luck, this isn't so bad. Unlike the
        924/944, you don't need to retract the torque tube, etc. Drop the 
        exhaust, remove the shield pans, the torque tube has a collar shaft
        that slips back away from the clutch (allen-headed bolts hold it
        at either end). The clutch drops out of the bottom of the bell        
        housing, you can get to everything pretty well. Definitely the 
        easiest Porsche to replace a clutch in, in fact easier than 
        probably about any car.

Porsches in question had been un-mercifully butchered by some body
shop.  Sigh.
    One was an ad for a limousine company.  They had a Turbo-body 911
STRETCH limo in white!  Ouch.  I think it was even a cabrio.
    The other was for one of the "motorcycle lawyers" we have around
here.  To prove that he was a real biker, too, they had a few shots of
him riding on the highway with some other bikes.  Except his "bike" was
a three-wheeler.  In fact, it was the rear end of a 914, with the pas-
senger compartment cut down into a triangle with a single seat, and a
handlebar/shock/wheel arrangement up at the front!  Made me wince, see-
ing what they'd done to the poor little red beastie!  Sniff.

Hey Scott,

I have a 1981 911SC Targa with the same problem.  I have been told that it
may be a few things.  First, I was told it might be the warm-up regulator.
I ordered one and installed it, drove for 20-20 minutes, shut off the engine
waited 15-20 minutes, but the problem persisted.
 
When the engine starts fine when cold, but not when warm, that it may be the 
fuel pump.  There is a check valve in the fuel pump which prevents the fuel 
from flowing backwards into the tank when you shut off the engine.  If this
valve is bad, when the engine is hot, the fuel system runs leaner and the fuel
will flow back into the tank, thus there is no fuel in the lines, and the
engine will not start (right away).  There are two ways to test if this is
the problem.

#1:  The harder way: start the car when cold, drive 20 minutes, and right
when you shut off the engine, have a friend clamp the rubber fuel line
just on the engine side of the fule line, right at the point where the fuel
exits the pump.  By clamping the line, this traps the fuel in the line to
the injectors (what the check valve should do).  Wait 20 minutes, then have
your friend remove the clamp just as you try to start the car.  If it starts,
you need to replace the fuel pump (about $200 for my '81 911).  

#2:  The other way to see if you fuel pump check valve is not stopping the
backwards flow of fuel after stopping the engine is to run the car 20
minutes.  Shut it off, and wait 20 minutes.  Then try to start the car.
But wait, it should not start right?  Well, not right away - This is the
problem that you are having correct?  Yes, but let the starter crank for
30 seconds or so.  Yes - this does beat on the starter, and the battery.
But is you keep trying the starter, letting it crank for 10 seconds, then
off for a half second, and try asgain, and keep doing this, if it starts
in about 30 seconds (or one long 30-40 second crank), then you prpobably
need a new fuel pump.  Pumping the gas pedal usually helps to start it quicker.
What is taking place is that the pump is sucking air out of the lines.  Once
the fuel (which ran back to the tank when you shut off the engine hot for 20
minutes) goes all the way back up to the fuel pump, and into the injectors,
the engine starts.  Pumping the gas peddle opens up the injectors to let 
out the trapped air.  Thus, until you get you fuel pump and put it in, 
this method should always work when you are in the no start situation.

I just put a new pump in mine, I have not tried to start it yet, as the car
is in the shop for other things.  I hope this solves the problem.  I could
always start mine with my method #2.  I hope the pump is the problem for
me, but it seems to make sense.  

>I'm told that there was once a problem with the airflow sensor's diaphragm 
>falling below the bottom of its housing (crude ASCII diagram):
>

Yes, this too could be the problem.  I would try method #1 to see if it is
the pump for sure, if method #2 does start the car.
The sensor plate height measures the air entering the engine.  The upper
edge of the plate must be even with the narrowest part of the air cone.
I have not checked this, nor have I tried to adjust it on mine, since my
fuel line tests have seemed to isolate the problem.  I believe you need 
a special tool to adjust this plate height.

Yes it can be embarrasing.  Especially when you are on a date.

Pete,

While you are at it, crawl under the car and check out the mounts for the
rear trailing arm.  The one under the battery (especially the inboard 'tab')
get a good deal of the acid and often rust/weaken.  A sizable fix to do, 
but the other option is the trailing arm being set free.

Is it true that the 912 has weaker transaxles and other parts than a 
911?  I can see why it could use weaker parts, but from a manufacturing 
perspective, it seems that it would be cheaper to use the same parts, 
except for 4 cyl. engine.

Are '77 911S frame and wheel parts the same as the turbos?  (I know the 
bodies, engines and brakes are beefed up).  Thanks.

"Under no circumstances should a person with a Porsche marry a person who
doesn't like Porsches without 1st executing a pre-nuptial agreement that
contains very specific language concerning the disposition of said Porsche in
the event of divorce."
That reminds me of an apparently true story told me by an investment broker
(and P-car enthusiast) of my acquaintance.  Apparently a friend of his bought a
911 (1980's vintage, but don't know exactly what year) for $500.00...that's
right five hundred dollars!  You guessed it.  It was a situation where the wife
(or ex-wife) "got the Porsche" with instructions to "sell it for whatever you
can get for it" and the arrangement was to split the proceeds.  And she did. 
Here's your $250.00, honey,  and good riddance.  OUCH.  BTW, the prenuptial
agreement idea would probably apply equally well to women P-philes who might
mixed up with a man who doesn't like Porsches.  It may be hard to imagine, but
there are men who don't like Porsches.

Hello Porschephiles;

I am contemplating the purchase of an '87 or '88 944 or 924s.  The 924s is 
about one-half the cost of the 944 in the Washington D.C. area.  My question is:
What am I getting in the 944 (or giving up in the 924s) that justifies the 
higher price?  I understand the drivetrain is the same.  There has to be 
something I am missing.  Any insight would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I have had the same problem on a 1980 911SC that was also cured with a fuel
pump check valve.  Some models had the valve included with the pump while
others had the valve separately attached to the end of the pump.  Even if
yours is integrated into the fuel pump you can buy the separate unit and
add it on.  You will then have one functional valve and one non-functional
valve and you don't have to purchase an expensive fuel pump.

The rear struts definitely have to be removed to replace the springs (not
too tough except for reaching back to those upper strut nuts behind the
engine), but you can do the fronts without totally removing the strut from
the car.  The problem with removing the front struts (besides requiring a
realignment) is that the brake lines go through a plate on the strut and
have to be disconnected (entailing a brake bleed) or you can cut a notch
through the side of the plate so that the brake line can be slid out after
removing the retaining spring that holds the brake line coupling to the
plate.

What I have done with my RS America and now my 993 is to detach the strut
top from the car body, pivot the strut out of the fender well, remove the
strut top bearing from the strut, and replace the spring.  But first you
must disconnect the front sway bar (easiest while the car is level so there
is no preload) to allow the suspension to pivot downward.  The only thing
that restricts the strut from pivoting outward easily is the length of the
brake line.  To allow a little more slack in the brake line, it helps to
remove the brake line retaining clip from the brake line holding plate on
the strut, play with the steering wheel to rotate the strut into a more
favorable position, and to tilt the strut slightly toward the front of the
car.  Be careful not to damage the outer edge of the fender.

I've read somewhere that one procedure involves chalking the tire (sidewall

then take the car out for some "spirited" driving.  The ideal tire pressure is
determined when the chalk marks are rubbed off only to the edge of the tread

Subject: Motronic Warning

forwarded message from ken house:

This note is a caution to those people who are retrofitting a 3.2l  Carrera 
engine into an earlier model 911.  i just finished repairing two more DME 
(Motronic) control units that were damaged by incorrect wiring.  The cause 
of this particular failure mode has occurred so frequently that a word of 
warning is warranted.

Scenario: An early model 911 owner/racer buys a 3.2 motor with wiring 
harness and DME control unit, but usually does not buy the tachometer.  
Installation is straight-forward until the wires to the tachometer are 
encountered.  The Motronic tachs are microprocessor-based electronic units 
with two wires coming from the DME unit.  For some reason the wire to pin 
11 of the DME gets connected to a +12 volt line under the dash.  The 
installation gets completed, and the key is turned to start the car --zap-- 
it won't start.  After much time and trouble someone narrows the problem 
down to the DME unit, after a few phone calls they find out that i fix 
DME's and send it to me.

Cause/effect:  Incorrectly putting B+ voltage on pin 11 will BLOW the
proprietary Bosch injection controller chip on the analog board inside the 
DME and render it useless.  The car will turn over with the starter, the 
plugs will spark, the fuel pump will pressurize, but there will be no fuel 
injection.

Reason:   Pin 11 of the DME is an output not an input, it outputs  the fuel
injection pulse width as a 12 volt signal  TO the tach.  The special Bosch 
chip is an analog driver for both the injector stages and the tach.

Repairs:  The repair is easy--replace the chip.  The hard part is to obtain 
replacement chips.  If anyone has a connection to BOSCH to get chips i 
would be interested, or if you have DME problems give me a call.

Not knowing about the internal physical differences between the cars, 
here's my stab at it:

IT costs more because people are willing to pay more. This could merely 
be because it 'looks' better or because of an actual superiority. Why not 
decide which one you like better against your own standards (subjective: 
looks, objective: engine, drivetrain etc) and then worry about the price.

You can't be serious with this. A big Detroit V8 runs on sludge for a  
considerable time but a high revving engine built anywhere won't.  
Smaller and more sophisticated engines just simply require proper  
maintenance. And there is a mindset that goes with it - you take care  
of it and get to know your machine and the driving is more rewarding  
after that. I think most americans think cars as consumer goods to be  
fixed at mechanics and discarded when used up.

But let's not generalize too much. I think Stan exaggerated in his  
original comment saying that any european car lasts forever with  
proper maintenance. What about the many pathetic Fiats and others  
whose reliability even the enthusiasts refer to as "character"?

On a more technical side question for the experts. If the 944 sunroof  
goes up and down but refuses to to be disengaged (i.e. cannot be  
removed) is there an obvious reason? A faulty gauge that tells the  
roof is released but where is it?

Can anyone recommend a place where I could get some nice floor mats for my 
'87 944S?  I've seen the ads for Performance Products, but US$140 for F+R
mats just seems excessive.  Is it, or do I just have unrealistic expectations? 
Thanks for any advice you can give me!

Tracy,

I recommend that you buy quality floormats, even if it costs a little
more. I bought some after market mats about a year and a half ago which
are already wearing through by the accelerator pedal. My original
Porsche mats had the heavy duty carpet by the driver's feet and were
still in pretty decent shape after five and a half years. Definitely
wasn't worth the small amount of money I saved.

I had a BMW 320i a while back that was everything but self/low
maintaining. My first experience was at the end of a workday when
I went to the BMW dealer service dept. to pick up my car and saw 
the frowns on the faces of a long line of Bimmer owners, checkbooks 
and service contracts in hand, lined up at the cashier window.  

Luckily I found an independent, BMW trained mechanic who was competent,
honest and reputable.  Though the car was generally reliable, frequent
minor problems that occured made the car more demanding than average,
service-wise compared to other cars I have owned.  On the other hand, 
the car was 6 years old when I sold it and felt more solid than any 
6 year old Toyota, Nissan, Chevy, whatever.

The trade-off question, I guess, is, what do you want after 6 years ?
A solid-feeling, well maintained used car or a less solid-feeling 
car that cost less to maintain ?

My '87 944S suspension is getting softer bit by bit (not surprising; every day 
driving in D.C. will kill any suspension) (also not surprising since car has 
102K on it).

I don't do any work on the car myself, mostly because I don't have the time, and
so I will be taking my car in in the next week or so and am wondering what will 
be reasonable for the mechanic to recommend.  I won't be suprised if he 
recommends new shocks, but should I be expecting to have to replace coils at 
some point?  (I did in my prior car, but it was a '75 Olds, an entirely

around the early 80s'. If the puny 1.3 liter standard engine did not blow and

D.C. Metro Area Philes,

As long as I'm on the subject, what recommendations/experiences do people have 
with shops in the D.C. metro area?  I used to use the shop at the Heishman's 
dealer in Crystal City but then I got tired of every job having to be one which 
was in their catalog (no, we can't try and fix the loose upholstery on your 
headliner, but we'll be _glad_ to sell you a new one!  Look, it's in the book 
right here!).

Then I started using Foriegn Service in Tyson's.  They seem to be OK, and just 
barely OK.  I was unimpressed when they scratched the roof and broke the 
cassette-holder cover during the last service.  They did repaint the roof and 
replace the cover but I had to make two more trips out there.  Then when I 
picked up the repainted roof they had neglected to replace all the screws which 
hold the clips in place, which kind of makes me wonder if they have forgotten to
replace any screws while working under the hood!  They claimed, "100% sure" to 
have fixed my 3100rpm noise by replacing the right front motor mount (~$200 
total) and the noise was/is still there.  Now I'm thinking it's an exhaust pipe 
rattling..  Blah, blah, blah.


Anyone know anyone good and trustworthy or have any other experiences to share?

If you're contemplating the purchase of a water-cooled Porsche, you should
definately get a copy of the Feb '94 issue of _Excellence_ magazine.  It has
a very good article on the purchase of used 924/944/928s.

The 944 does have more horsepower (150 vs. 115), and is (I think) slightly 
bigger.  A list of the good and bad points about each model (from "So You
Want To Buy A Water-Cooled Porsche?" by Jim Pasha, copyright (C) 1993 by
Ross Publications):

924 -- Good points:
"When lowered and aligned properly, they handle as well or beter than their 
contemporaries.  The engines, when maintained and repaired correctly, will
easily give over 150,000 miles of service. The last ones produced had 115 hp.
The bodies were the first designed for electro-plated steel in fabrication and
these bodies have the highest torsional strength of all production Porsches.
The transaxles on the 76-78 cars were somewhat noisy, yet gave excellent
service.  The seat position is excellent and visibility is good.  It has good
fuel economy and service parts for almost all mechanical pieces are
inexpensive."
924 -- Bad points:
"Not as much horsepower as an enthusiast wants, though faster than a 914, 912, 
or 356.  The seats, although among the best on the markey, have durability
problems in the foam inserts, the dashboards crack and the carpet seems to fade
quickly in the sun.  Some maintenance items, like the clutch, are expensive in
labor because of the car design.  The turbo versions aren't highly regarded,
and require more than a little thought before purchase.  Sometimes the
electricals can drive you nuts, but not as badly as a 928.  Brakes work well,
but not up the later Porsche standards."
===
944 -- Good points:
"Much more power than a 924, easier to drive in traffic, still more than a match
for newer, more powerful cars.  When aligned and lowered, it has the potential
to win at the track if equipped with sport suspension.  The 944S2 is still
winning at the track.  Most of the early defects were corrected by the mid-1983
model run, so your major risk is in the quality of maintenance and repair.  An
excellent dollar value, the range is $5,700 to $14,000 for a 944, $12,000 to
$22,000 for a 944S2, and $12,000 to $25,000 for a 944 Turbo" [Note: all prices
are in US$.]
944 -- Bad points:
"The novice cannot perform many of the necessary repairs without a few
expensive or special tools.  These cost a lot of money, so you'd better line up
a mechanic or be ready to buy the tools.  Early cars have the motor mount 
disintegration problem and premature water pump failure syndrome.  The former
can be handled by the knowledgable home mechanic, the latter requires a
flywheel-lock-and-belt-tensioning tool available from most Porsche suppliers
for [US]$450.  As many of the cars have already been through a replacement
cycle, most of these problems should hvae been picked up and fixed."

Sorry this got so long, drop me a line if you'd like a copy of the checklist
I used when I shopped for my 944.

Depends. When it was new, the 911 and first generation 912 had the same
transmission (second generation = 912 E of mid 1970s, built for only 1 year
to bridge gap before 924 came out).  The '65-67 912 used the 902/0 or 902/1;
the 911 used the same transaxle, except the 66 911 S which used
the 901/02. There were other variations, but that's basically it. The 911
eventually went through other, much stronger transmission designs, which
were never installed in the 912 because it was gone by then.
 
The later 911 E used the 923/02 5-speed based on the 915/44 of the 911.

Lots of parts are shared. The 924 S has the same engine as the
944. But the 944 S has more power again. So for 1988 the progression is
924 S -- 944 -- 944 S -- 944 Turbo.
 
The engine used in the 924 S is a Porsche-built engine, also used in the
944; the engine used in the older non-S 924 is a non-Porsche, Audi-built
engine.
 
The 944 is a better car than the 924 S, but I don't think it's twice as
expensive better. I think the 944 had better suspension and a much nicer
interior. More performance options were available on the 944, such as ABS
brakes and wheels & tires and the Turbo's anti-roll bars. It could be that
924 S prices are dragged down by the reputation of the older non-S 924.
How much are we talking about here? I didn't like any of the non-Turbo
4-cylinder Porsches of that time, but felt that the 944 Turbo was a much
better car. (I wrote the cover story comparing all four Porsches in the
November 87 Road & Track). If it's not too much more money, a same-
vintage 944 Turbo might be a more enjoyable car. If it's a loaded 944 with
lots of good options, it may be worth it.
 
Weigh this free advice against the fact that I don't own a 924/944; maybe
some members of the net will offer their experiences.

It took me some rereading of the owner's manual to figure out how to
remove the sunroof.  If you don't have the owner's manual, then it would
be very difficult to figure out this procedure.

To disengage the lifting "forks" to remove the sunroof, the ignition switch
must be *off*!  With the ignition off, press the sunroof switch towards its
open position.  You should hear the sunroof motor run for a moment
whilst it is retracting the lifting forks.  After pulling the front 
hinge levers
open, you can remove the sunroof (with the door open, you press under
the sunroof with one hand and grab it on top with the other).

Now, if the motor doesn't run when pressing the sunroof switch with the
ignition off, then you probably have a bad sunroof relay.  I don't have the
service manual with me, and I forget exactly where the relay is.  It is either
on the relay/fuse board under the dash, or back by the sunroof motor.  If
you would like, I could check my service manual.

~ 
~ Not knowing about the internal physical differences between the cars, 
~ here's my stab at it:

Knowing at least some of the mechanical differences between the cars,
here's some actual hard data:

The 924S was the factory's last (so far :-) effort to build an 
"affordable" Porsche that wouldn't be an embarrassment to the
name.  It used the narrow-fendered 924 body and the less-
expensive 924 interior, but got the 944's half-a-928 engine
in place of the old Audi 100 block that had gone in the original
924.

There were several other differences.  The 944 has forged lower
control arms in the front that wouldn't fit in the narrower 924
body, so the 924S retains the 924 front suspension bits.  In
addition, the 924 body is lighter and more aerodynamic (due to
its smaller frontal area if nothing else), so early tests with 
the 944 motor in the 924S made it both quicker and also blessed
with a higher top speed than its contemporary 944.  I faintly
remember some very un-Porsche-like fumfuhing with excuses for
detuning the engine in the 924S on ludicrous grounds like "um,
the engine bay isn't big enough for the right exhaust manifold
so we had to, uh, fit a different one and, er, that's why the
much more expensive 944 is still quicker than the cheap 924S."

Much depends on what you want to do with the car.  The 924S is
very competitive in SCCA autocrossing's C Stock category, with
San Francisco-based Franklin Wong a recent National champion.  
Autocrossing of course rewards cars that are slightly narrower,
as long as it's not so much that handling is adversely affected,
as it gives a little more clearance to miss cones.  The first
time Franklin beat me, I was driving a friend's Miata in my
first autocross after a year spent road-racing an EP MGB.  "Gee,
this Mazda feels almost exactly like my MGB," I said, the first
time I ever drove the car (which was on the course).  There was
a THUMP as I knocked down a cone with the right-front corner.
"Only it's about ten inches wider than the B."  I hit a pile of
cones on that run, got it down to only two cones by the last
run, and that's part of the reason that the car's owner, as well

~ IT costs more because people are willing to pay more. 

And that's the truth; any object, from a Coney Island hot dog to a
959, is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  

~ Why not decide which one you like better against your own 
~ standards (subjective: looks, objective: engine, drivetrain 
~ etc) and then worry about the price.

Again, sound advice for buying any car that exceeds the basic
necessities of transportation in some substantive way.

If what you want is the sensation of speed, precision handling,
and the sound of the 944's engine, either car will do it and with
the money you save on the 924S you can outfit the car with a
second set of rims and tires for competition.  (I looked into 
doing exactly this last year.)  If what you want is recognition
on the street, you'll have to pony up for the 944.  Plus of course
the later 944 variants had more performance than the 924S due to
larger engines, more valves, and in the top-end versions, turbocharging.
I don't have the yearly breakdown committed to memory, but I think it's
actually in the FAQ, or at least some of the details are.

Me?  I've always admired the integrity that Porsche showed with the
924S, and I think it demonstrates the difference between Porsche
and the domestic auto industry to compare the 924S to the Camaro RS.
Both cars were marketed as less-expensive versions of their respective
line -- the 924S an introduction to the 944, the Camaro RS a cheaper
Z-28.  (Admittedly, one of the reasons for the RS was to counteract
rising insurance claims on V8-powered Camaros, but for this list we
can stretch a point, I think. :-)

Chevrolet put the graphics, spoilers, and wheel package from the Z-28
on a V6-powered Camaro so that people on the sidewalk wouldn't know 
which car you had.

Porsche put the drivetrain from the 944 in the less-expensive body of
the 924 so that the *driver* would know.

As a driver, rather than a spectator, I know which choice *I'd* prefer...

I don't know the Speedster that well, but are you absolutely sure this
material is different from other 356s? My daily driver 356 has original
vinyl on the dash, it's been out in the sun so long it's kind of crispy and
maybe feels like oilcloth. As far as I know, they only used one kind of
vinyl for the cars. It wouldn't make sense to have a different type for the
Speedsters. Could your dash have been recovered at some point?
 
Fairly good matches, color as well as texture, are available for the vinyl.

Subject: Re: Euro-cars 'designed' to req maintainence

Here's a nasty thought I had the other day which, perhaps, some of our
European friends can confirm or refute:

It has always seemed to me that European cars have delivered very well in the
handling (fun factor) department and (especially Porsche) in the quality of
fit and finish. But it has also always seemed to me that there was a
disproportionate premium in $$ charged for horsepower. 

Could it be that we are (willing) victims of a fluke in European tax laws
which causes manufacturers like Porsche to prefer small-displacement, highly
stressed designs over (American practice) larger displacement, less highly
stressed designs which provide more low-end torque? I have heard that there
is a tax based in part on the displacement of the cars engine, and also the
number of seats (which is why p-cars have the useless rear 'seats').

Paying more because of limited production makes sense to me; paying more
because of tax laws in countries I don't live in does not.

Does any of this ring true?

The horsepower difference is only with regards to early 924 years.  The '87-'88
924S had the exact same drivetrain as the same years' 944 with 150 HP.  
The biggest
difference in these cars is the track:

	924S		944
	-------		-------
wheels	6J		7J
front	1419mm		1477mm
	55.86"		58.14"

rear	1393mm		1451mm
	54.84"		57.13"

Note that the 944 also comes with one inch wider wheels and can accommodate 8
inch wheels in the rear.

I think the biggest explanation for the cost difference is guilt by 
association.
The 924S looks nearly identical to the Audi drive-trained earlier model 924.
The 944 looks more sexy/agressive with its flared fenders and hatch spoiler.
Consequently, the 924S is quite a bargain.

Actually I think he was trying to compare the 924S to a 944.  The 924S
has the same drive train as the 944.  Since the 924S is better 
aerodynamically, it is actually a bit faster.  These both have 150 hp
in US trim.  

These are the advantages I can think of.

924S advantages:

Price, aerodynamics.

944 advantages:

Dash - The 924S doesn't have the newer 4 gauges layout of the 85.5+ 944s. 
Wheel sizes - Because of the bigger wheel arches, 944s will take bigger
              wheels.  Anyone know the "maximum" size that the 924S will
              take.
Sport suspension available.  I don't believe the 924S had this option.

Anything I missed or messed up? :)

That "S" after 924 needs to be capitalized; it's significant.
I covered the major differences in a posting from earlier
today.  There is a vast difference between a 924 and a 924S.

~ The 944 does have more horsepower (150 vs. 115), and is (I think) slightly 
~ bigger.  

The fender flares make it wider and permit the use of different lower
control arms (at least in front; don't remember about the rear).  Other
than that, the power difference between the 924S and the 944 ended up
being minimal, if any, as they used the same motor, not the Audi 100
block used in the original 924.

I looked it up, BTW, and the 924S was introduced in mid-1986 according
to the FAQ.  That august document has no information on how long the 
924S production was maintained; as with other Porsche products, I'd
guess that if there is a 1988 924S, it's probably marginally better
than a 1987.  It's highly competent autocross car, as well as an effective 
and inexpensive introduction to Porsches, at least for people to whom the 
word "coolant leak" doesn't elicit a blank, uncomprehending stare. :-)

Subject: Summary "car won't start" & other q's


Thanks to all of you who replied to my question earlier this week.
The symptoms were the following (for a 85.5 944):
	- car wouldn't start
	- you could hear the relays clicking and the hissing sound
	(which probably came from the injectors)
	- I was able to start the car by rolling it.
	- looked like a typical battery problem, but the battery
	is fairly new.

The culprit was the starter, as many of you guessed.  It cost me 
$280 for the rebuilt starter plus shipping costs and one hour labor.

I am told that my car needs an oil cooler or an oil cooler housing
pretty soon (or maybe just the sealants).  There's a small oil leak there 
and in the worst case the coolant can mix with the oil and cause some 
major problems.  Is this a typical 944 failure?  In worst case scenario,
how much would it cost?

Thanks in advance,

Thanks to Bart for injecting some sanity into a discussion that's 
been getting increasingly arrogant.

Different people have different needs/desires for a car. For
that matter, *one* person may have different needs and desires.
 
I now have the exact combination of cars I've been wanting for 
years: a wonderful sports car ('85 951) and a very useful 4WD
auto-transmission station wagon ('93 Subaru). The Subaru is just 
as excellent in its own way as the Porsche is in its. When I'm
driving around town or in snow, I'm really glad I have the Subaru.
When I go to the mountains in good weather, the Porsche is a dream.
(Although you might get a slightly different opinion from the
friend I took for a ride on California Highway 49 recently... :-) )

Oddly enough, my ex-boyfriend couldn't understand why anyone would
buy a car based on any criteria other than low cost and inexpensive
maintenance. He's as arrogant in his viewpoint as some of the Porsche
owners on this mailing list are in theirs. 

Let's drop the snide remarks about people who don't buy Porsches as
well as the stupid arguments about Toyotas, Infinitis, etc. etc., okay?
Then we can get back to important discussions, like how I can get to
that seemingly inaccessible front side light whose bulb has burned out. :-)

Today after crashing my right wheels into a sidewalk, popping the front 
right, I jacked the car up, removed the front right and replaced the 
popped Nitto with a Bridgestone 195/60 * 15" tire at Firestone for $82.13 
balanced.

I installed it, and the pull had gone, so I'm hoping my suspension is 
still straight.  I will be keeping my 16" BBS rear, and 15" BBS fronts 
for daily driving, but bought a set of Cookie Cutter 15"x6" wheels to use 
for "touring".  After burning up the rubber on them, I hope to use them 
with some 185x70x15" tires to take on long distances like 4 hours from 
the bay area to Tahoe.  

I also found an inexpensive strap to hold down my air box cover, it s a 
15" rubber tie-down with S hooks on the end for $1.49 at Target.  Now 
when I get a big backfire, the pop off valve will release into the air 
filter holder and have to go out the big air end.  I'm hoping that this 
will be sufficient release.

I"ve also read up on some back issues of Excellence and found that the 
'78 and maybe '79 had oil problems where sometimes there is trouble 
keeping oil in the right places, and that there was even a Porsche tech. 
note on this?  Sometimes revving high, I do have my oil level go down 
into the red, even though at idle or when very warm it's over the halfway

or other oil cooler make my engine last longer?

Thanks for answering my post re: Looking for 1955 Speedster dash covering.

At your suggestion, Greg, I talked to Cecil Beach today, but he has his

wasn't able to make contact today. Will try again Tuesday. First time I've

Pete, re: "I don't know the Speedster that well, but are you absolutely sure
this
material is different from other 356s?" I think it is different. The dash
and door sills are original and the car has never been in the sun, hardly
(you've heard the stories about the car never having been in the rain?). It
was sold here in Sacramento by Sammy Weiss (owned Oxford Motors, sold
English cars and Porsches, then got killed at Laguna) to the first owner, a
reporter for the Sacramento Bee. He kept it for a year, then sold it to the
first of three who used it exclusively as an E-Production race car. I was
the last of the three. The only time the car saw the sun was during
practice/qualifying and the race. Otherwise, under cover or in the garage. I
also have a '61 coupe, bought new. Big difference in dash covering. Cecil
Beach refers to the '55 material as vinyl canvas.

I may call Tim Goodrich and leave a message on his machine.

Thanks for your help.

At any rate, the radio relay is always energized because my ignition

Subject: Summer is here!

1) Went to NJ PCA Concours/Swap Meet at the Parsippany Hilton last Sunday. 
There was a nice showing of cars, mostly Porsches. The following were 
present, had license plates and were probably driven there:

Carrera Cup Car
'94 Carrera RSR Turbo (looked very trick, but what is it?)
Mercedes 300SL Gullwing (looked like a daily driver)
Ferrari's (don't know much about them - maybe a Daytona and a Super 
America)

The concours winner had done so the last 13 times.

2) At the swap meet, I purchased a Stable Energies harness support bar. It 
mounts on the B or C pillars and can support a racing harness and video 
camera. I did not buy the Camber Truss, because it required some minor 
modifications for clearance in my car. Any experience with Cambermeister or 
Racing Dynamics strut braces? Can anyone recommend easily installed (to 
stock mounting points) racing harnesses. I will probably go with the street 
legal 3" Schroth Rallye belts.

3) There was a recent ad in Autoweek for '94 Speedster Recaro seat 
take-offs@ $850 for the pair (they are already gone) from Sportique Motors. 
While at Paul Miller Porsche recently, I overheard an earnest customer 
negotiating the purchase of a Speedster, and demanding that they put in 
real seats. It seems like these Recaros may be finding their way to some 
swap meets. I am interested in them in burgandy. If they come up for sale 
in any club newsletters could whoever sees them please post to 
Porschephiles or E-mail me?

4) There was an article in the NY Post today about the new State Trooper 
Camaros. There is only one on Long Island and it goes 152mph. There is only 
one officer on Long Island approved to drive it and it's a she. It is 
marked and has a light bar. I saw one two weeks ago on Rt 195 near Cape 
Cod. It was teal, unmarked and had a Corvette (Tupperware?) pulled over.

5) The RX-7 list has had a discussion about using DOT-approved roadrace 
tires for the street. It seems that RE71R are well-thought of and last for 
up the 15K miles. They are being closed out by Project Racing @ $75/95 and 
Blackburn Racing @ $60, in both cases same price for all sizes, but not all 
sizes available. I find it difficult to believe that anything with a 30

Subject: [Q?] '82 928 Diagnostic lights ALL turn on


	I am considering the purchase of a '82 928. The air conditioner
is shot. Engine is ok and owner has records showing 3000 mi oil changes
and changed water pump and timing belt at 109K (110K now). 

	The owner told me about a problem with the diagnostics unit.
Apparently, a few times a month when he turns on the headlights, all the
warning lights illuminate as well. Then after 10 min or so they turn off.
Then it wont happen again for a few weeks. 

	Intermittent electrical problems are a pain in the ass, I know. 
The question is whether some board or chip simply needs to be swapped out.

	In what order should stuff be looked at? Anyone know a good LA 
area mechanic who could do it? Is there a way to figure out if this is
a minor or major headache before purchase?

	In some cars, failure of certain electrical portions can make
the car undrivable. How much compujunk is in a '82 928 anyway?

	Incidentally, I think I can find someone to check out the rest of
the car. My question primarily involves the status of the electrical/diagnostic
systems.

Thanks

I've been pretty lucky, my girlfriend and my porsche (930) get along 
really well. She(my girlfriend), now, naturally grabs the door handle and 
seat cushion when I speed up on the off ramps, and doesn't really 
complain until I exceed 115(not on the off ramps). I also talked my Porsche 
mechanic into 
converting my girlfriends manual steering 280 sl mercedes into power 
steering, I'm not sure if he's ever going to let me live that one down. 
While her car has been in the shop i've offered her my turbo many times, 
she now takes it reluctantly, and has actually started to enjoy it, ie 
telling me she now goes into the corners alittle faster and saw the turbo 
gauge hit .04 bar. I've been using the 930 as a daily driver for the past 
3 months while my v.w. crewcab(1/2 van&1/2pickup) has been in the paint 
shop undergoing a total restoration. I've just started putting it back 
together. By the time it's finished my mechanic will have forgiven me 
about the mercedes fiasco, and I can start working on him to install a 
911 3.2l motor and trans in the bus.

The prenuptual agreement idea is probably a good one.  In the early 80's,
my husband and I spotted a Toyota 2000GT (the coupe version of the car in
"You Only Live Twice") sitting in a driveway in Oakland CA looking very
neglected.  We sighed enviously, and went on our way.  We saw it there many
times after that.  It obviously was not in the hands of anyone who
appreciated it.  So one day, we knocked on the door to talk to the owner 
about buying it.  The owner wasn't home, but we talked to her housemate.
It turns out that the owner got the car in a divorce settlement.  Seems
her ex loved that car more than anything else, I believe he was the 
original US owner of the car.  Since hubby loved the car, that was the
ONLY thing she insisted on getting in the divorce settlement.  She claimed
she would NEVER sell it, because if she did, her ex might be able to get
the car back somehow.  So it stayed in her driveway.  Now THAT'S
vindictive.

We heard a few years ago that she eventually sold the car when prices
skyrocketed in the late 80s.  Rumor has it that her vindictiveness stopped
at the $100,000+ mark.  I just hope the car is in the hands now of someone
who will appreciate it.

PS: My husband and I are both Porsche nuts, auto racing nuts, and general

Take the other extreme. GM now claims its engines will go 100,000 miles
without major maintenance. At least that's what it claims in ads. But it
won't back that claim with a warranty, as far as I know. And I would really
like to see any engine go that far without something breaking -- water pump,
alternator, and we're not even getting into the black magic like brain
boxes. When those go, and they're out of warranty, think of that great ad
campaign while you peel the bills out of your wallet. I think 100,000 is
approaching the useful life of these things, not the time to first
maintenance.

Hi, Ted.
 
What your oil level gauge does when you rev it doesn't mean anything. RTFM.
That gauge is only to be read with the engine warm, at idle and while
standing on a level surface.
 
210 is a good operating temperature. You don't want it any cooler than that.
Think of it this way -- if it's too cool, the oil is more viscous and you
lose horsepower. Also if you have condensate (water) in the oil it won't
evaporate. Get the temp too high, and the oil viscosity is too thin. 210
sounds good. While we were testing engines on the dyno at Porsche, we used
to run lots hotter than that -- and for 600 hours, too.
 
I'd save the money for those aftermarket coolers. Maybe use it to buy extra
wheels and tires, mount them on the roof (London-Sydney Rally style).
Again, let us have fiancee's address...) Maybe find a late model
factory cooler to fit in the front fender. I don't know prices; are wrecking
yard prices for factory coolers higher than the aftermarket stuff? Try
Parts Heaven up in your area, I've had good experiences with them.

Ben, ben, ben... 

Where have you been, and why are you missing the point? :)

  The ownership of the various marques you cite has no bearing on the point.  
The point is that euro-cars, over a span of many, many years were designed with 
small engines because of factors like fuel cost (nearly universally at least 3 
times us fuel cost) and taxation based on displacement.  And oh, BTW, unless I 
am mistaken, the TVR uses a Ford V8...

  Oh, yeah, one small piece of advice, don't bet the farm on the outcome of 
*any* performance contest between a TVR and a 3.6L 930, or a 512 TR, or 348tb...

Sorin,

Sounds like you're talking about the seals on the oil/water heat
exchanger.  It's not that uncommon for them to leak, esp. on a car
which is nine years old.

It's not a lot of work to re-seal the manifold.  Make sure you use
the latest version of the rubber seals, which I believe are green.
Also make sure that the heat shield between the exhaust manifold and
oil/water heat exchanger is in place.  Speaking of heat shields, for
that matter you might also want to add the neighboring oil pan heat
shield which was added for MY86.  It protects the oil pan seal from
excessive heat coming from the exhaust.

The Carrera RS book is worth every penny.  These cars have been so
neglected in other P-books, it's about time someone did a complete history
of them.  

Besides having great pictures, stories, and detailed technical info, there
is a list of every 1973 RS ever built, and how each was originally equiped.
This is a must have book if you own, want to buy, or just lust after the
'73 RSs.  If you're more interested in the 1993 RS, it may not be worth
the price.

We got the book from Automobilia in SF (mail order).  I don't have their
phone number at the moment, but I could find it if you don't want to call
information.  Automobilia was selling the book at a discount, which was
a nice surprise.  For us, the book is worth the full price.

Subject: Re: ride height for a 911

Magnus,

You should set the ride height by measuring from the ground to an
appropriate suspension member, as described in the factory manuals or
spec booklette.  Measuring ride height to body panels is probably
ideal for concours, but really isn't the thing to do for best
handling.

For that matter, if you want to tune the height and suspension for
best handling in autocrossing and the like, an important first step
is to corner weight the car.  I've seen some pretty wild imbalances
in cars coming into the shop, all of which to my memory have been
easily corrected.

You should align the car with the weight in it which you expect to
carry when driving.  So perhaps a half tank of gas, unless you like
to autocross with as little fuel as possible in the tank.

The shop has two plastic milk crates we put onto the driver's seat.  We
fill them with weights to match the driver's weight.  The weights
themselves are of the body-building kind.

I went to Wheel Techniques and got a $130 estimate for fixing up my bent 
wheel.  However, I found out they are BBS RA cast wheels and not worth so 
much, so I'll just drive them until I can find some good Fuchs that will fit.

I also went down the street on Winchester Blvd. and picked up some BBS 
tin cup wheel caps for $10 each.  

BTW, they guy Jim? at Wheel Techniques has a really cute Akita, 6 months

Subject: Re:  Help on replacing brake pads !

Matt: 
I had a similar problem earlier. I wound up letting Aldo the 
Mechanic do it for me. The pads on my '86 are held in place with
a cloverleaf-shaped wire bracket which I could not figure out how 
to remove. The Net Wisdom at the time was that it didn't take a 
special tool but it was not intuitively obvious and was easiest to 
watch the mechanic do it. I didn't have time for that so I just 
told Aldo to do it. He did. 

Let me know if you have any luck. It's getting on towards pad-
replacement time again and I'd like to do it myself....

Subject: Girlfriends(Make that WIVES)/Porsches

We got a '76 911S after my daughter was born (had an RX7) to be our 
"sensible family car" (the Mazda only had two seats; 911 has four 
(sorta)).  We got rid of it when the shop time started being greater than 
drive time.  Now we have two kids, and I started looking at "sports" cars 
(read Corvettes, MGs, Austin Healys etc.) rather half-heartedly.  Note 
all those mentioned have TWO seats.  My wife INSISTS that we get another 
911 because otherwise we can't fit the family.  Besides, she LOVED the 
old 911.  My then 18 month old son climbed into a 911 I looked at last 
fall, sat in the front passenger seat and would NOT get out.  He still 
talks about the "Porch car."  So, I'm convinced.  It's fate. It's 
genetics.  It's just one of those things I'll have to learn to live with.

Moral of the story:  To all those folks dealing with 
girlfriends/fiances who don't seem to "get it,"  tell 'em its a "sensible 
family car" because someday you want to have kids and room for them and 
the wife as well!

Good luck!

Does anyone actually use the spare from the '77 911S, which is a heavy 
steel wheel, than needs some inflatable stuff to work?  I pulled mine out 
for the first time yesterday (when I had the flat), and couldn't believe 
how heavy it was.  I did have the original tool kit, starting to get 
moldy though, but did not have a canister of ozone reduction inflation 
material, nor would I have trusted it if it were there.  Is there a 
replacement part from Kragen, or god forbid, Automotion that will make 
this bizarre looking tire work in an emergency?

Subject: British Cars

The British cars developed under some very interesting rules.  There was
a large tax on new automobiles, but not on cycles.  This led to a whole
family of interesting (and unstable) 3-wheel cars.  Engines tended to
be taxed on piston area and not on horsepower.  Did you ever notive how
tall a Jaguar engine is with its long stroke.  It has very high piston speeds
because of its long stroke and small piston diameter.

The British tradition was that cars needed fine finish and that there
were plenty of mechanics to fiddle with the machinery.  Reliability
developed elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we didn't have the mechanics here.

An interesting contrast to the British car reliability in the 50's and
60's was the VW Beetle, which often went well past 100,000 miles before
significant engine maintenance (other than tuning and valve adjustment).
Were similar engines used elsewhere?

Subject:      Advice wanted on 91 944S2


I'd like to get the advice of the net on a 1991 944S2 that we looked at
yesterday.  The car is in *mint* condition with 5,500 miles on the
odometer.  Is this mileage so low that I should be worried?  The car is
a metallic plum color that the dealer calls Amethyst.  This was an
optional color in 1991.  The car has the 16" C2 wheels.  I copied down
the option line from the sticker by the spare tire, but the dealer
could identify only one of the option numbers for me (946 - partial leather).
The other options listed were 454, 573 and 650.  Can anyone help me
identify these options?  Is the suspension on this car the same as on
the turbo?

Now for some opinions.  Does anyone have an idea of what this car
should be worth?  The dealer wants 28K with the 1-year Porsche
warranty.  Would you expect it to hold its' value well over the
next two to three years?

We're searching for a new car to upgrade our 87 944S that we use
for autox and track events as well as a daily driver.  My wife
and I share the car at the track.  This is pretty hard on the
brakes since they sometimes don't get a chance to cool down
between run groups.  Our 87 also has the 16" C2 wheels.  How much
better would the S2 be at the track than our S?  Would we be
better off waiting a while and then picking up a 92 968?

What the hell is wrong with some of you guys? Your comments about things you

Pete, it's good for ya' you had your experiences with Porsche, R&T (or was 
it C&D?), etc. I like your professional advices too, really serving people

There's an access flap in the fenderwell liner.  Turn the wheel to the 
side (or remove it) and you'll see a little trap door.  Pull or push 
it, then reach around and unscrew the 2 white plastic knobs on the 
light's backside.  It's just like the rear lights, which you can 
examine in your trunk cubbies.

You'll get scraped knuckles from the hard plastic door trying to shut 
on your hand...

I don't think this forum benefits from the bandwith wasted by *FLAME WARS* so I 
will only point out that anyone who has any knowledge of the Porsche world knows
that the appelation *Maestro* is, in this case, one well earned, and awarded by 
the community at large, but most especially to those grateful 356 owners who 
have benefited from this gentleman's unselfish sharing of his unparalled 
knowledge of the breed and its idiosyncrasies.

Can't help on ID of the option, but since this comes with the warranty, you can 
be confident that the milage is correct.

All cars depreciate.  Look at the pattern over the last few years.  
Copy the numbers and do some spreadsheet analysis.  

Remember that the dealer is asking a premium price for a premium car
determined by the low miles.  If you put a bunch of miles, and you autox
the living hell out of it, you will no longer have a *premium* car, and
your depreciation will be greater.  If that's your plan, IMHO, you could 
be better off to buy something less *premium* 

Decide how much you can afford to pay, and how much depreciation you 
can live with.  No one can answer these questions for you.

See discussion above, same applies.  OTHO, the S2 is 2.7L vs 2.5L 
for your S.  Hot rodders are right, IMHO, *ain't no substitute for
cubic inches* - *all other things being equal*.  and...as with all
Porsches, newer is usually better due to the factory's running 
up-grade policy.

Subject: Three 944 questions...


  Last week my father & I bought a 1987 944 here in Raleigh, NC.  It is
stock but does have the optional touring package.  Since I do tech
inspections for Car Guys I have driven quite a few cars, including
several 944's and 951's so I was puzzled when I drove this one and found
that it was Impossible to heel-and-toe b/c the gas pedal was a good
three inches below the brake peddle.  Is this normal???  Unless I hear
otherwise, I will bend the metal bar supporting the pedal so that it is
more even with the brake pedal.

The other 2 questions are...

  1.  At the end of the throttle cable, there are two places to attach
the cable.  Will the other one (the one closer to the driver's left of
the car) give better throttle response?  It almost looks like a racing
part.

  2.  Where is the cheapest place to get a K&N filter for the car? 
Racer Wholesale want $55; this is the lowest I have found so far.  Also,
does anyone run their 944 with the air intake tube off?  (The tube
leading from the airbox to the front fender.)  It looks like removing
this would free up the intake a bit.

If anyone has ANY other suggestions for the car, they would be most
appreciated.

TIA,

Well, since I started this, I will try to end it.  I agree, no one should 
be bad mouthing anyone here, and my comments on the Maestro and 356s were 
uncalled for, and I apologize.

For all I know the Maestro is a fine guy, I've called him for advice, and 
he's been most helpful.  Whether he knows about 356's or not is not a big 
deal to me, as I don't own one.  He does seem to know about mechanical 
basics, and if he likes to make movies and claims about his engines that 
are logistically difficult to prove, or if he is just chicken to race, 
there's nothing wrong with that.  

My boss, a professional manager, wants to race me in his Mustang 5.0 
litre, but I won't (at least not yet...)  If I'm going to race someone 
with a lot of visibility, I need to have a high assurance I'm going to 
win.  The Maestro is possibly in the same position, building a race 356, 
or so I think I've heard... ;)

Enough of that.  Now on to Trond's personal attack:

Please clarify here.  Which comment was it that seems to be "pullin' your 
chain" ? ;)  I don't have any gold chains or designer stuff, nor did I 
ever imply anyone else here did.

Pete will have to defend himself, but wasn't it the Maestro who has used 
name playing in print with some of his 356 engine builder competitors??

Surely you read the 356 rags??

Subject: C2 ride height 

Can anyone that has a 93 C2 give me the height of his car from 
the ground to the top of the wheel well (outside body panal). 
Mine measures 27.5 inches front and 27 inches in the back. 
Everyone who sees my car says it sits too high.  Since I bought 
it new Im wondering if it is within factory spec.  I have the 
factory spec of 175mm front and 280mm back but Im not sure 
where they are measuring from.  I would like to lower the car 
if I could without doing a spring replacement. Can this be done 
? Thanks.

Hello Porschephiles,

A friend is looking for a set of used Weber 46IDA carbs for his 911 race car.
 If you have any leads (or a spare set of carbs in your garage), give Walt
Fricke a call at 303-499-6540.

Thanks,

Subject: Carb Adjustment?


This is not a Porsche question, but a motor question, nonetheless. 
Hopefully, someone can help.

I put a new 2 bbl carb in my boat. The boat seems to work well with one 
exception. The motor bogs down when accelerated from about 2000 rpm (maybe 
the transition from primary to seconary?) It idles ok and accelerates well 
at higher rpm. The dwell and timing are OK. Any insight into the problem 
would be greatly appreciated.

No, this isn't normal.  All 944 pedal cluster should be identical.  
Sounds like yours has been changed or damaged.  I wouldn't recommend 
just _bending_ the metal back, as the arm may be severely weakened.  
Get a new/used replacement if you determine that to be the problem.  
Also check the cable and throttle housing, etc.

Subject: Re: Three 944 questions...

Ty,

The 944 pedals are set up, out of the box, for best heel/toe under
heavy braking, eg, at the track or autocross.  Deep into the brakes,
you find the throttle pedal right about where it belongs.  You can, I
believe, adjust pedal heights to suit if you'd like them a little
different.

Bending one of the pedal arms would be a really bad thing to do.  If
it didn't break right away, it will probably do so eventually.

I don't know about the throttle cable pick-up.  I think the factory
linkage is just fine.  What problem are you trying to solve?

Jim,

The options are cruise control, A/C, and sunroof, in that order.  BTW,
for whoever asked some time ago what option C02 is, it specifies a
catalytic converter.

If your problem sharing the car with your wife is due to brake
overuse/overheating, your best bet is additional cooling and/or a
higher temp fluid.  For cooling 944 brakes, the only show in town is
the Holbert Cool Brake kit, now sold by Bob Russo.

To contradict what someone else said, Cool Carbons are likely only to
exacerbate a cooling problem.  They are wonderful, and I do recommend
them.

Great that your wife tracks the car with you!

Subject: Dash caps

The May issue of Excellence has an ad from Tweeks for Dash Caps at 20%
off ($103 for 928).

Like many others, I have cracks in my 928 dash.  Are these worth it?
Are they as easy to install as claimed?  How do they look?  How
detectable are they once they're on?  

I'd like something to look seamless and original, and if these look like
someone just slapped a cap on a ratty dash then I'll pass.  

Any help/advice/experience is welcomed!

Subject: 911 Pre-purchase

Would like advice:  Should I have the local Porsche dealer/shop do a 
pre-purchase on a 911 they have been servicing the last 8 years or should 
I take it elsewhere?  They've always been straight with me about my VW, 
but a Porsche (despite some skeptics claims) "ain't no VW."  I see 
advantages to going there because they have the history of the car in 
their files, but I had a bad experience with a previous Porsche purchase 
(not in this area) when I had a guy do the pre- who had serviced the 
car.  Appears he and the seller were buddies from his years of faithful 
business and I think seller ended up buying another car from the guy 
after I bought his 911.

Also, does anyone have any suggestions for a place to do the pre-purchase in 
the Lansing (MICH) area?
 
 Thanks for your insights.

I will apologize (a bit) Ted, but you've been very harsh in these 
discussion, even without 356 knowledge (no big deal..) you make a great 
cheerleader everytime it is time to discuss Pellow-Albrecht. So accept my 
apologize, the context of my message should be ;

It is just that when you have no clue of what these gentlemen discuss, nor

Subject: Old car mags.

hi,

Sunday I visited the largest multi-make car meeting in Norway. There was a 
little swap meet in one of the corners. I found a guy selling old 40-50-60's 
car magazines, I took his adress and boght one magazine from him. I wasn't 
too sure whether his prices were high or low, so I will have to ask you guys 
for advice.

I bought the October '61 issue of Road&Track, he charged $6 for it, rating 
the state of the magazine from 1 to 5, this magazine was a 2-3. But the 
contents were 1. It had a test report on the '61 1600N, and a special 
version s-90GT. Among other funny historia, there were ads for 166vignale 
spyder(Ferrari) for about $3000, and a RSK spyder for $7500.

What is a 'decent' price for fifties car magazines over in the US? Any 
special issues I should ask for when i contact this fellow again?(Porsche 
stuff.)

He seemed to have C&D, R&T, and many more,....almost complete collection.

cheers,

	Yes please.

	Has anyone done anything similar for the 911? I hope to change my
944 for a 3.2 Carrera in a month or so, and I've been warned that
there are an awful lot of *bad* cars out there, so a checklist would
be very helpful.

Subject: Monthly Message

June 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

This list has a growth rate like a Certain Pink Bunny -- it just keeps 
going and going and going.... We are over 700 members now, and if we'd
kept all the people that joined and dropped off within a week, we'd be
closer to 850... Something to think about as you start recommending this
to your friends!

Otherwise, list operation is running smoothly. There are some changes
in the offing, Real Soon. You'll hear it here first...

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.
P.O. Box 10402
Alexandria VA 22310

Does take non-US membership. You *MUST* have a Porsche VIN number to join.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy.
Or they'll send you an application which you can mail in with your check.

National membership chairman is Nann Weissenberger who is reachable via
e-mail at n_weissenberger@harvard.edu.   You can ask her for info or 
get her to send you an application as well. 


Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 860792
Fax	    +44 451 860011

Specialty clubs:

356 Registry Inc.
27244 Ryan Rd. 
Warren, MI, 48092

For 356 enthusiasts around the world. $20 per year for US members, $35 for
world-wide members -- and cheap at twice the price!!! (Vic Skirmants' racing 
column is worth that, as are the classifieds...) 
5000 happy members can't be wrong! 

P.S. You *DON'T* have to own a 356 to join, and if you think you want to
own one, this is the best place to buy. No one seems to expect concours
prices for their cars unless they have a real concours car.

914 Owner's Association
100 South Sunrise Way, Suite 116
Palm Springs CA 92262

Over 2000 members in over 20 countries. Dennis Deeds published the club
newsletter, Mid-Engined Views, quarterly. Membership is $22 a year.
Again, they don't require you own an 914 to join, but they are interested
in the lowest and highest serial numbers known for each year model.

"S" Registry

Contact Vern Lyle, Box 363,
West Point, PA 19486 (tele (215) 652-7011 (day), (215) 287-5083 (eve). 
Dues are $20/yr with a quarterly newsletter. Dedicated to all early
911S models.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Stuck odometer


Hiya!
  Can anyone please advise me on how to fix an odometer that fails to roll?

The problem:  Both the upper and trip odometers remain stationary while the 
	      car ('83 944) is being driven.  All other instruments & gauges
	      (esp. the speedometer) appear unaffected.

I have a pretty good idea of the cause, but of course, I can't be sure:
While on the I-880, something (a hubcap?) flew off a car that was ahead
of me in an adjacent lane.  It hit me.  My friend, who was following behind
me at the time, said he saw the object come up from under my car and was then 
subsequently hit by it too.  After a quick inspection, I saw no visible 
damage to the body, let out a "whew!" and thought the matter was closed.
The next day, however, I noticed my odometer(s) wouldn't budge.

I've thumbed through my Haynes manual, but the book doesn't touch the
subject of odometer repairs, instead referring the reader to an authorized 
dealer.  Is such a job really that sensitive or difficult?  If so, can
anyone estimate the cost (both time and parts) involved in such a repair?

Despite not knowing what to look for, I propped up the car anyways and took a 
look underneath.  I looked all over for any signs of damage.  I found a dent in
the undercover, but otherwise, no loose or severed cables/lines.  Where 
*should* I have been looking anyhoo?     ?:\

Thanks a bunch!

You have to understand life here is very different. I have driven large
parts of both Europe and the States. Distances for european
journeys are on the whole shorter ("The English think 100miles is a long
way, the Americans think 100years is a long time!"). Journeys are conducted
along much windier (read more driver involvement!) roads. Generally to
travel for more than 3-4 hours is condidered a "Big" journey. Add to this fuel
costs. Fuel is approx 3-4 TIMES  the cost. (I remember someone on the list
worked out you'd need to drive a small Honda in Europe to pay the same in
fuel as a 930 in the States).

Over here an Chevy or such like is  a. A rarity and
				    b. Expensive in fuel terms.


The fuel tax is a distinct encouragement to buy a smaller engine. It has
also been argued that is also a more effective way of reducing emmisisions.
If you burn less fuel in a slightly dirtier manner then the emmisions will
be the same (and you don't have carry all of the extra emmissions C**P).

To show what is meant by distances, most Dealers in the UK refer to
the ~12K mile serivce as an "annual" service and indeed your average
family man doesn't even get that many miles.

The final point is the our cars are smaller because out cities are small.
Most European cars come into the American "compact" classification and
are therefore lighter etc and so don't big engines. The cars fit our
countries like Chevy Caprices and Ford Taruses etc are the right size
the American market. So basically yes they are more stressed engines
but for many different reasons than you suggest.


Incidently the 924 is a classic case in point about emmisions. The "world"
variant produces 125bhp in all variants met all of the emission regualtions
except Federal ones. The US variants changed virtually every model year and
produced as much as 115bhp (some produced 96bhp). My european GM carbed 1.6L
boring family sedan produces that much (96) with better encomony and has lasted
180K miles (so far!).

Dear Subscribers,

Over the weekend, I have received enough mail from irrate subscribers

it. I'll give you all until close of business Wednesday to be in compliance

dealing with Porsche) in terms of signal to noise content. So discussion
of personal characteristics of individual subscribers will not be
tolerated, nor will extended discussions "off the topic" such as relative
merits of other cars, girlfriends, or whatever.

In particular, personal attacks will not be tolerated. If someone is 
wrong, you are certainly encouraged to say so. But calling them a fool

If you don't like this, too damn bad. Either voluntarily drop off the

Thanks to Bart for injecting some sanity into a discussion that's 
been getting increasingly arrogant.

Different people have different needs/desires for a car. For
that matter, *one* person may have different needs and desires.
 
I now have the exact combination of cars I've been wanting for 
years: a wonderful sports car ('85 951) and a very useful 4WD
auto-transmission station wagon ('93 Subaru). The Subaru is just 
as excellent in its own way as the Porsche is in its. When I'm
driving around town or in snow, I'm really glad I have the Subaru.
When I go to the mountains in good weather, the Porsche is a dream.
(Although you might get a slightly different opinion from the
friend I took for a ride on California Highway 49 recently... :-) )

Oddly enough, my ex-boyfriend couldn't understand why anyone would
buy a car based on any criteria other than low cost and inexpensive
maintenance. He's as arrogant in his viewpoint as some of the Porsche
owners on this mailing list are in theirs. 

Let's drop the snide remarks about people who don't buy Porsches as
well as the stupid arguments about Toyotas, Infinitis, etc. etc., okay?
Then we can get back to important discussions, like how I can get to
that seemingly inaccessible front side light whose bulb has burned out. :-)

That's a big problem with newer engines. The electronics are the single
thing most likely to require major service. Especially when a battery goes
low or something. As a counter-example to Pete's "would really like to see",
my '81 Toyota Corolla engine has now gone 207,000 miles with no such breakage.
The car is on its third transmission, but the engine goes up to 4000 miles
between oil changes and never needs to have any oil added. Runs like a top...
maybe I'm just lucky. Alternator? I'd hardly count that as part of the engine.

Subject: 944 Tire Pressures


The owners manual for my 1985/2 944 specifies tire pressures at 29 psi for 
the front and 36 psi for the rear. My wheels are the stock 15 x 7 cookie 
cutters with tires sized 215/60VR15 as recommended in the owners manual.

I find it unusual that there is such a great difference between the front 
and rear tire pressures - especially in a car with a near 50/50 weight 
distribution.

I have a few guesses at the reason for this:

1. To encourage understeer.

2. To minimize the front camber change which was a problem in the early 944.

3. To soften the ride at the front end.

4. To minimize wheel hop at the read end under accelleration.

The tire chalking that I did at one autocross last year seemed to indicate 
that the front tire pressure should be higher than 29 psi. Setting the 
pressures to 32 psi all around seemed to improve the handling by reducing 
the understeer.

Why should the front tire pressure be 7 pounds lower than the rear tire 
pressure?

Subject: Stuck odometer

Rich

My 914 has the same kind of problem: speedometer works, but the
odometer & trip odometer don't turn.  I can manually roll the odometer
by cycling the trip odometer, but other than that nothing.  I've been
assuming that the problem is internal to the speedometer unit and not
the result of a damaged cable or drive gear.  I suspect this could be
coincidence.  If you hear about an external cause of odometer failure,
would you pass it along please?

In VDO speedos from Audis, a broken odometer drive gear is pretty
common.  The drive gear in these units is a dime-sized nylon affair
that tends to crack.  The odometer apparently will operate for a long
time with a crack drive gear but eventually it gives up and stops
working.  Does anyone know if Porsche VDO speedos use a similar nylon
gear?

I've often wondered if a machinist (maybe a model maker) could
fabricate an aluminum replacement gear, but never pursued it.  With
the Audi, we always opted to scrounge up a used speedo with the good
odometer; broken Audis are plentiful (thus not too dear) around the
salvage yards here.  Precision machine work on the other hand is
expensive.

Any thoughts, experience?

     I tried installing the hard-plastic dash cover on a 924 years ago,

   used one on a non-P car and liked it. I've been happiest with the
   fabric-type of dash cover--the fit is flexible, and IMHO I think the 
   non-OEM look is fine. Its also possible to fit it over a warped leather
   dash.
    The vinyl dashes on Porsches wear poorly, the leather ones just horrible.
   I realize that temps on the dash are probably over 130'f in the summers
   but it seems the Germans can't equal US cars when it comes to rubbers.

     Has anybody had experience with these guys (like "Just Dashes") who 
   rebuild dashes ? For a Porsche dash, I mean...

In a last year Panorama one factory rep was quoted as saying the
oil level gauge was to be used strictly "as a source of amusement"
(ie, pay no attention to it).  Here's better practical advice: Ignore
it almost all the time, except when the engine is fully warmed up
and the car is idling on level ground.  And even then only use it as
a rough approximation, once you've gotten used to how it matches
up with a real dip stick reading.  The accuracy of this gauge has
varied wildly among the Carreras I've owned.

Okay, so it's the tires that smoke, but it's still part of your

    Or, get oil leaking out of your pushrod tubes (for aircooled

However, I'll miss the discussion of girlfriends/wives/partners and other

Now I suppose I won't get to tell about letting my daughter drive the 911 
for the first time without DAD!! Of course, I followed behind in the 
family truckster as we transported about 2 million teenagers from the river 
for Memorial day.  As long as I was in the rear view mirror everything 
was fine, but I had forgotten about the twisty road coming up from the 
Snake river breaks.  As soon as the curves intervened, BOOM my 911 SC was 
a memory, last seen moving fast and getting smaller.

Well, the family truckster finally found the 911 at home, safe and sound. 
And my daugher even had an explanation.  I had told her that her friends 
better not even sneze in my car, so naturally, when one wanted to sneeze 
she had to hurry home and drop him off, so she wouldn't get into 
trouble.  

That could happen, right.  ;)

Subject: RE: Stan's Message



Hi there,

I'm a digest person, mostly because I have a lot to do and it lets me 
keep an eye on things Porsche-related and see if articles I'm preparing
are in tune with the flavor of what people are interested in. I rarely
find it necessary to make a comment about people or inane jabberings.

Please stop the acid verbage. Take it off-line if you feel it necessary
to converse this way. I've been around long enough to appreciate this
forum and DO NOT like it being spoiled in this manner. A simple `I 
disagree with your position' statement is enough. I CAN teach Stan how
to deal with the miscreants as though he was in the MARINES.

Nothing from any of the major offenders dissappoints me more than the 
trash language and personal slams listed before. I expect a lot more 
from all of you considering the personal reputations you possess in 
your aspects of the Porsche world. 

I have found that people try to use (consiously or unconsiously) their
hobbies as a way of actualizing whatever they haven't achieved in life,
I'm hoping that you don't fail at Porsche ownership also. A lot of the
people that go out of their way to offer help are trying to give their
$.02 that might help someone else avoid an expensive repair or a less
costly alternative to their problem. Some own shops or have a commercial
business that deals with Porsches, this is fine, but there shouldn't be
promotionals unless approved or condoned by the ListMeister in advance.

Should anyone wish to comment on my remarks, comment to me directly. 
This should be considered off-line correspondance from this point on, 
much the same as the subject matter above.

I have a similar situation with my '77 911s, the main odometer works 
fine, as do the gauges (tach currently unplugged), but the trip odometer 
does not work, but the reset button twitches it, so I feel it's minor to 
fix, if I can just get in there somehow.

Subject: Re:924S vs 944


I remember reading in a Road and Track article that the 924S is actually
faster than the 944, having the same engine but in a lighter chassis with
a smaller frontal area. But it doesn't match up in handling, which the
wider track 944 excels at. I've never driven a 924S so I can't add anything
from experience.

Rich, this may be a dumb question... but every odometer I've ever
seen (and I've not seen _yours_) is driven off the same cable which 
drives the speedometer. Since you say the speedometer runs OK, I'd
not suspect the cable or driver. You may have just had a fortuitious
breakdown which happened at the same time as your "incident" on I-880.
Another possibility: the thing which hit your undercarriage may have 
whacked the cable, and the shock traveled up the cable and dislodged a
gear or follower inside the speedometer housing; then the cable returned
to its' original postion and speedo works fine. Long shot, but there have
been longer ones.

I honestly have no idea how to repair an odometer. If this happened to
my '83 944 (currently in storage), I'd find a replacement speedo/odometer
from a used parts supplier.

My RS America with the M030 package has struts with threaded
perches to allow some adjustment of ride height.  For my 

purposes, this has turned out to be insuffucient, so I bought
some shorter springs.  By running the adjustment nuts on the
perches to their lowest stop all around, the front is higher
than the rear with the factory springs :-(.

Since I'm still awaiting shipment of the factory manual set I 

unfortunately don't have the information handy, but will post 

the info when I get them.

I guess the irony is too much for me, to see such a varied mailing list 
encompass both the current highest performing cars available, and the 
current lowest performing cars available at exhorbitant prices.

Now before you have a cow here, I have realized that these are historical 
collectors items, that make up for their lack of performance with 
impressive head turning capabilities (of on-lookers).  

In an ideal world, we would have a mailing list with following divisions:

Real Porsche performance cars for everyday drivers (e.g. 911s)

Mid Performance Porsche cars (e.g. water cooled vw's, 944s, 924s, Rabbit)

Cars for the rolling tupperware gold chain crowd (Turbo 911s or Turbo 
look wanna be cars)

Historical Porsche Automobiles (those beloved cars which were the fastest 
available around D-Day.)

ps: I am being a little sarcastic above, if you haven't figured it out,

Subject: Late 2.7 Engine for sale

        I  recently replaced the 2.7 in my 1977 911S with a 3.2.  I now
need to get rid of the 2.7 as it is taking up a lot of space.  
        The engine was built at the end of the production cycle and has all
the factory mods made to the 2.7 engine (e.g., it came with divlar studs
and improved air baffles).  It has 150K miles but was not giving me any
problems.  The temps were always good (it came with a trombone cooler) and
even with the a/c on during FL summers, I never saw the oil temp above
220F.  The last time I checked, the compression was at the low end of
acceptable and the between cylinder values were good.  The engine has the
fuel injection, complete exhaust system, a/c compressor, sheet metal, and
everything else that had to be taken out to put the new engine in.  
        I can put in touch with the person who takes care of the high-end
maintenance for me and who could answer any other questions you may had. 
Please contact me directly (wise@db.erau.edu) for more info or to make an
offer.  

Thanks!

Call Intersport in Vienna, VA, (703) 242-8680.  A lot of the PCA Potomac Region
members swear by them and for good reason.  They do good work at a reasonable
price.  I'd recommend Ivan Arzola, who  services a number of 944s for club
members.  He also has taken care of my '72 911 Targa for the last two years,
going back to the days when he was at Foreign Service.  When he left, most of
his customer left with him and followed him to Intersport.  Give Ivan a call.
Tell him I sent you.  When he stops cussing, he'll do right by you <g>.

[story about meeting with hubcap deleted]

The odometers are driven by the same cable as the speedometer.  If the
speedometer is working, then their is nothing wrong outside of the speedometer
case.  I would not recommend opening the speedometer case unless you
have watchmaking experience.  It is full of tiny springs and gears.  (Later
speedometers are full of microchips; they have evolved in the same way
as watches!)  I am not sure if I would trust the local speedometer shop
with my Porsche, but the dealer would probably want to just replace it
rather than repair it ($$$).  I'd make some phone calls to speedometer
shops and Porsche mechanics to see what information I could gather.

Lou, and schless and the original poster, whose name I have misplaced,

The sunroof opening procedure obviouly varies by model year.  I suspect
it is directly related to the interior upgrade that occurred at the 
85-1/2 model
year change.

On my '84, the manual explicitly states that the ignition must be off.  
The ignition
switch has only three positions: (going clockwise) off, on, and start; 
there is no
"auxilary" position.

At any rate, I hope that the original poster has had some luck in removing his
sunroof!

My 1969 911T has a dash cap on it, but this is for a normal errand running car.

I'll never be entering it in a car show.

The dash cap doesn't look original, but it isn't bad from a distance (>4 feet).

Advantages are
   1. Low price
   2. Easy installation, since the 911 requires removal of the windshield
      to install a new dash.
   3. Probably more resistant to cracking than the OEM dash
   4. Better visually than a typical cracked 911 dash.
   5. Better visually than the cloth type dash protectors

Disadvantages are
   1. Not a perfect fit, it bulges somewhat in spots
   2. Not perfect match for texture, sheen.

BTW, after a repaint, I bought a new OEM dash for the 1972 911T.

Incidentally, J.C. Whitney also sells the Dash Caps or similar.
Probably lower price than Tweeks.

I need to replace the front wheel bearings in my 1981 911SC.  Is this

only) replacement.

******************************************************


I did two sets recently (puh-leeese, two different cars...) on 'SC's

Jack and correctly support the front wheel(s).

Remove the front hub.  Note: other stuff may have to be removed too.

The outer bearing just falls off.

The inner bearing is pressed into the hub.

I removed it by pounding it (carefully - BLAM - BLAM - BLAM!!!  ;-) 
out with a punch.  If you have a press and the correct sized cylindrical
tool, that would work better.

As they like to say, installation is the reverse of removal (tap, tap, 
tap, BLAM!!!, tap, tap, tap...  ;-)

Be careful putting the new bearings in.  Often a large socket will do 
as a "press."  I would not pound on the inner race, only the outer one.

When I pound on something like a socket, I use a copper mallet, not 
a hammer.

I used moly wheel bearing grease.

If you waste the hub, Parts Heaven in Hayward, CA has used hubs for 
$25 (don't ask; it wasn't from the wheel bearing R&R).

I think it took about 1-1.5 hours for the first wheel and about half
that for the rest.

Don't let the caliper dangle from its hose.  (I think that is relevent
advise, but can't remember for sure)
