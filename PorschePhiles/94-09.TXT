Subject: 944 Firewall Crack!

I just had a major crack repaired in the firewall of my '83 944.  It was in
the area where the clutch pedal shaft and the wiring harness go through the
firewall.  My mechanic and the Porsche dealer both said they had never seen
it happen before.

I think I can rule out stress from an accident.  The worst accident I've ever
had in the car was when someone backed into my bumper in a parking lot.  I
had to get it fixed because the crack caused movement of the firewall that
was affecting clutch operation at the master cylinder.

The crack was welded on both sides of the firewall, and then a steel plate
was welded over the crack.  It took a lot of time to remove the wiring
harness, the master cylinder, the carpeting, and all of the other parts that
could be affected by the heat of the welding torch.  Now that area is
probably stronger than the rest of the car.

Anybody ever hear of this problem before?

The Gospel on 914 Roll Cages According to Stan

Roll cages are funny things.... A very long time ago, when I first 
started riding motorcycles, a close friend who had about 250k miles
on two wheels (including an enviable Dallas-Miami-NYC-Juneau-LA-Dallas
jaunt one summer) told me: "Don't get leathers; get rip-stop nylon outerwear.
If you wear leather, you eventually start thinking you're bulletproof and
you'll do something stupid." Same can hold true for cages.

If you think there's any chance you'll actually need a cage, i.e. if you 
are road racing and have to worry about other people potentially, ummm, 
"impacting" your fun on the track, then you want one that's very strong 
and very well installed.  If you *DON'T* do things where you really, really 
need one, don't get it.  It will make you stupid, because now you're "safe".

So, now that you've decided you need a cage, which one?? There are several,
Autopower being a good choice. There is also a whole pile of "new guys"
out there, like Racetec (nice 911 cage, nothing for the 914 yet). See
the ads in the back of SportsCar (the SCCA equivalent of Pano), Pano,
and Excellence. Most of these cost about $600 for the cage and hardware,
and up to another $450 to install. Or, you can have a local race fab shop 
bend you up a custom job for varying prices. A high-end SCCA  or IMSA 
shop can charge your close to $2k for a cage, or the local roundie-round
guy can do miricles for $300 (I use this ex-NASCAR fabricator that does
simply unbelievable work, but he's gotta think you're one of "the guys"). 
Depends in part on where you live, depending in part on luck, you might
be better off with a custom job rather than a pre-fab mail order piece.

Then we get to "what kind of cage", an issue that often comes down to rules. 
In "showroom stock" racing, bolt in cages are the rule.  In fact,  they are
*EXACTLY* the rule. In SCCA "Improved Touring", you can use either a
bolt in or weld in cage of not more than 6 contact points with the body.
In Production, you can have the cage more tightly integrated with the 
body, and in GT, it's presumed that you're running a tube frame car anyway...
For PCA Club Racing, I dunno -- I do not have those rules in my head, since 
there haven't been any opportunities for me to do that.  However, I'd guess
similar rules apply.

Bottom line is this: the more tightly integrated a cage is with the rest of
the body, the stronger and stiffer it makes the car, and the safer you are
if you get hit or hit something. The less well integrated a cage is, the
more risk you have of it coming loose and doing nothing effective to help
you in an impact.

One other consideration: cage height. Make sure that the top of the main 
hoop is about 3" over the top of your head, with you wearing a helmet and 
sitting in the seat, strapped down. If there isn't this much clearance,
the side impact bars might help, but you're in trouble if you roll. Not
to mention you won't pass tech for SCCA road racing. If you don't have 
the clearance, you need a different car, a different body, or both.

Anyway, all Porsches have construction about like this:

			    door sill
			   /
			--------+
				|
				|<-- inner rocker
				|
				|	      floor
		 	 /	|            /
			/	|__________________
		(outer rocker completes triangle)

Now, if you look at this carefully, you'll see that the combination of the
inner and outer rockers and the door sill form a box section. This is where
a good portion of the strength of the car comes from. You'll note that
there is no such triangulated support for the floor.

Here's where the fun starts: it's very, very easy to install a cage
that bolts to the floor. It's very hard to install one that bolts to the
door sill. 

There are cases on record of cages that have installed correctly per 
manufacturer's instructions to the floor of the car, and then when the car
flipped, just punched those four corner poles through the floor sheet
metal like a straw through a potato. I have a friend that is no longer able
to walk because of that happening. He's lucky to still be breathing.

The 914 is a special case since the door sill extends a long way past the 
edge of the door. So it's very easy to install a cage on the door sill. 
And, with the outer rockers being removable, you can take them off and
weld in backing plates and triangulation to make it be a whole pile safer.
Problem being, the Autopower cage is designed so that if you do that (i.e
install it on the sill), the top of the cage protrudes about 3" 
beyond the top  of the car, so you can't put the roof on. But the legs are
clearly bent for it to be installed "right". 

What do you do??? Well, I've done two things: for friends that wanted it,
I have cut the legs of the Autopower cage down to make the main hoop fit
inside the car with the top on. Then re-weld the "foot" back onto the tube,
and install. I *HIGHLY* recommend welding a backing plate under the
door sill to provide some additional backing, and another triangulation
piece between the sill and the inner rocker. You can do this so that you have 
a removable bolt-in cage if you like. Or you can weld it down. Your
call, but check the rules first! (example: until a couple of years ago,
welded cages were not IT legal, and you got bumped up to Producation...)

For my IT 914, I took a Portapower and bent the legs so that they *just* fit
inside the inner rockers. Then I welded the "foot" to the floor, the tube
to the inner rocker and welded some backing plates to the floor and
triangulation to the door sill and inner rocker. And I'm still not completely
comfortable with it...

The EP 914 is a full custom job. And we don't even want to talk about the
GT-3 full tube frame car I built a couple of years ago...

Subject: Importing a Porsche from USA to Europe

Pierre Fournet-fayard asks several questions about US Porsche 928's around model
year 1985.  I've supplied some answers below about my own car, a US '86 928S,
which is identical to an '85 except for the front brake rotor size and caliper.

>>>What is a `normal' price for a 928S '85 with less that 90 kmiles in a good
condition?

My July-Sept. 1994 NADA Used Car Guide (Retail Consumer Edition) lists the
following retail prices for a 1985 928:

Low:$13,325
Average: $15,400
HIgh: $18,325

These prices are consistent with what I see in the newspaper want-ads in
Southern California.

>>>I read that dispite the fact that 928S are 300-310 hp in Europe, they were
less powerfull for the US versions ?

the '85 and '86 US 928 has a 4-valve engine rated at 288 SAE horsepower,
according to the Porsche Technical Specifcations.  However, in the same book the
"European" (80/1269/EWG) horsepower rating for the US car is listed as 292 @
5750 RPM, as compared to 310 @ 5900 for the European car.  The US engine
displaces  4898 cc and requires 91-octane (RON) unleaded, as opposed to 4632 cc
and 98-octane premium for the European car.

>>Are US 928S mostly with manual gear box ?

No.  I don't have exact figures, but believe that about 70-80% of 928's of this
era have automatic transmissions.

>>>How many speed for the automatic gear box ? Reliable ones ?

Four speeds, and it has the reputation of being quite reliable.

>>>If the seat-belts are fastened on the door, they must be changed.

I'm not quite clear what you mean, but my car has three-point seat-belts
(seat/shoulder belts) that are unattached to the door in any way.

>>>Headlights too (front and rear).

My headlights are H-4 halogen, but I don't know if they are original.  I think
the tail-lights are the same in all countries, but I could be wrong.  The 928s
I've seen in England certainly look the same as mine.

>>>you don't need to change your windows and your wind screen if there
a simple mark on it: the letter `E' followed by a number.....
Do US 928s have those marks ?

All four of my side windows have a circle E1, and say "sekurit".  My windshield
and rear window, however do not have these markings.

>>>Do they also have external driving-mirrors than can rotate ? (manually, to
protect pedestrians)

Yes, both mirrors will pivot forward or rearward if pushed hard enough.

I hope this helps.  Please ask any other questions you may have.

Subject: Re:  911 front trim height

Brooks,

Be careful here. Adjusting the ride height of one corner will affect
the corner balance of the car. Corner balance is an important factor
in how you car handles.

Let's say your 911T weighs 2400 pounds with you in the drivers seat
and the weight ditribution should be 40% front, 60% rear. The ideal
corner balance would have 480 pounds on each of the front tires
and 720 pounds on each of the rear tires. This ideal is not practical
to reach, but is what you strive for.

Changing the ride height of a corner changes the weight on that
corner. This will affect side to side, front to rear, and diaganol
balance. This is one of those things best left to a pro.

These are very sensible questions.  Let me try to answer them.  In
a normally-aspirated engine (ie, not turbocharged or supercharged),
it is relatively unlikely that a modified chip will damage the engine.
However, a badly-done chip could run an engine too lean (ie, too large
an air/fuel ratio), which would elevate combustion chamber temperatures
and run the risk of detonation (knocking).  In fact, a great deal of
the power gains for normally-aspirated engines come from leaning out
the mixture, particularly where the factory chip is a little "fat"
(ie, a little extra fuel) at high RPM's to a) afford a margin of error
from knocking, and b) cool the combustion temperatures.

The risk with forced induction engines (eg, turbocharged) comes from
running significantly higher boost (and so combustion chamber pressure).
The factory chips also roll off the boost at higher RPM.  Some after-
market chips defeat this roll-off.

The emissions control should be OK, and you should not have problems
passing annual tests if they are performed like we do in the USA.  You
should also not have a problem running with a lambda sensor (oxygen
sensor) hooked up, or with the catalytic converter.

When you install a chip, be sure to:

 - take the negative cable off the battery,
 - unplug the ECU, and
 - wear an electro-static discharge (ESD) cuff when working with
   the chip and opened ECU.

Yes, I think you can feel 20 horsepower difference.  It will depend a
little bit on where in the RPM range that extra power lies.  But it is
a significant (10%) change in horsepower, and you should sense it.

You will not have to change the exhaust system.  However, we recently
dyno'ed a couple of 911 Carreras and found that replacing the factory
system with SSI heat exchangers and exhaust, in combination with a
chip, did enhance performance measurably.  In the case of the Andial
chip we tested on a C2 or RS America, we did not change the exhaust.

>So let me know about the ANDIAL's chip.
>
>    1. How much power up is it?

The power increase is whatever I wrote in my previous message.  I
don't have the number written down here at home.  The price was, as I
recall, considerably less than the Autothority chip.  However, Andial
has fluctuated a bit in their pricing and availability.  If you are
seriously interested in the chip, and are will to spend a few hundred
dollars on it, I can investigate its current availability and price.

I did not drive the car on the street, and cannot give you a "seat of
the pants" answer to how it feels.  The owners are very happy.

Naoki, I hope this helps, and I hope that I have explained things
clearly.  If I can answer any further questions, please let me know.

Subject: 911 engine removal

In order to get the engine out of the 911, I will need to get
the following tools:

1. THIN 15 mm end wrench for the locknut on the clutch cable,
2. set of hex-head ends (allen wrench type) that fit on a 3/8" ratchet
    for the axle shafts and the oil drain plugs. 
3. huge end wrench for the oil cooler hoses - 
     does anyone know the size of this?
     21 mm maybe? May pick up my mongahela crescent wrench from the mini
     storage warehouse and give that a try first.
4. possibly a bigger hydraulic floor jack. may rent it.

also am a bit uncertain about the jacking arrangement for engine
removal. Where should I put the jackstands? and how high does the
rear of the car have to be in order to be able to get the engine out?
i got the rear end of the car up in the air tonight by jacking on the 
front of the engine, and put jackstands just inboard of the rocker panel
jacking holes, but this was not satisfactory since these are apparently
the longitudinal balance points, and the car would tend to teeter 
if your only support were these two points. Is there some place a 
bit further back where I can put jackstands?

I'm not real wild about the standard practice of putting a piece of
2x4 in the cup of the floor jack before jacking on the engine.
For one, the piece of wood could split, or tilt.
The engine could very easily slip off this type of perch, whereas
if you just jack directly on the low point of the case, there is
kind of a protrusion on the case halves that sits down in the cup
of the jack and seems more stable. Maybe a piece of rubber in the
cup of the jack, thin enough so the ears of the pad stick up around
it, but thick enough to survive the weight of a car. Opinions?

thanks,

The problem with the 2.7's and head studs has to do with the mismatch of
metals which expanded at different rates under heat, resulting in pulled
studs.  The approved replacements, Divalar studs, have expansion
properties that are very close to those of the magnesium alloy case used.
The 2.7's ran hot for various reasons, including the *thermal reactors*
that were used in all 77's and 75-76 California cars.  This resulted in
cooked seals and related problems.  In 78 Porsche went to a 3.0 litre
aluminum alloy case along with a two-way catalytic converter and air
injection pump to meet emission requirements.  This solved the

the 90 additional pounds (and another 130lbs starting in 80).  These
engines are considered among Porsche's most durable.  Just ask Ted!  He's

In fairness to Porsche, the regulations of the mid 70s were not kind to

Subject: 911 Carrera chips

Folks,

In response to a few requests, here are the chassis dyno results 
from testing two Carreras with a few ECU chips.  Note that the tests
were done on a chassis dyno, which measures power at the rear wheels,
unlike an engine dyno.  The horsepower figures refect losses of between
18% and 30% from the engine to the rear wheels.

The first batch of results comes from testing an '86 911 Carrera.
It has a factory stock powertrain.  Jerry bought the car for himself
a few months ago and it's his street car.  The catalytic converter
is in place.  The only changes are a foam air filter and a factory
muffler which has been opened up a little.

       Factory   AutoThority  Velos (sp?)

  3K     73 hp       75         70
  4K     98         105         97
  5K    152         155        153
  6K    185*        180        178
6.3K    183*        180        182

The final two "factory" figures are probably a bit low because of
problems with tire slippage.  The tires were very hot and smoking
(which is one of the disadvantages of a chassis dyno).

The only appreciable gains here were at 4K with the AutoThority
chip.  Even there, 7 hp is not a lot.  The Velos chip did nothing
for the car.

Tests were also done on a second Carrera, this one an '87.  It
has SSI heat exchangers, a dual-outlet muffler, and a foam air
filter element.  I unfortunately forget to bring all the notes home
with me.  However, I have this one test result:

        Velos

  3K      84
  4K     125
  5K     158
  6K     182
6.3K     180

It was clear that the combination of the chip plus the SSI exchanger
netted a meaningful power gain at low RPMs, ie, the 3K to 4K range.
It was also clear that the set-up traded this off against drop-off
in the high RPM range.  (My apologies for not having all the numbers.
I will get them and post them.)  This is consistent with the owner's
experience driving the car.

Coincidentally, Al Collins of AuthThority called the shop after these
tests had been done, on another matter.  Jerry gave him the results,
and he had two things to say.

 1. Gee, did you check the mixture?  [Huh?  I thought that's what
    the ECU and chip were for!]

 2. Oh, say, you know that Velos chip, I did it way back then when
    I worked there.  [So how come it performed better on the second
    car than the latest AutoThority chip?]

Let me say that I am more and more surprised at how bad a job
some makers of aftermarket chips have done.  Jerry and I have only
tuned a small number of engines ourselves with programable engine
management systems.  I would expect our work to be a little rough in
comparison with people like AutoThority, who I expect to have the tools,
experience, and knowledge to do a first-rate job.  I've found quite
the opposite is true.  Jerry's invested in the right tools to do
this sort of thing, like an instant response, wide-range lambda meter.
A lot of these clowns are tuning cars with Sun exhaust gas analyzers,
if that.

Be *very* careful about who you buy stuff from.  And don't be fooled by
advertisements.  Betty Jo doesn't do technical due diligence on Pano's
advertisers, and European Car is happy to take anyone's money.  For
example, there is one fellow who has started advertising 300+ HP packages
for 944 Turbos in Panorama.  This genius' 951 is now at sitting
at the shop, waiting for Jerry to rebuild his grenaded engine.

Is this abrasion you mention in any way noticeable without taking the lines

When said lines do fail, do they do it catastrophically or is there some

Subject: Cracked Fuchs

Hey,

I have to ask a question that I already know the answer to.
While flushing my old brake fluid out today, I noticed that
one of my Fuchs wheels has a crack in it.  The crack starts in
the corner of one of the triangular cutouts and proceeds for
about 1.75 inches up and towards the middle of one of the
spokes.  Yes, it goes all the way through.  I suspect that for
daily driving, the thing will probably be OK, but I also am 
planning to attend a driver's ed event in October and don't
want to chance that.

Now, I've always wanted to put 15x7s in the rear (15x6s now).
This may be the time to do it.  Does anyone have any lying
around?  It seems about the best price I've seen in Pano, et al,
is about $250 each.  Any leads on a cheaper price?  Cosmetics
is not real important - my front 15x6s aren't perfect.

Any help, comments or concerns would be appreciated!!

Stan, who is well in to the mid 6 digits in his German metal investment and

Stan also has 20+ years of racing experience, at a variety of levels,
under a variety of sanctioning bodies, and in a variety of formats. He
finds nothing sadder than people spending money on things that accomplish
nothing when there are so many more worthwhile things to spend money on.

First of all, thanks to the many people who answered my questions on

settled on Lodi Chrome in Lodi CA.  I decided to go with Lodi because the 
owner was courteous and patient with my questions and actually knew about 
the parts that I was describing to him over the phone.  Furthermore, he has 
the expertise to repair parts and fill corrosion/pitting, and has been in 
the business for 19 years, specializing only in auto restorations.  Rough 
prices quoted over the phone were about par with other quality shops, 
however I have'nt gotten a final quote yet.  They also have a pick-up 
service (the owner's father) who drives to the Bay Area once every two 
weeks which will make delivery convenient.

Well, I won't see any shiny new chrome until around the 20th of September, 
but I'll keep everyone posted with the results!

Although the commonly used VW gasket kits come with a paper gasket, it is
not necessary for a 356. A rubber O-ring does all the sealing that's
required.

If you have the axle tubes off, you might as well use the original types.
You will need a hydraulic press to remove a lock pin and then press off
the rear bearing flange to get this boot on. Otherwise, the split boot
does a good job, and is a lot easier to put on if the axles and tubes
are still on the trans.

If you had a ride height or left-right balance problem with the car, now
would be the time to align (in accordance with factory specs) or replace
your torsion bars.

I think (don't quote me on this) that the VW wheel cylinders do not have
enough offset to align with the wider 356 shoes. Also, the part number is
a Porsche number.

Trondmeister,

I don't know about any gasket between the backing plate and the axle tube.  
I'll look in my 356 parts fiche when I get a chance.

I am doing a full ground up resto on my 64, and decided to use the original 
non-split type boots for the axles.  I also used the "Sardine can" type 
hose clamps at each end of the boot for authentic looks.  I think this is 
the best idea for two reasons:  that was how the car came delivered AND its 
going to be harder for the boot to develop an oil leak since its not split!
I think the only reason to go for the split boots is when you're doing a 
routine maintenance and therefore don't have the backing plates off.

Greetings from Kansas........ 

Things have changed since I last posted that I would forward the postings
of the SCCA Solo II championship in Salina, Kansas.  I am actually here
and will be able to report live after each days events.  No am not driving
this year, and yes it is tough being and not driving, but I am being kept
busy crewing for for one of the top drivers in the country. 

Results from Saturdays first two rounds of the Pro Solo championship are
as follows: 

	Class SP1(street prepared 1)
		Dwight Mitchell .......1st, Porsche 911 2.7
		Scott Jessen ..........2nd, Porsche 911 3.2
		Rex Carle .............3rd, Porsche 911 3.2

	Class S3(stock 3)
 		Steve Compton .........2nd, Porsche 914 2.0
		R.L. Mitchell .........7th, Porsche 924S

	Class P1(prepared 1)
		Andy York .............2nd, Porsche 914 ??? 
 
	Class Ladies
		Sally Brown ...........3rd, Porsche 911 3.2
		Polly Mitchell ........17th, Porsche 924	
		Lisa Carle ............???, Porsch e 911 3.2
 
The ladies are all put into one class and are sorted by how their times
compare to the top time in the appropriate mens class. 
  
Other Porsche drivers driving cars other than their Porsche: 

	Class SP4(street prepared 4)
		Ken Mitchell ..........1st, Camaro 1LE
		Teresa Lommatzsch .....4th, Camaro 1LE
 
	Class S1(stock 1)
		Jeff Reitmeir .........4th, Mazda RX7-TT
	
	Class S5(stock 5)
		Stacy Reitmeir ........5th, BMW 318is

Yes, both Teresa and Stacy are running in the mens classes.  For those not
familiar with the Pro Solo series, it is like a one lap autocross, but
they use a drap strip type light to start the cars.  If you leave the line
before the green it is a DNF.  If you leave after the green light you will
loose time because the clock starts when the light turns green. 
Therefore, the trick is to leave at the same time the light turns green. 
Not as easy as it sounds.  Will post the Sunday final results after
competition is finished Sunday about 5PM. 

The regular autopcross championship starts Tuesday afetr a day off on
Monday.  Will be able to post direct results from Tuesdy through Thursday
as their results will be available on disk.  The Pro SOlo computer doesn't
have the same option.

I take the point that documents proving the Existence of Ted could easily be
forged.  However, think about it: would *ANYONE ELSE* of sound mind and body
be willing to present himself before the critical mass of Porschephiles and
ADMIT to being Ted unless he actually were the guilty party?  Think about it.
I believe such an admission would be almost proof certain of its verity.

What is the proper value for the resistor fitted in-line with the head

What does it look like - is it just 'dangling in the wind' or is it within
one of those box-shaped connector thingees?

Subject: Re: Cleaning Old Wheel Weights off Wheels?

I don't know how to get them off except that when you put them back on, 
request that the balancer put weights only on the inside. I asked about 
this at one of the tire seminars at Parade this year, and the concensus 
was that almost all wheels/tires could be balanced without the uglyness 
showing. If you look at the wheel in section, it's apparent that most of 
the wheel is inside the "spoke" area, so this should be logical.

Subject: SCCA Pro Solo Championship

Hi -
 
Sunday brought rain in the afternoon during the Pro Solo Challenge for
both the women and the men.  But more of that in a minute.  Final class
standings shaped up like this: 
 
	Ladies Class: Sally Brown 911 ...................2nd
	              Lisa Carle 911 ....................15th		
		      Polly Mitchell 924S ...............16th

	Stock 3 Class: Steve Compton 914 ................1st
		       R.L. Mitchell 924S................7th

	Street Prepared 1 Class: Dwight Mitchell 911 ....1st
				 Scott Jessen 911 .......2nd
				 Rex Carle 911 ..........4th

Other Porsche club members driving "other" cars: 

	Stock 1 Class: Jeff Reitmeir Mazda RX-7T ........4th

	Stock 5 Class: Stacy Reitmeir BMW 318i ..........9th

	Street Prepared 4 Class: Ken Mitchell Camaro 1LE.......1st
				 Teresa Lommatzsch Camaro 1LE..6th

The final round called the Challenge, is a run-off between the class
winners and others that finished the closest to their respective class top
times to make a field of 32 drivers for the men and 16 for the women. 
Then based on times compared to the class winners, you are paired down and
enter a single elimination competition.  Of course their are stagger times
built into the start clocks to even things out. 

Just before these rounds began the rain that had threatened all weekend
started and last through the womens round and into the final few runs of
the mens round. 

All three Porsche female drivers made it into the womens challenge only to
be taken out in the first round. 
 
Scott Jessen, Dwight Mitchell, Rex Carle and Steve Compton made it into
the mens finale.  Rex and Scott fell in the first round and Dwight made it
into the second before he was eliminated.  Steve compton got down to the
final eigth before he was eliminated.  After this only one rear wheel
drive car remained, showing that in the rain front wheel drive is a big
advantage.  The rain then slowed and finally stopped just before the final
four cars ran (all Front wheel drive stock cars).  Modified cars don't do
well in the rain and the Pro Solo series favors stock cars as well.  Final
victory and yearend championship weent to Danny Shields (non porsche
driver/member driving a Mazda Mx-6 (Ford Probe?)

Subject: CIS fuel distributors

Could someone decode the various 911 CIS fuel distributors I have available
to me?  I am aware of Stan's warning that the only good fuel distributor is
one that has always had fuel in it (ie taken from a running engine) or that
has never had fuel in it (ie sealed new or rebuilt).  Beyond that I'd like
to know the derivations of the three I have Bosch codes for, which are:
0438 100 006
0438 100 010
0438 100 031

If someone could tell me what they were original on, whether any of the three
is the "Eurospec" one, and whether any of them can be used on any other engine,
I'd appreciate it.  The specific engine I'm trying to get running is a 77
911S, stock everything except 73 heater boxes and no airpump.

Thanks as always,
 B.

Subject: S.Winders' corner balancing

Scott Winders <winders@porsche.support.apple.com> Gave a basically good 
note about adjusting one corner of ride height, but missed a fundamental
point (many "race" shops also miss this one, so don't feel bad) ;(

He said that if the weight distribution is 40% front, and 60% rear,
that both front corners should be equal and total 40% of the weight.

This is half right : the fronts should total 40% of the weight, but should
not be equal. You have to also consider the left/right weight balance.
The left side of the car is normally heavier due to pedals, instruments,
steering, and other driver side stuff (opposite side for you Limeys etc).

So, you also have to consider that if the left side total is 52%, then the
left front is 52% of 40% of the total, and the right front is 48% of 40%. 
While this is not enough to lose sleep over, you might as well do it
right, as it can be off about 20 lbs per side in this example.

It was $260 +/-, piece o' cake to install, but it did take a little work
trimming and cleaning up the finish.  As I recall, the top portion where it
meets the area under the window was too think, and it rubbed on the paint.
Also, there are no provisons for a latch or license plate lights(although)
your won't need those with a '74/later) so I had to improvise.

Subject: Re:  S.Winders' corner balancing

Mike,

A correctly corner balanced car *will* be equal left to right!!

Just because you have extra hardware on one side of the car does
not mean the car should be balanced with more weight on that side.
If what you say is true, why would you corner balance a car with
the driver's weight in the driver's seat?????

For a car to react ideally, the weight must be equal side to side,
within certain tolerances.  Fred Puhn says this, my chassis guy
says this (he is quite good and knows more about this stuff than
I ever hope to!).

Please explain to me, in as technical terms as you like, why you
disagree...

> On what basis are SS braided lines replaced on race cars? Age? Miles? Time

On our cars, it varies. The "low end" club racing stuff gets replaced
once a season. The "high end" club racing stuff gets replaced once every
other weekend. The IMSA stuff, back when I was doing that, got replaced
every weekend, along with *everything* except the calipers and master
cylinders...

On a related note, I've decided that this is my last year to use 
braided lines on the club racing cars. I've had a couple of failures
due to interior rubbing (teflon hose against steel braid) that were
not possible to spot until it was too late; I've had some bad fabrication
on some of the lines I bought; and I had a chance to weigh both lines
side by side.... Bottom line, I'm going back to factory lines on all 
the cars based on production tubs.

Hmmmm. So, I sez, where *ARE* the subscribers??? A few seconds with
my buddy awk, and I now know that for the 50% of you that have been
part of the Who's Who, I have the following distribution for the
states which hit double-digits (full distribution at end of message):

  10 ??
  10 MI
  10 OR
  12 PA
  13 CDN
  14 NY
  16 CO
  16 IL
  18 TX
  22 NJ
  28 WA
  33 MA
  96 CA

So, it's the usual bi-coastal distribution. A pile of people in the
northeast, and a pile of people on the left coast. And, as noted, 
at least 10 in the state of confusion. (Ted? you in there Ted? 8{) )

And let's see what else there is going on... Hmmm. Parade is in the
Seattle area next year, in July again. So *maybe* a pre-Parade
gathering somewhere "on the way" might be good? Somewhere between
Texas and Seattle would be nice, since that's the drive path for me...

I'm also likely to be at Parade, War Bonnet, and one of the 356 Registry
Holidays in 1995. I'm also very likely to be at InterOp (not Atlanta,
sorry), Winter USENIX, and other similar things. And, since this
is a good cause, if we can work it out, I'll make a special trip for
this...

Subject: Porsche Option Codes


	I have compiled the following list of Porsche option codes from the
'88/'89 spec book (*many* thanks to Kevin Gross for posting the information
across the Atlantic to me) and Bruce Anderson's 911 textbook.

	Please let me know of any additions/amendments. Where codes have
been used twice, it should trivially obvious by inspection :-) which
applies to any particular car. Porsche have a table which show which
models (911, 944, 928 ...)  and countries (USA, RoW, Japan ...) each
applies to, but I didn't think that the time spent typing this in would be
worthwhile!

	BTW, if anyone know what Option 330 is, I'd love to know!

Because it's against the laws of physics. Imagine the exaggerated case
of a car with 2/3 of its weight on the left wheels and 1/3 on its right
wheels. No amount of height adjustment is going to balance that car
left to right.

Subject: Termination of Trials and Tribulations !


	My hunt for a 911 has finally ended!!

	I have agreed to buy a 1988 registered (but '89 MY, with the wider
wheels and factory alarm) 3.2 Carrera Sport coupe in Baltic Blue with
28,000 miles for 23,000 pounds from a Porsche dealer. The car is absolutely
immaculate, and talking to the shop which serviced it (I know them and
trust their judgement) they told me that the previous owner was so
fanatical that whenever they were collecting the car to work on it, he
would wrap the steering wheel in cling film!!

	I should get the car later in the week, so watch this space for
lots of 911 neebie questions - if I can find a gap in porschephiles
between the Ted bashing messages :-)

Scott,

Think you've been hanging out with Ted too long...   ;)

>A correctly corner balanced car *will* be equal left to right!!

>not mean the car should be balanced with more weight on that side.
>If what you say is true, why would you corner balance a car with

This is EXACTLY why the drivers weight should be in the drivers seat!
It is needed to get the left/right side percentage correct.

>For a car to react ideally, the weight must be equal side to side,
>within certain tolerances.  Fred Puhn says this, my chassis guy
>says this (he is quite good and knows more about this stuff than
>I ever hope to!).

Please re-read the Puhn book, page 69. Who is your chassis guy? I'd like
to know so that nobody goes to him by mistake in the future.
Actually, I bet he does it correct but you didn't exactly understand
how he did it (he may have not explained it correctly).

> Please explain to me, in as technical terms as you like, why you
> disagree...

The Puhn book (How to make your car handle) says "the left and right sides of
the car may not have equal weights, because the CG may be offset to the side.
It is only the front-to-rear RATIOS that should be identical" (copyright Fred
Puhn)
You say that both front tires should be 480 pounds, but this is only correct
if the
left side of the car weighs the same as the right. Notice that Fred has
different
formulas for the right front and left front, which take the side-to-side
weight into effect.
You have no such difference and use the same weight left and right. To quote
Puhn
again "if the front end of the car carries 40% of the total car weight, then
the left front
tire should carry 40% of the LEFT-SIDE weight." (Sorry Fred, please don't sue
me).
Bruce's book (page 174, top right) says exactly the same thing.

I hope there are no more doubts about this. Please read (and understand) the
Puhn book. If anyone wants, I can do an example (with my actual car) of how
to do the weight balancing correctly. Also note what I said yesterday, this
is
not something to lose sleep over as it is only 20 pounds or so on most cars.
But if you are going to do it, DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

Subject: How to remove inner door panel w/out trashing it

The outside door latch on my '87 951 no longer works (I can lock/unlock
from the outside key, but I have to use the inside latch to open the
door). After reviewing Haynes, it looks like I have no choice but to
remove the interior door trim panel to get at the latch mechanism.  When
I've done this on my previous (lesser) cars, I've always managed to
bungle the job and either break some retaining clips or bend the trim
panel so that it doesn't fit quite right upon reinstallation.  I really
don't want to do that on my p-car.

Can anyone offer advice as to how best to approach this, or is it just a
matter of "be really careful"?

Thanks,

Hi.

Anybody had any experience of the K&N filters on 911s (especially Turbos)? 

Since I just oiled my paper one (over filled the oil) and am about to replace
it is it sensible to fit the K&N rather than the standard paper one
(at 2.5* the price)

I'm not all that electrically inclined, so bear with me if this is a stupid

I'd also like some tire advice. I don't race this car, but use it for
summertime commuting (I live in the snow belt), and pleasure driving at

Subject: Helmets (cont.)


Well, the overwhelming sentiment of the list is that the SA85 will be 
good for the rest of this year, but, in many circumstances insufficient 
for next year when the SA95's appear.

My (admittedly skeptical) question is . . . from a safety standpoint, are 
there dramatic differences between a helmet meeting SA85 standards and 
SA90 standards?  What would they be?  And wouldn't I be better off 
waiting and getting an SA95 which, it appears would have a useful life of 
10 years instead of an SA90 with only 5 years maximum left?

I am a bit skeptical (out of my admitted complete ignorance of the helmet 
manufacturing field) of this industry imposed obsolence (as I am of ANY 
industry that creates its own means of regenerating business on a 
periodic basis).  Obviously, I want to protect the grey matter as much as 
possible, so please explain what the advanatges are to these later SA's 
which make them that much more imperative.

Hi Kevin,

I recently installed a K&N on my 84 930. Truthfully I can't really tell a 
difference between that and the stock paper filter. One benefit to using 
the K&N is that it's reusable so in the long run it doesn't cost that 
much more than paper. I have, however, often wondered if it was as 
effective as the paper filter in removing small particles from the intake 
air. But I've used K&N's on almost every performance vehicle I've ever 
owned and never had a problem.

Subject: Re: How to remove inner door panel

Steve,

First, really be careful!   :-)

Then, start by removing the door lock post by the window.  It should come off
by unscrewing.

Next, remove the speaker panel (assuming you do not have the special
speakers).  It is held in place by 4 phillips head screws.  Remove the
speaker.

Next, remove the lower door pocket.  It is held in place by 3 or 4 phillips
head screws, along the lower edge and outside of the pocket.  The upper part
is held in place by a couple of locating pins.

Next, the door armrest is held in place by a couple of large phillips head
bolts along the bottom of the armrest.  Note that removing the bolts will
not allow you to remove the armrest completely, but will allow it to swivel
from the upper part of the rest (the handhold top).  Don't try to do any
more than this at this point.

There may be a couple more screws at the outer edge of the door. Remove
them.  At this point, what is holding the door panel in place are some of
those plastic retainers that are pressed into holes in the door shell.  You
may use a large flat blade screwdriver to locate those retainers and gently
pry them away from the door shell.  When you have released all 8 to 10 of
them, the door panel may be lifted up and away from the shell, taking the
armrest with it.  At this point you can see the back of the panel, and the
hook that holds the upper part of the armrest in place.

Remove the cable connectors to the door switch and the mirror switch and you
can now see ther inside of the door.

Seems like a lot of words, but it really is pretty easy.  I haven't damaged
even one in removing many, many of them...

Subject: Re: Rolling your lips

To whomever originally requested this info,

In regards to the rolling technique for 911 rear wheel wells......
Use the handle end of an oak baseball bat.  Starting at either end, roll the
bat up between the tire and the inner wheel well.  Somewhere around a 45
degree angle to the ground is a good angle.  This will compress the  1/4"
inner lip up against the inner fender giving you the little extra edge needed
for oversized tires or wheels.  If done slowly and carefully, you should not
even crack the paint. Pushing the bat further in to a thicker diameter, would
of course roll it more. Additional details if needed.  Hope this will help.

I've been hearing about this braided brake line business for awhile and it's
time to add my two cents.
 I've been involved with PCA track events and Club Racing since 1986. I've
also served as tech chairman for my region so I've been underneath hundreds
of cars. During that time I've seen 3 or 4 cases of catastrophic brake
failure, everyone of which has involved braided brake lines.
I've traced some soft pedals due to rubber hoses but never complete failure.
I've also seen some accidents waiting to happen due to lousy installations of
aftermarket braided lines.
Conclusion- unless you are a really serious racer and do the kind of
maintanance that serious race cars require you are far better off with fresh
rubber lines.

Braided lines do give better feel than rubber, and that's why most
racers use them. But the rubber ones tend to age better, and
for a street car may be a better choice. Perhaps because the 
steel ones are stiffer, they seem to be more prone to cracking after
a few years. But if you inspect them often, they are fine.

Bruce Andersone talks about this in his book.

All other issues aside, you will run into difficulty because of the
lack of available metric-sized fittings for Aeroquip-style hose.  I've
located 12, 14, and 16 mm adaptors to AN sizes.  However, we use them
only when absolutely necessary in part because of cost but more
importantly because they at least double the number of things which
can go wrong.

If it works for you aesthetically, you can buy slip-over steel braid
sleeving.  I think it looks tacky and hides problems.  There is also
abrasion to be considered.

There are two height-adjustment screws in the gutter at the back of the

are also such adjustments at the front.

If the seal around the edge of the removeable sunroof is chewed up, it may

Something heavy which will not melt out of there in a hurry.  Not really

Also inspect the ball and socket for excessive wear.  I've seen a bunch

Contrary to what Martin wrote, no, absolutely not.  To avoid risk of
net-gainsay, cf. Carroll Smith who states that nylocks are indefinitely
reusable, as long as you don't yutz them up.

The "interference fit" all-metal rounded locknuts which Porsche loves
are not particularly reusable.  For example, the M14 nuts at the top
of shocks are good for two or three uses.  You can tell when they've
gone off because they thread right on with your fingers.  At that
point, you can certainly re-use them if torqued OK; they just aren't
and different from plain nuts.

>Do I need to use adhesive on the gaskets when replacing?
>If so, whats the best tool to remove the old gaskets?

No adhesive or sealant on the valve cover gaskets.  As Martin says,
clean the surfaces with a razor blade, held perpendicular to the
surface.

Four mm. spacer washers were required with the older .05 mount.  The

Check out Jim Pasha's excellent article on timing belts and water pumps in
issue #47 of Excellence, which I think is the current issue.  I agree with
his recommendation of a 30K replacement interval.

BTW, Jim missed a few tech items specific to the 16-valve cars.  One in
particular had to do with the right belt for a 944S.  It takes the same
.02 belt as a 944S2 and 968, and the upgrade is *HIGHLY* recommended (by
Porsche) to anyone still driving around with an .00 belt.

>Is there any way to reduce the frequency in which the belt will have to be

Not really.  I think it is worth doing at 15K miles, max, in addition to
the initial 2K retension.  This service is also a good opportunity for
your mechanic to check for cam and balance shaft radial seal leaks, and
for water pump condition.

Subject: 911 engine removal

We got the motor out of my 71 911 over the weekend. We used portable
ramps (24 cm high) to get the rear end in the air. I removed everything
possible from the top of the engine (alternator/fan, fuel injection,
intake stacks). Also removed the rear bumper and license plate panel.
There was plenty of clearance. 

We used a small floor jack, min height 12.5 cm, max height 39.5 cm,
(2 ton/ 4400 lbs). This was a mistake.

The jack didn't go quite high enough, so we used a thick wood block.
As we were trying to lower and roll the engine out the back, it started
to slide off the block. Fortunately we able to control it and get it
out from underneath the car without further incident.

There were four of us at the moment of truth - one manning
the floor jack under the engine, pulling straight back. There was
one person on each of the rear corners of the engine, grabbing onto
the exhaust system to stabilize and keep the engine from falling
off the jack, and one other person who was initially posted with a
second jack under the transaxle in case the engine tried to slip off the
front of the other jack- this turned out to be unnecessary, but it
was nice having an extra person to unhook the oil line I forgot :-)

OK, I know I'll get flamed for using four people to do a one-man job,
but having lots of nearby helpers is one of the few advantages of
apartment living when it comes to working on your car, so I'm not going
to forsake it :-)

It reminded me of scenes in third-world countries.  Once I saw some guys
in Ecuador use a tree trunk with a chain around it to pull a motor on a
busy street downtown.  I suppose you could do a VW without a floor jack,
but I sure wouldn't want to try a 911 without one!

Subject: WTB: 928 Phase II!

 
First of all, I hope everyone had a safe and happy Labor Day;
but now it's back to work, and I've got some serious no-cluebie
questions for the list.

I asked the question several weeks ago, that being if a 928
would be a good choice for a non-Porsche owner who's had his
fill of SCCA & stoplight racers with their requisite high
maintenance bills. The list.wisdom result was 8 for, 2 against
(including Stan), and 1 person who essentially told me I was
a poser-wanna-be. :-) Several of those who responded positively
indicated that they had had little, if any trouble in many
years of driving their 928(S,S4,GT,GTS,etc).

So now I'm on the trail of my next vehicle, which will be a
928 (sorry Stan!). Here's what a quick run through the 
classifieds this weekend brought out;

'84 928, auto, "clean", $8995
'84 928S, 51K miles, "Excellent condition", $11,700
'84 928S, "Immaculate condition, records", $13,500 OBO
'85 928, 32V, sunroof, "nice" $9,750
'88 928S4, auto, 43k miles, silver, wing $19,450
'89 928S4, auto, alloys, CD, "immaculate", $24,900
'89 928S4, 65k miles, sunroof, new tires & battery, $23,000
'89 928S4 GT, "very rare", 5spd, CD, C2 wheels, $28,000

There were more, but I'll stop there as the '91 and newer
are all $40k+ and I can't see paying $40k for something I
can't live in. At least not yet. :-)

Like anyone, if I'm about to make a mistake, I'd probably like
to make a $10k mistake over a $25k mistake, but if I can find
a decent car with good records, should the year and/or miles
really bother my search that much? My current price limit is
probably at about $25k. Of course, if I can do well for $15k,
I'd be predisposed torward that, since my parents had the bad
manners to not make me independently wealthy.

The questions as they stand;

When did Porsche fix the predominant electrical problems with
the 928? Would the 84/85 years be safe?

Do I want (excluding performance) the 32V engine of the S4
over the 16V engine of the older vehicles?

How is the paint holding up on 10 year old Porsches? Is it
entirely a matter of care? (i.e. different from car to car?)

Does anyone here locally (Dallas, Texas) know of a reliable
place for pre-purchase inspections? (local PCA number?)

Does anyone on the list know of comparably priced 928's being
sold by an individual/dealership they can vouch for? (Anywhere!)

I think that's the bulk of my questions right now. I truly
appreciate the assistance many of you have offered, and I look
forward to your replies as Phase II leads to Phase III!

Thanks again,

Scott,

>A correctly corner balanced car *will* be equal left to right!!

Pretty safe bet that you've never been real close to an alignment
machine, my friend.  There is simply no way you will get even left-
to-right weight distribution in a street 911, short of spending 
some quality time with a plasma cutter.

Just to clarify things, you are trying to achieve a consistent
ratio of front-to-rear weight on each side.  Doesn't matter whether
its 40% or 35% front-to-rear, doesn't matter (much) whether one side
is 100 lbs heavier than the other.

The reason for this is that by setting the car up this way, the
under/over steer character will not change as you turn left or
right.  Having, say, a 38/62 distribution means that, when you
turn left real hard and put all the car's weight on the right-side
tires, they will have that distribution, and vice versa.  Which
in turn means that the coil spring, sway bar, and torsion bar springing
effects will be the same both in left turns and right turns.  And
by effects we mean, class, over- and under-steer.

This matter has been discussed to death in the past.  Frank Kerfoot
posted wonderfully detailed explanations.  You might also check out
Puhn's "How to Make Your Car Handle Even If It's a 911 God Help You",

Try Objectiveness.

Braided lines are braided lines whether you use it in your Learjet, Chevy or 
Porsche. 
You cannot judge someones knowledge by looking at what combination of 
clothes they use. *That* is a matter of TASTE, and has nothing with 
knowledge to do.

I do not believe there are many around that deserves the title 'allround

What a ridiculous attack.  Ted, please stop wearing your seatbelt.  
And stop using your helmet too.  Since obviously you don't "expect" any 
mishaps, though with your history of curbing...!

Actually folks, Pete said a full face helmet would protect your face in 
the event of a seatbelt failure.  He didn't mention flying out of the car.
(But it'd help in that case too)

Thanks Ted, for telling us all how much you think your own face is worth.
What you really need, is an open EAR helmet, so you could HEAR your 
instructor crying in fear, or, if he/she's tough, cussin' and yelling.
Admittedly, open face IS easier to get on and off, easier to wear glasses 
with, and cooler and comfier.

The sorry truth is, Ted, your post would've been o.k., had you chosen NOT to 
attack Pete.

ted_mode_off

IMHO, buy the newest, most protective helmet you can reasonably afford 
and will satisfy your event organizers.  Unless, of course, you haven't 
got anything to protect.  If you can't get a good one now, make plans to 
get a good one as soon as possible.  My own helmet is a Simpson Super 
Bandit, (Full face, SA90). I like it alot, but if I could've afforded 
something in the next price range up, (not much out there) I would've 
gone for it. Try on a bunch of helmets to find your size, then mail order.

The VW guys have a competition.  They have two bugs, one with a engine
and one without.  I think this is how it goes.

The crew and all tools are put in the car with an engine.  The timer starts
and they drive the car 100', stop it.  Remove the engine and put it in
the other bug, load it up and drive it 100' where the timer stops.  I
vaguely remember reading about times in the 6 minute range.

Subject: '73 heat exchangers

Ted inquires whether the ->73 heat exchangers yield more power.  The literature
(Anderson and others) certainly says so.  I THINK so, but mine are currently
on a 2.2 liter carbureted engine in a Vanagon so I don't have evidence from 
a change in my autocross finishes.  The particular problem they definitely
solved for me was the exhaust note.  The stock Porsche muffler does not fit
the Vanagon bodywork, and the 74-> heat exchangers with a light "turbo" muf-
fler had a terrible motorcyclish blat note between 2500 and 3000 rpm.  The 
 ->73 pipe configuration solved that with no other changes.

The other evidence that the ->73 is better is that no one would put up with
what a pain they are to mount and dismount, relative to the 74-> boxes, if
they didn't help performance.

While we're on the subject, does anyone know the history of the particular
heater boxes I have: they are stainless, but they look like a stealth bomber --
all flat surfaces and angles, rather than curves like a conventional SSI
heater box.  I can't find any identifying marks, but the workmanship is much
better than would be expected of any homebrew.  Sound familiar to anyone?

Martin mentions the <6 minute times scored in VW beetle engine swaps.  Don't
let them use your bug in the competition as the best times use the floor jack
only for installation; for removal, they use a quick jerk off the mounting

Do they still make those exhaust-inflated bags for use as jacks?  Seems like
that could be a safe and gentle way to get the 911 drivetrain in and out.

I just replaced one fuel line on my 911 (the tank to engine line after
the flare fitting hidden by the tranny mount) with a flexible line.
I posted earlier about it, but I found basically two choices of line.
I forget the details, but one was three layers (a flouroelastomer, a
rubber sheath and a stainless braid), this was billed as "electronic
fuel injection hose" it had good gasoline resistance and was designed
with a working pressure of around 100psi and a burst pressure of 
a few hunder psi.  The other hose, the one I actually used, was two
layers, stainless braid over teflon, again good gasoline resistance but
had a working pressure and burst pressure in the thousands of pounds.
I chose this one because my hose guy recommended it, we use miles of
the stuff in some of our machines (literally miles).

I'd add the following advice - resist the temptation to make the line
"just a little bit longer just in case".  These hoses have a min bend
radius or around three inches so it's a bitch to get rid of that extra
length.  Also, there are available 90, 45 and 30 swivel fittings which
don't compromise the integrity of the host - take advantage of these
if you can. 

Soryy I can't give you price info as I got my hose gratis, but if you
a really interested let me know and I'll give you the Weatherhead part #.

Turn the radio off.  Give the SO/passenger something to read, or headphones,

blow-outs, animals, Bozos (especially bozos) and you name it.  (On M/C, 
such Hazzard-awareness also includes the myriad things that can destroy
your equilibrium, such as chain-breakage; requiring a constant evaluation
of the terrain you pass thru searching for a soft-landing spot - believe it).  
With a little practice, one develops almost a 3-dimensional awareness, that

Subject: 944/951 balance belt question

Well, I completed the water pump and timing belt replacement on my
89-951.  I replaced the roller on the timing belt tensioner and the
idler just above the lower balance shaft.  I also replaced the
balance shaft seals.  The other rollers and the balance shaft belt were OK.
Car had 35K.

Question:
I read the factory shop manual for instructions on placing the idler
which is just above the lower balance shaft.  I used a 0.5 mm feeler
guage between the idler and the balance shaft sprocket and moved 
the idler as close as possible to the upper run of the balance
shaft belt.  There is about 3-5 mm between the idler and the
upper run of the balance belt.  It looks to me like there should
be 0-1 mm clearance if I am reading the manual correctly.  I cannot
get this small clearance and still maintain the 0.5 mm clearance
on the balance belt sprocket, even when rotating the idler in
every direction.  It is currently offset as far as possible to
the "northwest" direction and still maintain correct clearance
to the balance shaft sprocket.

It seems to me that the clearance between the idler and the sprocket
is the critical part of the setup (to keep the belt from jumping).
This belt is not real tight when set at spec.  I guess the belt will
jump around a bit on the upper run.  

Does this match your experience or do I have a problem with the
clearance above the idler?

In order to get the engine out of the 911, I will need to get
the following tools:

- ---->	1. THIN 15 mm end wrench for the locknut on the clutch cable,
Must depend on year.  I had none and just did it.

	2. set of hex-head ends (allen wrench type) that fit on a 3/8" ratchet
    	for the axle shafts and the oil drain plugs. 
You'll need a 17mm HEX, best bet is to buy a set of LARGE allens (got one for $8) and cut 1.5" off the end, hten pu tit in a socket.

You'll need a 6mm for the CVs if it's pre 86, or 8 (I think) if it's got the 930/86+ carrera setup.

You'll also need a large (10MM?) allen for the starter bolt.
3. huge end wrench for the oil cooler hoses - 

32 and 36mm.  I use the mondo size craftsman adj wrench and a 32mm I
picked up somewhere.

4. possibly a bigger hydraulic floor jack. may rent it.
he engine could very easily slip off this type of perch, whereas
..,.

On jacking the car - FOR CV Dismemberment
	1) put the front tires on 6" cinder blocks
	2) Put the jackl stands under the rear torsion tube stubs outboard of the spring plate.  Have a freind operate the brake. Remove tires. Also remove everything else then.  Get to the point where the motor/trans is on the ground.  

To remove the engine from under the car:
	Replace rear tires
	Remove rear valance
	PLace rear tires on double cinder-blocks
	withdraw motor.

Note:  I built a "saddle" for the front tires made by screwing two  8"
2x4s across a 2x8, this leaves a depression for the front tires to sit
in and keeps the car from moving while rear tires are in the air.

Does it make it much easier if the rear suspension is dangling?
I bet this is why it was so hard.
I had some weight on the rear tires and it was a real bitch getting

Let me see if I've got this straight:

The list is unanimous that OEM brake lines, whatever their shortcommings,
almost *never* fail catastrophically.

Several folks on this list have commented that, OTOH, braided steel brake 
lines *do* fail catastrophically (one wonders how a brake line failure 
could *possibly* be other than catastrophic, but never mind) on the odd 
occasion or two; and

Newton's first law of motion remains that a body in motion tends to remain 
in motion unless acted upon by an ourside force; and

There are some folks on the list who would argue that it's ok to use braided
steel lines on the *street*, since they use them and haven't experienced any 
catastrophic failure.  Yet.

OK.  I think that's about it.  For those who remain undecided about the use 
of braided steel brake on their street machines; here's a koan to aid you in

Our 914 2.0L 1973 has a fresh air fan which does not work. We have checked

The shop books talk about removing the gas tank to replace the fresh air fan.
I  wondered if this is really so. (It looks like it,but I wondered if anyone
has done this job, since there is a square metal piece on top of the tank,
and maybe , just maybe, the fan will fit between the hood and the gas tank with
that piece off.)

On a similar topic, we will be putting the heating system back together on
this car. It has heater boxes underneath, and the heater fan in the engine
compartment. But hoses are missing, plus (maybe) some parts. Neither the shop

which does? Anyone have a working 914 2.0L in Central NJ we can look at?

I am officially selling my 16" Fuchs.  These are Porsche Fuchs, not 
replicas, copies, cast, nor the Steel Rusty type that Pete Albrecht 
recommends.

2 6x16s I will offer at $225 each or $400 both, come with Dunlom 
205/55/16 tires installed, they are currently on my car, straight, exc. 
condition, never bent.

2 7x16s I will offer at $275 each or $500 both, come with Yokohama AVS 
195/50 tires, straight, never bent.

Buy all 4 (these are the wheels Porsche uses on the SC (options) and 
Carerras (stock) and take a whopping 15% off.  Prices do not include 
shipping or packaging, so prefer local Bay Area buyer.  

Will consider partial trade of 7x15" wheels, preferably BBS RA or RAII 
wheels, gold preferred, but any color is fine.

for that price. Anyway, here are some my questions/concerns:
 
1) Was the original electric or heat welded?    
2) How can I remove the broken remain on the chasis?
3) What current (AMP) size do I need to do the job if electric weld it.
4) Do I need to sand off the paint and clean the surface really well?
 
Anything that I should watchout for?

One tip I have:  It always seems like there's someone who wants to race

For that matter, if Ted is going to be there, I recall a roadside

Maybe someone already mentioned it, and I meant to mention this a week

Anyway, what I discovered is a hand sealer called "ProTek" by DuPont.
Think I found it in either a hardware or auto parts store. It's a white
cream in a tube that painters, mechanics, etc, use. You just rub a glob
of it onto your hands before you start. It dries clear in a few seconds
and you don't even notice it. When you're done, it rinses right off
with just water. I still use a little soap or GoJo to get the areas I 
missed, but it's really great for keeping the grease and grime from
imbedding under the fingernails and knuckles.

Dec 11  SCCA            HPA
Dec 18  PCA             Splashtown

These are the events that I know of.  Surely the BMW and Corvette clubs 
might also be holding races.   Registration and tech usually close by 
9:30a.m. at the SCCA and PCA events.  So be there by then!

The HPA (HOUSTON POLICE ACADEMY)is located right by Intercontinental Airport 
at the NW corner of Rankin Rd and Aldine-Westfield.  If you take Beltway 8 
towards the airport, get off on Aldine-Westfield and head N to Rankin.  If 
you take 45 to Rankin, go E to Aldine-Westfield.  Enter at the gate on the 
West side of the building.    Splashtown is the water park N on I45 by the 
Spring exit.

Subject: Handling adjustment Table (BFG)

Corky Cartwright (cork@cs.rice.edu) asked an interesting question about
Scott Winder's handling balance table from BFG.

- ------------------ cut ------------------------------------------------------
In particular, the adjustments in the two rows of the table looked like 
they are swapped:

Adjustments              To Decrease Understeer    To Decrease Oversteer
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Front Tire Pressure      Lower                     Higher
Rear Tire Pressure       Higher                    Lower

In the books I have read, understeer is associated with larger slip angles 
in front than in the rear.  The front tires are working harder and deform 
more.  Increasing pressure stiffens the tire and reduces deformation and 
slip angles.  Hence, increasing the pressure in the front tires will reduce 
understeer. My car (an '89 951S equipped with the small rear anti-sway bar) 
understeers when set up according to factory specifications. At the track,
I compensate by increasing the tire pressure in front.  More recently,
I have installed lower profile (45 instead of 50 series) tires 
on the front, which seems to to reduce slip angles.  But I haven't visited 
the track since I made the change.

Is Scott's table wrong or have I been hallucinating at the track?

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The table IS wrong based on the normal DOT street-legal and radial race tires
we have seen in the past. Your assumptions are correct, your car probably
understeers less with higher tire pressures in front. However... the new BFG
tires have such stiff sidewalls that they stick better at LOWER pressures,
due to a larger tire contact patch. Also, racing tires (bias-ply) tend to
grip better at lower pressures. But if the pressures are TOO low, the tire
still deforms and loses grip. This does not seem to occur with the new BFGs
until under 20 PSI ! 

Maybe BFG just made a typo and they are not thinking this hard? Any comments
FTPG? I would like to hear other theories about tire pressures.

except for Nitrous Oxide #8>).

If you take off your existing door panel, you can see if your door shell has
the round holes which will accomodate the larger speakers from the sound
system.

According to the microfiche for 85/2-88 944s, there is only one door shell
part number, which leads me to believe that you should have no problem.
(That is, if you have the original door on your car...)

You just don't stop, do you? A helmet rated as M90 is NOT as good as an
automobile grade helmet, SA90. They are designed for totally different
types of impact, and a helmet intended for motorcycle use will not protect
you in a typical automobile crash.

Nope. The Book doesn't lie. The tank has gotta come out. And that means
you also now have a *GREAT* opportunity to replace the fuel lines between
the tank and the body, and to clean out the strainer, and if you're really
feeling energetic, to send the tank to a radiator shop to be "tanked" and
then coat the inside with Wurth anti-rust goop... 

But I digeress. Once the tank is out, you have ready access to both the
fan assembly *AND* the control cables for the air regulators. So, go ahead
and pull the tank. Word of advice, wait until it's nearly empty first...

Ahhh.. let's see. The Tweeks catalog has a reasonably complete drawing of the

getting access to one that's right or having some help from someone that

Hi All,

I am thinking of putting a 245/45/16 (on 9X16 fuch wheel) on my 911/SC.
I recall some discussion regarding this subject sometime ago. 
Unfortunately, I don't remember if I could use the 930 9X16 or
I need to go with 951 9X16 offset?

On the subject of ride height, specifically, the front. On page 177 of Bruce
Anderson's book, he mention about removing that
BIG 10mm washer on top of the shock absorber and use it as
a paper weight. Do I need to replace this washer with something
thinner? If so, can I simply get one from local hardware store?

Thanks for your help.

Philes,

Thanks for the advice on removing the glue left by a stolen badge.  I used the 
"Goo Gone" product as it's 1/3 the price of the "3M General Purpose Adhesive 
Remover" and it did the job.

The latest item on my 951 that needs attention is a squeaky door.  The problem 
is lubrication of center pivot on the driver's door.  The pivot is what I'm 
calling the assembly that is between the top and bottom door hinge.  Last time I  
had my door panel off I lubricated this unit from the inside with silicone 
spray.  It solved the squeak for about a month, then the squeak returned.  I 
guess I should have used another type of lub.  What is the recommended lubricant 
for this part?

Adrian.

For a purely racing application, I can't *IMAGINE* using a box-stock long
block. I'd have that sucker down, new PolyDyne'd bearings, weigh and balance
everything twice, and then I'd pick the cam and decide whether to cut
pockets in the pistons I had, or more than likely, call up Arias or
TRW and have a set flanged up to my spec, or more than likely just
a dup of my last order.

For a purely I-think-I-wanna race application, you *STILL* can't do
it without measuring clearances between the valve and piston. Unless
someone just happens to have that info laying around... Kevin? Bruce?

And by the way -- use *NEW* valves in NEW correctly installed and honed
guides as it greatly minimizes the chance of such an impact...

I went there to help in my self education of this model. I am sure to going
to see some really nice cars just like the one I want (C or SC coupe),at
least that's what I thought!
One car was nicer than the next one.Wow! look at Denny Fricks' A sunroof
coupe, maybe that's the car for me. No,Ed Prinn's
light blue roadster is really the car  that I should consider.
No, wait, Dayle(wife) come look at John's blue D convertible.
It took me my first few hours to get the light headed feeling to disappear.
The entire weekend was a great opportunity to meet many  356ers, who would
drive for hundreds of miles in cars over 30 years old to share in this unique
love of the early Porsche.All of them, including wives, were a great bunch of
people. I thank them all for their friendship and much free advice on what I
should purchase.
I am still back to what model to purchase and which one?
I am sure about one thing, it's going to be a SC Cab, or a D conv, 
maybe roadster. I should just be pleased with a nice coupe.....unless, maybe
I should see about those second mortages that the banks advertise to help in

Hello James,

>1) Was the original electric or heat welded?
99.99% sure it was welded with a spot-welder. It was welded with the help of 
an electrical device. Heat was of course involved in this process too, but 
not oxy/acetylene.
  
>2) How can I remove the broken remain on the chasis?
Use either a good metal saw, a grinder with cutting disc or good quality 
metal snips. A plasma cutter would have been even better, but it costs. You 
will be happy if you sandblast the area before you start working on it.

>3) What current (AMP) size do I need to do the job if electric weld it.
Anything over 80AMP will be sufficient, I have 130AMP welder and have not 
had use for power settings 3 or 4 while restoring my 356. (mostly I weld 
with setting 1.)

>4) Do I need to sand off the paint and clean the surface really well?
Read above, sandblast the piece, or at least use a wire brush and the 
grinder. If you go for MIG/MAG welding you *must* have a clean workarea. 
With gas it is not *that* important, but it will be easier and result in a 
stronger weld. 

>Anything that I should watchout for?
If you use electric welding method, your chassi as one of the 'poles', 
assure that you disconnect the battery, you would perhaps also take out any 
computerised engine management system to ensure it will work even after the 
welding is done. (I'm not sure about that point, but it's only 2 bolts, and 
the cost of a new one might be more than 10 minutes of work??!!)

I will advise you to have the repair area sandblasted, not only does it make 
the rest of the work a joy, it also indicates whether you will have to do 
more places than you first believed. *That* is better to know *before* the 
new piece is welded!

cheers,
Trond

prices, we're maybe talking $200 for a 120AMP machine??!!)  ;)

I couldn't agree more. 'Staying awake' is the prime directive in fast and
efficient road trips. Imho daydreaming or drifting mentally is also the
proximate cause of most non-DWI accidents. Speed does NOT kill - on the
other hand sudden deceleration can be really nasty!

My SO has excellent vision and, when I take her along, she  is great for
detecting black and white 'incomings' before I can tell whether it is a car
or truck. I find fast driving an intense experience and like to spell off
after a couple hours and let her drive, (or just slow down when alone).

Here's my tip: Joys of the RH Lane

 -I have lost most of my high school trig but I think it is the Law of
Tangents that specifies that cars in the RH lane of a divided multilane
highway have a slower apparent speed (to approaching traffic police). This
works for radar and also for visual observation by the trooper. If the
median is more than 100 feet or 5 car lengths wide there is no way an
oncoming rolling radar unit can get an accurate reading.

 -Also running in the RH lane it is often possible for long periods to keep
a fairly wide arc of 'radar shadow' between you and the oncoming traffic
while running behind or beside other cars, trucks and Winnebagos.

 -Traffic that insists on staying in the LH lane used to annoy me, now I
make use of it. The only downside is that there are long stretches where
the deterioration of our InterStates has progressed much further in the RH
lane from all the truck traffic.

 -Also if you have to pull out and pass slower traffic that is courteous
enough to use the RH lane, don't blow their doors off. Slow down before
gettin too close so as not to startle the slowbie if he does happen to
glance in the rear view mirror. Pass slowly too; the attention of troopers
can be quickly drawn by a pass at a high speed differential. Wait until
safely back in the RH lane to resume warping.

Or here in the states.

I (twice) used the deck in front of my apartment (I sure hope my landlord 
isn't on this list...) and a come-along to remove the engine from my old
subaru.

The neighbor came by during the process and asked if I was *sure* that 
was a good idea.  I told her the engine weighted perhaps 400 lbs. and 
asked if she'd be worried about two big guys standing up there.  

I still wouldn't have wanted the landlord to drop by...

I haven't tried this, but I did look into it a few years ago.  So 
consider this a starting point and verify it before you start
(of course that's a good idea with any net.info).

I think you can use the front seat belt holes for the lap belt,
the rear seat belt holes for the shoulder belts, and Y the anti-
sub belt to the seat mounting holes.

This leave only one set of holes to drill:  for the cross bar that 
goes between the door posts.  You run the shoulder belts *over* 
this bar to avoid compressive injuries.  It's not optional, the 
shoulder belts must be going roughly horizontal aft of the seat.

Two more thoughts (the crowd sat stunned, awed...)

I've ridden many 600 mile days on my motorscooter *just* to get into, and
remain in, this state.  It's addictive.

Other hazard-stuff to integrate: This may be insultingly obvious (so's yer
old man) but, get into the habit of scanning *every* on-comming vehicle for
roof-line silhouete first, then for other clues.  Every time you see a cop 
on the road, *Observe Carefully* the way the car rides. HP (and most patrol) 
cars have HD supsensions that give them a distinctive signature, they 
sit/ride *differently* than the hoi-polloi.  Like the suspension, tires are
another flag.  HP cars will have big, fat, blackwall HD tires.  Look at the 
driver's side windshield pillar, many unmarked cars have spotlites. In fact, 
nearly every spotlite you will see these days comes with a cop car attached.
IMHO, learning what your local HP folks use as unmarked vehicles is a good
idea, but in many areas it can also give you a false sense of security.
Cops are crafty, and more and more are choosing vehicles that (they hope)
many folks would consider Unlikely to be Cop cars.  With practice, using 
the more subtle clues will be integrated and you will do it without 
conscious thought.

I can only address the SC engine with the stock CIS pistons, and then 
only from research I have done. As you probably know, the CIS system is 
pretty intolerent of non-stock cams. But since you are planning on 
Webers, you don't have to worry about that part. When you look at the CIS 
pistons, you notice a huge bump on one side. This is an integral part of 
the system, to induce swirl into the combustion chamber from the built-up 
charge waiting in the intake port. This bump really limits the lift and 
duration you can get away with. I found two sources for possible 
solutions: First is Jerry Woods who regrinds magic into your SC cams so 
that they will work even with the CIS. Second is Web-Cam, who have two 
similar solutions. Neither of these "solutions" are inexpensive. I don't 
know much about the performance gain, but judging from the Web-cam specs, 
there isn't a whole lot of lift and duration to be gained. Both sources 
indicated they had carefully worked around the clearance problem. My 
personal judgement was a minimal gain for $400-700.
You will also have to deal with the mainfolds which will probably not 
match your intake port sizes. Many of the older Weber engines had 
relatively small port sizes (i.e. 36 mm) versus 38-39 for the SC's and 40 
for the Carrera. You'll also have to deal with the extra "hole" in the 
CIS heads where the CIS injectors squirted fuel towards the intake valve. 
Unless you get an intake designed for the CIS heads (they are available), 
you will have to have a welder heliarc the "hole" and regrind back to the 
original. This isn't as hard as it might seem. We've done two engines and 
a good welder won't charge you all that much. Just make sure he's worked 
on aluminum alloy before!
Good luck, Dave Christiano.

Is it true that conventional four-finger engine stands should not be

specifically for Porsches show a mounting surface that consists of a
steel plate that is cut in a C-shape so it can bolt around the perimeter
of the case where it mates with the trans, thus distributing the load
over a fairly wide surface area.

Are the four-finger type engine stands are frowned upon for Porsche
because they would put too much stress on the top two bolt holes of the

Subject: 951 chips & tires

In regard to someone's posting on 951 chips:
They definitely work. I have an Autothority 2.7 in my '86 951. It is 
suppose to provide an extra 53hp. It really increases "seat of the pants" 
power between 3K and 5K rpm. It does this by bringing in the boost earlier, 
and raising maximum boost and redline. I don't push my car very hard or 
fast, ie. rarely hit 2 on the boost gauge, get about 16 miles to the 
gallon, and have really only found the power useful for the accelerating in 
4th gear from about 75mph to 125mph for quick left lane passing of weaving 
Hyundais. I have had zero problems with this chip, but would probably would 
not get it again, as the additional power vs. probable decreased 
reliability was not worth it. As recommended by various sources, I also 
don't have a catalytic converter. That seemed to make zero difference in 
the power, but lets the turbo spool up a little faster, and reduces the 
chances of melting the cat since it is in the kitchen.  Again, not worth it 
on the street. The Autothority chip is probably the most popular due to 
their marketing department and repuation with German cars, and the most 
derided chip out there due to it's tendency to toast head gaskets on the 
track. I like the 30 day guarantee. Jon Milledge makes the best chip, per 
the net wisdom. Fewer grenaded engines for Nathan Ulrich and others.

Dual purpose tires:
I have been running road racing tires on the street for so long that I 
don't even know how a normal tire handles. They seem to provide the best 
road-sucking handling. They don't wear as quickly as the treadwear ratings 
(30 on the current RE71's) would indicate. Scanning the ads in Excellence, 
European Car, and Grass Roots Motorsports will eventually produce a sale on 
last year's model. So will joining Team TA. I usually stock up, hence the 
11 tires in the kitchen that the catalytic converter is leaning on. 
Recently Project Racing and Blackburn Racing were closing out RE-71's in 
the $75 range. I found these to be a dramatic improvement over the tires 
the were on the car when I bought it (Yok 008P's.) However I have 
previously purchased Toyo's, TA's, Yok's, Gatorback's, etc. always feeling 
that I got my money's worth. The tires should be DOT legal and unshaved for 
street use. Use them for racing after you scuff them a bit.

Does anyone have any experience putting an '89 951 turbo charger on an '86 
951? What does it do for power? turbo lag? reliability? Which DME and KLR 
should you use? How about the bigger Automotion turbocharger?

Mike,

You can use the later door panels on your '86.  The changes in the
later panels are:

        a. The door pockets are replaced with a section used to house the
           woofer, midrange and crossover unit.

        b. There is a cutout and mounting plate at the front, above the window
           switches for the tweeter.

        c. No hole where the old 4x6 speakers are situated

I picked up a perfect set of speakers, replacement sections for the door
pockets and speaker mountings from a wrecked '89 944S. ($150US, Campbell
Nelson, Seattle). I my existing '86 panels as the ones in the '89 944S were in
worst shape, plus Campbell Nelson was asking too much for the panels.  The door
pocket replacement section mounts exactly the same as the '86 door pockets
(i.e. under the arm rest).

Subject: Re: 914 Brake Bleeding Questions

Ahhhhh - perhaps I misunderstood you. There are very small (7-10mm in
diameter, 2-3mm thick) o-rings that seal the fluid passageways between the
calipers. I thought that's what you meant.  A while back (2-3 years?)
European car had an article on rebuilding the rear calipers, and if I'm not
mistaken one could clearly see these wee-little O-rings in the picture of
the rebuild kit.

I doubt the sponginess would be as a result of these little O-rings
(they're sitting inside some very tight pockets), but of course every
little bit helps ...

Note that some caliper designs (mainly racing ones, but also some street -
e.g. the Brembos on the new Ferrari F335tb) use external lines to route the
fluid from the inside half of the caliper to the outside half. They clearly
don't need these O-rings, so I presume that the only rubber in these units
are piston /cylinder seals and the dust shields.

     better off with a 220V MIG.  Yes, you must clean the welding surfaces 
     carefully before doing any kind of electic welding (not as critical 
     for gas welding).  This can be done quickly with an electric (or air 
     if you have it) grinder or sander.  This will also remove the remains 
     of your existing sway bar mount.

Your welding expertise is sought. If this subject had been 
beaten on before, please point me to the archive.
     
When I bought my 76/911S, the rear bracket holding the rear 
anti-sway bar was broken. Now, I am ready to weld a new
bracket on myself after checking on the prices. (between $200-$400 
for just the weld job). I can probably afford a decent welder 
for that price. Anyway, here are some my questions/concerns:
     
1) Was the original electric or heat welded?    
2) How can I remove the broken remain on the chasis?
3) What current (AMP) size do I need to do the job if electric weld it. 
4) Do I need to sand off the paint and clean the surface really well?
     
Anything that I should watchout for?
     
Thanks all for your help.

Subject: Re: 914 FI Resistor - What value?

Hear Ye, 914 Experts!

From what I have heard and read in this very mailing list, I believe there
is an _additional_ resistor between the head temperature sensor and the
wiring harness. I believe this was done in '73 or '74.  This is the
"resistor" people talk about, quite apart from the head temperature
"sensor."  I have never seen it in any wiring diagram, etc., but I don't
have the factory manual. I don't believe it's in the parts book, either.
Its presence would cause the engine to run richer over the entire
temperature range.

Of course its existence is a bit odd, as a new head temperature sensor
could simply incorporate such a resistor. Perhaps old sensor + resistor =
new sensor. When I ordered the sensor from Performance, they made no
attempt to distinguish the one(s) for the 1.7 and 1.8 from the 2.0, and the
engine didn't run great (though it had other problems, like 1.7 injectors
in #1 and #2 - Ouch!).  I eventually replaced this sensor with the supposed
correct one (courtesy Otto's) for the 2.0 as part of a top-end rebuild, and
it measures quite differently.

Perhaps this is all a rumor, but I would like to get to the bottom of it.
Could anyone shed some light on this?

Albequerque also has an excellent Porsche dealership as I found out one
cold night when I lost a head temperature sensor north of Soccorro. However
if an airport is not a big consideration, I vote for Santa Fe; just an
hour's drive north. Plenty of accomodations, excellent restaurants et al
muy tourista.

The drive from Santa Fe to Taos over the old high road is incredible, and
doable with a return the same day via the more travelled low roads. All
paved, (I have enclosed a small .gif of this drive complete with 911-
picture is about 9000 feet - time is Thanksgiving 1992)

Subject: More questions on the 944S clutch

I've been looking at the various options on replacing the clutch on the my
'87 944S.  The mechanic that usually works on the car recommends going with
the standard porsche rubber center arrangement.  However, a number of other
mechanics recommend going with a spring center arrangement.  I am willing to
tolerate the additional noise.  However, has anyone out there done this?
How well did it work out?  What combination of disk and flywheel did y'all
end up using?  (I've heard the 924 Turbo Clutch Disk combined with the 911
flywheel or the 924 GTR flywheel works).  Any hints would be greatly
appreciated.

I bought a Lincoln Model 100 "gasless MIG" welder for $295 at Home Depot.
Its a nice welder and as a bonus it plugs into a normal 110v outlet.  If 
you need bigger capacity, they have the Model 125, which needs a 220v,
but it has a duty cycle of (I think) 30% instead of 20%.  I recently
did a LOT of welding on my bus (I installed a facyory sunroof, and I laid
down about 60 feet of bead all told) and I didn't have any capacity problems.
The other bonus with this welder is that you get a video and a cheezy 
welding helmet.  Its not good for welding, but you can do 2 things with it:

A) Give it to your SO to use while she watches you, the stud welder, fix
the car...

B) Give it to TED and turn him loose at Sears Point. :O

Subject: WTB: 928 Phase II!

>>>should the year and/or miles really bother my search that much?

The '89 5-speeds have one significant (IMO) advantage over what preceded them: a
2.7 rear axle, vs. the 2.2 axle of the predecessors.  The gearing of the stock
US 928's is ridiculous, presumably that way to avoid gas guzzler penalties.  I
can exceed 50 in 1st, and 150 in fourth.  What do I need 5th for?  So I can
cruise 60 mph at 1700 RPM?  Thanks a lot! 2.7 was the European ratio all along.
BTW the ring & pinion costs about $1,300 and about that much in labor to
install.  Curiously neither this nor the nearly 30 HP increase from '85 to '89
really shows in the *factory* performance figures. Also, '87's and on have much
better (stronger, smoother) clutches and (IMO) are better looking.

>>>When did Porsche fix the predominant electrical problems with
the 928? Would the 84/85 years be safe?

My '86 hasn't had any serious electrical problems.   What are the "predominant
electrical problems" people keep mentioning?  I've never heard of this, other
than an allusion to everything going south if the relay board gets wet.

>>>Do I want (excluding performance) the 32V engine of the S4
over the 16V engine of the older vehicles?

This question reminds me a little of "Sophie's Choice", but anyway...
If you really really don't care about the extra 60-80 horsepower (ouch! one full
second off the 1/4 mile time!), the two-valve has the advantage of not eating
$4,000 worth of valves and labor when it's timing belt goes.  But then the car
it's in has smaller brakes, etc. etc.  BTW, I'm not talking about Euro
two-valves here.  That's another story.....

>>>The list.wisdom result was 8 for, 2 against (including Stan)...

Gene: somehow I missed this thread.  Any chance you could e-mail me the ten
answers you got?  Or at least indicate the date range so I can look in my old
digests?

Thanks,

Alan Watkins ('86 928S).

Subject: Re: Porsche Wedding...

Well, this gives me a great idea for a new Porsche product.

The Porsche Wedding Kit.

High performance cans, and a neon just married sign that replaces the
rear light  section like the "Porsche" and "Turbo" signs you see back there
sometimes on 924S/944. 

	The R&D necessary to find cans which will not be destroyed in the
process of making noise at 150mph could get very expensive. Also, the noise
should be pleasant to the ear. Maybe the cans should be self-tuning...

	So... what would be a fair price for a dozen cans, some rope, 
and a lit sign. $799.95 sounds fair to me. After all weddings are in themselves
very expensive, without getting Porsches involved too. 

	Any business advice (or investments) porschephiles might provide on
this project will be appreciated :-). 

	And, incidentally, congradulations! Any use for the rear seats soon?

Subject: Buying my first Porsche

Right now, I'm working in Munich, Germany and I cannot help but
notice that used Porsches can be had a lower prices than in the UK.

(LHD is no problem given my circumstances.)

So, I am considering taking advantage of this opportunity, but I'd
like some advice or pointers before parting with my D-Marks.

Examples of 2 cars that I have seen which bracket my price range
are:

Low end: 944 Turbo approx 10 years old unknown mileage DM8,800

High end: 911 similar age, 65,000 miles DM25,000

Are there any buyers guides that I should be reading? Are there
any FAQs covering these models? Is there a general Porsche book
list?

If the answer is no to all of the above, I guess that I'll come
back with a whole heap of questions.

Thanks.	John O'Connor

Hello,

I'm looking into buying an '83 911SC Coupe and have a few questions I hope 
someone can help me out with.

First, I'm not up on my knowledge of Porsches, what does the SC designation 
signify (ie. what is included in this package) and how does it compare with 
other packages for that year ('83)?

Second, was '83 a good year for 911's?  Was this a reliable model/year or will I 
be buying into some headaches?

Third, what should I look for in a used Porsche?  What are the problems to be 
wary of?  How do I tell if I'm getting a good car?

Fourth, how reliable are these cars?  What kinds of repairs might I expect and 
what are the maintenance costs on a car of this vintage?

Thanks, please reply or cc to me at schicked@aur.alcatel.com.  I just subscribed 
to this list this morning and don't expect to see any traffic from it for a day 
or two.

Thanks again,
Mark Schickedantz

PS:  Expedience would be appreciated.  The person selling this car is motivated 
to sell it and I need to move quickly.

Subject: Muffler installation on 944

Ok Folks,
 
  I finally received my Borla muffler and a complete set of new
hoses for my 85.5 944. Before I start R&R, I have a few questions
 
R&R of the muffler:
- -------------------
    - Has anybody installed such a muffer on their 944-mobile?
      Any prepration, parts or tools I need. Borla came with
      an stainless steel clamp, exhaust pipe and a muffler.
 
    - Can I get the jobs done with a few broken or stripped bolts
      or do I need a welding unit?
 
    - Is there some sort of sealant I should use to ensure a tight
      and leak free joints. I remember reading something about it
      recently, but don't have the ftp connection to scan through
      the archives.
 
For the Water hoses:
- --------------------
    - I want to cover the new hoses with sleeves that are sold in
      discount auto store and can be seen on the cars featured on
      the cover of the HotRod magazine.  I think that these sleeves
      are basically used to decorate water and other hoses.
      I like the looks but don't know the merits and demerits of this
      alteration.
 
    - Will there be any heating problem or immature deterioration of the
      hoses under heavy (track) driving conditions.
 
 
thanks,
Husain.

Mike,

I think I have posted this experience before, so sorry for the bandwidth:

When I attempted to have my ADS 320i speakers from a previous car installed
in my (then) new '87 944 Turbo (951) the installer sadly told me that the
window tracks changed from pre-87 to 87, and there was no longer clearance
for the large magnet of the 320i woofer (the tweeter would mount OK in the
upper part of the door panel forward of the electric window switches.

This was one of the top installers in the country (Rich Inferra of Rich's Car
Tunes in Watertown, Mass) so I tend to believe what he was telling me (in
fact he had sold me the system I was moving from one car to the other, so had
no reason to mislead me). We ended up with Blaupunkt coaxials in the stock
front door locations. Very disappointing sonically. And one of my friends
with an '86 had 320i's which sounded wonderful. I believe that the 320i's are
still available. I would recommend them _very_ highly.

Best of luck...

Thanks for responding, but I'm a little unclear what you did.
I have not seen what the newer panels look like.  Is there a part
of the panel that you can replace (door pockets) that allows you to
mount the round woofers and tweeters instead fo the 4X6s?  If so,
could you elaberate on what exactly you did because I would really
like to have the component set of speakers instead of the 4X6s.

My Drake repair manual had no reference at all to gas heaters and my Haynes

other is perfect, BTW, have caps for ALL wheels silver ones for the

There's a Wurth product called HHS 2000 which is a very good penetrating

Yes, get out the plasticine and micrometer.  Bruce's book has the

you need a little more clearance than he calls for from steel valves.

Excuse me if I am stating the obvious, but:

Any high performance vehicle, Porsche or otherwise, that is ever driven in
a high performance manner, on track or off, should have its critical
systems checked on a regular basis.
Any modified vehicle, high performance or not, should have its critical
systems checked even more often.
Anyone who ignores this basic safety criteria is too dumb to live and
certainly should not posess a driver's license.

When I endorsed the use of braided brake lines for street use I made the
mistake of assuming that this was absolute minimum basic knowledge, known
and accepted by all. :-)

I know a great deal about Porsches, Claudia.
I know the 914 is considered the runt of the litter, and not a _true_
Porsche, by most porchephiles.
I know a lot of this disrespect stems from the 914's puny VW four cylinder
engine.
I know that at one time Porsche experimented with a V8 powered 914.
I know all the true racing Porches are two passenger mid-egined cars, like
the 914.
I know my 914 is quicker and faster than any street legal factory Porsche.
I know I can get a tuneup at the corner gas station in any small town in
America, for less than $150.
I know: 'If its got more than two seats it ain't a sportscar.'
I know: 'If its got less than 300HP its not high-performance.'

Fanfare! "Let the flames begin!"

How to remove a dead whale

The Farside comes to life in Oregon.

I am absolutely not making this incident up; in fact I have it
all on videotape.  The tape is from a local TV news show in
Oregon, which sent a reporter out to cover the removal of a
45-foot, eight-ton dead whale that washed up on the beach.  The
responsibility for getting rid of the carcass was placed on the
Oregon State Highway Division, apparently on the theory that
highways and whales are very similar in the sense of being large
objects.  So anyway, the highway engineers hit upon the plan --
remember, I am not making this up -- of blowing up the whale with
dynamite.  The thinking is that the whale would be blown into
small pieces, which would be eaten by seagulls, and that would be
that.  A textbook whale removal.

So they moved the spectators back up the beach, put a half-ton of
dynamite next to the whale and set it off.  I am probably not
guilty of understatement when I say that what follows, on the
videotape, is the most wonderful event in the history of the
universe.  First you see the whale carcass disappear in a huge
blast of smoke and flame.  Then you hear the happy spectators
shouting "Yayy!" and "Whee!"  Then, suddenly, the crowd's tone
changes.  You hear a new sound like "splud."  You hear a woman's
voice shouting "Here come pieces of...MY GOD!"  Something smears
the camera lens.

Later, the reporter explains: "The humor of the entire situation
suddenly gave way to a run for survival as huge chunks of whale
blubber fell everywhere."  One piece caved in the roof of a car
parked more than a quarter of a mile away.  Remaining on the
beach were several rotting whale sectors the size of condominium
units.  There was no sign of the seagulls who had no doubt
permanently relocated to Brazil.

This is a very sobering videotape.  Here at the institute we
watch it often, especially at parties.  But this is no time for
gaiety.  This is a time to get hold of the folks at the Oregon
State Highway Division and ask them, when they get done cleaning
up the beaches, to give us an estimate on the US Capitol.

Subject: Stealth Driving...

P-Files,

   I purchased a book some time ago called "How To Avoid Speeding Tickets, The 
Fast Driver's Handbook" by Matt Reynolds.  It is a very complete look at the 
techniques that can be used to travel at high speed while remaining virtually 
undetected.  Many of the comments already posted here are mentioned in the book.  
The one that is repeated over and over though is the idea that when you drive 
fast, it is your responsibility to be aware of your surroundings.  Most people 
on the roads with you are driving in a trance.  A 55MPH speed limit is probably 
appropriate given their level of attention.
  
   If you are preparing to drive fast, turn down the radio (or off) and focus on 
what you're doing.  Look ahead and anticipate.  Most people who are driving on 
the highway are only looking about 50 feet in front of their car.  You need to 
train yourself to constantly scan the whole scene for signs of trouble.  If you 
look ahead at traffic and notice 2 or 3 cars with brake lights on suddenly, 
you're probably approaching a speed trap.  Let others who aren't paying such 
good attention get the tickets!

   Also VERY important is courtesy.  As the book mentions, there is a 
distinction between a fast driver, and a _safe_ and fast driver.  We've all been 
in a situation where someone has come up through traffic swerving through all 
the lanes and travelling at a much higher speed than prevailing traffic.  This 
is the behavior that reflects badly on all fast drivers, even the safe ones.  As 
a rule, you shouldn't be passing other traffic by more than 10 to 15mph.  This 
serves two purposes.  First, it puts other drivers at ease since you've resisted 
"blowing their doors off" and second, it makes it harder for police to detect 
your true speed visually.  If you appear to be going "about" the same speed as 
everyone else, you'll be less of a target.

BTW -> New Freedom Publications has published other books by this same author.  
One is called "Safe At Any Speed: The High Performance Driving Handbook" and my 
personal favorite "How To Win In High Speed Pursuit". (Yes, that's really what 
it's called!)


Enjoy!

Subject: Re: 911 Steering Wheels

     The steering wheel slop problem is likely not the bearing,
but rather a disintegrated nylon sleeve which used to snugly go
between the bearing and the steering shaft.  You can verify this
by removing the steering wheel and looking.  (about a 10 min job
 - just disconnect the battery, pull off the horn pad, mark the
wheel and shaft for reassembly, remove bolt and washer, and slide
off the wheel.)

     Repair choices:     The dealer wanted about $15 for the
bearing, and 2 hours labor to install, since the steering column
containing the flashers, etc must be removed to replace the
bearing.  2nd choice is an after market high quality tough
plastic sleeve which you can simply rap into place using an
appropriate sized piece of tubing or pipe.  This is done with the
steering wheel off, but requires no further disassembly.  I found
the aftermarket sleeve at AJR (local in SD).  They charged $25
for the thing, and apologized for the price given what trivial a
piece it is.  But hey, it did the job, and saved $115 at the
dealer, or a half day of labor on my part, not to mention the
risk of damaging something in the process 8^{)>

     You didn't mention the model - mine is an '83 SC.

Howdy,

 Last night in the mail I received catalog called 'Classic Motorbooks'.
Inside there are tons of books from HotWheel cars to Drag racing, but
the ones I'm interested in of course are the ones about Porsches, 911's
to be exact. Here is a small list of the ones I'm interested in.

I should say that I don't own a Porsche yet (but I will by this time
next year, hopefully a 84-86 911 Coupe or 80-83 SC) so I am looking 
for info on performance, history, and things to look for when 
buying a used 911 etc. Anyway heres the list:

Porsche 911 Performance Handbook by Bruce Anderson 

Porsche 911: Guide to Purcahse & Restoration by Lindsay Porter & Peter
 Morgan

Illustrated Porsche Buyers guide (Third Edition) By Dean Batchelor
  (I have this already but it is the 2nd Edition)

Porsche 911SC 1978-83 - this is a book of articles put together by
 Brooklands Books from the leading automotive magazines.

Porsche 911: Forever Young By Tobias Aichele - This book won't be
out until November. According to the catalog this is a book is 
a (and I quote) "An especially well-researched and extremely 
extensive work on the Porsche 911". 

Anyway I plan on going to the library to see if they have any of
these books but I was just wondering if any of you have read them
and if so what did you think.

If you have problems with the CIS system, then buy yourself a PEFI system
and program your own fuel injection with a laptop!  Webers or any other carbs
for that matter are a waste of time and money, as they will never be able to
match the efficiency of fuel injection (horsepower, mileage, etc.).

Better yet, see if you can get ahold of the schematics of a Supercup brain

Subject: 914 Restoration/Modification Questions


I found a '70 914-1.7 which suffered extensive fire damage to the passenger
compartment.  Since the engine, powertrain, and suspension were all in great
shape, the body workable, and the price was $200, I decided to take it upon 
myself to restore/rebuild this car from the ground up.

Currently, the engine is in the basement, recently dismantled and cleaned.  
I purchased new bearings, seals, and the like, and also picked up a Japanese 
big bore kit.  The kit replaces the 90mm stock 1.7 pistons, rings, pins and 
cylinder sleeves, with their 96mm equivalents.  Before I go further, I should 
point out my primary interest is in getting the most torque out of the engine 
as possible.  Top-end speed falls secondary to off-the-lkine quickness.

How will the 96mm kit affect the aspiration of the engine?  I plan on replacing
the heater boxes and muffler with headers(I'm open to other suggestions).  
What about the valves/cam?  Should they be addressed?

How will the 96mm kit affect the D-Jetronic fuel injection?  I'd like to ensure
that the stock injection system is adaptable to the increase in displacement?

Now on to a question about bodywork.  I'm adding 914-6 GT fiberglass flares, 
and have heard differing methods of attachment.  I plan on cutting off the 
extra sheet on the fenders, leaving about 1" or so as a lip for attaching the
flares.  I then was going to attach the flares with rivets and fill in the 
seam with body filler.  Someone told me about adhesives which can be used to 
do the same thing?  Any suggesstions would be appreciated.

Finally, does anyone know where I can find the asphalt matting which was used 
on the firewall and the floor pan of the 914?  I'm not interested in paying
for a 'kit' or the sheets that some of the catalogs offer, since they seem
a bit overpriced.  Any equivalent material would suit me fine as well.

Thanks for the ear,

  OFFICE MEMO          re 1983 SC                             Date:9/8/94
Mark,
I have own an '83 SC (Euro Model) for the last 2.5 years.  I looked at many
911s before settling on this model.  
The '83 SC are the last of their model and hence, Porsche worked most of the
bugs out that plagued earlier 911s.  In '84 Porsche went to the Motronic
ignition (all electronic) - the '83s are electromechanical.  
The prevailing wisdom is that the engines in the SCs are among the most
reliable Porsche ever built.  The chain tensioners in the '82 and '83 are of
the improved kind, but not the hydraulic (powered by oil pressure) kind found
on the '84 and newer 911s.
The repairs I made to the car have all been for the most part minor (e.g.,
new auto antenna, new hi/lo switch, new radio/tape player & speakers).  I had
two less minor repairs: a new fuel pump - old one developed a leak and a new
alternator/regulator.  One has to expect some wear on an 11 year old car. 
 I enjoy driving the car - have been on longish trips (6hrs) - and highly
recommend the model and year.
Elliot.

- ---------------------------------------------------
I just got my latest European Car mag ... a review of 
a 911 book by a fellow named Zimmerman... the '72 911T
was considered a low point in the lineage.  
Since that happens to be my car I need/want/demand to know
why my little daily thrill giver is thought a dog.   Anybody
want to educate me? I am aware of the 915 tranny seal
situation but what else would be the basis on this 
dubious distinction? 
- -----------------------------------------------------

This Zimmerman guy sounds like a loser. A '72 911 T is quicker
than the original 911S, with MUCH more useable torque.
It has a strong transmission and engine which are not tempermental
and should be reliable. The oil tank in the fender is cool, like
a 959, and only a problem if you're an idiot and try to put
gas in it, or let a moron refuel the car. The shift linkage can
easily be upgraded to a later model assembly if you want. I had
the infamous '72 tranny seal failure (from 73 on, the seal could
be changed without disassembling the tranny), but it was time for
new synchros anyway so the rebuild was not at all inconvenient.

The low point in the 911 lineage is probably the '75 - '77 cars.
I don't include the '74 because they have some great stuff like early
heat exchangers, light weight, and decent engines if rebuilt with
the correct studs and inserts- and the '74 Carrera model was one of the
best 911s imported to the USA (although lame compared to it's European
MFI equipped brother). Your 2.4 T will do everything better than the '75
to '77 cars. Unfortunately, this also includes rusting away...

Many people even prefer a '72 T to an SC or Carrera, as the '72 is more of
a sports car, while the SC/Carrera became a GT car. The feeling is very
different, the later cars are more isolated from the pure driving experience.

Anyway, if you like your car (as I'm sure you do) don't worry about what
others think. I loved my 914 1.7 15 years ago, when they were considered
junk. Now they are considered "70's speedsters".

Well, I like to use a section of fence pipe (like you use for chain
link).  As for how much before it shows, I did mine fairly seriously
just before painting the car, and with good prep work, it was hard to
tell.  Now, however, I sometimes stuff larger tires under the fenders
and have had to do it more -- but that's what touch up paint is for!

Subject: Linkage, Hinge, and Gen. Lubrication

Fellow Porschephiles,

In two recent postings, Adrian asked about lubricating door hinges and Steve
asked about lubricating throttle linkages. For these and other similar parts
where a household 3-in-1 oil or WD40 is likely to be used, I have found a
lubricant which has performed very, very well: Slick 50 Spray Lube.

The Slick 50 Spray Lube works better than the silicone sprays, and much better
than WD40, which  gums up. I first used it on my trunk lid catch which used
to squeak whenever I went over bumps. The Slick 50 cured the squeak immediately
and now, almost a year later, the squeak has yet to return. Since then I've
used it on my throttle linkages, my door hinges, and even my window regulator.
It's worked flawlessly.

SuperLube is also a very highly rated general lubricant which would probably
do a great job, but my experience with it is limited to marine applications.
I've never put it on a car.

Happy lubeing,

Dustin Boyette

Pete:

I think your post accurately summarizes the situation - if you do find a
p-valve for the later cars, I would definitely like to hear about it.  I
can (and have often) locked up the fronts without locking up the rears, so
an adjustment is probably in order - in or out to increase rearward bias? I
presume the factory balance has been upset because my car has 195/50's
(previous owner), quite a bit smaller in diameter than the original tires.

Is a certain amount of flexing of the entire pedal assembly to be expected?
I detect no rust in that area, but the sheet metal is pretty thin, and I'm
exerting a fair amount of force when braking, certainly more than I would
like.

Fellow Porschephiles,

I'm looking to buy a 911 engine that's blown or in major need of a rebuild.
I really don't care how bad off it is so long as the case is not cracked and
the crank is serviceable. I don't care what year or size or anything like that.
This will be a "practice" engine for my learning how to rebuild these things.
I don't care if the FI or carbs are missing, either. CHEAP is the keyword here.
I'm not in a rush. Sometime in the next two to three months, perhaps.

I'm talking CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP BASKET CASE MOTOR!!!!!

So, if you've got one, let me know. If you don't, keep your eyes open for me.
I know somebody's got one laying in the corner of a garage somewhere.

Subject: Re: 911 engine stands

Steve,

> I am interested in what you find out about 4 finger engine stands as I

Here's what I have so far:

I'm pretty sure that these are NOT appropriate for Porsche/VW engines.
Automotion advertises an engine stand that is specifically for Porsche
but it is bench mounted, not free-standing, and very expensive
(more than $300). Bill Kennedy uses a $25 J.C. Whitney VW stand
but warns that it is not strong enough by itself and requires some
form of supplementary support. Where the J.C. Whitney catalog 
advertises 4-finger stands it states that they will not work for
VW/Porsche. One of my shop manuals has a picture of a Porsche
on an engine stand and it is the type with a crescent-shaped flat plate
of steel. Maybe a four-finger model could be adapted by making
a crescent-shaped plate. I might give this a try since I just 
bought a freestanding four-finger model that is quite strong 
(rated at 750 lbs) with good welds for only $100. As soon as 
i separate the motor and trans I'll have a better feel for whether 
or not that is a practical solution.

One other option if you buy or have a freestanding four-finger model
is to try to find a head that works for Porsche engines (like
the Automotion one, only cheaper) and use
the same base. The head has a stub of pipe that fits inside of
another horizontal piece of pipe on the base, about waist level.
Obviously the critical measurement for determining whether or
not you can interchange is the diameter of the pipe.

Fellow Porschephiles,

Okay all you 911SC owners out there, just what is the true redline of the stock
911SC engine? My tach redlines at about 6300 (it supposedly goes with the
'80 SC engine in my '74) but I've heard the rev limiter is actually set
to 6800 RPM. My engine doesn't seem to run out of breath all the way up to
the indicated redline, but I've never taken it above that to see when it
does. So just how far can I push it? At what point does something harmful
happen (such as valves banging pistons)? Bruce's book talks about SC stock
parts (crank, rods) being good for occasional jaunts beyond 7500 RPM.
What gives??? What do your tachs say???

When I lived in the south of Munich in Grunwald and commuted to Garching
a few miles north of Munich, I would use the #99 Autobahn "Ring road" 
which went east around Munich. The distance from my Apartment to the
Autobahn onramp was perfect for warming the car up, and I would just
shift at red- line in each gear until none were left, and stay there
for the length of the trip. Having said that, and confesing that I
had a 90hp Audi 80 you can guess that I got passed alot.

When the 750 BMW, and the 560S class cars would go by the quake would
rock the car. On the odd morning that somebody was driving their toy
Porsche, Hartge M6, or whatever the left blinker was always on, and the
headlights that had flashed miles previous went by in a brief Whoosh,
rrrrraaaawn sound. It was better than coffee in the morning.

I once was passed on the Autobahn from Fulda towards Stuttgart by a
959 Porsche as I was cruising at 120+ mph. I noticed far back
the glint of light off an approaching cars windshield, and on second 
glance I saw a silver Porsche, when I looked a third time my mirrors were
empty, and at almost the same moment this silver "Thing" went by so fast
and with such a low, deep growl I could not believe it. I was going 
something like 220 Kph and was passed like I was in reverse at 
full throttle. 

This, On a flat road miles ahead, and behind. The whole thing took less
than a minute from the time I noticed the car until he had passed the
horizon infront. I kept hoping he would finish his "Lap of the earth"
before I reached Stuttgart. Porsche is just off of the same Autobahn...?

Have you ever been passed by a car and thought "I'll catch up for a second
look" and found yourself at redline in fifth gear?
I still get alittle buzz from remembering it.

The contests are usually along the lines of "Start with two >running< bugs,

Last time I checked the record was held by Kurtzmans, in Quincy MA, 1 minute

It's been about half a year since I rebuilt a rear 914 caliper, but I
believe the little o-rings in question here are for sealing the adjusting
screws found on this type of caliper. I don't recall the larger caliper
half seals being in the kit. If the smaller ones were used in this

I had the same problem on my 1980 911. You have a worn upper
steering column bearing. You have two choices to fix it:
1 - Replace bearing
New bearing costs about $25 from Performance Products and others,
requires removal of steering wheel and pulling of old bearing and pressing
of new bearing down shaft and into seat. 

2 - Add Bushing
Easiest solution... Plastic bushing available from Performance Products and
others for about $12.00. Requires removal of steering wheel and pressing of
bushing down shaft and between old bearing and bearing seat.

I chose option 1 but have heard that option 2 is easier and works as well.

Hope this helps.
George

Subject: ESPN Supercup schedule question



  On the Supercup Race Schedule that (I think) was posted to this list,
it shows that the ESPN telecast of the Hungary (Budapest) Supercup race
will be "Sat. Sept. 25 12:30 AM". Can someone confirm the day/time for
this race? (Sept. 25th is on *Sunday* not *Saturday*).

Thanks!

Subject: RE: 914 fresh air fan....spin the fan with a pencil.


914 fresh air fan assembly.

  These suck.  Getting it out and back in that is..
  The problem is the cowl vent assembly is part of that mess and the
rubber gasket around the mouth of the vent is not as flexy as it
was when new.  The result is a torn or misplaced seal and paths for
water to enter the tank bay.  The fuel tank must be removed to engage
in play with the fan housing and it is all aged plastic (ABS).  Oh, and
the damn thing is loaded with cables and wires -all nice and tightly
adjusted.  Making it very difficult to manuever and work with.  Getting
to the motor requires opening the clamshell, which is held together 
with very strong clips and hogrings..you WILL break some of the plastic
doing this.  All this just to spray some panther piss onto the sleeve
bearings!!

  But there may be a better way;
remove one of the 2 paper hoses from under the cowl that exits the lower
portion of the housing, this is where the nylon squirrel cage fan is.
  Take a pencil and reach into the housing and 'push' the cage to 
break the shaft loose, this will possibly allow the fan to operate
again.  It's a low-torque motor and prone to stick when unused for
a period of time and exposed to moist air thru the cowl vent.
  All bets are off if the inlet screen is munged and leaves have
clogged the fan.
  Since you claim the electrics are ok, there is a good chance
this will work.  I know, the problem will still be in there..but
maybe the next poor devil will get the job.

  Peace,
  -kyle                               the man, 'Tartuffe'..sucked

The SA90 rating includes the fire retardant material as well as the construction
to withstand multiple impacts instead of single impact as in the M90 spec. To
me, motorcyle crashes would seem to have the potential to be more damaging, but
I guess bouncing around in a rolling car requires just as much if not more
protection to keep you alive.  

If you run your car on the track, the SA90 is a wise choice.  Simpson and others
sell entry line SA90s for less than $200.  BTW, many PCA regions already require
the SA90 (*not* an M90) for all track events.

I agree, modifying cars is fun.  Besides most any engine will have more 
power than the stock 914/4 engine ;)  A friend of mine has a Pinto that 
has a lot of horsepower, and he says the handling is setup also.  Of 
course I don't believe him, and give him shit about it every time I see 
him...<g>

I have another friend who doesn't even drive, but wants a Pinto with a 
talking alarm.  He likes Unix, figures...

	Well, I read this, and I started to laugh.  I laughed so
hard that I fell off my chair, and ended up rolling around the floor
in my module at work laughing so hard I ended up with hiccups.
People from 200' away came over to see what all the ruckus was about.

	Everybody asked what was so %&*&#&$%^ funny, and, well, how
do you explain?

	Ted, you are really something.  I not sure what, but realllly

FWIW, not all M90 rated helmets are intended solely for motorcycle
applications.  My Bell Racestar III (M90 rated) is identified by Bell as
an "Auto Racing Helmet".  Again, FWIW, I heard from a Bell representative
that the Racestar III was identical in construction to their SA90 rated
Sport II helmets.  I've worn both and they do seem to be identical, with the
exception of the flame retardant lining (maybe I should be wearing some
flame retardant linings with this post).  I was also told that Bell's M90s
meet the same impact tests as the SA90 stuff.  I weighed the cost 
differential associated with the SA/M90s, my intended usage, the require-
ments for my application (M85 was minimum requirement) and bought
the Racestar III (for about $190 - still wasn't cheap).

OK, you can fry me now.

The final results are in for the first two days at the SCCA Solo II 
Championship in Salina, Kansas.  Though the morning started with rain for 
the first heat, the second heat got a drying track and the last two heats 
had good autocross weather.  Listed below are the final results with the 
individual runs being shown below the competittors name.  Such noteable 
Porsche club members Ken Mitchell and Teresa Lommatzsch ran a Camaro 
owned by Ken in ESP/ESPL.  Results from Thursday/Friday will be posted as 
soon as received now that the data problems have been fixed.

Subject: 928 Performance Modifications ?


My friend is looking into the purchase of a Porsche 928 S4.  What "simple"
changes or adjustments could be made to the 928 to improve performance ? 
He wants to take an "educated, systems" approach to increasing power and
is well aware that all changes need to be in sync with one another.  Here
are some thoughts.  He and I (I would love a 928 someday) would like to
hear other ideas.  thanks, M. 

*  Start with a fresh tune-up and service.

*  Replace the stock air cleaner element with an aftermarket K&N element.  
   Does anyone produce a AC housing that is superior to the stock unit ?
   Is it worth the trouble ?

*  Replace the stock control computer chip with an aftermarket unit by 
   Autothority or Weltmeister or ?  Are the gains substantial ?  Who 
   produces the best aftermarket control chips ?

*  Replace the existing muffler/CC system with a set of headers and/or a set
   of straight pipes with no mufflers or CCs.  Aside from the legality of 
   this modification, would the exhaust note be too loud or harsh and 
   would it require adjustment to the stock induction system and/or 
   ignition ?

*  Addition of an MSD 6A ignition control system.


Thanks for your help.

No, they are fine.  We use a spacer on one arm, and two or more washers

Subject: K&N filters for 911

Kevin Hughes writes:

>Anybody had any experience of the K&N filters on 911s (especially Turbos)?

Kevin,
About a month ago, Jay Ellis (a porschephile on this list), mentioned about 
his K&N air filter on the the back side had "melted" because of some kind of 
manufacturing flaw in England.  He then contacted K&N and got a semi-
confirmation about the problem, I think.  He contacted Perfomance Products 
(where he bought it) and no one admitted to the problem.

Well, I too bought a K&N air filter roughly the same time and also from 
Performance Product.  After reading Jay's e-mail about the problem with the 
air filter, I contacted K&N as Jay suggested.  The person I spoke to would 
NOT admit to any problems and if I wanted an exchange, I would have to take 
the situtation up with the store where I bought it from.

So I called Perfomance Products, and they also didn't know anything about the 
K&N air filter's gasket problems on certain batches.  They would give me a 
credit of the air filter if I wanted to send it back but I would have to pay 
shipping (cost of shipping is not the problem, however the principal is) but 
I didn't want send it back like it was MY mistake for ordering the filter.

I then called K&N again, but this time I spoke to Susan (800-858-3333) as Jay 
suggested and she knew what I was talking about.  She gave me an 
authorization number and told me to send the filter back to her and she would 
ship another filter that has been "tested" to NOT  meltdown.

So far, it's been about a week and I haven't received my "new" air filter yet 
but I don't expect any problem.  So, beware of what batch of K&N air filter 
you are currently getting and maybe wait or verify that you're getting a 
filter that won't meltdown on you.

Thanks to Jay Ellis for his input to the list which helped me to prevent a 
possible misfortune and some bucks, which I probably would have had to suck 
up since I had put off putting the air filter on my C4 pending time or until 
somebody tells me that K&N does wonders!  I bought it because Performance had 
a sale and planned to install it "whenever" (maybe months from now when I 
couldn't get any credit for the flaw if it occurred).

Jerry,
According to my understanding, the SA95 or M95 will not be out until 1995.  
The 95 represent 1995 standards vs. 1985 standards on the SA85 helmet.  
Obviously, the later the year, the more stringent the testing for the "newer" 
helmets.

Hello,

I have an oil leak in my 83' 944. It is around the lower right side of the
engine, but the source is not obvious. My first thought was the oil filter
gasket , but it is clean. The oil starts near the oil cooler area and covers
everything all the way over to the right wheel and back past the engine 
compartment.

I'll try cleaning things off this weekend to see the source,  but I thought 
I'd ask the experienced people on this list.

Porsche did NOT experiment with V8 power for the 914. The 8 cylinder
engine was the type 908, a flat engine of 3.0 liter capacity. Two
versions were made: one with 260 HP, the other with 300 HP. Also
note that these engines were far lighter than your Detroit iron.

All true racing Porsches are NOT two passenger mid-engined cars. Examples
that prove this to be true include: 1960 356B 1600GS Carrera GTL, 1962
804 Formula 1, and all 911-based race cars. Don't forget the water
pumper race cars as well. A true racing Porsche is any Porsche that
Porsche decided to race.

Post the numbers for your car for 0-60, 0-120, quarter mile, and top
speed. I am willing to bet there is a street legal factory Porsche
that will beat your car in some or all of these categories. Also, how
well does your car handle compared to factory cars? Straight line
speed is unimportant if the cars does not handle well.

Two seats has nothing to do with being a sports car. I suppose you
are going to tell us that a 911 is not a sports car because 4 people
can sit in one.

There are a lot of high performance sports cars that have less than
300 HP.

Well, the big bore kit will *help*, but not that much. You won't be in 2.0
territory. You *CAN* build "torque monster" Type IV engines with redlines
of like 4800 RPM,  but that's usually on a 2.3 liter stroker engine with
stock 2.0 bore. I guess you could do that with the 96mm P&Cs (which, BTW,
really are good to use). Bottom line, you want torque, you gotta go to
a longer stroke and your engine life will suffer (20k miles instead of
80-100k miles). For details, send me private mail. Another of my "BT,DT"
stories, to borrow from Dave Darling....

Well, you can leave the stock valves, or you can open it up to 2.0 size
valves. You really have an incredible task to make those heads really
flow. For the EP engine, we start with 1.8 heads and do all sorts of 
nasty re-sectioning to re-contour the inlet ports... *BUT* you're not
going to be turning high RPM *SO IT DOESN'T MATTER*! Leave the heads
alone for better low-speed (RPM, that is) air flow velocities.

Cam? Yeah, that's a good idea. Get the FAT Performance "Fuel Injection Cam".
Don't get anything more radical than that.

> How will the 96mm kit affect the D-Jetronic fuel injection?  I'd like to ensure
> that the stock injection system is adaptable to the increase in displacement?

It's more or less fine. I'd use 2.0 injectors, and consider modifying the
pressure sensor to be adjustable, but that's it. Oh, if you go to the
*BIG* stroker motor, you'll need to do more. Private mail, again.

Sure: Don't Do It.

Except for full fender replacements, I've *NEVER* seen a fiberglass kit
that looked worth a shit if it was home-installed. And even those were
marginal. If you gotta have flares (and I wouldn't do that to a 4 cylinder
car anyway), get the steel flares and have them installed by someone that
knows what they're doing. Check the archives for the last couple of 
months -- we went through that pretty well before.

I use 100 pound tar paper for the floor pan *IF* I bother to put it back.
Never on a race car. Maybe on a street car. For sure on a restoration. For
the firewall, I assume you're talking about the high-density foam in the
engine compartment? If you have to have that, get a good used piece
somewhere. I'm not sure at all where the repros for that are to be found
and I *NEVER* reinstall it except for a full concours resto.

Subject: Fiche reader for sale


I have a used but working fiche reader for sale for $75 (or best offer)
plus shipping. It's not the newest,but new ones cost a lot more.
A fiche reader will allow you to save lots of $$$ on Porsche workshop
manuals by obtaining them on fiche instead of paper. Yes, the binders
are more convenient, but I can't justify them for the amount of time
I need them. (This is just my hobby.) The fiche for my car was $50;
the equivalent binders are about $275 if I recall.

I'm selling it because I have two and only need one. (My workplace
recently upgraded to fiche readers that can also print.) Get this an
avoid (or reduce) those strange looks from folks at your library!

Here are the specs:

Microform Products Realist Microform Reader model 3352.
Approx dimensions 16"x19"x20", weight 30 lbs (yep, made outa real STEEL,
not PLASTIC!) Screen size is 10" x 13". Holds standard 4"x6" fiche.
The viewing size of the dual page Porsche workshop manual on the screen
is about 6"x9". Lens can rotate image 90 degrees if needed. (Handy for
the wiring diagrams.)

Please respond directly to me at 76226.3526@compuserve.com

Thnaks to everyone for your help on the matters of my 914 fresh
air fan, and the heater re-install.

Oh boy, I'm sure looking forward to taking the gas tank out to get
to the fan! And think about the confidence(?!) of the engineers who designed
this: "Well Hans, if you need to put the gas tank in a place which blocks
the fan, no problem: I'll build you a fan to last forever..." And it is
probably a loose wire inside my fan like Pat's: Two or three times the
fan has gone on (at slow speed only), and then it just stops...

You *CAN* use them, but they have to be the omni-adjustable version, and

This is what I have done. But I performed surgery on the stand and 
changed the size of the horizontal pipe to fit the tube on the stand.
BTW, Imparts has a pretty good Porsche stand. *NO ONE* has a cheap

Subject: 911 carb. question + floor pan insulation

Hi P-philes,

Last night on the way out of a restaurant, somebody approached me when he saw
me get into my "new" '73 911S.  He was impressed by the condition of the car
and went on to say that he had restored and sold 3 older 911s.  He asked
about the car and when I mentioned that the previous owner put webers in it,
(not my choice, I'm trying to track down one of the previous owners who
reportedly has the original MFI)  he immediately said that I needed dual
exhaust pipes because the single outlet on a bursch muffler creates too much
back pressure and thus hurts the acceleration. Can anybody confirm or deny
this? If he is not full of sh*t then I would be interested in changing to a
dual exhaust set up in the future.

One more question. What is the material on top of the floor pan in the
passenger area. It's cracked in several areas and a little scraping has
revealed some minor surface rust.(the gremlins have arrived) I would like to
sand the rust away but I'm hesitant to do so until I can put that sound
deading in after I'm finished removing the rust.

Thanks for your help in advance and have a nice weekend.

OK I know this isn't a Porsche part but I know a few of you guys have a Mercedes
also. It is a used evaporator but I will sell it for $350 or best offer. A new
runs around $700 and an aftermarket ones runs around $500.
  Reason for getting a new one: 
      Was having a craddle for a flip phone put in and the phone nicked it with
    his drill. The phone company was footing the bill so I got a new evaporator
    instead of getting it fixed. I took it by a radiator shop that was highly

Ken is absolutely right. The problem I have with these braided lines is
that unlike many other products (e.g  visible cracks on brake rotors, or
bubbles on tires), their outwardly visible condition rarely tells me
anything about how far or close they are to failure. 

What I'm trying to develop is a reasonable rule of thumb for the
replacement of braided brake lines used on street cars that are not driven
as a daily driver. I have never had one fail, but this discussion has given
me pause to think about it.

Muffler:
I will be in need of a muffler for my '86 951 by winter. James Pasha's 
excellent Excellence article said that anything other than stock is a step 
down; including aftermarket stainless steel (assume he meant Borla.) I'm 
guessing that a chipped 951 puts out enough additional heat to shorten 
muffler life. Unfortunately, there is no Euroselect part number for the 
muffler yet #:( Does anyone disagree, or have the real thing sitting in 
their basement. I'm afraid to ask how much the genuine article costs. And 
any reason this shouldn't be a 2 hour job with jackstands, WD40, and a 
Craftsman socket set? Any seals/gaskets to replace at the same time? 
Actually, just the outlet pipe of the muffler is rusting. Maybe I can just 
MIG weld something on:) It seems to sliding out past the black 
plastic(?)sleeve, while making a rattlely, tinny noise and looking like 
swiss cheese.

Clutches: 
Is there a sport, Turbo Cup, or heavy duty clutch for the '86 951? What 
improvements over original? over Euroselect?

Autohaus:
Any positive/negative experiences with AutoHaus in Morristown, NJ. Working 
in NJ makes it a real pain to service the car at AutoSport in Mineola, Long 
Island, and I am looking for something closer. And dealing with Mark at 
Formula Motorsports in Queens always makes me feel that I should be ashamed

when the blinking started way back on the horizon. I move

Subject: Wierd idle in Bert's '88 951S

HI!  I hope someone here can give me some insight onto an annoying 
problem I've been having.  Any answers are greatly appreciated.

I've got an 1988 944 Turbo S (250hp) that is idling at 1400 to 1800 rpm.  
This happens after I put the car in neutral when coming to a stop.  Even 
if I go to neutral at 1000 the revs climb back to 1400.  A quick tap on 
the gas will raise the revs to 2400 after which it drops down to about 
850; which I think in about normal.  The following conditions may or may 
not be relevant to this situation:

 - The idle is rough at 800-900 rpm.  Smooth at 1000+.

 - It takes two tries to start when cold, once if the AC switch is off.

 - It just had the 60K mi. service 2K mi. ago. The car has 64,500 miles.

 - Belts were done at 44K mi.

 - Previous owner put 10K mi. in 1.5 months on the car before I got it.

 - I can hear a faint screech/whistle (tone = middle C) when I shift gears. 
  The sound comes as the revs come down between shifts.  Its very faint   
  though.  The stereo at 1/4 volume drowns it out.

I hope this isn't too enough information.  Having owned two previous 944s 
I've learned to pay very close attention to any irregularities.  

Thanks for your advice.

In CA, it's legal to pass on the right.  However it's illegal to be passed on

the right.  You can receive a citation for obstructing traffic *regardless*
of how fast the other car is going.

No, this is not a common ticket.

By the way, I think the ticket breakdown for a 4 lane freeway is:

Lane 1 (left): 75%
Lane 2:            3%
Lane 3:            2%
Lane 4:           20%

Also, if I recall correctly, something like 85% of all tickets are written 
around the 15th and 30th/31st.

Remember, there are no ticket quotas; officers can write as many as 
they like.

    I dunno, I'd class the 934/935 as "true racing Porsches."  Also, a

    Hmm...  Could be fun to see against a good 930.  Or the previously-

The 3.2 I was referring to belongs to a friend of mine and it already has 
carbs.  The 3.0 is mine and it came with carbs, no FI in sight.  Since I 
already have the carbs, there is *NO* way I'd run out and buy the stock FI 
setup, and the programmable system, although really cool, is way too 
expensive for my wallet at the moment.

I am in no way telling people to toss their FI in favour of Webers.  A 
*PROPERLY* set-up FI system is better than any carb, however, when you start 
changing an engine by altering the displacement, cams, exhaust, etc it takes 
a whole pile more expertise, time, and money to alter the FI than simply 
changing the jets etc in a carb.  Disclaimer:  This is what I've heard - 
Stan, Kevin, Bruce, and other trustworthy people probably know *EXACTLY* what 
the "backyard mechanic" could or could not do with their FI.
 
However, I *DO* think the velocity stacks sticking up in the air on the carbs 
look way cooler than the stock FI system!!!  :-)

But your's isn't a street legal factory Porsche.  More to the point, are your

I know I can get a tune up at home for less than $50 (kind of a stupid

True (FIA(?) definition).

Wouldn't power to weight be a better metric, or do you consider
a semi-truck high performance?


So Ken, what are the skid pad figures?

IMO the 914 is one of the best Porsches ever (and I'm a 911 driver).

The really attractive thing about the 914 is its handling.

I notice you didn't mention how your car handles. 

The problem (so I've heard) with putting a 350 in a 914 is that the 
handling is generally kind of wasted.  I'm sure you've got a fun car.
It's unusual, you did it yourself (presumably) and that's always a 
nice plus.

If you've managed to get a 350 in there *and* keep most of the 
handling, I'd like to hear more (actually, I'd be interested in
hearing more regardless).

Subject: MIG welders that aren't

Hi, Thom.
 
Folks should be aware that there are TWO Lincoln 100 welders out there on
the market. I don't believe the Home Depot one can be converted to MIG; it
relies on flux core wire. Flux core is OK for farm implement repair, maybe
some stuff on the underside of a car, but it CANNOT be used for bodywork.
The true Lincoln Idealarc SP-100, which is MIG-capable, costs about $200
more. By the time you're done, you will be in it for about $700 (gas
regulator, CO2/Ar bottle, line).
 
Flux core is not OK because no matter what you do, you have a dirty weld
just waiting to corrode up through the paint. This is the same reason
brazing is not a good idea on car bodies except as a last resort, followed
by another sandblast to try to get all the flux off.
 
The Home Depot flux core welder also has I think only 4 detents for the
voltage and speed knobs, and when welding thin stuff like body sheet metal
you often find yourself between two settings. The $500 Lincoln has
continuously variable controls.
 
The really cool way to weld is with a TIG torch (Miller Synchrowave is
everybody's current Jones.) That's several thousand dollars but you can weld
ANYTHING with it. Well, almost.

Well I didn't actually do this, but I had an '87 944 and now I have an '89
with the separate speakers.  The following is from memory when I opened
up the door panel on someone's '89 about one year ago:

I wanted to buy or make a speaker enclosure in the door pockets of the '87
to be like the '89.  I think if you bought the part below the arm rest
which screws to the door panel this would fit on your car without
too much trouble.
There is a hole in the door panel to allow the woofer to fit.  You would 
also have to cut the hole for the tweeter.  I didn't think that my MB Quart 
component speakers could be flush mounted in either the woofer or 
tweeter location.

My analysis of the situation was that I would have to cut the door panel
and would still have the 4x6 grilles, so I thought I should either:

a) buy '89 style door panels with the speakers and use the factory setup.
   (about $250 from boneyard)
b) permanantly modify my '87 panels to accept my Quart speakers.
c) buy good speakers for the 4x6 opening.

I did neither, and ended up buying the '89 951.  I haven't addressed
the sound system yet, but I doubt that the Quart speakers will fit.

The 2 speakers in the door pocket are pretty small!  Maybe a 3.5" woofer and
2" midrange.  I think the crossover is mounted in there as well.  It
is somewhat enclosed as far as the acoustic suspension of the speakers
is concerned, but is not air tight.

Do check out the 4x6 "plate" type speaker which I think was either a/d/s
or JBL.  It was about $150 ea. but it sounded great, with a 2" woofer
and a tiny tweeter.  Seems like it would be wimpy, but I was very impressed
with the sound for the size.

I guess it depends on what your preferences are for speakers.  The Porsche
stuff is pretty small for light weight I guess.  If you want "heavy duty"
sound quality, I think you must modify the door panels fairly extensively.

Sorry to disappoint you, but Porsche experimented with a FLAT 8, aircooled,
in the 914.  Built two of them in fact, one for Ferry Porsche, and one for
Piech. A derivative of a Porsche racing engine was used.

As a former owner of a V8 powered, mid-engine Corvair, I'm familiar with
hybrids.  Fun, but they make the purists cringe (ever seen a Corvair
purist?).  And decrease the value of the car, in general. I also have a
friend who built a Corvair powered 914.  Very fast, but it burnt to a crisp.
 So he built another; it did the same.  He then bought a 914-6; it did not
burn! But he had nightmares about it burning, so he sold it!

You do know the difference between a fairy tale and a war-story, don't you?
FTs start with:  Once upon a time; while WSs start with:
Snake Story follows (the captain has turned on the no-shit Light):

Now this is no-shit, it really happened to me (no-shit, it really did!)
A few years ago, I lived in Saigon (actually, it was Gia Dinh Province),
about a block before the Province Headquarters, on road from Tan Son Nhut 
airport to Highway 1, the famous Street without Joy (Rue dans joie).  I 
shared a very large, one story villa with some Vietnamese folks and a bunch 
of servants.  The villa had a large, sunny atrium in its center, and formed 
a large U around the atrium. A very large spacious living/dining room room, 
and then my suite (Bedroom/bathroom on the right of Bedroom) formed the left 
side; a very large bedroom that opened from the left side into the Living 
Room space, and from the back into the Kitchen, and with a barred, Glass-less 
window opening into the Atrium, formed the bottom of the U; and Store-room 
and several bedrooms formed the right side of the U.  The U was closed by 
a full height (about 14ft) extension of the front living space wall that ran 
across the front of the villa and became the forward wall of the right side 
bedrooms.

My Bedroom was entered from Living Room space and also connected to my 
private bath and then, strangely, one could pass thru my Bath directly into 
the (very large) kitchen.  The Kitchen also opened into the store room and
the bedroom facing out into the atrium.  The atrium was open to the sky.

Snake (as he/she/it was better known) came into my life one night when I was 
playing poker with some of my Army friends, in a group house where about
15 of them lived.  Someone mentioned that they had a *really* big snake for 
sale for $25MPC (Military Payment Certificates, supposedly unusable except
in military facilities.  Ohhh yeah.  available on the open market at $2MPC
to $1Green backs or, simply, Green).  Short version, Snake went home with me.

Folks, there were a *lot* of *small* people living in this villa, Madame
had a daughter about 6 (tiny), and the house-amah had a youngster about
the same age and size.  There were also assorted young girls ranging in age
from 11 to 18 belonging either to Madame or the amah; and total number of 
the number of people other than me, over 5 ft high was equal to the number 
of them sharing my enthusiasm for ol' Snake's company.  I'd guess, oh, say, 
Zero or less.

Well, Snake had just eaten the day or so before he became a guest, so 
he was on his best behavior, and everyone *reluctantly* agreed to give him
a chance.  During the days, Snake played inner-tube, curled up inside an
old truck tire out in the atrium.  BTW, you'd positively be AMAZED at how
LOUD a 98 inch python can hiss, and how PISSED-OFF even a good-humored one
can sound.  It'll definitely get your attention.  I also discovered that
it's not a good idea to kick the tire to see if he was asleep...I might add 
that I also proved that white boys *can too* jump...

In the evenings, I'd occasionally take Snake with me and we'd go strafing 
the bars.  Just before going in, I'd wrap ol' snake around my waist and
stroll in and take a seat.  As anyone who's been there will recall, these
were highly cultured places where gentlemen could go and meet ladies of 
refinement, and while away the hours in genteel conversation.  For those of 
you who missed the experience, picture this:  your basic bar is pretty much 
the same the world over, a long narrow, dark room with a bar running along 
one wall.  ItUs not uncommon to find feminine companionship already there in 
any part of the world, either.  In many parts of the world, (by no means 
universally so, however) sharing that companionship is optional.  Not the 
case in Saigon.  There, to enter a bar was to be virtually *engulfed* in a 
swarm of young lovelies, each greeting the newcomer in his native tongue, 
with the same cheery greeting (Hey Joe, you ver' han'some.  Where you come 
from in Uni' Stat?  You buy me one Saigon tea!)  

[Editor's note, serious mode ON:  IUm not demeaning Vietnamese women or 
the culture.  They spoke a hell of a lot more English that most of us spoke 
Vietmanese.  They were honest; it was tea at whiskey prices, but they never 
said it was anything *but* tea!  And, to their credit, they almost *Never* 
were prostitutes.  It was pretty much all good, clean fun, and everybody 
understood that.  serious mode OFF]   

This cheery companionship, however, definitely, was *not* optional.  If 
you wanted to get a beer and swap lies with your buddies without this 
companionship, you had to go somewhere other than a bar.  Unless, of course, 
you had a 98 inch python under your shirt, around your waist, and he stuck 
his head out to join the party.  That, my friends, would get you some 
serious *breathing* space; and right NOW!  You wouldnUt think that ladies 
that small could move that FAST.  I get tears in my eyes just thinking about 
it.  (...of course, IUm easily amused...)

But I digress (IUm also easily distracted).  Snake had been a member in 
good standing in my villa, for about a year.  Every two weeks, the cook 
would go to the market and buy a *large* white duck (10-15 lbs) for Snake 
(35-40 lbs), and when everyone was assembled in the bedroom pressed up to 
the window facing the atrium, the duck would be tossed out and introduced 
toSnake.  Sometimes the duck would go berserk and run around squawking its 
head off, and sometimes it would stand *very* still, trying to pretend it 
was a plant.  Always it became dinner.  Everyone in the house, except me 
and the duck, found this fascinating.  I watched the first time, but had 
no stomach for more.  [Hey, this is the stuff of life, not cruelty...
anyway, I AM getting to the point, keep your shirt on...]

Once Snake had suffocated the duck, heUd spend at least A half hour 
checking it over thoroughly for signs of life.  Then, heUd spend about the 
same amount of time fastidiously stretching the bird out in a straight line, 
grasping the bill in his mouth and maneuvering around until he got it just 
right.  Then heUd maneuver himself to approach the duck nose to beak, and 
start working the bird down his throat.  Pythons (hell, most all snakes) 
have a mouth full of inwardly-curving thin teeth (like fish-hooks w/o barbs).  
ItUs important to know this, as once food starts down that long journey, 
itUs  a *one* way trip.  No returns, No cancellations!  In fact, you may 
know that a number of large snakes die each year from starting to eat 
something too big to swallow.  I believe thatUs also why Snake took so 
long looking the duck over before starting to eat.  Snakes have a unique 
perspective on this *DonUt Bite off more than you can chew* business...

In those days, I spent about a week out of each 4 to 6 weeks split 
between Hong Kong and Bangkok.  I had a trip planned that would take me 
away over Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, so the Vietnamese planned to host 
a big, traditional family feast, with no round-eyes invited.  Now Snake 
was scheduled to do a duck about 10 days prior to my departure, but when 
introduced to the duck, this time Snake ignored it.  By the time I had to
leave, Snake and the duck (who had to be fed every day!) were like old 
married folks.  Snake ignored the duck, and the duck ignored snake.  I 
worried about SnakeUs health, but had to leave on schedule.  Something 
unexpected happened and I had to return to Saigon early, after being gone 
only 3 days.  I arrived home about 5:00 pm the day before the big event
and agreed to accommodate the Vietnamese folks by either leaving and 
staying gone all day the next day, or by keeping to my quarters all day 
while the celebration took place.  Snake, meanwhile, still hadnUt eaten 
in my absence.  

My return however, was accompanied by SnakeUs appetite, and he immediately 
commenced to make dinner out of one very large, surprised, duck.  

Now normally, this would result in a very lethargic snake with a *very* 
large football shaped lump about a foot or so down from his head; and 
*total* disinterest in food for *at least* the next week or more.  This 
seemingly happy turn of events was completed just minutes before the cook 
arrived with 5 live chickens for the next days festivities.  Seeing Snake 
in his well-fed stupor, she put the chickens out in the atrium with him and 
started on the other kitchen preparations.  I took my shower.  Just after I 
stepped out of the shower and into my bedroom, the most horrible, god-awfull 
commotion started.  It sounded like it started to be a riot, and blossomed 
into utter chaos.  In a span of about 15 seconds.  I mean, thereUs just no 
*way* to adequately describe the utter pandemonium; yelling, screaming, 
hollering and shrieking; but it sounded like, as a bare minimum, the VC had 
picked the atrium as the launch-site for a new offensive!  Honestly fearing 
this to be the case, I tightened the towel around my waist, grabbed my 
.45 cal grease-gun and my flack-vest, threw open the door from bathroom to 
the kitchen, and dashed across into the bedroom facing the atrium, expecting 
to meet the worst.

Boy and Girls, my eyes beheld the most wondrous sight this old soldier ever 
expects to see, if I live another 7 lifetimes!  Snake, it seems, had 
developed a *tad* more appetite than heUd let on up to that point, and the 
presence of those chickens in his living space was a temptation he never 
even *thought* about resisting.  Before anyone knew what he was up to, heUd 
snared one of the chickens and promptly dispatched it.  The other four 
chickens, who had been pretty quiet up to that point, began to get 
seriously agitated, leaping up into the air, running here and there, 
screeching, squawking, flapping their wings, generally disturbing the 
peace and declaring the end of the world as we knew it, to be at hand. 
 
This was all it took to incite the whole household of humans to riot; or at 
least to show their solidarity with the chickens by emulating them, running 
in all directions, shrieking, waving their arms in the air, and I donUt 
know what-all.  Four chickens can make a fair amount of racket on their own 
when they put their minds to it.  Add in, ohhhh, say, 7 to 10 small females, 
ranging in age from 6 to 50, each trying to out-panic/shriek the others, 
and the chickens...Bliss!

Snake, meanwhile, ignoring the live chickens, and other distractions, 
started to swallow his dessert.  Did I mention that this is not a reversible 
process?  Maybe I forgot to explain that to the cook, who was squatting on 
the tiles, tugging on that chicken with all her might, engaged in a *serious* 
contest with a *very* BIG, and (must I add) NOT very amused, reptile who had 
the back half of a large chicken sticking out of his mouth.  In the meantime, 
all the other occupants, chickens, humans, probably a Martian or two, (who 
could tell) went on, raising merry hell.  Just about the time I had to put 
the grease-gun down (lest, in my convulsions, I shoot myself); and as I was 
thinking to my self that NOTHING could possibly be *this* funny, one of the 
most-active chickens in the group, (probably the ring-leader) expired of 
fright/excitement and fell to the tiles with a thud.  I probably led you to 
believe that the noise level was as loud;  and lunacy was intense, as they 
could possibly be.  Not a chance.  The death of that second chicken whipped 
that hysterical bunch into a truly impressive frenzy, and yet, above it, all 
came the angry screams of the cook, and olU Snake snortinU like a 
bull-18-wheeler in heat.  That nite, Snake (who won the tug-of-war 
eventually) got his walking papers.  Something was said about a unanimous 
concern that a couple of the smaller girls werenUt much, if any, bigger 
than a large duck and a large chicken.   Whew!!!  I woke my wife in the 
middle of the night last night, shaking the bed with laughter as I relived 
it.  I know IUll never see or experience anything that funny as long as I 
live, and itUs a damn good thing; IUd never survive it!

	I agree.  If having more than two seats disqualifies a car from beint a
"true" sportscar in your book, then the McLauren F1 is not a true 
sportscar.  Gee, that's a shame.  I guess you think the F1 is at a
disadvantage over your car because it has 3 seats, huh?  Sorry, I'll put my
bets on the McLauren!  Also, the Ferrari 456 has 4 seats.  0-60 in 5.2
(Automobile Magazine).  It goes 186 (I think).  Your car may be quicker, but
I'll lay odds that you can't go 186+.

> There are a lot of high performance sports cars that have less than
> 300 HP.

	The Acura NSX has 270 hp, as well as the 993!  Both of which would
probably outhandle your car pretty easily!  Their 168mph top speed is not
too shabby, either.  Mazda RX-7 has 255...  'nuff said?

First, Pete, thanks for the reply and the repost about the p-valve.

I bought the car with standard (seemingly almost-new) rotors and unknown
pads. Braking from any speed behind another vehicle was, well, terrifying.
The brakes' efficacy was poor (through straight), and the pads never, EVER
grabbed - just a single, constant, weak deceleration, a bit like having
only rear brakes.

If you've had MetalMasters, you're probably aware of how they are quite
poor when cold, but do grab quite well when hot. So, for example, if you're
hillclimbing, haven't used the brakes for a while, and then suddenly have
to brake, the first second or so is quite scary, but then they do grab, and
they grab quite well. Also, they throw very little brake dust and they're
easy to clean. 

Ferodos are different - they grab IMMEDIATELY, and that's what I like about
them. They throw a lot more dust, and I think some of my Hartge wheels
(BMW) were damaged by my waiting too long to clean them. So beware. Note
that I'm talking about their _street_ pads - their race pads are well known
to be quite good for _racing_, and there are plenty of other good race
pads, too.

I can't comment on pad life - I seem to always start looking for better
brakes before my pads wear out. As to locking the front brakes, strangely I
can't do it all the time - maybe 60-70% of the time, at best.

As to the drilled rotors, my only comment so far is that they are quite
loud, all the time.  If you cut off the engine and coast down the road you
can definitely hear the pads brushing (I think scraping is too hard a term)
the disks.  This may be good, this may be bad, I don't know. I know that
this is _not_ due to improperly adjusted brakes, as it happens on my other
cars with the same setup. I black-zinc plate all new rotors to avoid rust,
especially prevalent on drilled and vented rotors.

Blaine at Troutman urged me to try this setup before going for bigger
calipers. Apart from the excessive travel, my gut feeling is that this is
the best this car will do. This is unfortunate, because I absolutely hate
the lack of a solid pedal. And I probably will adjust the p-valve to see if
that helps matters.

Hope this helps,

Subject: MIG welders that aren't

Hi, Thom.
 
Folks should be aware that there are TWO Lincoln 100 welders out there on
the market. I don't believe the Home Depot one can be converted to MIG; it
relies on flux core wire. Flux core is OK for farm implement repair, maybe
some stuff on the underside of a car, but it CANNOT be used for bodywork.
The true Lincoln Idealarc SP-100, which is MIG-capable, costs about $200
more. By the time you're done, you will be in it for about $700 (gas
regulator, CO2/Ar bottle, line).
 
Flux core is not OK because no matter what you do, you have a dirty weld
just waiting to corrode up through the paint. This is the same reason
brazing is not a good idea on car bodies except as a last resort, followed
by another sandblast to try to get all the flux off.
 
The Home Depot flux core welder also has I think only 4 detents for the
voltage and speed knobs, and when welding thin stuff like body sheet metal
you often find yourself between two settings. The $500 Lincoln has
continuously variable controls.
 
The really cool way to weld is with a TIG torch (Miller Synchrowave is
everybody's current Jones.) That's several thousand dollars but you can weld
ANYTHING with it. Well, almost.

If you have problems with the CIS system, then buy yourself a PEFI system
and program your own fuel injection with a laptop!  Webers or any other carbs 
for that matter are a waste of time and money, as they will never be able to 
match the efficiency of fuel injection (horsepower, mileage, etc.).
     
Better yet, see if you can get ahold of the schematics of a Supercup brain 
box and a Supercup intake plenum/manifold.  It will be expensive, but it will 
*bury* those girly-man Webers if you can use that as your induction system.

Subject: Re: camshafts-why webers

You're certainly right about the general advantage of fuel injection over 
ancient carbs. But the cis system is pretty tame! In my case (putting the 
engine in a 914) I wanted the original look of the 914/6's which were all 
carb cars. Also, the cis unit doesn't quite fit under the 914 engine 
compartment without cutting the rear wall in the back of the engine 
compartment. The carbs also have better response than the cis. None of 
this probably applies to the later Motronic Carreras.

Subject: Re: Stealth Driving... Calibrate your speedo!

One thing you ought to know is what your real speed is, not necessarily 
what your speedometer says. This is also a good tip for you rally folk 
since the odometer and speedometer errors are usually different. Next 
time you are on a road with mile markers, take along a stop watch and 
time yourself over several miles keeping you speed as constant as 
possible. Divide the average time to travel one mile into 3600 and you 
will have the actual speed in miles per hour. For example, at 65 mph it 
should take you 55.4 seconds to travel one mile. My 911 reads 75 at 65 
(partially due to tire size). Don't be surprised if your's is off too.

I'll double that, the importance of variable voltage and feed controllers 
are for real. I'm considering stepping up to a 200AMP industrial quality 
welding machine. Even if pro's say that the 'big' machines are easier to 
learn welding on, I found it hard enough to find the correct feed/voltage 
combination on my 130A welding machine (4voltage settings, fully variable 
feed) to begin with. After three digit hours (4?) experience with welding I 
feel ready for a new machine with more capabilities.

This is definitely *the* thing, over here we get good quality combination 
machines for about $1k. Experienced welder and a TIG machine will make so 
beautiful welds you wont have hearth to grind it afterwards. 

I think most of you US guys should consider importing a machine from Europe, 
it is 'way cheaper'.... Ex: the LUNA 150 (made in Sweden, almost Industrial 
quality) is about $300 including VAT. For export they don't charge VAT, but 
shipping costs should be investigated.....

I think the 914 is a True Porsche,.....the success and the popularity of the 
MR2 is perhaps one of the proofs to the fact that the 914 is both a splendid 
concept and launched 15 years too early......... :(

I also like the ideas of changing engine, suspension and drivetrain 
components in cars. It's been quite popular to install V8's in Lada, VW and 
Volvos 'cross the pond. Sleepers that really goes off like rockets in the

If you really want to have a different 914 you should consider installing 
the V8 engine from Tatra. All alloy, air cooled animal. As I remeber we're 
talking (D)OHC air cooled engine here! It sounds 'orgasmic', cannot describe 
it in words. The Tatra is really a strange (in a nice way) car, if you like 
Porsche you might as well like the Tatra.

 Don't forget that VW Beetles (like 356's,914's and others maybe) have no
external oil hoses to worry about. Therefore, you never dump the oil, and
hence don't have to put it back in. Still, the times are pretty
impressive. As for an engine running without oil, the only engine-blow I
have seen was an old VW 1200 with the throttle wired open and no oil. It
lasted about 6-7 minutes before a conrod decided to make a sunroof in the
top of the case! A one inch square piece of magnesium was launched about
thirty feet into the air. All this, without Duralube no less...

Subject: 944S suspension and water questions

Greetings All,

I am having a couple of minor problems with my '87 944S.

1) A intermittent small clunk when I steer.  Only happens when there is 
   a strong side load on the steering, doesn't happen in slow easy corners.
   Seems to be comming from the drivers side strut area.  Could it be the
   top strut bearing or is it more likely to be a ball joint, tie rod or
   something in the steering box?

2) I seem to be loosing a small amount of coolant.  The level drops very
   slowly in the overflow tank. I add maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a cup a month to 
   keep a constant level in the tank.  I can find no signs of a leak from 
   any hoses or from around the water pump.  Any ideas on where the coolant
   is going?  Bad head gasket?  Should I worry about this small coolant loss?

Any ideas are greatly apriciated.

I've been restoring the targa top on my '78 SC for the past 8 months (those

powdercoated the trim and targa bar cover, replaced the door panel backings,
and updated to the latest seal configuration. I'm to the point where I'm
ready to glue the seals in and thats the problem. Test fitting shows me that
perhaps I'm over my head. They dont seem to be fitting as well as I'd hoped
when I plunked down the cash. Since doing this right  probably requires a
steep learning curve, and I'd really like to be able to drive this thing in

>Folks should be aware that there are TWO Lincoln 100 welders out there on

The documentation for my welder states that it can (for a price) be 
adapted to MIG.  In the store where I bought it, they had the MIG conversion
kit, which ran about $85.

I haven't seen anything wrong with the welds I've been making.  While some
of the early ones I did were kinda questionable, thats what practice is all
about.  I can do nice even, good looking welds, and I do not question
their integrity.

While one of those high buck welders would be bitchen to have, I think
it kinda defeats the purpose, since if I had that much cash, I would probably
have someone do the work for me.  But for right now I'm trying to get my
VW bus back amongst the living, along with school, and I don't have the cash
to set up the most awesome shop (see previous thread)

I used my 'little' welder to put the sunroof in my bus, which was quite a lot
of bead, and I welded both the top and bottom of the seam, as well as some
suppports, and have been driving it around for a while now (3 months) and have 
not seen any cracks or deformations.

It also doesn't make sense to buy a welder that costs more than the vehicle
(in my case) I bought it for will ever be worth.

Why do I have the feeling I've been Tedded?  (akin to being Bjorked, I'm sure)

I have 4 stops for voltage but variable wire speed.  For the sheet metal
I'm welding (16-20 guage) The lowest setting has been great and when I 
welded some supports with 1/8" steel I used the next one up, with great
results. 

Its not the size of the tool, its how you use it!  M'angelo coulda painted
the Sistine Chapel with Crayolas if he'd wanted to!

The difference between the two model 100 Licoln welders is the capacity and
the outlet type they use.  The 100 uses standard 110, but has a lower duty
cycle.  The 125 has a higher duty cycle, but requires 220.  For
my purposes, I work well within the duty cycle of my model 100.  If I was
trying to weld for a living, then I would use a better machine, in the same
fashion if you were moving furniture for a living you would buy a big truck,
likewise you use a station wagon for a trip to the beach.  It makes no sense 
to take the Big Truck to the beach.

Ok, so I'm digressing with my metaphores, here.  Sorry!

I guess I can sum it up that I am happy with my welder and see no reason to
invest my life savings in a profession grade model at this time.  I made my
recommendation based on my what I knew and in the spirit of maybe showing
a possible option.  I in no way intended that to mean I was some STUD WELDER
and my advice was gospel (see "questioning Stan" thread).

So, if we are finished here, I am going to get back to work on my bus.  And
when I'm done with that, I'll use the welder on my 911, so there! (Ok, so I
don't have anything to weld on it, but someday I'll find something, like
flares!)

BTW - while we're on the topic of welding, I saw in the Eastwood catalog the
cool little clamps to use for butt-welding - they go between the pieces and
clamp on the flat surfaces.

Getting a laptop these days sure is easy. But let's keep a little realism 
in the discussion. No one doubts (I think) that pfi would be superior to 
cis or carbs. But to think you just bolt on some third party parts for a 
couple of hundred bucks and reprogram the entire injection settings (why 
not redo the spark advance too while you're at it) is a little naiive. 
I'm an electrical engineer who works with several mechanical engineers 
who all agree the theory is great. But making it work properly and 
economically isn't so easy.
When the system is ready to go, I'll be one of the first out there with 
my laptop and software. Until then, I'll stick with what I know works. If 
that is a "girly man" Weber setup (such as you see on most of the M3, M4,

Currently the engine gives around 240 hp with a 90mm (3.5")

measured the car right before and right after. The chip gave around
5 hp).

I've talked to my Porsche shop and we've agreed there are basically
two ways to go:

1 - Turbo/compressor. This could give anything from 300 to 500 hp
    depending on how much I'll spend on the solution.

2 - Conventional tuning. This could include anything from new cams to
    cylinder/piston kits, injection etc.

I would like to get around 300 hp from the engine. But I'm not that 
keen on turbo/compressor for several reasons:

1 - It's pretty hard on the engine, unless you completely rebuild the
    sucker with stronger components, which is VERY expensive.

2 - I'm a bit concerned about fuel-consumption. Since I drive around 20k
    miles in the car every year and fuel costs $0.95 per litre (=$3.61
    per US-gallon)

3 - I _might_ get into big trouble with the danish customs, if they 
    claim the car has changed identity. (No, I don't want to elaborate 
    here, since this is a long and complicated explanation)

So I've agreed with my shop, that conventional tuning is the way to go.

I was thinking in the lines of a 3.6ltr kit with the necessary prepa-
ration of the gaskets and (if needed) the core. Furthermore I'd put
in SC RS cams to complete the job. (I'm quoted a price of $4200 inclu-
ding everything except the cams for the 3.6ltr job and $1300 for the
SC RS cams).

My problem is this: What about the Motronic? My guess is, that it needs
some kind of modification to properly take advantage of the larger
displacement. Can the a 3.6ltr Motronic box be used with single
ignition?

Another question: How about the Mass Flow Sensor kits I've seen some
adds for. FVD-Brombacher in Germany has one, that (they claim) gives 
a normal 3.2ltr 258hp and a 3.6ltr (twin-ignition) 300hp. Has anyone 
tried these kits? I'm (more than) a little skeptical here.

This got pretty long, but any advise on the subject would be greatly
appreciated, since I'd like to get the project off the ground some
time during the next couple of weeks.

Regards,

Christian

Subject: Questions: 914 2. performance

I had a few questions concerning an engine that I am planning to build.  I
was planning on using a 2.0l engine as a base and adding a stroked crank
(forged/counter bal)  and a set of 94x82 forged pistons.  I was planning
on using 40mm Dells/Webers, a new camshaft and hydraulic lifters.

What are the advantages of hydraulic lifters, just longer adjustment
intervals?  

Can anyone recommend valve sizes?  Should I go with larger valves, say
44 and 37.5 or stick with the stock size?

Will the engine need aux. cooling?  Either a 911 shroud or another oil
cooler?  I was planning on adding a deep sump and a heavy volume oil pump.

Exhaust?  Any recommendations?  I was thinking headers, but I would like
to retain the heater boxes and I doubt they would make that much of a
difference on this engine.  If I went with headers, I was planning on a
Flowmaster 3 chamber(street use).

How much better acceleration could I gain by lightening the flywheel? 
Would this help this "torquey" engine or hurt it?

 If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please let me know.

Subject: Driver's Ed: Roebling Road (Savannah GA): 17-18 sep

Will any other Porschephiles be attending the upcoming Driver's Ed this
coming weekend at Roebling Road?  When I talked to Bob last week, the
event was under registered, so it may still be possible to get in even
at this late date.

Contact info: Bob Linville (904)272-6064 (8-10 EST evenings).

If you've never driven it, Roebling is a great track: very challenging
even to long time drivers, yet safe (lots of run off). A great track for
a first time track experience.  Here's a "hot lap" description I wrote
up for the WheelToWheel mailing list a while back:


- ------------------------------------------------
A Hot Lap of Roebling Road, Savannah Georgia

I've been a lurker on this list for some time (with an occasional post
to get free advise about roll bars and car prep).  I don't race, but
have become an avid track junkie, driving about 10 PCA/BMW driving
schools a year. Here's a description of my latest line at Roebling.
Note that I say `latest'. Everyone seems to have a different (and
usually strong!)  opinion about the `right' way to drive Roebling Road
(unlike Road Atlanta where I do the majority of my driving: at Road
Atlanta, there's a generally accepted correct line with very minor
variations). The following line works well for me in a stock Porsche 944
turbo.

As you can see from the above crude ASCII sketch, Roebling is one
continuous turn with a medium length straight (~3000 feet).  It's a
2.0 mile course with no significant elevation changes (the front
straight is a slight uphill which tends to limit terminal velocity at
the end of the straight, but for all practical purposes, it's a flat
track).  It looks deceptively easy, but it's actually very challenging.
I enjoy driving here almost as much as Road Atlanta.

Turns 1 and 2 constitute a decreasing radius turn that is (at least for
me), the hardest to do well (I _always_ overbrake at the entrance to
1...). As you approach the end of the straight, you must resist the urge
to slow down too much. The best drivers turn turn 1 into a series of
about 3 straight braking segments: At the braking zone for 1, ease the
car towards the right side of the track and downshift from 5th to 4th.
About a third of the way through the turn, straighten out the wheel and
brake a little more, then continue the turn, straighten out and brake
again at the apex, continue the turn and let the car come out to the
outside of the track. Brake and downshift to 3rd and turn in to turn 2.
Take a very late apex in 2: I use the second set of rumble strips. In
order to apex correctly, you must wait to turn in until you've almost
run out of track.  If you do it right, you'll be able to be at full
throttle well before the apex and you'll exit 2 very fast.  I upshift to
4th fairly quickly.

Ease the car to the right side of the track for entry to turn 3, a fast
left hand sweeper. I usually lift a bit before turning in, but I think
that's more for my piece of mind than for car control: this turn can be
taken flat out (what a trip!).  If you stay wide for the first half of
the turn (apex at the end of the rumble strips and then just stay on the
lefthand side of the track), you'll be set up on the left side of the
track for a quick brake/downshift to 3rd for turn 4.

Turn 4 is a constant radius, medium speed turn.  Stay about 2/3's to the
outside of the track for the first half of the turn, then when you can
see the apex (end of the rumble strip), turn in tighter and mash the
throttle: this straightens out the short chute between 4 and 5. Aim the
car at the left side of the track: don't try to get to the right side of
the track to set up for turn 5.

This brings us to turn 5: a decreasing radius left-hander. There are as
many opinions about the correct line through here as there are drivers.
Everyone agrees, however, that there's no quick way through it... Here's
what I've been doing lately, and it seems to work better than previous
variations: As I said above: when you exit from 4, aim for the left side
of the track. Once there, tap the brakes and ease the car a little
further left: head for the patch of grass (about 10 feet long) between
two similarly sized patches of sand. Brake hard just before you run out
of track and throw (smoothly :-)) the car into a lefthanded drift.  You
must apex turn 5 very late: I use the end of the second rumble strip. If
you've gauged this right, you'll exit by barely kissing the rumble
strips on the far side of the track.  Let the turn continue to bring you
back to the left side of the track for turn in to 6.

Turns 6 and 7 are really just one constant radius turn. Enter about
2/3's on the outside of the track: Careful: Turn 6 is off camber, so
keep the speed under control. Stay out wide until you can see the apex
(another conveniently placed rumble strip!), then turn in tighter and
start feeding power. I'm at full throttle by the apex and shift to 4th
at track out. 6/7 is a critical turn since it leads to very fast
righthanded sweeper 8/9 which leads onto the front straight. I'm told
that the short chute between 7 and 8 is where all the race-critical
passing is done in wheel to wheel racing.

8 and 9 are really one long, very fast right handed sweeper. Apex late,
after pit entry at the far end of the second set of rumble strips. If
you have the courage, you'll be feeding throttle throughout the turn and
flat out by the time you pass pit entry. I exit 9 at about 102mph (and I
don't have a particularly high courage factor).

As you zoom down the straight, repeat over and over to yourself: "I
don't need to brake nearly so much for turn 1", "I don't need to brake
nearly so much for turn 1", ...

Hey,

I don't think Pete Zimmerman intended to insult owners of 72
911Ts or people with 2.7s in their cars.  His book is written
from the perspective of educating someone looking to buy  
used 911.  *Many* people in the market for a 911 don't know
anything about the myriad of idiosyncasies associated with the various model
years.  There is nothing inherently wrong with a 72 911T or a 2.7l engine
(IMO), as long as you have made
an *educated* decision to purchase one of these and know what
to expect from your purchase.  I think his book is great, but it
is aimed at a less educated audience than pfiles.  What would
you tell a friend who asks for your well-respected opinion on a
75 911 with a 125k mile 2.7l leaking oil like seive and a
weird exhaust leak?  That's what I thought.

This is an EXCELLENT point. If we could round up some support

in-line resistor I've been looking for is P/N 039.971.762A, and 2) there is
also a stand-off of sorts, P/N 022.133.079. 

I will go ahead and get both of these and report back when I'm happy with
my 2.0. Right now it starts instantly, but I have to "massage" the pedal to
keep it running for the first 60 seconds, after which it continues to hunt
noticeably when cold. Even when it's warm it hunts, but at a much lower
frequency. The FI box adjuster is set to the middle position.

I hope EC got the part numbers right ...

Not possible. Probably a wide-body with a Weberized engine.

If the car was still blown (assuming it EVER had been), and done correctly, 
you'd either have one hummin' big carb at the inlet to the turbo or *BIG* 
cans that completely enclosed the carbs over the cylinders.

Again, not your average do it at home project.

Hi all,
All this 914 brake stuff is great! I have a dream with my 914. I want it to
become a 914-6 but can afford to go all the way yet. So I am doing it in
steps. When something goes wrong upgrade it. Anyway, I just finished
installing 911 brakes on the 914. WOW!! Pedal feels fantastic and when you
push on the brakes hard I get thrown against the seat belts hard! I love
it. Upgrading feels so good. Now a few questions. One the upgrade was done
without adjusting the brake regulator, so the fronts lock before the rears.
IS it worth risking the 20+ year old regulator leaking after it is ajusted
or not (The car is realy hauling itsels down when the front tirers start to
lock). After discovering this I noticed the oil light came on and stayed on
for a good 10 sec. Oil level was almost full. I asume this doesn't really
matter on the street because a won't be braking like this all that often,
but if wrong would like to be corrected.
Thanks
Nick

OK, that's cool. But you didn't give my any information. What are you

If so, *WHAT* competition...

There are several *DISADVANTAGES*, mainly having to do with premature
failure seen in high-rev engines and the prospect of someone, being
helpful of course, adjusting the valves as though they were mechanical
lifters. Don't tell me it can't happen, I've seen it.

Yes! An aux oil cooler, an Accusump, and a Melling high-volume oil pump
to drive all of it. No deep sumps, please -- the Accusump does an
infinitely better job at not too much more cost.

If you doubt the headers would make any difference on an engine with that
much different internals and intake, you really, really, really need
to pay attention to this note. You *WILL* need a much bigger exhaust if
you increase the displacement. Yes, this means you give up the heat
exchangers, but there are ways around that. You'll basicly have to
engineer an exhaust that works. Your best bet will be a SuperTrapp because
that's at least tunable for backpressure.

Hi John,

I'm having my whole car painted as a result of vandalism ('83 Targa).  I'm 
replacing ALL of my seals and like you, I'm worried about the outcome.  There is
a factory bulletin that you *must* get titled, "911: Sealing of Targa, Cabriolet
and Coupe".  There, the factory describes how to re-seal your car the right way.
It also recommends adhesives and sealants.  I believe the only way to get this 
is through a dealer.  If after reading this you're still not confident (and I 
can't blame you), then have a shop do it.  I know of one guy who will take the 
time to do this kind of job but its not the sort of thing he does all the time. 
If you want, I'll give you his shop number offline.

I had my top recovered by Autos International (only satisfactory quality) and 
replaced the side seals myself.  I'm about to install my windshield frame top 
seal and targa bar seal like you, and I'm going to do it per the factory 
bulletin using Wurth Rubber Glue.  Wish me luck!

Subject: targa top woes
     
I've been restoring the targa top on my '78 SC for the past 8 months (those 
seals are expensive!). This simple project turned somewhat complex as I 
powdercoated the trim and targa bar cover, replaced the door panel backings, 
and updated to the latest seal configuration. I'm to the point where I'm 
ready to glue the seals in and thats the problem. Test fitting shows me that 
perhaps I'm over my head. They dont seem to be fitting as well as I'd hoped 
when I plunked down the cash. Since doing this right  probably requires a 
steep learning curve, and I'd really like to be able to drive this thing in 
the rain (always right around the corner here in Savannah, Ga), I need some 
help. Is there a shop in this corner of the country (Im willing to drive a 
bit) that someone has had good luck with? I,m sure most anyone will take my 
money claiming they can glue in seals but I'm looking for someone with 
experience that can do a professional job. Is there anyone out there who has 
done the job themselves that can send along a few tips? This is my first 
message so I hope I've done it right! Thanks a bunch

Subject: 356 open cars

I have had my search going on for a super original or near original restored
Cor SC coupe going on for a while. As of yet, I haven't found that just
perfect car. However, this past weekend , I've decided to expand my search to
an open car for a few reasons: first, this type of car would be a better
investment, it seems more effort is being put in to keep original or the
better  restored cars in the open ones ,and top down driving is kind of
exciting.
Any thought on this type of purchase? Would I be better off looking at
roadsters or D converts with their drum brakes? I planning on Sunday drives
and across country meets with my 356. 
Anyone know of a real nice open car that might go up for sale?
It seems that when I have advertised, some of the people answering have been
real356ers with an honest interest in promoting the 356 cult. However, so
many others have offered me cars of much lesser quality that they are trying
to peddle. I don't know that much about these cars yet, but I do know,
        " buyer be beware", there's a nightmare waiting in some of these
"restored" cars.

Several times on the P-Files Porsche's in movies has been discussed.
What about Porsche's advertising spots on TV?  Have there ever been 
commercials featuring the 944 series,  particularly the 951? I
remember seeing a spot that starts with a camera view from the drivers 
perspective.The P-car is driving quickly down a winding road (with great
sound effects) when the voice over states " If you could be car, what 
car would you want to be? Of course you would be:  A Porsche!  At that 
instant, for the first time the car is revealed, it appears on the road 
facing the camera. Was this a 951? Anybody remember the commercials, 
that appeared on network TV in the mid 80's ?

Well, it's *cheaper* to try it and see... take the car down to a carwash,
use the high-pressure washer to get the area around the prop valve really,
really clean, then adjust it. Bleed per Jim Pasha's instructions, then
drive it. Check it frequently to see if it's leaking If it is, then I'd
recommend a vernier prop valve such as the JFZ unit. It's not nearly as
sexy as the Tilton four-detent adjust-as-you-drive unit, but unless you're
driving in competition with races long enough for that particular adjustment
to MATTER, the other type is better. Not to mention cheaper.

Oh -- on adjusting the valve. I go out to a skidpad (or something I can
use like a skidpad) and once the car and brakes are warmed up, get up
some speed then stand on the brake. Adjust the valve until you lock the
front and rear at roughly the same time, although I like to lock the
fronts slightly before the rears. Then put some of the green Locktite 
(for fasteners already in place) on the vernier, and you're done.

This is *NOT* good. It is consistent with what I see on a stock 2.0 using
better pads and sticky tires, though. There's only one *REAL* answer: a
an Accusump. Oh, sure you *COULD* install a dry sump, but that's a whole
engine rebuild and about $2500 in extra parts from where you are now...
Thus, I cannot recommend highly enough that you install an Accusump. It'll 
be the best few hundred dollars you can spend on the car. 

Get a 3 quart unit with the electric valve, and the necessary plumbing.
If you want to save money, use the blue fabric covered Aeroquip rubber
hose and barbed push-on fittings; the black "oil hose" you find at
parts stores doesn't have enough heat or pressure rating for the job
and trust me, blowing that hose is *NOT* a fun way to start your day...

When in the U.S. in 1987 (I think, or was it the 1989 trip?)
on network TV was an incredible Porsche ad. A 944 or 951 was
sliding sideways (controlled!) the whole ad with billows of tyre
smoke trailing behind and a heavy metal soundtrack. At the end just
a single title screen with something like "Porsche: there is no substitute",
or words to that effect. I was amazed the safe driving people didn't
kick up a stink about it!

I loved the ad, but can someone straighten out the details?

Subject: exporting 911s to Japan

Yesterday, at my local Kinokinuya bookstore in San Jose, I came across a 
book called "Porsche for $10,000" actually Porsche for 1 mil yen which is 
equiv., title and book are in Nihongo.  It covers only the real Porsches, 
no water pumpers, no 356s.

It shows prices of Calif. older porsches and highlights many dealers and 
used car lots in LA, several pages on AASE bros.

I have some interesting ideas for exporting 911s to Japan if any 
interested investors are out there, email me...

Ted

Remember, that the yen is at an all-time high against the green back, 
since WW2, Japanese are used to paying $50,000 to $180,000 for Porsches, 
so there's a potential market for exports of used 911s there.  The 
Japanese recognize quality, and are very interested in early quality 
American and German made products.

Well, ummm, ahhhh... I can't speak about Porsches from experience, but I
can about VW Beetles, in which the front seat is not only a *possible* 
location, but one positively conducive to the Obvious.  A Porsche Front Seat 
shouldn't present all that much difficulty...

But one wonders, why?  The best use of a Porsche front (or, for that matter, 
*any* automotive) seat being to (rapidly) transport consenting adults to a 
more comfortable environment...

This kind of reminds me of the Austrailian boy from the Out-Back, whose

took my observation above to heart and promised to introduce him to sex if 
he'd like, and, as he was agreeable, transported him to her appartment in
her 1.7 Liter 914.  Inside, she told him to make himself comfortable while
she *freshened-up*.  Five minutes later, she returned to the living room to
find all the furniture against one wall, and the rug rolled up against the

John,

Yes Denver and most of the front range in Colorado has a smog check. This
is due to the "Brown Cloud" that occurs during the colder winter months
from Temperature Inversions. Currently the test consists of a visual
check for smog hardware and then the tailpipe test. I believe in the 
next couple of years they are going to require testing on a dyno.

Just to add a little personal experience to the discussion.  I have braided 
line on my VW Jetta and had one burst while my wife was driving to work.  
Luckily she knew what was happening and safely pulled to the side of the road.  
Prior to that incident I never thought that the braided line would be less 
durable than the stock lines.   I have since replaced all the line with new 
braided lines.  I like the improved pedal feel they provide and the Jetta needs 
all the help it can get.   
As for my 944S, I like that brakes as they are and I will maintain them in 
stock form.

While at the Diablo Region Concours/Swap Meet yesterday, we all noted 
that Ted was missing.

What he was missing couldn't be determined. Try as we did we could not
find Ted. So here's the report:

Missing: Ted Matsumura; AKA Baka, Village Idiot, Dumb S***, etc.

Noteable features: Walks around with head up arse.

Favorite recreation: Curb surfing with a S*** brown 911

Stature: Less than whale S***.

We took up a collection, if we had a picture we could put it on a milk
carton. 

Ted, wherever you are, please make an appearance at the autocross on 
the 18th so we can be assured that you really are okay (or normal which
isn't).

 Dear P-philes:

 I apologize for all the problems I unintentionally caused when, in an early
 morning pre-coffee haze, I sent a .gif to the entire list that was supposed
 to be pointed only to Stan. I am well aware of list etiquette and did this
 through stupidity rather than ignorance.

 Thank you to all those who pointed out the error of my ways in a restrained

 Well I'm going over and sit in the corner with Ted for awhile...

     My 914 has a six in it that I call "Frankenstein". It was built up by 
the
     previous owner. It has a 2l case from a 67 911S, it has been upgraded
     with piston squirters. It has 2.7 pistons and 2.4 shaved heads. It also
     has Webers. It also as a Tilton aluminum flywheel. Would this
     flywheel be below 11-12 lbs? If so, should I remove it? What are the
     problems that a lightened flywheel causes? I haven't raced the car
     yet, although I would like to do some Auto-X and SCCA stuff in the
     future when I get the thing running properly.

Subject: 914 with flat 8

There is a decent German book on the 914, entitled "Das Grosse VW-Porsche
Buch" by Michael von Klodt, Heel-Verlag, 1989. Price 78 DM. It will probably
never be translated into English (I tried to get some publishers interested
in it) because it's too expensive to produce, and they feel 914 people don't
buy books. The book is about 10 x 13, 200 pages.
 
Anyway, it has a chapter on a fellow named Raymond Wagner and his
928-powered 914. There is something on a Rod Simpson and a 289-powered
914.
 
The car with the racing flat-8 was known as the 914 S. Two were built, one
for Ferdinand Piech and one as a 60th birthday present for Ferry Porsche. The
Piech car, with more power, is supposedly in the factory museum. I suspect
the other car is in the warehouse, where all the prototypes and clay models
and such are stored away. The three-liter engine had 300 hp, good for 155 mph
with a street exhaust.

Subject: Autobahn

Hi, Herb.
 
All your reminiscences about driving in Germany almost makes me want to go
back. But noooo... one too quickly forgets the lousy weather, and the
bureaucracy, and the fact that only about 30 percent of the Autobahn is
actually unlimited. The rest is generally 120 km/h (75 mph) or 100 (62 mph)
or even less in the ever-present construction zones. I can actually average
better speeds in the U.S. than I can on a German Autobahn clogged with
summer tourists heading for Italy.
 
The one thing that sticks in my mind about driving a Porsche flat-out is
that you start thinking on a different plane. Things actually seem to happen
slower because you are thinking way ahead of the car. You develop a feel for
when some guy not paying attention is going to pull into the left lane. You
look for Dutch license plates (nothing against the Dutch, but in the summer,
they clog the Autobahnen heading for Italy, and they're just not used to the
speed.) And yes, you look for U.S. military POV (privately owned vehicle)
plates. They often can't drive either, until they've been frightened out of
their wits a time or two. You get some idea of whether to flash your lights
for that Trabant a half mile ahead or not. (When the wall came down, there
was a sudden increase in accidents as all the Trabis and Wartburgs came
west).
 
Driving on the Autobahn takes more concentration than driving on U.S.
freeways. When leaving Le Mans after a race, I could usually stay alert for
the 6 hours or so of slogging through French tollroads at 130 km/h (plus a
little extra, whatever I thought I could get away with), until I got to the
German border. At that point, although it's only another two hours to
Stuttgart, I generally just collapsed and slept in the car.

I remember when I videotaped some unknown shows back in '86 or '87 or
so I also got this ad during the commercial breaks on several different
occasions.  The view is looking out through the windshield as the car is
driving down a country road, and the narration is something like: "If you
were a sports car, you'd be lean, agile (words to that effect)..."You'd be
turbocharged (and the car speeds up and goes through a tunnel)..."And of
course, you'd be a Porsche."  The view through the windshield becomes a blur
as the car spins around and the camera angle changes to a head-on shot of a
red 951.  Just about the best Porsche ad I've ever seen on TV, back in the
days when they were selling like proverbial hotcakes.

   Not possible. Probably a wide-body with a Weberized engine.

   If the car was still blown (assuming it EVER had been), and done correctly, 
   you'd either have one hummin' big carb at the inlet to the turbo or *BIG* 
   cans that completely enclosed the carbs over the cylinders.

I think that the car was actually a former turbo.  The original turbo
motor had been replaced by a "hot" 2.2 racing motor.  I guess that the
owner REALLY didn't like turbo lag!  This is all third-hand
information, since I didn't actually meet the owner.

The one I remember started out with a `driver's view' of what appeared
to be a sedate drive down a twisty road. Then the camera was lowered 5
or 10 feet, increasing the sensation of speed and twistiness.  What a

I think this is the same ad that Mike was refering to - it ended up with

yet feel that in my 914.  (Why?  Street vs. sticky tires?)
    The other nice thing was that Soren told me I was doing the
right thing for much of the course.  In fact, about half the time
he told me, "Throttle," my foot was *already* on the floor!  If I
can get on the throttle right before he tells me to, I can't be do-

Subject:  914 proportioning valve adjustment attempt

Well, this weekend I worked on the brakes of my 914.  First, I got my wife to help me bleed the brakes.
I bled the rear wheels first - upper and then lower bleed valves.  Then I bled the proportioning valve.
First the topmost outlet, then the side outlet, last the bottom inlet.  The topmost outlet might have
had some air in it since it seemed to take a little longer before I saw fluid leaking out, but it is hard to
tell.  Lastly, I bled the front brakes - upper and then lower bleed valves.

When I was done, the pedal felt a little firmer and, although I had to *REALLY* stand on the pedal, I
was able to lock my front wheels!  I had never been able to do that before.

Next, I adjusted the proportioning valve.  Jim Pasha's note on adjusting the 914 proportioning valve
says to turn the adjustment screw "Out to increase rear bias, in to reduce rear bias".  My plan was
to adjust the valve until the rear brakes locked before or at the same time as the front brakes - and then
back off a little until the front brakes locked up first.  I assumed that increasing rear bias meant that
more pressure is applied to the rear calipers, so I turned the adjustment screw out (counter-clockwise).
I backed the screw out three turns, testing the brake operation after each turn.  I noticed that the point in
the pedal travel where the proportioning valve clicks in and I hear the valve "clunking" moved upward,
until after the third turn the valve clunked almost immediately when I pressed on the pedal.  Each time
the stopping ability felt the same.

Did I turn the adjustment screw the right way?  Or maybe I didn't adjust it far enough?  I may go back
to the original setting and try turning the adjustment screw in to see what effect that has.

Comments / suggestions?

Mine has started doing this. It's on the passenger side. I had that

Hi, Thom.
 
I just remembered one of the other alleged objections to flux core wire.
Supposedly you can't weld thin material like automotive sheet metal as well
as with true MIG.
 
Like I said, if you can make it work for you, fine, you saved yourself a few
hundred dollars, a gas bottle and regulator.
 
While on the subject of welding equipment, I bit the bullet and bought a
Herob torch, as recommended by Ron Fournier in his Sheet Metal Handbook or
Metal Fabricators Handbook, I forget which. For oxy-acetylene work, this
thing is super; I was getting tired of the clunky stuff made for 1/4 steel
plate and such. Heat buildup is less than with a conventional torch, and I
was able to do a really nice job on a butt-welded floorpan patch (about a 13
x 18 square under the driver's knees; with the welds ground down, you can't
tell it's there).

Redline is 6300.  Rev limiter (from memory) is 6800 +/- 200.

I've hit the rev limiter fairly often (just hate to catch 3rd for less than 5

seconds); it's at least 6800 in my car.

Just put it in second and hit the freeway.  Stay on the throttle until 
it cuts out (or the tach *stays* pegged - don't you hate the overshoot?).

Joe, the cheapest fix is to locate the valve (it may be near the bell
housing or near the front of the engine) which allows hot water from the
water pump to flow through the heater core.  It is operated by a vacuum line.

If you can wire that shut, you should at least be able to drive without
sweating.

Subject: 914-2 race car questions

Friends,

I am looking at a 1972 914-2 "race car". I have not seen the car yet but
talked to the owner. The engine is bored out to 2.2 l and is
turbocharged/intercooled. The car is lowered and has 911S wheels and brakes.
There is a rolbar installed. the car has little rust around the antenna but
is in need of paint. Included is a full set of new rubber for that purpose,
as wel as many spares (new headers etc.).

Asking price s $3,995. Any advice, questions, help before I even take a look
? I have a 951 and a 911 Carrera but am a novice when it comes to 914's.

Thanks, Bart

Denny, there is no perfect car - that you or I can afford. Here's my two
cents on what to look for:
1) Be patient - it takes a long time to find a reasonably good car.
2) Look for any B or C model 356; Coupe, Cab or Roadster. Disk brakes are
not that big of a deal. Drums work just as good (if they have any turns left
and are still round). Never mind about body style. You'll be lucky to find
anything good.
3) Mechanicals are not that important - sheet metal is.
4) Rust is your big problem - look for it under the battery, lower parts of
the doors (drain holes get blocked with falling insullation) and trailing
bottoms of front fenders (front fender underseal cracks and allows water
front front tires into the seams).
5) Avoid cars with recent paint jobs. Chances are it's a bad paint job and
makes it difficult to spot rust and other imperfections. If you're REALLY
lucky, you'll find a car that's never been repainted. That way, you can have
it done right.
6) Avoid recently "restored" cars. They are never done right.
7) Absolutely avoid cars with pan replacements. There's still some out there
with good, original pans.
8) Have someone knowledgable about 356 cars go with you to look at what's
available. Bring an Elfrink so you can match engine numbers with body
numbers.
9) Be Patient.
10) Be Patient.

Good Luck,

Subject: FI vs. Carbs: Stop the carb bashing!!!

Fellow Porschephiles,

I, too, think modern fuel injection is the most accurate, efficient method
of induction for internal combustion engines. However, I must say that
carburetors are *NOT* a dead, worthless, or "girly-man" form of induction.

Until I bought my '74 911 which has an '80 SC engine with Webers, I had never
owned or even driven a car without fuel injection. The early Bosch FI on my
Lancia has *never* hiccuped, so I have been a strong believer in FI since my
fascination with automobiles began. So when I bought the '74, I was weary of
the carburetors. Everybody was telling me that I'd hate them come winter and
that they'd be cold-natured and unreliable. They were wrong.

My '74 starts strong every morning, winter or summer. Amazingly, it doesn't
hiccup, miss, or buck when cold. You can drive off smoothly as soon as you
start it, unlike my father's '85 Carrera which is horribly cold-natured,
as is his '93 BMW 525i. They buck and skip until they warm up a little.
My Lancia is the *only* fuel injected car I've driven which isn't noticeably
cold-natured. Even my mother's '91 Miata runs rough when cold.

Admittedly, the carbs require more frequent tuning than FI, and they're not
quite as efficient. But they're close. On our trip to Tweeks in Indy, I got
an excellent 25.5 MPG while my dad's Motronic 911 got 26.5, only one MPG
higher!!!

Once you learn how to start a 911 with Webers with the engine cold and with it
warm, living with carbs is a breeze. Of course, these Webers are some of the
best carbs ever made. I don't have experience with SUs and other carbs which
*must* be responsible for all the negative hype, so I can't really speak for
carbs in general. But I *do* know that Webers on a 911 engine are a viable,
reliable, and economically feasible form of induction. I think Bruce Anderson
will agree with me, since he praises Webers in his book for their ease of
performance modifications, and their outstanding throttle response.

Swapping the CIS on a 911SC engine for Webers *will* give you considerably
more horses, and magnitudes better throttle response. To get any better, you
have to shell out megabucks for a custom FI which ain't real easy to modify
in your garage.

One last point: the Japanese crotch rockets which can dust any car any of you
has (including the V8 914 [not really a Porsche anymore, is it?]) are still
using carbs.

So, bottom line: stop ragging on carbs. They've got their place in *today's*
high-performance automotive scene. Try to be more objective, and use *real*
advantages/disadvantages in comparisons. Don't just blow things off.

Subject: 951 information (turbo and exhaust)


I am giving a late response to Triet's question on installing an '89 turbo
charger on an '86 951.  In addition, I can give some insight to his question
on the 951 muffler section.
 

The "Turbo S" turbo charger has the same housing as the plain Turbo, the 
KKK K26.  The Turbo S has the K26-1 or K26S or some similar designation. 
It has redesigned blades (more efficient) on the exhaust and compressor
turbines which can produce a higher boost pressure for a given exhaust flow.

When a Turbo S turbo is installed in an earlier Turbo ('86-'88) it is 
capable of exceeding the maximum boost pressure allowed by the cars' KLR,
which is 1.75 bar absolute pressure.  When this over pressure occurs,  the
KLR will open the waste gate via the cycling, or timing, valve.  This will
usually occur at high RPM's in 3rd or midway through 4th gear under extended
full throttle.  The computer is not programmed to control the pressure
build up of the more efficient turbo, so it falls back on the overboost control and dumps the waste gate.

There are some possibilities to remedy this.  The first and the cheapest is 
replacing the DME and KLR EPROM chips.  The '86 Turbo DME chip has 12 pins
per side, where the '89 has 14 pins.  These chips are not compatable.  The
KLR chips are all compatable with 12 pins per side.  I would not recommend
just replacing the KLR chip with one from a Turbo S because there maybe some
communication between the KLR and the DME chips that could cause a problem.
The fuel curves would not be set up for the higher boost pressure, also.

I feel that the Autothority (APE) stage II chip set will work.  It allows
around 1.95 bar boost pressure which is well above the 1.82 bar of the Turbo S.
This high boost pressure causes the arguable concern of head gasket life.  
The APE stage I chip set may be enough to keep the computer from opening the
waste gate completely, as it does when over boost protection kicks in.  Though
it does not exceed stock boost pressure, it does seem to maintain this peak 
pressure through a longer RPM range.  The factory chip begins to decrease 
boost pressure above 4500 RPM to reduce stress on the engine at high RPM's.
Knowledgable persons at  APE should be able to answer these questions or
concerns about replacing a single chip or the use of the stage I or II.

Without running aftermarket software, another way would be to replace the 
entire DME and KLR units with those from a Turbo S.  This would work but 
I have a feeling that it would be expensive.

I've ridden in a '86 Turbo with a Turbo S turbo installed and the Catalytic
convertor removed.  It felt at least as strong as an '89 Turbo, that is, until
waste gate opened and the car stalled.  I have a good sense of what a 951
should feel like.  I've driven two stock '86 Turbos, a stock '87, an '88 Turbo
S, and three '89s (one of which I own).  I think that you would be pleased
with the performance improvement of installing the Turbo S turbo charger.
I not sure if is worth the cost of the part, labor of installation, and cost
of the DME and KLR updates (whatever method that works).  If you haven't 
already done so, or if you live in a sniffer state, I do recommend removing
the catalytic convertor. 

I removed the catalytic convertor and installed a Bursch Test Pipe on my car
to let it run a little cooler and to give it a louder exhaust note.  I was
also very impressed with the added performance.  The engine does not feel like
it's producing more power, but the car is noticeable faster, especially on the
top end.  At Road America in August, I was indicating 140 mph up the front
straight, which is 5 to 8 mph quicker than I was getting without the test pipe.

I dont feel that a larger "club sport" would help performance any unless
your looking for 400 + bhp.

The muffler section may be somewhat difficult to access with the exhaust 
system still on the car.  There are four 15 mm (head size) bolts that mount
the muffler section to the catalytic convertor section.  If these bolts are
really stuck, and they probably are, it will be difficult to get the wrenches
on the nut and the bolt with enough room to break them loose, especially the
top passenger side one.  This is because the waste gate bypass pipe enters
right in front of this flange joint.  If you get the car high enough to have
some elbow room under the car, it can probably be done.  I removed the whole
pipe assembly from the turbo on back when I did the test pipe.  Therefore, I
broke this section apart when the whole system was off the car.  There are 
two 13 mm bolts right behind the section joint and two 13 mm nuts right after
the muffler (visible from the rear end) that also need to be removed.

So Ted, just how many 'SC's, 3.2's and 993's has your car kicked?
Or is this just more of your "theory."  [Whatever happened to your
skinny tire theory - I notice you're now looking for 215's and 15"
wheels...]

I know a woman with a '82(?) targa that drives on hard tires who
would chew you up and spit you out.  She's owned the car for 
about a year and a half.

I only mention her as it would not be fair to have you compete 
against my car ('sway bars, 15x7 &15x8 wheels, soft tires, 
strut brace (ps to stan, I suspect it's the brackets that defeat 
the rubber shock mounts, but the bar does improve turn-in 
(my subjective opinion).  Perhaps $1100 in mods (plus cost of tires).  

Also keep in mind, your car is classed with mine ('80 sc) in one 
of the lowest power to weight catagories; If I were you, I wouldn't 
race any 3.2's for pink slips.

Subject: While I have the transmission out?


A few days ago, I fired up the 914 and managed to get half a block before
the oil pressure warning light came on.  Sigh...  Limp home.  There in the
middle of the drive way was a fresh puddle of oil about 3 feet in diameter.
Upon subsequent investigation, the problem appears to be a blown rear seal.
I've never seen a rear seal fail suddenly, but hey, I've never owned an
air-cooled until now, either.  Is this common?

To get at the problem area, I've dropped the transmission out of the car and
am getting ready to pull the clutch (tonight, I hope).  I've heard the rear
seal can be replaced without tearing down the engine.  Any advice?  While
I'm into this deep, I'm going to replace the clutch, pressure plate, and
throwout bearing.  Oh yeah, it's also time to R&R that busted transmission
mount I've been meaning to "get around to someday".  No time like the
present to spend money.  I'll also replace the clutch cable if it shows
signs fraying, repack the CV joints, and grease the various shift-linkage
points.

Any suggestions for what else I ought to do while I've got the tranny neatly
tucked out of the way?

It was Alice Cooper's "School's Out" and it was an ad to get people to take the

Subject: 944 Wheel bearings

 
I've noticed that if I push/pull sideways on the top of my front wheels on
my '86 944 when it is parked, there is some play and it can also be felt
by putting a finger on the brake pad against the disk. How much play is 
acceptable? When I brought it to the local dealer for an alignment job, the
mechanic said it was ok and within spec.The play can also be felt when I
raise the wheel off the ground. 
 
I've tightened the bearing clamp nut before but perhaps not tight enough
as I've heard it is better to under than overtighten. I think the prescribed
method of tightening the nut until you can just move the bearing thrust 
washer is too imprecise and results in too loose a bearing. 
 
What is the correct torque for adjusting bearings? I'm inclined to use
the method where I tighten it as hard as I can with one hand which should
yield roughly 10-15 in. lbs. or 1 ft lb.

To check afterwards, I intend to drive at high speeds and then feel the
hub through the dial mags for any heat.
 
I hope this doesn't seem anal, but I like my car to be as tight and in
tune as possible.

ps. Is there a proper way off removing the grease cap? I wince when I have
to pound it free with a screwdriver and hammer as it is quite tight and
the hub metal is soft.

There was nothing rude in my response.  It was a simple observation, and
if I am in error, Scott should point it out to me.  I *have*
participated in corner balancing a number of 911's, and they cannot
be given equal side-to-side weight short of major surgery or some kind
of astronomical jacking.  I think that if Scott had ever corner
weighted a 911, he'd know this.

I do have a copy of the book to which you refer.  To be blunt, you
insult my intelligence by quoting from it selectively and out of context.
Read the second paragraph of the "Corner Weight" section on pg. 137.

  "If the loaded heights of the springs are right on and if you
   have kept the adjustments ever [sic] -- and if the chassis is
   straight -- and if the design doesn't contain too much offset
   weight, the corner weight should be very close."

He goes on to give a pretty good explanation of what you are trying
to do and how it can be accomplished, and what the limits are.  He
places more emphasis on equal front wheel weight than side-to-side
equality.  That's a trade-off, like many many things in suspension
design and tuning.  Other people place more emphasis on consistency
in handling.

Bear in mind also the following.  Let's say you get a static corner
balance which places equal weight on each front wheel.  But you've
traded that off against equal rear wheel weights.  Guess what
happens when you brake heavily?  Weight transfer, rear to front.
Your ideal, perfect numbers just went out the window.

With a single-seater or any race car built from a clean sheet of
paper, you have the opportunity to design in perfect balance.  Part
of this involves choosing locations carefully for components such
as fuel and oil tanks and batteries.

I'm looking for a little help from the Net...

I'm in the process of putting a new head gasket in my 88 951.
I've got it all apart and the head off.

This Porsche has been played with in the past.
There is some kind of brass adjustment spliced into a hose that
goes from (i think, i'm not sure what all these parts do) intake manifold
pressure to a wast gate control.. 
1 What is this and can I remove it by just putting in a straight hose.
2 Can I buy all the hoses for under the intake manifold in one kit??
3 I checked both the bosch boxes under the drivers side floor..
both the box labled motronic and the other one had been opened before..
they had been pryed open..So I opened them to see if I could see anything
unusual.. I didnt.. But I dont know what to look for.. 
4 Do I have to take it completely apart and look at the big chip in the middle?
5 Is there anything else I should check.. I would like to make this
  faster than stock but I want to find out what has been done and what has
  not been done. Then I need to be informed about what are right mods vs
  incorrect harmfull mods.

Thanks in advance..

Subject: 944 Trailing Arm

This relates to a 1984 944:
I've been monitoring an ever so slight top-bottom wobble of my R-R wheel; it
is not matched by a left-right wobble and has been diagnosed as an
ellipically erroded right trailing arm, not the bearing itself.  It has not
gotten much worse even over 4 track events this summer.  BUT as a beginner
to tracking, I've been running with total stock suspension and hard street
tires (Michelin XGTs)  This has been fine for learning but this winter I
want to stiffen the suspension and put sticky tires on.  This I figure will
increase the stress on this trailing arm and it is likely to fail sooner.

So I want to replace the trailing arm and have some questions about that.
1.  If no wobble is noticed on the left side is there reasons to do both
    sides?
2.  Is it a hard job for a novice mechanic?
3.  Is this trailing arm one of the VW BUS parts on my car?  Can I get it
    cheaper but the same quality if I go to VW instead of Porsche!

Thanks ahead

None today Soren, just a Corvette down 237 on the way in to the office.

I am looking at 205/215s on 15" wheels, my definition of "skinny" was

Looks like you added about this much to your "stock" car:

Strut Brace $200
2 Welt. Sway Bars $400?
4 Soft Tires $600

Subject:  914 / 912E intake manifold question

Hello!

I understand that the 2.0L 914 engines have a 3 bolt pattern on the intake manifolds and that the
1.8L engines use a 4 bolt pattern.

In 1976, Porsche produced  the 912E, which used 2.0L engines combined with the AFC FI from
the 1.8L model.  What bolt pattern was used on the 912E intake manifold?

I have been thinking about upgrading the 1.8L engine on my 914 to a 2.0L model.  I would like
to keep it fuel injected, possibly the AFC unit currently on my 1.8L.  If I do that, it sounds like
a set of 912E intake manifolds might be an answer to the bolt pattern problem.

Anyone done this before?  Thanks,

Martin,
  I think you, like me, have some strange circuitry in the cold start 
relay.  However, a couple of suggestions, I would set the idle speed a 
little higher, 900 maybe, and also note that when cold (< 70 deg. Calif. 
temp) <g> the idle fluctuates between 850-1200.  This was so, even when 
my cold start worked fine.  I'm not sure what opening the deck and/or 
turning on the light switch do.

Another suggestion is to ignore the oil level, and go by dipstick 
readings.  Often, dipstick in middle when oil is warm > 170, and car is 
flat will show less than half on my oil gauge.

Questions:  If I put in resistors going to the gas tank, and 
Speedomieter, can I adjust them to Euro specs, and cover the MPH with KPH ??

Subject: 951 Coolant Header Tanks


Mike Kehr,

The tank(reservoir) is plastic. The only things that will cause 
deformation are head and internal system pressure. These two items, 
combined with age of the plastic result in distortion, finally splitting 
at the mold seam.

A new one runs about $120, so I'd probably try a used one. Examine the 
replacement, especially if any body panels were damaged around it.

As a second item, check the radiator (tank/reservoir) cap. If it is 
defective and allows over 15.5 lbs, this will be a significant factor in
the deformation of your existing tank. 

Remember, the tank is located very close to the turbo, the heat rises and
plastic will melt.

I'll have to look this up next time I'm at the shop, probably this eve.  If

as I know.  But what do I know?

>I am also looking for the rubber boot that covers the large terminal on

Correct, list price was $2.05 last time I looked it up.  These boots get
chewed up with time and really ought to be replaced.  When you do
so, clean up the electrical connectors with your favourite product, such
as Wurth Kontact OL.  Wouldn't hurt to pack the connection with a
dielectric grease before pulling the boot over.

There should be one on any 944 Turbo.  P/N is 951.341.107.00, list price
was $5.30 about a year ago.  The shield protects the driver-side motor mount
from heat coming from the turbo and its oil return line.  You'll need a 
couple
of short M6 bolts and washers as well, same size as whatever goes on
the right side mount, like maybe M6 x 15 or x 20.

available until 1992.  What's the scoop?  Will these 95's in fact not be 
available until 97 (if so, why are they requiring 90's starting next year 
and not waiting until 97)?

Assuming 95's are years off, what is a good price for a full face SA-90 
which will provide the protection one wants without being excessively 
expensive (i.e. a "Best Value") and who has them?  Since I don't curb 
surf or run on bicycle tires or pretend my Carrera will crush everything 
from a new 993 to the 3.8 cup cars, I have substantial, precious grey 
matter which deserves adequate protection.  Thus T.E.D.'s M75 type

Thanks for your coherent and intelligent (non-T.E.D.-like) responses.

John,
The Denver area smog check consists of both the visual check and the
tailpipe sniffer :U) check.  Last I heard there were exceptions for
cars over 25 years old, but that won't help your 78 911SC for a few years.
Look me up if you get to Boulder, I can recommend a good mechanic here.

Ted, after looking at the current flow diagram for my car, I see an
electronic rev limiter on page 0.1-3/91. Coincidentally, it's right next
to the cold start valve wiring on the same page, which may give you a
clue to your other question, especially if you've recently touched your

Mike, this is caused by heat and pressure, the kinds of things that happen
to a stressed coolant system.

If you can find a tank that has not been stressed like this one, you might
want to give a used one a try.  That having been said, $123 is cheap
considering what might happen if it lets go at the wrong time (e.g. when you
are on a trip a couple of hundred miles from home, on a Saturday night, in
the rain, when your wife is already irritated at you for some perceived
slight, etc...)

Argh.

Veteran Ted watchers and general speculators on the abysmal state of

Since it's not yet clear if Ted knows what a 356 is (hopefully Pete

could waste a lot of breath explaining that perhaps 356's are the
"real" Porsche's and all others merely derivatives.  For that matter
you could call the VW Beetle the first "real" Porsche, but I digress.

On the 944S, there's a pipe above the exhaust manifold that runs
from the front to rear of the engine.  On the front of this pipe
is the vacuum controlled valve for the heater. I've not personally

this valve change position when you turn on/off the heat.

my last run I had no problem. In the next run group my wife was driving an she
also had a problem. While in line for her last run i was shifting thru the
gears with the car off and the shift lever got stuck between gears. I could not
get the shifter to move. I started the car and let out on the clutch and it
popped free. My wife had no problems on her last run. The car shifted fine on
the drive home. Today I was the first time i used the car since the weekend and
i had problems shifting again. This time it would not go into 5th. The strange
thing is that it does not happen every time. If i shifted to another gear and
tried 5th again i could get it to shift just fine. I removed the shift cover
and checked the coupler and the allen set screw. The set screw was tight and
the coupler did not appear to have anymore play than i remember. What might i
look for as a cause? Thanks for any advise.

Subject: Done Deal: 928!


Gentlemen, I again thank you all for your help and insight into my 
demented desire for a 928; your help and guidance has culminated today in 
my purchase. 

I purchased a 1986 928S with 44k miles on it. Marine Blue metallic with 
blue leather, interior and exterior in immaculate condition. Deep scent 
of leather in the interior.

Pre-purchase inspection on the car revealed an engine in excellent 
condition, service records fairly well maintained, and a the unmistakable 
mark of some non-Porsche mechanics having laid their hands on the car.

I picked the car up at about 5pm and proceeded to take a nice leisurely 
75 mile drive. Smooth, powerful acceleration, surprising maneuverability, 
and overall a joy to drive on the open road. Picked up the new Clapton CD 
on the way and enjoyed that as well. :-)

Just had to share! Maybe it's terribly materialistic, but I feel about as 
good as I ever have in my 26 years (Happy Birthday to me- yesterday!) and 
the car plays no small part in that. Maybe I'll be "sick" tommorrow...

As an aside, does anyone know of a source for the "Porsche Alarm System" 
stickers? My vehicle is so equipped, but I would rather alert people who 
don't know that to the fact.

Again, thank you to all the 928 owners out there who came to my aid in 
one way or another.

Isn't it amazing!

While driving home yesterday, I got the sh?t scared out of me when I noticed
that I had no brakes and I was about a 1/4-mile away form the approaching
traffic red light. A combination of quick down shifting and hand brakes tammed
the beast, enough to make a quick right turn just before the red light. A
quick inspection didn't show anything, so I decided to carefully drive
home (I was only about a mile away from my destination and the traffic was
almost zero).  While driving, few times I noticed that the front right wheel
will drag for a second or so.

 Once home performed all brake related diagnostic i.e. leaks, pads, rotor
and master cylinder revealed nothing. Not knowing what to look for I decided 
to check out the right front wheel. Once in air, I can see that the whole
wheel assembly (i.e rotor & wheel) was loose. Further investigation revealed
that the whole front bearing disintegrated into pieces.

 Washed and checked the spindle and the rotor assembly. Beside
few deep scratches by the front lip of the rotor ( by the clamping Nut),
the rest of the unit looks good. Question is, should I be concern about the
deep scratches  and replace the front wheel hub or can I still use the
old unit by sanding and smoothing the effected areas? 

 The only thing salvaged was the inner wall of the front bearing which is now
stuck to the spindle. I tired tapping but to no avail. Any suggestions for 
getting the inner wall of the spindle? How far can I force the issue by a
good hammer?

While I am at it, any suggestion for type of Grease and bearing.

I am still trying to figure out, why my brakes stopped working. The car in
question a 85.5 944.

Subject: RE: Salina final results

Greetings -

Here are the final results from the SCCA National Championship in Salina,
Kansas.  Little slow in coming but after the last day, everyone headed
home and forgot to post the final runs from Friday.  Again Members of
Porsche club not in their Porsches are Jeff Reitmeir - AS, Stacy Reitmeir
 - ES (yes, the mens class), Michelle Reitmeir - HSL, Ken Mitchell - ESP,
Teresa Lommatzsch - ESPL, Kim Knapp - DM and Ralph Elder - ES.  Porsche
cars are noted in results.  It was a great week and I look forward to
going again next year.  Nationals is much like the Porsche Parade with
lots of parties mixed in with some autocrossing/racing.  Weather was good
except for Sunday afternoon and Wednesday morning where it rained (mostly
on Sunday).  Interesting highlight was seeing many people switching from
Yoko's to BFG's either before arriving in Salina or after their first day
of competition (sponsored drivers excluded).  The new Yoko was not
impressive to their sponsored drivers during the test day or during
competition.  Hope Yoko gets some new tires for next year to keep the tire
wars going.  Congratulations to all these drivers and the Porsche drivers 
below for their performances.  You all did good (no....make that great!) 
and upheld the Porsche marque.

Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL*
is, to be blunt, snake oil. Or as Bruce Anderson commented about 
something else, "a cash flow device". 

Slick-50 is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case. Guess
what we all have, eh? There is a bit of info on it via anonymous
FTP in tta.com /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo

It's me agian..........

I have been reminded that Greg and Jodi Fordahl are members of Porsche 
club and ran in SS/SSL classes as well as Byron and Yvonne Short who ran 
in, I think, CS/CSL.  Neither of these couples ran their Porsches but 
chose to run their other cars.

Subject: engine machine work

Does anyone use that plastic/wax thread (looks like dental floss,
sold in flat paper sleeves about 1 in wide x several in long) that
you put in your crank bearing journals, torque down the caps,
then check the squished width to check bearing clearance? What is
it called, what name is it sold under?

Is it hard to get old valve guides out of a 71 911 head?  Do you have to
drill them out?  One of my books sez that it is so hard that it may be
cheaper to buy reconditioned heads!  Any recommendations for machine
shops to do my heads in the Bay area?  (I'm in the East Bay, but San
Jose would be ok). Does "911 Engineering" in Morgan Hill do good 
work for a reasonable price?

Someone told me that Elgin (Mountain View?) is a good place
to have your cams reground, that they would probably do a
pair for about $150. Is this sound advice?

I tried to buy parts cleaning solvent the other day, felt like I
stepped out of a time machine. The teenage kids in Grand Auto
and Kragen didn't know what I was talking about. I guess it's
been outlawed in California sometime in the past 10 years.
Had no problem getting it in Georgia a few years ago.
In California, they now sell things like very strong detergents and
bases instead of chlorinated solvents.  They don't work nearly as well
for parts cleaning.  What is surprising though, is that you can still buy
gallon cans of carburator cleaner- in terms of environmental impact that
makes the old cleaning solvent seem as mild as water!

Subject: 356 - should I make an offer?

Near where I work, there is a beat up 356 parked on the street, I'm not 
sure if it's abandoned, or the owner just doesn't have room, but the 
neighborhood is full of 2 car garage houses, so I wonder if it's just left?

Is it appropriate to put a note on the windshield and say, offer the guy 
a couple hundred for the title, and to tow it?  For all I know it does 
not have an engine, needs a paint job, etc.  However, it looks like a fun 
beater car when the real car's in the shop.  It's a coupe, so I wouldn't 
have to worry about expensive tops for it.

What are these worth in beat up but running shape?  Can I find a VW 
engine and throw it in the back?  Will a 911 engine fit? 

Ted

OK, is this the official porsche tech. manual?  Is there an equivalent in 
the Haynes manual or original green owner's manual?  I've been holding 
off on the original manuals because of cost.  How about a clue, as to the

First, thanks again for all the tips on the 914 fresh air fan replacement. Yes,I did try the pencil trick, but the fan itself was spinning freely, so that is
not the problem. I guess these things do break after 20+ years. And we do have 
a running replacement which came with spare parts when we got the car.

I do have one more question: The hoses are all very brittle after 20 years, and
we will also need new ones for the heater reinstall too. Places do sell
these piece by piece. But can anyone suggest where I might buy a long piece of
this hose material (like 20 feet) and just cut it myself? 

And one further question, regarding the gas tank: Anyone know what size and
type of hose we will need to replace the gasline hose at the bottom of the
tank once we remove it?

Thanks,

   Information for this article was compiled from reports and studies by
the University of Nevada Desert Research Center, DuPont Chemical Company,
Avco Lycoming (aircraft engine manufacturers), North Dakota State
University, Briggs and Stratton (engine manufacturers), the University of
Utah Engineering Experiment Station, California State Polytechnic College
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lewis Research
Center.

   Road Rider does not claim to have all the answers. Nor do we care to
presume to tell you what to do. We have simply tried to provide you with
all the information we were able to dredge up on this subject, in hopes
it will help you in making your own, informed decision.

You Can't Tell The Players Without A Program

   On starting this project, we set out to find as many different oil
additives as we could buy. That turned out to be a mistake. There were
simply too many avail able! At the very first auto parts store we
visited, there were over two dozen different brand names available. By
the end of the day, we had identified over 40 different oil additives for
sale and realized we needed to rethink our strategy.
   First of all, we found that if we checked the fine print on the
packages, quite a number of the additives came from the same
manufacturer. Also, we began to notice that the additives could be
separated into basic "groups" that seemed to carry approximately the same
ingredients and the same promises.
   In the end, we divided our additives into four basic groups and
purchased at least three brands from three different manufacturers for
each group. We defined our four groups this way:
   1.) Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular 50-rated
engine oil (including standard additives) with PTFE (Teflon TM) added.
   2.) Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular 50-rated
engine oil (including standard additives) with zinc dialkyldithiophosphate
added.
   3.) Products containing (as near as we could determine) much the same
additives as are already found in most major brands of engine oil, though
in different quantities and combinations.
   4.) Products made up primarily of solvents and/or detergents.
   There may be some differences in chemical makeup within groups, but
that is impossible to tell since the additive manufacturers refuse to
list the specific ingredients of their products. We will discuss each
group individually.

 The PTFE Mystery

   Currently, the most common and popular oil additives on the market are
those that contain PTFE powders suspended in a regular, over-the-counter
type, 50-rated petroleum or synthetic engine oil. PTFE is the common
abbreviation used for Polytetrafloeraethylene, more commonly known by the
trade name "Teflon," which is a registered trademark of the DuPont
Chemical Corporation. Among those oil additives we have identified as
containing PTFE are: Slick 50, Liquid Ring, Lubrilon, Microlon, Matrix,
Petrolon (same company as Slick 50), QMl, and T-Plus (K-Mart). There are
probably many more names in use on many more products using PTFE. We have
found that oil additive makers like to market their products under a
multitude of "private brand" names.
   While some of these products may contain other additives in addition
to PTFE, all seem to rely on the PTFE as their primary active ingredient
and all, without exception, do not list what other ingredients they may
contain.
   Though they have gained rather wide acceptance among the motoring
public, oil additives containing PTFE have also garnered their share of
critics among experts in the field of lubrication. By far the most
damning testimonial against these products originally came from the
DuPont Chemical Corporation, inventor of PTFE and holder of the patents
and trademarks for Teflon. In a statement issued about ten years ago,
DuPont's Fluoropolymers Division Product Specialist, J.F. Imbalzano said,
"Teflon is not useful as an ingredient in oil additives or oils used for
internal combustion engines."
   At the time, DuPont threatened legal action against anyone who used
the name "Teflon" on any oil product destined for use in an internal
combustion engine, and refused to sell its PTFE powders to any one who
intended to use them for such purposes.
   After a flurry of lawsuits from oil additive makers, claiming DuPont
could not prove that PTFE was harmful to engines, DuPont was forced to
once again begin selling their PTFE to the additive producers. The
additive makers like to claim this is some kind of "proof' that their
products work, when in fact it is nothing more than proof that the
American legal ethic of "innocent until proven guilty" is still alive and
well. The decision against DuPont involved what is called "restraint of
trade." You can't refuse to sell a product to someone just because there
is a possibility they might use it for a purpose other than what you
intended it for.
   It should be noted that DuPont's official position on the use of PTFE
in engine oils remains carefully aloof and noncommittal, for obvious
legal reasons. DuPont states that though they sell PTFE to oil additive
producers, they have "no proof of the validity of the additive makers'
claims." They further state that they have "no knowledge of any advantage
gained through the use of PTFE in engine oil."
   Fear of potential lawsuits for possible misrepresentation of a product
seem to run much higher among those with the most to lose.
   After DuPont's decision and attempt to halt the use of PTFE in engine
oils, several of the oil additive companies simply went elsewhere for
their PTFE powders, such as purchasing them in other countries. In some
cases, they disguise or hype their PTFE as being something different or
special by listing it under one of their own tradenames. That doesn't
change the fact that it is still PTFE.
   In addition, there is some evidence that certain supplies of PTFE
powders (from manufacturers other than DuPont) are of a cruder version
than the original, made with larger sized flakes that are more likely to
"settle out" in your oil or clog up your filters. One fairly good
indication that a product contains this kind of PTFE is if the
instructions for its use advise you to "shake well before using." It only
stands to reason that if the manufacturer knows the solids in his product
will settle to the bottom of a container while sitting on a shelf, the
same thing is going to hap pen inside your engine when it is left idle
for any period of time.
   The problem with putting PTFE in your oil, as explained to us by
several industry experts, is that PTFE is a solid. The additive makers
claim this solid "coats" the moving parts in an engine (though that is
far from being scientifically proven). Slick 50 is currently both the
most aggressive advertiser and the most popular seller, with claims of
over 14 million treatments sold. However, such solids seem even more
inclined to coat non-moving parts, like oil passages and filters. After
all, if it can build up under the pressures and friction exerted on a
cylinder wall, then it stands to reason it should build up even better in
places with low pressures and virtually no friction.
   This conclusion seems to be borne out by tests on oil additives
containing PTFE conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center, which said
in their report, "In the types of bearing surface contact we have looked
at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have seen detrimental
effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate at inlets and act as a
dam, which simply blocks the oil from entering. Instead of helping, it is
actually depriving parts of lubricant."
   Remember, PTFE in oil additives is a suspended solid. Now think about
why you have an oil filter on your engine. To remove suspended solids,
right? Right. Therefore it would seem to follow that if your oil filter
is doing its job, it will collect as much of the PTFE as possible, as
quickly as possible. This can result in a clogged oil filter and
decreased oil pres sure throughout your engine.
   In response to our inquiries about this sort of problem, several of
the PTFE pushers responded that their particulates were of a sub-micron
size, capable of passing through an ordinary oil filter unrestricted.
This certainly sounds good, and may in some cases actually be true, but
it makes little difference when you know the rest of the story. You see,
PTFE has other qualities besides being a friction reducer: It expands
radically when exposed to heat. So even if those particles are small
enough to pass through your filter when you purchase them, they very well
may not be when your engine reaches normal operating temperature.
   Here again, the' scientific evidence seems to support this, as in
tests conducted by researchers at the University of Utah Engineering
Experiment Station involving Petrolon additive with PTFE.
   The Petrolon test report states, "There was a pressure drop across the
oil filter resulting from possible clogging of small passageways." In
addition, oil analysis showed that iron contamination doubled after using
the treatment, indicating that engine wear didn't go down - it appeared
to shoot up.
   This particular report was paid for by Petrolon (marketers of Slick
50), and was not all bad news for their products. The tests, conducted on
a Chevrolet six-cylinder automobile engine, showed that after treatment
with the PTFE additive the test engine's friction was reduced by 13.1
percent. Also, output horsepower increased from 5.3 percent to 8.1
percent, and fuel economy improved from 11.8 percent under light load to
3.8 percent under heavy load.
   These are the kind of results an aggressive marketing company like
Petrolon can really sink their teeth into. If we only reported the
results in the last paragraph to you, you'd be inclined to think Slick 50
was indeed a magic engine elixir. What you have to keep in mind is that
often times the benefits (like increased horse power and fuel economy)
may be out weighed by some serious drawbacks (like the indications of
reduced oil pressure and increased wear rate).

The Plot Thickens
   Just as we were about to go to press with this article, we were
contacted by the public relations firm of Trent and Company, an outfit
with a prestigious address in the Empire State Building, New York. They
advised us they were working for a company called QMI out of Lakeland,
Florida, that was marketing a "technological breakthrough" product in oil
additives. Naturally, we asked them to send us all pertinent information,
including any testing and research data.
   What we got was pretty much what we expected. QMI's oil additive,
according to their press release, uses "ten times more PTFE resins than
its closest competitor." Using the "unique SX-6000 formula," they say
they are the only company to use "aqueous dispersion resin which means
the microns (particle sizes) are extensively smaller and can penetrate
tight areas." This, they claim, "completely eliminates the problem of
clogged filters and oil passages."
   Intrigued by their press release, we set up a telephone interview with
their Vice-President of Technical Services, Mr. Owen Heatwole. Mr.
Heatwole's name was immediately recognized by us as one that had popped
in earlier research of this subject as a former employee of Petrolon, a
company whose name seems inextricably linked in some fashion or another
with virtually every PTFE-related additive maker in the country.
   Mr. Heatwole was a charming and persuasive talker with a knack for
avoiding direct answers as good as any seasoned politician. His glib
pitch for his product was the best we've ever heard, but when dissected
and pared down to the verifiable facts, it actually said very little.
   When we asked about the ingredients in QMI's treatments, we got almost
exactly the response we expected. Mr. Heatwole said he would "have to
avoid discussing specifics about the formula, for proprietary reasons."
   After telling us that QMI was being used by "a major oil company," a
"nuclear plant owned by a major corporation" and a "major engine
manufacturer," Mr. Heatwole followed up with, "Naturally, I can't reveal
their names - for proprietary reasons."
   He further claimed to have extensive testing and research data
available from a "major laboratory," proving conclusively how effective
QMI was. When we asked for the name of the lab, can you guess? Yup, "We
can't give out that information, for proprietary reasons."
   What QMI did give us was the typical "testimonials," though we must
admit theirs came from more recognizable sources than usual. They seem to
have won over the likes of both Team Kawasaki and Bobby Unser, who
evidently endorse and use QMI in their racing engines. Mr. Heatwole was
very proud of the fact that their product was being used in engines that
he himself admitted are "torn down and completely inspected on a weekly
basis." Of course, what he left out is that those same engines are almost
totally rebuilt every time they're torn down. So what does that prove in
terms of his product reducing wear and promoting engine longevity?
Virtually nothing.
   Mr. Heatwole declined to name the source of QMI's PTFE supply "for
proprietary reasons." He bragged that their product is sold under many
different private labels, but refused to identify those labels "for
proprietary reasons." When asked about the actual size of the PTFE
particles used in QMI, he claimed they were measured as "sub-micron in
size" by a "major motor laboratory" which he couldn't identify - you
guessed it - for "proprietary reasons."
   After about an hour of listening to "don't quote me on this," "I'll
have to deny that if you print it," and "I can't reveal that," we asked
Mr. Heatwole if there was something we could print. "Certainly," he said,
"Here's a good quote for you: 'The radical growth in technology has
overcome the problem areas associated with PTFE in the 1980s'"
   "Not bad," we said. Then we asked to whom we might attribute this gem
of wisdom. DuPont Chemical, perhaps?
   "Me," said Mr. Heatwole. "I said that."
   QMI's press releases like to quote the Guinness Book Of Records in
saying that PTFE is "The slickest substance known to man." Far be it from
us to take exception to the Guinness Book, but we doubt that PTFE is much
slicker than some of the people marketing it.

The Zinc Question
   The latest "miracle ingredient" in oil additives, attempting to usurp
PTFE's cure-all throne, is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, which we will
refer to here after as simply "zinc."
   Purveyors of the new zinc-related products claim they can prove
absolute superiority over the PTFE-related products. Naturally, the PTFE
crowd claim exactly the same, in reverse.
   Zinc is contained as part of the standard additive package in
virtually every major brand of engine oil sold today, varying from a low
volume of 0.10 per cent in brands such as Valvoline All Climate and
Chevron l5W-50, to a high volume of 0.20 percent in brands such as
Valvoline Race and Pennzoil GT Performance.
   Organic zinc compounds are used as extreme pressure, anti-wear
additives, and are therefore found in larger amounts in oils specifically
blended for high-revving, turbocharged or racing applications. The zinc
in your oil comes into play only when there is actual metal-to-metal con
tact within your engine, which should never occur under normal operating
conditions. However, if you race your bike, or occasionally play tag with
the redline on the tach, the zinc is your last line of defense. Under
extreme conditions, the zinc compounds react with the metal to prevent
scuffing, particularly between cylinder bores and piston rings.
   However - and this is the important part to remember - available
research shows that more zinc does not give you more protection, it
merely prolongs the protection if the rate of metal-to-metal contact is
abnormally high or extended. So unless you plan on spending a couple of
hours dragging your knee at Laguna Seca, adding extra zinc compounds to
your oil is usually a waste. Also, keep in mind that high zinc content
can lead to deposit formation on your valves, and spark plug fouling.
   Among the products we found containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate
were Mechanics Brand Engine Tune Up, K Mart Super Oil Treatment, and STP
Engine Treatment With XEP2. The only reason we can easily identify the
additives with the new zinc compounds is that they are required to carry
a Federally mandated warning label indicating they contain a hazardous
substance. The zinc phosphate they contain is a known eye irritant,
capable of inflicting severe harm if it comes in contact with your eyes.
If you insist on using one of these products, please wear protective
goggles and exercise extreme caution.
   As we mentioned, organic zinc compounds are already found in virtually
every major brand of oil, both automotive and motorcycle. However, in
recent years the oil companies voluntarily reduced the amount of zinc
content in most of their products after research indicated the zinc was
responsible for premature deterioration and damage to catalytic
converters. Obviously this situation would not affect 99 percent of all
the motorcycles on the road - however, it could have been a factor with
the newer BMW converter - equipped bikes.
   Since the reduction in zinc content was implemented solely for the
protection of catalytic converters, it is possible that some motorcycles
might benefit from a slight increase in zinc content in their oils. This
has been taken into account by at least one oil company, Spectro, which
offers 0.02 to 0.03 percent more zinc compounds in its motorcycle oils
than in its automotive oils.
   Since Spectro (Golden 4 brand, in this case) is a synthetic blend
lubricant designed for extended drain intervals, this increase seems to
be wholly justified. Also, available research indicates that Spectro has,
in this case, achieved a sensible balance for extended application
without increasing the zinc content to the point that it is likely to
cause spark plug fouling or present a threat to converter-equipped BMW
models.
   It would appear that someone at Spectro did their homework.

Increased Standard Additives (More Is Not Necessarily Better)
   Though some additives may not contain anything harmful to your engine,
and even some things that could be beneficial, most experts still
recommend that you avoid their use. The reason for this is that your oil,
as purchased from one of the major oil companies, already contains a very
extensive additive package.
   This package is made up of numerous, specific additive components,
blended to achieve a specific formula that will meet the requirements of
your engine. Usually, at least several of these additives will be
synergistic. That is, they react mutually, in groups of two or more, to
create an effect that none of them could attain individually. Changing or
adding to this formula can upset the balance and negate the protective
effect the formula was meant to achieve, even if you are only adding more
of something that was already included in the initial package.
   If it helps, try to think of your oil like a cake recipe. Just because
the original recipe calls for two eggs (which makes for a very moist and
tasty cake), do you think adding four more eggs is going to make the cake
better? Of course not. You're going to upset the carefully calculated
balance of ingredients and magnify the effect the eggs have on the recipe
to the point that it ruins the entire cake. Adding more of a specific
additive already contained in your oil is likely to produce similar
results.
   This information should also be taken into account when adding to the
oil already in your bike or when mixing oils for any reason, such as
synthetic with petroleum. In these cases, always make sure the oils you
are putting together have the same rating (SA, SE, SC, etc.). This tells
you their additive packages are basically the same, or at least
compatible, and are less likely to upset the balance or counteract each
other.

Detergents And Solvents
   Many of the older, better-known oil treatments on the market do not
make claims nearly so lavish as the new upstarts. Old standbys like
Bardahl, Rislone and Marvel Mystery Oil, instead offer things like
"quieter lifters," "reduced oil burning" and a "cleaner engine."
   Most of these products are made up of solvents and detergents designed
to dissolve sludge and carbon deposits inside your engine so they can be
flushed or burned out. Wynn's Friction Proofing Oil, for example, is 83
percent kerosene. Other brands use naphthalene, xylene, acetone and
isopropanol. Usually, these ingredients will be found in a base of
standard mineral oil.
   In general, these products are designed to do just the opposite of
what the PTFE and zinc phosphate additives claim to do. Instead of
leaving behind a "coating" or a "plating" on your engine surfaces, they
are designed to strip away such things.
   All of these products will strip sludge and deposits out and clean up
your engine, particularly if it is an older, abused one. The problem is,
unless you have some way of determining just how much is needed to remove
your deposits without going any further, such solvents also can strip
away the boundary lubrication layer provided by your oil. Overuse of
solvents is an easy trap to fall into, and one which can promote harmful
metal-to-metal contact within your engine.
   As a general rule of thumb these products had their place and were at
least moderately useful on older automobile and motorcycle engines of the
Fifties and Sixties, but are basically unneeded on the more efficient
engine designs of the past two decades.

The Infamous "No Oil" Demo
   At at least three major motorcycle rallies this past year, we have
witnessed live demonstrations put on to demonstrate the effectiveness of
certain oil additives. The demonstrators would have a bench-mounted
engine which they would fill with oil and a prescribed dose of their
"miracle additive." After running the engine for a while they would stop
it, drain out the oil and start it up again. Instant magic! The engine
would run perfectly well for hours on end, seemingly proving the
effectiveness of the additive which had supposedly "coated" the inside of
the engine so well it didn't even need the oil to run. In one case, we
saw this done with an actual motorcycle, which would be rid den around
the parking lot after having its oil drained. A pretty convincing
demonstration - until you know the facts.
   Since some of these demonstrations were conducted using Briggs and
Stratton engines, the Briggs and Stratton Company itself decided to run a
similar, but somewhat more scientific, experiment. Taking two brand-new,
identical engines straight off their assembly line, they set them up for
bench-testing. The only difference was that one had the special additive
included with its oil and the other did not. Both were operated for 20
hours before being shut down and having the oil drained from them. Then
both were started up again and allowed to run for another 20 straight
hours. Neither engine seemed to have any problem performing this "minor
miracle."
   After the second 20-hour run, both engines were completely torn down
and inspected by the company's engineers. What they found was that both
engines suffered from scored crankpin bearings, but the engine treated
with the additive also suffered from heavy cylinder bore damage that was
not evident on the untreated engine.
   This points out once again the inherent problem with particulate oil
additives: They can cause oil starvation. This is particularly true in
the area of piston rings, where there is a critical need for adequate oil
flow. In practically all of the reports and studies on oil additives, and
particularly those involving suspended solids like PTFE, this has been
reported as a major area of engine damage.

The Racing Perspective
   Among the most convincing testimonials in favor of oil additives are
those that come from professional racers or racing teams. As noted
previously, some of the oil additive products actually are capable of
producing less engine friction, better gas mileage and higher horsepower
out put. In the world of professional racing, the split-second advantage
that might be gained from using such a product could be the difference
between victory and defeat.
   Virtually all of the downside or detrimental effects attached to these
products are related to extended, long-term usage. For short-life,
high-revving, ultra-high performance engines designed to last no longer
than one racing season (or in some cases, one single race), the long-term
effects of oil additives need not even be considered.
   Racers also use special high-adhesion tires that give much better
traction and control than our normal street tires, but you certainly
wouldn't want to go touring on them, since they're designed to wear out
in several hundred (or less) miles. Just because certain oil additives
may be beneficial in a competitive context is no reason to believe they
would be equally beneficial in a touring context.

The Best of The Worst
   Not all engine oil additives are as potentially harmful as some of
those we have described here. However, the best that can be said of those
that have not proved to be harmful is that they haven't been proved to
offer any real benefits, either. In some cases, introducing an additive
with a compatible package of components to your oil in the right
proportion and at the right time can conceivably extend the life of your
oil. However, in every case we have studied it proves out that it would
actually have been cheaper to simply change the engine oil instead.
   In addition, recent new evidence has come to light that makes using
almost any additive a game of Russian Roulette. Since the additive
distributors do not list the ingredients contained within their products,
you never know for sure just what you are putting in your engine.
   Recent tests have shown that even some of the most inoffensive
additives contain products which, though harmless in their initial state,
convert to hydrofluoric acid when exposed to the temperatures inside a
firing cylinder. This acid is formed as part of the exhaust gases, and
though it is instantly expelled from your engine and seems to do it no
harm, the gases collect inside your exhaust system and eat away at your
mufflers from the inside out.

Whatever The Market Will Bear
   The pricing of oil additives seems to follow no particular pattern
whatsoever. Even among those products that seem to be almost identical,
chemically, retail prices covered an extremely wide range. For example:
   One 32-ounce bottle of Slick 50 (with PTFE) cost us $29.95 at a
discount house that listed the retail price as $59.95, while a 32-ounce
bottle of T-Plus (which claims to carry twice as much PTFE as the Slick
50) cost us only $15.88.
   A 32-ounce bottle of STP Engine Treatment (containing what they call
XEP2), which they claim they can prove "outperforms leading PTFE engine
treatments," cost us $17.97. Yet a can of K Mart Super Oil Treatment,
which listed the same zinc-derivative ingredient as that listed for the
XEP2, cost us a paltry $2.67.
   Industry experts estimate that the actual cost of producing most oil
additives is from one-tenth to one-twentieth of the asking retail price.
Certainly no additive manufacturer has come forward with any exotic,
high-cost ingredient or list of ingredients to dispute this claim. As an
interesting note along with this, back before there was so much
competition in the field to drive prices down, Petrolon (Slick 50) was
selling their PTFE products for as much as $400 per treatment! The words
"buyer beware" seem to take on very real significance when talking about
oil additives.

The Psychological Placebo
   You have to wonder, with the volume of evidence accumulating against
oil additives, why so many of us still buy them. That's the
million-dollar question, and it's just as difficult to answer as why so
many of us smoke cigarettes, drink hard liquor or engage in any other
number of questionable activities. We know they aren't good for us - but
we go ahead and do them anyway.
   Part of the answer may lie in what some psychiatrists call the
"psychological placebo effect." Simply put, that means that many of us
hunger for that peace of mind that comes with believing we have purchased
the absolute best or most protection we can possibly get.
   Even better, there's that wonderfully smug feeling that comes with
thinking we might be a step ahead of the pack, possessing knowledge of
something just a bit better than everyone else.
   Then again, perhaps it comes from an ancient, deep-seated need we all
seem to have to believe in magic. There has never been any shortage of
unscrupulous types ready to cash in on our willingness to believe that
there's some magical mystery potion we can buy to help us lose weight,
grow hair, attract the opposite sex or make our engines run longer and
better. I doubt that there's a one of us who hasn't fallen for one of
these at least once in our lifetimes. We just want it to be true so bad
that we can't help ourselves.

Testimonial Hype vs. Scientific Analysis
   In general, most producers of oil additives rely on personal
"testimonials" to advertise and promote their products. A typical print
advertisement will be one or more letters from a satisfied customer
stating something like, "1 have used Brand X in my engine for 2 years and
50,000 miles and it runs smoother and gets better gas mileage than ever
before. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone."
   Such evidence is referred to as "anecdotal" and is most commonly used
to pro mote such things as miracle weight loss diets and astrology.
   Whenever I see one of these ads I am reminded of a stunt played out
several years ago by Allen Funt of "Candid Camera" that clearly
demonstrated the side of human nature that makes such advertising
possible.
   With cameras in full view, fake "product demonstrators" would offer
people passing through a grocery store the opportunity to taste-test a
"new soft drink." What the victims didn't know was that they were being
given a horrendous concoction of castor oil, garlic juice, tabasco sauce
and several other foul-tasting ingredients. After taking a nice, big
swallow, as instructed by the demonstrators, the unwitting victims
provided huge laughs for the audience by desperately trying to conceal
their anguish and disgust. Some literally turned away from the cameras
and spit the offending potion on the floor.
   The fascinating part came when about one out of four of the victims
would actually turn back to the cameras and proclaim the new drink was
"Great" or "Unique" or, in several cases, "One of the best things I've
ever tasted!" Go figure.
   The point is, compiling "personal testimonials" for a product is one
of the easiest things an advertising company can do - and one of the
safest, too. You see, as long as they are only expressing some one else's
personal opinion, they don't have to prove a thing! It's just an opinion,
and needs no basis in fact whatsoever.
   On the other hand, there has been documented, careful scientific
analysis done on numerous oil additives by accredited institutions and
researchers.
   For example:
   Avco Lycoming, a major manufacturer of aircraft engines, states, "We
have tried every additive we could find on the market, and they are all
worthless."
   Briggs and Stratton, renowned builders of some of the most durable
engines in the world, says in their report on engine oil additives, "They
do not appear to offer any benefits."
   North Dakota State University conducted tests on oil additives and
said in their report, "The theory sounds good - the only problem is that
the products simply don't work."
   And finally, Ed Hackett, chemist at the University of Nevada Desert
Research Center, says, "Oil additives should not be used. The oil
companies have gone to great lengths to develop an additive pack age that
meets the vehicle's requirements. If you add anything to this oil you may
upset the balance and prevent the oil from performing to specification."
   Petrolon, Inc., of Houston, Texas, makers of Petrolon and producers of
at least a dozen other lubrication products containing PTFE, including
Slick 50 and Slick 30 Motorcycle Formula, claim that, "Multiple tests by
independent laboratories have shown that when properly applied to an
automotive engine, Slick 50 Engine Formula reduces wear on engine parts.
Test results have shown that Slick 50 treated engines sustained 50
percent less wear than test engines run with premium motor oil alone."
   Sounds pretty convincing, doesn't it?
   The problem is, Petrolon and the other oil additive companies that
claim "scientific evidence" from "independent laboratories," all refuse
to identify the laboratories that conducted the tests or the criteria
under which the tests were conducted. They claim they are "contractually
bound" by the laboratories to not reveal their identities.
   In addition, the claim of "50 percent less wear" has never been proven
on anything approaching a long-term basis. Typical examples used to
support the additive makers' claims involve engines run from 100 to 200
hours after treatment, during which time the amount of wear particles in
the oil decreased. While this has proven to be true in some cases, it has
also been proven that after 400 to 500 hours of running the test engines
invariably reverted to producing just as many wear particles as before
treatment, and in some cases, even more.
   No matter what the additive makers would like you to believe, nothing
has been proven to stop normal engine wear.
   You will note that all of the research facilities quoted in this
article are clearly identified. They have no problem with making their
findings public. You will also note that virtually all of their findings
about oil additives are negative. That's not because we wanted to give a
biased report against oil additives - it's because we couldn't find a
single laboratory, engine manufacturer or independent research facility
who would make a public claim, with their name attached to it, that any
of the additives were actually beneficial to an engine. The conclusion
seems inescapable.
   As a final note on advertising hype versus the real world, we saw a
television ad the other night for Slick 50 oil additive. The ad
encouraged people to buy their product on the basis of the fact that,
"Over 14 million Americans have tried Slick 50!" Great. We're sure you
could just as easily say, "Over 14 million Americans have smoked
cigarettes!"-but is that really any reason for you to try it? Of course
not, because you've seen the scientific evidence of the harm it can do.
The exact same principle applies here.

In Conclusion
   The major oil companies are some of the richest, most powerful and
aggressive corporations in world. They own multi-million dollar research
facilities manned by some of the best chemical engineers money can hire.
It is probably safe to say that any one of them has the capabilities and
resources at hand in marketing, distribution, advertising, research and
product development equal to 20 times that of any of the independent
additive companies. It therefore stands to reason that if any of these
additive products were actually capable of improving the capabilities of
engine lubricants, the major oil companies would have been able to
determine that and to find some way to cash in on it.
   Yet of all the oil additives we found, none carried the name or
endorsement of any of the major oil producers.
   In addition, all of the major vehicle and engine manufacturers spend
millions of dollars each year trying to increase the longevity of their
products, and millions more paying off warranty claims when their
products fail. Again, it only stands to reason that if they thought any
of these additives would increase the life or improve the performance of
their engines, they would be actively using and selling them - or at
least endorsing their use.
   Instead, many of them advise against the use of these additives and,
in some cases, threaten to void their warranty coverage if such things
are found to be used in their products.
   In any story of this nature, absolute "facts" are virtually impossible
to come by. Opinions abound. Evidence that points one direction or the
other is avail able, but has to be carefully ferreted out, and is not
always totally reliable or completely verifiable.
   In this environment, conclusions reached by known, knowledgeable
experts in the field must be given a certain amount of weight.
Conclusions reached by unknown, unidentifiable sources must be discounted
almost totally. That which is left must be weighed, one side against the
other, in an attempt to reach a "reasonable" conclusion.
   In the case of oil additives, there is a considerable volume of
evidence against their effectiveness. This evidence comes from well-known
and identifiable expert sources, including independent research
laboratories, state universities, major engine manufacturers, and even
NASA.
   Against this rather formidable barrage of scientific research,
additive makers offer not much more than their own claims of
effectiveness, plus questionable and totally unscientific personal
testimonials. Though the purveyors of these products state they have
studies from other independent laboratories supporting their claims, they
refuse to identify the labs or provide copies of the research. The only
test results they will share are those from their own testing
departments, which must, by their very nature, be taken with a rather
large grain of salt.

Sidebar: Synthetic Oils
   Whenever we talk about oil additives, the subject of synthetic oils
inevitably crops up. Actually, the tow subjects have very little to do
with each other, but since many riders seem to equate additives and
synthetics together in their minds, we will take a few lines just to
clear the air.
   Synthetic oils were originally developed for use in gas turbine
engines. In most cases they are capable of maintaining their viscosity
for longer periods of use and under much greater temperatures and
pressures than petroleum products. Commons synthetics used for engine
lubrication today are Polyalphaolefin (like Mobil 1) or Dibasic Organic
Esters (like AMSOIL). They are fully compatible with conventional oils
and can be mixed, providing their ratings match.
   Probably the best situation is a blend of synthetics and mineral oils,
such as Golden Spectro and AGIP Sint 2000. These products seem to offer
the best of both worlds in protection and extended service life. They may
cost considerably more than standard petroleum products, but they also
can be used for much longer periods between oil changes without losing
their protective capabilities.
   Synthetics and synthetic blends offer a wider range of protection than
standard petroleum products. However, it should be noted that this
extended range of protection reaches into an area of temperatures and
pressures virtually impossible to attain inside most motorcycle engines
and transmissions. In other words, if you use them, you are buying a sort
of "overkill protection." It's certainly not going to hurt anything -
it's just unnecessary. That is, unless it makes you feel better knowing
the extra protection is on board, in which case the added expense may be
well justified.
   As a basic rule of thumb, using the standard engine oil recommended by
your bike's manufacturer and changing it about every 3000 miles will
afford you all the protection you'll ever need. But if you feel better
knowing you have more protection than you need or, if you like the
extended service-life feature, there's certainly nothing wrong with using
a premium grade synthetic blend lubricant.

I replaced my bolts with some metric allen bolts which I got at the

I used a 5.5 wrench during any of this.

Yes I had this problem.  I replaced the o-ring with the Porsche part.
It was about $2.00.  I still had a small leak due to distortion of
the plastic pipe (due to my overtightening).  Since I couldn't get
a new part that day, I used a slightly thicker o-ring and that
solved the leak until I could replace the pipe.  
The plastic pipe (elbow) is about $6.00.

Get a bucket ready because a lot of coolant will come out.  Also
there is a thermostat behind the plastic elbow and be sure to
observe which way it is installed.  I would flush the coolant and
replace it if it hasn't been done in the last year.  
I have replaced water pumps on two different cars and am paranoid
about coolant / corrosion.  It is much cheaper than a water pump,
that is certain.

The power steering hose also goes thru this area and frequently leaks.
There is an updated hose which goes behind the radiator hoses
and has a new fitting.  About $30 but it cleans up the area
both in terms of leakage and clutter. An ESP part is available for this.

Also I replaced the two upper and one lower radiator hoses.  Actually
the price wasn't as bad as I thought.  Maybe $25 or $30 for the big one.

Subject: RE: Trailing arm


Bruce,

The bushings in your trailing arm can be replaced at a much lower cost
than replacement of the arm. If you are refering to the holes for the 
alignment adjustment, then there's something wrong with the nuts and
bolts used. 

The bushings for the rear arm are about $25 each. The trailing blade 
bushings run about $12 each, these are the same as a VW part. I find 
that all rubber bushings should be inspected for deterioration. The
1984/85 1/2 944 were the last to use primarially VW suspension (924S
also, front only) components.

For track events, I add the adjustment bolts for each side that the 
factory leaves off. It seems to add to the stability of the alignment.

I do not find it unusual for the bushings to wear. At the ten-year mark
you should also inspect the front rubber bushings on the a-arms and the
upper strut bearings and mounts. 

Replacement OEM bushings are under $150 for all four corners. Labor 
is a lot more than the material here, don't forget to add a good 
alignment. If you opt to do-it-yourself, you WILL need a hydraulic 
press to remove and install the trailing arm and a-arm bushings.

I DO NOT recommend plastic, delrin or solid bushings of any type for 
a street-driven car.

A novice can do the job,, as long as he has a press available. The rear
brakes will have to be disconnects, plan on having some caps handy. If
the rear axle bearings need replacement, this is a good time to do it.

Dear Porsche Friends:	
	Be careful when installing kill switches on newer cars that use
DME (Motronics) Systems. I think these include all 944 and their derivatives
, probably all 928s and all 911 (from MY84- Carreras on)

You can damage the CPUs by shorting out the coils to ground. 
Common practice was to ground one of the coil terms to ground via a switch.
This was possible on older cars with standard points.

Could also be a problem with Capacitive Discharge (CD) systems used on 
pre '84 911s.

Best bet would be to install a switch in series to one of the coil terminals
cutting juice to it. Check your wiring diagrams...

Hope this saves your CPUs or CD units!

Parts for sale (maybe)

Customer purschasing a '78 911SC for a "fun" car (odo showing 57K, but who
knows), so the surplus will be available:

3.0 engine (contingent on me being able to guarantee
compression/leakdown)--$3200

915 transaxle--$750

interior w/ white seats/door panels, black carpet (yes, factory original, the
car is Minerva Blue)--make offer

wheels, 6's and 7's w/ good Fulda tires--$400

My customer is negotiating on the price ($8500 asking), so please be patient
if you're interested. 



Also, some thoughts to clarify the obvious re: 911 chassis prep for light
competition (and lack of modification to acheive satisfactory results). 

Alignment/ride height--labor charges, can vary but expect $250.  Corner
balance?  Good question on '74-89.  Have to remove that front sway bar!
 Unless you're upgrading (and it has to be removed anyway), this is pure
labor.  I usually discuss this with the owner.

Wheels and R compound tires--shop around, let's say $650 by the time they're
mounted.  Wide wheels are nice, but I'm using a reject set of BBS modular in
16 X 6.5 and 16 X 7.5 with my car.  Going rate for bare 6's and 7's is
$300-350.  7's and 8's can range from $750 to ??? 

Check/replace/optimize suspension components:  new sport shocks ($400), sway
bars (used from a Carrera and buy new bushings ($150 total maybe), flip the
spring plate bushings side to side ($0), 930 tie rods ($125 or so)

Brakes:  basic service--resurface rotors, pack front bearings ($75);
replacing hydraulic hoses is nice ($60); brake pads of choice ($35 to $150, I
do use carbon pads).

A car set up like this can be extremely satisfying and deceptively
competitive against very modified cars.  My '79 is just slightly more
modified than the list above and basically is the equal to my heavily altered
'74.  I even managed about .5 second off of Dwight Mitchell at one event this
year with it, he took TTOD and I was 2nd.  And another of our SF area
autocrossers, Doug David, usually runs his totally stock (but with R compound
tires) high mileage '81 about .5 seconds behind me.  He's using 15" wheels,
but not the 7:31 R&P.

So I've come up with about $2200.  But when it's all said and done you have a
nicely refurbished suspension.  Do it once and it's set up for a long time.
 You also have a spare set of tires, i.e. the "good" street tires are not
beat up.

Anyone the least bit skilled can do most of this.  Add labor charges to the
tasks you can't/don't want to do. You really don't even have to do this much,
but if you do you'll have a predictable, fast, fun car.

Subject: Club race at Parade?

Apologies for those across the various ponds for which this
may not be applicable...

During our IRPCA board meeting last evening, there was a discussion 

regarding a possible proposal to PCA National to consider having a
club race at Portland Intl. during Parade next year.  Nothing has
been officially proposed yet however, research performed thusfar indicates
that the facility and support infrastructure for such an event are
more than adequate. Of course there are issues of scheduling and cost...

Since p-philes covers such a broad cross-section of Porschespace(tm),
I thought I'd do a little test survey to see what you think...

1. Is this something you or other members of your region would be
interested in? 


2. Would you be more inclined to attend Parade if there was a race?

In addition to the general membership, there was also some talk about
seeing what PCNA/Porsche A.G. might be interested in showcasing at
the event...maybe a McLaren-Porsche...;-)

Subject: Lap belts/Harnesses in 951

Greetings P'philes:

I need 2 sets of 3" 5-point cam-lock H-style harnesses (preferably used) since
I just acquired a Stable Energies harness guide bar to mount behind the rear 
seat at the optional 3-point seat-belt mounting points. I will be using the 
snap-in clips since these are not DOT approved for street use.

I looked at Simpson at Pegasus Racing: $200+.   Are there cheaper sources?  
Someone I know picked up a 5-pt Simpson at a swap meet for $25 from an SCCA 
racer whose belts had expired their 2-year req.  Does Grassroots mag advertise
these used?

I assume the harnesses go to the stock rear lap belt points but where do you 
mount the lap belts?  I'm leery of drilling holes in the rear trans tunnel.
Do you need to reinforce where you drill holes such as the floor-pan for the 
sub belt or will large washers do?

TIA,

I just called BFG (800-722-3234) and am awaiting the kit to join Team T/A.  
For others who are interested, there's no charge (to give BFG the opportunity

 Howdy,

 I'm looking at 83 911SC and I would like to have it inspected
by a good Porsche mechanic. I live in Portage Ind (about 40min
outside of Chicago) and I'm wondering if there is a good Porsche
Mechanic around NW Indiana. 

 Now a question about the car. Like I said its a 83 911 SC coupe
with 35k miles. It looks to be in good shape with some small stone
chips on the nose and a small scratch just over the right rear
tire. The car is on a used car lot and the dealer is asking
$19.9K for the car. All the books I've seen say a this car in 
excellant condition should be around 17.5K max. So am I to far 
off by not going over 16K for this car? I seen cars in the paper
from 14k-25k for the same year (but different body styles). 

I don't know if I will by this car but I am highly interested :)

Subject: 911 a-arms -> 914


Hopefully someone out there can help with this.  I'm ready to stiffen up
the suspension on my 914.  What I was considering was to get some 911 a-
arms and torsion bars and put these on in place of the stock units.

I don't want the full 911 front end for classification reasons, and I
thought the 911 a-arms might give a wider range of available bars for
a lower cost than after market 914 torsion bars.  

Also, this would be done with the later 914 suspension.

So, can this be done?  Is there a MY range to get the 911 a-arms from?
Which size torsion bars could I hope to get?  Any other suggestions?

Since a 215 is the widest tire you can fit without rolling the fender,

  $0.00  I did the 'sway bars in a day, the strut brace in about an hour

             So, 10 hours is about my time investment.  It should be no more

Even with the engine swap (you really should get the car weighed, I don't

you a class where you have a chance - the rules are really against you in 
super prod) you are probably going to have no better power to weight than 
a 3.2.  The 3.2 also has a wider track and is allowed wider wheels, both of
which are going to help it out.

By the way, if you get the car corner ballanced (strongly recommended),
they can tell you the weight if you ask in advance.

I would try moving the steering wheel with the engine off and observe
the moving parts of the steering mechanism to determine if it is the
steering rack or tie rods.

If this does not find the problem, I would jack up the car and move
the wheel/tire every which way to check for any play.  Also the 
lower ball joint and top strut bearing should be checked.  I don't
know exactly how to check these two items.  I tested the ball joint
as follows:  with the car on the ground and a floor jack under the
control arm, I placed my fingers on the joint, touching both the control
arm and the part the ball joint fits into.  I then have an assistant
slowly raise the jack and check for any change in clearance as the
weight is taken off of the wheel.  (Net-comments on this procedure
appreciated).

I would have a pressure test of the cooling system done to check for
any system leaks.  Also I think that small amount of coolant could
leak and evaporate without being real obvious where it was leaking from.
It took me a while to find some coolant leaks.  I replaced the
water pump and all major hoses.

Other than a good cleaning followed by an inspection a few weeks 
later (taking off parts necessary to see the water pump and all
coolant-carrying hoses), I don't know where else to look.
Someone already mentioned checking the oil.

Hi group,

I have a problem with my C2 fuel sender. When I started the car the other day
the fuel gauge read empty and the low fuel light came on (car had about 3/4 of a
tank). After driving for a awhile the fuel level began to rise but didn't get up
to an accurate reading. It has behaved in a similar manner ever since, sometimes
not as dramatic though. The most consistent behavior is a lower than normal
reading at start up and then it will slowly rise as I drive around but never
getting up to an accurate reading. 

I pulled the sending unit but it does not appear to have any serviceable parts.
Does anyone know if this thing can be taken apart? ('91 C2)

Thanks,

P.S. Remember when a factory manual told you how to take a part off, tear it
down, fix it and then replace it? Now components are hermetically sealed and
manuals tell you how to take the old part off and put the new one on.

"30 Years of 911 Production."  The attatched table, "911 PRODUC-

    For example, the HP ratings for the 911SC are: 180 for 1978-
79, 188 for 1980, and 204 for 1981-83.  This conflicts with info
from the factory spec books, and also (supposedly) with the info
from Bruce Anderson's book, which both list 180HP for all SCs.
    Can anyone enlighten me as to which figures are correct for
US-spec models?  Is it just because the figures in the table are
for Euro-spec cars?

Does the pedal just go all the way to the floor without resistance? Can
you pump it up at all. If you have fluid in the reservoir and you cannot
pump it up and there is no noticeable leaking, then it may be that you have
had a catastrophic master cylinder failure. I have never heard of both
circuits of a master cylinder failing simultaneously, but then again I have
never rebuilt a Porsche master cylinder.

Subject: Welding questions

Hi all,

In doing restorative work on body and floor panels, etc and some structural 
stuff, have any of you found that you really *NEEDED* a large amp MIG?  My 
bodywork teacher said if you are doing a butt weld on large (eg 1/2") steel 
plates, then all you really need to do is cut the edges at an angle and make 
several passes.  A smaller welder (110V) would be fine.

don't do this:    ------  ------     do this:   -----\     /----
                       |  |                           \   /
                       |  |                            \ /
                  ------  ------                -------- -------

                                       make a few passes and fill in
                                       the "V"

However, I seem to recall that multiple passes on stainless steel may break 
down the metal in that area too much so it'll lose its corrosion-resistance 
properties.  So, for large stainless steel plates, a large amp MIG with the 
proper gas mixture (3-part I think...different from mild steel) is what you 
need.

I'm going to be doing some stainless and mild steel work on my 914 soon and 
am starting to look for a MIG.  I've used the 4-voltage setting "economy" 
models before and wasn't too pleased - mind you, I haven't welded much more 
than about 5 feet with it.  Practise always helps!  :-)

patient tinkerer with basic tools) to remove the rear bearings from the
trailing arms?  The book suggests taking off the arms, clamping them in a
vise, and (sledge?) hammering out the bearings with a drift.  My mechanic
says that removal and vising of the trailing arms is unnecessary, but adds
that this is no curb side job.  My question (and trick up my sleeve) is, 
would the proper (and careful!!) use of freon and a propane torch ease this
task to the point of a DIY job?  Obviously, one would want to avoid warping
the arms, and the new bearings should probably get a freezer treatment 
instead of freon.

Any comments/suggestions or am I kidding myself?

Only if the cam profiles are shot, and then you have to worry about
how much is taken off, because that changes the geometry of the
cam to follower which in turns puts pressure at on odd angle on the
valve stem against the valve guide... Bottom line: best bet is to use
a good used cam if possible, new if not.

Subject: front spoiler on a older 911T

Thanks for all the replies about 72 911Ts.
It was reassuring and it fed my ego. The
thread can die now gracefully.

My next question is little lame but I need some
insight.  My daily commute (until winter sets in)
treats me to about 10 miles one way of 80+ mph driving on deserted
highway.   My car has tendency to be
little light in the front at these speeds but manageable.  I
have street tires (read hard and skinny Pirellis 185 front 
and 205 rear), turbo tie-rods and a recent four wheel
alignment. As for the suspension, the shocks are
fair but the torsion bars/ride height are set to the factory
specification. 

My question is would a tasteful stock S
spoiler significantly help in handling or should I
go for a more aggressive front spoiler?  The
main application is for speeds between 70-110 mph. A rear
whale tail is not an option. I want to maintain the stock look
to a reasonable degree but a large front spoiler is
not unreasonable.  Handling is the priority.
I do not want to create a porpoise type motion either.
I might add, my car currently has no aero aids--a 
stock sweetheart.

Suggestions?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Ted & racism

I, being a southerner and having grown up in the south, have grown 
tired of hearing people accuse others of making "racist" remarks,
when in no way are the remarks racist. Racism is generally defined
as follows:

racism--the notion that some ethnic groups or races are naturally
 superior to others.

However,  just because a statement is negative in some way toward 
a person of a particular race, does not automatically make that a
racist statement. To assume that, is not only wrong, it causes
society to grow tired of hearing false accusations and disregard ALL
alledged racism, whether it is true racism or not.

I think the statement Ted was referring to was the implication that if a 
black person were to approach someones door, he would be
presumed to be a burglar. In many parts of the country, it is a fact
that the majority of crimes are committed by black males. 
Therefore this assumption would be based on fact or probability, not
racism.  

If you want to understand what true racism is, there is a show on
HBO this month called "Southern Justice: the murder of Medger
Evers". Several self proclaimed racists were interviewed. I believe you
will come to understand the difference between "racist" remarks and
remarks that refer to a particular race.   

That said.....Let's stick to talking about Porsches and other fun toys
and leave all this politically correct bullshit to the politicians.

Subject: Caliper Dust covers


Jerry,

I assume you are reffering to the rubber bellows that seals the caliper 
piston to the caliper. This is indeed a dust cover, it helps protect the
real piston seal from brake dust and debris in normal useage. They are
very necessary if you have a dual purpose car. There is enough crud from
the pads themselves to get in and increase the friction the piston 
encounters when applied. The are needs to be free of crud to let the
piston move evenly and not jam.

Most of the racing calipers don't have these covers. They, in most 
designs, have a double set of seals. Most racing calipers are inspected 
(anyway, SHOULD be) very frequently, dispensing with the need for the 
protective covers.

I would replace them. If you are getting really high temperatures and 
they are going away, you should consider examination of the piston seals
to prevent a failure there. As I've stated to other P-filers, you should 
be doing an increase maintenance schedule if you track your car. Track
events are really fun, but they greatly accelerate wear on the brakes 
and suspension. One good weekend should be considered a 3,000 mile 
check. Inspect everything. Change the oil and filters. Inspect the 
brakes each day you run, before and after.

I have been using Cool Carbon pads on my GT-350 and 944. They work. They
also produce a lot of debris. This stuff is hot and will melt into 
clearcoated wheels. I don't know if it contributed to the shield 
problem on your car. My GT-350 has a similar dust seal design, I just 
walked out and looked at them. Those are fine, but they are only two
years old with six events on them. 

Thanks for the mention on Bob Russo. I haven't spoken to him in sometime,
his old product works very well (on my GT-350, too).

Cool Carbon pads. These are excellent as they are designed for cars weighing
over 3000lbs. I also have cool brakes and use AP 550 fluid.
A recent inspection revealed that the dust shield around the individual
pistons on the front brakes are totally wasted. What is left of them could
best be described as debris. I removed their remains.
The question is- Are they really necessary? I know that most dedicated racing

environment and the fluid is, of course, changed religiously. 
Your opinion would be appreciated.

The valve guides are not hard to remove if you know a trick. The way most
people remove them is with a special tool(a drift) that is used to drive the
guides out. The problem is that this tool pushes against the top of the guide
and causes it to mushroom. This mushroomed guide then caused the head to crack
as it is driven out. The trick way i was told is to use a tap and put threads
about a inch or so in the bottom of the guide(the end in the int/exh port) .
Then you put a bolt into the threaded guide. Put the heads in the oven at 200
deg or so. Then when the heads are warm take a long punch and drive the guides
out. Since you are hitting against the bolt inside the guide it will not cause
the guide to expand(instead the guide will actually be streched). The person
who told me this trick said they had not cracked a head this way.

Funny you should ask.  I recently had to buy some tires for
track use in a rush and was forced to get XGTVs.  I found
these tires to give the car a very unstable feeling. They
seem to have much softer side walls than the tires that
I normally use which are Yokohama AVSi.  The AVSi perform
quit well on the track.  I am competitive with people who
use DOT approved race tires (A008 and BFG R1).  Also the AVSi
are substantially less expensive than most other good quality
sport tires.

Subject: Corner balancing follow-up


Folks,

I've had some time to research this corner balance thing a little bit
and this is what I found out.

Ideally, you want even weight on all four tires. However, rarely do you
have a car, especially a production car, that has even weight distribution
front to rear and right to left. Because of this, it makes it very difficult
to corner balance a car's weight evenly and maintain appropriate ride height
settings.

So, you have to make weight distribution comprises when corner balancing a
car. These comprises include setting up the car so weight distribution is
off center both front to rear and left to right. Let's take my car as an
example. It weighs 2771 pounds without gas but with me in the driver's
seat. The corners weigh in as follows:

LF: 544 lbs.
RF: 491 lbs.
LR: 898 lbs.
RR: 838 lbs.

If you add up the numbers and do some calculations, you will see that the
weight distribution is 37% front, 63% rear, 52% left, 48% right. These
numbers are what we get with ride height set properly. "Properly" means
the ride height is about the same left front to right front and left rear
to right rear.

One thing I found out is that even though you have to make comprises front
to rear and left to right, you must get the diaganols (LF/RR and RF/LR) to
come out even. If we use my car's corner weights again, you will see that
the LF + RR = 1382 lbs. and RF + LR = 1388 lbs. This is about as good as
it gets. If the diagonals match up, the car is as balanced as it can be
considering the actual weight distribution of the car.

What is the bottom line of this?  I discovered along the way that that
you cannot approach corner balancing from a theoretical position. The
world is not perfect and you have to make compromises. If you are lucky
and smart, you make the correct compromises.

One final comment:

If you could balance the car so all four corners carried the same weight
AND you could set the ride height properly, you would want to do this.
Even if the car is like mine and has weight distribution of 37% front,
63% rear, 52% left, 48% right. This just is not possible.

the motor mounts or related parts.

With respect to the motor mounts, I've seen several 911's in the course
of the last year develop weird and sudden shifting problems.  Two were
traced to rear motor mount bolts or nuts which had backed out.  Another
was due to a fractured rear carrier, a Carrera's which failed at one
of the welds.

No guarantees...

You don't say whether you've modified the suspension in any way, such
as springs or sway bars.  There are a lot of things which can go clunk,
and it's kind of impossible to diagnose electronically!

Check the oil to make sure it isn't bleeding into it via a failed oil/
water heat exchanger seal.  Very popular failure mode in 944S.  Look
for coffee-and-cream coloured foam on your dipstick.

Could be a bad head gasket, but they are pretty darn rare failures in
the normally-aspirated cars.  There was a tech bulletin on cracking
water jackets in the heads of the 944S and 928S4.  Have your mechanic
check it out.  But don't panic yet.  It may well be something quite
benign, like a seeping/leaking hose which you have overlooked.

Yep, moved to the front of the heater pipe for the 944S/2.  Remained
at the back of the pipe and over the clutch bell for the 944 and 951.
And yes, you should see the arm coming out of the diaphragm pivot

Allan,

The really experienced pro's seem to favour the +/- 200AMP 'industrial' 
machines.

You should not use multiple run to weld heavy gauge steel either, the 
penetration will be poor.

The ARC welder are perfect for this.

If you use the MIG/MAG for those purposes you will stress the machine too, 
and burn a lot of 'jets' and 'mouthpiece'.

Get this weeks issue of AutoWeek.  It says 993 C-4 is 0.1 sec slower

I suggest a subscription to AW (you'd enjoy it!)  Hint!

Same issue mentions that a member of AW test team, who shall remain 
nameless, setting the fastest time thru the 450 ft slalom of any car 
ever tested by AW including new turbo supra and twin turbo RX-7.  

They attribute this superior skill to the man's previous Stuttgart
factory experience, combined with his having owned a 911.  We all
know differently, and attribute it to the many tips on proper tires,
wheels, and the myriad other 911 secrets he's picked up on Porschephiles 
from the world's master Curb-Surfer.

Hi Jason,

No, but I did have these tires on a lesser car and I really liked them
for dry weather performance.  Tread life was about 25K, all street.

I do prefer the Dunlop D40 M2's for the 944.  Excellent tire. 

For the track, unless you cannot run them because of your rules,
I highly recommend a tire such as the Yokohama A008R or similar
tire.  I used street tires for my first 3 events and pretty much
wrecked the fronts on two sets of tires.  The track tires are
and investment since you will probably want another set of wheels,
but I recommend this for serious (more than once or twice a year)
track driving.

Northstar Motorsports (1-800-356-2080) has a good variety of safety equip-
ment, including Simpson.  I bought a 5-pt Simpson with all hardware
for under $200.  I also got the Stable Energies B-pillar bar.  I wish that
the B-bar was offset a bit more to the rear to allow for more seat 
clearance however.

Yes on the shoulder belts to rear lap belt points, although the hardware
seems to be 7/16 and not 11mm.  It is very close and it worked for me, 
but I would like a source of 11mm eye bolts if anyone knows of one.

I used one of the eyebolts to fasten the factory lap belt in the 
stock location (lower left for drivers side, that is)  and attached
the 5-pt left side lap belt to this eyebolt.  My aftermarket
seat bracket has a receptacle on the right side, which I used to hold both 
the factory seat buckle and the right side lap belt.  The crotch belt
is mounted to the seat bracket.

Are you using a seat with belt cutouts?  I don't recommend using the
factory seat with the 5-pt harness unless you do something to prevent
the shoulder straps from spreading apart.  I have seen a strap which
connects the two shoulder straps just behind the seat for this purpose.
Net comments?

I would probably not fasten the lap belts with washers if I could avoid
it, but I think the crotch belt would be ok with washers since the
potential load is smaller.

   Since Kill switches were invented when fuel pumps were driven off the
 cam, the better alternative for fuel injected cars is often overlooked;

    Kill the fuel pump ! Don't touch the ignition !

   Especially since there is already a fuse and wiring handy in the dash
 (911s of course need to come thru the firewall), you don't need to inject a
 whole lot of wiring if you, for instance, wire up the fog light switch
 (assuming you don't have them installed) to turn on the fuel pump. The       
 hardest thing is positioning the switch somewhere inconspicuous, and making
 sure its connected well enough not to come loose on bumpy road....
   I had another friend who always exited his 924 with fuel pump fuse in hand.
 Still another guy who always took along his coil wire. The kill switch is
 easier.

IMHO, you can't do it with basic tools at home with trailing arms on the
car.  Although maybe someone else knows a way.  I couldn't do it, but my
mechanic once long ago did it with the arms on the car.  I should have asked
what tool he used.  Performance Products shows a tool for ~$250 that claims
to do it, but seems expensive unless you plan on doing the job several
times.

Hi gang,

    It's wheel bearing time for the ol' 914.  Is it possible (i.e. by the
patient tinkerer with basic tools) to remove the rear bearings from the
trailing arms?  The book suggests taking off the arms, clamping them in a
vise, and (sledge?) hammering out the bearings with a drift.  My mechanic
says that removal and vising of the trailing arms is unnecessary, but adds
that this is no curb side job.  My question (and trick up my sleeve) is, 
would the proper (and careful!!) use of freon and a propane torch ease this
task to the point of a DIY job?  Obviously, one would want to avoid warping
the arms, and the new bearings should probably get a freezer treatment 
instead of freon.

Any comments/suggestions or am I kidding myself?

 9/15/94       7:59 AM        Subject:    Re: 944 odometer
I had a similar experience with a 944 odometer with the first Porsche that I
purchased from a dealer.  It was an 83 944 with supposedly only 33K miles on
it (in 1987).  However, when I turned over the first 1000 miles it rolled
over from 33k to 44k (instead of 34k).  This made me suspicious, so I started
looking for service records.  I got service records from the service
department of the same dealer that sold me the car and they showed that the
car had 37k miles on it two years earlier.   I confronted the sales
department and they denied everything, until I showed them the service
records from their own service department,  then they "looked into it".  
They determined that somehow there was an "oversight"  and when they had
taken the car in the speedometer was broken and they sent it out to have it
"fixed".  Anyway, I ended up getting a full refund for the car 5 months after
I bought it.   So my experience with 944 odometers says that if it is acting
funny it may have been tampered with.  If you just bought the car you might
want to look into it.

Just went through this on a car I just sold.  The 'fresh air'
fan (in the engine compartment) is controlled by the switch between
the seats.  Usually that switch has a red handle.  It was pointed
out to me that the switch grounds the power line going to it to turn
the fan on.  Mine was not doing that.  I had already checked/replaced
the relay on the relay board in the engine compartment for the fan
and had wired the fan directly to the battery to make sure that
it worked.

Hope this helps.

The factory manual I have read indicates that the bore of the valve guide
is first drilled out to a much wider diameter - this greatly reduces the
amount of force required to drift out the guide. I do rather like the
idea of tapping threads, putting a bolt in, and driving out the valve
guide against the bolt, rather than the top of the guide itself.

You've got a need for 1/2" steel plate on a porsche?  This must one of those
very rare and highly prized industrial porsches with the optional backhoe
attachment.

Seriously, do not weld heavy structural components with inadequate equipment
and techniques.  Multiple pass welds will not be as strong as a single pass
welds (poor weld penetration and increased heat stress in the stock).  A
component that relies on a weak weld is just a cleverly disguised broken
part.  Assuming your application requires 1/2" stock for the strength, then
you want your weld to be as strong as the rest of the stock.  This is
especially true of safety components where failure can mean injury or death.

We had a similar problem occurring intermittently and eventually ended up
rotating one of the selector shaft forks on the 3rd/4rth shaft by forcing it
into gear once too often (what can I say, it was during our runs at Cincy
Parade -- missed third 3 times in a row and *still* got my fastest time]).
 Anyway, after we had the trany rebuilt, we were still having problems with
quick 2nd to 3rd shifts, often hitting first (ouch]) or fifth, or feeling
like the shifter was hitting a wall and not going into any gear.  I replaced
things like the shift coupler and the nylon socket at the bottom of the
shifter and spent many hours adjusting the coupler -- all to no avail.

I finally found the bushing in the tunnel that the shift rod rides thru
(between the shifter and shift coupler) had gone bad -- I had replaced this
bushing with an after market one from AutoMotion, and it was made out of
inferior material.  The shift rod needs to *pivot* at this point and the
worn bushing allowed the rod to move sideways -- so locating third was
chancy at best...  You have to remove your shift lever and housing assembly
to access the tunnel and get to the bushing I'm referring to.  BTW: I used a
factory part this time -- it appears to be a nylon material -- much more
durable feeling than the Automotion one.

Other things to check:

Ball socket at the bottom of shift lever
Alignment of shift coupler
Locating fork attached to inspection plate of trany (these have been known
to bend and/or break)

By all means don't do what we did and drive it until it does something more
serious...

Subject: Hard to find 914 part

First, thanks for all the help with the 914 fan and heater questions.

Here's an interesting 914 2.0L problem:

When the car is cold, an Aux Air Regulator (AAR) part #022 906 045, is open
to allow air to go from point A to point B, and the engine idles faster. Once
the electric lead to the AAR causes the electrics inside to 'turn on,' a valve
closes, and the air stops...this happens just about when the engine is hot 
enough to idle correctly.

Our  914 has a stuck open AAR.These parts are no longer made. I have ordered,
very carefully, from several sources, including Stoddards, replacements. Either
i've gotten the incorrect 022 906 045a for the 1.8L, or broken used ones not 
tested. (at least Stoddards knew what was going on: Their box was mislabeled)

Jay of PartsWerks hadn't tested his...he is now testing his whole box full
to see if he can find one working one for me (He seems like a nice guy, hope
he can find a working part). Otto's et al in California tell me that they
wish someone would either (a) Start making these again or (b) find a warehouse
full, since if the 914 isn't driven for a while these 20 yr old parts freeze
up...and they cannot get them at all. A trick is to fill em with WD40 and
wack with a hammer...that didn't work for us.

I have the line plugged with a marble. It idles badly until it's warm. I hope
it idles at all in winter. Better than always idling at 1800 rpm...at least for now.

Anyone have a spare one of these? Stan: Could you check with your sources in
Houston again? Maybe one of them would turn something up. Anyone have any 
ideas where i might find one?  

thanks

This fits the definition of prejudice.

prejudice 1a An adverse judgement or opinion formed beforehand or without
knowledge or examination of the facts. b. A preconceived preference or idea;
bias. 2. The act or state of holding unreasonable preconceived judgments or
convictions. 3.Irrational suspicion or hatred of a particular group, race,
or religion.

Do you not think that this would be prejudicial if you do not know the 
black person in question? I for one am tired of being presumed a burglar.
It really gets to one when this S**T has propagated to this list. I can ignore
this thread no longer and as "a black male" I must inform you of MHO. 

Let me tell you of an incident which happened to me, which typifies my 
view. I was returning to college after spring break in my '74 Carrera. I 
had just completed a total restoration of the car and it looked magnificent
(Yellow w/ black Carrera script on the sides). Traveling from New York
to Massachusetts was always a pleasure in this car. This partular time, while
travelling through Connecticut, a white male in his mid 20's pulled along
side the vehicle. He started gesturing that he liked the car. I thought
nothing of it, becuause I often received such gestures and comments. The only
thing which was different this time was that he seemed very emphatic about it.
I dismissed him as being "just an excitable individual". He then motioned for
me to pull over. 

My naivety, led me to do so. I pulled over, he started asking me questions about 
the car, and I answered them. He then asked me if I wanted to 'do some lines of 
coke' . No was was my answer. He then asked me if I could score a major buy of
coke for him. I said no I don't do drugs. I asked him why he thought I would be
able to supply this contraband. He replied , "Well, I thought you were connected
because you look like a connected guy!" I asked him what that meant specifically.
He said I looked connected because I had money and I was black!. I hate this
crap.

Am I now to infer that all whites are like this person? 
 
Granted, many undergraduate college students can't afford to pay cash for a 
restored Carrera. Most are worrying about tuition payments. That wasn't the case 
for me. I didn't fit the preconcieved notion that I could have actually obtained
my car legally, never mind be in college. 

I've been asked by people where I used garage my car 'If I was somebody famous,
i.e. a football player'. I haven't even mentioned the numerous times I've been 
stopped by the police. One of the most ridiculous stops by the police was by the 
New Jersey State police for having my license plate tilted 20 degrees.

I disagree with this statement about "true racism ". At least these people had the
conviction to stand up for what they believed in. They didn't pull any punches. I
would have known where I stood with them.  The racism which I find to be the most
frustrating is the kind I have demostrated above. People who claim they have 
liberal attudes towards race, yet they are quick to stereotype individuals of a
particular race. The people which practice this insidious racism are far more
frustrating  than the overt ones. The insidous type have no intestinal fortitude
to stand up for what they believe in, no matter how warped!

I'm not sure who started this thread, Olson, Albrecht, or Matsumura but please 
let it die. Were you so sure there were no people of color who were on this list
much less owned a Porsche? For now I drive an '83 944 as well as 5 other legally

Subject: Re: Kill Switches


  Regarding several people's query on a kill switch:

  Do NOT wire up a kill switch into ANY car's ignition system or fuel
pump!

  Years ago, when I was working as a car stereo/alarm installer, I've
been warned about a common practice of grounding the wire leading to 
the coil.  The problems with this method are:

1) Possible damage to computer controlled ignition system.
2) If someone unaware or forgot about the kill switch and continue to 
   crank the car over, the kill switch/wire can heat up to the point
   where it will catch on fire. 
3) If murphy strike (and he does), you will suddenly find yourself in
   a disabled car.  Could be interesting if this happened while you are
   driving.

  
  Note that I'm not taking responsibility for anyone who want to try the
following method.  Take it only as a suggestion and use your own judgement.
This is the way most car alarms handle ignition kill.

  A safer and more reasonable method to install a kill switch is to 
use a relay (our shop always use the heavy-duty Bosch relay) to open
the connection between the ignition switch and the starter.

  The wire leading from the ignition switch to the starter can usually be
found in the wire loom coming out of the ignition switch.  This is 
usually a heavy gauge wire that *only* have current flow while the key
is held in the "cranking" position.  

  This method is CPU safe (Until the day starters are also computer
controlled), and will not have problems with over heated switches (as long
as a heavy duty relay is used), and definitely will not shut down a car
while it is running. 

  When in doubt, let a car alarm specialist handle it.

Thanks for the quick responses.  Racer's Wholesale does have 5-pt camlock TRW 
Sabelt at clearance prices of $89 ($109 incl. clip-on hardware) limited to 
available stock. I got them at 1-800-326-0372 and this location is in GA 
(outside Atlanta?).   

However, I have more questions:

1. For the lap-belt, do I get the pull-ups 32"-62" or pull-downs 25"-52"?  I'd
like to get the pull-ups since these includes the snap-in already but are  
they too long to mount conveniently in the 951?  

2. They only have the Y-type shoulder harnesses left.  Can you use this in a 
944 since the headrests are integrated?  With the Y-type, can you still mount 
the harness bar behind the rear seats at the C-pillars or does it need more 
support closer to the 2 'arms' of the Y?  Where do you mount this?  Somewhere 
in the hatch area, centerline of the front seat is my assumption.  I'd like to
know where you can drill safely.

3. If sub-belt is mounted permanently, does it impede seat movement?

I'm seeking info from anyone who has installed these before in a similar car 
so I don't order the wrong equipment.

P-files,

Does anyone have experience, or a "scientific" explanation for the folling
new and heavily advertised items:

   1. Performance 911 Ltd. : POWERBOX
Looks like some type of fuel accumulator that is supposed to eliminate turbo
lag in your 951 and dramatically improve HP at ALL throttle settings in your
911 for a mere $695 !

   2. JL Engineering : More power for your 951
300-320 HP: airfilter, super coil etc
375 HP : new turbo, Power Flow Air Intake, Boost Control
400 + HP : coming soon.

  3. JD Enterprises : The Fanguard
Conversion of the fan/AC belts to a single multigroove belt. Supposedly less
friction and easier maintenance.


Thanks !

Subject: Lap Belts/Harnesses for 951

I have the Simpson Cam-Lock and Stable Energies harness bar combo in my '86 
951. The bar is mounted to the stock rear shoulder harness mounting points 
(D-pillar?) due to the fact that I eat too much and have my seat pushed all 
the way back. I did not have rear shoulder harnesses and needed 2 
additional mounting bolts that can be gotten from Stable Energies for $10. 
Two harness straps (for the shoulders) are attached to the bar itself only. 
The sub strap is drilled into the floor pan with washers. The other 2 
straps (lap) are drilled into the transmission tunnel and the floor pan 
next to the door sill. I have a stock seat. My recommendation is not to use 
the stock seat. Leather is quite slippery, and tends to wear at the point 
where the cross-piece on the Simpson belt touches the seat. Safety requires 
that the harness be tight enough to deform the seat padding. I also think 
that the crosspiece is too wide and might let you slip out in an accident. 
I would get a lightweight adjustable racing seat that has the appropriately 
spaced cutouts. At that point, you can use any harness, not just Simpsons 
(which are high quality, but not the cheapest or the easiest to find.) My 
Simpsons were $130 or $230 each new from the mechanic who installed them. 
Sorry, don't remember. Installation of the bar and harness was about $100. 
I couldn't bear to drill into my car myself. I am not sure what you mean by 
harness snap in clips for street use, but all original belts are functional 
and in the car for street use, since I can't reach my CD player when I'm 
harnessed in:) I wouldn't bother with used harnesses. They usually look 
doggy, and who knows what sort of wear or damage they have been subjected 
to. I live in Staten Island and work in Jersey City, if you want to inspect 
the installation yourself. Of course, any track event will allow you to see 
many similar installations.

No 16's or 17's for instance

Projects -415-453-7719 They still have RE71R for $75, and are expecting 
another big shipment (same price) by next week. The closest sizes to the

BTW, do you know if PCA will allow those with other licenses to enter

Subject: Re: front spoiler on a older 911T

Well...Since you asked...

Your body style is the same as my '77, so you will first want to get some 
wider tires up front, before that, the spoiler will do little.

I am not sure what size wheels you have, but even if stock 15x5.5" you 
could probably put 195/60/15" tires on there, but 205/50 would be even 
better with min. 6" wide rim.

Now if you do get a front spoiler, you may also need to get a rear 
spoiler and vice versa, however a mild narrow body front should not cause 
problems at up to 110 mph, with the above wide tires.  Also, be sure to 
get a RUF or some type that allows for oil cooling should you opt for a 
nice oil cooler there sometime.

That's it, any other questions?

Discontinued, however there are two versions of the A008 RS, one for

That means 50 or 80% life expectancy of a normal street tire.

Ted,

If you can't tell if it has an engine, I'd recommend skipping the deal,
no matter what it costs.  Beat up 356 coupes range from wonderful to
totally unrestorable.  You or a mechanic have to size the the rust and
a mechanical condition.  Then you can gamble anywhere from $ 500 to
$ 10k on the beast.  You probably won't like it, though.  It is
vastly underpowered as measured by your proclaimed standard.  It has
the oversteer of swing axles that gave Ralph Nader his claim to fame.
BUT it is the ORIGINAL PORSCHE !!!

Rust removal, paint, chrome, etc... can cost big bucks if you decide
you like it.

A VW engine is probably unnecessary.  There are plenty of good Porsche
engines available .. they last longer than the bodies.

thought quick acceleration was an active safety feature, like stopping
quickly and turning quickly, other things Porsches are known for. And then my
30+ years of no-accident driving. Got a letter back from something called a
Regional Vice President (wouldn't you like responsibility for regional vice?)

In fairness, State Farm has been pretty decent during my Porsche years. When
my '84 Targa was stolen, the settlement was good enough to put me in an '88

I did some checking last night about this and I found out that the general 
"rule of thumb" for amperage ratings is to use 1 amp for every .001 inches of 
thickness.  So the 1/2" example I gave would theoretically require a 500 amp 
welder.  Hmmmm.....

In industrial applications, multiple passes aren't evil, since a proper 
fillet weld must have "legs" that are the thickness of the stock.  If you 
were welding a "T" made from 1 inch steel, the 2 welds that you'd make must 
be 1 inch wide at the top and 1 inch tall at the side.  No more, no less.  I 
doubt you could make that weld in a single pass.  If you know what you're 
doing, multi-pass welds work, and work well.  If you don't know what you're 
doing, neat things may happen! (I got this info from an expert master welder.)

If you are in a situation where you *MUST* weld something that is larger than 
your welder, you can get more penetration by changing to a different 
technique like "dragging" the bead instead of the conventional "pushing" and 
your wire feed placement will help too.  More CO2 in the gas mixture will 
also help you....although not for stainless steels.  And of course, your 
travel speed affects this as well.

The optimum gas mixture in GMAW with stainless is 90% helium, 7.5% argon, and 
2.5% CO2.  If you use this "tri-mix", multiple passes will not destroy the 
corrosion resistance properties.  Regular mild steel would probably like 75% 
argon, 25% CO2.  (These are with the short-circuiting method of welding, not 
spray or globular transfer.)

I discovered one thing last night....MIG welding (or more correctly called 
GMAW), is definitely a complicated issue.  In order to obtain textbook 
perfect welds, you must know all about and be able to adjust about a dozen 
different things (voltage, wire feed speed and size, slope, inductance, gun 
angle, travel speed, gas mixtures, misc gun techniques, weld bead dimensions, 
joint construction, and other stuff I've forgotten).  Voltage is not normally 
that adjustable on smaller machines, and variable slope and inductance are 
not usually available on those - you just live with what has been preset.

Hmmmm.....

Jim,

So you recomend changing the oil and filter after a track event.
Do you also put in clean oil before?

It'ss just a toy to drive on those rare sunny Morgantown, WV days.  I'd
like to drive it more often if I could get it to where I could trust it. 
So far, I've had a lot of fun with it.  I sit in it in my garage, turn on

Subject: 914 rear wheel bearing R&R.  'kyle style'

 Brent, and Porschephiles;

  Jeez, you guys are always doing things the hard way.

  I'm gonna share this little gem with y'all.
  To Wit;

  I did both my rear wheel bearings MYSELF! in my backyard, with NO
presses.  Its easy if you got the right weapons...and attitude.

  Tools needed:  air die grinder (>20,000 rpm).
                 1mm thick cutting wheel and mandrel to fit grinder.
                 hammer, chisel.
                 freezer, and a lamp.

  Procedure:
             -with the 'hub' in your hand..
 take the die grinder with the 1mm cutting wheel and place a cut
at diagonal across the outer bearing race.  Cut the race off, or at
least cut a deep groove that the chisel can grip and you can whack
it with the hammer.  (races are brittle) remove the outer bearing
remains.  (expect a half hour of grinding)

 take the die grinder and cut the inner race at TWO diagonals that
intersect at the deepest point of the race (near the flange).
 BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO NICK THE HUB SHAFT!!!  examine the cut..
 Cut with the grinder until the cutting wheel bottoms out or cant go
further while trying to remove a small segment from the race.
 
 Whack with the hammer and chisel at the now wounded race.  The race
should either shatter or separate (split) and now the remains can
be removed from the hub without a press. Clean/crocus the shaft.
 
             -with hub de-bearing'd...
 place the hub/shaft in the freezer for 30 minutes to chill.
 place the bearing on a 60 watt bulb (a droplite works ok) to heat.
 after heating/chilling fetch the hub and place it flange down and
lubricate the shaft.  place the bearing on the shaft and press down
until bottoms, some of the distance may have to be forced with a 
hammer and block of wood, but it WILL work.  BT,DI,2X.

  -my story;  Last time I did this in may '94 I took it to the shop
that helped me do the ones on my '73.  They broke the press's
forks in doing so (nearly whacking the operator in the process) and
refused to do it again.  So I was on my own for getting Saga's done.
  You get the bane or benefit of my experience.

  I'd do it again -no sweat!

I don't have any spares (hell, if they're that rare, I'll move them from
the shop to the bank box...), but I'll do better than just checking around:
I'll call contacts at Bosch that can give me the air flow apeture and
thermostrip info on that unit. There has to be *something* out there
that uses a similar unit.

I had to do this on my Euro 911SC for which the right aux air regulator
is no longer available. I wound up with a mid-80s 930 part. Works good,
lasts long time, as the line goes...

Executive summary: you can no longer do this for any reasonable amount
money as of the late 80s. In fact, you can't do it at all for some cars.

My understanding is that this is basicly a "Rising Rate Regulator". It 
give you more fuel pressure under load and at high RPMs to so that you
flow more fuel, and hence can *burn* more fuel for more power. Sort of
like the old vacuum operated secondaries on progressive carbs, except it
doesn't help with the air flow problem...

If this is correct, then you're better off with the Microdynamics part
which is only about $400.

If it isn't then it's a Cash Flow Device i.e. it's a MUCH better deal
for the seller than the buyer. There are *LOTS* of them out there,
because **REAL** significant, verifiable performance gains cost
serious money, and lots of people who don't know any better are perfectly
willing to pay large but not quite serious money for "bolt-on" performance
gains.

Uh-huh. Ever change the serpentine belt on a Ford 5.0??? Plus if your
A/C belt goes, well too bad because it's also your fan/alternator belt
on the 911. In my opinion, you need a kill switch to cut off the juice

Subject: Re: 911 Oil Coolers

Todd, 
  Everyone seems to have their own opinion on oil coolers.  I've gotten 
maybe 10 different ones.  My mechanic who I trust a lot doesn't believe 
in anything but the original ones made by Porsche, fit in fender on 
Carerras, and are very expensive.  Used ones are risky since they may 
have debris in them from when the car died.  

Someone suggested a Mazda rx-7 retrofit with aeroquip lines.

Got a suggestion or two for Terbatrol for street use, but not track.

Got a suggestion for Lemke (sp?) fender cooler from an autoxer who never 
gets above 180 with 3.0l and '76 body.

Most track users seem to use one or two, either one big one in the center 
of the front of the car with a spoiler just for it, like the RUF style, 
or dual fender ones.

Be sure to use high grade metal tubing, and aeroquip fittings as pressure 
and temps get very high.

I'm interested in trying a Mocal, Lemke, or RX-7 as my temps hit 230 or 
so on hot days, and I'm worried about getting stranded on 237 with Pete 
A. fixing his cracked steel wheels in the middle of the road... as the 
other alternatives require a $300+ spoiler.

I have found out through replies that the commercial I have mentioned
above was indeed a 951, which was run in 1987. There is also another
spot that used Alice Coopers "Schools Out" as the music track. It was
an ad to get people to take a free driving class with skip Braber,
that is if they purchased a new 951. It has been a while since I have
seen these spots. Does any one have or know where I can get a copy of 
these 951 spots? I would really enjoy seeing them. 944 and other model
porsches would be great to view too.

Subject: How Many 356 Cars?



While answering several recent posts from "born-again" 356 lovers wanting to
search for a 356 model Porsche, I began to wonder just how many are still
out there. So, armed with much conflicting data gleaned from my meager
library, here's the "facts."

How Many Cars Were Made, 1950 - 1965?
There's no agreement on how many 356 cars were manufactured: Ludvigsen says
76,303 (pg. 283, "Excellence Was Expected"); Professor Ferry Porsche says
78,000 (pg. 218, "We At Porsche"); Brett Johnson  says 79,466 if you add all
chassis numbers he presents (pg. 134, "The 356 Porsche"); and, Harry Pellow
says 78,282 (pg. 315, "Murphy Is My Copilot"). You can also determine from
the table in Johnson's book how many were produced each year by body style
(e.g., Coupe, Cabriolet, etc.). A note of caution here. The table is
arranged by year of manufacture, not by model year. Around October, Porsche
usually began production of cars for the following model year.

How Many Came To The U.S.?
It's even less clear how many 356 cars made it to our shores. During the
first 10 years, export production for all foreign markets grew from 17
percent in 1950 to 73 percent in 1960, and the number of foreign markets for
Porsche also grew from 9 in 1950 to 46 in 1960 (PANORAMA, January 1981).
It's not clear what portion of this export production in each year was
intended for the U.S. market. While in later years our market accounted for
a substantial portion of Porsche production, this was not true in the
beginning. According to Ludvigsen, Max Hoffman received three cars in 1950
(pg. 77), 32 cars in 1951, and in 1954 a whopping 588 cars (pg. 106), 31
percent of all 1954 production. By 1959, the U.S. market accounted for 2,800
cars, 40 percent of Porsche production (Ludvigsen, pg. 181). In addition to
export production, many 356 cars made it to the U.S. when servicemen
returned after a European tour of duty.

How Many Still Survive?
This gets even more murky. I started with the tables beginning on page 312
of Pellow's "Murphy" book (Version A). While the data presented here on the
number of cars produced each year may not be entirely correct (minor
discrepancies on chassis numbers with Johnson's table), it's never-the-less
a good starting point. Pellow calculated the number of cars produced each
year, 1950 - 1965, and then applied an annual "survival rate" of .94 to
determine how many still existed world-wide at the time of his book's
publication in 1983. His estimate of "survivors" by 1983 was 20,897, or 27
percent of all 356 cars made.

Using Pellow's 6 percent per year "death rate" for 356 cars, I extended the
data through 1994 and estimated that only 10,580 cars exist in the world
today including 7,486 Coupes, 163 Hardtops, 1,984 Cabriolets, 422
Speedsters, and 525 Convertible D/Roadster models. If you applied an
arbitrary factor of 40 percent (exports to the U.S. in 1959) for all years,
then the number in this country today would shrink to 4,232. That number of
U.S. survivors seems low. For example, Pellow put 1983 356 Registry
membership at 3,000 so maybe the "death rate"  for years after 1983 should
be lower on the premise that, by then, 356 owners were better at protecting
their investment, fewer crash casualties occurred because of fewer miles
driven, and restoration firms were re-claiming cars that otherwise would
have "died." Also, today the vast majority of surviving 356 cars are located
in the U.S. judging from current efforts by foreign Porschephiles,
especially those in Germany, to "import" surviving 356 cars from the U.S.

So, the big question remains, what is a reasonable "survival rate" for each
year, and what percentage of the world-wide "survivors" exist today in the
U.S.? Who knows. Start with 78,000 and your estimates are as good as any.

Still, it makes for great 356 conversation using Pellow's data extended
through 1994, and applying the percentage of body styles produced each year
(from Johnson's book) against the estimated 1994 survivors. For example,
today you can find only:

150 Speedsters manufactured in 1955;
29 Cabriolets manufactured in 1952;
381 Coupes manufactured in 1961;
260 Roadsters manufactured in 1960;
12 Hardtops manufactured in 1962;
2 Speedsters manufactured in 1959;
1,438 Coupes manufactured in 1964;

and so forth and so on. Any thoughts out there? Informed guesses by return
mail greatly appreciated.

Subject: oh shit with my 911

Slightly amusing story (it wasn't at the time).  I'm still a little
nervous about my recently assembled engine even though it's running
fine after 500 miles.  Last Tuesday on the way to the airport pulling
off the exit ramp I heard a thump from the rear end, I looked in the
mirror and didn't see anything in the road but assumed I had hit some
debris (the highway near the airport is an a perpetual construction
zone).  Didn't notice anything strange at the time.  Got back from Philly
on Wednesday evening and walked to my car - there was a river of oil
stretching from the back of my car, across the lot and down a drain.

Heart - THUMP, pause.....
Brain - You you threw a rod you dumbass !

Turns out I must have hit some debris which cut the large rubber oil
hose which runs from the oil tank to the oil cooler.  Lucky I did it
as I was getting off the highway, and not onto it !  Over a period of
about 36 hours it had let about 3 quarts of oil drain into the parking
lot which everyone was driving through.  Pity the poor bastards who
have to clean that mess up !

made by Toro at the Home Depot. (Must be the racing division of Toyo tire -
"R" probably indicates race.)

The drivers also seem to wear those heavy full face helmets that are frowned
upon. Gee, bet that raises their center of gravity too. I figure the trick set
up here would be to get a low drag lightweight helmet. Maybe Schwinn.
Wonder if they're rated SA or M....

Sorry, I'm getting giddy....

There were several articles in Excellence Magazine that may help you:
Jun 1992 - What you can buy for $12000 or less (early 944) 
Feb 1993 - Review of water-pumpers

These I got from the net wisdom (I haven't read them)

Things to watch for:

Water pump - about a $7-900 bill to replace
Timing belts (probably should be replaced every 30K and tensioned every 
10K).

The 85 1/2 and newer 944 have a better suspension and much
nicer interior.  You should be able to find an 85/2 for about $7-8K
if that suits your needs.

Don't feel bad, when my wife bought a big american "sports car" a few 
years ago, most insurance companies would not even offer her coverage so 
she had to go to one of those places that takes anybody and pay about 4 
times what I was paying.  The insurance was about 1/2 the car payment.

The reasoning for the cost was that most of the people that drove that 
car were prone to accidents, so you must be too.  I thought it was a bit 
stupid.  (The car was a 1990 Camaro RS, and no I had no influence over 
her when she bought it)

Subject: Front spoiler on 911T

Bill, 

I have a '73 T that I had a split S spoiler put on (fiberglass type,
the shop really bitched about it to. I think that was a previous thread,
but I digress). The spoiler seems to help a bit, but on my drive to 
and from work here in LV there are a couple of spots that funnel
the wind to make significant crosswinds, in which case I usually slow
to under 70. Without significant winds tho, the spoiler has kept it 
reasonably stable. Since this is a subjective measurement, I don't 
know how much is due to spoiler, but I perceive an improvement.

I know that you were referring to MIG welding, but your statement is
just a bit too blanket-sounding. For arc welding, particularly of thick
stock, there are welding rods available for which multi-pass is recommended.
The MG Weld book lists quite a few of these.

No, that isn't what it means.

It is very hard to use a generality on treadwear ratings. A
normal street tire to me has a treadwear rating of 160 and lasts
for ~15K miles. A normal street tire for others (ie, not this
crowd) may well have a treadwear of 320-360 and last for
~40K-80K miles.

The treadwear rating is derived from tests which have very
little basis in reality for the performance tire crowd. (IMHO)
They are there because they have to be. (Just like temperature
and traction rating, which are just as useless since a tire
with a treadwear of 30 has the same 'A' rating as a tire with
a treadwear of 220.)

Wellll, since there's been sone tire-talk (as opposed to tired-talk, 
which there seems to be a great deal of, ie, ted-talk.)...

I haven't done a single thing on my 3 week old 1988 944S, it's feeling 
neglected.  I recently discovered that a friend of mine has some 16x7 
phone dials in his garage, doing nothing.  Why?  Apparently he bought 
them for his 914 at a swap, not realizing they won't fit.

The upshot of this is he will trade me straight over for my 15's.  
Should I do this?  I need new tires pretty soon anyways, so if I see a 
good deal on some tires, it wouldn't be totally impractical.

More importantly, what sort of tires should I put on them?  I've 
talked to several tire folks, and of course the requisite 1 Dozen 
friends, and everyone tells me something different.  This is a street 
car/daily driver, I drive it reasonably hard, but I don't want my car to 
abuse me too much.  Of course, I don't want to screw up the 
speedo or slow down my car by putting too big of wheels/tires on it either.

So fire away, send me e-mail and I will post a summary.  Share your tire

I knew it was bound to happen.  I gave in to temptation and ordered a 993
last night.  For the first time in 25 years of owning many 911's I finally
bought one new and with options I wanted!  Anyway, my wife and I agreed
that three 911's are one or two too many so we'll have to sell some.

Several of you who have seen the two I have at the moment have asked to
be notified if I put them up for sale.  So here it is.  They are being offered
to anyone in porschephiles first.  I will advertise in local papers in a
week or two.

Because 993 delivery is about 3-4 months out I am only interested in
selling one 911 (either) now:

Price for either $29,000.

88 factory turbo look targa.  Sticker shows $63k new (t-look $14k
option).  Rare.  Incredible handling.  Unbelievable brakes.  Sexy body style. 
Diamond blue (silver/lavender metallic).  Nearly perfect condition.  Full
polish Fuchs (7's & 9's), hand painted crests, HRS locks, never damaged in
any way, new top, new silver-grey leather seat inserts. Car phone. 115k
miles.

89 coupe.  Sticker shows $58k new.   Silver anniv special (black metallic,
painted wheels to match, special leather console w/ gauges, piping trim
on seats, matching steering wheel, plush trunk carpet).  Factory short
shifter.  New RE71's on 7's and 8's.  Minor parking lot fender-bender
repaired by Porsche specialist (BodyStyle, 10/93, excellent work!). 30k
miles.

I'm a digest subscriber and slow to read batched mail.  I do get to direct

Ed,
I don't know if you can take the sender apart but I will tell you about what 
happened to my '90 C4 fuel sender.
                                 
In 3/22/91, I got a letter from Porsche about a possible problem "due to a 
faulty fuel gauge sending unit which is located in the fuel tank and produces 
a signal to the fuel gauge designating the proper fuel level."  Porsche goes 
on to say how they apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused and 
ask me to take my car to a Porsche dealer who will inspect and/or replace the 
unit in approximately 30 minutes.

As a gesture for my purchase of a Porsche and for my patience and 
understanding about this technical problem, they will provide me with a new 
book, "Porsche-The Fine Art oof the Sports Car".  If I have any questions, I 
should contact their Owner Relations Department at (800) 545-8039.  Signed by

Hi everyone,

I have been reading about cam tensioners but I have a question in mind.  How do you know
when the cam tensioners need replacemt?  I own an '86 911, so presumably I don't have to worry
about pistons meeting valves if the tensioners just go.  Is there an arbitrary amount of
mileage to go by? I.E. replace every 60K miles or so.

With the yuckky weather coming upon us,  do you have any suggestions on the best way to
store the car for the winter?

Do you know of any insurance companies that would insure the vehicle,for theft and fire only,
without having to pay for liability and all the other mandatory stuff if all you are
going to do is store the car in the garage?

All replies will be greatly appreciated.

I highly recommend the stuff made by Group 6 over the Microdynamics part -
it's vasty superior to the Microdynamics RRFPR of yore.  Group 6 is
basically a Volvo/Saab (turbo) tuning place headed up by a former aerospace
engineer (can't remember his name).  They can take most any Bosch
fixed-fuel-pressure regulator and turn it into a rising-rate fuel pressure
regulator (RRFPR above) in a variety of ratios (I hade one made for a BMW 
application at 1.6:1 - I sent them a new, fixed unit, and got back the
variable, rising-rate one built around it). This is a _superior-quality_
part, beautifully finished, etc. About the only complaint a european-car
owner might have is that the adjusting hardware is SAE. Around $300, if I
remember correctly. They advertise in the back of European Car -

Alan Marr, who took over the Bay Area autocrosser's list from me when I left

of the Bay Area autocrossers list again.

The new address will be ba-autox@avistar.com.  "ba-racers" will continue to
work for a while, but I'll try to remind anyone who uses it to switch
names.  Since the focus is really a lot narrower than "racers", I think the
new name is better (and no longer in conflict with a different list!)

Avistar still only has UUCP access, with connections to uunet every 30
minutes.  So response will have as much as a 60 minute delay (though usually
much less) until our internet connection gets established (which, they say,

I'm the first US owner of a Euro '81 911SC. I had the federalization
done to my spec in Weissbaden, had it imported courtesy of the seller's
connections (The Large Green Movin' Machine...), and then did all the
certification and importing stuff myself stateside. I've also imported
Euro Audis, BMW motorcycles, and split-window Beetles.

In the early 80s, when the dollar was strong against the various
eurocurrancies, people did this  a lot. Because a lot of people did
it, the certification processs started getting looked at.There were
a lot of shops that "certified" cars by waving a majik wand and 
saying "OK, ready to go" because they knew the customer wanted a full
eurospec car.

This is straightforward, and for a bright grad student like you, should
be real simple: there are rules from the DOT and the EPA that govern
this type of activity, and they changed in the late 80s. There are also 
state rules that vary by state which in some cases are more stringent.
I started my process in Nov 89, and completed it in Jan 90. I am told that 
had I started it much later, I would have been given the one-year usage permit
and then have had to crush or re-export the car, or certify and sit for
inspection verifying that the car was for off-road racing use only.

If you don't believe me *FINE*.  Call the EPA yourself. Or ask yourself
why you don't see newer Mercedes G-wagens, or 959s or M5 Tourings
over here if it's so easy.

Subject: Re: welding questions.



Hey Trond, if you're burning MIG tips and mouthpieces then you are'nt
keeping it clean and/or you're sticking your stinger into the work too
far..  -or you're welding a battleship together!  I ruin more nozzles
banging the dangleberries out than I do welding!
  What are you using for nozzle protectant?  Paste nozzle dip sucks.
  The silicone melts like wax and drools on your work -major mess.
Some guys claim PAM works for them, I tried it but it smokes. I now
use a free sample bottle of stuff that mists on and dries hard, it's
name is: York's Spatt-r-pruf.  *Highly recommended*!!

Allen;  For welding sheet metal, a 100 amp max. MIGger will do the 
job just fine.  The heavier creations using I-beam or ?? wont be
that critical for weld finish (as with sheet metal) so a 'buzz box'
ARC welder would do.  But it's another tool to have and not that
useful in comparison to a wire-feed 110v MIG.  These can be run from
a heavy extension cord!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but were'nt 356's built using gas and 
electric spot welding?

  A couple years back i was at a 'war bonnet' session, and spoke with
a german dude who restores 356's for a living.  Bernard Von Nolting
  He uses both MIG and GAS on these cars, when asked which is better
he said both.  It depends on the site you are welding.
  He went on to explain that gas welding minimally alters the
metallurgy in the panel prior to welding, but
has the disadvantage of enormous heat affecting a large zone.  The
MIG welder has the advantage of only enough heat to do the fusion in
the area being concentrated on, in fact the MIG may not have enough
heating to attain full penetration of the weld IF the material is 
too thick or the amperage is too low.  'The small MIG limitation.'

  Putting the least amount of heat into the workpiece is the best 
thing for sheet metal cars because the metallurgy is affected the 
least and warpage is then held to a minimum.  It requires skill and
judgment to attain proper penetration with a minimal setting.  MIG is
rather quick in process as opposed to Gas, and I would think the
Germans switched to MIG to speed up the fabrication process.

  Multiple passes with a small MIG are OK *IF* you ensure penetration
of each run..if you cant get full penetration it may be possible to
force penetration by making a final pass with a torch, but then you
must take care to avoid overheating the work, once again requiring
skill and judgment. (practice)
  I use the MIG to do everything.  For heavy steel (1/4" and over)
i used the MIG to 'tack' weld, then followup with the torch to attain
penetration.  There were a couple occasions where the torch was used
in sites the MIG could not access or I just could not see well enough
to zap.  A 110vac 100 amp mig will work fine welding up to 1/4"
plate, but you will want to second pass the flip side.  If you cant
flip, use the torch...you do have a torch -dont you?  I mean, if
you are welding 1/4" or more plate, what are you cutting it with?
 -a SAW! haw haw! glutton for punishment, unless you got a portable
band saw or you like pumping iron. =8-)

  Granted, a little mig of single polarity has limitations, but for
us motorheads a 100amp mig will do %90+ of all welding on mild steel.

  Welding stainless steel requires changing polarity and feeder wire,
something the cheep migs wont do easily.  You get what you pay for.
  Even then, if you're into electricals like i am, reversing polarity
is just a matter of opening up the box and changing connections.

  For you wannabe weldors, please check out this small but good and
cheap book;  Welder's Handbook by Monroe and Finch.  Bookstar has it.

Subject: Re; front spoiler on a older 911T

Conventional wisdom has it that you should not add a front spoiler 
without a corresponding rear spoiler, or you may end up with the rear 
getting light at speed, which is even more unnerving than the front! 
But at 80 mph, I don't think anything terrible will happen. And given 
that the stock S spoiler did not require a rear spoiler, at least as 
far as the factory was concerned, that seems like a good bet.

Here are some lift numbers at higher speeds. Note that the lift 
increases with the square of speed, so the lift at 80 mph is much less 
than half the lift at 160 mph.

aero mod      none        air dam alone      duck tail       whale tail

speed         140 mph     140 mph            150 mph         160 mph

front end     183 lbs     102 lbs            117 lbs         133 lbs

rear end      279 lbs     279 lbs             92 lbs          38 lbs

I'd actually recommend you do something about your tires and possibly 
alignment. Wider tires should helpm lower air pressure might (but not 
too low!), lower right height would help, and more caster would also 
help. You can also change the toe to provide more stability.

He's willing to send you pictures of the car in action (possibly

For tires, go with Yokohama AVS or Intermediates for street use. 205

I had trouble passing smog in my RX-7, and my friendly local smog

I motored up and down the street at 7000 rpm in first gear for a couple

First thing, check the offset of the desired wheels to make sure that they
are phone dials from a 1987 or later 944.  There are two ways to do this:
1) straightedge across the inner lip and measure to the hub of the wheel.
Your current wheels should measure 52.3 mm (about 2.2 inches) and the 16s
should measure the same. 2) Find the measurement of 52.3 stamped on the
inside of one of the spokes of the desired wheels.

If this measurement is not correct (most likely would be 23.3 mm vice 52.3
mm), do not proceed further.

> More importantly, what sort of tires should I put on them?

Put the best tires for whatever kind of driving you are going to do.  For
street only, Dunlop D40-M2s or Bridgestone RE71 or Michelin XGTVs or
BFGoodrich CompTAs. For track only, Yoko A008s or BFG Comp TA R1s or
whatever.  For both, pick one of the above, considering that in one
situation you will be giving up some level of performance for some other
factor, e.g. economy.

Didja notice the caption for the engine compartment shot (p.17)?

	"911's V6 boxer engine is bigger and stronger,

Sounds like some achievement!

And did any other subscribers get two copies of the same issue?

Subject: Tire/Wheel musings


In anticipation of resurgence of my apparent obsession with autocross and 
track events, I was wondering if I could put 7x16 and 8x16 fuchs on the 
front and back respectively of my 84 911.  The set up is currently 6's 
and 7's.  I'm not into "rolling" any lips to do this.  Will I need 
spacers or any other adjustments to do this?  The idea is to get a less 
than pristine set of these wider fuchs (sorry Ted) and put some A008RS's 
on them.  Then I can use my Dunlops for daily driving and slip on the 
wider, stickier shoes for "the dance."

Any suggestions/comments?  Should I be getting the A008's or the T/A's or 
these RE 71's (what are they) I've seen messages about?

Subject: RE: Club race at Parade?

Driver training at P.I.R. is presently planned (and approved by National)
for the 1995 Parade in Portland, Oregon.  The parking area where we
normally pit for driver training events at P.I.R. is the site for the
autocross which runs for three days.  The whole site is rented, so it was
decided to hold driver training while the autocross was going on. 
Presently the plan is to have 5 half-day sessions of 40 drivers each with
the 6th half-day session for the race cars at the Parade.  Each half day
session will be broken into two run groups of 20 drivers each.  Each driver
will receive three sessions on the track of about 30 minutes in duration. 
The cost is expected to be $40 per driver which will go to charity after
expenses are paid.

As for a club race at P.I.R. in conjunction with the Parade, the local
Parade staff feels that they and their region members have enough to do
already without a Club Race, but that they would support the event if it
were to be organized by National.  Most likely the event would be on Monday
and Tuesday after the Parade so as not to interfere with the Parade itself.

Thomas,
  The 205/60's would be a big improvement over your 195/65 tires, and 
will fit the wheel with no problem.  I don't know if they will fit 
because I don't know anything aobut the 924S body.

Make sure your RE-71's are the regular ones, not the "R" compound which 
are for autocross use and will wear much faster.

Tire Rack was having a sale on that size of RE71 regular for $78 or so 
last week.

Subject: Import regulations....

Hi,

I've seen the discussion about importing European cars to the US from the 
sideline. I'm not well into what's needed to import cars to the US, but my 
experience is that our European Cars have as good (if not better) emmission 
rates than what is required in the US!? Of course there could be other 
regulations too, like 'Ugly Bumpers' required. (READ: How to spoil an E-type 
Jag.) 

On the other side I don't think there are many cars that will be able to 
sell for more in the US than Europe. Collector cars, like the Ferrari that 
was mentioned is another issue, but that is just as with other investments, 
sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down. In 1987 to 1990-91 every 
damned car that was either a 'Thoroughbred' or veteran multiplied their 
values with factors from 2 to 5. Ferrari 308's was up from about $25000 in 
'85 to +$50000 in 1989-90. 

As an example I'll mention what happened to me the summer of '87. Just 
finished from school looking for a job, looking for a sportscar. In 
Juli-August '87 I got in contact with the seller of a 'basket-case' 
Lamborghini Miura. The seller wanted $10k for it. I hadn't received any 
positive answers from companies, and wouldn't decide on a loan. October'87 I 
got a job, went straight to the bank and got a promise that I could borrow 
for the car. Called the seller, but the price was doubled. No Miura for me, 
so i went buying half a Miura instead.(Alfa GTV6).

What *is* required to import cars to the US?

Trond.

All interested porschphiles,

	With much knashing of teeth and renting of garments, I have decided 
to put my 911T up for sale.  I can't bear to see it sit another winter in 
the garage behind a 4 foot snow bank!  I bought the car in 1985 in Italy 
when I was there doing graduate work.  Bought it from an exccentric but 
knowledeable ex-patriat Anerican who had a first class garage in Milan.  He 
specialized in Porsches and vintage BMW's.  He resprayed if for me from a 
bilious green to flashy red, quite beautifully, no-one can tell what the 
original color was.  He also did all the necessary modifications to pass 
DOT inspection and import requirements into US.  It has 99,500 kms (about 
52/53,000 miles) and is in good running condition.  It has a small dent in 
the rear when it rolled down the driveway and was stopped by a wooden post, 
some rust also starting to show on right fender.  For further information 
please contact at eisingmm@splava.cc.plattsburgh.edu  or phone (518) 561-

Those limericks are great, guys!  Here's mine! (FOUR of 'em!)
AAANDDDD,  "The Ted Commandments"

	    "993"
Cast wheels never crack, only bend.
and 185/60s are your friends
and we all know that Ted,
in his late 70's sled,
can whip a 993 in the bends.

  	 "Narrower!"
There once was a surfer named Ted
on the curbs he really could shred
but when it came time to race,
he really lost face,
"It's my tires, they're too wide!" he said!

	 "Physics"
We have here the Porschephiles ding-dong
he swears the laws of physics are wrong
and the Porsche Engineers
drank too many beers,
but Ted has known better all along!

	 "HEIL!"
Ich bin ein gut Nazi Sheep!
I wear my eye patch even to sleep!
My idea of heaven

	"The Ted Commandments" (In no particular order)

1.) Cast wheels bend, forged ones crack.
2.) Steel wheels do not bend, they break.
3.) Skinnier tires make cars perform better.
4.) Aluminum is just plain superior to steel.
5.) KYB schlocks are superior to Konis, and a better deal.
6.) People who know what they are talking about are always wrong.
7.) Best road adhesion can be achieved with mixtures of several tire brands.
8.) A cheap motorcycle helmet is as good as a SA90 Auto racing helmet.
9.) Wider tires in front will help correct oversteer.
10.) The average layman can design cars better than German engineers.

Hello everyone!

Since the members of this list have been so helpful in the past,
you've won the honor of helping me again ;-). I'm in the process 
of performing a fairly comprehensive tune-up of my 1980 911sc
and wanted to gather some information on setting the timing.
My fiche (and reader) are on order, so right now I'm relying on
my trusty haynes manual and you folks. Does anyone know the
calibration of the markings on the crank pulley? The haynes manual
states to set the timing to 15 to 20 degrees BTDC at 3000 RPM with both the
vacuum advance and retard disconnected then check at idle for 3 to 7 
degrees ATDC with retard connected and 8 t 12 degrees BTDC with advance
connected. Obviously I need to know the 20 BTDC, 5 ATDC and 10 BTDC positions
on the ole crank pulley, are they marked? 

Any advice appreciated!

Andre,

  When my '87 951 was new, the stereo installer removed the rear speakers
which we then mounted in the front doors (they were Blaupunkt coaxials).
Although I wasn't there to witness it (probably a good thing) they told me
that it is basically necessary to remove the whole plastic "sideliner" which
is one big piece and gets taken out through the rear hatch. Nothing was said
about window glass, and I saw no evidence of any tampering with it. Clearly
the factory does this with the seats out. The installer also removed them
before starting the installation.
  They also commented that when the job was done, it would have been about
the same cost to just buy a new set of Blaupunkts and save the labor (several
hours).
  I ended up with "box" type speakers mounted at the rear of the hatchback
area for better low end response.
  IMHO, since there isn't enough room in the back speaker locations for much
of a woofer, I wouldn't bother with the pain of access to that location. If
you want real bass in the rear, put a subwoofer somewhere in back.

Go back to your desk....you didn't do anything wrong!!!

If anything, you did something right.  You made me question what I was 
planning on doing.  This *HELPED* me!  Thanks.

At least your e-mail *MAY HAVE* erred on the side of caution - a much better 
place to be than saying "Don't worry, Al...go ahead and braze those 
structural parts...I heard brazing is all you need!"

My friend at work has an uncle whose job is welding....he is an expert.  He 
will be asking him about my specific application: welding 1/4" stainless 
steel.  This is the thickest stuff I'd probably ever use in a structural 
manner and plan on using for my motor and transmission mounts.  After 
thinking about your warning (re: injury or death) it got me thinking about 
it.  Probably I'll just tack weld the parts and have him do the welding.  I 
don't want it to break!!!

So, thanks for your e-mail.  It helped.

Not a Porsche thread, but I enjoyed the description of the video depicting a
whale being blown up.  Recalls two high school friends of mine who casually
acquired a box of dynamite (in those days, you just walked into the hardware
store, told 'em you were dynamiting tree stumps, and walked out with a box of
TNT).  They blew up a few sticks here and there, but it wasn't very
spectacular.  Then they came across a discarded refrigerator, and decided to
put a few sticks inside, lay it down on its door, and see what would happen.
Fortunately, they got a good distance away, but had no idea how high the
thing would fly nor how far away the pieces would be distributed.  No one
seriously hurt, but they were very subdued for a few days, and dumped the
dynamite in Buffalo Lake.  They then went back to safer pursuits, playing
with their .45 and .357 magnum pistols....  That was Texas in the early '60s.

Subject: Re:  Tire/Wheel musings

Jerry,

7x16 and 8x16 Fuchs fit just fine on your car. However, you will
still be using 205/55R16 tires on the front and 225/50R16 tires
on the rear. I do not believe running this wheel/tire combination
will cause you any problems as far as class is concerned.

8x16 (951 offset) and 9x16 Fuchs fit fine as well with no fender
lip rolling if you use 225/45R16 tires on the front and 245/45R16
tires on the rear. Not every tire comes in the 225/45R16 size so
keep this in mind. This wheel/tire combination is absolutely the
best looking (tires fill up fender wells nicely) and best perform-
ing (more rubber on the road than a stock turbo). You will need to
find out what class this tire/wheel combination will put you in.
If you don't care, all the better.

If you want to run "R" compound tires, things get a little more
complicated for the 8x16/9x16 combo. I do not know of an "R"
compound tire in the 225/45R16 size. 225/50R16 is available but
may not fit well under the front fenders. I have not tried so
I cannot say how it would work. "R" compound 245/45R16 tires are
common.

On the street, I run 8x16 (951 offset) and 9x16 Fuchs with 225/45R16
and 245/45R16 tires respectively. I use Dunlop SP8000 tires.

For autox, I run 8x15 and 9x16 Fuchs with 225/50R15 and 245/45R16
tires respectively. Because of the 8x15 offset, I had to roll my
fender lips in the front. I currently use Yokohama A008RS II tire.
However, I would recommend BFG T/A R1 Road Racing compound for 
autocrossing instead of the Yokos.

Pardon my admitted ignorance.  What is meant by the parenthetical "951 
offset"?  Are these a different kind of wheel or just a different set up 
(spacers etc.)?  This point may be moot given your discussion below as 
the goal here is to put the stickier "R" or "RS" boots on my baby.

On the BFG T/A's - do you know anything about this ad I saw for the "T/A 
Team" in Pano?  Do they give you a discount?  Do you have to prove so 
many "wins" to qualify?  Or is this (as I suspect it is) a clever

I've not heard of any replacement interval.  If you have the "Carrera"
tensioners, you would only replace them if they got noisy, that is,
they no longer held tension adequately allowing the chains to make
noise.  If you don't have the Carrera tensioners, you replace them
immediately!

You can certainly retrofit the system from, for example, a 911S of
that same model year.  You will likely find it cheaper and easier to
install a non-original system.

There are a lot of good oil coolers out there.  Bruce Anderson was
asked for a recommendation at Tech Tactics last year or the year before
and dropped the name Mocal.  The shop has used all sorts, including
B&B and Ruf.  We use a B&B on the race car, and it is a nice piece
of equipment.

I have also seen Mercedes oil coolers used on a number of Porsches.
One went on a 924GTS about a year ago.  A lot of time, the choice is
really driven by available parts' dimensions more than anything else.

Dash 12 Aeroquip-style hose is a fine size for your application.  You
will have to install a thermostat, and you will have to use metric-to-
AN adaptors with a non-German cooler, in addition to other fittings.

No. You can't. Let's go on to that as the last item...

>Most Euro cars meet DOT requirements.(!?)

No. Most Euro car makers make versions that meet US specs. Ditto for
most Japanese makers. But as you can tell if you survey the market,
there are GOBS of otherwise fun cars available in the Rest Of World
market that are NOT available in the US. There are also lots of US
only models (from both domestic US manufacturers and importers)
that are not available outside the US.

>What *is* required to import cars to the US?

There are a pile of rules and regs. But there are some basics:

* you gotta meet NTHSA (Nationsl Traffic and Highway Safety Administration)
  rules for crashworthiness and safety

* you gotta meet DOT rules for safety and required equipment

* you gotta meet EPA rules for emissions and manufacturers support of
  the emssions systems. 

* you gotta meet state DOT and EPA regs if applicable (and it is in CA,
  TX, NJ, etc -- all the places under EPA interdiction)

And here's the kicker: the car *MUST* be identically equipped to the US
model it corresponds with --- same doors, same glass, same electricals
and emissions. The "must be able to pass the same test" thing that used
to apply is *GONE*. It's gotta be an exact match. Thus, if there is *NO*
US spec version, you can't bring it in.

There is one exception: you can become a "manufacturer". If you do this, you
must convert the cars to a uniform specification that meets all relevant
requirments, you must supply two samples of each model imported for crash
testing. 

And that's the story as I know it.

Subject: 944 rear speakers



Despite what was said by auto stereo dealers etc you don't need to remove the 
rear windows to access the speaker. You should remove all the screws from the 
interior side panel and then carefully ease the thin edge of the panel from 
under the rubber seal of the window. The panel is quite fragile so care is 
the name of the game here. The speakers are then fully accessable. 
In my '87 there were two different sets of mounting holes for 4x6 or a 
round speaker, but since I already had 4x6 pioneer plates to install I didn't 
check out the size of the other holes. With hindsight it would have been wise 
to go for the other speaker for better bass. 

Replace the panel and all the fastening screws. Then the trickiest 
part is getting the edge of the panel back under the rubber seal. I used the 
end of a nicely rounded teaspoon, bent appropriately, and then push the panel 
edge back. 

The job turned out ok but is easy to tear the cover material of the panel. 
The rear seats may need to be up or down to access all the screws.

Dear Larry:

     Ironic you should request up-to-date info on the number of 356's
surviving. I recently requested a "count"  from a major Data Provider of
Registered 356/912's in some 29 states where one can get a  "count". The
Numbers are quite interesting- especially when played with a bit on  a
spreadsheet.  They had a little over 5,000 Registered 356/912   out of either
69 MILLION or 93 Million (depending on how you intrepreted their "Verified"
versus "Total" records.) Extrapolating this to the entire US auto population
gave a range of 7500 to 10,000 356/912's still running On The Road, across
the U S of A.
     Now, remember, these are REGISTERED 356/912's- there are of course many
other un-registered 356/912 in garages, back yards, barns,  in fields with
trees growing through them, etc. The calculation of how many of those exist
is left to the Student.
    I'll try to get a breakdown (no pun intended) of the 356's vs the 912's.
from the Data Supplier if their mainframe doesn't choke on the request.
    Meanwhile, if you'd like the spreadsheet data and % of registered
vehicles that are 356/912's let me know and I'll E-mail it (or post it should
the List desire it.) The overall number is on the order of one  356/912 in
10,000 cars. What a unique group. And I'm proud to be a member!

   KEEP THE 356/912 Faith!
   The Maestro
P.S. the .94 factor (6% junk/total rate per year), was based on overall
vehicle junk rate in the '80's. Nowadays, I'd say the junk/total rate for
356/912's is around 2%/year. 'Course you gotta add the desertion rate to
foreign lands which has slowed down considerably recently, thankfully.

Both contact cement (bad idea) and epoxy failed the test once I tried

Subject: Re: Hard to find 914 part

Thanks yet again for all the advice! Very helpful.

Here's the scoop: Since this 022906045 Air Regulator is no longer
available *anywhere*, Fred and I will buy the 022906045a, the one
for the 1.8L engine. (Also was used on lots of other cars, that's
why it is still around; my beloved 1984 Rabbit GTI even had one!)

This part does not fit quite right; it will also likely not bolt
anywhere -- the hoses will hold it in place I think; and it will need
some  minor (i hope) electrical [it needs a ground wire, the orig
was 'self-grounding'...and it will need a new red lead fitting to
be made]

But it is available, it costs only $50 or so new, and looks a lot better
designed and made than the original part. I will let all know the result
in a few weeks.

Subject: auto-x sunday

At GGR autox today, I ended up getting a 120 second, then a 58 second 
clean run.  

In the interim were some interesting 360s.  Apparently in my efforts to 
convert the car from understeering to oversteering, the back end seemed 
to have a mind of it's own.

Today, I ran 16x6"wheels with 205/55 Dunlop M40 D2 Z tires on front at 40 
lbs. medium cold (1 hr. of freeway driving, rest 1 hr. then measure), and 
rears were 1 Nitto 195/50x15 on 7"x15 BBS, on L, and R was 1 Bridgestone 
Turanza or some such 195/50x15, both of these were at 38lbs.

Although my times were not good, and I spun out maybe 3 of the 4 runs I 
ran, I feel I'm getting the hang of the car.  It was much more reassuring 
than the last event where the front was just plowing, and I felt 
helpless.  Today, it was just a few "whoops" and recover.  I think it's 
better to practice with street tires, though maybe next month I'll move 
to autox tires and cut down on the spin outs...

I only know about their fuel pressure regulators. 

As I stated in my post, they're set up to modify existing fixed-pressure
regulators and turn them into rising-rate ones. This way they can keep all
the fittings, etc. I presume that they usually make adjustable ones. How
many they've done and for what applications, I don't know.  

As a Porsche owner, when dealing with Group 6, I'd say that you're pretty
much on your own - if you _know_ what you need, they can build it, but they
can't tell you what you need or what effect it will have.  

Finally, if you're convinced that a RRFPR is the solution, and if you do
choose to have them make you one, make sure it won't be too big
(physically) for your application. The "diaphragm" that makes for the
ratiometric increase in fuel pressure as a function of manifold vacuum is
(necessarily)  considerably larger in diameter and height than the typical
(my experience: BMW, Jaguar & 914) Bosch fuel pressure regulator. The size
difference is akin to the difference between a baseball and a softball.

Subject: 911 shift problem solution

I want to thank everyone who responded to my shift problem. Here is what I did
and what I found. As recomended i checked for broken or loose eng/trans
mounts,clutch adj,shift bushing wear and shift adj. After checking every think
but before adj the shift linkage I still had the problem of the trans getting
stuck when shifting from 4th to 5th (while sitting in garage with car off) and
had to shart the car and let out on the clutch to get it free. After i adjusted
the shift linkage(at clamp under trans cover) i no longer had the sticking
problem. I took a road test and had more problems. When i tried to shift from
1st to 2nd all i got was a grinding, i could not go into any gear while moving
although i could go into all easily while stopped. The next day i put the car
on stands so i could run the car in gear and check the adj of the shifter. I
tried differnt adj for 3hours and always  got a grinding(sounded like a high
speed cutter) i even got the grinding when pulling out of a gear. The next day
i decided to road test (i need gas) i find i can shift into 1st,3rd and 5th.
Shifting out of 3rd grinds. If i take off in 2nd i can shift out of 2nd with no
grinding but not in. I drive around a little at low speeds to see exactly when
grinding in each gear happens. I shift out of 3rd and there is no grinding. I
try other gears and everything works fine. I drive a little while no
problems.Solution: I think i must have chipped a gear or syncro at the auto-x
and this chip got stuck in the trans . Eventualy it was ground away and the
trans works fine again. I am going to change the trans. fluid tomorrow to
remove the fillings i could hear being made. I hope this doesnt cause problems
down the road.

Not at all, Bruce. I'm simply pointing out that if you need a RRFPR, they
can make you a very nice one.  I would expect that most people needing one
would have highly modified engines where the stock FI couldn't keep up.

Well, at least partially.

I FINALLY checked the fuel pump today, and it is delivering MUCH
less fuel than it is supposed to.  The specified output of the pump
is 1.5 quarts (or greater) per 30 second interval when the [ump
is running full on (I ran a line from the battery directly to
accomplish this).  IT was pumping about 1/3 of that.  MAYBE
a pint in the thirty seconds.

Needless to say, I'm getting another pump.  Should be here soon!

Some of these "professional" systems aren't too sophisticated, a home
made one could be just as effective.

My dad bought a new Ford Taurus from a Los Angeles dealer, with a "Brand X" 
anti-theft system installed.

I can't remember the exact name.

The dealer has them installed on all cars, and if you elect not to
buy the $150.00 anti-theft option, a magic "key" is installed to avoid 
removing the "Brand X" system.

He didn't pay for the "Brand X" and when he brought the car by I looked at
the "Brand X" connector to see a chopped off printed circuit board
in an edge card connector.

I pulled out the shortened PCB with a needle nose and saw the circuit 
simply connected two pairs of wires together.  No ohmmeter required, 
the traces were easy to see.

No active components at all, just an edge card connector and a
board with some traces.   Pretty basic circuit interrupter it appears.

If the PCB was removed, the car wouldn't start.

I took a scrap PCB and made a longer board, jumpered the proper pins together,
even put a piece of scrap leather on it.   

My dad was a happy camper with his "free" anti-theft system.

One thing that irritated me was that all customers received the
reliability of the security system whether they paid for it not.  

If the installer compromised the factory wiring during installation, or the 
security system connector was not adequate for the job, a customer that
didn't want the system could still have a dead car caused by the installed
system.

They also do not supply a schematic of what wires they cut into.  Could
make troubleshooting difficult on a otherwise factory stock car.

| The esteemed Dr. Ted "I'm a Dick" Matsumura has left the building.

Guys, can I propose a Special Edition Porsche 911 so that we can
remember Ted and have something to show the newbies the danger
of curb surfing without a license.

The 1994 Tedster 911: People will really check you in the street,
as you out surf F40s, 993, and every other rolling object. Sheesh,
this 911 is going to be remembered in years to come, as the Tedster
blats around Southern California, people as far away as Norway and
Great Britain will be able to hear the exhaust and wish that they
had bought in while they had the chance. James Dean would have died
for one of these, let alone in it. This is the 911 that makes the
Dauer 962 look like an Austin Allegro.

This is the official Weissach specified Tedster 1994 Special Edition:
77 body with an V six boxer engine, cast 9x16 at the front, with 
skinny steel 15x5.5 at the rear. Snow tires on the back and slicks on
the front to correct oversteer. Rear turbo wheel arches on the front,
glued on with Loctite. KYR shocks all round, external rack mount 
for official Porsche, rim rolling baseball bat - also useful
for getting in when keys locked in car. Collapsible, curb surfing side 
fenders, plus a gas heater that heats the gas, driven by hot air.
Internal rack mount bicycle helmet, with integral rear-view mirror.
Power to weight calibration control, optimises hot air load
for maximum upforce, and therefore increases power to weight ratio
to a higher level that any other Porsche with skinny wheels.
Also, a device that points the direction the track is after a spin out,
and also removes one's head from one's butt would be useful.

As I understand it, foreign nationals who emmigrate to the USA (not sure
whether you have to be issued a permenant visa/green card to qualify) have
a "one time exemption" to the rules.  That is, you get to bring one
car, one time, and simply put plates on it and drive away.  Now understand-

No-one I know has done this, think my old man may know someone.  Anyway,
when we came over in '80 the car didn't have to come with you right away,
in fact I don't think there was any time limit.  I hope this hasn't

Is there a publication, Porsche or otherwise, that lists all specs,

for all 911's, first to present. If not, is this info available from the

PCA Golden Gate Region (GGR) Autocross Update

Okay, I lied.  This really is a TED update regarding his experiences
at the GGR Autox on Sunday, September 18th.

Ted received a new nickname from a British announcer that had no idea
who Ted was nor his reputation within Porschephiles or Porschedom in
general.  This nickname was given as Ted was spinning on the course
and sending multiple cones flying through the air to their death.
As Ted recovered from his first spin, the announcer said:

  "Wing Commander Ted Matsumara....."

And the nickname stuck!!

On his first practice lap he spun out twice.  On his timed run he spun
out twice more!!  I realize this is bad sportsmanship, but everyone on
the side lines was laughing like crazy.  And all during this run, the
announcer was commenting about "Wing Commander Ted Matsumara".  Latter
in the day, the nick was shortened to "The Wing Commander".

The Wing Commander's next, and last, run was less eventfull.  He finished
the run without hitting a cone. Here are some of the times that may be
of interest:

The Wing Commander       58.436
Hank Watts               48.153
Dave Darling             53.745
Ken Shahoain             49.292
Scott Winders            48.624

Top time of day went to a 914/6 race.  This is the car that almost always
goes top time of day when it is present.  I finished second in my class
(by 1.5 seconds) to some guy with a 300HP Carrera with more rubber than my
car.  He is a better driver as well.

Anyway, I beat Ted by 9.812 seconds. Better yet, Dave Darling (a rapidly
improving Dave Darling by the way) beat Ted by 4.691 seconds.  Dave did
this in his 2.0 liter 914 on street tires.

Bill,

I used the Evolution 3 until I got my 944 in a garage.  I still use it
when it's parked outside at work or any other place.  I was very happy
with the cover except for one thing: the material broke down and leaves
a nasty dust on the car now (speculation is that the sun causes this).
Still, I liked the protection and that I can store it wet and not worry.
The price sounds about right for a cover that is made to fit the car.

Subject: Report on Visit to Porsche Engineering Services in Troy, MI

Yesterday, I visited Porsche Engineering Services in Troy, MI (the US
office of Weissach) as part of a SMR (Southeastern Michigan Region) of
PCA event.  There was some interest about the event so here is a
report: 

The meeting got off to a great start when they rolled out the Boxter
prototype and let everyone have a test drive.  Just kidding.  

Porsche Engineering set up this group in 1991 near Detroit so that it
would be convenient for its customers.  Currently they work mostly for
the big three and some suppliers.  They plan to start doing more work
for US suppliers and for Japanese and Korean transplants.  Most of
their work has been body work, but they have also done some engine,
transmission, and NVH work.  They also do some work on Porsches,
notably the 993 and unnamed future Porsches.  The offices and work
areas were very nice and were set up just like at Weissach.  Some
areas were off limits and there were only a few drawings lying around
that we could see.  They use CATIA for their CAD work.  They have
about 40 employees and are growing. They mentioned that they are
having a hard time finding qualified people.

Some tidbits from the question-answer session:
The Boxter will be available in mid 1996 in Germany and in the US by
the end of 1996.  It will have a 6 cylinder engine (no 4).  They
refused to say if it would be air or water cooled.  

Everyone received a Porsche Engineering pen and a mug.  Several lucky
people received baseball hats by random drawing.  And one extremely
lucky person won a genuine Weissach lab coat.  Guaranteed to be the
only one in the world outside of the Weissach gates.  Apparently, they
are very serious about limiting the distribution of their lab coats.
About 60 people attended this event. They want to have an ongoing
relationship with PCA members so there will probably be more
activities in the future.

Subject: Leather coloring

Hi, Steve.
 
You might be able to find a product by SEM to recolor your leather. Better
automotive paint stores should be able to help.
 
It might be advisable to let a pro do it. Not all blacks are the same;
you'll probably have to tone the black as it comes to match what you have.
 
I've seen a pro do this, and the results are well worth the nominal fee. I
recently restored the original headliner of a 356. The repro headliner
currently available has the wrong hole pattern, and the original was still
solid but stained by rubber stuff leaching out around the weatherstrip and
such. The guy called in by the upholstery shop mixed up various SEM dyes and
applied it with a small airbrush to the entire headliner. He says the
procedure for leather and vinyl seats is exactly the same. The total cost
for the whole headliner came to about $100. You can find these guys (they
usually work out of their pickup trucks) in the phone book or by going to a
nearby used car dealer and asking who does their used car prep for such
things.
 
Did somebody in response to this thread say that there was something
negative about Connolly leather? I had the seats of my daily driver
recovered in Connolly, and knowing what I know now, I would not do Connolly
again. I would make the effort to get the original German Roser leather and
provide it to the upholster. What was the negative about Connolly?

 > BTDT.

    This was such a good deal in the mid-80's but things have changed.
  Its not Tariffs you have to worry about (those are probably only 5%)
  its the EPA and DOT conversion costs.

  1. Any car made before 1968 walks thru with no EPA or DOT certification
     needed. Yea, you don't have to put big bumpers and cats on your Ferrari
     250 GTO.                                              
  2. There used to be a one-time exemption from EPA reqts for any car older
     than 5 years, i.e. you could have imported a '78 Ferrari 512 and not
     turned a single screw on a single carb. The scam was that (during the
     mid-80s import shuffle) people abused the hell out of that freedom by
     importing a car for every family member, niece nephew and cousin they
     could get a social security number for (then selling the cars). So the
     exemption is gone.
      In the mid-80s, certification shops popped up everywhere, and would take
     about $5k to EPA-convert and certify a Euro model of a US spec car. 
     Only a few of those places still exist, AMERISPEC (in Connecticut, I
     think) was one of the first and still does business. If the car had been
     certified in the US, all they had to do was put on the equipment the US
     car had; cats, induction, tank filters, etc.  If you had a real Exotic 
     (like a Countach) they had to engineer from the ground up. Probably a lot
     of cars were buggered this way. And there was a lot of cheating. 
  3.  Forget importing any car made after 1968 that wasn't DOT certified by
     the manufacturer, eg a Citroen or a Talbot-Matra. Basically you'd have
     to go thru whatever the manufacturer had to do to prove to the DOT is  
     was safe, i.e. crash test a couple, spend a billion dollars to certify, 
     etc. 
      If the car was imported to the US by the manufacturer, again its a
     matter of reworking to meet spec; correct bumpers, lights in the right
     places (there were some -awful- conversions done), reinforcement in the
     doors, and in some places the correct glass. This was the cheaper part of
     the conversion, costing about $1k.   
  4. The big thing that made it all work; a strong dollar. I don't even know
     what the exhange rate is now, but then the pound was $1.05, there were
     10 Franc and 3.6 DM to the dollar. Prices were a lot cheaper too; as
     Trond's recent memory of a Lamborghini Miura for $10k in pieces, the same
     car in pieces cost $100k 3 years later.  
  5. Your friend who made a killing selling their Ferrari for $70k was on the
     lucky upspring of price inflation in the late 80's. What happened to 
     the guy who bought that car ? I think of the Ferrari 246GTS Spier's
     Imports proudly bought, needing work; that car is worth $70k at most
     now, and Spiers is gone. My own semi-exotic was selling for up to 
     $50k in '90, its value now is $25k. I'm glad I kept it. Cars are terrible
     investments, but great cars are great cars.
   
      I frankly think the import (certification) applied to an Exotic is a
     joke; what was ever the purpose of putting 5mph bumpers on a Countach ? 
     to protect the consumer who gets tapped by a Hyundai when they're
     shopping at Kmart ? Like any fraction of the smog problem is due to
     exotic cars which typically  get driven 1000 miles a year ?  When 
     anybody could put monster tires, $79 headers and a Crane cam on their 
     Chevy Pickup ? My proposal would be that the EPA/DOT sell exemptions,
     say at $15k each, and allow free importing w/o qualification. But not
     likely this will happen.

       The good news is that any street Porsche (other than a 959) is    
    convertible to US spec. But when Used Porsche prices are so cheap, whats
    the point ?--Lee A.

  HELP!

  This is motorhead related, but not Porsche.  Maybe someone here
can illuminate me on my chevy cavalier's melting catalytic converters.
  Or point me to the appropriate newsgroup where i can pose this.

  I've got a '83 chevy cavvy with the 2.0 pushrod motor, throttle
body injected, with 121000 miles, original owner.  uh, wifemobile.
  I have replaced the injector, ignition system, fuel filter, Oxy 
sensor, muffler and cat.  The Idle air control is fairly new, and
the throttle body casting has been cleaned 25000 miles ago.
  The original cat and injector lasted 115000 miles, then
melted down shortly after replacing the injector, but it's possible
the cat had been bad or the lean condition pre-existed the cat before
the injector was replaced. (a rebuilt injector)
  The car just had another cat installed (thanks midas!) after 
melting the 2nd gen. unit.

  The car runs a little low on power, but not bad considering the
miles.  Mileage seems normal, 28mpg, the engine does not use oil.
The check engine light does not come on, and there are no error
codes to report.  The light does work.

  On taking it to precision tune, they say the mixture is lean.
Something about 'integrator'?  So I talk to the dude who did the work
and he says the 'prom' is bad in the F.I. brain.
  Ok, so I work on computers and I know roms dont forget, but
circuitry can go weak, so I'm about to search for another brain.

My question is; Anyone been there and done it?  Please enlighten me.

  Do I swap the brain and keep the prom?  Or swap the prom and keep

  I'm hoping someone out there can say change resistor r23..'cuz it

this granularity..  Any donated words much appreciated.

  Please respond direct because the pins dancing on Ted's head

    Fun, fun, fun!  How else could I possibly describe it?
Lloyd DeMartini once again took TTOD (one would think that
got a bit boring for him, he does it so often!).  Ted did
manage to show--for those of you there, he was flagman for
the second hour (thank god I was working, not driving that
hour!).
    One of the announcers came up with a new nickname for
poor Ted--"Wing Commander Ted Matsumura."  On one spectacular
run, Ted managed to spin out, get moving again, and then spin
again about 100 feet further down-course.  It was truly awe-
inspiring!  "Wing Commander Ted is giving us an aerobatic
demonstration.  We've seen two loop-the-loops, and now he's
going to try wing-walking!"  It was a riot.  Unfortunately, 
he left at about noon, so we only got to see two or three Ted
runs.  But he was averaging about a spin per lap!
    My morning was occupied by trying to find the bloody line.
Couldn't find it with both hands, a hunting dog, and a compass.
The other item of some note was helping Brooks, my main compe-
tition, tighten his front wheel bearings so that he could pass
tech, and then try to beat me.
    Which he did for most of the day.  But then--I got Rob
Neidel to ride with me.  I figured, 1) he's an excellent 914
pilot, and 2) he designed the course.  He helped immensely. 
My last two runs (out of six!  Brooks, you should have stayed!)
were excellent.  Everything "felt" right.  I finally managed
to turn in a 53.745 (I think) which was either 4.5 or 5.5 sec-
onds faster than Ted.

Sonoma County Airport.  Registation opens at 8:30AM.  The next

Subject: 85.5 944 Sunroof Woes

My 85.5 944 has a sunroof with two problems with which I'd appreciate
some help.

For one, it doesn't open.  The roof motor whirs when I press the
button, but the roof itself does not move.  As for manually opening
the roof, I must confess to some ignorance.  I've tried
opening the two latches at the front of the roof and pushing
up, but it appears locked.  I'm assuming that the roof must be
tilted open by the motor mechanism, and _then_ manually removed.
The previous owner was up front about the roof problems as well
as the fact that they didn't have an owner's manual describing
how to open the roof.

For the second, the rear roof seal is leaky.  It creates air
noise at highway speeds and allows a little water in during
a car wash.  No rain leaks in.  It takes some force, such as
that generated by the dryer at my local car wash, to force water
in.

Is information on the roof mechanisms in the 924 or 944 Workshop
manuals?  I know there is some intentional overlap in the
manuals, and I'd like to invest in one set now and one set
after my wallet recovers.

I can hear the motor in the driver side cargo section wall.  Is
it connected via a cable to the roof?  Can I get at the
opening mechanism by removing the ceiling trim panel just
aft of the sunroof itsef?

Any and all help is appreciated.  Thanks!

I've been EXTREMELY pleased with the parts department at Jim Ellis, Atlanta,

or $1500 order, good prices, honest shipping rates. And I don't mind getting

We DO NOT plan on making a pilgrimage to the credit card companies who also

Has anyone been watching Sienfeld?  Last week's episode had a black 911 
Targa sitting on the street; looked to be a '92(?)  The scene was set in 
NYC.  Kramer and Elaine were waiting for Jerry and George to pick them up 
in a Limo.  The 911 figured prominently as a background piece.  Really 
attractive.  

I understand that Jerry Sienfeld is a certified Porschephile.  An article 
in either People, or some other personality rag, indicated that he owned 
FIVE Porsches.  Maybe that was one of his in the episode.  Imagine that!

Well, the only rub that I can see to the episode was the fact the 911 was 
left on the curb.  I've been to NY a few of times and I'll be DAMNED 
before I leave my "baby" on the curb anywhere in the City.  As a matter of 
fact, I leave my 951 in Connecticut and take the train to NYC.

On a different note,  does anyone have a Bee-line on a good new 
(inexpensive) hood crest for a 951?  Mine's fading.

Seeya,
Bert

I believe this is common with just about every car cover.  I had this problem
with every car cover I have used, and everyone I know has this same problem. 
The dust generally blows away or can be wiped off pretty easily.  If the car

Helmets
    I don't know, I'll probably be accused of being Ted-like
on this, but:
    I have a Snell M-90 open-face helmet that I wear when I
autocross.  This is for a number of reasons.  Unfortunately,
cost is a major issue in my life right now, and will probably
remain so for quite a while.  The M-90 helmets are cheaper
than the SA-90s, and open-face helmets are cheaper than the
closed-face.  Open-face helmets generally offer less obstruc-
tion of vision, and are easier to talk in.  I went to a rep-
utable shop (Frey Racing in Mt. View, CA) and tried on about
five different helmets.  All were too small.  The people at
the shop told me that SA helmets basically didn't come any
larger, and recommended a motorcycle helmet to me.  I was
able to find an acceptable motorcycle helmet at the third M/C
supply house I visited.
    Finally, the main reason that I wear a helmet is because
the club rules require a Snell 85+ rated helmet.  Not SA, not
M, just 85+.  Any helmet is going to be of rather limited use
in any accident that I could possibly be involved in out on
the autocross course.  If I go off into terrain and roll the
car, either the Targa bar holds and saves me, or it dosen't
and I'm dead.  If I hit a light pole, the seat belt should lock
and keep me from eating the steering wheel.  The only real use
that I've found for a helmet is when I went out on course in a
well set-up 914/6, and couldn't keep from bumping my head (with
M-90 helmet) on parts of his roll cage.
    Basically, I have an M/C helmet because I can't afford to
have one made for me, and because it was specifically recommen-
ded to me by a racing shop.

    I've been wanting to get that off my chest for a while.
Thanks.

I cleaned the surface carefully, scored it, then used JB Weld epoxy to 
glue two long screws with extra wide heads to the badge. Then I used some 
black GE calking (commonly called silicone) in the middle of the badge. 
It's still there six months later. There's really not much to loose by 
trying the epoxy and calk. Worst comes to worse it just falls off. And 
since my place of employ is a block from one of our high school (and

I have a similar problem but in my case the crest was stolen in the
parking lot of my 85/2 944.  I bought a new emblem from the
dealer for about $25 with the gasket.  The emblem is made of plastic
and has two post that slides into the existing holes ( So easy to steel
it is like leaving a 25 dollar Bills in your car with the windows
wide open).

> The torque from the nut just shears the post right off again.

I have to assume that the emblems are different for these two cars,
because I don't have any threads on the new emblem posts. I was hoping
that the emblem is held more securely than a simple screwdriver pop-up. 

So my question is more of the same nature which is, how can I make
the emblem more secure and theft proof? I don't mind paying for the
parking but $25 a pop could become very expensive considering how 
easy remove the emblem.

I am inclined to guess that the one time exception
is no longer available.  ALTHOUGH

I do believe ANY vehicle of 1967 or before can

Since heat is the enemy of durability, I recently insulated the exhaust

with a 'sandwich' made by enveloping fiberglass insulation within two 
sheets of aluminum foil. This has seemed to reduce the heat considerably 
on the exhaust side of the engine, especially on hot days or driving in 
slow traffic.

Subject: 911 engine disassembly

The 911 motor is on the engine stand and coming apart.

Engine/trans separation (not bad):
- ------------------------
Separating the engine and trans was easier than expected,
the Haynes manual says that you have to manufacture some
bizzare screws to relieve clutch tension in order to extract
the clutch release lever, this was not true. I was able
to get pressure off the lever by gently pushing by hand,
then stuck a long screwdriver in the inspection hole and 
rotated the t/o brg till the flat spots lined up with the
finger of the release lever and disengaged the release lever.

flywheel/clutch (piece of cake)
- ---------------
The flywheel was easy. Wierd tool though. you need a 12mm
fillister head (torx?) wrench. I got a little stubby for
$6 that I drive with a 7/16" socket (1/2" drive breaker bar).
My flywheel lock is a 4' long 2x4 that I lever between 2 of
the clutch bolts that I left sticking out the back of the
flywheel. Can someone please tell me why there are dowel
holes in the crank but none in the flywheel? (no dowel
pins in the crank). Does this mean I have a non-standard
flywheel? 

Engine stand (caused delay).
- ------------
I got an adaptor from Stoddards ($140) that allows me to use my
free-standing 4-arm engine stand with the Porsche engine.  The adaptor
is a curved steel bar, about 1.5 x 1.5" square x-section, with a
machined lip and holes in the right places, and is pretty nice
except the notch for the oil cooler wasn't big enough and i had to
spend an hour with a hacksaw to make it fit.

Finally got the plate bolted to the engine, the yoke centered and bolted
to the plate, and...  umphh!  lifted the engine up and into place on the
stand.  With four guys it was easy (probably around 300 lbs with no
trans?).

Exhaust (arggh!) 
- ---------------- 
This is one of the places where having an engine stand is indispensible.
You can twirl the engine around so it is upside down for access to the
exhaust ....  oops, just drizzled black oil all over my friend's lizard
skin boot.

Even with the greatly improved access, some of the exhaust manifold nuts
are still very tough.  The studs came out with a couple of them.  I
rounded the corners off of the others (I can sympathize now, Cherie!)
using a 12-point socket.  I went out and bought a 6-point socket, and
was able to loosen these two nuts.  There was one remaining nut that was
a real bugger.  It was impossible to access using a 3/8" drive drive
socket even with a u-joint.  The access is terrible (#3 cylinder, front
left-hand corner of the engine).  I was able to reach the nut with 1/4"
drive, but broke my 3/8"-to-1/4" adaptor when I tried to loosen it.  I
went out and bought a higher-quality one, which thankfully withstood the
abuse.  The exhaust system is now off the engine, along with the
induction sytem.

The Vacuum advance mechanism is probably dead.  This is a diaphragm inside 
that metal piece tacked on the outside of the distributor.  You can check 
this by connecting a small hose to the fitting, pulling the dist. cap off 
and suck on the hose and see if the dist. plate (the piece the points are 
on) moves.  (Oh yeah, turn the engine off first :-) The plate should move 
a little.  A sure sign of failure is sucking a bunch of air through the 
hose, this means the diaphragm is definitely toast.

>

The performance will be diminished without the correct timing.  
You will probably notice it most accelerating from a stop.  You can cheat 
for a while by plugging the vacuum line and advancing the timing to about 
2 - 4 BTDC, but it may be too much advance for steady state driving.  
(listen for pinging).  

I don't know about your distributor, but most 
advance units can be replace reasonably simply by removing the 
distributor and removing a screw or two and a few spring clips.  The 
downside is they can be expensive for what they are.

There was an article on the 968's in Christophorus a while back.  I
don't remember anything appearing anywhere else, but it would not
surprise me to hear that Pano carried something.

Regarding use of a two-valve head, they do indeed use on of the
RS Turbo.  Turbocharging and multi-valving achieve much the same end.
The two-valve head is simpler and more reliable, which is fairly
important when you are otherwise stressing the engine heavily.

There have been four-valve, turbocharged water pumpers.  The factory
did a turbocharged 944S2.  Unfortunately, it sucked the doors off
their flagship C2 Turbo and was therefore killed.  Something about
protecting your product space.

A company up in Mississauga, Ont. turbocharged a sixteen valve
car, Canadian Pragmatics.  There was an article on it in
Excellence a few years ago.  They apparently have a really good
rep. with the local PCA folks.  I think they may have been involved
in preparing cars for Canada's Rothman's Cup series, but am not
sure.

Subject: Re: Hood Crest attachment...

On older 911s the hood crest attaches with two posts as well. However
there are no nuts to hold the crest. Instead there are two metal
clips.  These are very thin, small rectangular devices which are mildly
spring loaded. The clips on my car were rusted and I was able to find
suitable replacememnts at a hardware store. At $0.03 each they were the
cheapest restoration cost so far - but not original so I guess I'll have
to sell my trailer and actually drive the car!!!!!!!!!!! :>).

This type of fastener uses no torque and it may not shear the post. I
suspect you could have the posts braised to the crest. Perhaps the heat
would cause discoloration though. Maybe a careful job with a micro
torch would allow use of the original crest. The old crests are no
longer made and the newer crests have a darker red color (if I remeber
correctly). New crests can be ordered from a number of parts houses and
may cost less than $25.

If my car was vulnerable to having the crest stolen, I would want it to
be easy to take. The damage to the paint/sheet metal from someone
prying the crest loose with a great deal of force would be much more
trouble than a new crest. Would a locked car cover reuduce
vulnerability - out of sight... out of mind - or would they just cut
the cover and then rip the crest off?

There is a cable inside the door that runs to the latching mechanism. 
More than likely, all it needs is a little oil. Once inside the door, 
straighten the cable out and let some oil drip down the cable. The door

In prepping the car for a track event, I just noticed that the plastic
coolant tank has that nasty greenish black slime in it, and the oil on the
dipstick is light brown (no foam, though). This sounds like symptoms I have
heard described as indicative of an oil cooler seal failure.

1. Anyone have any competing theories?

2. If it is the cooler seals, how big a job is it to replace them. Easier or
worse than the water pump?

3. What is the correct way to clean the crud out of the cooling system?

4. Is there anything other than changing the oil a couple of times I can do
to clean up the oil system?

Many thanks in advance for the help!

Dave, et al:

Please notice that I said "I do not believe..." which suggests that "I
really don't know but my guess is...".

The reason I said "I do not believe running this wheel/tire combination
will cause you any problems as far as class is concerned" is twofold:

1. The tire sizes talked about are the stock sizes that came on the car.
2. The wheel sizes where options on the car.

And of course he should check the rules. Considering that the wheel/tire
combination was his idea not mine, suggested to me that he would do this
or had done this.

Give people credit for some intelligence. I don't want to have to think
of every possible exception or PCA Region rule when I answer someone's
questions.

Subject: 911 headlights. Intensive wash fluid.


	Two newbie questions about my '89 (Euro) Carrera.

1. Can I replace the 60/55W H4 headlight bulbs with 130/90W? Someone told
me that the 911 headlights don't have a relay in the circuit and therefore
all the current goes through the switch which may not be able to take the
130/90. I'm still waiting to get a copy of the wiring diagram to find out,
but if any porschephiles know ...  Equally, can I replace the 55W H3 front
fog lights with 100W?

2. Does anyone know if the "intensive screen wash fluid" is available
under any other name or by any other manufacturer? I know you don't use
very much of it, or very often, but it's still very expensive.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: RACE: In-car timing equipment



Due to my lack of a consistent pit crew, I'm soliciting opinions
and testimonials on in-car lap timers (i.e. unipro, hot lap, etc.)

Pegasus racing carries Unipro (expensive, but lots of features) and
Hot Lap (cheaper, few features).  Does anyone have any experience
with this equipment or any other similar equipment for this purpose?

I currently run only time trials but will, most likely, enter a club
race or two next year.  During the trials, it's difficult to know
whether seutp changes and different lines are working other than 

feel.  The idea of getting instant feedback on lap times is really
appealing but I'm not sure how much this is worth, or whether there
are better ways to accomplish this (other than chasing other cars).

BTW: Anyone else going to Las Vegas this weekend for the POC time trial
at eLVIS?  A free cold beer is awaiting those who drop by and can recite

    Ehab (and others that are interested):

    A year or so ago after I installed my 5-point harness, I was told
    during a PCA tech inspection that I needed to install a
    anti-compression bar for my shoulder belts.  Not wanting to order
    a bar through Pano (I am cheap and I didn't want to wait for it to
    arrive), I fabricated one out of aluminum.  I worked with an
    awning manufacturer in the town next to mine.  My bar is much
    simpler than the ones sold in pano, but it works.  It is a length
    of box channel aluminum (1" sqaure), mitered at either end to
    interface (via a MIG weld) with aluminum plates (about 3/8" x 2" x
    3").  I've drilled holes in the plates and
    use the existing shoulder belt holes and
    screws to mount to the B colum.  The final product is
    not quite as elegant as the ones sold commercially, but mine is
    light, strong, and it does the job.  It also can be put in or
    taken out in less than 5 minutes.

    Hope this helps.

Subject: Help! 911 Clutch Replacement


Fellow Porschephiles,

The Carolinas PCA Region Fall Tour of the Blue Ridge Parkway is coming up on
October 15 and I'm thinking about replacing the clutch in my '74 911 before the
trip. It can be slipped in 3rd, 4th, and 5th gears. It's been slipping for about
six months without really getting worse, but I'd hate for it to go under
the stresses of a three day jaunt in the mountains. It doesn't really slip
in 1st or 2nd and it pulls up my *very* steep driveway just fine. Will it
hold up for another little while or should I really get it replaced before
the trip? (Money is *tight* right now.)

Also, the pedal is *extremely* stiff and requires a lot of effort to depress.
With this much pressure required, I am worried about the cable snapping. Is
this a valid concern?

My mechanic says the pedal is hard because of the worn clutch, but I've read
about missing assist springs and bad cables causing a stiff pedal. Will the
new clutch solve this problem?

Roughly how long will it take to replace the clutch in my '74 911 Carrera?
I'm a fairly good shade tree mechanic, but I've never done this before. Also,
I don't have the factory manuals, just the Haynes. A full day? A whole weekend?

Also, can anybody who's done a 911 clutch replacement "talk" me through it once,
please. I hate not having the factory manuals but I can't spring for them
right now.

Thanks very very much for any replies,

You might find that AOL etc are actually priced more than, or at least 
competetivly with, a dial-up PPP or SLIP connection via your local
ISP.  If you've become used to all the other wonderful things the I-Net
can provide you, you might prefer to do it that way.  If you like the

at Compu$erve you won't get those at all.

You could also call your local college, many sell accounts with i-net

Steven,

	I'm not too familiar with the offerings of other vendors, however,
I can tell you about Netcom.  The service is a UNIX provider for $17.50
per month.  You get full mail, ftp, telnet, etc...  It's not too bad.  If
you would like more information you can telnet into netcom and use their
information services - Netcruiser.

	1.  Telnet to netcom.com
	2.  Login as guest
	3.  (from memory) This will take you to a menu driven system that will
	    inform you of all their services.  You can register under this 
	    system, too.  If you don't want to register under that system, it
	    gives you a number to call.

Subject: Re. Insurance whining

Charles,

I have been investigating insurance for several months due to
exactly what you are complaining about. My last increase was
rather substantial, and came with the explanation that "well...
they have re-classified your category of cars to a higher risk
pool" No matter that I have zero tickets, zero accidents, zero
claims, and a clean record for 26 years. I was also informed
glibly that the increases can very likely continue without
regard for the individual driving record.

Clearly they are penalizing all of us for the sins of a few
gearheads who wreck their cars and get lots of tickets on a
regular basis.

I am in the process of switching insurance companies (from State
Farm coincidentally) to 20th Century Insurance in Woodland Hills
Ca. My annual premium with them will be approximately half the

Scott,

	I appreciate your concerns about dazzling other drivers, and I do
share them.

	I had the 130/90W bulbs in my 944 for 3 years, and was never
flashed by other drivers. Had I been dazzling them I'm sure that some of
them would have let me know!! In addition, I am fastidious about dipping
my lights (i.e., changing from full/main beam to dipped beam) as soon as
another car comes in sight, often long before they dip their lights.

	If I put 130/90s in the 911 and get flashed, I'd quickly replace
them with the original bulbs - the thought of a blinded driver coming
towards me is not one I relish!

	This was really prompted by a drive in heavy rain/poor visibility a
couple of nights ago. I wasn't going particularily fast, but could still
have done with more light in front of me. It always surprises me that
Porsche don't seem to give their cars the lighting that their performance
requires (and we're not hampered by US lighting regulations here!).

	BTW, I only ever use my fog lights (front or rear) in fog, and
don't drive around with them on all the time like many posers around here!

> Plus, the cops will see you much easier

	Ah yes, but I'll see them easier as well :-)

Subject: 85.5 944 Sunroof Woes (fwd)


To open the sunroof manually, first remove the carpeting in the hatch on
the cargo section wall on the driver's side which will reveal the sunroof
motor and a special wrench held by wing screws. Use the wrench to first
remove the cover from the adjusting screw. Then using the hex-shaped hole
in the wrench, unscrew the adj. screw completely. Now insert the end of
the wrench (prong end) to turn the threaded bushing inside the hole
(counterclockwise) to close, the other way to open. 

Assuming that the cable is still ok, it may be that the adjusting screw 
simply needs to be tightened properly so the cable will not slip. If I 
remember correctly, you need to tighten it using a screwdriver together 
with the wrench (the end of the screw has a slot).

The only 'problem' I've had with my sunroof is that I can sometimes hear 
the motor whirling after it has opened to the fullest (while I'm holding 
down the button). I checked it out as above, but could never find the cause.

Also, I've never figured out the trick to removing the sunroof. The rear 
hooks never seem to disengage

Subject: 85.5 944 Sunroof Woes

My 85.5 944 has a sunroof with two problems with which I'd appreciate
some help.

For one, it doesn't open.  The roof motor whirs when I press the
button, but the roof itself does not move.  As for manually opening
the roof, I must confess to some ignorance.  I've tried
opening the two latches at the front of the roof and pushing
up, but it appears locked.  I'm assuming that the roof must be
tilted open by the motor mechanism, and _then_ manually removed.
The previous owner was up front about the roof problems as well
as the fact that they didn't have an owner's manual describing
how to open the roof.

For the second, the rear roof seal is leaky.  It creates air
noise at highway speeds and allows a little water in during
a car wash.  No rain leaks in.  It takes some force, such as
that generated by the dryer at my local car wash, to force water
in.

Is information on the roof mechanisms in the 924 or 944 Workshop
manuals?  I know there is some intentional overlap in the
manuals, and I'd like to invest in one set now and one set
after my wallet recovers.

I can hear the motor in the driver side cargo section wall.  Is
it connected via a cable to the roof?  Can I get at the
opening mechanism by removing the ceiling trim panel just
aft of the sunroof itsef?

Any and all help is appreciated.  Thanks!

>>I would like to install a oil cooler to the 1972 911T that I own, 
 
>You can certainly retrofit the system from, for example, a 911S of

From what I have found I will end up paying about the same for an 
after-market oil cooler setup, compared to finding factory lines and then 
purchasing a after-market cooler.

Racers Group has a complete kit for $700.00, includes 300psi lines, 
adapters, and cooler.  The thermostat is installed in the line that 
returns oil from the engine to the tank. 

I talked to a guy that has a 1972E, and he had a shop bend solid lines 
for him, that are installed under the car.  He then had a shop in Texas 
drill out the plug that is in the oil filter housing, and install a 
factory thermostat, all 1972 cars used the same housing, the factory just 
drilled out the plug and installed the thermostat.  Then he ran his lines 
from there to the cooler and then into the oil tank.  The oil tank also 
has a bolt that can be removed to gain access the original return.  This 
return access is to a pipe that runs up inside of the tank to spray the 
returning oil at the top of the tank.  This prevents air bubbles and keeps 
the oil under pressure.  He also said to take the tank out and clean it 
out, since the return pipe inside is probably gunked up from non-use.

	By using the factory setup, and getting my own lines bent, or 
using factory lines from another car.  I'm guessing:

	$150.00       Oil filter adapter machining & thermostat
	$200.00	      solid oil lines (junk yard, or custom bent)
	$400.00       cooler
	$100.00       misc fittings and short lengths of flex hose
	=======
	$850.00

The fact that using solid lines is more expensive, I am still going to 
try to use them.  I feel better having a solid line under the car, 
instead of the flex lines, even if the flex lines are steel braided.

 A warning about European Traffic aka Mid-Atlantic Automotive
in Baltimore MD.

Fellow Neters

I found European Traffic to be both unprofessional and dishonest.

8/5     I placed an order for parts with Dan.
        he said the shipment would be made via UPS on or before
        Monday the 8th. It was Billed to MC that day.

8/10    I received a ragged torn up 
        box which had someone else's parts in it.
        (sloppy shipping department practices)
 
8/12    I finally got hold of Dan and he agreed to send
        me an additional part for repacking and 
        sending the wrong box to correct address.
        My two boxes where now to arrive within an additional week.

8/19    Called Dan to complain that neither of my boxes had arrived.
8/24    Each time he made excuses and promised they should have 
8/26    arrived already.

8/30  Dan says he resent a totally new order on 8/29 
      and claims original package was in
        hands of a third party.  He did not know
        what happened to compensation order.
                (I was very skeptical of his story)

9/7     Neither package has arrived, Dan says that
        he 'recalled' 2nd shipment as he though 1st one was sent on to me
        At this point I assumed He was LYING about sending 2nd shipment
        and *cancelled* the order. 
        Dan agreed to credit  me in full plus a fee for packing and 
        sending the wrong box.  This would be done within 48 Hours.

9/9     Despite three calls to Dan he still 
9/16    had not credited my MC 
9/20    for the parts or handling of the other Box.

9/21   I have had to contest the charge with MC and 
       have sent paperwork necessary to take the money away
       from European Traffic's account.

Although Dan seems helpful over the phone, I believe he is not
capable of adequately servicing his accounts.  He has a sloppy
shipping department, makes no successful effort to follow up 
on problems, and makes promises that he does not fulfil.  He 
has wasted a great deal of my valuable time.

The worse of it being, I believe, is his LIES to pacify complaints
and his sloppy handling of other peoples MONEY.

The procedure for disengaging the rear hooks is to put the ignition switch 
in the accessory position and press the sunroof switch to the 'open'

unhook the front latches, lift the back of the roof and pull it off.

This is for an '89 951 with the alarm.  I don't know if the mechanism
is the same for the earlier 944/951.  On my '87 without an alarm, the

    Gee, that was a fun course!  TTOD was still over 50 seconds, 
which is pretty unusual for local events.  I wound up being the 
first car out on course, and the last.  With one "timer error"
(44 seconds!  TTOD fer sure!), six timed runs, and about seven fun
runs, I was pretty worn out.
    The bad news is that Ray Scruggs' 914/6 went off the pavement 
into the "terrain."  As Scott said over the radio at the time, "He's
not hurt.  He's not happy, but he's not hurt."  He trashed his air
dam (fiberglass, no big deal) and it also appears that his front end
has been bent.  He was able to limp it home, as far as I know, but
it won't be racing again until he can fix it.
    More bad news:  Something is not right in my power-train.  More
in a separate post.

914 bucking
    Anyone BT,DT on this?
    I developed a problem in my powertrain (74 2.0L) at the end of 
this Saturday's autocross.  At full throttle in first gear the car
would buck and jerk.  It felt as if I was driving over some very
sharp bumps in the road--my engine lid popped open.  I was able to
repeat the behavior at part-throttle (mostly floored) in first, and
at around 3300 RPM full throttle in second.  Other gears have not
exhibited this behavior.
    Any guesses?  I'm afraid that I may need a new transmission.
Someone also suggested it might be the clutch.  I checked for radial
play in the driveshafts, and didn't feel anything just from twisting
them by hand...  CV's?  I'm going to replace the tranny fluid this
evening and check if I've got any teeth in it...  Sigh.
    Please e-mail me direct--I'm on the digest, and would like input
ASAP.

Subject: Solution for 944/951 sunroofs.


Several people asked about how to remove the sunroof on their 944/951's.

The essential bit of knowledge to figure out, is that the sunroof switch
has a different function when the ignition switch is in the "in-between" 
position than it's normal function.

	
	1. The ignition key must be in the "in-between" position.
	   [i.e. radio on, but not warning lights]

	2. Actuate the sunroof switch as if to open.  You will hear 
	   the motor run, but see no movement.

	3. Sitting in the car seat, put your hand on back of the 
	   sunroof and push slightly.  It should raise.

	4. Removing it should be obvious after that.

	5. Re-installing is just reversing the process.


Hope that gets you some additional sunshine...

FYI,

I got this note from Rahul of rahulnet, who happens to also
be a coworker.

Either some porschephile is framing Ted or Ted's getting back some
of his own medicine, but I thought you'd be interested in hearing his
side of the story.

Yes, provided the physical geometry is unaltered.  I wish I knew more of the
details of this protest, because it doesn't seem like a protestable item to
me.

(For those who haven't followed, we're talking about a protest on a Stock
914 having something to do with the struts).

Based on what I've heard on the net, Esch's protest had something to do with
whether the strut housing had the factory part number.  I guess this makes
sense if the factory strut was a separate housing-and-cartridge, which I
doubt -- more likely, it was an all-in-one unsealed unit where you could
remove the top cap, dump out the guts, and replace the guts with a
cartridge.  Does anyone know for sure?
