This smells like a pretty expensive problem, but could be as
simple as a blocked catalytic converter. The backpressure a blocked
converter would make can cause poor combustion, detonation, and
poor power, all of which you list above. Hopefully that's all it is...

Subject: PAP

Some of you may remember my complaint about being sent used, RUSTY
valve springs when I ordered valve springs from PAP (I didn't specify
NEW - and Harold "forgot" to mention that he was sending used parts).

Well, the story continues - Harold said I could return the springs (at
my shipping cost, of course), and I would be credited.  Well, I did
return the springs, and after two months the credit should have appeared
on my VISA bill.  I checked - no credit.  I just phoned, and asked
Harold what had happened.  He said he was not authorized to give a
credit - only the boss could do that.  He went on to say that the
company never issues credit for returns of used parts.  Well, why didn't 
he call me and let me know some time during the last two months???

Anyway, I'm supposed to call again tomorrow and ask for Jackie.

Just in case you think this is an isolated incident, I've placed about
five orders with PAP, and three of them were screwed up by Harold, all
to my disadvantage.  I was shorted a $5.00 valve cover gasket, and
Harold promised to include it on the next order twice (it never has
arrived); I ordered a new pressure plate, for which I was quoted a very
low price.  It did not arrive, and after two months of promises I cancelled
the order; I ordered a fuel pump kit, and what I got was OLD 
stock, that was opened, although it appeared to be all there.  In general,
I feel like Harold could not care less - screw the customer. 

I've taken most of my business to Imparts, and have been quite pleased
at the difference in attitude and service.

Subject: Sticking lug nuts


The following was given to me as a tech article for our
newsletter.  I thought I would post it here for everyone's
information.  Feel free to comment.

                        Wheels of Porsche
                         by Bob Linville
                     Silver Sage Region, PCA

I am the owner of a 1982 Porsche 928 Weissach that has a locking
device on one of the five lug nuts on each wheel. In ten years of
reading the PANORAMA and our local club magazine, The Sage Tick,
I have never read of an owner having a problem with these locking
nuts; so here is the story of my experience --- perhaps it is a
first.

The experience started with the purchase of new set of Goodyear
VR-50's when all of the lug nut locks could be removed with a key
--- except one! After a frantic hour or more, made extremely
hectic in a very busy tire shop, I finally succeeded in diddling
the stubborn lock loose. The last of the four new tires was then
installed without further incident; however, I resolved to
replace all of the locking nuts with plain lug nuts just in case
I suffered the misfortune of having a flat tire out on the road,
finding another jammed lock, and being obliged to have my Porsche
hauled to town on a trailer because I couldn't remove the wheel.

Some months later I purchased four new lug nuts and proceeded to
replace the locking ones. To my dismay I found the same
troublesome nut bound up again! I applied Lock-Ease, WD-40, and
hours and hours of patient persuasion, all to no avail --- that
lock was stuck this time forever.

I checked with my friendly Porsche dealer mechanic, and he said
the only solution was to remove the lock with a chisel. I used a
3/16" cape chisel and delicately slit the side of the lock
cylinder and removed it without damaging the alloy wheel. All
went well! Every Porsche owner that drives a car with locking lug
nuts should carry a 3/16" cape chisel and a hammer!

The adventure continues --- some 12,000 miles later, I decided to
have the tires rotated and re-balanced at the friendly Goodyear
shop. Of course, they remembered the episode with the stuck lug
nut, but I assured them "no problem" this time since I had
replaced all the locks with standard lug nuts. The tire mechanic,
using a conventional air impact tool, removed all the nuts ---
except one! The impact tool would not break one of the new lug
nuts loose. I had torqued the nut on to the prescribed 94 ft.lbs.
at the time I installed the new standard lug nuts. The mechanic
put a long-handled torque wrench on it and broke it loose with a
loud "POP"! To the amazement of both of us, the nut had sheared
off right at the base of the hexagonal portion, leaving the
rounded seat portion of the nut still tightly in place.

With my previous frustrating experience at this shop a vivid
memory, I felt awful! The mechanic threw up his hands and walked
away. I stared and stared at the bright metal ring embedded
around the lug bolt deep in the wheel recess. It had to be
removed, somehow, before the wheel could be removed. The previous
cape chisel method would not work because the nut seat in the
wheel would inevitably be damaged.

None of us could come up with a solution; so I suggested that
they put the other three wheels back on and I would again take
the cat to my friendly Porsche dealer mechanic. The tire mechanic
thought this was a great idea --- plus secretly hoping to never
see me again!

Yes, the Porsche mechanic had wrestled with this problem before,
but it certainly wasn't his favorite thing to do. Some two hours,
and $75 later, by using a hole saw to fit over the lug bolt and a
drill, the broken portion of the nut was removed. Yes, there was
some resulting damage to the seat in the wheel; however,
hopefully, the wheel won't fly off on a turn at 100 mph!

If I were to be confronted with this problem again, I would try
using a Dremel tool, or similar high-speed die cutting tool, with
a small metal-cutting burr to cut through the bottom web of the
nut on two sides of the lug bolt. I think that this could be
carefully accomplished with little or no damage to the seat.

The Porsche mechanic was kind enough to inform me of the true
cause of my problem with the "frozen" lug nut. It seems that when
aluminum alloy lug nuts are used with aluminum/magnesium alloy
wheels, a product called "Anti-Seize" MUST be used to coat the
threads as well as the seat of the nut before application.

I hope that this little story will be of help to anyone else who
might suffer the misfortune of a similar experience. In summary,
"Zu schnell alt and Zu spat weise."

No cons.  Get AT LEAST one of the many books on buying an old 911 so
you don't get ripped off.

   What is the difference between a S and a T model?

There is a fairly big difference, both in price and performance.  The
S was about 60 more horsepower, in 69 I think the T was 120HP, the E
was 150HP and the S was 180HP.  The S has a front oil cooling loop
(which makes a BIG difference and was an option (rarely found) on the
E and T), forged pistons, different alloy cylinders, much higher
compression, hotter cams, and a really mean mechanical fuel injection.
THe MFI was not available on the T, and on the E that year was not
tuned for high performance the way the S was.  The S has big aluminum
alloy front calipers ("S" front struts), the T has small cast iron
calipers ("M" struts), which makes a big difference in braking.  The S
came with sway bars std, the E and T had them as an option.  The E
and S came with a different gauge setup that is a fairly common option
on the T.  There were a few other differences that I'm fogetting...

The problem with all this is that in 20 years many of these things
will not be there.  The engine may have been rebuilt and the owner too
cheap to replace the S pistons, or the front oil loop may be gone,
etc, etc.  Also, since the S was an incredible sportscar, even by
todays standards, it is usually driven pretty hard, and Ts tend to
weather the years better.  However, the avg price on an S is about 8K
more than a T.  My advice would be if you can find one you can afford,
get it.  The S will appreciate in value faster than a T, so you don't
run the risk of losing money if you realize you can't afford to keep it.

I'm outta here!!! and I'm not going to be reading e-mail very often  
for a while so I need to turn off the porschephiles spout.  I wanted  
to say thanks for an interesting pile of information and discussions.   
This source of information is the hottest around.  Keep up the cool

If you want to reach me, I'll still have the e-mail address for a

Bob -

There was an article in one of the Zone 1 newsletters in the last year or so
about cutting out frozen lug nuts.  There is a specific bit for this purpose;
its dimension or name does not come immediately to mind, but it is not a special
Porsche tool.  If you or the author is interested, I can dig the article out.

Yes, anti-seize by all means!  It is a bit suprising that the mechanic who first
wrestled with the locking nut didn't goop things up correctly.  Perhaps the real
problem was more in the line of a bent or otherwise deformed lug bolt.

S is the only way to go, and you want a '71 if you're looking at
69's or 70's. 

First thing you do, is go get a copy of "The Porsche 911 and 912: A 
Restorer's Guide to Authenticity" by Dr. B. Johnson, from The Practice Ring 
Books in Indianapolis IN. The ISBN is 0-929758-00-5, and you can get it lots 
of places. Don't let the "Dr. B. Johnson" intimidate you -- Brett is a D.V.M.,
not a rocket scientist, and a serious Porschephile of only slightly 
less than maniacal proportions (proPorsche-ions?).  All around good guy,
etc. The book is really good for the pre-74 cars. It stops there, and
I've been waiting for the post-74 book for oh, quite a while now...

Also get Bruce Anderson's book, "The 911 Performance Handbook". It has
everything you never wanted to know about 911s and their kin, from
a seriously technical perspective. You have to read between the lines
to get the real benefit of the book (like why 24mm brake rotors may be
better than 20mm) but it has all the details, so you can "comparison
shop" without having to leave your chair.

I'm in the middle of helping a 944S Turbo owner in the local PCA region
"upgrade" to a '69-to-'71 911S for auto-x, so have seen a lot of the older 
cars recently. Holler if you have specific questions after you have R'd the
FM's.

That's really interesting, every time I've been in Automotion, I've 
gotten really good service. Ditto on mail order (well, phone order).
They listen to what I have to say, they either have or get answers, and
they seem to have a file with my cars salient characteristics in it.
I called up to order brake pads, and one of the first things they asked
was "Is that for your 911 or 914?" -- before I could tell them I had
either. Guess it's tied to my customer number....

P.S. I've never had anything that could even remotely be called service
from PAP though, I've gotta admit... I finally tossed their catalog  years
ago...

I too have had excellent service with Automotion.  I've only had to return
one part so far, and there were "no questions asked."

I can't remember why I thought to ask this, but they even have at their
fingertips how much money you have spent with them.  Boy, was I sorry I
asked...

===

Since we're talking pre '74 911's again...

Stan says: "S is the only way to go"

If money were absolutely no object I'd agree, but rarely is that the case.
Let me play devils advocate here for a sec...  What are you going to use it
for?  Are you looking for a fun street car, or something to race?  How
about taking the money you are going to put into a S and getting a well
maintained T or E... or throwing the extra bucks into a Targa.

I have a '72 T Targa with mechanical fuel injection and I'm quite happy
with it's performance (now that its working correctly).  I don't autocross
- maybe some day I'll change that, and I'll want an S, but for now, about
the only time I could use some more power is when I try to pass up-hill at
60mph.  I live in SF, the only time I can really stomp on it is out on 280
or Skyline on a Sunday morning.  I've taken the T as fast as I care to go,
with more power/speed I might wrap myself around a telephone poll.  For a
street car, I wouldn't change my Targa for an S coupe.  Comments?

P.S. If you try to hold me to any of this I'll just claim it was my evil
twin. :-).

Subject: 911SC wheels

I have a some wheel questions for you folks.  I have an '81 911 SC that I want
to get track wheels and tires for.  The track has eaten the year old rear
street tires.  The car is stock, and will stay that way, except for the recent
addition of a shock tower brace. The car currently has 6x16 and 7x16 wheels
(Fuchs) with 205 55/16 and 225 50/16 street tires.

Will 7x16 and 8x16 wheels fit without having to modify anything?  What size
tires do these wheels take?  I am planning on using either Yoko 008 RS's or
RTU's.

The rear wheel flares look like they can hold well over another inch of width.

Also, what are people's opinions about moving to 15 inch wheels?  One guy has
a newer Carerra and uses 15 inch wheels when he is not running slicks.  He
says that the 15 inch wheels give better turn exit accelaration.  Do they come
in 7 and 8 inch widths?

The main thing I am looking for is much better corner speed.  Tires appear to
be my limiting factor right now.  For more top end speed (over 110 mph) I'll 
just start using 5th gear.

Thanks in advance.

Keith -

I doubt what that guy said about 15" rims giving "better turn acceleration" than
16" rims.  Larger diameter => less sidewall to flex => better handling.  Not a
huge difference, mind you, particularly with the very strong sidewalls built
into BFG Comp T/A R1's and Yoko A008RS'.  But it certainly makes no obvious
sense to me to go backwards.

Dunno about the wider rims.  Best bet is to find someone who's already done it,
rims plus tires.  Not all tires are the same, and this is most noticable when
you're at the edge of what will fit and what will not.  Other mod's to the
suspension will also affect fit: lowering, heavy camber, etc.

Your biggest win, next to improving the driver, will be improved tires.  If
you're not already running one of the two type mentioned above, then go
immediately for the tires.

Happy hunting... Kevin Gross

In most older Porsche 911's that i've seen in Switzerland (and most other makes) the dashboard has cracked due to the summer heat etc.

Is it possible to buy a replacement and fit it without removing the windscreen?  It probably isn't worth it at the moment but is something I may do in the future.

ALso, has anybody bought one of these moulded covers, sometimes in leather, that fits over the dashboard. I've seen them for sale in VW and Porsche in different colours etc. Any comments??

I do tend to agree  with the notion of getting a Targa. I however am 
a purist, and a  maniac. So, I opt for the S. If I had a non-S, I'd
basicly hack it until it was an S, or a "super-S", like with Bremtek
or Willwood brakes, Heim-jointed suspension components, tube frame, etc.
not to mention massive engine upgrades. 

BTW, I am a '72  fan, liking very much the external oil filler and
forward location of the tank. However, I'm looking for a S Targa, and
they're getting kinda hard to find and *really* pricey. Hope you
enjoy your '72, even tho it is a T....

Replacing the whole dash requires removing the windscreen.  Most older
911 have leaky windsheild seals anyway, so its a good idea to update
to the new seal (which has an extra layer of sealing rubber) and
replace the dash.  Not a cheap adventure, though.

   ALso, has anybody bought one of these moulded covers, sometimes in
   leather, that fits over the dashboard. I've seen them for sale in
   VW and Porsche in different colours etc. Any comments??

Yes, they look quite nice, actually.  You won't win any concours
points with it, but it's a good interim solution to ugly cracks.

   acceleration" than 16" rims.  Larger diameter => less sidewall to
   flex => better handling.  Not a huge difference, mind you,
   particularly with the very strong sidewalls built into BFG Comp T/A
   R1's and Yoko A008RS'.  But it certainly makes no obvious sense to
   me to go backwards.

The phrase was better turn EXIT acceleration, which is certainly true
with smaller tires.  Some handling would be sacrificed, but not enough
to make a big difference in our cars.  The RSR I believe ran with 14
or 15 inch wheels on short tracks.  Smaller diameter wheels act like a
short gear set or changing the ring gear.  

Most people upgrade their SCs to 7" rims in the front and 8" rims in
the back.  It's so common  in fact that 6" rims are a dime a dozen.
You can fit 8s and 9s under the SC flares, but you have to run extra
low profile tires, and Comp T/As wont fit, Yokos and Pirellis will,
don't know about RE71s.   The 15" and 14" wheels that are this wide
are VERY expensive, however, so if you do want to go wider you'll
probably have to stick with 16".

   Your biggest win, next to improving the driver, will be improved
   tires.  If you're not already running one of the two type mentioned
   above, then go immediately for the tires.

Now, now, Bridgestone and Pirelli also make good track tires.

Chris -

I guess we understood different things.  Yes, you certainly can put smaller
tires (ie, smaller circumference) on smaller rims and effectively change the
gearing and therefore performance.  A big help at autocrossing, but questionable
at the track.

As far as Pirelli and Bridgestone go, I just don't know anyone who drive's those
brands, which makes me loath to suggest them in the same breath as Yok's and
BFG's, both of which I've driven and am happy to recommend.  I am dying to drive
a set of P Zero C's, as Jack Dimaio (sp?) presented at Tech Tactics.  Latest
word from him is that Pirelli USA is fighting with the mother firm over pricing
and they ain't to be had for love or money.

Entirely changing the subject, today's Autoweek carries news that Porsche and
Footwork have put their relationship on hold.  You won't see the Porsche engine
at an F1 race for a while (er, not that you saw much of it to date anyways).

Cheers... Kevin

Subject: Hot starter won't run
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu
X-Vmsmail-To: @PORSCHE

     I don't often post much to this mailing list, but today I had a 
recurrence of a strange problem with my 914 so I thought I'd see if anyone had 
any ideas what is going on.  The problem is simple - sometimes when I have 
been driving on very long trips, especially when it is hot out it seems, if I 
stop the engine for a few minutes to get gas or something, when I go to start 
it again, the starter doesn't turn over the engine.  I have no problem roll 
starting it, but that can get to be quite a pain.  Tonight I drove from LA to 
Phoenix, and when I got gas in Phoenix, I had the problem.  I tried to listen 
to see if at least the solenoid was engaging, but I have one of those Facet 
fuel pumps that is really noisy at idle, so I couldn't hear whether the 
solenoid was working.  I guess if it wasn't, the starter could be spinning 
just fine (I also wouldn't hear that, I'm sure), and I wouldn't get her 
cranking.
     Has anyone else had this problem?  I've had it for a long time now - in 
fact, I can't remember when the first time it happened was.  But I make these 
long trips in hot weather infrequently enough that I have never bothered to 
worry about it much before.  If I were to try to work on it after resting up 
from the trip, it would be hard to diagnose because as soon as it cools down 
(I guess I'm assuming temp is the relevant parameter), it works fine again.  
The reason I am bothering to worry about it now is that I will be driving this 
beast across the country in a month (can you say "stupid"?), and it would be 
nice to be able to stop without having to worry about parking on a hill!  
Maybe there is some connection that is particularly prone to increased 
resistivity with high T?  I don't know - I'm a planetary scientist, not an EE!
     Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.

Subject: Re:  Hot starter won't run

What you are describing is the solenoid going bad...it has happened in every
914 I know of as well as my 911 (same starter).  Here's what you do to fix it:

Go to your local American (inferior?) parts store and ask for a Ford starter
relay - it is a little smaller than the size of your fist, has a couple of
small studs (terminals) coming out of the middle, and two very large studs on
either side.  This will run you about $6, plus some extra for wires and
connectors.  Get some BIG (12 gauge or so) wire, three large ring connectors
for the side studs and the starter, a female spade connector for the solenoid
(to take the place of the yellow wire), a small ring
connector and a male spade connector.  I'm not good at drawing text pictures,
so I'll describe the connections:  first of all, locate the relay as close to 
the starter as possible while still being accessible and not being in danger
of shorting with something.  Run a large wire from the hot cable on the
starter (coming from the battery) to a large stud on the side of the relay.
Run another large wire from the other large stud to the solenoid (where the
yellow wire normally is connected).  Make an adapter to connect the yellow
wire to one of the small studs on the relay (usually there are two - sometimes
just one) - you'll have to figure out which one works, since I don't remember.

The relay should make a loud click when engaged.  This fix should work most
of the time - however, the solenoid on my 911 got so bad this wouldn't even
engage it...so I just swapped out solenoids with another starter, which fixed
the problem.

The last time I did this fix was on my old roommate's 914 - we were in the rain
under my car cover with a cordless drill installing the thing...must have
looked pretty silly.

Good luck,

Subject: Hot starter won't run


I've seen that problem in 911s, and the cause was usually one of the
following:

1) The solenoid.  Just replace it with a new one.  Apparently when it
   is old and it gets hot it stops working.

2) An alarm system.  Many cheaper alarms will restrict the current
   flow to the starter, and you need more current when it's hot to
   overcome the extra resistance.
   
If you don't have an alarm, then the chances are good the solenoid
needs to be replaced.

Yes!  I had a 914 for about 4 years and my symptoms were exactly the
same as yours,  drive the car for a long period of time, turn it off for a
short period, and the starter wouldn't turn over.  At least 5 different
mechanics worked on this problem without success.  I had the solenoid replaced,
the wiring replaced, new starter installed, "start kit" installed, etc.
Each time the problem would go away for a period of time, only to return
when I had begun to trust the car again.  Luckily I rarely drove the car
over long enough distances to create the problem.

I have heard of rabbit owners with similar problems building homebrew "heat
shields" for their starters.  I don't know if that's feasible on the 914.
Another person suggested carrying freon to spray on the starter in an attempt
to cool it down more rapidly.

Unfortunately I totalled the car before I could try any of these
suggestions :-(.

     Thanks to everyone who replied to my posting.  I think I am going to try 
Jeff Shorey's tip about the Ford starter relay first, since it looks like the 
cheapest alternative.
     Someone posted something about Rabbit owners using "heat shields".  That 
brought to mind something I ought to pass along to anyone with vapor lock 
problems (most likely with FI 914's - that's what mine *used* to be).  I was 
making the cross country trek once a few years ago, and I was having the same 
fuel vapor lock problems every 914 owner seems to get.  The problem got 
particularly bad in Texas (this was in June) - I couldn't get more than 100 
miles down the road in the morning before vapor lock would kick in, and then 
I'd have to wait an hour for things to cool down before I could go another 50, 
then 25, and so on.  Well, one of my main research areas is in the thermal 
infrared remote sensing of other planets, and anyone who works in the IR 
knows that conductors are perfect reflectors of IR radiation.  So I decided I 
would get smart and wrap the fuel lines and pump in aluminum foil to keep the 
IR out.  Well, it worked *great* - I went for six hours without any vapor lock 
under the same conditions that had left me stranded the day before.  The bad 
news was that vapor lock had been saving my engine - it was running very lean 
(although I didn't know it at the time), and the lack of vapor lock allowed 
the engine to continue warming up.  When I pulled into a drive-through to get 
some dinner, all of a sudden the meager air-cooling I did have was gone, and 
everything fried.  I had to find some hick VW mechanic in East Texas who 
didn't know his a** from a hole in the ground to rebuild the engine - it ended 
up taking 10 months and three trips to Texas before I finally got the car 
back.
     So the moral of the story is: a) don't use heat shields unless you 
are sure there isn't a reason things are overheating, b) if you don't have a 
temp gauge, put one in, c) avoid breakdowns in east Texas at all costs!

Thanks again for all the help.
Jeff

I also used to get vapour lock due to excessive heat from the engine, this was
mainly due to the fuel line running to close to the engine where it went into
the carb. I never actually managed to cure it but to restart my car when it
ground to halt was quite easy. I had a set of aftermarket air-horns, you know
the type that have a compressor on them. I would then disconnect the fuel line,
attach the compressor to the fuel line and reverse the electric current so the
pump used to suck, not blow. Always worked.

I'm wondering how big a battery I need for my Porsche 914 2.0 autocrosser.
In particular, how many amp-hours?  Are there any other issues I need to
consider?

Should I get a racing battery, a motorcycle battery, a tractor battery, or
what?  I'm looking for the lightest weight battery that will serve the
purpose, obviously.  Cost is a factor.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

I have been running a Sear's Diehard motorcycle battery in my '83 RX-7 for
about 2 years.  The only time I have had trouble is during the dead of
winter, and one of the cells was low on water.  Other than it has worked
fine.  In fact, mine is mounted in back so the cable runs are even kind of
long.  On your 914, I think a motorcycle battery would work fine, you don't
have very high power requirements.  To ad another data point, A guy that
use to autocross around here (SSC Miata now), has an ASP RX-7 turbo that he
put a motorcycle battery in for awhile, and he had a problem with the
batteries going bad, the cases would actually start to expand.  I wouldn't
recomend a motorcycle battery for a new car for this reason.

	Since I got my '85 (oval dash) 944, I have had a number of niggling
intermittent (and hard) electrical faults.

1. The windscreen washers only work intermittently and never in the
"washers only" switch position.

2. The sunroof will only open occasionally (although it will always
close OK - so far!).

3. The MPG dial stopped working on the way in to work this morning.
(How does this work? ... the Haynes manual doesn't mention it).

4. The throttle switch is dead.

5. One of the horns (the low one) is dead.

6. One of the connectors to the rear screen heater was broken (now
fixed).

	Are 944s bad this way, or am I just unlucky? Is there any
particular earth point which works loose or something and causes
intermittent problems (... is life ever that simple?)?

Broadly, I believe that the electrical design of recent vintage Porsche
designs, including the 944, is reasonably good. I have had no electrical
problems per-se with my '87 944S, but in addition the contact quality,
environmental protection, etc. of the electrical connections seems quite
good. I had a 914 before the 944S, which relied heavily on electrical
connections for the fuel injection, and poor connections were a significant
issue in reliability. If you took care of them you were generally OK,
but if you didn't they could cause problems. The 944 series designs
appear to be more robust.

The sunroof seems to be a common problem, but most of the cases I have
seen or heard of were mechanical problems, typically the mounting or
positioning of the limit switches in the actuator mechanism in the LR
fender well. Your intermittent problem in one direction only could
well be the limit switch position adjustment.

I have not heard of other examples of the other problems you listed.

Battery acid can cost a lot of demage in a 914.
I just repaired the rust demage in the engine compartment
created by the battery acid in my 914/6. I had  to replace
the battery box, battery box support, and right side
engine bay sheet metal ($125 for that little piece!), 
plus a lot of rust repair.
My suggestion is to use a sealed gel type battery. Don't
forget, after the battery box goes, the acid is going to drip 
on to the right side control arm.
I just ordered a Gates battery from "Auto Mechanika"800-582-2886.
for $114(45lb). They claim that this battery can be mounted in any position
and it won't leak, it fits the 914 battery box.  
This is the first time I order anything from them.  They advertise 
in Panorama.

Good Luck
Alfred

PS-I have seem 914s will battery box relocated to the front.

 I've just relocated my battery to the right front. It was
 a bit of a job and not un-costly. Looks great though and 
 works very well..

My 944 is an oder '83 model which I've owned for over 5 years.  It
has also developed a couple of trivial but annoying faults in this area.
The back windscreen wiper died, then the left door electric window
lift, and the left door electric mirror adjustment (unrelated to the
window).  In all cases it was because of dirty or corroded contacts.
The local Porsche distributor loves to change things over at the first
sign of trouble, so the back wiper I cleaned up (simple job) and I
had to insist on them fixing the left door electrics (two occasions) rather
than paying $1,500 for replacing them (!).  The electric motor for the window
had to be stripped and cleaned, but is now good as new.

So, perhaps this points to poor sealing of some contacts and motors.
Repair in these cases seems quite simple, and cheap!

Subject: Re: Electrical problems on 944.
Message-Id: <74910713020247/0004056890NA2EM@mcimail.com>

Like Frank, I have generally not heard many complaints about electrical problems
in 944's, or any 80's-forward Porsche for that matter.  There have been minor
nits, like the shorting alarm in the new Carreras.  I have heard it said that
the MPG indicator tends to be short-lived, but not often enough to form a
meaningful sample.  I'd like to know more about you car's age, miles, and
storage before I jump to any rash conclusions.

On the electrical end, I would just get busy with a volt-ohm meter, a wire
brush, and a bottle of lubricating contact cleaner.  You may find a broken wire,
or you may find that salt and neutrinos have corrided a contact.  Go through the
wiring, opening electrical connectors and inspecting.

One thing I have seen in a couple of cars is a connector prong or socket
(prongee?) which has been pulled back in its shell, and is either making
marginal or no contact with its mate.  This happened in one of my 944S' mirror's
connectors, probably when bodywork was done.  A few of the non-critical
connector assemblies, like this one, are kind of chintzy, imho.

As far as the horn goes, the wiring there is pretty much exposed to the
underside of your car's existence.  I could see a piece of road debris trashing
a wire, and would start looking there: close to the horns.  I have seen a couple
of cases of loose wires to the horn and side marker lamps.  They are supposed to
be secured by a clip which pushes over the end of a piece of body metal.  These
clips seem to come loose or take a powder.  Cable ties are called for.

My moon roof stopped working once, too.  The mechanism is a very simple worm
gear-driven cable deal, in my car (and I think in yours), driven by a motor
located in the rear hatch on the driver side.  Mine jammed during an "incident,"
and disassembling the motor mechanism and putting it back together cured it.  I
believe the jam was between the nylon worm gear and its large mating nylon gear.
Disassemble, clean, lubricate, reassemble.  Make sure the drive cabe does not
bind and is not broken.  As Frank suggests, I would also check out the
microswitches, cleaning and lubricating them as necessary.  The workshop manual
is fairly helpful in explaining the workings, if not in diagnosing.

By the way, you can buy a wiring manual for your car from Porsche at a
reasonable price, that is to say, for a lot less than the full workshop manual
set.  Or you might impose on a friend to lend you his/hers.  They're very well
done and readable by automotive standards.

Happy hunting, and let us know what you find!

Subject: Eezi Bleed power bleeder
Message-Id: <35910713184953/0004056890NA4EM@mcimail.com>

I posted this item to a couple of other lists recently.  It occurred to me today
that there had been some discussion of bleeding hydraulic clutches in
'porschephiles' - so here it is again.  Sorry for the clutter to those of you on
the other lists.

By the way, the difference between the Eezi Bleed and the arrangement that Frank
Kerfoot uses is that the former has a supply of fluid in a bottle with two hoses
coming out of it.  One hose goes to the air supply and pressurizes, the other
hose takes fluid from the bottom of the bottle and feeds the reservoir.

_______________________________________________________________________

Someone on one of these lists recommended this tool a while ago. 
Well, mine showed up yesterday and got put to good use today.  I can report that
it does a fine job of bleeding both brakes and - yow! - the hydraulic clutch. 
The latter has been a real thorn because the slave cylinder is at an angle which
makes getting trapped air out almost impossible (Porsche 944S), but getting air
trapped in it a breeze.

Someone else mentioned the limited expected lifetime for the product.  Probably
also quite true.  The parts are almost all plastic and/or low to medium quality.
The plastic locking air-chuck looks like it would be the first to go - kind of
cheap.  However, all the parts can be pretty easily replaced.

In fact, I home-brewed a pretty similar device a few months ago.  (The trouble
was that I could not get the reservoir extension to stay put.  I now know that
that was because it was a 46 mm. (1.75") Girling "cap", going onto an Ate 44 or
45 mm. thread.  Dumb!  I thought problem was that the thread was too short.) 
When that air-chuck dies, I have a nice brass one waiting to take its place.

The Eezi Bleed comes with a large assortment of reservoir caps.  If one doesn't
match your car, you simply buy a spare OEM cap a drill a hole in it.  Easy.

Well worth the $36.00 smackers.  Get yours from Moss Motors, Ltd.

There are a couple of different brands of specialty racing batteries  
on the market (Pulsar is one, but there are others).  These have some  
advantages - the posts are standard, so you don't have to mess with  
figuring out a good way to hook it up.  They are intended to be used  
as car batteries, so they have adequate power (though I've heard that  
they still don't tend to last very long, like more than a year).   
Disadvantages are that they are odd sizes and they tend to be  
expensive (on the order of $100!).  I shopped around, and eventually  
got a lawn tractor battery.  It cost about $30, shape is fairly  
standard, though the size is small - it was easy to construct a  
wooden spacer so the stock hold-down works, has adequate power (it's  
weakening lately, but it started the car in zero-degree weather over  
the winter!), and it weighs half what the stocker did (15 vs. 30).   
Also, the posts were such that I didn't have to mess with the battery  
cables.  One went over a post, but on the other I had to use the bolt  
on the cable, and went through the mounting hole in the post.  It was  
pretty obvious, even if it doesn't sound like it here...  The Baileys  
used to use the smallest 12V motorcycle battery they could find in  
their Golf - some 7 pounds!  They replaced it a couple of times a  
year, though, and didn't use it for anything but autocrossing.  That  
was part of their pre-event setup and teardown.

Subject: what do you think about the 914


I am thinking of getting a 914 and wanted to get a feeling what I was
getting into.  What is the maintenance, upkeep expenses like, what
goes wrong with them, are they worth it, how do they compare
performance wise to other cars, esp. the 911 etc?

I think my dream 914 would be a 
	'73 with 2.0L Targa roof
	opt. A/C 
	Guards Red
	No rust, very-good mechanically
	shot upholstery O.K. but dash should be in good shape
	
I own a '78 VW Vert, so I now some things about Bosch Fuel injection,
and VW engines, but I understand many things are not really VW like, or
use VW parts.

How is the suspension/steering?  I read somewhere it was the same as
the 911 in the front, but different in the back.  What sort of repair
manuals should I use, what is the cost?  What should I watch out for
when looking for a 914?  Any other helpful suggestions?

I am a new subscriber, so if any of this is in a FAQ posting, sorry, I
haven't got it yet.

Sorry to broadcast this, but Philip's return address bounced when I originally
sent the following.
______________________________________________________________________________

Philip -

I suffer in that I have an '87 944S with rather different electronics.  I have a
picture in my workshop manual of a device which may be the one your are
describing.  From the picture, I cannot tell exactly where it is under the hood.
The thing is mounted on a flange of metal, the latter secured by two bolts to
the bay.  When the lid is popped off it, you see what I think are four pin
sockets and one LED.

Does this sound like what you're wondering about?  It is used to adjust the idle
speed.  You have to bridge pins B and C, which stops "operation of the idle
speed filling control."  I dunno what they mean by that.

Drawn very crudely:

               _______  
      A -->   / o   o \ <-- B
       + --> | o_____o | <-- LED
              \___o___/
                  ^
                  C

Pin C is in a block of plastic (which is what the dashes are meant to
communicate); the other pins and LED are in little islands.  Having bridged B
and C, you adjust the idle to 840 +/- 20 RPM.  If this isn't the connector you
have in mind, send me a longer description and I'll go hunting.  I ran out to
the garage, but could not find any such thing on my car.  What year is your car?

I really don't know the MPG indicator.  If you are idling without moving, I
might expect the indicator to show really poor mileage!  You're burning gas but
going nowhere.  One in a friend's '84 seems to bounce all over the place.  I
would, as a first check, look at my gas mileage and have the exhaust gases
checked.  (In most US states, the exhaust gas is check annually to make sure the
car isn't polluting, and therefore, is reasonably well tuned.)  If both are
reasonable, and clouds of smoke don't billow out the tailpipe, I wouldn't worry.

I have a Haynes manual too.  The pictures are great, the tips and procedures are
very helpful and practical, but it lacks much real detail.  The new edition I
have is supposed to cover the 944S and 951, but it ain't so, not even lip
service.

Keep me posted.  Perhaps you can find a Bosch-certified shop nearby for a
check-up.

Kevin

Subject: Modifying Porsche 911 for leadfree petrol

	
In England there are a number of companies selling reconditioned engines for MGB`s,Triumphs, Mini's etc that have been modified to be able to run on leadfree petrol 100% of the time. Has anybody seen such offerings for 911's.	

Also, does anybody have experience of fitting catalysors to cars not originally fitted with them, what problems would be involved etc, is it possible with a 911??

The reason I ask about this is that there are proposals in Switzerland to ban the sale of leaded petrol in a few years time and presumably this type of ban will eventually become more common in other countries (Sweden,Germany,Holland etc). 

Is leaded petrol widely available in the USA, how long is it since the legal requirement for cars to have catalysors(and therefore to run on unleaded petrol) has been in force?, is there a plan to ban the sale of leaded petrol??, what other plans are proposed ( Eg electric vehicles in California).

Subject: Re:  Modifying Porsche 911 for leadfree petrol

Well, I have an '81 European 911 that has been "federalized", which meant
adding the catalytic converter and modifying the filler spout to only
accept unleaded gas. Bah. Humbug.

I'm usually a pretty green kind of guy, and tend to largely be law abiding.
But this "stuff a catalytic converter on a Euro car" stuff is pure nonsense.
For starters, the engine in this guy (930/10) has 9.8:1 compression, compared 
to the 9.3:1 for the U.S. engine (930/16) and the 8.6:1 for the '80 U.S. 
engine (930/07). On a hot day, or when pressed *real* hard (and when *DON'T* 
you press one of these guys hard?) it pings like a son-of-a-gun. Usually right 
about 4,000 RPM. Not great.

So, I went out and re-modified the filler spout, and got myself a catalytic
bypass. For auto-x and the like, I swap back to the "leaded" configuration
and go get a half tank of 100  octane leaded racing gas, with half a tank of
super unleaded. After that's all out, I run another tank of super-unleaded
throught it, then re-install the cat.  According to my mechanic, this 
should be OK on the cat, and only a mild inconvenience for me.  Bullshit on
the minor inconvenience part.

If I  were going to do it all over again, rather than federalize a Euro
engine, I would just buy a U.S. spec engine and setup, and swap the whole
damned thing. That way I'd at least have a Euro spec engine to swap back
in for the performance events. Or, I'd build a U.S. spec performance engine
that could deal with super unleaded  octane levels. But this is getting
*REALLY* old... (not to mention hurting my performance in the PCA autox
events...)

My 1983 944 needs a new radiator.  This is the third time in 4 years
and 40000 miles since I bought the car. (103000 total miles on the car)

This is the second failure related to the fan temperature switch which
screws into the radiator. Should I buy a Porsche radiator from the
dealer for $430, an OEM radiator from a major mailorder place for
$300-360, or $250 from a unknown (by me) Panorama advertiser, or
should I buy a high-performance radiator (brass instead of plastic)
manufactured by Autotechnic and sold by Performance Products for $440? 
(or should I avoid the radiator/water pump problems by buying a 911?)

Any advice or experience is welcome. (and the sooner the better)

Huh?  Three radiators in four years?  Something is wrong.  Who has done the work
in the past?  They apparently didn't fix whatever the problem is.

If this work was not done by a Porsche dealer, hie thee elsewhere.  If it was,
get them to stand behind their work.  Speak to the PCNA area rep. if need be;
they can be very helpful.  Radiators and tempostats should not fail repeatedly
after a year or so of use.  Despite a nominal one-year guarantee on parts, my
experience has been that PCNA goes way beyond that in goodwill.

Also make sure you are getting the latest upgrades applicable to your year car. 
The 944 radiators have been upgraded a few times over the years.  I am unsure
what sort of retrofitting is possible, but your dealer should.  There are a few
tech bulletins applicable.

Hope this helps... let me know how you make out.

I'm going to be moving to San Diego and would like to get 
opinions on Porsche mechanics and drivers' schools in that area.

For mechanics, I'd appreciate hearing warnings about bad
ones as well as recommendations for good ones. I'm willing
to consider Porsche dealers as well as independents. First
choice would be in the northern SD area, around University
City or Mira Mesa.

For schools, I've found someone who belongs to PCA, but I'd
like to find out about schools sponsored by other groups that
allow marques other than their own. (As, for example, I'm told
the BMW club here in the Bay Area does.)


Thanks!

Subject: Bob Forsythe/944S Chip


About a year ago, Bob Forsythe advertised an AutoAuthority chip for
a 944S on the net. I have (very belatedly) decided I might be interested.
Unfortunately, his old login on "nucleus" appears to be no longer
active. Since he owns a 944TS as well as the 944S (which was apparently
stolen), I thought he might be lurking here in Porschephiles,
or that someone might know of his whereabouts. Any luck? 

On a similar subject, does anyone have specific knowledge of the
degree of improvement to be had from a chip in an 87-88 944S (16 valve)?
My car seems to be on the lean side overall, including starting,
and I have excluded all of the obvious things such as fuel pressure,
air leaks, inputs from the temperature sensors, etc. as discussed in the manual.
I don't think it is exhaust valve deposits, since it happens even while
cranking and continues somewhat even when warmed up. It just appears
that the fuel injection is uniformly on the lean side. I would like to
try a chip and see if it fixes it, since I suspect that they do some
overall richening as part of their magic. More power wouldn't hurt either :-)

If you change/rebuild the old style tensioners every 20K miles (every
valve check) they won't fail, unless you are going to track your car.
Additionally, you can install a sleeve on the old style tensioners
that will prevent it from collapsing all the way.

DO NOT USE THE SOLID MECHANICAL TENSIONERS, which are tensioned
statically with a nut.  These will cause the chain to stretch in a few
thousand miles,and also preload the intermediate and cam shafts.

The Carrera tensioner update is definitely recommended.  Taking apart
the old and new style tenioners you can see why they are so much more
reliable.  The old style has a tiny O-ring which seals in the fluid.
The new style has two very large seals which are hard enough to get
through, AND are continuously fed with oil so that even with a leak
there will be tensioning pressure.  Be sure to also update your idler
arms, as the old style have been known to bind up.  Be sure also to
get the update to the tensioner update, which includes some harnesses
for the new oil lines that prevent them from vibrating against the
timing cover.

It's not that hard to install, doesn't require removal of the engine.
Just remove the rear engine sheet metal, the timing covers, take out
the old tensioners, and put in the new ones.  I think the kit is
around $350.

The old style tensioners will fail.  If you track your 911, it is
foolish to run without updating the tenioners (take it from a fool).
There aren't many sounds worse that those untensioned chains scraping
against the inside of the timing housing.

Thanks for the info, I take it that your tensioners failed then and presumably buggered the valvegear in the process. 

I really pissed off with the local BMW dealer here who didn't change the timing belt on my 3 series at the correct time resulting in a 2800.- Sfr bill (~ $2100). 

So i`m really concerned about the Porsche (911T ,`73 carburetor model) which I cannot use on the roads until a small amount of accident damage is repaired (I bought it that way) and consequently it's difficult to assess what state the timing chain(and tensioners are in). 

I wouln't say that there is a lot of clatter/noise from this area but without knowing the history of the car or having driven it much I haven't a lot of confidence in it??

Any suggestions for assessing what state the tensioner is in??

Thanks

It's time to replace the brake pads on my '87 951.  I'm currently using
the stock Porsche pads, but since I'm attending track events fairly
regularly now (Rd. Atlanta twice a year, Talledega 3 or 4, probably Rd.
America over Labor Day - and 3 or 4 autocrosses), I'm concerned that I
ought to replace the stock pads with Repcos or somesuch.

What exactly should I be looking for? If I call and ask for Repco pads,
will that specify what I need? Or is Repco just a brand name (eg. is
there a particular product I should specify)?

Hi Folks,

I have to replace the wing on my '73 911 and have a secondhand wing to put on when it's cleaned up and sprayed, but I have just noticed in a price list in Porsche Post( PCGB) that a front wing was advertised as for a 69-73 model.  

What I want to know is how did it change for '69 and how to distinguish between a `68 and a '69.

  The difference between a pre-69 front 911 wing and a 69-73 is that a slight
flare was added in the later version.  Also, the horn grill was made smaller on
the later model, although you might be able to get around that.  In 74, they
eliminated the cage for the turn signal in the fender - it was moved to the
bumper, which sat higher up on the car.  This also required shortening the
hood...

Subject: Chain tensioners...



   If you replace the tensioners (I have the '83 SC tensioners on mine
   - so this is of interest to me), wouldn't it be a good idea to
   reset the cam timing?  If so, you need the micrometer/fixture
   setup, as well as the cam tools.

This is a good question, so I'm reposting it.

If you don't change the timing of the cams, then you don't have to
retime them.  To do this, you must make sure that the chain doesn't
slip on the cam or intermediate shaft sprockets when you take out the
chain tensioner.  This of course is what the chain tensioner is
supposed to do, so with it out you will have to tension the chain by
hand.  If it does slip, you will have to retime them - but you only
need to do the "gross" timing, since the exact timing should already
have been set (unless you are changing the chains, too).

Here's the steps for changing just the tensioners:

1) remove the sheet metal
2) remove the timing covers
3) loosen the spark plugs
4) turn the crank to cylinder 1 TDC.  Remember the Z1 mark on the
   crank pully indiciates EITHER cylinder 4 TDC or cylinder 1 TDC.  To
   tell which, look at the distributor, or, with the timing covers off,
   the dots on the cams should be at the top.
5) remove one tensioner, keeping tension on the chain after removing
   it.
6) Inspect the 3 (on each side) plastic chain rails.  If any of them
   are damaged, they should be replaced.  One of them is a different
   color, and is very hard to get to, but be sure it OK.
7) If chain skipped a tooth on the cam sprocket while the tensioner
   was out, then turn the cam so that the dot is back at the top, and
   with the chain fully tensioned, put it back on.  Since the cam
   timing should already have been set, and since the crank is at
   1TDC, this will put the cam timing back exactly to where it was when
   you started.  This is why having the crank at TDC before you start is
   important. 
8) Put in the new tensioner and idler arms.  
9) pull out the pin on the new tensioner, and the arm will shoot up
   and tension the chain.
10) Repeat 5-9 for the other side.
11) put back the covers, be sure the o-rings on each tensioner are in
    place, and that a new gasket is used for the covers.
12) remove the old cam oil lines, replace with the new ones.  
13) install the new oil lines that feed the tensioners, and the
    brackets that keep them from vibrating (you should be sure when
    ordering a tensioner update kit that you are getting the 86 (i think)
    update to the kit that includes these brackets)..
14) before reinstalling the sheet metal, cut a notch in the right side
    since the new oil line there goes to the underside. Make the notch
    as small as possible, but not so small that the new line comes in
    contact with it.  Remember, the purpose of that sheet metal is to
    prevent the fan from drawing cooling air from the hot underside.
15) replace the sheet metal.

Of course this is from memory so I might be forgetting something, but
it's the basics.

Subject:  911 timing Chain


   Thanks for the info, I take it that your tensioners failed then and
   presumably buggered the valvegear in the process.

Yes.  I kept telling myself I would update the tensioners soon, and
that I would take it easy at the track.  But after two events going
around slow with the yellow group, I got tired of it and went out in
white.  I was keeping up with the SCs when suddenly I heard a noise...
Luckily, I have a spare engine with the tensioner update already
installed so I'll beat on that one while I rebuild the other.  One
failed tensioner can mean a complete rebuild.  It was due for one
anyway (200K mi)...

   I really pissed off with the local BMW dealer here who didn't
   change the timing belt on my 3 series at the correct time resulting
   in a 2800.- Sfr bill (~ $2100).

It would be more if it happend to your 911...

   So i`m really concerned about the Porsche (911T ,`73 carburetor
   model) which I cannot use on the roads until a small amount of
   accident damage is repaired (I bought it that way) and consequently
   it's difficult to assess what state the timing chain(and tensioners
   are in).

   I wouln't say that there is a lot of clatter/noise from this area
   but without knowing the history of the car or having driven it much
   I haven't a lot of confidence in it??

If there's noise then they have collapsed already.  It doesn't matter
what the state is, replace them (or if you decide you want to rebuild
them every 20K miles, do that).  This way you know the state.

BTW, just so you know, the 73T was not originally available with
carbs, only with fuel injection.  SO if you have carbs they were put
on later.

I'll add a little to what has already been posted, agreeing with everything
said so far...

This is not a difficult job but I'd caution against going after it with a 
Crescent (variable spanner for you Euro types) wrench and some found 
by the side of the road screwdrivers :-)

If your engine repair experience is limited to washing the car and changing
oil, I'd recommend against it. However it's not a big deal for a 
fairly decent shade tree mechanic.  One must be careful to not allow the
chains to slip a cog (I wired mine, special tensioners are available).  
I found the hardest part to be installing the new chain ramps which should
be replaced as part of this job, some are in kind of tight places (and I 
have skinny fingers!).  Otherwise quite straightforward, I didn't need to
upgrade idler wheels it turned out, but I had mine off in checking.

I also remember something about pulling the rear motor mounts and having
my engine partially supported on a floor jack.  This may be necessary
or just make things easier.

When I bought my kit, Alan Johnson Racing here in San Diego had the best
price I found (around $300.00 I think - $50.00 less than the going rate).
Their kit was absolutely complete.

Subject: 914 collision


Hi Robert. I was browsing through rec.autos.sport and started reading the
article containing the responses about the miata. I noticed your response:

>I don't know how safe a Miata is in a collision.  I doubt that my 914
>would do too well in a collision.

I thought I'd let you know. I had an significant accident with my previous
914 in 1986 (the car was totalled in a collision, some pinhead ran his red
light during my green left-turn arrow and hit the car almost head-on,
off-center towards the passenger-side headlight). Both my passenger and I 
walked out of the wreck without even a daze (well, ok, we were a bit
disoriented at first (-:). The only reminder was a red mark across my chest
for a couple of days caused by the shoulder belt. The front of the car
crinkled perfectly to absorb the shock, text-book case. This doesn't mean
that I condone reckless driving, but this way you can feel safer driving your
914 knowing that in the event of an accident, it's a safe car, unlike a lot
of "older" cars. Take care, and I hope you never have to find out.

There must be something about red lights and 914s: mine was hit from behind
when I stopped for a red light on Soldiers Field Road at 2:30am. The driver
of the Mustang behind me "just assumed" that I would run the light, so he
hammered it, stopping just short of my engine. So much for that one, but I
have to agree that the car crumpled up just like it should and that I suffered
only emotional trauma.

Subject: Green_911's


A few times i've asked about running 911's on unleaded petrol etc, and have received some useful information, with the basic reply that older 911's shouldn't really use it :-( :-(


However,

In the latest edition of Porsche Post ( PCGB's magazine ) a firm called Oselli were advertising their "Green Heart" conversion. I've sent for their info and i'm quite impressed with what they do in this conversion and while their price guide for the conversion shows that it's not cheap ( 100 pounds per cylinder as a guide, excluding low volume exotic V8's and V12's), it's probably not much more, and maybe less ( I havn't asked), than Porsche themselves would charge for a simple top end overhaul.

I'm waiting to hear from them for a specific price quote for the costs of the conversion on my engine ( they will perform this conversion on ANY car, Mini or Ferrari) and i'll post this info when I get it but if anybody wants any more info in the meantime mail me.

I realise that it's of little interest to people outside of the UK but at least it shows that reputable companies can provide a service that will enable "our" cars to run when the leaded stuff is not available any more!!

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

My '74 914 2.0 has an annoying clunk which is most audible when the
engine is either idling roughly or lugged (not enough throttle on
upshift).  The car need not be moving to clunk.  It sounds as if it's
something loose in the engine compartment on the right side, but all
my attempts to locate the source have failed.

I know it's impossible to diagnose this over email, but my luck here
has been so good in the past...

I'm looking for responses like 'The <suchandsuch> always comes loose
on these cars' or 'try sticking your head in the <whatever> (watch
it!)  while someone floors it to see what you can hear'...

It's not the roof (stowed in the back).
It's not the FI control box.
Nothing else in the top of the engine compartment seems loose...
