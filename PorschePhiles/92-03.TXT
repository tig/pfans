Kevin. Sounds like a problem I've experienced before in which case you won't
need to touch the handle itself. There is very likely a ball and socket set up
in the linkage which needs to be adjusted to shorten the linkage. Access is
gained by removing the inside door panel. Newer versions have a neoprene
socket which is threaded onto the end of the linkage and can be readily
popped off the ball for adjustment. When the neoprene ages, the threads become
ghosts of their former selves making replacement essential. Anyway, once the
door panel is off it's an easy job. Cheers. Ken.

Subject: Monthly Note From Your Moderator

March 1992
Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

With spring coming and autox season well underway by this point, consider 
this an official note of encouragement to get involved in driving your car
the way it was meant to be driven! You'll like it. Trust me.
If you need details, don't be afraid to post your questions.

As I got the USA-centricity inherent in my posting of the PCA office info
last month pointed out to me, I will also include the info for joining
any other national Porsche Club. Just mail it to me.

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 60792

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are about 125 members of the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes).

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address. Such messages are discarded.

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Has anybody seen the 1/2 hour commercials for this color coded car wax...
chromacolor 2000 or some such name.  They take a backpack sandblaster to the
hood of a 911 and then use the wax to bring back the shine.  Pretty impressive
if it works.

Subject: Bay Area Porsche Repair

Are there any Bay Area Porschephiles who can recommend a repair
facility on the Penninsula?  Specifically I am looking for a place
to have a 911 or 912 checked out prior to purchase.

Also, general guidelines on what to look for/what to avoid on pre-
1970's 911-912 would be helpful (besides the obvious service records,
etc.)  I'm sure there are books available; can anyone recommend one in 
particular?

Thanks,

Vol

 Porsche 911 Performance Handbook, by Bruce Anderson has
one chapter on buying used Porsche 911s with some useful
information on serial numbers and what they mean. I
recommend it specially if you eventually want to increase
the performance of your car. I found it at B Dalton
bookstore for $18.95.

I had pre-purchase inspections done at both Garretson's and BW's, both
in Mountain View (not on the same car!).

I felt that Garretson's probably did a more thorough job, but you didn't
get to speak with the mechanic directly.  The receptionist gives you the
mechanic's report.  The receptionist is very good, but it's not the same.

I think BW's spends less time on the inspection, but on one car I brought 
in they found soooo many things I'd missed that I wasn't too worried.

BW's did the inspection on the car that I bought.  So far, nothing major
has gone wrong in 2 years and about 24k miles.

However...

They did miss that something happened to my car.  I can't find any sign
of crash repair, but the hood (at least) has been repainted and the 
windshield was broken at one time (glass is not Sekurit, I found broken
glass under the floor mat, and the starting instruction decal has a 
928 part number).  So I don't know what happened, just that something
did!

Ken's Sportech has been recommended for an auto-x allignment and seems to 
have a good rep with the local pca region.  I have not done business with
them.

I also recommend the "911 Performance Handbook" by Bruce Anderson.

I believe that you cannot update the cam chain tensioners on the '65
to '67 911's.

Watch out for rust, check the headlight buckets and behind the tail lights.

I have a feeling that Garretsons may have gone out of business, but I'm 
not sure.

Ken,
	I doubt if the glowing exhaust manifold is normal on 931's.
But I am no expert on the car itself.  If you have any sort of exhaust
leak, extra oxygen is introduced into to the hot exhaust stream and
the surrounding cast manifold.  The leak will create a hot spot that
will dissipate through the manifold and cause it to glow.  I have
experienced it before on cars that I added turbo kits to, and were 
notoriouse for poorly designed exhaust plumbing that leaked.  
Even a small exhaust leak, that may barely be heard, may be causing
the abnormal manifold heat.  But then many race cars have this as
a normal condition.  Did Porsche design the car that way?
Perhaps someone with more knowledge of this model can set me straight?

Subject:      Oil press. guage solved!

Here's one to stash away in the file of weird electrical faults. I was
experiencing problems with an erratic oil pressure guage in the 931. Those of
you familiar with this machine will be familiar with the designer's penchant
for locating a ton of stuff in that virtually inaccessible spot under the
ignition coil and up against the firewall. Tucked away in that tiny spot we
find the warm up regulator, the heater control valve,... AND the sending unit
for the oil pressure guage/warning light! The terminals of the sending unit
were pressed into/hidden by the insulation on the firewall. Since the
insulation has a foil covering and constantly rubbed against the terminals for
the sending unit, it eventually grounded out causing the guage to flicker
BUT  ONLY DURING ACCELERATION INTO A LEFT TURN!! Even though I was well
convinced all the time that there was an electrical problem with the guage
it was a relief to remove all doubt about the possibility that the guage
might have been telling the truth and the repair was cheap!   :-)

Ken,

I saw this once...  Exactly as you described, in my '80 924 Turbo.  The
timing was too advanced, if I remember correctly.  Knowing about the
modifications that they did to your ignition system, I would suspect
something something like this.

Subject: Wierd clutch problem

'87 951

Yesterday morning, after letting the car sit for a day, I tried to start
the car and found that I was unable to select a gear with the engine
running.  Apparently my clutch fused to the pressure plate and flywheel.
After consulting with my mechanic, I put the car in reverse (with the
engine off) set the parking brake stepped on the brakes and started the
car a dozen times.  No luck. So I did the same thing but let the car
move 4 or 5 feet, then jumped on the brakes and stalled the engine.
After a few tries, it broke free. I now have my car back.

My mechanic opined that I might have been hot rodding the car, heating
up the clutch, and hit a puddle of water and shock cooled the clutch.
This doesn't make sense, though.  I drove the car home at my normal
(spirited, but no abuse of the clutch) pace; idled it in neutral while I
opened the garage door; and drove it into the garage -- no sign of any
problem with the clutch. A day later and it's fused tight.

I'm concerned that this may be an omen of immenent clutch failure -- I
have a track event coming up next weekend -- should I be worried? My
current theory is that the clutch is slipping and causing the clutch
disk to overheat.

Has anyone else ever had such an experience? What's the going rate for a
clutch job these days? The Haynes manual says that the exhaust system
and transmission must be removed... I seem to remember figures in the
$900 dollar range being batted about a few months ago: say it ain't
so...

My '89 951S, is in the shop for a similar intermittent problem.
The mechanic told me that the transimission spring broke and was caught
in between the pressure plate and fixed part (please pardon me, I'm
totally car mechanic ignorant), so the plate can not move away for my
clutch to go in.  He estimated 10 hours of labor, so that's $800, plus
parts.  However, he just called 10 minutes ago; he got Porsche to pay
for it although my car is out of the 2 year factory warranty.   This must be
a fairly common fairlure in 951's.  He also discovered that the engine
heat valve (again sorry if I'm not remember the term right), has some
prolem with leaking coolant onto the clutch.  Was this discussed not
so long ago?  That's a couple hundred dollars there.  Anyway, I'm happy
with the free fix, so I'm spending the money on 30K service (the car has
28000 on it).

Folks-
 
On Fri, 6 Mar 92 at 18:41:48, tynor@prism.gatech.edu (Steve Tynor)
writes (in part) on the subject of "Wierd clutch problem" ...
 
>>> Yesterday morning, after letting the car sit for a day, I tried to
start the car and found that I was unable to select a gear with the
engine running.  Apparently my clutch fused to the pressure plate and
flywheel....<<<
 
Actually, this isn't all that rare a happening; I've had it happen at
least once to every manual-transmission car I've had for any period of
time, except the Volvo.  It used to happen with one of my Sprites every
time it sat out overnight in high humidity (i.e. "condensing")
conditions.  Oddly enough, it almost never happened to my other three
Sprites.
 
It's always been attributed to "rust" but I'll be damned if I'm going
to oil my clutch to prevent it!
 
More importantly, I've never known it as a presage of clutch failure.
 
Usually, you can break it loose with the starter by putting the car in
top (not first) gear, setting the parking brake, pushing in the clutch
pedal, and twisting the key.  I put my "gas" foot on the real brakes,
too.
 
Naturally, if your car has a hydraulic clutch release mechanism, check
the fluid first ...
 
In particularly pernicious cases, you may have to drive the car around
the block in gear but with the clutch pedal pressed.
 
"How do I get it in gear?" 
 
Point it in an appropriate direction, and, with the engine off, put it
in first gear.  Then crank it up and let it drive itself away.  The
starter will move the car on level ground as well as start it.  Just
don't overdo it with the starter motor, as the bugger will get overly
hot and unhappy.  I usually warm up the car before doing the "start in
gear" drill.
 
I've never known the above methods to fail, but if the clutch absolutely
won't come loose you can still drive the car, you just have to crank it
in gear and be really careful about matching revs when changing gears.
 
Isn't a "951" a/k/a a "944 Turbo?"  If so, I've heard that the magic
number on a clutch job is $1,800, since you have to remove the exhaust
system, the rear axle/transaxle, and the torque tube before you can
remove the bellhousing to get to the clutch.  There was a pretty
humorous story about doing just that here on Porschephiles a few months
ago.
 
BTW, a friend of mine has opened a new garage here in Atlanta; he's not
a Porsche specialist, but he's a real craftsman.  Neil Estes is his
name, and his phone is 523-4847.  His shop is off Highland Ave, near
Inman Park.

Well, all of this sure sounds painfully familiar to me after spending
(with my friend Bert) a significant part of my Christmas holiday
replacing the clutch in my '86 951.  For about a week, I had been
experiencing an occasional "grind" during a shift, which I
optimistically attributed to sloppy pedal work (while at the same time
realizing that the frequency of these "misses" was far greater than
normal) and thought that moving the seat up might help.  It became
clear that something was wrong mechanically when, like Steve and
Violet, one evening I was unable to select any gear with the engine
running and the car stationary.  I hauled out the trusty jack stands,
and Bert and I went to work.

On the clutch disc, there are some big springs and some little springs
(I presume the "transmission springs" Violet's mechanic described).
One of the little springs had broken in two places, and a small piece
had lodged itself between two of the spokes in the pressure plate
spring.  The piece was jammed in there nice and tight, and I presume
was enough to keep the clutch from releasing.  It had probably been
bouncing around in there for while, occasionally sticking somewhere
and impeding the clutch release, resulting in the occassional missed
shifts.

Even though the pressure plate was probably reusable, we replaced
everything that moved in there (including the pilot bearing and the
bearings that the release fork rides on).  I do not want to do that
job again anytime soon, since it is very labor intensive, as has been
reported in many other postings.  Curiously, the parts I thought were
going to be hard (dropping the transaxle and moving the torque tube)
weren't that bad.  It was having to remove and replace a 10mm ground
strap bolt!  This bolt is on top of the clutch bell housing, and
grounds the DME harness and negative battery terminal.  I did not want
to make a mess by removing the heater valve, but it's position over
the bell housing (and the minimal slack in the rat's nest of cables,
hoses, etc. in that area) made it very difficult to deal with this
little bolt.  I would be interested to know how others have dealt with
that one.

As for the broken clutch disc, I was very annoyed at having had to
replace it because of a mechanical failure rather than normal wear.
There was still plenty of lining on it, and it should have lasted me
many more miles.  I do not believe that I am hard on the clutch, and
in fact I am pretty diligent about matching the engine speed to the
vehicle speed so that those damn little springs don't have to work so
hard.  I have been tempted to pack up the old disc and mail it off to
Fichtel & Sachs, but there would be no real way to prove that the disc
hadn't been used to practice Formula One or Pro Stock standing starts.

Here's another oddball occurrence: I once had the pilot bearing, which in this
case was a roller bearing, come apart and wedge the shafts together making the
clutch irrelevant. It was sufficiently jammed to make removal of the drive
shaft real tough too. Driving without a clutch gets really annoying in traffic
in a very short time.    ;-)

There simply can't be very many parts of the machine left that they didn't
try to jam into that spot. Try for example replacement of the heater hoses
going to the heater control valve. Yikes!

Never underestimate you're ability to get a manufacturer to stand behind
something that really shouldn't have broken. I once got a major equipment
company to not only pay for major engine work on a twelve year old machine,
but also to pick up the tab for 3 similar major repairs which I had already
paid for over the preceeding ten years or so. It really only took a few well
placed phone calls and good support from a dealer. It's always worth a shot.

This is a chronic problem in 944-series cars.  The heater valve was relocated
from the back of the engine to the front in the 944S and 944S2.  The rubber hose
running from the water pump to the heater pipe is replaced by two shorter hoses
and the valve spliced in there.  Two advantages:

  1. Leaks don't go into the clutch,
  2. They do go onto the oil filter, and the dried splotches are very visible,
     making problem determination very easy.

I am not 100% certain that the 944S hoses can be retrofitted to make the valve
fit here on eight-valve cars; only about 98% certain.  It is certainly worth a
try and I think it would be a very sensible update.  The valve itself is the
same (checked an '87 951 recently), and the hoses are not expensive.

I hear you.  I'm not familiar with broken/popped springs as a problem in 951
clutches.  There was a problem with rivet failures in the original clutch.  It
was addressed by bonding the friction material to the disk with some adhesive, I
believe, as well as riveting it.  I think the new part showed up around the time
of the Turbo S.

Plenty of people had this problem.  After fixing a bunch of autocrossers'
clutches, PCNA wised up and started looking for signs of what they feel is
abuse.  Specifically, they look for any bluing of the metal.  They started
refusing to cover such cases.  I know that a friend locally got turned down, as
did a writer for Excellence who published his disappointment!

There are a number of other tech bulletins related to 944-series clutches.  One
describes pictorially what to look for in rubber-centred clutch failures -
basically whether to hand the bill to the customer or not.  There were updates
to the clutch release bearing and to the pedal spring.  There is a more recent
bulletin which basically says that, hey, if you've worn away enough friction
material to start wearing the rivet heads, it's time to replace it.

I haven't myself heard cases of overnight freezing of the clutch.  I have heard
of this as a long-term 911, etc., storage disease.  The cure is as other folks
have described.  If this were to happen to me over night, I'd like to know why. 
Specifically, I'd try to figure out if there's not some coolant or whatnot
invading and corroding.

Finally, make sure the clutch bell is sealed and isn't missing any plugs.  There
is a large rubber plug in an inspection port on the bottom, which tends to fall
off anywhere except in your driveway.  After losing mine, I now secure it with a
smear of liquid silicone gasket.

RE: clutch sticking


I used to have the problem pretty regularly on a Jensen-Healey I owned, two
Porsches ago.  I usually was able to unstick it by putting it in second and
letting it roll down the driveway to build up speed and letting the clutch
out.

Once I had to back it up my slightly hilly street about half a block and then
do the rolling clutch dump.  Clutch was new and never seemed any worse for the
wear from this mild abuse.  

I have never had this problem on my 911 or late 914-6.

Stupid move of the week:

I cut a corner too close yesterday, and put my passenger-side rear wheel
into the curb. Now the rim (these are epsilon 3 piece 8.5" wheels) has
about a 2-3" spot where the outer rim is torn up (bent back). These wheels
were in perfect condition before, and now this :-(

Does anyone know of any way such a thing can be fixed? Is it just something
to live with and learn from?

Any ideas would be appreciated... Thanks in advance.

Subject: Broken clutch springs in 951's


Last May, I experienced exactly the same problem with my '89 951 as Milo did
with his '86.  Fortunately, the car was still under warranty (but only
three weeks away from expiration).  My clutch failed at the end of a trip
to Palo Alto, CA, so I had the car repaired at Carlsen Porsche-Audi in
Palo Alto.  The service representative admitted that clutch springs tend
to break in 951's.  I hope the problem doesn't recur.  Does anyone know
if Porsche has improved the design of the clutch disk?  Or is the disk
that Carlsen installed in my car exactly the same as the one that broke?

Just a quick questin -- My car is a '89 951.  I was told that it is the
equivalent of earlier 944 Turbo S.  Is it really true?  Does it have all
the improvements you mentioned above?  Thanks.

Subject: Re:  Wierd clutch problem

I've just completed replacing the clutch on my '86 Turbo (almost completed,
anyways) and have a few things to add to the discussion. The old clutch
was original (Sachs, dated 11/85) and did not have these little springs
at the center of the disk, as people are mentioning. Apparently these
springs were added later in the model year to reduce some harmonic
vibrations that were causing the gears to rattle in neutral. The
clutch was further modified for the 951S. Six of these little springs
were used instead of three.

I replaced the clutch on my car because it was very difficult to engage
first gear smoothly. The four large springs at the center of the disk
had become "hammered" and were loose. Compounding this was the "early-style"
throwout bearing which was too small in inside diameter (this was
discussed in a Porsche technical bulletin). The bearing was binding
on the shaft in the bellhousing. With the new clutch (but without
driving the car) the action is much smoother. One other thing to note
here is that the white paste lubricant mentioned in the factory manual
is no longer being used because it dries out and stops lubricating. All
points inside the bellhousing should use a Moly-type lubricant. Dealers
sell a little tube of this stuff for ~$13. I know you can get Moly grease
for much less but wasn't sure enough of myself to second guess it.

The new clutch I installed is a Sachs (OE-type), bought from PAR for $489
including pressure plate and bearing. Curiously, it does not have the
little inside springs, only the four large outer springs. There is only
one clutch for the 951 and 951S whether you buy it from Porsche or
from Sachs directly. I think the one from Porsche has the 6 little springs.
Can anyone confirm this?? My new Sachs clutch has a slightly different
part number than the original Sachs that I removed. The difference is in
the last digit. It's a bigger number. Hopefully that means they have
improved the life of the big springs. Everything else looks the same
as the old clutch. The new throwout bearing is the correct larger variety.
The wear on the old one was pretty severe. Doubt if it would have lasted
more than 50-60K miles total. The car has 37K miles. I'm the second owner.

As mentioned before, the job is labor intensive. But noone here has
explained the "extra" steps needed for the 1986 cars. In 1986 the
crossover pipe from the headers to wastegate to turbo was one piece.
This pipe needs to be removed to pull the bellhousing. In order to
remove this pipe you have to access the turbo. This requires removing
the intake manifold as well as the heat shield for the master cylinder.
Of course removing the intake manifold requires removing the fuel rail,
many vacuum connections, the distributor cap and wires ... You get the idea.

The difficult part of the job for me was the bellhousing bolts, the
crossover pipe bolts at the turbo end and the proctective tube for
the shift lever as it runs through the transmission. The manual says
press this tube in with a screwdriver and slide it out of the way.
The tube must be 1/8" thick and very stiff. After finally getting it
and destroying the tube I figured out that it wasn't necessary to do
this at all. Just be careful when you separate the transmission from
the torque tube and you should be all right.

The ground bolt at the top of the bellhousing was no problem for me
because I had to remove the intake manifold and everything else in the
way. The manual says to replace the bolt with a stud/nut. Not sure if
that would make it any easier the next time, though.

I also replaced the coolant hose at the back of the block that everyone
is talking about. This is the only hose I've ever seen that looked as
if it was ready to burst. I remember a service technician telling me last
summer to check this hose because many cars had had it fail. I now know
what he meant.

Good luck.

No they aren't. I didn't have any problems with the cheesehead bolts.
In fact I ended up reusing the old ones because the dealer had given
me the wrong set of new ones and it was the weekend I was assembling
everything. The manual doesn't say to replace them, but since the
dealer stocks the bolts it's probably safe to say they replace them.
The 9 new ones cost a total of about $5.

There are four bellhousing bolts that hold the bellhousing (covering
the clutch) to the engine. These are the only bolts that the manual
specifically says to put anti-seize lubricant on. The difficulty, though,
comes in getting a good u-joint socket wrench on them.  Anyone know
if there is something better than the Craftsman-type? Something that
acts more like a constant velocity joint and doesn't twist sideways
all the time?

Being hyrdophobic (I avoid water-cooled cars every chance I get) I don't
know that this is absolutely true, but it makes sense: Autothority is
*supposed* to have a kit that lets you use a late 911 clutch on 944/951s.

It's supposed to the be hot trick part for performance driving, as it's
much lighter and has stronger parts. It's also -- including the clutch
and pressure plate -- supposed to be several hundred $$ cheaper than 
regular 944/51 stuff. Or so sez a friend who's running a 944 as an ITA
racer.

Snap-On sells a flexible driver, p/n FX62A in the 3/8" size.  Its shaft is a

Violet -

Yes, you've got it all.  The car was called a 944 Turbo S in MY 88, and was
technically an option package on the 944 Turbo (often referred to by its factory
project number: 951).  In MY 89, the "package" became standard on the 944 Turbo,
and so there was really no 944 Turbo S.

Mark, I suspect that the reason no one has mentioned this extra step is
the fact that many of us '86 owners had the one piece crossover
replaced at the same time the (crack prone) original exhaust manifolds
were replaced with the bellows-equipped version.  I have no idea what
it would cost, but you might consider this upgrade (perhaps with
recycled parts) in case you ever have to do that job again.  I am sure
it was a royal pain to have to deal with the intake manifold, etc.,
and I'm really glad I didn't have to deal with that extra hassle.

At least your cloud (having to remove all the top end stuff) had a
silver lining!  I saw the manual recommendation to replace the bolt
with a stud, but I ignored it since I could not see how that would
help much.  You still have to get the two ground wires on the stud and
thread a nut on it.  The real solution would have been to relocate the
connection to someplace you can actually reach without removing a lot
of stuff.

I didn't have any problem with mine either.  They were in perfectly
good shape after removal, so I had no reservations about reusing them.

The guys I bought my clutch package from (Automechanika) seemed to
think that my 951 clutch was the same one as used on a 930 (perhaps
with a different number).

I've been trying to do just for the last month or so. After talking with
PCNA Customer Relations I wrote a letter asking them to replace the
crossover peice. The reasoning I used was that almost every other car
with the manifold replacement has had the crossover piece replaced.
Mine didn't. They seemed optimistic over the phone. They're supposed
to get back to me this week. Apparently there are several other claims
in addition to mine.

Guess how much a new one costs. ~$1000 the last I checked. Yes, that's
three zeros! Neither PAR nor Aase Bros. has a used one or were even
encouraging about finding one. Past dealings with Kempton Bros. will
keep me from calling them. If PCNA falls through, I'll try one of our
local shops that seems to have a good supply of parts. Otherwise I guess
I'll have all that much more to look forward to in my next clutch job.

I also have done a clutch job on my '86 944 Turbo.  I was and still consider
myself to be a lousy and lazy mechanic.  So when I was faced with the problem
of the one piece crossover pipe, I just didn't remove it.  I'm not saying it
was easy to remove the bellhousing and I don't remember the details (this was
done in 1988) but I did replace the clutch, flywheel, and release bearing
without removing the pipe.  So when you get to this point during disassembly,
give it a try.

Subject: Crossover on CLutch Replacement

As may or may not be obvious or even already said, the crossover pipe
was part of the 86 factory "free replacement" of the exhaust manifold,
turbocharger and wastegate plumbing.  The original assy did not have the
three-nut coupling to the wastegate pipe and made it nearly impossible
to replace the clutch without removing the crossover (8 hours right
there at least).

The clutch is still a bitch, but the worst part IMHO is sliding back the
torque tube far enough to get the bellhousing off.

Tricks:  Buy a set of craftsman flex sockets and use the 19 (I think) to
remove ALL the bellhousing bolds from below, with the aide of a 2'
extension and a long flex-handled ratchet.

Fun fun fun!

How do the Solo's compare to the Escort and Passport?  I am seriously 
considering the purchase of a Solo from Damark or Cinn. Microwave (I think
I saw some ad's for ~$250 US for the Solo from CM).  Is the full size 
Escort better than the Solo (i.e. - is it worth the extra size, money, 
etc.)?  How does the Passport compare?  I has been a while since I have 
seen a test report on these different radar detectors.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

I need advice on how to install the axle-stub/CV-joint assembly on my
'74 914 2.0:

I figure I can either
  
  * First assemble the CV joint (and driveshaft) to the axle stub,
    driving in the spiral pins and bolting the joint together, and
    second try to drive the whole assembly into the wheel hub
    (What do I hammer on?  Certainly not the other end of the 
    driveshaft!)

or
  * First drive the axle stub into the wheel hub, and second try to
    assemble the CV joint to the hub, trying to work in the cramped
    space of the trailing arm...

I'm not convinced I can do it either way, but I haven't thought of any
alternatives.  Has anyone done this?  Can you offer any helpful hints?

The engine & transmission are out of the car, so I do have some
working room.

Thanks,

Do it the second way. Get the stub axel into the trailing arm first (you
may need to replace the bearings -- this should be checked!). Then get the
engine into the car. Then bolt up the CVs and half shafts.

As Stan says, getting the trailing arm all put together (stub axle/spindle) and
then fastening in the CV's-on-the-half-shaft is the right way to do it.  You
definitely do not want to be whacking the half-shaft/CV assembly as part of
getting things back together.

In fact, with a lot of cars you have to be pretty careful not to let a shaft,
disconnected at one end, droop too far, twisting the CV joint at the
still-fastened end.  I forget the exact reason, but I think it has to do with
the fact that doing so may cause the CV to separate.

Subject: Feedback on '68 912 wanted
Reply-To: montanaro%crd@crdgw1.GE.COM (Skip Montanaro)


I saw a '68 912 for sale this morning and am looking for a little feedback
on it. I've been out of the Porsche circle for about five years and haven't
kept in touch with the market at all.

The car looks mostly original. There is some rust bubbling through the body
in places, but nothing too serious. In most places the paint appears
original (it's the factory orange - not as garish as the gearheads like),
although other places have a little overspray reminiscent of some
not-so-good touch-up. The floor under/near the rocker panels on both sides
needs replacing. I haven't gotten it up on a rack yet to see how much other
rust there is. As I recall, the front pan on early the 911/912 cars had a
bad reputation for rusting out.  The battery box looked pretty solid, though.

The engine was rebuilt not long ago and is dry as a bone. The flap boxes
look a bit cheesy and have been painted a hideous silver color, as has the
muffler. From my days as a 356 hack, that certainly seems non-original. The
engine seems to idle a bit roughly, but that may be because the Zeniths were
replaced by Webers and still need some sorting out. The original pistons,
cylinders and Zenith setup come with the car. The (5-speed) transmission
linkage seems a little mysterious. When in neutral, the car tended to still
engage when the clutch was released.

The car has Fuchs wheels and thinnish Goodyear GT 185/70HR-14 tires,
definitely not original equipment.

The interior is in excellent shape. The front dash panel appears to have
been reupholstered, but the dash top is still intact. There is no vinyl rot
around the speaker grille. Although not installed, the original AM/FM/SW
radio comes with the car. The only apparent problem with the interior seemed
to be some deterioration in the wood floorboards.

The owner is not a Porsche person. Actually, he's heavily into a beautiful
'65 Vette roadster, so he is serious about nice cars. He got the Porsche in
a swap with a car dealer friend for a '56 Chevy. Definitely a more
marketable car in the Schenectady, NY area. He's asking $6500 for the car.

I plan to get it to my mechanic this week. I haven't driven it yet, because
it's not registered, but should be able to scrounge some dealer plates for
the trip to the shop.

I'd appreciate any feedback or advice people might be able to give me about
the car. I'm especially curious about the transmission symptoms. My one and
only 911 had a good transmission, so I've no experience with the problems I
described above.

Thanks,

Subject: 912 for sale

The posting about the 912 made me remember that a racing partner of
mine has a '68 912 for sale. It's mostly original, modulo that fact
that it's set up for autox and has a *ghastly* solid rubber fake
Turbo Carrera tail on it...

He's a professional mechanic, who's been building Porsche race stuff
for oh, about 20 years. He built this to be his car, and then went off
and got Racing Fever in a big way. The resulting $$ drain is causing him
to sell the car. It's the standard orange color with black leather 
interior in case anyone cares about that...

He wants $5000 for it, and has said he'll take less if it's going to
a good home. Note that this does not mean he'll give it way. Shoot me
a note if you want more details and/or his phone number.

Cc: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

Terry,

I have no hard data about how the Solo compares to the Passport and
Escort models from the performance standpoint, but my impression is
that you don't give up much, if anything, for the battery-powered
feature of the Solo (which is what sold me, along with CM's
reputation).  Nevertheless, even if the Escort or Passport models do
have some performance advantage, it would probably be wasted on me
since my Solo has always given me plenty of warning.  In my area, the
threat is hand-held K-band radar guns, which my Solo picks up very
well.  I have never encountered X-band police radar here in northern
CA.  In fact, I wish I could disable the X-band detection on my Solo,
since the only thing it detects is automatic door openers and alarm
systems.

  It's ok to let the driveshaft droop, but don't apply any extra pressure on 
it or you will bend the flange between the CV joint and the boot out of shape.
This leads to the flange biting into the inside of the boot, leading to a
premature crack in the boot.  Just a couple of weekends ago I had to reform
a flange on my car where the boot was busted and it looked like the driveshaft
had been "over-drooped" in 3 or 4 placed...bet my neighbors were wondering what
I was doing to my driveshaft with a hammer.

Subject: Oil Change

Hi,
	My 79 911SC is coming out of winter storage in a couple of
weeks. For the first time, I am planning to change the oil myself
and also use Mobil 1 15W-50 (previously used Castrol XLR 20W-50).
My question is that do I add all of the 11L of oil to the tank and then
start the motor or do I have to add say 5L and then start the motor and then
add the rest? Since the oil is drained from the motor and the oil tank,
how is the oil transfered from the oil tank to the motor when the new oil
is added?

Thanks for your response.

****************************************************************************

I usually put in 10 qts then start the engine.

A 911 has two oil pumps.  First is a high volume, low pressure scavange
pump the moves oil from the crankcase to the oil tank.  I believe that the 
oil goes to the cooler before getting to the tank.  Second is a low 
volume high pressure pump the sends the cooled oil to the engine for 
lubrication.

Since the new oil is added to the tank, it just goes to the engine in the 
normal fashion.

Regarding your switch to Mobil 1, I beleive that a 911 holds about 13 
quarts (I'll check my spec book if you are interested).  I consistantly
add 11 qts when I do an oil change.  This means (to me) that there are still
2 qts left in the oil system, which does go all the way to the front right
fender and back.

Is it okay to mix the Mobil 1 with the non-synthetic?

I've been using Kendall (10-40) since I can get it locally for $1.59/qt.
I change it about every 3500 miles.

Subject: 71 911 Questions (What are those factory swear words?)


Hello-

I have a couple of quick questions...

Last weekend my brother and I set out to replace the trailing arms on
his 71 911.  It took us lots longer than expected (we only got one side
done).  Later that evening, we heard that on the pre '73 models you
need to drop transmission/engine  Is there some handy trick/secret
factory-porsche swear word/(insert here) that would let you do this
without droping the eingine?

Also since this car (body) was originally purchaed on a pallet we knew
that it was not a pristine always in the garage and never dirven in the
rain  kind of car  :-)  We recently noticed that the rear hubs do not
seem to be the same distance from the center line of the car.  Further
inspection reveals that some bozon had welded in a new torsion tube
(and did it off center!)

By now you can see that I don't need the answer to the first question
because last night we dropped the engine just enough to ge access to
the tube.  We are going to cut the tube out and figure out some way to
align things up, and weld it back in.  gawd I love welding under a car
on jack stands :-)

Once we get it put back together what would be a good way to measure
the suspension geometry?  Can we sort of copy my 77 911?  We started
getting into this project because he is going to paint the car.  We
started by puting on factory steel *turbo* flairs because the
fiberglass ones were really ugly.  We also removed a very thick layer
of bondo that seemed to completely cover the car.  He wanted to avoid
droping the engine because that would open up the possibility of
painting a different color (it black now).  I think if he goes with a
new color, orange or baby blue, he was thinking red or teal.

Sorry about rambln' on, but any relevant info would be appreciated.

Subject: 71 911 Questions (What are those factory swear words?)

It's been a while...

   Last weekend my brother and I set out to replace the trailing arms on
   his 71 911.  It took us lots longer than expected (we only got one side
   done).  Later that evening, we heard that on the pre '73 models you
   need to drop transmission/engine  Is there some handy trick/secret
   factory-porsche swear word/(insert here) that would let you do this
   without droping the eingine?

You just need to drop the transmission end enough that you can get the
bolt out (ie not the engine end, too)  You are only supposed to be
able to remove this bolt with the tranny lowered so that in case the
nut comes off the bolt wont fall out and you lose a trailing arm while
driving. 

   Once we get it put back together what would be a good way to measure
   the suspension geometry?  Can we sort of copy my 77 911? 

You can't copy the 77, the geometries are different.  There is a
procedure in the 911 performance handbook for measuring the geometry,
which as I recall involves measuring the diagonal distances from each
end of the tube to points on the opposite side of the car.  Rather
than give numbers, all the matching measurements should be the same.
remember that 911 were hand-built, and as a result the geometries on
all 911s were slightly asymetric, so don't go for perfection.

Hi.  I have the engine from my '74 914 2.0 out and (largely at Stan
Hanks' suggestion) am replacing all the rubber bits I can think of.  I
went to a VW shop and bought most of the stuff, including fuel line for
the fuel ring (the hose that hops from injector to injector).  The hose
they sold me is rubber with a cloth cover, but the hose on the car is
rubber with no cloth.  I've heard mixed opinions on the wisdom of
cloth-covered hose for this.  What say y'all?

Also, here's the list of engine stuff I'm replacing.  Anyone notice
anything important that I and Stan have forgotten?

  * oil cooler seals
  * injector rings (all 8)
  * intake manifold gaskets (are there 2 or 4 ?)
  * oil pressure switch
  * fuel ring hose
  * short hoses from intake manifold pipes to air distributor (4)
  * muffler-to-heat-exchanger gaskets (2)
  * engine-to-heat-exchanger rings (4)
  * most of the little screws that hold things like the engine
    sheetmetal on (I didn't realize I could get those cheaply!)
  * alternator belt

Subject: Re:  Cloth-Covered Fuel Line?

I believe the cloth-covered fuel line is the original stuff on the 914.  My
suggestion is to actually cut off the metal fittings from the end of all the
injectors where the fuel lines come in and replace them with hose clamps.  If
all your fuel lines are rubber, it sounds like someone already did that for
you.  The first place leaks start is at the sharp bend in the fuel line right
after the fitting...

Be careful with the rubber stuff to allow enough slack in the line for bends.
I remember having a bend clamp off the fuel supply to half of the engine on my
old 914 with 40IDF webers after going home from the mechanic and getting the
engine warm.  I don't know if this is a problem with the cloth lines.

I am not familiar with Castrol XLR.  Is it a synthetic oil?  If not and your
engine has high mileage, I would think twice about switching to a synthetic
oil.  I seem to remember previous postings (or articles in rec.autos.tech)
about switching to synthetic oil in high mileage autos.  Others will probably
have to help me out with the details, but I believe the problem is related
to various seals in your engine.  The nature oil causes the seals to expand
and seat properly.  When you switch to a synthetic oil, the synthetic oil is
not soaked up by the seals in the same manner.  Thus the seals will loosen 
some, and in older engine, this can cause problems.  I am not sure what happens
on newer engines.

I have included an article from the BMW mailing list as a reference.  The
author mixed in a quart of Teflon oil and started having problems (maybe his
problem was related to mixing the oil, I do not know).  I am not positive 
that Teflon is a synthetic oil, but that was my initial impression.  I hope 
this is helpful.

______________________________________________________________________________

I've finally got my 911T 2.4 Coupe past the Swiss vehicle test, can you believe
they failed it because it was sitting too low! Putting on some borrowed winter
tyres solved that :-) :-)

Anyway, I can finally drive the car on the road, for the first time really, and
maybe I have a problem. One of the few modifications to the car (that I know
about anyway) is an ANSA exhaust, basically a free flow exhaust with four outlet
pipes, and when I drive along, unless i`m using a reasonably hard throttle
(speeding ticket here I come!), I get a popping/farting noise fairly frequently
(at random). 

The Porsche garage insist that it's due to the exhaust - lack of back pressure
to the engine etc. What I want to know is if this is detrimental to my engine in
any way?? I will certainly replace it at some point, but hopefully not
immediately. The engine has passed an emissions test and has generally been
checked over with electrical analysis equipment, and is in goodish condition.

Incidentally, it doesn't half go. I can't believe it only has 140 PS, seems more
like around 170. It pulls like a train from around 3000 in 5th gear. I have
driven 944S2 and 3.0SC and this certainly seems quicker than the SC, the 944S2
was a totally different feeling - much quieter and less effort so it's difficult
to judge accurately. Bloody noisy though (ANSA exhaust doesn't help that!) but
together with engine noise/transmission wind, well - it's different to the BMW!!

Thanks

Kevin,

If your 2.4T has been converted to Webers, you may have junk in your idle
circuits.  At steady highway speeds below say 80, you are still on the idle
circuits.  I had this problem when I had my 914/6, and the carbs had to 
be disassembled and cleaned.

I could also be that the idle jets are too small.


BTW, everything I have read seems to suggest that you would be better off
with the Porsche sport muffler.  some of the aftermarket exhausts actually 
have less power than a stock system.

I have an '84 Porsche 944 with 50K miles which occasionally has a starting 
problem. It tends to occur on especially cold days, even with the car in the 
garage. The engine will crank over, but never start. I CAN get it started 100%
of the time when this problem occurs by using a hair dryer to heat up the area
behind the engine just in front of the middle of the firewall!! This is the
area in which the flywheel reluctor is located. What I think is happening is
that the reluctor may have an an intermittent open in its winding, which
becomes solid when the engine gets very cold. When I use the hair dryer for
about 30 seconds, the temperature increase apparently closes this open,
allowing the engine control module to see its timing pulses, and therefore
starting the car. Is there any way to verify this theory with test equipment
before I spend the $200 on this reluctor part (what a rip-off!!) which of
course is non-returnable? Of course, I could be out in left field with this 
theory. And yes, I know a 12VDC hair dryer is a lot cheaper, especially since 
the problem only occurs maybe half a dozen times a year, but I'm considering
selling the car to a friend and don't want him to get stuck with the problem.

The shop manual shows a test of the pulse generators on the flywheel which
uses an ignition analyzer. For those of us who don't own commercial
shops, it is possible to examine the output of the sensors with a general
purpose oscilloscope, if that is any easier for you to find than an
ignition analyzer. The waveform will look slightly different than the
picture in the book, since (I believe) the ignition analyzers are not
DC coupled, but the pulse magnitudes should be similar. On my 1987 944S, 
the pulse amplitudes were much larger than those in the book. Although
it is somewhat hard to find in the shop manual, the values shown are
for the engine cranking prior to starting, which should be just right
for tracing your problem.

If you don't have access to a shop manual but you can get an oscilloscope
and you want to try this test, I can look up the specs for you in my
manual at home.

But seriously, there are two sensors in that area above the bellhousing.
One is to mark the TDC, the other senses RPMs.

Take the car to a dealer with the proper diagnosis equipment.  Easter-

considering the "no-return policy" on electronic parts...

Subject:      Canadian Prices

Just one more horror story about Canadian dealers trying to rip us off:
I needed injector seats for my 931.   That's the little plastic bushing
that screws into the head and into which the injector nozzle is pressed.
I called Downtown Fine Cars in Toronto and found that if I would FAX
them all of the credit card info, they would ship the parts at $32 (Canadian)
per seat.   The same part for an Audi 5000, which is different only on the
inside, ie. it has a hexagon shape rather than splined inside but otherwise
identical, costs less than $2. The parts man said he would have to order
them for me. I responded by saying that I wasn't surprised that he didn't
stock them without a vault and armed guard.
Anyhow, I called Syracuse New York and they agreed to ship them for less
than $10 each and I wouldn't have to go to the expense of Faxing them and
jerking around. EVEN if I have to pay import duty and taxes, that's a
ridiculous price differential. The moral of the story is, don't ever
even think about having your car fixed on this side of the border without
double checking the price of each and every item. The parts man doesn't
care about my ranting and raving over this one of course. He just works
there.  How do we get through to these thieves??  If you ever pass by
Downtown Fine Cars during business hours, stop by and tell them why they
don't deserve any business.   (My revenge   :-)   )

Subject: CIS injection


 I was wondering if anyone understands how the bosch fuel injection
works on a 80 911SC?

I have a limited knowledge of the system and was
wondering if someone could expand on it. I know it is a 
continuous injection system. I think it works like this;
the injectors atomize the fuel in the intake track behind the
intake valve. The plate attached to the fuel distributor measures
the volume of air and distributes the correct amount of fuel
for the correct mixture. The 02 sensor reads the 02 content in
the exhaust and fine tunes the mixture in a close loop system,
of course thats after the sensor warms up. The warm up regulator
richens up the mixture when the engine is cold.

Besides what is obvious from the description what do these parts do?

    fuel pressure accumulater
    Allen screw on the fuel distributor, CO mixture?
    control pressure regulator
    auxiliary air device.

Also, any recommendations on books about the CIS system.

Thanks

While we're on the topic, perhaps someone could give a rundown of the

There are three books I would recommend:

  Charles O. Probst, "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management," pub. Robt.
   Bentley, available from just about all the mail order places or from
   Bentley, about $28.

    Terrific survey of Bosch electronic FI systems, not marque- or model-
    specific; but the cover's claim that it "includes high performance
    tuning" is BS.  Covers both theory and troubleshooting of CIS and
    pulsed systems.

  Bosch, "Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems, pub. SAE, available from
   them at 412 776 4970, about $32.

    Very good theory, no troubleshooting, no marque- or model-specific
    info.  Dry, often repetitive.  Printed on heavy, high-gloss bond and
    ideal for winging at misbehaving cats.

  Volkswagen GTI, Golf, Jetta Service Manual, 1985..1990 incl 16V.  Available
   from Bentley, your VW dealer, mail order, maybe about $40?

    I could probably recommend their Audi or BMW manuals for the same reasons,
    but have never seen them.  In as much as Bosch underpins all the car's
    engines, the manuals are reasonable sources of generic theory and terrific
    sources of troubleshooting info.  Lots of great novice tips, like how
    to build a test lamp from an LED and a resistor, what tools you'll need,
    how to check and test the FI system.

Giant capacitor for fuel. Prevents those nasty "voltage spikes". Also
allows you to have enough pressure to start the car, cold. Saved from
the last time you drove it, natch.

Basic ratio of air to fuel.

You increase fuel flow to cylinders by increasing pressure. This device
uses engine vacuum to decide that you're accelerating and give more
gas *before* there's enogh airflow to justify it. BTW, the hot trick for
boosting performance on CIS cars is to replace that with a "rising rate"
regulator, which gives even more gas.

Adds extra air in conditions of low vacuum (ok, ok "manifold pressure" --
gimme a break already...) I forget why. They fail with more frequency
than other parts. May be a Bosch revenue generating trick....

I have some tech notes from HALTECH somewhere that might be useful too,
but will have to find them. And I hear there is a similar series from
Electromotive too (their system is much better than HALTECH -- how did
I *EVER* decide that HALTECH was a good idea... oh well,that's another
story....)

It's for emissions.  Leans out the exhaust so the cat will last the
requisite 50K miles.   

   > Also, any recommendations on books about the CIS system.

There's also a book from Bosch on the K-Jetronic.  I'm pretty sure
performance products sells it.  Something like "Bosch Technical
Instructions for the K-Jetronic".  Its mainly for maintenance, doesn't
do that much explaining the way Probst does.

Subject: Starting Problem

Hi,
	I have a 79 911SC with the CIS injection without oxygen
sensor. I am experiencing a starting problem when the engine is cold.
It happens like this: crank the motor for the first time, it catches
for about 1 second and then it stalls. When I restart the motor, it
starts fine and idles properly. The car has 90,000 km and a new warm-up
regulator. Also, if I start the car for the first time and immediately give
throttle, there is a backfire (intake, I think) and the engine idles
eratically for a few seconds. Could it be the thremoswitch or the cold
start valve?

Any comments would be appreciated.

If you're refering to a Lambda system, closed loop with O2 sensor and
frequency valve, then the allen screw adusts the basic idle mixture to
get it within a range that the Lambda  can fine tune.

Depending on the particular CIS system this may or may not be true, I
doubt this is the case for the 1980 SC in question.  On non-turbo CIS
systems of this vintage the normal case would be that the control pressure
regulator bleeds off control pressure at startup to provide enrichment,
thereafter the regulator pinches off this bleed-off flow until it shuts 
off entirely at full warmup.  Once the car is warmed up the control
pressure regulator is a closed valve.

In turbo applications (circa 1980) the control pressure regulator does 
sense manifold pressure and does decrease control pressure as manifold 
pressure increases.  In this case it is a true control pressure regulator
as a function of manifold pressure as opposed to a warmup control pressure
regulator that drops out of the picture once the thing warms up and shuts
off.

If you mean "auxilliary air regulator" this is a thermally controlled air
valve that bypasses the throttle butterfly during warmup, no different
in effect than stepping on the throttle a little during warmup to keep
it from stalling.  Here again, once the system is warmed up this component
acts as a closed valve.  Both this and the control pressure regulator
are ultimately controlled by bimetalic strips that are resistivly heated
and close off the valves after five minutes or so.  The initial temperature
of these valves determines how far open they are at startup, but they will
close.  

If you mean air injection system, it's a normal air pump to add air to
the exhaust gasses to promote complete burning  in the exhaust.

Not mentioned yet is the frequency valve, which is a valve that controls 
the fuel pressure to the injectors my supplying varying amounts of pressure
to a diaphram pressure regulator, as with the screw on your oxyacetylene
regulators.  They call it a frequency valve because it is either on or
off at a certain frequency, the duty cycle being dermined by the feedback
from the O2 sensor to the ECU.

Yo!  We're still here. But I think the NET is haunted. Gary Cook and I both
own 931's and we regularly exchange horror stories. His car popped the main
fuel pump a few days ago. I think my car had never previously thought up
such a failure. I had to walk home from the video store last night. :-(
You guessed it. No fuel pump activity. I have been hearing some VERY unusual
sounds emanating from that notorious area up by the firewall which sem related
to the fuel problem. Anyway, to make a long story short, I expect it is either
the fuel pump itself or the relay. Gary tells me he fixed the relay problem
by spending the $75 to just carry one along in the glove box. No need to
install it. Just carry it along and that's enough to keep the car happy. ;-)
I'm almost afraid to post to the NET for fear that my 931 is listening in
for ideas on new failures. ;-)  Sounds like the Twilight Zone theme music
should fade in here somewhere.
