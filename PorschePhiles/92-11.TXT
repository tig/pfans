Subject: Lime Rock (repaved!)


  Since I was at Lime Rock Park last Friday and Saturday I thought
I'd give you a short description of the "new" track.

  All the bumps are now gone, making the ride very VERY smooth. Unfortunately
the repavers could not avoid a small number of new bumps, but what can
one do.

  The new asphalt was slippery, especially since it rained Thursday night.
Another effect of the new pavement was increased noise from the tires.
There wasn't much rubber on the track, but rest assured this will be
improved with time. It seems that the track officials are very worried
about the condition of the track and were thinking of banning slick
tires if necessary (this was a PCA driver's ed event). As a matter of
fact, someone went out on the track to check for possible damage to
the asphalt... The people with the high horsepower cars were also asked
not to try their best :-)

  All reference points are now gone, most important being the concrete
patch on the lefthander and the groove on the downhill. It is now
easier to drop a wheel on the inside of the downhill, but there
are no more bumps, so one can carry more speed through it. There is
now a significant drop all around the track, as high as five inches
at the exit of the west bend.

  The bottom line is that LR is a lot better than it was. Enjoy it!

November 1992

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

The new host, TTA.COM, is running well and seems to be keeping up with
the load from this mailing list. Let's see how well it keeps up with the
FTP traffic... That's right, the archives will be available via anonymous
FTP just before Thanksgiving. I'll post an announcement when they're up.

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA. 
And I put some of the articles on-line in /pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star.
If you edit a newsletter or would like to just type in articles from your
newsletter, let me know and I'll creat an area for you to upload your
articles too. 

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 860792
Fax	    +44 451 860011

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes) at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: Archives available by FTP

Well, I got industrious: the archives since July are now up for FTP
on TTA.COM. 

PLEASE be sensitive to the fact that we're on a 56k link that is used
for business purposes as well, and limit your transfers to after 6:00 PM
CST during the week, or anytime on the weekend.

The files are in /pub/porschephiles/<year>-<month>.Z

If you can't FTP, I'll have a mail server up soon.

This sounds like a problem I've seen on my '74 1.8: the connector on
the brain is loose, and when you hit bumps, or shift (if you also have
bad motor mounts) it bounces loose. Try pressing it on harder, and
if that works, you've found your problem.

   I dunno, is it just a rolling junker, or is it worth salvaging?

	      --Dave Darling

The fact that the body flexes like that indicates major problems.
Take off the outer rockers and also check the lower firwall from
underneath, where the clutch cable goes into the body.  Most
likely these areas are badly rusted.  Also the whole passenger
side suspension console usually is rusted from battery acid.

I think they're all worth saving but it is a big job.

If the fuel pump or its connection was bad, you most likely would not notice
the dropout immediately when the bump was hit or turn was made, since the
pressure already in the system will keep the fuel flowing for a while.  I've
pulled the fuel pump relay and the car doesn't die immediately.  It takes
a couple of seconds to sputter, provided you're not on the gas.

I would begin checking with the normal ignition and other electronic
connectors first.

David, here's a little more info for you:

The Porsche 924S (don't know about the 'E' designation) is a very
special car.  Not only does it have trick threaded front struts, is also
has higher spring rates in the front coils, a MUCH larger rear (read
turbo size) torsion bar, as well as LARGE (again read very BIG) rear
anti-sway bar- all from the factory.  This car handles better that many
944's with bigger tires/wheels, especially since it weights some 75-80
pounds less than a 944.  Also, the rim widths, again from the factory,
were 6x15's in the front and 7x15's in the rear (special offsets for this
model- not the 911 offset!)  Add all this up and, believe me, its a real
potent package.  I estimate that if Frank Wong gets more seat time
next year (he's a friend and business was way to busy in '92), he will
be chasing Jeff in his 914 much closer that in the past! Also, I know
a driver that ahs really prepared his 924S and should do very well in '93.

These options are documented in many Porsche factory manuals, if
you have the time & patience to get all the documentation together.
Also, this option was only available on the '88 model, not the '87.

Anyway, this is a really neat car and has GREAT future potiential!

Good 'ay,

Mr Wizard

                     1993 Porsche 911

Porsche's benchmark 911 model has been in continuous production 
since the end of 1964. From that time through the present day, 
the Porsche 911 has been the classic 2+2 sports car. It is the 
production-based car that forged much of Porsche's racing 
heritage, a heritage which continues to this day.

Since those early cars, the overall appearance and the basic 
concept of the 911 have remained, but almost every component has 
been changed, improved, and evolved. As a result, nearly three 
decades after the shape was first seen by the public, the 911 is 
still considered a leader in sports car performance.

The 911 series underwent a major redesign for the 1989 model 
year, when the all-wheel-drive Porsche 911 Carrera 4 was 
introduced on a completely re-engineered platform. The present 
platform first appeared in experimental form in 1984, and served 
as the basis for the Porsche 959.

For the 1993 model year, the 911 is available in four distinct 
variations:

   -- 911 Carrera 2
   -- 911 Carrera 4
   -- 911 America Roadster
   -- 911 RS America

The 911 Carrera 2 forms the basis of Porsche's line of rear-
engined sports cars, and offers high performance in a variety of 
body styles and with manual or automatic transmissions. The 911 
Carrera 4 offers drivers the added attraction of surefooted all-
wheel-drive. The 911 America Roadster provides a unique Cabriolet 
body style reminiscent of the 911 Turbo, with a fully power-
operated convertible top and an extensive choice of luxury and 
convenience options. The 911 RS America makes available a lower 
priced 911 with the emphasis on performance and handling through 
its pure sport suspension, lighter weight, and limited option 
selection.

The Carrera 2 and 4 are available as Coupe, Cabriolet and Targa. 
The RS America is only available as a Coupe, and the America 
Roadster only as a Cabriolet. Porsche's unique Tiptronic 
transmission is optional on the Carrera 2 and America Roadster.

The 1993 911 model line benefits from several evolutionary 
changes:

   -- CFC-free air conditioning
   -- recycling labels for plastic containers
   -- new brake fluid with greater resistance to fading
   -- modified stereo speaker system


PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 2

The 911 Carrera 2 is the time-honored Porsche, a true 2+2, 
powered by an air-cooled, rear-mounted boxer engine, driving the 
rear wheels. This is the classic Porsche concept, proven on open 
roads and race tracks the world over beginning with the first 
Porsche 356 of 1948. Compared to many conventional front engine 
sports cars, the rear engine/rear drive format of the Carrera 2 
provides enhanced acceleration performance thanks to the addition 
of the powertrain weight on the drive wheels. The mechanical 
layout of the Carrera 2 offers enthusiasts the renowned Porsche 
handling, refined over more than four decades of building rear-
engined, rear-drive high performance cars.

The present Carrera 2 was introduced in October 1989 as a 1990 
model. Porsche's unique, optional Tiptronic automatic 
transmission was first applied to the 1990 Carrera 2. The 
quintessential rear engine, rear-drive, normally aspirated 
Porsche Carrera 2 is arguably the best-loved Porsche of all time. 
In 1992, it was voted best sports car by the readers of the 
prestigious German magazine "Auto, Motor und Sport" for the 
fifteenth consecutive year. The 911 Carrera 2 represents the core 
of Porsche's sports car concept, upon which the other models of 
the 911 family are based.

PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 4

The 911 Carrera 4 is Porsche's high performance all-wheel-drive 
(AWD) sports car. The Carrera 4 was introduced in early 1989, a 
year before the Carrera 2, and embodies much of the AWD 
technology developed for Porsche's ultra-exotic, limited-
production 959.

Porsche showed an AWD 911 Turbo Cabriolet concept at the 1981 
Frankfurt auto show. This show car led directly to an AWD racer 
based on the 911 body shell, and to the legendary 959, first 
shown in 1983. The AWD technology was made available on the 
Carrera 4 in early 1989.

The Porsche 911 Carrera 4 uses a sophisticated electro-
hydraulically controlled drive system. The engine output is 
distributed between the front and rear axles by a center 
differential. The torque split, nominally fixed at 31 percent for 
the front axle, 69 percent for the rear axle, preserves much of 
the traditional rear-drive sports car feel that is a Porsche 
hallmark. The center and rear differentials incorporate 
electronically controlled multi-plate clutches to manage the 
engine power flow to the tires. The electronic control unit 
modulates hydraulic valves to lock the differentials, thereby 
diverting engine power to the tires with the most grip. The 
driver never notices the system at work, only that the Carrera 4 
has incredible grip under all conditions. For extreme situations, 
such as starting up on glare ice or climbing steep snow-covered 
driveways, the driver can temporarily lock both differentials by 
means of a switch on the center console to gain added traction.

AWD offers superior traction under all conditions. Even on dry 
pavement, AWD offers benefits in a high-powered sports car. 
Strictly speaking, the acceleration of a car is limited by how 
much force can be transmitted by the tires--the traction of the 
tires. If one attempts to put more force through the area with 
which the tire contacts the road, the tire will break free of the 
road surface and spin, and spinning tires have little or no 
traction.

But one can also apply the engine power to all four wheels, 
instead of just two. This distributes the force through four tire 
contact patches, and, therefore, offers superior grip to two-
wheel drive under dry conditions but especially in wet and 
slippery conditions. AWD also offers improved stability under 
straight-line acceleration.

AWD advantages are not restricted to straight-line acceleration 
or slippery conditions. In cornering at the limit, the Carrera 4 
is less sensitive to power changes than a rear-drive car. As 
such, the horsepower will be more usable even by drivers less 
familiar with the traditional Porsche rear-drive sports car 
concept.

Because of physical constraints of the AWD system, the Carrera 4 
is available only with a five-speed manual transmission.

PORSCHE 911 AMERICA ROADSTER

Early in Porsche's history, the firm built about 20 examples of a 
special-bodied open car, intended solely for the American market. 
The original America Roadster of 1952 was perfectly suited to the 
rapidly growing sport of road racing. It was lighter than regular 
Porsches, thanks to its aluminum body, simple side curtains, lack 
of any weather protection, removable windshield, and spartan 
interior.

Porsche recaptures the aura of those early Porsches with the 1993 
911 America Roadster. This limited-edition rear-engined car 
combines the 3.6 liter normally aspirated engine of the Carrera 2 
clothed in a unique convertible body. The result is an evocative, 
voluptuously shaped machine which can be mistaken for no other 
Porsche. The America Roadster offers an unparalleled combination 
of high-performance hardware, fully power-operated top, and 
Carrera comfort. Like the Carrera 2, the America Roadster employs 
a speed-sensitive, electrically actuated rear spoiler which 
blends smoothly into the flowing bodywork when parked, but 
deploys at speeds above 50 mph to reduce aerodynamic lift and 
provide added air to the engine.

PORSCHE 911 RS AMERICA

Throughout its history, Porsche has offered special limited 
edition, high performance cars based on its regular production 
models. When the Porsche 911 was introduced in 1964, special 
higher-performance models were not long in coming. These included 
the 911 R of 1967 and the Carrera RS of 1973. Among collectors 
today, the 1973 Carrera RS is one of the most highly prized 
street-going Porsches ever built. The 1973 Carrera RS offered a 
choice of standard, racing or touring equipment and formed the 
basis of the racing Carrera RSR, which in 1973 won the 24 Hours 
of Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring, and both the IMSA Drivers 
and Manufacturers Championships.

For 1993, Porsche offers an RS for American customers. The 911 RS 
America, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS, is sold exclusively in 
the United States, and is also the most affordable model of the 
classic rear-engined Porsches. Its suggested retail price of 
$54,800 is more than $10,000 below that of the standard 911 
Carrera 2.

While the 911 Carrera 2, Carrera 4, and America Roadster offer a 
wide palette of options and special-order appointments, the RS 
America is reduced to the bare essentials of a street-legal 
sports car. The luxurious leather of the highly supportive Recaro 
bucket seats is replaced by corduroy. Much of the normal sound 
deadening found in standard cars is deleted. The rear seats, 
suitable for occasional use in the normal 911 series, are 
replaced by a flat parcel shelf and a pair of lockable storage 
bins. The flat inner door panels have no storage pockets, and the 
door release is by means of a simple nylon strap. The outside 
mirrors are adjusted manually. As a result of this trimming, the 
RS America is lighter than any other 911 model, which yields even 
higher performance limits. In contrast to other Porsche models, 
the RS America is available with only five options: a limited 
slip differential, air conditioning, sunroof, metallic paint and 
a basic AM/FM cassette system.

But the key to the RS America concept is its performance-oriented 
chassis tuning. Standard equipment includes larger 17-inch 
"Turbo-design" cast alloy wheels, with large openings to help 
cool the ventilated disk brakes and four-piston calipers. The 
tires are larger, lower and wider than those normally fitted to 
other 911s.

The RS America is also equipped with the M 030 sport suspension 
package, which is available as an option on the other members of 
the 911 family. The M 030 package includes coil springs and shock 
absorbers tuned for even higher handling limits. The rear springs 
are progressively wound. The M 030 suspension incorporates a 
larger diameter front stabilizer bar.

The RS America has unassisted rack and pinion steering for more 
feedback and better road feel under extreme conditions. Visually, 
the RS America is identified by its distinctive badges and large, 
fixed rear spoiler.

CARRERA 3.6 LITER ENGINE

The heart of any sports car is its engine, and the flat-six 
powerplant of the 911 family has become an integral part of the 
legend. From humble beginnings of only 1991 cc (121.5 cubic 
inches) and 130 DIN horsepower in 1964, the 911 engine has gone 
through many changes in displacement, power, material, and detail 
design. In 1993, it remains a high performance, state-of-the-art 
unit with 247 horsepower (SAE) and a displacement of 3600 cc (220 
cubic inches).

The 3.6 liter engine was introduced on the Carrera 4 for the 1989 
model year. The engine consists of a pressure-cast aluminum 
crankcase housing a forged steel crankshaft. The connecting rods 
are made of forged steel, and the pistons are of forged aluminum, 
concepts proven on the race track for nearly three decades. The 
aluminum alloy cylinder heads incorporate hemispherical 
combustion chambers and utilize two spark plugs per cylinder. The 
twin plugs grew out of Porsche's experience on the race track as 
well as feedback from high performance aircraft engines that were 
in turn based on the roadgoing 911 engine. Twin plugs allow the 
best of both worlds--higher power output as well as cleaner 
combustion, with less tendency to knock. The exhaust ports are 
ceramic-lined to lower engine cylinder head temperatures and 
increase the effectiveness of the catalytic converter. Each 
cylinder head contains a single chain-driven overhead cam, which 
actuates the valves through solid lifters. Air enters the engine 
through a resonance induction system, which assures optimum 
cylinder filling across abroad range of engine loads and speeds, 
and provides a wide, usable torque band.

The Porsche 911 engine is air cooled by a belt-driven fan. The 
911 has always used a dry sump lubrication system, common on race 
cars but seldom seen on road cars because of its complexity and 
cost. Two principal advantages of dry sump systems are that they 
are less sensitive to high cornering forces, which might cause 
lubrication problems with conventional oil pan systems, and they 
keep a large quantity of oil (in this case more than 12 quarts) 
in circulation to help cool the engine.

PERFORMANCE

The engineering features of the 911 series give this time-honored 
design performance that few rivals can match. With the five-speed 
manual transmission, the Carrera 2 accelerates to 60 mph in 5.5 
seconds, and can reach a top test track speed of 162 mph. The 
Tiptronic-equipped Carrera 2 can reach 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, and 
a top speed of 159 mph. The America Roadster achieves the same 
acceleration figures as the Carrera 2 (0-60 in 5.5 seconds, or 
6.4 seconds with Tiptronic), and top track speeds are 158 and 156 
mph respectively. Performance of the Carrera 4 is identical to 
the Carrera 2 with manual transmission. Thanks to its lighter 
weight, the RS America will accelerate to 60 mph in only 5.4 
seconds, and can reach a top track speed of 162 mph.

TIPTRONIC

The Carrera 2 and America Roadster are available with a five-
speed manual transmission or Porsche's unique four-speed 
Tiptronic automatic transmission. The Tiptronic is the most 
sophisticated automatic transmission presently available in the 
automobile industry.

Like so many of Porsche's key engineering features, the Tiptronic 
owes its existence in part to experience on the race track. In 
the mid 1980's, Porsche experimented with a unique semiautomatic 
transmission, the PDK, in several Porsche 962 Group C race cars.

The Tiptronic offers Porsche drivers an even wider choice of 
driving styles: the transmission can be left in "Drive" like a 
conventional automatic, or the driver can move the lever to a 
special gate and manually go up and down through the gears by 
"tipping" the lever forward or backward.

The Tiptronic features electro-hydraulic control, a lockup torque 
converter (in the upper three gears) and feedback to the engine 
control system for smooth shifts. Input parameters include 
throttle position, throttle opening or closing speed, engine rpm, 
vehicle speed, lateral and straight-line acceleration.

Even in its full automatic mode, the Tiptronic displays 
capabilities unmatched by any other automatic transmission on the 
market today. It can virtually sense the driver's needs, avoiding 
unwanted up- or downshifts which detract from sporty driving with 
conventional automatics. This is made possible by five distinct 
shift programs ranging from sport to economy (other automatic 
transmissions offer two or at best three driver-selected shift 
modes), additional sensors, and adaptive logic in its control 
unit. There is no separate switch to select a shift mode; the 
system actively determines which of the five available shift maps 
to use. The control unit senses how the car is being driven and 
responds accordingly.

If the shift lever is moved straight over to the right from its 
"Drive" position, the transmission goes into its manual mode; the 
Tiptronic shifts up on driver demand or automatically when engine 
speed reaches the optimum point on the torque curve, whichever 
occurs first. Conversely, if the driver requests a downshift that 
would result in over-revving, the Tiptronic defers the shift 
until speed has decreased appropriately.

The Tiptronic gives away only a small performance margin to the 
Carrera 2 with a five-speed manual, but offers in return greater 
comfort in congested driving conditions while still enabling the 
traditional sports car enjoyment of going through the gears. 
Because it is less dependent on individual drivers' styles with 
clutch and shift lever, Tiptronic lends itself to an effective 
exhaust emissions reduction strategy and allows better control of 
fuel consumption and noise emissions.

SUSPENSION

Like the 3.6 liter engine, the present 911 suspension was 
introduced in 1989 on the Carrera 4. At the front, the suspension 
consists of MacPherson struts with gas-filled shocks, forged 
aluminum lower A-arms, and a stabilizer bar. At the rear, toe-
correcting semi-trailing arms are controlled by gas-filled struts 
and a stabilizer bar. This system, with its coil springs over 
shock absorbers front and rear, replaces the torsion bar 
springing which had been a 911 trademark since the car's birth.

The steering is a rack and pinion unit, with force-sensitive 
hydraulic assist (the RS America steering is unassisted). This 
system and the new suspension design keep road irregularities and 
bumps from kicking back through the steering column, yet allow 
the driver to sense the cornering forces and interact with the 
car -- part of the essence of sports car driving.

BRAKES

The brakes of Porsche's 911 family are measurably among the best 
in the world. The brakes of the 911 Carrera 2, Carrera 4 and RS 
America consist of vented discs front and rear, 298 mm (11.73 
inches) at the front, 299 mm (11.77 in.) at the rear. The 911 
America Roadster uses larger 322 mm (12.68 in.) front brakes 
derived from the 911 Turbo. On all models, four-piston calipers 
are used front and rear. Anti-lock braking (ABS) is standard on 
all models.

SPECIAL OPTIONS AND EUROPEAN DELIVERY

Porsche owners who would like to further personalize their cars 
can take advantage of Porsche's special options. Porsche offers a 
wide range of special order items to make each car uniquely 
individual. These include paintwork to match any sample color and 
leather to duplicate any sample shade. Virtually every interior 
item may be ordered with factory-applied leather trim.

Every Porsche may be ordered through U.S. dealers for European 
delivery. The European delivery program offers an unforgettable 
driving experience, in one's own personal car on the high-speed 
motorways and scenic, winding secondary roads from which 
Porsche's legendary road-going sports cars are bred.

PORSCHE, SPORTS CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Porsche is not only a leader in high technology and high 
performance, but is also an industry leader in environmental 
responsibility. This begins with building cars to last. Of all 
the Porsches built since 1948, it is estimated that fully 80 
percent are still in service.

Part of that longevity comes from the fully galvanized bodywork 
of the Porsche 911. Porsche pioneered the use of two-sided 
galvanized body panels in 1976. Since then, experience has shown 
the effectiveness of the fully galvanized bodywork and other rust 
preventive measures. Porsche can now warranty every new Porsche 
for ten years against rust perforation. The solidity of the 
bodywork has been a factor in maintaining Porsche's traditionally 
high resale values.

If and when a Porsche reaches the end of its useful life and is 
recycled, labeling of various plastic components will make it 
easier to reprocess the parts. Labeling will help to put plastics 
back into consumer products, not in landfills.

Despite their high performance, Porsche cars are among the 
cleanest on the road. Highly effective three-way catalytic 
converters, oxygen sensors, and engine management systems have 
long been a part of the Porsche pedigree. All Porsche models are 
equipped with systems that fulfill the most stringent exhaust 
standards worldwide.

Porsche also limits noise emissions from the 911. Although 
enthusiasts enjoy the sound of a Porsche engine, not everyone may 
be so inclined. The 911 incorporates partial engine encapsulation 
which fulfills even the strict Swiss drive-by noise regulations.

Growing concern about the possible effects of 
chlorofluorocarbons, including the CFC-12 refrigerants used in 
automotive air conditioning systems, on the earth's ozone layer, 
has led Porsche to introduce a CFC-free refrigerant, HFC-134a, on 
all of its 1993 models. The entire air conditioning system had to 
be redesigned to use the new refrigerant. The higher cost of HFC-
134a, and its higher salvage value, also provide a monetary 
recycling incentive for repair shops.

PASSIVE SAFETY

The agility, precise handling and high power of Porsche sports 
cars places them among the world's best cars in terms of active 
safety. Passive safety is also a prime consideration at Porsche. 
In 1990, Porsche was the world's first auto manufacturer to equip 
every car sold in the United States with driver and front 
passenger airbags as standard equipment.

WARRANTY

Thanks to decades of experience building solid, durable high-
performance cars, Porsche's warranty coverage is among the 
broadest of any sports car manufacturer. Each Porsche is covered 
by a two-year new vehicle warranty with unlimited mileage, and 
includes the Porsche ASSIST (TM) roadside assistance program 
(pending approval for vehicles sold in California). The fully 
galvanized body and 26-step paint and anti-corrosion process 
enable Porsche to warranty each car for ten years and unlimited 
mileage against rust perforation, protection unmatched by any 
other sports car maker. In addition, the paintwork carries a 
three-year limited warranty.

Subject: Timing Belts, Car Covers, Waxes, Wheels


1) Timing Belt Breakage

My 931 had an unusual belt breakage mode.  It seems the previous owner's
mechanic was quite incompetent and installed the tensioner pulley wrong.
It was hung up on the timing pointer on the side of the block and would
not turn.  So the belt was sliding over a stationary pulley, which was not
very good for the outside.  Whatever strength was left in the fibers gave 
way the afternoon I bought the car.  It was a sad situation indeed.  I
confirmed that the 924S had a new belt before I bought it...

2) Water in the Taillights

I was driving around last night and a car pulled up next to me at a 
stoplight - the driver motioned for me to roll down my window.  "You've
got water in one of your taillights; I can see it sloshing around as you 
drive."  Lucky for me we just discussed that one; while we're on the 
subject...

3) Car Covers

It appears as though my garage won't be cleared out for another month or
two, so I better start considering the purchase of a car cover.  Any 
favorite material or suppliers for these?  I looked in Performance and 
Tweeks, wondering how much of a premium they get.  Also windshield shades:
how does the genyouwine Porsche shade compare to the aftermarket ones?
Is it really useful to have the reflective liner on the outside, or would
a well-cut piece of corrugated do just as well?

4) Waxes

Pano had a good article on end-of-season cleaning etc. and had some 
recommendations for waxes (Zymol and original Simonize were two 
mentioned).  Any opinions on this? I'm more concerned with protective
ability and longevity than maximal gloss.

5) Wheels

After parting with the 931, I was left with the original mesh wheels. I
wish to use them on the new car, but they are in various stages of
disrepair.  One just needs refinishing, but two others had met up with a
brick at highway speeds.  Of these, one is slightly bent (barely
noticable) the other moreso. (I had it staightened, then Zyglo'ed to see
if there were any serious fractures.  Seeing none, I ran it on the street,
without incident, for a year or so.)  What I'd like to know is how one
objectively or quantitatively determines whether a wheel is damaged too
much to be run (neither 'I don't think I'd trust it' or 'It should be OK'
seem to suffice).  Are the wheel dealers in Pano a trustworthy lot.  If I
buy a new wheel or two I want to have some confidence in my decision.
Also, what wheel/tire sizes can I fit under those svelte wheelwells?


Thanks for your help!

Tony -

Regarding wheels, Porsche has some published limit to the run-out they consider
acceptable in a rim.  I looked, but am unable to put my hands on the spec.  I 
don't know how much damage a rim can take and still be useable.  It is certainly
the case that the repairs have left you with rims weaker than they originally
were.

I've bought two sets of rims from Robert Wood, and am most happy with the wheels
and the seller.  He advertises in Pano.  I have heard a few negative things said
about Ernie's Alloys, another advertiser.

   Evidently some wealthy german was taking it across Canada or

   The car is supposed to be sitting in their showroom for a day or

If it's a 4-speed, there's no telling what it is. See if you can find anything

Clues in your search: the '70 914s had the same rear hub carriers as the

reinforced "pads" on the back of the hub where the 5-lug pattern

a '70 914 donor car, snatch the hubs, weld up the 4-lug holes, heat-treat
the part, re-drill for 5-lug. Real 914/6 hubs are made of unobtainium.

For the best *REAL* fix, at about $1000, send your trailing arms to G.

Being a relative new comer to the porschephiels mailing list, I don't
know if this has been discussed yet. Bear with me if this a repeat.

I own an 86 944 Turbo and it's time for an oil change. I'd like to
know how people feel about the use of the new Castrol synthetic motor
oil Syntec.

The brochure from Castrol says it is rated 5w-50. The owners manual
recommends 20w-50 so this seems like it would be better for cold
weather starting.

The brochure also states that it provides extra protection because the
oil polymers are negatively charged. This negative charge attracts to
the positively charged engine components which means the oil stays
"attached" to the engine components when it is not running.

If people are using this oil, do you follow the normal oil change
intervals? 

Finally, what about Slick 50? A friend who owns a Saab 9000 says that
when he uses Slick 50 "You can't hear any turbo whine".

Comments and discussion would be appreciated.

I have another question on this topic.  Bruce Anderson ALWAYS warned
against fuel with alcohol in it for fear of causing water to reach
the injectors.  BP says in a handout on the new Calif fuels that it may 
use Ethanol or MTBE as its oxygenator.  Anyone know? or should we care?

Subject: 914 Motor Mounts question

I have a set of new motor mounts for my 914, and wondered if you 914
hackers out there had any advice on installing the front ones.

Is it easy/possible to install them without completely taking the
engine out?  The various shop manuals don't really mention this, and
all I can see from underneath the car is the lower ends of the mounts.
I can't see how the top ends of the mounts attach to the engine (btw I
haven't ever taken a 914 engine out yet...)

I had planned on getting the rear of the car up on ramps, supporting
the motor with a floor jack, and removing the big horizontal engine
mounting bar.  Once I do this, will I be able to get the motor mounts
off the motor?  Also, should I expect any problems just getting the
big mounting bar off?

[The rear mounts look very easy to install, so I figured I'd do the
front ones first...  Btw, my current mounts seem to be *extremely*
worn -- I see the shift lever move (and feel the engine move) when
accelerating in first gear or letting the clutch out...]

Thanks for your help!

Subject: PHMFH


Am I the only person with this problem or am I the only one that
tries to address it with impatience for the stupid?  A summary
of expeiences, primarily in the Porsche.

I don't understand the concept of "Lane Ownership" in the USA.  I never
experience this driving outside the USA.  This area (N. California) is
particularly bad for this activity.  I had another one of these
encounters last night.  I find them about every few months around
here.  This is the first I have had driving the Cherokee.  We took it
to Los Angeles instead of the Porsche (could it have been out of
concern for RELIABILITY?  Naw..  the 931 never breaks).  On the return,
we found one..  a real Class 6 PHMFH.  I wish I had been driving the
P-car.  However, the Toyota 4-runner was no match for the Cherokee's
big six.  

The scene....  You come up on a car/truck, usually a mini truck, but
sometimes a Chevrolet Camaro or an occassional Pontiac Firebird.  These
rank in the top 80 percent of the encounters around here.  The driver
is always a male, below 35 years old, with the majority in their mid
20's.  This vehicle is in the left lane with no cars in front.  If it
is possible, this vehicle is driving beside another vehicle, matching
it's speed.  The actual speed is irrelevant.  It can be above or below
the posted limit.  However, it is "the speed" to be driven in that
lane.  Anything else to too fast.  Your closing speed prior to meeting
this individual is fast enough ( => ~10 mph) to let him (always male)
know that you do not want to be his highway companion.  He already
knows you are not another one of his type anyway.  You are driving the
wrong type of vehicle.  He won't move.  He won't pass the other
vehicle.  You know you have probably come across a "Psychotic Highway
Monitor From Hell," or PHMFH for short.

PHMFH's are particularly sensitive to Porsches.  It really gets the
adrenaline flowing quickly.  They are more sympathetic to other
mini-trucks and Ford Mustang GT's.  However, if you are in the P-car,
you have the upper hand in speed and maneuverability, so use it to your
advantage.  The mini-trucks are slugs in the wind, so one it turns into
a high speed chase, you will blow them away, probably adding to their
hate for these vehicles of the "intelligent elite anti-monitoring
force" of the highways.  

Continuing on with the battle... There is traffic in the right, so you couldn't blast around
on the right, allowing them to "own his lane" uncontested, not raising
his attention until you pass.  If you do blast on the right, he is
satisfied that he has done his duty anyway and will continue down the
road gloating over his success in owning his lane, preventing you, a
rich M.F. Porsche driver from taking it away from a hardworking union
ditch digger.  He will swear to get the next one.  Of course, due to
his low intelligence and inability to perform basic math functions, he
doesn't realize that the shiny, new mini-truck that he is driving is
worth 3 times the value of your 931.  You are driving the P-car, and
P-car drivers must be taught a lesson.  They are the worst enemy of the
PHMFH.

Strategy...  First, always get a license number if you suspect this is
going to be a PHMFH encounter.  You never know what will happen if this
is a Class 10 PHMFH.  Class 10's will cause physical damage to the car
or occupants.  He thinks he is going fast enough.  Anybody going
"faster" doesn't while he is in charge of this lane and he will fight
to the finish to protect it.  You wait patiently at a reasonable
distance while he looks in the mirror.  No flashing of the headlights,
no tailgating.  Only use these tactics if you are CERTAIN this is not a
PHMFH, only a HM (Highway Monitor, also know as an inconsiderate
idiot).  HMFH are harmless and do not react to any stimuli from the
surrounding vehicles.  They just passively cruise down the highway in
their own world.  Using any of the standard  "I want to pass please"
activities against a PHMFH will mean full scale warfare only curable by
an exorcist.  It is best to let him think that he is in control of HIS
lane.  Being of inferior intelligence, the PHMFH is at your mercy.  One
tactic is to lull them into thinking that they have total lane
control.  Their attention will fade if you don't push it by weaving,
tailgating, etc.  After a couple of minutes of this, you see a 3+ car
length opening for you you blast around on the right.  You have caught
him off guard.  The few brain cells that he has are devoted to other
activities, perhaps belching or passing gas.  His arm is not stretched
across the top of the seat and you see that he has not looked at you in
his mirrors for some time.  Possibly he's changing the heavy-metal or
country music station on his radio.  Never signal your intention.  The
flashing light will alert him to your actions.  Go for it!  Make it
quick and smooth.  Be prepared to react.  You will have a price to pay
if this is truly a PHMFH versus a normal inconsiderate idiot HM.  You
are about to find out.


The Lane Steal...  As you change lanes, take a quick glance at his
exhaust pipe to see if this is going to be a close one.  PHMFH will now
floor it in order to close the gap.  You will see an increase in smoke
from the pipe.  However, if you did this right, you had the element of
surprise.  If you did this right, the smoke shouldn't appear until your
front fender is next to his rear bumper.  Remember, all you want to do
is get around this vehicle.  Avoid endangering others.  Don't try to
get even.  Just get away.  The sooner you are away from a PHMFH, the
better it will be for everybody around.  Don't put others at risk.  The
PHMFH has no concept of endangering others.  

If your horsepower is sufficient, you make it before he closes the
gap.  Don't worry that you almost take off his fender of bumper in the
process.  You are dealing with an inconsiderate crazy that thrives on
this type of activity.  It won't matter anyway.  You will be punished
for attempting to steal his lane.  If you are successful, you make it,
but have to suffer the wrath of bright lights, and until you superior
speed and driving ability gets you away from this idiot, often
resulting in sprints to 100+ mph until he or his vehicle tires and he
falls back to his normal highway monitoring speed, waiting for the next
victim.  In medium traffic, you can get away by pulling a completely
illegal, but usually justifiable, maneuver by passing in the emergency
lane one you get a PHMFH on your tail.  Use this one for Class 8 and
above PHMFH encounters.  Class 8 encounters are those where the chase
excedes 3 minutes at speeds 30MPH above the flow of traffic with more
than 5 evasive lane changes with full brights at a distance between
bumpers of 10 feet or less.  PHMFH's will almost never follow in my
experience.  Being caught by the police should be of minor worry.  The
police will not be as sympathetic to a tire iron waving idiot with
bright lights on trailing inches from the bumper of your car.  Having a
wife and kids in your car will only add to the negative image portrayed
by the PHMFH to the cop.

The aftermath...  Once you get away from them, they almost never
return.  They prefer Lane Monitor activities to actual warfare with a
driver of superior intelligence.  Due to the small brain size, they
forget within a few minutes once you are out of sight.  If he is
driving a freshly washed vehicle, you can further piss them off during
their reaction mode by washing your windshield or even better is using
the rear washer/wiper.  The overspray will go back on his vehicle,
resulting in two reactions.  The PMMFH will either back off, continuing
with the bright lights activity  for a while or he will become
completely insane, killing the driver and passenger.
  
Warning...  Never let a PHMFH get beside or in front of you.  Avoid
this at any cost.  They will attempt to lock up their brakes or, even
worse, when beside you can be in an excellent position for taking shots
at you.  If you find a particularly violent individual (Class 10
PHMFH), pull over and stop quickly.  They usually don't know how to
deal with somebody actually stopping or cannot react quickly enough to
stop near your car.  After all, your 4 wheel discs are no match for a 4
wheel drive.  They will often drive on after attempting a stop.   find
a location that will give you some maneuvering room.  If you must stop,
try to get the PHMFH to stop *behind* you.  Being the stupid, psychotic
creature from hell that they are, they don't realize that they are
being setup.  It give's great satisfaction to cover the PHMFH with
gravel as they approach your vehicle from the rear.  If you must stop
because they are in front of you, try to pick an area where you can
pass on either side of the PHMFH's car if he is in front.  For example,
don't stop near an area where you will have to deal with merging
traffic.  You might be quite busy in getting away.  No sense in
further complicating the issue.  Sit in your car while they get out
with their weapons, usually a tire iron.  When they approach, get the
hell out if your do not have a superior weapon.  Ever wonder why they
have a tire iron so conviently located *inside* the passenger
compartment?  It ain't there so they can change tires quickly.  Pay
attention that they do not remove the shotgun from the rear window
rack.

I would like to see a psychological study done on these crazies.  I
have my theories...  about intelligence, genital size, frustrated
football player that never made first string, little kid that always go
the shit kicked out of him, voted for Bush, or worse, perhaps believes
in racial purity and sympathizes with the KKK, Nazi's.), etc.

This is being done in Oregon now also.  Bruce Anderson was in
town over the weekend of the PCA Oregon Region RainBonnet.
Oxygenated fuels was one thing he was asked about.  Gas
companies are using Ethanol for gas in Oregon.  Bruce said
this is bad especially for CIS engines.  It sounds like the
problem is that the alcohol loosens deposits in the fuel tank
causing the whole fuel system to be contaminated.  The entire
fuel system has to then be replaced.  Another problem is that
the gasoline, alcohol, and water separate.  He mentioned there
is a company (he didn't have the name) which is supposed to
have a fairly good additive which keeps the gas, alcohol, and
fuel from separating.

Subject: 911 warm-start problem

I have a '76 911S.  It runs well in general (it ought to, I just had a
$$ top-end rebuild), except for a couple of starting problems.  A
dead-cold-in-the-morning start catches immediately, but then tends to
cough and buck a while (and will stall unless I keep goosing the
accelerator) before settling in.  This problem is not too bad, but it
is getting worse (perhaps as the weather grows colder).  But the worst
case is a warm start, say after leaving the car turned off for 1/2
hour or an hour on on hot day.  Under those conditions the car will
just not catch at all until I have run the starter motor for around 30
seconds (in three 10-second attempts).  I mean there is nothing.  It
is as if there was no fuel delivery or no spark.  Then, once the
engine catches, it seems to be running on 2 cylinders (or so), with a
pronounced "chug-chug-chug" effect.  After about 10 seconds of
accelerator pedal frobbing to keep it from stalling, the rest of the
cylinders progressively "cut in" and things begin running smoothly.

Any clues as to the cause of this?  I am not an experienced mechanic
(my biggest projects on this car so far have been repairing the
sunroof mechanism and replacing the hot-air heater blower motor), but
I'd like to learn, and I would especially like to be as informed as
possible before visiting the shop again, should that become necessary.

Thanks.

Not only is it possible to do it without taking the engine out, it
is the best method.  I assume you mean the front mounts that look
like rubber cylinders with a 10mm lug sticking from each end.  Just
jack up the engine from the bottom with the floor jack and disconnect
the mount from the bar.  DO NOT remove the bar, there is no need
plus the linkage is in the way etc... The upper part of the mount 
attatched to the front of the engine and the new mount will slip in.
You have room to raise the engine at least 8 inches using a floor
jack with the front mounts disconnected from the bar.

The car is designed so you can replace the mounts without removing the
engine or the bar.  It's tough to draw an ascii picture of it, so I'll
try to use words.  The front of the engine has 2 L-shaped attachments
where the side is bolted to the engine, and the bottom of the L has a
slot cut in it.  The screw coming out of the top of the mount goes through
the slot and a washer and nut goes on it.  The other end of the mount
goes through the bar.

I bought a car 5 years ago which had both front mounts broken at the
time, so any hard acceleration in first gear made a loud bang as the
engine lifted and fell back on the bar/broken mounts.  :)

From: Jeffrey A. Shorey <js@egr.duke.edu>
Subject: Re: 914 Motor Mounts question

It's easy to do without dropping the engine.  Note that there are two different
kinds of engine mounts - the 70-72 is the rubber-surrounded type and the 73-76
is just a U-shaped solid metal plate.  Each mount is set into a well in the 
body bolted on by two 13mm bolts.  You should be able to sort of reach up and
around the engine support bar and remove the mount once you have unbolted it.
You may have to move the support bar around to get the main support bolts
to drop through their holes in the support bar once you've replaced the mounts.  
If you have the parts, I would suggest upgrading to the 73-76 style engine
mount and engine support bar, as there is no rubber to rip out in the mount
and the support bar has holes in it to accomodate the shifting linkage and
the clutch cable - a much cleaner look to it.  You will get a more
positive feel in shifting with the update.  Of course all this assumes you
have a 70-72 vehicle to begin with...

Item Subject: 911'S' vs 911'T' in A Stock (SCCA SOLO II)

Someone wrote:

".....  We have come across a really clean 72 Porsche
911T, for a seemingly reasonable price, because the engine is seized. John
has a stock motor, brakes
and other bits of a 72 911S that could go right in, but is that a legal
configuration for AS? There is a difference of about 50 horsepower
between the two engines,
I'm not sure about the brakes. What would the car be then considered, a
911T or 911S? The rule book states that cars must be run as specified from
factory. How should I interpret that?  ".

Well, this brings up a great subject. I hope we get many comments....

Since the only difference between a 911 T and a 911 S is the engine (all
suspension options for the 'S' could have been bought from the factory-
installed at the factory as the 'S' option, which includes the bigger front
brake calipers/upgraded instrumentation package/exterior trim) and since
the weight is the same (except of course the difference in weight of the
trick Nicosil Aluminum/Nickel plated cylinders and forged pistons in the
'S'- compared to the cast iron cylinders/cast aluminum in the 'T'- all of
which is about 18 lb. or 3 Big Mac's and fries around your gut), I don't see
why it wouldn't be okay to run a A Stock.  This is assuming that you keep
the mechanical injection system, stock rear sway bar and 6" wheel width!
The chassis is the same for a 911T/E/S!  BEWARE: Stay away from
updating the chain tensioners with the pressure fed Carrera style tensioners
(even though it can save you $4800.00 in bent valves/top end rebuild
expenses-yes I know how much this can cost- my '73 911S tensioners went
south and caused extensive engine problems!!!) because someone will
protest you (a real sore spot here- Porsche did not EVER RECOMMEND
UPDATING to this system in their service manuals due to liability
reason=big $$$$ for Porsche to eat).  Anyway, I'm off on a tangent.......

My only comment about an 'S' verses a 'T':  Since I've had both, I know
that in 90% of all local/region Autox's, a 911S will not be as quick as a
911T because of the lack of torque at low RPM's.  My '73 S was faster than
hell after 4500 rpm but very soft before that, while my '72T is very quick on
tight courses due to the much needed low end torque below 5000 RPM!
Ideally, the 911 'E' is probably the best all around performance 911, since it
has very good low end torque and still pulls very hard to 6800 RPM
(typically the most you turn in the lower gears on a 911 on a tight course).
One comment however--- If you have the wonderful opportunity to have an
event that is fairly open, then the 911 S will kill a 'T' (I know from
experience at Nationals in '91!!).  Choose your poison!

Additionally, you may want to check your gear ratios and see if you have a
LSD in your 911. The gear options available- AGAIN FROM THE
FACTORY- allowed for many different customer applications (I have a
close ratio 'airport' box in mine ((FROM THE FACTORY)) but no LSD- a
real bummer because the LSD really <!!!> helps).

  Lastly until the RX7TT moves to SS, all of us 911 drivers are going to
have to learn how to drive like Russ Wiles (quick BMW M3 but
phenomenal driving skill- Russ where are you!!!) so we can compete with
these cars.  Should be fun though- competition makes us all improve!!
And if it stays in A Stock, then more the reason to learn how to drive
FAST! (Ha)!

Anyway, these are IMHO only (being an air cooled Porsche driver/fan)

Good'ay,

Mr. Wizard

ps: If anyone knows Russ Wiles or has his Phone #, Please Email it to me
or have him contact me regarding my pet BMW M3 project I'm about to
undertake!  My phone # is :  Glenn Ingram (208) 323-5047 w or (208)
343-2724 h). Thanks!

pss: If you don't buy this 911T, please let me know- I'd like to buy it
since I'm setting up a 911 for PCA Club Racing!!  Thanks again!

psss: Does anyone have any documantation that may stated that the factory
recommends updating the tensions on early model cars to the pressure fed
types!!! Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!  Thanks again,agin!

Actually, there are two *SETS* of mounts. There is the mount on the end
of the bar, and there is the mount between the bar and engine. It's
the mount between the bar and engine, which is a big lump of rubber 
with a piece of Grade-8 6mm threaded stock with a square locator
doo-dad on it. This is the part the most frequently goes bad.

BTW, I'm having some Delrin motor mounts and suspension bushings made up.
Anyone want some? Not sure what I can sell them to you for yet, as I haven't
gotten the final machine shop price, but I'd bet two motor mounts would be
less than $50... (I found a Delrin source at $15/linear foot....)

accelerator pedal frobbing to keep it from stalling, the rest of the
cylinders progressively "cut in" and things begin running smoothly.

Any clues as to the cause of this?  I am not an experienced mechanic
(my biggest projects on this car so far have been repairing the
sunroof mechanism and replacing the hot-air heater blower motor), but
I'd like to learn, and I would especially like to be as informed as
possible before visiting the shop again, should that become necessary.

Thanks.

Subject: RE: Castrol Syntec & Slick 50

Synthetic is great - read the latest Automobile magazine's column on it 
(the technical column by ? Trent Jarman ?). I've used it for years, and 
it really improves lubrication at startup and during high-stress 
situations.  A turbo car will benefit even more, since turbo bearing 
coking is a real problem, even in 951s (I've seen failed cool-down pumps...).

You must still change the oil at your usual intervals, because it gets 
contaminated, and the add-ins eventually start breaking down.  Moisture 
also builds up, which you need to remove.

Based on information I've heard, I'd strongly recommend against Slick 
50 on several grounds.  Yes, it reduces simple friction.  However, it 
can actually damage Porsche aluminum engines through time, due to 
chemical interactions.  A PCA member who is also in the chemistry field 
recently did a test of it, and discovered this.  Slick 50 has a 
wonderful marketing campaign, but then, they have to in order to sell 
something you don't need.

Frequent oil changes and good quality oil are all your engine needs.  
This is the message I've heard from automotive engineers, racers, and a 
friend who works at Exxon...

I've seen two of the outer mounts go bad.  It's only the old style that have
this problem - basically you're driving along and all of the sudden you can't
shift out of first gear.  You get out of the car, go around back, and find
your exhaust tilting to one side at about a 20 degree angle, and thank
your good fortune that your sagging support bar, now one inch from the
ground on one side, didn't catch on the asphalt.

Perhaps that's why Porsche changed these particular mounts to solid ones in
73 - in later cars the ones you are referring to are the only ones left to
go bad.

Just prejudiced by past experience...

Actually, I believe that any given car only has rubber mounts in
one place.  The early cars had rubber mounts where the engine support
bar joins the body, and a solid connection at the engine crankcase.
The bar in this case is fabricated steel (square tubing with welded
fittings).

The late cars (I believe it was coincident with the sideshifter
transmission) have solid mounts where the bar joins the body, and
the center of the bar has the pair of "hockey pucks with studs" between
it and a bracket to the crankcase. The bar in this case is a casting,
with a large hole for the shift linkage.

The whole assembly is interchangable (bar, body mounts, crankcase
mounts), assuming suitable things are done to make the shift linkage
clear, between early and late series 914's, I believe.

I just remembered what Bruce Anderson said about Slick 50.  It reacts
to create sulphuric acid.

When other thing he said was if Porsche recommends something go ahead

Subject: High Performance Tires



Someone commented on High Performance Tires:

>The A008RSII (that is, RS-2) is Yoko's latest bid to
>catch up to the 206 R1.  Some autocrossers are not
>sure that they like it.  I'm not sure what the real
>difference is between the RSII and the RS, I'm afraid.

The real difference between the RS and the RSII's is the
following:
1] The overall tire construction has changed.

 Yoko softened up the side wall to may the tire less
'twitchy', that is, the tire response is slightly less in the
RSII than in the RS.  This was done to allow drivers to
'feel' the tire limits better and not quickly reach and
exceed the limits of adhesion.  Old Yoko's have a
tendency to let go rather quickly when the ultimate
adhesion limit has been exceeded.  Once exceeded,
they are very difficult to control (that is, you loose it big
time!!!).  BFG's on the other hand, exhibit much more
side wall flex.  This gives more input to the driver's
'feel' of the tire adhesion characteristics.  BFG's are
easier to drive than YOKO's and allow an average
driver to drive at 10/10th's and not get into real serious
trouble.  BFG's give lots of warning when approaching
their limit of adhesion and allow drivers to drive at the
edge and not experience catastrophic 'uncontrolled
dynamic responses' ( a little humor here- read: spin your
cars VERY quickly!!).

2) Yoko rounded over the edge on the side wall similar
to BFG's to allow slightly less 'turn-in' response.

Again, as mentioned above, this gives the driver a slight
delay in tire reaction as he/she turns into a corner.  This
condition was proven to me rather quickly when I
switched from Bridgestone RE71R's (which operate at
high slip angles like BFG's) to 008RS's.  The
Bridgestones, as with the BFG's, react much slower
upon turn in than with the Yoko's.  The 1st time I drove
on YOKO's (I've been a contract driver for them for 2
years), I spun my 911 almost every corner due to their
quick turn in response.  They really made me learn how
to drive smoothly (or be dead last)!!

In general, the RS/RSII's require a very smooth driving
technique, one in which the driver must KNOW the
limit of the car and the tires and approach this limit
gently.  Never trying to 'throw the car' around.  This
will quickly spin the car!!!  BFG's, on the other hand,
allow the average driver to drive aggressively and
exceed his limit.  The tire can easily be brought back
from 'over the edge' without spinning the car.


>If you're talking about high-speed racetrack events,
>you won't want the 206.  You might consider the 204-
>compound R1, but someone else is probably
>more familiar with what's available in high-speed tires.

Yes, this is very true. The 206's will overheat and
blister quickly if uses in high speed track events while
the 204's are designed to be used in this type of
environment (I was told that BFG used their Road Race
compound on the 204, which is still very sticky
compared to the standard 008RS).

A side note:  The 204's (non-shaved) make GREAT
rain tires!!!!  Last year I got a ride in (heavy down pour)
at a Portland International Raceway (Oregon) in an old
356 Porsche that had 204's.  I was impressed at the
adhesion of these tires in the dry, but when it started to
pour cats and dogs on the track, the driver (very
experienced in PCA Time Trials/Road Racing) didn't
slow down.  We went into turn 1 very fast (!) and I
really thought we were going to spin....but the tire kept
sticking!!!!  I must admit he really scared me at first but
I could see that the BFG's really gripped well in the wet
and gave lots of feedback on the adhesion!  If they
started to slide, he would lift slightly and the car would
tuck back into the proper racing line.  Also, the BFG's
worked well in the 'dry' racing line even in the wet (One
quickly learns that at PIR there is definitely a 'wet'
racing line when it rains- read:  stay of the rubber in the
dry line or you will spin quickly ((experience speaking
here!)).  Yoko's, on the other hand, do not do well in
the wet. PERIOD!  You will quickly reach your 'pucker
factor' if you push these tires in the rain!! (again,
experience speaking here!).

Another quick comment ( then I'll shut up<!>):

Bridgestones (DOT) dry race tire- the RAZ - is said to be 1-1.5
seconds quicker on a racecourse (specifically Sears
Point in Ca) than the 204's!  This was proven in tire
testing by Mark Dickens (owner/driver) of Projects
Racing Services (707) 996-7719 (tell him I said so!).
His business develops specialty racing
devices/accessories for SCCA ITS 944's.  He is VERY
experienced in racing and has tested
Yoko's/BFG's/Bridgestones.  I also know these tires are
quick because I had the pleasure of driving behind a
944 Turbo at a track event at Portland (befor it rained).
The RAZ's he had on were VERY worn (read: just
about corded) and he was very quick through the
corners.  (I'm going to experiment with these tires next
year and may run them at the PCA Club Racing events
we plan to attend- I'll keep everyone informed on their
adhesion characteristics).

Sorry for so much band width on this subject.

Hope this information is useful.

Good'ay,

Mr. Wizard

Subject: Oxygenated fuels


The following is reprinted (without permission, but I don't think 
they'll mind) from the November 1992 issue of "Porsche Spiel" 
(the newsletter by the Pacific Northwest Region, Porsche Club of 
America).

                     Oxygenated Fuel Blends
                       by Allan Caldwell

Starting November 1, car owners in Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish 
and Spokane counties of Washington State will find their favorite 
fuel pumps have a new label on them indicating that the fuel is 
oxygenated and will reduce carbon monoxide motor vehicle 
emissions. This federally mandated change in fuel blending will 
occur during the winter months until the end of February, a 
period when most cars run less efficiently and emit more carbon 
monoxide. The most common blending agents used in the oxygenated 
fuels are ethanol up to 10% or Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) 
of about 2.7%. The oxygenated fuels are claimed to reduce carbon 
monoxides by 15 to 20%, a sizeable number. (Do you suppose it can 
help pass the emission tests?) A number of other metropolitan 
areas have been using the oxygenated fuels for several winters 
and reports from Porsche owners I have talked to indicate that 
their air quality is definitely better.
    Ethanol has about 2/3 the unit heating value of gasoline, so 
each gallon of 10% ethanol gasoline is down in energy level by 
1/3 of 10% or 3%. This results in more fuel burned to achieve the 
same power output and most owners report reduced fuel mileage. 
There is also a change in fuel mixture which seems to affect the 
cars with carburetors more than those with fuel injection. The 
carbureted cars often require readjustment of the idle mixture 
controls to achieve adequate driveablility. MTBE is also lower in 
heating value than gasoline but seems to be less of a problem 
than ethanol. There is a deposit problem with MTBE which is 
apparently handled by the detergent package added by the oil 
company.
    The big question is the ethanol and its effect on Porsche 
fuel injection systems. As far as I can tell, there have been no 
technical bulletin advisories on the subject, although the latest 
model owner handbooks have a statement that says fuel containing 
methanol should not be used in the Porsche. Methanol is much more 
corrosive than ethanol and has not been recommended for use by 
Porsche or Bosch in any of the technical meetings I have 
attended. However, the big problem with any alcohol type 
derivative, including ethanol, is its affinity for water. Any 
water that it picks up will be carried into the fuel system, and 
if not carried on through, can cause corrosion of expensive 
internal metal parts exposed to the fuel/alcohol/water mixture. 
This can be really serious for cars that are not driven 
continuously during the winter months. The mechanical injection 
and K Jetronic systems used in the time period from 1969 until 
the mid 1980's on the 911, 911 Turbo and various other models 
such as the 924 and 928, are the most critical in this regard due 
to their design of having so many of the critical components 
continually in contact with fuel. For any Of the systems, 
however, it would not seem too good an idea to tank up with the 
alcohol blended fuel and then park the car for 30 days. The best 
recommendation would seem to be to use only the MTBE blended fuel 
if such a blend is available. The oil companies can individually 
choose whatever approved blend best suits their needs. 
Unfortunately, the indications are that at this time the oil 
companies will use only ethanol in our area. Washington State has 
had a law requiring the gas pump to indicate if the fuel contains 
alcohol, but it appears that only the oxygenation label will be 
required without defining what the blend consists of. It was 
hoped that at least one or two of the oil companies would offer 
an MTBE blended fuel for those of us who are concerned about the 
corrosion hazard of alcohol in a car that doesn't see daily use. 
At the moment it appears that avoidance of alcohol will require 
buying your fuel outside of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. 
We will continue to track this important issue and follow up with 
any new information that becomes available.

Kyle,

I didn't catch the beginning of this thread, but I know of a gas tank
sealer that I've personally used with good results, albeit on a motorcycle.
The stuff is called Kreem, and you should be able to find it at most
m/c shops.  You may need to get more than one; bike tanks are just a
wee bit smaller....  Anyway, it's basically a two step process.  Step 1
is some sort a acid/etc. which basically eats away rust and scale, and
will etch the surface.  The stuff gets drained, and then the coating
gets poured in.  Seemed to give good results, and I think it's pretty
stable stuff (I regularly use Trick and Daeco race gas, and
occasionally the  nitro-mix stuff).  The big problem may be sloshing
that stuff around a large tank though.

Subject: Re:  Rust-Free 356 Cab ?!

 ... where angels fear to tread.

CAUTION: If you find a mid 60's 356 Cab with NO rust, it is probably
not a Porsche, but rather some fiberglass replicar.

I do not want to discourage you, quite the contrary, but Porsche
"restoration" is generally not a several-weekend or seasonal task.
More like a lifetime hobby for most of us.  To give you a sense, I
picked up my wife-to-be for our first date in a 356 A, and felt
compelled to explain the condition of the car (ripped out interior, no
back seats, general disarray, etc.) and told her I was currently
restoring the car.  Well, we've been married over 20 years and I have
personally added a lot more padding and "upholstery" to my midsection
than has gone into the A.  Of course, I have done a lot of other
things, in the meantime.  Like get a 65 356 Cab; unfortunately, it
needs some interior work too . . .

I am not an expert in restoration; most of my Porsche work has involved
mechanical rebuilding, a subset of restoration that I particularly
enjoy. I've collected, and built, a lot of nifty special tools; I'm an
engineer.   But since there is little info on 356s on this BB, (there
aren't many 356s left, after all) I will put my two cents in.

As I said above, I doubt you will find a rust-free 60s cab, even a
bare, engine-less shell.  If you do, $15K probably won't buy it, but
maybe.  So be prepared for some rust and wear and tear; it is not
deadly and it can be repaired, if reasonable.  The best thing you could
do is join the PCA and get active in the local club and seek out the
small but friendly core of 356 owners.  Don't buy a car without having
one of them look it over for you.  In particular, get under it,
preferably on a rack, with a very bright light.  You should have a
strong stomache & eat lightly before doing this.

You should (just looking at some recent ads) be able to get a
reasonable, street-drivable 356 cab for your $10 -$15K.  It will be
presentable, but may have some dings, scruffy, if not fraying interior,
and yes, some rust.  All the parts should be present and accounted for,
although probably not original, and the engine should be reasonably
strong, with not too many miles, say 50K on a good rebuild.  Of course,
it will leak like a sieve in the rain, but that is an original feature
of cabs, part of the charm, and you're not supposed to drive old
Porsches in the rain anyway; certainly not restored ones.

How much time and $$ restoration will take does indeed depend on the
car, but even more on what YOU mean by "restore".  Return to an
attractive, clean, shiney, beauty that is great fun to drive and
attracts stares from the general public and ego-raising comments at the
gas pump, is quite feasable, fun, not incredibly expensive, and a nice
project of the approximate scale you mentioned-- given you seek out
help, and you don't live in the rural extremes where services are
scarce.  You can do most of it yourself, except for body work,
painting, etc, unless you are into that sort of thing.

If you mean restore to prize-competition level concourse original
condition, you are in for VERY big bucks and lots of time.  This is not
my field, but I would guess you would need another $60K or so,
typically; it usually takes several years, like 5, if you do it
yourself, meaning contract out the work yourself.  You can just ship
the hulk to various people who will do the whole thing for you, and
send you a big bill.  Of course, then it is not YOUR car or YOUR
restoration; this is usually done for investment purposes, and part of
the restoration service includes marketing the final product.
Naturally, you never get in or even touch such a car. (An exception is
occasionally made for naked young ladies of small build with dry,
clean, very soft skin and short nails.)  Forget driving it.  But it IS
beautiful; and I am glad there are some of these classics preserved
this way.

And there is a continuous range between these two.  But, as you can
probably tell, my preference is for something I am not afraid to drive;
well, not incredibly afraid to drive, on a nice day.  But forget
leaving it parked somewhere, except at a Porche event with supervised
parking!  A sad and unfortunate reality.

So, come on in; do indeed join the fun & keep the 356 faith. It IS
worth it.  But keep your eyes wide open, join the PCA and the 356
Registry, and GET HELP AND ADVICE.  We love to give it, and sometimes
it is even worth something.  In all cases it will be fun if you keep
the right perspective.

Can anyone offer any advice/experiences with K&N air filters,
particularly on 944/951s?  The advertisements in my catalogs (e.g.
Automotion, Performance Products) tout these filters very highly with
phrases like "... will dramatically increase your air flow resulting
in greater horsepower".  Somehow, I am having a hard time believing
that a different air filter would help my 951 breathe "dramatically"
better, but I try to keep an open mind.  Has anyone out there noticed
any real performance benefits from these filters "where the rubber
meets the road"?  How much of a hassle is it to clean these filters
well?  Although reusability seems like a nice idea in principle, I can
imagine missing the peace of mind that comes with knowing that *all*
the evil dirt accompanied the Purolator into the trash can.  Has there
been any independent verification of increased protection provided by
these filters?

Thanks,
Milo

K & N seems to result in about 10-15% more air flow, if cleaned and
oiled right.

If you don't mind using Evil CFC-powered Ultra Solvent stuff from K & N,
they just clean right up.... 

I use them because I can't stomach not using an air filter on the racers.

Subject: RE: K&N air filters

Milo, I've heard of positive tales of K&N filters, but usually on 
normally aspirated cars, and older ones at that.

One are to improve 951 breathing would be intake pipe cross section - 
the flat plastic induction tube between the air filter and L/F fender.  
It gets pretty narrow at the filter.  A friend with an '86 930 recently 
gutted the Porsche design and put in a simple, smaller K&N filter with 
far less ducting, etc. to restrict the airflow.  Since this was all 
done before fuel metering, etc. there is no loss due to induction 
resonance tuning damage.

Of course, in a forced-induction car, you already know the engine has 
all the air it needs; the only thing you can do is reduce the 
restriction to the turbo, which might give a 5% improvement in spool-up 
time.  Since the air's being force-fed to the manifold with a pump, you 
don't have to worry about the same problems as with a normally aspirated car.

The K&N is noticably louder than the stock paper filter, so stay
away from it if this will annoy you.  This is the only downside
to the K&N that I can think of...

You can use "Simple Green" to clean K&N air filters between oilings--works
great without CFCs.

Any experience with Dunlops out there?  Also I'm confused about

We haven't had much rain out here in awhile but I still want a tire

I've been real happy with the D40M2's on my 931, but since they are the only
tires I've had on the car (not counting some Pirelli snows), I can't really
give any valid comparisons to other popular brands.  I can tell you that for
the kind of semi-agressive street driving I do, they have never come up short.
Grip like crazy in the dry, and I've never had them break loose in the wet --
of course, I'm not dragging around the kind of weight you are in the back ;-)
They are very quiet dry or wet, probably due to the really funky tread design.
I haven't got enough miles on the car to get a feel for how they wear, but
again, because of the tread (it looks like a slick that someone added grooves
to as an afterthought) I wouldn't expect exceptionally long life.  Probably
not an issue for you, but one thing that they will _not_ tolerate is snow.
Not even a little.  Ever.  It's always amazed me that they can run so well in
the wet, and be so lethally slippery in the snow.

i recently had to put new tires on my 928, and i chose the d40m2, mainly
because of what i'd read, and the price was very competetive. so far,
i've been very pleased with them. they seem to steer well, and put power
down well. i haven't pushed them much, since the weather here has been
quite wet recently, and i haven't driven the car much due to the
not-very effective defroster, due to leaking heater core (no snickers
from the air-cooled folks out there, now! :-) :-) ). we (my tools and i)
attack at dawn on saturday! yeeeeee-ha!

All -

The car is an '87 944S with sport Koni's (if that makes a difference).  The
question is whether, with the shorter Weltmeister springs, it requires the
available spacers.  They're in there now; can I remove 'em?

I have a set of D40's (the DM40's I believe) that I use
for 'wet' track events (read: rain tires).  I picked these
up from a friend that was told from a tire dealer that
they 'were the best Hi Performance Tire you could
buy', and in fact, they are probably the best 'all around
tire', as evidenced from many tire tests.  My only
comment was that they are probably great 'all around
tires' but they ARE NOT Autocross tires!!!  Period.
He found this out after half a year of racing, always
getting beat by 1-2 seconds!  At mid-year, I sold him
one of my back-up sets of Yoko 008RS's (I'm a
contract driver for Yokohama).  He immediately went
out and beat the guy by 2 seconds, in his first event on
the tires!!!!  I told him they were much stickier than his
Dunlops, and now he agrees.  I must comment though,
that 008RS's make poor rain tires and probably worse
snow tire (little tread depth+40% of contact patch has
not tread at all= <scarry & slippery>; I don't run my
911 in the winter, as its heat system <'72 911> sucks!).

The Dunlop's are, however, very good 'all around' tires
and the 'Hi Performance' DM40's do really well in the
rain and offer predictable 'feel' at their limits.  I must
add that I am going to replace these with BFG R1 204
compound (road race) tires, as these REALLY stick
well in the rain- BIG TIME!!!! (see previous posting
from Mr Wizard) and they wear rather well.

>Any experience with Dunlops out there?  Also I'm
>confused about A008P's, new or old technology?

The Yoko A008P's are a fairly sophisticated tire for use
on Porsches.  I've driven them and do not really think
they are not all that special (I feel marketing types got
involved in this one!!!).  Their compound is not very soft
but is supposed to be 'sticky in adverse conditions'(This
again is marketing, IMHO).  I talking with the YOKO high
performance tire rep's, this is basiclly an old 008R tire
construction with a new tread pattern and 'new' compound
(which again is a marketing ploy, IMHO).

I would recommend the Goodyear GSC's for all around
driving on the street and for bad weather conditions.
They work great in both dry and wet conditions, but
are a little spendy. They are very trick tires!!

Hope this helps!

Good'ay,

Mr Wizard

I was under the impression that the A008P was a remarketing (possibly
with small modifications) of the original A008 (non-R). Do you have
information indicating it is similar to the old A008R, or was that
a typo? The A008R was of course the first of the "pseudo-race" tires
in the A008 series (the A001R came first), and was, as I understand it,
not seriously proposed as a day-to-day street tire, although you could
use it as a "dual use" tire, with autocross/track use and street use.
By contrast, the A008 (non-R) was originally marketed as a high
performance street tire.

A008P's are basically A008's with a little tweaking for Porsches - no 
big deal.  Their design is a few years old, but they ought to be OK.  I 
don't know anyone using them.

The base D40's are not loved.  Several people who've owned them tell me 
they hated them, especially in cold weather.  However, D40 M2's are 
considerably better.  I believe they are reasonable in the wet, too.

My mentor- Dwight Michell (ASP 911)- help me out on
this one.  I have learned much from him, especially how
to drive at my best, and this is to 'know the course so
you can drive it with your eyes closed', and thats
exactly what he does (and I try it too!).  Even in our
local event (usually very simple, brain dead courses), I
always try to walk it at least 8-10 times.  After 1-2
times, I then draw out the course- not how others tell
me, but how 'I' understand it- and note any changes in
surface conditons (off camber, loose patch, grooves,
etc).  Then I try to mark , both on my map AND in my
brain, the apex cones that I need to hit.  After that, I try
not to think which gear I'll be in- it never works out that
you estimate exactly what gear/speed you'll be at- so I
don't over-load my limited internal based DRAM (what
little brain cells I have left after college/engineering
school!).  When I'm in the line dup before the start, I
run through the course visually and mentally.  Dwight
impressed on me that if you have to thing about were
you need to put your car as you approach the corner, it's
to late!!  You should already be focusing on the next
corner (this is a technique that I used went I road raced
many years ago- and had forgot how to do!!).  I also try
to puch the car as hard as I can, not being conservative
on my first run.  This will allow you to gauge where
you can- and cannot- push it harder.  My first timed run
means little- I try to set fast time (a mind game I learned
from Russ Whiles when I raced against him in Salina in
'91) on my first run- even if its dirty, the raw time is
what plays mind games with the competition.  Also, to
many times people think they went as fast as they could
in all their runs, only to find they drop 1-2 secind of
during comp runs at the end of the day!  Go hard the
first run and get that much more of a jump on the
learning curve of the course.

I'd better stop here, giving up to much info......

Anyways, I personelly feel that walking the course is
VERY important.  Any comments from any other
drivers out there?

Subject: 1993 968

Here's more info from PCNA. (Next week you get the last  
installment, the 928 GTS.)

Bob Pentecost bpenteco@hpbs987.boi.hp.com 
=================================================================

                    1993 Porsche 968

The latest addition to Porsche's family of sports cars is 
the 968. Introduced as a l992 model,  the 968 is the most 
affordable Porsche, delivering the firm's benchmark agility, 
balance and  traditional design philosophy at a price 
competitive in its market segment. Although the 968  has 
only been available since November 1991, it has already 
garnered notable commendations,  including an Automobile 
All-Star award from the editors of Automobile Magazine.

The 968 is available as a Coupe or Cabriolet, equipped with 
a standard five-speed transmission  or the option of 
Porsche's unique Tiptronic automatic transmission.

Like all 1993 Porsches, the 1993 968 model benefits from 
several evolutionary changes:

	-- CFC-free air conditioning
 	-- new brake fluid with greater resistance to fading
	-- new rear stereo speakers
	-- recycling labels for plastic containers

In addition, the 1993 968 coupe is available with the 
optional M 030 sport suspension package.

 ENGINE

The powerplant of the 968 benefits from extensive 
engineering changes. The 968 has the  highest torque of any 
normally aspirated three-liter engine in production today.

Porsche's goals in developing the 968 powerplant were to 
develop the highest possible power  output in the market 
segment, without increasing engine size, and to develop the 
highest  possible torque at low engine speed.

Key among the changes to meet these goals is Porsche's 
VarioCam(TM) system of variable  valve timing. VarioCam uses 
a timing piston, controlled by the Bosch Motronic engine  
management system, placed between the two sides of the 
timing chain between the intake and  exhaust cams. When 
actuated, the piston shifts the timing of the intake cam by 
15 crankshaft  degrees (7 1/2 camshaft degrees). Earlier 
valve timing results in more valve overlap and  earlier 
closing. This timing results in more engine torque. At high 
engine speed, the piston is  shifted back to its late timing 
position, for high power. The net effect of the VarioCam is 
to  give the 968 engine a broader, flatter torque curve. 
Torque increases by 7 to 18 percent  compared to an engine 
without VarioCam.

In addition to better engine performance, VarioCam brings 
significant reductions in exhaust  emissions. At low speeds 
and idle, the late intake cam timing results in small valve 
overlap  and a reduction in hydrocarbon emissions. At low 
loads and moderate engine speeds, early  timing and large 
valve overlap gives a form of built-in exhaust gas 
recirculation, which  significantly reduces NOx emissions. 
Because the engine exhaust is cleaner even before it  
reaches the catalyst, cold-start emissions before the 
converter heats up are also reduced.

Like all 1993 Porsches the 968 is fitted with a resonance 
induction system. The dual-path  plenum uses a bypass tube 
which results in a supercharging effect which increases 
engine  output in the range between 4000 and 6400 rpm.

The exhaust system has also been reworked. To ensure optimum 
efficiency of the metal  monolith three-way catalytic 
converter, the exhaust passage was optimized to give a more  
uniform gas flow distribution into the converter.

The 968 develops 236 horsepower at 6200 rpm and 225 ft.-lbs. 
of torque at 4100 rpm. EPA  fuel economy is an impressive 17 
mpg city, 26 mpg highway (the optional Tiptronic fuel  
economy is 16/25 mpg).

 PERFORMANCE

The 968 delivers pure Porsche performance at a competitive 
price. Acceleration to 60 mph  takes only 6.3 seconds with 
the manual transmission, 7.7 seconds with the Tiptronic. Top  
track speed is 156 mph with the six-speed, 153 mph with 
Tiptronic.

The perfect balance achieved by Porsche's front engine/rear 
transaxle layout, shared with the  Porsche 928 GTS, gives 
the 968 responsive handling with high cornering limits, 
without the  harshness often associated with "sport 
suspensions". The 968 combines very high cornering  grip 
with comfortable cruising capability.

TRANSMISSION

The 968 is fitted with a six-speed manual transmission as 
standard equipment. Although the  broad, flat torque curve 
of the 968 would be well-suited to a conventional five-speed  
transmission, Porsche's choice of an extra gear ratio brings 
benefits in acceleration  performance as well as fuel 
economy and exhaust emissions at cruising speeds. The lower  
gears are spaced like those of a five-speed, for good 
acceleration and low-speed response. The  closely spaced top 
three gear ratios allow low engine speeds at cruise. 
Combined with  VarioCam, this results in fuel economy and 
exhaust emissions benefits.

The 968 is available with Porsche's unique Tiptronic 
transmission, the most sophisticated  automatic transmission 
presently available in the automobile industry. The 
Tiptronic offers  Porsche drivers an even wider choice of 
driving styles: the transmission can be left in "Drive"  
like a conventional automatic, or the driver can move the 
lever to a special gate and manually  go up and down through 
the gears by "tipping" the lever forward or backward.

Even in its full automatic mode, the Tiptronic displays 
capabilities unmatched by any other  automatic transmission 
on the market today. It can virtually sense the driver's 
needs, avoiding  unwanted up- or downshifts which detract 
from sporty driving with conventional automatics.  This is 
made possible by five distinct shift programs ranging from 
sport to economy (other  automatic transmissions offer two, 
or at best three, driver-selected shift modes), additional  
sensors, and adaptive logic in its control unit. There is no 
separate switch to select a shift  mode; the system actively 
determines which of the five available shift maps to use. 
The control  unit senses how the car is being driven and 
responds accordingly.

If the shift lever is moved straight over to the right from 
its "Drive" position, the transmission  goes into its manual 
mode; the Tiptronic shifts up on driver demand or 
automatically when  engine speed reaches the optimum point 
on the torque curve, whichever occurs first.  Conversely, if 
the driver requests a downshift that would result in over-
revving, the Tiptronic  defers the shift until speed has 
decreased appropriately.

The Tiptronic gives away only a small performance margin to 
the six-speed, but offers in  return greater comfort in 
congested driving conditions while still enabling the 
traditional sports  car enjoyment of going through the 
gears. Because it is less dependent on individual drivers'  
styles with clutch and shift lever, Tiptronic lends itself 
to an effective exhaust emissions  reduction strategy, and 
allows better control of fuel consumption and noise 
emissions.

 SUSPENSION

The 968 front suspension consists of MacPherson struts with 
aluminum alloy lower control  arms and a 26.8 mm stabilizer 
bar. Aluminum alloy semi-trailing arms, 16 mm stabilizer 
bar,  and springing via transverse torsion arms make up the 
rear suspension.

For 1993, 968 buyers can order the optional M 030 sport 
suspension package. At the front,  this consists of variable 
height spring struts, 30 mm tubular stabilizer bar, shock 
absorbers  adjustable for rebound damping, larger, thicker 
brake rotors and larger pistons, larger, wider  wheels and 
tires. At the rear, additional barrel-type springs are 
fitted over the shock absorbers,  the shocks are also 
adjustable for rebound damping, a 20 mm stabilizer bar is 
fitted, and  wheels and tires are larger and wider than 
standard.

 BRAKES

The 968, like the 911 and 928, is equipped with high-
performance ventilated disc brakes front  and rear. Anti-
lock brakes (ABS) are standard equipment on all 1993 
Porsches.

The optional M 030 sport suspension package adds larger 
11.97 inch (304 mm) front brake  rotors, 1.26 inches (32 mm) 
thick, to replace the standard 11.73 x 1.1 0 inch (298 x 28 
mm)  rotors. Front brake pistons are increased in size to 44 
and 36 mm (compared to 40 and 36  mm).

 SPECIAL OPTIONS AND EUROPEAN DELIVERY

Porsche owners who would like to further personalize their 
cars can take advantage of  Porsche's special options. 
Porsche offers a wide range of special order items to make 
each car  uniquely individual. These include paintwork to 
match any sample color and leather to  duplicate any sample 
shade. Virtually every interior item may be ordered with 
factory-applied  leather trim.

Every Porsche may be ordered through U.S. dealers for 
European delivery. The European  delivery program offers an 
unforgettable driving experience, in one's own personal car 
on the  high-speed motorways and scenic, winding secondary 
roads from which Porsche's legendary  road-going sports cars 
are bred.

PORSCHE, SPORTS CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Porsche is not only a leader in high technology and high 
performance, but is also an industry  leader in 
environmental responsibility. This begins with building cars 
to last. Of all the  Porsches built since 1948, it is 
estimated that fully 80 percent are still in service.

Part of that longevity comes from the fully galvanized 
bodywork of the Porsche 911. Porsche  pioneered the use of 
two-sided galvanized body panels in 1976. Since then, 
experience has  shown the effectiveness of the fully 
galvanized bodywork and other rust preventive measures.  
Porsche can now warranty every new Porsche for ten years 
against rust perforation. The  solidity of the bodywork has 
been a factor in maintaining Porsche's traditionally high 
resale  values.

If and when a Porsche reaches the end of its useful life and 
is recycled, labeling of various  plastic components will 
make it easier to reprocess the parts. Labeling will help to 
put plastics  back into consumer products, not in landfills.

Despite their high performance, Porsche cars are among the 
cleanest on the road. Highly  effective three-way catalytic 
converters, oxygen sensors, and engine management systems 
have  long been a part of the Porsche pedigree. All Porsche 
models are equipped with systems that  fulfill the most 
stringent exhaust standards worldwide.

Growing concern about the possible effects of 
chlorofluorocarbons, including the CFC-12  refrigerants used 
in automotive air conditioning systems, on the earth's ozone 
layer, has led  Porsche to introduce a CFC-free refrigerant, 
HFC-134a, on all of its 1993 models. The entire  air 
conditioning system had to be redesigned to use the new 
refrigerant. The higher cost of  HFC-134a, and its higher 
salvage value, also provide a monetary recycling incentive 
for repair  shops.

PASSIVE SAFETY

The agility, precise handling and high power of Porsche 
sports cars places them among the  world's best cars in 
terms of active safety. Passive safety is also a prime 
consideration at  Porsche. In 1990, Porsche was the world's 
first auto manufacturer to equip every car sold in  the 
United States with driver and front passenger airbags as 
standard equipment.

WARRANTY

Thanks to decades of experience building solid, durable 
high-performance cars, Porsche's  warranty coverage is among 
the broadest of any sports car manufacturer. Each Porsche is  
covered by a two-year new vehicle warranty with unlimited 
mileage, and includes the Porsche  ASSIST (TM) roadside 
assistance program (pending approval for vehicles sold in 
California).  The fully galvanized body and 26-step paint 
and anti-corrosion process enable Porsche to  warranty each 
car for ten years and unlimited mileage against rust 
perforation, protection  unmatched by any other sports car 
maker. In addition, the paintwork carries a three-year  
limited warranty.

If I may add my $.02 worth...I ran D40M2s on my 944 at Mid Ohio this

The tires were incredible in the rain.

When I wore them out, I bought another set.

Subject: Re: 944 series springs

I forgot to mention/ask a couple of things in my original posting.  First off,
does anyone understand how one converts or compares Porsche's spring rates with,
for example, Weltmeisters?  I can't get the math to make sense.  For example, my
original springs are rated by Porsche at 21.8 N/mm.  If I do the math,

  21.8 N/mm x 0.225 lbf/N x 25.4 mm/in => 123 lbf/in

This is way out of kilter with the ratings of Weltmeister springs, as 220
lbf/in, which are not that stiffer (it seems) than the OEM springs.  Moreover,
the M030 options springs from Porsche are rated at all of 28.0 N/mm, which works
out to 160 lbf/in, again way low.

The other thing I would mention is the wide-ish range of spring heights used in
different factory suspension packages, all the way from 407 mm for the non-sport
944S suspension to 329 mm used in the M030 sport package.  I assume that the
M030 includes struts with adjustable perches - is this the case?

I'm trying to figure out how low I can go without rubbing, etc.  Obviously.  Any
help appreciated.

I replaced the standard lamps on the 931 with some Hella H-4 units.
Does anybody have any good alignment techniques for this type of lamp?
The improvement is so great, I can't seem to find the best position.
Out of alignment (too low, not high) they are better than the halogen
sealed beams.  The Haynes manual is of no help.  Being illegal, I doubt
they will be able to do anything with them at the local "California
Certified Alignment Station" down the street.

The problem is the shape of the beam.  There's a focused area
out of each lamp that is brighter and sort of diamond shaped, directed
away from the oncoming traffic.  What is the best way to direct this?
I have tried the trial and error method, but I feel there must be a
better way.

Subject: Re:  944 series springs (sorry about the garbage last time)

I apologize for the gibberish you all received as my last reply--my  
NeXT computer decided to send the mail out in its own "rich" text  
format without my knowledge.

Kevin asked about springs for a 944S.  I have a couple of comments,  
which are my opinions based on experience preparing a 944 race car  
for SCCA's Improved Touring class.  Suspension modifications interest  
me a great deal since there's very little you can do to the engine in  
IT and many modifications to the suspension _are_ allowed.

First of all, I would not purchase Weltmeister components, including  
their springs.  I have not been impressed with the design nor with  
the quality.  Springs need to be cold-wound from chrome-silicon steel  
wire, heat-treated and shot-peened.  The finish and QC in  
manufacturing is important:  cheap springs (under the paint) have a  
poor finish with dings, scratches, fabrication marks, and other  
stress raisers.  They sometimes are not heat-treated, and are rarely  
shot-peened.  Anyone, including the local shop, can wind a spring for  
you.  However, the punishment a coil spring takes in track use  
requires a reputable manufacturer who has designed and tested springs  
specifically for race application, and who is knowledgable about  
materials, fatigue life, stress concentrations, etc.  Rockwell and  
Eibach are the two I would trust; I have Eibach springs on my race  
car (available in a nearly infinite variety from Truesports at 800  
388-8783).

Selecting the correct spring is simple in concept, a little harder in  
practice.  


You first have to decide what spring rate you need.  Porsche's stock  
spring rates for the 944 are relatively soft (compared, say, to a  
911), their M030 optional sport suspension slightly stiffer.  Kevin's  
conversion from N/mm to lb/in is correct:  the rates range from 120  
lb/in to 160 lb/in.  Remember, these rates are only low compared to  
after-market springs--Porsche has to sell a car, even with the sport  
suspension, that will mostly appeal to people who do not track their  
car.  My race car currently has 325 lb/in springs on the front and I  
will probably be trying spring rates in excess of 400 lb/in next year  
on smooth tracks like NHIS.  I believe the rates for the Club Sport  
944S2 that dominated the Firehawk series were even stiffer.  Sedans  
in the German Touring Car Championship--at car weights of 2700 lbs or  
so--regularly run rates over 1000 lb/in, though these are full-blown  
race cars, and their tracks are billiard-table smooth compared to the  
typical tracks in this country.

However, even the 325 lb/in springs on my race car would be too stiff  
to be bearable on the street, especially around Boston.  Like  
everything else concerning a street car that is driven on the track,  
you have to make a decision about handling versus comfort.  I would  
imagine that the 200 lb/in Weltmeister are a reasonable compromise,  
if anything perhaps a little stiff for a street car.

Once you've decided on a spring rate you need to determine the static  
loading on each corner to figure ride height.  The threaded  
adjustable spring perches from the M030 option make this  
determination much less critical, but basically require changing  
front struts.  The calculation is straightforward:  calculate corner  
weight with your current springs by measuring deflection between  
unloaded and fully loaded and multiplying by spring rate, figure the  
deflection of your new springs under that load, and the difference in  
deflections will be the desired difference in the free length of the  
two springs.  You also have to look at compressed length (solid  
height) of the spring to determine if you are going to lose wheel  
travel--or if you will add wheel travel and have clearance problems.   
Ideally, there will be a spring which is perfect in all respects.

Of course, Automotion doesn't provide you with the information you  
need to do these calculations, they just tell you that these springs  
will lower your car 1.25 inches, and that owners of certain cars  
(including yours, I believe, Kevin) require additional spacers.  You  
_could_ just trust them.

If you stiffen the front end, the rear needs to also be stiffened, or  
you will worsen the already understeerish nature of the 944.  And  
rear torsion bars, especially good ones (Sway-a-Way) are expensive  
and a pain to install and adjust.  You could compensate for the  
imbalance by adjustable anti-roll bars, but it's better to have the  
car basically balanced even without anti-roll bars, then use the bars  
to add roll stiffness and fine-tune the handling.  You will probably  
also need harder or adjustable shocks to correctly dampen the higher  
spring rates.

If your goal is improved handling for your 944 for track events, but  
you want to maintain the car as a daily driver, I would recommend (in  
this order):

1.  Lowering the car to Euro specs (for the front, I think that  
simply means removing the spring spacer on your car, Kevin).
2.  Buying a set of wheels for the track, preferably the largest that  
will fit under the fenders, with some sticky R compound tires.
3.  Adding adjustable anti-roll bars.
4.  Replacing all the rubber in the suspension (and there's a lot of  
it) with solid bushings or bearings.
5.  Replacing the rubber bushing at the top of the front strut with a  
spherical bearing and adding a camber truss between.
6.  Going to stiffer springs at the front and stiffer torsion bars at  
the rear.

Each one of these steps (except perhaps the first) will compromise  
street comfort for track handling.  The 944 is a great street car,  
and can be a great track car as well.  It's hard to make it both.

I'd be glad to express my opinion in more detail if anyone is  
interested.

Subject: fitting 911 suspension to 914


 I believe that I have all the parts that I need now to fit a 911
 suspension to my 914. I've got 911S struts with Koni inserts,
 S model alloy calipers, new front brake discs, rear conversion to
 5 bolt hubs, set of 6x15 alloy Fuchs. 

 Am I missing anything? I've been told that the rear conversion is
 trivial (new hubs) and 6x15"s should fit under the stock fenders
 (yes, I'm using a 1/4" spacer to maintain the backspacing.

 I have two questions:

     1) the rear hubs I just bought have been drilled and fit with
        pressed-in studs. However, they didn't use a 1970 hub (with
        the reinforced areas) and the studs are set in the un-reinforced
        area of the hubs. It appears to be pretty thin (maybe 1/8-3/16)
        and this worries me. Anyone have any experience with this conversion?

     2) I'm told that fitting the 911 struts in the front is just a bolt-in.
        If this is the case, do I have to worry about clearing either the
        front or rear fenders (using A403 195/50VR15s on 6x15 Fuchs)? I
        would like to be able to drive the car to the body shop ... :->.

OK, this makes a lot of sense.  I assume we're talking about worst-case moving
100% of the vehicle weight to one side.  (Is it also correct that cornering
forces do not add additional vertical loading of the springs?  With correct
camber.)  So split 1300 kg roughly 50% front to rear: 650 kg on the front
spring.  Is this the right path to follow?

Sure, I could.  My questions are in part motivated by the fact that they're
selling a single part for a car which has had quite a variety of different
suspension pieces.  If I can get an extra 1.25", or even .5", so much the
better.  "Weight is the enemy" - Colin Chapman.  "Weight transfer ain't exactly

Absolutely.  I have the factory Koni sports, rears set to full stiff, fronts
set to 50%.  Rear Weltmeister bars are also set to full stiff, and I adjust
the front bars to tune.  With the 200 lbf springs, this set-up was, I admit, a
guess.  Turns out to work extremely well; I was lucky.

Are the Sway-a-Way's available for 944 series cars?  From whom?  What size are
you using?

Subject: RE: H4 Headlight Alignment

Lacking an alignment machine, I aim Euro headlights (low beam) to hit 
the ground roughly 75' in front of the car, with a full tank of gas.  
It's an iterative process - I start by carefully aiming at a flat 
cement wall (some kind of building or loading dock).  Then drive around 
and check the height versus American sedan trunk lids.  You can tell 
pretty easily if you're too high - you'll keep bouncing into the 
sedan's passenger compartment (well, the light beams will).  The beam 
should rarely, if ever, go higher than an oncoming car's hood.  Euro 
lights are nasty when they flash up into an oncoming driver's eyes!

Sorry if this is a bit vague, but it's some experimentation will yield 
good results.  Ideally, your high beams will punch straight ahead and 
parallel, and the low beams will fall into place naturally.

I've found the techniques of aiming at your garage wall and chalking 
the lines to be an effective start, but the final tuning comes on the road.

I'm interested in doing some trimming to my car as well. It is the
same car as Kevin's (87 944S), but is a different color (I hope that
won't affect the springs. :-) ). My car is currently off-the-showroom-
floor stock, unlike Kevin's, except for tires.

I think you are trying to get the static ride height correct, so you
don't want to assume "100% weight transfer". For a starting spot,
assume half of the front weight on each front wheel, same for the back.
If you have had your car weight-balanced, you presumably have the real
weights.

By the way, cornering forces do add vertical loading on the springs.
This is what causes "lean". Think of it as a statics problem, and
consider the moments. The cornering force is exerted at the road,
but the centrifugal force is at the car's center of gravity. This
pair of non-coincident forces introduces a moment (look at it like a
torque) which must be compensated. The compensating moment comes from
different vertical loads on the left and right springs, with the
force on each spring (one up and one down) times the car's track
equaling the cornering force times the distance from the road to the
car's center of gravity.
This is "weight transfer", and this view makes it clear why nothing
but lowering the center of gravity or widening the track will reduce
the weight transferred.

Automotion claims that initially, a stiffer front (bar or springs) in
a 944 reduces understeer, contrary to theory, since the MacPherson
strut suspension has such lousy height-camber characteristics that
reducing roll helps the front stick better, despite the additional
weight transfer. Nathan: do you or anybody else have any insights here?
Automotion's explanation makes some sense, but I does anyone have
experimental verification?

>Are the Sway-a-Way's available for 944 series cars?  From whom?  What size are

There are lots of rear torsion bar choices. Sway-Away has 25 mm and 26 mm,
if you want something in-between, a 944 Turbo-S rear torsion bar is
25.5 mm, and fits our cars (I have a friend who put them in an 86
944 Turbo). The trick is knowing what you want, without trying them all.

Nathan: did most of the US 944 series have a front spring spacer to
meet the height requirements? I wasn't aware of that. Do you (or does
anyone else) know how thick the spacer is? I don't remember seeing the
spacer on the parts fische (but it is at home).

My goals are perhaps different than Kevin's. I am trying to keep
the car nearer stock, and relatively comfortable for the street
(that's what happens when you get old). I am trying to stiffen it
just a bit, with one significant objective being to reduce roll
enough to not scrub the edge off the LF tire, or at least not as
badly, on the track (PCA events). Basically, I am after the elusive
"dual use" car which Nathan accurately says is hard to achieve.
My saving grace (I hope) is that I'm not looking for a race winner
in the track, but a fun car to drive.

Gary,

I know exactly what you mean about the improvement being so great. I've
used the lights for 10 years and won't go back. From my experience, the H4
light pattern can be divided into the left half and the right half. The
left half should be perfectly flat and the right half angles up and to the
right (at about a 20 deg. angle???). The "center" of the beam is where the
right half just starts to angle up.

I usually try to find a nice flat surface in front of a wall. Three things
are important to adjust:

        1) The left half of the beam should be level with (or very slightly
lower than) the headlight. Driving forward and backward in front of the
wall should not cause the left half (of both lights) to raise or lower in
height. The two lights should be exactly the same height as each other.

        2) The centers of the beams, as they appear on the wall, should be
the same distance apart as the centers of the lights. I've found that a
second person with a measuring tape in front of the wall is helpful here.
The driver should direct the measurement spots. Also, the car should not be
further than 20-25 feet from the wall for this.

        3) The centers of the beams should not move left or right as you
drive forward and backward in front of the wall. You might also use the
high beams to double-check this (and the previous) adjustment.

Of course, the final test is to drive the car on a straight and very dark
road. Here, the high beams should travel down the road parallel to each
other and illuminate it "nicely." With low beams correctly adjusted, on any
flat road, you should never be bothering oncoming drivers. On roads with
dips you will be bothering drivers as your lights go high while the other
driver is low. This is unavoidable.

Hope this helps.

If this isn't an option (it isn't for me), and you _really_ want to be
confident about not sliding your baby into a snowbank, take a look at a set
of Pirelli 210P's.  They're H-rated with a true M+S tread (unidirectional).
I reluctantly shod the 931 with these a few weeks ago, expecting the worst, but
surprise -- besides handling a few snowy days with no problems, they're really
very good in the dry too.  They've got a bit more sidewall flex than I'm used
to, but still stick well in the corners.  The real surprise for me though, is
that they're very quiet.

turbo lag is much more pronounced. I haven't decided whether this is
just because I've been driving the car for so long with low boost, or if
the lag really is worse than it used to be...  I drove at Talledega last
week and it was really challenging trying to keep the lag from breaking
the wheels loose at the track out of certain corners...  Oh well: Rd.

Bill and Jim,

As Jim has described, the hot start problem is very likely caused by this
anti-backflow valve (in or next to the electric fuel pump). On my '77 911S
I had this exact problem with the same symptoms. On the '77, though, the
valve was part of the pump and the whole thing needed to be replaced - A
more expensive solution!

The cold start problem could be one of two things:

        1) If all you need is some extra gas to keep the 911 running and
the idle speed seems to be the same all the time, then your "Auxiliary Air
Valve" is probably bad (This may also be called a "Cold Start Valve" - not
to be confused with the "Cold Start Injector" which is something completely
different and seems to be working fine on your car). The Auxiliary Air
Valve is supposed to increase your idle speed when the engine is cold.

        2) On my '77 911S I also had a problem with the warm up regulator.
I bought the car with a bad warm up regulator that had caused the car to
backfire on starting and subsequently blow the air box. (With a bad
regulator the car will be very difficult to start and run at all!) Once I
replaced the warm-up regulator (and air box), it never seemed to run
correctly throughout the 2 minute warm-up period. This is another problem
with warm-up regulators. You can modify their behavior by tapping in or out
a plug that anchors a bi-metallic spring. (This is documented in an
"Up-Fixin" article.) I did this but would get the car to run correctly for
the first 30 seconds and not the next 1.5 minutes or visa-versa. Never the
entire 2 minutes - Very frustrating! I just lived with it. Could be that
removing the heat exchangers and adding SSI exhaust on the car changed its
warm-up characteristics and caused this.

Hope this helps.

Frank:I think you are trying to get the static ride height correct, so you
don't want to assume "100% weight transfer". For a starting spot,
assume half of the front weight on each front wheel, same for the back.
If you have had your car weight-balanced, you presumably have the real
weights.

I believe Kevin's 100% is for the weight transfer from cornering, assuming the
car is lifting both inside wheels. In equilibrium conditions, there can't be
any additional vertical loading.

There is also another confusion. You can't get the deflection (at the wheel) by
taking the load and dividing by the spring rate, since there is some mechanical
advantage involved. If the wheel rises by 1", the spring probably shortens
by slightly less, because it is mounted slightly inboard of the center line
of the wheel. Probably fairly close to 1 for MacPherson struts, though.

Unless the coils are heat-treated, wouldn't it be very fair simple to
just tack weld the "dead coils" together?  Then, you wouldn't affect
ride height or handling, and the coils won't rub together.  It's
certainly less expensive than a new set of springs (although X-mas is

[End of excerpt from Mike Lee - Team Banana Racing]

I also suffer from the rubbing-front spring phenom... I have 250lbs
springs in front, and they lowered the car about 1.5"'s, though it
doesn't show much because my 84 944 had settled a bit. 

The grinding noises are very disconcerting - any sort of hard cornering on
an uneven surface, hard braking as mentioned above, or other movement
brings a "scrunch" from the front of the car. Before I figured out what
it was I was scared silly that the vehicle was about to come apart! :-(

It is is possible to weld the dead coils, I would like to hear about
it...

I assumed that is what Kevin meant as well (I assume we'll be hearing from
Kevin momentarily). However, I have two problems with it. First, one
picks unloaded spring length (Nathan's original topic) to get the static
ride height correct. The spring constant (stiffness) then determines
the additional displacement (lean) from weight transfer during cornering,
along with the sway bar stiffness, if there is one (or two).
Second, you can't get 100% weight transfer in steady-state cornering,
unless you can generate well over 1g lateral acceleration or your CG height
is more than about 1/2 your track (try the moment analysis). You can lift a
wheel at one end (a more complicated analysis), but you can't unload
both inside wheels completely. This is a fortunate result, since otherwise
cars would roll very easily at maximum cornering (the CG rises quickly
as the inside wheels lift, increasing the moment, etc.)

Agreed, although, as you suggest, the error is probably small for
MacPherson struts. Actually, didn't Nathan suggest measuring spring
rather than wheel displacements? I don't have his original article
handy. In any case, the larger error is that many springs don't have very
linear spring constants near their unloaded length, so in effect using
them as a scale to weigh the car is relatively inaccurate. I would
expect the total weight and front/rear ratio in the manual to be
more accurate in general.

about 5 minutes front and rear.

The wheels/tires fill up the wheel wells quite nicely. With the

ride height I have to be more carefull with driveways, but what
a small price to pay for the lower center of gravity.

Subject: 944 (or any car) springs and suspension mods--very long


Okay, I guess I didn't explain myself very clearly in a couple of  
places, so I'll elucidate, and answer a couple of other questions  
raised.


First of all, regarding spring deflection and ride height, I was  
trying to describe a procedure for determining the right spring to  
replace an existing spring, and how to determine what ride height  
changes, if any, will result.  The procedure is as follows:

1.  Measure the compressed length of the spring with the car at rest  
on all four wheels--the flatter the surface the better.  Call this  
length Lc.
2.  Now measure the length of the spring with no load on it at all  
(the so-called "free length") and call this Lf.
3.  Find the spring constant, k, of your springs from the factory  
manual.  This is given in N/mm, which you'll want to convert to lb/in  
by multiplying by 5.7.
4.  We'll call quantity Lf - Lc = x, the deflection of the spring.   
Multiply k*x to get the compressed load on the spring, in lbs, which  
we'll call F.  Because, as Michael Todd pointed out, the MacPherson  
strut suspension has a small mechanical advantage, F _does not_  
exactly correspond to the weight on that wheel.  It doesn't matter  
for our purposes.
5.  Now decide what new spring rate you'd like on the front and call  
this k'.  The deflection of this spring under load F will be x' =  
F/k', and if you're putting stiffer springs in, x' < x.
6.  If you want to keep the ride height the same, then a new spring  
with a free length Lf' = Lc + x' would give you this.  If you want to  
raise or lower the car, add or subtract from Lf'.

This method is subject to some error, mainly caused by the difficulty  
in accurately measuring the spring lengths, but will get you quite  
close.  Obviously, adjustable spring perches would make this less  
critical, but still a good exercise.

Clearance or bottoming problems could occur if the compressed length  
of the new springs (sometimes called "solid height") is different  
from the old (it will almost certainly be smaller).  You just have to  
make sure that whatever bump stop method you are using will work.   
Compressed lengths are given for new springs (usually) and can be  
calculated by measuring the wire diameter by the number of coils.


I have some personal experience with failure in Weltmeister  
components, though they have all been of minor consequence:  broken  
drop links, defective bushings, etc.  I haven't been impressed with  
the quality control of those items I've seen, nor with the stresses  
placed on some components by their design.  


A response to this list which talked about the obnoxious noise of  
coils rubbing against each other in a Weltmeister spring really  
scared me:  if the spring designer meant that to happen, he should be  
shot; if he didn't, the fabricator should be.  I wouldn't drive  
another mile in a car in that condition.  Coil springs are  
essentially very long torsion bars that have a convenient shape.  The  
wire is most highly stressed at the surface, which is why  
shot-peening--a process that hardens and strengthens the surface  
layer of a material--is so important for springs.  But _any_ surface  
irregularity, scratch, or ding can raise the stress in that area and  
provides the perfect place for a fracture to begin.  Coils rubbing  
against each other are a bad idea, even if they aren't doing anything  
but spacing the car up.  Mike Lee suggested welding the coils  
together if they weren't heat-treated.  I wouldn't recommend it,  
especially since they almost certainly are heat-treated.

If they aren't too much money (I haven't checked) Porsche does have  
some stiffer springs that came with its sport suspension.  They also  
have Club Sport and Turbo Cup suspension components, which are big  
money.


I'm planning on designing some suspension components for my race car  
over the winter, including spherical bearings for the top of the  
strut mounting, new solid bushings and bearings, and a new design for  
a camber truss between the shock towers.  If anyone else is  
interested (Kevin?) I could have more than one set made up, which  
would reduce my cost as well.  They will probably also eventually  
(after I've had a chance to test them) be sold through Sports Imports  
of Cape Cod, sponsors of my racing effort.


In another response, Frank correctly explains the mechanics of weight  
transfer under steady state cornering.  I actually might believe what  
Automotion says about the 200 lb springs _reducing_ understeer,  
though I have no direct experience with stock torsion bars on the  
rear and stiffer springs on the front.  With sticky tires there  
probably is enough weight transfer to put the stock springs into the  
messy part of the MacPherson strut deflection/camber curve.  Has  
anyone tried this?

This raises an interesting point.  Race cars with stock suspension  
geometry actually run much stiffer spring rates than would be optimum  
for a car with a racing suspension, just because camber change  
becomes a real problem as you deflect the suspension.  One other  
advantage of stiff springs on a heavy sports car is the improvement  
in transient response, that is, they tend to enter and exit corners  
better, and reduction of dive and squat from braking and  
acceleration.

The ideal suspension would have spring rates just high enough to  
prevent bottoming, use shocks to control transient response, have  
anti-roll bars which control roll stiffness, and have anti-dive and  
anti-squat built into the suspension geometry.  Unfortunately, no one  
has been able to design a suspension like this yet, though this years  
Williams-Renault is obtaining the same result through another path.

I would add one thing to Frank's discussion of weight transfer.   
Anti-roll bars essentially add a spring (with an adjustable rate in  
the case of adjustable bars) between the two sides of the car.  They  
are a big help in controlling roll and in tuning the  
understeer/oversteer nature of the car.  However, they actually  
_increase_ weight transfer and put more weight on the outside wheel.   
Because tires grip less with increasing loading, anti-roll bars that  
are too stiff can actually degrade handling.  This usually manifests  
itself as a car that tends to "skate" through corners, with very  
little roll but without a very skittish feel.  I've ridden with a  
couple of instructors at PCA events that definitely have their roll  
bars too stiff...

Adjustable bars would seem to be an ideal way to make a good  
street/track car.  Keep relatively soft springs, but just adjust your  
bars stiff at the track.  Unfortunately, with the 944 this can be a  
dangerous approach:  control arms seem to break under just this  
scenario.  I followed up on a couple of reports of broken front  
control arms before I started preparing my car.  It turns out that in  
every case, they broke on cars that had stock springs but stiff  
anti-roll bars, and they broke at the anti-roll bar mounting point,  
which is about halfway between the hub carrier and the pivot.  My  
conclusion is that the stiff anti-roll bars introduced a high bending  
moment in the center of the control arm, a force it wasn't designed  
to handle.  My advice would be to run stiffer springs if you're going  
to crank your anti-roll bars toward the stiff side.  By the way, both  
the early (stamped steel) and late (cast aluminum) control arms broke  
under these conditions.


Sway-A-Way torsion bars are available from a variety of sources,  
including AutoMechanika, which is from whom I purchase them.  They  
come in many different diameters.  I'm running a tubular bar that has  
the rate of a 27 mm solid bar.  Keep in mind that the stiffness of a  
torsion bar goes up with the fourth power of the diameter, so a 27 mm  
diameter torsion bar is actually 2.3 times as stiff as a 22 mm  
torsion bar.


My understanding is that 1987 and later cars have a spring spacer to  
raise the front to comply with US bumper height restrictions, but I  
have no direct experience.  The rear spring plate has an eccentric  
bolt which will allow about 1" of height adjustment.  My experience  
with early 944s has been that they are usually raised up to the top  
of this adjustment as they come from the factory.  Lowering the car  
with this adjustment is very easy, and I believe it is covered in one  
of Bruce Anderson's articles in the Up Fixin collection.


Maybe a little bit of personal history is in order.  I made the  
decision to build a race car after quite a bit of experience driving  
my totally stock 1986 911 in track events.  I came to a point where I  
felt I wanted to start modifying the car to make it faster (and more  
fun to drive) on the track, and was planning on making the plunge of  
replacing my P7s with stickier rubber.  After thinking about it quite  
a bit, I realized that I would never be entirely comfortable with  
driving my pretty red car all out on the track, and that I would  
either hold back and never learn my limits, or exceed them and  
possibly damage the car.  I also knew that the modifications I'd  
eventually want to make would make it less comfortable on the street.   
So, I built a 944 race car and run it in SCCA regional races and  
occasional PCA track events.  I think I made the right decision:   
though the amount of money I've put into the race car is approaching  
(maybe exceeding) the value of my 911, I don't worry much about  
crunching a corner or denting a fender, and have resigned myself to  
that eventuality.  It's also a blast to drive on the track, even  
without the extra excitement of racing.

Of course, not everyone can afford to build a Porsche just for the  
track (I really couldn't, but I don't spend money on much else), so  
I'm sympathetic to the need for solutions to dual-purpose Porsches,  
and am glad to add my experience to the pot.

Subject: A 911 Carerra RS Ride

At a recent Porsche club track day I had the opportunity to get a ride
in a converted 911 Carerra RS (it used to be a 911T).  The owner/builder
of the car is Jeff Gamroth of Marque Motors here in Portland, OR.  Jeff
is in his late 20's.  From the sound of his motor he must be fantastic
with Porsche motors.  Jeff was even asked to be part of the pit crew
when the Brumos 911 Turbos werein town.  Jeff races his car in SCCA B
Production.

Jeff enjoys giving rides.  He was going to give a ride to another guy
but the other guy was out riding with his dad at the time. I asked if
he would take me and he said sure.  I got in and got the 4-point harness
snugged down good and tight and we took off. At this point my body went
into a mild state of panic.  It was a similar state of panic I once
experienced on an amuzement park ride which involved being strapped into
a cage which was then released in a free fall.  Now this feeling happended
in the car going from a standing start until he topped out in 5th gear
going down PIR's front straight.  This was all in a straight line!  The
combination of the accelaration and the sound of the motor was incredible!

I have had rides in lots of other cars, both Porsches and race cars
(Rabbits).  I have over 1,000 miles at PIR in my 911.  I have also taken
up racing a VW Golf.  But I have never experienced anything like the
acceleration this car has.  Not even in chipped 944 Turbos.  :-)

My next surprise was when Jeff hit the brakes for turn 1.  He used the
same braking point I use in the Golf.  Of course his car is going at
least 40mph faster at that point than my car can go.  It made me wish
the passenger seat had a 5-point harness instead of a 4-point.  Unless
you firmly brace your feet you start sliding out underneath the belts.

This car really sticks in the corners.  Then coming out of the corners
full throttle can't be used until the car is almost in a straight line.
At that point you are pushed deep into the seat again.

After several laps we reached the end of the session and pulled in.
I think I had been smiling the whole time.  Jeff lets out his usual
enthusiastic yell when things settle down.  Jeff LIKES this car.
One of the adjectives he used to describe it is, rude.  Yup.

I could be wise and say "because the formula for the spring constant  
of torsion bar is k = (pi G d^4) / (32 L), where G is the modulus of  
rigidity (a material property), d is the diameter of the bar, and L  
is the length of the bar."

However, I think what you're asking is "why does it go up with the  
fourth power of diameter?"  That's a little harder, but I'll try.

The spring constant of a torsion bar is expressed in units of torque  
per unit of angle (ex:  N-m per radian or ft-lbs per degree).  As the  
diameter of the torsion bar goes up, several things happen.  First,  
there is more material to resist the torque; this effect is  
proportional to the square of d (area is pi (d/2)^2).  Second, the  
force available to stress the bar decreases at each point,  
effectively because force = torque/length, where the length in this  
case is the diametrical distance.  In a solid bar there is actually  
an integral involved, but essentially this effect goes up linearly  
with d.  And finally, as d increases, a unit of angle becomes a  
larger linear displacement (dx = r dtheta).  Take all of these  
effects--one quadratic and two linear--and you get the fourth power  
relation.

I've actually simplified it a bit to suit this form of communication,  
but you get the idea....

Depends. Early or late S struts? Late struts will want late ball joints, 
which may mean late A-arms. What you *really* want to do is (a) see
the article in European Car from a couple of months ago on doing the
911 -> 914 front suspension swap and (b) have a whole 911 front suspension
to work from, not just the struts. Easy mistake to make, but hey, it is
a mistake.

You want to have that hub reinforced, then heat treated. It takes a lot of
stress, and frankly, the studs may pull out under hard cornering. Ghost
Racing has 6 *real* 914/6's and an EP 914/4 with 911 suspension. Lots of
problems in that area unless you have enough metal around the stud.

Clearance is fine; you can run up to 7" wheels with 205's with no problem.

There was a beer commercial series when I was growing up (so to speak),

Subject: Re: 944 series springs

Hi kids,

(Sorry for not responding any sooner.  I read my WAN-mail at home at night,
after running, putting the kids to bed, supping, etc.)

Just to clarify my earlier posting.  The 100% weight-transfer was meant to
be a worst-case and somewhat conservative operating point.  What I
specifically want to avoid is bottoming out the spring (or rest of the
suspension), which can be a very nasty thing.  I don't want life-as-we-know-
it to end because I tapped the turtles!  It is the inside front wheel which
lifts in corners, and I would guess that most of its share of the weight has
been transferred to the outside front, the rest to the rears.

Regarding mechanical advantage, the 944S/S2/Turbo Tech Spec book says that a
one degree change in strut tilt results in approx 5 mm vehicle height change.
I am sure that I can generate a G of cornering in the car, but clearly the
centre of gravity is well below half the track.  (And I have loaned my copy of
Puhn to a friend...  Time to re-read.)

I agree with you, Nathan, regarding the quality of the Weltmeister sway bars.
On the plus side, many of the parts (eg, the rod ends) are generically 
replaceable through cheaper sources than Automotion.  I haven't heard of
any failures of/problems with the springs, though.

I'm definitely interested in the parts you are planning to manufacture.
Perhaps you, Jerry Pellegrino, and I could get together at some point over
the winter and chew the fat.  (Jerry serves as my adult supervision in all
matters of car preparation.)  Thanks for taking all the time you have to 
elucidate these matters!

The torsional modulus of a bar is given by the integral of the incremental
area times the radius, with respect to the radius, from zero to the actual
radius, times the shear modulus of the material:

  //
  ||
  || SrdAdr   =   Mt (torsional modulus)
  ||
  ||
 //

where S = shear modulus
      r = radius
      dA = incremental area
      R = outside radius
dA = 2*pi*rdr (as dr is small)

Or,

  // r=R
  ||
  || 2*pi*S*r^2drdr = Mt
  ||
  ||
 // r=0


Which I think comes out to

pi*S*R^4
- ----------  = Mt 
   6

Drew,

It is a pity it is the end of the season, your local PCA region (and mine) is
Intermountain. There are several people in the club with RSA's. I experienced a
hill climb in a "Martini" RSA, quite an experience! You could have obtained
opinions from actual owners, but from the times they collected this year I do
not think they have any complaints.
You might also think about holding back a while as you might get a better deal
if the dealer does not think you will buy at any cost.

By the way which dealer are talking to the SLC or Provo one ? Just curious.

I wasn't aware that there are any higher rate springs for the "standard"

To connect this to my previous discussion and make sure everybody
understands (a lot of people seem confused by this), you can't
change the overall weight transferred by changing the bars, in the
sense I discussed it earlier. The total weight transferred (sum of
left wheel weights minus sum of right wheel weights, or vice-versa)
is dependent only on the CG height, the track, and the lateral
acceleration. You can, however, change the percentage of that transferred
weight applied to the front and rear wheels, which determines which
end supplies more cornering force, and hence which end has higher slip
angles (understeer/oversteer). As you stiffen one end, you increase
the percentage of the weight transferred on that end. As Nathan says,
that increases the force on the outer tire and decreases it on the
inside tire at that end. Since the lateral force/normal force
characteristic of any tire is nonlinear, you get less total lateral
force from the same total normal force by loading one wheel more
heavily (pushing it more into the nonlinear region) and the other less
heavily (but the lateral force decrease there is still essentially
linear). The overall result, a Nathan points out, is that the
stiffer end sticks less. For instance, a stiffer front (bars, springs,
etc) normally makes the car understeer more. If you just remember 
"the stiffer end sticks less", you don't need all the fancy tables
which tell you what increases understeer/oversteer.

We (Jersey Shore Region, PCA) have several track junkies running stiff
(Weltmeister) front bars with stock springs. We have seen a number of
failures in the hardware of the sway bar. The only control arm failure
we have seen (at pre-tech, fortunately) was a steel arm, with a
Weltmeister bar, but also with 250# springs (and a suitably stiff rear).
How many aluminum arm failures have you seen? Is the incipient failure
(a crack, I assume) readily visible from the bottom of the arm?
Do you happen to know where the Weltmeister bar was adjusted on the
cars whose arms failed (you can make the bar far too stiff with short
arm adjustments, it appears)?

Subject: RS America?


I had the opportunity to drive the RS America.  I'm an early 911 fan,
myself, the heaviest 911 I've driven is an SC, and I've got to say the
RS feels heavy.  The great part about it is the steering alignment -
while it removes some of the "feel" of the road the early 911 "bump
steer specials" give, it is far less tiring to drive.  Personally, I'm
getting tired of bump steer and I think I'm going to make myself a
little piece to move the strut to 0 scrub on my 911.

The car has power, as well, and plenty of it.  No big lag like a
turbo, and smooth throughout the RPM range.

And of course it's incredibly pretty, it's a 911 after all, and it's
got the nice looking whale-tail (I hate the turbo tail).

That's about the only good things I have to say about it.  This car is
not lightweight (maybe compared to the new 911s or the turbos which
are HEAVY), but as cars go this thing is a fat slob.  It feels so
heavy when you are cornering, and it's really tough to get the back
end to slide, even a little (had the sales rep losing more hair while I
was trying).  He let me take it out in return for an article (read
"advertisement") in the newsletter here, and after the ride I told him
it wasn't in his best interests for me to write about what I thought.

The real problem is that the car is not what they claim it is.  It's
very comfortable, there is almost nothing missing from the interior -
this isn't a thoroughbred sports car.  Have you seen an original RS?
THAT is a thoroughbred.  This RS is a ripoff, you can get the same
performance out of cars 20K cheaper or 20 years older.  And the
cheaper cars will throw in the 200 lb upholstery and electric seats.

Of course, if what you really want is to look good and to feel cozy,
and know you're driving the most identifiable car in the world, and if
you've got 60K to blow on that, go ahead.  It WILL turn heads.

Porsche is not what it used to be even when it tries.

Of course I understand I'm a little extreme, but that's why they call
me, and those like me, ENTHUSIASTS.  (note that being an enthusiast is
different from being enthusiastic).

   Anyone out there who solved this problem?>

   Thanks,

   -- 

Yes.  [ JC am I remembering this right? ]

I assume this happens under hard cornering AND full throttle (usually
goes without saying in a 911, but just thought I'd ask).  The problem
might also be the reservoir drain "lip" problem, where the last drops
of fuel can't get out of the reservoir bowl because there is a lip
surrounding the drain (whose intent was to keep any sediment in the
bowl).  Don't use dirty gasoline and file the lip off, also make sure
your floats are correct, and that your needle valves aren't clogged up
(or broken) restricting fuel flow.

Until you fix it try a slower transition to full throttle.  Don't be
afraid of a little movement in the back end there.

Note the auxiliary enrichment system here should not be the cause.

Thanks to all of you who offered your encouragement,
discouragement, and other misc input.

I test drove the car last night after
talking to one of the local owners of an RS.  I was a little
disappointed in the seats and, as opposed to the 911's with
rear seats, the only means of connecting a harness is to 

install a roll bar or cage for the upper attach points. 

Looks like I'll need to install a bar this winter.  Other
than that and the wimpy alignment (big time understeer) it's
a sweet car. 


I haven't bought it yet.  They came off the 

price a bit, but I'm going to let them sweat it out a day or
so.  It helped to provide them with info indicating that I had
the financial capacity to make the purchase to motivate them
to actually put together a deal.  


I had the opportunity to talk to Monty Smith (Local RS owner).
He had an interesting comment: "The RS is basically a
C2 with $15K worth of options deleted for $10K less."  The
salesman made a deal about the 17" wheels.  Big whoop.  Fewer
tire choices and more $$$.  I guess the other $5K is for
weight reduction <:-).

Yes, the mirror is *directly* attached to the windshield.  What is broken
is the day/night mechanism.  The lever flops around and the mirror is

Is the mirror glued to the windshield, or is it attached through some sort of
hole through the glass.  

If it's attached through a hole, have you thought about drilling it out?
You could center-punch the metal (carefully so you don't break the glass!), 
start drilling with a small drill and then use larger and larger drills 
until you can remove the mirror.  That way you would avoid hitting the glass 
with your drills.

If it's glued on, you could always replace the windshield! :)  
Or how about giving your favorite bodyshop a call for advice?  If you don't 
know of one, Carol and Cecil Beach at Bodystyle in San Jose, CA (408-736-9020)

Drew,

You commented:

"BFG's going to make a few bucks off of me in '93.  Or was that
Yoko?"

I might suggest that if you do PCA TT's/SOLO I's,buy the Goodyear GS-CS's,
as they are far superior to both BFG and YOKO's!!!  I speak with
experience, having driven in both Monte Smith's and Mike Dowlan's 911
RS America's, both running GC-CS's!!!!  They stick big time- so good that
we're switching to these tires for TT/PCA Club Racing next year!!!
The RR compound BFG's will make great rain tires and the Yoko's will
be great autox tires that will last a long time with maximum stick- but
the GS-CS's will out perform them- hands down- on a RR course any
day of the week!!!!  Just ask Monte or Mike (tell them I refered you to
them!!  Especially since I've been a Yoko contract driver for the last 2
years!!!).  This was during a recent TT at Las Vegas.  Also, the std. GS-C's
make great rain tires, as we drove in a virtual downpour with good grip!

Good'ay,

Mr Wizard

(Note- these are really slicks with a groove down the center- so they would
be very bad rain tires ((GS-CS's)) !!)

Open for comment:
  Does anyone think that the autox compound BFG's would be 'ok' for RR'ing
if the track is "soaked- and driving in a down pour"?  I thought of this
the other day when looking at a set of RR Goodyear rain tires-very soft
but only good in VERY WET conditions!! It seems that they would work well
since they would not really heat up that bad due to running on a saturated
surface... speculation here.

Comments..... would be welcomed!!!

=================================================================

                  1993 Porsche 928 GTS

At the time of its introduction in March 1977, at the Geneva auto 
show, the Porsche 928 revolutionized the concept of the Grand 
Touring car. Although the 928 has undergone continuous 
improvement since then, time has not changed its character as a 
high performance GT of the first order. With its first-class 
comfort, features and appointments, and an engine with remarkable 
tractability under all speed and load conditions, the 928 GTS is 
Porsche's premier Grand Touring car. More than a decade and a 
half after it changed automotive thinking, the 928 still defines 
the entire class of high performance Grand Touring cars.

Although never intended as a race car, the 928 has competed in 
international events, most notably the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 
the 24 Hours of Daytona. In both races, the privately-entered 
928s successfully completed the grueling distance, demonstrating 
durability of the 928 design.

ENGINE

Since its introduction, the all-aluminum 928 powerplant has been 
one of the most advanced V8 engines in the world. Even though the 
original 928 concept was universally acclaimed by the motoring 
world, it was not long before Porsche's engineers began 
extracting still more power and performance from the V8 engine. 
The engine of the 928 GTS has grown to 5.4 liters, 20 percent 
larger than the original engine of 1977. The 928 GTS is 
remarkable not only for its peak power of 345 horsepower at 5700 
rpm and peak torque of 369 ft.-lbs. at 4250 rpm, but also for its 
remarkably flat torque curve. Fully 80 percent of the peak engine 
torque is available from 1000 rpm to 6000 rpm; this translates 
into smooth, effortless acceleration even from very low speeds in 
high gear. Thanks to its low rotational mass, the 928 GTS engine 
revs freely to its 6600 rpm redline, unusually high for such a 
large V8.

The 928 GTS employs the Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection system, 
with a hot-wire air mass sensor for accurate fuel metering and 
low exhaust emissions. As on all 1993 Porsches, air is admitted 
to the engine through a resonance induction system, which 
improves airflow into the cylinders and so ensures improved 
engine response at all speeds. The engine employs dual knock 
sensors for optimum ignition and fuel settings, and exhausts 
through a pair of metal substrate three-way catalytic converters 
with oxygen sensors.


PERFORMANCE

Such sophisticated engine technology in a GT translates into 
sports car performance combined with refined, effortless power in 
everyday driving and relaxed cruising capability. The 928 GTS 
will accelerate to 60 mph in only 5.5 seconds with a manual 
transmission, equaling the time of the Porsche Carrera 2 and 
Carrera 4. The automatic transmission takes just a fraction of a 
second longer, 5.6 seconds. Both versions of the 928 GTS will 
reach a top track speed of 171 mph.


TRANSMISSION

The engine transmits its power through a five-speed manual or 
four-speed automatic transmission. Both use a remote transmission 
oil cooler to ensure long life, and are driven through Porsche's 
electronically controlled PSD limited slip differential. The 
system takes advantage of the wheel sensors of the anti-lock 
braking system to determine if a rear tire is slipping. 
Differential lockup is then electronically modulated between zero 
and 100 percent to reduce wheelspin. The PSD differential 
improves vehicle stability under hard acceleration, under braking 
and in curves, in contrast to other systems which do not monitor 
tire slip under braking. Under slippery conditions, this system 
improves traction and results in a more secure grip on the road.


SUSPENSION

The 928 GTS continues to use Porsche's innovative "Weissach" rear 
axle, pioneered on the original 928. The Weissach axle employs 
upper transverse links, lower semi-trailing arms, and adjustable 
coil springs over gas pressure shock absorbers. The key to the 
Weissach axle is a flexible link in each semi-trailing arm, which 
has a toe-correcting feature under high cornering loads. In 
effect, the Weissach rear axle design of 1977 offered a form of 
"four wheel steering" long before the concept gained popularity. 
This toe correction feature leads to increased stability at the 
handling limit and in critical situations, such as entering turns 
at excessive speed.

The 928 GTS uses large 17-inch "Turbo-design" wheels, with large 
air openings to ensure optimum brake cooling. The 928 GTS employs 
a tire pressure monitoring system which was developed on the 
Porsche Type 962 race cars.

To accept the wider wheels and tires, the GTS body sports wider, 
more muscular rear fender flares. Other bodywork changes include 
"959-style" outside mirrors and a red reflective panel between 
the taillights.


BRAKES

In keeping with Porsche tradition, the 928 GTS uses a braking 
system unmatched by any other GT. The front 322 mm (12.68 in.) 
and rear 299 mm (11.77 in.) brakes, each with four-piston 
calipers, are taken directly from the 911 Turbo. Like every 1993 
Porsche, the 928 GTS has anti-lock brakes as standard equipment.


INTERIOR

The 928 GTS, like its predecessors in the Porsche V8 line, 
emphasizes luxury and convenience along with its effortless 
performance. The fully appointed interior includes leather seats 
front and rear. Electrically-operated front seats, with three 
memory settings for the driver's seat and outside mirror, and a 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning system with automatic 
temperature control ensure that the occupants of the 928 GTS can 
travel great distances at high speed as well as high comfort.

The instrument pod, which adjusts up and down with the steering 
column, includes a driver information system which monitors 22 
different functions and displays warning messages in three levels 
of priority. The large easily read display includes trip computer 
functions.

SPECIAL OPTIONS AND EUROPEAN DELIVERY

Porsche owners who would like to further personalize their cars 
can take advantage of Porsche's special options. Porsche offers a 
wide range of special order items to make each car uniquely 
individual. These include paintwork to match any sample color and 
leather to duplicate any sample shade. Virtually every interior 
item may be ordered with factory-applied leather trim.

Every Porsche may be ordered through U.S. dealers for European 
delivery. The European delivery program offers an unforgettable 
driving experience, in one's own personal car on the high-speed 
motorways and scenic, winding secondary roads from which 
Porsche's legendary road-going sports cars are bred.

PORSCHE, SPORTS CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Porsche is not only a leader in high technology and high 
performance, but is also an industry leader in environmental 
responsibility. This begins with building cars to last. Of all 
the Porsches built since 1948, it is estimated that fully 80 
percent are still in service.

Part of that longevity comes from the fully galvanized bodywork 
of the Porsche 911. Porsche pioneered the use of two-sided 
galvanized body panels in 1976. Since then, experience has shown 
the effectiveness of the fully galvanized bodywork and other rust 
preventive measures. Porsche can now warranty every new Porsche 
for ten years against rust perforation. The solidity of the 
bodywork has been a factor in maintaining Porsche's traditionally 
high resale values.

If and when a Porsche reaches the end of its useful life and is 
recycled, labeling of various plastic components will make it 
easier to reprocess the parts. Labeling will help to put plastics 
back into consumer products, not in landfills.

Despite their high performance, Porsche cars are among the 
cleanest on the road. Highly effective three-way catalytic 
converters, oxygen sensors, and engine management systems have 
long been a part of the Porsche pedigree. All Porsche models are 
equipped with systems that fulfill the most stringent exhaust 
standards worldwide.

Growing concern about the possible effects of 
chlorofluorocarbons, including the CFC-12 refrigerants used in 
automotive air conditioning systems, on the earth's ozone layer, 
has led Porsche to introduce a CFC-free refrigerant, HFC-134a, on 
all of its 1993 models. The entire air conditioning system had to 
be redesigned to use the new refrigerant. The higher cost of HFC-
134a, and its higher salvage value, also provide a monetary 
recycling incentive for repair shops.

PASSIVE SAFETY

The agility, precise handling and high power of Porsche sports 
cars places them among the world's best cars in terms of active 
safety. Passive safety is also a prime consideration at Porsche. 
In 1990, Porsche was the world's first auto manufacturer to equip 
every car sold in the United States with driver and front 
passenger airbags as standard equipment.

WARRANTY

Thanks to decades of experience building solid, durable high-
performance cars, Porsche's warranty coverage is among the 
broadest of any sports car manufacturer. Each Porsche is covered 
by a two-year new vehicle warranty with unlimited mileage, and 
includes the Porsche ASSIST (TM) roadside assistance program 
(pending approval for vehicles sold in California). The fully 
galvanized body and 26-step paint and anti-corrosion process 
enable Porsche to warranty each car for ten years and unlimited 
mileage against rust perforation, protection unmatched by any 
other sports car maker. In addition, the paintwork carries a 
three-year limited warranty.

This tire is a VERY good road race tire, some 1-1.5 seconds faster than
BFG's at Sears Point (in actual tire testing of an '86 ITS 944 Porsche).  It
is, however, not compounded for autox's, since the compound is quite
hard compared to BFG/RSII's.  I have inquired to Bridgestone to see if 're-
compounding' the RAZ's for autox'ing is in the works and their reply was
"No!!" (they will not change the compound in the near future).  To bad, as
this SOLO II Stock Class 'slick', if compounded correctly, could give the
other tire manufacturers a run for their money.  Bridgestones are very
easy to drive at the limit, similar to BFG's, but they don't have a very soft
compound that is needed for autox'ing (IMHO)!

Good'ay,

Peter -

The glue holding the mirror to the glass is very strong.  Putting the
 original
on involved heating it, then pressing the mirror base to the glass while
 the
glue set.  If you absolutely have to get it off, your best bet is to apply
 heat
to the mirror base to warm the glue, and use a single-edge razor to slice
through the glue.  Risky.

However, from your description it sounds like your need not replace the
base at all.  You should see a hole drilled in the base, and in it a screw
which fastens the rest of the mirror assembly to the base.  Unscrew it,
replace the rest of the assembly with a good one, and put the screw
back in.

[stuff deleted...]
   Thoughts?  I think a driver, within limits, adjusts to the equipment and

[...]

My experience with "R" compound tires leads me to agree with the
above. Among the race-compound treaded street tires that I use
on the racetrack, cost is usually the most important factor 
among the competitive products; the families of RE-71, A008 and
Comp TA.  I cannot, myself, tell the difference amonst them.

I find that proper tire pressure is the most significant aspect
that makes the tire work well, hence I have spent alot of time
chalking tires and adjusting 'hot' pressures between laps to optimize
the handling. It is not unusual for me to end up with a tire
pressure distribution like this at Bridgehampton:
LR: 47psi,RR:43psi,LF 32psi,RF 25psi.  

The street tire is alot different than the true racing tire, or
slicks.  I have used the Pirelli P-zero qualifying compound
radial slicks and a standard Goodyear bias-belted slick.  Both
generate alot of cornering force (more than I can handle).  The
Pirelli makes no sounds when its about to let go, and when it
did I spun so hard I warped my trunk hinges on my 914/6.  Wow!

Subject: RE: 944 (or any car) springs and suspension mods--very long

Nathan, that was a nice treatise on 944 suspensions - one I found good 
value in!  I'm one of those people with stock 951 suspension pieces 
(non-sport), and Weltmeister bars cranked up, stiff.  I've had no 
problems with the Porsche pieces, although who knows, maybe an aluminum 
control arm will snap some day, as you suggest.  Those things are expensive!

I have similar results with the Weltmeister parts: the bushings in the 
drop links distort in short order, and the drop links snap.  Although 
the component quality is high, the engineering and stress-matching of 
pieces is poor.  I noticed this during the installation, and took care 
to align the drop links perfectly so the force would be exactly in a 
straight line.  I used lock washers to prevent the [early design] drop 
link lower mount from spinning, and over-tightened the sway bar clamp 
to prevent it from twisting and snapping the top of the link off.  Not 
an ideal solution overall, but it's held OK for 5 years, whereas some 
friends report many drop-link failures..

When I complained to Automotion about bushings failing, the answer was 
to send them more money for the "competition drop links".  At $100, 
these are a rip-off!  Yes, the bushings are fine now (because there 
aren't any!), but the clunking is horrible and the link gets even more 
impulse force now, resulting in one snapped link.  They neglected to 
mention any of these new "qualities" on the phone.

Overall, I would not buy another Weltmeister anti-roll bar after this, 
and I have continuing high regard for the factory's efforts in this area.

It depends a lot on WHAT tires specifically you are comparing.  If you are
talking RAZ versus non-race compound street rubber - yeah - a second is
easily there.  If you are comparing Yoko A008RS/RSII or BFG Comp T/A R1
vs. RAZ, you are looking at a different picture.  All the newest race
compound tires from BFG, Yoko, Bridgestone are fairly equal.  BFG and Yoko
also offer different compounds for road vs. autocross racing.  Hoosier,
Goodyear (GS-CS, ZR-S) & General (XP2000G) are some other manufacturers
that offer race compound DOT approved tires.  Which one of the autocross
tires is fastest, IMHO, depends mostly on your car, tire size, driving
style, and personal preference.  Same goes for road-race tires.  However,
if you are currently running track events on non-race DOT tires, you
should VERY SERIOUSLY consider some race rubber.  I run track events on
Goodyear GS-CS tires which I prefer due to their longevity and excellent
grip and driving feel.  On Texas World Speedway's 1.8 mile road course I
can probably shave 3 or 4 seconds (easily) off my time on street
Gatorbacks.  BTW - the reference to John Baker "cutting off a second"
really doesn't say much unless you include specifics on what track and
over what distance (1 lap I presume?)

Asuming that you can adjust to take advantage of the stickier rubber, you
WILL drop a lot of time with RAZ or any other race compound tires.  With
the understanding that it'll cost you in durability.  Don't expect a race
compound tire to last 5,000 miles on the street.  They get most of the
extra grip through softer rubber compounds - some autocross tires are so
soft they can wear out in 10 or 20 laps of racing.  They also usually
start out "shaved" down to about 4-6/32th.  These tires are made
specifically for autocrossing and not even to be used for street use
or especially road-racing.  Many of the road-race tires would be acceptable
on the street but still would not last very long by comparison to normal
street tires.

P.S.  At our last autocross, a Mustang driver improved from middle of the
      pack to first place (about 3 or 4 seconds) after switching from
      generic 225/60 street rubber to BFG's softest 245/50 race rubber.

Hope this helps . . .

Subject: Sway bar recommendations wanted


I've been following the springs and suspension thread over the last
few days and want to say thanks for the tutorial. The information
has been very helpful in expanding my understanding of suspension
dynamics. The November issue of Porsche Panorama also has an article
on suspension basics which is fairly good (if not timely!).

I've seen several NON-recommendations for Weltmeister sway bars
over the past few days. I do mostly autocrossing, but may run 
several track events next year. I was planning to buy a set for 
my '86 944 and install them over the winter, but now I'm not so sure.

Does anyone have any recommendations for other sway bar
manufacturers?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kyle,

This has nothing to do with rear-view mirrors, but rather is about
the gas tank sealant. Wurth Products is the manufacturer, you should be
able to find a dealer in your area. Sorry, no, I don't have a phone

John,
     I'm not sure I see the connection between spinning and warping your
trunk hinges.  Do you mean to imply that the forces created because of the
spin caused enough stress in the body/frame to warp the hinges?  If so, I
would most likely tend to suggest that it was forces generated due to the
high GRIP (PRIOR to the spin) that caused the warping.  Unless you hit
something or went over some really rough terrain sideways?

Thanks for all the responses to my question.

I was refering to R  compound DOT tires.  I admit there is a major
difference between R and "consumer" performance tires (like COMP TA R!
versus COMP TA ZR).  I have found though, that even these differences
can be minimized if driving style is changed.

On the other hand, I am often willing to give up a second for $250 per

The diff is that although BFG R1 tires are really highly sticky tires,
they are perfectly OK as far as your local law enforcemtn officials are
concerned and have a more durable belt structure so they can be driven
to and from the track (like I do) without undue fear of puncture or
blowout from potholes or debris.

Subject: Porsche Parts Microfiche



To the community of Porsche owners:

Does anyone know how to read Porsche parts microfiche without
buying an expensive microfiche reader?

Things I've tried:

     Overhead projector - The print on microfiche is way too
                          fine to show up clearly.

     Microfiche reader at a library - Uses a small-format microfiche.
                          Only a portion of the microfiche can be read,
                          and the design of the reader won't let you
                          move the fiche around on the tray.

     Magnifying glass   - The microfiche is designed to be backlit.
                          I can't find a magnifying glass large enough
                          and powerful enough to be usable.

I trust the microfiche more than Automotion, Tweeks, Performance Products,
and Stodard.  I'd rather not rely on the guy behind the parts counter at 
the local dealership.  Plus, the microfiche costs only eight bucks.

Any ideas?

Subject: Thar she blows

Well, I got into my 87 944S this morning, did a little routine check, and 
found that my car is taking on water. Specifically, the floor pan behind the
passenger's seat is seriously wet (has been raining outside). The water must
be coming in from a plugged vent somewhere. Note that it is the pan behind
the passenger's seat. The driver's rear pan and the front rugs are all dry.
So are the back seats. 


Anybody know which drain hole might be responsible, and where they exit the
car? This is a real recent problem, and I need to find out where the problem
is before the rugs start to mildew and (AARRGGHH) rust starts to form. My guess
is it is either the sunroof vent or the gas tank vent.

I wonder if this is covered under the rust warranty...

But the reader costs more like $800.  Porsche will sell you one!  Even so,
you need to keep on top of the supercessions which PCNA periodically
publishes (which is why fiches you see typically have red splotches on them,
marking parts which have changed).

Honestly, the best thing you can do is find a dealership with a parts guy
who knows his stuff.  I've worked with one guy for a few years now, and
my mechanic uses him too.  Yeah, he makes a mistake every once in a while,
which is understandable given the information he has to work with and the
number of car models and years he has to take care of.  Rest assured you'd
make twice as many mistakes - I know I would!  If he sends me a wrong part,
no big deal, back it goes.

Christopher -

There are four drain hoses from the sunroof, basically one at each corner.
The front two go down the A-pillars, behind their trim.  The rear two go down
the C-pillars.  The hoses or their drains may be plugged, or the hoses may be
detached from the metal drains (entries) in the sun roof area.  Or a hose may
have chafed and worn a hole.  This is all pretty uncommon, so I don't really
know for sure.

You can get good access to all four hoses if you are brave and remove enough
trim and headliner.  It will all go back on OK if you aren't too reckless.
I took quite a bit of mine apart recently to run a CB antenna, and all it
took to get it back together was patience, and rubber cement to tack the
headliner material in a few places.

There is also a drain from under the gas filler.

Happy hunting, and let me know what you find.

This is interesting - I too have a water collection problem on my 87 944S;
after leaving it outside in heavy rain, I am greeted with a quantity of
water let out when I open the driver's door.  It accumulates in the area
outside of the passenger compartment lip, over the kick plate.  I haven't
worried about it up to now, since it doesn't seem to be threatening
anything perishable, but it is curious that it only happens on the driver's
side.  I had assumed that it was coming in through the door seal at the
side somehow, and then being unable to escape through the door seal at the
bottom.  Could it have anything to do with these sunroof drain hoses? (I
have the factory electric tilt/removable sunroof).

P.S. In the end, my rear tyre choice was settled on grounds of availability
and cost.  The Pirellis I wanted to match the existing fronts are no longer
made, and I found a local place that had in stock, and would fit and
balance for (pounds)111 each, BFG Comp/TAs.  Initial impressions are good;
much better in the wet then the Yokos, and at least as good in the dry -
the tyre place also told me that the wear factor is better for the BFGs.

I have a the fische for my 87 944S (which actually covers the 944 model
line from 85/2-89), as well as the fische for 83-85/1 and 90-91. I bought
the first, but just asked the local parts dealer for an old copy of the
other 2 (they get replaced every quarter, as I understand it).
I read them on the library's stnadard sized reader, which also makes
prints. At least with this reader, you can get to ~2/3 of the fische
directly. For the rest, I turn the fische upside down. It is a bit hard
to read, but you can find the right area relatively easily, and then I make
a copy for the details.

At home, I have tried a small microscope. I think I used about a 4X
objective with a 10x eyepiece (40x overall). I jury rigged a sheet of
glass with a florescent light under it. It worked, but not very well.
I didn't have a very solid mount for the microscope, nor a very effective
way to move the fische around without changing the focus. I suspect
that something like this could be made to work reasonably effectively
with some additional work, if you can find the microscope or an equivalent
inexpensively. It hasn't risen very high on my priority list, since
I can read them reasonably effectively at work.

Kevin commented in a separate post that it is wise to relay on the parts
person, due to supersessions, etc. I agree. As Kevin says, find one you
trust. However, I still find the fisches valuable. It is frequently
useful to know how things are put together, or just what variations
of a particular part Porsche made (an example being springs and sway
bars). Another use for me is determining which parts of my 944S are
unique, and which are identical to the 8 valve car, so I know what will
fit if I buy the "standard" part from an aftermarket supplier (most of
them don't know what fits an S and what doesn't, although they will
claim that they do). Also, knowing what is common between early and
late series cars is useful.

I can tell you what causes this problem in a VW Golf, an '87 GTI in my
case.  The window seals located where the window descends into the door
are not even remotely watertight, so some water enters the door when
it's wet out.  Behind the interior door trim panel is a plastic liner
which is designed (among other things) to keep this water from entering
the interior of the car.  The design of the door is such that water
draining down into the door may (and does) run down along the inside
(i.e., the side facing away from the interior of the car) of the liner.
If all is well, the water slides down the liner into the bottom of the
door and out drain holes in the bottom of the door.  On the Golf, these
holes are located as far outboard as is practical, so you normally won't
find standing water on the rocker panel after the car has been *parked*
in the rain.

The door liner is made of translucent plastic and is glued around the
perimeter to the inner door panel.  Since the liner is glued to the
outside (i.e., the side facing the interior of the car) of the inner
metal door panel, a natural water trap forms:

		  H20
		   ||
		\  \/  |				|
		 \     |				|
	Liner --> \    |  <--- Inner door panel		| <-- Outer door panel
		   \   | 				|
  <-- Car interior  \  |				|
		     \ O <- Drain holes			|
		      \|				|
			------------------------------O-|
					 Drain holes  ^	|

The wizards at Wolfsburg tried to provide drains for this trap by
"adding" holes to the area of metal where the liner is glued to the
door, viz:

	O	O	O	O	O	<- drain holes
	---------------------------------	<- bottom edge of liner

These do help when the seal between the liner and the inner door panel
(formed by the adhesive) is perfect.  However, if the seal between the
bottom edge of the liner and the door is no longer perfect, water will
escape and travel straight down, dripping off the bottom of the door,
onto the door seal.  From there, some will head inboard and some will
head outboard.  On the Golf, the water that goes inboard runs into the
passenger footwell, sits there, and stinks.  Unfortunately, if you've
got a puddle, you have probably had this problem for some time.  The
Golf carpet forms a pretty good vapor barrier and so the footwell forms
a nice little reservoir.  Unless the car is regularly parked in the sun,
the water doesn't readily evaporate (you don't park your Porsche in the
sun, do you? #) ) The carpet is mold resistant, but the sound insulation
under it isn't.

You may want to get a feeling for the contour of the passenger footwell
floor by looking under the car.  If you do, you may notice a few plugs
pressed into the sheet metal.  On the Golf, these ARE NOT the source of
the leak problem, as they are very well sealed.

Cause:

How can the door liner become unsealed?  Several ways, as you can
probably imagine:

. Crash repair (you didn't crash your Porsche, did you? #) )
. Factory defect (I know, inconceivable on a Porsche, but all too common
    on a VW Golf #( ).
. Stereo installation
. Alarm installation

Diagnosis:

. Next time it is raining and your car is parked, open the door and
    check if water is dripping off the inner bottom edge where the 
    door trim panel meets the inner door (metal) panel.

. Don't wait for the rain.  Direct a low-pressure garden hose with
    copious flow onto the window with the door open, and observe the
    bottom of the door.  If water is coming out, this may be the source
    of your problem.  Try the other door for comparison purposes.

Repair:

I replaced the door liner with clear 5 mil (?) winter window liner,
available at most hardware stores and cut to fit.  By constructing rather
complex deflectors and channels and blocking off many of the openings in
the inner door panel, I was able to minimize the amount of water
striking the inside of the liner.  This, plus careful sealing along the
bottom edge, fixed it.  I should note that I was forced to remove the
passenger seat, back seat, and rocker trim, and pull up much of the
carpet during this fix.  Since the under-carpet sound insulation isn't
stocked by the dealer and ultimately came from Germany, the car was in
this state for about 2 weeks.  The upside was that it was that much
quicker with all that excess weight removed... though not as quick as my
(also leaky) Targa. Verification of the new seal is the same as the
diagnosis, above.

Of course, everyone knows that the only things a VW Golf and a VW 924,
oops Porsche 944 have in common is that they come from Germany and
consume hydrocarbons, so your mileage may vary.  However, if you ever
make the mistake of buying a VW GTI, or any VW for that matter, you'll
be that much more Fahrvergnugen-ed in advance.

You mentioned a sunroof.  I understand a plugged sunroof drain is
another cause of the "wet floor" problem on the Golf.  However, I know
nothing whatsoever about 944 sunroof drains.

Good luck, and have fun!

As it happens, Edmund Scientific has a 40x pocket microscope that looks a
bit like a pen with a plastic cone on the end. You place the cone on the
object of interest, and look through the end. That way you don't have to move
the fiche around, you just move the scope, and the focus isn't an issue - it's
always focussed on whatever's at the far end of the plastic cone. The cone is
transparent for sidelighting, which wouldn't help any for fiche but makes it
quite good for other things. The price was quite reasonable, but I didn't get
that one. I have the micro-tel, which is a 25x microscope that converts to a 
15x telescope. The price was right, but I doubt if 25x would be enough to
read the fiche.

Subject: re: Thar she blows

The short version :-) of Tim's detailed response about door vapor
barriers in VW's is...

Behind the door trim panel is a plastic vapor barrier.  Water runs
down into the door between the window and the seal at the bottom of
the window.  If the vapor barrier doesn't have a good seal at the
bottom of the door then water will enter the car and collect in one
of the footwells.  The vapor barrier on my GTI had pulled back 
because of age and was putting water in the left passenger footwell.

Pulling the trim off the door and inspecting the vapor barrier will
probably be easier than pulling trim to inspect the sunroof drains.
I would start there.

Good luck.

        Ahhhh, I've had the same problem with my 85/2 944. The culprit was
some jerk that thought the drain plug in the rear passenger foot space was
a good location to position a jack. I don't think he/she got very far
before dislodging the sealed plug. 

Now I doubt someone did the same thing on your 944 but there is a drain
plug right where you're talking about and if it leaks causes the exact
problem.

The best thing to do is take the passenger seat out and get under the
carpet. If there is still a lot of water in there stick some newspaper in
there or something to soak it up. In my car the carpet came up fairly
easily and there is some foam insulation under the carpet that acts like a
big sponge. You have to get all the water out otherwise your car will stink
for sure. I propped the carpet up and used a big Patton fan to "blow dry"
the area over night. If you look under the car right where the rear foot
well is check that plug and make sure it is sealed! I had to epoxy mine but
no problem since.

For those who wonder (care?) whatever happened to my "case" in trying
to get the folks who sold me my 1970 911T and apparently misrepresented

I went through the Bureau or Automotive Repair to try to get them to
lean on the shop (I had about 25 pages of receipts and documentation)
The end result was that I wound up dealing with the shop owner who
wanted to try to "work things out".

They took the car back and diagnosed some electrical problems, but agreed
that the compression was low.  My take was they basically agreed to fix the
car.

I got a phone call Wednesday night that in shortened version was "your 
car is parked out on the street, we're closing the doors and going under.  
Where do you want us to leave the keys?".

I loaded up the trusty Suburban (tools, dogs and wife included) and only
jumper cables we required to get the car started and home.  I'm at least
grateful that the car wasn't damaged or disassembled

My new course of action is to do whatever is required to make the car
reliable again, at my expense.  Although the car continually drops a
cylinder(s?) after fresh or a clean set of plugs it does appear to 
have good power.  Even now in its weak state (runs rough, low power-esp
at low RPM, some backfiring) the car still revs freely-although slowly,
runs at 180 F, shows oil pressure  of 60 psi at about 3000 RPM,
doesn't ping, and is getting about 20 mpg.

I know the engine has low compression, I think the fuel system is in order-
dual Zeniths, but am curious as to something to look for electrically.  The
last "tale" I got from the repair shop was that during the time the black
box in the ignition system was bypassed, the ignition wires were damaged
internally, which is the underlying reason the car continues to foul plugs.
The car now has a good used black box, but I'n uncertain whether the wires 
have been replaced.  Any thoughts on this?

I'm mentally and financially preparing for anything from an electrical fix
in which case I'd live with the low compression for awhile, to a top end
rebuild, to a total rebuild.  And if the clutch and gearbox need attention,
those will be rebuilt as well.

If the engine comes out and apart, any recommednations for reliability
or performance modifications that I should consider?  This is primarily an
unplanned expense, but I might as well as turn it into an opportunity to
improve the reliability, drivability and performance of the car.

One last question.  If I decide to try to sell it and cut my loses, what
would a fair asking price be?  1970 911 T, power sunroof, clean 
interior-brown, some cracks in black padded dash, alloys, black 
exterior (originally brown), body is very good, paint is nice.  With a 
little interior work, some elbow grease on the paint, and a little detailing
it will be a really sharp car, with a potentially very bad motor.

Sorry for the length of this, any advice is appreciated.  As you can
see, tires and suspension mods are not at the top of my list at
this time.

I sent a message to the Porschephiles group a while back and was very 
(pleasently) surprised at the response.  I must have received 50 replies. 
Since then, I have found out that we don't have a true connection to the 
Internet.  I am communicating via an X.400 connection to Sprintmail using a 
LAN connected PC.  My company (not Excellence, the real job) is buying the 
hardware right now to allow me to have a true Internet connection.  That is 
scheduled for early '93.  In the mean time, I have a 1976, 914. It's a 
yellow 2.0 liter.  It's very stock; the only thing I have done to it is 
to take off the air pump. I use it for Porsche club driving events (rallies, 
autocross, and track) and it runs very well considering its age. 

FYI, the editor of Excellence wants me to do some research for a possible 
story in the magazine on this group.  I bought a book called THE WHOLE 
INTERNET USER'S GUIDE & CATALOG so I can ask the right questions.  Would 
you guys mind if we did a story like that?   

If you want to communicate to me, just reply to the address as it appears in 
my message to you.  That is an X.400 address and SprintMail should be able to 
find me.

We get an Australian version of Excellence magazine in Australia
(which seems to be pretty much the American version with some
Australian ads).  I find that because of all the ads it is good if you
are into repairing or modifying your Porsche, but as that is not my
scene I only sometimes flick through it at the newsstand (oops! - I
mean I see the front cover).

I think an article on Porschephiles would be good, and I hope that
it would mention the international nature of the Internet, allowing
me to communicate with anyone in the world on the network pretty well
instantly.

Your address was actually just a bunch on X.400 guff, not an address,
so this is being posted back to the newsgroup.  I hope it will be passed

Well.......

A main question is the amount of rust (if any) that the car has.  It
has a sunroof, so that's a plus...

Since the motor is tired, the resale will be quite low, mainly due
to the cost of rebuilds.  That typically scares people away....
Also, since it is a 'T', they don't demand lots of $$$ (even though
I love them because they are 'cheap to keep' & have good performance/$$
ratios!!!). My '72 Targa (2.4 ltr) is great fun and is much easier to drive
and gets me in lots less trouble than my Very quick '73 911S I used to
drive!!(but I still miss it- to bad its in a collectors wharehouse in
Tokyo... Oh well.....).



I would say its worth anywhere from $2500-$4000 given its current
state of tune.  This is dependent on what part of the country
you are located in.

Please contact me directly, as I am looking for a car that I can use for
PCA Club racing (if it has no rust.... I've had an early car with cancer-
repaired it and found out it's LOTS of WORK!!!!  Never again, unless
it's a '65 356 convertible!!!).  I might be interested in it.  Also, I've got
a '69 911 'E' motor in good shape I might want to sell for $1200-1500.

Good'ay,

This seems like a lot of expense to me.  I had a place called
'Gas Tank Renu' completely strip, repair, and re-surface (inside and
out) my 912 gas tank for $175.00.  The inside/outside was blasted, rust
repaired, and a new set of coatings baked on.  No additives in
the gas will affect the coating (gumout, etc.).

The whole process took 4 days and now it looks like new!  My car had
been stored with gas in it for 12 years, so you can imagine the
amount of sludge/varnish I had in the tank.  I'd recommend
this to anybody given my experience.  It comes with a lifetime
nation-wide warranty.  Hemming's usually has an advertisement with
a list of the dealers nation wide.

Subject: Rainy Road Atlanta

Peachstate PCA held their final driver's school of the year at Rd.
Atlanta this past weekend -- it rained or drizzled the entire weekend
(this morning it's puffy clouds and blue skies... :-().

This was my first real heavy duty exposure to high performance driving
in the wet. I'd had a wet morning at Savannah about 9 months ago, but
that was only two sessions. Due to my experience at Savannah, I was
dreading the rain (I had spun twice that morning...). It turned out to
be _very_ educational and, to my surprise, enjoyable.  Driving in the
wet reenforces all the lessons you've ever learned about smooooothness.
It teaches car control up the wazoo.  Half of my sessions seemed to be in
light drizzle with little or no standing water on the track -- the other
half in moderate to heavy rain with lots of standing water (always
exactly where you want it least (braking zone and apex of 1, apex of 7,
offline in the back straight (making passing somewhat interesting), the
dip, midway through the turn-in to 12 and the apex of 12).

There were surprisingly few off track excursions. A race-prepared Saturn
lost it in 7 (scraped up the driver's side door panel and front quarter
panel -- it's all made out of plastic! The driver estimated $200 in
repairs -- if it had been my 951, I'll bet it would have been an easy
$3000!), a couple of 911's lost it coming out of 12 (minor fender
benders), a 944 spun in 7 (similar damage to the Saturn, but the scrapes
and dents are more permanent (the drawbacks of sheet metal)).  I had the
honor of losing my concentration in 3 and missing the apex by a foot and
a half and sliding right off the track. I must have slid for 75 or a 100
feet.  No spin -- the velocity vector was exactly 90 degrees off the
normal direction of travel: Georgia red clay is slicker than ice!
Fortunately I didn't hit anything (I stopped about 5 feet short of the
trees) and all that was damaged was my ego.

In the afternoon, due to incoming thunderstorms and threats of tornadoes
(in November?), groups 4 (advanced) and 5 (instructors) were combined. I
had been pretty pleased with my driving -- In group 4, I was passing
more cars than were passing me.  When we got mixed in with 5, it was
clear I was in over my head.  I got passed by a 930 in the back straight
with a speed differential of >40mph. My hand was getting cold from all
the passing signals I was giving... Knocked the ego down another notch
or two.

Despite all that, for the most part the event was uneventful and highly
educational. I've gained a new respect for my street tires (D40m2's --
my R1's have practically no tread left -- I decided not to push my luck.
I never regretted it. In the rain, the Dunlops performed really well).

Can't wait till the next event (Sebring in January or Savannah in
February).  Hope it's dry!

I've had this exact problem in several cars.  Check the door panel - 
it's probably coming in through that.  What happens is rain gets into 
the door (normal), but the plastic sheeting inside is out of place or 
torn, so the water runs into the interior instead of out the drainholes

They're all lying."

I did a test day in October up at New Hampshire International  
Speedway where it was just slightly drizzling--enough to keep the  
track soaking wet, but not enough to put on the rain tires.  I spent  
over 3 hours on the track in 3 separate sessions (about 130 laps),

Subject: Welder Recommendations...


Many of the tool catalogs carry wire-feed (gas or no-gas) mig-welders.
I have some experience with the Snap-On gas mig-welder with heat
and wire speed adjustments - both totally adjustable.

However, my budget cant handle $1k for a welder of this caliber.  What
it can affort is the $225 welders in the catalogs.  The biggest differences
are:  1)  use flux-coated wire (i.e. no gas), 2) only 3 or 4 heat settings
instead of a dial with unlimited settings.  Note:  I do have unlimited
adjustment of wire feed speeds.

Does anyone out there have any experience with one of these $225
wire-feed non-gas welders?  

My primary purpose for the welder will be to weld in sheet metal
such as rockers, etc.  All thin gauge metal, no frame restorations
on Buicks, etc.


Any insights/recommendations would be much appreciated!

My personal observations from experience:

Don't bother with the cheap stuff - the good stuff is ALREADY hard to use.
I got a welder that lists for $1200, used, for $500, and it is really
nice. Side-by-side comparisons against these $225.95 no-gas welders leave
no doubt at all - the cheep ones are not worth the money. So point one is,
check the want ads - you may be able to get the nice stuff at a price you
can afford.

#10 welding glass is just about impossible to see through when the arc isn't
active. I got a piece of #9, and with a bright drop light I can actually see
where I am about to deposit molten metal...

Don't skimp on safety, regardless of price. MIG, arc, etc. welders emit hard
UV in sufficient quantity to give you the nastiest sunburn you ever came
across in damned short order. I had a small hole in my pants, now there's a
small hole in the skin where that hole was... AND I now have a full set of
welding leathers. Get the full set: sleeve, bib, leggings, and especially
gloves. Use a proper welding helmet - must go back to at least your ears.
Don't let your hair hang out, either.

Make sure that there are no exposed flamables in the area you are welding - 
plenty of opportunity exists for them to ignite. Have an extinguisher, pin
pulled, handy to use at a moment's notice. Also a hose is a good idea.
Point two: it's  your life and your equipment: safeguard it through adequate
precautions.

On technique: it's damned hard to figure out what feed and current settings
to use. Experiment on pieces of similar stock before you take the welder
to your precious car. Try to get a feed rate that is controllable in context,
and then fiddle the current until you get a nice crackling sound, but without
too much slag. Too much current simply fries the workpieces, too little makes
a poor weld. Also, recognize that the heat involved will warp your workpieces.
The best approach there that I have found is to 1) cut away all rust, 2) cut
the replacement piece to overlap about 1/4" on all edges, 3) sand blast the 
edges lightly to get a good clean slightly rough surface, 4) tack weld the
piece on at all sides in about 3 spots, to keep it from warping, and 5) run
the finish bead around all the edges. Then grind down the bead until it doesn't
stick up too badly. Use filler for the final smoothing, as grinding the weld 
down too far will weaken it. Point three: take your time, if you do it well
it's permanent.

as you can.  They have second-hand stuff for sale, esp. larger tools
which mechanics trade in for even larger variants.  I just missed getting
a lower tool chest last week for $600, but have my order in for the next
one which comes along.

Cheers to John L for his safety recommendations.

Subject: 914 Motor mounts followup

[Hmmm, sent this off to porschephiles last week but I don't think it
made it out...]

Date: Tue, 17 Nov 92 22:34:17 PST

I'm the one who asked last week about the front engine mounts in my
914.  I successfully replaced them this weekend.

Jacking up the engine while leaving the big mounting bar in place was
the perfect way to do it.  Btw, when I sent my first message I didn't
know that the early cars had different mounts; mine (the late style)
are the hockey pucks with studs on the ends that go between the motor
and the big mounting bar.

I had to remove a lot of the heating ducting (and the oil filter!) to
get access to the top nuts of the mounts, although three or four hours
of figuring out how to get a socket on those #$%$@& nuts (while
getting extremely dirty) is still a lot easier than dropping the whole
engine...

By the way, the mounts aren't exactly "hockey pucks with studs through
them"...  They're more like capacitors (for you EE types), in that
there are thin steel disks on the top and bottom (with studs welded
on), and a thick chunk of rubber between the disks.  The rubber is
bonded to the plates somehow, but there's no metal connection between
the two ends of the mount!

In fact, with my old mounts, there was no connection at *all* between
the ends of the mounts :-(   The rubber had pretty much turned to mush,
and the mounts both had come apart, so the engine was only being held
down to the front bar by gravity.  Guess this explains the clunking
sounds and the shift lever movement...

Thanks to John Colasante, Stan Hanks, Mark A. Skala, Jeff Shorey, and
Frank Kerfoot for your help...

Subject: engine rebuild


Mark, I sympathize with your problems.  Yours is, thankfully, a pretty
rare case amongst used 911 buyers, since they are practically
indestructable (except from rust) - but it sounds like you got screwed
by some desperate people.

No matter what is wrong with your car it can be fixed.  I know
quite a bit about that particular model of 911, and I'm afraid what
you describe could be any number of things. It would be impossible for
anyone to really diagnose the problem over email.  You have to be
there.

The good news is that the electrical system in that car is simple.
Overly simple.  Buy a Haynes and check out the wiring diagram, there
aren't that many parts to it.  if what you have is an electrical
problem, completely replacing every electrical part wouln't cost more
than a few hundred, and checking all the connections won't take more
than a few hours.

If you still have low compression that's not an electrical problem,
obviously. However, it might be a simple "top-end".

Any performance increases will detract from reliability, as a rule.
If people suggest removing the Zeniths keep in mind this will lower
the value of the car - anything that changes it's originality will
lower its value.  The only reliability upgrades that come to mind that
won't really affect the value are the pressure-fed tensioner update
and re-jetting the Zeniths (which fixes an overrun problem they have).

With the engine problems you describe, I would say the car is worth
$200, and I'll buy it.

Actually, $4k is probably fair, assuming minimal rust.  Note if you
care to take the time it is probably worth at least $6-8K in parts.

My advice to you: if you haven't joined the PCA yet, join.  Then get
in contact with the local region and find out the trustworthy shop to
go to in your area, or if your region has a tech committee that might
have someone on it that can help you.

   John,
	I'm not sure I see the connection between spinning and warping your
   trunk hinges.  Do you mean to imply that the forces created because of the
   spin caused enough stress in the body/frame to warp the hinges?  If so, I
   would most likely tend to suggest that it was forces generated due to the
   high GRIP (PRIOR to the spin) that caused the warping.  Unless you hit
   something or went over some really rough terrain sideways?

Since the centrifugal force of his spin was enough to cause his
fillings to fly out of his mouth - piercing his own cheek and flying
into the crowd of spectators like machine-gun fire (three were
hospitlized) - I would say that is what caused the trunk hinges to
warp.  Also, I don't think sitting on the trunk between run-groups helped.

The recent 911 electricals email reminded me I should "ask the
reflector" about my problem.  My 83 911SC euro with >214K miles, never
wrecked, never touched the engine or major peripherals, is not starting on
infrequent occasions.

Symptom is turn the key to start and nothing but the faint whir of the
fuel pump.  It starts easily with a short push, roll, and pop clutch
in reverse or 2nd.  Generally in great shape otherwise.
This happens in hot and cold weather and always when least expected.
I've tried the obvious, new battery, different key switch (per my
mechanics suggestions).

Yesterday I noticed a very slight delay when turning the key to start
before the starter begins.   Then last night it refused to start again
after cooperating for a couple of months.  This has been going on for
6 months or more now.  It just hasn't been annoying enough to shell
out for a new starter and all, but I may be reaching the annoyance
threshold soon.

Any ideas anyone.

Thanks,
Rich

Subject:      New super-lubricant?

In the past week I have been seeing one of those 30 minute paid
commercials they put on late-night TV advertising a product called:

    DURA-LUBE

It's an engine oil additive/multi-purpose lubricant that makes claims even
grander than Slick-50.  Now, since I am certainly ALWAYS interested in
better lubricants, but also highly sceptical about these types of claims
(i.e. you couldn't get me to use Slick-50 if you GAVE it to me and I
basically swear by Mobil-1), I thought I'd inquire:

    DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT?

In the commercial, they run some "friction tests" the quality of which is
possibly questionable.  They compare directly with Pennzoil, Castrol,
Mobil 1, and Slick-50.  The results - if accurate - would certainly be
very impressive.  At one point they run a 500+ hp engine up to 5000+ rpm
AFTER having drained all the dure-lube treated oil.  Hmmm!  Somebody,
anybody . . . enlighten me?

BTW  It's probably totally unreasonable to expect any of this to be true,
     but I thought I'd ask.  Has anyone else seen this ad?

Check the engine ground strap - the nut that holds it has to be good and
tight. If that's OK, look at the connectors to the starter relay. The
key switch, I assume, is the switch that the actual key actuates. It is
most likely OK - especially if you changed it and it's still happening.
Next time it happens, leave the key in the "on" position and hotwire the
starter solenoid. If it doesn't start then, notice if you get a "thunk",
a "whirr", or "nothing". "Thunk" means bad starter (or seized engine,
but it bump starts so...). "Whirr" means bad solenoid, but you should have
heard that before, it's pretty loud. "nothing" means bad starter or solenoid
or both. Oh, yeah, the nut that holds the power cable onto the solenoid has
to be good-and-tight as well....

I don't know about the newer cars, but I've had this problem on two of my
914s. On the 914: with the ignition on (key turned to ON), If you can short
the starter and get it to run, it's a solenoid problem. If you can't it's
either a connection from the power to the solenoid, or a bad starter. Since
it's intermittent, it seems to me it's either a connection problem or a bad
solenoid. Good luck.

I sat through the same info-mercial on Duralube.  It certainly

impressions worth much is open to debate. 

For what it's worth, my engine builder has suggested that I try Slick
50.  He hasn't done side by side testing but says he's noticed that the
Slick 50 treated engines seem to survive better and show less wear -
and this man specializes in skepticism.  Since I use Redline racing oil

Subject: Re:  911 Electricals sleuth needed


Starter solenoids, as they age, don't move as far as they do when they're new,
and the smaller contact patch this results in for the electrical path
to the starter itself - especially when hot and resistance is high -
does not allow for the proper amount of current to the starter for it
to turn the engine.  Cranking the engine over takes a LOT of work, and
the starter needs all the juice it is entitled to.

If this problem happens mainly when the car is hot the problem is
almost without a doubt the starter solenoid.  Don't get a used one or
an NOS one, get a brand new one.

If your car has an alarm, that causes problems too since the alarm
cuts the amount of current to the starter also.

Of course you should always be sure ground straps connections are
clean and solid, especially the trans->body strap under the car (which
the starter uses) and the battery straps.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Aftermarket springs

A couple of folks recently mentioned noises which started after changing
their factory springs to Weltmeister springs.  They should make sure that
when the springs were replaced, whoever did the work remembered to replace
any washer they may have had between the upper spring plate and the strut
mount (shock bearing).

Porsche apparently started putting these in 944-series cars in '88.  Cars
having them can be recognized by a yellow paint dot on the upper strut
mounting plate, as visible under the hood.  The washer is p/n N.012.233.3.

While doing some routine maintainance on my

brake pads were disintegrated, probably from
being heated at the track. In the process of
replacing them, I accidentally damaged the
rubber boot on one of the calipers. Does anyone
know where I can obtain such a part before
the inside of my caliper get messed up costing
lots of $$$?

This is for a 1988 944.

A little while ago someone mentioned that USA
cars have spacers in the suspension to raise
them relative to European models. I did not see
these in my shop manual(factory version). Does
anyone know where these are?

Thanks loads.

You can by the rebuild kits/parts from Porsche.  They definitely make them,
according to some factory literature I read recently, because is some
countries periodic overhaul of the brakes is mandatory.  Japan was their eg.

There are no spacers.  The front springs are taller, I believe.  I don't
know if different struts and shocks are used.  The rear ride height is
adjustable.

 I am surprised your mechanic did'nt say something like 'drop the starter'
 and crack it open, clean it, check it for wear, and reassemble it with
 FRESH grease and maybe some new parts.
 Rich, I have fixed many a starter, some of them Porsche, simply by 
 cleaning them inside and out, then re-lubing them.

 In the above ^, you give the best clue...the delay in starter operation
 AND clue #2 is the next morning a cold starter that wont go at all.
 
 *Im not a teacher, but hear me please*
 Starters, all starters will exhibit this phenomenon if they suffer from
 normal wear without outright failure.  A starter uses sleeve bearings
 for the shaft and bendix, the solenoid has no bearings- only a bore
 to slide in (and out, you hope).  The problem is age.  As starters age
 the grease in the solenoid bore turns to wax (well, almost), imagine
 particles of a variety of metals combining with grease.  This has the
 overall effect of anti-seize compound, viscous but dry...great for keeping
 bolts from freezing in place, but terrible for a sliding part like a
 linear moving solenoid.
  The result of this is a bitchy starter, might work if its warm, probably
 wont if its cold.  If your lucky, the starter will engage AND disengage
 if it wont disengage it will burn itself up, or wiring or consume the
 battery.  This nearly happened on my 914 on a -10F morning in Iowa, 
 pulling the battery lead was the only way to stop it.  This is what got
 me started on starters, since then I have seen the same aging pattern
 on GM, Bosch, and Ford.  Starters can withstand a LOT of wear, but they
 can't go for long with no lube.

>Any ideas anyone.
>
 Yes, try dropping your starter and treating it to some Tender, Loving
 care.  It is possible to replace the bearings and bendix, and on some,
 the heavy contacts within the solenoid housing.  The contacts take a
 real beating (hundreds of amperes) in normal use, but are designed to
 take it for a reasonable time -214 thousand miles is beyond a reasonable
 time.
 After cleaning, inspect the bendix, hinge points, and armature contacts
 AND BRUSHES
 for wear, if the armature contacts are in bad shape you might be better
 off buying a new starter.  Same is true if the bearings are wallered out
 so bad the case has been eaten.  I think all other wearing parts are
 replaceable, and it does not take a rocket scientist to repair a starter.
  Take care to lightly grease the solenoid piston and sleeve with
 white lithium grease, apply it to the bearings also.
 This will make the unit last another 50 to 100 thousand miles, but for
 peace of mind, TLC the thing at 50K whether or not it needs it.

STOP BEFORE YOU PUT Slick 50 INTO ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT!!!  What follows
is a LONG post summarizing a small portion of an article I read recently
on engine oil additives.  Delete this now if you're not interested in the
topic.

Now that I have your attention, there is a MUST READ article in the
August 1992 issue of Road Rider magazine.  The article is entitled,
"Snake Oil!  Is That Additive Really a Negative?"  I will not retype the
whole article here as it is rather lengthy, however, suffice it to
say that after reading the article I will not let the stuff anywhere
near ANY of my engines.  The article bases it's statements on test results
from the following very reputable research institutions: University of
Nevada Desert Research Center, Avco Lycoming (aircraft engine
manufacturerers), Dupont Chemical Company (the creator of PTFE which is
the main ingredient in Slick 50 and other similar products), North Dakota
State University, Briggs and Stratton (of lawn mower engine fame), the
University of Utah Engineering Experiment Station, California State
Polytechnic College and NASA Lewis Research Center.  Quite an impressive
list.  Each of these institutions spoke out AGAINST using Slick 50 in your
engine.  In fact, ROAD RIDER was unable to find any independent testing
organization that would support the findings that Slick 50 brags about.
When you ask the Slick 50 folks about who did their testing, they will
not tell you.  Here's one quote from the article I think you'll want
to read,

"...  By far the most damning testimonial against these products
originally came from the DuPont Chemical Corporation, inventor of PTFE and
holder of the patents and trademarks for Teflon.  In a statement issued
about ten years ago, DuPont's Fluoropolymers Division Product Specialist,
J.F. Imbalzano said, "Teflon is not useful as an ingredient in oil additives
or oils used for internal combustion engines."

At the time, DuPont threatened legal action against anyone who used the
name "Teflon" on any oil product destined for use in an internal combustion
engine, and refused to sell its PTFE powders to anyone who intended to use
them for such purposes.

After a flurry of lawsuits from oil additive makers, claiming DuPont could
not prove the PTFE was harmful to engines, DuPont was forced to once again
begine selling their PTFE to the additive producers." - ROAD RIDER/August 1992

Here are a couple of the things mentioned in the article as possible failure
modes for Slick 50 style products:

1)  PTFE is a solid.  The additive makers claim this solid "coats" the moving
  parts in an engine.  The article states, however, that, "such solids seem
  even more inclned to coat non-moving parts, like oil passages and filters.
  After all, if it can build up under the pressures and friction exerted on a
  cylinder wall, then it stands to reason it should buid up even better in
  places with low pressures and vitually no friction."

2)  Additive manufacturers will claim that they use "sub-micron" sized
  particles that will pass through your oil filter.  The only problem is
  that, "PTFE expands radically when exposed to heat."  So when your engine
  reaches normal operating temparatures, the particles may not longer pass
  through your filter, but instead will clog it!

The above quotes and data are just small tidbits from an article filled
with such information.  Briggs and Stratton has done testing on it's engines
with and without the stuff and found the an engine using the stuff actually
showed more wear than an engine using conventional motor oil.  Do read
the article.  It does not come out and tell you that you should not use
Slick 50 and other products like it, but it gives you lots of data for
you to make your own decisions.  For example, if I was someone with a
racing motor that was torn down and rebuilt after each race, I might
consider using the product as there are some results that have shown
there to be less friction within the engine, thus resulting in an increase
in horsepower.  Again, read the article and make your own conclusions.
I will not use any Slick 50 style products in my engines, but that is
just my conclusion after reading the article.

Good food for thought.  Happy racing!

Hi,
Thought I'd mention to you P-folks something I learned about power 
steering fluid this weekend.  The "Dexron II compatible" fluid from 
Gunk in the yellow bottles isn't really compatible.  Yes, it "works", 
but then so would motor oil.

My steering rack force was too high and had louder than normal pumping 
/ pressure sounds emanating.  I replaced the Gunk fluid with correct, 
Castol Dexron II and all is perfect once again.

I've used an aluminum based bondo that I got from Sherwin Williams - look for

I agree, the zinc based primer is great.  The reducer for the primer has
something really nasty (phosphoric acid I think) in it that burns like hell if
you get it on you.  The camo-green color you get is kind of interesting...
It wasn't that expensive - spent most of the money on the actual paint and the

About 2 or three months ago Car and Driver did a new radar detector

made by Valentine Research which was started by a guy who used to
work for Cincinnati Microwave.  You should be able to find an add for
it in every issue of Car and Driver and probably most other broad

The STW is shielded so that radar detector detectors (yes they exist and
are becoming more broadly used in places where detectors are illegal) cannot
detect them.

Brakes:
I was thinking a good set for Street/autocross is probably
not going to cut it for the track. Should I go for a comprimise

pad? If so which ones? and how many sets do I need. How much bedding
is required?

Tires:
Should I use my street tires, BFG Comp T/As on 16" or my autox tires
Yokos RSII with about 3/32" tread left on 15" wheels. I also have a
set of A008r with about 3/32" tread, but they are not mounted.
These may be better because they will last longer.


Any other helpful hints to a 1st timer would be greatly appreciated!

(From Service & Parts Management, August, 1990)

If you don't want to spend $891 for a reader, then cut up your microfiche
with a sharp Xacto knife and read it using the small-format reader at your 
local library.

Other suggestions: 
  - Get one of those pocket microscopes from Edmund or the Nature Company.
  - Look in _Pano_ for the ad for the ~$250 refurbished large-format reader.
  - Find a reliable parts guy at your local dealership.  He'll know 
    important parts supersessions and be more knowledgeable and helpful than 
    the microfiche.

Thank you, Kevin, Gary, Skip, Frank, Tony, and Jim.
