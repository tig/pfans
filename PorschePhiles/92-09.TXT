Don -

Sorry to hear of your grief.  If the carbon/kevlars you're using are the Cool
Carbon brand, I can add to your experiences mine.  Basically, it was a new
product as of earlier this year, and the manufacturer has improved the quality
and finish substantially in the last few months.

The first set I got had two major problems.  The rears were missing a squarish
cut-out in the backing plate into which a locking tab from the floating calliper
inserts (this for a Porsche 944).  Simple enough to fix with a die grinder.  The
other problem was a bit of "berm" along the edges, where the pad material meets
the backing plate.  Again, simple to clean up with a grinding wheel.

I picked up a second set before heading out to Watkins Glen a few weeks back,
and both manufacturing problems had been corrected.  I also installed a
different set into a friend's 924GTS, which has 930 rear callipers all 'round -
no problem at all.

It sounds to me like the guy from whom you bought the pads was doing some
modification to the pads to fit your application.  The slits in mine, as well as
all the edges, have no flaws at all.

The pads work really well.  I'm pleased with them on the street, track, and at
auto-x.  In fact, I have had no problems with stone-cold pads on my first auto-x
runs, as I used to even with the OEM pads.

Well, check the date that they shipped- UPS second-day is pretty bad
at times. Another member of the WTW list shipped two crankshafts to a
shop for mods, one by 2nd day air and one by standard ground- and the
standard ground one got there _first_. I use Fedex exclusively
nowadays, after waiting 2 weeks for some second-day-air parts (that I
ran without, just like you. Always happens right before an event,
seems like). Get your money back out of UPS.

This isn't quite right. The gas grooves should ideally be clean and
sharp shouldered, since that's the way that they are made. If they
aren't, then they may have been bashed around in shipping (the
carbon-kevlar friction material is pretty brittle). They should have
been taped together, working face to working face, in pairs.

Now, having said that, I'll say that chipping of the friction material
isn't particularly important. If the chips are less than perhaps 1/2"
I'd still use the pads, without any worries whatsoever- just wait till
you see what they look like when they _come off the car_ after a heavy
weekend of track use (especially on a heavy car with minimal brakes
like my Mustang)! As long as the pad material is still well sintered to
the backing plates, superficial chipping isn't even meaningful, IMHO.

I don't think that you have bad pads. But if you're really opposed to
running them, then get them from somewhere else, and try them. I
suspect that you'll like this material, whether you care for Andy and
his guys or not.  If the dings were created as part of the
manufacturing process, and posed a hazard, I really don't think they'd
have shipped them to you at all.

Well, I've been buying from them for some time, and have had nothing
but good luck- and as the guy who recommended them to the Mustangs
list, I'd like to defend them a bit here. These are good people, real
racing people in the most positive sense of the word. There will
always be good days and bad days, and you may have hit them on a bad
day. Such is life. And if you call them on a weekend, Andy won't be
there- he'll be out racing.

For me, they've turned out pads within 24 hours in the past. I like
'em. Your mileage may vary.

If they had to custom-make your pads, then you own them- that's the
nature of the business. They should have told you that they were
making them, rather than grabbing them off the shelf- but Andy, being
a fallible human being, may have thought he had them when he was out.
And knowing that you were in an all-fired hurry (which is the normal
mode of operation in the racing parts business), he probably turned
them around as fast as he could. In any case, this is one thing you'll
have to resolve with him- he's a reasonable guy. Keep calling until
you talk to him. He'll be there unless he's out testing or something.

You could do that, but I think that you owe it to yourself to try
these pads before you go do all that other stuff. You've got a set
there- put 'em on and run 'em.

I've already done so- but there are other companies that carry them.
The Carbon Kevlar material is a product of Kerr Friction, and the pads
were designed by and are manufactured under license from a company
called Braking Developments. Porterfield calls the Kerr material simply
Carbon Kevlar, or R44. The same material is available under the
CoolCarbon and PowerPad brand names through CC Motorsports, PO box
9240, Huntsville AL (205)882-1756. Check around- it doesn't take that
much research to find what you really want. I for one will be very
interested in hearing how they run on your car- I found them to be
very good under some pretty extreme conditions, both on my Mustang and
on a friend's 308.

One thing to watch out for. On these pads, the bottom of the gas
groove should be used as an absolute wear limit indicator. Under NO
circumstances should you be tempted to run down through the last 2-3mm
of friction material. It is a thermal barrier layer, and whereas its
frction characteristics aren't too terribly bad, its wear rate is
easily 500% that of the actual friction material- so those last 2-3mm
will go _fast_ (perhaps in less than a single session). Mr. Rotor,
meet Mr. Backingplate. Big drama, no fun.

I can strongly recommend VCI in Dover NJ as a supplier of brakes.  Doug Arnao,
the owner, even holds the lap record for his class (I think in a 914) at Lime
Rock.  201-366-7800.  He helped me when I needed track brakes pads for my
944S2 (which seem to be in no catalogs) by realizing that this is the same pad
size as in the 930. 

I purchased the Cool Kevlars and I must say that they STOP the car!  I have to
be careful on the street or the ABS comes on. They really have a high
friction level. At the track they improve as they get hot, so they give me
great confidence.

The literature touts their long life, which may be true when used as a true
track pad.  I drive my 944 every day, as well as at track events.  The front
pads lasted less than 5000 miles, of which there were 6 track days, so I don't
call them very long lasting.  (My previous Ferodo pads lasted about 15000
miles.)  However, I do really like them and just bought another set.

VCI is a good supplier. I have gotten very prompt deliveries, and they are
quite knowledgable.

6 track days? Seems pretty good to me! I used up a set of Repco Metalmasters

Hello fellow Porschephiles.

This is my first post, though I've been reading the mailing list for a
while. I have a 1969 Porsche 912 which I've owned now for about 8
months. I'm finally getting the machine into stable working condition.
This involved among other things a painfully expensive head job,
which, believe me, isn't as much fun as it sounds.

In any case, now that the engine is working, I'd like to begin working
on the cosmetic features. I was wondering if anyone had adresses/phone
#'s of mail order auto supply houses which specialize or handle
Porsche parts.

Thanks in advance for your help. Really do enjoy the mlist.

On my street 911, Repco Metalmasters last less than one year (6 months?)
which includes track events.  Track events are what use up the pads.  In a
true race application, my VW Golf goes through Metalmasters or Ferodo DS-11's
in one hour!  The only difference is that the Metalmaster pads also goes all
the way through the rotor surface.  The carbon metallic (?) pads from
Porterfield last 2 or 3 race weekends.  To me, that IS long life.

As they say, your mileage may vary...

They had a display booth at Tech Tactics last year.  They had a really great
price on 944S timing belts, like $18.00 if memory serves.  Problem was, they
were selling an obsolete part (version .00 vs. the current version .02).  Well,
no disrespect to Doug or VCI; this is pretty common in the aftermarket and you
have to watch out for it.

Btw, unless I am massively mistaken, the 944S2 simply has 944 Turbo (pre-S)
brakes.  The only OEM diff is that Porsche switched pad suppliers to Pagid.  But
any 944 Turbo pad, incl. DS-11's, will fit.  (The '88 944 Turbo S/'89 944 Turbo
takes the same pads as the 962, except shaved from 25 to 19 mm. depth!)

Hi,

I'm pleased to be on the mailing list.

I've got a 1977 Carrera 3.0; the car is equipped with automatic heat
control.  It isn't working properly and I'm thinking of trying to fix it
(now that winter has arrived in New England #) ).  In the past I've had
various opinions as to whether it is worthwhile or not.  The actuator is
currently disconnected from the heat control lever.

The the system failure mode is to "full on", that is, the heat control
lever full up, never to move.


Question 1: I'm under the impression that the system has two sensors,
		one at the top of the windshield, the other somewhere
		under the dash.  Where's the under dash sensor, exactly?

Question 2:  What is the most likely cause of the failure, the sensors
		or the control unit?

Question 3: Is there a "typical" failure in the control unit
		(transistor/diode) that might be "easy" to fix, given
		some proficiency in electronics?

Any help (or war stories) would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Tim

I have one for my Honda and they do make a 911 clip set.  The thing that
is nice is tyhat you buy one rack, then just cjhange clips for each

They're not cheap but they are quite versitile.  FOr my car with a 2

I know that my former auto-x nemesis, Bruce Kennedy, did his with the engine in
the car a few years back.  The car was a 928S.  He's since sold it, at a point
when the transmission needed a significant cash infusion.  I can get his phone

Bdale -

We had an infant seat when our two-year old was just born, and according to my
wife, used it for the first nine months.  It fit fine in the rear of the 944.  A
"regular" size seat would fit into the bucket there now, if we removed that part
of the frame which normally makes the seat level on a more conventional seat.  I
know that friends (Gary and Michele Carr) have done exactly that to get their
little charmer in the 911.  Our unmodified Century certainly fits fine in the
front.

I called PCNA and spoke, if memory serves, with Linda Walker.  She recommended a
Century model but wasn't completely sure it would fit in the rear.  (Why she
recommended it, on reflection, I don't know.)  You might give PCNA in Reeno a
call and see whether they have further enlightened themselves.

Someone wrote an article for Pano a whole bunch of years ago about putting a
kiddy seat in, I suppose, a 911.  They recommended a German company as a source.
I wrote to the company, but never got a reply.

Here's a wild idea, sorta.  OK, the reason we don't put the smallfry in our
normal three-pointers is that the chest belt is too high for them, cutting
across their throat and whatnot.  So, what if you had a competition five- or
six-point harness?  Would junior be suitably secure?  Esp. if you added one of
the new chest straps, the kind that links the two shoulder belts chest-high and
keeps them from separating under load.  One would at least want to child-proff
the latch, I suppose.  Safety notwithstanding, it may also be illegal.  Anyone
tried this?

Please let me know what you learn.

In Colorado, it would be illegal.  The wording is something like "must be

clearly indicate that it has to be something commercial.

I appreciate all of the replies, it's encouraging.  Given the combination of

Subject: more kid seats

we developed quite a collection of infant seats for our 951.  the
one i left in most often was the afore-mentioned century 2000 seat
(metal frame, not molded plastic) with the bottom brace removed and
the rails scrunched in slightly to conform to the bucket.

to keep the thing in tight you need a non-retracting lab belt.  got
ours at the factory - they aren't sold here - but you might be able
to find one on a junked 924 or older 944.

i also make a slit in the seatback to run another belt through for
securing the top.  wrapped it around the top part of the metal frame
and the top of the seatback.  worked very well, was very secure.

it wasn't really intrusive but then again it was never on the driver
side (i'm 6'8").

the german seat someone else referred to was probably either the
rOmer vario by britax.  sold in europe - we bought one near stuttgart;
porsche has one in their euro accessories catalog but it probably isn't
approved here, besides which it's 2X the cost of the same thing w/o
the porsche label in any kid store in germany.

even it needed some surgery to not intrude so much on front seat
passenger space.

kevin mentioned 5 point belts.  i've tried that too - the main thing
here is to get rid of that long stiff thing that prevents the belt
from fastening to the kid's waist.  unfortunately the shoulder belts
tend to go wide of the kid - i used a y rear harness - and i dropped
this idea.

Subject: Re: child safety seats

I've been using kid seats in the back of my '83 944 for about 5 years now.
When I picked out the car seat, I just made sure that the bottom was small
enough to fit into the seat area. The rear seatbelts are just lap belts, so
the child seats are the type that don't need to be attached at the top. As the
older child got bigger, I bought a booster type seat (Cosco, I think) that
mostly fits into the seat (I saw one of these booster seats modified by 
cutting the rear corners off so they fit in a 911 a bit better - I don't know
if it would help the fit in a 944).

Now the older child is 5 and he fits in the back seat quite nice. The younger
one is 3 and he is using the booster seat, but the problem is that his knees
still don't clear the front edge of the seat - this makes his legs stick out 
straight (causing the front passenger seat to be pushed forward, cramping my
wife). It won't be too much longer and he'll be able to go without the booster
seat and we'll be comfortable for a while. 

Unfortunately, shortly after the kids are old enough to reliably behave
themselves at Porsche events, they will outgrow the backseat.

I am considering buying an 86 928S, but there is a couple of concerns

the windshield (about 1 1/2 inches long, 1/2 inch wide). Is this covered
under the rust warranty, and how difficult is this to repair? Also, it
seems the car was driven on some gravel roads, and there are a number
of very fine chips in the paint on the hood and on the fronts of the

Long ago (87ish) when Slick 50 was a 2-part treatment (put in one
liquid, run awhile, put in another liquid for an oil checge) I did my
Euro 911SC.  It has today >210000 miles on it, sounds great, burns no
oil, has good compression all around, and different mechanics tell me
it is still a strong running engine.  The real test comes when I need
to tear it down and can analyze the wear.

DON'T DO IT!!!!

I've had some interesting experience with most of the add-to-oil goop.
They're typically OK for American spec junquers, but the tolerances
are too tight and oil pressures too high on our precious German
metal.

I won't go on the record as to the specifics I've seen, but it 
ranges from a moly-based additive that scored bearings and blew
an engine under race conditions to a synthgoop that blew out 
plugs in the oil galleys as its more like SAE-120 when it's
cold and well, doesn't compress very well 8{(. Also under race
conditions.

I run *straight* SAE 40 in the racing 914s and 10W40 or 20W50
in the 911s. 

If there is something that is making cold starts hard, it almost
certainly isn't the oil.

Subject: Eezi-bleed problem

Due to the high praise the Eezi-bleed (one-man brake bleeder) kit got on
this list, I bought one recently -- yesterday was my first chance to use
it.

It doesn't seem to work very well (at all?).

Brief description of the technique:

   The kit consists of a cap with a hose connected to it that connects
   directly to the fluid resevoir. The other end of the hose attaches to
   a fluid bottle with has yet another hose attached to it which is
   connected to a low pressure (< 20psi) spare tire. The tire pressure
   is supposed to push the fluid out the drain cocks without requiring a
   second person to pump the brake pedal.
   
My experience:
   
   I attached everything as specified in the instructions. I pressurized
   the system and checked for air leaks (there were none). I intended to
   drain most of the old fluid before adding new (in order to minimize
   mixing the two). I squatted down at the brake caliper and opened the
   drain cock and...  Nothing. Or, at least, hardly anything. The fluid
   dribbled out like a moderately leaky faucet.  Aha, I thought! I must
   have a constriction in one of the lines! Maybe that explains the
   pathetic braking... A more like explanation was that 20psi was just
   not enough to push out the old fluid. I closed the cock and pumped
   the brakes a few times and braced the brake pedal forward (to keep
   the system pressurized). This time when I opened the drain cock, the
   fluid rushed out (as I had expected it to in the first place). I
   concluded that my brake lines are fine -- 20psi just isn't enough.  I
   never got to the point where I could add new fluid.

I'm hoping that I'm doing something wrong -- surely the fluid normally
drains faster that it did for me (at the rate it was going, it probably
would have taken >2 hours to just drain the resevoir).  I really do want
to use this thing to routinely bleed my brakes... Is there something
special about my car (a '74 2L 914 -- I'll also want to use it on my '87
951) that would require some extra step not normally required (I doubt
it...).

Advice?

I haven't used the Eze-Bleed equipment per-se, but I use a similar
homebuilt technique where I pressurize the top of the fluid reservoir
directly with about 20 PSI, and I get good flow at the bleeders.
In fact, the biggest potential problem is that it is very easy to
run the reservoir dry (since I don't have the extra fluid supply).
I have used this technique on my (ex) '74 914-2.0 and my current
'87 944S (a pretty close match to your cars) with equally good success.
Based on this, it sounds like the problem with your setup is associated
with the additional fluid reservoir supplied by Eze-Bleed. I would look
for constrictions or other problems there.

By the way, if I am changing the fluid, I start by removing the old
fluid from the reservoir with a turkey baster (no, I don't return the baster
to the kitchen when I am done), and add fresh fluid. Then you only need
to bleed through the equivalent volume of the lines rather than the
reservoir capacity plus the lines.

Re: oil additives...why take the chance.


Mobil 1 and probably other synthetics have properties which make them tend
to stick to engines long after they are turned off... so you are not really
dry starting the engine.

If you are really worried, the way to go is an Accusump.  I use on one my 
race car.  open the valve, and presto, full oil pressure for startup.  
Accusump makes a one quart electrically operated models for street cars which
could be wired to the ignition switch.  Pegasus Racing 414 782 0880 and 
probably others sell them.

It would seem to be a superior solution than risking the effects of additives.

I have had an Eezi-Bleed for about 18 months now.  When I first
bought it, I used it exclusively on my '72 BMW 2002tii.  I thought it
was the greatest thing since portable air tanks (my wife also
appreciated not having to join me in the garage for the late night
bleedings).

I now have a Corrado that sees the track regularly and therefore needs
frequent bleedings as well.  I had the exact same experience you did. 
I just dribbles (barely) for the rear calipers.  It works fine for the
fronts, though.  I haven't figured out a solution yet, except to use it
and get my wife to pump the pedal just for the rears (it's still easier
then without the Eezi-Bleed - constant pressure).  I guess a higher
pressure ( > 20psi ) from the spare tire may work, but I'm hesitant to
risk the brake fluid mess if it bursts.

I just realized something notable.  My tii has drums in the rear, thus
very small brake cylinders compared to the calipers on the Corrado. 
Perhaps, it just doesn't work well on the big calipers that are that
far from the reservoir.

Maybe Frank's tip about his non-reservoir system is the answer.  Use
the Eezi-bleed, but don't fill the big reservoir for doing the rear
brakes. Or maybe, just fill it less.  But, what difference should that
make?  I still confused.

On oil additives - it's snake oil.  Stay away.  the 911Sc motor is
practically indestructible and stories of >200k mis w/o a rebuild
abound.  Whoever it was, your engine survived DESPITE the additives.
Every Porsche expert agrees, this can damage your engine.

On the EZ-bleed problem on a 914 - remember the 914 has a pressure
valve to distribute more fluid pressure to the front brakes, therefore
you're probably not getting the full 20psi of pressure in the back - I
would recommend using higher pressure for the rear calipers only.

Works great!

One warning, though, the vacuum will suck air around the bleed nipple
and make you think there is a lot of air in the lines.  There isn't.

I have also thought of building a home pressure bleeder.  I bought a

Could it be that you both have proportioning valves for the rears that
prevent a mere 10psi from being transmitted to the bleed valves?

Subject: 914 engine work without removing?

I'm thinking of trying to remove a head on a '73 914 1.7 to work on a
valve problem on cylinder #4.  Has anyone successfully removed 914 heads
without going through the whole process of removing the engine?  I've
done the latter, but at this time and with my current working area, I
don't want to remove the engine.
Background: During tuning, I found the idle rougher than it should be, and
pulling plug wires one at a time showed that cyl#4 was essentially not
contributing anything.  Compression check showed about 30psi on that
cylinder but normal on all the others.  I checked the valves on that
cylinder and they did have proper free play at TDC.
  Another day I rigged the compression tester to a friend's air
compressor and pumped air into cyl#4 at TDC.  We even pushed the car a bit
forward and back to be sure I was at TDC (I wasn't about to remove
valve covers at that time).  The result was significant air out of the
intake manifold and the crankcase vent.  As a sanity check we also did cyl#1,
and it was essentially tight on intake, exhaust pipe, and crankcase vents.

So the conclusion is maybe I have a valve problem and a ring problem on cyl#4.
Arguments to this conclusion are welcome.  I'm hoping that it is possible
to slightly lower the right side of the engine, remove sheet metal and
heat exchangers to get the head out.  Thanks for any help.

As I remember the 914 has a brake balancing valve on the rear fire wall. This
valve may be the source of your slow bleed. 911's do not have a brake balancing
valve and would not exhibit the problem.

I removed the brake balancing valve when I converted to BMW brakes on the front and 914 front brakes on the rear. The Eezi-bleed works fine on my 914 and 911 but I don't have a balancing valve to contend with.

Subject: 66 911/912 cv boot

The list sure drifted down memory lane re Nadella half shafts.

Since the car in question has rubber boots, we know it does not have the
U-Joint (Nadella) half shafts.  My guess is it has been retrofitted with
the 67-68 CV joint.

If my memory serves me:

  1. There was one type CV joint used from 67-68 on the short wheel base cars, 
     and a different type from 69 to 71 when the rear wheels were moved
     back a bit. 

  2. The boot on the 67-68 CV was of a size compatible with VW,
     the later CV used a larger boot.  I have only worked on
     the 69 and 72 CV's.  I suspect the 67-68 mounting bolts are
     a VW part number and the 67-68 CV joints and 69+ are not
     mounting flange compatible. 

  3. Usually you want to inspect the CV joint for wear, so
     complete removal and disassembly of the axle is in order.

  4. I have never heard of any supplier for an aftermarket split 
     boot to do a quick repair.  Maybe the service is too severe.

  5. Tools needed are a 6mm hex allen for the cv joint boots,
     circlip pliers.  

  6. I have never tried to fit both boots from one end. 
     It should be possible.

Going back to memory lane, didn't one of the early UPFIXIN' books
detail a machining procedure for the U-joint type axles to make them work
with American U-Joints?   Seems like that would save some of that 
"Black Forest" platinum for catalytic converters or spark plugs.

Subject: Allignment questions

I have a question for any resident racers out there:

Several months ago I had the camber adjusted from -1 to -2 degrees on the
rear of my 911sc.  Both the auto-x and street tires had been wearing 
faster on the outside than the inside.

When I got the car back, it seemed like the right rear corner (fender)
was slightly higher than the left.  My parking area is not level (or
flat), and the difference was subtle, but I had never noticed it before.

I still think it is high and what I have noticed since then (again, I
had not noticed this effect before) is that the right rear tire locks
before the other 3.  Tire pressures have been checked and I feel the
differences are not sufficent to account for the problem.

My dilemma is that I would expect the low corner to be the lightly loaded
corner and lock up first.  However, the high corner is the one locking 
first.

I had the camber adjustment made when the new sticky tires were mounted.
The new tires are bfg r1's (rr compound (204?)).  The old ones were the
yoko a008rs's.  I **never** noticed the lockup problem prior to the new
tires and allignment.  I also did not notice a high corner prior to the
new tires and allignment.  Oh yes, the corner is high with my street 
tires too.  One more note, this is straight line braking.

I last flushed the brake system about a year ago, pedal is hard, 
pads are all there, etc.

Can anyone explain the symptoms I've described?


On the brighter side, I put in a set of Weltmeister sway bars before the
last auto-x.  It's like a different car!  I installed 22mm bars front 
and rear, the front is set at about 65% of max stiffness, the rear at 
about 40% of max stiffness.  I can still lift to oversteer, but 
understeer is reduced and everything just plain works better.

If you have a high voltage, then you raise the temperature of your
battery. You run the risk of boiling fluid out of your battery (even
if it's a sealed battery). Besides being unhealthy to the battery, the
battery fluid vapor is corrosive and can wreck your finish.

Try this: After running your engine for a while, place your hand on
top of your battery.  If it is the slightest bit warm, you could be
doing damage.

My first thought would be the opposite; The higher corner would be less
loaded. Weight balancing of a street car is a matter of balancing each
diagonal. (Front-to-rear and side-to-side cannot be balanced without moving
weight around in the car.) My suggestion would be to put the car on a level
surface and measure the fender opening heights. Then sit on each front
fender and remeasure the height. Each front fender should dip a roughly
equal amount (certainly within a 1/16" of each other). There is an
adjustment bolt near the end of each front torsion bar to make any
corrections. This worked well with a '77 911S that I used to own. The basic
idea is to load up the front torsion bar (with the adjustment bolt) so that
a fixed incremental weight (you sitting on the fender) will cause an equal
deflection on each side of the car. Sitting on the rear fenders would also
work (if you didn't keep sliding off) but the springs are much stiffer and
the relative deflections would be less (harder to measure accurately).

You should probably also remeasure the fender opening heights after any
adjustment to ensure that the car is flat side-to-side and slightly nose
down in front (not sure how much - depends on amount of gas in tank). If
the side-to-side height (with you sitting in the driver's seat) is not
correct then you need to adjust one of the rear torsion bars and rebalance
the front (this can require dismantling your rear suspension for earlier
cars, at least through '77). The nose down adjustment can be done easily
using both front torsion bar adjustment bolts.

Hope this helps.

Urk. Don't do it. If you just have to have the replica, please
use the VW engine. Let's put it like this: it can cost over
$8k just to get the right parts together for a 356 engine, if
you don't have anything to start with. If you can buy a used
engine for say $2k, you may or may not need to spend up to $10k
for a by-the-book rebuild.

Besides, most of the kits I know about are basicly on the VW pan,
so you have the right fittings for a VW engine. Which you can 
buy in bone-stock form for about $600 or way-built-out and ready
to cruise for under $2k.

Subject: High Battery Voltage


A hot battery is caused by high current flow into the battery. High voltage
can cause a high current flow. It is also true that the high voltage may not
cause high current, especially if there is a poor electrical connection some-
where in the system.

I would recommnend that you verify the 14 volts at the battery post with an accurate voltmeter before you do anything. A Fluke DVM is more than accurate enough
to measure 13.2 volts which is the most the battery voltaOOPS

The charging system should apply no more than 13.2 volts at the battery posts.
I would guess that the qauge is more likely to be reading incorrectly than the
charging circuit is over charging. Testing for a hot battery is a good indicator
but there could be some arguement about how much is to hot.

seems like the car is getting hard to start if i let it sit 5-7 days. it
seems like the battery isn't holding a charge well. i'm wondering if
this is related to the alternator start-up behaviour i'm seeing, or if
i'm just due for a new alternator/battery.

if it matters, the battery is about 5 years old, from the stamp in the

	I have seen a rotary 914 conversion in progress, but not complete.
The engine fits better than the original!  A 13B is about the same length as
a VW/Porsche four, but only about 1 1/2 feet wide!  The version I saw had a
rather unique intake setup with a 48mm DeLorto (sp) sidedraft hanging
directly off the side.  In most engine compartments there is no room for
this and the carb sits on top, but in the 914 you could stand next to the
engine!  Supposedly flow is better with this and horsepower is marginally
improved over the normal DeLorto setup.  This means he was looking at about
215 streetable horsepower and a life of about 60,000miles if he abused the
engine!  Also, to make the conversion just that much better, Racing Beat
makes a Rotary to VW transaxle adaptor plate and clutch/flywheel setup!  I 
don't konw where the radiator/oil cooler was going, but it was up front 
somewhere.
	Sorry, I know this is supposed to be a Porsche list, but I LOVE

Subject: Re: 914/4

[executive summary: it is possible to get long life and high performance
out of air cooled engines. it's easier to do with water cooled engines.
it's expensive and you may be constrainted from doing what you need to
by rules of your racing organization. this is a long posting.]

Ghost Racing is currently running 3 autocross cars, and 4 road race
cars. The road racers are an ITB Scirroco, an ITA 914 2.0, an SSC
MR-2, and an EP 914. The autocross cars are two 914s, one CS and one DS,
plus an FP 911. Since the autocross cars are basicly indestructable
due to the load demands and single-lap of under a minute nature of autocross,
I'll not talk about them. The road racers have been an interesting learning
experience. I also crew/engineer for an IMSA 911 GTU team.

The aircooled engines have lots of advantages -- no water plumbing
to go wrong, no water jacket to keep you from hearing things going
wrong inside the engine, generally speaking, less hassle. However,
they simply don't have the durability of the water cooled engines.

In my opinion, there are two contributing factors: the fact that the
water cooled engines have iron blocks or cylinder sleeves, and the
fact that they are better cooled. The MR-2 has gone 18 races, including 
the Runoffs last year, several driving schools, and a few autocrosses, 
without being rebuilt. Still solid as a rock. The Scirroco hasn't been
as lucky -- a mis-machined head took it down, but nothing else had
to be done. As long as the engine was coming apart, we did look at the
bottom end, but it was fine, as were the pistons/cylinders.

Given that, why do anything with aircooled engines? Well, the answer
is that I'm either crazy, or maybe just crazy about air cooled engines.
I like the challenge. And I do this not to race, but to race *PORSCHES*.
The watercooled Porsches are a nightmare. We have a new team member
joining us who has a 944GTR. I'm not looking forward to having to
figure out how to support some of the wierdness in that....

On the 914 2.0 engine, it is built in a manner which should keep
me from having to pull it but once a year for a checkup. But the
cylinders do tend to distort over time, and there is pronounce wear
of the wrist pin hole over time. Not to mention the head wear. I chose
to minimize a lot of those problems by lower compression than one might
choose, and a 2x overkill oil cooling system and accusump. We won't know 
if it works until oh, say  this time next year, right?

On the EP engine, which is basicly a 1.8 L on megasteroids, we get about
20-25 hours of engine life. Then we typically get to replace some major
component. You can count on having head work done, maybe chucking the
heads. You can count on a new flywheel. You can usually re-use a crank
twice. Rods get checked every time. Re-bushing is normal, but if the
big end has to be re-sized, you toss the rod and start over. Pistons/
cylinder sets are almost always required. Case work *may* be required,
and that usually means a new case. This all gets pretty expensive,
but hey, we all knew that racing wasn't cheap, right? (we *did* all know
that, didn't we? we spend about $2k per car per year just on tires. think 
about it really, really hard before you non-racer types out there decide
you gotta have that wheel-to-wheel rush...) Internal cost on a full
rebuild, replacing say $1k of parts is about $4k. If you don't "own" a
race engine technician (we have one who is factory trained) it's a lot
more expensive. (Maybe I should mention that Ghost Racing is me, two
stock brokers, a master machinist and this Porsche factory trained racing 
engine master technician. We share some costs, we jointly own some cars
and lots of infrastructure. We're not a business -- yet -- but a collection
of individuals doing our thing and having fun.)

Now, as I've mentioned last time, you can obviate some of the air cooled
problems. If you use a SCAT forged billet counterweighted crank, for instance 
(suggested retail about $1k) and a set of Carrillo rods (suggested retail 
about $900) and a SCAT billet camshaft (suggested retail about $400) and 
then microbalance everything, and have the "fifth stud" case conversion
done, along with bearing saddle shuffle pins, (probably another $1k),
you'll have something that is illegal as hell for SCCA, but just the
ticket for building a solid, reliable bottom end for a 914. Also, use
a SCAT pump with 40mm gears for the oil system, or even better, go to
a dry sump system (don't know which dry sump pump system is best yet--
still underevaluation). I'd guess that if you don't explode something
into the oil stream that you could get close to 100 hours out of such
a setup. Then you'd get to toss the aluminium parts and start over
with a new case. They should be able to bury you with the SCAT crank
and Carrillo rods unless they're taken out by metal shavings in the
oil.

The top end, you're just screwed on. Running at > 9:1 compression, you
*WILL* crack the heads around the spark plugs. Fortunately, it's
relatively easy and cheap ($60/crack) to repair. I've sent several
heads off for this, and am now even evaluating a new service provider.
I'll have those heads back this week, and can comment further then.

The pistons and cylinders should just be considered expendable. Now, if
you want to run high compression, like 12:1 or so, you'll need to
get a set of Arias or Venolia pistons *made* for you. If you don't want
anything too weird, they probably have the prints laying around from
having done this for someone else. And, after getting them, you have
to just face that you will be luck to get two rebuilds out of them.

I keep mentioning cooling, oil, and related topics. The truth is that
the "air cooled" Type IV and 911 engines are at least partially oil
cooled. Cooler oil == longer engine life, unless it's too cool, then
you have other problems. I use front-mounted oil coolers, with 185 degree
thermostats just ahead of the oil cooler. In many instances, just running from
the middle to the front of the car will radiate enough heat to cool things
pretty well, without the oiler. 

Filtration is really, really, really important. Don't ever put on a deep
sump or mini-deep-sump kit. They will require that you give up the strainer
screen around the oil pump pickup. Bad move. Instead, use an accusump, which
also acts as a passive raditor for cooling oil. For a filter, be very
careful about your choices. Most off-the-shelf filters have pressure-activated
bypasses so that they don't blow up under say 6 bar pressure at 7000 RPM
(which is btw, about what a 911 will produce). This is why the screen in
the sump is soooo important. Or, you use something like a System One
or a Canton/MECA filter. Neither of these have bypasses, both flow oil
with 100 micron filtration at up to 8 bar or so, and have relatively
low impedance to flow.

For 914's I get an adapter plate that screws on where the oil filter 
usually goes, and run hoses to the front of the car. There I locate
the oil cooler, thermostat, high-pressure filter and accusump. At least
some of this goes into the front trunk area. Which also means that changing 
oil just got a little more complicated. In addition parts all over the car,
to really, really do it right, you get to flush the hoses, cooler, and 
accusump with denatured alcohol every time. If you blow something up,
you have to do that anyway. And of course, you replace the element in
the high-flow oil filter, too.

That's about it for now. Hope I answered your questions.

Owner's manuals are available from a variety of after-market sources, and I see
them advertized all the time.  Performance Products lists them in their catalog,
for example.  Some of the manuals are original, some are repro.

I am pretty sure you can also get them from the Factory, if not from PCNA. 
Prescott Kelley said, a couple years back, that if you have an obscure vintage
Porsche and lack a manual for it, the Factory will provide you one if they have
any left over.  He told us that cleaned them out of a number of manuals,
literature buff he is.  It's really interesting to see the "owner's manual"

These cars are running about 12 to 1 compression. venolia or arias pistons,

between engine overhauls.  the transmissions are quite trick... special 
ratios, custom gears, special hardening, reinforcing of internals etc. they
put out around 150hp out of 1600cc.  these are made to go the season between

Jim, I have a 1980 928, I believe the alternator was upgraded to a 450
Amp in 1984 928 model.  When the conditions that you just described
happened to myself I upgraded to the New 84 type alt.  Haven't had a
charging electrical problem since.  The newer alts are a bit more
expensive, I think I paid around $350.00 (big emphasis on "think") for
the upgraded model and installed it myself.

BTW a little trick that I learned about battery connector corrosion
is; Take a couple of copper pennys and super-glue them to the top
of your battery, the pennys will collect the corrosion before the
battery terminals.  You might get dinged in the concours though :).

Interesting bit of trivia on the 928 battery location.  The battery
was not only placed there for weight balance issue but to also 
dampen the vibration given off by the transmission.

Good Luck

The insurance settlements are such that I might as well add a few $K

ad weeklies, Pano, dealers), but there aren't that many to choose from.
Any leads to an '87-88 924S would be greatly appreciated.  Cars should

and high mileage ( >85K ) are disqualifiers.  I currently know about one
in Pawtucket, RI (NorEaster), one in Pittsburgh (Pano), and one in 
Northern VA (Heishman's).

I'd also like to know of any shops in Pbgh or VA (or in the locale of an
available car that you tell me about) that could do a thorough pre-purchase
inspection in case I go that far to get one.

Lastly, I'm making the 931 available to anyone who wants to fix it up.
Although the driver's door and rear quarter were hit, the car is drivable
(I've been using it for about two weeks now).  Platinum, rear disks, recent
turbo and clutch, > 110K miles.  I'm looking for $1500 (insurance is

Guilty. Have put roll bars in two cars, full cages in 3, and have tube
framed 1.5 (one already had part of a frame).

GT-2 == full tube frame, or at least damn close. Best advice: go and have
a look at someone's GT-2 or for that matter GT-3 914. Without the skins.
You're typically looking at 200 hours of labor, and about $3500 in metal.
Just for the frame/skin mounts/suspension mods.

I was fortunate to be able to take some time off last week and visit
Lime Rock Park while the PCA Club Racing circus was in town.

I was not an entrant, but went to help out with timing and scoring.

Honestly, I was skeptical that the program would be either interesting
or long-lived, but I have since changed my tune.  This stuff is a blast.

It's been a long time since I attended an event in which I was really
interested in the outcome.  The difference here is that I know these
people; they have attended our events or we have attended their events
with them.  So, you care a bit more about the drivers.

The event was well organized, starting and finishing on time (Lime Rock
is operating under severe scrutiny from the local town, so we knew that
the finish time was certain...) and with a minimum of confusion as
to who had to do what, where....

We got a chance to see all kinds of Porsches running, including a couple
of 924 Turbos that were quite fast.  FTD and overall 1st was taken by
Nick Ventura of Metro New York in his 914-6 (somewhat modified, to include
a 962 twin-turbo engine, killer brakes, etc. - We call it the Batmobile).
Other cars of interest was a 944 Turbo Cup car and a full-race 944 Turbo
(nicknamed the Beast).

Only one incident with damage: a 914-4 put two wheels off at trackout from
the downhill turn, rotated 180 degrees, and backed across the track to
impact the tire wall at the inside of the track.  Mostly sheet metal
damage and the driver was unhurt...

Alan Friedman (PCA Racing Guru) stated that there were 10 races scheduled
for next (compared to 4 for this year).

If you get a chance to see it at your local track, make sure you do so...

I noticed that in Anderson's book that a good 911 compression
is between 130-170psi.  But considering that a turbo has a low
compression ratio of 1:7.5 vs. a recent one of about 1:9,
would the reading for a 930 be always below that of a 911.

The reason I ask is because I'm looking to buy an '82 930
and got a reading for 125-135psi for all the pistons.

Relative compression between the cylinders is more important
than absolute value, they should be within say 5-10% of each-
other.

A leakdown test will pinpoint any problems.

Don't overly concern yourself with these numbers because 
they sound OK for a US turbo.

I am planning on having the gearbox in my 914 rebuilt during the off-season,
and installing a limited slip while I'm at it.

called Force Racing that specializes in 914 gearboxes for autocrossing.  Are
their mods legal for Street Prepared?  What do they do that's special?  (I
will ask them the same questions, but if I hear it from you it won't be from
a salesman.)  Can anyone recommend a better place?  How much should this
cost?

What about limited slips?  As far as I know, a real Torsen isn't available
for the car, but a Quaife is -- as is a standard clutch-pack.  Of course,
the clutch pack is only a few hundred dollars, while the Quaife is around
$1500.  Is it worth that much more money?  Why?

Does anyone have any clever shift linkage mods for the side-shifter 914
gearbox that might help to make shifting less vague?  All new linkage
bushings and a short-shift kit made a HUGE difference, but it's still not
great...

Thanks for any help.

While you've all go your compression reading thinking caps on,
maybe you can offer me some advice.  I'll try to keep this short.

I bought a 1970 911T about 2 months ago from a Porcshe garage.
It was a customer car they were selling.  The car appeared to meet
my price/condition criteria.  It also came with about $4000 of
receipts done in the last three months from this same shop.  I
asked the shop to do a pre-purchase inspection  of the car for
me (which I paid for) including a compression test prior to my
purchase.

The shop made a recommendation to buy, and gave me compression
readings of 135-150 psi.  This is written down on a work order.

Approx 100 miles and 5 days later #4 cylinder quit firing.  Another
shop did a compression test and got reading of 115-125, with #4 at
70.  I called the shop I bought the car form and immediately returned
the car for their analysis.

One month later I picked up the car.  They found that the "black box"
in the ignition had shorted and was bypassed, resulting in weak ignition.
I pointed out that I didn't see how that effects compression, but their
compression test yielded 100-120 readings (this was a verbal over the
phone).  I paid for the good used black box and new plugs, they paid
for labor.  I wasn't happy, but was unsure of anything I could do.
Also, I have ALL of this documented.

350+ miles and two weeks later, the car dropped a cylinder again.  The
next compression test showed between 45, 75, 90, 100, 100, 120 (not in
that order) and my mechanic/friend who checked it said it looked like 
a total rebuild was in order (I completely trust this person).

I called back the original shop to understand if they would help out,
and their reply was basically "sorry, not our problem".  They offered
a top end rebuild for a "reduced" price of about $2500 as their best
offer.

I have logged a compliant with the Consumer Complaints Auto Repair

1.  Is it possible that the readings could be this varried and that

2.  Any opinions on whether I actually have legal recourse?

Sorry for the length of this, any advice is appreciated-

**********************************************************************
I reply:

re: 1.

My understanding is that the early 911 engines are pretty solid
(my experience is with an 3.0 SC engine).  For the compression to
drop from 135 to 70 within 100 miles is "suspect" to say the least.
If the plugs are going often, there may be oil getting into the 
cylinders.  Do you know how much oil you are using?

Since the shop doing the test (as far as I can tell) also maintined
the car, they should be aware of any problems that could be related
to the sudden drop in compression.  Frankly though, from the numbers 
you are presenting, I would be very dubious of the original evaluation.
(I think you done been took!)

re: 2.

It sounds like you bought the car from someone other than the shop.
When a shop does a pre-purchase inspection, they cannot be certain
that no problems will ever occur.  Now, what exactly would you want
the shop and/or the previous owner to do?  Buy the car back?  Fix the
car?  (in this case, who would you want to do the work?)

There's a latin term (carve out your empire?) meaning "let the buyer 
beware."  I think you would have to show conspiracy to get any 
legal satisfaction.  If you have a friend that's a lawyer, you might
get them to send a nasty legal type letter suggesting all manner of 
dire consequences if they don't "do the right thing."  However, I
think this would mostly be bluffing, though I don't really know.


re: in general.

I would avoid a car that has had a large amount of recent work done.
One thing you might look at is exactly what work was done.  Posting 
a synopsis of the repairs might shed a little more light on possible
answers to your questions.

If you do wind up keeping the car and fixing the engine, you may want
to consider putting in a rebuilt 3.0 liter engine in instead of 
rebuilding the 2.2.  The 3.0 generally runs 200k+ miles w/o ANY major 
work.  I've seen them in Panorama for as low as $3k (used w/70k miles) 
to $7k (rebuilt).  You'd go from about 120 hp to about 180 hp.

Also, check the blow-by.  This is the smoke that comes out of the oil
fill cap when the engine is running.  There should be none.  If there
is a lot (no, I don't know how to describe how much a lot is, sorry)
you may have a broken ring.  In fact, if some of the recent work was
new rings without new pistons, there may be excessive piston-ring
clearance, which will cause a fast ring failure.

Anyway, I'm sorry to hear of your unpleasant experience.  You have
to be very careful with used 911's.

Just a quick note: when you put in a 3.0 engine in an early (pre 74 I think)
911, you also have to/are advised to change the gearbox from a 901 to a 915.
This needs a little bending to get clearance. It also adds $1K - $2K to the
cost of the conversion.

My understanding was that this happened during practice/qualifying, and not
during the competition.  It was doubly unfortunate, in that I was told that the
driver had his pole position already sewn up when it happened.

On a personal note, while I wasn't there, a car I helped to prepare won its
class.  Mark Greenburg drove The Pink Car to a win in the 3.18-and-under litre
class, besting Jim Newton who had his blue&yellow factory race car.  Mark and
Jim were dead tied in qualification, and Mark got the pole on the toss of a
coin.  Entering the first turn (Big Bend), Jim tried to stay high rather than
fall in behind Mark.  He unfortunately put two wheels off and, in recovering,
fell back quite a bit.  Although Jim managed to progressively catch up lap after
lap, there wasn't enough time in the competition for him to challenge The Pink
Car.

I guess this reportage is pretty much "business as usual" when it comes to
racing.  But it sure is exhilirating when you had a hand in it all!

As you must have guessed already from the way you asked your question, all 
rebuilds are *NOT* alike.  In particular, you have to worry about stress wear 
on the bushing holes in the 901 case, and a whole raft of other stuff. Then 
there's the mechanical part of replacing gears, synchros (which may either 
be replaced with the gearset or seperately on the 901 and 915), bearings, and 
a variety of  other gasket/bushing/packing parts. Plus realigning the 
differential, checking for stress risers in the side plates, etc.

Force Racing does some pretty interesting stuff. I spent about two hours
on the phone with the head guy there about two years ago, and have since
helped a friend install one of their rebuilt transaxles. Here's the deal:
regular Porsche synchros are basicly made out of silly putty (well, some
sort of soft brass-like material anyway 8{) ).  The apparent reasoning: 
the stock synchros wear because they're soft.  The reason they're soft is 
to make it easier to accommodate different tolerances in the various parts, 
and to have the synchro wear instead of the gearset. 

The way to fix this: Force Racing makes theirs from hardened steel. They are 
also made smaller than the regular synchros, and require hand fitting to
*YOUR* transaxle parts. The result: seriously hard synchros with an exact
fit, resulting in the claimed non-gear-grinding shifting at speed.

The downside: you *will* wear out the gearsets. And since synchros are
about $120 each and gearsets are about $600 each...

Oh, I was *not* permitted to pop open the transaxle I helped install.
At $1900, exchange, for a rebuilt transaxle, my friend was not too
keen on me rooting around inside the box *before* he'd had a chance
to break it. I'm still waiting, and it's still working fine. And I have
no idea how legal it is for Solo II, but since I *think* that "normal
wear items" like bearings, and presumably synchros, are free, it ought
to be OK.

Quaife's seem to be the way to go these days. It's a purely mechanical torque
transfer device, and does work. We have one in the FP 911, and it does drive
very differently from my AS 911. I'm not sure they're worth the money, but
hey, it seems to be the case that you can get your money back out of the
deal at any time. Proof: go price used Quaife's!

Well, we have a 915 shifter on the EP 914. It came that way, and I haven't
had occassion to take it apart to see how it's set up. Mind you, it's still
shifting a 901, but using a TOTALLY different set of linkage up close to
the shifter. And it's tons crisper than the regular 901 shifter. 

On my street 914, I also have the Automotion shift kit, which basicly replaces
the springs in the shift plate, making it harder to mis-shift. And I made
a reverse lock-out plate too. Since I usually drive a 915 in non-competitive
situations, and the 901 in competition, and reverse on the 901 is where
1st is on the 915, somehow it seemed like a pretty good idea....

Be careful on this.  Normally expendable items may be only be replaced
with the same stock item or a non-stock item of the same *type*.  This has
been clarified to mean same material, same hardness, same dimensions, etc.
Same reason you can't replace expendable rubber bushings with harder rubber
ones.  This clarification was published a couple years ago and is still the 
current interpretation to the best of my knowledge (Karen?).  Read the rules 
and contact the SEB if in doubt.

Subject: erratic 944 idle problem


Hi folks,

This is my firt posting to this group. I've been listening in since
a few weeks ago and I've read a lot of great technical stuff.

I have a 1987 944 that has recently started to exhibit erratic idling.
When you initially turn the engine on in the morning (engine cold), the
engine stalls sometimes or has great difficulty hanging in there. The
idle goes up to only about 750 rpm and then surges to about 1200 and
then back down to about 750 again. It keeps on doing that until the
engine gets warmed up (after being driven a few miles).  Once it is
warm, the idle stays at a constant rpm (albeit a little lower than
it used to) and feels more or less normal.

Someone told me they had this problem with their 944 a short time
ago but it went away on its own and a 911 SC owner just recently
started having the same problem but hasn't figured it out yet.

Has anyone encountered this behavior at anytime ? Any clues as to 
what might cause this idle surge ? (Bad sensor somewhere ?)

thanks in advance for any and all insights,

Subject: A sad story and what to buy next

Last week I was sitting at a stop light in my '71 914 waiting for the
light to turn green when _WHAM_!!!! I get rear-ended by someone going
about 35-40 mph. They didn't even touch the brakes! Needless to say,
the 914 is history. Meanwhile, I have a bunch of 2.0L engine parts 
sitting in the garage (I was going to rebuild it, but...). I guess I'll 
need to do an inventory and post the parts for sale soon since I won't
have any use for them now.

So, what's a good car to replace the 914 with? I'm considering the 
$10,000-$15,000 price range. Over the weekend I test drove an '87
944 and a '91 Toyota MR2 turbo. That MR2 is a rocket! But the response
is _very_ nonlinear -- there is a big surge when the turbo kicks in.
The 944 is nice and seems much quieter and more solid than the MR2.
Any other suggestions? Best years to consider, years to avoid?

If you are starting from scratch, the best way to proceed is to set
the torsion bar/spring plate to the "proper" unloaded angle.  This
angle is between the unloaded/unconnected spring plate/torsion bar
combo and some body reference.  This info is right in the factory
manual.  By rotating the inner splines and the outer splines relative
to the spring plate you can achieve quite fine angular accuracy
due to the fact that the inner and outer ends of the spring plate have
a different number of splines.  Once the thing is bolted together
and the car rests on the suspension, the height should be correct.

Note:  This procedure should work the first time but if its your
first time at it, expect to have to make a height adjustment on
one side or another at least once by rotating the torsion bar
which means disassembling everything again!

Note2: If you want to change the height, ie lower, at this time
(and its the best time) then set the initial angle  slightly
shallower.  There have been people who have figured out for
a particular car the number of degrees of spring plate angle
that translates to # of inches lowering, or you can do it
by trial and error.

Adam -

Your dash problems are perhaps due to a bad ground or to misinstalled
aftermarket equipment (cell phone, stereo).  The latter has been such a problem
for PCNA with the 928 series that they have issues a couple of tech bulletins. 
The symptoms were very much like yours.

Check your grounds and clean them.  There are two grounds under the dash in the
driver footwell.  Most of the sash equipment is grounded there.  Easily
accessible, one to the back of the underside of the central electric board (aka
relay and fuse box), the other to its right.  Check also grounds in the engine:
behind the block, and one on each frame rail at the front, near the headlamps.

Happy hunting.

Nabi -

Look first for a vacuum leak.  In US cars, there is a decal under the hood, over
the right wheel well showing, schematically, where all the hose goes.  Check
especially the Y under the manifold.  Oil blow-back from the manifold will swell
the leg which plugs into it, and it can then fall off.  If yours is swollen, you
can trim the last centimeter or so off to get unswollen rubber.

I would next check for air leaks in the induction system, the injector O-rings,
and the manifold-to-block gasket.  For the induction system, check for obvious
damage past the air flow sensor (tears, etc.) and for loose hose clamps.  For
the O-rings and manifold gasket, check by sprinkling water or shooting brak
cleaner onto the gasket/O-ring.  If you hear a change in idle as you spritz,
you've found the culprit.  With brake cleaner, you can smell it in the exhaust
if it is drawn in through a leaky seal.  You can also visually check the fluid:
where there's a leak, it will be quickly sucked in; where no leak, it will
puddle.

Since your idle improves with engine temp, it is more likely due to te manifold
gasket or injector O-rings, and not to something which doesn't get warmed.  You
can exacerbate the problem by unplugging the lambda and running "open loop." 
This places the DME in default open loop mode.  It also eliminates the lambda
sensor as a culprit.  The closed-loop behaviour of Motronic, etc., DME's can
really cover up problems.  This is especially true of the latest series of
adaptive DME's as first seen in the 944S and 928S4, then 944S2, 968, and I would
assume the Carreras.  They can hide nasty problems for a really long time.

I don't think your lambda sensor is likely to be at fault unless it has been
mechanically damaged, its heater wires are disconnected, or some other disease
has caused it to be damaged.  Let me know what you find.  Replacing the manfold
gasket and injector O-rings is not terribly difficult.

On Nabis 944 cold idle problems:

I agree w/ Kevin to check for vacuum leaks.  Also check head 
temp sensor.

One thing to keep in mind is that O2 sensor doesn't do anything
until thermo switch kicks in when the car is warm.  O2 sensor
is designed to operate only when its at a very high and
*stable* temperature.  This is why they're always mounted up
pretty close to the base of the header.  If you've got a warm-up
problem its not the poor O2 sensors fault...

I only skimmed the messages on this topic, but whenever I see height
adjustment postings my teeth just grind.  Adjusting the suspension by
ride height is a oft- made mistake - one that happens to
work frequently.  Since it does work often enough, this reinforces
the belief by it's practitioners that it's the right way to do it.

The correct way to adjust the suspension is to put the car on 4
scales, one under each wheel.  The weight measured on each wheel
should be roughly equal.  This may, especially on older cars with
sagging springs, result in a car that looks a little lopsided.  If
that bothers you you should get new springs, not readjust the hight so
it "looks" ok.

The recent discussion of transmissions and syncros has raised a few
questions.

Several people have commented that harder syncros improve shifting 
at the expense of the gearset.  Could someone elaborate?

It seems that improved syncros woud reduce the gearset wear and soft 
syncros increase it.  My reasoning here is that as the syncro wears,
there would be increased wear on the gearset due to the 'ka-chinks'
that occasionally occur, therefore softer, faster wearing syncros
would mean faster gearset wear.

Clearly (from the comments posted here) something else is happening.

Anyone care to comment in more detail?

It's just not possible to adjust the weight of a 911 (or most any car for
that matter) to be equal on each wheel. The best you can do (on a car
without ballast) is to balance the diagonals or balance any pair of wheels!
(I think balancing the diagonals would be best. Any comments?)

Also, there are many reasons why a car could be lopsided other than sagging
springs. I once owned a '77 911S with A/C. The previous owner had removed
the compressor, causing the right side of the car to be much higher (~1/2")
than the left.

On the subject of "sagging," does anyone know if torsion bars can do their
equivalent of sag? If so, are there any considerations in readjusting the
height to compensate?

In the San Francisco bay area, I've seen two 84 Carreras asking $17K.  Both

I've also seen 86 and 87 951's with low milaege asking 11-15K.  I think both

Subject: 911 Alternator


Lately, on my 79 911SC I have noticed that the brightness of my lights
flickers when I am idling and gets brighter when I rev the engine. I
suspect that my alternator is slowly dying ( I checked the V-belt).
Does anyone know what type it is (Bosch, motorola, marshall) for a 
Canadian model?

Also, the Haynes manual has a section on servicing the alternator.
Are there any sources for getting a rebuild kit with the bearings, brushes
etc? 


Thanks

As an apparent newcomer, you may not be aware that many people on this
list do take their cars to the track.  ImProper suspension setup can
cause accidents in high speed situations, if your left brake locks up
before your right one you may find yourself facing the wrong way.

This is precisely the error I was referring to.  Simply because it has
worked in the past does not mean it will continue to.  Most of the
time it does work, and honestly if you don't drive your car at high
speeds it probably won't matter.  It may however, if you decide to
brake hard one day.

   Also, I don't know where the engine in *your* 911 is, but I wouldn't

My message was posted quickly, and as you correctly observe the equal
I am referring to is by axis.  Your sarcasm as well is duly noted.

Subject: weltmeister sway bars

Drew asked for comments regarding the Weltmeister sway bars.

I put 22mm front and rear bars (weltmeister) in my '80 911sc about
a month ago.  These replaced the stock bars (20mm front & 16mm rear).

It's like a different car!  I drove an autocross the next day and 
missed first place by 0.1 second.  This is higher than I have ever
finished before, though I do think it was a soft field that day.

I don't find too much inprovement for street use, except when set to
the softest end of adjustment, they seem stiffer than my street tires
(hard compound a008's) will support.  When set near the midpoint of 
the range (slightly stiffer in front than in the rear), I felt that I
was able to use my competition tires (comp ta r1's, 204 (rr) compound)
more effectively.  I do not think that I was really using anywhere near
all the tire performance before the new sway bars were installed.

I did NOT like having to drill holes in the car...

But I think it was worth it!

Weight setting a car is about about a couple of hours labor.  It costs
no more than a 4 wheel alignment and usually makes a significant difference.

Most street/autocross cars that I weight set(several years ago), came
out sitting un-flat(for lack of a better word).  Most of them were
914's though.

Sure, you can't change the front to rear weight bias but, as it was stated 
earlier, you can get the weight to be equal on each axis.  Braking and even
traction for accelerating can be improved.  Thats one of the reasons why 
pure race cars are weight set as part of the alignment.   

So, yeah, one can say that weight setting is only part of fine tuning a 
streetable car, but every little bit counts.

Subject: Re: 911 Alternator

Stan posted the following article a while back.  Perhaps it points the way...

- ----------------------

Alternator Alternative
by Mark Gohlke
Maverick Region

lt seems a shame to me to replace an alternator just because it does  not work
any more.  lt 
is even worse to replace one when it is still working, but needs something like
bearings 
replaced.  This article specifically addresses my experiences with two 1970-74
914 
alternators, but the comments will generally apply to other models as well.
One of my alternators was suffering from the effects of exposure to the elements
and needed 
it's bearings replaced.  The other was old and had apparently been apart before.
 It needed 
itUs bearings and  brushes replaced, and was missing a spring washer which
belongs behind 
one of the bearings (footnote 1.).  The parts to repair the alternators were
surprisingly easy 
to come by, and cost MUCH less than two replacement alternators (rebuilt $130). 
Almost all 
bearings are made in standard sizes by bearing manufacturers.  Companies like
Bosch who 
make alternators, etc, purchase these bearings to use in their products.  Thus,
whenever any 
bearing needs to be replaced - whether in an alternator or somewhere else - the
chances are 
very good that the bearing is available at your friendly local bearing
distributor.  The same 
goes for oil seals.
These are the parts I found to replace: - Front bearing, part number 6203-z. 
$9.00.  The -z  
refers to the seals on the bearing.  They come open, shielded, or sealed on one
or both sides.  
The manufacturer's name will also appear, but is not important.  The bearings in
my two 
alternators were from Peer-Romania, Fafnir, and Delco -- Pear bearing, part
number 6201-
z.  $7.00. -- Brush assembly, part number 021-903-503-A.  $23.00 from your
VW/Porsche 
parts man.  This part contains the two brushes and guides mounted to a plate
which  also has 
the terminals which plug into the car's wire harness. -- Washer  kit, part 
number 02 1 903 
220 $6.00 from your VW/Porsche parts man.  I needed this to get the large spring
(wavy) 
washer which was missing from alternator number two.  The kit also contained a
spacer, 
some flat washers, and two screws.  None of these parts should really have to be
replaced 
unless they are missing.  No doubt the rectifiers can be replaced, but l won't
know as long as 
luck is with me.
To disassemble the alternator, first mark the orientation of the two halves and
the back 
cover.  The pulley has to be removed to get the front bearing off, so it may as
well be done 
first.  The pulley has some slots in it to enable you to hold it to get the nut
off.  It will then 
come off easily with a puller.  Remove the back cover, and then remove the long
screws 
holding the alternator housing together.  Now the two halves will come apart,
although they 
may take some careful prying.  The wide iron ring which divides the two housing
halves is the 
stator and must stay with the back (large) half (it has wires connected to it). 
The rotor will 
stay with the front half.  Now the bearings and other parts can be removed and
replaced.  
Note the bearings are a light press fit onto the rotor.  Use of the proper tools
is helpful here.  
Your friendly mechanic, machine shop, or some parts stores can help if necessary
at this 
point.
I found that the wires connected to the commutator rings on both rotors were
physically 
separated from the rotor.  They had obviously been glued down when they were
made, but 
presumably centrifugal force had separated them.  Reposition and rebond the
wires if 
necessary.  You may have noticed the ominous sound of the brushes springing from
their 
guides as you separated the housing, and sure enough they appear to be blocking
all hope of 
ever getting the alternator back together again.  They have to be held out of
the way for the 
back bearing to get past them to put the housing together.  This is done by
carefully pushing 
the brushes, one at a time, back against the spring until you actually push the
brushes out the 
back of the guide slightly.  At this point the spring will go from pressing on
the back of the 
brush to pushing on the side of the brush, holding it nicely in place for
assembly.  After the 
alternator is assembled, the brushes may be snapped into place one at a time. 
They are 
accessible through a hole adjacent to the connectors for the car wire harness.

1.  See page 123 of the Haynes 914 manual, or the factory shop manual for an
exploded view 
of the alternator.

Re: Erratic 944 stuff...

The temp gauge on my 944S (87) sometimes goes to the top, but a gentle tap on
the glass makes it go down. The first time that happened, I nearly panicked.
Now it is a JHTR (Just have to replace). That's about the only problem, other
than difficult cold starting (probably the water temp sensor, the FI pulses
aren't increasing in cold weather)

Re: Car to replace the 914.

I would suggest that you test drive a 944S before you buy a 944. I drove the
944 standard, and thought that it felt a bit heavy on acceleration (eg slow)
compared to, say, my Dad's 911L (67). 

The dealer had a 944S for a little bit more, and after test driving it, I was
pleased. It held the power clear up to redline, and didn't experience the
annoying power dropoff at around 5000, like the standard 944 did. It wasn't a
rocket like the 951 (Turbo 944), but when you bring the RPM's up, it will 
move...

Needless to say, I bought it, and am quite happy with it.

	Having recently posted here an article from Autocar & Motor saying
that the 968 might have a limited life, it's only fair to now post the
letter from John Edwards (Manager, marketing & public relations, Porsche
Cars GB) which appeared in the issue of 09-SEP-1992 under the heading
_Porky Pies?_ (this is Cockney rhyming slang for _lies?_). The article is
accompanied by a photograph of a 968 cabriolet with the caption "Porsche
968: reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated".

===========================================================================

"The story 'Porsche to kill off 968?' (19 August) that you printed is
contrary to the true situation and the figures you gave for price and
production are incorrect.

The 968 is an integral part of our line-up and following the investment
made by Porsche in its development and production facilities, the 968 will
remain part of our range for the forseeable future. Current production
rates are circa 30 cars *per day* and not per month as you reported.

The 968 is the next generation in the successful Porsche philosophy of
product evolution. Some of the technological advances made on this car are
represented by the 22 new patents applicable to this vehicle.

Porsche AG has indicated that it will maintain a vehicle in the price
segment of the 968 and has announced that a new car is being developed to
enter the market in a price segment below the 968.  Whilst we acknowledge
the car market is very difficult in many countries at the moment, the
unique flexibility of Porsche production will enable us to maintain
profitability and further develop our product range.

Derivations of our model range are a successful part of our model
development and we look forward to further announcements of such models in
the near future. However, contrary to your article, a 911 costing circa
UK#30,000 will not be one of those announcements."

========================================================================

	I am curious as to what this entry-level car will be like. Despite
a less than enthusiastic reception from the cognoscenti, the 924 sold well
and perhaps it is this sort of volume that Porsche are after (and probably
need in order to survive).

	There was also a small article in The Guardian (I don't normally
read this rag, but it's the only English-language newspaper I could get in
Greece) of 24-SEP-92, under the heading _Porsche misfires_. Can anyone
explain the implications (if any) of this:

"Arno Bohn, management board chairman of German sports car manufacturer
Porsche, is to leave the company at the end of this month because of
boardroom disagreements over business, it emerged yesterday. A Porsche
statement said Mr Bohn's departure was mutually agreed. His departure
comes only six months after the supervisory board in a dramatic turnaround
extended his contract for three years to end-December, 1995."

Bummer,

   I recently got some really bad news about my '82 911SC: my air box
is cracked, even though I had installed a pop-off valve.  My mechanic thinks
that the box had already been blown before I put in the valve, but the crack
got bigger and/or looser with time so none of the symptoms showed up until
recently.  It's about a $900 job (~$350 for parts, ouch!) if I have him replace
the air box.

  I'm really tempted to try to glue the crack.  I called Bruce Anderson and
he said he knows of several people who have tried but they never get back to
him so he doesn't know if it worked or not.  Alan Caldwell said that he doesn't
know of anyone who has been able to glue the box successfully.

  Have you heard of anyone else try this?  What is a good adhesive to use?
Luckily, I had saved the "hole" piece I got from drilling for the pop-off
valve so I can do adhesive experiments on it.  So far I have tried epoxy,
super-glue, plastic pipe glue, and 3M's structural adhesive (sold by Automotion
as a "super glue" to install pop-off valves).  Nothing seems to stick.  I
believe the air box is made of Bakelite plastic (phenolic?).

In the likely case that gluing doesn't work, can any of you offer any
hints/suggestions on replacing the air box, i.e.:

How hard of a job is it?

Anything tricky about the job?

Is there anything I should watch out for?

Do I need any other parts besides what are listed below?

P.S. This problem caught me completely off guard.  I had brought my car in

Sugi,

re your potential alternator problem.  It may just be the battery.  I had
virtually the same symptoms on my 79SC.  the symptoms almost totally 
disapperared on battery replacement.  I understand that these cars are
very sensitive to battery voltage and a weak battery can cause strange
electrical glitches.

BTW, it would not hurt to check and clean all ground wires.


RE: corner weighing.  I have had it done to my SC.  It does make a difference
as to how the car feels on the street as well as the track.  You first must
decided approximately what suspension height you can live with.  Then have
the car corner weighed and try to get the left to right measurements as close
as possible.  You should have something in the drivers seat with the same
weight as the driver.  Front to rear weights are not likely to be close due
to the rear weight bias of a 911.  But you should be able to get left to
right measurements within 50-100 pounds or less.

You should also check all camber and caster settings again after you get the
heights right, since these may change due to your adjustments.  The fellow
who did my adjustments is in the local PCA and also owns a Goodyear service 
center with good alignment equipment.  It cost around $200.  It was well 
worth it.

Be very careful about which hoses go where - you can screw things up
pretty badly without trying hard...

Also, consider getting an after-market air box that won't crack and has the
pop-off valve already.

What you have is an oil/water emulsion, almost certianly from an oil
leak into the water through the oil/water intercooler. It may be just
o-rings, or a more serious update, depending on the year of the car.
Don't just flush it and ignore it.

As I believe someone else mentioned, you have essentially no control over
the total weight on the left side versus the total weight on the right
through weight balancing. These are functions of where the weight is
in the car, just like front versus back.

There was a discussion here on this a year ago or so, and there were
several knowledgeable opinions that 911's have enough extra weight on
the right side that even with a driver, the total weight on the left
was very near the total weight on the right, but that is a function of
the design of the car, not weight balancing. For many cars, the side
weights (total) will not be equal with a driver, since the cars are
essentially symmetrical without the driver.

With weight balancing, the only variable you can adjust is the ratio of 
the totals on each of the two diagonals. Assuming the total weight
on the left doesn't equal that on the right for your particular car,
you can use weight balancing to make the front weights equal (with all
of the excess weight on a particular side reflected in the back wheel
weights), or to make the backs equal (with the extra weight on the front),
or some other algorithm like equal front/rear RATIOS on the two sides,
but you can't make both front and rear side weights equal without moving
weight around in the car.

In fact, the process is iterative, since suspension alignment adjustments
change weight balance, and weight balance adjustments change alignment.
The number of iterations depends on how far away you are when you start,
on how close you want to get, and on luck (mostly the latter, it seems).

I would try JB Weld.  This is an epoxy like adhesive that will fill gaps,
and is fairly immune to heat and fuel.

I'm not sure the airbox is bakelite (epoxy does bond to bakelite), but 
I'm also not use it's not.

When using epoxy (or most other adhesives) there are two really important
things to be careful about.  All surfaces must be **CLEAN**.  At a minimum,
I would liberally flush with brake-clean (TCE).  I would also consider
carb cleaner first (but use a test piece to be sure it doesn't disolve
the airbox).  I don't think you can be too anal about cleaning this 
part as it is likely to have lots of fuel soaked into it.  Unless you get
the fuel out, you can pretty much forget about it bonding.  The second
important thing is to clamp the parts as the glue sets.  If you use 
JB weld, which fills fairly well, you may get away without major clamping.

Yes, if I were in your position, I would consider one of the stainless
steel airboxes (I think automotion sells them, someone else will thus
have them cheaper).  As I recall, they are cheaper than the original, 
and come with a built in pop-off valve.  I don't know if they flow as
well as the original, so you may want to look into that first (another
call to Bruce?).

When I removed my air box (no, you **cannot** remove the chips left over
from installing a pop-off valve with a shop vac...), I did not replace
any injector seals as I did not remove any injectors.  Ditto the intake 
gaskets, I only removed the intake boots.  I suspect that I would have 
removed the intake manifolds if I had thought it would make the job 
easier, but I don't remember.

I'm not quite sure what your airbox is made of, but I recently had to
glue large portions of my motorcycle fairing back together after a
crash in turn 9 at PIR.  My bike is a Suzuki GSXR1100, in case you want
to go to a local dealer and see if the fairing material is similar to
your airbox.  I tried two things, both of which are working very well
(they can withstand top speed blasts down the straights @ ~160mph+), so
it should work well on your airbox.

The first product is a glue specifically for mc fairings from a company
called Three Bond, and is distributed by Lockhart, among others.  It
goes for around $25 (Racer suppport cost through Lockhart is $15), and
looks like a superglue with an accelerating agent.
The second product is good, old fashioned, JB Weld, which is $5 at the
local hardware store!
The 3Bond stuff works pretty well, but it has to be a clean break,
since the stuff can't fill gaps.  The JBWeld can fill gaps.  I found
that JBWeld works best if you bevel both sides of the cracked material,
so there is a trough the JBweld can fill. Foe added strength, I drilled
small holes along the crack and used stainless safety wire to "stitch"
the crack.  It's ugly, but hey, it works.  And the Frankenstein look is
kind of neat.  You could use dabs of JBWeld to seal the holes.  This
should work well, since I don't think the airbox would be subjected to
THAT much stress.

Subject: corner weights


   With weight balancing, the only variable you can adjust is the ratio of 
   the totals on each of the two diagonals. Assuming the total weight
   on the left doesn't equal that on the right for your particular car,
   you can use weight balancing to make the front weights equal (with all
   of the excess weight on a particular side reflected in the back wheel
   weights), or to make the backs equal (with the extra weight on the front),
   or some other algorithm like equal front/rear RATIOS on the two sides,
   but you can't make both front and rear side weights equal without moving
   weight around in the car.

Congrats Frank!  You're the closest one so far!  It seems there is
alot of misconception about this.

Weight balancing, or more correctly "corner" balancing attempts to
ensure that the RATIO of front/rear wheel loads on each *side* are
the same.  This does NOT mean:
(a) All wheels carry the same load.
(b) Both front *or* both rear carry the same load
(c) Each diagonal axis carried the same load

What it means is that if the driver side front carries 46% of the
drivers side weight then the passenger side front *must* carry
46% of the load on that side.  This eliminates the effect of the
4 wheeled vehicle to behave like a table with one leg slightly
shorter than the rest, ie "teeter tottering" on the *long* 
diagonal.

To do this correctly is *not* simple and requires iterations as Frank
says.  An alignment shop must have accurate scales and this
knowledge, plus the ability to correct and re-correct alignment
*and* ride height of each corner until its correct, or within some
reasonable tolerance.  

The 911/914 happen to simplify this a bit because of the
adjustability of the front end ride height.  But there is the
rear...

So now, do you really want to do this to your street car?  Are you
getting your money's worth at the alignment shop for so called
weight balancing?  Does the mechanic understand the higher math
involved?  

So long, I'm going down to Firestone to have my Olds Vista
Cruiser wagon weight balanced....

I'm not sure that equal ratio's is always the best objective,
but we may be picking nits. I would have suspected that different cars
might slightly prefer equal front weights at the expense of more 
imbalance in the rear, and others vice-versa. In any case all of this
is very much at the fine tuning level.

To do it really right requires iterations, good equipment, time,
and understanding, and if you are looking for the last 0.1 sec on
the track (and are a good enough driver to take advantage of the
difference), you will want this kind of job. By the way, with any
car with rubber bushings it is very hard (impossible?) to get the
car to settle after a weight adjustment well enough to measure
suspension alignment accurately without driving the car for a while,
so the iterations take considerable time.

However, you can take advantage of weight balance at another level.
There are cars out there, which, through some combination of poorly
thought out adjustments or accident damage, have significantly more
than half of their weight on one diagonal. In effect, they are
"teeter-tottering" on one pair of diagonal wheels. You can't see this
necessarily from static ride height. A relatively crude measurement
and adjustment that gets the diagonal totals roughly equal (even within
a hundred pounds or so) can make some terrible cars significantly
better. 

My advice would therefore be to have someone check weight balance once 
to make sure you don't have a serious misadjustment, but take their
pronouncement that they "got it within a few pounds" with a grain
of salt.

It sounds like you have oil in your coolant.  This is probably due to

The netters are correct as usual:

The cottage cheese was from oil contaminating the coolant!
The dealer said he'd have to replace gaskets, bearings (etc..  I wasn't
really paying attention.. the car is under extended warranty.. for all I
care, let them rebuild the thing.)

Why does this coolant/oil "mixing" seem to be such a problem on 944's?
(This reminds me of the infamous motor-mount problem; I have yeet to
meet a long term 944 owner who hasn't replaced his at least once.)


The New York Times today characterized the situation at Porsche AG as
being near despiration...  I can see no light at the end of the tunnel
at Porsche unless prices come down (yeah, right.)  

BTW 

I thought I read that they're planning to come out with a 968 Turbo.
Is this true?  If so, what would the specs be? (I'd imagine that it
would closely approach the 911 Turbo's performance at less than one-half
the price.)

Clicking sounds in the CV mean it's dead. You can in theory

The fix is to replace the CVs. You can do all 4 in about 3 
hours. All it takes is money....

FYI, I did mine about two years ago. Each CV had chewed up
at least one bearing, and seriously scored the races. Bleah.

True enough. But there are *lots* of SCCA types out there who
would be happy to let you use their corner weighting scales for
say helping them around the shop some plus a case of Bass Ale
or some such. And scales aren't that expensive -- under $1000 or
so.

Usually. If you don't have "unusual" problems. And if your torsion
bars are all relatively fresh. For example, I run my street 911 in 
autox and driving schools, and like a very well balanced feel. Problem:
I weigh close to 300 lbs.  Now for you "little girly men" out there, 
say 150 lbs and under, this isn't that critical.  But at my weight, 
that's a significant spring preload that *has* to be corrected.
The answer: corner scales, plus 300 lbs of cast iron ballast to load 
the car with to simulate me while I adjust it.

We balance the 911 GTU to within 5 lbs per wheel. Admittedly, not
an average case, but still...

Nope. All busted air boxes I know of have had to be replaced. But good luck

If you have very long thin arms with an extra elbow per limb, it's a
snap 8{). I'll admit to not having exactly an average build, but I had
to seek help to get to some of the rear-ward connections. Arm was too
big for available hole.

Nope. See your friendly factory manual first, though. Takes about 5 hours.

Nothing else comes to mind. But I'd seriously consider using the aluminium
air box sold by several aftermarket places, like Performance Products,
Automotion, etc. rather than another plastic box. Plus, they usually already
have the pop-off valve installed. And if I had the fuel distributor off, I'd
also change the fuel filter. Not that I'm paranoid, but...

And you might need to have the CO re-adjusted afterwards. Count on it.
