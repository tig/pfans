There is a factory tech bulletin covering the 944S and 928S4 models describing
cracked cylinder water jackets.  This could conceivably be your problem. 
However, I have never heard of an actual case of this happening.

>Why does this coolant/oil "mixing" seem to be such a problem on 944's?

Porsche changed the internals of the oil/water heat exchanger case for MY 87,
for some reason.  This really seems to have precipitated the problem.  Sinc
911's have neither oil/water heat exhangers nor coolant, they have been
relatively free of this problem.

   How hard of a job is it?

Regarding air-box replacement in CIS cars:

If your gonna do this yourself, take this little tip seriously, or
else the job is 1000% more difficult.
Lower the engine by supporting w/ hydraulic jack from rear of engine
and remove rear engine mount bolts.  The whole drivetrain can now
be tilted down by 6-8 inches.  Just ensure that no hoses, wires *or*
linkages are binding up.  If you do it right you won't hurt a thing
and you'll have *plenty* of room to do the job.

Subject: Metal air boxes


Thanks for the many replies and helpful hints regarding the cracked 911 air
box.  One common suggestion is to install an after market metal air box.
I had already talked to a mechanic about this and his opinion is that
the metal boxes tend not to fit as well and that an OEM plastic air box
will never blow if a pop-off valve is installed.  I have some questions:

1. Has anyone actually installed a metal air box on an '82 911 SC?  How well
   did it fit?  Where did you get it?  Was it aluminum or stainless steel (I
   know there are at least two types).

2. Has anyone heard of a plastic air box being blown apart AFTER a pop-off
   valve was installed?  In my case I really believe that the box had already
   been blown when I installed the valve.  The only symptom of the crack was
   a pinging problem between 3-4 k rpm.  This problem was unmasked after
   the oxygen sensor was replaced and re-connected into the FI system.

>>What air box are you talking about?

Dave,

      You'll probably get half a dozen (hopefully similar) answers to your
question, but here is my answer:  the air box is pretty hard to miss.  My
guess is you haven't worked on 911's that had one.  it is a rather large
piece of black molded plastic about 8"x8"x18".  It is equiped
on CIS (continuous injection system, aka K-jetronic) fuel injected 911's
made from '73 to '83.  Many of the fuel injection parts fit on the airbox
and it also holds the air filter.  the part that "pops" is a vacuum chamber
right after the throttle body to which all the intake manifolds get
connected.  An aftermarket pop-off valve is heavily recommended because
an all-too common backfire (though a properly tuned car should never backfire)
will blow the box apart.

      I'm typing this from memory, so hopefully the 911 experts on the
mailing list will forgive and correct any errors I've made.

   Congrats Frank!  You're the closest one so far!  It seems there is
   alot of misconception about this.

What are you, handing out awards here?  I posted a year or so ago a
full description of the weight balancing problem, including a
description of the physics involved and the process by which proper
balance is acheived.  I did not want to get into it again, and since
you seem to understand the process there is no need to educate anyone
further.  You are a newcomer to this group and are assuming more
ignorance that you need to.

The real issue here is not how to weight balance a car, the issue is
how difficult is it, and is that difficulty justified by the return?

My recent posting was a reaction to the general process of blindly
adjusting ride height without any concern for weight balance.  You
seem to think this is not worth the extra time - I claim it is.  In
severe cases improper balance can be very dangerous, in mild cases it
can cause loss of handling performance.  To many Porsche owners who
track their cars, this performance is worth the time and effort (or
money) it takes to do it right.


   So now, do you really want to do this to your street car?  Are you
   getting your money's worth at the alignment shop for so called
   weight balancing?  Does the mechanic understand the higher math
   involved?  

   So long, I'm going down to Firestone to have my Olds Vista
   Cruiser wagon weight balanced....

This is unecessary.  You are being confrontational, we are NOT talking
avout Olds Vistas, we are talking about Porsches.  Porsches that are

Let's all look way back at the *original* post.  The guy was cutting
sheet metal out of a rusty old 911.  (no offense btw).  If he's gonna
take it on the track he's got a long way to go and besides he just 
wanted to know how to *simply* reset his torsion bars!

Lets agree on this:

If you're not tracking and you're not driving like a maniac on the
street, but you are simply driving your Porsche back and forth to
work so you look good, then you don't need to corner balance unless
you are Hans Stuck or totally anal. (or drive a Vista Cruiser )

If you are fortunate enough to be racing or time trialing on the track
then by all means go ahead and corner balance, but make sure the
person doing understands how.

   This is unecessary.  You are being confrontational, we are NOT talking

Greetings,

Some of you may remember my naive question(s) related to replacing
the boots on my CV joints.  I thought they were "Nadellas", when
they really were "Lobros."

So, for all of you who asked me what happened, here's
the story.  It turns out that the factory alternated the '66 911/2s with
both Nadellas (u-joint style) and Lobros (CV style).  And those 911s
with posi (the factory has another name I cant remember) also had the
Nadellas.  In '67, they went to the Lobros with some minor exceptions
which I wont get into here.

I can easily get the replacement boots ($5.95 ea from Stoddard) for Lobros.
The Nadellas can be totally rebuilt (Tweeks) for $400 per half-axel.

Sure am glad I've got the Nadellas!

Drew Spencer responded to me and suggested that 225/45VR16 on 7x16
wheels in the front will be too large. My '78 911SC is completely
stock and the wheels are Porsche "Fuch" forged alloys.

Not that I don't believe Drew, but I had been told that this tire
and wheel combination would work fine even if I lowered the car to
European specs.

Does anyone have any opinions on this?

Hello again folks,

Now that the subject of battery charging came up (Mark's email
of Oct 1), I would like to put my '87 944 in the garage during
the winter after all the track events are over.

I know I have to disconnect the battery, since it went dead last
year when I put the 944 to sleep. I probably have to put the battery
on a trickle charge to keep it in a proper state. If so, does anyone
know who makes a good (reasonably priced) charger ?

Are there any special preparations one has to make before 
the hybernation period ? (i.e. new oil, fuel, put car up on jacks
to save the tires, etc.)

Thanks in advance for any/all insights.

PS Also, thanks to all who responded to my mailing about the erratic 
   944 idle surge problem. I'm going to try the suggested course of
   action and see if I can find & fix the problem. I will let you know
   how it turns out and what the problem was.

Scott -

You should have no problem mounting 225/50x16 tires (not 225/45x16, which I
dunno about) on a 7x16 rim, and a 245/45x16 on 9x16.  I have the 225's on my 7"
rims and 245's on my 8" rims.

In both cases, my tires are nominally "too big" for my rims.  Properly, a 225
tire section width should go with a 8" rim, and a 245 section width with a 9"
rim.  However, the trade-off I and many other 944-series owner have made is a
little more tread width (which goes up with section width...) against a little
more sidewall flex.

Us 944 types have found that there is no wheelwell and suspension clearance
problems with these rims and tires.  The same may or may not be true for 911's,
and I am sure that someone else on the list can pipe up.  When it comes to
oversized rims and tires, you really just have to find someone who's done it to
know whether something will fit.

As far as tire recommendations, the vast majority of folks I know use either BFG
Comp T/A R1 road race tires (204) or Yokohama A008RTU or A008RS2 tires, with
excellent results on the street and track.  (BFG also has a pure autocrosser,
206, which cannot be safely driven on the track because of its softness.)  I
through my Comp T/A's on in the spring and leave them on all season.  I love it!

	One way to at least get a very good idea of if the tires will fit is
to check the clearance of what you have now, see how much room there is to
spare in the tightest direction.  Then check the offset and width of the
wheels you have now, and the overhang of the tire.  From this you can
determine how far in or out from the hub the tire gets.  From offset
and width on any wheel you plan to buy you can get this same information,
add the overhang you expect from the tires you are going to use.  Voila, you
know if it is going to hit anything!  This will really only work for wheel
tire combinations with similar diameters, and is somewaht rough, but it
often beats taking someone's word for it.

I'm intrigued. I thought that both 944 Turbos (1986) and all of the
rest of the 944 line through 1986 used the 23.5 mm offset which is
also used on all but the latest 911's. I can't imagine that you mean
that late 944 Turbo (52.3 mm offset) wheels fit better. Is there
really a difference?

The 8s fit w/o a problem in the front.  Under the SC flares, the 9s
will fit in the back, but you have to use tires that are narrower than
the rim in order to get them to fit under the fender - this means that
the first thing to hit the curb on close parking jobs is the rim.  It
also means mounting becomes a real pain.  If you let the tires sit
overnight with some wood blocks spreading them apart then they are
much much easier to mount, though.

My response to Scott was due to my personal experience.

I run 7's and 8's on my SC, as such, I was not disputing
that the wheels would work.  They will. 


Scott mentioned that his intention was to put 225's on a
7" wheel on the front and "lower the car to Euro specs".  

I run 205/55-16 BFG R1's on 7" wheels.  When I lowered
my car (slightly) and added some negative camber to the alignment, 

the mechanic doing the alignment (a local PCA sponsor) said that it 

WILL rub the fender in a high-load turn.  Sure enough, it did.  

I was spared a creased fender fortunately, and proceeded to roll 

under the lip in the wheel well.  I don't have problems with it
rubbing now with the 205's.  


I've seen other people unknowingly put too large a tire on the
front and end up doing bodily damage to the front quarters.  As
stated by others, the best bet is put it on the car and check it
out.   If you opt for this, make sure that you check not only 

with the suspension at rest, but also under load.  I had no problems
at all until I ran an autocross on an undulating parking lot with
some very fast transients :-).

I beleive you also need to look into specific tires.  I have some OLD

marginal, comp T/A streets a bit better.  COmp T/A R-1s will definately
fit as the sholder design and actual tread are a bit narrower at the
top.

Howso?  The comp TA's are low pressure so the bottom contact patch
flares out a bit.  You may notice that comparing tires, R-1s are both
higher and narrower and a 245 looks like anyone elses 225 , widthwise.

Yes, but be careful -- don't forget that when you corner, the sidewall
flexes and the tire moves inwards.  Especially if you're going with
soft/tall sidewalls or with very sticky tires, leave some room on the inside
for this -- especially at the near-straight-ahead positions (clearance
against struts, springs, and that sort of thing).

On the front, don't forget that any diameter change will affect the
full-lock clearance as well.  You can generally fit a wider tire more easily
in the front if it's smaller in diameter.

Someone with a 944 mentioned having 225/50's on his 7x16 fronts, but didn't
know if a 225/45 would fit.  Sure it will, though it would fit better on an
8" rim, as you said.  Of course, I don't know anything about fenderwell
clearance on a 911, since I've never owned one -- I'm just talking about the
wheel/tire relationship.

I've never heard of a 225/45-16...  Who makes one?

   I run 205/55-16 BFG R1's on 7" wheels.  When I lowered
   my car (slightly) and added some negative camber to the alignment, 
   the mechanic doing the alignment (a local PCA sponsor) said that it 
   WILL rub the fender in a high-load turn.  Sure enough, it did.  
   I was spared a creased fender fortunately, and proceeded to roll 
   under the lip in the wheel well.  I don't have problems with it
   rubbing now with the 205's.  

This is just one more case of the variability in Porsche chassis,
ie no two cars are alike.  Because keep in mind that you could've
bought an SC or Carrera from the showroom with 7x16 205/55 and
8x16 225/50.  I always thought that this combo could not be made
to rub under any circumstances just because it was a factory setup.
Obviously I stand corrected.

This is a good point.  As I understand it, Porsche has to adjust
ride height up on the cars entering the US to abide by DOT standards
for bumper height.  The combination of 10 year old suspension and
lowering the car would seem to be the most likely cause of the 

tire rubbing I experienced.  Also, as I stated before, I only had
problems when the car was being pushed hard.  I guess it's time
to change those tired old Bilsteins...

Speaking of shocks (thread context switch here) I've been looking
over my options for shock absorber refreshing.  My car came stock
with Bilstein.  Any collective experience with the
Koni adjustables or new Bilsteins?  Car is used for some streeting,
lots of autocross, and potentially PCA time-trials.

I realize that if I go Koni
all the way, I would have to replace the entire front strut instead
of just the insert.  Any ideas?

Actually, the 245/45-16 size of the BFG Comp T/A R1 is just a teeny little
tire.  It really should probably be a 235/45-16, as that's about how big it
is.  Their own 245/50-15, which is nominally almost exactly the same size,
is *much* larger than the 245/45-16 in every dimension.

So remember that the tire size stamped on the sidewall is only nominal, and
be aware how large the tire you choose *really* is.  Contact the
manufacturer or an authorized dealer; the actual sizes are indeed published
and available.  Both BFG and Yoko make them available in the standard
product information brochures.

It doesn't work to make the generalization that R1's are generally taller
and narrower...  In my experience, actually, they're generally wider than
other manufacturer's tires of the same nominal size.  But it all depends on
which size you're talking about...  Each mold is different.

I think there is some confusion here, as well as a potential difference
of opinions. Yokohama's current pseudo-race tire is the A008RS, and the
autocross tire is the A008RS-2. The A008R is a 2 generation old (the
A008 RTU was in between) pseudo-race tire. Incidently, the A008P is,
from what I can tell, a relabeled A008 (no letter), which was Yokohama's
orininal entry in this class of tires. It still has the solid rubber
(no tread) outside third of its surface, and, as such it is still
somewhat of a compromise tire for normal street driving in the rain.
It is not as terrible as you might suspect from looking at it, but it
is not as good as some of its competitors (for instance the RE71) in the
rain. It is a good (dry) track tire, but not as good (e.g. fast) as
the current generation (A008RS or Comp T/A R1) by a significant
amount (a few seconds a lap, depending on track length).

On the subject of dual street/track use, I currently run A008RTU's that
way, and I would expect A008RS's to be in the same general class.
I have about 15 hard track driving days and about 10,000 street miles
on them, with a bit more to go. I did blister and replace a LF tire
recently, so what I'm describing applies to a set of 5, not 4 tires.
Those numbers are not what you would expect from real street tires,
but they are not that terrible either, so I would say that dual 
street/track use of these tires is at least an option. As the saying
goes, "your milage may vary", in this case rather literally.
By the way, the A008RTU's don't seem any worse in the rain (at a given
tread depth) than the A008's, although they start with less tread.

plus a ton of street miles (typically 15k/yr).

A friend uses A008Ps on his Turbo-look 911, and loves them. Similar use
as mine, but no autox and more schools. Similar wear.

Note that this is Houston, home of the year-long wet season. 

I hear the A008Ps are fine in the rain, but can say with authority

   I'm intrigued. I thought that both 944 Turbos (1986) and all of the
   rest of the 944 line through 1986 used the 23.5 mm offset which is
   also used on all but the latest 911's. I can't imagine that you mean
   that late 944 Turbo (52.3 mm offset) wheels fit better. Is there
   really a difference?

For those unfamiliar, all of the above wheels we are speaking 
of are Fuch type.   

The 8x16 wheels normally assosiated with the 911 are for the rear.
They have the "911 offset".

The "944 Turbo offset" 8x16 spaces the wheel inboard about
an inch relative to the "911 offset" 8x16.  This wheel is 
O.E. front on some 944 Turbos with sport suspension.
Part number escapes me at the moment.

>From the outward appearance they look just like stock 7's
except that there's an extra inch of beefy rubber under

No such beast exists in the 9x16 department.  All factory
9x16 Fuch alloys are the same, be it 911 Turbo or 944 Turbo.

This is pretty interesting, since I use these babies.  My understanding is that
the "245" is the section width, which of course one expects to increase as the
tread width.  But clearly two kinds of "245" section widths may have very
different tread widths.

Do trickle charge it.  My only idea for a source is a really neat little unit
that Clair Parts Express showed me a year or two ago.  I forget the
manufacturer, but I'm sure they haven't.  Call Mack at 1-800-354-5100.  As I
remember, it was small and could be attached permanently to the side of the
battery or whatever.  Make sure the cells are topped off (with distilled water)
before putting any charger on a battery.

Yes, new oil to remove the acidic old oil.  Top off fuel to inhibit
condensation.  Don't block the suspension.  You are more likely to rust the
shock pistons if you do so.  Current tires won't flat-spot from a few months of
sitting.  Make sure their pressure is good, maybe even a little high.  If you
have rodent exposure, put moth balls in the air induction and exhaust, then tape
them up.  Take the PCA membership inquiry cards and application forms out of the
Porsche and put 'em into the other car.

This is all from memory.  Personally, I drive mine year 'round, come rain, snow,
or taxes.

As I understood it, 245 is 245mm from the center of the tread to the bead of
the sidewall(where the edge of the rim is)SEE CRUDE SKETCH BELOW.  The aspect 
ratio(45 in this case) is 45 percent of the 245mm and represents the sidewall.

                      
            ..->b      (245mm from a to b)

        .   _________
        |  |         |
        a_ |         |<---(tire cross section)



The side wall then, should be about 110mm high.  Care to go measure?
The 15" tire mentioned above should have a taller sidewall but a narrower
tread area across the tire.  
	Back when I worked at a tire shop, I was also
told however, that different manufacturers were not consistent in using
this formula to describe the dimensions of their tires.  Ie.. where does
the sidewall begin and end if some designs placed treads into the sidewall
area.  This may account for the variations you mentioned....?

From: pfile (Porschephiles Mailer)
Subject: Monthly Moderator Message

October 1992

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

Yow! We moved. I finally got my own Internet connection, and viola!
we're now on TTA.COM; since I own the whole mess, it's unlikely we'll
be rehosted again at least anytime soon.

Some other BIG win on this: TTA.COM will support anonymous FTP of
Porschephiles archives. Soon. Watch for the announcement. It will
be in /pub/porschephiles

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA. 
To help support that, I'm going to put newletter articles on-line
for FTP as well. If you edit a newsletter, feel free to upload your
articles too. This will be in /pub/pca/newsletters.

Oh, and yeah, by the way: if you abuse the FTP priveledges, like by
deciding to use me as your off-line storage for all kinds of random
shit, I'll flush the facility or re-write the daemon to only allow
people with my permission to access the system.

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

Porsche Club of Great Britain
Ayton House
West End
Northleach
Gloucestershire
England GL54 3HG
Telephone : +44 451 860792
Fax	    +44 451 860011

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes) at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: 911L: What made it different?

Question:

Does anyone know the major differences (engine, major design) between the 67
911L and a 67-70 911T? I have seen a lot of T models, but only one L so far
(my father's).

Thanks
Chris

The '67 911L is basically the "plain" 911, still 130bhp,
but different camshafts.  The '67 911 engines were
1,991cc.  For the 'L' the engine number was 901/06.  


'67 saw the introduction of the A series which included a
new model, the 911T. The original plain 911 became the 911L
(for Luxus meaning luxury). 


The 911T had a less powerful engine: the 901/03, 110bhp
and a lower price.  For '68/69 the engine was still 110bhp
but had different model numbers for the Coupe, K-Coupe,
and Targa.  For '69/70 and '70/71 the output increased to
125bhp (again the specific engine number depended on the
body type).  The 'T' engine had cast iron cylinders instead
of the Biral (combination iron/aluminum) cylinders of the
other engines.

In 1968 the wheelbase increased by 2 inches.  However in
'67 the 911T started out with what was in essence a 912
body.  There were also a lot of other changes in the late
'60s which may futher differentiate the two cars depending
on the actual year of the 911T.

As an aside, one thing that is not too clear to me is whether
or not the 911L was ever a US machine.  I do not think so, so 

your father's car is probably European.  Someone else may
be able to shed more light on this though.

Finally, the info above is from a variety of sources that I
have including:  Karl Ludvigsen's "PORSCHE: Excellence was 

Expected",  Bruce Anderson's "PORSCHE 911 Performance 

Handbook", and Michael Cotton's "The PORSCHE 911 and
Derivatives including 959".

Uh, well, I think this is a good exercise to go through.  But when you're at the
edge of what will fit, empiric results are really the way to go.  If memory
serves, Dave Coleman had an article in Excellence a few issues back.  He found
that while an older 245 tire fit just fine, a newer design in the same nominal
section width did not.

One should also be aware that a static check will not necessarily give you
enough of an idea of how things will fit under heavy loading.  A friend learned
this earlier this year at Bridgehampton, apparently locking up a 911's tire in a
high-speed corner there.

Subject: 944-series A-pillar liner removal

The project-de-jour is installing a CB radio in my 944S.  Seems like I was
the only one without one when we convoyed to the Zone 1 autocross, and boy
did I feel left out.  Not really, but what the hey.

The antenna is one of those through-the-glass, miracle-of-modern-adhesives
deals, apparently the best route to go if you don't feel like drilling a
hole in your roof.  It comes with a nice long cable.  I plan to mount the
radio itself in the passenger footwell.  All the controls are in the
handset, so the radio can be tucked away.  It's about the size of a large
paperback book, and I plan to fasten it to a home-made bracket, which will
in turn fasten to one of the ABS control unit mounting studs at one end,
and a leftover flange next to the radio antenna amplifier at the other.
Good access if I ever need to get to it.  (Which is why I don't want to
put it under the passenger seat.)

So the best antenna cable route would seem to be through the headliner,
starting near the C pillar, running down inside one side of the roof, and 
down the A pillar.  I am having a bit of difficulty getting the interior A
pillar liner piece off.  There are three plugs along it: top, middle, and
bottom.  Only the top and middle have screws behind 'em.  There is no visible
fastener behind the top plug, but it is definitely secured somehow!  (Tried
the driver-side one as well.)

I've already removed the liner piece which spans the top of the windshield,
holding the interior lamp.  The A pillar piece sort of locks into it.  (I've
also popped the glove box out for better access.  Good learning experience,
because you then have great access to the underside of the dash.)

If anyone can clue me in to how the A pillar liner piece may be removed, I
would be most pleased.  Btw, does anyone out there own the 924-series
workshop manual set, and does it cover this sort of stuff?  I have the 944-
series set, and of course one is always told to get the 924 set as well.
I'd also appreciate any feedback on how people have done this sort of
installation.

Subject: 911L: What made it different?

True. After talking with my dad, he said that the 911L was a German/Euro car 
(he brought it back from Germany in 68). He also said that it had a bigger
camshaft and a few other 'enhancements' that made it neat. Unfortunately, it 
sat in the garage for about 10 years, so it needs a bit of work to make it go
again.

Also, the thing that struck me about the 911L was the 6 barrel weber carb
system, with each cylinder having it's own carb/throttle linkages/etc. Was this
standard on that period 911? That car never seemed to suffer from under-
carburation...

PS: The reason for this is I am slightly considering getting a old (67-70) 911.
I remember the fun that my Dad's was, and I would like a similar one...

Subject: CV joints

Subject: 951 CV joints

A couple of weeks ago I described a problem in the rear wheel of my 1987 951.
When I was making turns, I could hear a noise from that wheel. There was also 
a significant amount of lateral play in that wheel. My mechanic suggested that 
it was a bad bearing. I took a look at it and I found out that the big wheelhub 
nut was loose. I had to get a 32mm 12-point socket to fit that nut. 

The second part of this post describes my "unforgettable" weekend which I spent 
repacking the CV joints. 

1. First you need to find a star allen bit (not torx) to remove the 
   the multi-spline bolts from the axles. 
   As Kevin mentioned, you can get from Performance or Automotion.
   There is also a Snap-On socket. I found a KD wrench (KD 2304 serated
   wrench) for $6.35 in a local store. It requires a 12mm socket to 
   connect it to a driver.

2. Removing the shafts it is easy but it takes time. There is a total of
   24 bolts and some there are in awkward places. You have to remove the  
   wheels to make your life easier.

3. The removal of the passenger's side axle is a pain. The fuel filter and
   and the transmission oil cooling pipes leave very little space to work.
   You have to raise and tilt the joint that is attached to the transmission.

4. After you remove the axles, place them in a clean place, take them apart,
   and clean them. Be careful here! Although all parts of the joints
   look symmetrical, they ARE NOT. Improper placement will probably have 
   disastrous effects in the joints and/or the transmission.
   It is important to make sure that during
   assembly the outer and the inner race of the joint face the same way.
   The Hanes manual suggests that you paint one side of both parts. I would not
   recommend it. With all the grease, you have to wait for ever for the
   paint to dry. The best way to find out the correct placement is to
   find which side of outer race has the smaller(larger)  distance between
   groovings, and observe the relation with the inner race. Usually there is
   a number in one side of the inner race. This will do it. The middle race
   can go both ways (It is symmetrical).

5. When placing the joint in the axle make sure that the holes in the boot
   rim are aligned with the holes of the outer race.

6. I would recommend to get a new set of circlips. 

7. Kevin suggested to swap the axles (left to right and vice versa), and
   to flip them (inboard and outboard). This is an excellent idea. I saw
   small signs of wear in the one side, while the other side was almost perfect.
   This will even out the wear, and will increase the life of the joints.

8. During installation, attach first the transmission end of the axle, and
   tighten all bolts. Then release the hand brake, hold the other end of the
   axle to the wheelhub, press with your finger one bolt, 
   and start rotating the hub until the bolt finds its place. Then put the
   rest of the bolts and tightened them. 

I do not know if there is more effective way doing this job, but this how I
did it using trial-and-error methods.

Just been looking through the who's who of porsche owners that

Richard Cole             UK '72 911 E              colers@prl.philips.co.uk
Philip Katz              UK '85 944 Lux            katz_p_m@bt-web.bt.co.uk

Is that really it for porschephiles in the UK?  (I've mailed my car details

I know a Porsche is much more expensive in the UK than in the US, but surely
there are more of us out there than this?

Subject: Need info



Hello Folks,

    I have listened/read to y'all for a month or more now since I have
    joined the list, and this is my first posting. I presently do not
    own a Porsche, but I would like to own one, to be more specific I
    want to buy a 928. I would like to find one of the earlier one
    pre-mid 80s, from say 77 - 84. I want to get the 928S, the reason I
    say this is a very good friend of mine owns one and I have driven it
    a time or two and feel in love with it. Not because it has the name
    Porsche but because it appears to be a drivers car. I have no other
    experience with Porsches.

    So my questions are: What is a reasonable price for one of those
    years? What should I look out for in the way of bad things? One of
    the things my friend told me about was the rear wing, and how to
    tell if it is an aftermarket add-on or a factory install. Do they
    come with either standard or automatic transmissions? His has an
    automatic, and if I remember right somebody on the list had one with
    a 5 speed in it.

    I live in Phoenix at the moment but hail from Austin Tx., which I
    will be returning to as soon as my contract here runs out or I find
    a new one in Texas. I would like to have the car to do the drive back
    to Texas in.

    Also what kind of options did they come with/without. As one can
    tell I am very Porsche ignorant. So any and all help would greatly
    be appreciated.


Thanks in advance for all of the replies,

Bruce...

The 911L was not, to my knowledge, made in 1967. In 1967, Porsche made
a 911, a 911S and a 912 (no 911T either). 1968 was the introduction of the
first emissions requirements in the US, and Porsche could not get the
911S with its large valve overlap to pass. They therefore introduced
the 911L, which was a 911S in terms of trim options, etc but with the
normal 911 engine. Your dad's car could be a 1968 model year car which
was purchased in late 1967. Porsche still made 911S's in 1968 for sale
elsewhere than the US. The 911T, 911E, 911S designations were, I believe,
introduced in 1969.

Subject: 914 engine swapping 

 I am getting ready to start my winter rebuild of my '73 914 1.7. Since I will
probably be pulling and at least be overhauling/freshening this engine I was
curious about doing an engine swap at this time. Although I can't afford a
six cylinder engine I thought I might be able to increase the power by moving
up to a 2.0 litre engine. My questions are as follows:

1. What components would have to be swapped in order to convert from a 1.7  to
   a 2.0 litre. I was under the impression that the heat exchangers were unique
   for each engine. Anything else that I should "aquire" if I hunt down a 2.0
   engine or parts car.
2. What about using the existing fuel injection system from the 1.7 on a 2.0
3. Would it be more cost efficient to rebuild the 1.7 using one of the big bore
   kits and swapping in a hotter cam than stock.
4. Is there a noticeable difference between a 1.7 and a 2.0 when actually 
   driving the car. Or can they be simply put in the catagory of "similar".
   If they are similar I would suspect a hotter cam would have a much more 
   dramatic difference than the 300cc difference in engine displacement.
5. If I opt for a hotter cam, what would be a recommended piston that would be
   able to sustain the higher revs and increased stress from the hotter cam. 
   Or; how tough is the stock piston set-up in the 1.7. Can I just re-ring them
   if they are in good shape and swap in a hotter cam (obviously not full-race,
   but fast-road/race cam).
6. What are some good fast-road/mild race cams available? Where do I get them?
   I haven't seen too many ads for cams of any type in any of the porsche maga-
   zines. 
7. Is there anything else with respect to piston strength/displacement/type and
   cam selection/valve train wear and tear that I should be aware of. 

 My experience is with Mini engines with everything from mild to full race cams
so I have no qualms with lumpy idle, increased valve train wear and all the 
other problems. I just want a faster than stock 1.7 914 for the street that will
run reliably for at least a summer (maybe two) of daily driving with an engine
inspection/freshen up during the winter. 

Any opinions greatly appreciated.

OK, I remember someone out there is looking for a cheap 944 to make
into a track/autox/etc car. I just don't remember who...

Ghost Racing has this spare '83 944. No power steering, fiberglass
manually operated sunroof, disconnected A/C. Just *exactly* what you'd
want in an early 944 to take to the track. GR is the third owner,
and the second had the engine replaced under extended warranty at
about 50k miles, so this one has about 45k on it.

This is a rust-free Texas car, solid as they come. Asking price is $4,000
cash. 

If you're serious, and want to do something in the next week or so, send
me mail. Otherwise, it may get traded on a 911 that's just come on the market.

	YES!  Actually, I am thinking of the difference between the 1.8 and
the 2.0, they are worlds apart.  I can't recall if I've driven any 1.7's,
but the impression I got was that the 1.8 was dog slow, and the 2.0 felt

Yes, but we're a bit spread out :-). One reason I believe is the fact that
in the UK USENET is not commonly available, especially at home, although that's slowly changing - still expensive though. The main costs coming from British Telecom, a pretty good deterrent to any outside communication from your home!  

Also, if you look at typical owners in Porsche Post they seem to be typically accountants or similar type professions without access to a unix environment. 

The majority of the US members of the list seem to come from commercial or educational type establishments which perhaps are more typical of enthusiasts rather than the type of owner who buys a Porsche because it's a status symbol, not to say that there aren't sales in the US for this reason but there are far fewer Porsches in the UK.

Incidentally, PCGB membership in the UK is around 10,000 - second only to the US I believe.

Subject: Not Original Parts

          To all that are interested and involved in the 

restoration and perpetuation of the hobby of antique 

automobiles:  We would like to introduce a new company that is 

involved in just that.  The name is NOT ORIGINAL PARTS (NOP).  

My name is Ron Peters; my brother Terry and I have grown up 

surrounded by this hobby.  We both have been involved with 

many makes of vehicles, but have been primarily interested in 

Chrysler products (Mopars) and Alfa Romeos.

          Our view toward restoration is one of extreme 

quality, and we, like you, have a difficult time finding parts 

with which to rebuild our cars. There are many manufacturers 

of aftermarket parts for many different types of cars, and 

there is just as wide a diversity in quality as well.  Not 

only is the search for the part difficult, but the search for 

the quality in that individual part makes things doubly hard.  

Other times the part is nowhere to be found in aftermarket and 

the only option left is in trying to find it from a private 

party or possibly a parts car or wreck.  The market for 

original parts is often sparse and can be extremely 

expensive.  This is where NOP comes in.

          We are in the process of restoring a 1957 Alfa Romeo 

Giulietta Sprint.  We have decided to add to the aftermarket 

arena by starting with the Giulietta.  We not only want to do 

this to return our car to 100 point condition, we would also 

like to help all those out there with similar cars, as well as 

others to be explained later.  NOP's aim is to produce the 

highest quality parts to give the absolute perfect look of 

restoration without diluting the original-part market with 

parts that are so close to original that they can be passed 

off as original.  We plan to make every part so that it can be 

identified as aftermarket when not in place, but have the 

perfect look of originality when in place.  We don't want to 

produce counterfeits.

          NOP is starting with a part that was included on at 

least the 1957 and 1958 Giulietta Sprints.  It may be on other 

years or models of Giuliettas but as of now we don't have that 

information.  This part is a jack-hole cover.  On the side of 

the Giulietta Sprint, in the body there are four slots for 

jack points.  These parts are original equipment that fit into 

these jack points to cover the hole and continue the body 

line.  Many other owners that we have talked to had never 

heard of these covers for their cars and we thought that there 

would be many others in the same situation.  Initially NOP 

would like any information concerning these covers and also we 

would like any interested inquiries to email for more specific 

information.

     NOP does not want to limit itself to producing only parts 

from one specific model of one specific make of automobile.  

We are starting with the Giulietta mainly for the fact that it 

is the car we have most access to.  We would like to produce 

the parts that are needed, no matter what kind of car they are 

for.  All we need is the verification that there is enough 

demand for any given part to make the process feasible.  We 

welcome any and all requests for specific parts and we will 

research and consider all of them. Most people involved in 

auto restoration cannot afford to have a particular part 

custom made for one time use, but with a company like NOP, we 

are small enough that we can have short runs of parts for very 

specific applications and make it worthwhile.

          I would like to thank you for your time on behalf of 

Terry and myself, Ron.  We would greatly appreciate any 

comments, information, or requests.

Basicly, this is nearly impossible to do unless you have a 2.0 "donor car". 
You need electronics, fuel system (pump is different), heat exchangers,
probably transaxle and shifter parts (you *WILL* want to go to the side
shifter as well, unless the car is already a '73 1.7 which had the sideshifter)
You will also need other parts I'm not remembering right now. Some of the 
extras can be foregone if you use carbs instead of fuel injection (*DON'T*
use carbs. But I've talked about that before...)

>2. What about using the existing fuel injection system from the 1.7 on a 2.0

No. Won't work. Many parts are *almost* the same. Some can be made to work 
with significant modification. It's all different.

I wouldn't be surprised, but you *still* have  to modify the EFI to flow
more gas for the larger engine, and to flow more air. There is 6mm different
in the diameter of the metering device...

Well, you can make over 180 HP out of the nearly-1800 cc built-to-the-limit
EP engines you make out of 1700s. As that's roughly double the 2.0 output.
However, the cam is only *one* of the things you have to do to make that
work. The real trick is you want to make more RPM. Oh, and by the way, be
geared to *use* the higher RPM.

I doubt you can re-use the used stock pistons. Count on a full rebuild,
and consider the NPR big-bore kit, or the Eurorace 104.5mm pistons.
Depends on what you want -- more low-end power or more high-end power.

What's this cam fascination? That's not the problem. Sure, cams are a Big

Did you see my how-to-build-a-150+HP-engine posting a few weeks ago? If
so, that's got most of the info you need. Be advised that you will spend
over $3k to make a high-performance engine that you can live with, and which

I'd be really unhappy with that kind of life expectancy. A good non-race

Subject: Re: 928 Voltage too high

Thanks for all the responses to my 82 928 voltage reading problems!!

Some suggested that I check all the grounds, especially the battery
ground strap.  I checked the battery ground strap which looked a little
oxidized and I cleaned it.  The voltage then read VERY low (~10).  Better
than high (14+) right?  Wrong!  After driving around town a bit, I came
out to a car that wouldn't start.  Fortunately I have a 5 speed and
was able to jump start it without any help (although some people did
the obligatory "honk at a Porshe owner 'cause they're all jerks and
get what they deserve for owning such a car".  Anyway, drove straight
to the dealer (Sunset Porsche/Audi) which happens to be walking distance
to my office. They got me right in and called to let me know I had a
bad voltage regulator (wonder of wonders).  They wanted $140 for the
part and another $50 to put it on (I was already into it for $50 for
the diagnosis).  I called some independent "Auto Electric" places
around town to see if anyone had a voltage regulator for the car.  One
place said he could fix it for $17-$35 (carry-in price).  Good enough
for me.  I picked up the car from the dealer, drove home, dropped the
alternator out, and took off the back cover to expose the voltage regulator.
The next morning I made one more call (to another "Auto Electric" firm).
They said they didn't think they could "fix" the regulator but they had
an after-market replacement for $28.50.  Ran down and got it, slapped it
on, re-installed the alternator and voila, my voltage gauge now reads
~13V (and the battery stays charged).  So, all in all, I figured I saved
$160.

Not just a Porsche problem.  It it very common (even with Detroit
iron) to have this happen IF you do not replace ALL the hoses when you
do anything to the cooling system especially like new pump, or new
coolant after a flush, etc.  Most backyard mechanics have probably had
this happen to them once and then they know.  It's happened to me
about every ten years when I forget or try to cut corners.

Help!!!

  My 914 has sprung a leak!!!  I noticed a lot of oil under my car the 
other day and i was also time to change the oil.  So I started it up
this morning to warm the oil and so I poped my head under the car and saw
a nice flow of oil comming off the oil filter.  So I think the oil is 
comming from the oil cooler. Iam I right??? If not where could the oil
be comming from.  If it is the oil cooler seal do I have to pull the
engine to replace them, or can it be done in the car??  A have a feeling
I have a weekend job comming, or do I.

Adam -

I really don't know much about coolant hoses, since none of mine have broken
yet. (I really learn about stuff only when it breaks!)  I have seen hoses fail
with what looks like a very sharp cut along their length, as you describe.  You
don't mention which hose broke, nor do I know the year of your car.

The one which most often fails, to my small experience, is the lower radiatior
hose, running from the water pump to the radiator.  I've heard of them going
because they rubbed either against the power steering pump belt on one side, or
the fan housing on the either.  The clearance is tight either way.  At some
point, Porsche upgraded the part with a hard plastic sleeve around the critical
part of the rubber hose.  I would suggest that 944 owners peridically check for 
clearance and signs of wear on this hose.  If your lower hose hasn't the casing,
consider replacing it with one that does, before that next long road trip.

If you had old hoses (like, original hoses in an early model), it may have been
the case that increased coolant pressure on the hose caused a marginal hose to
split.  I would guess that increased pressure may have come about because, with
the water pump, you also got a new thermostat which now opens properly and
fully, flowing more coolant.  Total guess, shaky at best!  It may also have been
the case that the squeezing and manhandling the hose got during pump replacement
pushed it over the edge.

Sorry to be so vague...  Kevin

This is an amusing thread to those of us who own *real* Porsches (those
without water-cooled engines).  ;-)

Of course, we have our own problems with our air-cooled engines, which
are probably more accurately described as oil-cooled.  It's easier to 
clean up after a water coolant leak, even with antifreeze, than it is 
to mop up all that oil.  :-(

This kind of leak can also happen if (pieces of) the prior filter's rubber
base gasket have stuck to the base plate.  Which is why it is important
to:

 a. clean and inspect the base plate after removing the old filter, and
 b. smear a coat of oil on the new filter's gasket (and threads).

I have seen this happen on a couple of occassions.

Whoever it was that said oil cooler seals is probably right. The guys
at Automobile Atlanta claim you can replace the seals without taking the
engine out of the car. I've never been able to get it to work, but hey...

Also, it's common to blow out the oil pressure sending unit, on top of the
block. As oil (like other things) runs downhill, you sometimes look like
you're leaking on the bottomside of the engine.

BTW, if you take the car to someone to have the seals done, you're looking
at nearly $350 to remove and replace the engine, and then about $7 in
parts for the seals. Just thought you'd like to know that....

   Yo, just a moment; all i've ever bean was a backyard wrench...I learned
   long ago that a coolant hose of any kind lasts longer if it has NEVER
   been hand-squashed as a test or abused while working on a peripheral
   to the hoses.  In other words, once the hose has 'heat set' you must not
   mash the hose or you...break the reinforcement fibers thus weakening the
   tube.  Although it is always a good idea to keep coolant systems intact,
   understanding the failure mode of a part and how to recognize the onset
   is your best next best defense against a surprise failure.  A backup hose
   in the trunk, along with tools and spare water will ace it.

Howdy-

Haven't seen an oil war on this group for a while...

I've been using good old Castrol 20/50 in the 931, changing it every 2k miles
and not giving it a second thought.  Now European Car runs an article on turbo
care that basically says I'm a fool for not using a synthetic.  Well?  Any
thoughts on the good or bad points of synthetics in a turbo?  Things to watch
out for?  Brands to avoid?

At some level, switching to Synthoil or Mobil-1 makes some sense to me, since
it should in theory _not_ cook itself onto my turbo bearings and oil lines
like a regular oil if I don't idle the car before I shut it down.  True?
This would be an important plus, because the bulk of my driving over the next
few months will likely be 10-minute hops from home to work, and it's hard to
be religious about a 5 minute idle after such a short trip.

Final question is re longevity of synthetics.  Synthoil claims it'll hold
together for 50k miles (don't know about Mobil-1).  True?  1/2 true?  If I can
keep Synthoil in the crankcase for 20k miles, cost is roughly the same as
regular oil.

Haven't seen an oil war on this group for a while...

I've been using good old Castrol 20/50 in the 931, changing it every 2k miles
and not giving it a second thought.  Now European Car runs an article on turbo
care that basically says I'm a fool for not using a synthetic.  Well?  Any
thoughts on the good or bad points of synthetics in a turbo?  Things to watch
out for?  Brands to avoid?

At some level, switching to Synthoil or Mobil-1 makes some sense to me, since
it should in theory _not_ cook itself onto my turbo bearings and oil lines
like a regular oil if I don't idle the car before I shut it down.  True?
This would be an important plus, because the bulk of my driving over the next
few months will likely be 10-minute hops from home to work, and it's hard to
be religious about a 5 minute idle after such a short trip.

Final question is re longevity of synthetics.  Synthoil claims it'll hold
together for 50k miles (don't know about Mobil-1).  True?  1/2 true?  If I can
keep Synthoil in the crankcase for 20k miles, cost is roughly the same as
regular oil.

I write:

First, I don't know anything specific about the synthetics.  I have
heard some rumors, i.e. decreased fuel consumption.  This may move 
the cost breakeven point toward more frequent oil changes (as I recall
Kevin Gross has these numbers).

Next, I have heard bad things about Castrol, i.e. foaming and engine
smoke that vanished with different oil.  The foaming is not supposed 
to be a problem with a dry sump engine (911), but I believe the 931
is a wet sump.  The racers I know all seem to use Kendall, so that's
what I've been using, changing about every 3k-4k miles.  I have also
heard a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting Kendall, stories from
cam grinders claiming lots of race miles and no cam wear, etc.

Finally, since all oil starts to look dirty by the time I change it,
there is **no way** I would leave **anything** in my engine for 20k
miles!

Canton racing products (in Coneticut (sp?)) sells a turbo post-oiler
which was developed for the 930 (if memory serves) to eliminate
seizure during spin-down.  This sucker has an accumulator which 
stores oil under pressure and releases it into the turbo after the
ignition is cut to maintain pressure while the turbo spins down.
I suspect this is going to prolong your turbo life more than **any**
flavor oil.  They also sell a pre-oiler to pressurize your oil system
before you start!  I really should get one of these, but am kind of 
intimidated by the lack of room in my engine compartment.

The good point is basically more consistent performance.
The bad point is the expense.

Hardly. The hot-soak temperatures are quite sufficient to coke the synthetics.

There is no substitute for good discipline...

The Castrol you are currently using has no significant change in lubricating and
cooling properties at 2000 miles - the reason to change it is that it traps
corrosive combustion byproducts. Synthetics don't do any better in this regard,
so leaving a synthetic oil in your engine for more than 2000 miles is a false
economy.

I have used both synthetics (Amsoil 20/50 racing oil) and Castrol 20/50
and there is very little difference in the on-track performance. I change
the oil before & after each track session anyway, so the big difference is
the cost.

On a related subject, has anybody had any experience with Slick-50?
I admit to having put it in several cars and a boat (Ford Engine) and
can't claim any noticable results, but now that you can get it for
about $19/qt, I figured "what the heck?"

I've run synthetic oils in a few cars but always wind up selling them
before I can reach any conclusions.  I strongly recommend anybody who
does run synthetics (esp if a friend, wife or whomever gets occasional
use of your car) to keep a spare quart handy within the car.  I can just
see my wife walking up to me and proudly claiming how when she just
gassed the old 911 (assuming it gets running again) she checked the oil
and added a quart of Rotten Robbie 20-50 (to my 9 quarts of synethetic!)

I've used all of the synthetics at some point or another. They all seem to be
fine. Typically, synthetics are much more heat-resistant than petroleum.
Thus, particularly for turbos and racing engines, they are a definite win. For
civilians, they also have this stick-to-the-metal-parts property that reduced
startup friction as well.

Well, you'll see much better results if you have a clean engine to begin 
with, but yes, it should help. But still, you should always idle the car
before shutdown.

Change the oil at no more than 3 month/3,000 mile intervals anyway. The
reason is simple: imbedded particulate. And no, the oil filter *WON'T*
get it -- recall that oil filters go into a partial-bypass mode at pressure
over about 2 bar (~30psi). Your car should be showing pressure up to 5 bar.
At that pressure, you'll filter less than 15% of the oil. So, at 50,000
miles it's not oil, it's liquid sandpaper.

Other possibility (and what I do on the racers): Canton/MECCA oil filters.
They come in two sizes, and two flavors, one that is a bolt-in canister
using two 1/2NPT fittings and the other a spin-on that basicly does the
same thing. What they do is full-flow filtering at 8 micron, up to just
over 6 bar. The canister is retained, and you change a $10 filter element.
Downside: filter canister is about $90. But as they say "DAMN well worth it."

BTW, I still change the oil before *EVERY EVENT* on the racers (typically say 
75 miles of usage 8:) ) and every 3/3000 on the street cars even if I'm using 
synthetics. Not doing so to save money is a seriously false economy.

If you like Castrol, they now have a new oil out, and guess what, it's
synthetic. I beleive its name is Syntec/Synthec. Watch out though the
bottle looks very similar to a synthetic that Valvoline has out. I seen
it in the local Pep Boys recently.

Just a thought. I use nothing but Castrol and as my also needs an oil
change it will be getting this new Castrol stuff.

Are you saying you have tried both Amsoil and Castrol synthetics, or
synthetic Amsoil and regular (petroleum) Castrol?  I thought it was
supposed to be bad to switch between synthetic and regular oil between
changes, and that once you've switched over to synthetic, that you
can't go back.  Is this true, and does anyone know why?

To be a little more precise, I've tried Mobil 15/50 synthetic, Amsoil 20/50
synthetic, Amsoil Racing 50wt synthetic, and a number of petroleum oils,
of which I have gotten the most consistent good performance from Castrol.
Valvoline was also good in that regard.

It is not true - if you are concerned about mixing problems, you can flush
a few times. I usually flush once on any oil change.

I'm pretty sure this was an old wives tale.  I know for a fact that
Mobil says you can even mix Mobil-1 with non-synthetics in your engine
with no ill effects.

Subject: Re: Synthoil + turbo = better?

Paul -

Accepted wisdom (which of course means "wisdom the speaker has accepted")
is that 911 Turbo and 924 Turbo cars really benefit from synthetic oil, I
believe because of their designs' increased risk of coking and heat
soaking.  The 944 Turbo is quite a bit better with respect to cooling of
the turbocharged, and includes a coolant pump which continues to circulate
coolant after engine shutdown as needed (correct me if I'm wrong).  People
seem to believe that 944 Turbos can get by without synthetic oil.

(This is really beside the point, but may interest other netters.  I put
an oil temp sender in my 944S last winter.  944's don't come with one -
they come with a water temp sender.  And gauge.  I've seen oil temps as
high as about 275 at the track this season.  So I am now using synth
oil.  I wonder what sort of temperatures other owners are driving with,
unknowingly.)

Synthetic oils' big advantage is thermal stability wrt. viscosity and less
break-down at elevated temperatures.  Which means they are less prone to
coking when heat-soaked.  And that cars with synth oil will turn over
more easily on winter mornings.  I am quite sure that you can still heat
soak and break down synth oil.  Idling a 924 Turbo a few minutes before
shutting down is wise.  In fact, if you've pounded any car at the track,
I really believe it deserves a cool-down idle period.

I do not know that synthetic oils may be changed any less frequently than 
mineral oils.  To really determine this, you'd have to do an analysis on
your/a car's oil to see what shape it's in.  (A friend who is a Chem Eng
told me a couple of nights ago that this is exactly what the US military
does.  They have a ton of vehicles, and some of them chow like 52 quarts
a change - no exageration.  So they do these test to see how long they
can get away without changing the oil.  They also do things like look
at the mix of metals in the oil, and can use that to pinpoint which bearing,
etc. is the source of the metal.)

I would tend to distrust manufacturers' and refiners' recommended change
intervals.  I think Porsche's suggested intervals are absurdly high.  And
the manufacturers have something to sell...

Synthetic and mineral oils are quite compatible.  You do not need to purge
one out of your car before using the other.  In a pinch, you can certainly
top off with the other ilk.

As to Castrol foaming and kidnapping nuns in Central America...  I have
heard any number of heinous claims made about any brand of oil you care
to mention.  They are generally founded by people whose scientific
methodology is a little casual.  I would take that sort of superstition
as a sign that you might be better off with another mechanic.

I passed along a friend's findings on Slick 50 some time ago.  The message
I posted follows.  In a nutshell, avoid these additives.
___________________________________________________________

Someone asked a while ago about experiences with Slick 50.  At the time, I had
heard of an analysis of the stuff done by a local club member and chemical
engineer.  Since he hadn't published his results, I didn't say anything then.

I now have a copy of his report.  What he did was take three samples of Al/Si
alloy in three matrices: 1. oil, 2. 80% oil, 20% Slick 50, 3. 100% Slick 50. 
The oil was 70W base oil, and had a bit of water added, in 500:1 ratio, to
simulate moisture accumulation.  The matrices were heated at 300F for 5-10
minutes, then at 575F for 10 minutes.  The result solutions were run through a
spectrometer, and the foils were cleaned and re-weighed.

Briefly, what he found was that the Slick 50-containing matrices (2 and 3)
consumed significant silicon from the alloy (and from the pyrex equipment). 
They did not consume aluminum.  The silicon was probably chemically acted upon
by hydrofluoric acid, which must have come from the Slick 50.  The oil-only
matrix (1) had no loss of silicon from the foil or gain in the result.

One remark he makes in the report is that, while your engine doesn't get this
hot, there is no guarantee that this sort of reaction doesn't occur at lower
temperatures as well.

I am not a chemical engineer; please don't kill the messenger!

From: kjross@cs.uq.oz.au
Subject: 931 Project


Dear Porschephiles,

Well I have finally been prompted into writing a bit about my 931 that I picked
up about 4 months ago.  I have meaning to write something to send to Paul Booth,
who suggested the group to me, but have basically been a little bit lazy. 8-)

The car is plated a 1981 model in Germany, but has 1982 compliance here in
Australia.  It is right-hand drive, how they manage to put together LHD and RHD
versions with the shortage of room under the bonnet is amazing.

I picked it up in a slightly sad state for about OZ$13,500 (approx US$9,500),
the dealer price for a 931 in good condition is about OZ$26,000.  However since
then I have spent a LOT of money getting up to scratch, and to date have
totalled OZ$22,500.  The following is a rundown (from memory) of what I have
done, remaining costs in OZ dollars (about US$0.72 to OZ$1).

TURBO:
- ------
When I first picked up the car I took it off the road for about three weeks,
initially to rebuild the turbo.  The car was blowing smoke on idle when I
looked at it, I was a bit dubious to the cause but after talking to a couple of
turbo rebuilders they convinced me that it was most likely (???) the turbo, thus
I managed to get the seller to take a grand of the price, which is basically how
much the turbo ended up costing me to rebuild.

The turbo cost $450 to rebuild and parts and some labour money to a mechanic
friend brought it up to the $1000 mark.  Many of the heat rings within the turbo
system were surprisingly quite expensive, around $60 for a ring of metal!!! 
When we got the turbo back together we started it up and to my horror smoke was
belching from the tail pipe.  I was straight on the phone to the turbo rebuilder
thinking they forgot to put in some seal or something stupid along those lines.
When they came out to have a look, after about an hour we noticed all this oil
through the breather hoses, both to the tappet(?) cover and the crankcase
ventilation hose dumping oil into the air filter.  After cleaning this out the
smoke started to clear *cough cough* * * ...

DASH:
- -----
At the time I also replaced the cracked dash with a recondition version ($400),
I think the Australian sun would affect these a LOT quicker than in the US.  One
HINT, the dashboard reconditioner said never to use a silicone based cleaner on
the dash as the dash deteriorates much quicker.  Since then I have been using a
silicon free antistatic cleaner (can't remember the name off hand).

INTERIOR:
- ---------
Many pieces were missing from the interior, through neglect I would assume.
Things such as ashtray and cig lighter (must have been a non-smoker as myself),
and sunroof clip (BTW my 931 comes with a manual sunroof, I have seen some
versions without, does anybody know if this is a particular option, or is it
just the year model I have).  The drivers seat had some stitching coming undone,
so I took the seat to an upholsterer to repair the stitching, and since then
have had nice comfortable sheepskin car seat cover tailor made ($950).  The all
important PORSCHE stereo (made in Japan) wasn't working, due to a blown fuse and
a disconnected lead on one of the speakers (VERY cheap repair).  I replaced most
of the missing interior parts, except for the cig lighter (as it is about $80
here), and since I don't smoke.....

EXHAUST:
- --------
I noticed a crack in the tail pipe muffler, which was fixed using a local brand
muffler ($130 including fitting), the genuine muffler is over $700.  However I
have had to go back once to get them fix the knocking it was causing.

BRAKES:
- -------
I had the brakes serviced ($200), and they told me (if I remember correctly)
that it had 944 brakes in the rear.  Does this sound familiar to anyone, is it
specific to the 931, or is it an after market fitting?

SMOKE again:
- ------------
I had a problem once it was up and running about once a day, when I got up to
the set of the lights near my place, it would start belching smoke while idling.
Well I had the Porsche dealer make his suggested alteration, by placing a plate
above the cam gear in the tappet cover to stop oil flicking into the breather.
This seems to have worked, and it was cheap at $50 including labour.

SYNCROS:
- --------
When I got the car the syncros were really bad, I couldn't change down into
first unless I basically stopped, even with doubling the clutch.  I finally got
Porsche to repair the syncros, when the fixed the above, thinking it would only
cost around $800 dollars or so.  What a shock I was in for, the teeth were
nearly worn off completely, and the dogteeth had to be cased onto 1st and 2nd
syncros down in Melbourne ($700 just for the casing).  The corresponding part
new was about $1500 because you have to buy a shaft or something along those
lines, this was my cheapest option.  It was in the shop for about 3 weeks and
an $1800 bill.  It had to go back in twice more, as they didn't replace the
selectors and it would pop out of 1st into neutral.  Hence another the couple of
days in the shop and another $500 (they were _nice_ enough not to charge me
labour the second time around).  I am still unsure whether if they have taken my
wallet for a ride.....  After that I decided that I was starting to dislike
mechanics...

CLUTCH:
- -------
The hydraulic clutch hose was leaking causing the clutch to alter
engage/disengage points.  Cheap repair by hydraulic hose repairer ($70) the
genuine hose (6" long) is approx $150.

At this stage I thought I had the car pretty much finished.  I now believe the
quote of another Porsche owner: If you were sane and had a choice between a
Porsche and leprosy, you would choose leprosy... you can cure it.

Current Problems:
- -----------------

Ring Blow-By:
- -------------
When I put new spark plugs in the car the other week, it started to run a bit
funny up high (say in 3rd gear then accelerating at about 100km/h), like it was
starving fuel.  So I put it to get the fuel injectors cleaned and have it dyno
tuned.  Well they broke a fuel lines taking one of the injectors out and it was
off the road for another 10days, while I stuffed around chasing up another part
as there were none in OZ at the time.  Continuing my distrust in mechanics.  I
finally managed to get it repaired temporarily after a wrecker sent the wrong
part, and the part from Stuttgart turned up about two days after it was back on
the road.  Anyhow the car was not running any better when I got it back.
The tune-up shop tried to rip me off for an alternator rebuild as well ($170)
for which I never gave them permission for (arguments still pending).

The mechanic reckons there is ring blow-by which is causing a lot of pressure to
come through the air filter from the Crankcase ventilation hose.  And he also
said it was down on compression.  It had really rough idling and actually
stalled when idling after giving it a bit of a squirt.  I pulled all the hoses
off and cleaned them out, there was a lot of junk in the return hose to the
some and it was partially blocked, but it still did not fix the pressure.  I saw
another friend of mine who is a mechanic and he doesn't believe there is much
wrong with the rings as it barely doesn't blow any smoke, even under high revs.
I got the figures from the dyno graph it is 124kw (166hp) at the engine and 88kw
(118hp) at the tyres.  The mechanic said that this is about average for a 931,
but this doesn't really fit in with the low compression (or am I wrong)?

The car went back into the shop, and they said they upped the idle speed to
compensate for when the idle drops (sometimes by 400 revs).  I would like to
know the opinion of other porschephiles, with regard to these problems.  If it
is rings or what? I saw an Ad for an engine overhaul kit from the Engine
Rebuilders Supply Co. at Moss Beach which I am seriously considering picking up.
I will be visiting the US at XMAS and San Francisco is my last stop on the
mainland.  The cost is $650 for the 924 turbo euro kit, but to get it into
Australia I am looking at the conversion rate + 52% import duty + %20 sales tax.
Does anybody know what exactly is in these kits, ie. pistons, etc.

Power Drain:
- ------------
I have a drain from the battery of 0.4 amp, which if left for a few days will
flatten the battery, so that it cannot turn over the engine sufficiently.  I
have bought a new battery, with the same result.  I have had the alternator
checked (and now rebuilt).  Funny things happen with the electrics, sometimes
turning a corner and indicating will cause the wipers to come on intermittently.
Also strange, if you pull the key out of the ignition sometimes the power will
turn off to the accessories.  I have asked an auto electrician about this and
he said he has had experiences with faulty ignition switches on these.  He
checked out the electrics but couldn't find anything, his only suggestion was
replacing the ignition switch which is apparently the same as a VW.  Any ideas?

Tyres:
- ------
I am planning new tyres, either:
	Dunlop D40 225/60 VR15; or
	Falken 225/60 ZR15
I though these might be a bit too wide for standard 931 wheels (6" I think), but a few tyre dealers suggested this size.  Another member of the Porsche club had a 931 for a few years, he believes I shouldn't go above 195, any suggestions?





Well that is about all I have to date, it is quite a lot.  I hope the
information above might be of some benefit, and others may have some ideas to
the remaining problems.

I have decided to do most work myself from now on, including if I have to
rebuild the engine.  I have some mechanic friends who are always willing to
help me out.  My trust in mechanical workshops is just about negative...

I don't remember seeing a "remedy".  Just start using the new stuff.
That's what I did.

The new stuff I am using is called "303 Protectant".  It is a Calif
Corp and the number is 800-223-4303 for finding a local source.
Actually anything without silicone or oil based products is better
than Armor-All.  You also want UV protection most.  Some other
products used by Detailers seems to leave the surface of rubber wet
and subject to rubbing off on everything like your pants or drying
cloths the next time you wash the car.  I've stopped using several
detailers and car wash palces because they wouldn't switch.

 I found it doesn't turn white if you miss a treatment for awhile, the
 surface just turns dull.  I only get to do it once a month if I'm
 lucky.  I don't use it on dash, mine is leather.
 I've been using it for over a year now and get lots of compliments.
 The one thing I like about it is that if you use it spareingly you
 get the nice black natural look without the "patent Leather" wet- black
 look which I don't like.

 Good luck.

Well, first question: how much money are you willing to spend?

Second question: what kind of performance? "Normal" street performance?
Autox performance? Time trials? Full-out road racing in some form
of mostly-showroom-stock category? Engine-type performance or 
handling-type performance (hey, now *THERE'S* a question...)

There are all kinds of things you can do to increase the engine
performance and remain CA smog legal.

But, you have to re-build the engine, and make all manner of changes. 
And, when you open the case, you may find that you *should* replace
at least one piston. If this is the case, then chuck the whole lot
and grab a set of TRW 4" (105mm) pistons and cylinders from George
Vellios. They're actually cheaper than "stock" replacements from
Mahle or Kopplenschmidt, by several hundred dollars. You can
find some racer-type who needs the big-valve heads you have and
swap for a set of small-valve heads, which will help your bottom-end 
performance tremendously. You can get a BRD throttle body and
Bosch Motorsport parts to pump up your CIS injection. You can chunk
the CIS and go to a high-butterfly throttle body Electomotive TEC II
EFI system (CA smog legal, oddly enough). If you do that, you can 
then consider cam changes, say to a 906 profile. And increasing the
compression is always a win...

So, how about if you go off and answer the two questions I asked, and
come back with a new question specifying what exactly it is that you
want to do....

The reconditioned dash came from Dashboard Restorations, here in
Brisbane, Australia.  The dash was an exchange job, and it was fitted
for OZ$420.  The breakdown (from memory) was $280 for the exchange
dashboard and $140 for the fitting.

I am not sure of the process, but it is not just replacing the vinyl
cover, they actually rplace the foam and heat shrink a new cover onto
it.  My dash was brown, and it has a slight shade of black in the
depressions of the vinyl.  They said they couldn't match up the black
shade, but the match is that close unless the restorer told me I
wouldn't have noticed.  They would like to know how Porsche puts the
black on the vinyl, apparently they do a lot of Porsche dash's!

The dash looks and feels like a new one, and for the price....

If you want any more information I can contact the restorer and maybe
send some material over.

Response to [1]:

The Yokohama 008RS tire, though very sticky, would make an excellent street
tire.  You can expect from 4k to 8k miles of normal street use.  They only
wear quickly when pushed VERY hard.............  Another great street tire is
the Yoko A503 (?); we have these on our BMW and wear+stick is wonderful
for a tire that should last 40k miles! But, the A503 would not be a good
Autocross tire.


Response to [2]

Having been a contract driver for Yokohama, and having tried BFG's and
Bridgestones, I feel that the new Yoko RS II's offer the best (which
has been proven by their wins in SCCA SOLO II competition) grip and wear
you can buy.  These tires are VERY Sticky- better than BFG's (IMHO)- and
wear MUCH longer than the BFG's.  Also, they have much better steering
input response (the BFG are rather sluggish on 'turn-in'), but require
much more control at the limit.  BFG's ,on the other hand, are easy to
drive at the limit and offer LOTS of feedback once the limit has been
exceeded (were as YOKO's have a tendency to let loose quickly when
their ultamite adhesion has been exceeded).

Again, this data is IMHO only.........

Subject: 951 head gasket, boost problem, steering rack, etc.

If anyone's interested, I'm doing a few big projects on my '86 951.  
I'm replacing the (2nd) head gasket (this time, by myself), fixing a 
turbo boost problem, replacing the steering rack, and fixing a CV 
joint.  I'm about 40% done with things right now, and expect to finish 
in about 3 more weekends.

Symptoms of a loosing a head gasket are the inexplicable loss of 
coolant (not to the floor), and over-pressurization of the coolant 
system (and subsequent dumping via the cap).  The symptoms build 
slowing over 6 months, and then go down hill in a rapid avalanche!  I'm 
willing to offer any info, advice, etc. for people in a similar position!

My steering rack lost its seals, and had to be replaced.  Per info 
obtained from Porschephiles, I obtained a rebuilt power core from Auto 
Doctor in Michigan.  $269 did it - vs. $1900 for a new one from the 
dealer!  Symptoms are easy: the power steering resevoir kept going 
down, followed by brown puddles on the floor.  The rack boots had 
filled with fluid (they seal very nicely despite no attempt at trying 
to do so, BTW).  Replacing the rack is a bit difficult, but not 
impossible.  You need to be a patient, yet aggressive mechanic.  Funny 
combination, huh?

I also had a boost problem.  The boost didn't come on until >3000-3200, 
about 1000 rpm too high.  The "curve-up" and max. boost were correct; 
only the bottom end was wrong.  This was a disadvantage in autocrosses! 
 The problem turned out to be a little, cheap gasket in the bypass 
elbow pipe.  It's made of some non-metallic compound and is soft.  It 
just fizzed away, allowing a small leak.

The CV has been moaning slightly for awhile now - I'll report back 
after that job gets done!

Anyone else out there have similar stories?

Porschephiles,

I need some advice about a 1984 928s.  My uncle offered his to me, and I
was wondering what a fair price would be.  I imagine he is willing to go a
little lower than average since he's my uncle, but I want to be able to 
justify my offer.

Some background on the car:
    1984 928s, black with black leather interior
    Every option
    40,000 miles (he just brought it in for a full 40,0000 service)
    My uncle is the original owner.
    It's never been in any kind of accident
    Exterior and interior are both perfect.

I believe he was thinking of asking $15,000 if he sold it to someone else.
What are the current values for the '84 928s?  How much lower than $15,000
should I ask without getting unrealistic?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Well, depends on what you mean by performance ignition...

If you want a programmable system, like an Electomotive or 
one of the other crankfired systems, then you may be out
of luck. There are adaptor for such systems that basicly turn
the distributor into a degreed sensor for the black box, 
and off you go...

If you have to use the original distribution set up for some
reason, the the best bet is to start with an Allison (or 
equivalent) optical pickup set, to get rid of the points.
Then you can install a CD ingition, like the Permatune, if
you are so inclined.

        Well there is a pretty big gap in the amount of information between
the factory manuals and the Haynes manual for the 944. The Haynes is so
cheap that it is good to have and they don't assume that you have all the
specialized tools of a factory mechanic so they make suggestions on how to
get around certain situations (some good, some not so good IMHO) that
require "Special Tool #$%#!"  However if your serious about working on your
944 or just want to gain a deeper understanding of Porsche engeneering the
factory manuals are great, all seven volumes. If you do decide on the
factory set I would go to your local dealer and order them direct so you
get copies of all the most current updates. Do not buy the "four volume
set", it's outdated. As I remember Kempton Bros. were trying to sell the
four volume set for
what you would have to pay for a new set from the dealer, about $175.
Otherwise there is the Haynes manual, about $12.

Eagle GT+4's???  Yuck!!!  I would STRONGLY advise against these tires.
They don't even drive that well in the dry - much less on snow/ice/water &
mud, etc.  The Yoko's are good as are many of the Michelin and Bridgestone
all-season offerings.  If you are looking mostly for mud/snow/ice reasons,
you should definitely consider M&S (rated) tires from these manufacturers.
Otherwise (i.e. if you drive in the wet a lot) you might consider
something like a Michelin XGT (high $$$), Yoko A-509 (reasonable $$$),
Dunlop D40 (high)/D60 (low), Bridgestone RE-71 (high)/HP-41 (low), etc.
Do expect to get what you pay for in a price/performance ratio.  Stay away
primarily from Pirelli and Goodyear - although I've heard a few positive
comments about Goodyear's new "Aquatread"

As far as the mail order places are concerned, for the most part they are
very good.  When buying tires from them, though, consider that you still
have to pay mounting, balancing, and shipping (no sales tax though!) which
can be a substantial amount.  Most tire dealers will include mounting &
balancing free with purchase.  Go to your local dealer and tell them that
you can buy the tire for say $20 a piece less from TireRack and see if
he'll cut you a deal.  Many of them will . . .  The mail order places are
usually worthwhile when buying big/expensive tires since the discount and
tax usually amounts to a lot more than mount & balance.

On more thing - the folks at TireRack are usually fairly knowledgeable
and helpful in chosing a tire that's appropriate for your particular
application.  This is not meant to be an advertisement, but I've dealt
with them many times and have always been pleased.

That reminds me of a joke - stop me if you've heard it . . .

Just to let you know there is a range of experience, I have had 
relatively good luck with Automotion, and have in general
considered them one of the higher quality Porsche aftermarket
suppliers. It appears that your milage may vary.

On the topic of factory shop manuals, I also assumed that the
aftermarket was the only place to shop a few years ago when I
bought my 944S. However, I found that after shopping around, the
local dealer gave me a price which beat everybody by a significant
amount. I suspect that this is a fuction of the individual dealer
(Schneider-Nelson in West Long Branch NJ), and I did get a 10% PCA
discount (which most dealers give, if not more), but I would at
least advise that you call a few dealers after you get the best
aftermarket price. There are dealers who advertise in Panorama
who seem to be selling parts at a discount, presumably looking for
volume, and it may make sense to call a few of them.  To the best of
my knowledge, the aftermarket suppliers are buying their manuals the
same place as the dealers (PCNA), and presumably for the same price.
It is not like some aftermarket parts where they can bypass the whole
Porsche supply line by going directly to the OEM.

If you are not a member of PCA, join. 

As someone else suggested, the Haynes manual is a poor substitute,
but at $15 or so it is well worth having, with or without the
factory manual.

I did it on a 944 Turbo in the driving light position.  I actually had
them come on simultaniously so I had 155W on the original 55 watt circut
(ran with the fogs off the fog switch).

I bought an addn'l relay but never put it in.

	One of the first things I did when I got my (UK spec) 944 16 months
ago was to replace the fog lamp H3s 55W bulbs with 100Ws. I have had
no problems with either the stock relay or the enclosures. I have
made this mod to other (non-Porsche) cars in the past, again with no
problems.

	I also replaced the 60/55W H4 bulbs (which I think are illegal in
the US?) in the main/dipped beams with 130/90W, yet again with no
problems.

What have you got against Pirellis?  I have Pirellis on the front and
Yoko's on the rear of my 944S, and the Yokos seem to both wear out
quicker and be less grippy (hard to judge front vs. rear of course,
but that's just my impression).  I've not had the 944 long enough to
do any proper comparisons, but my previous car was a Scirocco, and
replacing the standard Michelins with Pirellis gave a considerable
improvement in grip without a noticeable loss in wear.  The only
downside was the Pirellis were slippy cold, and only gripped when
they warmed up after a couple of miles (I think they were P60s, if
I remember rightly).

The Yokos will have to be replaced in the next few weeks, and I was
going to look for Pirellis, but now you've got me worried.

What brand was the 944S fitted with when new?

	- Craig @ SCO nr London.

P.S. At least in the UK, Pirellis also have the advantage of being
somewhat cheaper than Yokos.

The latest Pano (with Spot on the cover; I just got it yesterday, is it
November already?) has an ad for shop manuals from Stoddard.  The 944 set is
about $205.  I also noticed, to my chagrin, that the 924 set is priced at
approx $165.  Like Frank, I had assumed two years ago that the aftermarket
would be cheaper, and paid $300 for my set :-(

I've found that the Haynes 924 manual occasionally fills in the numerous
gaps left by the shop manual (but that may be less frequent with the other
models, which are blessed with more comprehensive shop manuals).

Subject: RE: Relay Req'd for 100W H3 Fog Lamp Bulbs

Lee, I put 100W lamps in 951 driving lamps, as did Steve Timmins.  I 
used a separate relay that ran off the high beam line that also allowed 
them to flash (in lieu of foglamp flashing, which has less effect due 
to their aiming).  I used a relay because I also changed the headlamp 
bulbs to 55/100W, and didn't want to put 400W on a single switch/wire.  
The headlamps are fine and the switch has survived perfectly after 6 
years this way.

This was on a 1986 car with the new central electric box under the 
hood, and a little flat black module to control the flashing, etc. of 
Euro vs. ROW cars.  I modified that module (jumpers internally) to be 
like the European schematic.  It's a charm.

I also have a VW with 55/100 bulbs, without a relay.  The wire gauge is 
sufficient, and I measured the voltage drop and calculated power loss 
through the wiring.  It's not bad - this is another case of modern, 
robust German wiring (I think they have an idea what we'll be doing 
with aftermarket lighting...).  After 3 years I have zero problems.

The only thing you should be monitor is if the high beam switch itself 
can handle the load without pitting or other physical damage.  I expect 
the 944 switch can handle it; it has in my case.

 Some time back, I planned to replace the fog lamp bulbs in my 944S with
100W H3 (as opposed to the 55W stock bulbs).  I recall some discussion
about needing a relay to channel power from battery->relay->lamp as
opposed to battery->switch->relay->lamp (or somesuch).

 Has anyone actually done this with or without the relay?

 Schematics around for the relay work? (wishful thinking)

Gahhhh!!! P6 - the worst tires I've had the pleassure of wishing I
didn't have. Their ultimate grip was "poor" (in terms of what followed:
Yoko A001R's), there was virtually no warning whatever at the limit,
and once they broke loose, they were GONE... no chance of a save most
of the time. Also they were poor on wet, awful on snow, and on ice you
might as well be running racing slicks as P6's. Naturally, this is all
in my own opinion, and based on my own experience, please don't sue me
or send Guido over to break my legs, Mr. Pirelli, I take it all back,
I didn't mean it, but no I won't be buying any more Pirelli products

Alas I can not specifically diagnose why you have had difficulties with the
Yoko's without further information about specific models of tires you used
front and back.  From my experience, (and IMHO of course), the Pirellis
make good DRY weather tires - though not entirely up to the performance of
some of their competitors. In the wet - and even more so - in snow - they
behave horribly.  I attribute this to the solid rubber tread center
dividing the tread blocks on the right and left side of the tread.  This
is NOT as much of a problem on some of the high-performance models (P600,
P700, P-Zero), but rather with the more common/popular P5/P6/P77 model
series.  Also, you pointed out a significant problem with the Pirellis
yourself - they are very slippery when cold!  I spell this D-A-N-G-E-R!
I had P77's (supposed to be all-season or maybe even M&S rated passenger
car tires) on a front-wheel drive coupe once.  The car itself (Subaru XT
 - don't laugh!) behaved exemplary in bad weather conditions.  After I
switched from Michelin XZX (bottom of the line) tires to P77's, I could no
longer round corners at previously effortless speeds in the wet, I had
trouble getting out of my driveway in the snow and I almost rearended a
couple of people due to reduced wet braking.  My experience with P6's on
my mom's Peugeot were similar.
By comparison, the Yoko A509's I recommended to my former boss saved me
big time one day when I was driving his Miata - with HIS girlfriend in
the passenger seat - in wet conditions at night.  I rounded a shallow turn
over a hill at around 80+ only to find a barricade in the middle of the
road.  I evaded the barricade and kept the car on the pavement.  I am
certain that any Miata owner will agree that the car handles HORRIBLY in
the wet (especially on factory Bridgerocks) - the Yoko's fixed this
problem and saved my butt.
As far as tire life is concerned - generally speaking tire life is
inversely proportional to performance.  Softer rubber means better grip and
worse wear.  The Pirelli's last nicely but - as mentioned above - don't
have the same grip (IMHO).
I did do one non-scientific braking test once.  A simple 60 MpH stop
without ABS.  Using the above mentioned Subaru XT on dry concrete, the non-
scientific results (conducted on a single day though) were:

    Tire                                  Average stop
    Generic (40,000 mile/$30 tire)           ~160 ft.
    Yoko A509 (20,000 mile/$65 tire)         ~125 ft.
    Yoko A008RTu (race tire)                 ~110 ft.

Quite a difference!  For my peace of mind - it's worth it . . .

BTW - I believe that the GOOD Pirellis (P600/700/Zero) are quite PRICEY.

Hope this helps - although I am sure that many different people will have
many differing opinions.  I would really like to see one of the reputable
car mags (is there such a thing?) do a SCIENTIFIC tire test for mid to
upper level street tires . . . dream on, right?

I've heard opinions from others that the D4 (not the D40) was even worse 
than the P6. I drove the D4's on the track for a year or so, and they
are very slippery (lots of slip angle), but if you are willing to use
lots of slip angle they did all right (1:09's at Lime Rock on a stock
car).

On P6's, I instructed at Lime Rock for MBNA, and the first car I drove
was a 190E 2.6 Sportline with P6's. They felt relatively slippery (like
the D4's, but it was hard to make a direct comparison because of car
differences), but I found them to be reasonably controlable near the
limit (or at least the limit I was using in that car). The intriguing
thing is that when I came in and started griping about the tires,
another instructor told me that the P6's were the best tires there
(these were all street Mercedes, various models). I guess everything
is relative, but relative to any of the pseudo-race tires, including
the older A001R, P6's are certainly mediocre at best.

I had this exact problem with an '84 944 I used to own.  Fortunately,
the fix is easy and inexpensive.  Just go to any decent auto parts
store and ask for something called "dum-dum".  I'm not quite sure what
it's made of or what it's real name is, but it is similar to the butyl
tape used to install and seal windshields.  It comes in strips with a
paper backing that you just peel off.  Remove the lens (easy on a 944,
even for non-mechanics), put a bead of dum-dum around the back and
reinstall.  Problem solved (although you might also try to somehow
seal up the holes you drilled in the lens :-)).

I agree: the Haynes manual is very weak on model specifics.  However, I've

The '87 944 series cars did indeed come with Pirelli P6 tires, among others.  I

When it comes to street tires, any given tire seems to be loved by half the
world, and hated by the other half.  I would suspect, on balance, that you would
really be hard pressed to buy a truly bad tire from any of the name-brand
manufacturers.  Commodity marketplaces being what they are.

I looked around for some of the problems that you had suggested (eg.
vaccum leak, bad or swollen hoses, loose clamps, O2 sensor, head
temperature sensor), but couldn't find anything myself.  So i took it
to my mechanic who diagnosed it as a "idle control valve" problem. He
replaced this valve a couple of days ago and the problem seems to have
gone away. Hopefully it will stay that way.

I have used Pirelli P6's on my (now wife's) 8 VW GTI. They are a pretty good
tire for light-moderate autocross, but in the rain, those tires are potential
killers. With the P6's, the GTI has a strong tendency to have the rear break
loose in even a moderate turn. As a result of this,  I wouldn't reccomend them

LOTS of seat time. Lots of interesting excercises. 5 timed runs at

Also, the SCCA guys do something similar. Lots more people, about the same 
number of instructors.

Cost? PCA school was $25, and included a school mug, and lunch. (all you
can eat -- actually *MORE* than you can eat -- pizza). SCCA is similar.

If you really HAVE to drive your Porsche on the snow,
you might consider getting snow tires. Lots of folks
have dry tires, wet tires, and track tires, one more
set can't hurt. Real snows (with some studs, if allowed)
go pretty far towards keeping your treasured car out
of the ditch. Back when I still had P6's mounted, the
car had a tendency to commence uncontrolled rotation
on snow when driving in a straight line - once it happened
on the Mass Pike (with me driving), and it was only due to
the alert brake application of the Greyhound Bussnaught driver
behind me that kept me from becoming a P6 Pancake. Plus
a bit of throttle application on my part as I was headed
backwards towards the ditch kept me on the highway.
Another time (my girlfriend was driving) it let loose
on the offramp from 495 to 95N, spinning into the guardrail.
These incidents were mere days apart - I had snows on the
car as soon as it came back from the body shop.

Subject: ignorance, tires and fishbowls, also

Ignorance: what is IMHO? (**PLEASE** dont' tell people that I didn't know
what it means. PLEEEEEASE.)

Tires: My '85 944 came with P6. They certainly seemed good on the street,
both dry and rain. On the track, they were TERRIBLE in the rain. (I felt
like I was walking a tightrope in ice skates.) I enjoyed them in the dry on
the track -- easy to do trail throttle maneuvers, and I found gentle
breakaway -- but after I got RE71, I realized how much inferior the P6 had
been. (Also the RE71 were MUCH better in the rain on the track.)

Fishbowls:  I had the left rear light (never the right) fill up with water
repeatedly.  Also, the rear deck carpet smelled mildewey.  I concluded that
the rear wiper bushing was letting water seep in. The solution was to remove
the wiper, and put a few gobs of vaseline around the opening. Presto! No
more problem.

Subject: RE: Is it a 944, or a fishbowl?

I've seen a few 944's with water in the rear lenses.  It's not common, 
but it does happen.  I think there's a defective seal between the 
housing and the lenses itself.

Yah, there have been a lot of opinions about tires floating around 
here; remember that each opinion is quite subjective and varies with 
vehicle type and owner's expectations and biases.

That said, it's my opinion (having had P6's and P7's on 944s) that you 
will have no luck in snow or other winter-like conditions with them.  
It's not that you'll crash (which you will), but that you'll never get 
out of the driveway!  Get some cheap steel wheels with some agressive 
snow / M&S tires on all 4 corners - you'll be glad you did!

Sigh. Yesterday a friend informed me that a couple of my brake lights
were out.  Upon close examination I discovered - get this - that they
were completely filled with water! It was like having a mobile
aquarium..

I drilled pin-size holes into the lights to drain the water.. I guess
that was the cheapo way out..

I now believe that this water could have been causing many of the
bizarre electrical problems I've noticed as of late.  (When I replaced
the bulbs, not only were they burned out, but they had actually
imploded, and bits & pieces of them were scattered all over the lens.)

Any one else have this type of sealing problem?  It seemed quite odd;
the car isn't that old.. ('87)

Subject:      Fishbowls

The leak problem extends beyond 944's. The 924 has aquariums in the back also.
It isn't the fault of the car, but the coveralled yahoos of P-car folklore,
who remove the lenses to fix something and neglect proper sealing when they
reinstall.
The seals on the rear window, and the sunroof and likely the doors, will
eventually fail. Those take money to fix. A full set of new seals will
dent your checking account but the fix is relatively simple.
My 931 has a swimming pool on the passengers side coming from somewhere
below the battery and appearing under the dash. That seems to be taking
some time to find the source of the leak, but once found the repair is cheap.
The disease has now spread to the the big round side marker lights at the
front. I don't know how it is managing to take on water. I have yet to
attempt a cure. Worse, the space is too small for even the skinniest guppy,
so there's no possibility of adding fish and leaving the leak alone. ;-)
Is it possible to fix *all* the leaks in cars that are over 10 years old?
Does it ever end?   ;-)

It looks great.  The info I had about the car in my earlier post was from

leather interior.  It's got 47,000 miles on it.  The interior really is
perfect.  The body is perfect (never been in an accident), but the paint
shows its age (a few small nicks in the nose from rocks, and some scratches

get rid of the squeak?

Where is the best place to get service manuals for the car?  Is there any

i have an '89 951S that served a very happy track junkie year before its

at 1.2 bar total, couldn't figger why, and the problem went away for
good with a restart.

bad gas?  who knows.  no worry.  messrs dmr/klr just doing their duty.

two years later, my trusty steed simply can't keep it up.  semi-goosing
it in corners or on-ramps now *guarantees* low-boost behavior that is
only temporarily cured by a power cycle.

the car has recently been to the dealer for a high idle (bad microswitch)
and suspected air leak (bad cold behavior) in addition to the boost problem.
the other symptons are history, the boost problem remains.

Being one of the few who has actually completely dismantled and cut up a
951 into little tiny peices, I can say there really aren't that many
connections;^)

It sounds to me like your bypass valve is stuck or the connection has
come loose.  Look on the funky rubber boot which oes from the turbo to
the intercooler - connection pipe.  On top you'll see a barrel shaped
(sortof) black plastic gizmo with a vacuum line sticking out of the top
and a hos which goes to the intake intercooler cross pipe.  Check this
connection and/or switch this bugger out with a known good unit.

I got Emil's old race engine because he swapped out motors in search of
the problem.  Apparently dealers don't know about  it either.

A very temptorary ('till engine shutoff) loass of boost is from the
knowck sensor trying to retard the timing as much as possible anf then
giving up.  Used to happen to me on bad gas+hot days.

FYI,
        Steve

The horsepower claim is for about 3 hp, it's not much but for $45, but it's
not bad. It also provides better (cleaner) filtration and I suppose it is
more economical over the long run. The car does not need re-tuning because
the K-Jetronic works by measuring the mass air flow and sending fuel. More
air simply means more fuel.

Another way of improving the flow is porting and polishing the intake and
heads. A way of doing this is to run an abrasive fluid through them for
the appropriate time. A company called Extrude Honing (I think) does this.
Does anyone know how effective and expensive this process is?

(off of a 928) would work.  All I ask is that the rims would be straight-finish

That seems real odd.  They did away with the leather dash in 80? 81?.
Overall sounds like a great car, and if you get it for a good price it
can't be beat.  Since you said it had ALL options then I assume it's
an automatic.  That eliminates one big 928 pain:  drivetrain.
Clutches and synchros are notorious, but maybe not at 47k (yet).  Take
a good close look at ALL electricals.  Porsche did a horrendous job in
making them withstand the elements and wear.  Have the entire central
warning system checked to make sure nothing has been bypassed.  Often
this is the easiest way to solve a minor, yet pain-in-the-butt
problem with the CWS.  How does the alarm work?  These also have a
terrible reputation for corrosion and subsequent failures (honest
Officer, it really IS my car!)

The disadvantage of the 2nd idea is that you lose all the later tech

You should.  If for no other reason than they're FANTASTIC cars that
are grossly undervalued by the market.  If the public ever catches on
you're in for a bit of profit.  And they say that '96 is the last year
for the 928.  That may help them appreciate.

Good luck!

I think there is some confusion here. There are two different kinds of
technical updates. There are updates to the shop mnual. A new PCNA
shop manual contains all of the updates to date. The updates can also
be purchased separately from PCNA (through a dealer) to update any
vintage manual to a current one. The shop manual updates only apply to
the manual for a single type of car (911 series, 944 series, etc.).
The shop manual updates are not cheap, but they are not as bad as the
manual itself.

In addition to manual updates, PCNA publishes technical bulletins.
these are distributed to dealers, one at a time (typically a few pages
each) to provide up to the minute changes. At the end of the year,
PCNA binds these together into a volume of all of the technical
bulletins for a particular calendar year, and sells the (softcover)
bound set for about $15-20. This is a good way to keep track of
later changes applicable to your older car without continuing to
update the shop manual. Maintenance procedure changes originally
distributed in the technical bulletins typically also appear later
in the shop manual updates. These books of technical updates cover
the entire Porsche product line (each update defines the models 
which it covers).

I can highly recommend the PCA Zone 7 Autocross School that is conducted every
spring.  This year it was put on by Loma Prieta Region.  It's format is a
two-day (weekend) event where Saturday is a series of mini-courses that cover
the most common autocross challenges (chicanes, increasing and
descreasing-radius turns, slolom, box-turns, etc.). Then on Sunday, they put it
all together in a "real" timed autocross encorporating techniques learned on
Sat.

It's a good format, especially for the totally new autocrosser.  They limit it
to 50-60 students (which is actually too many in my opinion)  and have 20-30
instructors.  Cost is in the neighborhood $50, which this year included Sat.
night dinner.  If you belong to one of the Bay Area PCA regions, you should see
the ad in your newsletter come spring.

 My '82 certainly has a leather dash!!  May the leather dash became an option sometime?
 Mine sqeaks when it gets real warm.  Try some Hide Food.  It's great for leather.
 Sort of like body lotion except for cow hide.  See if you can work some into the space
 between the dash and the windshield.  I'm sure it will work.  The stuff looks like
 Vaseline Intensive care lotion, and liquefies when it gets warm (>80f).

 Anyone out there know what the total production of 928's to date is?  How
 rare are they?  How do the numbers compare to, say, the 356 or 914 (two
 ends of the spectrum of used Porsche prices, but possibly similar production
 numbers?) BTW, any ideas why 356's are so pricey while 914's continue to be
 at, or near, (don't forget the early 924's (no flames please :|)) the bottom
 of the used Porsche price range?

The factory driver's manual for my 1967 912 contains acceleration curves 
measured by the factory, you might check your own driver's manual to see 
if it contains some curves for your car.  If you don't have the driver's 
manual, you can order one from Tweeks (Long Beach, CA and Indianapolis, IN) 
or probably from your local Porsche dealer.

Tweeks also stocks some nice books with reprints of all the Car & Driver articles 
on Porsches.  There are five volumes covering the period from 1955 to 1986.  
You would probably want the volume covering 1970 to 1976.

Hope this helps!

I'd like to see the 912E included in EP. Something else out there to pass 8{).

Seriously, the 912E is basicly a 2.0 liter 914/4 engine jammed into a 
'76 911 tub. Much like the original 912 before it. Made about 90 HP in
stock trim. Should be very comparable with the 914 2.0 liter in most
respects. Many, many, many opportunities for tuning, brake mods, etc.
Basicly everything you know about 911 chassis setup plus everything you
know about 914/4 engine setup. I'd expect, under the '93 Production
rules, to be able to make a car that would be faster than most of the
914s and 356s, and competitive with the Super Sevens. The big bug-a-boo
is how heavy does the car have to be, and how much surgery can you do
to maintain that weight. The 911 tub would make the 912E be about the heaviest 
thing in the class...

Damn, if that goes through, I may have to start selling 914s and looking for
a nice 912E...

If you lived here in Boise, I'd recommend that the car not only be
started, but driven once, maybe twice a week (preferably on Saturday
and Sunday). We have a tough climate here that is particularly bad on
stored cars. Furthermore, I'd be willing to sacrifice my time to 
properly take care of your car for you.   ;-)

More seriously, I doubt that a month would bother the car at all.
However, I'll defer to the experts if they say differently.

Chris -

Given a suitable storage place (dry garage), the only thing I would probably
worry about in a month's storage would be the battery.  Even disconnected, it
may noticably discharge after three weeks or so.  If you can keep it on a
trickle charger, so much the better.

Well, it took me about 30+ hrs to virtually remove everything in
the engine bay to get those cam cover.  The heads were pretty easy to
take out.  The bottom bolts on cam cover were very hard to reach.
And because the sapce between the chasis and the cam cover was so little,
I had to use two different allen wrenches.  By the way, in order to remove
the bolts inside the cam cover, I needed a LONG allen bit which I didn't
have, allmost like the 911 cylinder head nuts.

Anyways, I'm going to get a valve job now, but have a question about
the rest of the engine.  Actually a few questions:
1) what are some signs that would lead me to re-hone the cylinder walls?
2) with 130k mi, would it be advisable to change the main+rod bearings,
   and how much more work would that take?
3) does the head gaskets need glue or not?

On a side note, I get some valves a while ago at Electrodyne really
cheap, and they don't match!  It looks like that the valves for all 928
made up to '85(when the 4-valve arrived) for US is different than
the ones made for the ROW.  I have Euro 928S which has different
valves than US 928S.  My valves are larger.  I was lead to believe
my a few suppliers that all valves before '85 are the same, WRONG!

So if anyone out there wants US 928 2-valve valves, both intake and exhaust,

What a bear, John!  They don't make the water-coolers easy to be 
repaired, for sure.

1) Signs of needing to re-hone the cylinders: excessive scoring/wall 
damage, or if things were so worn out that the stock rings couldn't 
seal well any more.  You might want to get some precision measuring 
tools and check the dimensions of things.  The Porsche aluminum blocks 
are very, very strong however, so I wouldn't expect much of a problem.  
Important note: if you hone the cylinders, there's a very special 
technique you must use, in order to get the silica (or was it silicon?) 
crystals to line the wall - it's not just a simple cutting job.  Be 
very careful with this one or you'll trash the block!

2) Yes, by all means, if you've torn down the engine this far at 130K 
miles, do the bottom end.  All bearings wear, and at that mileage I'm 
sure they're quit due.

3) I do not believe any gaskets need glue, including the head and cam.  
Double check me in your manuals, or with Porsche tech bulletins, etc.

I have no information regarding valves, although Kim Crumb in PCA 
Nordstern Region (not on this alias) would know.

1. Typically these engines are not re-honed because of the cylinder
wall treatment process used.  Unless you see obvious scoring or
galling, like very shiny patches or dark discoloration your best
bet is to leave it alone.  You can test for proper ring sealing
by purchasing a kit that allows you to seal the bore and inject
shop air into the cylinder with the head off the measure
leakdown in each cylinder.  I think this is the best thing you
can do at this point.
2. You would need to removed the transmission, torque tube and
bellhousing to access the flywheel to remove it.  Then you'd
take out the front suspension to finally access the crank.  You'd
be better off taking the whole motor out.
3. No glue on the head gasket.  Proper torque and a smooth
*straight* surface are all thats necessary.

A recent query has brought up the subject of trickle charging.  I am

was dead already) and just replaced it in the spring; the second  winter I
monitored the weather and drove the car on  days after a rain had removed the
salt from the roads (not many here in Michigan).  This winter I'd like to
store the 944 properly.  Are there any particularly good "trickle chargers?"
Particularly bad ones? Brand names?  Costs?  Is this just a   trip to Sears?
I don't recall seeing them in the catalogues that come with Porsche ownership

Subject: RE: trickle charge

The only thing a trickle charger needs to do is offset the internal 
loses and vehicle drain (clock, alarm, etc.).  It shouldn't charge the 
battery much at all.  A 1 amp current for the whole winter is too much; 
I'd recommend .1-.25 amp.

I've seen "trickle" chargers, but they're usually too high a current 
and $$.  I built one from parts at Radio Shack - a 12V transformer, 
rectifier or 4 (depends on design), and a box, cord, and power LED.  
Cheap, simple, and effective.

For storing in general, over-inflate the tires (and roll the car 
periodically to keep the tires from flat-spotting), clog air inlets and 
exhausts where rodents can climb in and nest, and add gas stabilizer to 
a full tank if the car will be sitting for over 3 months or so.  Insure 
your oil is reasonably clean, too.

If you put the car on jack stands, don't let the wheels droop.  This 
exposes shock rods to moist air, and can causes corrosion damage.  
Support the car safely via some sprung part (hub, suspension arm, etc.).

And as a last item, I'd add one thing from my own experience: keep a 
close eye for rodents!  They love to nest in the engine bay, and eat 
wires and insulation.  They'll ruin the car in no time!

YES!  Nothing worse than starting up your car after a long storage, and
experiencing the pleasant odors of an abandoned, decaying baby mouse.  UCK!

It's also a good idea to detail the car (i.e. remove bug & tar stains,
and treat the rubber), and then cover it all with a breathable blanket.

Subject: Dash Restoration


For those of you with cracked dashes, especially the ones that own
924/944 cars, read on.

I have been collecting information and have found three companies that
do this work in the USA.  I found other companies that sell 911 and
other European car dashes and do repairs.  These companies can restore
the 924 style dash.  They don't care about the condition of the dash.
They rebuild it from scratch, using some sort of vacuum forming
process.  The price range is from $335 to $430 for the 924 and takes 2
to 3 weeks I was told.  This compares to about $200 in Australia per
Kelvin Ross, who started me on this research project.  I really hate
the Dash-Topper / Coverlay fix.  Of course, you have to remove the dash
and live without the car for a couple of weeks...  Removing the dash is
the easy part.  Living without the car is something you learn to do
when you own a 931.  I forgot, you might have to justify the expense to
a significant other.  That could be the hardest part.

Dash Specialists in Medford, Oregon.  Price - $335 including shipping
back to the San Francisco area.  He said he had been doing these for
years and that you would never have another problem after he got
finished with it.

The Newdash Group in Phoenix.  Price -  $375.

Depends on what you want to take out.  If it's just the switch in the
dash, it releases from behind by depressing a tab a the bottom and top
of the switch.  Not sure how hard it is to get to the back of that particular
switch.  You might have to pull the glovebox, which isn't hard.

>(2) Is there supposed to be a light for/in the cigarette lighter?

Yes, and in fact it's one of the lamps dimmed by the potentiometer for
controlling dash brightness.

The official replacement interval for the 944S timing belt is ridiculous: 45K
miles, followed by retension at 2 - 2.5K miles, and retension again at 30K
miles.  I recommend replacing every 20K to 25K, with the retension at 2K.

If you own a 944S and do not have the .02 version belt, I highly recommend
upgrading to it immediately (as in "tomorrow").  I think the full part number is
944.105.323.02.  This recommendation courtesy of our area's PCNA service repr,
who pointed out to me that its design was significantly enhanced (strengthened)
for use in the 944S2.

(My .00 timing belt broke on me at last year's Zone 1 autocross, on the grid of
all places, despite all the right maintenance.  It was about 27K miles old, and
had been retensioned a few times during its lifetime.)

No idea what the replacement interval for balance shaft belts is.  A failure by
one of them is uncomfortable but not injurious to the engine, I am told.

Well, as a counter example, I recently had my 944S timing and balance
shaft belts replaced at 48 000 miles - I noticed the reset valve timing
gave me better low end oomph, but there was no indication that there
was anything amiss with the belts themselves - in fact, the check
after a further 2 500 miles revealed that the _new_ balance shaft drive
belt was cracked (a manufacturing defect, they said).

I'd say 48 000 is plenty soon enough for replacement, unless you regularly
thrash your engine, but it's probably a good idea to check and retension
them at around 24 000.

Oh, and the new belts whine a lot more than the old ones :-(
and the 48 000 mile service cost me a whisker under #1000 :-( :-(.
Such is the price of keeping a full set of official Porsche stamps

Subject: Timing Belt Replacement for 944s

Peter, since I do my own wrenching and I own the timing belt tension
gauge (cost > $350) I change my timing belt once a year.  The belt is
cheap.  The problems it causes when it breaks are not cheap.  If you
are paying someone to do your work, I would recommend a change at no
greater than 25K mile intervals.  (When I do these jobs, I charge $60
for changing and tensioning and $30 for checking and adjusting tension
 - to tell you the truth, I would prefer not to do it at all...but
that's another story...)

The balance shaft belt, as Kevin Gross points out, does not
demonstrate a catastrophic failure mode.  I actually had one break on
me (the only symptom was that the motor became buzzy) at 50K miles.
We ran the car for a couple of days without the belt (or its remnants)
until we could get a replacement.  The only concern I have is that if
the balance shaft belt breaks and gets tangled up with the timing
belt.  My thinking right now is that I will replace it at 30K mile
intervals...

I would recommend the same interval, barring opinions to the contrary.
The part is not expensive, and I think replacing at 25K miles (max) can
be considered "cheap insurance."

(Since I'm in the office at the moment, I don't have the official service
guidelines in front of me.  The 944S recommendation came from the 944S2
guidelines published in '89.  I can look up the last-published set for the
bivalvers at home if you'd like.  Let me know.)

Hi, I'm fairly new to the net and have heard that this is the news group

#1 What do self-maint people do about distributer caps and rotors? How often
   do you replace them? Do you "clean" them up or actually put new units in?
   I see that performance sells Bosch caps for $57.80 and Bosch rotors for
   25.50.

#2 My rear-view mirror is loose, and I would like to fix it. It appears that
   the round section that attaches to the windshield is the culprit. What
   do you guys and gals do? Crazy glue? :-)

#3 My shift knob is shot, and the leather has worn off/torn away. Are the 
   shift knobs sold by Performance Ok? Leather is $49, mahogany is $54...

#4 Basically same as #1, except for spark plug wires. Are there "performance"
   wires that I should look at, or again, are the wires sold in the
   Performance catalog Ok? Fyrebraid wires for 944 are $189, "Heavy Duty"
   wires are $168.50.

#5 Here's another stupid one: What do people like in Wind Shield wipers?
   (wipers that work eh?) I seem to have bad luck with the wipers I have
   been buying at the local autoparts store... They look great for about
   a month, but after that, they streak, and one set put a nice 1/2" wide
   glass scratch right at driver's eye level.

#6 Related to #5: I have this nice curved scratch in my wind shield that
   I would like to get rid of. It isn't deep, it looks almost like a frosted
   beer mug (kinda)... You probably need more info, but in general, what
   should I do? Take it to a windshield repair place?

Stats: 1984 944 with 92k miles, but it does have a new paint job and new
suspension parts (shocks, springs, bars, etc)...

Thanks for listening to these admittedly silly and small-time questions!

I also recommend frequent belt changes (25-30K miles) and interim
adjustments (2K, then 10-15K miles) for any 944 series car. However,
while the timing belt for the 8 valve cars is relatively cheap, the belt
for the 16 valve (944S) is not. I spent, if I recollect, about $160
for the .02 belt from the dealer (the ONLY source I can find for the
actual Pirelli belt), even with the 10% PCA discount. I would still
replace your 944S belt at 25-30K, but there is in my humble opinion
no need to replace it significantly more often.

As everyone else notes, the balance shaft belt is not so critical,
but it is cheap, even for the 944S, so I would replace it at the
same intervals. 

By the way, you don't need the expensive tool to tension the timing
belt on 87 and newer cars, including the 944S. There is a built-in
tensioning system. You do need the tool to tension the balance shaft 
belt, but that is not so critical, so you might choose to skip one
of the interim tensionings on it if you don't have access to the
tool.

One example of a belt that survived for 48K miles does not convince me
that all belts will last 48K miles. The penalty of guessing wrong is
very high, especially for a 16 valve where there are more valves to
bend. There are a large number of counter-examples of 944 and 944S
owners who have spent $2-4K on engine work because they chose not to
retension/replace (I don't have any statistics on how many didn't
do which).

By the way, of the belts I know which have broken, counting several
in cars other than Porsches, "thrashing" the engine doesn't seem
to be directly related, or at least the failures don't seem to
occurr then. Most of the failures I have seen happen at idle or
on starting. Therefore, I would not put too much faith in gentle
treatment as a way to prolong belt life.

I noticed that Auto Parts Club has the Bosch rotors for about $18 and I

for 944 owners is that they have front brake rotors for 83-86(?) 944's for

I noticed that Performance Products sells the motor mounts for $175 each.

Subject: Timing Belts for 944



With all of the recent buzz about 944 timing belts I thought
I'd offer this little tip:

If you are wondering if you have a broken timing belt because
your 944 stopped running, here's a simple check:  Remove the
small plastic plug right above the distributor cap on the
distributor housing and you'll see the timing belt and cam
timing gear.  Rotate the engine and observe that the gear
moves; if it don't then your belt is busted!  You can rotate
the engine on manual transmission cars by putting it in
gear with the ignition off and pushing.  Automatics will have
to turn the pullies.

This check works well to kill the time while you're waiting
for the tow truck on the side of the road.

The .02 belt version only applies to the 944S (16 valve). I don't know 
what the most current version of the 8 valve belt is, or how critical
it is that you get the very latest belt version. For the 16 valve,
it appears (based on Kevin Gross' experience, as well as Porsche's
service bulletins) that it is very important to get the .02 belt.

I don't know the details of how the belt fails when it gets loose.
It is certainly possible that it runs into itself. However, in
failures of other timing belts I have seen, the typical failure is
that the crankshaft pulley teeth clean off the appropriate number
of teeth of the belt so it can turn without moving the belt. It is easy
to see how a loose belt would change shear stress on the bases of the 
teeth from the crankshaft pulley into bending stresses on the teeth, due
application of the force further away from the root of the teeth,
and that would at first glance be my vote for the failure mechanism.
There could also be an issue with the extent to which all teeth in
contact with the crankshaft pulley share the force equally when the
belt is loose (i.e. it could shear or weaken them one at a time).

By the way, you mentioned "certain years of 944s". To my knowledge,
all years of the 944 series have had the problem. Porsche has
continued to update the belt design over the years, but I don't
know of any higher incidence of belt failures in any particular
year or years. The 16 valve cars (944S, 944S2) have a fundamentally
different belt (wider), but they are not immune either.

Dunno about the retail aftermarket, but the 944S/2 .02 belt is definitely
available through wholesale distributors, the kind who deal with shops
in purchase volumes of many $thousands a month.  I brought just such a copy
from my mechanic's inventory to this year's Zone 1 autocross, just to make
sure I wouldn't need it!  Not sure about the cost, but he seems to think
it cost him sixtyish dollars.  Ask your local Porsche indy.

Subject: Re: Timing Belt Replacement for 944s

Regarding Dave's question about how the timing belt fails, I don't really know. 
There are two root causes I am aware of: belt tension and sprocket wear.  Either
or both can cause the belt to jump a tooth.  I suspect that having jumped a
tooth (or more), the incorrect synch between the cam(s) and the crank may cause
a valve to collide with a piston, freezing the cam and then the belt (perhaps
only momentarily but repeatedly), finally leading to the crank sprocket's
ripping teeth out of the belt.  I'm making this all up, more or less.  It's
consistent with the noises and aftermath of my failure.  Love to know whether it
really goes this way, or whatever... anyone know better?

What's wrong with the wires you have?  If they're gone, shell out for the
OEM parts, which are very well made.  If not, invest the money in a driver's
school for yourself and leave your wires alone.

I stick with the OEM refills, which are cheap.  Rubber is rubber.  Keep the
windshield as clean as you can, clean the wiper blades when you wash the car,
and use Rain-X.

John Paterek wrote a few years ago about a polish called, I think Rare-Ox or
something homonymic, made by Eastman.  He use it to get wiper scratches out of

Yes, I have been involved in the replacement of a few 944 motor mounts.

I would not recommend that the amateur mechanic try this unless he has
a hydraulic alignment rack with the movable dolly racks.  Not only
will this allow you to lift the car so you can stand under it, it will
allow you to support the engine and drivetrain while you have the
crossmember and motor mounts removed.  I have tried this job with
lesser arrangements and will not do another without the rack.

The best time and place to do this yourself is at a tech session
when you have access to this kind of rack.  (If you don't know what
tech session means, contact your local PCA region.)

Yes, the new turbo motor mounts solve the problem.

I believe this to be an easy job suitable for one with only hand tools
and a portable hydraulic jack. All work is done on the floor. Here goes:
1. Jack up front of car and secure with jackstands behind the front
wheels on the lift points.
2. Using a block of wood support the engine under the oil pan with the
hydraulic jack.
3. The engine mounts connect to the engine via the lower suspension
crossmember.  The crossmember is also connected to the steering
rack and the lower control arms.  There is enough play in the
steering coupling to allow the crossmember to be lowered slightly to
gain access to the mounts.  Do not try to remove the crossmember.
Loosen the 4 crossmember chassis mounting bolts almost to the
point that they are ready to come out, engine supported by jack.
4. Working one side at a time, completely disconnect the engine
mount from the engine/crossmember and disconnect the crossmember
from the chassis.  If there is not enough clearance to remove the
mount, especially on the driver's side, carefully raise the engine
with the jack 1/2" or so until there is room to slip the new 
engine mount in.

Get the latest style turbo mounts.

Hope this helps!

track and autocross the car, and tension the belts every Spring.  If 
you replace the belts, also replace the idler pulley on the cam belt - 
this is known to fail catastrophically; there was a service bulletin 
about it a couple years back.

The cam belt design is the weak spot of the 944 engine.  It's very 
important to keep on top of things down there, lest you buy a new 
motor...   :-]

Well, it's fall, so my AC switch decided to die. No major hurry to replace it,
but I have a few questions:

(1) How does the climate control system come out. Or does it? Is it worth
fixing myself, or should I just let the dealer do it (87 944S).

(2) Is there supposed to be a light for/in the cigarette lighter?

Now that I think about it, what's the recommended interval for changing the
timing/counterbalance belts on a 944S? I have about 35K miles on the current
one, and am beginning to feel a bit antsy...

Thanks

Interesting discussions on the timing belts. My 1988 944 now has about 52K
miles on it with the original belt. I must be living on borrowed time and
will get it changed soon. Any opinions on whether the tensioning pulleys,
etc. should be replaced at the same time.

One of the few things I have let the dealer do is to tension the belt by
the schedule in the owner's book. By the way, when I had it in the last time
for the belt tensioning at 45K miles, they told me that the recommended
replacement time for a timing belt is 60K miles.

Subject: 951 low boost 

I've just recently started paying attention to the boost gauge on my 951
and notice that I'm only getting .4 bar of boost (the gauge reads 1.4).
My mechanic says I should be getting .7 or .8 bar.  This is a stock '87
 - no aftermarket chips. 

I ran the car hard with a LED doodad stuck in a socket near the fuse box
- -- this was to catch any DME computer error codes (there were none).
Further diagnosis revealed a semi-leaky bypass valve.  Replacement made
little or no detectable difference in the amount of boost.

I've probably been living with this low boost for several months (and
several track events...). I've had a nagging feeling that the car feels
underpowered for some time, but I rarely glance at the boost gauge when
I'm standing on the gas.... Now it's really beginning to bug me. Can
anyone suggest what might be happening and what I can do about it before
I break down and leave it to my mechanic for a thorough (and $$)
diagnosis?  I recall a week or so ago, Steve Timmons (?) recommended
that someone swap out the banjo bolt for a known good one -- is that a
likely suspect?

I have seen 2 idler pully failures on 8V 944's, leading to timing belt

pully to wobble considerably.  The newer ones I've seen are plastic
instead of steel.  I'm guessing this is an improved part. (Does any-

I would definately replace this pully at 50k, or at every other timing

  My '86 951 had two problems, one was the "Cycle Calve" at 55Kmi, it was
not sufficient however to cure my problem.  It turned out the catalytic
converted had bottomed out at some point in the distant past (I couldn't
remember any incident) and had fractured the core.  With the core partially
blocked some of the internal grid had actually melted, increasing the
blockage.  Over time this may cause higher temperatures than normal because
of increased back pressure.
  FYI: At the 60K point my engine experienced an internal break (of a ring
or what I never determined) and two cylinders were badly scored and needed
to be rebored.  Mega $$$$
  A word to the wise, get it checked immediately and do not drive it.

Subject: RE: 951 low boost

Steve, in order of ease, check the following to find your low boost 
problem.  Your mechanic is right, 1.7-1.8 is normal; 1.3-1.4 is minimum 
with a wide-open wastegate. If you're sure the boost is really down, 
and your gauge is OK:

0) Next time you notice this (ONLY if it's intermittent!), turn the 
ignition off for about 2 secs.  (on a highway at a safe time, and in 
neutral gear!) and back on.  If you then get full power, you've got the 
infamous & mysterious boost shut-down problem.  I haven't heard a 
solution on this forum, but suggestions include bad gas and an 
incorrectly mounted or defective knock sensor.

1) Check the electrical connection / integrity to the cycling valve 
(brown, round, about as big as a golf ball, under intake manifold atop 
engine).  If this doesn't work, you'll get absolute minimum boost.

2) Check control pressure connections (all 3)  from cycling valve: 1 
goes thru famous banjo bolt and into black pipe behind air filter, 1 
goes back to intake system somewhere, and the last goes down to the 
wastegate.  There are a number of clamps and hoses to check.  The 
fabric-covered rubber hoses connected to the cycling valve get very 
brittle with age and may fracture, causing loss of correct control pressure.

3) Check the bypass valve for a solid seal, and a correct vacuum/boost 
control pressure (your new valve won't be effective if the control line 
to it is disconnected - during boost, it actually compresses the valve shut).

4) Look for an exhaust leak, especially the big, soft-ish gasket on the 
little elbow pipe going into the wastegate.  This may deteriorate with 
time, allowing a constant leak (symptoms are carbon traces on the 
pipe's exterior).  A new one is about 3/8" wide.

5) Wastegate maybe stuck open.

6) Turbo shot.  I knew someone who lost a vane from the compressor.  
Odd, but true!

If all that doesn't fix it, buy a Japanese car and forget about it!   ;-)

Oh yeah, good point.  I would also point out that one of the spockets in the
944S was upgraded a while back.  The original part in my car was
944.105.125.05, and it was superceded by 944.105.125.06.  The significance
of this became clear to me in looking over the damage to another 944S with
a failed belt, one which should not have failed.

As I mentioned some months ago, the sprocket in question showed a lot of wear
to its teeth, scalloping across their width.  There is also a fair sized
chunk out of one of the teeth.  (George, Frank: I promised I'd send you a
photo.  I am a dog, I have lied.  I tried framing it so that the scalloping
would show.  But even with the might Nikor Micro 55, the image really doesn't
do justice.  So I'll try to remember to bring it along to Tech Tactics this
year.)

So replace those idler pullies, and inspect sprockets for wear.  Bug your
parts guy for the latest supercessions on all related parts, and buy the
darn things.

Steve Tynor, what's this LED doo-dad of which you speak?  Can one read fault

During MY87, Porsche enhanced the 944S DME to allow reading fault codes out
of it with their tool 9268 (if memory serves).  My car was produced before
the VIN at which this was added.  What "this" was has never been clear to
me: whether the change simply involved adding more wiring and the connector
to the existing DME and harness.  Or whether the DME was also changed.  Anyone
know?

With my wife's KE-Motronic Jetta 16V, I can read fault codes out morse-code
style by jumpering these three little connectors under the shift boot.  I kid
you not - it's a feature.  Would love to do the same with the Porsche.  (With

my low boost problem at least came up with an error code.  41

potentiometer" according to sunset porsche in beaverton.

how a circuit can decide it has a bad pot is beyond me.  however,
"the factory" says that the contacts in the connector leading
to the throttle pot can become corroded, so rather than go for
the new pot (would you believe $300!?) they are going to fashion
a new connector.

Subject: RE: many small and stupid 944 questions...

Never one to be short of ideas, here's my $.03 worth (tax included):

1)  Philosophy Statement: that which was once true, may no longer be.  
Caps/rotors don't wear away as they once did.  The 944 ignition system 
is wonderful and reliable.  I'd inspect the cap annually, and change it 
when it appeared physically worn.  I replaced my first cap after >3 
years, including track time.  It was hardly worn.  Save your money!

2) It sounds as if the mirror mounting base itself is coming unglued 
from the windshield?  If that's so, a good epoxy or other glue for 
non-porous materials will work.  Crazy glue has little strength in the 
twist/torsional direction, so I wouldn't recommend it.

3) When my shift leather wore prematurely, I complained about a 
"product defect" under warranty and got a new one free.  List price @ 
dealer: $150 U.S., 4 years ago!  The new one has been fine.  Anyone 
else have info on aftermarket knobs?

4) See #1.

5) After research, I determined that the only windshield wiper 
combination that doesn't lift at high speed and fits, is a factory 
arrangement.  (The aftermarket may have fine replicas; I'm just bashing 
parts stores).  The Anco, etc. x-references are bogus. Rubber inserts 
are about $8-11 per pair for the front glass at a dealer.  Don't buy 
the $25 metal blade.  In fact, tell them you have a VW/Audi; sometimes 
the price is less, but check first (price of yellow vs. grey paint on 
the package?)!

P.S. - _never_ buy the dual-blade brackets - they are cheaply 
constructed and lift like crazy!  Their design is cosmetic, not 
functional.  The dual blade idea works on beards only!

6) There's a compound that fills nicks, etc. in glass.  I don't recall 
the name, but a glass repair shop should have it or know about it.  
You'll have to check whether it's effective on scratches.

Enjoy,

#1 What do self-maint people do about distributer caps and rotors? How often
   do you replace them? Do you "clean" them up or actually put new units in?
   I see that performance sells Bosch caps for $57.80 and Bosch rotors for
   25.50.

#2 My rear-view mirror is loose, and I would like to fix it. It appears that
   the round section that attaches to the windshield is the culprit. What
   do you guys and gals do? Crazy glue? :-)

#3 My shift knob is shot, and the leather has worn off/torn away. Are the
   shift knobs sold by Performance Ok? Leather is $49, mahogany is $54...

#4 Basically same as #1, except for spark plug wires. Are there "performance"
   wires that I should look at, or again, are the wires sold in the
   Performance catalog Ok? Fyrebraid wires for 944 are $189, "Heavy Duty"
   wires are $168.50.

#5 Here's another stupid one: What do people like in Wind Shield wipers?
   (wipers that work eh?) I seem to have bad luck with the wipers I have
   been buying at the local autoparts store... They look great for about
   a month, but after that, they streak, and one set put a nice 1/2" wide
   glass scratch right at driver's eye level.

#6 Related to #5: I have this nice curved scratch in my wind shield that
   I would like to get rid of. It isn't deep, it looks almost like a frosted
   beer mug (kinda)... You probably need more info, but in general, what
   should I do? Take it to a windshield repair place?

Stats: 1984 944 with 92k miles, but it does have a new paint job and new
suspension parts (shocks, springs, bars, etc)...

Thanks for listening to these admittedly silly and small-time questions!

Not sure about the 944S, but the 951 (all years) has the capability to read
out fault codes with an LED Doo-Dad connected to the diagnostic socket (the
same socket that can be jumpered to allow "open-loop" mixture adjustments).

There are two booklets that describe this for the 951:
        WKD-491-321     1985 944 Turbo Service Information
        WKD-453-920     1985 944 Turbo DME/KLR Service Info.

The first one is about 80 pages and costs $1.22. The second is about 40
pages and costs $5.94. Yes those prices are correct! They explain the car
and fuel injection systems very well, with great pictures. I can look up
the equivalent #'s for the 944S - there must be something similar.

Hope this helps,

You may have a stuck / non-functioning mixer flap.  If your system is 
roughly like the 85/2 944 series, there are vacuum or motor-controlled 
flaps to mix air flows.  They should be located in the center console, 
within the dashboard.

You might also check the "sniffer"; the little slotted air inlet on 
your dashboard where the HVAC system sucks wind from the cockpit.  This 
is the feedback element for the thermostat.  If it, or the temperature 
sensor at its terminus, is flaky, you'll have a bad feedback loop that 
could make the system pin itself hot or cold.

Whether or not your power is correct, the gauge should still be 1.0 at 
rest.  Perhaps a general KLR problem is causing both gauge and boost 
pressure to be wrong.

Sound like your gauge, pressure sensor (inside KLR box), or supporing 
electronics is bad.  You should see almost exactly 1.0 with a stopped 
engine, depending on whether a storm is approaching.

Neither part is easy to find.  You'll have to go to VDO for the 
dashboard or Bosch for the KLR box, or find a used part.

Test the dashboard gauge first - stick a voltmeter across it and check 
it vs. the factory manual or another car for nominal readings.

Concerning the boost gauge itself: At ambient pressure (key on, but
engine not running), it reads only 0.8 bar, not 1.0 as I'd expect.  Does
that make the max boost reading of 1.4 actually 1.6?

I spent an hour this morning with my mechanic checking the low boost
problem, and according to the DME (KLR?) breakout box, my throttle
switch was bad (was supposed to reak 1 - 9k ohms, we were getting 4.7
ohms). So we replaced it. No change (still reads 4.7 ohms).  Back to the
original switch.

We pinched close the vacuum connection to the cycle valve and, voila, we
had better boost (1.6-1.7 or so).  My mechanic wants to replace the
cycle valve. Has anyone ever done this without taking off the intake
manifold? If so, I may do the replacement myself.  It looks pretty
tricky, but my mechanic said it might be doable.

REGARDING                the value of 914 stuff
Hey, there, fellow PorschePhiles!

I have a couple of questions for you 914-heads out there.
I have a '74 914 1.8, with all of the "usual" problems.  The engine is old, and
(at least) the top end needs a re-build soon.  First and Second gear synchros
are ... mostly? gone.  The interior is in pretty good shape, except for the
driver's side floormat.  The exterior doesn't look TOO bad.... Of course, the
last person to have it painted took it to Earl Schieb or someone of equally
dubious quality, since most of the last coat washed off during the first few
months.  Some large-ish paint scrapes/scratches, some Bondo "ripples" visible
if you catch the light right, and a big discolored spot on the rear deck lid.
On the plus side, it has been lowered (fairly competently, no bump steer
problem), the fuel pump has been moved to the front, and it has "fake Fuchs"
alloys on it.

Any rough ideas on what it's worth?  $500?  Less?  More?

On a slightly different tack:  What would a set of the real Fuchs 4-bolts be
worth?

Thanks in advance!

Ah, good, now we're getting somewhere!  Let me help you continue with 
this on-line diagnosis, Steve, while others watch!

The throttle pot. resistance must be measured out of circuit - is that 
how you did it?  The best way to test pots. is throw a 'scope and a 
little voltage on it, and operate it manully.  This will not only tell 
you resistance (indirectly), but will show you if the pot. has any 
drop-outs (burned spots, dirt,...) or excessive noise.  You should 
simply get a nice, smooth line that moves in proportion to the throttle 
position.

On to the meat.  It now looks like your wastegate and turbo are OK, 
since you confirmed full boost via the pinch job.  Yes, you can remove 
the valve without yanking the manifold - I've done it twice.  It takes 
patience and some small tools and deft fingers, but it's simple.  The 
most difficult part is getting one of the screws (top one, I think) 
out.  You can bend the mounting plate up slightly to help here.

One last test before you yank the valve, though.  Run jumpers from it 
directly to the battery (polarity unimportant).  It'll "click" shut.  
Go drive around and check the boost.  If it's OK (in fact, kindof wild 
 - 1.8 bar!), then the valve is probably *not* the problem.  But if your 
boost is back to it's normal lack-luster self, then replace the valve.

BTW - to check/replace the vacuum hose going to the valve, you *will* 
have to remove the manifold.  I jostled my vacuum lines 3 weeks ago, 
during a head-removal job, and they promptly snapped from being 
brittle, as if they were cooled to 50 degrees K.  That could be a 
source of control pressure leakage that gives the appearance of a bad 
cycling valve.

With the cycling valve wired to the battery like this, it never opens 
the wastegate, so you'll have tremendous power, and no over-boost 
protection.  That's OK for your short testing period, but never track 
the car that way or you'll buy a head gasket!

Good luck!

REGARDING                914 value
Sorry for the ommision...

It has been pointed out to me that RUST is a critical factor in the value of a
914.  Well, this one at one point had some under the battery, but it was
(evidently) brushed/scraped/polished off, and then liberally sprayed with
undercoating.  Some of the engine sheet metal has some surface rust--nothing
major, just a bit of discoloration. 
There's more undercoating in the rear trunk, so I assume that there was some
rust in there as well.  No new rust or water back there in the year and a half
I've owned it.
The rocker panels have some at the bottom, where I misjudged the correct angle
out of a driveway and scraped some paint off.
There is also a tiny bit of flex with about 250 pounds in the seat and the roof
off.  The drivers side window will stick at the top.  Not badly, but enough to
notice.
Apart from that, I can't find any.  However, who really knows what's under the
undercoating on the bottom of the car and by the jack points?

I dunno, is it just a rolling junker, or is it worth salvaging?

Can't wait to try this.  If this is OK, then I suppose I have bad wiring

pamphlets mentioned on the list sufficient wihout the shop manuals?) All
I have is Haynes and though it claims to cover turbos, it really
doesn't.  The more I think about it (and spend $$ at my mechanic's), the
less outrageous the ~$150 for the shop manuals seems...

Subject: Looking for Rear Axle Bearing Pulley for 356C

Hey,
Great list, but to bad there's not more about our beloved 356's ;^).

Anyway, I'm looking for the Pulley that takes off the rear axle bearing.
It's the same as the one used for VW's.  If anybody knows where I could get
one, CHEAP, please let me know.  Thanks, and keep the 356 faith

Ummmm. I should also point out that what I think you can sell a car for
and what I think you should buy one for are VASTLY different prices. But
I assume you gathered that from the context of how I buy and sell parts and
cars....

I'd expect the car to be worth at least $1500, maybe more. I'm selling
(if the guy shows up like he's supposed to) my '74 1.8 in similar condition
for $3000. But then, the buyer wants this particular car, it's all original,
etc. But it needs an engine rebuild, synchros, the paint is not great, and
there is some rust. I know for sure I can move this car for $2000, as I've
had that offered before. So it all depends....

The real Fuchs should be worth $400 to $800 a set, depending on just how
great a shape they're in. I've been able to assemble full sets for less 
than that by finding multiple sets which have more than one bad wheel, and
pressing the price down since "well, they're worth as much if they all aren't
usable".
