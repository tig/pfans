Subject: Re: Loctite for Rod Bolts

Dear Steve:

         Put me in the Loctite Camp- I ALWAYS use RED Loctite on 356/912 Rod
Nuts and have NEVER had a rod nut come loose (knock on wood).  Tell me, did
the rod cap fail, or did the rod break at the root of the stud or did it pop
the other nut off the other side?
    I wrote a Story  once about a not-so-good Shop in NY that had the same
problem with a '69 912- he sent in a cigar box filled with broken bits of
Rod, Case Cam, etc and asked what happened. Thanks to our experience in
Porsche Pathology,  we were able to tell that the rod nuts came loose. It was
REALLY a disaster. too.Ironically, the engine failed as the MECHANIC who
built it was driving it- the Customer had complained about "roughness" so the
mechanic took it out, spun it to 6 grand whereupon it blew up in spectacular
fashion. Mechanic had to walk back through that lonesome valley. Turned out
another friend had been present when the mechanic assembled the engine- and
noticed that the rod nuts had not been tightened. Turned out too, that the
Rods were 356B ".00" rods rather than the ".01" 912 rods. No wonder the
engine was mad at him!

   KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!!

Symptomatic of someone using the wrong bolts... Factory used allen screws
of a slightly less than normal height. That way the rails cleared the screw
side-to-side and overhead. Using "normal" hex head bolts can result in 
trouble on the side-to-side clearances causing the end of the rail to not 
go forward past the bolt. Ran into this the first time I popped the seats
out of my 911SC.

It's also possible that your seat rails are shot and just won't go forward
enough.

OK, on timing 914s it's *DAMNED* important to understand what you're
timing and why.... 

On 1.7s, ummm, I don't know, I scavenge 1.7s for EProd race cases....

On 1.8s, there is a single vacuum advance. You can set the timing with
the hoses off at idle speed and still be right. I usually use 15 BTDC.

On 2.0s, there is a vacuum advance (5 degrees) *AND* a vacuum retard (also
5 degrees). So on a 2.0, you set the timing for 10 BTDC with all
the hoses hooked up. That way, you have another 5 degrees when the 
vacuum retard cuts off, and another 5 when the advance cuts in, for
a total of 20 BTDC.

Bottom line: use the recommended procedures in the owners manual or the
factory service manual. Ignore Chiltons. Haynes is OK if you get the
right set of instructions...

Subject: rev limiter


Stefan,

When I bought my car the rev limiter got in at 5700 rpm instead
of 6300 rpm. It appeared that when the car had been serviced
they had installed the wrong rotor (in the distributor).

The rotor has a weight which casues a short circuit when the 
centrifugal force gets higher than the spring force. The
6300 rpm has therefore a significant tolerance.

Why do you start the engine with the key when going 65mph?
Release the clutch at a high gear and the engine will start
up again.

The problem with the engine dying at shift changing is not
likely to do with the rev limiter. Probably a tuning of the
K-jetronic will help (it did for me when I had this problem as well).

Just informing you guys about a little sound file I found.

Are you tired of your PC beeping everytime you turn it off or on or do 
something illegal?
Here is the cure, 10.8 second of cranking, starting, revving, and tarmac 
burning Porsche 911......, tell me if you want it, it's about 86KB, so I 
will not post it to the group......!Is it okay to put this file in the

I mean eyes and ears are only sensors, it's in the brain it is happening!

I also have a video file of a 911 somewhere, it's *.mpg or maybe *.avi I think.
If you want it,(and it disn't get axed last timethe Sys.Ad. forced me to Axe 
off some 150Mb's) send a note.....

You'd might need the speaker.drv if you haven't got a sound card,...there is 
one available for you.

Think of it, starting up your PC being welcomed by the sound of a 911.....!

With the speaker.drv installed you're able to set a lot of sounds to 
different 'events' happening in your windows enviroment......! Great fun...!

I will try to make some video's during summer and I think perhaps someone on 
the net could be interested......*very* PORSCHE related videos that is.

If any other porschephiler(s) feel like taking a dive into the multimedia 
world, give me a note as we could explore this territory, with our interest 
in cars etc as a trigger to understanding and learning this new great(?) 
world.....

I'm pretty fresh to multimedia, and would be glad to interchange experiences.
Basically what you need to play is a PC-386 or better, I guess any UNIX 
platform should handle this, for the PC's a video card with 1MB or more, 
preferably a sound card (not necessary), and there is freeware or shareware

Subject: 914 trouble

Porschephiles,
The day after I send the e-mail message asking for another 914 (Wanted:
Perfect 914), my car starting acting up (as if hurt by my lack of loyalty).
The engine just cuts out completely once or twice a day, as if the ignition
was turned off. Sometime its for a tenth of a second, sometimes for several
seconds, in which case the engine stalls, but restarts immediately. I
suspect a loose connection in the ignition system, or an intermittant short
to ground. Aside from the ordinary components that could make the engine
cut out (coil, high-voltage wires, ignition switch) what are the more
esoteric ones, associated with the fuel injection?
I just had my engine taken out and replaced for a new clutch. Is there a
wire that commonly gets pinched, and where is it?
What do you think? Thanks, Michael

I appreciate your input Stan.  100 psi ? wow.  It was my impression
from reading the Haynes (havn't got the real books yet) that the
fuel pump was at the rear.  The Haynes says that the pressure s/b
tested with a gauge that reads up to 40psi downstream of the pump.
I thought that the fuel was sucked from the tank to the rear by
this pump.  Is there another pump in the tank ?  If not, how
do they get 100psi between the tank and the rear of the car ?  I'd
have thought that (without a boost pump in the tank) the pressure
would be a lot lower (and actually negative).  My other option
(short of dropping the engine to replace the whole thing) is to
cut out the offending piece and use some tools and fittings from
my aircraft tool box - flare fittings and a flaring tool - and
fit in a new piece of metal fuel line.

Hi, Trond.
 
I think you told us once what the T5 gas tank floor costs over there, and
what it costs over here. Did I remember correctly, $200 U.S. price? What is
the price over there?
 
How do you in Norway get the repair panels from Denmark? Will he send
them to you directly, or do you have a local dealer? Is duty a problem for
you?
 
The problem here is, we all like the panels, but don't like Zim's prices.
I'd like to find a way around that, maybe have them ordered by a friend in
Germany and then I pick them up next business trip.
 
How authentic is the stamping for the T5 gas tank floor in the area where
the wiring harness goes up to the fusebox? I think this is the area that is
most difficult to stamp. Is the repro sheet metal the same thickness as
original, or thicker as are some of the cheaper U.S. repro panels?

Len:
   
The term "investment interest" means any interest allowable as a deduction
which is paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to property held
for investment. "Property held for investment" is (a) property which produces
portfolio income under the passive loss rule (b) any interest in an activity
involving a trade or business in which the taxpayer does not materially
participate, if that activity is not treated as passive under the passive
loss rule.

This mumbo jumbo means that you can only deduct interest expense on money
borrowed to buy things like stocks, bonds, blah, blah, blah. If you can
figure out a way to make your Porsche produce "portfolio income" you may have
a case for treating it as "property held for investment." 

BTW, if you do figure out a way to make your Porsche produce portfolio
income, be sure to let me know 8-). I do believe a few court cases have

Here's an interesting one.  When I started the 914 this morning, the
engine fired up nicely (FI is wonderful), but the starter just kept on
cranking.  So I killed the engine.  No effect, the start still kept
cranking.  Apparently the switch was stuck in the start position,
because when I worked the key from off to ignition to start and back
to ignition, the starter stopped cranking, as expected.  When I
started the car up again, the starter behaved normally.  I love a car

Has anyone seen this problem?  Will spraying electrical contact
cleaner/lubricant into the switch help prevent this from reoccurring?
How painful is it to remove the switch for repairs?

I was going to leave this alone, but I thought that Locktite was
useless in high heat applications. Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but
300 degrees F seems to come to mind. I guess the bright side is that
it couldn't hurt anything and it _could_ help. I tried to call
Locktite to find out what the release temp was, but they don't have
an 800 number listed.

I've never used Locktite on rod bolts, and never had one come apart,
but I would think that one that did was probably not prepped properly.
An out of round, or unbalanced, big end will probably come apart no
matter what you do.

There are two problems that I've found about being a Porshe owner:

1) When people leave my car, they close the door with the force needed to
shut an *American* car, which practically shatters the windows of a
Porsche.

2) Non-Porsche owners think I'm blowing my money away on my car, when in
fact, my 944 has been relatively inexpensive to own and maintain.  Against
my better judgement, I've had to justify my ownership of the car by telling
a few non-Porsche owners what I spent for the car and what I spend for
maintenence.  The mystique of being a Porsche owner is great, but I get

I think Ted picked a bad example, here.  I'd go with the 993 as well.
But in all fairness, the point remains.  You can buy a cheap, Japanese
"popout" (an old surfing term for a cheap, mass produced board) that
will compete very favorably against some expensive German machinery.
Look at the new Supra and RX7.

Okay...so how many of us would kill for one of these Japanese popouts?
Not me.  If I just want "fun, "cheap" transportation", maybe.  I owned
two CRX's for just that reason.  But if I want a car with engineering
craftsmanship, polish, heritage, something that will be around for a
while and remembered for many years, I buy a Porsche, or M-B, or BMW.

Oh, oh.  We've just been through this extensively.  It's best summarized
by saying the early 911S (67-73) had between 160 and 190 bhp (DIN),
and weighed about 300lbs less than an SC.  So you can guess that these
were/are very fun, nimble cars to drive.  They are also over 20 years old,
have quirky fuel systems, often ugly smog control solutions,
non-galvanized bodies with a well deserved reputation for rust, small
rubber footprints due to limited wheel well space (and an inclination to
want to run through tight curves rear-end first), and smaller, "peaky"
engines that required high engine speed for performance.

The early cars are "purer" in the classical sense.  The sweat you feel is
as much from the excitement of driving one as it is from the poor
ventilation and lack of creature comforts.  Oh yes...and most of us want
one very badly.

It's an '82 911 SC.  Don't think that'd qualify as 'early' on a car
with a production run as long as the 911.  It's a CIS system.

Actually it appears to me that I have a rubber hose protruding from the
tunnel (maybe it's just rubber coated) which mates to a metal (brass ?)
line which loops over the tranny.  Mating appears to be a flare fitting
type of join.  I was planning on letting the 5 or so gals I have in

I use the 'real' Porsche part or not.

	"Really ?  why is this.  Whats so special about the '70's S, or

Not only did they make more SCs, but SCs don't rust away. Also SCs have
more modern, easily maintained components (computerized F.I. for
instance) so they are less likely to have been irreversibly modified or
otherwise altered. 

Value is determined in part by supply and demand. For some reason 911s
are considered desireable, and an unhacked, relatively straight,
original pre-74 911 is more difficult to find than a decent SC. Because
of their greater number and relative youth, one would predict SCs will
not be collectible for quite some time to come.

Of course, in many ways SCs are far superior to early 911s. They will
always be in demand... it's just that the supply of good examples is
relatively large and their is no reson to believe the supply will
significntly decrease over the next decade. (Most 911 ownwers take good
care of their car.) I enjoy the diversity of this list where we have
made different subjective choices in what we enjoy driving while at the
same time are unfied by our appreciation of the Porsche marque.

     have professionals do the work.
  - The money is to be spent on power to the wheels only, not braking
     or handling (obviously neither of these should be impaired).
  - You want future maintenance not complicated by any mods (i.e.,
     you should be able to get it serviced at any Porsche shop).
  - Reliability is very important to you.
  - It must pass any emissions test and be street legal (this is

  - You would like to be able to return it to stock, if necessary (at
     some additional cost, of course).

Well, I have a 1986 Audi 4000CQ quattro as well as the 928, and the
Audi is a lot more expensive to keep running than the Porsche. And
the 928 has twice as many miles on it.

Oh come on! Everyone who watches American Journal knows
what a dangerous car the NSX is .. I mean the 120 tread
wear tires wear out quick! At any moment, an unsuspecting
NSX driver can find himself (OK girls..or HERself) out

Given drivers of equal skill, what is it about the 993
that would give its driver an advantage over the NSX
driver? Or vice versa? I think it's a moot point.

Subject: 911 Battery Boxes

Here in the mid-west summer's heat and humididty has kicked in with a
vengence. The 911 (1971 E coupe) sits in the garage at temperatures of
about 100 -110 F. I must install some ventilation to cool things off
a bit. These are prime condistions for the evil R word... rust.

We all know one of the most vulnerable areas for corrosion on early
911s are the battery boxes.  Last weekend I decided to check these out
very carefully for the first time (I received the car in March and it
wqs being mechanically restored during April and May). The appraiser
who performed the prepurchase inspection reported the battery box area
was in amazingly good condition. It turns out he was correct. NO
corrosion of the battery boxes was noted. However the positive
terminals had quite a bit of white powder (lead sulfate) present.
Several cells were pretty low on both batteries.

After removal of the batteries the terminal corrosion was cleaned and
the outside and bottom of the batteries was washed and rinsed several
times. The batteries were filled with distilled water and dried. Next
plastic (dry cleaning bags) was spread out around the battery box
area.  The terminals and bolts were carefully cleaned of all corrosion
until fresh (shinny) lead could be seen. The battery box areas were
then vaccumed. The boxes and area around the boxes was washed with a
very damp cloth. This was repeated several times in order to dilute out
any acid or salts. Rinsing with a basic solution could be counter
productive as the process produces salts which could be corrosive as
well. The entire area was then carefully dried. 

Then WD-40 was liberally sprayed throughout the battery box area. The
terminals were coated with lithium grease... the battery posts got the
same treatment. The batteries were replaced and reconnected. The ground
strap chassis connectors were filed to shinny metal and carefully
tightened.  The entire area was resprayed with WD-40.

When these batteries die (any day now they've been attended to :>) ),
I'll replace them with sealed units.  Hopefully I'm on the way to
keeping this area rust free for another 23 years!

We all pay attention to waxing during the summer months. This is a
friendly reminder to attack the battery boxes as well to help keep our
old Porsches intact.

Well la dee da.  Can't stand it down here on the low end of the P-car 
evolutionary ladder with the rest of us glycol pumping bottom crawlers, eh 
Steve :).  

Anyways .. . .

Regarding the non P-car publics attitude about Porsches.  Growing up, my 
father would often take great delight in describing the trials and 
tribulations of his fellow physicians who owned Porsches. It got worse
as the years progressed and I'm surprised it didn't warp my young mind. So, 
needless to say, when I pulled up one sunny Sunday morning with a 944S2 back 
in '89 he gave me that look -- you know, the *look*.

He really didn't want to talk about my Porsche over breakfast and this was
mildly disappointing since, well, I felt kind of pumped about finally owning
the car I had dreamed about since '83. How could I possibly convince him I'd
made a good decision when he was so entrenched in his poor opinion of the
marque?  Well, it seemed like a damn good time for dad to have his first
Porsche Driving Experience.  So, I suggested a test drive, even though I was 
a bit nervous about it since the last time he'd driven a stick was something 
like '55 when he was doing time for Uncle Sam in Germany.

We went outside and after a brief inspection of the car he got himself seated 
while making quite a show of it.  My God, no bench seat, no tilt steering wheel,
its like sitting in a bathtub! I kept my mouth shut and, after a few false 
starts and missed clutches, we were off.  Nothing spectacular really occurred 
as he negotiated his way about our quiet little neighborhood. I seem to remember
some complaint about the "feel" of the clutch. Things were not going well.

Then, up ahead, a long sweeping freeway on-ramp came into view and *it* 
happened.  Dad, pressed down on the accelerator so that the RPMs got to where 
that extra set of valves could work their magic. We were pressed back in our 
seats as he let his foot press the pedal to the floor. The turn unfolded before 
him as the car sped onward, hunkering down, guiding along. Somewhere around 3rd
gear and 5500 RPMs he turned to me with one of the biggest grins I'd ever
seen on his face. Then, in an ever so slighty excited voice, he simply said 
"This car can really move, can't it?". At that moment you could have gotten a
100 Watt light bulb to burn bright by sticking it in my ear I was so charged.

That night I was wrenching around with something on the car and he came out and
just sort of looked at the car for a while.  Then he opened the door and sat 
down.  Didn't say anything, didn't complain about the seat or the steering 
wheel, just sat there looking, running his hands across the interior,
turning knobs, looking out through the mirrors. It was quite a nice moment when
I think back on it, really nice.

Damn, I'm tearing up, how embarrassing!!  Gotta go . . .

Keep the 944 Faith my brethern!!

Subject: Re:  What would YOU do?

Lance,

Changing exhaust and muffler will buy you horsepower but will prevent
you from passing visual/smog inspection. DME chips will get you some
throttle response. A Mass-Flow system will get you a few HP and
better throttle response for way to much money.

It is not very easy to do anything to a 3.2 liter to get a lot of
extra performance. Especially if you want to pass smog.

I would say you have only one choice based on the criteria you
have presented: Change the ring and pinion in your transmission.
Since your 911 has G50 transmission, you are looking at
more money than if you had a 915 tranny. The good news is that
changing the ring and pinion in your G50 is not going to reduce
the "bulletproofness" of the G50.

The R&P you currently have is either an 9:30 or 9:31. The way to
go is to change it to an 8:32. This will give you what feels like
30 to 50 more horsepower. Parts and labor to install a R&P in a
G50 will cost between $2700 and $3000. This is assuming nothing
else needs to be done while the tranny is open.

If you want the name of a guy that does incredible tranny work,
let me know.

Got the Performance Products and Automotion catalogues.  Am I missing 
something (probably) or is the Bursch Performance Exhaust *REALLY*  $450 
LESS than the "original factory mufflers"?  Higher dyno and 1/3 the 
price?  Sign me up!

On another topic. . . took apart my console to get at the a/c switch and 
wiring.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  One prong appears to have burned off 
the back of the switch, perhaps because wires corroded, melting two wires 
together.  Other three wires and contacts look ok.  How do I make sure I 
have the right gauge wire if I choose to splice in a section to replace 
the corroded/melted part of the two wires?  Is this "meltdown" at the 
switch common or should I be looking for another problem before I replace 
the switch and splice the wires?

On yet another topic . . . (last one, I promise, so you can move on to 
Ted's latest excellent adventure :-) (no flames intended).  Automotion 
has the Passport 4500 SuperWide by Escort advertised at $269.95.  Two Q's:
1.  Is this the detector of choice (or at least a good one)?
2.  Is there a better price out there? 

Thanks again for your help.  We now return you to your regularly

I think in the case of the 911, and other Porsches for that matter, the car
is more than the sum of its parts.  Other cars may have faster acceleration,
better handling, lower Cd, better braking (probably not, now that the 993 has
ABS-5), and a higher top speed, but none of them can really put them into a
*fun* package like the 911 series does.  Sure, I would love a Ferrari or an
NSX, but I still think that the Porsche is a better overall car.  Sure it can
be buried by an F40 in a straight line, but on rough, twisty-turny roads with
occasional straights, the Porsche would be the better, faster, and probably
*safer* car.

Sounds like your trigger points in your distributor.  I'm assuming that this
is a D-Jetronic rather than L-Jetronic engine, although I think the L-Jet 
had trigger points as well.  The reason that I believe this, is that I had 
the same problem with my VW Type III (which runs on D-Jet).  It turns out that
you should replace the trigger points (located on the bottom of the distributor)
every 100,000 miles, and mine had over 300,000 miles on them!  This will cause
engine cut out, as the trigger points tell the injectors when to spray, and if 
the points are defective or worn out, the injectors won't cycle.

No problem, I'll just insert it here <g>...

Tonight, I installed my door handle $8.75 kit which I picked up at the 
Automotion swap.  The idea is great, you replace the original broken know 
by drilling out the riveted plastic window knob, and attach a new knob 
with a bushing in it, and self threading screw.

The problem is that it takes a lot of drilling and pressure to get the 
old one out, and a lot of torque to get the new one in place.  I do think 
it's worth having to buy a new crank for $30 or so, just to fix the 
plastic spinner knob, but is much more work than it looks like.

Don't know if it's the best one or not, I've read (here) that it is 
better than the Valentine, and have also read (here) that it is not as 
good as the Valentine.

I believe the price directly from Escort is $229, with recent prices of 
$199, so I do think there are better prices out there.

Subject: 924S/944 Vibration with Sunroof Removed

I have been having some fun with the sunroof off. Well, part of 
this is to avoid the vent smell which hasnt gone away....and won't
go away until I finish my thesis/start new job. (No, the lysol didnt
seem to work very well)

Anyway, I usually drive with the windows down as well as the sunroof
off. However I was trying to hear something on the radio and rolled 
up the windows. When the windows are completely up, a strong vibration
occurs from the turbulence at the sunroof opening. The turbulence is 
very strong and shakes the car quite hard.  THis is at 60-70 mph. 
I dont think it is noticeable at 20-30. 

I'm not sure what, exactly , was vibrating, but it gave me the sensation
that the whole car was vibrating. It is duplicable (hooray! it wasnt the
engine ). Getting the windows all the way up is important in getting the
full effect. Put the windows down, at same speed, and it goes away very
quickly.

Unfortunately, the other cars on the freeway also demanded some attention,
or I could be more complete in my descriptions.....

The flap that connects the sunroof to the body was placed in the horizontal
position. While this could certainly vibrate and make noise, it would not
shake the whole car. 

Anyway, I'm not so concerned with "fixing" this as I suppose its just a 
small design bug. I am curious if other people have noticed it too .

Subject: 993 vs. NSX


Really now folks, do we have to resort to accusations of "short tire 
life" and "dangerous" in order to explain the superiority of the 993?  
Did Porsche make the tires on the 993?  Or Acura those on the NSX?  And I 
have to think that Honda/Acura does have something of a legacy, 
considering their DOMINATION in Formula cars.  But that's not the point.  
The tires on the NSX are made to STICK.  So they're soft.  And the owners 
who drive them bald, then slide off the road in the next rainstorm, are 
stupid, and don't deserve such a car, much less a 993!  They should have 
chosen a BMW, or a diferent Acura, like a Legend.  We all know that most 
of us hear would rather own the 993 than some stupid "Honda".  But 
shouldn't that be obvious, this list isn't called "Acura-philes" is it?
The NSX is a terrific car.  And it ain't no Porsche, that's for DAMN SURE!
But it certainly doesn't deserve this silly bashing.

My 3 cents, that's all.

Howevah....

In most cars (read: Detroit Iron and your father's Oldsmobile) the
power to the starter doesn't go directly through the ignition switch.
The high currents would cook it! Instead the switch controls a bigger
switch (solenoid) which sends current to the starter.

There is a reasonable chance that the solenoid (a big mama relay) 
stuck in the "start" position and only released after you played with the 
switch a few times. The switch may be at fault.. but replacing the 
solenoid might be easier/cheaper. You might check it out.

I hope we are not all losing perspective here.  We all buy cars that satisfy 
our personal tastes; that doesn't make one better or worse than any 
other.  We happen to enjoy Porsches, which, if you are like me, has been 
an irrational desire since I was a kid.  I don't really care if its 
lighter, nimbler, quicker, faster, prettier, or more macho than any other 
car.  What I care about is it's the car I always wanted.  Period.  For 
others that might be the NSX or the 300ZX or whatever.  So be it.  (Think 
how expensive our P-cars would be if EVERYONE wanted them!  Supply and 
demand . . . <g>)

In fact, not totally unrelated to this but also related to the discussion 
of Porsche-envy or resentment . . . when I pull up to a red light, almost 
everyone who pulls up beside me has the urge to rev their engine and get 
off the line ahead of me.  Last night it was a beat up Honda Civic (not 
the CRX), a pickup and a carload of kids in an Oldsmobile.  I get no 
little pleasure in watching them jack rabbit off the line as I slowly 
slip into first and moderately apply the gas.  They are truly 
disappointed (and ruins their night) because I have so obviously refused 
to meet their challenge!<g>  What it comes down to is this . . . I'm 
confident and comfortable with what my P-car can do and I don't feel 
threatened into having to prove it at every light.  In a way, each of my 
"challengers" is complimenting my car by feeling the need to prove theirs 
"better" in this mini-drag race.  So chill out.  Enjoy your P-car knowing 
that its the car YOU love and the car many others would like to have.  
And be secure enough in that to ignore such petty competitiveness as my 
stop light friends seem to always want to engage in.

(Jim Bauman points out that the Mitsubishi 3000 has roots going right back
to the Zero).
 
Now that I think of it, years ago when they introduced the car, the press
introduction was on the Big Island of Hawaii. Nobody drew the obvious
connection. I suggested to the magazine for which I was doing the story that
they should photograph the press car alongside the only flying Zero in the
world, at Chino Airport. But they didn't "get it."
 
A friend of mine teaches Japan Air Lines pilots how to fly. There's a story
about a JAL 747 pilot who was about to retire, so they let him fly anywhere
he wanted for his last trip. He chose Honolulu. Once he got the plane on the
ground, he switched to that frequency and got all confused by the taxiways.
The ground controller was getting a little frustrated. The JAL captain got
on the radio and said something like "Excuse please. Last time I was here,
we were far too busy to land."

You may be missing something. On the DME cars, changing the exhaust components
screws up what the engine map is expecting, and can result in some unpleasant
and unexpected results over time. Yet, changing exhaust *CAN* give you s
so much more additional power that it's a very common thing to do. For CIS
and MFI and carb'd cars, it's a huge win.

BTW, Bursch goes way back to the dawn of Porsche racing. Their 356 exhaust
systems are literally as good as it gets. The only other product of
theirs I have used is the exhaust for a 914 1.8 which seems to still be
doing the job on the car now under new ownership... (Hi Tad)

No, but it can *make* the car shake...

Buried in the owner's manual for the 944 (in the section on removing
and installing the sunroof) is a passing reference to the "wind 
deflector." They never actually say, "Hi, 944 owners: If you change 
the angle of that little flap, you'll deflect the wind so the car 
won't vibrate." But in fact that's what they mean by subtlely referring 
to a wind deflector. 

It worked for me; give it a try.

I often have the opposite effect, in fact, yesterday, when a targa sc

The tires on an NSX are Yoko A022 and the chassis has way to much
negative camber for a street car. This is why the tires wear our so
fast.

So, Jerry. My comments are not derived from NSX-envy or Porsche-envy

Subject: 356 Brakes

Today was exciting enough that I would like to avoid another occurrence.
In small city traffic my brakes completely went as the cars in front
of me stopped for a red light.  I swerved across the road and came to
a stop alongside the line of cars .. right at the light.  The emergency
brake was a little weak.  Glad there was no traffic coming at me!

The problem was simple .. a front brake line that split in a big way.
It will be easy to fix, but it is time to think about modern fault
tolerant master cylinders.  Is there a later model (dual) brake
cylinder which will fit a 62 356B Coupe?  If I'd had one, I would
have lost only half my brakes.

The afternoon by the roadside ended with my kid bringing me the
critical tools to adjust the emergency brake and then a long drive
home with only that.

Subject: 944->944 Turbo front spoiler

Have any fellow 944 owners updated their front bumper/valence to the Turbo
look with one of those 3rd party pieces?  The '87 944S I just bought has a
cracked one (beyond repair, I believe), and I'm considering buying one with
the new look.  

Automotion has exactly what I'm looking for, at $580, and although they are
a quality parts store, their prices are hardly competitive with suppliers. 
Can anyone share their experiences on making this change and suggest a
vendor? (Bay Area preferred). Thanks.

Subject: Urgent - Sacramento Mechanic!

Help!  I have been caught in Sacramento with mechanical problems.  I was on the
way back from San Francisco to Vancouver when I discovered that my 1983 944 had
a coolant leak.  The leak appears to be on the passenger side near the front of
the car, although it is hard to be certain because the engine compartment is so
cramped that it is hard to see things.

Of course, I was supposed to be back at work in Vancouver on Monday.  However, I
don't think it would be wise to try to limp back the 930 miles from Sacramento
(where I am now) to Vancouver, just in case things get worse.  This leaves me
with a real dilemma:

1. I need a recommendation as to where in Sacramento to bring the car.  (Thank
heaven I didn't get stuck in that huge dead zone of non-Porsches between
Sacramento and Portland!)  Given the U.S./Canadian exchange rate, I do not
relish paying large sums for repairs, but if I have to, I guess I don't have a
choice.  Can anyone recommend a good mechanic?

2. Right now it is Saturday night.  The sooner I can see a mechanic, the better,
since I am already late getting back to Vancouver and don't want to be even
later.  The problem of course is that tomorrow is Sunday and the day after that
is the 4th of July.  I would prefer not to have to wait until Tuesday before I
can even get a mechanic to lift the hood.  Does anyone know of a mechanic who
might be prepared to help me out on Sunday and/or Monday?

3. What is likely my problem?  I am guessing that a fitting has come loose or
that a hose has developed a leak.  What will be involved in diagnosing the
problem?  What should I expect this to cost?

Thanks in advance for all of your help.  I am receiving Porschephiles in the
digest form, so I would be eternally grateful if any responses could be copied
to me directly.  I want to start trying to find someone -- anyone -- to look at
my car first thing in the morning.  My e-mail address is:

70363.1332@compuserve.com

The telephone number of the place where I am staying is (916)441-5296.  Please
feel free to call me if you live in the area and you find it easier than using
e-mail.  (This is my cousin's place.)  Once again, thanks.

Funny you should ask that... This month's Pano has a tech letter on that 
subject. Claim is that you need to use a VW Super Beetle master cylinder
for the drum brake cars, plus pile of banjo fittings and some new line.
I'd recommend seeing if you can scare up a June Pano, and see page 79.

Duanne Spencer also covers this in his "The 356 Performance Handbook",
if you can score a copy of that. He does however suggest the 911 
master cylinder, which is not recommended for drum brake cars in the
Pano note from David Seeland (PCA 356 tech chairman) due to needing
a check valve and the Super Beetle part being loads cheaper.

I had a similar experience with my '59 Beetle, so when I got my '60 356B,
I changed to a dual master cylinder. The master cylinder was from an early
'70's Super Beetle, which bolted right on, and I used a reservoir from a
similar vintage Beetle. The M/C was about C$50 and the reservoir about
C$15, with another couple of dollars worth of hoses and clamps. I had to
drill two small holes for the supply lines, and I mounted the reservoir on
the gas tank strap (you may have to do it differently on a T6) for easy
access and inspection, although you could mount it underneath the steering
box cover and avoid drilling holes.
Duane Spencer's "356 Performance Handbook" discusses this modification
using an early 911/912 M/C and a T-fitting to connect all the lines, but I
found the VW part to have the same number of holes as my car has lines, to
be cheaper, and to be perfectly adequate for street use. The rear brake
line required some bending to hook up, but if you are very careful, and it
isn't rusty, it can be done quite easily. Duane Spencer also strongly
recommends the use of new brake light switches with this installation
(about $4 each).
IMHO, the VW dual M/C is inexpensive, satisfactory for anything but
a dedicated racing car, and easy to install. The peace of mind from this
<$100 and 1/2 day project is a fantastic insurance policy for your 356.

Subject: Sunroof booming

Hi, Paul.
 
Your 924/944 vibration with the sunroof open and the windows closed is not
unusual. Many cars, maybe even most cars with sunroofs, not just Porsches,
do that. It seems to be turbulence from the opening causing a booming inside
the cabin. Opening a window even an inch or two makes it go away. It's not
really a design flaw, just something that sunroofs do.

Subject: sticking ignitions

The recent posting about the stuck 914 ignition prompts me to ask for
advice about how to determine whether the ignition switch or solenoid
is the culprit in such cases (other than blindly swapping parts $$$).
For the last several weeks, I have occassionally noticed my 951
continuing to crank for a fraction of a second after releasing the
switch.  I can imagine trying to hook a meter up to the switch, but I
am not sure this would help much given the short time period during
which the extra cranking is occuring.  Any thoughts on the probable
cause or how to diagnose it?

Thanks,
Milo

Subject: 356 dual master cylinder

Hi, Rick.
 
Many 356 owners put in an early 911 or VW master cylinder with split braking
circuits. If you lose a hose or line to one circuit, you still have the
other. No, you don't still have 1/2 your original stopping power, but you've
got something.
 
Dave Seeland had an excellent article in the 356 Registry, Vol. 14 #3,
p. 11, Feb/Mar 1990.
 
Disc brake cars use the early 911/912 master, drum brake cars may be able to
use a Super Beetle part.
 
Vol. 10 #3, p. 6, indicates that one possibility for a dual master cylinder
source was the 1967 VW Type I 19 mm master, part no. 113.611.015.BD.

Any words of advice on rebuilding my '65 912s gearbox? Lubricant?
Additives?, The input bearing growled loudly when I bought it.
Got a new one direct from FAG for $25, (Automotion $60),
a long search though, obsolete #s. Other likely failure points??,
 (ie. just do ALL the bearings dummy!). I've a full gasket/seal set, could 
use the guide plate for setting the selector forks, anyone got the specs. 
for this
item?, I have shop services available for fabbing one up. Wasn't going to 
disturb the diff/R+P unless....? Thanks folks,   tim s.

p.s. - anyone with 5-1/2" x 15 chrome steel wheels to fit my car for sale, 
clean and true?, and...  if not then what's the tire of choice (dry street @ 
90HP remember!) for the 4-1/2" rims I have? Last time I bought 165 tires was 
for a Saab 96. Nope, not interested in concours purity or racing, don't have 
the resources for either, sigh.

Rich,
 
I do not have any experience with after market nose jobs, but,
American International Racing (AIR) does sell a Turbo nose that

If you do find yourself in the market for the OEM Turbo fog lights

From: pfile (Porschephiles Mailer)
Subject: Monthly Message to List Members

July 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

I've been as busy as the proverbial one-legged man at a ass-kicking 
contest. Still, list operation remains smooth, and growth constant.

As you head out for extended vacations, you might consider unsubscribing
and then re-subscribing as soon as you're back. It'll keep the load down
at your end, and when your mailbox fills up and mail starts bouncing,
I'll only drop you anyway.... This way, you at least know what's going
on! BTW, you *MUST* ask to be re-added, rather than saying "put me back
on after Aug. 14th" or whatever...

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, PLEASE join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

P.O. Box 10402
Alexandria VA 22310

+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy.
Or they'll send you an application which you can mail in with your check.

get her to send you an application as well.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Thanks to those who answered .. I will seek out the super beetle
master cylinder.  I also did the post mortem today.  The brake line
that failed is one that has been replaced.  It had been rubbing on
the steering tie-rod and worn thru.  It brings me back to why I
want to do my own maintenance.  Then, if it isn't done right, I will
know who to blame.  I should have a new line Tuesday and be on
the road again.

Interesting, I had a test drive in the 993 last week and wasn't as impressed
as I thought I should be - it didn't accelerate as fast as I expected it should 
(I normally ride a Yamaha FZ750 which out accelarates the 993 Porsche by a long way) 
and even my 21 year old 911 seems, possibly due to much lower gearing & lower 
weight, to be more more lively up to 80 or so - possibly it's because the new 911 
is much quieter and much comfier than mine - a lot easier to drive fast too.

Oh yes, the reason for posting - I just locked the wheels at one point coming to a 
halt at some traffic lights on an extremely sharp left hand bend -  surprised me 
as I just assumed tht ABS was standard - is there an off switch??

I love the looks of the 993, I thought the Carrera 2/4 was a bit tall looking
whereas the new 993 looks (to me) more like the last pre-impact bumper style ('73)

The handling/steering of the new car, as you might expect, bears no relation
to that of my 21-year old 911 and to be honest if I was after a "toy" car
i'd take mine anyday - it sounds (ANSA exhaust helps...) and feels much more
like I think a Porsche should do and if I was going for a Porsche for a daily
driver now i'd take a 968 (heresy huh :-), or one of the last "real" 911's,
an 88/89 911 Carrera (just before the 2/4 model).

Hi Pete et al,
 
>I think you told us once what the T5 gas tank floor costs over there, and

Tweeks charges $199 for the tank floor, and from the pictures in their 
catalog it didn't seem to sharp....!
The F.O.B Praesto, Denmark, is DKK550 for the Tank floor(A and T-5). That's 
about $80.

American CarParts, which is my cousins (....and very good friend's ;) 
company, are for the moment Norwegian distributors for these parts. As to 
this, and some operational and computational help, I'm receiving Simonsen 
parts at a self-cost price. Which is about;  DKK price * 1.1= NOK price. We 
have 22%VAT. Add this to the NOK price and that's it. About $ 98 was my cost 
for this tank floor.

 >The problem here is, we all like the panels, but don't like Zim's prices.
>I'd like to find a way around that, maybe have them ordered by a friend in

Why not pick them up in Denmark at Simonsen's shop. There must be someone 
willing to co-sponsor a trip if you write a story 'bout the best quality 356 
panel manufacturer. Thorkil, which is the name of the owner is also a 356 
enthusiast. In Germany there is a representative, W.Kuhn GmbH, I can find 
the tel. no. if interested.....!

The repro panel is (as I remember) 1mm, that should be original. (Or perhaps 
0.9mm.) It seem thicker than the 0.9mm sheet metal I buy at the local 
hardware store...... I compared 'old rusty' with the new Simonsen tank floor 
and found them to be *Identical*! The repro is OEM quality....No more to 
say! You better check this pieces Pete, I'm starting to sound as a sales 
representative, the parts are just *perfect*! The tank floor does not have 
the wiring loom 'cover', this piece has to be removed from the old floor and 
welded to the new one. This was a simple task. It come in Oversize, and you 
can decide whether you want to leave the edges of the old floor and just 
'patch' the new floor, or weld it from inside the coupe like the original. I 
choosed to go for the 'original' install and it was really simple as I got 
it going.

This is just the style I have in mind for my '60 T-5 coupe. I've just
started welding on it, and the car is a real straight forward project
as the former owner sandblasted and cleaned out the car before I
bought it, just welding and grinding left for me.....(yahoo....!)

Dear 'philes,

Here's a general question: a mechanic just told me that the front brake pads
on my 1983 944 are down to about 10% (looks right to me) but no metal has
touched the rotors yet.  He insists that the rotors MUST be turned, or I will
get "a lot of squeal."  The rotors look as if they have never been touched,
but feel smooth to me (18,500 authentic miles authentic miles on the car).
What do you think?  A ploy for my money, or a standard, correct move?

My 2 cents on street racing: I did it in West Texas growing up in '50s car
culture, managed to damage my own car a bit, saw others trashed, saw a few
bodies in the street.  Here in Salt Lake City, street racing has cost a few
lives in recent years.  City streets and suburban roads are just too crowded
for this adolescent "fun."  That's what autocross and tracks are for.  Cool
it, dudes.

Hi boys and girls,

Back on line, sorta, in Cincinnati.  The 23rd move was the worst yet, 
and fortunately the pcars and family are safe.  Warning to people  
moving out of or around California:  "Mule Packing" out of Sacramento  
farms out packers to various moving companies.  We were victims of theft.  
Not saying that they did it, but _someone_ did.  The correct people have 
been notified and we love our lawyers.  United They Fall, so to speak :)

The 914 arrived in one piece in Houston (lucky car) and from what I hear
it isn't going to be in one piece much longer.  Stan and Elmer are going
to have some fun.

Paul drove the 944 cross-country with our 4 year-old miracle baby in
3 1/2 days.  The 3rd water pump belt re-tensioning was due in Kansas, 
but you know how things are when you are in a hurry.  

We had hoped to trade the 944 in when we lease a loaded, thin skinned,
low priced Mazda 626.  However, for $3100 trade-in offer for the 944,
Mazda lost out on a lease or possible sale.  

As for door slamming a Mazda, DON'T push on the door - it will dent.
Mazda removed ours without any major body work, to the point where
it is not noticeable.  Joining the ranks of Punkin and Inky is
Viva Verde.  Didn't look Frog-like enough.

Paul will be driving the 944 to work (back at GE Aircraft Engines) and
commute with Delta back to Stanford.  When the car finally dies, there will
be lots of parts available.  At the moment, there are four original 7J 15"
wheels that would love to move out of storage.  Willing to sell in pairs,
and I have found UPS and they will do COD (unlike CA).  The email address
on Who's Who will work, but I am really at cmxiv@tso.uc.edu   Which reminds
me, if anyone know of a real computer system to access, PLEASE let me know.
This system is time limited and the un-edited replies that contain complete
messages are causing some problems.  

For those of you that knew about our daughters, Arianne did not need
surgery and is doing extremely well with less 'stuff' in the air.  Alej's
broken leg has healed nicely and was released from medical care in
March (broken 10/92).  Both girls are ready to start swim and tennis
lessons at the local recreation center, and will both start full-day 
school in September.  Which means if anyone has an idea for a displaced 
aero defense worker PLEASE let me know.  Willing to re-locate, especially if
it is near a college or university where Paul can teach and I can study
some more.  Just as I was over-qualified to work in CA, I am over-qualified
to take classes here.  Anybody out there from George Mason University?

Girls were surprised that people speak English in Ohio, and I am glad we
have left the racist region of that Republic.  Sad to see that elements of
of that persist on pfiles.

Glad to be back, and books and manuals are un-packed.  Paul won't be as
available to help decipher wiring diagrams, but the case of the sun roof
jitters- subsonic accoustics.  The front edge of the opening is shedding
vortices.  The deflector, when vertical, eliminates the problem.

No longer from the Farm,

If the rotors are basically smooth, then you needn't "turn" them.  Your 
mechanic's full of warm brown stuff.

Squeal happens for a couple reasons, but usually it's because the pads 
crud-up; more agressive braking cures this in short order.

Personally, I replace my rotors when they're extremely worn or when 
they crack (Porsche, other cars).  Unless they're in bad shape, 
"turning" them does little more than line the shop's pockets.  Sure, 
for a race car it might be a good idea to do, but new pads will cut 
themselves to match you rotor's surface fast enough.

My opinion, your mileage may vary!

Guten Morgen,

Does anyone have any experience with those replacement heater hoses
(the ones that run from the blower in the engine compartment down to the
heat exchangers) made out of neoprene?  I guess specifically I'm talking
about the stuff Tweeks. Perf. Products, etc sells.  Mine are worn out, and
I noticed yesterday that the one that runs down to the passenger's side
HX basically broke off at the blower motor interface.  I guess I'll order a 
new one today, but Stoddard's has the original type for about $25 (for the
one I need only) and I can get the replacement neoprene ones (both of them) 
for about $29, I think.

Any bad experiences with the replacement types?

Also, as a result of the collective net wisdom, I exorcized that foul demon 
liquid (Castrol GTX) from my engine and replaced it with Valvoline Racing
20W50.  I do believe that my oil pressures were a little higher as a result.

despite the fact that the catalytic converter is standing in the corner of
my garage with the rest of the stock plumbing.

I can't really say it goes any different from stock, neither better nor

I recently replaced the ones on my 82 911.  The original hoses were
paper-aluminium-paper.  I found these very very brittle (in fact I
busted them when I tried to remove them to make valve access easier).
I replaced my hoses with Aeroduct "SCAT" tubing.  This an orange flexible
hose which I think is some sort of cloth impregnated with silicone or
neoprene over a spiral wire frame.  I use this kind of hose on my
airplane for exactly the same application (moving hot air from the
cabin heat exhaust shroud to the cabin).  This hose is available from
most aircraft parts dealers and engine shops.  It is available in 1/4"
diameters (from 1/2" up to huge).  The sizes are named for the multiple
of 1/4" (ie SCAT 10 is 2.5", scat 4 is 1" etc).  It comes from the
manufacturer in 11 foot rolls, a lot of places will allow you to buy it
by the inch.  The hoses is rated for continuous temps at 550 degrees f.
It's hardwearing and FLEXIBLE, it will not stand up to puncture with
sharp pointy edges and corners however.  If my memory serves corectly
the LHS hose is SCAT 10 and 18" long, the RHS is SCAT 8 and 33" long
(you'll have to remove the AC I think to get at the connector).  I
paid around $20 for the two pieces.  First place to try would be an
aircraft engine shop, try you local MUNICIPAL airport (ie Don't look
for an engine shop at JFK).

I have to replace the wiper switch on my 82 911SC, but I have not been
successful at removing the steering wheel housing.  There is a screw on each
side of the housing that should free it up, but it doesn't.  It feels like it
is being held by screws from the inside.  Surely you don't have to remove the
steering wheel in order to get to the housing!  Any hints?

    As an interim solution, try taking out the bottom cushion of the
stock seat, and replacing with a folded towel.  It gets you a little
lower in the cockpit (important for me) and you get extra lateral 
support from the side bolsters.  Keeps your butt in place.

DRIVERS ATTEMPTED TO SUMMARISE THE DETAILS OF AN ACCIDENT IN THE FEWEST
POSSIBLE WORDS. THE INSTANCES OF FAULTY WRITING SERVE TO CONFIRM THAT EVEN
INCOMPETENT WRITING CAN BE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.

 o Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I
   don't have.

 o The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intention.

 o I thought my window was down, but I found it was up when I put my head
   through it.

 o I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

 o A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

 o The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I
   hit him.

 o I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and
   headed over the embankment.

 o In an attempt to kill a fly I drove into a telephone pole.

 o I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I
   reached an intersection a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision and I did
   not see the other car.

 o I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had
   an accident.

 o I was on the way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal
   joint gave way causing me to have an accident.

 o As I approached an intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a place where
   no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time to
   avoid the accident.

 o To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front I struck a pedestrian.

 o My car was legally parked as it backed into another vehicle.

 o An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.

 o I told the police that I was not injured, but on removing my hat found
   that I had a fractured skull.

 o I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the
   road when I struck him.

 o The pedestrian had no idea which way to run as I ran over him.

 o I saw a slow moving, sad faced old gentleman as he bounced off the roof
   of my car.

 o The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with
   a big mouth.

 o I was thrown from my car as it left the road. I was later found in a ditch
   by some stray cows.

 o The telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out of the
   way when I struck the front end.

I gather that the front spoilers on 944's take quite a beating.  I found that
repairing them is rather easy as summarized below.  I'll be happy to provide
more details to anyone interested by direct e-mail.

I finally got around to repairing the front spoiler on my 944.  The left corner
had been gouged and scraped backing out of a tight parking space with a high 
side curb.  During the repair I discovered that I was not the first.  The
previous repair was made with Bondo.  I removed all that and made the needed
repairs using 3M's flexible parts repair material - very easy to use.  For
primer I used a spray can product with a flex agent.  The color coat was
acrylic urethane, again with a flex agent.  I sprayed the latter on with a
mini sprayer from an art supply store using the left front tire for the air
supply.  Total material cost, including the sprayer and respirator cartridges, 
was under $100.  I am very pleased with the result and the job was much easier 
than expected.  The main requirement is lots of patience to get the shaping and 
sanding correct.  The paint does not cover errors, it only accentuates them!

Hey There !

Does anyone know where one could rent the cam tension tool required for doing

seen it is for about $380 - of course Automotion is way over priced at $500
(I suppose they have charge more to cover the cost of that big, glossy
catalog, but then again I've noticed that every place that has a catalog is
WAY overpriced. I only go to them for hard to find parts.)). In any case,
where can we rent this tool? If there is no place we can rent, borrow or
(steal, just kidding) it, then is anyone interest in setting up a "Cam Belt
Co-Op" organisation??? I live here in Chicago, is anyone else in this area
interested in splitting the cost of the tool? Between 10 people the cost
becomes pretty reasonable, even if we have to UPS around to each other. Any

Bob,
  Very bad idea to use 7" rims in back. I suspect this will lead to massive
oversteer, assuming you downsize tire width as well. The factory had a good
reason for larger rims/tires in back. The tire widths, in combination with
swaybar sizes will materially affect handling.

  Stick with stock (or go wider, which _was_ a factory-endorsed option). BTW,
when shopping for rims, be sure you get the right offset. I got a very nice
set of stock rims for my '87 because the owner of an '86 had bought them
thinking they would fit his car. They didn't, and vice-versa. His loss, my
gain.

Hope this helps,

I have to take a bit of offense at this.  I used to own a Scarab (280Z w/a
Chevy 350 engine).  It made well over 300HP and weighed right around 2800 lbs
(porbably less).  But there was no "engineering craftsmanship" involved.  You
bought some new motor mounts, a transmission adapter, and a wiring harness,
dropped in your own balanced & blueprinted 350 from your favorite speed shop
and you were on your way (in a hurry!)  Never mind that the thing handled like
a shopping cart at any triple-digit speeds, and the frame wasn't really up to
handling that much torque -- it moved!  Not that the RX-7 is as cobbled up as
a Scarab, but it takes more than power-to-weight to make a sports car (even in
America!).

Had this happen with my '87 944S under the same conditions.
It shook my car rather violently about 70-80 mph. Scared the crap

Subject: 928 Trasmission probs?

Greets,
 
I am still looking at the 84 928S.  The owner is down to $9500 (FIRM) and it
looks like it might be worth purchasing.  I finally got to drive the car for
more than 20 minutes and here is what I found...
 

Alignment is fine, does not wander or shake even up to 100mph.
Engine is ok, starts with no prob, does not overheat, smoke, etc..
MOST electical stuff works except passenger window and mirror switch is messed 
up.  (it works in some directions.)

What does bug me is the same thing that has concerned me from the beginning.
Now I have some extra observations... 

I checked the accellerator cable to see if it is sticking.  This does not seem 
to be the case.  If I try to do a 0-60 run, the car will crawl from stop to 
3000rpm at which is will perk up and really take off.  If I put the car in
1 or 2 (automatic transmission), it has very good acceleration.  

After driving a 91 Maxima and comparing it to the 928, I am beginning to think
that there might be a transmission problem.  In the Maxima, when I stomp on it,
the car will downshift and the rpm's will go up rapidly.  In the Porsche, the
transmission will NOT downshift when the accellerator is put to the floor.  
This causes the car to accellerate slowly until it gets to around 3k rpm when 
shows it's power and really takes off.  
 
Does anyone know what could be causing this problem and if so, what the cost 
could entail?  I like the car but having a 928 that could not be a VW GTi to 
70mph is kind of useless to me.  ( I have a VW and it would bug the hell out
of me if my VW could beat my Porsche, 4cyl vs. 8cyl, etc..)

Thanks for any help...

Paul,

  My VW Corrado has a 2-way retractable sunroof. With the roof retracted, I
get the phenomenon you describe at about 30-40 MPH. As you observed, opening
the windows to relieve the pressure seems to cancel the effect. It is
analogous to blowing over the top of a bottle. You just have a much larger
resonant cavity in your interior than the bottle's interior.

  Now you're going to make me have to try this experiment to see if its the
same speed on my 951! (I hardly ever remove the sunroof; it rains too often
here in Vermont in the p-car season).

On my 914 I took a stock seat cushion and removed perhaps 3/4 of the
thickness of padding. This is relatively easy, since the bottom of
the cushion is formed by stapling to a cardboard-like material.
After unstapling, I just cut the foam with sissors, if I recollect.
I initially did this to get enough head clearance for my helmet, but,
as Dave suggests, I also discovered that the stock seat then provides
more lateral support. That, plus a racing harness, provided pretty
decent seating (although not as good as a real racing seat. I just
used this "chopped" seat cushion all of
the time, which would probably be uncomfortable with the "towel"
approach. Extra seat cusions in less-than-concourse condition are
pretty cheap at swap meets, if you don't want to chop your original
cushion.

911 Owners

I'm sure someone out there has removed their antenna.  How is it done?  Please
don't tell me I have to remove the driver's side door.  It just looks like
I have to, right?

Also, I want to install some rear speakers in the rear panel, but its really
shallow, the metal firewall is directly under the rear deck.  Are there kits
available for rear speaker installations on 911's.

914 Manifold Removal
    Hey, all.  On a note related to my last question (about the
Temp Sensor II), is it easy to take the manifold pipes off of
a 914 (2.0L, if it makes a diff.) with the engine in the car?
From the pics in the shop book and from looking at the outside,
I think they are held on the outside by the same piece of metal
that holds the injectors in, and on the inside simply by the
manifold hoses...
    Anyone?

Subject: '87 924S/944 Oil Usage

Either oil spews out or its burned up, thats my understanding.

Anyway, on a 600 mile trip from Pasadena to San Simeon/Big Sur and
back, it looks like I'm down about a quart. I think it was full before.

I've been using Castrol 20W50 regular. The oil has 2000 miles on it,
including this trip. I have seen numerous messages about this oil
smoking at high speed.

Normally, LA freway traffic travels at 50-75 mph. This trip I had the 
opprotunity to go a bit faster, once out in the middle of nowhere.
Also the car saw a lot of high rev passing (can you say MOTOR HOME).

The auto tranny has the car at 4000 rpm @ 80mph. Its a 3 spd. 
I am wondering how much the engine likes being at 4000 or 5000 rpm
for an hour or more. I guess I'm just used to the shi*boxes that have
the crusing gear. Of course, on those the tranny has to downshift to
get any acceleration at all, and the shift gives some delay that is 
nonexistant on the Porsche because it doesnt have that

I am thinking of switching the oil to Mobil 1 synthetic 15W-50.
Any comments, pro or con ? I couldnt find Valvoline synthetic at
Fedco (paid $21/ 6 qrts BTW).

Is this normal 924S/944 behavior. No oil is leaking enough to drip onto
the garage, so I sassume its being burned.

Oh, thanks to all who responded re: sunroof. My car no longer acts like
a cola bottle wind chime.

Here's a solution that I find amusing.  My wifes XJ-6 experiences
major buffeting with the sunroof open at speeds over 40 MPH.  It
varies with how far windows are open, if ther rear windows are
open, etc.  Jaguars answer is a two position switch.  Position one
is for driving.  It will only allow the sunroof to open about
1/2 way.  Positon two is "parade" (or something like that) to allow
you to experience the full open motoring effect, and the roof opens
the rest of the way.  Very proper and all.

Kind of like fixing the 40 MPH shimmy in the front end -"don't drive
40 MPH".

I talked with a Porshe mechanic recently about this tool and he
told me not all tension tools are the same.  Apparently some aren't
made by Porsche and calibrate differently.  He told me to just remove
the gravel guard and the belt cover, drive the car to him, he'll
set the tension with the proper Porsche tool (when the engine is cool)
and I can put the car back together myself.  $25 for setting the tension,
$50-$60 if they have to remove stuff themselves.  You might see if a mechanic
in your area would be willing to charge you less if you made it
easier and less time consuming for him.

Subject: Re: 924S/944 Vibration with Sunroof Removed


You want the flap in the vertical position. That flap removes the 
"buffeting" effect. The wind moving across the open top with the
flap down must create some sort of resonance effect that causes the
whole car to shake. Like blowing across the top of a bottle. Don't
know all the physics, but the flap probably breaks up the windflow
enough to remove the effect. 

Something I've noticed is that the flap also causes a bit of windnoise.
You can pull the flap down at speed with your hand to about a 45-degree
angle and reduce the windnoise. You can kind of play with the angle
but you'll notice the buffeting effect take place as the flap approaches
horizontal.

	Try rethreading the hole and then putting the sensor in
using a good anti sieze. If that won't work, go for a heilicoil
insert. If you don't know how to do this you need a machinist.

	The thing may not have been cross threaded in the first
place as this is intended to be a tight fit for max thermal contact.
If installed without anti-sieze the Al-Steel mismatch will gall
the threads preventing easy removal. A little worse thermal contact
won't have much effect as the sensor doesn't change things much on
the 2.0l anyway. This is because Porsche put a resistor in series
with the sensor to adapt to the 2.0l. This results in a slightly 
fatter idle mixture because the series resistor makes the injection 
"think" the motor is colder than it actually is. The sensor is easy 
to test by measuring resistance to ground with an ohmmeter. 
If my memory is correct it should measure about 300 ohms warm
and a few kohms cold. You should look up the correct numbers. 
On my '74/2.0 the motor runs fine once warmed up with the sensor 
wire grounded. If I leave the sensor wire open, it idles a little 
rich, but not too bad. Note that a special socket should be used to
remove/install the sensor without damaging the connector on top.

Subject: Synchronizing of Stacks on my '73

Reid

After bringing my '73S into the dealer last week for a smog, I decided to at
least try to balance the six velocity stacks with my friend's old style (with
red plastic pellet) Uni-sych.  The dealer was absolutely no help BTW.  They
said it would cost at least 250.00 to adjust the MFI pump, I said you're
dreaming and left.  

Anyway, while adjusting the stacks, I noticed that two of six adjustment screws
had no effect on the Uni-sync reading.  One cylinder always had the pellet
pegged at the top of the guage, while on the other one I can't get the Uni sync
guage to match up with the other four "even" stacks, even if I turn the air
correction screw out 8/2 turns, which is supposedly the max you want to go.

Do you think I have carbon problems with the air passages for the two stacks
?  How do I clear them if this is the case?

Also, by turning these air correction screws, what am I doing to the air/fuel
ratio?  Is clockwise richer and counter cw leaner?  Or do they just control the
flow of the mixture which is already set by the adjusting screws on the MFI
pump?

As usual, thanks for the help.

When they advertise a 20% off sale and you call to order very often the

happened too often to be a coincidence.

I purchased an expensive (.031) distributor from them for my 356 race car. 
It came without the rubber O ring, meaning a trip to the dealer, who, of
course doesn't stock it, but can special order it, meaning a second trip
back to the dealer when it came in.  I wrote Automotion a nice letter

   David, yes, you have to remove the steering wheel, luckily Porsche makes
   this a very easy job--the steering wheel cover snaps off the top, the wheel
   itself is secured with a 22mm or so nut on top of a splined shaft. The
   plastics have 2 screws inside (top and bottom halves), I know, I broke mine
   the first time...   
    If you break the plastic "grommets" that attach the steering wheel cover
   to the wheel, I hear they are available separately as an Audi part number.
   As long as you ease the horn cover off, though, this shouldn't be a        
   problem.  
    To save yourself some time, make sure the steering wheel is pointed  
   exactly straight ahead before you remove it, so it doesn't end up at 
   12:30 when you put it back on. This will keep you from driving up and 
   down the driveway til its straight.

      Good luck and good wiping ! Lee

As Jim points out, turning Porsche brake rotors is, as far as I know,
unnecessary.  The only point to turning them would be to correct deep
gouges.  A certain amount of "jagginess" is normal and should not be
of concern.

With the asbestos-free pads on the market today, squealing will be an
issue even with new rotors.  Backing pads or anti-squeal goo is the
solution.

I would check the rotors for minimal thickness, which is stamped on
their hub.  If they are too thin, have them replaced.

Well, the obvious first thing is to find out for sure where the coolant
is leaking from.  If it is the water pump, get it replaced.  It is hard
to say how long it would be "OK" to drive it as is, since most people
get them fixed as soon as they're diagnosed.

Mike,
  Most 911 mechanics in the bay area should now stock it.  I'd recommend 
going through your mechanic first.  I just had Tony Heyer replace my oil 
with Swepco yesterday.  The local distributor up here in Santa Rosa (I 
have name and address at home) was kind enough to tell me that Tony 
probably had it in stock, and he was right.

Tony didn't charge me for replacing the gear oil, though I'm getting a 
minor tune up on the CIS/cold start/rear brakes today.

I went through severe 911 withdrawal yesterday, but that's another story...

However, if you do this stuff yourself, and are in the bay area, I think 
Carlsen's is $10.00 or so lower than Automotion.

If you like Red-Line, some of the San Jose Auto parts stores sell it at 
$6.99 a quart.

Under 2K$? That's a pretty cheap mod. Well, what you really want isn't more
power at all, but more Torque to the wheels. The cheapest way to do that
is to gear down the final drive. This will probably hurt your top end,
since you will reach redline sooner in top gear, but it will increase the
acceleration in all gears until you get there. You will have to shift more
often... but that's the kind of price you have to pay for a cheap mod.

Also, they either have the stuff or are able to get it very quickly.

And now, back to... 

The Tale of The Punctured Radiator!

So, Hubert, being the nice guy that he is, decides to take us all out to
dinner!

Now, all along I have been cursing anything related to water, so of course, 
BOTH Hube and his S.O. (Laura) order _FISH_.  Sure enough, when the food
comes, the waitress shanks it and dumps almost the entire load of food
(fish included) into our laps...

I am beginning to think that Hubert is bad luck, or at least he should stay
away from anything water cooled (like the trout he ordered...)

So last night, we give Hube the Toyota and the keys to the garage so he can
get the fixed radiator and install it.  After a debate with my S.O. over
who should give up their garage keys, it was mono-laterally decided that I
should give up mine...  This morning, I go to take off for work, and sure
enough the garage was securely locked with my 911 safely tucked away inside...
Well, Hube _thought_ he was going to sleep in today...

Tune in tomorrow for the dramatic conclusion (I sure as hell hope so) of...

If, as I suspect, the first problem is describing behaviour when your
foot is on the floor (ie, throttle wide open), then the answer is no,
it's not the lambda sensor.  Past about 80% throttle, the WOT switch
on the throttle signals the DME to go "open loop" and ignore the
lambda sensor.

With respect to the second problem, the dealership should be able to
measure CO (etc.) before the cat via the test pipe in the engine.  With
the lambda unplugged, you look for about .8% to 1.2% CO.  With it
plugged in, the value should drop to about half that.  Having adjusted
the air/fuel mix, you should then see acceptable numbers after the cat.

If I had to guess at your problem, given the two symptoms, I'd say that
you have a bad air flow meter.  Could be something else, or could be
a combination of things.  But I'd start with the AFM.

Well, actually you do have to remove the steering wheel to get that steering wheel
shroud off.  The screws that hold in the turn signal and the horn contact pass
through holes on the inside of the bottom half of the shroud.  You'll need to pull
all this stuff of to change the switch anyway.

At least pulling the wheel is not that hard!  You'll need a big socket to remove
the locknut (I think it's 27mm, but you'll definitely want to check this out).  I
pulled all this stuff when the outer steering wheel bearing started to break apart
(apparently a common problem with the unnerving effect of making your steering
wheel wobble around, although it seems to work just fine).  I did manage to mess
mine up a bit when I had the wheel off.  There's a circlip/retaining ring which
sets the position of the steering wheel in the column.  I pulled it while working
on fixing the bearing and didn't completely seat it when I put things back
together.  The force of tightening the locknut popped it off, and the wheel
scooted down to far on the spines.  Not so fun then.  I didn't need a steering
wheel puller until I made this mistake.

Good luck!

I've worked on several German clocks out of Karmann Ghias

On the electic wound type there is a spring wound by
a selenoid.  When the spring winds down a little arm with
a contact (just like in distributor) touches and
kicks of the selenoid to rewind the spring.

These things last about 15 years without service..
  THAT IS INCREDIBLE SERVICE LIFE
considering shitty US car clocks use to last about 2 years

THe cure is to spot weld in new contacts (hell to do)
as filling old contacts never lasts long.
Who does this??  Maby look at old VW type mags for an idea.

I seem to remember reading in the Haynes manual that the DME CPU should be

Is this correct? Any other recommended procedures. I believe that all plugs

Anything else I should be aware of?

Subject: Re.: 924S/944 Oil Usage.

>Either oil spews out or its burned up, thats my understanding.

Yes, sometimes both. It seems that every 944/924S in existance leaks oil
somewhere. Mine has a leak between the cam sprocket cover and the cam
housing. When it leaks bad, the oil drips down onto the exhaust manifold and
we have a smoke storm. My guess is that it's the O-ring that seals these two
pieces together, and I'll go in and fix it when I do a timing belt change
(and that will happen when I can get my hands on that %*&*%$ tension guage).
In any case, I'd say that if the leak isn't that bad, and you're not
noticeing excessive oil loss, then don't worry about it too much. My car
loses about 1 quart every 3000 miles, which I figure isn't that bad.

>I am thinking of switching the oil to Mobil 1 synthetic 15W-50.
>Any comments, pro or con ?

I have found that the synthetics tend to accentuate oil leaks if they are
present. I first discovered my leak when using a 5w50 synthetic. I switched
over to Valvoline 20w50 racing formula, and the leak has been a lot more
subdued. I also find that regular oil doesn't smell nearly as bad as
synthetics when it burns on the exhaust manifold (after leaking out of the
motor). The synthetics smell really bad when they burn !!!

Subject: Urgent! The Saga...

Ok, 

	This is really Hubert's story but I got to a computer first, so I'll 
tell my side first!

	It all started when Hube put out a distress call about being stuck in
Sacramento with a coolant leak in his 944 (don't get me started right
now about the superiority of air cooled motors...)  I gave him a call, turns
out he wasn't that far away, so we made arrangements for him to bring the car
to my house first thing in the morn, since I had the garage, tools, etc.
He stops by the bookstore and picks up a Haynes (since his is back home in
Vancouver...)

Please note that my 944 experience is close, but not quite, NULL;

So, we jack the car up, start poking around, and surmise that it is the 
radiator that is the problem , so we yank it out, no problem.  Plug up the
holes, put it in the bathtub (my S.O. LOVED that..) and verified our 
findings.  Well, this is July 4th, and those of you in the States know that 
in the good old USofA, NOTHING is open on the Fourth, so we spend
the rest of the day mountain biking, eating, and finish it off with a trip
to the fireworks show at Cal-Expo.

So, Tuesday morning (mourning?), I take the day off, and he starts calling 
around for a radiator.  The only place that can get one is AutoSport, 
and it'll be in at noon to noon-thirty.  As we're heading to get the 
new 'rad, he sez to me "gee, we forgot the old 'rad!" to which I replied,
"we don't need it, we're getting a NEW one!!!"

$400 later ($570 Canadian), we get back to my house with new radiator, 
start putting it in,  and suddenly I realise that we don't have the temp 
sender switch or the trans-cooler fitting.  Sh*t!.  So I send Hube back 
with my car (my precious AIR-COOLED car, no less), while I put everything else
back together.  He gets back, with a wicked grin, and smoking brakes and tires,
and the old'rad, we hook up the trans-cooler, hoses, struggled with the top 
three fan-housing-to-radiator bolts, and finally got everything back together.

4:45PM  fill er up with anti-freeze, crank 'er up, and tired but jubilant,
we are discussign where we want to go for dinner.  So I sez (and by now I
look like the BIG-STUD-MECHANIC) go ahead and take it for a spin, so he
shuts it off so I can get the jack stands out from under it, and from the
mouth of Hube come the words "Holy SH*T, where's _that_ comming from?" "What?"
sez I? "Look! its leaking!" sez Hube.  Yup, it was.  Back into the air the car
goes, and I into a faceful of ethylene glycol (HOT! I might add!). 
There is definitely a leak, and it is a good one! I pull the bottom three 
screws off of the fan housing, and peer into it, and there they are, TWO 
holes in the top of the radiator core.  It slowly dawns on us that the 
three @$^#@!@$! bolts that hold the top of the fan housing to the 
radiator (that we chickened out and only put in two of) were too long, 
and we had drilled nice little holes right into the brand new  
$400 ($570 Canadian) radiator!!!

So, off comes the new 'rad. (Geez I'm getting good at that!) We have it off
in under 15 minutes, no joke.  Off we fly (to get there before they close)
to the radiator shop to see if they can fix it  - $30 quote, but we'll see...
So now Hube (and Laura, his S.O.) are stuck with my S.O.'s old Toyota for
wheels to use for parts runs tomorrow (Wednesday...)

Tune in tomorrow for the dramatic conclusion of...

The Tale of The Punctured Radiator!

You'll laugh! (_we_ didn't)

Paul,

  My VW Corrado has a 2-way retractable sunroof. With the roof retracted, I
get the phenomenon you describe at about 30-40 MPH. As you observed, opening
the windows to relieve the pressure seems to cancel the effect. It is
analogous to blowing over the top of a bottle. You just have a much larger
resonant cavity in your interior than the bottle's interior.

  Now you're going to make me have to try this experiment to see if its the
same speed on my 951! (I hardly ever remove the sunroof; it rains too often
here in Vermont in the p-car season).

Bob,
  Very bad idea to use 7" rims in back. I suspect this will lead to massive
oversteer, assuming you downsize tire width as well. The factory had a good
reason for larger rims/tires in back. The tire widths, in combination with
swaybar sizes will materially affect handling.

  Stick with stock (or go wider, which _was_ a factory-endorsed option). BTW,
when shopping for rims, be sure you get the right offset. I got a very nice
set of stock rims for my '87 because the owner of an '86 had bought them
thinking they would fit his car. They didn't, and vice-versa. His loss, my
gain.

Subject: 914 with a funny leak

I ask the net for advice:

  I have a 914 with a leak (no big news there) the problems is I can't seam
to find out where it is coming from.

  Monday I jackup the car and started with a oil change/value adjustment.
While i was under the car I made up my mind to find that oil leak so I looked
all under and over trying to find fresh oil, none could be found. So I 
put the filter back on and filled it up and started it, Oil started dripping
around the oil filter in rivers.  So i turned the car off and looked at the
filter it was snug, so i tighted it (now I won't get it off). Then I started
the car again, just a little oil leaked then after about two minutes no more
oil.  Strange so i let the car cool off and tried it again, and it leaked 
around the oil filter for about two minutes then stoped.  So what is causing
the leak, oil cooler, filer????  Why does it only leak untill it get warm.
could that tell me where the problem is???

 Help..

   Thanks

Hi all,

Please excuse me if this has been discussed before...

I was planning to clean the engine & engine compartment on my 944, but
now I'm confused. The owner's manual says that if the engine compartment 
is steam cleaned or otherwise washed the wax based protective 
coating will be lost. 
What is this coating and what is it protecting?
Is there a safe way to clean the engine & engine compartment?

Thanks in advance for any help,

Hey There !

Does anyone know where one could rent the cam tension tool required for doing
a proper belt change on a 944? I find the cost of the tool (the cheapest I've
seen it is for about $380 - of course Automotion is way over priced at $500
(I suppose they have charge more to cover the cost of that big, glossy
catalog, but then again I've noticed that every place that has a catalog is
WAY overpriced. I only go to them for hard to find parts.)). In any case,
where can we rent this tool? If there is no place we can rent, borrow or
steal (just kidding) it, then is anyone interest in setting up a "Cam Belt
Co-Op" organisation??? I live here in Chicago, is anyone else in this area
interested in splitting the cost of the tool? Between 10 people the cost
becomes pretty reasonable, even if we have to UPS around to each other. Any
ideas on this one ???

Dave,
  I think it's a darned good racing 911 body, but you will need to 
replace that engine with a 3.0 or later for reliability.  You do have the 
first year of galvanized paint, so you shouldn't have too much rust.

I have heard mixed things on the Terbatrol.  Have you considered 
options?  The "old" style radiator or later "hoop" models with 
thermostats, which are original porsche products might be viable options.

B&B muffler maker also makes a fender and/or radiator cooler I believe, 
not sure how good it is though.

Steve,
  I replaced my antenna without removing the door, but by using a lot of 
tweezer plier tools.  I wish I did remove the door, it was really 
difficult getting a) the mounting screws on and off, and b) the wire to 
the radio through the rubber eyelets (soapy water helped). 

Also, in my '77 911S, the original antenna was metal.  The "original" 
from Automotion has a plastic base, and needs a machine shop to fit a 
911, but in all fairness it does sound ok and work...

Anyways, be very careful from scratching your door edges (I nicked mine) 
ifyou don't take the door off first.

Yes, I have another stupid question.

First of all, thank you all for answering my concerns about the "Drivetrain
slack" problem. You of course, were right, and I was on glue. I would also
like to thank Mike Kehr (and everyone who assisted him) for his notes he
recently posted on 944/951 clutch replacement.

Now to the point. I have recently replaced the Ox. sensor on my '84 944
because I noticed that when I pulled the spark plugs, they indicated a rich
mixture. Since the car has 60,000 miles on it, I figured it would be a good
time for replacement. I called up a local import parts store to get prices on
an Ox. sensor, and he said that I had two choices. I could get the proper
part (which has a connector on the wire) for about $80, or a part that is
identical in performance to the proper part, the only differece being that it
has a crimp connection and heat shrink (as opposed to the conector for the
wire). This part he said was $30.

Hmm. Spend $30, or $80 ???

Well, I had to think of that for about 2/100 of a second and then bought the
$30 part. I have installed it on the car and it seems to be running much
better than with the old sensor, so I am happy. But is this the right part
??? The numbers on the parts are as follows:

Old: 025 8001 031 (made in Germany - Bosch).
New: 025 8001 025 (Made in USA - Bosch).

So hey, do I have the right part? The wrong part? Does it matter? I have put
5000 miles on the car since I put the new sensor in, and when I look at the
plugs, they look normal (no excessive carbon deposits, burned electrodes,
etc.). Does anyone here have enough knowledge on Bosch part numbers to know
what the difference is between the two sensors ???

Any and all comments welcome.

Subject: 911T stock or not



I was asking a mechanic with quite a bit of experience some ways to get
more power from a '71 911T when an engine rebuild is done.  The car right
now is stock 2.2L w/Zenith carbs.  He suggested putting in a different
crank to get more displacement and go with 911E pistons to get more horsepower.
He said he expected that the horsepower could be raised to about 160-170.

I understand there is quite an advantage to having a 911 as close to original
as possible for resale.  Would modifications to the engine reduce the
appeal to a potential buyer?  The car is a daily driver, about 30 miles
a day to work and back.   I know that the '71 911S has larger brakes than
the 911T.  Would the 911T brakes be adequate to accomodate the increased 
horsepower?

Subject: Re: Mechanical clock don't work 


Robert,

The clock on my '67 912 didn't work either when I first got it.  There
is a fuse of sorts inside the clock that consists of two springy
pieces of metal soldered together with a solder that melts at some low
temperature.  In my clock the "fuse" had melted leaving an open
electrical connection.  My memory of the details of how I fixed it is
very hazy since I fixed it about four years ago, but I think there was
some sort of mark or label inside the clock that indicated the
temperature at which the solder should melt, so I found some solder
with the same melting point, soldered the metal pieces back together,
and the clock has worked perfectly ever since!  

As an electrical engineer, this outcome makes me just a little bit
uncomfortable because when fuses blow there is usually a reason, but,
like I just wrote, the clock has continued to work without a problem
for nearly four years now.  The reason why the fuse melted in the
first place will always be a mystery I suppose.

The most difficult part of the project was getting the trim ring off
of the clock face.  There really isn't a pretty way of doing this
without the correct tools that speedometer shops use, but if you're
careful you can pry off the trim ring without leaving any scars that
are visible once the clock is installed back in the dashboard.

If your brother would rather have a professional do the job for him, I
recommend Palo Alto Speedometer very highly.  They have done excellent
work for me on a couple of speedometers and a tachometer in the past.

Subject: Re: Why is Automotion such a rip off? survey 



Jim,
    

Top 10 reasons why I also don't shop at Automation except as a last
resort:

1.  Their prices are _always_ higher than Stoddards or Tweeks.

2.  They sell and promote Weltmeister parts.

    (the Weltmeister rear-torsion-bar bushings for 911/912s squeak and
    groan constantly (see postings from at least three others on this
    list with the same complaint), and Weltmeister anti-sway bars are
    very poorly engineered (see postings from numerous folks on this
    list.))

3.  The test tubes that they sell for measuring the output of
    accelerator jets on Solex and Weber carburetors are too long.  

    (The butterfly valve in Solex and Weber carburetors will hit the
    bottom of the test tube and 3 times out of ten the test tube will
    break and leave broken glass in the carburetor! (Please don't ask
    how I came up with this statistic! 7:^) Obviously, they've never
    tried to use the test tube themselves.)

4.  They do not pay attention to customer complaints or suggestions.

    (I suggested to two of their salespersons that they look for a
    shorter test tube to sell, but was met by only indifferent stares
    from both.)

5.  The J-tubes that they sell for 356/912 engines do not fit.  (There
    are welds at the end of the J tubes where the tubes are supposed
    to slide into the muffler.  The welds get in the way and make it
    impossible to slide the tube into the muffler.)

6.  They don't test any of the products that they sell (at least for
    356s or 912s)

    (witness items 2, 3, and 5.)

7, 8, 9, & 10.  Their sales people lie (well, at least one of them does.)

    (When I called to complain about the J-tube problem, I got the old
    "nobody else has ever had a problem" response, AND the sales
    person had the gall to call me back to tell me that he checked
    with Harry Pellow and Harry told him that they worked fine.  Well,
    I talked to Harry a little while later and found out that Harry
    NEVER uses those J tubes because they are made of metal that is
    too thin!  They are very enthusiastic and efficient when taking
    your order, but beware if your ever have a problem with their
    products!)


In summary: bad prices, bad parts, and bad service.

Subject: Re.: 924S/944 Oil Usage.

>Either oil spews out or its burned up, thats my understanding.

Yes, sometimes both. It seems that every 944/924S in existance leaks oil
somewhere. Mine has a leak between the cam sprocket cover and the cam
housing. When it leaks bad, the oil drips down onto the exhaust manifold and
we have a smoke storm. My guess is that it's the O-ring that seals these two
pieces together, and I'll go in and fix it when I do a timing belt change
(and that will happen when I can get my hands on that %*&*%$ tension guage).
In any case, I'd say that if the leak isn't that bad, and you're not
noticeing excessive oil loss, then don't worry about it too much. My car
loses about 1 quart every 3000 miles, which I figure isn't that bad.

>I am thinking of switching the oil to Mobil 1 synthetic 15W-50.
>Any comments, pro or con ?

I have found that the synthetics tend to accentuate oil leaks if they are
present. I first discovered my leak when using a 5w50 synthetic. I switched
over to Valvoline 20w50 racing formula, and the leak has been a lot more
subdued. I also find that regular oil doesn't smell nearly as bad as
synthetics when it burns on the exhaust manifold (after leaking out of the
motor). The synthetics smell really bad when they burn !!!

Subject: Need 3.2 & G50 for 911SC


I bought my 1982 911SC three years ago. It has 100,000 miles now and is
the best car I've ever had. Just last week however, I was going 50 mph,
and getting ready to pass, I shifted down to 3rd. Well, my right hand must
have been 1/2 inch too far to the left, as I found out when I let out the
clutch that I had caught 1st gear instead. As you can imagine, 1st gear at
50 was not too good for my engine. I'm amazed at how easily that normally
balky 915 transmission went into 1st gear. My mechanic tells me that I
have bent valves in at least 4 cylinders. This isn't the kind of work you
can normally schedule in advance with your mechanic, and I won't know for
sure until he has time to work on it, but it's going to cost 2 to 6
thousand dollars. The cost depends on whether it needs only a valve job,
pistons and cylinders, or splitting the cases. I've read that these cars
can go 200,000 to 300,000 miles before they need any major work.  My
questions are these:

 1) How common are these ultra high mile cars? Do many cars need major
 work in the low 100s, say up to 150,000 miles?

 2) If it turns that I need more than just a valve job, I'm thinking that
 it wouldn't cost any more to swap in a 3.2 engine and G50 transmission.
 Would that be a good idea? I've heard that I would have to replace the
 suspension cross tube, pedal assembly and possibly even parts of the
 wiring harness. Does anyone have experience with converting from 3.0
 liter and 915 transmission to 3.2 and G50?

 3) Does anyone have a low mileage 3.2 & G50 for sale?
 If so, please phone me at (303)443-2001.

 4) My brother has a set of ultra low mile pistons and cylinders from a 1986

First, never buy used injectors. You already have some of those...

Second, in theory the hose can be replaced if you use German high-pressure
braided hose (get the Wurth stuff) and German style hose clamps (not the
weak American water hose stuff). If the hose is shot, odds are good that
the rest of the injector is marginal just from age. Your car will really

     It all started today, July 6th, 1994 when the owner of a Loco Wholesale
Porsche Parts Warehouse called the Maestro to ask about a camshaft problem.
Seems as though the Wholesaler sold to a Shop a new Repro Porsche 356/912
Cam with "RO 200.05" on the gear end and "2PN-71" stamped further down the
shank. The Shop later called the Wholesaler back, to say that said Cam was
WRONG!!! And returned same to the Wholesaler.

      It was then that the Maestro got the call from Jim, another of the
Maestro's Inside Sources who keeps the Maestro informed of trends (usually
bad)  in the World of Porsche Replacement Parts. In which the Maestro has a
Vested Interest.

      This time Jim asked the Maestro to please come to Funnyvale to see
something Interesting. 

      The Maestro, always wanting to look at Things Interesting, drove right
up, as usual, at Highly Illegal Speeds.

      And this is what the Maestro found: 

      Ifin one has recently purchased a "RO 200.05" Cam, one might want to
check their recently purchased Cam for the following Problem:       (And,
you'll be pleased to know, that one does NOT need a Camshaft Grinder nor a
Degree Wheel to inspect for such a bad cam. All one needs is one's eyeball
(as long as it is at least loosely attached to a brain), and  the Maestro's
advice.

      Break the Virgin Factory Seal on your new Cam, hold it by the gear
end, so that the cam is pointing vertically downwards.  Face North. (Or
pretend you're facing North.) Arrange the Oil Pump Drive Slot such that the
Slot is going East-West. Note that an extension of the Oil Pump Drive Slot
goes through ONE Bolt Hole. Arrange the slot so that the Bolt hole is on the
East (or  Right hand) side of the slot.

     If you're cam is OK, the FIRST Cam Lobe from the Gear End will point
towards 6:00 or your Major Reproductive Organs. (Both sexes can use this
procedure.)

     If your cam is BAD, the First Cam Lobe will point towards 10 or 11:00
O'clock!

     If your cam is one  of the BAD ones, the Maestro's suggestion is that
you return it from whence you got it. If you're desperate, however, and
willing to gamble a little, it IS possible to still use this cam by
arranging the cam such that the first lobe is pointing towards your
aforementioned Primary Reproductive Organs, installing the gear and making a
mark on the gear for your new timing mark.

     But then, pity the poor guy who takes apart the engine the next time!

     Ifin you'd like more details on this procedure or if the above isn't
sufficiently clear to you, feel free to E-Mail the Maestro at
MAESTRO132@aol.com or contact him by Land Line at (408) 727-1864. 

     Meanwhile, we must now add the Current Cam Problem to the, sadly,
ever-growing list of things to Watch Out for when rebuilding a Porsche
Engine:

1. The Above Cam Problem.

2. 80mm 911 Pistons in 82.5mm 912 Cylinders, giving 2.5mm Running Clearance.

3. "Original" SC/912 Mahle Pistons and Cylinders that no longer have the
iron insert with the Aluminum Fins. They are now apparently "Nikosil" with
no iron insert and  "dull" rather than shiny cylinder fins that'll drive the
Concours judges crazy. 

4. Original Kolbenschmidt 356B "Standard" Main Bearings that come in the
foot-long blue boxes with the bearings inside a bubble pack, that sometimes
have a First Under (0.25mm)  Middle Main, making it rather difficult to
assemble the Crankcase without seizure! 

5. 912 Starters that are really 928 Starters that will cause your engine to
crank BACKWARDS (but not start, of course.) 

6. The Bad Batch of Flywheel Nuts in the small 1" cubical boxes that break
at 150 Ft-lbs, far short of the 375 Ft-Lbs Porsches require. 

7. Weber carbs with Factory-Installled Italian Wine Beetles in the idle
passageways. 

8. Repro Brazilian 912 Cranks that come in boxes that say "Made in Germany".
Yes, the boxes are Made in Germany, but the cranks are still made in Brazil.


    Yes sir, it's Caveat Emptor out there. And in the case of Repro Porsche
Parts, it's Caveat Emptor SQUARED!!! But you still gotta: 



KEEP THE 356 FAITH!!!

Subject: 356B T-6 Rubber Fuel Tank Neck Collar

 I have been trying to figure out how to fit the Stoddard rubber 
collar for the fuel tank filler neck onto my '63 T-6. I infer from 
studying the exploded parts sketches from Stoddards and Brett 
Johnson's book that the collar fits with the open slot (in the thick 
part of the collar) toward the bottom and at the 6 o'clock position.  
Two problems:

    1.  I don't know how far down on the fuel filler neck the collar 
is supposed to be;

    2.  There is insufficient clearance between the hole in the filler 
compartment and the tank filler neck to squeeze the thick part of the 
collar onto the neck.

    How do I install the thing (w/out pulling the fuel tank) and where 
does it go?  Does the thin part of the collar extend up into the 
filler recess or butt up against the underside of the compartment?  If 
it extends up into the compartment, how far?

    Thanks in advance for any wisdom on this minor item.

Subject: Re: 914 Manifold Removal

Dave, I removed my temp sensor the day before yesterday, and moved the
intake manifold to do so. I think that actually removing the manifold is
unneccessary in the best of circumstances (the temp sensor can be
approached at an angle from between the manifold pipes), but was it you who
had a cross-thread temp sensor? Anyway, each manifold on a 2 liter is held
by 3 (three) 13 mm bolts and lock washers. Two of these bolts are obvious,
on the right and left edge of the manifold, but one is well hidden
underneath the manifold, in its middle. Just stick a wrench with a short
extension in there, you'll get it. On the right side you will have to
remove the intake pressure sensor. To replace the hidden bolt, I put some
wheel-bearing grease in my socket, to hold the nut and washer in place, and
just screwed in back in, easy as pie. At this point I cracked the injector
hose, and smelled gasoline, but thats another story.... Thanks to those who
made suggestions about replacing the injector hoses.  Michael

Subject: Replacement for Goodyear Eagles?

I just *know* I'm gonna get flamed for this, but I gotta try....

I've been riding Goodyear Eagle ZR50's (225/50ZR16) on my 86 928S since I got
it. Two years ago I replaced two of them when one of the pair developed
a tread problem. I've been happy with the tires -- this is a daily
driver car, and I don't do autocross or concours. They've given good 
mileage and service.

Now it's time to replace the other two. Alas, the ZR50's are no longer
available on the Euro market. Local dealer tells me the replacement is
the "GS-D" model at $220 per tire. So, my choices are:

	o	Buy two GS-D tires, run the other 2-year-old ZR50's
(cost: $440)

	o	Buy four GS-Ds (cost: $880)

	o	Buy four of something else (cost: $?)

So, the question is: Is there an inherent risk in running two different 
types of tire on the same car? (Tread design is definitely different.) 
Is the GS-D a "good" tire for daily driver/high speed cruising? Should 
I just get four of some other tire? (What's OEM now for Porsche?) Should 
I bag it all and buy a '59 Corvette like my wife *really* wants? Sigh....

Kevin, if the transmission does not downshift when you floor it at any
reasonable speed, I would say you are looking at a doodah'd-up 
transmission. There are a lot of possibles, but at least the slow
off-the-line acceleration indicates the transmission is not getting 
down into 1st gear. Have to assume the engine is running right... no
stalling, bucking, rough running, etc...? If so, the tranny is the
culprit.

One way or another, we're looking at some signficant bucks here for

   If you are up to trying it yourself, Bill Hirsch sells Connolly dies.
 It is actually I think a flexible lacquer, you spray about 20 mist coats
 over the seat, eventually it changes to original color. This of course isn't
 the same as vat-dying but I don't think even most Connolly hides are vat-dyed
 anyways. Plus you don't have to take off the seat covers, which really are
 difficult to replace on sculpted, high-back Porsche seats.
   The stuff is expensive, if I remember right I paid about $125 for 3/4  
 gallon, but it did the whole interior (front and rear seats, door panels,
 console, etc) with some left over and made a night-and-day transformation 
 of my worn leather. They may also be available in spray cans, try and dig up 
 your interior color number and see if Bill Hirsch can match it.
  
   Does anybody know whether the dye is available thru Porsche ?

The scale of the problem was stated to be "10 drops of coolant <each day>"
which is about what my pump leaks too. It's been doing that for about five
years now and I attribute it to the 5 months that the car sits each winter
without the pump turning. No big deal. I handle it by topping off with a
cup or so of premixed coolant about every other week. Am I being cheap? You
bet I am! Just check out the price of the occasional gallon of Glycol

We had a severe incident at Summit Point this past weekend.

A mazda RX-7 (92, new style) came out of turn 2 and blew it's expansion
tank.

As a result the car spun then rolled 3 times.  Needless to say it was
destroyed.

The problem was how it was destroyed.  The center of the roof came down
and touched the center console.  The was a "bubble" in the roof around
Ivan's racing seat with vey probably saved his life.  A passenget would
not have made it.  Ivan was uninjured but had to be extracted with the
jaws of life.  He was wearing a neck support which also saved his neck.

The rear stress bar between the struts was bent up in an inverted V and
the car had maybe 25 degrees negative camber on the drivers side.

I have seen both 951s and 911s (in targa form) flip in the same place.
Though both had damaged body panels, neither had crushed cabins.

Basically my point is that the RX-7 had no reinforecment in the roof
whatsoever.

People who know porsched know of the integral roll cages on the 944
series and tripple thick boxed sectioned rockers.

I had been very impressed with the Mazda until I saw this.

I've installed both a Terbatrol and, later, a B&B oil cooler my 911SC. 
 These have all the necessary plumbing from the oil tank in the back to the 
front loop.  On these cars someone who is

reposition the horns.

Advise please:  In phoenix my engine temp still hits 250 in traffic on real

fan back to the thermostat so it kicks on automatically?  where should i

This car will be a little more tricky because the plumbing from the oil tank 
to the front has to be added.  this, too, is not difficult.  you just have 
to be able to get the car far enough off the ground to position the oil 
lines.  any 911 from 78 (SC's) on will have the oil lines to the front.

Personally, i'd buy an SC for the reliability.

Also, FWIW, i've been running 15W50 Mobile 1 for about 6 months now.  My car 
seems to run a tad cooler (hard to tell in the desert right now - - 
everything is hot!).  however, the car now has a few minor drips.  my 
mechanic said it's because the synthetic is a little more "slippery" and can 
find places to leak out that regular oil can't.

Paul,

  My VW Corrado has a 2-way retractable sunroof. With the roof retracted, I
get the phenomenon you describe at about 30-40 MPH. As you observed, opening 
the windows to relieve the pressure seems to cancel the effect. It is 
analogous to blowing over the top of a bottle. You just have a much larger 
resonant cavity in your interior than the bottle's interior.

  Now you're going to make me have to try this experiment to see if its the
same speed on my 951! (I hardly ever remove the sunroof; it rains too often 
here in Vermont in the p-car season).

I had a similar experience when I had my 944.  I got what felt like a
strong vibration from the hatch area at highway speeds but not to the
point of shaking the car quite hard as Paul experienced.  Turned out
to be turbulence in the hatch area from air entering the car through
the roof opening, shaking the roof lid, making it vibrate. The vibration 
went away when I took roof top out of the back and left in the garage.  
The roof was in the back, paint-side up and was not in the storage bag.

Mark,

I had a fuse in my '87 944S that was not making good contact.
It affected the door chime, clock, lighter, rear hatch, and
interior lights.  Once I got the fuse making good contact, all
the above started working.  I'd check the fuse. I'm not sure
how close 944 and 928 electrical systems are.

Normally a Q45 ALWAYS starts out in 2nd gear, and his new chip allows it

Subject: Re:  914 with a funny leak

Damon,

I think I've got a good idea on this one - I've just seen the same
thing on my 914 at an autocross.

Same story, engine cool, oil topped up, start the car, warm it up as
it pumps out close to a quart (or about $3 worth of Mobil 1).  After
it's warm, things get better.  When you climb under the car, it looks
like the filter or the oil cooler are leaking.  

The key here is the temp of the oil.  When it is cool, you leak, when
it's hot, you don't.  So, being temp. related, and near the front of
the engine, it makes sense that it's the cover for the oil presure
relief valve.  The valve is pressed down by the cool oil and back to 
the bottom of the case without going through the oil cooler (the higher
presure of the cool oil could burst it).  When the oil warms, the 
plunger moves up and the oil doesn't reach the cover at the bottom
to leak out onto the ground.

In my case, I took the car home, pulled off the fan housing so I could
see the problem area, added more oil, started the motor, shut it off,
and then I was able to climb under and check it out.  It was pretty
easy to see where the leak was at this point.  A _large_ screwdriver
to tighten things up and the leak stopped.

Check this out.  I sounds like your problem is the same as mine.

Subject: Re: 944 brake rotors

The reason given to me for turning P-car brake rotors is that it allows
maximum brake efficiency after new pads are installed.  The loss in
efficiency is not due to grooves in the rotors but to larger (for lack
of a better expression) waves in the face of the rotor which prevent the
new pads from making full contact with the rotor. The problem, if you
call it that, goes away as the pads wear and eventually conform to the
face of the rotor.

Sounds like you are describing a leaking radial oil seal, which is an
easy fix.  You (your mechanic) should also check the metal spacer
(sometimes referred to as a "slinger") on the end of the cam in
eight-valve cars.  It can wear a groove where the radial oil seal
rides on it, and need replacing.

  I asked Tony about brake pads, and he mentioned that there was "hype"

anything else, but for me he recommended factory brake pads, and he knows 
I drive pretty hard.

I specifically asked him about Repco and their claim in the Imparts ad to 
last longer, and he agreed they will last longer than stock pads, but are 
likely to wear on the rotor, which is unacceptable to me.  

Think about it, if the Cool Carbons really worked, Porsche wouldn't need 
to keep advancing their brake designs (which are always the best in their 
class), they would just use the fad of the month (C00l Carbons seem to be 
in right now), instead of larger brakes in the Turbo and racing cars, and 
now ABS-5 from Bosch in the 993.

No, the rubber centre clutch is just fine.  The spring centre clutches
break springs, which can jam between the pressure plate and disk,
stranding you.  The rubber centre isolates the transmission from
torque spikes during shifting and so is easier on it.  Transmissions
are real expensive compared with clutches, and 951's tend to chew
them up a lot faster because of their clutch.

You can upgrade to the 85-1/2 aluminum arms, which are stronger.  But
expensive.  I really recommend this upgrade to anyone with an earlier
944 who is getting serious about track events.  We pulled an
instructor's car out of the woods at Bridgehampton last year when his

As a counterpoint, and as a Cool Carbon user for three track seasons, they
work, they do not groove the rotors, and their claims are not "hype".

It's a matter of intended use; stock pads dust a lot, but are adequate for
the street. They will warp rotors on the track (don't ask how I learned
this), whereas the Cool Carbons do not. The stopping power differential is
significant.

Cool carbons are great on the track!  You can brake later and your
brake fluid stays below its boiling point so you don't get spongy
brakes by the end of the day/weekend.

But they do squeel at low brake pedal pressures, which you only
do in the pits.

I use the cool carbons on the track, and then put my stock pads back
in for street use between track events.  The stock pads are
just fine for me on the street.

All,

All the comments concerning 928's with ATs and the poor performance have 
finally struck a nerve.   I would like to state my comments about a properly 
functioning 928 AT.  

It is not set up to start out in anything but 1st.   It will take to 2nd 
quickly without adequate throttle.   It will not go back down above ~20mph.

The Mercedes box has NO stall speed, thus starts are at the mercy of current 
RPM's torque.    I have 5 liters pushing over 3400lbs.

It was not designed to be a stoplight winner,   I would have kept my 5.0 
5speed Mustang GT if that was all I was after.   But it is no lacky either, 
published 0-60 for a '86 is still in the upper 6 sec range, 7's for the US 
234hp version.

Where it shines is on the road with 50-100mph sprints passing cars at will.
You have to look at the entire package,   ride in a properly set up car, 
then judge.

   I can't explain why the clock was "on the fritz" only

You *CAN* clean the injectors, but for people who don't have the tools,
it's easier to replace them. And don't ask you shop to clean them unless
you've *SEEN* their cleaning and blueprinting bench -- they'll just
put some goop in the gas and claim the injectors are now clean. The
exception is if they use the LubroMoly setup that uses a directly
injected cleaner (i.e. the car "runs" on the cleaner instead of gas).

In my experience, if you send them out to be blueprinted, they're
perfect; if you assume they're perfect because the last set was, they're
going to be bad....

The 914 injectors aren't as bad about going off as the CIS injectors are,
but I still wind up replacing the injectors in the race car every

It is my understanding that treadwear numbers only have  
relative meaning within a particular tire manufacture.  A 
treadwear number of a Yoko AVS cannot be compared to a Comp

Would this also be true with traction and temperature

John, have you considered installing header tape around the portion of the pipes
to which the clutch cable is being exposed.  Tapes from manufacturers such as 
ThermoTec (available at many performance shops) are extremely good insulators
and are relatively robust.  Once a pipe is wrapped, SS hose clamps can be used
to secure the tape inplace.  Obviously, the accessibility of the pipes may be
an issue making this approach too difficult, but I thought I'd suggest it as an
option.

Daryl,

When I had the problem, the clock was functional in that you could
set the time and a time was always visible. But it would not stay
accurate.  After a day, it would be 5-6 hours and xx minutes off.
I haven't looked at a schematic to see what feeds the clock.

My problem with the fuse was, in a straight up position - no contact,
if I leaned the fuse to one side - contact.  I didn't feel like
removing the fuse box (it was night), so I wedged something between
this fuse and the fuse next to it to lean it to one side.  Everything
has been working ok since I "fixed" it in February.

Subject: Injector cleaning or replacement

Alex Noordergraaf asked about cleaning injectors or using used ones.
 
On my 84 Carrera, I had a very subtle miss at about 100 km/h, 60 mph -- just
German country road speeds. It was the kind of thing where you had to know
the road and your own car to be sure it was there. A mechanic would never
have noticed it. No problems at top speed or full throttle. I took it to a
friend's independent Porsche shop in Stuttgart (even Porsche employees look
for a cheaper alternative to the factory shop) and he looked for all sorts
of problems, without success. Even started swapping out parts like the brain
box on a trial basis, no charge for the parts unless I needed them.
Anyway, his conclusion was that it must be injectors, since he didn't
have any of those to swap and didn't have a way to test them, but the
factory did. So I went to the factory and yes, they did have an injector
tester -- a brain box, a potentiometer to set it, and six graduated
cylinders all strapped to a wooden board. The brain box can be set to inject
three different volumes -- idle, midrange, and full throttle. And when they
did my injectors, one had about half the volume of the other five at
midrange. I bought one injector and that fixed it.
 
Explanation: at the lower fuel volumes, the injector was hanging a bit. At
full throttle or high speed, the thing stayed open pretty much the same as a
good injector.
 
I don't believe there is any effective way of reconditioning an injector. If
you can spot a bad one, replace that only, and it's a cheap enough job. All
six, OK, that's gonna cost.

Subject: Mixing tire compounds

Hi, Pete.
 
Pete Jones asked about replacing only two tires on his 928:
>Is there an inherent risk in running two different types of tire on the
>same car?
 
Long story, but yes, you can run different tire compounds, even for a
purpose. Many years ago I went to a German Porsche Club (not PCA -- the PC
Dreilaendereck) event at Hockenheim. They made the mistake of inviting PCGB
to stop by on their way home from a factory tour. One of my friends was in
the PCGB group, so I sort of got drafted as translator. The behavior of the
Germans as astounding, funny, or outrageous, depending on one's situation.
The Germans were running for trophies and year-end points. Some of the
frontrunners took one look at the British cars and ran for the rule book.
First they protested a car for not having a turn signal in the right front.
"Extra cooling air." That was thrown out. Then they spotted a car driven by
my friend, Nick Faure, with Yokohama A008 on the front and rock-hard Pirelli
P700 on the rear. "Aha! Mischbereifung!" (Mixed tire compounds). Not legal
for German-registered road cars. But the Brits said these were registered
for the road in England, where it doesn't matter, so they were allowed to
run. In the feature race, Nick Faure's Carrera 3.0 started on the pole and
was able to hold the local hero off for 10 laps of the short course. We
could see Nick's car going wider and wider on the last turn before the
straight with every lap as his rear tires were going off. On the last
corner, he got it so far sideways that the German had to back off his
last-ditch pass attempt and Nick won the race. He had deliberately chosen
the hard rear tires because he likes that tail-out style.
 
Then there was a protest from the Germans about trophies. The Brits could
run but not for trophies. The ranking officer of PCGB replied that that was
OK, they knew a great trophy shop in South London that could make anything
they wanted. The Germans didn't get that at all, right over their heads.
Finally they said OK, trophies are fine, just no points toward year-end
awards (who cares?). At the trophy ceremony, after Nick Faure had gotten his
award, I went up to the German president with my copy of the 1985 Le Mans
yearbook. You know this race? "Aber ja!" I turned to a color photo of the
#66 Aston-Martin Emka. You know this car? "Ja." Can you read the driver's
names on the door? "Uh, Needell, O'Rourke, Faure. Ach SO!" (Translation of
Ach So! in this case is "We've been had!")
 
I had seen Faure do this to PCA/Germany Region at a slalom a few years
before. He absolutely blew away local heroes Jim Brunson and I think Dave
Minkler or Steve Nichols at Wiesbaden Airfield in
some machines including a track-prepared Carrera RS and one of those
steamroller 914/6s with what looked like a stock Carrera 3.0. When he got
his trophy, the president asked if he had done this before. "No, I've never
run a slalom before." Oh, well, you did really well your first time out.
"Thank you. You know, I have run Le Mans for the last 10 years, but I've
never done a slalom." You could hear our jaws drop. I checked later -- his
best finish was 6th in 1975, Carrera RSR.
 
So re your tire question, if this is for a 911, you can go to a stickier
tire in the back to give even less tendency for terminal oversteer. The car
will probably feel loose at the front as a result. I wouldn't put a
less-sticky tire on the rear of a 911 (even if Nick Faure does -- his P700s
were absolutely shot after those 10 sideways laps), but your 928 would be
more forgiving.
 
Can you have somebody mail Eagle ZR50s from the U.S.? That would be the
cheapest course. The Tire Rack in Indiana has the best prices I've found,
and their catalog lists U.S. and German-made VR or ZR 50s, and the NCT. They
are at 771 W. Chippewa Ave., South Bend, IN   46614-3792.   tel (outside US)

All this talk on brake pads is starting to get confusing. It seems as though
many in this group are trying to apply race technology to street use. If I
am not mistaken Cool Carbon pads are designed specifically for track use.
The thermal Isolator is not necessary for everyday driving. Why pay for     
Something you don't need. Cool Carbons also don't really start to work well
until they get warm. This would never happen in normal street use. Cool Carbons
also have a very strange brake in cycle, It seems that they lose their braking
power during the first heat cycle. Several members of Rocky Mountain Region/
PCA found this out during a driving school. I guess the moral of the story
is before you use race technology on the street make sure that it won't
cause you safety problems.

Just did this on a '71 911T as part of a 3.2 conversion. I *LIKE* the

The unit that was installed was used, but we had it throughly cleaned

Rather than turning the rotors, you can achieve the same bedding in (as
it is called) during the first hundred or so miles of street driving.
This takes care of truing the pad and rotor to one another.  Again,
turning the rotors is unnecessary.

Steve,

You're mistaken on two points.  The first is that Cool Carbons, and all
the carbon pads for that matter, work fine at ambient temperatures.
Unlike DS-11's, they do not need to get hot to work.  Their coefficient
of friction is very stable over a wide temperature range.

The other point is that the "green fade" you mention is no more or less
a problem with OEM street pads.  They all do it, and they all need to
be properly heat-cycled prior to going to a track event.

Hope this helps.

Clark,

As I recall, there was article in some  Hot Rod magazine suggesting the
header tape may cuase premature wear on the headers.  I cannot
remember why, I think the tape tended to cook the headers.  Perhaps
a better solution would be to wrap the clutch cable instead?
Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

That's just simply bullshit, quite similar to claiming that A008RS
are for racing period. Correct choice of compound (there are at 
least four) to match your driving style and car weight makes 
Cool Carbons great for track, autox, street or mixed use. They're
*NOTHING* like say Ferodo DS-11's, which *ARE* strictly for
racing -- you can not get them warm enough on the street to have
*ANY* brakes for the first dozen stops, and damn little thereafter.

I use, and recommend, Cool Carbons without hesitation for all competition
use, and find them to be completely acceptible for street use. Repco
Metalmasters are also fine for the street and acceptible for autox
and very light track use. Textar is great for street, marginal for
all other uses.

Steve, I concur with your comments entirely. The 928S' AT should not
start out in 2d. Kevin's original comment was that he's got good accel-
eration when he starts out with the shifter in "1" or "2" but ratty
acceleration when he starts out in "D". Plus it won't kick down in any
gear when you floor it. Perhaps it won't kick down from 2d to first, 
but it should kick down 3d to second at full throttle. This leads to the
conclusion that the 1st and 2d gears are there, but the mechanism which
drives the automatic gear selection is hosed up.

Clearly this AT has some problems. No doubt a mechanic can give better
analysis than we can by long distance. But it is not the engine (IMHO),
it's the transmission. 

The 928 is a very fast car -- I can routinely get 0-100km times of about 6
seconds and I am not an expert driver! But it is a fantastic long-distance
high-speed cruiser. In a Porsche on the autobahn, Mercedes get out of your
way. In a Saab, they don't.

Enough of this. Kevin, take the 928 to the mechanic and get an estimate
on fixing the AT. Factor that cost into the cost of the 928, and start
dickering from there. If you have to, walk away. But if you buy it and
fix it, you'll knock the socks off your Volkswagen.

Subject: Re: 914 Trouble

Porschephiles, If you recall, I had trouble with my 914 cutting out.
I found that it would stall if left to idle for 10 min or so, so I assumed
this was the same problem as I encountered on the road.
To test the cylinder head temp sensor, I disconnected the wire running to it,
and grounded it. It didn't start too well, but ran fine when warmed up, until...
the engine stalled. So the trouble was not the sensor.
I then suspected the fuel pump, so I connected a pressure gauge to the fuel
rail. Just before it stalled, the pressure took a nose-dive, which suggested
the pump was ailing. I also noticed that the fuel pressure was around

Now I can't get the engine to stall, as if previous to my adjustment,
the pump was over-taxed by the higher pressure. Ah well, we'll see if
that fixes it. Comments are welcome. Michael

CIS - also known as K-Jetronic, or KE-Jetronic, often with "plus Lambda"

Constant Injection System - the gas flows from the injectors constantly
once the pressure is over about 35 psi. The fuel distributor and the
control pressure regulator conspire to modulate gas flow based on air
flow and ambient operating conditions. All gas flow modulation is done
by  changing fuel pressure.

Used in 911s from '73.5 until '84, and (help oh waterpumpers...) I 
*THINK* in the 924. Oh, also used in the 930 until late as well. Even
after DME became norm on the non-turbo 911. DME was used on everything
else except the 914 1.7 and 2.0, which used D-Jet or MPC injection
and the 914 1.8, 912E, and early 928 which used L-Jet or AFC injection.
Well, except the early cars, which had carbs, and the early 911s which
have MFI... Anyway, there's a *GREAT* Bosch book on all this stuff...

DME - Also known as Digital LH-Jetronic, or Motronic.

A true engine management system incorporating ignition control as well
as fuel system control.  It's based on a pulsed injector system where 
air flow, temp, and other sensors are used to select which of several
engine "maps" are used to determine when injectors fire, for how long, 
and how the ignition advance is handled. 

Note that you can pack a hell of a lot of engine maps into EPROMS
used in these systems. This is the ultimate in precision control for
an engine (in concept, anyway, if not in implementation)

Note also that *ANY* pulsed injection system approximates a CIS system
as you get closer to full-on: a pulsed injector has a relaxation period
wherein it is closing but not yet able to be re-opened. As you increase
the duty cycle you find that the injector is open for a larger percent of
the rotational period of the engine, until it's open constantly except
during the relaxation period. Hence, for full-throttle applications --
drag racing, race boats, midget racing, etc -- CIS is a clear win since
it's the real deal rather than just an approximation of same.

On street cars, there are other forces are work. CIS is basicly a
hydraulicly operated mechanical injection system. There are all sorts
of little things -- from tiny amounts of fuel contamination  to slightly
out-of-spec control pressure regulators -- that make it do "stupid" things
like run way too rich, have unacceptible HC, etc. Bruce Anderson 
characterizes it as a "nightmare system", and if you're not set up 
to deal with the vagaries of "programming" CIS (i.e. recurving the fuel
distributor, pressure modulation, etc.) then I concur. It's *VERY*
hard for Joe Average to come up with a CIS mod worth doing. It's even 
very hard for him to install any that are come up with by Joe RocketScientist.
On the other hand, a change in the engine map to more closely resemblt
the actual operating conditions of the cars (the diff in European gas
and temps relative to US spec stuff was certainly responsible for many of
the "huge" performance gains that where reported from early "chip" kits.

help themselves to all the money you have, that is! I used to do a

few years out there. Them and Performance Products both.

ne esoteric Fuel Injextion problem associated with early model
914s (70-72) is with the location of the fuel pump.  Because
of the close proximity of the fuel pump to the engine, a vapor
lock may occur on very hot summer days causing loss of all power.

Reinstalling of the fuel pump furher away from the engine solves
this problem.

5-1/2" X 15 steel wheels are not necessary to achieve the maximum

Pirelli P6 P 195/65 X15 89H tires will fit perfectly on a 4 1/2" wheels.

You are so right!  One solution we used is an Optima battery (appropriate for

I remember seeing that article as well, and I remembered that they said that

caused additional heat buildup and subsequent rupturing when that heat was not

I don't believe that a little tape around the header near the clutch tube will
endanger the longevity of your header too much.  Either way its gotta be better

Subject: 356B T-6 Rubber Fuel Tank Neck Collar 


Al Sullivan Writes . . . 
 
 I have been trying to figure out how to fit the Stoddard rubber  
collar for the fuel tank filler neck onto my '63 T-6. I infer from  
studying the exploded parts sketches from Stoddards and Brett  
Johnson's book that the collar fits with the open slot (in the thick  
part of the collar) toward the bottom and at the 6 o'clock position.   
Two problems: 
 
    1.  I don't know how far down on the fuel filler neck the collar  
is supposed to be; 
 
    2.  There is insufficient clearance between the hole in the filler  
compartment and the tank filler neck to squeeze the thick part of the  
collar onto the neck. 
 
    How do I install the thing (w/out pulling the fuel tank) and where  
does it go?  Does the thin part of the collar extend up into the  
filler recess or butt up against the underside of the compartment?  If  
it extends up into the compartment, how far? 
 
    Thanks in advance for any wisdom on this minor item.

- ------------------------------ 
 
Al: 
 
I just checked my 1962 356B T-Cabriolet and here's what I found: 
 
   o  The rubber collar for the fuel tank filler neck does not extend  
      into the fender cavity; on my car the upper edge of the collar 
      is simply abutted tight against the underside of the fender cavity. 
 
   o  I can see no way to install the collar without removing or at least 
      moving the fule tank itself so that the collar can be slipped over 
      the upper end of the neck once it has been pulled down and out of 
      the fender cavity. 
 
Caveat emptor:  I know that my car was completely disassembled at least once   
                before I got it 6 years ago so I cannot attest to the          
                authenticity of the the information just provide. 
 
By the way, Bob Campbell of Auto Specialties (805/251-3500) has just begun to 
manufacture a very authentic appearing rubberized canvas fuel filler fender 
flap for our cars that is far superior to the rubber flap currently being sold 
by Stoddard.  Be sure to ask him for his small but impressive catalogue . . . 
and keep in mind that because he keeps adding items to his stock, it never 
hurts to ask for an item even though it's not listed.  (That's how I found out 
about the fuel filler fender flap!) 
 
Good luck with your project.  Please let me know if you find any additional 
information on this topic. 
 
Thanks!

Help! Are there any 914 experts out there?

I have a '74 914 2.0 with a small, but nagging problem. When I first start
the car in the morning, the turn signal indicator lights on the tach
illuminate at about  half brilliance.  The exterior lighting is unaffected.
 Eventually the light will grow dimmer, until it finally goes out after a
half hour or so of driving.  The turn signals function normally, and the
indicator flashes correctly when the signals are on.

My question is, is this some sort of Porsche designed Teutonic warning of
impending disaster, or do I have a genuine phantom electrical problem?

Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Tim, the 912 is basically a 356, at least in terms of engine and some of the
suspension. This includes the wheels. Yes, you can fit 195/60 x 15 tires on
4.5 rims, but they will work MUCH better on 5.5 rims: less sidewall flex.
Almost nobody runs 4.5 anymore, I understand even the concours people accept
5.5 as OK with no points off.
 
The next Pomona swap meet is coming up next weekend. I can look for some
appropriate rims for you. Prices vary, from $20 to $80 per, depending on the
seller's imagination. On occasion I find unused 911 steel spare wheels, 5.5
x 15, for good prices.
 
For tires, there are several 195/60 x 15s that work well. Bridgestone RE 71,
Yokohama A008, and probably others are great tires.

Folks,

I'm looking at a '88 911 Coupe (with Carrera tail and chin spoiler),
45k miles.  The car appears not to have been wrecked - panels are
straight and doors & lids are centered in their openings.  There are
perhaps half a dozen small stone chips in the front lid, and one large
chip (.5 inch by .25 inch) on the driver's side mirror.  It seemed
to run well during my test drive.  Seller is asking $29.9k, but seemed
motivated to go as low as $25k (after I said, "Well, I'm really looking
a car for under $25k - so I guess I'll have to look at '86 and '87.")
I am prepared to walk, because I really don't want to spend more than
$25k (because that's what my "budget" will allow).  Does this sound
like a reasonable price?

When I get a chance to see the maintenance records, what should I
be looking for?

Does anyone have any suggestions for a place to take it for a
pre-purchase inspection in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area?

On a semi-related note, I have the pep boys 1000 CCA 84 moth battery in my 911.

This battery was also in my previous 911.  The thing that's nice about
the Home Boys is that they will give you the batteryu to take home, and
you can bring it back when it dies (whihc takes 1-3 years if you store
the car alot).  They then charge you a proreated amount (like $15) and
give you a new battery with another 84 month warranty.  I think that
ends up being $8 or so a year for a very strong battery.  These are

I understand the 356 & 912 sharing motors (although I have always wondered

in value of $22,900.  At 45k miles there's no adjustment for mileage.
I always use this number as a close approximation of "wholesale"
(what ever that is) and am prepared to pay 5-7% over this figure.  That
would make this car $24,500 max unless there is something special about
it.  I also have a computer program which is updated monthly and does
a better job of valuation (knows all the options etc) based on car sales
over the last year.  If you let me know the options, I'll e-mail you
the valuation sheet which you can use to dicker with.

Subject: Cool Carbons for street / track use

There's been much back and forth on this subject in the last days, but I do
want to add my own experiences briefly regarding my 944S2.

First the bad:

	Cool Carbons squeak A LOT in street use. The backing pad helps some,
	but does not eliminate the problem.

	Cool Carbons leave a lot of deposit on the wheel, which is not easy
	to remove completely.

Now the good:

	They are GREAT brake pads for both street and track. They do NOT
	have to 'come up to temperature' for street use. They grab
	wonderfully on the street. (Sometimes the ABS comes on in dry
	conditions if you push too hard!)

	On the track they completely eliminated my fade problems, and I can
	go MUCH further into the corner before slowing down.

Finally, an observation: they wear more rapidly than street pads (like any
competition pad) so you must inspect them often.

There is a new kind of battery becomming available which combines the
best of sealed gel-cell and liquid open cell lead acid batteries.  I'm
waiting for them to become available (very new product as far as I can
tell).  It's called a Recombinant Gas battery (RG).  Basically it's your
regular open lead acid battery except it's sealed up with some special
internal compartments.  The acid is the regular liquid except that it's
held in place between the plates in a matix of some kind (fibre glass?).
Anyway, the upshot is a sealed battery that, due I think to some much
lower internal resistance, can deliver more CCA in a smaller, lighter
package.  Maybe this is what they have.  The one manufacturer I
know of using this technology is Concorde battery co.

Subject: 911/MFI fast idle fixed


My mail server is acting up today, so if this is a second posting
I apologize.

The symptom was that my idle speed jumped up to about 1800 RPM
even though the throttle linkage was at the stop. Advance was 
10 degrees or so at "fast idle" and didn't change.

The fast idle problem was indeed caused by stuck advance weights 
in the distributor. You can test for this next time you have your
distributor by giving the rotor a twist clockwist and letting go.
it should spring back to the original position (mine didn't) a
broken advance spring will cause the same symptoms.

I disassembled the distributor to get at the weights in the base,
degreased everything thoroughly and worked the mechanism until it
moved freely. Relubricated with a tiny amount of high-temp grease
and it works great.

Subject: 911 emergency brake warning light adj.



When I was checking the fast idle problem, I decided to remove the hand
brake housing which also has hand-throttle and heater controls.

Ocassionally, the handbrake warning light would stay on, and I'd have to
jiggle the handbrake to get it to go off, so I thought I would take the 
switch out and clean and adjust it.

This turned out to be much more of a job than I expected, and my advice
to others is that if you don't have a *very* good reason to remove the 
handbrake housing, leave it alone. 

The switch isn't a microswitch as I expected, but a plastic block with
copper contact strips that mate with contact strips on the handbrake.
To adjust it, there is a single screw on the right rear of the housing
and you pull the handle up to the first click, then loosen the screw, raise
or lower it until it the light on the dash just goes on at the first click,
then tighten the screw. (all you have to do to get at the screw is lift
the carpeting and the rubber boot, and you'll need a stubby screwdriver or
a right angle straight blade screwdriver)

Hope this saves someone else some of the time I wasted (or was it education?)
BTW - it WAS in the manuals.

My 89 944 Turbo has developed an annoying problem and I need some of that
great net help.

First my problem: When returning to idle (ie rolling to a stop) the engine
RPM drops so low that it often dies. Even when it doesn't die it stumbles
and stutters at 200 - 300 RPM for 5- 10 seconds before regaining control and
returning to its normal idle at 940 RPM. The problem seems to get worse
after the engine has warmed up and with the A/C on. Otherwise the car runs
great.

I looked for a vacuum leak, but none were obvious and I replaced the 02
sensor within the last year < 10K miles.

Any help would be appreciated.

I understand the 356 & 912 sharing motors (although I have always wondered
what "detuned 356SC" means), but what suspension components are the same? You
can't mean 4.5 inch wheels because the early 911s had those too...didn't

  Greetings ??? (dunno who)..
  There may be a FEW experts out there.  Not sure 'expert' is a valid term.
  Most of us are very knowledgeable in a particular area, as a team we
seem to function sufficiently to manage just about any oddity. 

 And yes, you do have a phantom problem.
 Probably not a symptom of impending disaster tho'.

  Have you tried swapping the flasher relay?
  How is the parking brake indicator behaving (shared flasher)?
  I know, you said it works ok...so
  Behind the instrument panel is part of the car's metal bulkhead, sometimes
the indicator lamp's electrical connection wears thru the shrink tube
insulation and makes contact with ground at the point where the fast-on is.
  Fast-ons have a nasty habit of loosening up the grippers.. a squeeze
with pliars will cure this...be sure to check the ground fast-ons too.
  Ground wires in these cars is a plain brown wire (no tracer).
  The instruments are rubber mounted, so ground must be brought to them
thru a wire (brown), look here first.

  Have you disturbed the instrument cluster recently?
  Or the wiring bundle at the underside of the steering column (at dash)?

  The connections for the turn signal switching are part of a rather long
nylon housing, perhaps the connector has backed out.  There is some interior
pieces that obscure the connector from view, and if you have air...no show.

  Another possible is the switching assembly under the steering wheel.
  These age, and do break/wear out.  There's a lot of nylon and brass
that can break, wear thin, or get pretty grody.  You'll have to pull the
wheel to gain access...not a tough job if you got a generic puller.

  One other remote possibility is the terminal board in the engine compart
ment...the connectors at the ends of the 2 bundles tend to open and get
flaky -particularly when wet.

  Keepin' the 914 faith...

If you follow the brake in proceedure that comes with the pads, and do

The brake fade after the 3rd "high speed stop" (three good decels to
about 20mph from 70 does the trick) is a bit scarey the first time.
It feels like you just can't push any harder and the car just 
won't stop.  But after the brakes cool they are great.

I would say that the only reason I don't use the cool carbons on the
street is the squeel.  Otherwise they are an excellent all around

Porsche enthusiast: one who owns a Porsche for (in order of importance) the 
performance, the quality, the heritage, the sheer fun of driving, and the

Porsche stereotypical owners (none of us ofcourse): one who owns a Porsche for 
its namesake, prestige, cruise ability, performance , quality, then 
reliability. One who normally takes the car to the shop for an oil change, 
below average automotive skills, above average budget. 

Ofcourse these are two ends of the spectrum and there is room in the middle for 
all degrees of combination.

This may be way off base, but check the threaded fitting that
the oil filter threads onto.  I had this exact same problem (on
a Toyota).  It seems that the fitting that the filter threads onto
had worked its way out of the block somewhat.  I tightened
the oil filter to the point where it felt like the gasket was making
a good seal, but the filter had only bottomed out on the fitting
threads.  I had to remove the filter and tighten the threaded
fitting - this solved the problem.

Unfortunately, I have no idea if a 914 has this same filter mount-

All,

     The 356 is back with new upholstery.  Now we can even drive
it in CLEAN clothes.  The fuzz from deteriorating sheepskins
(used to keep you off the horsehair/springs) was worse than
shaggy cat hair.

     So I installed some of the mail-order pieces that arrived
while the car was in the shop, including the K&N filters for the
Solex 40 carbs.  The question is regarding the five mounting
bolts holding each air cleaner to the carb.  The old Knecht "air
strainer" had long bolts going clear through from the top.  The
K&N has short bolts holding only the bottom portion of the
cleaner to the carb.  It occured to me that if one of those short
bolts jiggled loose, it could (undoubtedly WOULD) dribble down a
carb throat.  I put some blue loctite on the bolts, but am still
worried about the possibility.

     Anyone had any (bad) experience with these K&N mounting
bolts?  I'm inclined to find some long bolts, punch holes in the
top plate of the filter assy., and mount it like the Knecht unit.

Trevor,
 
A word of caution on oil leaks, I had a oil leak at the rear of the
cam housing. Just a small leak, I thought that I would let it go
until I had the time to replace the $2.00 gasket that was the culpret.
after all I had just bearly recovered from installing a new clutch.
So I let it go for a month, maybe six weeks. Well my reward was a clutch
that had become oil soaked and useless, so bad that the sping center
broke from the slipage, the broked spring lodged between the clutch
and the pressure plate.
 
The cost of replacing a clutch (parts only) does not even compare with
the amount of labor needed. (See Micheal Kehr's exellent posting)
My first go round with the clutch took over 30 hours, the secound just
under 23 hours.
My advice on oil leaks is to hunt them down and kill them before they
can breed.
I use Mobil 1 15/30 and currently have no leaks.

Dutuned means the 912 made less HP than the 356SC, but the engines are
otherwise almost exactly the same.

On the suspension thing, I was wondering about this myself, but given that 
it was Pete, wasn't going to say anything... Well, maybe a letter to Road 
and Track, but that's all, really... 8{P

Seriously, on the front the 356 had trailing arms sprung by torsion bars, 
controlling a king and link pin setup, and in the rear, it was swing
axles on single trailing arms with torsion springs. 

The 912 is exactly the 911 -- MacPhearson struts in front sprung
by torsion bars, and combo trailing arms and torsion bar spring 
plates locating the rear hub which was attached to a real IRS.

Common parts: the early 911s and 912s  used the same wheels and tires as
the last 356s, the 912s used the same brake calipers as the 356
(except they're swapped front-to-back, oddly enough), and near
as I can tell, that's it.

Possible arguement: the tire technology is the same, so what works for
the 356 *ought* to work well for the 912. In actuallity, you can run
A008s on an otherwise unmodified 912 and do fine, but on an unmodified
356 you'll live (if you're lucky) to regret it.

So I dunno. Pete?

The DS11s are not for street use - that first stop in the morning is a real
eye opener, and I never liked them on the track either. They have a low
coefficient of friction even at the high temps they like to run at. The Cool
Carbons have much higher friction than DS 11s - higher even than stock pads.
They also insulate the caliper better from overheating. The downside is that
they squeak around town. For street use the stock pads (usually Textar or
Jurid) are fine, but on the track you can ruin them in a day or two. At
very high temps the material just burns away.

The squeaking does drive me nuts, so sometimes I switch to stock pads for
the winter, and put the Cool Carbons back on for the track season.

| Think about it, if the Cool Carbons really worked, Porsche wouldn't need
| to keep advancing their brake designs (which are always the best in their
| class), they would just use the fad of the month (C00l Carbons seem to be
| in right now), instead of larger brakes in the Turbo and racing cars, and

Uhhh...are *you* thinking about it? Better tires these days mean higher
braking forces before lock up - so we need bigger brakes and better pads.
Better pads means more heat generated that has to be vented, so we need
bigger rotors, and so on. Pads are just one part of the equation (other
obvious issues: heavier cars, higher top speed, better suspension, etc.).

Porsche selects a "soft," quiet pad that is easy on rotors for the street, but
that doesn't mean the don't believe in better pads. For racing, the Porsche
Factory has been using the Pagid pads, which are similar to  Cool Carbons,
on the 911 Turbos. FWIW, I like the Pagids the best for the track...too 
bad they
are so expensive. Porterfield has a Pagid "copy" which I haven't yet 
tried but will.

Subject: Radar Detectors


At the risk of serious flames (zip, snap, button - there, the Nomex is 
on), while I value the exceptional and learned input of the philes 
regarding the Valentine One radar detector, I understand with laser its 
about 2.5 times the cost of the Passport 4500 ($169).  Thus, I am leaning 
toward the Passport (foam & bubbles from fire extinguisher).  However, 
being one of an open mind, while I have learned about the Valentine One 
with directional arrows, etc., I would be interested in a comparison 
(pluses over the Passport) which make it so much more desirable.  Also, 
if there are any Passport fans (who are willing to admit it openly on the 
net or you can discretely reply directly to me and I promise not to 
forward your response to the whole list) I would like to hear how the 
4500 wideband with laser has been working.  Too many falses?  Too late in 
the pick up?  What's the knock on the Passport?

Thanks again for the input.  I'm going to move my computer away from 
things flammable now to wait for your responses!

Subject: tire question--general

The following does not pertain to Porsches specifically, except that
this list probably has more collective knowledge on the subject than any
other resource at my disposal.  If I am guilty of rambling, I apologize
in advance.

This is a general question that has plagued me for some time now.  I am
hoping that one of you techie-trackies can shed some light on the issue.

It concerns tires.  More specifically, the width of tires.  Let's begin
with the concept that (to a certain point!) wide tires give more traction
than narrow tires, all else being equal.  "All else" includes tire
diameter, wheel offset, tire carcass construction, rubber compound,
alignment settings, etc.  First:  This IS True, isn't it?

The big "All else" that concerns me especially is tire pressure.  If 
narrow and wide tires with the same pressure are compared, the only
real difference is the shape of the contact patch, not the size.  Or
is that incorrect?  Anyway, if it is indeed the shape that matters,
WHY?  I can see that this shape could matter in the dynamics of a 
cornering situation, but I haven't been able to figure out how.

Or is it simply that you can run somewhat lower pressures in wider tires,
so that the contact patch is larger due to lower air pressure?  As
I understand it, the coefficient of friction increases with decreasing
normal force between the tire and road, so a larger contact patch
should yield more traction, shouldn't it?

Or is it that a wide tire will actually have a larger contact patch
due to reasons other than the air pressure?  I can certainly see that
a tire tread is not anything close to a soft sided balloon.  There is
obviously more involved in determining contact patch size than the air
pressure.  The stiffness of the sidewalls and shoulders will certainly
have an effect -- HOW MUCH?

Or could it have to do with the actual pressure distribution in the
contact patch?  i.e. could the narrow tire have a more distorted 
pressure distribution which, in effect, "behaves" like a smaller area?

Or is there something involved that I haven't even considered?

Thanx in advance -- stuff like this can bug the hell out of me.

I never drove a *brand new* 911 :-( but every comment or review I've
ever heard mentioned bump steer as a from-the-factory "feature".
Certainly all the secondhand ones I've experienced display bump steer to
varying degrees depending on suspension mods.  I'm aware that struts and
trailing arms have compromises and will display some quirks no matter
how tuned, but I've always wondered why the cars should come from the
factory tuned for more bump steer than necessary.  Has anyone ever heard
a rationale for this?  Maybe some kind of safety feature to reduce
tail-happiness?  I can't believe that, for example, Stuttgart was too
lazy to not move the steering rack a few centimeters, etc etc.

2. Which radar/laser detector provides the most bang for the buck?
2a. Is it true that removing the front license plate lowers your laser profile?

3. Why do the front wheels of my Porsche get covered in brake
grease/oil/crude.  The back ones stay fairly clean?  Is there anything I
can do to prevent it, outside of not driving the car?  Is it corrosive to
the metal?  How often should it be cleaned off?  Are there any reccomended
products that don't cost an arm and a leg for enough solution to do 3
wheels?! ;-)

4.  A while back around 700 or 800 miles (I'm at 2200 now) I was cruising
down the interstate, obeying all speed limts of course, and the engine oil
light came on.  I pulled over, opened the hood and checked the oil.  Plenty
of it.  I started the car and the engine oil light was off, never to

Subject: 911 SC heater hose woes...

Greetings,

After one too many comments at tech inspections regarding the condition 
of my heater hoses, I decided to 'fix' that problem with a new set of 
hoses.  I'd purchased a set for the top part of the engine from 
Automotion some time ago, attempted to install them this weekend.

I knew I'd need to remove the A/C compressor to route the hose on the 
passenger side of the engine compartment.  What I didn't know was that 
with A/C in the car, the passenger side takes a section of 2" hose and 
a section of 2.5" hose, conveniently spliced *under* the bracket for 
the A/C compressor.  So, I attempted to thread an already spliced hose 
through the body panel--no go, the hose clamp was too big.  I then 
attempted to thread the parts through separately and then join the 
hoses and tighten the clamp...all accomplished in the 4" space under 
the A/C bracket with room for only fingers.  After 45 minutes of 
wrestling with it, I gave up (temporarily) and decided to ask for some 
advice from the collective wisdom here.

Some options:
1)  remove the A/C entirely, including heat exchanger on deck lid.  Has 
the advantage of lower weight, better airflow over the engine due to 
the grille not being blocked, and I can run 2.5" heater hose the whole 
way with the bracket gone.  I don't use the A/C currently, can always 
put it back if/when I sell the car.
2) Use 2" heater hose the whole distance, avoiding the splice under the 
bracket.
3) Remove the compressor and bracket temporarily, after purchasing the 
one missing metric wrench I don't have and figuring out how to get the 
top bolt of the bracket off--there doesn't seem to be room to move a 
wrench anywhere.

#2 is my current plan, thought I'd toss this issue on the net and see 
if anyone else has wrestled with what started out being a trivial 15 
minute 'repair'.

This reminds me of a test I heard of a 914 owner doing.
He removed the injectors from the fittings in the engine,
but left them hooked up to the pump via the hoses. He set up baby food
jars inside his engine compartment and put each injector in its own jar.
Then I imagine he cranked the engine to see if equal volumes of gas
were discharged into each jar. He must have had rubber lines.
I would like to do this kind of test with my 71 911 (mfi) but there
isn't much as leeway with the metal lines.

Jerry,

I would recommend getting the '94 Car and Driver issue that compared
Radar Detectors with Laser. This will give you fairly complete
information.

The V1 was superior to all detectors in all areas save one which I
think was X-band. But even is this catergory it was much more than
adequate. The Passport was not rated very highly. The Bell unit was
rated much higher and did not come very close to the V1.

I own a V1 and like it very much. Here are the points that stand out
for me:

1. Superior range is all but one mode.
2. Directional arrows that let me know where the threats are.
3. Incredible upgrade and facelift policy.
4. The Porsche of Radar detectors.

I have never been sorry when I spent the money to buy the best
product in any given catergory. The V1 is clearly the best. If
it saves you from one ticket more than the Passport, it was worth
the extra dollars!!

You payed good money for you Porsche and proved you wanted the
best for your money. I think you should do the same when you buy
a Radar Detector.

Hi all. Sorry I haven't been able to get back regarding the status of the 944

interested), several of us are interested in pooling our money to buy a
tension tool that is used for 944/924S belt tension, so that we my prolong
the life of our poor little valves in our engines! In any case, I have been
very busy lately (I'm in the middle of moving from Chicago to a hick town in
Wisconsin so that I can commute to Milwaukee to work, and my significant
other can commute to Liberyville, Il. In any case, we need to decide how to
organise this:

1. Who will take the money and buy the tool ?
2. How will we work the schedule in terms of who gets it when ?
3. How should it be transported ?
4. Where do we get the tool ? I have been told that there is a difference
between the gauges (ie. the one at Joe Discount's may work like shit - but at
the same time, we don't want to have to buy it through Automotion unless we
have to ...)

Any ideas on the above would be great. Although I kind of started this idea,
if there is anyone who feels they want to co-ordinate things that's fine - my

Subject: Re: 912 tires

Dear Stan:

        Been following the 912 is just a "detuned 356SC" thread for a while.
Thought it's time to clear it up a bit. The "detuned" part comes from the
stated compression ratio differences betwen the 356 SC at 9.5:1 and the 912
at 9.3:1.  Since the pistons are exactly the same, and the heads likewise,
how did the Factory accomplish this feat? Think, think, think.  Well, the
heads are ALMOST exactly the same (same valves, same guides, etc), but the
head VOLUME is a silly  cc larger (on average) in the 912. This silly cc
makes a 0.2 difference in the compression ratio!  That's the "detuning part.
Isn't Science wonderful?
         However, the 912 is NOT just a  thusly "detuned" 356SC as the  912
Flywheel is COMPLETELY different, as is the  912 Pressure Plate. The 912
Clutch Disk and the 356SC Clutch Disk ARE the same.  Also- the 912 is 12 Volt
whereas the 356 SC is (usually) 6 Volt.  And the Side Horizontal Sheet Metal
of the 912 is completely different from that of the 356SC; the sealing rubber
in the 356 goes in grooves in the engine tin while the 912 has the sealing
rubber in the body.
       Finally, the 912 Third piece was modified to take the 912's Rear Mount
and looks a bit ugly on a 356 which has and needs no rear mount.
       The Carbs (Solex 40PII), Crank, Rods, Cam, Cam followers, Rockers and
such are the same between the SC and the 912. This is why the Maestro says:

   KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!!!

	I beg to disagree. Surely "the sheer fun of driving" is the most
important thing. If it were performance, we might all choose some form of
Japanese machine (or a Caterham 7?). Whether it's a 356 or a 911 twin
Turbo, the driving enjoyment (for me, at least) should be the main
motivator!

	Maybe the UK is paranoid about "full Porsche service history", but
most owners here tend to get their car serviced by a main dealer (for
newer cars) or at least an acknowledged specialist (for older cars).
Without the appropriate stamps in the service book, the car is practically
worthless.

	I don't think that "budget" makes an enthusiast - there are
mega-rich people who really care about their cars and conversly there are
those on a tight budget who just run them into the ground.

My understanding is that the "handle" on the passenger side is a grab bar.
In order to save weight and space, and because a grab bar isn't necessary,
Porsche omitted it on the driver's side. The forward "bin" in the driver's
door is heavily reinforced and acts as a handle.

Hi pcar people

I was interested to hear what people had to say about the

I live in the UK. It is not an offense to own a radar
detector, but using it is an offense I believe. If the police 
catch you with one in use I expect that they would not be very
nice about it. I have a few questions about radar detectors
in general.

Are radar detectors usually mounted in a stealthy place or
do they sit on the dash?

Do radar detectors have a remote sensor and a concealed 
electronics unit?

What kind of power supply do they require? 

Are detectors detectable?

Does anyone have any recommendations for stealthy fitting
of these devices in an 88 911 (not mine of course :-)

Which reminds me of a test I *saw* done about 10 years ago, where 
a mechanic was working on a Mercedes 300 SL gullwing with MFI.
First, he checked spark by taking all the plugs out and laying 
them on the valve cover so they were grounded, then cranking the
engine. That was OK, so he checked gas next, by taking the injector
rack off and laying it on the other side of the valve cover....

He didn't do that test again, at least not in that shop!

Yes, it is. Which is why I wonder about this -- 0.2 compression points 
should only account for about 2-3 HP given that we're in the 9's instead
of in the 12's. The actual rated HP is what, 5 less? So where'd the rest

I don't count the flywheel or pressure plate, since it's outside the case, but 
you are in fact correct. Might as well add the throwout bearing too, which
as it turns out has a part number one digit different from the 356C/SC...
(don't ask me how I know this, but wanna buy a 912 throwout bearing?) Ditto
the side sheet metal, which I view as chassis dependent not engine dependent.

Yes! I knew I forgot something... For some reason we used to have to machine
that off, and I don't remember why we didn't just live with it...

Hi, John.
 
By suspension I was loosely speaking of everything that hangs off the
underside of the body and goes between that and the ground <g>. The 911
and 912 from the very beginning had a more modern suspension than
the 356 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arms) but
there are some similarities in the wheel and brake departments, that's what
I meant by interchangeable wheels etc. and the tires/wheels that work well
on the 356 with 5 1/2 inch wheels should work well on a 912 with 5 1/2 inch
wheels.
 
I use late-1980s 911 space saver steel wheels, 5.5 x 15, on my 356.
 
(Later)
Stan's message sums it up. Uh, yup, I meant wheels and brakes, since we were
talking about wheels, tires and such.
 
Otherwise, I know better, the rest of the 356 suspension is actually more
similar to every non-balljoint Beetle suspension ever made. (Use Beetle
parts to overhaul front suspension etc).

Right.  I replaced only the 2" (50mm) hose from the adapter to the

tube which is pretty flexible.  What kind of hose are you using.  If
you're using Al or paper-al-paper I can see why you're having a problem.
With the (much more) flexible SCAT tube it took me about 10 minutes and
100 curses (if you curse the hose frequently it will go on easier) to
get it on the adapter.  Removing the compressor is easy and helps a whole
lot (not much more room, but you don't have to assemble the hose

bracket, but it doesn't look to hard to do.

Subject: Spongy Brakes


Hello,
Is it common procedure to bleed the brake lines after/during a brake
pad change?  What I mean is, is it something that is always done as
part of a brake pad change in a shop?  

The reason I ask is that I just had the front wheel bearing and seals
replaced on my 81 911SC, and while the shop was doing it, the 
mechanic noticed I needed new brake pads.  He said they were so worn 
that he would not let the car leave the shop[ without them.  So he
replaced the front brake pads (with stock porsche pads).  He charged
me 28.50 for the front brake pads, plus minimal labor, since the
bearing had to be replaced, it made doing the pads easier anyways.

Well, now, 3 weeks later, I notice that my brakes feel spongy, and I
can push the pedal all the way to the floor until it stops, when stopped 
at a light.  The brakes work ok, especially after pumping them once or
twice, but if I forget to pump them, and have to stop hard (only had to
do this once), the brakes did not work well, and the pedal was stopped
on the floor.  (This scraed me a little). 

Does this sound like I need to bleed the lines and replace the brake fluid?  
How hard is this to do?  I need one of thoose little pump guns that holds
the fluid I guess?  Should I attempt to do this myself, or is it best left
to a mechanic?  How much $$$ should this cost to fix?  Thanks.

Subject: No Mans Land - Porsche Movie.


Hello,

After a few people at work saw my 911 converted to a Turbo body 
with a new paint job, some suggested I rent a movie starring Charlie
Sheen who plays a car thief who only steals Porsche's.

The movie is titled "No Mans Land".

I rented this last night from Blockbuster (in the adventure section) and
indeed, it was a good movie.  It is about a rich guy (Charlie Sheen) who
runs a body/repair shop called Technique Porsche, and he also is a master
Porsche thief, who breaks into and steals many porsches throughout the
entier movie.  I highly recommend it to all people on this list who would
enjoy seeing many P-cars and high speed chases, cop & robbers, etc.  One
great line in the movie, as they are looking for a Porsche to steal, and
they come across a Ferrari, and one guy says "How about this one?", and
Charlie Sheen replies "That Italian Trash, I only steal Porsches."

They show in some detail how chop-shops work as well as how to steal 
porsches.  They also promote Clifford alarms, as in another scene, they come
across an older vintage 911, and see the alarm "Clifford, to tough."

There are many, many scenes with 911's, and 930's mostly, but some 356's, 
944's, 924's, and 928's.  There are some good chase scene's in the movie 
with some very hairy driving of a 911 and a 930.  As a 911 owner, and 
Porsche enthusiast, I was constantly watching for imperfections in the movie
but found few.  I noticed some of the cars were Euro-911's (side marker
lights) and another looked like a 911 converted to a 930, since it was an
older 911 (Chromed Bumpers) but had the flared fenders (This is one of the
cars in a pretty good chase scene, were they trash the 930).

Anyways, the movie is "No Mans Land" and I would recommend it for all on this
list for sure.  Its worhth the $3 rental just to see all the cars, and how
they are stolen, and wrecked, etc.

914 Mystery Component
    Hey, y'all!
    In my (unsuccessful) attempt to add to my wiring harness, I
noticed a 2.0L engine component that is completely new to me.
It's underneath the engine on the driver's side (LHS).  It's a
cylindrical thingie mounted to the firewall (I think) with one
or two hard (metal) lines going to it, and a *monster* hex-head
on one end.  What the heck is this?
    Is it the fuel damper?  The thing that evens out the pulses
of fuel pressure from the pump?  The metal lines *might* be fuel
lines--they look a bit like the lines in the center tunnel.
    I just don't like having no clue about something in there...

While on, I'd keep the belt on to keep the pump in good shape, though it

I do agree with this, so let's assume for the sake of my question that

I also agree with this, so let's assume that both the narrow and wide tires

Subject: 944 Brake rotor shields

With all the talk about brake pads for track and road it seems a good time
to ask about the experience on the net with removing the large, metal
interior rotor shield on 944s (and I assume many others).  I track my car
('84 944) about 5-8 times a summer and the rest is street use (but only in
summer).

I've heard that the shield reflects and retains heat on the inside to the
degree that the inside brake pads might wear at twice the rate of the
outside ones.  I suspect this means my braking capacities are less than
optimal when on the track.  I'm sure this all varies in degree with
CoolCarbons, MetalMasters, or Original Eq. but the problems is still there.
I further presume this shield is there to keep water off the rotor
but I wonder just how well it serves that function.

I am thinking about removing the shield - is there a down side to such
removal?

Subject: 944 gearshifting and tire question ramblings

The first topic is that of changing gears (during acceleration) which I
find has to be done with some discretion in my 944. In other words I
seemingly have to give the gearbox just a bit of time to get everything
lined up before I complete the selection of the next higher cog, (no,
double clutching is NOT an option 'cause I'm up-shifting). It has been so
since the car was new and I have a theory to try out on any of you as may
care to comment. It goes like this. Since the clutch is at what would
generally be considered the front of the car and the transmission is at the
rear, there is a rotating mass (the drive shaft plus clutch friction plate)
which is added to the other rotating stuff internal to the tranny, all of
which must be brought into rotational syncronization by the syncros before
a shift can be completed. If I attempt to rush the process I get a slight
gronching sound that is not present if I slow my right hand by a fraction
of a beat.

In almost every other arrangement you might think of, the only thing with
any rotational inertia that is attached to the engine-side gear cluster is
the friction disk of the clutch. Thus when you shift the syncros have only
to match the speed of *that* stuff with the speed of the cluster of gears
which are attached to the drive wheels.

Do any of the rest of you experience this in your front engine/rear
transmission cars? Does my explaination make sense?

The second topic is with respect to the tire question in which the writer
embarks on a discussion of frictional forces as a function of contact patch
size, coefficient of friction and normal forces. He makes the following
statement;

        As I understand it, the coefficient of friction increases with  
        decreasing normal force between the tire and road, so a larger 
        contact patch should yield more traction, shouldn't it?

I believe this is somewhat twisted, but generally based on, what we studied
long ago in our Physics classes (which was Coulomb Friction and doesn't
necessarily apply to tire dynamics at all). Let me hasten to say that I
don't understand the detailed mechanics of how you get >1.0 G lateral
acceleration either but it doesn't make sense that the 'coefficient of
friction', (or anything else related to friction for that matter) should
INCREASE as you decrease the normal force. If it were true you wouldn't see
all these wings, air dams and other aero-gee-gaws to reduce lift on high
performance cars. We'd all be TRYING to fly, wouldn't we? No, I think this
tire friction stuff is governed by an altogether different mechanism and
it's probably fairly convoluted but at the end of the day it HAS to be
intuitive. Can anyone help us here?

A friend of mine who first introduced me to Cool carbons for track use now uses Pagid

Rotor wear than the Cool Carbons and are about the same price as the
cool carbons but work better and last longer.  He prefers rotor wear to pad wear cause
mustang rotors are cheaper than Pagid and Cool Carbon Pads!

Anyone else have experience with Pagid Pads on Porsches for track use?

  About two months ago, some fitting broke off the oil cooler on my 87 951
as I went down Main Street in my little town of Ann Arbor. All the oil fell
out onto the street, making a terrible mess, and essentially blocking the
street. Folks were quite unhappy with me, and my Porsche had to be
ignominiously towed to the dealer for a horrendously expensive replacement
cooler. So, I'd repliy to your questions:
1. It could be a big problem.
2. It cost me $900 to fix it, but I am nearly certain that this price was a
ripoff by the dealer. I would interested in hearing other estimates or
actual costs for this repair.

Hi,

Has anyone ever seen stone guards for the rear fenders of a 930 made of
CLEAR plastic, instead of the factory black stick on stone guards?  I am
beginning to gets chips and nicks in my new paint on the rear fender flares
and want to protect the paint, but I don not want to use the black stone
guards, I would like clear ones.  Is there any alternative method to 
prtotect the paint such as clear contact paper or some type of transparent
adhesive which I could cut to the shape of the factory black stone guards
and stick in place?  Thanks.

Also, the front struts of my 911 are being replaced today by my repair shop.
Last week, they had me bring in the car to get the part numbers of the struts
so they could order them ahead of time.  I have a 1981 European 911SC.  The
shop told me that it was a good thing they checked the part numbers because
I have a special upgraded suspension option on this car (I bought the car
used), and that the struts used were not the standard ones.  What is/was the
upgraded suspension option on an '81 Euro-911SC?  Is it just becuase it is
a Euro model?  Once a mechanic told me my Euro-911 has more horsepower
too.  How can I find out the differences in my car (besides the only notice-
able one - the side marker lights), from the straight, no-option, US model, 
factory 911?

Has anyone had a good experience with A/C service in greater Boston?
If yes, where?? 
   How much did it cost and what was done? 
   Was it on a 911? (Are they different/harder to service than other cars?)

I got a quote for $150 to recharge with freon and check for leaks. Seems like

Hey, that goes on. You can buy drills, drill motors, a vise, a garage to

I semi-disagree.  A caterham Super 7 was my first choice (or a decent

price range that hadn't been at the bottom of a pond for a decade.
Perhaps it's my British upbringing, but doing 100mph where you are
eyeball level with the hub caps of the truck next to you, and where
you can trim your nails by hanging your hand over the door onto the
road is FUN.  However, my '82 911 is AFFORDABLE FUN !! (plus I don't
*Need* to wear a helmet when I drive it).  I'm not sure I agree with
you other statement about the car being worthless without the right
service stamps.  It depends on who the market it.  For example would
you buy a Porsche off Stan even if it hadn't been in a dealer for
a decade.  I'll bet Stan knows how to adjust valve clearances (even
if he doesn't do it).  If your potential buyer knows the car, knows
what to look for, and you impress that person enough with your
knowledge, perhaps show every receipt you have for parts etc it
shouldn't effect the value too much.

The next morning I threw by bags in the trunk, hopped in and fired it up.
OH NO! What's that knocking in the engine! It sounds like a rod about to
let got! Every time I rev it up the knock gets louder.
I was fortunate to find a Porsche dealer with service available very early
on a Saturda morningy.
I described the noise to the mechanic, he opened the engine cover and said:
"Rev it up a little,", I did.
He reached in and tightened the oil filler cap which I had left loose, and
was bouncing and knocking as internal engine pressure escaped past it.
Slightly red-faced, but very grateful, I thanked him and was on my way.

I finally checked the parts manual and Lee's probably right,
although the book doesn't list the part as being specifically for 
a right-hand-drive car. Porsche sold both right and left arm rests 
with and without a handle. The part numbers are:

    Arm Rest Left, without handle   901.555.041.25
    Arm Rest Left, with handle      901.555.041.23

    Arm Rest Right, without handle  901.555.042.25
    Arm Rest Right, with handle     901.555.042.23

I'm not sure if the parts are still available, but I hope this
helps. (seems like a handle on the driver's door would get in

Subject: request for opinions on a 914


I'm a newbie to this list who's been lurking for a coupla weeks, and I'm
looking for some opinions/helpful suggestions in regards to a '75 Porsche 914
2.0L.  My father currently owns it.  He bought it (after getting rid of the
motorcycle, he's getting older) and fixed it up (it'd been backed into), it's
in very good condition, but not pristine, runs quite well, has around 60,000
(original?) miles, is silver, rides pretty decent, stiff, a REAL nice car.

Now, I know that it's not the most practical car in the world, but it breaks my
heart to have this car leave the family.  He's willing to sell it to me for
what he put into it ($3500... that' reasonable, isn't it?), which I think is
pretty good.  But, before I really really consider buying it, I'd like to hear
from some other owners of 914's of their experiences, and perhaps answer some
questions (Stan has already given me quite a bit to chew on, and I'd like to
add some other opinions for consideration).  So, here they are.

 -  is security a BIG issue?  I live in Wash DC, and don't think I'd want it in
the city anyways.  But, are they a hot commodity for car thefts?  Is a car
alarm a given?  More important, should I lie awake at night, worrying....???

 - the $$ on upkeep?  Are they pretty reliable (engine-wise)?  Are they like
older Harleys, where every rider becomes their own mechanic? (stan indicated
that there could be emission problems)

 - Is this practical as an only car? (I bike alot, don't drive much right now
anyway)

 - can I assume that the value would only go up?  (this is a sidebar, since I
would not buy it for the money, but for the Joy of it... )

That's it for now.  Hope these are half-way decent questions.  Any and all
opinions appreciated, even unsolicited ones.  -Greg

Yum! roast gullwing.  Bring the barbeque sause.  It is generally a bad
idea to operate injectors outside of their intended resting places
(manifold, test bench, etc.).  The potential for error and bodily harm
is high.  Be prepared for fire or explosion.  Vaporized gasoline is
volatile enough to flash in contact with a hot engine.

Additionally, never test an injector against your or someone else's
skin (e.g. your thumb).  The velocity of the atomized stream coming
from an injector is high enough to force fuel through the skin and
into the blood stream.  Introducing petroleum distillates into the
bloodstream is considered a Bad Thing.

Subject: Tire Sizes for 912s and 356s


My $.02 on tire sizes. A person can, theoretically, make an early 912
look like a 930, wheels, tires, fenders and all. Everyone forgets that 
an increase in rolling tire cross-section adds load to the engine, 
therefore reducing ultimate terminal velocity.

Many of the early cars came with 155mm and 165mm cross-section tires
with a tire height of about 24 inches, all somewhere beyond an 80 series casing height. We all discovered that there is a ratio where gearing and
cornering attributes can cut into the real performance of your car.

I'd use 24 inches as the maximum inflated, installed on your car, tire 
height for a 356 or 912, given your gearing. I'd also run either 
185/60 or 195/55 cross-section to get the maximum stickum and least 
rolling tire resistance. Radials, of course.

What I have is one key that fits the ignition and the passenger door only.  It
does not lock/unlock the drivers door, trunk or glovebox.  The second key I havefits the drivers door only and nothing else. 

Anyone have a theory on what happened?  I'm trying to find out if any of the

Although this is not strictly a Porsche topic, I thought I would query

I am confused about air bags.  I was under the impression that they are 
"passive" safety
devices, designed to offer protection to individuals who are not 
wearing lap and shoulder
belts for some reason.  However, if you are wearing your safety belts, 
does an air bag
offer any additional protection?  I suppose there would be some 
protection from flying
debris such as broken glass.  What other protection would they offer?

I ask because I saw a race car fitted with an air bag on its steering 
wheel.  The crew
chief said they were considering a side impact bag as well.  This is in 
addition to a
roll cage, racing seat, 6 point harness, and helmet with face shield 
(and perhaps a
neck roll).

Are we going to be seeing air bags used increasingly on race cars?

Puzzled,

Subject: should I bleed the clutch?

PorschePhiles,

Is it recommended to bleed the clutch when replacing the brake fluid?
I'm about to do this (flush the fluid) on my '88 944. The fluid seems to
be somewhat dirty.
I've read that a bleeder kit (ie. eeze-bleed) facilitates this procedure. 
Assuming that the eeze-bleed kit is available, should I go ahead and
do the clutch? What should be the order, brakes first, then clutch?
Do I still have to jack the back of the car as high as possible - when
bleeding the clutch?

Thanks in advance for your help.

A joint purchase sounds good in theory but I have some reservations.  What if
someone doesn't forward it to the next user in a timely fashion?  
Policing would
be difficult.  Also, I don't know how sensitive this tool is to 
jarring, but there is
the possibility of its accuracy being affected by repeated shipping.  I 
guess this
would be mitigated to some extent by recalibrating with the calibration 
plate it
comes with.

Regarding the following questions:

|
| Hi all. Sorry I haven't been able to get back regarding the status of the 944
| cam and balance shaft tension tool pool.<stuff deleted> In any case, 
we need to decide how to
| organise this:
|
| 1. Who will take the money and buy the tool ?

I'd be happy to (that way I would get first crack at it, and I need it 
*NOW* since my
new belts already have over 2k miles on them).  BTW, I had the dealer do the
initial tensioning ($60.00, brought in with cover already removed).

| 2. How will we work the schedule in terms of who gets it when ?

lottery?  bribes? ;-)

| 3. How should it be transported ?

Carefully.  I don't know what sort of case it comes in, but I could
build a foam-filled wooden box for shipping.  I am not sure what shipper
would give it the most care in handling.  Perhaps UPS Blue Label...

| 4. Where do we get the tool ? I have been told that there is a difference
| between the gauges (ie. the one at Joe Discount's may work like shit - but at
| the same time, we don't want to have to buy it through Automotion unless we
| have to ...)

I can get it at the local Porsche dealer (Barrier Motors) for what Automotion
wants (> $500).  If anyone knows of a less expensive source, please speak
up.  Seems someone could get it in Germany for considerably less...

| Any ideas on the above would be great. Although I kind of started this idea,
| if there is anyone who feels they want to co-ordinate things that's fine - my
| life is quite hectic right now so if I do it, things may go a bit slow for
| everyone else's liking.
|
| So far I have been contacted by these members for this "club":
|
| l.tolhurst@genie.geis.com
| husain@zeus1.issc.com
| moodie@think.com
|
| If anyone else is interested, that's great, just drop us a line! I think we
| should probably limit the "membership" to 10 or less members (we probably
| won't get many more than that anyways - if that).

Tentatively count me in (ericb@microsoft.com).  I already have an appointment
at the dealer to have the retensioning done next week, so time is of 
the essence.
I may be interested in making the investment even if I do have the work done
by the dealer next week...

The thin wrench for holding the eccentric and the curved feeler gauge for the
idler clearance should also be purchased (I've got the part numbers at home).

I can relate to that.  If if has one line from the center tunnel going into
it and one line coming out that splits into two immediately it is the brake
proportioning valve.  From what I am told this is one of components in your
brake that can easily cause spongy brakes (expect for bad rubber lines and
old fluid, of course).

Wow - finally a question that I (think) I can answer.

All the info I have says this is true.  Personal experience confirmed it for 
me with my own cars combined with info I received from a 1-day 
high-performance driving course I took with members of a (sorry) Ferrari 
club.  My step-uncle used to race sprint cars and believes this as well.  A 
book I have on designing cars implies this also..."Race cars with an aft CG 
location and higher power require very high adhesion on the rear tires for 
traction under acceleration and for high speed cornering ability.  Therefore, 
their rear tires are made of soft, sticky material and are quite wide on wide 
rims, to achieve high cornering forces as well as acceleration without wheel 
spin...High performance vehicles frequently have larger or wider tires on the 
rear to increase adhesion there for greater traction and higher cornering 
forces.  This goes with an aft CG location."

One more source is an article in Road and Track magazine....many years ago. 
(April, 1969).  One of the engineer's conclusions was that tire tread width 
and lateral "g" forces tend to increase together.  Another conclusion was 
that tread width is more important than contact patch unit loading [pounds 
per square inch of contact patch] in obtaining higher "g" forces [tested 
on dry pavement].

>The big "All else" that concerns me especially is tire pressure.

I'm not sure about the rest of the tire pressure stuff, but here is what I've 
read:

"Tire pressure differences, front to rear, may be used to assist in 
improving handling and cornering, but this method has its limits.  First, do 
all that can be done by other means such as anti-roll bars, front and/or 
rear, tire and rim widths, and center of gravity improvements.
    Tire pressure influences the slip angle by changing the elastic action of 
the tire.  A soft tire will require a greater slip angle for the same lateral 
force and cannot generate as much "g" force as when inflated to a higher 
pressure."

The author goes on to say that you shouldn't change the pressure more than 
+/- 4 psi from the manufacturer's recommendations and that this method should 
be used to "fine tune" your handling if regular shock, tire, springs etc 
still need a little help if your car will tend to slightly understeer or 
oversteer.

This may also explain how some people think that smaller sidewalls on tires 
make your car handle better.  This is somewhat true....but the slip angle 
differences caused by softer (sometimes taller) sidewalls and how they affect 
the cornering ability of a tire are dwarfed by the benefits of a wider tire.  
A wider tire is a key component in getting better handling and sidewall flex 
is a "fine tuning" issue.

Subject: 356 T6 fuel tank collar

Hi, Al Sullivan and Michael Hodos.
 
OK, here it is. I looked at my un-diddled-with formerly one owner (little
old lady from Glendale) car today. Judging by the amount of dirt in the
metal drain channel inside the grommet, the tank has never been out.
 
The grommet mounts from the underside, so I'm afraid you'll have to take the
tank out, put the grommet on the filler neck, then reinstall. The wide end
of the grommet butts up against the underside of the fuel filler pocket in
the fender, and forms a sort of seal there. The rectangular section sheet
metal drain channel is located inside the grommet to allow spillage to drain
out. The channel mounts with the open end up, toward the filler neck.
There is also another drain hole forward of the neck, with a drain
hose. (Apparently they were real concerned about draining away fuel.) The
hose clamp goes on the bottom, narrow end of the grommet, and holds grommet
and drain channel to the neck.
 
A word to those who have original cars (this means you, Bob): it might be
a good idea to clear the dirt out of the drain channel. Use a small stiff
wire, such as maybe telephone wire (the small single-conductor stuff used in
your phone line), push it into the channel from the underside (inside the
fender) to poke dirt out into the fuel filler pocket. Once every 30 years
isn't that much to ask.
 
Question to Bob, Al, and Michael: do the gas tanks of your cars have a tar
paper like vibration damping material glued to the top? You will have to
lift the vacuum-formed trunk liner to see it. Most C cars seem to have this,
but the little old lady car has no sound deadener glued to it, nor any
evidence that it was scraped off. The tank is light gray. Comments?

A good place to start is the little "Technical Specifications" booklets that

I would make an attempt to try double clutching on the upshift.  I do it
occasionally in my 911 with good results.  I'm not sure why you feel
it is not an option - in alot of *large* trucks it is mandatory.

The coefficient of friction probably changes very little with increasing
normal forces.  What does increase is the force reacting the friction
force (remember F=mu*N, where mu is the coefficient of friction).  Hence,
downforce is a neat thing.  I read somewhere in a very sanitary technical
reference book that vehicle tires generally exhibit a mu of about .8 or so.
Using this number is difficult to acheive astounding lateral acceleration
numbers, so I suspect that the behavior of a tire at the limits of adhesion
isn't quite as simple as F=mu*N.

Could it be the rear brake proportioning valve.  This valve limits
the pressure to the rear brakes.  Try following the metal lines
and see if they lead towards the wheels or towards the engine.

No offense taken.  What I refered to as wasted bandwidth was discussion of what 
category of *Proschephile* one might be (*characterization*), based upon the

For the DC area (I live in Falls Church, VA - within the beltway) I would

price.

Well.  I have been driving my 75 1.8L around without the roof on.  All
I do is put on the a steering wheel lock and be careful where I park.
But I don't go _into_ DC.  This is all in the Vienna/Tysons/Falls Church
area where things are pretty (relatively) safe.  The 914s don't have alot
of aftermarket demand - so unless someone decides that they want 
_your_ car you should be safe.

Mine has been very reliable, but has required a fair amount of time
to keep going, but then I got it in pretty sorry shape.  Stan is correct
about the emmission.  You didn't mention it, but I hope the car still
has the FI -otherwise deduct 500-1000 from the price.  I am certainly
my own mechanic, but then I race cars and have 4 914s (and I enjoy it!)

I try to use mine as a daily driver as much as possible.  My single

Porbably, but that is a long term item.  All the 2.0Ls have been popular,
the 73 is the most popular, then the 74, and ...  I doubt that it
will depreciate much further, YMMV.

Along the thread of "embarassing moments", it was shortly after I bought
my new 914.  I pulled in to a full service gas station (remember those?)
I had some pump jock try to tell me that that quart of oil went through that
funny plug in the middle of the engine. Despite my best efforts to dissuade
him, he put the quart of oil there.  (Yes, it's the plug that covers the 
timing marks!)

Anyway, I called the regional headquarters and raised hell.  He was quite
apologetic the next time I came in!  (So, I guess it wasn't embarrassing
to ME, but maybe to him....)

Just wish that they had marked the oil filler spout when they designed

Subject: Spongy brakes

Hi, Barry.
 
The spongy brakes are probably unrelated to the recent pad change. It just
happened. How old is the brake fluid? Porsche recommended replacing every 2
years, now every 3 years with the new DOT 4-200 fluid.
 
Brake fluid, like oil and wax, is an item of religious significance, but if
you drive the car hard (on tracks; can't drive hard enough on roads to
matter) I would recommend flushing the entire system and using one of the
new fluids. ATE (Teves) makes one, Pentosin makes another, both with high
boiling points. They are non-silicone and miscible with the old DOT 4 fluid
you have. Friends in the brake business tell me those two new fluids are OK,
but they prefer something cheaper and even easier to get -- Ford Heavy Duty
brake fluid. It was designed not to boil even in a Lincoln Continental
driven by a little old lady who rides the brakes all day. Do not under any
circumstances use silicone fluid.
 
Brake bleeding is something simple that you can do yourself. All you need is
some clear vinyl hose (hardware store, maybe 2 ft.) to fit on the bleed
nipples (1/8? 1/4? have to check), a glass jar, a wrench
to fit the bleed nipples, and a friend to press the pedal on cue. I'm not
going to go into the whole procedure to spare the rest of the thread, but
it's really very simple and takes only a few minutes. If you don't have a
manual, let me know and I'll post that privately.

To keep a balance, one business I would recommend to owners of 356's and
early 911's is Gary Emory's Parts Obsolete.  Gary is very knowledgeable
about the cars, and often can supply used or substitute parts when
appropriate.  His prices are usually competitive, but the main thing I
like about dealing with him is that from my experience, he really cares
about his customers, will only sell you what you need, and if he doesn't
have it will tell you where to find it. 

Gary recently relocated his business from Costa Mesa to a 51 acre farm in 
McMinnville, OR where he sells parts, builds fun cars (see a recent

    Thanks for all the replies!  I'm forwarding Jim Pasha's note, since

- --DD

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Dave,

That is the brake proportioning valve. It may be adjusted (providing it 
isn`t badly corroded). Out to increase rear bias, in to reduce rear bias.

When you bleed the brakes, bleed all corners, drive the car, then bleed
the valve by pumping up the brakes, loosen the output line, then tighten.
Then do the same to the input side. 

Many 914s with a spongy brake feel have air trapped in the valve, this 
will get most of it out of the system. Check for any fluid seepage, any
leakage from the adjustment nut area indicates the unit is bad and MUST 
be replaced.

DO NOt, under any circumstance, run a 914 WITHOUT a rear proportioning 
valve. The brake bias will lock the rears almost immediately. A Kelsey-
Hayes (GM, Ford or Chrysler) proportioning valve will work, though you 
will need to order one with metric fittings.

You can put this out on the net  if you want.

1. why do the V-1 folks believe the directional arrows are important?

2. one person responding indicated a difficulty fitting the V-1 above the

"Traction" is what this cornering ( and braking ) force business is all about.  
To ( over ) simplify somewhat, "Traction" is the product of the coefficient of 
friction multiplied by the *total* force perpendicular to the two surfaces, 
multiplied by the area upon which the forces act (the *total actual* contact 
patch).

If you visualize this, you can see that air pressure affects the area of the 
contact patch.  The hardness/softness of the compound affects the coefficient of
friction of the (tire/road) contact patch.  So does heat, regardless of source.

Aerodynamic forces (lift or down-force) affect the either or both, depending, of
the total force applied perpendicular to the contact patch, or the total area of
the contact patch.  So do each of the "all else" factors mentioned in the 
original posting.  There, that was easy, wasn't it...;-)

     I just walked out and checked the filler collar and tank.
Mine doesn't have the drain "channel" you are talking about.  The
collar is sitting loosly around the filler, and has a hole wihich
roughly lines up with the drain hole in the fender.  The tank has
no padding material on top.  I would guess my car is a poor
reference in this case.  The tank MAY have been replaced, and
improperly installed in the filler area.

     Although the car is "1-owner", there was a divorce during
which the ex had the car and crashed it.  Looks to me like a
little body repair in the vicinity of the filler. Perhaps the
neck was bent, requiring tank replacement.

     I have lightly sanded the very rough paint.  This reveals
imperfect repairs that weren"t obvious  before.  I've always
known that you never really know your car's body, until you've
polished it.  I went through this exercise not to make it pretty
(the paint is beyond that), but to really discover the problems.

     BTW, I hear a lot about "original" miles when refering to
the amount of usage on a vehicle.  How do I tell whether my
105,000 are "original" miles, or second-hand miles?  ;-)

Kevin G. has already summarized some precautions . .  The hot ticket now seems
to spraying the compartment with a relatively undiluted solution of Simple

rinsing with water (high pressure sprayer or garden house).  Compressed air
does a nice job of removing the majority of moisture after washing.  Then towel
dry with unused cotton diapers (just kidding folks, actually any type of
cotton towel will do - (now I'm REALLY kidding)).

There are/were waxes that you add to water and then spray on. These are/were
probably worthless, but who knows in this age of miracles, so you might give 
one a try if you actually want to wax your engine compartment.

Welcome to the club!  My 84 911 seller gave me about 8 keys.  But, he'd 
owned a 911SC before, so some of the keys actually did nothing.  The keys 
I have that do work ONLY work on the driver's side door and ignition.  
This includes the key with the light in it and a key with a very small 
black top on it.  The red key I got was evidently from the SC along with 
a bunch of others.  I think the first owner (I'm the third) had the 
drivers lock and ignition changed but forgot about the passenger door, 
glove box and boot release.  Eventually, I will probably have the latter 
locks re-keyed to match the ignition and driver's door.

Hi Doug,

Thankyou for the response. I think it's a good suggestion. I hadn't thought
of playing this one out with the factory guy who is generally around at
those clinics. Maybe I was trying to justify the money that George and
Betty spent to send me to engineer school by coming up with an intuitively
satisfying reason why this car, and some fellow p'phile's 944s, required a
fraction of a beat between up-shifts. In the case of my car this isn't a
wearout condition; it's been so ever since it was new. 

It seemed to me that during an up shift (and a down shift for that matter)
the output side of the transmission continues at constant RPMs because its
connected to the drive wheels which cease accelerating the moment you
depress the clutch. The input side HAS to change RPM during the shift
because it will soon be connected to a slower rotating engine. At the end
of the day there are really only two ways that the necessary rev matching
can occur in an up shift. In general, both mechanisms are contributing to
some extent. 

1) All the rotating stuff on the input side coasts down in speed from what
it was doing just prior to the start of the shift (this is the justifiably
famous  'lift-your-right-foot-and-pause-a-half-a-beat' mechanism) or, 

2) The syncros directly cause and/or enhance the slow down by initiating a
slip-grip on a tooth-free portion of input gear cluster followed by some
generous tooth lead-in angles just prior to actual engagement of the next
gear. When they cause this slow down they are working on *all* the rotating
stuff that's attached to the input side, including that pesky driveshaft on
the 944. 

So the notion that, with the 944 layout, the syncros are required to slow

Subject:  Proportioning valves

All this talk about proportioning valves has me wondering...just how does the
proportioning valve work? Does the ratio of fore/aft line pressure vary in
accordance with the pressure in the master cylinder or should it be constant?

The reason I ask is that the results of my high tech brake test this year are
different than last year. Last year I had 115% front, 75% rear. This year the
results were 125% front and 60% rear. I noticed that there was even less
braking in the rear when the test driver didn't get up enough speed. In one
test the driver was barely moving when he hit the brakes and the right rear
measured 0%!

Should one hook up a pressure gauge to the lines at the wheels to check this
sort of thing? If so, where can I find recommended parameters?

  Dylan, greetings.

  I've got an idea that the repair material used to 'patch' breaks in 
windscreen defroster circuits might work for this application.
  The stuff is a conductive epoxy..just smear it on and let it harden.
  Be sure to insert the end of the wire into the goo before it cures
so the connection is made to the radio.  I might also suggest you
secure the wire nearby the junction so it wont break from vibration
and shock.

  You should be able to find this material at any generic auto supply shop.
  Dunno what the name or vendor is.  Just ask for 'defroster repair kit'.
  It might set you back $5...

I was the one who did the embarking on the friction topic.  My statement
concerning the non-constant friction coefficient originally comes from
reading that same "fact" somewhere.  Real authoritative, huh?  It does
hold up, however, upon reflection on the behavior of anti-roll bars.

Ponder this:

Common behavior in most vehicles is that if you increase the anti-roll-bar
stiffness at one end of the car, the other end will have more cornering
traction.  Why is that?  My understanding of the issue (which could be
wrong!) is that this behavior is due to the varying of friction coefficient
with normal force.  It works like this:

Let's assume the perfect skidpad car:  long wheelbase, 50/50 F/R
weight balance, midengine (for low polar moment), balanced anti-roll
bars for neutral steer.  Let's say that at the limit of adhesion, 20% of
the weight has transferred to the outside tires -- inside tires each have
say 400 lb. and outside tires each have 600 lb. (car weighs 2000 lb.).

Increase the front anti-roll bar stiffness and decrease the stiffness
of the rear anti-roll bar by an amount that will keep the overall roll
of the car the same (gotta keep all else equal!).  The car will now
UNDERSTEER (I know I'm not wrong, here, since every racer knows this!).

The question is:  Why?

Let's say that after our change, the front has 
now transferred 150 lb to the outside due to the stiffer bar 
(350 lb. inside tire/650 lb. outside tire) and the rear transfer is 50 lb.
(450 in/550 out).  We still have the same front/rear weight balance, so
the centrifugal (centripetal?) force at each end hasn't changed.  If the
friction coefficient were a constant with normal force, the car should
remain neutral since the total normal force at each end has not changed.

This behavior can only (I think!) be explained with my original 
statement that the friction coefficient increases with decreasing normal
force.  That outside front tire asked to carry 650 lb. is operating at
a lower coefficient of friction than the outside rear tire at 550 lb.

Let's assume that at 500 lb. load, the coeff. of friction is .8 and that
there is a change of .02 for each 50 lb. change in load.  The friction
forces of our understeering car would be:

             Front               vs.               Rear
   (650 x .74) + (350 x .86)     vs.     (550 x .78) + (450 x .82)
       481     +     301                     429     +     369
	      782                                   798

If all the assumptions were correct, it is clear that the car would under-
steer since there is now more traction at the rear than at the front.
Maybe this is wrong, but I don't think so!

Anyway, my original question remains:
Why does the shape of a constant area contact patch affect traction?

Mike Kohlbrenner
<kohlbren@hpancma.an.hp.com>

p.s.  The reason downforce is so wonderful is that you can increase
your traction with extra normal force without adding weight to the
car.  If my "rule" is correct, you will be operating at a lower
coefficient of friction, but not enough lower that it isn't worth it.
The drawback, of course, is increased drag.

Subject: Re: 944 Antenna Disaster - Can it be fixed?

How about going to radio shack, getting some 30 ga wire wrapping wire
(real thin stuff) and repairing the broken portion with a soldering iron?
I am speaking from an electrical point of view and know nothing about
paint, glass, or the wisdom of doing enough scraping to get to the wires.

Another option might be a on glass mounted antenna. Your local cb/scanner/
cellphone place might have some scanner antennas like this. Those will wok
with the FM radio (FM is 88-108 Mhz and the scanners typically tune
50-1000 Mhz ). The idea of a glass mount is that you glue the outside
on the glass, and a piece inside , and the radio waves go through the 
joint without wires or any physical connection. 

Winshield antennas are NOT a good design. They are directional with gain
to the front/rear and loss to the sides. Thus as you turn the car you may
lose stations. They seemed to be popuilar on lots of cars for a while.
My Dads oldsmobile had them.

For the most part when you get a car receiving antenna you are buying 
looks and features (motorized) and not necessarily performance. In 
general the longer the better, but there are certain lengths that
are magical (0.25 wavelengths, 5/8 wavelengths , etc... ) because that
means you have a resonant antenna. 

I have some ham radio transmitting stuff in my car, and went with the glass mount. 
Now, these antennas require half a brain when it comes to design as something
handling 25-50W needs to be tuned and impendance matched while a receiving
antenna need not. It cost $89, and thats high because the glass mount
commands a little premium. Somehow I bet my FM vertical in the front of the
car costs more.....not because its better but because its Porsche.

Here's another thought. Do you have a black cap on your hatchback that
attaches from below with a nut? Its on the drivers side near the bottom.
I think its for the optional rear wipers. You could remove that and mount
some type of antenna for another easy solution.

Occam's Razor sez that you had the driver's side door handle replaced and
someone lost the "real" key leaving you with only the valet key and
the new door key.

I do not know of what the decoding between the valet and "real" key is.
Nor do I know of anyone who does know (BTW -- if anyone *DOES* know this,
please get in touch, OK?).

The best fix is to get the roughly $200 "Targa re-key set" from Porsche
that has all the right locks and keys, new.  Details on that are in the
archives, twice -- once in '90 and once in the last year when I looked
this up for someone else.

The cheapest fix is to take off both of the door handles, and the
glove box lock. Take these into the locksmith (I've got one in
Houston and Pete Albrecht has one in SoCal that can do this, by
extension there should be others) and have the odd door re-keyed to
exactly match the other door, and then devise a key that unlocks
the glovebox *AND* the "good" door for your new "master" key.

BTW, I'd *LOVE* to have a working valet key -- hang onto that sucker!

Eric,

'87 and '88 944S are very much the same car.  The changes were few.  I
think the most important one were:

 a) DME diagnostic port, introduced during MY87, and
 b) oil level sender, also introduced pretty early during MY87.

For some reason, Porsche increased the nominal oil capacity of the
car for MY88, although I have never heard any reason why this
should have been.  They didn't change the sump until the 944S2.

Sport suspension bits and M030 were definitely available, although I
have never seen an M030 car except for the Firehawkers.  The M030
included the same stuff as the 944 Turbo M030, including 8" and 9"
wheels.  I think it included the 944 Turbo brakes.

The 944 Turbo brakes are four-piston at each calliper, front and rear.
The piston sizes were changed a number of time during the car's
lifetime, and were used on the 944S2.  The "Turbo S" brakes were a
different matter.  The 944 and 944S share the same 928 single-piston,
floating calliper brakes, although Porsche upgraded the OEM pad
compound with the introduction of the 944S.

Well, Candlestick blew it and gave away our date on the 23rd to the Muni Bus
Rodeo.  Fortunately, at the same time, Hamilton offered us that weekend.  So,
moving the event on the 23rd was a no-brainer.  Problem is that if we also
move the 24th, then we don't share our sites with GGR, which means they
don't give us the 31st at Oakland.  Well, the 31st at Hamilton is also

The shields protect the brakes from debris.  It is not uncommon for

great things for any parts concerned.

The claim that inside pads wear twice as fast as outside is nonsense.
Slight differences (and I mean slight) in wear, inner to outer, are
due not to heat, but to the car's tendency to toe-out under braking.
There is also something called "taper wear," and I posted a long

If you are having a problem with temps, the right solution is a brake

Subject: Re: tire question--general

Mike,

Probably the best answer to your questions would be a recommendation
to go read Fred Puhn's "How to Make Your Car Handle."  I've read it
twice, and it is pretty much the bible on matters of basic suspension
stuff, including tires.

The short, direct answer to your questions is that, yes, contact patch
size dominates adhesion both in propelling the car ahead and in
cornering.  And a larger tire simply makes a larger contact patch.  Of
course, a larger tire also generates more rolling and air resistence,
and it works against comfort too.

(A larger rim, width or diameter, also weighs more and will suck up
more horsepower.  The energy turned into rotational energy ain't
available for straight-line kinetics.)

We tune tire pressures and suspension camber using a pyrometer looking
for values which give, as much as possible, even heating across the
width of the tread.  This indicates that the contact patch is as big
as possible, and so our tires are working to their limit.

Sidewall stiffness (and height) affects contact patch change during
cornering.  More stiffness means less deflection, less contact patch
change, and so less loss of adhesion and a more stable and predictable
car.

There isn't really any correlation between tire pressure and rim
width.  We run about the same pressure in our race car's rear 12" rims
as I do in my street car's front 7" rims, when we use the same tires.

Hope this helps.  Read Puhn.

Yes, bleeding your clutch once a year will prolong its existence.  By
doing so, you will eliminate crud which can ruin seals.  You absolutely
need a positive-pressure power bleeder to do it, like the Eezi-Bleed.

On the other hand, if you have a car whose clutch has not been bled in
years, you are likely better off leaving sleeping dogs lie.  The risk is
that by bleeding it now, you will move crud to where it will indeed
ruin a seal.

There is one exception to this: there is a common mod to 914s that
involves using BMW 320i front brake calipers. If you make that
change (which gives you more swept area and clamping force than a
911S caliper, BTW) then you have to either chunk the prop valve
or adjust it to all the way open (i.e. no restriction).

I would assume that the same applies to adding BremTek or Wilwood

If I had to guess, I'd say that you are unlikely to find that you've

made some mistake and that your front bearings are very loose.  This
will allow the rotor to wobble, which pushes back the brake pads as
the wheel turns.  That extra "knock back" means that you have to push
the brake pads further when you go to use them.

You don't have to crack the brake lines when replacing pads or bearings.
When doing bearings, you take the calliper off the spindle whole.

It's good that you want to learn how to bleed your brakes.  But I really
recommend that you have someone human *show* you how it's done, and
watch over your shoulder.  I sure did.  Death sucks.

Subject: Re: tire question--general

Mike,

Probably the best answer to your questions would be a recommendation
to go read Fred Puhn's "How to Make Your Car Handle."  I've read it
twice, and it is pretty much the bible on matters of basic suspension
stuff, including tires.

The short, direct answer to your questions is that, yes, contact patch
size dominates adhesion both in propelling the car ahead and in
cornering.  And a larger tire simply makes a larger contact patch.  Of
course, a larger tire also generates more rolling and air resistence,
and it works against comfort too.

(A larger rim, width or diameter, also weighs more and will suck up
more horsepower.  The energy turned into rotational energy ain't
available for straight-line kinetics.)

We tune tire pressures and suspension camber using a pyrometer looking
for values which give, as much as possible, even heating across the
width of the tread.  This indicates that the contact patch is as big
as possible, and so our tires are working to their limit.

Sidewall stiffness (and height) affects contact patch change during
cornering.  More stiffness means less deflection, less contact patch
change, and so less loss of adhesion and a more stable and predictable
car.

There isn't really any correlation between tire pressure and rim
width.  We run about the same pressure in our race car's rear 12" rims
as I do in my street car's front 7" rims, when we use the same tires.

Hope this helps.  Read Puhn.

If you want a decent car, the bodywork should be #1 priority.

You can replace the engine, trans.  Everything else is usually ok.

A decent paint job on a NICE body can cost $3K.  If it's been hit - you
coul dbe out the cost of the car.

Interiors are replaceable also, though a headliner is less than fun.

If you can afford it, get an SC (78-83).  The engines run forever and
they're realy gavanized (as opposed to the 76-77 cars which were
"kinda" galvanized and tend to rust.

Subject: Friction

Here is something straight out of "Marks Standard Handbook for
Mechanical Engineers" :

"Under moderate pressures, the frictional force is proportional to the
normal load on the rubbing surfaces.  It is independent of the pressure
per unit area of the surfaces.  The coefficient of friction is approximately
independent of the rubbing speed, when the speed is sufficiently low
so as not to affect the temperature of the surface; at higher velocities,
the coefficient of friction decreases as as the velocity increases."

Interesting.  It sounds like what is being said here is that the 
coefficient of friction decreases as *temperature* increases (as a
result of the increase "rubbing" velocity).  

Much to the chagrin of all of you, I'm going to look into this some more....

Me again.  Further reading revealed that the decrease in coefficient of
friction as velocity increases is due to a reduction in the amount of contact
of the two surfaces in question.  Basically, the faster a tire slips, the less
the little irregularities in the tire and pavement interact with each other
to provide the frictional forces.  I have found no evidence of the coefficient
of friction changing as a function of the normal forces.

I'll be quiet now.

Subject: Silicone Brake fluid

Pete recommended not using silicone brake fluid (Dot 5) and I'm wondering
why.  Silicone fluid is a bear to bleed to a firm pedal but it does not
abosorb water like glycol based fluids do (Dot 4 and Dot 3).  Moisture in
the brake fluid leads to internal corrosion problems as water also is
blessed with a higher density than brake fluid.  For those of use who drive
seasonally, 'wet' brake fluid in a car that's stationary for months on end
can well result in frozen calipers and internally corroded brake lines. 
For those who use their cars daily, the continual heating and cooling of
the fluid presumably results in some internal convective circulation and
moisutre venting to the atmosphere.  I'd like to hear about the negative
aspects of silicone fluid.

Here's a suggestion (it may be a dumb one).  The outside tires are travelling
a longer path than the inside tires (2 x 3.141592654 x distance between
inside and outside tire centers per 360 degrees) assuming no skid and a
constant radius turn.  Since each side of the car enters and exits the
turn at the same time (we sincerely hope so!) the outside tires are
forced to corner at a higher speed, this in turn translates to a higher
lateral acceleration (V^2/R) supported by the outside tires.  This means
with tires already operating at or near their limit of adhesion ...
Wait, what was my conclusion ?

Yes you did get scre---d!  The power antenna in my 83 944 was not working

lots of corrosion.  It did not seem repairable.  So I went to my friendly
neighbourhood Porsche mechanic who had replaced an antenna for a customer
who insisted it be replaced because it operated "slowly".  He gave me the
old antenna, I took it apart and it just needed a little cleaning and

I think a little more caution is in order ......
If you have a car that has not had a fluid change in many years the master 
cylinder (and wheel cylinders) have rust pits and rust.  Proper procedure
is to rebuild (including hone or polish of cylinders) or replace.  The
master cylinder on Porsche/VW  (I drive 356 cars) is particularly
suscepible to tearing of the rubber piston seal if it passes over the
rust pits.  Thus bleeding using the "hose in the jar and pump the pedal" 
technique is ill-advised because in the process the master cylinder
seal travels the full length of the cylinder even though in normal
use it only passes over a short length (and keeps it polished).  If one
insists on bleeding the system without rebuild then either the "pressure
in the reservoir" or "suck at the wheel" systems widely sold would
seem advisable.  Personally though I don't own one ... I believe in
rebuilding all cylinders (and lately going dual master cylinder on 356
cars).

they were in regular contact.  My spare key never wore down because it was
never in use.  After about 10 years of use, my regular key would work in
both the driver's side door and the ignition, but the original unused
(and unworn) key no longer would.  However, the unworn, spare key would 
still work in the passenger door and hood since those locks received
much less regular use.

	For some reason, both keys still work in the ignition.  Anyway, I'll

- ------------------------

Howdy guys and gals, hopefully someone can help me with this problem:

I need to replace the tires on the rear wheels of a 79 930. The wheels
(both front and rear) are 3 pieces BBS RACE type. I brought the car to
3 local shops, all of which said that they could not mount or dismount
the tire without disassembling the wheel. This is due to the RACE type
wheel which has no "drop center" (which prevents the "mount/dismount"
machine from removing/installing the tire). If the wheel is disassembled, 
a new set of bolts and seal ring have to be ordered from BBS. The old 
bolts and seal ring can not be reused. This will cost $130 per wheel. Yes,
that's correct, a flat repair on each wheel will cost $130+. The local
shops are not even sure if they want to do this, due to liability 
possibility.  They suggest sending the wheel/tire combination back to BBS.
Comment?

The only other possibility is to buy a "normal" set of wheels.

Does anyone happen to have a set of 8.5 x 15 and 11 x 15 (Or something 
equivalent) wheels for sale?

Does anyone want to buy a set of BBS RACE wheels ;-).

Many thanks!

    $3500 is a reasonable price for a 2.0L in good shape.  The 75-76 cars

    Good 914s can be reliable.  Good ones seem to be hard to find.  My
1.8L has been pretty bad, mostly because of previous owner (and now my)
neglect.  Just remember, it's a 20-year-old car, so budget some money

    I personally don't think a 914 does well as an only car.  But if you
have backup transportation--another car or your bike--you should be OK.

    914s seem to be holding their value or losing just a little bit over
the past three years.  I would guess that means the market is close to
bottoming out.  Of course, in five more years it may only be worth $50
more, but who cares?  As you say, driving it is the reason to own it.

Hi, Bob.
 
Most of the places that sell upholstery materials get it somewhere else.
Twinks doesn't do much themselves; they just order from a supplier and, if
you're lucky, stock the stuff. If you're not lucky they wait until they have
enough orders from you and everybody else to get an order together. I have
never, ever had good experiences buying from Twinks and won't ever order
from them again. So, you might as well go one step up the ladder and get the
stuff from somebody who supplies to the trade.
 
For original and good repro seat cover materials, try Putt Georgi Ltd., at
1-800-638-6380. They have lots of original or close repro Porsche materials.
This is the prime source for most Porsche and I think most European car
restoration upholstery.
 
Also Bill Hirsch, don't have number but try 800 directory and lots of big
full page ads in Hemmings.
 
Even Autos International has to get material from a much larger jobber. I am
pretty sure they get their carpeting from Putt Georgi. I don't know about
the vinyl. Leather is handled by large leather jobbers. I don't like
Connolly, but I don't know of anybody in the U.S. that handles the original
German Roser brand leather.

I have so far seen the results of three or four "street" accidents in
which airbags played a part, as well as countless ones without the
bags.  The answer is:  they are called passive restraints because no
driver action is required to "arm" them; this means nothing about
using them with belts or without.  I imagine we'll see more of them on
the street and on the track.

Observations:

* Drivers wearing seat belts can still be hurt badly or even killed in
  a major frontal impact.  This is because some important yet fragile
  parts of the body (ie head, neck, arms) are unrestrained and can be
  hit by objects or even snapped off by the acceleration of impact.
  (Hence the use of helmets and "donuts" even in enclosed cockpits.)

* Airbags fill this risk by "softening" the acceleration and the range
  of movement of the loose limbs in a frontal impact, and by buffering
  the driver from flying glass.

* Drivers without seatbelts but with airbags are missing the key part
  of the restraint system which keeps them properly positioned behind
  the airbag.  This is critical in "pinball" accidents where the car
  glances off one or more objects before hitting the wall, or the
  tree, or that southbound Peterbilt.  You're not strong enough to hold
  yourself behind the wheel when the car is playing marbles, and the
  bag won't help at all if you're no longer behind it.

* Bags offer no protection in accidents where the major impact is from
  the side.

* People wearing belts in car cars with bags can still end up with
  injuries, especially broken legs and feet from impact with the
  pedals... it is tough to even *imagine* how severe the accelerations
  can be in a bad accident.  People who drive truly become "numbed" to
  the sense of speed and momentum that driving gives.

* And finally, all the restraints are only as good as the integrity of
  the passenger compartment.  A guardrail coming through the dashboard
  really makes a mess of the seat...

>Congrats, Mr. Darling -- you just found your brake proportioning

>brakes right, of course...

With the recent mention of proportioning valves and (lack of) firm
brake pedals, let me describe how my 914's brakes feel.

Background:
     - 19 mm master cylinder installed
     - stainless steel brake hoses installed
     - all lines blown out with compressed air
     - system bled multiple times including tapping on the
       calipers to dislodge trapped bubbles
     - verified that the pedal assembly is bolted down tight

 As I depress the brake pedal, I feel a firm pedal with
increasing resistance - up to a point.  About halfway to the floor
the pedal suddenly changes to a springy feel with NO INCREASE
in braking force.  At the change-over point there is a clunk from
the firewall - the proportioning valve kicking in, right?  But
doesn't the p-valve only control the rear brakes?  I would expect
the front brakes to continue to grab tighter as I push the pedal
more.  Perhaps I still don't have all the air out of the front
brakes?  The car stops reasonable well, but it is not up to
the standards of other cars I have driven.  I certainly don't
have enough brakes to lock up the wheels.

If the problem is with the p-valve, can the factory valve be
adjusted or is replacement in order?  A couple of tech letters
from the Upfixin books talk about replacing the stock p-valve
with a Corvette unit, but don't mention the particulars.  A friend
of mine says he replaced his p-valve with an adjustable unit
from a place called Garrettson.  I haven't been able to find their
address or phone...  Automotion sells a "914 Racing Brake
Balancer" p-valve, but it is for 70-73 years only. (Mine is a 75).
The Automotion guy said that due to a redesign (of the shift
linkage?), it only fits the earlier models.

Thanks for any insight.  It would be nice to getting my brakes up
to regular standards!

Subject: 944 gearshifting, traction, 911 keys

I think the previous poster is right: the extra inertia of the driveshaft
slows down the gearshift. Which leads me to ask: why didn't Porsche also
move the clutch to the rear, as in other front engine/rear transmission
designs (I think Alfetta and Plymouth Tempest)? The advantages are decreased
inertia between clutch and gears, less torque on the driveshaft so it can be
lighter (as in the Tempest, where it was also curved!), and for earlier 944's,
less chance of coolant/oil on the clutch friction material.

On traction, and the supposed decrease in coefficient of friction with increasing
normal force: I don't think it necessarily decreases. The key point is that the
maximum lateral force is a concave (curving downwards) function of the normal
force in the relevant region. This could happen with the coeff. of friction
increasing as well as decreasing. There is a nice graph and explanation of this
in Colin Campbell's ``Sports Car Design and Performance.''

On 911 keys: I was always intrigued by the different shapes of the red and black keys,
with one trapezoid facing up and another facing down. I got a beautiful double
take from one of my son's friends when I asked him why they were designed like
this; when he couldn't figure out why, I told him it was for blind drivers ...
I guess it helps in the dark.

There was a time, 5+ years ago, when I graduated college as a Physics (and
Computer Science) Major when I could give you a well-explained answer to
this.  But Computer Science got me my career, and now I can't recall the
entire Inertial Physics details, just one lab experiment, here is why...

My answer, expained in an analogy:  Think of a 2"x4"x8ft. piece of wood,
laying on the ground (say in your driveway).  The surface area of the wood
in contact with the pavement (the contact patch) is some amount of sqaure
inches (4"wide x 96"long=384inches).  Now, imagine standing at one END 
(lengthwise) of the 2x4 and give it a constant push with your hand across
your driveway.  Not that hard to do right?  Right.  Now, try this, stand on 
one SIDE of the 2x4, at the midpoint (4ft from one end), and try to push
the 2x4 sideways.  It is hard to do, and takes MUCH more force than it did
to push it length wise.  But wait a minute?  How can this be?  The same 
amount of wood is in contact with the driveway at all times, in both of 
these scenarios?  Thus, the contact patch did not change at all, but the
amount of force required to make the 2x4 slide in one direction (lenghtwise)
was MUCH LESS than the amount of force required to make the 2x4 slide in
the other direction, (sideways).

Now, substitute the words 2x4 with "rectangular, or diamond shaped rubber 
block of a Porsche tire" in the text above, and you can see why the shape of
the contact patch touching the road affects traction.  Look at the tread
pattern of, as an example, my new Dunlop SP-8000's on my 911.  They are not
square, not even rectangle, but are shaped like this (only 2 drawn)
		     ___   ___
                    /  / | \  \
		   /__/  |  \__\

You are looking at the tire as it is drvining OVER your face, going UP the
page.  The line between them is center of tire.  Thus, the force needed
to break the tire free (sideways) in cornering, is greater because the force 
is exerted sideways (almost, not quite) on the tire, and these rubber blocks 
are like the 2x4's in your driveway.  To break free and start sliding, the 
inertia needed to overcome the coefficient of friction is greater in the
drection of sides of the tires.  Thus, the varying shapes of contact patches,
but all with the same amount of rubber on the raod, can change a tires (cars)
handling (sliding) characteristics.  

Hopes this helps.

___________________________________________________________

     On my '83 Targa,  the difference between the owner key and
the valet key, is an additional longitudinal groove in the owner
key.  The glove box and trunk tumblers have a "nerd" that slides
in this groove.  The valet key lacks the groove, and hence won't
slide into the tumblers.  The ignition tumbler doesn't have the
"nerd" and so will accept keys with or w/o the additional groove.
The bump pattern (I don't know the correct terminology) on the
owner and valet keys are the same.

     If your locksmith doesn't have valet key blanks, you could
modify an owner key by filling (solder or epoxy?) the additional
longitudinal groove, thus transforming the owner key to a valet
key.  In my case, the locksmith had both blank types, didn't know
the difference, and gave me valet keys the first time around, so
I have plenty of valet keys.

     I don't know if the lock type is the same between an '83 and
a '72.  Mine is longer than the average key, and has bumps on
both edges, so there is no "upside down" problem.

Subject: Re: Shifting

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your response to my comments on gear changing. You wrote the
following that has me wondering if we're in sync (no pun)

>I would make an attempt to try double clutching on the upshift. I do it
>occasionally in my 911 with good results.  I'm not sure why you feel
>it is not an option - in a lot of *large* trucks it is mandatory.

During both up-shifts and down-shifts there is a necessity to equalize the
RPMs of the two major gear clusters that comprise your transmission. If
they're not made, by some means or another, to be turning at the same speed
they will not go together. To determine if double clutching is appropriate
for either of the shift directions (up or down) its important first to
understand what the relative speeds of the input and output clusters during
each stage of the shift.

Let's take up-shifting 'cause that's what started all this and let's say
we're in one of the lower gears and about to make an up-shift. The entire
gear cluster on the input side is turning at the engine speed of, say 4000
RPM. The entire output side is turning at engine speed divided by the gear
ratio of the previously selected gear. Let's say the resulting number for
that stuff on the output side is 3200 RPM. Now lets jump over the
intermediate step for a moment to see what the speeds will be the instant
after we let out the clutch at the end of the shift into say, 4th gear
which has a 1:1 ratio. We know that the output side's speed is governed by
the fact that the road wheels are turning at about the same speed as they
were when the shift began since we stopped accelerating for the moment
during the shift. So that group of gears still will be at 3200 RPM at the
end of the shift. But the input side will also have to be at 3200 in order
for the new pair of gears to have engaged. So it has to have slowed down
from the 4000 it was doing at the start of the shift. That's all pretty
intuitive because we all know that the engine speed drops during an up
shift.

So now let's go back and look at what had to occur during that interval
that we jumped over, and see if double clutching is consistant with what
went on. During a typical double clutch one depresses the pedal, moves the
shifter to neutral, lets out the pedal, blips the throttle, depresses the
clutch pedal again (hence the 'double') and finally selects the next gear.
Well if you blip the throttle as I've described you'll have the input
cluster turning at a higher speed now which is the exact opposite of what
we just concluded would have to happen to those gears during an up-shift.  

So I contend that the only rational time for double clutching in either
Porsches or large trucks is as the DOWN-shift progresses and it's purpose
is to equalize the RPMs of the two gear clusters that are about to be
coupled together; specifically to increase the RPMs of the input or
engine-side gear cluster.

Just to avoid confusion, for a given tire pressure and normal force
on a particular tire, the overall area of the contact patch remains 
essentially constant. What all of the things Kevin discusses, like
suspension adjustment to achieve uniform pyrometer readings, etc. do
is change the shape of the contact patch. The discussion has already
touched on the fact that the coefficient of friction for the rubber-road
interface in fact decreases with increasing normal force (unlike
Physics 101, where it was constant). It seems to me that this should 
not only hold true for the overall tire, but for small sections of the
tire within the contact patch. Thus one way to look at it may be that
the trick is to get all parts of the contact patch to
have roughly equal normal force, and thus to maximize the average
coefficient of friction for a given total normal force. It would
seem that the uniform air pressure on the inside would go a long way
toward making this happen, but I guess that is what makes tire and
suspension design interesting.

Missing a shift in a 915 is, unfortunately, something that happens. 
Three people
I know have done it. All of them had short shift kits installed...tho 
one of them did
it again after removing the short shift. So I would recommend against 
the short shift.
Mike, you can swap your parts for the stock SC setup and new bushings, 
which will make
shifting a bit crisper.

Putting a 3.2 in your SC, Hugh, isn't a huge deal, but it is a fair 
amount of work. Whereas
another 3.0L will bolt right in, you'll need to wire in the harness and 
brain, put in a
fender Carrera cooler (it's there for a reason!), and fiddle with some 
other bits. Not
nearly as hard as bolting a 3.6L in, but just so you know, it could be 
$3K or more than
bolting in a 3.0L, plus the increased cost of the engine. My local 
mechanic who has done
a bunch of 3.2 conversions, hasn't done one for less than $9k, for what 
that's worth.
He'd charge you about 5-6k to rebuild yours, or about 6k to install a 
good, used 3.0L. All
these numbers are for just your reference - he's a great mechanic and 
I'd have him do mine,
but he isn't the cheapest.

3.0L motors, well taken care of, will easily go 200k miles, so you 
shouldn't feel your
100k example is necessarily used up. I'd say check your 
compression...but it's too late for
that now.

Putting in a G50 and the hydraulic clutch is a big deal. A friend of 
mine did it in his
930 (some guys in AZ did it, actually), and it cost $10-12k. Lots of 
work is involved, including
changing the whole rear suspension, since the G50 requires curved 
torsion tubs, bending the
sheet metal, and plumbing the hydraulics. The G50 is great to shift, 
but console yourself with
the knowledge that the 915 is a fine trans too, and much lighter!

Putting a 3.2 and G50 in your car might cost you as much as an early 
Carrera. Which would have
better resale.

Subject: wax on, wax off ....

I'd like to try waxing my 944 for the first time this year (gasp, will this 
revelation of abuse get me kicked off the list?), however I've never been 
satisfied with either the wax or the car after a week or the first rain.

My car is a difficult situation at best because it had (for some strange 
reason) been repainted from the doors forward by a previous owner.  Now, after 
years of sun abuse, the front half is "guards red" and the rear half is 
"guards orange" because of oxidation.

When I've waxed it before, the paint in the rear comes to life and returns to 
the beautiful red color matching the front.  But, after a rain or two and/or a 
week or so, the rear returns to its old color.

I have had the same results with a Turtle Wax brand "restorer" wax and a 
Meguirs(?) car cleaner liquid wax.

Is there another brand/type of wax that will be more lasting?  Am I using this 
stuff wrong?  What?

Javier, I bled the clutch on my '85 944 when I replaced the brake fluid.  I 
had to take off the starter to get to the clutch slave cylinder "drain thingy" 
because :

a.) it's tight in there around the clutch
b.) the "drain thingy" was slightly stripped

I had the front of the car jacked up and had pumped out as much fluid as I 
could by pumping the various pedals.  (WARNING: I'm not sure that this was the 
recommended procedure as I had a heck of a time getting all the air out of the 
clutch line later!!) .  I was able to get all the air out of the brake lines 
using the "buddy system", but I had to go get the "Mighty-Vac" (Walmart, $20) 
to get all the air out of the clutch line.  (Additionally, my wife had 
threatened to kill me or ram her leg with the "super-pumped" thigh right up my 
*&%$!)

I did however score a: 

Brake Fluid: VERY clean, but low

Subject: How do I lower my HC readings?

Smogged my car yesterday, after buying the MFI adustment tools from Performance
Products.  I adjusted the idle mixture 3 clicks leaner and went from 6.0%CO to 
4.41%CO, so I passed the CO requirement of 5.5%.  But the HC went from 1400ppm
to 1179ppm, 779ppm over the max limit of 400ppm.

I'm open to any suggestions on how to lower my HC reading.  I haven't adjusted 
the partial load screw yet, the tool supplied for this adjustment screw does
not fit into the hole in the MFI pump.  Can you believe that?

Another problem I'm having is adjusting my idle speed up to 900 from 600rpm
.  I've tried adjusting the six air bypass screw on the throttle bodies, but
there is no effect.  From 1 1/2 turns out to 3 turns my idle stays at 600rpms

Subject:       914 puzzler of the week

Hi all!  I'm looking for some advise on where to look next with a 
problem I'm having with my '74 2.0.

The symptom:
The engine develops a nasty miss / popping noise
during part throttle acceleration as the engine reaches maximum revs for a given 
throttle position. This typically occurs at around 3000 - 4000 rpm, 
for my typical shift points, but it follows the throttle position 
around when I try different shift points.  If I push the throttle 
down harder or let up the popping is reduced. If I run it at about 
4500-5000 rpm and just stay in the same gear the problem does not 
occur.

I have checked the ignition system from top to bottom and pretty much 
ruled it out. ( new points, condensor and timing adjustment. )

Then I checked the valve adjustment.

I then started checking the fuel system... Temp sensors I and II check
out ok and the throttle switch seems to check out ok.
( all three items were replaced about a year - year and a half ago.)

Fuel pressure checks out ok as well. ( 30lbs.)

I also did a compression test while I was at it....
#1 = 110lbs.
#2 = 110lbs.
#3 = 110lbs.
#4 = 120lbs.
The wet test showed no significant differences.
( looks like I should have done that valve job when I had the moter 
apart 2 years ago....)

At first I wasn't able to duplicate the problem without driving the 
car, but I then tried disconnecting the throttle switch, and now when 
I snap the throttle, I get the popping noise so it looks like the 
throttle switch is helping to mask the problem.

The only things left that I can think of are:
1 - Pressure Sensor
2 - Fuel injectors
3 - Burnt valve(s).

Is there any worldly wisdom out there to point me in the right 
direction? I've been trying to methodically track this thing down for 
a week and a half and I have reached my wits end.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Fuel injection..... Can't live with it, can't live without it.

Subject: Re:  Friction

How about considering the pressure distribution across the contact patch?
For the long skinny patch, the pressure appears to be higher in the
center, compared to the short wide patch. Since the coefficient of
friction in the real world is not constant, but goes down (less than
linearly) as the pressure goes up, you get more side force or traction
from the tire with the lower peak pressure.It doesn't look like an
enormous effect, but that could make a difference given the same tire
compound, contact patch size, etc. No question that with real tires,
on a real car, there IS a difference.

Dear 'philes:
Eric asked if airbags aren't for those not wearing belts, and if they do any
good if you are belted.  I'm no auto safety engineer, but a careful reader of
car literature and a physician who's seen a few bashed faces.  My thoughts:
yes, ABSOLUTELY air bags do good when you're belted.  Belts have slack,
stretch, etc., and may still let delicate parts of your bod contact hard
metal.  The air bag is that margin of safety that may leave you alive and
pretty enough for women other than your mother to think you're cute.  What
about protection by air bags if you aren't belted?  You may be thrown about
the car so violently as to slip around the bag.  Remember, the bag is only
inflated for milliseconds, and there may be secondary collisions to harm you
if you are floating around loose.  ALWAYS belt.  ALWAYS.  It is such a habit
that I find myself belting up to back the car out to park on the street.  I
think having air bags in race cars is a great idea if they can handle the
weight.  Sorry if I am preaching to the converted.

Tracy, you are quite simply wrong.  The M030 competition package is very
different from the sport suspension bits.  Go look at a fiche or read
the PCNA Fact Book for that model year.

With respect to sway bars, it was the *rear* bar which was an option, at
least initially for MY87.  With a rear bar you also got a larger front
bar.  If memory serves, the rear bar plus bigger front bar became
standard during the MY production.

Dear Panorama readers:

	Has any one besides me seen the BIG TYPO on page 7 of the current
Panorama?

It is the Porsche add with the yellow 993 that talks bout becomming a Porsche
test driver...

If you look closely, you can see that the new 993 has :

	"Improved ABS Breaking"

I bet it was checked with a word processor package and passed with flying
colors :)

BTW, a comment on the double-clutching thread. Back in '90, there was a very
lenghty discussion on up/down heel-and-toe shifting. I would recommend reading 
it. Has a good explanation why you should do it on the upshift (specially
for 911 owners... 1st to 2nd shift)

The file is 90.06 from the archives. If you want it, I could probably strip
it down and send it out to those that request it. Please email me directly.

I also have an 87 944S, and from what I can tell, based on the factory
parts fiche and the options on my car, the 87 944S did not come standard
with any sport suspension. The standard rear torsion bars are 23.5 mm,
and the same part number as the 8 valve cars (including turbo). The
front springs for the 944S have a different part number, but the shop
manual provides spring rates, and they are the same. The 944S simply has
a slightly taller spring, so the ride height comes out the same with slightly
greater engine weight. 8 valve and 16 valve cars have the same stock
struts and shocks, and the same shock upgrade option. Both cars have the
same stock sway bar arrangement (the specific size varies with manufacture
date), and the same upgraded sway bar option. My car has the sway bar
option but not the shock option. It could be that the factory made very
few 944S without the sway bar option, but it is still shown as an option
on the sticker.

Bt the way, by 1987 the M030 option was essentially a race car. Early in
the 944 product line there was an M030 option which was a stiffer
street suspension, but by 1987 the M030 was what they were selling for 
the Playboy race cars, which was, if I remember correctly, not very
suitable for the street.

My AC/heater fan switch is intermittent in the first three positions and
only works in the high position when the faulty condition exists.
It seems to go intermittent on very hot days (could be coincidence?).
My instinct tells me that this is not just a dirty switch, as 
exercising the switch doesn't seem to make any difference.  I have the
schematic and see that there is a resistor in series with each pole
on the switch.  A local mechanic suggested to me that these resistors
go bad.  This doesn't make sense to me,  as it is intermittent.
Also I can't seem to make any sense of the location of components from
these schematics.  Another local mechanic told me he  "thinks the 
resistors are part of the switch."
Has anyone else experienced this problem?  Any suggestions before I

Hi, Paul.
 
You should be able to take the seats out and clean them with saddle soap and
a soft sponge or brush. It takes a while. What doesn't clean, like cracks
and such, could be redyed.
 
The rip might be repairable by a good upholstery shop which can replace only

you keep most of the original leather.

Subject: Tire Friction

Rubber tires, particularly the highest performance ones, do not match
the textbook picture of coefficient of friction.  If they did,
drag racers would have no chance of achieving an average of 2 G's
of acceleration over the quarter mile.

The interaction between the tire and the road depends very much on
the softness and stickyness of the tire on the rough pavement surface.
Temperature and contact patch size are important parameters.  There
clearly are others related to the mechanical strength and elastic
properties of the rubber.  These are the things that the racing tire
manufacturers play with to optimize tires for particular conditions.

Tires, as has been pointed out, are a compromise.  In addition to the
rolling friction and inertia, the width which leads to good dry adhesion
can lead to worst traction in the wet.  Tread helps this, but only to
a limited degree.  Ice and snow are something else, if you drive on them.

As a street driver in an older (lower powered 356) I am happy with the
compromise of roughly stock tires.  At least I am less likely to run out
of adhesion in a thunderstorm even if I don't maximize dry cornering
force.  My experience with wide tires on a CRX in wet and snow has raised
the adrenaline level a few times.

Funny, it seems clear to me that the coefficient of friction tends to go

contact patch; 10 times the pressure * 0.1 times the area * the

After installing 17" wheels and tires, my rear end (not that rear end :) ) is

now with the shorter, stiffer sidewalls.  Front end height is about the same. 
I perused the archives and found a relevant discussion on lowering between 
Nathan, Kevin and Frank in Nov '92. I'm not interested in changing springs 
right now to lower/stiffen the car correctly,  maybe later.
 
1. Has anyone actually lowered their 951 by removing the front spring spacer? 
 (supposedly increases height by 1" to meet US bumper ht. req)

2. Has anyone adjusted/removed the rear spring plate to lower the rear?

3. I'm running 40psi on D40M2s (245/40, 255/40).  For autoxers with D40M2s, 
what pressures are you using?  The recent thread on contact patch/adhesion 
makes me wonder if my pressure is too high.  I don't have access to a 
pyrometer so I'll try chalk at NNJR's autox this Sunday at Monclair State

    First of all, thanks to everyone that responded to my Alternator
    Light problem- as soon as the problem is fixed, I will let you all
    know what it was and what the solution is.  Now for the latest...

    My friend, who also has a 1971 911, has a problem with his
    passenger side door window.  The window binds in the track and as
    a result the window regulator pops out of the bottom of the
    window.  We are fairly sure that the regulator is not the problem
    because when we move the window up and down in the track with the
    regulator disconnected, the window seriously binds.  He has tried
    a few different things, including changing the frame (the
    replacement frame does not bind as much, but it still binds a
    little and when the door closes the frame actually hits the roof
    of the car- is it possible he is trying a frame from an earlier
    car?).  He has also set the window in the regulator at half height
    and tightened all the bolts in the order the factory manual shows,
    but to no avail.  I had a similar problem a year or so ago after a
    passenger slammed the door shut.  The window was binding to the
    point that the regulator popped out from the window.  I took the
    frame out, reconnected the window to the regulator and tightened
    all the bolts according to the specified order.  My problem is
    better, but the window does bind once in a while.

    With two 1971 911s with the same problem, I would be surprised if
    no one else has not experienced something similar.  If anyone has
    a cure, or any suggestions, your help would be appreciated.

reflects heat to the interior brake pad dramatically accelerating its wear.

I've received a few responses and thank you to those who did respond. But,
the responses ARE EXACTLY SPLIT, HALF SAYING THE SHEILD DOES DRAMATICALLY
ACCELERATE WEAR ON THE INSIDE PAD and the OTHER HALF SAYING THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO APPRECIABLY DIFFERENT WEAR ON INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE PADS DUE
TO HEAT.

I don't want to generate an argument but I would like to increase the
sample size. So,

    In track/road use does the heat retain and reflected by
    the heat shield accelerate the wear of the interior pads
    significantly?

I'm afraid I can't help you on the windshield antenna.  However, if you do wind
up having to mount a regular power antenna, the stock location is on the left
front fender.  The antenna is mounted inside the front left wheel well behind a
large cylinder, which is, I think, a charcoal cannister for the fuel system.  I
have replaced my antenna and I am a real beginner when it comes to working on
cars, so you shouldn't have much difficulty installing said antenna.  The only
additional step for you will be drilling the hole in the fender.  The antenna I
bought came with directions on how large the hole should be, etc., although it
is pretty obvious.

   The red "vallet" differs from the black "owner" key in that the red key
will only open the doors and start the car, I will not open the glove box
or the trunks.  (<- Gee, guess what I drive!)  This helps to keep nosy
vallets out of your belongings, and keeps you from fumbling to seperate
keys or, even worse, having to give up all your keys.  Which reminds me,
has anyone else heard of a scam awhile back where vallets who were given
the complete set of keys would drive the car back to that person's house
(address from the registration), let themselves in, (no suspicious cars...)
steal a few things, and then return to a nice tip for keeping the car warm?
It just doesn't get any sweeter than that!!

Subject: Re: Silicone Brake Fluid

A couple of additional comments on Silicone Brake fluid.

Regarding Kevin's post about incompatible rubber parts, etc.,
what I have heard is that even if your rubber parts (flexible
hoses included) are compatible, if they have ever been used
with glycol based fluids, they become incompatible through
absorption of the glycol.

Basically, if you want silicone, you must REPLACE all the rubber
in your braking system.

Also, the part about silicone not absorbing water -- water will
still get into your braking system, it just won't mix with the
fluid.  It can collect and due its own damage, and if it gets
hot, it will boil much easier than the dirtiest old glycol fluid.

I've also heard that it gets spongy at high temps, but consider 
that unsubstantiated.

Advice from better racers than I am:
Go with a high temp Racing fluid and bleed/replace it often.


A question:  is it true that the biggest difference between DOT 3
and DOT 4 fluid is not the dry boiling point values, but how large of
a change there is to the wet boiling point?  I ask because Castrol
LMA is a DOT 4 -- it has Low Moisture Absorbancy (hence: LMA)
and many Racing fluids, as well as the highly touted Ford "High boil"
are only DOT 3.  I have always figured that it was because they were
more hygroscopic and had a lousy wet boiling point.

I have used Motul and I know it blows away Castrol LMA in dry boiling
point, but it is only DOT 3 (I think?).

First, your VIN code decoded.  This came from the Porsche spec book -

My temperature gage rides on or just above the first white marker.
Occasionally, when in serious stop and go traffice in very hot
weather it drifts up to the next mark (the one before the red zone).

Thanks for all of the responses on this question.  The window sticker,
which I have for my car, shows that the sports supension option in 1984
included rear sway bar, bigger front sway bar, and stiffer shocks.  I look
for a rear sway bar to see if the car has sports supension.  All of the
944S cars that I have seen have rear sway bars, so if it wasn't standard,
at least it was a popular option.

My understanding is that in '84 the M030 option included larger sway
bars, stiffer springs/torsion bars, and adustable spring/shock perches.
Apparenly this option became more "radical" in later years, perhaps
due to the Firehawk series.  I have seen Rothmans prepared Firehawk
cars (this is from memory, I hope I am not confusing things) for $35K.
That is a bit more than I want to spend...

I will probably be looking for a 944S unless I can convince myself
that I can afford an S2 or Turbo S.  Maybe I shouldn't test drive a
Turbo, the others may end up looking too tame in comparison!

Anyway, this weekend I am putting in a new motor mount, plugs,
wires, cap and rotor and new lubricants.  Then it is off to autocrossing

Subject:       914 -2.0 Puzzler for the week

Background:
Recently my (sometimes less than beloved) 914 has developed a nasty 
miss. The problem seems to occur around the time when the moter has 
developed its maximum RPM for the given throttle position. With my 
driving style this equates to around 3500 - 4000 RPM, but if I adjust 
my shift points up or down, the point when the miss occurs seems to 
move with the shift point. If I disconnect the throttle switch, the 
miss starts occuring as soon as I snap the throttle open.

I suspect the pressure sensor is at fault after checking to see if it 
would hold a vacume and finding that it dosen't. The resistance 
values are OK though.

Am I on the right track? Should the pressure sensor hold a vacume?

I have checked everything else except the injectors over the last two 
weeks and I can't find anything else that is out of spec and I have 
started to reach my wits end... Any net wisdom would be appreciated!

P.S. If the pressure sensor is defective, does anyone out there have 
an extra one they would be willing to part with? $200 bucks for a new 
one is a bit steep for my current budget.

Michael, greetings again.

  Yes and no.  I replaced both sails on my '73.  I also replaced:
  drv side longitudinal (rocker).
  rear trunk floor.
  both jack mounts.
  both front bumper mounts.
  drv side rear bumper mount.
  front trunk floor (where a/c condenser WAS).
  Rear pass. side suspension console.  (the dreaded console)
  Battery tray and support.  (natch..)
  -and a SHITLOAD of incidental holes, pits, and accident damage.(not mine)

  I earned a doctorate in 914 surgery too...(the total was over 45 sites).

  I was very *green* when i started, and much of my toils are documented
and perhaps contained in the archives..such is history.  I finished the
welding in August of '93.  I'm still working on the car when i have the
time and bux.  It is still hanging on the rotisserie.

  The panels;
  I first started purchasing sail panels and jack mounts/tubes from, er,
tweeks.  When I got the parts i freiked out when i saw the 'made in taiwan'
stickers.  If you are interested, a search between '91 and '93 will
contain the girth of my experiences, perhaps as early as june of '90
when i procured the MIG welder and created The_Rotisserie.

  Anyway, the sails were around $100 each then and not worth that, IMHO.
  The twinks parts were thinner gauge than i would prefer, so i limited 
my purchases to Stoddard (ouch!) and er, auto atlanta (r. trunk floor only).
  The biggest difference I saw was heavier gauge, and I like a thicker
panel because it welds better, warps less, and is generally higher quality.
  There are now other sources to get these parts, sorry but i dunno anymore
because i never checked them out.

  These parts rarely fit perfect out of the box, in my case they all had to
be 'heat and beat' some to get them to fit.  There were also several cases
where I didnt need (or want!) to replace the entire structure, and so i
excerpted the part i needed and welded that in after carefully excising
the cancered portion.  This was, needless to say, tedious work.

  One thing i can attest to about the 914 body is that they are not perfect.
  Each one has its own glitch, but if the measurements check out according
to the factory manual, the car will align properly and go straight down
the road.  I did have a problem with sag in the body induced by my
ignorance when replacing the rocker panel while hanging on the frame.
  My stiffener (1/2"X 2" X 6' bar stock) failed when i welded in the part...

  But doing a sail panel is a lo-tech, good place to start since the 
dimensions are not critical.  Watch out for the door handle indent because
that area is both brazed AND leaded...contaminating the metal for welding.
  Behind the sails are support brackets that also like to rust away..
  I fabricated my own with a molded 2X4 and a shot filled leather bag.

  If you have more questions, I'll try to help.
  Good luck.

You have a problem!  Either you need a new thermostat (possibly) or you
have a bad temp switch (very likely!). The switch is on the side of the 
radiator closest to the engine on the drivers side under the hose.  It is 
fairly easy to change if you have a socket or a wrench that will fit it.  New
ones are about $20 and there is a lower temperature one on the market that
might be worth looking for.  Oh, this is the switch that turns on the low 
speed fans when the radiator gets too hot. Do your fans come on?

I, too, am interested in this. I have an '87 944S.

90F outside temp, A/C on, cruise at 70-80 mph, temp gauge centered
in middle range.

90F outside temp, A/C on, city driving, temp gauge sometimes gets
very close to white marker.

It has touched the top white marker once, while city driving going up

This is very unintuitive.  I would have guessed that the coefficient would

I have a 911SC so the a/c fan may be different.  Take this advice accordingly.
First, try to determine if the noise is caused by a bent "squirrel cage" fan or
a worn motor.  If it is a worn motor, you can remove the fan housing and only
replace the motor.  You can order this motor from a Bosch supplier.  I ordered
mine from:

Battery Ignition Components, Inc
91 Meadow St.
Hartford, Conn. 06114
203-296-4215

For my car, the motor part number was: 013 000 7081.  This is stamped
on the motor itself.  The last two digits may vary even for the same model
year, check with the guys above.  If you only need the motor and order from
the company above, instead of Por$che, it will cost you less than $30.

#2 cylinder and reads low on the #4 cylinder.  The other four cylinders
all respond equally.  #2 wont lower until Im close one turn out and #4 will
not reach the same level as the four good stacks no matter how far I turn the
air bypass screw out.

Any suggestions?  Is this normal?  I will remove my stacks and check for 
blocked air passages this weekend.   


Thanks 
Steve

The drivers door on my 911 clicks loudly at the metal door stay when I open it.
I have a Rolled Pin inserted in the hole of the stay on the drivers side,but
a different pin (looks like the top section of a Nail) on the passenger's side
door stay, and it doesn't click on that door.  Which is the correct type pin

i would guess that you have a drop of oil (or other crud) on the fuel
injection points (or they are worn out).  if i remember correctly, they
slide out sideways from the base of the distributor.  when i had this
problem, cleaning these points solved it.

I recently noticed that the Fresh Air Flap on the pre-heat induction unit in
my '73 911 is glued in the open position.  Normally I think a thermostat 
regulates the position of this flap along with the position of a Warm Air Flap.
A mechanic told me that it doesn't matter that the Fresh air flap is glued
open because it never gets that cold in California.  Is there any reason why
I should get this system fixed?

I took my '84 944 to Puget Sound Tire for an autocross alignment.  They 
lowered the

the strut on my
fiche) locking bolt and loosening and turning the ride height eccentric 
bolt.  The
locking bolt is the one closest to the torsion bar.  The ride height 
bolt is the next out.
The bolt that is third out is the camber eccentric.  Don't mess with 
that one unless you
want to change your camber.

Two caveats:  I didn't actually see them do this, they pointed it out 
after the job
was done.  I cannot say catagorically that this will not affect the

Second, I am assuming that 951s have the same torsion bar/spring plate/strut

Subject: Re: 944 questions/opinions

Well, my '87 Porsche 924S, which has a 944 engine/drivetrain, exhibits
the following behavior:

I am describing temperatures as follows. On my gauge there is a white 
bounded box (cold), line 1, line 2, line 3, and then a red bounded box
(overheated). 

With the a/c off it will stay between line 1 and line 2 at normal 
freeway conditions, unless hill climbing. It will stay there at 80+ mph.

Hill Climbing makes it go up. I can get it to line 3 trivially on 
angeles crest highway btwn glendale and Mt. wilson (anyone local wanna
compare -- incidentally the Mt.Wilson road, which is a turnoff from ang.crest,
makes for a really interesting drive. ) It doesnt have to be abused to heat
up on this road. Going 30-40 will suffice.

City traffic heats it up bad. Its not hard to get above the 2nd line, but
usually it wont get over #3. Waiting for lights will do it too. I shift
to Neutral for long lights. (automatic -- so I'm weird)

When it reaches line 2, the high speed fan clicks in. Its on all the time
when the a/c is engaged. One time it stayed on all the time, requiring a
battery charge and a new relay.

Does yours do the following, somewhat disturbing thing ? When idling and I'm
putting it away in a large garage, the temp indicator will sometimes make a 
sudden leap to the right. Sudden, like the gauge was previously stuck. At this point,
though the fan clicks on. Now, there are two possibilities. Either the gauge
and thermostat are working properly or they are not. If not, then I probably
should get this fixed at some point. If so, then the thermostat must be
encountering some sudden heat source it is not used too (leak, or steam, or ???).

I would appreciate information as to what the gauge is reading. It has been
doing this since the water pump was changed. e.g. where is the thermostat,
anyway ?

I sort of agree and sort of don't.  One side of me says to leave well
enough alone.  Bleed it, look for leaks or problems, and if there are
none, so be it.

Replacing the cylinder is always an option, but at $300 list on new cars,
perhaps not one which, when combined with labour, will appeal to an
owner, esp. when there's no manifest problem.

You should also be aware that rebuild kits are simply not available,
anywhere, for some newer cars.  For example, they don't exist for MY87
and forward 944-series cars.  It is also the case that few, if any,
shops will rebuild an MC (or a calliper) for liability reasons.

[Insane cackling.]  Well, this is one of the things about the 944S which
truly, truly sucks.  Y'know those big intake manifold runners, the ones
you can sort of get a couple of fingers through?  Look closely between
them and you'll see the idle stablizer.

If it needs to be replaced or cleaned (and it does need to be cleaned),
you have no choice but to remove the intake manifold.  After removing
a bunch of other stuff, like the fuel rail, throttle linkage, and
induction hose (at the back, real pain to get to).

This will be a splendid time to also replace the intake manifold gasket
(944.110.305.02) and the injector lower o-rings and their plastic caps
(apparently 944.110.901.00; I use Bosch parts set 1.287.010.704).  You
definitely cannot reused the existing gasket, and it's probably time to do
the o-rings.

You ought to also check the hoses to and from the stabilizer.  They
get tired, and they also get exposed to oil which degrades and swells
them.  When this happens, they can be a real bitch to get clamped
properly back onto the stabilizer.

Michael Hodos recommends Autos International for upholstery.
 
As Bob Albrecht and I found out, it pays to shop around. We're both near
Autos International, he a half hour south, me a little over an hour north.
We shopped there. I wound up having my 356 done by Thomas Auto Trim in San
Diego, Bob had his done by Ocean Beach Upholstery. Each was priced about
half what Autos asked, and did a super job. Mine is concours quality, I
haven't seen Bob's but he's really happy with it. Autos does work of similar
quality but at twice the price.
 
Autos International has a name because they advertise a lot and ship kits
all over the country, but they are not necessarily the last word in having
your car done. They get their raw materials from somebody else, just like
every good upholstery shop. What they then do with the raw materials is
no different from what any other competent shop can do.
 
Also, remember that buying a "kit" is not the same as having a pro do your
upholstery. I like doing a lot of stuff on my 356s myself, but defer to the
experts when expedient. (I don't do my own chrome, I don't do my own
upholstery. Not sure yet about paint).

The gaps between first, third, and fifth, even with a short
shift are rtaher large. The same is true for second and forth.

I suspect these people would have missed the shift without the
short shift as well. You have to miss by a bunch to miss a shift
with a 915.

What I am saying here is that I don't think you say short shifts
are bad just because people that miss shifts seem to have them.

I submit the following:

1. Most missed shifts happen at race track.
2. Most Porsche 911s with 915 transmissions that are used at a
   race track have short shift kits installed.

These two points are a given. Because of this, some people assign
the problem to the short shift kit, not the race track usage where
the blame really belongs.

A 915 with a short shift is a more precise device, and, in my humble
opinion, much easier to use properly with a short shift kit.

I hear there is a trick that involves using a die grinder to cut
a very shallow channel around the circumference of the inner and outer 
portions of the bushing, then drilling a hole through the bushing
so that it intersects the channel on the inside. Then drill two
holes on the mounting point and mount a pair of grease zerks -- 
one sticking throuh the hole and "feeding" the inner channel, one
just sticking into the outer channel and "feeding" it...

Good luck, anyway!

Be careful that there isn't more to the picture as well -- if for

front air dam, you get a pile of front lift at high speed... There
may be other pieces you have to change to make the 3.8 tail "work"!

On the cooling issue, a friend (ex-F-16 jock, budding Porschenut)

engine temp by a clear 30 degrees. Now, this *IS* in Houston

On my 86'951 the idle stabilizer is located underneath the intake manifold.
The manifold must be removed first, along with the fuel rail, injectors, etc.
I imagine that this is about a 5/hr job.

The Workshop Manuals calls the idle stabilizer the idle actuator.
The procedure is described in the 944 Turbo Manual 24-14,24-15

This is all that I can help you with now, because the 951 is different in
engine design. I think that stabilizer removal is easier on the 944 S.

I hope cleaning solves your problem!

seems to have pretty good service/rates. As long as the package is traceable
and insured, it should be fine.

2. The length one person needs the tool should be dependant on who needs it
next. It is stupid to have one person keep the tool. Instead, the tool should
simply go from place to place where it is needed. Since we all meet here,
this seems a good place to keep track of who has the tool (we of course
should all have each other's phone numbers/addresses just in case). Assuming
that we are responsible and can trust each other (oh my gosh - what a
concept) then there shouldn't be a problem. We will know where the tool is,
and if one member has it for too long a period of time, then he will get
harrassed by the other members until he gets it to the party who needs it. If
it is not currently needed, then it will just stay at whoever's home until
the next person requests it. Pretty simple stuff. It just relies on trust and
on none of us being assholes (sorry Stan ...).

Any more suggestions are welcome. If it seems like we have a plan, then we
will decide who buys the tool and where and how much it will cost. I agree
that we should buy the other two tools that are required for the balance
shaft rollers, and make this a kit. I have seen two prices for this guage.
Automotion ($529) and Engine Builder's Supply ($389 - ad on page 25 of the
June Excellence). We have to find out if this is the same (and proper) guage
as what the Porsche dealer uses. I have not checked into this at all, but I
plan on it. Let's bang heads on this. We want to get the right tool, but we
want to get the best deal on it too!

Subject: Misc. 944 Clutch Info

I have recently completed a clutch replacement on my '84 944. Although the
recent memo from Mike Kehr on clutch replacement is excellent (I couldn't
have done it without you!), his memo is written from the experience of a
clutch job on an '86 944 turbo, there are some significant differences to
doing a clutch job on an earlier car. Unless you have read the notes on the
clutch replacement, the following may seem quite meaningless, however, if you
have FTP access, then you should be able to get the original memo from the
archives.

I found the 12pt tool a little hard to find in parts stores, however I went
with a set of them made by Lysle (I think that's how it's spelled) tools,
that included 6,8,10, and 12mm bits. These guys did not come as sockets, but
rather as "bits" that could be used in a 1/2", 6pt socket. I did not have any
problem using this tool at all, it seemed to be of good quality, and you get
all four for $12, as opposed to the Snap-On which is about $16 for one
socket. The tool is called a 12pt Triple Square (at least that's what Snap-On
and Lysle call it ...).

The pressure plate bolts were not the "Cheeseheads" that Mike described, but
rather plain old 6mm allen bolts. This was not only the case with the bolts
that were on the car, but also with the replacements that I got from the
Porsche dealer. I'm glad I had this type of bolt rather than the "Cheesehead"
type, it was much easier to deal with as the allen hole was quite deep (not
much chance of it stripping as opposed to the Cheeseheads, which Mike
described as to be very delicate in that department).

The clutch bellhousing bolts. Arrh !!! These were very hard to get off. I
mean REALLY hard. I actually snapped one bolt in half (the upper driver's
side). There is still a stud that protrudes from the block into the
bellhousing, but that's it. I HOPE it will be okay untill I can get the motor
out of the car and I can drill it out and re-tap it. There is no way I can
fix this with the engine in the car, the bolt is completely inaccessable.
Take you time with these bolts, apply pressure evenly and go slow. Don't be
as stupid as me ...

The shaft that holds the release lever in place was also a real bitch to get
out. (This is a thing that you thread an 8 x 150mm bolt into the end of, so
you can yank it out). I really had to throw all my strength into this to get
it out. When I was re-installing this it went in very easy after it was
cleaned and re-lubed.

The stupid speed sensors were extremely hard to get out (at the top of the
clutch housing). I busted one getting it out, and then I busted the sensor
holder getting the bellhousing off (cause the idiot sensor was busted in half
and the part that remained in the holder was holding the bellhousing on). In
any case, thses guys were tight. I noticed that the sensors came out much
easier on a later ('87) 944 which I pulled my replacement sensors off of, so
I figure mine were hard simply because of the age of the car.

These were the major differences/problems I found while replaceing my clutch.
Mike also mentions many things that need to be done for a turbo clutch
repacement that don't need to be done on an earlier 944. The differences are
pretty obvious (no cross pipe, oil cooler, etc.). I hope this information was
helpful to someone out there !!!

They've asked me for alternate ideas to make up for the `loss'.

Would a BMW factory tour be a partial substitute? (They'll be in Munich

Also, how would they go about arranging to drive the Nurburgring? Does

Treves944

Those two sensors, as I recall, are speed and timing sensors for the 
DME.  One picks up RPMs and the other TDC for spark ect..

Odly they are identical sensors, 86 951, and the engine
somtimes will work without one, don't recall which, unhooked
at its connector.  I believe they are highly sensitive
fast switching magnetic reluctance type.  
I noticed the cap screw/bolt holding them in had 'loctite'

Subject: Wide tire traction


Here's a couple of reasons why wider tires give better traction -
1. The wide tire holds a larger percentage of the tread flat to the road.
2. Softer compound tires will last longer if they're wider since the road
   force is distributed over the wider area.

Increasing the anti-roll stiffness at one end increases the difference between
the outside & inside tire's load, increasing the outside tire's temperature
and reducing the rim's control over the tread, while equalizing the diff.
between inside & outside tire on the other end of the car

If so, wider tires would be better because they'll heat up less

I tried this experiment and it's no harder to push the 2x4 sideways

I would tend to agree that it's the driving, not the short shifters 
causing the missed shifts, and the drivers missing shifts will likely all 
have short shifters.

BTW, is $115 at Stoddard's the best deal on a genuine Porsche short 
shifter for '77 911S?  How many hours of shop time estimated to install 
these?

How much est. time to instally KYB shocks on Bilstein struts?  Winchester 
auto again has them at 25% off, they have lifetime warranty.  

Does anyone know the story on HRS wheel lokcs?  Tweeks, Perf. products, 
and Automotion don't have them.  Stoddards does, but they're 
"Discontinued" in the price list.  Anyone know the best price in the bay

We just got back from the Lake Placid Parade.  What a great week!

The weather was fabulous, after a couple of thundershowers on the 
Concours Prep days.  Got to see quite a few Porschephiles there, among them
Stan Hanks (our illustrious leader!) at the gettogether that was arranged 
by Lou Krieg and Ann Pettyjohn from Vermont.

Porschephiles who trophied at the Parade included Mike Piera from 
Connecticut (think it was a first in his class in the autocross - why am
I not surprised???) and John Lowe in the Tech Quiz.  I was also lucky 
enough to trophy in the Tech Quiz and the Rally, but they went pretty deep
in both of the classes that I entered.

One of the highlights was seeing Peter Porsche on the stage, flexing his     
muscles for a skit with the party band on Friday night.  His son, Daniell,
also placed in his class at the autocross, in a Fly yellow 993.  Peter was
proud.

Anyhow, a great event.  The 40th Annual Parade will be held in Portland
Oregon from August 6 through August 12, so get your PCA membership cards and
start studying...

Subject: 914 problems/questions


While working on the 914 this weekend (making it look nice for those
people with money in their pockets... :-).  I ran into two problems.

First off. The wire from the temp gauge on the center console to the sending
unit on the engine has been dangling for some time.  I assumed that an
object had cut the cable.  But, when I reconnected the wire to the sender
the gauge just went all the way to the right.  The needle just stayed there
regardles of that temp the engine was actually at.  How does one correctly
connect the wire to the sending unit - is there something special required?
Or is my gauge/sending unit broken?  I couldn't find anything on this in the
Haynes manual ;-(.

Secondly.  I was trying out the venting system on the car for the first time
and was wondering how you get the fan in the engine compartment to go on.  I
am referring to the one fan/blower on the drivers side of the engine
comparment next to the relay board.  I tried all the different switch
settings I could think of on the climate controls, but it wouldn't go on.
The blower in the front of the car _does_ work, however (though not on high
 - any ideas on that one?).  What controls that blower in the engine
compartment?  Is it temperature activated, phase of moon, or what?

Any and all suggestions and comments appreciated, Alex

ps don't forget about the 914 parts db on-line at info@tac3.vv.hac.com.
Many people have retrieved it, but I haven't gotten much feedback.
What do you think?

When I changed my H2O pump (reconditioned part # actually a new pump{
on my 951 a NEW thermostat came with it along with gaskets bolts ect..

If you bought a Porsche part at a{Porsche dealer the thermo
will be covered by the one year warantee.  If done
at a Porsche dealer they might cover the Labor charge.

I suggest carefully checking the thermo swith in a pot of
water over a burner with a real good thermometer
to asure it open and closes at correct temps
(they are stamped for open temp as I recall)

To change it is a real pain..
on the turbo you have to take off air box and air tubes, radiator
hoses, fans, underside air shields, ect..
Than you have to work blind (use a mirror) to get the b#$%terd out
of the 'snout'.  Since a steel retainer ring is used it rusts and
swells <nitro is helpfull at this point>.
I had a hell of a time getting a thermostat out of the pump
when it was on the bench!  I'd take it real slow and easy
if it were on the car.

Well Good luck 'Doc' tell me how things go, and if you

I did my first one 'cause it actually broke on me.  Luckily I was only 
a few blocks away from the shop, and I went in to see what part i needed.
They diagnosed it in about 10 seconds gave me the part, and when I asked
what it took to put it on, they told me it shouldn't be any problem at all.
I did it in about 15 minutes right there on the side of the street.  When
I was done, I went ahead and bought one for the other side and put it on as

Subject: 944S2 noises


Hello All;

In my continuing search for my first Porsche (944 variety), I ran across a '90 
944S2 for sale at a Virginia dealer.  Guards Red, black leather, only 33K 
miles...beautiful car!  Until I started it up and took it for a test drive.  
Upon starting the car with the transmission in Neutral, I heard a very faint 
grating sound coming from underneath the car.  Depressing the clutch, while 
still in neutral, the sound went away.  It would return when the clutch was 
released.  Upon driving the car, the clutch would engage almost as soon as the 
pedal was lifted from the floor.  The grating noise could still be heard when 
accelerating, although not very loud.  The noise seemed to disappear when 
cruising.  The car accelerated and handled beautifully otherwise.

My question is, does this sound like a clutch going bad or just a minor 
adjustment of some kind?  Are Porsche 944's notorious for going through 
clutches at relatively early ages?  This is the second 944 I have looked at(the 
other was a Turbo S) with less than 40K miles which have had potential clutch 
problems.  Although I know a prepurchase inspection is necessary before 
purchasing a used Porsche, I do not want to waste my time or money inspecting a 
car which may require several thousand dollars worth of repairs before I buy it.

I know noise questions are difficult to diagnose, but any thoughts on what the 
problem could be would be greatly appreciated.  You can E-mail me directly or 
post to the list if you think your response will benefit the entire group.  
Thanks in advance.

some may accept as knowledge.	
	I use my car (951S, 3000# w/o driver) almost exclusively on the 
track.  The splash shields are removed and a Cool Brake kit installed.
	Because front pads are the second biggest expense next to entry 
fees to track this car, I've monitored brake pad wear (some may say 
obsessively) over the last two years.  To do this I measure the pad 
thickness with an electronic caliper every time I check the pads.  Ususally 
this is before an event, at least once during the event and after the 
event.  I check ech of the four front pads in two places - at the 
centerlines of each piston where it pushes against the backside of the pad.
	I've collected this info mainly to have a database of pad 
consumption on different tracks (and it does vary widely) so I can predict 
when I'll have to change pads.
	To get back to the question at hand, I can say that with my car, my 
suspension settings and my driving style, the inner pads wear more than the 
outer.  How much greater isn't a simple question because it varies from 
track to track and by how much pad material you have.  I'd throw an 
approximation at up to 20% more.
	I can also say that the top of the pads wear more than the bottoms. 
 The 951S front calipers have 44mm pistons on top and 36mm on the bottom.  
Based on my experience, I'd redesign these things to have 38mm on the 
bottom to even up this wear.
	My data is for Cool Carbon pads both blue and green compounds and 
for Performance Friction blue compound (now called by some number).
	Hope this helps your survey, Bruce.

The Problem:

oil temp heats up normally. then jumps up?

Pressure is good until the temp rises then falls to 1 bar, 

Zero on idle.

Any ideas?

This is a friends 87 911sc. He had no problems until this last
oil change. The sump cover was pulled and  the screen cleaned. 
I did pull the sump plate again and check to see if it was in 
the right position.  It was!  My best guess is that something
was knocked loose and is causing the  thermostat to stick. Yours?

Subject: RE: Brake dust shields


The shields are intended to keep road grunge out of the brakes. Porsche uses
a few different configurations, most are flat with no holes for additional
ventilation except at the center of the hub. The M030 optioned 944, 951, 944S2
and perhaps the 968 have scoops on the top side of the shield. This directs
additional air to the caliper and pads, not the rotor (the rotor is secondary
in this instance).

There is very little to support the notion of the rotor wearing faster on the 
inside because of the shield. There is a lot more data to support the inside 
PAD overheating. I usually arrange my ducting to direct air as closely to the
caliper as possible. the Cool Brake kits do just that. The caliper becomes hot
faster than the rotor (smaller mass). The Cool Carbon Pads with the backing pads
keep heat from getting to the caliper quickly, hence added brake response for
a long time on track.

Aluminum hubs help wheel bearing life, if you have a 914/4 and are using the 
stock brakes, check your wheel bearings after each session. The iron 1-piece
units are very hard to cool, remove the shields before going to a track session.
The aluminum hubs keep most of the heat from the wheel bearings, they also 
cool faster and are lighter.


Just look at cars at the track, you'll get a few ideas.

If you were a 1979 clutch in a blue car, and there were 2 friction surfaces
and 2 pressure plates, would the friction surfaces match exactly the surface
area of the pressure plates?  Or would the friction surfaces have a diameter
of about 1/2" less than the pressure plates?  Also, would the throw-out bearing
be rubber-coated and NOT fit correctly into the release arm?  Since I am not a 
clutch, and not even a blue car, I would like some figures for the following
parts:

diameter of first friction plate
diameter of surface area on first pressure plate
diameter of second friction plate
diameter of surface area on second pressure plate

Subject: timing belt tensioning

I am taking my 85.5 944 in tomorrow for a rounded hand full of unrelated
tasks and decided that I'd ask them to re-adjust the new timing belt that
they put in about 2200 miles ago. Although someday soon we may have a
tensioning gage timeshare club, the miles are steadily going past and the
new belt really should be checked so...  

But here's my question. I've always understood, or at least accepted, that
the tension measurement had to be taken 'cold'. This means that I drop the
car off the previous night and they round up a couple of guys to hand push
it into the service bay when my turn comes up the next day. That seems like
it should be enough time (ten to twelve hours at minimum) for the car to
become certifiably 'cold'. Well the service manager is NOW telling me that
there is a bulliten out that recommends/requires 24 hours before this
measurement can be done. Geeeze! I can't think of anything except
Mozzarella cheeze that holds heat THAT long.

Have any of you water-pumpers ever heard of so long a wait being necessary?

Subject: My car passed smog!

Reid

I finally got my '73 S to pass smog.  I got lucky on Sunday and found a mechanic
who was willing to let me use his Emissions Analyzer.  This mechanic builds
race cars for the rich guys in the SF Bay Area.  Anyway, he helped me out
free of charge (I tipped him 20 bucks though) and I learned some things in
the process.  First, we determined that my idle speed was way too low.  I 
already knew that and told him I had the six air bypass screws turned out
4 turns already.  He said that the six throttle stop screws are my main
adusters for idle speed and the air bypass screws are just for fine
adjustment.  

We raised the idle speed a bit by moving the timing from 5degATDC to 2degATDC
and then turned the throttle stop screw on the #1 cylinder in till we read
1000rpm's.  That lowered my HC reading to 400ppm, which is the limit.  I 
clicked the idle mixture screw on the injection pump 2 clicks leaner and
Voila, 2.25%CO 150ppmHC.  Smog check is history.

What I learned was that you have to make sure all six throttle plates (valves)
are even by disconnecting the throttle linkage and removing the air stacks first.  Then take a thin strip of paper and insert it between the throttle plate and
the bore of the throttle body, start with #1 cylinder.  Then turn the throttle
stop screw ccw while sliding the paper.  Turn the screw until the paper drags
withdraw it and then turn the screw cw a quarter turn.  Repeat for all 
other throttle plates.  Then reattach your linkage with no pre-load.  
Fine adjustments are then made with the six air bypass screws.  If you
cant bring the idle speed up to 900 +/- 50 rpm (spec for 72-73 911's) then
go back and turn the six throttle stop screws each a quarter turn.  Continue
until idle speed reaches spec.  Recheck synchronization with a synchrometer.

I agree with this and would add that on my '87 911, the job was greatly

After reading about the durabilty of the SC's for so long now,

It has gotten to the point that a really nice SC is nearly

To be more specific on 911's, pre C2:

10.8 mm is the stock offset on an 8" wheel for a 911.  23.3mm
is the stock offset for a 7" wheel.  Somewhere around 37mm
is the stock offset for a 6" wheel.

Each of these offset/wheel widths keep a constant backspacing of 125mm.

Backspacing is defined as the distance from the mounting surface of the
wheel to inside of the rim (perpendicular to the mounting surface).

Offset is defined as the distance from the centerline of the rim to
the mounting surface of the rim (perpendicular to the mounting surface).

911 owners with MFI

I received a bunch of old receipts from the previous owner of my '73 911S over
the weekend.  Its been very interesting reading.  I now have a copy of the 
original window sticker (he paid $15k, cash, in 11/73) along with the 
original master key number card, for replacements.  

While sifting through all the receipts, I found a letter that the owner
sent to the Robert Bosch Corporation in South San Francisco back in 1979.
He was complaining of a serious design problem in the Bosch MFI pumps that
caused gas to leak into the engine oil.  Apparently this happened twice to
him, the second time right after installing a factory rebuilt pump.

Have any of you experienced or heard of this problem before?  Did Bosch
ever correct the problem in the design?  Probably not since '73 was the 
last year for MFI, but hopefully its been corrected for replacement pumps.

Hi Sorrin,

My temp needle hovers between the lower white line and a point about an
eighth of an inch above that line. NEVER up to the last white line. In
traffic with the AC on (back when I actually had Freon in my AC) it does
creep up to slightly above midway before the fans come on.

Some time ago I purchased one of those fan switches that another reader has
mentioned; the ones that come on at a lower temperature. I thought it
couldn't help but help if I switch the fans on sooner than at the midway
position as mentioned above. Well, thanks to our friends at Automotion I'm
now stuck with a switch that doesn't fit my car and they won't take it back
'cause it's an electrical component and blah blah blah. They said in their
glossy catalog that it was correct for 'some (earlier) year through 85.5'.
Since I have an 85.5 I sent for it and when I tried to install it found
that there were the wrong number of terminals, (I'd have to look at it
before I'd remember if the replacement had three and the original had two
or the other way around, or they had three and four terminals
respectively...?) Anyhow what they *meant* to say in the catalog was that
the part listed was appropriate for 'some (earlier) year through to *just
before* 85.5'.

So if any of you have an 85.0 or earlier and would like to make me an offer
on an absolutely new low set-point fan switch... You can trust me that the
part is perfectly good even if Automotion doesn't.

Well folks, thanks to persuasion from the list members I've decided to
bite the bullet and drop the engine etc from my '82 911 SC to do the
following Work:
        Replace fuel line carrying fuel from tank to motor

        Carrera tensioner mod

        Possible clutch upgrade to spring center

        replace busted ex. head stud

Answers to the following are earnestly solicted.
1)  Asked a couple of the local dealers if I can order this (metal) fuel
    line as part - they said "make it up yourself".  Well this is a steel
    tube and I can't find a flaring tool to handle it, mine is designed
    for softer alumimium.  This also uses metric(I assume) flare fittings,
    not easily found.  Havn't called to mail order places yet, since this
    is going to be hard to ship.  Any suggestions on what I should do
    here ?  I'm thinking about checking with local hydraulic specialists.

2)  Do the chain tensioner kits come with everything ?  What else to I
    need to buy (eg chain ramps, new chain etc )?

3)  Since I had to back my adjust screw out all the way to get the
    required 0.040" (?) play at the release arm when I put in a new
    clutch cable last month I'd say my clutch is worn.  Do these
    clutch rebuild kits come with everything I ought to replace ? If
    not, whats else is recommended to replace ?

4)  Turns out the busted head stud is Dilavar (at least it doesn't
    stick to a magnet).  Is it normal for these to break ?  If all
    looks OK when heads off, should I bother replacing the rest
    of the studs since (at least the exhaust side) studs are
    already Dilaver ?

I know Stan, I know...buy the factory workshop manuals.  They're on the
list.  I'm still readning Anderson.

By the way, Anderson claims 30hp add'l out of an SC motor by switching
to a free flow exhaust and Weber carbs.  The carbs recommendation is
counter intuitive, anyone out there done this mod on a STREETABLE car ?

Hello Porschephiles with knowledge of Chicago neighborhoods:
Please reply direct to below e-mail address to save net bandwidth.

This is to ask the net wisdom on hotels with safe parking lots to park my 
pristine 1987 911 and to sleep overnight in the NW Chicago suburbs. 
This car has always been parked within sight, and under cover if under trees
or in direct sunlight. When necessary, I park it on high and deserted spots of 
parking lots (shopping trolleys roll downhill), but occasionally I have
returned to find a rustbucket parked within 2 inches (*#@!&#). 

I will drive from St. Louis to Chicago and back, and I will need to stay for
one night somewhere reasonably near Mt. Prospect (and I will be paying for all
expenses out of pocket).  I plan to be within sight of the car, except when in
the hotel room. Hotel parking valets are out of the question, so a Best
Western, Holiday Inn, Courtyard Marriott or alike with a deserted parking lot
in a safe (residential?) neighborhood is, I think, my best bet. I will have a
cover for the car, but thieves and vandals know this shape from afar.  

My travel agent's books list one Courtyard in very south Arlington Heights
(Algonquin Rd), and another in very north (seems just outside) Arlington
Heights. I don't mind driving longer to Mt. Prospect just to make sure the car
is safe overnight. Any comments on where to stay? Any suggestions on suitable
hotels with parking lots sloping uphill away from the hotel? Or should   
I just drive the everyday driver? 

Thanks for all your help

Tracy,

My '87 has this noise. I believe you are hearing normal drivetrain
noise. I understand some do it, some don't. I'd say there is nothing

Mike,

I mean't more precise in that the throws are shorter and the
apparent play is reduced. So, in this sense, it is more precise.

People get some damned defensive around here!!

And hell, if you think about it, the only way a short shift
kit could be the cause of the problem is if it did cause the
shifting to be more precise. Therefore increasing the odds of
a making a mistake.

So it sounds like there may be two causes to this problem.

1. The pressure of track events.
2. The increased precision required by the short shift.

Now, after

and/or a

You should try polishing the car before waxing it.  Wax just covers the 
oxidization
whereas polish removes it.  You could try Meguiars Medium Cut Cleaner or
something similar.  Polish is a very fine abrasive, so you don't want to get
carried away with a power polisher 'cause you could go all the way through
the paint.  Take your time doing small areas by hand and you should get
very satisfying results.

BTW, I believe Guards Red is a single topcoat paint, so it should be
thicker than a clearcoat on a metallic paint.  Clearcoated metallics
take a bit more care to avoid removing too much paint.

I attended a PWNR PCA tech session recently that was given by the
Meguiars tech rep.  Very informative.  He covered color sanding,
polishing, and related finish care subjects.  You might call Meguiars
to see if he is giving any talks in your area.  (I have his name at home

 Thank you all for responding to my survey. I have compiled the results 
and will reply to you and send a copy to Automotion. There were some funny 
and some really flamed responses. So this will be a best of the best 
(or worst). Thanks again for your inputs.

These are the results of the Automotion survey:


price:    	100% felt they were WAY-OVER priced.

    some examples:
        
        944 cam tension tool, found@ $380.,  AM $500.00
	B. Anderson's book,   found@ $18.95, AM $24.95
	911 oil filters,      found@ $8.00,  AM $10.95
	911 dics,t/o, p-plate found@ $469.,  AM $800.00
	suspension pans       found@ $189.,  AM $300+ support pieces you
                                                      don't get but need.
        Too many examples here......

  "The Secret" Only buy during 20-25% off sells (90% responded this way).
               Bottom line was still shop around even during a sale.

knowledge:   90% felt it was great. Although it did vary with sales rep.

customer service: Most every felt it was good. 85% 
		  But on suggestions to add or fix there parts: Not good. 
		  Most never have seen a change or ever heard back from
		  them on their request.
		  "I purchased an expensive (.031) distributor from them

                   meaning a trip to the dealer, who, of course doesn't stock
                   it, but can special order it, meaning a second trip back 
                   to the dealer when it came in.  I wrote Automotion a nice 
                   letter telling them this, and suggesting they include this

At around 3000 rpm I am getting a bit of hesitation, slightly noticeable

3d but notice a little in 1st and 4th.  5th ok.  Its almost like a pause 
in the acceleration.  Like somethings missing a beat.
 
Any ideas?  Could it be the valve adjustment? (Due in couple thousand 
miles).  Oil checks ok.  And at higher rpm, no problem.  Just around the 
3000 - 3200 mark.

     Hello all,
     
     I had just returned from a track day on Friday, when I noticed a loud

Subject: 911 Storage

Porschephiles,

I am soon to leave Baltimore for a year in the Netherlands, and I was wondering
how best to store my '73 911T. The car has 130,000 miles, although with a
recently-rebuilt engine (3 years ago, 10,000 miles). I presently drive it
daily, 3 miles to and from work.

The 911 will spend the year in an unheated but fairly well-insulated garage. I
plann to remove the battery. What else should I do? What do I need to worry
about when I return next summer and start it for the first time?

  The oil leaks were deliberately engineered so that the 928 would still have
 something in common with a 911...Actually replacing the seals around the 
 front of the cam is pretty easy and pretty common (if the oil is around the
 front of the engine its probably these).  Of course it does require removing
 the cam gears and belt, which means that you'll have to retime the cams;  
 again, this is pretty easy. I never have used a tensioner on the timing
 belt, at least for my year a total failure of the belt still leaves positive
 clearance between valves and piston (unlike a 944 and possibly the later 
 928s), you may want to ask if this is true for the S. A shop will probably 
 charge $450 for the entire job.

  Head gaskets are also a cinch to replace on a 928...that is, if you can get
 off the cam housings, which are a nightmare job. The cam housings are held on
 by a bunch of allen-headed bolts, half of them you can see. We ended up
 pulling the motor to get the cam towers off.
   All this is okay if you already own the car or just love to get greasy, but
 before I'd buy a car for value I'd have the seller fix these things if you 
 like the car. Secondly, head gaskets don't blow on their own and I'd review
 whether the radiator has been replaced (these don't last for some reason).

Subject: Fiberglass parts

Hi all!

I bought some rear 914/6 GT flares for my car from Automotion (during one of 
their 20% off sales!) and had some fun trying to attach them to my car.  
No instructions or cutting templates were supplied, just 2 white fiberglass 
flares inside a plastic bag.  When I tried to lay them against my car, I 
found that the curvature of the flare no where near matched my car.  I 
realize that older cars, particularly 914's, are not perfect but this was 
*WAY* off.

I phoned them back and asked if they had any cutting templates or anything 
like that which may help the installation process and I was told "All 
fiberglass parts require some fitting."

If you ever consider buying any fiberglass parts to attach to your car, make 
sure you know what you're doing.  These fenders are going to need a lot of 
work.  They weren't designed properly, weren't made to "just glass in 
place!", and weren't made for the novice installer.  I've just started the 
process of putting these on, which has meant drilling holes about every inch 
along the edge of the flares and *GRADUALLY* tightening the screws over a 3 
week period to get the flares to conform to my car without cracking the 
fiberglass.  I bought a heat gun which I'm going to use to soften the 'glass 
a bit in order to relieve the stress.  These flares must attach to the car 
"stress free" in order to avoid unsightly cracks in the paint a few years 
down the road.

At the same time I also bought a rear spoiler for the car and am running into 
the same problems.

This problem isn't just limited to just Automotion....I've read many "good" 
things about the quality of Mitcom parts but this is crap also.  I have the 
front of a Chalon kit from them to prove it.

Be careful out there....

Yes, removing the distributo did indeed help.  I rotate the engine until 
the rotor is pointing at the slot and the crank pulley is at TDC, and
I make a scratch mark on the distributor to further line it up with.  
Taking these steps helps make certain that you get it in the right way 
the first time - i learned the hard way and had to spend some time 
chasing the timing!

As fot the A/C bracket, I can't help you.  My A/C bracket is in the front
of the car, the one that holds the top on.... :)

Alex. Perhaps the temp gauge read "hot" all the time, so someone just cut
the wire so it wouldn't look bad.
I guess you have to check the sensor and the gauge-you know the wire is ok now.
The heater blower goes on when the red lever on the floor is pulled back.
Check for switch (at lever), relay (on
relay plate), or blower motor malfunction. I would suspect relay first off.
Trying jumpering the terminals in the relay plate to see if the motor goes
on (ignition must be on, but engine doesn't have to be running.) Sometimes
just tapping the relay hard will "fix" it (not too hard). Also, you can
swap the all the relays on the plate, and for the
headlight motors too.
The blower motor in front may have a burned-out resistor, since typically
this is how the voltage is varied, but I disremember exactly how this
works. 
You may be in for some fun- you have to remove the fuel tank to remove the
blower motor. Michael

Hello p-philers:

First, I'm looking for some info on repacking the wheel bearings on my '87 951. 
   1) How much time involved?
   2) Any special tools needed?
   3) Can a wheel bearing repack kit bought previously at Trak Auto (for a non  
      p-car) be used to do the job, or are there p-car specific materials I need
      to use?
   NOTE: This will probably be done in conjunction with removing the dust       
         shields
   
Second, what is the recommended interval for changing the Cam (timing) Belt? 
I've heard both 30K and 45K.  Should this interval be shortened if the car is
used for Auto-X and track events?


P.S. Please sign me up for the Share-A-Cam belt tightening tool club. On Sunday,
I watched someone in an '86 951 either break or slip a tooth in his cam belt
during an AutoX for the Potomac region.  Not a pretty sound...

Techron in big letter bottles are a safer bet.

I think mike's point was that in 915 transmissions at least the Tranny
DOES NOT LIKE TO BE RUSHED at all, if you ever try and quick shift a
915 it'll get grumpy and bitch and moan, and grind. Putting in a short
shift kit by definition will speed up shifts, making the probability
that you'll grind the box even higher. I'm not a know all mechanic but
in my book nasty-noises equals BAD.

Nate,

Yes, you should have great concern. get it out of there pronto if you think
your coolant has ANY caustic agent in it. Phosphorous is one aluminum doesn't
stand up to with heat and water added.

Any cooling system these days has some aluminum in it. Many water supplies have
high mineral content with some phosphorous. This is where using distilled 
water makes economic sense, mixing with something like Prestone or any first
line anti-freeze. Ceck the contents on the label. If you aren't sure, stick to
a major brand.

I've seen many cars where the alumimum Thermostat housing has disintegrated from
this type of corrosion.

Subject: 914 Rear window and Front Suspension 

Hello again from the sub-tropical rain forests of North Carolina!!!

I've got the car running really well now, but there are a few lingering 
details that still are a bit nagging.... Like 3" of water on the floor in 
the morning!!  My back window is very loose and rattles all the time.  I 
suspect it is also responsible for a large part of the water on my 
floor.  Does anyone have any ideas on what I can fix here???  The 
exterior gasket at the bottom of the window is old, and it is not obvious 
how to replace it. (I would also like to quiet the glass down a bit!!!)  I 
also have water dripping off  the bottom of my dash board during heavy rain.  
Where is it coming from???  any guesses????

My next question has to do with the height of the front suspension.  My 
front end measures in about right according to the book (Wheel radius - 
90mm+/-5mm (3.54in) measured at the pivot).  I have the stock tires on 
and the radius measures 12".  The pivot is about 8.6" off the ground, 
but the front looks much higher than any other 914 I have seen.  There is 
about 1" of space from the top of the tire to the top of the wheel well.  
Every picture I look at has the top of the front wheels under(inside) the 
fender.  Am I missing something??  

The last question I would like to keep simple.  I need new tires.  I use 
the car as a semi-daily driver.  I do not want to put alot of $$$ into 
tires, but the 165s are a tad boring.  Are there any moderate budget 
tires that work well on the 914??  I know, I am full of questions today, 
but I really appreciate  any help I can get.  Thanks 
again.

I have a very pristine 1980 911 SC Targa with almost 100,000 miles.  Very
little work ever done on it and it runs like a Swiss Watch.  I am still
running on the original Bilstein shocks.  I'm told that they do not yet
need replacing but I think the time will come soon.  What is the current
thought on whether or not to replace with conventional shocks or gass
filled.  There is a fairly big price difference.  I drive about 5000 miles
a year around town and on trips of less that 5 hours (interstate).  I
drive the car fairly hard, as it should be, but I take care of it.  Should
I sport for big bucks for gas shocks?

I took a chance and stored my 1980 911sc targa in my father in laws garage
in Indiana, not heated but (more or les) insulated.  Took the battery out,
filled it with super premium gas, capped everything, tires to 60 psi,
covered.  In the spring, I put it all back together, it cranked right up,
drove fine except the clutch slipped.  Repeated freezing and thawing of
water vapor dilated the main bearing and allowed oil into the clutch. 
Cost me $800.00.  Also there was standing water in all the motor oil

Subject: Mystery black 'filter' on '78 911 SC

Another 'what the heck is that thing' question...

Attached to the upper RH side of the engine compartment on my '78 '911 
SC is a black plastic canister that is mounted horizontally.  It looks 
like there may be a couple of lines feeding in from the back.  It sits 
in back of the oil filler neck and the deck lid hinge.  It also has a 
fitting on the front (facing the rear of the car, where i can see it) 
that looks like it should accept a hose approx. 1/2" in dia.

Question 1:  What is the canister,  what does it do
Question 2:  Should there be a hose coming out of that fitting, 
possibly connected to the air box.  I also noticed that there is a 
fitting approx the same size on the rh side of the airbox that doesn't 
have anything connected to it.

Thanks for the help.

While I'm the *last* person likely to come to the aid of Asshole Atlanta,
you gotta realize something: you're dead wrong here...

The part you bought was *NEVER* designed by the factory, there are no
molds for it, so someone took a casting off of a 914/6 GT and *maybe*
your parts came from molds made from casting parts taken from that original 
mold or maybe you're off by a zillion generations. Not to mention possible
problems with heat distortion, improper curing or mold distortion...

Such body modifications are *NOT* "easy do it yourself" projects, unless
your day job happens to be doing paint and body. Even on our production
and GT racers, which are almost *ALL* fiberglass, the parts were shit
until I made our own molds and now have a place in Pasadena (TX, not CA)
that *ususally* makes boats do the lay-up and finish on them...

I've had problems with *EVERY* aftermarket fiberglass piece I've ever
bought for every kind of car imaginable with *ONE* exception: the
fiberglass front kick panels for mounting speakers in VW Beetles made
by some place in San Antonio... and they're now out of business!

Yup....my flares prove that!  You know how the quarter panel both fore and 
aft of the rear tire is relative flat and straight?  My flares *BEND OUTWARD* 
at the fore and aft sides....that's OUTWARD AWAY FROM THE CAR!!!  The 'glass 
is thick...about 1/8 - 3/16" thick too - not fun to try to bend flat.  Oh 
yeah, at the far edges of the flare where you are supposed to "blend" the 
flare into the car with bondo, the flare was about 3/4" in the air!!!

>Such body modifications are *NOT* "easy do it yourself" projects, unless

Everybody - believe what Stan says.....I thought maybe I was having a hard 
time because I don't know what I'm doing; that's probably true, but it's also 
nice to know that I'm "normal" and that this is what you get when you buy 3rd 
party fiberglass parts instead of nice, factory-designed metal flares that 
weld on (I'm sure these are difficult enough!)

Tracy,
That Porsche 944 is going to need a clutch.  In the Washington, D.C. area, we
eat up our clutches at about 50,000 miles, on average, thanks to heavy rush
hour traffic.  A Porsche clutch replacement is expensive because so much
labor is involved.

I have the full set of Sports Car International magazines for sale.

Starts with the Premier issue from Nov '85 (when it was called Sports
Car Illustrated) and goes up through the current issue.  96 issues in
all (it was approx. bi-monthly when it first started).

All are in excellent condition and still have the various posters or
other give-aways on the inside.  (The ONLY problem is that the premier
issue has the subscription form cut out of the page).

If you follow SCI's back issue prices, this collection is worth at
least $400, plus whatever markup for being a complete set (about
thirty of these are no longer available as back issues).  I'm not
trying to make money here, just let someone else have them.  So any
reasonable offer will be considered (you pay shipping from Oregon).

If you buy the entire batch, you also get 22 more exotic car mags:
R&T Sports and GT Cars, 1987
Consumer Guide, Elite Cars, Sept 87
Consumer Guide, Elite Cars, Jan 88
R&T Exotic Cars 6, 1987
R&T Exotic Cars 4, 1986
Automobile Extra, Spring 87
Consumer Guide Corvette Portfolio (~88)
and:
Almost the complete run of Superauto Illustrated.  I have Vol 1 #1
through the final issue, Vol 2, #11, with exception of V1#3&4.  This
is 15 more magazines on exotic cars.


All 118 magazines go to the highest bidder.

Oh, the weld-on guys are hard too.... to do it right, first you have someone
help you hold them in place, then you go around the rim about 2" in
with a drill and rivet gun, riveting the flare in place. When you're
happy with the location, you then take a thin cutter, and cut through
the flare and the body in one motion so you'll have a close fitting
seam to butt-weld with your MIG welder.... Then there's the weld
dressing and the final smoothing with body putty. Figure that it takes
you about a day per flare once you're good at it. 

Another reason that body shop work, at the $17-23/hr "flat rate" rate,
is one of the biggest bargains around!

P.S. we just did three original 914-6s at Ghost Racing last year, using
original steel flares. It was STILL a mondo pain in the ass!

I bought a Mitcom duck tail (directly from Mitcom, saved $$$) and I had a

That's where surfboard shaping experience comes in handy!

I think you would probably want to use a sureform and shave the flares,
rather than bend them.  All you are probably doing is bending the metal and
the 'glass, and you really don't want to do that - it will haunt you
later.  Once you are close, you can use 80 or 100 grit to fine tune the fit.

My advice is to pack up the 911 and bring it with you. If you are going
to be based in the Netherlands then bring the 911 home: Stuttgart, the excellent
European road network (except the UK), the unrestricted autobahn, the Swiss Alps,
Bavaria are all calling out "Tom, Tom, don't leave the wheels at home". Seriously,
a 911 is the best way to get around Western Europe, this is what it was

No no no ....
This noise is a very typical 944 feature. Regardless of the condition of the
clutch, this noise will be there on some 944:s and not on some others.
Believe me, I've owned my 84 since new, the noise is also there since new and
the clutch is still the original one.In the beginning, I worried a bit about it
and inquired to the factory. I was told that this noise is coming from the
gearbox, but is generated by clutch center vibrations transmitted via the
transaxle. Now with 140 k miles on the car and still the same clutch/gearbox I
don't worry any more.
                     Good luck, Tommy.

	- the fresh air blower motor

	- the switch that controls it - which is between
	the front seats - the red tipped lever.

The relay was fine - or at least replacing it with a known good one didn't
make a difference.

I then disconnected the fresh air fan from the wire harness and conected it
directly to the battery - it came on!!  

Then I pulled the lever out from between the seats.  That was a real pain
with the center console is in the way.  As per instructions I received from
porschephiles the wire to the lever is 'hot'.  All the switch does is ground
it.  Well, when I shorted the switch to ground with a piece of wire the
blower came on.  That was it.

So, I will call Mid Engine Mania and order a new switch.  Hopefully they
aren't really expensive.

The next question is how to replace the switch.  There is also a cable on it
 - how does that come off?

Subject: Need Help! with Undercoat Removal

Hello all.

I'm into a semi-serious rust-repair job on my 911.  I need to remove LOADS
of that good German firm-but-flexible undercoating from the inside of a
fender.  Has anyone had luck sandblasting this stuff off?  Will sandblasting
cut this stuff or will it just bounce off?  Are there any wonder chemicals
that I can use to dissolve it away?

By the way, *Hans* at the Porsche body shop didn't do such a great job of 
undercoating my left front fender.  I'm glad I got into this before it rusted
completely thru...  I looked up the cost of a new OEM fender... Yikes!  If you
have any doubts about your rustproofing, I suggest a *close* inspection.  Mine
looked fine in most places until I got it apart.

Thanks for the advice!

Hi All!,   Sorry to be a pain, but our internet connection was 
up and down all last week and I have been unable to receive mail 
since then. 
Could someone forward me a copy of the digest for last week? 

On the 914 front, I went ahead and took the pressure sensor apart to 
have a looksee ( since it wasn't holding a vacuum I figured I 
couldn't make things any worse :) ).  It turns out that the copper 
diaphragm in the back half was splitting around the edges.  So yep, I 
guess the pressure sensor is hosed.... 

So here is my next question....

Will the same diaphragm from another pressure sensor work as a
replacement because I know where I can lay my hands on 5 or 6
doner sensors with different part numbers from other cars that are in 
good shape. It appears the sensors are all about the same externally 
so my one fear is that this diaphragm is what distinguishes them from 
each other.  - OR -  Is there a source for replacement / rebuild 
parts where I can get a new diaphragm?

It just seems ludicrous to me to have to pay $200 for a new sensor
when all I need is a cheesy 50 cent metal disk to repair my current 
one!

Hi, Lyle. I ain't no gentleman (ask Harry Pellow), I'm an engineer.
 
I sold all three of the space savers I had. Good news/bad news: you missed

Tom,

Sounds like a great assignment, why don't you take the 911 with you?

But WRT your question, I'd put the car on Jack Stands so that the tires don't 
flat-spot.  I'm not sure if it's necessary with boxer engines, but I seem to 
recall reading that it's normal practice in storing any ( other ) internal 
combustion engine is to drain oil, remove plugs, and squirt a few drops of light
motor oil into each cyl.  Maybe Stan or the Maestro, or Peter Albrecht might 
care to correct/elaborate.

This brings up another question:  Does driving a 911 3 miles to work, then 3
miles home again do the engine any good?  I would think that leaving it in
the garage and taking it for a nice drive on Saturday and/or Sunday would be
better.  How truly warmed up can that case of oil circulating around in there
get in only 3 miles?  Now, no cracks from you track people out there!

Charles, go to the library and pick up the latest issue of the Intellichoice
car buying book. Most libraries keep it hidden in the reference section or
behind the librarian's desk, it's so popular.
 
You'll find that the 911 Speedster has the highest retained value after five
years of any car in the sports car class, 65%, based on blue book estimates.
A few cars are rated higher, but they're things like Suzuki Swift (66
percent of nothing is still nothing), Toyota Paseo 66%, Acura Integra RS
71%, Honda Civic CX 69%, Toyota Camry DX 68%, Honda Accord LX/DX 71%, Lexus
LS 400 67%, BMW 325 iC 65%, Lexus ES 300 65%.   In the sports car class, the
other two are the 911 Carrera 2 Cabriolet also at 65% and the
Mitsubishi 3000 GT at 64%.  Intellichoice also rated the Speedster, C2 Cab
and Mitsu 3000 GT as the best overall values in the sports car class above
$25K.

     My '88 944 has a tapping/clacking sound also.  It comes and goes,
       varies with brand of fuel, doesn't vary with oil change, and doesn't
       affect performance and mileage when present.  I suspected
       valves/worn guides/lifters but...it isn't consistent enough to
       trouble shoot, isn't accompanied by exhaust smoke at start up or
       accelleration/deceleration so I'm living with it.  It once got
       louder with a Techron dosage and once got quieter???.
     My neighborhood porsche mechanic (Minh Nguyen in Alexandria, VA)
       speculates that it -could- be carbon buildup on the exhaust valves.
       And that the clacking could be the uneven surface of the valves
       smacking the valve seats.  Various fuels cushion this impact to
       varying degrees.  Likewise, anything that cleans carbon deposits in
       the combustion chamber is changing the relationship between the
       valves and their seats - therefore, an additive may make it worse or
       better.  The fuel mixture was very,very rich before I bought the car
       and wasn't corrected for a few months after.
     Does all this sound plausible?  Minh and I agree that disassemble and

	I'm looking at '87 to '89 (i.e. G50) Carrera 3.2 911s and have a
couple of (trivial) questions.

Alarms:
======

	I understand (I think!) that the "System 2" alarm came standard
with the 89MY, and that this just closes the central locking and measures
current drop. Interior ultrasonics were available as an upgrade. True?

	It was possible to upgrade to a "System 1" alarm, which has total
closure (i.e., doors, windows, sunroof). True?

	Can a System 2 be upgraded to a System 1 retrospectively?

	Do either of these alarms immobilise the car? (I know that you can
also get a Porsche immobiliser fitted for about 350 pounds in the UK).

	Are there any other options available (microwave, battery backup,
interior siren, tilt sensor, etc.) on either alarm?

	How do the Porsche alarms compare with the better after-market
(Scorpion, Cobra, Clifford, Gemini) alarms?

	Are the Porsche alarms made by Porsche, or are they just rebadged
from an alarm maker?

Calipers:

	Which brake calipers have the word "Porsche" on them? Was it only
turbo (and turbo-look/SuperSport) cars, or do 89 MY cars have it?

Subject: Re: 911 Storage

Hi Tom,

Like many car nuts here in the frozen north (Boston area), I store my car
every winter. It's a 944 but the pieces of advice that I want to share are
independant of the engine location or cooling system design.

First, get a large clear polyethylene tarp (fairly heavy gage and NOT one
of the blue ones) and put it down on the floor before you drive into the
garage. The accumulated water I see each year between the plastic and the
floor confirms that a surprising amount of moisture comes up through the
floor. From my pre-plastic years I can tell you it can lay a heavy (even to
the point of pitting) layer of rust on your brake rotors and probably some
other stuff that you'd prefer to find in good shape upon your return. I
find that in the spring my rotors are dramatically different due to the
tarp effectively deflecting the rising moisture outwards to the perimeter
of the garage. It really works!

Another thing you might do is go to a carpet store and buy four carpet
samples. They're usually about doormat sized and can be had in mixed colors
for a few bucks each. Put them on top of the poly-tarp such that they
cushion your tires from contact with the hard floor. It will somewhat
reduce the flat spot that your tires develop when stored for extended
periods. Besides your car will feel pampered and possibly will not resent
you going off for a year without so much as a postcard.

Finally there is a product called Stor-n-Start that you mix with your
gasoline. It's a fuel stabilizer that boaters and RV types put in their
tanks prior to extended storage to keep the gas from breaking down and
gumming up the fuel system. You may find other brands that are for the same
purpose and that's OK too. Put it into the tank enough miles before you
actually put the car away so that it will have a chance to work through
from the tank to the carbs or FI system.

Good luck,

Don

REPRINT FROM NORD STERN SEP 87 WINTER STORAGE HOW TO PREPARE YOUR CAR By
Neil Goldberg & Wayne Kadrovach From: Porsche Pushers Private Papers 1.
Change Oil 2. Do not wash the car on the day you put it in storage. The
car should be washed and driven a couple of days before storage to get
water out of parts, like inside the doors. I always recommend that a car
be driven after every wash.  3. Put 45 lbs. air in the tires.  4. Fill gas
tank and put a can of Sta Bil in the tank to stabilize the gas during
storage. (Sta Bil is available at marine and lawnmower shops.) 5. Put a
light coat of Vaseline on doors, trunk and other rubber to protect it.
Vaseline can be used on your alloy wheels also.  6. Disconnect battery or
pull fuse for clock to prevent battery drain. If your car has a burglar
alarm, DO NOT set it unless you charge the battery every 3 to 4 weeks. The
alarm will drain the battery when on.  7. 928, 924, 944 check anti-freeze. 
8. Check window washer anti-freeze.  9. Use a good grade of leather
treatment on leather to prevent drying of leather.  10. Leave doors and
trunk ajar.  11. Block Windshield wipers off window.  12. Put the car in a
gear instead of using the emergency brake.  13. Once a month, push your
car a couple of feet forward or backward so the tires won't get a flat
spot on them.  14. Push the clutch in once a month.  15. If you start the
car, make sure the car is at a normal operating temperature before
shutting off. I do not recommend running the engine because a warm engine
creates wate condensation when it cools down.

I lived in new england with my 911 for a few years and always put the car

I would put in fresh oil and filter, change the brake fluid, put gas stabilizer
in the fuel tank, run the engine for a few minutes and disconnect the fuel pump
to empty the injection system a little.  (I did not run the car long cause I
did not want to warm up the engine and start any condesnation process with the
new oil).  Then put the car on blocks (after I cleaned, waxed and armoralled),
disconnected the battery, covered it with a tan flannel car cover.

Once a month I put a trickle charger on the battery, gave the wheels a spin
and that was it.  In the spring, I put the car down, fired it up, then
changed the oil and was off.  Never had a problem.

I also did this with motorcycles for many years in detached unheated, uninsulated
garages and never had a problem.

If you want to keep your 911 looking its best, it is worth putting it away in the
winter.  Now that I am in California, I don't have that problem.  I actually drive

1   Does the throwout bearing always ride against the clutch?
By design it seems to, but my throwout arm oscilates while the
engine is running and that bothers me.

2   How deep do you seat the rear main (case-to-flywheel) seal?
My clutch was fouled with oil from the rear main seal. The
seal I installed 2000 miles ago was from a Tweeks "seal kit"
and was thinner than the old one (same i.d. & o.d.). I drove
the seal to the bottom of the hole and i think that caused the
leak. Should it be installed "flush"?

3   Different subject; Here in Colorado (thin air, hot summer)
my oil gets pretty hot while driving in the mountains. I would
like to install another oil cooler to help out. I have a cooler
and a thermostat (170 degree) and would be willing to install
a fan with a thermostat on it, but I cant find a good place to
put it. I dread having to run lines to the front and I dont 
think it is safe in the wheel well, so where? Also, what is the
best place to tap into the oil flow? 

Thanks in advance for your wisdom.

Subject: Targa window tinting

I have the rear Targa window off my 72T and I'm thinking
of getting it tinted via window film.

As discussed in Bruce Anderson"s book, the rear Targa window is difficult
to tint with film because of its complex curvature.

I'll probably use the shop pictured in Anderson's 
book, which is "California Auto Tinting and Polishing".

Their quote was for US$150.00, with the window out of the car.

Could anyone with SPECIFIC experience with professionally installed
film tinted Targa rear windows comment on:

    In retrospect, was it worth it?

    Has it held up over the years?

    Has anyone any experience (good/bad) with 
    "California Auto Tinting and Polishing"?

    Does anyone have any good/bad experience with Targa windows and
    other Northern California based auto tinting shops?

There are probably many porschphiles with no interest in window
tinting.

To try and cut down list "noise", I would like direct e-mail responses
to me.  

It will get the information to me faster and avoid unnecessary junk e-mail
sent to the list at large.

I'll summarize responses and send the summary to those who request it.

If I get more than 15 requests, the summary will be posted to the entire
list.

Thanks.

This is my first message in the group.  The subject is pretty unpleasant and I
think I know what the answer will be, but here goes.  My '71 911 T Targa has
oil droplets coming out of the exhaust.  It runs well otherwise.  My guess is
that the valve guides or rings (oh no!) are worn.  Please give your input on
what you think it might be.  If I'm going to take the engine out (again!) what
other upgrades/replacements would you recommend?  My car has 125k on it
(if you believe the previous owner) and supposedly a rebuilt engine.  I've read
that I might want to replace the chain tensioners.?  Also, where is a good
place to buy reproduction restoration parts, such as the door pockets, targa
weather seal, etc?  I live near Automotion and they seem expensive.  I've spent
around $2,500 in parts in three years and many hours of labor on this car and
had the engine out a few times to work on the transmission, so I feel like a
true porsche owner.  The possible engine work I think I'm facing will round me
out I guess!  Thanks in advance. John.

This Halliday & Resnick stuff is getting old. It doesn't apply to tires
on asphalt - there are too many second-order effects that the basic physics
and mechanics texts consider (probably correctly) to be too complicated for
freshmen.

Rubber on asphalt actually expereiences an increase in coefficient of friction
with slip, up to about 5% to 15% slip, depending on the compound and 
construction. The physical explanation of this effect is that the 
irregularities in the road surface are ripping loose little chunks of rubber,
which requires more work than simple sliding. More work requires more force,
and the force which does the work shows up as traction in the automotive
application. Beyond the slip limit for a given tire, there is too much
skipping action, where the rubber isn't in good contact with the asphalt.

As for the non-linear coefficient of friction with load, that's also true.
Load the tire more, and its cF goes down. Not by as much as the load goes
up, so yes you get a net gain of traction at that tire, but if the load 
increase is due to weight transfer, you lose more traction on the unloaded
tire than you gain on the loaded tire. As Mike pointed out, that's why
stiffening the swaybar on one end of a car will make that end break loose
sooner. The best physical explanation I've seen for this is that when the
rubber loads up more, it squirms around the road surface irregularities in
preference to getting ripped loose, which requires less work that getting
ripped loose does.

Mike's question about wider tires having better grip, "all else equal",
also has a pretty direct answer, which depends on the decrease of cF with
load. A narrower tire has a load profile across the width that is much steeper
and with a higher peak than a wider tire. The area with the higher peak load
has a lower cF as a result, which gives the tire as a whole less traction.

Thanks to all who passed on good advice last week about mixing different
models of tires on a 928. Net consensus was: mixing tires fore and aft
is fine, mixing tires left and right is a loser. I guess I knew that,
but it's nice to have it reiterated.

So I went out and bought two new rear tires and kept the old (different
model, same manufacturer) on the front. Or thought I did. Long story. 
Some day I'll tell you about it. Right now I don't know whether to

You have just described a typical double-clutch downshift.
For an upshift, the throttle-blip is either eliminated (if your timing
is perfect) or greatly reduced, since the target rpm is lower.

I use a flanging tool to create a step flange that the flare sits on top

manner is easier and stronger than a butt-weld. And I do a lot less
grinding and filling.  Another bonus is that you don't have to use rivets...

I still use a MIG welder though - can't beat it.

I am currently using this technique to weld a factory sunroof into my

Sorry, at the time, I didn't pay attention.  However, my oil temp seems

Subject: 914 1.8 for sale

It is with great regret that i'm putting my '74 914 1.8 up for sale. 
The car is located in Rochester, NY, but it had spend its life in New Mexico
until last fall. The selling price is $3700 OBO.

It's good points are:
Solid Body, no modifications, orig. Fuel injection
professional, complete engine rebuild by Hans Whittler's Autohaus in
Albuquerque for $2500 last year and 10k miles ago
complete clutch job 12k miles ago
New window and trunk seals

Not so good:
The car was once Saturn Yellow and has been painted over several times with
red. Sanding it off and returning to its original color would make it much
nicer. Transmission needs patience for downshift into 3rd and 1st gears, i.e.
old syncros. Unknown total mileage. Rear trunk lock covered with reflector 
plate.

general:
It has the 'styled steelwheels' with standard 165 tires in mid-life. The
interior shows some age but has no major sore points, excepts the seats do
look nicer under a cover. I've owned the car since fall 1990 and used as a
reliable daily driver, except for last winter, when it was garaged. It has been
meticuously maintained and can go on long trips. 
The reason for the sale is that i got a job offer on the Canary Islands.
Shipping the car over there and getting it through the spanish bureaucracy is
too much trouble and $$$. If interested, send email to 
hjdpci@borg.cis.rit.edu or call 716-475-7061.

Yes, movement along the axis of the half-shaft is normal.  You have the
same CV at both ends, so what floats at the hub will float at the diff.
The lack of play in the turning direction really doesn't guarantee much.
If your car makes CV noise, it's probably time for a tear-down.

Dunno about the turbo's, but it's pretty easy on the normally aspirated
cars.  You obviously have to remove the lower rad hose.  Aside from
that the only difficulty I had getting to the circlip was that it had
been assembled on the bench (I'd have to say), and the circlip was
turned to the worst possible position for in-car removal.

Porsche changed the thermostat and how it fits into the water pump,
adding a spacing rubber washer behind it.  Make sure
you have the right kit for your car, which will be a matter
of getting the p/n off whatever version water pump you have in it.

John,
That good german undercoating is indeed tough.  You will not have luck
sandblasting if off (you can't even Shout it out).  There aren't any
chemicals, that I know of, that are safe to work with at a home.  Your best
bet is to find a loose area and get under it with a broad chisel or stiff
putty knife and attempt to peal it off.  This is easier said than done.  The
good news is that it peels most easily from the rusted areas.
Good luck!

Subject: Re: Proportioning valves

John,

A proportioning valve decreases marginal pressure to the rear circuit
above a certain threshold.  Up to that threshold, you get 100% of
the master cylinder fluid pressure at both the front and rear callipers.
Above that threshold, you get some fraction of each addition PSI
fluid pressure, in the rear circuit.

The reason for the need for a proportioning valve is weight transfer.
The harder you brake, the more weight is transferred to the front
axle, from the rear.  By rolling off rear ciruit pressure, there is
a lessened chance of rear brake lock-up.  By the way, if you have to
favour locking one end over the other, it's better to lock the fronts.

Without a proportioning valve, your brakes have what amounts to a
straight-line approximation to a curve representing the ideal roll-
off.  With the valve, you get a pretty good approximation to this
curve.

It might occur to you that weight transfer will lessen if a car is
stopping on a less grippy surface, esp. a wet one.  This is quite
true, and is why you'll hear of race drivers tuning their proportioning
valve setting when it's raining.

The numbers on Porsche's proportioning valves are as follows.  The
first number is the change-over pressure, in bar (atmosphere).  The
second is the reduction factor, with a value of "5" apparently really
meaning .46.

Someone recently made the point that regular driving keeps any water
in your brake lines mixed with your brake fluid, and that without
regular driving the water will collect at the bottom of the brake
lines (i.e. at your brake cylinders) and corrode your brake cylinders.

So it would seem wise to give your brakes a good bleeding too if you

First of all :

Thanks to all those who gave me advice on how to change the brake pads on my
86 928.  The job was quite simple, having all the advice that I got.  The
only tough part was removing all of the excess brake dust.  The local
dealership wanted $250 for a set of pads, so I went to UAP and got a set for
$50.  I hope I did the right thing.

Now the real story :

I need a new spoiler for the front of the car.  The local dealership wants
$700 for a new one.  I have seen others offered for about $350 (US).  Does
anyone have any advice as to where I should purchase a new spoiler.  If I
have to get it via mail-order, I can go to the States to pick it up to save
the outragous taxes.

Any advice would be appreciated.

A sureform is a tool that is essentially a cheese grater for fiberglass,
wood, and other relatively soft materials (as opposed to metal).
Stanley (the tool company) makes a good one.  The small ones, like
you need, are around $5, and replacement blades are about $2.
They have larger ones as well, but I don't have the prices handy.

Basicly, yes. Get the right tool, and use it! Then you'll know that

Get used to the idea of running lines to the front. That's what 911s
do, so how bad an idea can it be? For racers, I advocate cutting the
floor out of the front trunk and mounting your cooler there, with a
fan blowing *DOWN* over it (thermostat activated). Pull the big rubber
plugs on the valance behind the front bumper for air flow. For
civilian cars, I dunno -- don't do much with them these days. Might
be possible to hang a cooler in a 911-ish position in front of the
right front tire. I'd avoid any mount-under-the-front-valance schemes,
since it's oil all over the place if you hit something...

Where to tap -- only one place unless you do some case surgery: get
a spin-on adapter and replace the oil filter with it, then run lines
from the engine to the front, and locate the oil filter adapter there,
along with the cooler. 

One word of advice: make *DAMNED* sure the line you choose is good for
300 degrees and 200 PSI. The black "oil line" you get at PEP Boys or
the VW performance shops is rated at 200 degrees and 100 PSI. I've blown
them. It's ugly. Not sure if its uglier to do so blazing into Turn One
or in the driveway.... Much better to put in the blue nylon-braided Aeroquip
rubber lines or similar (note this is NOT the steel-braided Aeroquip
everyone makes such a big deal about).

One more word of advice: if you love your 914, and you run it hard,
this is also the time to put in an Accusump and a *REAL* oil filter.
Our tests show that with sticky tires, you generate enough G-forces
in an average autox to make the oil pump cavitate (i.e. pump air instead
of oil) several times. The Accusump keeps that from ever being a problem,
as it maintains oil pressure to the bearings at all times. As to the oil
filter, it's also a great time to a Canton/Meca 4 micron cartridge based
oil filter. I've had mine filter out all sorts of metal from chunked
bearings and cams, saving the expensive hard parts (ever price Carillo
rods? How about custom cranks? Just wondering...). Both of these products
are available from racing supply houses like Racer's Wholesale, Pegasus,
etc.

This could be, alas, a number of things, and I won't pretend to know
the answer.  I've seen SC's develop odd mid-range hesitations because
of a bad plug or plug wire, and because of a bad fuel distributor, to

Subject: Summary: 944 - how hot is your engine?


Thanks for all the replies on my question.  
The original question was, basically, how hot does your 944 engine run?  
Where does the temperature gauge ride on various traffic conditions?

Well, the unanimous answer was that the needle is positioned just above 
the first white marker (or just below the middle) in highway driving.
However, all respondents pointed out that the needle will rise to the top 
white marker during heavy street traffic or while waiting a long time at 
a stop light.  That's what I observe on my 85.5 944.

If your engine is running too hot, Phil Wilson had some advice: 
"Either you need a new thermostat (possibly) or you have a bad temp 
switch (very
likely!). The switch is on the side of the radiator closest to the engine
on the drivers side under the hose.  It is fairly easy to change if you
have a socket or a wrench that will fit it.  New ones are about $20 and
there is a lower temperature one on the market that might be worth looking
for.  Oh, this is the switch that turns on the low speed fans when the
radiator gets too hot. Do your fans come on? "

Again, thanks for all the replies and advice.

Subject: 911 Storage

Tom
   I have a couple of more additions to the 911 storage issue list.  In
addition to topping up the fuel take with stabilzer and dry gas, changing
the oil and filter, I pull the fuel line off and run the carbs and fuel
pump dry.  Next, I pull the spark plugs and with the air cleaners off, I
pour a healthy shot of Marvel Mystery oil into each carb which is sucked
into the cylinders while turning the engine over.  Re-insert the spark
plugs.  
    Come spring wake-up call, I pull the spark plugs, and crank the engine
over for a couple of iterations of 30 plus seconds each.  This will force
the Mystery oil out of the combustion chamber avoiding hydraulic lock (and
broken rings) and circulate oil around the engine in general.  Fire it up
and run it easy.  The Marvel, which is now in the exhaust system, will
smoke for a while, so get it out of the garage PDG.  I believe, that like a
sleepy child, take your time waking you baby up.   

With regard to jack stands, I believe I recall reading that hanging the
wheels in the air for extended periods is tough on the shock absorber seals. 
I use jackstands but the tires lightly touch the ground.  Don, thanks for
the tip on the beneath car polyethylene moisture barrier.  This winter, I will
use instead one of those cheap blue tarps which would last many years and be
more resistant to tearing when rolling the car on/off.

Well since I was removing them anyway to get the engine out, last night
I disassembled the four joints.  None of the looked bad, in fact the
side my local "expert" said was bad looked better than the other "good"
side (it looked to me like it was newer).  On the "bad" side there was
no visible wear on any of the bearings, just some bright spots on the
housing which could not be detected by touch.  On the other ("good")
side there were some dulled spots on the bearings, again not detectable
by touch.  On the housing (the outer ring bit) the bright spots had some
light roughness and pitting in one or two small places.

Whats the best grease to use to repack these ?  Is there a trick to
getting them back together ?

Mike Dayton inquires where the wet dirty full size flat goes, when the space

the list of elemental "tools".  In addition to bagging flats, they keep wet
bathing suits and children off the upholstery, they are emergency raincoats,
emergency snow boots, picnic tablecloths, ground cloths for horizontal ac-
tivities, etc.  I'm told that, like fresh newspapers, they are fairly sterile
right off the roll, so they could even have some first aid uses.  Best of all,
they take up nearly no space while they wait for a job.  Just don't let them
get too hot, or they take up even less space, in a hard to clean up way.

In my other life as a marine aquarist I'm constantly trying to keep

water has high (for marine aquariums) phosphate compounds.  I don't

it.  Tap water of course if going to be high in phosphates, silicates
and other nasties, in my area also has a pH of about 7.8.

The WR3DPO's are the correct plug for a '73 S, replacing the old DP2 plugs.
They have a spiffy side gap configuration...I just put a set in my car, I'll
have to check on them and see how they're doing.  The only downside to these
plugs is they cost $13+ apiece.

My car originally came with heat range 3 Bosch silver plugs (W3CS) - my old
mechanic thought they were a good substitute for the $$$ platinums, if you
could find them.

I recently used NGK gold paladium plugs ($6 apiece) with reasonable results
until one of them had an internal fault and began sparking inside instead of
at the electrode.  That was a bitch to track down...

Hi, Stan.
 
You suggest riveting a steel fender onto a car until you're happy with the
fit. I have a minor improvement on that: use Cleco clamps, available from
aircraft surplus houses. They're about $.25 apiece, the pliers are maybe $5,
and they work like re-usable rivets. So you can redrill and reposition
things quickly, don't have to drill out the old rivets, and then all you
have to do at the end is weld shut the 1/8" holes you would have had to
drill with rivets anyway. They are super neat and are a really big help when
you're fiddling and fitting sheet metal together.
 
When I did the battery box on my daily driver 356, I drove for weeks with
about 30 Clecos holding the thing together at the seams. That was my idea
of rolling restoration; the car was never down for more than 3 hours while I
did the battery box and later a spot under the driver's knees.

pilgrimage, factory tours, factory tech session. Great bunch of people and
as I said they need you.
 
Even if you have to pay sea freight on the thing yourself, in a 20 ft.
container, it's worth it. There should be plenty of car carriers going back
to Europe from Baltimore empty. Ship to Rotterdam or Hamburg or Bremerhaven
and figure on picking it up yourself. (Trains work really well in Europe,
take train to city, cab to dockside or customs or whatever). The fewer people
who have access to your car, the better it will be. See if you can seal the
container yourself and be there for the unsealing.

Subject: Bought a Turbo!!!

Hello everybody!

Much has happened in my Porsche experience since I last sent a message to the
list so I thought I'd post a few update messages and hopefully get some useful
comments and suggestions. This is the first message of several concerning
recent Porsche-related happenings.

About a month ago I bought a 1978 930 that is almost perfect. It's the
stark white color I think is known as Grand Prix White. Is this the correct
name for the color? The car has 42,000 original miles and goes like a bat out
of hell. And I thought normally aspirated Porsches were quick! Geeezzzz!
Unfortunately, it blows a little puff of blue smoke on startup which, from
what I've read, indicates that I'll need to rebuild the turbo soon.
However, I found just what I need for that at the Tweeks swap meet (see my
next message). This car is a blast and other than the common warped leather
dash and a delaminating windshield, it looks like it just came off the
showroom floor. BTW, I paid $24,000 for it which, IMHO, is a pretty good
deal. This car has definitely been pampered and will continue to be.

I'm not sure if the diaphragms are identical. They certianly have
similar external characteristics like size and material thickness,
if I recollect, from several different part number sensors. However,
the biggest problem, and the reason I never did any diaphragm transplants
when I had this problem (on several occasions) is that the diaphragm
seems to be an integral part of the overall calibration of the device
(the calibration is done by the set of concentric threaded pieces
in the center of the diaphragm, as well as by the physical stop formed
by the plug in the case). Unless you have a way to calibrate mutual
inductance as a function of vacuum, and a suitable set of specifications,
I would guess you will end up way off (probably off by more than the
difference between overall sensors from one part number to another,
as my guess). If you are building a "trick" car where you plan
to diddle with all of the adjustments anyway, perhaps on a dynomometer,
then the diaphragm transplant is fine. 

You may want to try some of the other (non-leaking) sensors you have,
rather than transplanting diaphragms from them. I don't know if
anyone has done any semi-serious testing to see how different they
really are. The 914 shop manual gives some data on what sensor part
number goes with what car/brain-box, but doesn't give any "cross-matching"
specs (not surprisingly).

Subject: Calling all sunroof gurus

I could use some advice from all you sunroof experts out there (and I
KNOW there's plenty of you). I've got an '87 944S with a sunroof that's
been wacky since I bought the car about 2 months ago.

I'll refer to the teeth pushing the roof up as 'extend' and and teeth 
retracting as 'retract.' The symptoms are:  
* With key in Pos.2, teeth will not extend to open the roof, but will retract 
  ALL the way, leaving the back end flapping in the wind. 
* In Pos.1, same thing: no extend, but retracts all the way.

My troubleshooting results:
* the switch itself works for sure (bought a new one...see below)
* I drove the sunroof directly from the battery and it retracts AND extends 
  okay (i.e. motor is okay) 
* exchanged the sunroof relay with another & same results (i.e. relay is
  okay)
* all fuses are okay

Interesting notes:
* when test driving the car, the previous owner was able to get the
roof extended, but had problems getting it to retract.  He fiddled with
the switch from behind for about 10 mins and finally it retracted to
the correct point (not all the way back).  I figured, hey, if it works
with a little fiddling it can't be that big of a problem.  Wrong...

* when troubleshooting the switch, a friend made the mistake of opening
it up to look inside.  Out popped some tiny ball-bearings, and it after
closing it again, the switch would not default to the neutral position
 - if pressed up, it would stay up.  Same with down.  So for the next
few days I'd be driving along, and sometimes the shaking of the car
would cause the switch to retract the teeth and all of a sudden I'd see
the roof flapping in the wind.  This happened a few times.
Interestingly, on ONE occaision I was driving and suddenly noticed the
roof was EXTENDED.  Very weird...

* You know the 2 little microswitch 'rollers' back in the motor? The
one on top has 2 connections, and the one on bottom has 3 connections.
These are the little things that let the motor know the position of the
roof, right?  Well, I unscrewed the 2 switches (white) and notice the
bottom one was cracked and one of the connections wasn't making
contact.  Aha! I thought, I've solved the problem! Well, I crazy glued
it together, and I'm 95% sure the switch works like it should, but
after putting it all back together nothing has changed!

I'm out of ideas.  I'm planning on buying a new white roller-switch and
see what happens.  I don't think it'll be any different.  After that
I'll probably succumb to dropping it off to a shop and saying 'fix it.'

Your help is appreciated.

Subject: Undercoating removal

Hi, John.
 
You can sandblast undercoating off, or use a wire brush in a drill. Wear
major safety eye shields; even goggles aren't enough. Maybe wear goggles
under the full-face shield. Plan on getting filthy.
 
The absolute best stuff to use as a replacement is Wuerth (Wu"rth) SKS
Stoneguard, available in black, white, and beige, paintable, a water-soluble
(until it cures) latex product applied with a suction gun. Can be $16-$25 a
quart and you'll need lots of it, maybe 6 qts to do an entire car bottom.
Stoddard has the highest price. Shop around, call Wurth (as it will be in
phone book) and ask about finding a local jobber. The local office here in
California is 1-909-923-2442. They deal mostly to body shops, hard to get in
there as an individual.

I just had the targa top on my 71 911 replaced by Tri Valley Auto Interiors
on Old Santa Rita Rd in Pleasanton, Calif. It cost $525 plus tax.
He used the original materials and replaced both the outer skin and
the headliner.  The guy who did it was the shop owner, Mike. He did a 
nice job. He said that these tops generally last 6-7 years before they
start to split along the fold lines. He had another early 911E in
his shop at the same time (brown coupe) for which he was replacing
all of the carpets. He said that was about a $500 job also.

Not cheap, but hey, it's California.

Three years ago when I rebuilt my 915 transmission I noticed that my 1st gear
brake band was assembled backwards when compared to the picture in the red 
manual (Workshop Manual 911 / Volume IV / from Model on 72 / Assembly group 3)
on page 3.1-8/5 . My transmission hasn't really shifted very well since then.
It often grinds when downshifting and is very difficult to find 1st when
stopped. Here's my question - Does anyone actually have one of these
transmissions apart currently? Or do you definitely remember which way these
parts go?  (By the way, my car is a 1982)

Subject: Automobile Atlanta

I have just placed an order for a set of 7x15 wheels for my 914 from
Automobile Atlanta.  Their catalogue listed them for $750.  When I spoke to
the salesman (Sean) whom I have dealt with in the past, I was at first told
that they are sold out and that the wheels are on back order (4 week wait).
He then offered to sell me a set of used Minilites (6.5x15) for $750 which
he said  was a real bargain.  I have seen minilites on 914's and was told
that the wheels will not take 205-50's and that there were fender clearance
problems.  Sean said that there wasn't such a problem.  After I toel him I
was not interested in the Minilites, he suddenly remembered that he indeed
had a set of the wheels I wanted (made by Revolution) but were demo's and
that the price was $850 because the catalogue price was wrong.  I needed the
wheels so I agreed.

I feel that I have been had by the "bait and switch" gambit.  These guys
were the same folks who sold me a ten-lobed cam for a 924, and switched sway
bars on a package deal they advertised (it took me 4 weeks to get all the
right parts which came via electrodyne and Automotion!)

Has anyone bought the wheels in question (914AFX in the catalogue) from this
outfit and did you pay $750 or $850 for the set?  I need this info ASAP so I
can cancel my order if need be.

P.S. Stan warned me about these guys and I took his advice and order the
wheels COD.  The downside of this is that there is a 15% restocking charge.

Porsche though about this.  They kindly provided an offical Porsche plastic
bad to put that nasty, cold, smelly tire in.  This is an important piece
of original equipment - don't buy a Porsche that doesn't have it.  If
you lose or break this bag, run don't walk to your nearest Porsche

I looked into this when I had my front shocks replaced.  My local

can take up to a month to do the work, and he's had a couple come back 
that weren't done right.  If you can afford to have your car not driven

Just keep a trash bag in the trunk, packed into the spare if you wish,

Hi, I saw this in Automotive News and thought this might be
of interest to some in P-files.


Reprinted withouth Permission


PORSCHE SLATES BOXSTER FOR U.S. MARKET IN '96


Stuttgart, Germany - Porsche AG and a prominent
supplier are pare of an effort to lure U.S. companies,
including suppliers, to Baden-Wurttemberg.

Porsche and ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a supplier of 
transmissions, steering systems and suspensions,
are among the companies showcasing their own
manufacturing and high-tech accomplishments in an
effort to help the state of Baden-Wurttemberg attract
U.S. companies and investors to the region.

Porsche AG is touting its new Boxster, a light, mid-
engine, two-seat sports car, due to debut in the 
United States in 1996. The Boxster also will be available
in a more upscale version a year or two later, Porsche
disclosed.

The basic Boxster is to carry a price tag of around 70,000
to 75,000 DM (about $43,750 to $46,875 U.S.). The upscale
version will be about $75,000, said Michael Schimpke, a 
Porsche AG spokesman.

Dietmar Pfister, ZF director, said ZF recently completed 
work on a new continuously variable transmission. The so-
called CVTs are fuel-efficient automatic transmissions that
are less expensive and less complicated to build.

"We are offering it to a couple of customers this year," he
said.

Pfister declined to say which auto manufacturers will be 
offered the transmission, but he said it would be appropriate
for smaller cars.

Bruised by the recession of the late 1980s and 1990s, Baden-
Wurttemberg and its major companies are to draw U.S. businesses here.

In an effort to attract U.S. companies, the Baden-Wurtemberg
Agency for International Economic Cooperation recently hosted
a group of American journalists who toured several companies in
the state.

Baden-Wurttemberg, like much of Germany, has not recovered fully from
its latest recession.

The state is still plagued by a surging deutsche mark plus
strong, rigid, labor unions and expensive housing.

The automotive sector, one of the three key industries in Baden-
Wurttemberg, has contributed significantly to the state's woes.
The other two important industries in the region are machine
tools and microelectronics.

In the past two years, Mercedes-Benz has laid off some 10,000
workers and Porsche AG has shed 2,600 employees, contributing
to the state's 7 percent unemployment rate.

Much of Porsche's problem is tied to its poor performance in
the United States. In 1993, Porsche sold 3,728 cars in the 
United States, a far cry from its sales peak of 30,471 units
in 1986.

Yup, that's me, the broken stud (haven't told the wife yet).  I was planning
on posting step by step narratives.  The planned work (meaning what I
think I can afford to do assuming no horrors when I disassemble the
engine):
        Replace broken tank->engine steel fuel line
                I intend to have a local hydraulic shop make me up a
                new fuel line.  May decide to do the return line as
                well.  May decide to use flexible hose with an
                external protective braid.  Will decide when I've
                looked though the catalog of hose types.  Problem with
                the original is that it fretted through from riding on
                the tranny case for 70k miles.

        Upgrade my original (worn!) clutch to a new spring centered
        clutch including new pilot bearing, new bolts and rear main seal,
        possible resurface of flywheel.

        Replace all 12 exhaust side studs with epoxy coated dilavar
        (currently have exhaust side uncoated dilavar, intake side
        non-dilavar), probably intake side too.

        Upgrade to hydraulic tensioners, new ramps.  I'm pretty sure
        that my idler arms are the compatible (wide?) type.

        Install CIS airbox pop-off valve.

        New alt and a/c belts (whew, that's a big job ;->).

        Clean and re-pack cv joints (see post earlier today).

        Check all valves, guides, rings, pistons and cylinders for
        wear with fingers crossed the whole time.

Prep for engine removal (including building a cradle from 2x4's) will
conclude this evening and basically consisted of disconnecting all
wires, fuel lines, throttle linkage, clutch cable, shifter link, ground
strap, alt and starter motor wires and two vac lines and a couple of
oil lines from engine.  Removed the battery first of course.  Oh wait, 
just remembered - I need to drain the oil too - good job I remembered
that one!  All were labeled with a little bit of masking tape so I
know where to put them back on again.  I'm dropping the eng and trany
on Sunday and will hopefully get as far as de-mating the tranny, 
inspecting the clutch, and getting all the ancillary stuff off the engine
and getting it up on the bench.  I plan on a thorough de-grease and clean
of the engine compartment and engine/tranny external case too, so this
will be more pleasant next time (I hope there won't be one).

Subject: Fluid Specs for 944

Two quick questions for those in the know...  I have a 1983 944.  My power
steering fluid is a little low.  According to my owners manual, I need to use
ATF Dexron.  According to Haynes, I need to use Dexron II ATF.  When I when to
the automotive store, all I could find was Dextron III (that's Dextron with a
"t" in it).  What are the differences among these three?  Can I use the Dextron
III to top up my power steering fluid?

The second question is similar.  It is in connection with my transmission fluid.
My owners manual recommends ATF Dexron.  (I have an automatic.  Don't ask...)
However Haynes recommends SAE 90W gear oil.  What should I use?

Okay, so I lied.  I have a third question.  As you are all probably aware from
Thom's great posting about my mechanical woes in Sacramento, we replaced the
radiator in my car.  I have yet to post my version of the story (which isn't
much different) but after my unexpectedly extended vacation my life here has
been nust and I haven't had time to write it up yet.  Anyhow, when we took the
radiator off, we lost some transmission fluid.  (Because I have an automatic,
the radiator is also a tranmission fluid cooler.)  Afterward, we checked the
fluid level to see if it needed topping up.  It looked okay, but I'm worried
that I'm checking the wrong thing.  I *think* I'm supposed to check the fluid
level at the rear of the car near the differential.  Is this right, or is this
some *other* trasmission reservoir that holds different fluid from that which we
lost from the radiator? If itisn't the right one, where/how should I check?

Thanks in advance!

Hello All;

During my continuing search for a Porsche 944, several p-filers have asked me 
about 944 Turbos S cars which I have come across.  One in particular that may 
interest some readers is an '89 944 Turbo offered for sale in Southern 
Maryland.  It is a Platinum/Ivory combination with only 34K miles.  Asking 
price just reduced from $25,000 to $22,500.  If you are interested, call Mike 
Turner at (410) 586-0612.  It seems that new family responsibilities 
necessitate the sale.  I have no stake in the car and all disclaimers apply.  I 
have not looked at it because I can not afford it without selling my current 
car (Anybody want to trade their 944 or 911 for a '93 Taurus SHO?).

Subject: A 1974 Carrera?!?!?

Hello again!

My dad and I drove up to Indianapolis for the Tweeks swap meet this past
weekend. He drove his '85 Carrera and I drove my 19?? 911 ???. Here's the
story on why I really don't know what my car is:

Last September I bought my first Porsche. Actually, I traded a 1989 Jeep
Cherokee for it. I was told that it was a 1969 911S with updated 911SC
bodywork and a 1980 911SC drivetrain. Being considerably less knowledgeable
about Porsches then than I am now, I bought the car after my mechanic looked
it over.

Recently I began to suspect that it is not a 1969 911S. The serial number
tag in the trunk says its a '69 911S and the serial number agrees, as does
the serial number stamped above the gas tank. However, there were several
discrepancies which tipped me off:

1) A 1969 911 should have two battery compartments. This car only has one.
2) The serial number tag on a '69 should be beside the trunk latch. This car
   has it on the passenger side of the trunk.
3) There is no windshield serial number tag.

So at the Tweeks swap meet this past weekend I talked with an extremely
knowledgeable Porsche expert and I asked him to determine what model of 911
I had. I told him all of the reasons I didn't believe it was a '69 911S and
then he started poking around all over the car. He pointed out lots of
things which narrowed down what model the car could be. When he was done,
he and I were 90% sure that I was the unexpected owner of a 1974 911 Carrera,
a relatively rare car.

This discovery has opened up a whole new can of worms and I plan to do some
heavy research on the car's origins and owners. Also, I need to pull one of
the taillight boxes and see if the fender flares are galvanized. If they are
not, the car is most certainly a 1974 Carrera. The afore-mentioned expert also
told me that Porsche buries another code or serial number somewhere deep in the
car which requires some disassembly to find. That would certainly settle the
whole issue, but the guy didn't know where to find it on a 911, only on 356s.
Anybody else heard of this number or know where to find it? He suggested I
call PCNA to get information on it.

Anyway, as I've known all along, the car really does have a 1980 911SC engine
with a Weber conversion. It is a fantastic powerplant.

No matter what model the car really is, it is a lot of fun and it looks sharp.
BTW, for those of you who went to Tweeks, my '74 Carrera was the only Signal
Green Porsche there--you couldn't have missed it. My next message will talk
more about the Tweeks swap meet. It was excellent!

Subject: Testing space savers

As in many things, test it like you mean it.  My Targa came with a nice empty
trunk: no spare, no air pump, no plastic bag.  If I had an electric pump
that had been sitting for years unused, I'd want to test that as much as the
tire itself.  Anyway I bought a more or less bulletproof $6 foot pump and
a swap meet spare, and I definitely tested them out together.

Spray can w/stop leak goo would be a bad plan, I'd say, unless you right away
put the spare on the car and ran it to spread the goo.  Otherwise you'll have
a puddle that'll unbalance the wheel big time.

Roger, I have a couple of ideas for your oil cooler problem. I knew one
member of the RMR-PCA club that mounted an oil cooler *under* the engine
compartment cover. I believe he had to remove the plastic rain collector
to do this. BTW, removing the rain collector also improves cooling due to 
increased airflow to the engine. Of course you will get your engine at 
little wetter in the rain. 

Hope this helps

This list is cool!  I wish I had access to it over the last 4 years when my
Porsche was breaking me in.  
My address is jtucker@qmgate.arc.nasa.gov, I gave it out wrong yesterday,
sorry.

1)  My '71 911T Targa has oil droplets (not smoke or water vapor) coming out of
the exhaust.  My guess is the valve guides or rings.  What do you think and how
do I troubleshoot it?  (This question went out yesterday but it didn't show up
in my digest version.?)
2)  The engine has 125k on it.  What else should I replace for preventative
maintenance if I have to take the engine out?  Chain tensioners, ramps, timing
chain, etc.?  
3)  Is boring it out and putting bigger pistons in it for more horsepower a
good idea, easy to do?  It's a 2.2 now.
4)  Do you think it would be frowned upon by other porsche enthusiasts or
potential buyers, if I replace my Zenith carbs with Webers?
5)  The back end rolls when I turn.  Is this part of the reason my car has a
"T" after the 911.  If not, how do I correct this?  Suggestions in order of
increasing cost please.

Thanks, John

P.S.  Is "Guards Red" what my car would have been if red from the factory?
      Does anybody know what color red came from the factory in '71?

Porsche ships each new car with a plastic bag in the trunk/cubby
which is there for just this reason.  And, of course, a pair of

That's kind of a silly question, isn't it?  You measure the same way you
always have.  I don't have my Porsche books anymore (hi, Fred), but as I
recall the front height should be 90mm from center of torsion bar to center
of lower arm pivot point.  Rear height is measured similarly...

That they're all sagging only means they're out of spec, not that they
can't be measured...  Bringing the front back up is easy, but to do the
rears legally you need new springs.

I disagree.  If your temp gauge shows high while highway driving, it
cannot be the fan switch.  The fans only cool the engine at low
speeds.  At highway speeds, they actually get in the way of the cooling
done by air hitting the front of the car.

Start by making sure your coolant is topped off, and is bled of air
properly.  If this isn't it, check the thermostat.  Wouldn't hurt to
calibrate the temp sender, but it very rarely goes bad.

You get a tube or four of CV joint lube.  Dunno exactly what's in the

OK, but I've never done that.

>Is there a trick to getting them back together ?

Well, it's a bit of a fiddle.  The "Porsche 914 914/6 Handbook" has
a pretty good step-by-step with photos.  The key thing is to notice
that the spacing, around the perimeter of the inner and outer races,
of the grooves alternates: short, then long.  You want to line up a
short gap on the inner with a long one on the outer.  I think.  Else
it won't all go back together.  I've done this a bunch of times; I
just forget each time and re-learn when I have the parts in my hands.

In the book "Carrera 4," which talks about the development of the 964,
they mention that one of the requirements was that the space reduction
required for the front differential still leave the trunk large enough
to take a full-size tyre and wheel.  Anyone with a later model Porsche
ever tried this?

BTW, I've heard that the new carrera 4 will not have the centre
differential with the planetary gears like the old car did (which was
locked by a viscous clutch when necessary), rather the viscous clutch
itself will be the differential (like on the 959).  Anybody know
anymore details about this.

If the above is true, it makes me much happier than the turbo will
only be available as a 4WD... by all account the 959 4WD system was
much better than that of the C4 (the 959 two disadvantages: not
effective at very low speed, and the maintenance of the differential is
expensive).  I've never driven a 959, so I can't comment.  Anybody on
the list been so lucky?

Jay,

Fronts: The only "special" tools you really need are your fingers. :-)
This is a pretty easy job.  Just make sure that the spindle nut is
adjusted properly after you reinstall the hub.

Rears: Unless you are sure you need to service them (i.e., they are
making noise), I would leave them alone.  The bearings are one-piece
units that are virtually impossible to remove without pulling them
apart (i.e., I've never been able to figure out how to do it).  There
isn't enough clearance to insert anything to restrain the inner race
while pressing out the stub axle.

Or for that matter getting a flat in the middle of the day in 
Houston, wearing a suit, on your way to a meeting that will also
involve taking a client to lunch. And of course, it's a  *REAR*
flat -- you know the BIGGER tire...

The answer is, you take the Targa top off, you push the passenger
front seat all the way forward, and stuff the tire onto the rear
seat backs (seats folded down) and have it rest on the folded over
seat back of the passenger front seat. Optionally, you put the top
back on at this point, the key feature to its removal being the clearance
necessary to get the tire into the back... You then play Think Real
Fast as to why you need to go to lunch in the client's car...

How about this solution to moisture coming through the concrete floor of
your garage in the winter.  You could have the ultimate water seal on your
floor by doing what I did last night.  While draining/changing your oil, just 
after pulling out the plug, and sliding the 4.5 gallon oil catcher bin under 
the hot stream of oil to catch it all, while getting up from underneath the
car, you accidently kick the oil catcher bucket (unknowingly), and PRESTO!  
Within 20 seconds, you now have a fresh new vapor barrier installed on your 
garage floor.  11-12 Quarts of used motor oil.  Keeps the bugs and animals out
from under the car too!  Works great.  Let the moisture just try and
penetrate that 1/8 inch oil slick.  Makes a great year-round skating rink 
when the car is out of the garage too.  F*** Me.  :-)

And yes, I am the same guy that thought I smoked my valves going from 2nd to 
1st at 5500RPM's about a month ago.  I just paid my law school tuition, and 
can't afford to fix this.  I have been driving it, and it has not given me any
problems starting or running as of yet.  Now, it only idles a very-little 
rougher than it did, and has gotten much better than when the incident 
happened.  How can this be?  It has all the power it had.  It is as if the
problem has subsided.  Someone suggested a bent rocker arm, and maybe I did
not bend my valves.  But this would not subside over time would it?  Anyways,
since I am planning on keeping this car forever, I will get it looked at
someday when I have the engine pulled for a complete overhaul.  In the
meantime, wheres that Mustang for heat #2? (just kidding).

Oh yeah, Claudia Conrad in Boston (When are we going to Union St.?) asked 
where to get Kendall Motor oil.  I found it at Foriegn Autopart on Brighton 
Ave. in Alston/Boston.  They have it by the case, normal prices, bought 
some yesterday.  They have filters too.  (I used 20W50 for an 81 911SC, is 
this the proper weight? the old stuff sure slides nicely on the floor :-).

Actually, I don't think it really makes much of a difference what sort of
alarm you get.  One of those fake blinking LEDs on your dash will ward off
probably 30% of the casual thieves (if you're breaking into ten or twenty cars
in a parking lot, you avoid the ones that might make noise), any alarm which
disables the ignition and/or fuel pump will thwart the weekend car thief, and
if a real professional wants it, it's gone.  One of the recent Clint Eastwood
movies showed a professional gang that posed as valet parking attendants.  If
a nice Porsche, 'Vette or Jaguar showed up, it was driven directly to a car
carrier.  When the carrier was full, they drove it off.

Centerline 15x8 and 15x10.  Stock suspension.  This car is a daily driver.
I am interested because it looks like a possible autox and track car.  The
owner wants 10,500 (he says that a kit Speedster will cost more).  The car
indeed is a fake Speedster, but still a Porsche, albeit the 914/VW derived

to a 2.7L, does this soundow what to look for in the the way of models
and options. Also are there any books that have specs on models, options 
and performance specs, and a book about buying a 911, ie what to look for as
far as problem areas.
 
Could someone give me some idea of what a car like this might cost and

you have two options:
 
1) Have Significant (and soon to be Ex) Other hold it on his/her lap.
 
2) Abandon the flat tire and forged wheel by the side of the road. This is
recommended because
   a) That wheel has bad karma anyway
   b) You drive a Porsche, and you can afford it
   c) Somebody with no use for it will find it, and we need a continuing

Subject: re; removing undercoating/space saver tires

    1.  Sandblasting does not work to remove any real level of undercoating,
      it will bounce off. The only time it will remove undercoating is if
      the layer is -very- thin. 
        The only ways to get off undercoating are nasty; scrape the first 
      layer with a putty knife, then brush on paint stripper and try again.
      Eventually you may get to a residue that sandblasting may remove,
      but it has to be -very-thin.       
        Removal of old undercoating is pretty critical in getting old rust
      fixed. Most Rust lies beneath the undercoating; people often spray
      undercoating over rust (thinking it will help), and undercoating 
      traps moisture underneath it. Undercoating will provide -no protection-
      on its own, what it will do is protect the film of galvanizing 
      or rust-resistant paint from getting bashed off the metal. Too often it
      is put on indiscriminately and will clog drain holes, etc, making rust
      even worse. 
         As another side note, NEVER use a sandblaster on any panel that
      gets body paint, on EITHER side. A pressure-fed sandblaster will
      generate a lot of heat and will warp panels. I didn't believe this
      until I put 4 neat depressions in a $400 hood....Sandblast only
      the chassis and use walnut shells for the panels.

    2. Space-saver spares; Forget what to do with the flat, the problem on my
      928 is that once used, the space-saver won't deflate to the same size
      it was before used ! I can fit it back in, but it is scrunched...

the 2.4L engine was rebuilt 40K miles ago. It has 5sp tranny. Leather
Recarro seats, front/rear spoilers, pull out CD, $6995.00.

 - Beside the non-rust-proof chassis, is there anything bad about this
  model year? How bad is the rust problem?

 - How reliable is the 2.4L motor? How reliable is this model year?

 - Is the tranny the 915 type?

 - Anything us novice should watch out for during the initial inspection?
  We will take it to the local Porsche mechanic before purchasing.

 - Is the price reasonable?

*** On a different car, 79-930:

 - Would I damage the AC compressor or any of the AC components if I
  remove the belt?  I am looking for a little more varoom, since I don't
  use the AC much.

 - I am thinking of taking the car to the local track, do I need to do
  anything special to prepare it? Use race brake fluid and race pads?
  Please recommend brands.

 - Is there any damage to the engine if I fill it up with too much oil
  during oil change? 

 - Whenever I got stuck in traffic (1-2 hours), I notice the temp needle
  keeps climbing, although I haven't got stuck long enough for the needle
  to pass the midpoint. Is this normal? The car has an oil cooler in the

*** Some weeks ago, someone asked about how to deduct car loan interest,
below is a method for doing so, although it's too late if you already
bought the car. It requires you have some securities worth twice the
cost of the car.

Assume that the car cost is $5000 and you have $10000 worth of stocks:

1_ Sale the stocks and use half of the money to buy the car.

2_ Use the remaining $5000 plus borrow $5000 (from brokerage house) on
   margin and buy back the stocks you just sold. Note that if the value
   of the stocks drops below what you owe, then you have to put in more
   money to cover the difference.

3_ The monthly margin interest (on the $5000) is tax deductible, since
   it is investment money. Also the margin interest rate is usually 1
   point lower than regular car-loan rate.


Sorry for such a long message, I could have split it up into 3, but just

I've an 82 SC which also has problems going into 1st when stopped.  If
I move the lever into second then back to first it usually goes in right
away.  I assumed that the problem was simply worn shift forks.  I also
am disassembling the car this wknd.  I'm removing the eng and tranny
for engine work, but will do a new clutch as well.  I am planning on
inspecting the shift forks.  Please let me know what you find out.  If
there is a soln. to this problem it'd be nice to know about it while
the thing is out of the car.

Thanks

Subject: Thanks for help w/ undercoating

Hello all.

Thanks for the help w/ the undercoating removal!  Most of the messages
came to whole group but if anyone wants a complete record of what was
sent to me, just let me know.  The majority opinion was that sandblasting
doesn't work well but scrapping/wire brushing will remove the stuff.

I intend to clean the undercoat off and then get someone to sandblast off the
rust (lots of really hard places to reach were rusty on the left-hand side
fender!)  I'll let the group know if anything goes bad wrong...

Thanks again for the help!

Subject: Clutch lube question

Well, I finally got the guts to have my 86 951 clutch torn down and
inspected. When the car was new and under warranty, I complained about
clutch chatter on engagement (especially when cold), and was repeatedly put
off by the dealer.

When I moved to Joisey, the local dealer picked up on the problem
immediately, but hey man, its outa warranty. They figured $800 just to
remove the clutch and have a look.

I've waited till now because the car was still drivable. I figured they
would try to worm out of it (and I was right), so i delayed as long as I
could.

soooo, this week they tore down the car at paul miller, and sure enough,
the bearing and shaft that the clutch ride on were rusty! How is that
possible?
I realize that oil on the plates is bad, but how can the shaft be designed
to rust (fail) almost immediately?

The factory representative had the bad taste to initially try to sell me a
new 968 while maintaining nothing was wrong beyond normal wear. What an
attitude. Fortunately, I was able to convince him to actually inspect the
parts. No wonder this has taken so long to sort out.

The car has 35k miles now, and I first reported the problem at 7800 miles.
Paul miller found no abuse, i.e. no blue spots on the flywheel
(overheating) and no excessive wear (the rivets hadn't come in contact with
the flywheel). PCNA indicated these were the factors that would indicate
owner abuse in response to my first letter.

So far they've offered free parts (a take it or leave it proposition, so I
took it). That leaves ~$900 in labor. I figure to write another letter to
PCNA after I get the car back. This ain't Deutscheland.

What would you guys do? any technical explanations for this?

Peter,
I tried sandblasting with no luck.  I used #80 sandblasting sand and it
bounced off (it did create a nice beach vollyball court in the driveway). 
Could you expand on the sandblasting procedure.  What grade of sand?

I realy don't want to start a flame war, but this seems to be the way they 
BUILD the cars, if I'm not mistaken.  I know for a fact that the major 
pieces on my bus are joined by overlapping the two pieces of metal and
tack welding them together.  After 37 years, they have neither rusted nor
fallen apart.

I think that its just like anything you do - if you don't do it right, 
then its going to crap out on you.  For instance,if you don't undercoat
and/or weld up the opposite side of the lap weld, and leave it hanging
int the breeze, then yes, it is going to rust.  But if you replace
the undercoating, or the zinc coating in the later 911's, I don't see 
where the problem is.

Butt welding is a good solution, but as was mentioned, it is a pain to set 
up, although you can get welding clamps that have a wide gap in them.  It
is also a lot harder for an amatuer welder to get a good clean bead, even
with a MIG welder, and then when you grind down the weld, you are weakening
it.  When I do my lap weld, when I grind down everything afterwar, I dont
actually take much of my weld bead off.  Furthermore, if the weld is 
expected to handle any stress at all, I would question the strength of an
inexperienced person's butt weld after it has been ground off.             

I am not trying to come off as an eperienced welder or bodyman, but I have
read some on the subject and more importantly, I've done a lot of paint and
bodywork on my own cars and a couple of others for friends of mine.  Over
the span of about 8 years that I have dabbled in this, I have yet for a
repair to fail.

respectfully submitted,
Thom

There are a few hundred cars parked where I work and every week it seems
a car alarm is going off.  Everyone seems to ignore them.

The only use for an alarm would be if it paged you.  If your pager goes off, 

you'll  know to make other ride arrangements for the trip home.  Your car 
will
be gone before you get there.  Of course  you wouldn't want to confront a 
potentially

The cheap blinking red LED is probably the most cost effective.  You can use 

the money the alarm would have cost you or lower your deductible.

Subject: 911 Engine Advice?


Questions regarding rebuild of 2.4L 911T (CIS)

First, I'd like to thank those of you who responded to my question re
the bogus transmission "spacers", serves me right for actually reading
the manual!

Background: Removal of the engine was no problem. Teardown was easy with
only one broken exhaust stud.
The engine was running (even at solo II, yeech) when I bought it.
Poor idle, midrange. Oil press=60 psi @ 4,000. Running hot, to 250 deg F.
Poor compression, but FI system pressures all in spec. Milage=180,000mi

Why would I buy such a turkey? -  Low price, "7R" case, counterbalanced
crank, case squirters, lots of torque. Should work well for my intended
use, a "mild" 914/6 conversion

Here's what the teardown revealed - Missing lower air deflector on
piece behind generator (these redirect air toward 1-3 cyl bank).
Well below spec head nut torques, especially #1,#2. Signs of leakage
at #1, #2 head gaskets. All pistons well out of spec top ring side
clearance (.010 - .012"). #1, #2 pistons broken between compression
rings! The bottom end had been rebuilt at some point, crank, rods,
and their bearings in very good condition. Intermediate gear backlash
=.009" (way out) and shows signs of wear. Thermostat checks out OK. 
Heads worn, cams look fine.

Here's my questions - Please bear in mind this is a T (ie not too 
stressed), and I need to keep expenses down (this doesn't mean I
will build a pile of crap however!).

Fuel Injection -
I intend to keep the CIS for two reasons. First, to pass smog in CA
it must stay, second, lack of $$ preclude going to webers. The
engine will not be back toghter for some time (aprox a year), and
I know from lurking on the net that CIS systems can be difficult
to store.

1) Can I clean out the FI components with carb cleaner and compressed
air? I intend to make sure everything is dried out and then seal
in plastic (by the way we only get about 2-3 inches of rain a year
here and current humidity is 12%, so I don't think moisture will
be a problem!)

2)I will of course replace all the fuel lines. Is there a source
for the plastic lines as used between the fuel distributer and the
injectors?

Engine -
1) Can I just replace the intermediate shaft gear with a new "0"
gear? The "spec" book sates "intermidiate shaft gear and crankshaft
gear can be replaced as a set only".

2) The oil pressure bypass pistons are the new style, is this a
problem?

3) The oil pump appears OK but is most likely the original. Can I
dismantle it for further inspection, or should it be replaced as
cheap insurance?

4) Must I use CIS pistons? These were only used for 1/2 yr and
are expensive. If possible, 2.2L T p/cs would give a boost in
compression. The problem with going to alloy cylinders is that I
would then need dilivar studs.

5) How critical is exhaust seat depth in this application? The
heads need reconditioning and the seats are near the limit.

6) The valve stems measure at .352" with less than .0002" taper.
Can they be reused with new valve guides (I know, they are out
of spec, I may be trying to push my luck....)?

7) The engine has new Carrera chain tensioners with the old style
chain sprocket supports. No spacers where used, are they needed?

8) Now for a purely academic question. Why did they go to the 30/33
mm port sizes on this engine (other than making it hard to find
gaskets)?

Well, that's more than enough. Thanks in advance for any advice,

Subject: more 944S2 noises ..

.. but different ones.

I was driving back from a track meet (potomac's at Watkins Glen -- met
fellow Porschephiles Steve Stomski (with whom I had a great run) and
Steve Timmins -- nice to see you face-to-face), and noticed a rather
unpleasant grating sound. Nothing above 3000 or below 2000, but between
a tearing/grating sound especially on decelerang. Very smooth and
quiet above 3000, so I wasn't too worried, but in retrospect I should
have gone back to get advice from the 944 experts there.

There's another symptom. On getting off or on the power, there's a
definite bucking, as if the fuel injection wasn't metering smoothly,
but I suspect it is related, and the drivetrain is shifting. My first 
guess was motor mounts, but it idles pretty smoothly. If I rev up the
engine when a little cold and let the revs drop back fast (so it slows
below 900 rpm or so) it is rougher. But the relative smoothness of the
idle makes me wonder if it's something else. I reached under to see if
I could feel any play in the half-shafts, but no.

The noise seems to come from the front or possibly the drivetrain somewhere
amidships. Any suggestions would be most welcome. I'd appreciate direct
e-mail replies, since I'm on the digest and will be seeing my mechanic
tomorrow morning.

Thanks for your help.

Subject:  Investment Interest Deduction

There are two problems with using investment interest to buy a car:

1-Investment expenses are only deduxctible to the extent they exceed 2% of
AGI...so if you make 100k you don't get to start deducting until you get more
than $2,000 in interest expense. The first $2,000 of interest expense in this
example is not deductible.

2-Investment interest is only deductible to the extent you have investment
income...so if your investments don't pay dividends or interest or you don't
churn to get some gains thrown off, you can't deduct at all. You can,
however, carry them over until you die, at which time they're lost.

From my experience, a home equity loan is the best way for most people to
borrow money to buy toys. No AGI limitations, no investment income
requirements and no carryovers. If you don't have a home, chances are you
don't itemize anyway according to the latest stats.

It is generally considered that the 1979-82 911-SC models are strong like
bulls and maintain their values.  My 1980 has run like a Swiss watch with
only routine maintenance. Almost 100,000 on the odometer and no sign of
meanigful wear.  Insurance is reasonable. My advice...buy a Targa. The
whole point of driving a Porsche is enjoying the open air.  The Targa is
the way to go.

I noticed on the back cover of Pano that Cincy Micro is advertising a new 
radar detector with an LCD readout.  Does anyone know anything about 
this?  Does it, for example, have a "bogey counter" like the Valentine 
One?  By the way, got the PR stuff from Valentine.  My only concern is 
the need for a clear path front and back for it to work.  How can you use 
it "discretely?"  The arrows are pretty cool, but frankly if my detector 
goes off I don't care if its behind me, in front of me or on top of me, 
I'm slowing down.  Perhaps I 'm missing the point, but I don't see the 
arrows being worth an extra $200.  Is ther something (anything) else 
about it that should persuade me its worth this extra cash over this new 
Escort (the 5000)?

There is nothing in the GGR rules that prevents you from going back
upstream to correct a course deviation on any of your laps except that you
will get a big "DNF".  But with the extra time involved the DNF wouldn't
matter and the track time/practice may be beneficial.  The un-written rule
is that on your practice lap, you may only back up one corner from where
you messed up if you should mess up that lap.  This prevents people from
taking a complete practice lap and then backing up around numerous corners
to again get more track time.  Again, GGR always uses the 1-1 or 1-2
format which would allow people this extra practice time. 

Also, with regards to the next car on course that is why we have course 
workers with red flags; if they are paying attention.

  Unfortunately, I placed an order with Automobile Atlanta before join this

shipping cost turned into an invoice listing 6 items and over $90 including
extra shipping cost on items that I never ordered.  2 of the 3 items from my

only 5 of the 6 items in the invoice was shipped.

  After several calls to Automobile Atlanta, they finally admitted the errors
and gave me a refund on the items that I didn't order.  In the process, I
need to return the items to them on my expense, and there are no refund on

  Automobile Atlanta will never see another penny of my money.  By the way,

I couldn't agree more!  The Targa has the advantage of "open air" 
driving, like a Cab, without the potential disadvantages of the soft top 
like:

	1.  Security problems (all those stories about people cutting 
through convertible tops to get at the car and/or its contents).

	2.  No "foggy rear plastic window" syndrome.

	3.  Built in roll bar if you want to go to the track (for cab, 
need to have one installed).

To be fair, there are disadvantages to the Targa.

	1.  The constant folding/unfolding of the top leads to tears in 
the vinyl top which costs $$ to replace.

	2.  Unless your insanely confident in you local weather 
forecaster, because the top folds and gets put in the boot, there is 
little space left for any other "luggage."  Cab folds down into its own 
space.

	3.  The rubber seals which are used are incredibly expensive to 
replace, when (not if) they tear/dry out.

Despite the negatives, I still like the Targa for its positives.  The 
replacement/repairs are not THAT frequent and, although I have no 
experience with a Porsche cab, and would defer to cab owners on this by all 
means, I had an Isuzu Amigo with the convertible back end for a while, so I
assume the cab tops need to be replacd at certain intervals as well.

On noise, I have not found the Targa to be all that noisy even with the 
windows up.  (I am assuming we're talking about noise with the top on.  
With the top off anything, the wind noise is going to be fairly significant.)
Besides, if your worried about a "quiet" ride, what would one be 
doing in a  P-car anyway?  Not exactly your quietest engine to start with, 
and most owners wouldn't have it any other way!  After all, there's 
always "your father's Oldsmobile" if you prefer the hermetically sealed 
approach.

As always, just my $.02 (which, the way the dollar's going is probably 
worthless anyway!)

Subject: Re: Investment Interest Deduction

Well, an even better idea may be to pay cash for the car, if you have
it. Or to remove cash from investments which do not appear to be yielding
the loan rate in question.

Some people don't like to have their money tied up in a car thats depreciating,
but this is really a sunk cost fallacy. If you buy a $15K car, then you 
DO have $15K in the car regardless of whether you pay cash or take a loan. 
If its your money, then you are paying depreciation+lost interest. If its
a banks money, they you are paying depreciation+loan interest. So, the 
relevant question, if you can get the cash, is:

loan interst less than or greater than interest you are making on the cash ??

Taxes: If you pay cash, then your interest income is reduced. That means
you won't be paying taxes on that money (assuming its not in a tax-exempt
investment like municipal bonds). If you take a loan from a bank, then
you may or may not be able to deduct interest from your income. The 
previous poster details this. 

IMHO, the diff. between a CD (4%?) and a loan (8%?) probably kills any 
tax advantadge you might get.

When people say they don't like to pay cash for a car, it may be a 
liquidity issue: i.e. an emergency may arise, and you'll wish you kept
the cash and took a loan. Sometimes this is a real issue, and sometimes 
people are just irrational. Decide for yourself what your case is. You
can allways get one of those $10K visa cards and not charge on it unless
such an emergency arises.

I'll defer to the numerous folks on the list who were so helpful to me as 
I decided to acquire my '84 (Stan, Lance, Lou etc.)  Since it was their

>>>"What does the CDK consist of, and how "concealed" is it really?  Ideally, I
would like a small display panel that would permit me to mount the detector
remotely behind the radiator grille or something."

The concealed display kit is really a misnomer.  What you get is a duplicate of
the display portion of the main detector, in an approx. 1" cube, on the end of
an approx. 3 ft. cable to the main unit.  In other words, it simply remotes the
display.  Furthermore, when the CDK is plugged in, the display on the main unit
is blanked.  The idea here is to allow you to put the CDK down in front of the
driver (perhaps also closer to his line of sight) but mainly thus invisible to
someone following you and still leaving the main unit up above where its
reception is good.  This is presumably of more urgent interest in those areas
where radar detectors are illegal.  Also, how "concealed" it is depends on what
you do with it.

This *does not* allow moving the main unit to behind the grill.  For one thing,
the control knob (mode, volume, on/off) is still on the main unit, as is the
speaker.  Furthermore, I'm pretty sure the main unit is not designed to be
subjected to the external environment.  I have read comments by Mike Valentine
(in Panorama/Upfixen, I think) in which he stated his belief that it's
impractical to design a *weatherproof* radar antenna, hence he does not offer a
remote-antenna-type radar detector.

Subject: Re: Targa v. Cabriolet (3.2 vs. 3.0 reliability)

The 3.2 and 3.6 normally aspirated engines and the 3.3 turbo (don't
know about the 3.6 turbo) have 1 mm smaller, and thus weaker, rod
bolts as compared to the 3.0 engine. Please note however, this is
only a problem when the engines are rev'd consistently past redline
by 500 or so RPM. With the stock rev limiters this is not possible
unless a shift is missed. The better way to look at this is that
Porsche did not build as large a safety margin as before.

Of course Raceware will have you believe that you engine is a time
bomb just waiting to explode. It just isn't so!! If you are going
to disable or raise the rev limiter and race the engine, you will
probably want to replace your rod bolts along with the valve springs
and spring retainers.

The bottom line is there is no reason a 3.2 should be less reliable
than a 3.0 for normal every day use.

Help!  I traded my old motorscooter (74' Kaw Z1b) for an Autothority Chip, but 
have not installed it yet (was waiting for the Used Car Warranty to expire, and 
it just did).  that chip raises redline 500 rpm.  Thanks to Scott for the

in serious jeopardy by occasionally using that 500 extra rpm?  I am grateful to

Ted,

Not to prolong this discussion further than necessary, but READ my first 
message (immediately above).  Do you comprehend the words "as well?"  I 
was not saying to dump looking at 3.0's.  I was simply trying to provide 
the original requester with some additional options.  

I apologize for the bandwidth and to the list for what is probably 
considered "flames" but sometimes one must "fight fire with fire."  Sorry 
if I somehow offended your sensibilities about your car Ted, but give it a 
rest.

End of my input.

Yes, then Clint took off after them.  The bad guys released the cars one-by-

It may have been only a movie, but they trashed an '85 or '86 928, an
older 928, a Jag (who cares), at least one 911, and a couple of other ostensibly
expensive cars in that scene alone.  Later in the movie, they trash a new
Mercedes convertible.  Also, one of the bad guys ruins a Ferrari/Lambo?
by having it painted a puke-green color.

My understanding is that some time back, Chuck Stoddard sold the company 
to PCNA, and that is why they're the "official" vintage parts repository.
Given the stuff that PAP deals in, it's not unreasonable that they'd
be using a lot of vintage parts.

If anyone else has a clearer picture of this, I'd like to hear it...

I can't speak for the other guys, but in my experience, most drivers
that are not in racing competition reflexively pull up as the tach gets
close to red line, and very damned few drivers will run with their
foot on the floor and the engine beating its brains out against the
rev limiter -- the 'nasty' sound that makes seems to promote doing
something to make it go away, like upshifting. 

And if you can do this in a *production* car in 5th gear, on a track, 
for long enough to qualify as 'sustained' then you're a better man 
than I...

When you're building a *competition* motor, and you want to raise the
redline from around 6k to around 9k, *THAT'S* when the rod bolt
problem shows up. Unlike the now-famous "AutoThority chip makes you
blow head gaskets on 944 Turbos" problem, I'm just not aware of any
with the chip on non-turbo 911s...

Only if you try to build racing engines using them... For the street,
the 3.2 and up engines are effectively bulletproof.

Once again: all of the engines built on 930/xx cases are very, very
solid, with bottom end life in the 200K mile range provided they're
given good maintenence (i.e. frequent oil changes, the right filters,
and a good grade of oil). 

I have invested a great deal of time and money over the years getting 
to where I can performance tune the CIS engines, so I tend to use them
for lots of applications -- CIS intact. However, for civilian use i.e.
you want minimum maintenence expense and maxmimum performance within
reason, DME engines are really the hot setup. The EFI systems almost
never give you the same grade of problems you can get on the CIS systems,
and you get that extra 200cc's of displacement...

Subject: '66-'69 911/2 Questions


Hi All,

Here's my latest set of questions and thanks to those who responded
to the last set!!

1.  I am installing new rotors, do I have to prepare the surface where
the rotor connects to the "spacer?"  Someone mentioned that if the
surface is not perfectly clean, you will have excessive heat
and possibly warp the rotors?  True?

The same person also said I shouldnt use "never seaze" on the bolts
holding the spacer to the rotor since it will reduce the heat transfer
capabilities.  Since my car is a '66 912, I like to use "never seaze"
to combat any new stuck/rusted bolts/nuts.

2.  I have cast iron brake calipers, it seems that no one will rebuild
them (new cylinder inserts) - I called practically every advertiser in
Excellence.  Why is that?  Stoddard will hone them out and install new
pistons, however, I'm not sure that honing the cylinders out and putting
in new pistons might not cause leakage.


3.  How on earth do you install the windshield wiper assy without
removing the motor from the assy?  It looks tough to me to re-install
the motor once off.  Is it possible to install it in one piece, or
do I have to split it into to parts and deal with the aggrivation
of reassembling it?


Thanks!!

Bart,

Your engine is only at risk if you run 500 RPM above the limit
for extended periods of time. What do I mean by "extended periods
of time"? That is a good question and I do not have an answer for
it.  7000 RPM is what I am have been told by Jerry Woods and Galen
Bieker as a safe limit. These guys say you can run a 3.2 all day

               INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY CORPORATION
         (Maintaining the Greatest Race Course in the World)

               INDY RACING LEAGUE ANNOUNCED FOR 1996:
            BOARD OF GOVERNORS NAMED, STRUCTURE REVEALED

   INDIANAPOLIS, July 8, 1994 -- The board of governors and organizational
structure for a new auto racing series to run in concert with the
Indianapolis
500 beginning in 1996 was announced today by Indianapolis Motor Speedway
President Tony George.  Named the Indy Racing League, the new series will be
based in Indianapolis and will feature the world's most prestigious auto
race,
the Indianapolis 500, as its cornerstone event.

   The Indy Racing League's structure will consist of a Board of Governors
and a
Commissioner.  The Commissioner will have the authority and responsibility to
manage a safe, competitive and financially sound series for the participants
and
sponsors with emphasis on the entertainment value for the race fans.

   The Indy Racing League's five member Board of Governors consists of Anton
H.
(Tony) George (President and CEO of Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation),
Richard King (President and CEO of the United States Auto Club), John R.
Cooper
(vice president and director of International Speedway Corporation), Daniel
A.
Cotter (President and CEO of Cotter and Company), and Donald F. Smith
(President
and CEO of First Financial and Terre Haute First National Bank).

   The Board of Governors will name a Commissioner for the new league at
later
date.

   Regarding its organizational structure, the Indy Racing League will
contract
with individual tracks for event promotion; with the United States Auto Club
(USAC) for series sanctioning; and with IMS Properties for series marketing
and
television management.  Jerry Hauer, recently named IMS Director of New
Series
Development, will begin the process of managing and coordinating this effort.

   The new series structure announcement comes more than two and a half years
after Tony George began attempts to negotiate a compromise organizational
structure with the Championship Auto Racing Teams, Inc. (CART) organization
of
race car owners.  The original Speedway proposal submitted in Houston in
November of 1991 was rejected, and the recent trial period (July 1992 - Jan.
1994) with George as a non-voting CART board member failed to move IMS and
CART
closer together.

   Chassis and engines specifications for all 1996 series events are being
studied at the present time and will be announced at a later date.  While the
race fans will see no noticeable change in the appearance of the race cars,
long
range cost containment and constant improvement of safety are top priorities.

   On behalf of the Board of Governors, George said, "This effort is in
response
to the numerous pleas from the various groups within our sport to offer an
alternative structure to a car owner controlled governing body for the
series.
We are confident that the Indy Racing League and this structure will provide
the
necessary communication among all parties to create a proper decision-making
process enabling the series to maximize its potential."

   "The unification of the series and the Indianapolis 500 not only maximizes
the marketing potential of the series, but also provides the needed long term
rules stability for both the Indianapolis 500 and the series events allowing
manufacturers and sponsors to invest substantially in the sport," added
George.

Just curious, in old (1991/2) Excellence magazines, they mention Porsche 
Vintage, with logo and all, whatever happened to this line/marketing 
situation?  I would like to get black window decor instead of chrome, and 
was wondering if this is an official porsce option for a '77 coupe?

Also, I went to the track today, but my car didn't pass tech.  The guy 
said my battery needed anchoring.  It looks like my battery is a 
non-porsche size, and I'd like to anchor it, rather than pay $100 or so 
for a Porsche battery since it's working OK. 

I see Automotion has a $35 gadget adapter, and I also went to the parts 
store for the standard clamp and L brackets, but haven't gotten in there 
to see if it will work.

I take it that rubber hold down straps are not acceptable for autocross?  
Also, can I apply that $20 I paid for the next session or event?

I was amazed at the variety of 911's and 914's, from Dave Darling's stock 
blue (who did an awesome 48 seconds on his first run), to ones with such 
extensive bodywork that Akiko had to ask me "What kind of car is dat"? 
to which I knowledgefully replied, "dat there is nine fourteen, with a 
modified body..."

It looked like fun, so I'm looking forward to the next sessions with 
clamped down battery and all, however, I was hoping the track would be a 
little faster, wider lane (I walked the course), more straights, maybe 
some banking, to fully take advantage of the car's handling.  I thought 
it was going to be inside Candlestick park, not in the parking lot.  
However, it still seemed like a fun well organized event.

My roof is stuck in the open position.  When retracting, I noticed the forks 
were not aligned.  One was higher than the other.  Then there a loud sorta 
'claaaaaack' noise then it died.  The motor runs when I push the switch in the
'down' position but not when I push it in the 'up' position.  The manual crank
moves the cable but not the forks.  My next step is swapping a power window 
switch with the roof switch to see if the switch is the problem but I'd like 
the net wisdom before taking apart my console.  Are the 2 relays at the motor 
interchangeable, I think they have the same part no. ?  This is really p**sing

Subject: 924S Timing Belt "Slapping"?

Lately, when starting up from cold, I hear what is definitely
something hitting the cam/balance belt plastic cover. It "smacks"
several times during the first minute or two of idle then quits.
It is not a regular "flap, flap, flap" but much more irregularly
spaced "whack..whack...........whack......whack.whack...". As it
begins to quit, it can be made to happen for a few for seconds by
rev'ing the engine; then it stops completely.

My suspicion is a loose belt which has "taken a set" overnight and
the curves are smacking the cover until it warms up and "softens".

1. Anyone else had this problem?

2. Any easy way to verify my suspicions?

3. How hard is it to adjust the tension(s)?

Note: This is a 1987 924S, so it should have the mechanical (manual)
tension adjuster for the cam belt.  The car has 60K miles but the belts
were replaced at 30K as a precautionary measure. Water pump is new style 
and sounds good, good pressure, and no leaks. External belts are in good
condition but seem quite tight.

Thanks for any ideas and/or help,

I have often thought it'd be fun to rig up something with a microswitch
in you seat and a couple of odd and ends from radio shaft.

8:00.00 you leave the car discreetly turning the antitheft switch to
        the "scare pos" and walk into the office.

8:45.00 thief opens your drivers side door and sits down prior to stealing
        your car

8:45.01 read LED starts blinking twice a second on dash board

8:45.02 a calm female voice under the dashboard (eg trillian from 
        hitchhikers guide) starts announcing

        "Warning safety interlocks disengaged..."
        "Detonation sequence now armed..."
        "Detonaters now linked to drivers seat..."

        "WARNING!! Device now armed, release of seat pressure will trigger
        charges"

6:30    You walk to your car and find a potential thief frozen in you seat

Not sure the ins. co. would pay to have the stain removed though.

should have told them to call the shipping co (UPS?) and issue a "call tag"
UPS will then call you and arrange to pick the stuff up at the other
guys expense.  If ups never calls you get to keep the parts.  alternatly
you simply tell AA the parts will be on your doorstep for 1 week then
in the garbage.

assuming you bought on a credit card you have some leverage there too.
The credit card company, with enough ground for it, can revoke the
priveledge of AA to accept credit cards (whichever co you used) as payment.

I'm currently replacing the trailing arm bushings on my 914.
I tried putting in a new Weltmeister bushing dry - it squeaked.
I tried lubricating it with CV joint grease - it squeaked.  I called
up Tweeks and ordered some bushing prelube "grease".
This stuff has the feel and consistency of clear silicone RTV
sealant - except it doesn't set up.  It is also *very* sticky and
hard to clean up.  (Don't go slapping mosquitos when your
hands are full of this stuff like I did)  I lubricated the new
bushings with this prelube and assembled everything - silence!
It has only been a couple of weeks since I did the first trailing
arm, so I don't know how long the prelube will last.

Subject: Ventilation

Hey,

Forgive me if this dead horse has already been beaten, but does
anyone know of a method or even a kit to increase the fresh air
ventilation of older 911s?  I guess specifically the ones (like mine)
that don't have the dash vents (pre '77 maybe?).  Please don't tell 
me to roll the windows down:>|.  Living in Alabama has its advan-
tages (none come to mind at the moment, however), but the lovely
tropical rain forest summer weather is not one of them.  BTW,
I'm not a big fan of adding AC.

Due to the almost total lack of forced ventilation, I would imagine
this subject has been broached before, so personal replies might
be appropriate.

Thanks,

Subject: Two emissions questions on 1987 911s (too clean?)

Note the "hidden" academically-correct disclaimer below:
Emissions inspection seems to suggest 911 would clean up air in Los Angeles 

I just inspected my 1987 911 at the largest Porsche dealer in St. Louis - 
Plaza Motors. Passed, of course. Some readings of the emissions test:

                    Actual reading      Passing Standard
HC                  4 ppm               220 ppm
CO                  0.01%               1.20%
Dilution (CO+CO2)   14.9%               6.0% (minimum?)
RPM                 801     (***however, tach reads 600 to 750 max at idle)

The analyzer was calibrated for about 10 minutes just before my test. The
mechanic said that for natural [sic] combustion the third number should be
14.7%, and at just 0.2% over atmospheric [sic]  I was almost cleaning the air
of  St. Louis [sic], and I would definitely be cleaning up the air of Los
Angeles [sic]. (I presume the 14.7% refers to stoichiometric combustion of
iso-octane, but can not see the relation to "dilution CO+CO2" and the 6.0%
passing standard. I have a dilution tunnel in my lab, but the idea there is to
measure particulate emissions in air-diluted portions of diesel-engine exhaust
so that the filters do not clog as fast as they would with the full exhaust).
HC and CO seem very low too. So if I was driving around LA (or Athens, or any
other polluted city) I would be cleaning up its air???!!!! How much performance
am I giving up in my 2,000 or fewer miles per year on this high-performance
air-cleaning 911 to satisfy the green zealots?

The car is absolutely stock, 33,700 miles with 20 miles on (new) distributor
cap and rotor.  Here are some questions:

1. Emissions test is done at idle (and I don't care about performance at idle).
However, emissions regulations are met by reductions in performance. I assume 
the factory knows this and has set the brain to: pass the emissions test at
idle; and give me maximum performance regardless of exhaust content when the
car is moving. Is this assumption correct, or does it make an ass-u-me? (from
Benny Hill, may he be resting on the laps of his Hills Angels).  In other
words, is there a way  to improve driving performance by modifying the brain
without compromising engine reliability and still pass the emissions test at
idle? I am not looking for max rpm increase here (guess what happens to
lubrication ---> wear ---> engine life at higher piston speeds), but I am
looking for MODEST increases in power (think gaskets) at 1500-6000 rpm.

2. What is "Dilution (CO+CO2)"? (The mechanics explanation appears inaccurate)

Thanks in advance for the input.

Tom,

I had a similar sound on my 944S, but it was the balance belt, not
the timing belt.  The balance belt was very loose and the balance
belt idler was not in it's proper position. This caused the belt
to flop until the engine warmed up.  My experience has shown that
this belt tightens slightly as the engine warms up.  I seriously
doubt the noise is from your timing belt, especially if you have
the mechanical tensioner.

Since you've got 30K miles on these belts, I'd get a belt/roller
kit from Zims and replace both the balance belt and the timing
belt along with all the rollers.  There were instructions posted
awhile back by John Smaardyk on doing it yourself.  If you need
further info, let me know.  I can tell you certain pitfalls to
watch out for (John can too).

If you want to go ahead and adjust the timing belt tension...

1) Remove gravel guard.
2) Remove A/C and power steering belts.
3) Remove airbox (makes access easier on a 944S,
      dont know about 924S/944. The airbox sits differently.)
4) Remove timing belt cover.
5) Set engine at TDC.
6) Loosen upper two bolts on self-tensioner.
7) Tighten upper two bolts to 20nm.
8) Put everything back together.

THIS MUST BE DONE ON A COLD ENGINE!!!

If it's your balance belt making the noise, remove the gravel guard,
remove drive belts, remove timing belt cover, replace drive belts,
drive to Porsche mechanic or dealer.  Let them let the engine cool
(overnight), and set the tension on the balance belt.  When you
get the car back, replace all the parts you left off. My mechanic
charges $25 to set balance belt tension if I have all the stuff
removed, $50-$60 if he has to remove it.

Thank you very much for your response on driving the 911 St. Louis to Chicago
and back, and staying overnight in the NW Chicago suburbs. The car's condition
and many extras are too good for the price it would fetch, and I would like to
replace it with a 930 (earlier posting asking $33,000). I decided to drive and
enjoy the car until the price, miles and condition are closer than they are
now. 

I decided to take my chances with parking the car in a hotel parking lot  and
the Charlie Sheen types some of the respondents warned me about. I will take
all precautions, of course, including wiring a huge capacitor to discharge and
kill anyone who touches  my precious German metal. Or I may sleep in the car,
under the cover, cuddling  a rifle.... 

I hope I don't live to regret not picking up Andy Glaister on his offer 
to find a hotel with a covered or more secure lot (thanks, Andy).
And thank you all very much again for the input.

Steve,

I've done this once.  If I remember correctly, these are the nicest, 
easist brakes to do.  Now, you have to look at the correct routing
of the brakepad wear wires.

Use a pair of plyer, channel locs, etc. to compress the spring from s
side to side near the middle of the spring.  (You press into the center
of the caliper.  This allowed one end of the spring to release and 
hinge out of the way.  Very nice for doing at the track.

Lance indirectly makes a good point, those with A/C should run the bloody

Subject: State Farm Insurance

Kind of long...... delete or read on at your own risk....

I wanted to give an account of a recent experience I've
had with State Farm Insurance.  Fortunately it was not
with our (insert special interest/classic car type here), but the
way things were handled likely represent how things would have
gone with one of our other vehicles.

On July 4th we had an unexpected big bang.  To shorten the
story as much as possible, we were making a left hand turn
at a "T" intersection in our '77 Chevy Suburban, (towing our
ski boat and trailer).  The road we were turning from was a
two lane road, onto a two lane road.  A car that was at least two
car lengths behind us tried to pass (at about 70 mph) on our
left as we were making the turn.  After first hitting the car behind
us they "T" boned our truck right between the left rear passenger 
door and the rear wheel (crossing a double yellow line at an
intersection to boot).

No serious injuries in our Suburban, just some sore and shook up
people (and 3 bouncing dogs).  Our truck was determined to be 
totaled as it was hit so hard that the body buckled on the right side!

I was all ready for a battle to settle on the value of this truck.
It may have been the cleanest best equipped old Suburban
left on the planet, what would State Farm give me for it?  

At this time, since I haven't yet revived a copy of the police
report I still don't know if the guy who hit us was insured.  State
Farm is settling with me, then they'll go after the guy when all
the facts are in.  I appreciate this.

I provided State Farm with an overview of the condition of the
truck, options, features, recent work.  Their appraiser went out
and gave it the highest possible rating in every category, and
noticed every option and feature the truck had.  Instead of
using the Blue Book, State Farm finds comparable vehicles in your
area to base value.  Two recent sales of "similar" vehicles went
for $2000 and $2500 (ouch!!!).  They "adjusted" those prices to
reflect our truck and offered us about $6000.  Not what I would
have liked, or sold it for, or could replace it for, but I have to
give them credit for recognizing the value and condition of the
truck.  I would have had a VERY difficult time getting $6K on
the open market.  FYI, I decided in my mind that I wanted $7K
but am taking the $6K.

There are three things that stand out in my mind that I give
State Farm credit for.

1.  They are not even considering fault or if the other guy is
	insured at this time.  They are just quickly settling with
	me so I can get back on the road.

2.  State Farms appraiser was very accurate in his review of the
	vehicle, and even suprised me in his thoroughness and
	of the evaluation.

3.  The fact that they looked for comparable vehicle SALES in my
	area vs blue book value means hope for those of us with
	special interest or classic cars in the unfortunate situation
	where we need to settle on the value of one of these cars.

	Taking "comparable" vehicles selling for thousands $$$ less
	than they offered me for mine, and then adjusting their
	offer to reflect the condition of our vehicle, 
	indicates State Farms appreciation for those of us with 
	older, well cared for and/or unique cars/trucks.

Now if you want the "long" version, ask me about my boat and
trailer and.......

Mark

I found a method for getting the space-saver spare tire back to its original

strap clamps (these are for furniture repair - they have a 6-8 ft. woven strap
with a ratchet device for tightening) to collapse the tire fully.  The valve
stem was replaced with the clamps in place.  When the clamps were removed
the tire remained very close to its original shape and fit back into the well.

Subject: 914 CV's and emergency brake questions

Hi all, I have two things on my car to-do list, and figure I need some
opinions from the net.

This is a '73 914 1.7 with at least 130,000 miles on it.  I know from having
both the half-shafts off the car previously that all the CV's are grooved
badly.  Also, I still have the joints from a previous car that got parted
at like 180,000mi and they look grooved also.  How bad do they have to look
before I'm in danger on such a low-powered machine?  If I replace them, new
ones are quite expensive.  I'm sure I can scratch up some used ones, but of
course I'll have take them apart and see the condition.  Any possibility of
some VW parts fitting, which would cost maybe half as much?

Also, I've been adjusting the emergency brake (needed for inspection in MA).
I was shocked that both rear calipers work and the mechanism for the
emergency brake is operational.  The haynes manual specifies pad clearance
of .008 for the rears, but only .002 for the fronts.  To get adequate brake
action for the emergency brake, I've lowered the clearance to about .003 in
the rears without noticing any problems yet.  And a bonus is that the free
play in the pedal is much less.  My question is if a lower clearance is
likely to pose a problem.  (Yes, I adjusted the cables also.  I can't get
them perfect because for some reason the spring on the left caliper is much
stronger than the right one)

I am looking at Oil coolers to put on my 67 911 and would like the wisdom
of the net on several points.

1. Factory fender mount cooler, Terbotrol or other assorted aftermarket 
coolers. Which one is better? Remeber this is a 2 liter motor and I 
want to make sure the oil temp does rise to a decent operating temp.
This car is used for 6-7 track events a year in Colorado so it does suffer 
from lack of air.

2. Factory plumbing vs rubber hose plumbing. Are both adequate? Is the 
heat loss through the brass tubing running to the front significant?

3. Will the plumbing from a 69 bolt right into a short wheel base 67 
or will it need modification?

4. Is the factory thermostat better than aftermarket thermostats?

5. Are the oil hose connections on a 67 the same as a 69 or will I 
need adaptors? I know adaptors are needed for the terbotrol.

6. Is $550 a fair price for a 69 oil cooler and factory plumbing? 
   Is $500 a fair price for a used terbotrol?

I am looking forward to your opinions?

Subject: Hidden VIN & 930 Clutch Chatter Questions

Hello!

I've got three quick questions:

1. My new (to me) 930 is a stark glossy white color for which I think the
   English name is Grand Prix White. Is this correct? I know there is another
   Porsche color called Alpine White, but I think it has a hint of blue in it.

2. Anybody know anything about a "hidden" VIN or ID number Porsche stamps deep
   within the cars (some disassembly required)? This is not the model plate,
   windshield frame, or trunk floor number. A knowledgeable Porsche guru told
   me about it but doesn't know where it is on 911s, just on 356s.

3. My 930 has what I would consider to be "severe" clutch chatter. A friend of
   mine who has owned 6 930s says it is common for 930 clutches to chatter.
   Any corroboration on this?

Tom,

I recently had exactly the same symptom. Couldn't get a good diagnosis
because the car was never cold at the dealer's, etc....

It is almost certainly a loose timing belt. The water pump seized recently,
and as I was on the road (actually, at the Parade in Lake Placid), I had the
car flatbedded to my dealer on the Burlington, Vermont side of the lake (Lake
Champlain, that is). They confirmed the seized water pump, but also told me
that the timing belt was "very loose". Scary stuff, as valves and pistons
tend to meet if they jump timing. Belts were changed about 20,000 miles ago,
and will be again while I'm doing the water pump.

I recommend strongly that you get the car to your dealer ASAP for a belt
adjustment, unless you have the special $400-500 tension guage. They will
probably want the car left overnight. I also have been given a recommendation
that after new belts are installed, they should be re-tensioned after 2,000
miles of "stretch-in" has occurred.

And try to avoid red-lining it on the way to the dealer!

Best of luck!

Subject:  Valentine-1 radar detector - concealed kit

Tracy...I have said V-1 concealed display kit (CDK).  It consists of a
small black plastic trapazoidal box and some wiring & widgets, etc.

The CDK is around the same size/shape of a staple clip puller and it
installs electrically _between_ the V-1 and its power supply.  It does
NOT alter the main unit.

You'll still need to have the main unit mounted somewhere - No advice
(mine remains suction cupped onto the windshield).  The CDK is a
concealed DISPLAY, not a complete control box.  The CDK's front looks
like the V-1's display and it has a _display_ONLY_ on/off switch, which
toggles between the V-1's displayand the remote's display.  You can't
turn the whole unit on/off or control its volume.

I'd call the concealability of the CDK as only "fair".  It is deeper
(thicker) than I expected it to be, so a simple, low profile surface
mount are a nogo, and the front is NOT parallel to the back (trapazoid),
so any surface that the back likes, the front will either point the right
way or thw WRONG way (it faces to the left, so it should be mounted to
the right of the driver...this is what trashed my plan).  Think about
maybe trying velcro on top or bottom surfaces instead?

I have my CDK on one of the "standard" mounting points, the tip of the
cigarette lighter adaptor.  It moves the display down and out of the line
of sight for any vehicles following behind me, which is enough for now.

Finally, it uses standard telephone wire & RJ jacks.  Nice & easy, but
don't use an "unstealthy" wire color (white in a black interior)...

Subject: Testing Fuel Injectors

Recently there was a short thread dealing with testing fuel injectors.  I 
just checked the operation of mine (mechanical injectors, '72 911E) as 
follows.  I used a small nitrogen cylinder with a regulator and good 
pressure gauge attached.  The injectors, one at a time, were connected 
to the regulator output through about 3 feet of tubing which I filled 
with gasoline for each injector test.  I cranked up the regulator until 
the injector opened, noted the pressure at the opening point, and 
observed the uniformity of the discharge.  

It actually worked well - all injectors opened between 260 and 265 psi 
 - --the spec book calls for 15-18 kp/cm**2 which is 217-260 psi, with a 
maximum deviation of 3 kp/cm**2 or 43 psi.   The spray patterns 
were easy to see, and in fact one of the injectors had a somewhat 
lopsided pattern, more or less like a shower head with a few clogged 
holes.  I tried running carb cleaner through it instead of gasoline, but 
it didn't change the pattern.  Do you think it'll make a noticeable 
difference?

I measures the height of my 911 from the ground to the bottoms of the fender

I have Konis all around and 185/70/15 tires all around.
Oh, and its a '73 911.

My question is, Is this the correct ride height for my car?  Also, the

Subject: 914 FI Question

Hello everyone,

This past weekend while participating in a local PCA autocross, my 914 decided to
die mid-run and coast off silently to the sidelines... Since it was a nitecross, and my
patience was limited, we (I and my autocrossing friend) decided to just use his car
(Fiat X-1/9) and worry about the 914 later. After getting the car home, I discovered
the crippling ailment was no more than a blown FI fuse on the relay board. While
replacing the FI fuse I discovered a previously unseen second fuse holder conspicuously
empty nearer to the firewall on the relay board. I checked all my reference material
and nothing listed the purpose of this second fuse. Does anyone (Stan?) know
what the function of the fuse closest to the firewall on the 914 (76 2.0L) relay box is???
For what it's worth, the car ran fine without it... To be safe I placed a fuse in it and confirmed
that it does see 12v when the iginition is on... 

Oh yes... my friend shocked several highly modified 911 owners by taking 1st in the nitecross
in a stock X1/9. Needless to say, he's a very talented driver.

On the Automobile Atlanta front, I too am less than happy with those folks. I called to order 
some parts and a catalog, I needed a shift bushing kit for my 914, when I asked about
the existance of a kit, they quoted me individual prices for each bushing. I went ahead 
and ordered 4 bushings for $70 and a catalog for $6, when I got the order in, I checked
the catalog (marked $5) and found a 6 piece shift bushing kit that contained the 4 I ordered
and 2 more that I would've liked to got for $45. Heck they overcharged me for everything,
including the catalog... I think I'll try stoddard's for my next order, too bad for AA cause I
seem to be spending a fair chunk of change on my little project... and they won't get any.

I am no expert on EPA regulations, but I thought I would relate a recent

state have been upgraded (at probably great expense) to allow testing at
something approximating full load.  No more idle testing here.  There are
two or three emissions testing places in each affected county with each having
several "bays."  The upgrade included all new testing equipment with an in-
floor chassis dynamometer ($$$) in each bay!  The car is tested in gear (in
drive or high gear) at about 3k RPMs.

So, you may want to consider that they days of idle-only testing may be
numbered in your neck of the woods as well.

The "trick" to releasing the cloverleaf spring is to use a LARGE pair of

the same direction as the rotor turns.

Don't take the caliper apart.  It would be an expensive lesson.

Actually, the hot setup is the smallest craftsman vise grips available,
with the curved jaw.  You can adjust them so they hold the bowtie
compressed while you change the pads.  Push toward the center of the
rotor when compressing and the wire will disengage from the retaining plate.

I also take a set of the large (10") vise-grips and put them on one of
the ears of the brake pad.  Push in and out (perpendicular to he rotor
surface plane) until it is loose.  Next exteract the pad about 3/4",
and use it as a lever to retract the pistons.  Remove ONE pad at a time
and replace.

It is actually possible to do this without ever touching the old brake
pad, as evidenced by "Hot Swaps" at the track.

Lastly, take a screwdriver and guide in the bowtie, then release the
vise grip.  is will save inched fingers.

Mark, I too reduced (below specs) the clearance between the pads and the

a bit grooved, putting in a feeler gauge between pad and disk probably
doesn't measure the true clearance anyhow. I simply adjusted until there
was no binding. However, if your calipers need rebuilding, and the pistons
don't spring back too well, that's another story... Michael

I think I missed part of this discussion due to the Parade, but
I have some input and questions. By the way the parade was great, but there
was an overload of gorgeous cars to the point that I wouldn't take a second
glance at a slopenose Turbo passing on the street, whereas normally I will
break my neck to glance at a '76 911...

I tried the "new" WR5DP platinums (call them K-Mart Bosch plugs) when they
came out and was not impressed. First of all, just by looking at them they
seem a bad design, the spark seems "squooshed" by the large ceramic tip which
covers the tiny piece of platinum in the tip. They did not run very well in
my 2.4 S engine, they tended to get "dirty" easily and I went through several
sets before I gave up. Many other people have complained about these plugs in
various engines.

I have used the NGK B7EV platinum plugs with moderate success - I've been
running the same set since '91 and they are OK. I believe these are
now the "gold paladium" plugs that Jeff Shorey mentioned.
I chose
these principally on price, as they were about $3-$4 at the time (now higher
because of the crazy Yen exchange rate...) These can be found at most
motorcycle shops, about $6 now I think.

But I think the real Bosch plugs will work better in my 911 and want to try
them. Does anyone know where I can get W3DP0 plugs for a reasonable price?
(let me guess... Automotion NOT).

I've since found them at (800) MR BOSCH for $12.50, and they also have the
NGK for $5.

Subject: SCCA Stock ride height rules

Sorry this message is late, I've had problems sending from America Online.

I am intimately aware of this rule and it's enforcement.

Basically, the rear of a 914 has NEVER been legally allowed to be lowered. If
springs sagged, they could be protested (and were several times, even by
yours truly). If the ride height was lower than the factory specs (which
allow for some sagging) then the car was illegal.
The front of a 914 (and rear of 911) could be lowered because it was
a suspension adjustment. But now even suspension adjustments are illegal if
the adjustment is PRIMARILY for ride height. Thanks to this rule I've left
SCCA autocrossing for the time being, and set my car up to the more liberal
PCA "P" specs. 

If you have the shop manual (you BETTER HAVE IT if you plan on competing in
SCCA, and bring it with you to any divisional, Pro, or national) you will see
how the rear ride height is measured. (Do I sound like Stan???)

I don't think there is any need for a clarification-the rule is clear. But I
think there is a need to DROP THE STUPID RULE to allow us to compete in cars
that don't look like they are on stilts! Have you ever seen a 70's 911 at
stock ride height with 50 series tires???

Jay,

The only "warning" I had of water pump failure was a _very_ small trail of
dried coolant visisible on the lower front of the block (seen during last oil
change). I had accepted the sign as a potential leak, but it didn't look
serious enough to make a pre-emptive strike on the pump: silly me!

I understand that during World War II some genius actually suggested that all
submarine sailors should have their appendix removed to preclude an
appendicitis attack during a patrol! I am at a loss as to how to know when
the H2O pump should be replaced "just before it would fail" as the symptoms
were pretty subtle (to me). BTW, my car has about 48,000 miles on it,
original water pump, and the car is not driven during our long Vermont
winters. This may have been the key contributor to the seal failure. Once the
seal fails, coolant flushes out the bearing grease.

I should also mention that just prior to the failure, the car had been
running its normal cool self, even at 90 degrees F ambient with the A/C on.
The temp guage just shot up to the red over a period of perhaps 15-30
seconds.

One other lesson I learned; my car did not come with one of the special
eye-bolts which screw into the threaded block behind the top nose slot
(covered with the black plastic cover). Without this (cringe) the flatbed
driver had to hook webbing around the lower front suspension arms to pull it
onto the flatbed. The dealer had one, and when the car was returned to me I
could see how much easier and safer it made the job. I'm going to order one
from PCNA and keep it in the car. I understand from the dealer that the
latest cars come with them.

Subject: Handling and body flex

Howdy,
I'm new to this group. I'm not really a serious "car person", just enjoy
driving/showing off my '78 911SC Targa.

My question: maybe it's my imagination, but I swear the handling on my 911
has been going downhill steadily. I've replaced the shocks/struts all the
way 'round with Bielstein "sports", had my mechanic go all through the
front end, checked tires (a few flat spots from winter storage, nothing
major), etc., to no avail.

What can you all tell me about body flex? I've read a little about it from
the archives (that was painful), but still have a few basic questions. Would
it explain the "unstable" feel that has been creeping into my car? Is there
anything one can do about it? Is there anything known/obvious I should look
for, like broken welds in the frame, loose body attachments, etc.? Is there
some other direction I should be investigating (sway bars, springs, ...)?

Performance Products sells a "performance camber brace" that attaches
between the strut towers and supposedly stiffens the front end. Does this
work? It seems like the weakest cross-section would be through the
passenger cabin on targa/cabriolet models, since there is no hard-top

Yes.
 
If you are not atomizing the fuel completely, the bigger droplets will
not burn completely, you will be down on power, HC and CO, and fuel
consumption will go up.

So does his equipment. If it's producing 4 ppm HC, one of two things:
1) the equipment is way off or
2) the engine is not running and a mouse living in the exhaust
pipe farted.
 
A CO reading of 0.02% is equally ridiculous.
 
No idea what the dilution thing is. Like many doctors and other mechanics,
this guy has no idea what he's doing, but knows how to talk to get the

On the other hand, if you have biannual smog inspections like we have in

You need to take off the inside door panel to get to it.  There are two
10mm nylock nuts holding the door handle on...one at the front, and one sort
of in the middle.  There is an access hole in the inside of the door to help
you get to the middle nut.  That's it - make sure it doesn't fall to the
ground when you remove the nuts.

PS you need to roll the window up.

    After taking my 71 911 to Watkins Glen for a couple of days of Dr.

    shifting quickly from 1st to 2nd, 2nd grinds.  I am pretty sure we

Subject: 911 cam cover - an oil leak

Gents

I have a 1980 911 Turbo which has had minor oil leaks since I baught it. None
appear to be too bad - no real oil leak just weaps. One is annoying me more 
than the others as it drips oil - one or two drops - onto the offside (right 
side from the rear as this is a rt hand drive) heat exchanger. Although this is
not a real problem it smells and the occasional smoke signal causes me the odd 
panic attack. So far I have checked all the nuts (no problem, no cure) and this
weekend changed the gasket - no problem, no cure. I have tightened the nuts as
far as I dare (gently by hand - any idea what the right torque is anyone?) but
to no avail. The oil appears to be coming down the stud threads rather than 
past the gasket. Has anyone an idea how to stop this leak???

Any replies will be much appreciated

    If you have pressed off the joints from the shafts make sure that
    you put the spring washer back on properly (cup side toward the
    CV).  If you have done it right it will seem impossible to get
    the circlip back on (the spring pushes the CV off the shaft,
    making it impossible to snap the clip in the grove).  The trick is
    to place the clip over the end of the shaft and place a socket (I

OK, I'll bite...  What's on a Carrera that causes "a lot more unsprung
weight" than a SC?  Likewise, does anyone have the measurements (Cd,
frontal area, whatever) that show "a lot of extra drag"?  (Numbers please,
not "proof by handwaving"...)

Here's the weight and HP numbers I have (from "The Used 911 Story", by
Peter Zimmermann):

Year  Model    Disp  Weight   HP
78-83 SC       3.0   2552     180
84-86 Carrera  3.2   2756     207
87-89 Carrera  3.2   2756     217

So, the Carrera is 8% heavier and has 15%-20% more horsepower.

Mark Blaskovich related a his recent experiences with State Farm.  I'd
like to second his story.  A few months ago, while dodging a pickup
truck in my lane, I put my 914 in a pasture and in the process
totaling the car.  There were no witnesses and the other driver did
not stop.  From State Farm's point of view, it must have looked like I
just drove off the road.  Nevertheless they were very fair and
professional with me.  They did a survey of other 73 914 2.0Ls sold in
my area and their settlement, while nowhere near what it took to
repair the car, was reasonable: almost exactly what I had paid for the
car seven days earlier.

I'm sure for every positive experience, there are horror stories about
State Farm's behavior.  However, they were quite reasonable with me.
For now, State Farm continues to have my business.

I probably should have walked away with the settlement instead of
having Jim Nichols at PCR fix it, but that's another story.

I have an 87 911 carrera I brought to California from Mass.  It is a
49 state car.  In california, they test at an idle, then at 2500rpm
and then return to an idle to check emmisions under decel.  My car
has 36K miles on it and tests 0% for CO and in the same 4ppm range
for HC.  The car was tested 2 years ago when I arrived and again just
a month or so ago, same results.

When I arrived, they charged me a one time $300 for my 49 state car, even
though it passed the california test.


Are the calif. cars really different as they leave porsche, or has porsche
chosen to only "certify" a percentage of the cars even though they are
the same.  My 86 mercedes, that I brought and my 88 saab were 50 state
cars (had the california label on them) and to the disappointment of
the DMV, I was not charged the $300 tax for them.

Subject: Valentine-1 info summary

Dear porschephiles:
	Just thought I'd send out a quick summary of the reponses I received to my
questions about the Valentine-1 radar detector with the remote display.  From
the responses I received, I decided that the remote display wasn't worth the
money.  It was small and didn't provide remote access to the controls.  In
addition, the back is angled so that the display points left when you mount
it (which makes it difficult to use when mounted on the driver's left).  Nobody
seemed to have any experience with the laser detector.  I was also warned that
I couldn't (or rather, wouldn't want to) mount the unit remotely since it
required a 360 degree "view" since it detected radar from the sides and back.
	So, I think I'm going to go with the vanilla Valentine-1.  I saw an ad for
the new Escort 5000 and shied away when I read "displays far more traffic 
information than conventional LED detectors".  Just what I need when I'm 
cruising at extra-legal speeds: an instrument I can't read at a glance.  It
also appears to be angled so that it is only usable from the driver's right.
Not that I'm planning to mount the unit on my left, I just don't want the
choice dictated to me.  Hmm, now that I look at it again, so's the V-1. Bummer.
	Oh well, my two cents.  Thanks to everyone who dropped me a clue!

    Yes.  Stomp your foot all the way to the floor.  This activates
"full throttle enrichment" which (on some cars) puts you into an open-
loop control mode.  The Lambda sensor no longer alters your mixture.
The FI just dumps more gas in so you can create lots of gnarly carbon
monoxide and get more power.

was a truly impressive thing, so you might see if 100+ octane gas

    Hi!
    The autocross Sunday was fun.  Too bad we didn't get Ted out

together a 45.2 to take my class, however.  Not a great run, but it
was a lot better than taking out three cones--which I did for each

    A couple of weeks ago I posted a note that went something like
    this:

    "After replacing the rear wheel bearings, rebuilding the 1/2
    shafts, and replacing the starter, I finally got my 1971 911 back
    on the road.  The problem now is that the alternator light glows
    dimly at low revs and is a little brighter at high revs...."

    This posting is not intended in any way as a counter to the great
    advice responding to my original posting, but merely as an FYI
    to those that might experience the problem I had.

    While driving to Watkins Glen last week from Maryland we went
    through York, PA.  While there I noticed I didn't have a horn, my
    radio was dead, the car was dying at higher rpms and that with the
    motor running I only had about 6 volts at the battery (I might add
    that I had to jump start the car that AM).

    We found an alternator repair shop that said they might be able to
    help so we drove there.  To make a long story short (4 hours and a
    quassi alternator rebiuld later), we found the problem.  While
    installing the new starter I failed to connect the red wire
    to the starter.  The black wire gives the starter power from the
    battery but apparently the charging system requires the red wire
    to complete the circuit to the alternator and thus charge the
    battery.  I hope that someone out there can benefit from my
    stupidity and either avoid the mistake, or diagnose it more
    cheaply and more quickly in the future.

high performance on this wheel?  And looks good on the 14" rim.  I'm
considering Yokohama 508's(opinions)?  Where in the San Jose, CA area is priced
right?
2)  Since this was an option wheel and tire, did Porsche set the speedometer

3)  I'm also probably going to get a rear and possibly front sway bar, how does
this affect my tire choice if any?  
4)  Can I set up the alignment myself?  Since I'm getting the impression that

Mike,
   Just a comment about your ventilation question.  I have to note that
living in Alabama has had one advantage for me.  I don't have to store my
911 for nearly six months of the year like I did when I lived in Bozeman,
MT.  As you would guess, I have had some experience storing cars and don't
think it is ever good for them.  Though I loved Montana and hated to
leave, I have to admit that from a car standpoint I get a lot more use out
of my 911 here in Alabama than I ever did there.  My 74 (which I had 
then) also had the same ventilation problems you describe and I never 
found anything to do except open the windows (the 74's also had rear 
windows that would swing out so that helped a lot with air flow.  You 
might consider trying to retrofit that type of rear window to your car).  It 
does get hot in Montana but the humidity isn't very high so it seems 
less uncomfortable.

(Mike - your return address bounced so I'm posting to the list.)

Concerning improving cabin air flow in a 911... I haven't seen the
subject discussed recently, here's MHO:   

My '83 SC came to me (in '88) with nonfunctioning factory air.  I
promptly removed it.  On the factory air installation, the
evaporator/blower (the part that makes the cold air) is in the little
well under the trunk and behind the gas tank (and forward of the
passenger's feet).  That blower was set up to recirculate cabin air,
drawn from the passenger footwell, thru the evaporator coil and then
thru plumbing and to the cabin A/C vents.  What I did was 1) take the
evaporator coil out and replace it with an air filter; and 2) modify the
airflow so that the blower draws outside air from under the car rather
than from the cabin/footwell.  Thus the former A/C unit becomes another
source of outside air into the cabin.  (The "under the car" air winds up
coming thru the tunnel around the steering rack and thus mostly from the
wheel wells, hence the air filter... this might not be practical if you
drive a lot of dirt roads).  This setup *feels* like it roughly doubles
the airflow over what the in-dash heater/ventilator fan provides... i.e.
the airflow is still totally inadequate for any temperature over 75 F on
anything sunnier than a mostly cloudy day.  The in-dash plumbing pretty
well throttles the considerable output of the A/C blower, so one of
those mod kits from Performance Aire might help that.  An equal problem,
for this non-recirculating approach, is that the air can't get OUT of
the cabin except at the top of the rear window.  I haven't figured out
what to do about that (except open a door window 1" or so, which sucks
it right out with only a little noise).  Maybe add air extractor
plumbing from the rear speaker deck into the (noisy) engine compartment?  
 
I realize you have an early 911 so none of this will directly apply.
Still, I think that little compartment is there in the floor of the
trunk (wasn't it originally for the auxiliary gas heater?).
That's where I'd start... think in terms of putting an 8" centrifugal
blower there, and pumping outside air into the cabin thru a few
discreetly located holes.

Now, has anyone been able to do anything about the 911 DEFROSTER, and
the tendency of the windows to steam up at the slightest provocation,
like say, the driver trying to breathe?

Subject: Answer-headliner install 911 SR coupe

Steve,

When I had my 73 911T restored, the shop that did the bodywork was
going to contract out the headliner install to another shop. The other 
shop went TU (out of business) and they decided to do it themselves
at "the same cost as the headliner shop". After they got the headliner 
installed, they wished that they had looked a bit harder as they said 
it was a royal pain to put in and took them about twice the time they 
actually billed for it, and they didn't do too great a job to boot.

The moral: If you have lots of time to do a careful job, then go for
it. Otherwise, find someone who installs them regularly who knows 
how to do it well. Best of luck.

To combine messages, I have a question regarding engine swapouts. I 
have a 73 911T that I put an '83 SC engine in. It runs great and I 
have no problems, but my temperature gauge seems to work, but indicates
what I think are abnormally low temps (no higher than 200 deg), 
especially for Las Vegas in summer with no oil cooler. Is there 
anything that needs to be done to adapt the SC engine to the older
temp gauge? Thanks in advance for any help.

One of the reasons I sold all my English cars and acquired my German

vastly since they controlled all of the electrical circuits in my Lotus 
Elan with two 35 amp fuses!  However, in last night's paper:

"Associated Press and Bloomberg Business News"

"NEW YORK - Lucas Industries PLC is under criminal investigation for 
lapses in inspections of parts used in Boeing commercial jets, THE WALL 
Street Journal reported today.

"The Lucas devices control flaps on Boeing 767 twin-engine jets, and 
Lucas is the only company that makes the parts, the paper said".

The article goes on with Lucas' denial, and ends with a statement that on 
May 16, Lucas pleaded guilty to falsifying test data for parts supplied 
for the U.S. Air Force's Maverick missle system.

Guess I'll quit complaining about Bosch prices for a while.

Tom,
	I had the same symptoms several months ago on my '85 944.

Warning, these were my observations and not necessarily advice on what to do.  

	To make sure it was the timing belt slapping, I removed the top belt 
cover and ran the engine when it was cold.  I noticed that the belt was 
"flapping" as it came off the bottom of the cam gear.  I turned off the engine 
and checked the tension by hand and found that the belt had enough play to hit 
the bottom of the top belt cover in that area.  When I took the car to my 
mechanic warm, the belt always "felt" right (ie. no tension tool used).  
Several months later, I let him have the car cool; he tightened the belt and 
now, no more belt flapping.  It has the infamous "my belts are too tight" 
droning sound now.  

	Any net-advice on whether or not this condition is OK?  Also, what's 
the net-wisdom on re-tensioning the belts by hand.  My mechanic has been doing 
it this way for years.  I believe he was a "Master technician" at the former 
local dealership until he had a falling out with the service manager regarding 
what was pushed on the customer as "necessary repairs".

Last time I checked (and because I asked about SC vs. Carrera), SCs
weren't made until 1978, so pre-78 cars are irrelevant.

76-77 911S     2.7   2425     165

Assuming a 3.0 liter engine weighs the same as a 2.7 liter engine (!),
your '77 body (2425 lbs) with 3.0 liter (180 hp) engine has 13.472 lbs/hp.

The numbers do not coincide with your handwaving...

    I don't know about the rest of you all, but in my 944, this will

My experience with State Farm has been good also, with some
qualifications.  They clearly have no interest in insuring anyone with the
slightest statistical chance of having an accident and they mercilessly
"cherry pick".  I am presently in good with them but I currently have them
insuring my house and four cars including a Ferrari and a 911.  Rates are
very reasonable.  But, reality isn't very far away.  If you have any kind
of an accident, even if clearly not your fault, you get rated and pay more
for 5 years anyway.  They're not interested in details; if they pay our
for any reason, you pay it back.  However, they do pay off fairly and
quickly when it's their turn.  All things considered, they get good marks
from me. However, If I were 25 years old, single, one speding ticket and
driving a Corvette, They would hesitate about 5/8 of a second before
showing that person the door.

Theodosios -

Federal (US and other countries') emissions testing puts each car
through a specified program of speeds and loads.  All exhaust gas
during the course of the whole run is gathered and analyzed for
its chemistry.  (Alternatively, instead of gathering all gas, they
will store exhaust at a certain percentage rate.)  Different countries
prescribe different test cycle contents, governments being what
they are.

In most of the US, at least, post-manufacture testing is as you
describe: at idle only.  This seems to give aftermarketers pretty wide
license.  (And it also fosters one of the great stupidities: in the
US we cannot purchase factory cars like the 959 or 968 RS.  But we
can legally build and modify our own little death-traps.)

Subject: Space saver spares (and carrara 4)

The rumor I heard on  993 C4 was that the multi plate clutches (there
were never any viscous devices) are to be replaced by torsen diffs and
all wheel traction control similar to the ABD option on the 2 wheel
drive 993.I saw an interesting demo of the ABD system which showed how
the torsen diff does not "lock up"if both wheels do not have some
traction.The ABD was disconnected and while the car was on a hoist
one old rim was placed under one rear tire and the car was put in gear.
The other wheel just spun like it had a fully open diff! until the
brakes were tapped and then the rim shot out from under the other wheel!

The 959 AWD system was inferior to the C4, without a center diff it was
only 2WD until the computer directed power forward AFTER slip was
detected with the constact wear ofter center clutch pack.The C4 is
constant 4 wheel drive , with power shared be all wheels ( the rear C.V.
bolts are even smaller than in a C2 beacase of the shared load )and the
torque splits modulated by the PDAS/ABS computer .The 959 required the
driver to select the traction program with stalk switch, the C4 system
chooses its own "program" and is not as sensitive to tire wear.

Be careful with this statement, two issues I have:  1)  There is no more
thermal energy in 100 octane than 93 or even 80, there may even be less.
The only way (I can see) that 100 octane would help is if your performance
is being limited by detonation, in which case the higher octane fuel
will help because it is less prone to that particular problem. 2) 100
octane fuels that I've seen used are high in lead - a big problem if
your engine/exhaust (in particular cat. converter) wasn't designed
for it.  Not sure what the content of "race gas" is, the guys around
here use 100LL airplane gas.  100LL (LL=Low Lead, a mis-nomer) has
20 times the lead content of old "regular" gas.

Thanks Steven,

I'm wondering if there's a trick to getting these back together again.
I remember years ago doing this on my VW Rabbit and it was a tricky

Subject: 911 Targa handling and body flex

Bill DeCamp has questions on his Targa flexing.

I doubt that targa body flex is your problem. My '72 S Targa has lots of
miles in autocross and doesn't flex more than many low mileage targas I've
seen. You can do a simple flex test by opening the engine compartment with
the targa top on, and holding your finger on the joint between the top and
roll bar. Then have a LARGE person push down on the strike-plate area of your
engine compartment will all his weight. You shoulld feel a SLIGHT seperation.
You can also try this while driving with the top on, feel the top move
against the windshield pillar. Compare to a later model car to get an idea of
the flex.

I think your problem could be the rear suspension arm bushings-particularly
the large rubber pieces on the control arm-to-body connection. These will
make your car handle terribly. The front end is usually not as much a
problem. When this happened to my car, it was  so unstable that I would spin
out in autocrosses in any hard left turn, with NO POSSIBLE RECOVERY!
(my right rear bushing was disintegrated.)

As for the camber brace, probably not worth it, I think you are right that
the flex in a targa is in the cabin.

     Hi all,  I have a 1971 911T and am wondering about the oil pressure 
     gauge. After a cold start it reads about 60psi.  After driving about
     10 miles or so, the pressure starts dropping.  At about 60Mph, it

     Is this normal? 
     
     It drops to 0 when idling. (I understand this is normal)
     
     I have changed the oil filter recently.  The oil was still pretty

     The new filter did not seem the make any difference.  It seems to me

Not heard of this particular company but it sounds like you're talking
about cermichrome type cylinders.  I just overhauled my airplane engine
and used cermichrome cylinders.  This is a coating used inside the
cylinder barrel, is this what you're talking about ?  If so, here's
how it applies to aircraft piston engines, maybe it applies to
P car engines too.

Originally (through WWII) the cylinder barrel was steel, which was honed
in a specified pattern.  The honing (cutting lots of little grooves)
retained oil on the cylinder wall.  The rings were a much harder chrome
steel which would flatten out the tops of the ridges left by honing during
the break in process (assuming it was broken in correctly) which made a
nice seal.  Plain steel barrels wear quickly though.

The next thing that was tried was nitriding the steel barrels.  This
means the barrel is heated up and baked in an ammonia (I think) atmosphere
which causes nitrogen to bond to the steel in the top few molecules.
The results in a residual compressive stress at the surface of the steel
cylinder which makes it harder.  It still uses chrome steel rings, wears
less, but rusts esp. when not run for long periods.  These nitrided barrels
are still honed for oil retention.

The next thing tried to chroming the inside of the cylinder.  Chrome
surfaces are impossible to hone, so they way they retained the oil is
to "channel" the chrome.  They way they do this right at the end of the
plating process they reverse the polarity (and possibly jump the current
up ?) for a few milliseconds which causes thousands of cracks in the
chrome.  In these engines since the barrel material is hard, you now
use soft steel rings.  The problems with chrome are 1) it's very hard
to get the right number, size and consistency in the channels in the
chrome, 2) it's expensive, 3)  There are problems with break in and
heat which make chrome cyls not all that great anyway.

Cermi-chrome (which is a tm), or ceramic chrome, is the latest technology
to come into voge in the airplane world.  It's been around a long time
though, I think an English guy invented it for Mercruiser outboard
engines 10-20 years ago.  What they do here is to plate the barrel with
chrome still, but instead of channeling the chrome they press millions
of little tiny chips of ceramic material into the surface while it is
still soft (I guess there must be heat somewhere then).  They use
softer steel rings.  The ceramic retains the oil.  The way they make
sure they have the right number of ceramic chips is to shine a laser
down the barrel and count the reflections (not my hand, they use
a computer).  They seem to work great.  Long lasting, corrosion
resistant barrels with a good wear life and good compression and also
good oil retention characteristics.

My experience (now about 100 hours on the new engine) and that of
other I know who have them (one guy up to 1500hrs so far) has shown
they work great.  Before cermichrome we typically went through a
quart of oil every 6-10 hours (828 to 1,380 miles).  Now I only
check the oil between oil changes which I do every 50 hours.

Sorry if this is long winded and possibly not on the subject, but
you did ask.

Ah Ted do you ever think about what you post???  Your now braging that
your car has a worse power to weight ratio than the 84-86 Carerra!

Heavy sarcasim mode on;

to get these numbers we have used an advanced numerical technique called
Division.  Since your dividing the weight of the car by the power you
want the lowest number possible (alternatly you can divide the HP by the
weight which will give you the number of HP per pound). One HP pushing
one pound is better than one HP pushing 13 pounds.  Now as an exercise
lets calculate these weight to power ratios;
 78-83 SC       3.0   2552     180  2552/180=14.1778
 84-86 Carrera  3.2   2756     207  2756/207=13.3140
 87-89 Carrera  3.2   2756     217  2756/217=12.7005
 76-77 911S     2.7   2425     165  2425/165=14.6970
and your 77 with 3.0 power
 76-77 911S     2.7   2425     180  2425/180=13.4722

So we established that lower numbers are "better" therefore your 13.47
is not as "good" as the 13.31 of a stock 84-86.  How about thinking what
the numbers mean before posting.

Subject: 911 "M" Calipers

Hi All,

After my last request for info on why arent the early ('65 - '68) 911
cast iron calipers sold as rebuilt?  And, why isnt anyone offering to
rebuild them?

Here's my subjective research and wisdom of the net:  

There is a place in NYC that will install new cylinder wall inserts,
however, read on before you make that decision.....

I also called Dale at Stoddard, who "rebuilds" the cast iron calipers.
Here's what he does:  1) the rebuild is a media blasting of the caliper,
2) painting, 3) rebuild kit (seals), 4) Honing the cyl. walls(if necessary),
and 5) new stainless steel pistons (if necessary).

I asked why no new inserts and just honing?  The answer is that
the calipers are designed such that the seal sits in the cylinder wall
and the piston slides up and down through the seal.  Therefore, the
pitted/rusted cylinder walls do not affect the seal, the cylinder wall
just holds the piston seal.  So, just clean up the cylinder walls and
put in new pistons.  Pitted/rusted pistons will affect the seal, because
they actively slide through the seal, but, a honed cylinder wall will not
affect the seal.  Rather smart, those Germans.....

The only reason to put inserts in these early cast iron calipers would be
if the corosion/rust in the cylinders is causing some kind of metallic
reaction and is basically eating the caliper away.  I called around and
found new calipers were in the $275.00 ea range, so inserts for REALLY
bad/rusted calipers might be appropriate.

Anyway, I ordered new pistions, used "crocust cloth" to clean up the
cylinders, and will install a rebuild kit and bleed away.  Thanks to
those of you who responded to my question(s)

FYI,

In my experience it is difficult, but not impossible to talk yourself
onto a tour.  The tours are supposed to be for people who have bought
cars and are picking them up at the factory (or for people who have
written many months in advance and requested a tour).  

In my case I just showed up and asked nicely and they said no, only 25 
people were allowed on a tour and the had that many already.  I kept
pestering them (the fact that I speak German probably helped) and
eventually it turned out that someone who was picking up their car
didn't want to go on the tour so I got to go.  

If I were you I'd try faxing them now, then when you show up you can
honestly claim that did contact them.  I don't know the fax number,
but I would try contacting the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen
(sp?), which is also where the tour starts.

This isn't exactly true.  I haven't had any problems with State Farm.
I've just turned 25 and my wife and I have our Porsche and BMW on
State Farm - no we don't own a house so we don't have home owners 
insurance through them.  I pretty much fit your description except
that I'm married and State Farm has some of the better rates I've
found.

I would like to defend State Farm. I totalled a 11 month old car
[16K payout] in the high-speed single-car fashion after 9 claimless
years and only lost my good driver discount. No classification change.

Unfortunately, I only waited 6 months to claim another single car
accident [2K payout]. This resulted in my being moved from State Farms
Mutual coverage (preferred) to the Fire and Casualty. That one tripled
my rates for three years and then I was returned to Mutual at the same
rates I started at.

Net result: my adjusted rates cost me $4K for $18K in claims.

Of course, in Alabama, full coverage on a SC is only $700/year.

Subject: RE: 911 purchasing advice

smorgan (you didn't give your name):

If you're looking for a 911SC (1978-1983 model years), you might want to lean
towards the cars built after 1980 1/2. Any 911SC is a fantastic car and the
3.0 liter engine is a dream (got one in my '74). However, there are two
things I know of that Porsche did to the 1980 1/2 and later engines to solve
some potential problems: 1) The chain tensioners were beefed-up, eliminating
much of the causes of chain tensioner failures 2) The oil pickup venturi was
revised to eliminate some problems with oil collecting in the crankcase and
not returning to the oil tank.

As far as books are concerned, one every 911 owner should have is Bruce
Anderson's Porsche 911 Performance Handbook. Much of the book covers the
evolution of the 911, and one chapter is dedicated to buying used 911s.

If you're into open-air driving, the Targa is great. However, be prepared for
some additional maintenance as a result of the Targa top. Be sure to inspect
the condition of the top. Some of them leak and I've read many messages
regarding having to replace the top.

Good luck with your search!!!

    Evidently the Euro Carerra has somewhat higher compression than
the US version, and supposedly the timing is usually being retarded by
the knock sensor.  Higher-octane gas = no knock = advanced timing = 
more oomph.  Not sure if US-spec cars are being limited by that, but
it *might* be worth a try.

    Granted--definitely a problem for US-spec cars.  But, if you can find

Hi Guys,

I have a set of American Mags that were made specifically for the 1969 and later
911. They will work on the earlier (non-flared) 911 with the fender lip rolled.
They may be used on a 914/6 with fender lip rolled and carefully selected tires,
this is what I used them on.

The wheels are 7" x 15" and are the same type used by many 911R drivers to race 
on in the 1969-70 Trans-Am series. The wheels have only been used once for an 
autocross and are virtually new in all other respects. I found them in my garage
after wondering what the covered lump in the corner was. I'm asking $900 for 
the set of four with lug nuts. Buyer pays shipping outside California.

Well, we observed that carbon is water soluable some years ago, and started

Hi 'philes,

With the couple of e-mails recently about missing a shift on your 911 and 
maybe wrecking some valves, is there anything that can be done during the 
rebuild that would prevent this from happenning again?  Accidents do 
happen...sometimes more than once.  Are there better valve springs which 
would help avoid this?  While you're in there....perhaps a rod bolt upgrade 
would be in order - I realize for most applications other than racing, 
RACEWARE bolts aren't needed, but for $189.95 it sounds like cheap insurance 
while the engine is apart.

So, what can be done to make a 911 engine "happy" spinning at 9000 RPM?

As far as I know, it will not work out of a regular gun, unless that gun is

You don't need the expensive Wuerth gun, you can use the cheaper 3M gun but
the threads are different so you'll have to pour the SKS into an appropriate
bottle first, and then screw that to the gun.
 
Wash the gun with water right after you're done, and if anything has already

Correct you are!  I think ALL of the large companies do that, because they
can afford to.  When I bought my 911, I was only 22, an boy did I have fun
shopping for insurance.  I ended up with a rinky-dink operation in
Wisconsin, because it came to a point where I didn't have the luxury of
caring about service, it was all about price.  I made the mistake of
inquiring about full coverage (all I wanted was comprehensive, but out 
here anyway you gotta get comp and collision together - can you say "bend
over"?) and got a quote of $7600/year.  Since I only paid $7300 for the car,
I politely told them wher to stick it.

Now the disclaimer - I have had a bad attitude about insurance ever since
California made it mandatory, and called open season for the scam artists,
such as the mom and pop operations running out of shacks in the 
Carribean,etc.  Any guesses why?

I contacted these people when they began offering special Porsche insurance a
few years ago. I found out right away that I don't qualify because my 944 is
my daily driver, and they have only  2500 and 5000 annual mile plans.

A few months ago, though, I bought a 914 which will see only very
intermittent use, so I contacted them again. They offerd a *great* rate,
$600 per year, so I was very pleased. I am a home owner, so that was no
problem.

Then I read the fine print on the application: ONLY the owner and spouse can
drive the car. It is NOT insured if *anyone else* drives it. That killed
Leyland-West for me, since I know that sometimes other people will drive it.

Oh well ... (I stayed with my regular carrier for about $750.)

Subject: SC vs Carrera

I think that the weight advantage of a 77 911 with a 3.0l over a later car is
minimal. The weights published for different years do not take into account the
options. I believe that the 911s 74 and up have the same suspensions and brakes
at rear (carreras do have a slightly thicker rotors ) and front. 78 and up SC
have larger rear torsion bars. 86 and up carrera have larger sway bars and
heavier G50 trans. I think that the 915 trans were made with mag. cases on
earlier cars(74-76)and are lighter than the later 915 trans made of alum. The
2.7 engines had mag. cases and are lighter than the later 3.0 and 3.2 cases.
Some of the later cars came standard with fuchs alloys that are lighter than
the cast wheels on earlier cars. The large increase in weight on the SC is due
to more standard features(power windows, power locks, oil cooler etc)
Thus it is posible that a 77 911 that is loaded(power everything,sunroof,AC,oil
cooler etc) could be heavier than a SC that is a stripper. The big weight
gain was in 74. Thus a 77 911 should have almost no advantage in unsprung
weight over a SC and only marginal gains over a Carrera. With a 3.0 engine
and oil cooler(the one going to the front of the car)there is little weight
advantage either. As for drag the later cars are higher because of the rear
flares (but a car with front and rear spoilers may have a advantage). I would
like to see some weights of different cars from people that have had them
weighed (like while corrner balancing) before i would claim a weight advantage
for one year over another.

one really teaches good driving habits. Driver's Ed in the public school 
system is primarily "obedience school" unlike Europe where they really teach
you how to drive.

My friend had developed some bad habits that weren't as obvious in a lower
performance car:

    He used engine braking, downshifting for every stop. This really
    toasts 915 synchros and is an expensive way to brake. There is 
    no need to downshift unless there's a chance that you're going to
    need to accelerate again. Brake pads are much cheaper than syncros.

    He let up on the gas all the way when upshifting and downshifting,
    unbalancing the car and again causing the synchros to work overtime.
    By not letting the revs fall to idle speed between each shift, he
    could greatly smooth out his driving. He also had his hand on the shifter
    nearly all the time, which is bad for the trans and hinders for quick
    response time.

    His braking was light at first and progressively harder until he came
    to a stop, like this: |     |   |    |   | |||||||  (if that makes any
    sense) The problem with that is that there's no margin for error. If
    you misjudge, you either lock up or worse hit something. I told him to
    do more of his hard braking at the beginning, then modulate his braking
    as appropriate. He also found out the hard way that the rear end gets
    loose if you have to brake heavily in a turn. 

    He was shifting by engine noise rather than the tach, and never got the
    car much over 3,000 RPM. When I got him up into the power band, both
    he and the car were much happier.

As someone did for me when I got my 911, I demonstrated that a 911 can be 
driven smoothly, quickly and safely withought a lot of effort. I think he
feels a lot better about his car and hopefully it will save some wear and tear 
on both driver and car.

Hope this didn't sound too preachy. I'm not a perfect driver either, but I
thought it might give new P-Car drivers some things to watch out for.

Interesting concepts, none of them work to solve the problem. There
ARE answers though...

> So, what can be done to make a 911 engine "happy" spinning at 9000 RPM?

Bend over, lube up, and get the checkbook....

Doing IMSA GTU engines, where 9k was a must and more was better, we
figured once that not adding all the "make more HP" stuff from our
TRS bins, but keeping all the "spin up to 9K RPM" stuff would
*ONLY* cost someone off the street about $43k for an engine.

Of course, some portion of that is fixing the fact that the factory
intake system won't flow enough to take you to 9k, but most is in
stuff like titanium rods, lightened tool steel wrist pins, custom
pistons, some interesting valve gear, and Real Trick machine shop and 
assembly work. Not to mention dyno time....

So, your best investment *ONCE AGAIN* is learning how to drive! Spend
time at PCA track days, go to Skippy School, do something -- just get
that confidence that keeps you from *MAKING* that mistake in the
first place.

Mercury charges the same premium for my Porsche 944 as they would for any

Oh, that 911 is just a 901 with some different gearing... And the 7:31 
doesn't do you as much good as you think, since the other gears are
proportionately taller...

>     Some questions I have about this are:

Not advisible, but as the bad boys at Kennedy prove from time to time,
with enough steel, a good machine shop, and some imgination, you can
mate just about anything to just about anything....

>     -How about a flywheel and clutch- which ones do I use?

See above. I think you might be able to use the '83-6 915 flywheel
and a '71 911S clutch disk and pressure plate, but may need to
have new holes drilled and tapped for mounting, and possibly some
clearnacing done. I can't thik of anything else that might even
possibly work...

>     -Will the 911 box interface properly with the 3.2 motor?

Not clear. I've *NEVER* tried this. Common wisdom is that the 901
is out of beans when it comes to handling anything that makes 
as much torque and HP as the 3.2 -- and if not the box, then certainly
the CV joints....

>     -What are the hp limitations on a 911 box?

About 250 on a box in racing trim and maintained to racing specs. Probably
a pile less on your old tired box...

>     -What are some possible mods to the 911 box for higher hp?

Replace it with a 915. Sorry, I *know* it's a mess -- but at least you
have a long wheelbase tub so you *CAN* use the parts from a '72+
car, unlike the '68 conversion we did a while back...

understanding that these were a rubber centered clutch (in fact
I was planning on installing a spring centered clutch).  Were the
'82 911 clutches in actual fact spring centered, or has this been
updated ?

In fact, I'm hoping this discovery may save me a few dollars.  The
clutch plate is worn and will need replacing.  I'll also replace
the relase bearing, pilot bearing and flywheel bolts.  The pressure
plate is very, very slightly grooved in on place but on the whole is
in great shape.

I'm a little worried about the driven plate (? the plate on other
side of the clutch plate, thats on the end of the crank)
it has the same slight grooving, but it also has some fine, hair
sized cracks in the surface.  Is this normal ?  Does it need replacing
or is there a chance that simply resurfacing it will be ok ?

The summer in FL has been particularly uncomfortable this year and I have
been trying to get the a/c on my '77 911 to work a little more effectively.
 After a reasonable amount of work (and money) I think it is doing the job.
 I even had to turn it down yesterday afternoon (92F/90% hum.).    

The two major changes I made were 1) replacing the old single row rear
condenser with a newer double row and 2) adding an under-the-floor
condenser.  This required new hoses, but mine were 17 years old and rather
brittle, so no big loss. I am hoping that the additional condenser
capability will also pay off when I am forced to switch from freon.  

There is a nice piece in the latest "Up-Fixen der Porsche" on a/c
improvements which is what I used for guidance.  I would suggest it to
anyone trying to improve their a/c.

With regard to the fuse in the 914 relay board, nearest to the firewall:
The Haynes manual shows the wiring in the relay board, and even though they
don't explicitly show a 76, all the years they show are the same wiring
within.  You can't see it on the board unless you remove all that black
plastic goo underneath, but since it's simple wiring I believe Haynes.
What it shows is that the fuse nearest the firewall is not needed.  The left
side only goes to an unconnected pin.  However the right side is seeing
voltage because it is wired to several of the relays.

------------- Attached Message Follows -------------

Hello everyone,

This past weekend while participating in a local PCA autocross, my 914 decided 
to
die mid-run and coast off silently to the sidelines... Since it was a 
nitecross, and my
patience was limited, we (I and my autocrossing friend) decided to just use 
his car
(Fiat X-1/9) and worry about the 914 later. After getting the car home, I 
discovered
the crippling ailment was no more than a blown FI fuse on the relay board. 
While
replacing the FI fuse I discovered a previously unseen second fuse holder 
conspicuously
empty nearer to the firewall on the relay board. I checked all my reference 
material
and nothing listed the purpose of this second fuse. Does anyone (Stan?) know
what the function of the fuse closest to the firewall on the 914 (76 2.0L) 
relay box is???
For what it's worth, the car ran fine without it... To be safe I placed a fuse 
in it and confirmed
that it does see 12v when the iginition is on... 

Oh yes... my friend shocked several highly modified 911 owners by taking 1st 
in the nitecross
in a stock X1/9. Needless to say, he's a very talented driver.

On the Automobile Atlanta front, I too am less than happy with those folks. I 
called to order 
some parts and a catalog, I needed a shift bushing kit for my 914, when I 
asked about
the existance of a kit, they quoted me individual prices for each bushing. I 
went ahead 
and ordered 4 bushings for $70 and a catalog for $6, when I got the order in, 
I checked
the catalog (marked $5) and found a 6 piece shift bushing kit that contained 
the 4 I ordered
and 2 more that I would've liked to got for $45. Heck they overcharged me for 
everything,
including the catalog... I think I'll try stoddard's for my next order, too 
bad for AA cause I
seem to be spending a fair chunk of change on my little project... and they 
won't get any.

What were you thinking? The whole point of having a buried, hidden VIN that
few people know about is so that car thieves won't know to change it during
their "chop shop" process. Therefore, the car still has its original identity
which, if the car is suspected as being "hot", can be used to prove that the
car was stolen and that it belongs to its rightful owner. The Maestro was right
in not blurting out the location of the hidden 356 VIN all over the net.

IMHO, the Maestro was not trying be stuck-up about the hidden VIN thing. He said
he would divulge the information if someone had a legitimate question about a
possibly illegitimate car. If you suspected that your car had been stolen and
given a new identity somewhere down the line, you'd hope like hell the chop
shop didn't know about the hidden VIN. I am in this situation right now and
a hidden VIN on my 911 is the only way I'll ever know without a doubt what
I've got.

I really wish I hadn't brought up the thing about "hidden" VINs on Porsches.
I should've just written PCNA about my situation. What a mess!

PLEASE, IF ANYBODY ON THE NET KNOWS THE LOCATION OF A HIDDEN VIN ON 911S, DO
NOT DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION TO THE NET! REPLY PERSONALLY TO OWNERS WITH
LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT SHADY CARS.

During my 911 engine removal and teardown I am finding an unusual
and quite annoying thing.  It seems liked every single bolt and nut
that I remove has been locktited.  This includes nylock nuts and
even nuts/bolts that I would normally put anti-seize on !  Is there
a reason for this, or did Reinhardt just go crazy with locktite
when he made the engine 12 years ago ?  I guess what I really want
to know is, do I locktite everything when I put it back together ?

Subject: Use of ABS on track?

Hi,
 
I'd like to here your thoughts on using ABS in track events.
 
I have ABS in my car & went for a small spin at our last event.
Some drivers told me that in a spin ABS gets confused & shuts
down but mine didn't seem to (ABS 5).
 
Anyway, one driver who has ABS & whos opinion I respect said that
there was no way he'd ever unplug his ABS while on the track.
 
Do they use ABS in the SuperCup series? There was a nice spin
shown in the last televised race where the car ended up backwards
into a wall & didn't appear to slow down at all just before
hitting - while still going backwards.
 
So, what do you think?
 
John.

No clue, but you can still get the "old" version. It's one of those

> I see 4 valve 911 heads for sale now...

It is interesting to observe that the factory, which has a vested
interest in maintaining performance, etc. but which also has to worry
about liability, warranty issues, etc, will not use 4-valve heads that 
aren't water cooled. It might also be interesting to see if any of these 
aftermarket heads offer you any warranty better than the old "Oklahoma 
guarantee" -- i.e. if it breaks in half, you own both pieces. My bet is 
they don't. But it is a nifty way to extract a whole pile of money from 
the unsuspecting...

Stan

P.S. For the record, Luftmeister has been selling four valve heads for
BMW motorcycles (think of the engine as 1/3rd of a 911) for a long
time. The factory just started offering a four valve head last year.
Comments so far are that the engine is awesome but the maintenence 
cost change and reliability suck.

     Hi all,  I have a 1971 911T and am wondering about the oil pressure

     It drops to 0 when idling. (I understand this is normal)
     
     I have changed the oil filter recently.  The oil was still pretty

     The new filter did not seem the make any difference.  It seems to me 
     that it wasn't like this before.  Any ideas?
     
    ----- End Included Message -----

My 1971 911E (about 160K miles on the oil pump and main bearings)
behaves quite similarly to the above decription. When the temp gauge
reads about 200 deg (typical for 70 mph at 85 deg ambient) I get
roughly 10 lb of oil pressure for each 10K of rpm on the tach.

Even at ambient temps of over 90 deg, the oil pres. reads above 60 when
the engine is cold.

Remember, the oil flow is related to viscosity so when your engine temp
is high (mine has not gone above 210 despite 98 deg ambient) the oil
viscosity drops (assuming you've got good oil) and the oil flow
increases or at least stays the same. Low pressures don't have to mean
poor lubrication.

I am pretty sure A/C was standard on the Carrera; optional on the SC.
That may explain why the weight difference is so big - it takes something
besides power locks/windows and 200cc to add 200 lbs.

It looks like they used base model weights (i.e., no options), but wasn't
A/C installed on most (US) SCs anyway?

I don't know whether the weights are wet or dry.  I assume they used
the same method for each car type.

I just talked to a local shop that does industrial 'hot dip' galvanizing

escape fast enough during the dipping and that they might break or
explode.  This seemed odd to me.

Also, any hints for removing the rusted-on sheetmetal screws in the

Subject: My 911 has an undocumented feature!!

Pfilers,

I was amazed to discover that My 911 might actually be an Italian made car
after all!!  The reason I believe this is that it has the same self-soldering
wiring feature my Fiat 124 Spider used to display with regularity:

I was driving on the freeway and realized that my turn signal indicators were
not working.  Damn, I hope it's the fuse....  

Later that day I was driving along (hadn't got around to troubleshooting
the problem yet) and I smelled the unmistakable smell of burning 
wiring/insulation.  I looked around the cabin for signs of smoke and tried to
pretend for a minute that perhaps I was smelling *someone else's* burning
car  (this form of auto-denial is more feasable when it comes to smelling
burning clutches and brakes, but I gave it a shot anyway).

Quickly, the smell went away, and I was able to safely pretend that it might
have been my imagination.  The next time I went to make a lane change and
hit the turn signal out of habit, to my surprize, the thing started
working again!!  They've been working fine ever since....

Maybe this is one of those undocumented or little known features like the
ability to activate the side marker lights with the key off as has been
discussed here before!  

Anyway, the 911 definately seems to have improved the feature as my 124 used to 
solder the connections into molten lumps (like my ignition switch in the
middle of a downpour...)

Maybe there's a secret code stamped on the frame somewhere that identifies
this feature.  Anyone know where I can find it ;^)

Ted,

Outperform how??

First of all, if you want to talk about performance you need to
talk about the whole package. This includes power to weight ratio,
gearing, suspension, weight, roll center, center of gravity, track
width, tire width, aerodynamics, and usable power band.

You also need to know what kind of event the car is competing in.

The only type of competition a narrow car with narrow wheels and
tires would excel at, all other performance characteristics being
equal, is straight line speed.

The small increase in aerodynamic drag, roll resistance, and weight
incured when using a SC-style car with wider wheels and tires is
dramatically offset by the performance gains in overall handling.
This is proven on race tracks across America every weekend of the
year.

What about what I have said do you not understand??

Subject: Re: Camber Truss, Etc....

I have a Weltmeister Cambermeister I bought from Paragon products (Panorama).
(Much cheaper than automotion).

I notice a difference in hard fast cornering.  Before the bar, as I approached
the limit, the front end started to feel mushy, almost like my shocks were
bad and the suspension was oscillating a little.  The Cambermeister eliminated
this and keeps the steering feeling consistant.

Given that the problem is keeping the shock tower from moving in its rubber
mount (most of the problem) and secondary, keeping the frame mounting point
from moving inward, I don't see the advantage of the triangulation.

The bars I've seen with triangulation have the cross bar mounted to the frame, and
the triangle bars mounted to the shock towers

The Weltmeister has a bracket that ties the shock tower to the caster/camber
adjust mounting points on the frame, which eliminates the lateral movement in
the rubber mount and then has the cross brace that ties to this bracket to
add additional support to the loaded side of the frame from the unloaded side.

these brackets that mount to the shock tower do not seem to effect the road
surface transmission into the body, since the up and down motion of the shock
tower is not effected, only the lateral movement.

With the brackets installed, but not the cross bar, you can feel the difference
in the front end in hard corners.

The Idea behind the bar is to maintain the same camber and therefore contact patch
as the lateral forces on the front tires increase.  The positive change in camber
and redcution in contact patch, is what makes the front end feel mushy and bouncy
as it starts to understeer.

Its hard to feel the difference on the street, but it is real noticeable on the track.

Carrera.  This is the fan in the trunk of the car, under the carpet.  As
one of the network members suggested, the problem was not the fan motor or
fan housing at all.  The gasket material isolating the fan housing from
the body of the car had deteriorated to the point that it created a loud
vibration.  As suggested, I removed the fan and housing, replaced the
gasket material with a substitute and repaired the problem for less than
$5.00.  I understand that this may be a relatively common problem so
others may encounter it too.  My repair cost was quite different from the
$330 estimate I got from the dealer for replacing the fan.  Of course the
dealer may have also discovered that I did not need a new fan but --.

Right you are, George!  I gritted my teeth and cut the headliner (Snip, snip 
snip! SOB! Arrrrrgh!) under the fork/gear mechanism to gain access to the 5 
screws.  All the teeth on the *PLASTIC* gear were stripped on both sides.  
Beats me why Porsche used plastic here, to save a few ounces?  Drove the car 
with the roof hanging on by the front hooks only to the local dealer in 
pouring rain.  You can do 60 mph without the roof lifting and leaking.  Got 
the gears for the princely sum of $3.36 each from the dealer.  Must be the 
cheapest parts on my car.  

Any ideas on taping up 2 4-inch cuts in the headliner.  This area is covered 
by a vinyl cover so it doesn't have to be perfect.  Is there a tape-like 
material which can be bonded with a hot iron?  Duct tape is *not* an option.

While at the dealer decided to buy Mahle oil filters for $8.95 less 15% PCA 
discount.  Isn't there some mail-order place cheaper than this if you buy 4 or
more?

BTW, thanks to the many responses on releasing the clover-leaf spring for the
brake pads.  "Press in the middle in the plane of rotor rotation using large 
channel-locs" worked like a charm, first time each wheel.  No squeaks yet 
from the Cool Carbons.  I did install the rubberized backing plates, on the

Not that I saw.  The vehicle in line directly in front of me was an old truck.
They reved it up until the entire place was filled with exhaust smoke (it
didn't pass ;-).  I don't think that poor truck had seen that kind of RPM (at
least in a sustained way) in a long time.

This is typical of bureaucratic rulemaking: the vehicle shall be tested
at 3000 RPM. period.  Never mind how much time that vehicle might
actually spend at that RPM when being operated on the street.  One
just can not expect anything sensible from a bureaucratic process.

Subject: Ted vs. World; uhh.. SC vs. Carrera

On the subject of unsprung weight, I am looking at the purchase of an '85 Targa
equipped with RUF 17" wheels. I am told by my mechanic  that these wheels are
much heavier than the original 16" Fuchs and kill the feel of the car. Is this
true? How about the tradeoff between handling feel vs. the actual limits of the
car. And how about chassis flex/strain, due to the stickier, wider , bigger
tires in relation to the weaker targa chassis. Is this a problem?
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with 911's, and unwilling to really push
the car during a test drive.

Soapbox comments:

The way that a car looks; ie. "wider butt" does not necessarily indicate
anything about how slippery it is. When the 928 first came out, it appeared very
aerodynamic compared to the other Porsches. It wasn't.

While stock hp and weight figures may allow valid comparisions between new,
stock cars, I suspect that few of us have anything like that. For instance, my
'86 951 weighed X lbs and had Y hp when it came out of the factory. After 9
years, it has an '88 engine( 30K miles), 7" wheels all around, no-tread 205/225
tires, Autothority 2.7, no cat, Simpson camlock belts, harness bar, Precision
Power amp, SAS Bazooka tube, and girlfriend in the passenger seat. At this point
I would have no idea what the lb/hp ratio is without actually weighing/dynoing
the car. The stock specs can't always factor things like A/C, sunroofs, etc.
which were probably standards in some years and options in other. Ted's car
seems to have been significantly modified. Just with forged Fuchs rims in place
of cast BBS, he probably dropped at least 30lbs. Now when he rips out the
carpets, acid-dips the body, replaces the passenger seat with a lawn chair, and
adds a 3.8 sequential turbo, he'll really drop that lb/hp ratio:) However until
he does the scale/dyno/wind tunnel deal, I don't think anyone will be a
believer. That probably applies to anyone's cars on the list.

BTW, anyone going to Woodstock. Perhaps we can come up with a secure Porsche
camping area.

  I have this book and have found it to be informative.  Since he
claims to have been the driving force behind the RS America, it
seemed like purchasing his book was the least I could do...;-).  


  The book reads like a combination of his personal history and
a driving tutorial.  His discussions on technique included some
hints that I've taken to heart in my quest for improvement in
competitive environments (the braking section was particularly good).
The only problems I have with the book are:

  1. Mixing technique with storytelling sometimes made it difficult
     to extract the "meat" of the instruction.

  2. Annoying advertisements for Powerhaus, the apparent sponsor
     (i.e. Poorly paraphrased here... "If your looking for XXXX, 

     Powerhaus carries this stuff...").  There are 5 or 6 references
     throughout the book...:-(.

  The book can be purchased from most of the parts houses (i.e. Tweeks,
  Automotion, etc.) and Motorboooks Intl.

All-in-all, I've found it to be a generally informative book that's 

worth the money.  For somebody just getting into driving Porsches, this
would be a great book for learning fundamental driving technique in 

a 911.  There are also some very insightful hints for FWD autos as
well that were good.

Subject: Sound the Trumpets! (long)

	Well, it finally happened.  Yesterday we finished
the final paperwork, and I went and picked up the car.
I took the long way to work, and wasn't particulary
productive when I finally showed up.  I have given several
rides, answered lots of questions, and generally been
designated the local Porsche expert.

	I posted a note about 6 weeks ago, when I started
looking in earnest.  I talked about how it had taken 24 years
to get to this point, and how excited I was to finally
get there.

	So, I started searching.  The most important thing
I learned, and the biggest tip I can pass on, is to find
a good mechanic, have him inspect the cars you are serious
about, and LISTEN to what the mechanic has to say.

	I dodged a couple of bullets.  One was a '76 911S
Targa, owned by a friend known to be meticulous about his
Porsches.  Close, but no cigar.  It had a 2.7l engine with
a loud valve train, a very leaky top, and some suspect
body work.

	The other was a beautiful '78 SC coupe.  I was
sure this was THE car, right up to the point where my
mechanic showed me all the seams from the welding done
to beat the chassis back into some semblence of shape
after somebody hit it REAL hard.  Oh, well.  Next...

	So, one fine Saturday, I went on my weekly cruise,
just 'a lookin.  I found a pretty nice '82 SC Targa, the
price was right, it drove ok (not counting the rear end
problem, which would have been fixed as a part of the
agreed upon price), and I gave them $500 down, subject of
course to passing the pre-purchase inspection.

	I drove home, and my kids wanted to see the car.
So, Carla and I bundled both them into the station wagon,
and off we went.  We checked it, the kids were impressed,
and my wife, wellllllll, maybe not.  On the way back, she
mentioned that she really liked "the green one".  The green
one was an '86 Euro Carrera Targa, resplendent in ice green.
I like that color.  I liked the car.  I didn't like the
purchase price.

	We stopped and got some Cokes for the kids.  I
_really_ liked the green one, Carla sez (again).  How much
did you like it, I asked.  To my utter amazement, her
answer was: Let's go back and look at it.  Well, cool.
Back we went, and while it was nice, we didn't have no
stinking $25,000.  What about that gold one then, Carla
said.

	Wellll, what about it.  '84 Carrera Targa, 83K
miles, exterior 7.5, interior 9.5, after-market whale tail,
some sort of metallic gold.  More than our budget, but what
the hell.  It drove well, if you didn't count the gearbox
syncros.  Carla sez, well, go buy it.   But, but, but... OK.

	So I did.  It's more than I wanted to spend, and
I'm still arguing with the dealer about the gearbox, but
it's mine.  All mine.  And last night, I went and looked
in the garage, just to make sure there really is a Porsche
that gets parked in there.

Subject: More on Visiting the Porsche Factory


A couple of years ago we were in Stuttgart, called the factory to order some 
356 parts that we had a hard time obtaining in the states, then went out to 
the factory in Zuffenhausen to pick up the parts.   
 
Although we were unable to participate in an official factory tour because we 
did not have an appointment, we had a terrific time visiting the museum, 
talking to the curator and wandering about the adjacent courtyard directly 
across from the factory proper. 
 
When we went over to the original brick Werks1 buuilding to pick up our parts, 
we had to step aside at the gate as a mechanic blew past in a brand new 959  
. . . obviously on the way out for a shakedown drive. 
 
The parts department was another experience, where the guys in charge spent 
quite some time talking to us and encouraged us to contact them directly from 
the states if we needed any more hard to find parts.  In fact, they went so 
far as to order a part that was not on our list because they guessed 
(correctly) that one of the part numbers I had supplied to them over the phone 
was incorrect! 
 
When we went back a couple of days later to pick up the special order part, we 
were treated like old friends . . . waved through the gate with a smile by the 
security guard, and free to wander about the building adjacent to the museum. 
 
In other words, just because you can't take the tour doesn't mean the trip 
isn't worth taking!  We had an unforgettable experience.

     small Porsche factory operation really is!

Sounds like a Bad Plan to me..... A long time ago, when I was mainly 
doing VW stuff, we used to take the heat exchangers out to be
flame sprayed with aluminium -- "aluminizing" the process was called.
That worked OK -- the piece was heated, sandblasted, cleaned, re-heated
and then sprayed with a mist of Al+?? that bonded to the clean slightly
rough surfaces. Sort of like powder coating, but with metal.

Anyway, it worked great for making the pieces look good and sure kept
things from rusting. For places to do it, I'd say look in the Yellow
Pages under "Metallizing"...

Diamond Shamrock makes this *REALLY* super killer penetrating oil
called (no shit) "S'OK". I have *NO* idea where to get it on a steady
basis, but find it from time to time at various parts stores. A can
will last roughly 10 years unless you have a shop...

As to replacements, those are standard Wurth cheese-head screws, you
can get them either nickle-plated, Cad II plated, chrome plated, or
"straight"... Probably get the hex heads from them too, but then your
car will look weird... sure hurts your resale value if you ever sell
it to someone that knows much.

Subject: Speedo fix, electrical, other


I finally had my bout with the nonfunctioning odometer last night.  I read up on
speedo repair in an article from Dave Darling, but the 85/1 944 speedo is
somewhat different from the one he described (914 I think).  (Dave, your article
did give me the confidence that I could  pry off that *&^% metal band that 
holds the bezel in.)

I checked what many had mentioned as the "likely suspect" for a nonfunctional
odometer (the plastic gear that drives the top set of numbers), but it seemed
OK.  Later, I noticed that the shaft holding the gears that take the input off
the input shaft and transfer it to the reduction gears had quite a lot of play
in it.  So much in fact, that it could get pushed away from the gear on the
input shaft.  I solved the problem by jamming a piece of metal in between
the plastic part which houses the reduction gearing and the metal casing of the
speedo.  This effectively keeps that shaft pushed into its journal.  The only
thing I can figure is that the plastic wore over time and allowed the shaft to
travel in and out of its journal.

While messing in the dash I found something interesting; a disconnected relay
(part # 944.615.915.01) attached to the sheet metal under the top of the
dash immediately left of the plastic "air box".  I looked it up in all the
catalogs I have and couldn't find anything that matches.  Anyone familiar
with the intended purpose of this relay??

Now to the suspension.  What are some likely causes of SEVERE steering
wheel feedback and front end "looseness" when hitting bumps while turning?
Every suspension component is suspect because I think it is all original (and
this after 135,000+ miles).  Where might be the first place to start?  (I have
checked and repacked the front wheel bearings and THINK I have them adjusted
correctly.)

Thanks for your help,

Dustin, this is *NOT* meant as a personal attack. It's a general comment
meant to inform, and re-inforce some ground rules about this list.

I usually let such random flamage go past without comment, hitting "d" as
fast as I can. This one, however, merits comment:

> What were you thinking? The whole point of having a buried, hidden VIN that
> few people know about is so that car thieves won't know to change it during

Yo, dude -- grab a *STRONG* cup of coffee, and join the rest of us out
here  in the real world.

1) amature theives aren't worth worrying about -- they'll either be
   defeated by any J-random alarm or if they get the car, they are most
   likely doing something relative innocuous -- joyriding or looking for
   specific parts like Targa tops, wheels, radios, seats, etc. Sort of
   like drive-by shootings -- they happen, or not, and while you can do
   things to reduce the chance you'll be hit, it's impossible to completely
   avoid.

2) skilled thieves will steal specific cars to fill "parts orders"
   and toss the rest. They usually use tow trucks, BTW.

3) the real professionals probably know more about these cars than *I* do. 
   ALREADY. Without reading the list (OK, 'fess up -- how many of you
   are really world-class car thieves????)

911s have numbers in a very small number of places, and they're all
documented in the factory manuals. If you are a thief, and paranoid, it's
*SIMPLE* enough to take some care as you strip a car and *LEARN* where
the "secret" numbers are -- I mean, we're not talking implanted microchips
that only identify themselves in the presence of a secret radio frequency.
We're talking 10mm high stamped numbers in the sheet metal. Gotta be pretty
stupid to miss that when the car is stripped down to the seeds and stems.

> IMHO, the Maestro was not trying be stuck-up 

No, he wasn't. Harry was just being "cute". It's one of his trademarks,
and while it endears him to some people, it really pisses others off.
Pete Albrecht (check out his background sometime for grins) is pretty much
no-nonsense and likes his facts hard and straight. Harry like anecdotes.
Makes for an explosive interaction from time to time. When it gets out of
hand, they meet to settle it by throwing pre-A con rods at each other
from 20 paces or some such...

Bottom line: *CHILL OUT*!!! More paranoia and fearmongering is the last
thing this list needs. The only time I won't answer a direct question on
anything I know, think I know, have read, have heard, or dreamed about
these cars is where it directly intersects something I *MAKE MONEY* on.
You want my CIS mods, fine -- bring your car to Ghost Racing. You want me
to tell all on the net, right -- blow me! Ditto for any other intellectual 
property.  Everything else is public domain knowledge. The list is hear to

Also listed is:	   "TL152.5.E39"  and "629.283-dc20"
I assume these are library reference numbers  (Dewey Decimal? & LOC?)

    It's _always_ going to be a 'hand wave' UNTIL you quantify your

    If trunk space is worth 90%, all 911s *lose* to a Ford Taurus.  Ha!
    Not-original-stock 3.0 motors muddy the waters even further.



REAL QUESTION:

What's the general concencious as to how long a P-car (911) should be
able to safely sit without having to take special storage precautions
such as gas stablizer, jack stands, etc?

So far, I've had (what seems to be) good luck with simply driving it
once or twice every 5 weeks or so (when it clears).  Should I change?

While I agree with your conlusion, Scott, that the only place a skiny
car with skinny wheels will win is in a straight line, I think you're
opening up to all sorts of nitpicking on each of the subjects you
mention.  I agree that all of these items are in the performance
equation, but for me the SOLE measure of performance in a given
event is time around the course with equal level drivers.  Period.
Therefore, as mentioned before, the only way to measure Ted's
supercar against these rather anemic 85 on Carerras is to race.

Last night, while tapping out the wrist pins on my 911 SC engine, one
of my wooden blocks that was supporting the con rod slipped without
me noticing.  The upshot is I tapped out the wrist pin (not particularly
hard, but certainly not loose) without supporting the back side of
the rod.  This of course resulted in some side load on the con rod.
Anybody out there have an opinion (whew thats asking for it!) about
whether this amt of side load could have caused any problems ?

Jerry,

I have had the occasional starting puff and recently someone mentioned that this
on a Turbo was signs of an impending turbo rebuild (hello bank manager). Talking
to my mechanics its no problem, ALL 911s puff a little - some more than others. 
The apparent cause is that on a flat six the valve guides can be immersed in
oil permently when parked - oil seals are not designed for this and oil
can seap into the cylinder - puff on starting. Happens alot if the car is
parked on an incline of some sort and if its been left for some time - days
rather than hours. Anyway its probably not a problem, my mechanic has
rebuilt his car times many - he is a serious racer - and has always had the
"problem" and there are probabaly no old parts left in his machine.

Anybody else see the article in the B section of Tuesdays (I think)

in sales of high line sports cars, they focused on Japanese imports
but said dmoestic sales were badly dinged too.  As an aside they
mentioned that Porsche 911's are selling like hot cakes this year and
that they are way ahead of previous years.  Not mentioned in the
article, but I believe the Caterham cars (mentioned on this group
recently) are also selling like crazy despite their greatly increased
price over the last rew years.  Perhaps the world (or US at least)
has decided that real sports cars are better than speedbumps.

of damage to expensive parts. Ya gotta have Porsche's tow eye! This part has a

Subject: Ring, Cylinder, Piston Materials

Cylinders, traditionally are cast iron, not steel.  Cast iron is a wonderful
bearing material with the hardness and grain structure that allows good
oil retention.  It is also one of the few bearing materials that can
run on itself.

Rings used to be cast iron, but long have been chrome plated (run a hard
material on a soft one is traditional for bearings).  Porsche used a
variety of cylinder materials, even with the early 356's.  When the
cylinders were other than cast iron, I presume that the rings were cast
iron (not steel).

Chrome has been used as a cylinder surface material.  One of its advantages
in re-build is that you can hone out a cylinder and then chrome it back
to stock.  You also can chrome plate aluminum and get a suitable high
performance cylinder wall.  I had that on my racing two-stroke bike
25 years ago.  Aluminum is much too gummy itself for cylinder walls.

GM pioneered  aluminum alloy cylinder walls in the 60's with the Vega
engine.  This had high silicon aluminum which could be precision cast
and required minimum boring.  By chemically etching the aluminum back,
a silicon running surface with good oil grooves was produced.  It was
neat, but had one drawback .. in normal use acid in the oil etched the
cylinders and the block life was about 60 k miles.  GM reacted to this
by changing the engine name to 'Durabuilt' and giving a 50,000 mile
warranty.  Others have done better since.  Us electronics types
knew the cylinder surface was really p-type silicon and not aluminum.

Aluminum barrels usually have cast in or pressed in cast iron liners,
getting the good heat conduction of aluminum with the wear properties
of cast iron.  The 356's classic alfin brake drums are a good example
of this kind of thinking in brakes rather than cylinders.

I'm less informed about the newer chrome/ceramic materials, but they
sound really interesting.  Maybe if I ever get back into flying ...

Oh, now I am confused.  If the switch is the thing on the radiator and controls
whether the low speed fan comes on (regardless of whether the car is running or
not), then what controls the high speed fan, which only comes on if the ignition
is in the "run" position?  Is this what the thermostat is for?  Where is the
thermostat located and what is involved (time and parts cost) in

Subject: 911 Case Squirters

Hi -

Recent questions on oil pressure prompt me to ask about the case
squirters (um, "piston spritzers"): somewhere, in Paul Frere's book I
think, is a comment to the effect that "the case squirters were fed with
waste oil from the oil pressure relief valve", at least when the  
squirters were introduced.  My question for those of you who have held a
bare case in your hands (luckily not me yet!): is this true, and is it
still true for the 78-89 aluminum cases?  

If that IS how they work, it would seem to imply no cooling to the
pistons unless oil pressure is up the the relief blowoff point, and
might make me think differently about climbing long hills in top gear on
hot days with a headwind (suprisingly common in CA).  Maybe the piston
cooling is only needed at high rpms anyway?

Subject: 911 high RPM -> dies

Hi

My '83 SC often dies when I accelerate to higher (> 5000) RPM, in any
gear. It's not the rev limiter. It seems to lose spark completely (like
someone turned the key off) all of a sudden -- VERY disconcerting -- and
I'm left with an engine that's turning 5000 RPM or so, but not running.
So I push in the clutch, the engine stops, I let out the clutch, and
it STILL won't run.
So I push in the clutch, turn the key OFF, turn the key ON, and let
out the clutch (in a higher gear) and it runs fine!

Is something in the ignition being tripped so that the ignition needs
to be "reset" by turning the key off and on?

It was suggested that my capacitor-discharge unit may be faulty, but
it makes the high-pitched whine that I'm told is characteristic of these 
things (at least it does with the key on but engine not running). Is
this getting "reset" when I turn the key?

Help!! Life is boring at less than 5000 rpm :-).

Subject: Fluid Specs for 944

I posted this last week but haven't received any responses.  *Someone* must know
the answers to at least some of these questions.  I thought they were pretty
basic.  Please?  Pretty please?  Anyhow, here are my questions:

1) I have a 1983 944.  My power steering fluid is a little low.  According to my
owners manual, I need to use ATF Dexron.  According to Haynes, I need to use
Dexron II ATF.  When I when to the automotive store, all I could find was
Dextron III (that's Dextron with a "t" in it).  What are the differences among
these three?  Can I use the Dextron III to top up my power steering fluid?

2) The second question is similar.  It is in connection with my transmission
fluid.  My owners manual recommends ATF Dexron.  (I have an automatic.  Don't
ask...)  However Haynes recommends SAE 90W gear oil.  What should I use?

3) As you are all probably aware from Thom's great posting about my mechanical
woes in Sacramento, we replaced the radiator in my car.  I have yet to post my
version of the story (which isn't much different) but after my unexpectedly
extended vacation my life here has been nust and I haven't had time to write it
up yet.  Anyhow, when we took the radiator off, we lost some transmission fluid.
(Because I have an automatic, the radiator is also a tranmission fluid cooler.)
Afterward, we checked the fluid level to see if it needed topping up.  It looked
okay, but I'm worried that I'm checking the wrong thing.  I *think* I'm supposed
to check the fluid level at the rear of the car near the differential.  Is this
right, or is this some *other* trasmission reservoir that holds different fluid
from that which we lost from the radiator? If itisn't the right one, where/how
should I check?

Thanks in advance.

  Greetings,
  This is mostly for Robert Merithew, but may also be of value to 
other 14'ers.
  Weigh the cost of dipping your mild steel exchangers against
the cost of real stainless steel, include the doubt of a permanent
fix.  Then consider this:
  I've used Stainless Steel heat exchangers on my '73 powerplant
for over 15 years.  These are *well* worth the cost of $175 each.
  The stainless does stain, but wont corrode, and so the cheesehead
(slot) screws will not rust in place.  There is a caveat here about
them screws:  either use anti-seize or replace with new OEM screws
because they are nicely gold(pozi drive) or green(slot) zinc plated.

  In removing recalcitrant screws:  try one of those cheepy impact
type screw breakers..the kind you whack with a hammer. My set came
with exaggerated size driver tips..ideal for cheeseheads like us.
 Problem with this tact:  You can snap off the head or you may bend
metal where it is flimsy or rust thinned.  Then it needed to be out
anyway right?

  Things I like about these stainless exhaust systems:
 -they last forever.
 -they have a nice ticking sound on cooldown as you walk away 
  from your red-hot chariot after a flogging.
 -they clean up good.
 -they come apart like they should. (use stainless bolts at muffler)
 -they give your machine a ballsy appearance. (as opposed to rusty)

    To everyone who has the hose diagram so far:
I finally checked in the April 1993 issue of _Pano_, which contains
a diagram of the layout of the vacc hoses in a 73 2.0L.  No sizes,
but it does give a good drawing and tells you what colors they should
be...  My car disagrees with it in two particulars:
    The distributor advance and retard lines seem to be swapped.  I
don't know if mine is correct (I'll check this weekend, hopefully)
or what--my vaccuum unit is in a different position than the one in
the picture, as well.
    The lines coming out of the rear fitting and the side fitting of
the decel valve are swapped as well.  Again, not certain that my car
is correct--also not certain it makes much difference.  I'll try
swapping mine this weekend and seeing what happens.
    Also, the #1 fitting on the Manifold should be on the RF corner
of the manifold, not the LF--but it's still to the left of the #2.
(Updated version available, but it's a rinky-dink change...)
    Sorry for any confusion.

This above sentence is full bullshit.  There are many scenarios where 
narrow tires will outperform wider tires on windy courses or banked race 
tracks.  I thought you had a friend or cousin who raced?  Run that

I wouldn't use thread locker on everything, and certainly not on
a locknut.  There's nothing wrong with it, it's just unnecessary.
If you read Carroll Smith's books, he'll tell you that, ideally,
neithe thread locker nor lock nuts should be necessary.  But since
we live in a non-ideal world and don't/can't alway torque precisely.

I also wouldn't use anti-seize everywhere.

Kind of hard to come up with a complete catalog of where to use
either product.  Of the top of my head, use red (strong) thread
locker on conn rod bolts, fly wheel bolts, 911 CV bolts (4 rather
than 6), and the little screws in the corners of my eyeglasses.
Use anti-seize on fasteners which pissed you off last time you
had to get them apart (my theory, at least).

that). Since then my mechanic has informed me the turbo is pretty tired 
and talked about rebuilding it. On a different note I called Windward 
about their Sachs Sport Clutch package and talked to a tech for awhile 
about my engine. He suggested the SC Cams for the turbo, and a K-27 turbo 
instead of rebuilding mine. Also replacing the muffler. He also stated 
that for street use I didn't need a larger intercooler, though it would 
add power and I didn't need  an enrichment nozzle. Since he told me I didn't 
need to spend acouple of extra thousands, I listened. The SC Cams go for 
$400 and the K-27 for $1000, vs $600 or so to rebuild it. I was going to 
hold off on the muffler for awhile (no money). Also has anyone tried 
these lightened sport clutch packages. For the turbo they are about 13 
lbs. lighter than stock.

Triet,

Your mechanic is absolutely correct.  Case study #3076:  I helped
develop a street 3.4 litre 911 for a customer, very sporty motor.  My
involvement was mostly limited to setting up the ECU and dyno work.
Unfortunately, he also bought a set of those 17" Ruf wheels.  They
absolutely took the "snap" out of the motor.  We swapped on 16" Fuchs,
and what a difference.  Yes indeed, nitpickers, the above description
is entirely subjective.  But you can get the objective truth by
weighing the Ruf rims (they are indeed about twice the weight), then
go figure the effect that weight is going to have when, in addtion,
it is located radially farther out.  And we did measure times.  Customer
saw the light.

There is a really interesting description of power losses due to
*internal* accelerations in Colin Campbell's book: The Sports Car.  The
whole book is an interesting read, if somewhat idiosyncratic.  These
losses include those which go into spinning the drive shaft, transmission,
wheels, etc.

Amen.  Spend ZERO money on horsepower until you've been thru several drivers
schools, then start spending your money on the suspension.  I raced SCCA for
5 years, THEN I learned to drive at Porsche and BMW club schools!  The BEST
car I've seen to learn to drive really quick with is a 914-4.  You MUST keep
your momentum up thru the turns, and you can carry that knowledge with you to
faster cars.  Horsepower covers a bunch of sins, but a better driver in an
underpowered car is faster than anybody in an overpowered car that doesn't
know how to drive.  Just watch Brian Redman sometime in a 2000cc sportsracer
eat up CanAm cars in vintage races.  

And since I mentioned suspension; on a Porsche, spend your money in the
following order:

1.   4 wheel Alignment with 4 corner weight balance to within 15 lbs side to
side. The weight balance is IMPERATIVE for a Porsche to handle properly. The
driver or the equivalent weight should be in the driver's seat. Proper weight
balance and alignment can take a 911/930 from an evil handling monster to a
pussycat.

2.  Tires.  For the track or autocross, BFG COMP TA R1's or Yoko A-008rs's or
the equivalent.

3.  Koni's or Bilsteins shocks or for those on a budget, KYB's on a 914.

4.  Anti-roll bars.  Bigger than stock, and thru the body for late model
911's fronts.

5. Stiffer springs/torsion bars.

6.  Stiffer bushings (especially for older cars.)  The rears on a 71 911T I
used to own, had deformed 3/8"! Weltmeister STREET hardness bushings are
significantly harder than stock, yet not rock hard racing bushings.

>I'd like to here your thoughts on using ABS in track events.

Our factory 944T that was built of the Escort Series in 87 has ABS, with a
switch (also factory installed) that can turn it off.  It also has a pressure
sensor that if you jam on the brakes for "both feet in" in a spin that turns
off the abs and will allow locking up the brakes.  We leave the switch on for
any track event.  The only time it gets confused is if the car gets really
light when coming over a rise, then you put the brakes on hard.  The pedal
goes down, but eventually you stop in plenty of time.  Later versions of
Bosch abs alledgedly help this annoyance.  Some race drivers like ABS, some
don't, hence the on/off switch.

Hope this helps.

Hi, Triet.
 
I am willing to bet that if you were blindfolded, led to a car with the RUF
wheels and allowed to drive it (take blindfold off first!), and then
blindfolded again and led to an otherwise identical car with factory wheels
and did the same (blindfold removal included), you would not be able to tell
any difference made by the wheels.
 
The factory is now using 17 inch wheels as an option. A 17 inch wheel is
going to weigh more than a 16 anyway, all other things being equal.
 
Chassis flex -- 911s are strong. Some people run them in slaloms 10 times a
year, and/or track events, and the chassis does not go limp. So don't worry
about it (unless, as in this case, it's a cab or targa; flex is included
in the option price).
 
Bottom line: buy what you like. Mechanics don't necessarily have more
general knowledge or common sense than you do -- just more specific
knowledge. They're not engineers.

Kevin - I understand what you're saying and have no doubt you are correct.
My ignorant question is: could there be some advantage in the heavier
wheels while cruising at high speeds? In terms of straight line stability?

I have a 964, 500 lbs heavier than the '85, with the Ruf 17" wheels and
have been very pleased with them. Primarily the car is used for road trips
in the western states, often at efficient velocities. No doubt if I was
autocrossing it would be well worthwhile to switch wheels, but given my
situation would you consider it?

Imho the most significant performance improvement I could make in my car
would be for the driver to lose 40 lbs!

Many thanks

Steve,

Most of the time when an Alpine alarm goes off after arming it means there
is a sensor tripped. Most likely it's your door circuit.How long have you 
had your alarm? What model is it ? Depending on the unit there  are some
dipswitches inside the main module that need to be set at installation.
I install alarms and stereo systems for a living and I would be glad to 
help you solve your problem. You can mail me directly if you like.

Dunno.  I suppose that they probably have more angular momentum (is
that the right term?) and therefore it takes more energy to change
the axis of rotation.  Nothing else comes to mind.  Could be.  However,
if with those 17" rims you upgrade to wider tires, I'm pretty sure
that you would experience less directional stability, since wider
tires as a rule tend to "tramline" (I think the word is) more, that is,
pull from side to side.

I would like to know from anyone knowledgeable what utility there is in
having a detector that allegedly detects aser beams.  Seems to me that it
would be improbable that a small beam of light the diameter of a pencil
eraser would ever be detected by a box on the dash or visor.  These things
seem to have a "mirror" on the recieving surface. Is this to catch the
laser beam? How can these things possibly work?  The whole point of a
laser is that the beam is too small to be detected.

(999.182.001.36K)

How about a comparison between their 3 lug nut sockets with plastic liners:

TL-3300 vs TL-3350 vs TL-3380?  (I don't need C2 or dial wheel support)

Also, I have noticed that between my red Porsche reflector in the rear, 
and the bumper, there is maybe a .25" or 3/8" gap where I can see 
underneath the wide red reflector, is this normal for a '77?

Will the Automotion HL-80476 H4 headlights bolt right in place of my US 
'77 911S coupe headlights, and can I then put in 80/100 watt bulbs? for 
an addl. $14 each?  Does the 80 watt over 55 watt cause a lot of concern

The anchoring of my large battery is looking complex so I'm looking for a

I put them in the trailing arms only.  They didn't make a bushing for the
banana arms at that time.  I used the street bushings in both a 930 and a '71

Hello everyone!

Well, I'm psyched... I ran across what I considered to be a great deal
on a 1980 911sc Targa. 47K original miles (docs), garage kept,
excellent condition for $12.5K. I purchased it 2.5 hours after I first
saw it... There was one catch... someone had stolen the Targa top out
of the owners garage while he was out driving one day. Which leaves
me with a rather urgent need for a replacement top. Do any of my fellow
porschephiles have, or know someone who has, a targa top they would
like to sell? If so, please contact me via email...

Thanks,

Ps. I am sure I'll be asking lots of 911 neophyte questions to the group so
please bear with me... I'm looking forward to learning as much as possible
about my new baby, meanwhile I'll be surfing the archives...

Hi, Kevin, and Ken.
 
The 17 inch wheels and their associated tires are also larger in diameter,
which effectively gives taller gearing. That alone will be responsible for
some of the perceived loss of "snap," regardless of weight.
 
In any case, be sure not to install Ted M's pound-apiece lugnuts, even if
they are located close to the wheel axis.

Subject: Re: Fluid Specs for 944

Hubert,

I have to say that I've never laid my hands on a 944 automatic.  But I
can quote from the workshop manual with the best of them.

1. Dexron II vs. III.  I haven't a clue, and I cannot find anything
from Porsche which says one way or the other.  I would ask your local
dealer, or call Reno, or call one of the oil companies.  Dollars to
donuts it is simply an improvement in the standards, as when engine
oil gets (up)graded SF, SG, etc.  But I don't know.

2. You got two different things to lubricate.  The automatic trans-
mission itself holds about 6.5 of ATF, which should be Dexron spec
according to the manual.  Then there's the final drive, including
the differential, which in your case holds about 1 litre of hypoid
oil which should be graded SAE 90 and/or GL 5.

3. ATF level is measured at a plastic filler reservoir/tube mounted
next to the sump, under the car.  It has min and max marks.  Final
drive fluid level is measured by removing the top allen-head filler
plug in the rear case, and it should come up to the lower edge of
the filler opening.  (Which is different than on the manual cars,
for which the fluid should nominally be 6 to 8 mm. beneath the
edge of the filler opening.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Literature for future Porschephile

Hi, Jerry.
 
Books for your 2.5 year old to read -- uh, how about the official
factory manual? Kids seem to automatically memorize things. See, this way,
when you're under the car, you just have to activate your own bionic shop
manual. "Junior, what's the tightening torque on thishere bolt?" And Junior
comes up with the number. Keeps you from getting greasy fingerprints on the
manual.
 
The thought of a 2.5 year old falling to sleep with the immortal words of
Bruce Anderson ringing in his ears is scary. No, actually, it could be
worse. He could be falling asleep to that Power Rangers crap.
 
Bruce, are you reading this? Here's an idea for a new sideline. You can have
kids make pilgrimages to your house. You dress up in a red suit (suspenders
AND belt, of course), put them on your knee, and say, "Now what would you
like on Ferry Porsche's Birthday?" And they say things like
"I wanna shortshifter, a set of Ruf 9 and 10 x 17s, an Autothority chip, and
some magnetic numbers to put onda doors." You magically provide the
hardware, and bill the parents' VISA or Amex account.
 
As for books, how about something long on pictures and short(er) on words?
There are a lot of ripoff Porsche books available at places like Crown
books, quickie knockoffs printed in the Far East and written by hacks who
don't know Porsches from pumpkins, but going through my bookshelf I did find
one quality book with lots of photos -- Julius Weitmann's "Porsche Story."
It's almost all b/w photos but they're some of the greatest Porsche photos
ever made. I think it's now finally in print again. You, at least, should
have it and see if your son likes it; if not you still have a great book.
 
This is great; that's how it starts. When he's old enough to comprehend
these things, take him to museums, planetariums, car shows, races,
do airplane stuff too, buy him a good telescope and maybe some tools of his
own, maybe find a local park with a woodworking shop if the schools there
don't teach it. Buy him some simple car kits and help him put one together,
then turn him loose. Maybe set up a slot car track. They're in/out of
fashion on occasion. A trip to the hobby shop would probably be just the
greatest thing right now. Make a trip to the Smithsonian when
he's older. Things like thise are how I got started and that's how people
get a lifelong interest in science and technology.

According to Valentine,  while the laser beam does not reflect

the laser, you've been zapped and therefore nabbed.  Even Valentine's

Subject: 911 perf.



I would like to try and gather some information from the list on performance of
various years of 911s. What i would like to try and do is gather some speed in
gear data from various list members. What i would suggest is acceleration times
in 2nd and 3rd gear. 2nd gear would be time for 30 to 60 mph and 3rd gear would
be from 60 to 90 mph. ( i think these speeds can be covered by most 911s
without shifting)

Test procedure:
***perform acceleration timing on flat road***

first test speedometer error by finding time to cover 5 miles at 60mph(use
mile markers on highway)and calculate speedometer error.

for 2nd gear: with car in 2nd gear start accelerating at 25 mph when you reach
30mph start timing stop timing at 60mph. repeat 5 times and find average time
for acceleration.(use a stopwatch and round to tenths for times)

repeat for 3rd gear timing from 60 to 90mph.(recomend performing only on closed
race course)

List information on your car. Year, engine size and any modifications to engine
#of people in car etc.

send information to me at  (poneleit@student.msu.edu) with the subject title
(times) and i will compile the times and information and post to the list.

I hope that by looking at times for different cars with different modifications
it might be possible to tell if your car is running poorly and what
modificatons have the biggest gains.

We have as our theme '30 years of 911". The local dealer will provide 
banners, logos etc.
     We will have 1971,1980,and 1993 cars on our 6x10m allocated 
space. Power for lighting is available to a max of 1kw.
The cars are in concours condition.

     Is it an advantage to raise the cars on a platform? How about 
raising the rear of the cars slightly on ramps?
How about reversing one car to show off engine detail?

     Any ideas on how we can enhance this display?
We have drawn the straw opposite Ferrari and Jaguar so we will want 
to put on a good show.
Thanks

Subject: 911 engine insulation


I just spent six hours yesterday replacing the engine sound insulation on
my 1985 911 Carrera. My car has 125,000 miles on it, and the original
insulation (what was left of it) was in pretty poor shape. The following is
my account of the steps needed to replace the insulation. I'm no expert, and
there may be better ways to accomplish same, but here's how I did it.

Besides the usual complement of basic tools, you'll need a replacement
insulation pad and some adhesive. I considered the OEM pad, but decided to
be adventurous instead and use something different. (If you want to go the
OEM route, Imparts seems to have the best price -- around $50.) I bought a 
4'x6' "Heat Shield Insulation" pad from J.C. Whitney for $24.95. It's faced
with 2 layers of aluminum on one side and 3/8" thick "fiber tech" padding
on the other. Golly, now I have the "same technology developed by NASA to
protect its spacecraft". Didn't know they bought from JCW too :-).

Yeah yeah, the aluminum faces out, so it doesn't look the same as OEM when
installed. But, maybe it won't disintegrate too. By the way, the pad is
reinforced internally with a nylon mesh -- looks quite durable. You'll need
about 2' x 4' for one pad.

Now get some adhesive. I used 3M Super Trim Adhesive. You'll need 2 - 6oz. 
cans. I think it comes in a larger can too. 3M also makes "General Trim
Adhesive". The Super Trim is stronger and recommended for heavy pads and
headliners. While you're at the store, get a can of choke cleaner too.

OK. Time for disassembly. It's sort of subjective how much stuff you want
to remove. I balanced the effort required with the added ease of access.
You may choose to remove more, or less. Of course for utmost access, just
remove the whole darn engine :-).

1. Remove air filter and cover.

2. Remove air flow sensor and pressure damper (the thing your air filter fits
in) as one unit. You'll need to remove two bolts on the pressure damper 
box, one nut under the air flow sensor, and pull a hose on the back of
the box. Also remove two phillips screws at rear of box -- they secure a
clip that holds some hoses. Loosen large hose clamp on rubber boot connector
where the air flow sensor attaches.  Pivot sensor and box out of compartment.
Grab your can of choke cleaner and clean out the gunk inside your air sensor.
The little flap inside works better when it is clean. Wear safety glasses--
that stuff really burns when it gets in your eyes. Guess how I know? :-(.

3. Get some plastic wrap. Put it on the open rubber connector where your
sensor was attached. Replace the hose clamp to keep it secure.

4. OK. Now let's make some room on the other side of the engine. H'mm that
blower motor will have to go. Remove the plastic duct that goes from the
blower down to a duct next to the distributor - two bolts and one hose clamp.

5. Remove the blower motor. It's held by three bolts. Disconnect plastic
wire connector. Set aside. Use more plastic wrap to cover the open hole where
the blower was attached.

6. Remove cruise control servo. Pull two vacuum hoses, one wire plug, and two
bolts. Leave the cable attached, and pivot the unit out of the way. Mine
fit in the well just in front of the engine fan.

7. Whew, now time to remove the old insulation (if any). If you're crafting
your own pad, you'll want to save as much as possible as a template. I only
had about 20% of my pad left. I ended up taking measurements and transferring
them to the new pad for cutting. Performance Products has a picture of a 
pad in their catalog - that helped me a bit.

8. You'll want to clean the metal well to have good adhesion. My car had a lot 
of the old adhesive still in place. I sprayed some solvent on it to soften
it and then a putty knife, wire brush, scotchpad pad to remove most of it.
Followed up with some Simple Green and then plenty of water. 

9. Dry well. Use a towel and fan or lots of sun.

10. One last thing to remove -- hood shocks. Just detach them at the firewall.
Prop hood open securely. You don't want it slipping -- it's pretty heavy, 
and your head is like a magnet.

11. Test fit your new pad. Now is the time to curse for not buying an OEM pad,
or at least not using an OEM pad as a template :-). Actually, mine worked
out OK, but it took a lot of time to measure and cut. You may find it useful 
to draw a vertical centerline on your pad and another one on your firewall. 
Makes alignment easier.

12. Spray adhesive onto metal in engine compartment. Try for a nice even coat.
Get all the corners where the pad will want to fall down. Spray adhesive
on pad.

13. Now, the trick is to get the pad in place without touching anything until
it is aligned right. You CAN pull the pad and realign, but try to keep this
to a minimum. I used wax paper on the firewall, removing it as I got the
pad in place. Start on one side and work across, smoothing as you go.

That's it. Assembly is the reverse of disassembly :-).

One last tip on an unrelated topic. I saw a recommendation a few months
ago on the list for 3M Scotchgard Protective gel. I agree. It's great for
rubber spoilers and trim. Lasts MUCH longer than Megiurs (SP?) rubber 
treatment. You'd think it's German, as it costs $6.50 for 3.5 oz at NAPA.
But it's worth it, and goes a long way.

Well I'm done. I'm no longer just a lurker on the list! Hope this 
information is useful.
