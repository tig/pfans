January 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

It's been a busy month. It's gonna be a busier month. Oh, joy!

One project for January will be an OS upgrade and hardware upgrade at
the same time on TTA.COM. Expect an outage sometime in the first part
of the month. 

The main project is getting the ITA 914 back together and ready for 
annual tech. We're just about done there, having just done all new
bearings, bushings, and brake parts. Yow. It never lets. The next
car project is the engine rebuild on the 356. Just getting started on
that, I'll keep you all posted.

Well, on 22 different occasions last month someone accessed the Porschephiles
archives via FTP.  Archives are available, compressed, for the last half of
1992. The rest of the year and all previous years are being added on an 
as-I-get-time basis. Which frankly, is taking forever...

I still edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region of the PCA, and
still plan to put some of the articles on-line for FTP in 
/pub/pca/newsletters/lone-star. If you edit a newsletter or would like to just i
type in articles from your newsletter, you can upload them into the directory
/pub/pca/newsletters/UPLOAD.

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
This info is also on-line in /pub/pca/info, in case you forget to save
this message!

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes) at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Porsches owned/driven are listed, other cars are not. This may change
if enough people bitch about it.  And, if you have any corrections, tell me!

	Howdy all,

	I just went and looked at a 914 this weekend and the guy
didn't know what year and/or engine the car had. I could cross
reference the chassis number with some books that I have, but I
couldn't find the engine number anywhere. Where is it? Is there any
other way to differentiate the 1.7 from the 2.0?

	Thanks for any advice, Alex

Subject: Re: How to tell a 914 1.7L from a 2.0L

The chassis number is really simple: the 3rd digit gives the year.
9 = 69, 0 = 70, 1 = 71, etc.

The engine number is on the case, near the oil filler. It should 
either start with an E or a G. GA is the 73-74 2.0, GC is the
75-75 2.0. Anything else is *NOT* a real 2.0, but it may have
been built out as a 2.0. Another *KEY* clue is that 2.0 heads
only have 3 studs on the intake manifold -- one between the ports,
and one on either end. You ideally want both a G series case and
a 3-stud head -- I've seen G-cases built up with 1.8 heads, and
well, nothing really fits if you try to treat it like a 2.0...

I found 4 14"x5.5" Fuchs this weekend advertised for $350 with
some Michellin "sport?" tires (P215 60 profile).  Is this a good deal?
I'm more interested in the wheels than the tires, just so they have
some usable rubber on them.

The factory manuals are not very clear on what are the largest permissable
wheels/tires for a stock '66 911/2.  I'd like to put the largest size
permissable wheels/tires on it.  I also dont want any scraping/rubbing.

Has anyone already looked at the old 911/2s for their largest wheel/tire sizes
for a '66 through '68 short wheelbase version?

Also, since they're 20+ years old, they will probably need to be
"reconditioned".  How expensive is this and does anyone have any
experience with doing this?

Thanks!!

Before you get all excited, no, it's not a fabulous like-new rebuilt engine
with all original parts.  Actually it probably is almost all original parts,
but it is (1) completely disassembled and (2) has one seized piston/cylinder
pair.  It should be complete, though, and I recall that the case, crank etc.
all looked pretty good.  No warranties, though!

I bought it many years ago thinking that I'd do something wonderful with it,
but it's till sitting in my garage (which will soon need space for a spare
914 2.0L motor).  So if anyone is sufficiently interested to either pick it
up (Kitchener-Waterloo is about an hour west of Toronto) or to pay for
shipping, it's yours.

REGARDING                914 Rebuild
    I haven't seen anything out of PorschePhiles since the Who's Who and the
FTP announcements, so here's something to get things moving.

    What kind of parts do people recommend for rebuilding a 914 engine.  I've
just got the stock '74 1.8, and I want to keep it stock.  I'm not too
interested in boosting the performance, because I still have to get the sucker
smogged every other year.
    Since the holidays have just passed, money is an issue.  I think that I'm
looking for parts that may not necessarily be the top of the line, but are a
bit more reasonable in price, and have proven durability.
    The obvious would _seem_ to be Mahle pistons and cylinders.  That is OE on
these things, right?  What about bearings and such?  Is EBS(Engine Builders'
Supply, which we see lots of ads for in the Porsche Club magazines) a good
outfit?
    There, that should spark some discussion.

I usually use Mahle or Koblenschmidt pistons, whatever I get from EBS.
On the 1.8, I'd still recommend going with the European 2.0 pistons
and cylinders -- you get some displacement increase, you get some compression
increase, and you still pass smog. Plus, if you don't do anything else
along the performance line, you don't have to tweak the EFI.

Bearings -- use only the German parts. Get them from EBS, or Mid Engine
Mania. (Can't say enough about MEM for 914 parts, and they've even
found some of the obscure 911 stuff I need...)

As I've indicated in previous messages, both washers on my 944 are clogged.  1
emits a few drops, the other nothing, the pump makes lots of noise. All this
suggests clogged nozzles. (One helpful person said that the nozzles are much
more likely to clog than the hoses due to their much narrower diameter.) I
tried to clean them with a brush, but nothing improved.

So, I guess the next step is to replace the nozzles. How is this done? Are
they press-fitted onto the hood? I don't see any screws or fasteners. Has
anyone done this replacement? What parts do I need, what tips can you offer?

I want to learn more about the differences between the 911, 924, and 928 -
the 86C911, 86C924, and 86C928 graphics accelerator chips from S3, that is.

Data sheets are on the way, but I figured that unless there's quite a

is behind the assignment of these device numbers.

Thanks for your assistance.

Regarding rebuild parts:  When I rebuilt my 931 engine, I used Stranos in
PA for all the major parts.  OEM parts for 40-60% off list.  It helps if
you know part numbers, but Sam and Lynn are helpful and very friendly

   I have always faithfully replaced OXS sensors by the book
   on all my cars, but it is expensive. I woudn't mind a way
   to tell if they are OK before blindly replacing them.

Oxygen sensors give you a measure of the relative oxygen content
of the exhaust. In order to operate they must be placed in the
exhaust stream and HOT ( at least 450 degrees F ). They will
then put out a voltage proportional to oxygen content like a
little battery, range from 0V to around .9V. This information
is an input to the ECU (engine control unit). 0V corresponds
to a rich mixture and .9V corresponds to a lean mixture.
This is not a linear curve.

There are two varieties of sensor, a 2 wire and a 3 wire. On
the 2 wire the voltage is read between them, on the 3 wire
one of the wires is a voltage supply to the sensor which helps
to heat it up to operating temperature, grounded through the
sensor body.

You can measure the voltage between the two relevant wires to
check if the sensor is "working". Use a high-impedance type
voltmeter. Of course this will not tell you if its accurate
but it should read around .5V nominal and you can choke the
throttle to make sure that the sensor runs down to the rich
reading.

One thing, oxygen sensors do not have a rapid response time.
You will have to wait a few moments for readings to stabilize.

Your washers are probably just plugged with dirt or wax.  Try sticking
a pin in them to clean them out.  A pin can also be used to adjust the
aim.  The other thing to check is the check valves which prevent the
washer fluid from draining back into the reservior.  There is one
straight connector and one T connector that function as check valves.
I have replaced mine with plain connectors without check valves and
the only problem is that it takes a few extra seconds for the pump to
get the fluid back up to the nozzles. (I have a 1983 944 with 110000
miles, in case that matters.)

Fred, 
  Are you sure that the pump is working? My '86 944 recently had the windshield 
washers exhibiting the same symptoms as yours and the pump was the problem. It 
was making 'noise', but wasn't pumping any fluid. I disassembled my pump, checked 
the pump motor for operation, cleaned up the impeller gears, (they were clogged 
with dirt/gunk/yuk from years of use), and reassembled it successfully. You might 
also check for fluid flow at the pump before taking it apart.

See if the interior light comes on...that would pretty well localize your
problem to the ignition switch if it does.  I had the back (electrical) portion
of the ignition switch loosen just enough for turning the key not to have any
effect.  There are supposed to be two screws holding the electrical portion
onto the main unit, but the were mysteriously missing...  To counter this (once
I knew that was the problem), I simply turned the key back to off, reached
under the dash and pulled the electrical portion toward me (onto the ignition
unit), and that did the trick.  Note that if you take the electrical portion
off, you can start the car with a phillips head screwdriver - the only thing
stopping you is the steering lock if you don't have the key.  If you ever see
the movie No Man's Land, this is pretty much what they do for one of the
unlucky 911's.

Hey Porschephiles.

Every year (around Cristmas I think), Grady Clay in Denver used to invite the 
whole Rky-Mntn-Rgn PCA to his Porsche shop "Rhennenhaus" (sp?). He'd have all of
his mechanics move all the cars and tools and floor jacks off to the sides, and 
they'd clean it all up real nice and set up munchies and drinks. They'd set up
a big screen at one end, and a big stereo system with speakers all over the 
shop, crank up the volume, and we'd all go nuts for a couple of hours inhaling
that movie!! We never got tired of watching it...

cheers,
jt

Subject: Porsches in the Movies



While we're talking about Porsches in movies, check this out:


Bullit
- -------
1968. The definitive "Muscle cars wreak havoc in San Francisco" movie.
Steve McQueen drives a pretty 356C.  Fortunatly, he thrashes the Mustang, 
not the Porsche.


Le Mans
- -------
1971.  Steve McQueen drives a Gulf 917 in the 24-hour race.
Note that he stuffs the 917 into a wall trying to avoid a
slow 911 (2.2?).


Looker
- ------
1981.  Michael Crichton tehno-thriller.  Albert Finney gets
hypnotized while driving a 928.  Look for Susan Dey (topless) 
in her first appearance since the Partrdge Family.


Against All Odds
- ----------------
1984.  Romantic thriller.  Jeff Bridges in a 911 Carerra races
James Woods in a Ferarri down Sunset Boulevard.  Some of the best
street-racing footage ever.


No Man's Land
- -------------
1987.  The brat pack steals 911s and 930s.  Porschephiles will
have trouble overcoming the thought of all the dash and steering 
column repair.


Shattered
- ---------
1992.  Thriller with Tom Beringer and Bob Hoskins.  We get some 
interesting footage of a 911 Carerra doing 4-wheel drifts in a chase 
on dirt roads.  A demonstration of some great dirt-track driving.




Any others?

A correction...

Looker: He drives a brown 911 instead of a 928.  Gets hypnotized and drives it
into a fountain.

Additions:
Patriot Games:
1992.  See a green 911SC targa slam into a concrete divider going 50-60mph.
Note that in the Tom Clancy book he claims steam erupted from the 911 - yeah,
right.

Doc Hollywood:
1991?  See Michael J. Fox drive his 356 speedster into a guardrail.  Great
line from the mechanic who fixes it: "Well, I guess this means I have to buy
a metric wrench set" or something like that.

I think in some later Clint Eastwood movie if you look closely at the beginning
sequences you can see a white 914 zooming through the scene on a suspension
bridge of some sort.

I'll think of more later...

How about "Middle Aged Crazy" with Bruce Dern trading in his Olds
wagon for a 928 and getting involved with a Dallas cheerleader;
and Tom Cruise in "Risky Business" hot rodding his dad's 928, and
eventually putting it in Lake Michigan; and "The Dream Machine"
about the kid who is given a 911 (can't remember the stars of this

          I thought the folks on this list would enjoy this fine 
          compilation of octanes, boosters, and oxygenates.  Roll your own 
          booster for much less than retail.  Also note the pros and cons 
          of Ethanol vs MTBE as oxygenates.  Ethanol can corrode rubber 
          products if used in excess.  10% is not considered excessive.  
          MTBE does not have this corrosive property, so if you live in a 
          county where the Feds mandate oxygenates, find out which stations 
          carry MTBE.

With all the talk about O2 sensors, oxygenated fuels, and racing gas, I decided
to dig up the following data that I've gathered.  I hope it is of general
interest to the list.


First, some data about the Sunoco CAM2 fuels from their literature:

SUNOCO "Standard"
Color......................Purple
Research Octane.........115
Motor Octane..............107
R+M/2 ......................111
Specific Gravity........0.725
Reid Vapor Pressure..... 8#
   -- Distallation temp, degrees F --
  Initial............90
  10%............160
  50%............220
  Final...........360

SUNOCO "GT Unleaded"
Color......................Natural
Research Octane.........105
Motor Octane..............95
R+M/2 ......................100
Specific Gravity........0.760
Reid Vapor Pressure..... 8#
   -- Distallation temp, degrees F --
  Initial............90
  10%............150
  50%............210
  Final...........230

SUNOCO "Supreme"
Color......................Blue
Research Octane.........116
Motor Octane..............109
R+M/2 ......................112
Specific Gravity........0.715
Reid Vapor Pressure..... 8#
   -- Distallation temp, degrees F --
  Initial............90
  10%............155
  50%............215
  Final...........260

SUNOCO "Maximal"
Color......................Red
Research Octane.........118
Motor Octane..............115
R+M/2 ......................117
Specific Gravity........0.700
Reid Vapor Pressure..... 6#
   -- Distallation temp, degrees F --
  Initial............100
  10%............150
  50%............220
  Final...........240

And from Rich Lassitter's article in the GS Xtra ... how to mix your own brew:

Formula #1 - Toulene
=============================
R+M/2.........114
Cost...........$2.50/gal

Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium
 - - --------------------------------
10%...........94.2 Octane
20%...........96.4 Octane
30%...........98.6 Octane

Notes: Common ingredient in Octane Boosters in a can.  12-16 ounces will only
raise octane 2-3 *points*, i.e. from 92 to 92.3.  Often costs $3-5 for 12-16
ounces, when it can be purchased for less than $3/gal at chemical supply houses
or paint stores.

Formula #2 - Xylene
=============================
R+M/2.........117
Cost...........$2.75/gal

Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium
 - - --------------------------------
10%...........94.5 Octane
20%...........97.0 Octane
30%...........99.5 Octane

Notes: Similar to Toulene.  12-16 ounces will only raise octane 2-3 *points*,
i.e. from 92 to 92.3.  Usually mixed with Toulene and advertised as *race
formula*.

Formula #3 - Methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE)
=============================
R+M/2.........118
Cost...........$3.50/gal

Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium
 - - --------------------------------
10%...........94.6 Octane
20%...........97.2 Octane
30%...........99.8 Octane

Notes: Oxygenate.  Very common in octane booster products.  Has lower BTU
content than toulene or xylene, but oxygenate effect makes the gasoline burn
better and produce more energy.

Formula #4 - Methanol or Ethanol
=============================
R+M/2.........101
Cost...........$0.60 - $1.75/gal

Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium
 - - --------------------------------
10%...........94.3 Octane (Methanol)
10%...........94.7 Octane (Ethanol)
20%...........Not Recommended

Notes: Methanol is wood alcohol.  Ethanol is grain alcohol and found in Gasohol
in 10% ratios.  Both alcohols are mildly corrosive and will eat gas tank
linings, rubber and aluminum if used in excessive ratios.  Main ingredient in
"Gas Dryers", combine with water.

Formula #5 - Isopropyl Alcohol and Tertiary Butyl Alcohol
=============================
R+M/2.........101
Cost...........$0.60-$1.50/gal

Mixtures with 92 Octane Premium
 - - --------------------------------
10%...........94.5 Octane
20%...........Not Recommended
30%...........Not Recommended

Notes: Similar to Methanol/Ethanol.  Isopropyl Alcohol is simply rubbing
alcohol.

How to make your own octane booster (this is the basic formula of one of the
popular octane booster products).  To make eight 16 ounce bottles (128 oz = 1
gal):

100 oz of toulene for octane boost
 25 oz of mineral spirits (cleaning agent)
  3 oz of transmission fluid (lubricating agent)

This product is advertised as "octane booster with cleaning agent *and*
lubricating agent!".  Diesel fuel or kerosene can be substituted for mineral
spirits and light turbine oil can be substituted for transmission fluid.  Color
can be added with petroleum dyes.

[Thanks a bazillion for that post.  I'll only add one comment regarding
using methanol.  In a word, don't.  It attacks zinc and magnesium very
rapidly.  Guess what is in carburators and other fuel system parts.
I had this graphicly demonstrated to me one time.  I was involved in
racing chain saws (Oh no, not another one....)  In the particular class,
my saw ran on 100% methanol.  Saws are typically made of a magnesium
alloy.  I knew I had to clear out the system after each run but one
afternoon I forgot.  By late evening when I remembered it, the gas tank
had already corroded through.  I left it to see what would happen 
and by morning practically the entire saw was a pile of white dust
with steel parts interspersed.  That included my one-of-a-kind highly
ported cylinder I'd spent hours on. *sob*.  I saw similar results
running methanol in motorcycle engines, though never as bad.  JGD]

Let us not forget "Weird Science" where Anthony Micheal Hall, who is
sitting in the drivers seat, leans over to Kelly LaBrock(sp?), gives
her a kiss and then commences the most beautiful peel-out know to man.
All that in a 928s...

So...okay it was just one scene.. but it was great!  ;^)

Risky Business

198?. Tom Cruise left home alone while his parents are on vacation
(a popular theme) borrows his dad's 928 and dunks it in a nearby lake.
Congrats to the body shop who cleans up the car in less than a week before
the parents get home.

Hey, don't forget Risky Business, where whatsisname drives daddy's 928 into
 a lake.  Cut
to the repair shop, where the mechanic opens the door and water, fish gush
 out.  Quips
"OK, who's the submarine captain?"  (If only door seals were really this
 good...)

This movie is, btw, the source of the line "Porsche - there is no

brakes still squeak every time I stop. Not too noticible, but getting  
annoying after about 400 miles of local driving and 1,000 miles of  
long distance driving. Any idea what is causing them to squeak? I  
know the front pads are ok because I replaced them about 2 weeks ago,  
and there was only a bit of squeak as the pads settled.

My only lead is that the rear pads are asbestos type pads, and the  
front were semi-metallic (the guy at the parts store said this was  
OK). Other than that, the car stops normally, and I haven't had time  
to get under the car and look at the pads. Hopefully this weekend if  
the weather holds...

In the cars I've seen, the LED doesn't tell you a thing about the OXS 
sensor - it's just a mileage indicator.

The sensors only come in a few varieties, so you should be able to go 
nearly anywhere to replace yours.  I once read (in Pano?) that for a 
Porsche, Ford dealers have the identical part for 1/3 price.

The nozzles snap in - look at them closely and you'll see it.  That's

There's likely a crimped ring on the line.  Try the new nozzle without 
the ring (friction may be enough to keep the hose on).

  This is really a tool question, but here's the intro:
  I found myself replaced my cooling fan thermostat switch last weekend
(it's a plug that screws into the top-left-back of the radiator).  It
seemed so simple from the Hayes book, unfortunately despite claims to
the contrary it doesn't really cover the 951, the oil cooler blocks
removing the fan assembly.  I was able to unbolt the oil cooler and
shift it over enough to do the job, but in the process I was wishing for
a better tool than my 3/8" rachet.  I removed the top bolt of the oil
cooler only one 'tick' at a time.  A brake line blocks access to the
bolt.
  So I'm in the market for a tool that could do this type of job easier
next time.  Does anyone have a recommendation for a socket tool that
performs really well in cramped quarters?
  By coincidence I got a Giorett's (?spelling) catalogue yesterday and a
couple of ideas popped up.  A 1/4" rachet would have fit closer to the
10mm bolt.  A rachet with a smaller racheting angle or even zero angle?
The catalogue also had a "sidewinder" wrench, has anybody found such
useful?
  I see a MAC Tools truck often at a local repair shop, does anyone have
experience with MAC or Snap-On?  I would like to find a good source of
tools.  My current tools are mostly from a single purchase a few years
ago of a moderate size Craftsman mechanics tool set.  I have no
complaints but I'd like to do some shopping around this time.

Snap-on makes rachets with both "coarse" and "fine" rachet action.
The "fine" ones have alot of teeth so you don't have to worry about 
the "one-click" problem.

I replaced the same part on the same car (what a surprise) without 
removing the oil cooler or much of anything.  I cannot recall what I 
did with the fan assembly / shroud, but I think I left it in the car 
during the repair.

It was about 4 years ago (blurry memory), but I believe I used an 
open-end Crescent wrench.  I pulled the #1 pan and came  straight up 
from the bottom.  It wasn't easy, but when you consider the failure 
frequency and difficulty in removing everything else, it wasn't soo bad.

Just make sure no children or "offendable" people are nearby; you might

Subject: RE: Brake questions

By "guy at the parts store" I surmise you bought pads at a non-Porsche outlet?

I wouldn't reccomend getting aftermarket brake pads, for exactly the 
reasons you stated, and more.  Kevin Gross had a similar problem years 
ago, with "OEM Porsche" pads from Automotion.

Problem is, when a manufacturer makes two types of a product (one for 
*real* OEM and the other "aftermarket OEM"), there can be / are slight 
specification changes, such as materials used, overall quality, etc.

A friend of mine installed fresh Bendix brake pads in his 911 Carrera, 
and wore them to the backing plate in < 1 day at Watkins Glen.  True 
Porsche pads last for several days, even with his rapid rate [ of 
deceleration].

Having different compounds front/rear upsets your brake bias - not a 
good thing for the average driver.  I'd use the same compound unless 
you have an adjustment valve, or can handle the braking difference.

To finally answer your question, sometimes squeaking is simply debris 
building up on the pad face.  Try several (many) forceful stops, to 
"sand" the rear pads' surface.  This has helped a couple of my friends 
with similar complaints.  Also pay heed to the break-in requirements of 
pads - they bed slowly on the street unless you follow the process.

I have in my possession of tools a 3/8" drive ratchet that has a swivel
head on it very similar to a universal swivel adapter, the only difference
is it swivels in one axis. Either Sanp-On or MAC should have these.

When I turned wrenches for a living in a previous life, we always bought
our tools from Snap-On. They seem to give the better deals if there is
such a thing when it comes to buying tools from those folks (MAC/Snap-On).

I think the choice of tool manufacturer that you buy from is a matter of
persoanl shoice. I could be wrong, but from experience I found that they
were both comparable.

I'm not sure if this will solve your problem but you never know. Not
knowing the 951 puts me at a disadvantage.

Your mileage may vary.

        It is my understanding that brake squeal comes from the brake
piston rubbing against the *back* of the brake pad. There is some tacky red
spray stuff that you can get (Wurth product maybe?) that helps. There are
also special thin rubber inserts that Automotion sells that are supposed to
help. In fact the latest pads I got for my 944 (non asbestos types from
Automotion) have a special layer attached to the back of the pads to help
with brake squeal but sometimes they still squeak a bit. If this still does
not work I heard that you can take some of the leading edge off a bit (with
out filling up your lungs with asbestos hopefully) and that sometimes
helps.

Some thoughts regarding tools while we're on the subject:

- ---
Snap-on wrenches and sockets come in a "flank-drive" version. The
flank-drive is a special contour to the wrench face/socket head
that makes the tool grip the work much better. This really does
work, no gimmick. These professional tools also will not flex
as much on the work so accidents due to "rounding" are avoided.
If you use these tools you will be convinced, and any Snap-on
dealer will give you a demo. Flank-drive sockets will grip the
rustiest exhaust nuts and remove them -- no bull.
Drawback: A set of 10mm through 19mm combination wrenches
will run $225.
- ---
Hazett and Heyco are some excellent German tools. You can get them 
Zelenda Machine and Tool mail-order at 718-896-2288. Zelenda has
good prices on imported German tools including most VW/Porsche/Audi
special tools. I especially like Hazett/Heyco 6/12 pt metric allen
sockets. They are stronger than the Snap-On ones. They also make
very nice offset box-end wrenches in all sorts of shapes.

Subject: CAUTION Axle shaft replacement!


On all models, when replacing axle drive shafts, use only
OEM bolts. DO NOT substitute a "harder" grade of bolt.
I have seen two failures do to substitution of 12.9 grade
allen bolts where the original was 8.8 grade, even with the
proper schnorr lockwasher. 

The failure seems to be due to the fact that the 8.8 grade bolts
stretch under the proper torque which serves to lock the 
fastener in place. The 12.9 grade bolts are simply too hard
so they cannot lock and they rattle loose. 

It is tempting to use the 12.9 because they are stronger and
the head wont strip or round during removal. In addition,
get NEW  8.8 grade bolts of the proper length when reinstalling
the driveshafts after a rebuild because the fastner should
not be retorqued too many times because of this stretch
idea...

There is no difference in stiffness between a 12.9 bolt and an 8.8  
bolt, so they will each stretch the same amount, unless the torque  
applies a tension stress higher than the yield strength of the bolt.   
If the 8.8 bolts are designed to yield at the specified installation  
torque (I doubt it, but this is _sometimes_ part of a design, usually  
with a custom or special-purpose fastener), then the preload tension  
in 12.9 bolts will actually be higher.

What are the "failures" you mention?  If the bolts are falling out,  
use Loctite.  If the bolts are breaking, where are they breaking?  It  
is quite possible that 12.9 bolts will break where 8.8 bolts will  
not, simply because the 12.9 bolts have lower ductility and lower  
toughness than the 8.8 bolts.  This usually happens only under shock  
loading conditions, but axle bolts are subject to shock loads.

Subject: Re: Brake questions

Chris -

Squeal is perhaps _the_ big problem with switching from asbestos to
asbestos-free pads.  Mercedes made the switch a few years ago, and the
horror stories of unhappy customers bitching to service managers about
the noise are legion.  Porsche made the switch too, a little later, and
went so far as to issue a tech bulletin which said something like
that the squeal was an unfortunate fact of life.

Ditto for carbon fibre pads.  My carbon/kevlars are noisy as can be.
I gooped them originally with anti-seize, but that didn't last.  At the
end of the track season, I replaced them with new ones, which I gooped
with one of the liquidy rubber potions you can buy.  Held up OK until a
few weeks ago, when they started squealing again.

I would probably try to find some of the backing material which is used,
I think, on the current generation 911- and 928-series pads.  Maybe get
it for a larger pad and cut it to fit?  Or maybe someone can suggest a
source of generic material.  (Maybe the Wurth guy at PCA/NER's Feb.
meeting!)

You always see warnings that one should match pads all 'round on a car.
Seems like good advice for street driving, and absolutely mandatory for
any sporty stuff.  Your brake system is tuned to balance the fronts and
rears, and for that to work really requires that the pads at both ends
have the same coefficient of friction.

Yeah, Jim remembers my aftermarket brake pad woes.  (In fact, Frank
Kerfoot was instructing me at LRP when the pad started falling apart!)
They were Jurid pads, they turned out to be a different Jurid part than
the one Porsche used in the '87-forward cars.  I absolutely love my
carbon/kevlars except for the fact that they throw off "dust" which bonds
very strongly to alloy or painted wheels, it seems!  Quite difficult to
clean.  With the obscene price Porsche charges for pads, last time I
bought a set, you gotta go with some other source, though.

The 951 oil cooler mounts in the right front of the car, to the right of
the radiator.  I'm putting one in my car this winter too.  If it doesn't
fit, it will be made to fit!

If I didn't have a donor car with the part on it, I might try instead to
use a sandwich plate on the oil filter base.  Pegasus has these, but
I believe for a smaller centre pipe (18 mm. vs. 21? 22? mm.)

In virtually every engine / drivetrain engineering example, Porsche 
really *has* done their homework, and has specified the correct grade 
material and torque.  Arbitrary substitution by non-engineers who may 
not have the whole picture in mind is not a good idea, generally.

Time has shown that the factory has had a few mistakes, of course, but 
by-and-large they know more than us!

I'm making a general point here which represents my philosophy.  It

Subject: RE: CAUTION Axle shaft replacement!

  I've had problems with my drive shaft bolts working themselves loose and then
failing due to repeated bending action at the tips of the bolts.  The cure:
every time you get under the car, check the bolts to make sure they are tight.
Use loctite (blue or green).  Also, at least according to the Bruce Anderson's
911 Performance Handbook (or the Hanes book?), you should torque the bolts to
60 ft-lbs.  This rating is probably for the 915 transmissions, since their
bolts are bigger than the 901 transmissions.

  If you have problems with the heads stripping on the 901-type bolts (with the
12-point star heads), you can get some VW bolts the same length and size with
allen-socket heads.  I did this back when I had a 914 - no more stripping.  I
don't know what VW or Audi they came off of - the local VW salvage dude had
a whole box of them so I replaced them all.

  Also make sure that each CV joint has two roll pins and 4 bolts.  I've seen
one where the pins were missing.  These pins are harder than hell - the
designers probably intended the pins to take all the shear stress in the CV
joint/transmission flange coupling and for the 4 bolts to simply hold
everything together.

The 951 (and all 944?) torque spec for CV bolts is 30 lb-ft., and I've 
never heard of anyone's bolts becoming loose.  Safety wire, anyone?

1968. The definitive "Muscle cars wreak havoc in San Francisco" movie.
Steve McQueen drives a pretty 356C.  Fortunatly, he thrashes the Mustang, 
not the Porsche.


Le Mans
- -------
1971.  Steve McQueen drives a Gulf 917 in the 24-hour race.
Note that he stuffs the 917 into a wall trying to avoid a
slow 911 (2.2?).


Looker
- ------
1981.  Michael Crichton tehno-thriller.  Albert Finney gets
hypnotized while driving a 928.  Look for Susan Dey (topless) 
in her first appearance since the Partrdge Family.


Against All Odds
- ----------------
1984.  Romantic thriller.  Jeff Bridges in a 911 Carerra races
James Woods in a Ferarri down Sunset Boulevard.  Some of the best
street-racing footage ever.


No Man's Land
- -------------
1987.  The brat pack steals 911s and 930s.  Porschephiles will
have trouble overcoming the thought of all the dash and steering 
column repair.


Shattered
- ---------
1992.  Thriller with Tom Beringer and Bob Hoskins.  We get some 
interesting footage of a 911 Carerra doing 4-wheel drifts in a chase 
on dirt roads.  A demonstration of some great dirt-track driving.

Depends. If your application *demands* the factory LSD -- like
you're a nationally competitive autox or time trial guy and someone
might ask you to take your tranny apart -- then use the factory
LSD. Otherwise, use the Quaife.

Here's the deal: the factory LSD uses clutch-type action to partially
lock up the rear end. The Quaife uses a Thorsen-type direct gear
transfer to move torque to the side that can use it. The Quaife
has fewer parts which have significant wear, has smoother transfer
characteristics, and much longer life.

You also have to watch out about used factory LSDs -- they do wear
out, and you may have to rebuild it, replacing the friction material,
before you can use it.

Over here in Ghost Racing Land, we have a 914/6 with the factory LSD, an
EP 914/4 with a welded diff, and a late (ex-national champ in SCCA autox,
class FP) 911 with maximal mods and a Quaife. The Quaife is the nicest
by far to drive.

The earlier discussion on limited slip differentials has made me wonder
what the real benefits are when driving a car with one. More specific-

and the other one didn't, what difference would I notice? And, since this
is the Porsche group, what differences when driving in "performance mode?"

As impossible at it may seem, I really don't know the answer to this. I
understand what it does in theory, but I can't figure out what this means
to me while I'm racing through some twisty sections of Texas hill country?

Since a limited slip diff is an option on some Porsches (968 at least), I
guess they may not be for everybody. Is this worth considering when shop-

Subject: RE: Limited-Slip Diff's -- silly question

You notice the benefits of a limited slip when accelerating strongly 
from corners.  On the street it may not make much difference, but on 
the track it's a big deal!  On a track, some corners require a 
different line depending on whether a given car has a limited slip or not.

Without limited slip, hard acceleration in a turn causes the "inside" 
drive wheel to spin madly, smoking but not getting you too far.  With 
limited slip, some of the otherwise wasted power is forced to the 
"outside" wheel (which has more grip at that moment), causing 
acceleration - just what you want.

Also, if a rear wheel spins free without limited slip, it's possible to 
lose the rear end, i.e., spin.

All these effects come into play in low-traction street use too.  Think 
of rain & snow.

Absolutely! Just remember that Bilstein's are "backwards" and 
the strut body is on top and the strut bar is on the bottom,
secured to the base of the strut tower with a roll pin. All 
you have to do is punch out the roll pin and voila, the strut
is removed. 

Remember to grease the new insert very well.

Use a fresh roll pin and bump stop if necessary.

Clean out any debris that may be inside the strut tower that
would prevent the new insert from seating well, like remains
of the rubber bump stop.

Let's start with "it won't work." 

You have to unbolt the strut from the strut tower *AND* from the
ball joint. And you usually have to un-do the flexible brake line
from the caliper too.

The Bilsteins used on the SC don't have this, they are "backwards".
The roll pin is the only thing holding the insert into the strut
body.

Again, on these cars you can change the inserts without removing the
strut from the car. All you have to do it unbolt the strut from
the upper strut bearing (one bolt located in front trunk) and pivot
the strut out from the wheelwell. Then bang out the roll pin on the
bottom and the insert pops out. Very simple to do.

I have a ratchet from NAPA that has a remarkably fine-pitched ratchet gear.
This means that with a throw that is about 1/4 as large as for a standard
ratchet, I can get it to click. For tight spots, it has proved itself time
and again. Also, for not-so-tight spots, it is more efficient since there is
less "slop" - the "tick-tick-tick" sound continues right up to the end of the
throw, so it takes up the turning moment as soon as you start it going again.

For my "best answer", I offer Turn 6 on the NHIS road course. This is the
hairpin right-hander out of the infield up into the outfield. The problem
I had on this turn was that if I took the fastest line through it, the
car would lift the inside rear, due to the odd contours. If you had a non-
limited-slip diff in that situation, the effect would be a total loss of
power to the road, with possible over-rev/engine-failure. With my limited
slip diff, the result was a much more pleasant trip to just below the redline,
with nice constant power application.

For a slightly more mundane example, if you hit a patch of loose sand with
one drivewheel, you'll get the same effect.

I too am unfamiliar with limited slip differentials. How do I determine
if my car has one? I would prefer not to find out in middle of a turn.

Jack up the back of your car so that the rear wheels are clear of the ground.
(chock the fronts first, of course)
With the parking brake off, rotate one of the rear wheels. If the other one
rotates in the opposite direction (like forwards/backwards), you don't have
limited slip. If it rotates in the same direction, you do.

You can also check markings on the diff. casing against your factory 
manual or check the options sticker for your car (if it has one, 
possibly in the trunk and again somewhere else in the car).  The 
options sticker gives the option codes for your vehicle's configuration.

Of course, nothing says that the options sticker prevents a prior owner 
from pulling the limited slip off the car, or vice-versa.  John's idea 
is pretty neat and gives a definitive answer.

[stuff deleted...]

I don't know how you are going to start this engine if it's not
in the car and connected to a proper fuel supply and electrical
system. The 914 injection requires high-pressure/high-volume
full circuit fuel supply to the fuel rail, which includes a
return line to the tank. Also, the wiring harness to the brain
and various components in the ignition system will have to be
rigged up. Not impossible but certainly not something you can do
"on the spot" in some strangers backyard.

Instead of starting the engine you can crank the starter.
You can crank over the engine quite simply by connecting the starter
to a fresh battery and engaging the starter solenoid. The only
tools required here are a set of jumper cables and a screwdriver.
Remove the plugs and squirt some penetrating oil (WD40) into
each cylinder to lube the cylinder walls first. 

Now you can do a compression test. One word of warning, compression
tests are extremely *unreliable* on an engine that has been sitting
for a long time, but it might give you some clue...

Subject: brake fluid reservoir breather leaking


Hi folks,
  a New Year question ... ('72 911 E 2.4)

When I pulled back the trunk carpet around the brake fluid reservoir I was
surprised to see what apears to be condensation on the "breather" pipe.
Closer inspection revealed that it was brake fluid.  It looks as thogh it
is seeping through the pipe !

The pipe is new (from Porsche).

Anyone any ideas on this - I mean is there a special material for this pipe -
I think what I have is polythene.

A related point - should the pipe go up and over the reservoir or just drop
away from the connection - I was surprised to see a bubble of fluid in the 
pipe which I would have thought would prevent it acting as a breather for
the resevoir.

Any thoughts welcome ....

Greetings,

Some months ago, while discussing the subject above, Jim Selders (I
believe) said "The problem is not that you'll crash, it's that you
won't get out of the driveway."

Last Wednesday morning we had about an inch and a half of snow on the
ground, packed down on most streets.  Since my driveway is short and
sloped, I can most always get out, and that day was no exception.  So
I got to experience firsthand how these tires behaved.  Yikes!  It's
been a while since I've felt that vulnerable to the laws of physics.
In the short distance that I travelled, they seemed worse on the unpacked
snow than on the packed.  My observations may not be truly representative,
since these tires have 5 1/2 years and 41K on them; nevertheless, they
still have sufficient tread, yet seemed to be worse than other tires I've 
owned at similar mileages (perhaps the compound had hardened with advanced
age?).  Fortunately, there was a Tercel All-Trac at my disposal half a 
mile away, so the 924S sat until the roads were well cleared.

Subject: Car alarms


Right now, i have an alarm (Hoffco 2) that is bare-bones basic.
I fear it won't defeat or deter a pro thief...espcially after i 
saw that episode of 48 Hrs about car theft.  Well, having had
my beloved '65 Mustang ripped off, i am NOT going to let "them"
get my 944.  Sooo...i looked into an ignition-kill add-on to
my current system.  Well, this is what the alarm guy told me:

For $75, i can have an ignition-kill installed that will work
w/ the alarm that's already in place.  Unfortunately, the starter-
kill only works when the alarm goes off.  Having seen how easy
it is to rip the alarm out of the hood, this essentially means
(to me) that the ignition-kill gets defeated simultaneously.

OK...option 2:
For $250, i can have a stand-alone system added to the car that
will kill the ignition after 1 minute if the hidden switch isn't
pressed.  The alarm guy sez that this system (also made by Hoffco)
is more fitting to today's environment of car-jackings...the
starter can be killed even if the keys are in the ignition.  In
this way, your car can only be driven just so far, and most
likely, the thief/car-jacker will simply abandon the vehicle once
it dies out in the middle of the road.  He said the delay could
be set b/t 5 minutes and 30 sec...the shorter time is not 
recommended b/c the car-jacker can come back after you if he's
unhappy w/ your interfering w/ his best-laid plans.

So my question is...are any of these options worth the time and
money to invest in?  Or is a thief going to win no matter what?
Does anyone out there have a Hoffco alarm?  Are the prices quoted
to me fair for such a brand?

Thanks in advance!

Richard -

The most efficient means is to use a turkey baster to suck out as much
fluid as possible from the reservoir, then refill it with fresh fluid.
You go through much less new fluid that way.

Btw, highly recommend against bleeding your clutch unless your have a
positive pressure bleeder, eg, Eezi-Bleed.

You want to use the first way. Draining fluid from the reservoir, as long
as you don't push the pedal or bleed from the cylinders while the 
reservoir is drained, will not let air into the lines between the master
cylinder and the slave cylinders, which is where you don't want air.
As Kevin suggested, get a turkey baster (don't let your wife catch you),
and use it to suck all of the fluid out. Replace the fluid in the reservoir
with fresh fluid, then begin bleeding.

>I'm kinda leaning towards doing it the first way...but i'm

The trick is to just drain the reservoir, not the line, thereby getting
most of the volume of contaminated fluid changed easily without allowing
air to enter the lines.

Classical best practice for bleeding calls for starting with the wheel
farthest from the master cylinder (presumably RR), and working toward
the nearest wheel. For the purpose of flushing fluid on a regular basis,
I would be very surprised if it matters in any practical way which
wheel you start with. I would choose a convenient order, depending on
how you are jacking the car. Make sure you check the reservoir
frequently to avoid running out of fluid.

Kevin advises not bleeding the clutch. To some extent, you are on the
horns of a dilemma. If you bleed, you risk getting air in. If you don't
bleed, you risk slave cylinder corrosion. You can bleed the clutch
yourself, with several special steps. Jack the RR corner of the car as
high as you can, to make the fluid as deep as possible in the corner
of the reservoir which connects to the clutch portion. Keep the
reservoir very near full throughout the process. Bleed very slowly.
Alternately, let a shop do the job, if your religion permits this.

Here's a great way to bleed the clutch on a 944. I have found that
pumping the pedal to bleed the clutch like on the brakes is not
effective. All you need is some way to introduce some pressure
to the reservoir, about 5-8psi is all you need. Shop air, a small
air tank, compressed air, a hand pump, try anything as long as
you can seal the reservoir with that small amount of pressure.
Then you open the bleeder valve and let the fluid stream out.
Make sure you constantly top off the reservoir. Note this
procedure works for brakes but it takes more pressure. You may
need to remove the starter to access the bleeder on the slave 
cylinder.

It seems like the 944 clutch hydraulics are especially prone to
failure like on the slave cylinder so changing the fluid is
a good idea.

John:
I think we discussed this more extensively, perhaps before you joined
the group. I have been bleeding both brakes and clutches using the
"pressure on the master cylinder" method for many years, and, as you
suggest, it works fine. On my 944S clutch, I used the same technique,
got air into the system, and had a devil of a time getting it out.
The design of the 944 reservoir (at least the later ones) has a
circuitous path to the clutch portion which makes it very easy for that
portion of the reservoir to run dry, even if there is plenty of
fluid in the other part. This is especially true if you jack up the
LF of the car for access to the slave cylinder, since the clutch portion
of the reservoir is in the LF corner. The set of suggestions I provided
in my previous post seemed to help a lot. I did in fact use about 20 psi
rather than 5-8 psi, and the lower pressure might help as well.

A key point, however, is that if you do happen to get air into the clutch,
the design makes it very difficult to get out, since there is a local
air pocket at the front end of the tilted master cylinder which the
bleed nipple (in the slave cylinder) can't affect, and the feed line
to the master cylinder doesn't reach either. It is therefore especially
wise to take special effort up front not to get air in there in the
first place. This has made some of the group's "shade tree mechanics"
(of which I am also a member) reluctant to bleed their own clutches.
My view is that it takes more care and planning than bleeding brakes,
but if that special care is taken, the benefits outweigh the risks.

    From my experience I would say that almost any alarm system can be
bypassed.  IMHO the best protection against having your car snatched from
your driveway is to use a combination of a deterrent (i.e. alarm system of
some kind with a window sticker or a flashing LED) and an unexpected
surprise for a potential thief.
    What I am talking about is something like a hidden ignition kill switch
that is manually (de-)activated.  A thief who was able to get into your car
would suddenly be faced with the situation of not being able to start the
car without knowing why.  Most likely this would be more effective than an
alarm ignition kill - if the alarm was bypassed then so would the ignition
kill.  Even more effective would be to use something other than the
ignition - say if you have an electric fuel pump you could wire a kill
switch on that.  You could get more sophisticated than a manual switch and
make something that shuts off automatically when the car is shut off and
just needs to be reset upon return, or a wireless remote switch so that
even a persistent thief would have trouble finding it.
    BTW - I know at least one person who has used this method effectively -
he has his car (including a 928, DP 930, a Ferrari Daytona, and various
Corvettes) wired with switches like this and has not had one stolen in a
long time.  Beats a car alarm any day - and is cheap too!

If you really are serious about saving your clutch slave cylinder
from the grasp of corrosion, consider removing your starter, then
removing the slave cylinder bolts and rotating the cylinder (still
attached to the rigid fluid line) so that the bleed nipple is upright,
and then bleeding with a MiteVac...

It does work (if you happen to have the starter out for some other
reason - like replacing the clutch...)

It's best to start with the brakes that are connected to the rear 
resevoir section (the 944 has 3 compartments in the resevoir ).  The 
reason is that you want to fill the rear sub-resevoir (main / filler 
cap area - for the front wheels)  with clean fluid, since it supplies 
the remaining 2 sub-resevoirs via an "overflow" method internally.  If 
you were to flush the front resevoir first (rear wheels, if I recall), 
it would be more difficult since the dirty(er) fluid from the main 
resevoir would keep refilling the front resevoir, spoiling your attempt 
to purge it.  Same deal for the small clutch sub-resevoir - it gets 
refilled from the rear resevoir.

  On the subject of car alarms the best method I have come up with
to stop a car theif is to put quick disconnect connectors on the
engine's fuel injector computer.  When you leave the car take the
brain box with you.  How many theives carry spare engine ECU's with
them.  If a theif is determined to enter your vehicle there really 
isn't much you can do to stop him from getting in.  The other thing

Good idea - works with most cars (except 944 - removing the rotor

For situations where you hadn't planned on leaving a normally-well-protected
car out in the open, the ad-hoc method I use is to remove the rotor from the
distributor. This is pretty effective, since the thief would need to notice
that the rotor is missing (not easy) and have a spare one with them in order
to start the car. Of course none of these techniques stop the tow-truck
style theft.

I have had two experiences with P6's and snow.  The car is an 84GTI.

In '90 I drove from San Fran to Seattle up I-5 over the Christmas break.  
There was snow from Mt Shasta all the way to Seattle, ~500 miles. 
The snow was constant, yet it never got deep enough for the chain 
requirements to be posted--which was surprizing as in many places
there was thick ice under the snow.  Regardless,  I drove the whole
way without chains at around 50-55mph!  There were tons of accidents
but they were all going the other way.  When I arrived in Seattle and
during my whole stay there was compact snow and ice on the roads.  This
is unusual for the area as the snow is usually very wet and melts after
a few days at the most.  Regardless, I never used chains and only once
did I get in a place where I could not get traction as it was a steep
hill.  I knew P6's were not known for there wet weather grip, to say
nothing of their competence in snow, but I never felt like I was on the
edge.  Common sense such as not braking in the middle of a turn, not
turning in too quickly, and gently controlling the occasional attempts
of the rear to step out was all that was necessary.

Based on that experience, I thought nothing of taking the same car up
to Yosemite last weekend.  Sheesh, I won't do that again, ever, without
snow tires.  Let's just say that I could barely keep the thing pointed
straight even with cable chains.  The rears felt like they were on
skis.  Once I went into a slide that had me going 90 degrees sideways
with no warning.  I felt like Mansell just because I managed to keep
the whole thing contained to my own lane (no brakes, opposite lock).
When I came to a stop, facing the shoulder of the road, I checked to
make sure that my wife was not hyper-ventilating, straightened it out
and crept on. 

Regardless, the only reason why I can figure that I had such
dramatically different experiences is that I believed the snow to be
very dry in Seattle, and extremely wet in Yosemite.  Also, the rear
tires had more tread on the Seattle trip--but not much. (they have been
changed since then--ie. different tires with slightly less tread).

The P6's were OK on very dry snow on a front-driver, but in anything
other than this, forget it.

My post presumed that you drained and refilled the reservoir before
starting, as I mentioned in an earlier paragraph in the same post.
It is true that you can't fully drain the front part, but you can fully
drain and replace the back part before you start bleeding, which assures
that any fluid refilling the front part from the back part as the rear
brakes are bled is fresh fluid. Therefore, I can't
see how it matters where you start. Under other circumstances than
those discussed, there may be reasons to start on certain wheels.

OK, I've been pretty good about not yelling at people in public, but this
really merits it. In simple terms: Jon, shut the fuck up and listen for
a while.

To the rest of you guys, here's the deal:

Someone out there (and you know who you are, Wilson!) posted a note to
rec.autos saying "Hey, there's the cool mailing list for Porsches, send
mail to 'porschephiles@tta.com' and join us!". Maybe more than one
someone, but I found at least the one posting. THIS WAS BAD!

If you want to directly recruit people to the list, and know them -- personally
or by reputation -- to be reasonable folks who own/drive/love/eat/sleep/drink 
Porsche cars/tractors/airplane engines/etc , then by all means, tell them to 
send a note to "porschephiles-request@tta.com"
                             ^^^^^^^^

Don't think you're doing *ANYONE* a favor by posting this to rec.autos
or some such -- there are a few monthly lists that get posted which already
contain the *RIGHT* info for this list, plus about 100 other marque specific
lists.

Second, when someone who doesn't know the Code of the Internet Mailing List
Community sends a note asking to be added/deleted/informed about the
list to *the whole list*, PLEASE just ignore it. I send out a very terse
note asking them to re-send their note to the right place, where it gets
processed. OR, if the return note to them bounces, it doesn't matter, because
they couldn't have been added anyway.

Summary: 

* word of mouth is good, "advertising" is bad
* newcomers, listen before you talk
* let *ME* handle the obvious administrative issues
* enjoy the list and keep the shiny side up (or greasy side on the 
  inside, or whatever it is that you do...)

Sorry for my original terseness, which was born out of a mixture of
personal illness and the assumption that most folks have heard about this
stuff before and are kinda bored of it.

Franks is of course correct.  There is, however, a mitigating argument.  If
you have not bled the hydraulic clutch in your car for many, many years,
it is likely full of all sorts of nasty crud.  Bleeding it now may only
tend to move that crud around in a way which causes the master or slave
cylinder seals to fail sooner rather than later.  So there is a certain
wisdom arguing for leaving sleeping dogs lie.

Personally, I bleed my clutch once a year.  But I use and highly recommend
the Eezi-Bleed tool available from Moss Motors, which both feeds fresh fluid
and applies positive pressure to the reservoir.  It is absolutely worth
every cent of the $40 is costs, even though its build quality is mediocre.
The pay-off is in the ease and speed with which you can bleed, as well as
the reduced amount of fluid you consume in getting the job done.  (And
AP 500 ain't getting any cheaper!)

The HP Books "How to Rebuild Your Aircooled VW Engine" has a *great*
section on removing the 914 engine (and transmission -- it comes out
as a unit). Main gotcha is you need to get the car about 2 feet in 
the air...

Other gotcha: don't use anything but grease (yeah, no RTV or anything
sticky) on the pushrod tube seals. The seals are O-rings and are 
*supposed* to slip as the engine heats up. Plus, RTV will fill up your
oil passages and generally make your life difficult.

re: bleeding.

other than the EZbleed, I recommend the snap on pressure bleeder.  looks sort
of like a garden sprayer with a pressure guage and quick disconnect hydraulic
fitting.  you fill partway with brake fluid, pressurize to 10psi and it works
great.  you do however have to obtain or fab a fitting for your master
cylinder.  it costs around 150, but is well worth the price.  I have been
using it on my vintage race car the last two years and it sure speeds up 
bleeding.

Subject: windshield washers -- the final chapter?

OK. Careful readers will will remember that my 944 washers stopped working.

Ken Stanton had suggested that the problem might be that the special 1-way
valves in the system were clogged.  I got a pair of these from Automation (you
need one 'T' and and 'L') and ....

They worked!!!!

Some observations:

I hadn't used the washers probably for several  months during the summer and
fall. Speculation:  Un-use allows solids to congeal and clog these valves.
Thus, use your washers periodically to keep them clean. 

In my car, Fritz, Helmut, or Hans -- whoeever installed the hoses in the frist
place at the factory didn't leave any extra length in the piece connecting the
2 washer outlets.  When I removed the existing clogged valves, I had to trim
off about 1/2" on each side, shortening an already very short piece.  The
effect of this was a helluva time putting it all back together again.
Suggestion:  have backup lengths of hose ready.

Anyway, I'm very pleased to be running again and to confirm the logic: when
the washers don't work but the pump is pumping, suspect these valves.

My sincere apologies.  I sent my request to porschephiles@tta.com when
I subscribed about a year ago.  I have since passed the word on to a 
few other Porsche owners and there seemed to be no problem.  Why has
this changed? (Or did you just ignore it in the past?)

I did not "advertise" to the general public per se, but there were two
articles asking about a Porsche newsgroup that they had heard about

in rec.autos.  I have seen similar requests in the past and
I have refered them to send their request to "porschephiles@tta.com".
Again, I have never seen anything in this group or anywhere else to
contradict this as being the way to do it (including my own experience).

Let me assure you -- NOW I KNOW.  Again, I apologize for the great
inconvenience this has caused.  And I am a bit confused as to why this
response to rec.autos has generated so many more responses than in the
past.  Maybe someone else has posted this mail group address to some

I took out my 914's engine and tranny a few months ago. In contrary to
what most books say, I removed the transaxle first and then the
engine. The rear valance (the sheet metal below the bumper) was taken
off and the car was on 8 or 9" high drive-on ramps. With a floor jack
(which costs about $60-90) the tranny can be removed by a single
person. Of course, you then have to support the rear of the engine. I
used a simple scissors type jack and some wook blocks for that; insert
it somewhat to the side as you need to get under the center of the
engine later. For the engine you need a second person to balance it,
but I think that's an easier job than taking out both peaces together,
at least if you intend to seperate them anyway. The engine will just
barely clear the car, if it doesn't, removing the oil-filler will give
1 or 2 more inches.

 The posting about yanking a '73 914 1.7 litre with the oil leaks is close to
home for me. I will be pulling the engine in my '73 shortly and I have similar
problems. I haven't been driving it and there seems to be an oil leak that drips
down onto or into the heat exchangers when the car has been sitting for a week
or so. There doesn't seem to be any oil dripping under the car but when the car
is started and heated up you get massive amounts of smoke comming out of the 
heater and vents. It burns off in 5 minutes or so (but looks like it's catching
fire until then!). There is no problem when it is left for a couple of days only
 Can someone let me know if this is a common problem area and if there is a 
standard place to look for the oil leak. I fear there may be such a mess of oil
by now that it may be hard to pinpoint where it is actually leaking from.
 
 Also; I was looking through the Auto Atlanta catalog and noticed in one of 
their little "tech tip" boxes that they say if the windows in the doors pinch
on the rubber seal when opening that the frame is probably rusted out and that
extensive restoration is needed. I had always thought that the window pinching
was basically the definition for "body sag" and could be cured with new inner
rockers. Is there a difference between what they call "body sag" which can be
repaired with the inner rockers and the more major problem of a rusted frame. Or
is there just different degrees of damage; the first stage being inner rockers
and the second stage being rockers AND frame. I must admit that I bought the car
before knowing anything about 914's and was told that it only needed inner 
rockers. It has been in storage basically since I got it in the summer so I
haven't actually crawled underneath yet. I will be moving it into the garage
this week or so, therefore I would like to know what to look for as far as frame
damage is concerned. I never even thought about rust damage on the frame since 
the overall condition of the car is basically rust free (ie; floors,trunks,body)
but the rockers are definitly shot. I know, I know, when there is rust it's 
usually the tip of the iceberg.
 That's what happens when you have some spare cash and you impulse buy! I 
eventually want a 911 and I am starting to educate myself NOW in anticipation
of that GREAT deal waiting for me. What is the best book for use as a guide to
buying a used 911. The one by Lindsay Porter?

This is going to be yet another annoying "I'm thinking of buying" type
enquiries.  Sorry.

The 1985 944 is just within my reach (All Porsches are quite expensive in
Australia).  The going price appears to be $30-35,000 Aust.

Are they worth-while investigating further, or would they have been
driven to death by that age?  What are the things to look out for?
Am I to expect very high maintainance, or are they reasonably reliable?

Thanks for your patience.

The most common cause of this is either the oil pressure sending unit or
the seals on the oil cooler.  And you're right -- you probably have enough 
oil on it to make looking for the problem more than a little "entertaining".

You get body sag when the rockers start to go. And it can spread, too. You 
may have rusty door sills, lock posts, pan behind/under the passenger seat,
firewall (typically from the engine mount ledge to up about 4" from that
where there's a seam...), and the ever-popular battery tray, support, inner
fender where it all mounts, and the suspension console mount which is 
directly below it all.

The reason that Auto Atlanta considers it "major" is that if you take it in
to get fixed, you will spend between $1200 and $3000 to get all the rust.
On a roughly $5000 car (in perfect shape) that's a "major" repair. I have
a body shop in Houston we use for the Ghost Racing 914s (all 22 of them)
that gets about $300 a car in labor to do the work, if we supply the parts.
Now, that's a special volume deal since they can see what, about 2 and a
half years worth of 914s to do 8{), but hey, "regular" customer rates
are bound to be similar...

See above. And also be on the lookout for large numbers of shims needed
to set camber on the rear wheels. That tends to indicate either a bent body,
a sagged body, or a bent control arm. Learned that one the hard way...
Take an ice pick with you, too. A really sharp one. Nothing better for seeing
if that's metal or rust under a car...

Near as I can tell, there *are* no great books for buying a used 911. 
But, you should read/own/whatever at least

* Bruce Anderson's "The 911 Performance Handbook"
* Brett Johnson's "The Porsche 911 and 912: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity"
* back issues of Excellence magazine. They went 911 shopping a few issues
  ago, has some good commmentary.
* Haynes service manual for 911 -- preview of what *can* (will?) go worng..
  go worng... go worng... go 8{)

You should also join the PCA and find someone in your region who really
knows 911s. Ask their help. A good friend of mine just helped a guy his
girlfriend works with buy a '79 911SC -- for $9600. It just needed a few
small things, but at that price could have needed a new engine or something...

Good luck. There's nothing like a 911!!

Subject: '86 944 TURBO value?

I am looking for some informed opinions on the value of my '86 944 T.

I know the book value to be roughly 13,300.  This the average resale
price before tacking on all of the nifty extras that the car has.

Here is the list:

'86 944 TURBO
4speaker Blaupunkt with cassette
Sunroof (Completely Removable)
A/C
Leather
Limited Slip Differential
5 speed
Cruise
Intermittent Wipers
Headlight Washers
Rear Wiper
Security System
Color:  Charcoal Metallic
17,000 miles (don't ask.)

What can I reasonably expect to fetch for this fully equipped and
underdriven car?

Also, are there any technical mavens out there who know anything about
the reported trouble in the '86 Turbo where there might be some
problem with the fuel line's proximity to some other part that could
potentially cause trouble under engine stress?

Thanks ahead of time to those schooled in the '944 line.

Robert,
  I bought an '86 944 a little over four years ago and have had little
trouble with the car. The only 'trouble' was the cam balance shaft 
seals leaking at 57k miles, a failing heater control valve (replaced
at the same time), and my windshield washer pump clogging up.
  I have driven a over 40,000 miles (odometer now reads 72,500 miles) 
in four years and also ran an autocross series in '92. One thing 
I would recommend is to try and find at least an '85 1/2 model year 
944. Porsche major significant improvements to the car including a 
much improved dash. I'm not sure what all of the upgrades were, but 
it is quite hot here in Houston and the improved AC flow from the 
new dash made a big enough difference for me. My car has plenty of
years left in it, even though it's seven years old.
  As far as what to look out for, before buying the car make sure 
that the timing belt has been replaced at least at the specified 
intervals included with the 30K, & 60K major services. Generally, the 
only maintenance I've had to do is the regular oil changes, 
tuneups, and alignments in addition to the 30K, & 60K major services. 
  Well, hope this helps.

Robert Salier, Software Engineer - Unisys, Australia

He asks the wisdom of getting such an old car. Will it be any good, etc?

I dont want to address that question (although I assume that he can find a
healthy example, since I see lots of them here in the USA.)

I do want to say that even though the Aust $ is worth much less than the US
$, that A$30K is WAYYYYYYY   higher than the USA prices these cars fetch!

He can get an '85-2 for much under $10K US, and an '85-1 for substantially
less. If prices he indicates are true for Australia -- and if the
authorities allow importation of US cars -- he should consider buying one
in the USA. Then, after that experience is successful he should start a car
importing sideline. The markup is enormous.

Subject: K/CP Blink Codes   (951)

  Well, it would seem that I have a problem with my 951.  About a
month ago it developed a miss under full boost, and would also occasionally
drop into the K/CP fault mode (1.3 bar boost etc.).  The miss was cured by
replacing some badly aged spark plug wires! (Neat little electrical 
storm in there at night!)  And the K/CP fault mode seemingly went away.
Well, now its back.  This time I was armed with my trusty voltmeter and,
I decided to see if I could determine the fault code.  I am afraid that I
read it right. It said 3-3 which means that the pressure sensor in the 
K/CP unit is faulty (Cure: replace unit ofcourse).  It could also be the
throtle potentiometer, but I have already done the test procedure on that 
guy.
  Did I read the blink code on the meter correctly?  I connected the 
volt meter to the led pin of the diagnostic port and bridged pins B and C.
The volt meter registered a series of pulses which I will describe using
OFF and ON. Let each OFF and ON represent a time unit of about 1 sec.
It read OFF ON OFF ON OFF ON ON ON OFF ON OFF ON OFF ON ON ON ON ON 
and then repeated itself as many times as you cared to watch.  Is this
a 3-3?  If so, do you have any suggestions other than buy a new K/CP box?

Thanks!

There's a very good little book out there on how to buy a used 911.
It's called 'The Used 911 Story'. It's about 4x6" in size and it's  authored by
Pete Zimmerman who has a Porsche repair facility in
So Cal, specializing in 911's. Pete evaluates each model's pros and 
cons based on his experience servicing them over the past 20 or so
years. There's a chapter dedicated to what to look for when shopping (body,
mechanicals, etc). Seems the cost was only $10-15 and I found it to be well
worth the investment. Should be available through
Classic Motorbooks catalog or a major Porsche parts purveyor.

My 944 is a 1983 model and still going very well.  Of course proper servicing
(whether by a competent dealer or competent owner) is important, but this
can get expensive.  I get my car serviced by the importer (Hamiltons)
and they do an excellent job at keeping it as mint as possible, for a price.
If you buy right then there is still many years of good driving left.
This isn't any ordinary car!

The '86 model came out with the new dash and many other improvements,
but the price jumps to about $40K or more.  However, it's worth
checking these out.  Above $50K and you are in 911 territory and many
good models of many types are available (sometimes even including the
'84 model - which I consider one of the best years).

As for price differences b/w here and the U.S. it must be remembered
(1) the AUS$ has been about .70 US$ for a long time (even worse now)
and (2) imported cars over about AUS$45,000 landed cost attract a
sales tax of 50% and duty of about 40%.  In other words our new
"luxury" cars are about double what they should be.  The Aus
government has talked about lifting protection for imported cars for
many years, but extreme pressure from the local industry has kept it
at a high level.  Even if duty is reduced there is no sign sales tax
will be.

Also, importing U.S. Porsches was a small lurk for a while but there
are a few problems: shipping (about $2,000), conversion of left to
right hard drive with subsequent engineering reports to show specs
follow Australian Design Rules to allow registration (cost on a 911,
the easiest to convert - $15,000 to $25,000), and, even with all this,
duty still has to be paid at the dock, but this is on a sliding scale
depending on the age of the car.

Note that I am not saying importing a Porsche for conversion isn't
worth it, just that the gains are not quite what one would think.

Over the years our local cars (made by such local companies as General
Motors, Ford, Toyota, Mitsubishi) have become quite cost competitive
with the rest of the world, but anyone who wants to buy an imported
"luxury" car (which is hit with an extra 30% sales over other cars)
pays through the nose.

Hope this has been of some help,
Mark Kosten

I too live in Australia, and realise the difference in prices.  I have an '82
924 turbo and the price they sell for here is around the $25K mark.

I too have thought often of importing them as they are about 1/2 the price for most models, a new 968 sells for about $140K here, but....

The import and sales taxes here are quite steep, add to that the cost of
converting the car to RHD, and then all the headaches of getting Australian
compliance plates.  I have heard that foreign cars sell for much less unless
they have the compliance, and was told to steer clear of them by my financer
when I was buying my 931.

There is already a small market, already sewn up, importing and converting
corvettes and the like, and many parts dealers already import and sell parts
from distributors like automotion, etc.  I dare say somebody is already doing
this, whether you can compete with the setups some of these places have is
another problem.

The easiest solution I would say is to move to the USA, but then I couldn't
stand to leave the lucky country for too long.  But if the is the price we have
to pay for excellence, well so be it.  B-)

good fortune to be onhand at the apparent conclusion of California's
drought.  A *lot* of water seems to be leaking around the roof area --
I have been told that this is the result of a `design flaw' in Targas
in general... I wondered what opinions might be on this.  Some of the
gasket stuff is pretty chewed up and obviously needs replacement; will
this cure the problem?  Any ideas where to look for reasonably priced
gasket pieces?  Thanks very much!

Subject: Speaker installation ideas/opinions

Hi again!  I wonder what people have done about installing speakers in
a '71 911 Targa... I've gotten a pretty broad spectrum of suggestions, 
including a customized rear deck unit (Zbox - pricey, but looks pretty
sharp), 6x9's on the side panels by the rear seats (requires a good bit
of interior and (I imagine) body hacking) and someone offered to convert
the door pockets (the ones under the window cranks) into speaker boxes 
with judiocious application of particleboard, vinyl, etc.  I guess the 
doors offer a pretty good compromise, but I'm reluctant to
do serious irreversible alteration of something that the next owner
might not want.  Opinions?  Tips?  Experiences?  Thanks!!!

Sure, they're worth investigating!  If you find a 85/2 car (or later) 
in good shape, you'll love it!  The handling is fantastic.

You might look out for: fuel line recall (2 lines on some cars), 
updated exhaust manifold (turbo only), updated & new cam belt, clutch & 
guide sleeve condition (clutch shudders on engagement if guide sleeve 
is worn), failed engine mounts (excessive vibration at idle), water 
pump leak, heater control valve leak (directly above a hole in the 
clutch housing - smart move), front air dam damage, power steering rack 
leaks (fiddle with the boots to see if fluid pours out), leaking tail 
lights (water & fish in the brake lights), rear hatch glass separating 
from the frame, worn hood/hatch struts.

The maintenance shouldn't be too bad, but it's still expensive.  Most 
important thing of all: check the cam belt condition and tension 
periodically, and replace it at regular intervals.  This is something 
you need a special gauge to do (U.S. $400).

Aside from these few things, 944s are quite reliable.    ;-)

Two fuel lines were problematic in '86.  One was recalled in '86 (the 
supply or return line from the wheel housing), and the other wasn't 
recalled as far as I know (6" hose above the exhaust manifold, just 
behind the distributor).  These can leak gas and cause fires.  Several 
cars were lost to fire in the early days (Porsche replaced them for the 
customers, I think).

Welcome to the Proud, the Wet, the Targa owners' club!

I have a '81 Euro Targa, and since I live in Houston, "America's Swampland",
this has been, well, interesting. You have a collection of top seals, almost
all of which may need to be replaced. You also may some number of
adjustments to windows, doors, etc., which can cause leaks if they're
wrong. And, finally, the top itself may be bad.

Let's start with the top. If it's cracked, or the seams show splits or if,
when you are in rain or when you spray it with a hose or something, it
gets wet on the headliner, you'd best get the top re-done. Prices for this
seem to vary all over the  board, with ads in Pano or some of the other
Porsche oriented mags claiming prices of between $500 and $350 as the 
"best price" for having the work done, with about a week and a half
turnaround time. I found a guy in Houston who's been doing this since
the 60's who used factory materials, did it while I waited (OK, so I 
waited about 3 hours...), and charged me about $225 for it all. Since 
I'd just ruptured my top in a massive rainstorm -- in rush hour traffic,
no less -- I was one happy camper. Drop me a note if you'd like details 
on dealing with this guy.

Now on to the adjustments. There are three critical adjustments. If the
car has ever been in an accident, the distance between the inner edge of
the windshield frame and the roll bar may be off. If it is, then there's
*NOTHING* you can do to stop the leak that doesn't involve having your
car dropped on an Bosch or Hunter alignment frame and re-bent to be right.
The other two adjustments are easier. The angle that the front "vent" 
window meets the windshield may be off, as may the height of the door
window glass. Either of these causes the seals not to, well, seal. Casual
inspection may show you if this is the case. One check for window height
is does the car sound different (wind noise) if you close the door with 
the window up vs. closing the door with the window down then raising the
window. A body shop can make these adjustments easily, or you can take
your door apart and try it yourself (then, typically, take all the pieces
down to the bodyshop anyway....)

Finally, seals. Clearly if the seals are shot, then none of the above
matters. You'll leak. If your '71 has the original factory seals, they're 
shot. About 15 years ago, most likely... The seal you need to worry about
most are the *BIG* guy that wraps around the front door jamb across the
windshield frame and down the other side. That's a $200 part, and it's
hard to install right. The other seals that leak most are the side seals
where the top meets the door glass. They're cheaper, but should be replaced
when you rebuild your top as it's easier to do it then. The other seals, where
the trailing edge of the top meets the roll bar, and the roll bar to
door glass seals, are less likely to get you wet it they fail. 

Buy your seals from someone that knows what they're doing, like Tweaks, or
Stoddard, or Automotion. If you shop around, you'll find that the "best"
prices are close to each other. In fact, you should include your local
Porsche dealer on that list as you shop, because I've found that lately,
they're damned competitive. I sort of write it off to competition, what
with flat car sales and their parts market being drained off by the
aftermarket.

Final suggestion: if it's raining, and you're driving at least 70 MPH,
you can have the top off and not get wet. Just a thought, mind you...

I've got a pair of Pioneer TSX-200's on the rear deck of my 73 coupe.
These are surface mounts with a nifty molded body that closely fits the
contours of the rear glass.  I was able mount them onto the rear seat
belt "hooks" - no surgery or drilling requires.  With the early model
rear decks, you're stuck with either a custom enclosure or surface mounts.

These speakers sound great - and they go for around $70 or so at your local
discount audio type place.  I've got a pair of 6.5" in the carpet pockets
up front, and two more 6.5" in the doors that aren't connected to anything.
I'd eventually like to replace the door speakers with some decent ones and
get an extra amp to drive them.

I am in the midst of replacing the clutch on my 88 951.

(BTW, even if you are a skilled shade tree mechanic with
lots of experience in dealing with difficult situations,
I wouldn't recommend this job.  If I had to do it again,
I would buy the clutch aftermarket (about $540 last time
I checked for the 3-piece set) and shell out $900 to your
local Porsche mechanic to let them deal with it.  It is
best described as a difficult job.)

The clutch was down to the rivets - specifically, it
juddered on engagement and the tops of 2 of the rivets
facing the flywheel were just barely brightened from
touching the flywheel.  After taking some steel wool
and lightly cleaning the flywheel, there appears to be
a bit of roughness - no obvious scoring, no blue spots
from heat discoloration, just a bit of unevenness.    

I am soliciting the opinions of those on the net on
whether or not I should attempt to remove the flywheel
to have it resurfaced.  I don't have a compressor or
air tools, and my previous experience with the 12-point
bolts holding the clutch to the flywheel (which I had
to drill out, slightly damaging the ring gear) makes
me shy about attempting.  The last thing I am about
to do is drill into the crankshaft should the bolt
heads become stripped!

What would you guys recommend?  Should I spring for
a compressor, and appropriate air tools?  Is there an
easier way to remove the bolts without managing to loosen
the crankshaft pulley bolt?

Assuming I get this far, does anyone have any words
of wisdom during reassembly?

Thanks again.

What's that song about 'never rains in California'? Global
meteorological evolution I guess. Yes, there was a Targa design
flaw in the front seal (windshield frame top to front of Targa top)
of the first Targas (67-68). But this has long since been 
corrected by both the factory and all the aftermarket folks. 

After shopping for, buying, and replacing every rubber seal on my
Roadster and several for my Targa, I've come to the conclusion
that there is no consistency as to price or quality amongst vendors.
One vendor will have the 'best' (in price and quality) door seals, but have
grossly inferior windshield or window seals. However, in lieu of spending many
hours shopping around for individual seals, I suggest the following guideline:
For more original and correct, go with Stoddard or your local dealer (remember,
Stoddard is one of the premier Porsche dealers in the US). For durability and
price, go
with International Mercantile in Del Mar, CA (619) 438-2205 (9-3 pst). They use
DuPont Nordel or neoprene rubber which is more resistant to ozone cracking and
oxidation than the German stuff.
Hope this helps.

I would most emphatically recommend that you replace anything in the 
clutch area that looks imperfect, or likely to fail within 30-50K 
miles!  As you now know, pulling a 944 clutch is a major headache and 
requires more than the average tool box contents.  Now that you're in 
there, replace everything.  You wouldn't want to do this again in 2 
years, or pay the $900 labor to pull it apart again, would you?

I do not have specific recommendations regarding air tools, etc.  Can 
your mechanic give you some hints? - i.e., someone who's done the job before.

Good luck,

Do you use the clutch to engage/dissengage, or do you like to slip it?
I know that a properly ground flywheel will dissipate heat better than
a smooth or worn one, but if you don't heat it up, what use is that?
If there aren't any grooves where the rivets would have met it, it doesn't
seem worth it to resurface unless you like those clutch-slipping drag-race
launches.

> What would you guys recommend?  Should I spring for

Well, if you include the effort involved in paying for the compressor,
setting it up, getting the air tools, connecting up all the hoses and
whatnot, I'd say that air tools may be a little bit harder than the
other good way, but only the first time. After that, of course, you have
air and can no longer moan about not having it...

The other good way is to use a flywheel lock. I have such a doohicky for
my Beetle, and am quite glad since I plan to use it soon. It's really nice,
you ust use it backwards if youy have the 200mm flywheel instead of the
180 (which is good, since I'm taking off the 180 and putting on a 200).
I do have air tools, so it's not essential, but with it, I can set the
torque properly on the reinstall. What it looks like is this:

  /|           |\
 / |___________| \
 |               |
 |       O       |
 |  ___________  |
 \ |           | /
  \|           |/

The "O" in the middle is a stud that goes into a hole on the crank-case
that is conveniently located (due to the desire to hold a transmission on).
The teeth on the sides mesh with the ring-gear. Using nothing but this,
a breaker bar, and a 6' cheater pipe, My friend Mike an I were able to
remove and reinstall the gland nut on my current transmission. The torque
required to remove it was more than most air tools can handle anyway (about
500lbft). Reinstallation was at (I think) 260lbft, which is in range for
most air impact wreches in the 1/2" drive range.

I would only add to Stan's reply that it isn't _that_ hard to adjust the 
window to roof top height and angle (at least I was able to do it 
successfully).  I don't know about in '71, but in by '80 there is a part
that (memory pretty foggy here) that connects the lower window frame to 
the raising mechanism which was made out of pot metal and I think is
inevitably broken.  This needs to be replaced, and there is some kind
of superseded part that goes with the fix that makes the whole thing
work better (check with dealer).  I would also add that the "improved"
Targa top clips which are available (check ad in Panorama, or I can get
you the name, its a small home-based operation in Sacramento or thereabouts, 
I think) help _greatly_.  They turned my top from a wind leaking 
annoyance to into a nice tight fit.  Don't give up, it is possible to have
wind and waterproof fit on a Targa top with some work.  I have replaced 
my window seal, roll bar seal, the aforementioned clips, and adjusted the
windows.  I get a little water in if I hit the window just wrong with
a high pressure spray and the only wind noise I hear now is actually from 
somewhere down low on the door.  I could probable have a perfect window
seal if I replaced the window seals on the Targa top.  Good luck, and 
Targas are the greatest!

A guy in the Boston area has just that, and some 225/50 VR16's, for

Subject: Gauge Faces?

Hi all-

Please add me to this lis..... Ooops, just kidding.

Seriously, though, anybody out there know of a decent source for vdo gauge
faces?  My 931 has standard instruments (white numerals on a black face,
red needles) except for the speedo, which has been 'blessed' with yellow
numbers and needle on a black face.  Sorry guys, but a 944 speedo face just
doesn't make it on a 931.  I'd like to change it.

North Hollywood Speedo is willing to 'recondition' my speedo for $70+, but
won't sell me just a face.  The junk places I've checked so far only want to
deal in whole instruments (understandably).  Any other (cheaper) alternatives?

>> Does anyone know what year the ill-fated 2.7 engine was changed >>to

For the 1978 model year, the 3.0 liter 911SC engine was introduced 
in the US market. From all I've read and hear, it is an extremely
reliable and strong engine (reports of >150K miles without a 
rebuild are not uncommon).

>>Anyone have any clue?

I suggest you follow Bruce Anderson's advice---namely, buy the latest model 911
you can afford, preferably starting with the '78 SC. The problems that plagued
the 2.7 engine were solved by then and improvements and refinements have been
made every year since. Makes sense to me. It's been my observation there are
many fine relatively low mileage examples of the '78-83 911SC currently
available in the $12-15K range. Good luck and be sure to have a leakdown test
done.

Subject: 944S2 air filter

My weekend project was the replacement of the air filter in my 944S2. This
is not the simple project you would think, since the filter box is not in
plain view, as it is in the regular 944, but is rather hidden away under a
body panel which must be removed.

Thanks to Kevin Gross who sent me man pages on the procedure.

The whole job took about 1 hour. The nosepiece of the car is removed -- it
is bolted and screwed in place -- revealing the filter box which is very
simply opened. The new filter is inserted and the process reversed. If
anyone is interested in details, call me or send email.


Lastly, for those interested (with credit to Curtis Eames)
for the 944S2, the correct part# is 94411016600.  
The 944S part# is 94411018800

9:21 AM
YAAARGH!

    Excuse me, I needed to do that.
    Well, we've just gotten through the first significant rain thatwe've had
here in Northern California since I bought my little blue 914.  Like many of
the rest of you, I found that the Targa top may be just a little less secure
than I thought.
    My own researches indicate that EASY up in Emeryville has pretty good
prices on new seals.  Also that a new (or new-used) top is more expensive than
just the seals.
    I spent several hours this past Friday removing (almost) the whole interior
and sponge-mopping it out.  That's right, I had standing water in the bottom. 
The good news is that I found a Swiss Army knife that I had lost quite a while
back.  The bad news is, of course, that the carpeting is all wet and filthy.
    My question is :  Can these carpets survive a trip through an  "industrial
strength" washer and dryer?  They've got the oversize ones at this laundromat
around the corner.  Specifically, I am concerned about 1) the age of the
carpets, and 2) the glue on the back of them.  (The "glue" only held on in 1
case, the rest of the pieces just pulled right out.)
    I think the water in the bottom may have caused the battery to run down
quicker than usual.  There are a couple of bundles of wire down there, and it
may have shorted some of them.  Does anyone know if the big silver-box "logik
relais" which sits under the passenger seat reacts too adversely to water? 
Also, there seemed to be connections for another relay next to that one, but no
relay.  What does that one do?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Yet more on the Brake questions:

Well. Interesting replies on my brake pad question. Everyone who  
wrote back strongly reccomended against putting different types of  
pads on the front and rear rotots (I currently have semi-metallic on  
front and asbestos on the rear, and the rear brakes SQUEAK LIKE  
HELL!!!). I also feel the car nosing in on hard braking, which means  
(to me) that the rear brakes aren't grabbing as much as they should.

Anyway, I went back to the (non Porsche) parts store and, after  
listening to him swear up and down that the pads he sold me were fine  
and my problem was with my rotors (I hope to hell these pads haven't  
damaged the rotors), he agreed to swap two of the pads. Now, my  
question is shoud I go all semi-metallic, or all asbestos? The  
Porsche people said that the 944 takes non asbestos pads (they  
weren't sure if they were semi-metallic or not, but they said that  
the pads should be the same). Can semi-metallic pads wear the rotors  
faster than asbestos? Is there another type of pad material besides  
s/m and asbestos? The pads I have on the car right now are Beckers.

Quick replies would be appreciated because this is driving me nuts.  
Next time I will buy "Genuine Porsche parts", but for this time, I  
could deal with wearing these pads down and picing up the right ones  
next time. I'm beginning to see why you all trust the friendly  
Porsche guy and pay those higher prices...

I only replaced the clutch on my 931 about 2 months ago.  Phew, wot a job.

First recommedation is to get yourself some decent sockets for removing allen
head/12 point bolts.  The cost is more than justified after you have to try to
remove stipped bolts from using keys, etc.  I also replace 12 point bolts with
allen head bolts whenever possible.  My brother works for a fastener wholesalers
so I get free bolts, nuts, etc. whenever I need them.

Now I also removed the flywheel as it had some heat spots and had a friend
machine it for free.  Getting the six bolts off was much simpler than getting
the 12 or so bolts off the pressure plate/ring gear.  However as poitned out you
need some way of clamping the flywheel.  However we just used another spanner
on other bolts until we had freed all six bolts.  Also replace the spindle
bearing in the flywheel, it is only about $5 as it is a standard size bearing.

> Assuming I get this far, does anyone have any words
> of wisdom during reassembly?

When reinstalling the clutch get hold of a clutch centering tool.  I think they
are pretty cheap and you can buy them from places like automotion for a pretty
small price.  I think about $10.  As I am in Australia  and getting tools from
the US isn't all that simple I managed to borrow one from the Porsche dealers
mechanic, he has been real friendly with me since I paid him about A$2000 to
rebulid the gearbox and replace the syncro rings. B-(

Another query did you have to remove the gearbox on the 951?  The Haynes said I
didnt have to for the 931 but I could't slide the drive tube back enough without
removing it.  If you have removed the rear CV's to move or remove the gearbox
you may as well repack those with fresh grease.

A final word of encouragement is that replacing the parts off the floor is a
little bit easier now that you dont have to struggle to loosen up those bolts on
the bellhousing, pressure plate, gearbox etc.

Subject: RE: Yet more on the Brake questions:

Chris,

I'm confident that all (OEM) 944 pads are semi-metallic - these pads 
stop better and resist heat better than standard pads.  Yes, the rotors 
wear slightly faster but it's not such a big deal - a Porsche is a high 
performance car and needs to stop fast, no matter what the price!   ;-)

Asbestos is part of the pad compound, along with binders (glues).  
Newer pads don't use asbestos, but still stop the car fine.  I don't 
quite understand this parts guy offering you s/m XOR asbestos pads - 
the pad can have both items in it.

I think what you're really being offered is:
1) conventional, all-asbestos pads, XOR
2) semi-metallic + asbestos high performance pads.

If this is correct, select #2.  Standard pads are inferior and may 
overheat under stressful conditions.  If you track the car, I wouldn't 
*touch* either of these pads, or you may experience dangerous levels of 
fade and possibly warp the rotors.

For my money, Repco Metalmasters (semi-metallic) are great pads for
a 944.  Not only are they great for the street (no warmup necessary)
they are great for the track.  They also do not generate huge clouds
of black smoke.

Imparts lists front pads for about 37 dollars US and rear pads for

>>I didn't know they were open on Saturdays...

Only via telephone on these special sale days only

>>is this a one time event?

No. I know of 3 or 4 in last couple of years. 

>>What hours will they be open?

6:30am to 4pm PST (must accommodate East coast big spenders)

>>Are these sales an annual thing, or do
>>they "just happen?"

They occur about twice a year, but don't believe there's a set
schedule. Once you're on their mailing list via request or 
purchase, you automatically get a notice in the mail.

>>Also, you mentioned that everything in their catalog will be 20% >>off...
>>does this include the Yakima stuff?  I wanted to get a wind guard >>(aka
>>fairing) but they said they had to special order this...do ya >>think this
item will be sale priced?

Yes. Yes.

Addl info: toll-free number is 800-777-8881; local is 408-736-9020
they strongly urge people to call before Feb 13, get on their 
computerized mailing list, and get an advance copy of their catalog. That saves
everybody much time on sale day.
 
>>One last thing...i'm sure you know already but just in case:
>>Automation's new address is 193 Commercial St in Sunnyvale
>>(they moved just last week).

Small correction: name is 'Automotion' not 'Automation' (check with your local
CompUSA store for 'automation' sales!!). One last thing,
I have found Automotion's regular prices to be generally higher than most other
parts houses and the 20% sale discount simply brings them into competitive line
with other suppliers. But if you're selective
and a wise shopper (given the car you drive, you should be), it's a good deal.

Enjoy,

Subject: 944 tires recommendation


Hi there!

I am hesitating between the following 4 season tires
for my Porsche 944 '86:

       Yokohama AVS A+4  (A stands for Asymetric /
       ----------------  Japanese design, I guess they 
                         are made in Japan) 
 
                    
             215/60VR15 at 150 $ Canadian + 15.6 % tax
 
          or 215/60HR15 at 130 $ Canadian + 15.6 % tax



       Michelin XGT 4    (French design, made in Canada)
       --------------


             215/60VR15   (NOT AVAILABLE IN CANADA!!!)
 
          or 215/60HR15 at 110 $ Canadian + 15.6 % tax


Currently, my car is equipped with Yokohama 352 (215/60HR15).
Even though they are worned out, they gripped the road 
like crazy during the summer. (The only way I could 
make the car oversteer was by doing a large U turn at 110 km/h 
(66 miles/h) !!!!) 

Questions:

1) Should I pay the extra price for V rated tires 
even though they are not required given the performances 
of the 944 ?

2) Am I going to be disappointed with the Michelin's
grip on the road during the summer ? (compared to the 
Yokohama 352s which were in my view impressive)

P.S.: Yes, yes I know that 4 season tires are not the 
smartest choice as far as performance is concerned.

In regards to the person witt the wet 914:
I have had the best success cleaning carpets (in a 76 2.0) by getting something
 such as Woolite rug cleaner and using it in combination with the sprayer from
my local "SuperWash" automated car wash...This only costs about $5 and really g
ets the carpets clean.  Also I have on numerous occasions used both "tacky glue
" (a craft store type glue) and rubber cement to hold carpet to the bottom of P
orsches, although in the 914, not much fastening is needed.

To all with whitening rubber trim:
I've found that a not-too-rough plastic brush rubbed on the rubber trim will he
lp remove "built-up" layers of armor all and wax. Also a pure glycerin product
such as liquid "tire shine (or black)" could help... I've often found that the
spot-free rinse in auto car washes will whiten armor-all spoilers almost instan

All the recent talk of leaking targa tops, etc., leads me to a question:

If the inside of the gets doused, and the carpets become fairly wet,
how likely is it that rust will form on the floorpans?  Is it necessary
to remove the carpets and let them air-dry while sponging up the
floorpans, or will the problem just take care of itself.  The floorpans
are painted at the factory, and should be fairly rust-proof, right?

The advantage of using an air tool is that you can get enough impact
torque that you don't necessarily need to lock the flywheel.  You also
can more easily keep the bit straight in the star allen bolts.  They
come out fine normally, to my experience, although I've only done 911
clutches to date.

You can get the job done with a breaker bar, and in fact can generate a
lot more torque with it than with an air tool.  You'll need to hold the
flywheel though.  This can be done by a second person using a big ol'
screwdriver; you don't have to shell out for the offishul locking tool.
If you do try this, be careful to keep the bit as straight as possible in
the bolts, and use as short an extension as possible, none is best.

If it's an early car (i.e. pre-78) and there is wear on the painted
surface of the floor (likely) then there's a good chance for rust. 

When my 914 flooded, I took the carpets out, hung them to dry, and dried
out the floor -- then let the whole mess air-dry for several days
before putting it back together.

When the Targa top *burst* on my 911 in the middle of a serious rain
storm (in stop-and-go traffic, natch), I wound up doing much the
same there.

The 911 never showed any signs of rust except near the holes in the pan
used to mount two stereo amps. The 914 rusted pretty seriously, had to be
"scrubbed" with a cupped wire brush in an electric drill, re-primed with
Rusty Metal Primer, and painted again.

Well, as part of bigger deal, I did a bone-head thing and now have this

I don't want it. If I start spending money putting it in my 911SC, I'll

Extra speed rating never hurts and usually means better tires all around.
Having driven on MANY different brands/models of tires I would say
that you should ALWAYS try to get the best tire possible.  On several
occasions I have been in a dangerous situation and was able to get out of
it ONLY because I had good tires on the car (I particularly recall a
specific incident with a Miata in a rain storm at 80+ MpH travelling not-
so-straight after JUST having switched from factory Bridgerocks to
Yokohama 509s . . . the new Yokos really saved my butt)

* 2) Am I going to be disappointed with the Michelin's

IMHO, either of your two choices will be as good or better in the dry
than the Yoko 352.  I do suggest though that you consider some other tire
models.  A good place to start would be the latest issue (Feb. 93) of
Consumer Reports (not that this is the ultimate reference, but they usually
have fairly reliable, unbiased information) which contains a tire test on
all-season touring type tires.  The high scorers in their tests were:

    Goodyear Aquatread - excellent wet and good in dry
    BF Goodrich Touring TA - good in the wet and excellent on dry
    Bridgestone Turanza QL10 - another good all-around performer.

I believe prices on all three of these are much lower than the Michelin
XGT 4 which was also tested but rated fairly low.

Hope this helps!

I have found all that in Anderson's book "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook".
Engine numbers as well as internal engine type designations (eg 901/02 = 2.0
'S', 911/52 = 2.4 'E'. etc) are listed.

The ultimate list is the Porsche Spec Book for the series car
in question. However, since there are about 6 of these little
guys covering the whole range of 911s, at $6 each, that can add
up. 

Next best place is Bruce Anderson's book "The 911 Performance Handbook",
but it lacks all kind of detail present in the spec book. Still, it's
useful to have around for other reasons.

*************************************************************************

Porsche Says Loss For Half Is Double Last Year's Total


Stuttgart, Germany

Porsche AG estimated its group loss in the current fiscal first half
alone will be nearly double the loss it posted for the entire previous
fiscal year, ended July 31.

Last year, the 62-year-old company swung to a deficit for the first
time in its history.

Shares in the struggling German sports car maker collapsed after the
announcement.  Porsche shares plunged 24 marks, or 5.2% to end at 440 marks
($279).

The first-half losses are deeper than expected and took many by surprise,
said Juergen Pieper, auto sector analyst at DB Research GmbH in Frankfurt,
a unit of Deutsche Bank AG.

Some analysts doubted Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking when he said he was
confident the group could engineer a recovery and muster a break-even
result in the 1993-1994 fiscal year.  "From these numbers, I would say
a break-even [result] looks improbable", Mr. Pieper said.

"Porsche is basically healthy despite the negative earnings", 
Mr. Wiedeking said at a news briefing.  In the past two years,
the company has shed a quarter of its work force, cut two of the five
layers of its white-collar staff and decentralized its operations to
make production cheaper and leaner, the executive said.

With cost-cutting measures that are radical in comparison with other
German automobile makers, "we aren't totally dependent on increasing
vehicle sales" to return to profitability, Chief financial Officer
Walter Gnauert said.

In the six months through January, the group swung to an estimated loss
of 120 million marks ($76.1 million), compared with a two million mark
profit in the first half of the previous fiscal year, he said.  For
all of fiscal 1992, Porsche had a loss of 65.8 million marks.

Officials declined to make a dividend forecast after slashing the 1992
payout on preferred shares 75% to 2.5 marks, from 10 marks in the 1991
fiscal year.  Per-share earnings for fiscal 1992 swung to a loss of 12 marks
from a per-share profit of 23 marks.

The company is braced for a drop in group sales to 1.7 to 1.9 billion marks
($1.08 billion to $1.2 billion) in the current year from 2.7 billion marks
in fiscal 1992.  The sales decline is also deeper than many had expected.
In the first six months alone, sales fell to 800 million marks from
1.25 billion marks in the first half of fiscal, 1991, Mr. Wiedeking said.

The company hinted that the second-half loss might not be as deep as the
first half but wasn't confident enough to give a forecast.

It's doable using parts from some place in (of course) CA, name escapes
me at the moment. However, you'll really want a MIG welder before you're
done, so I doubt it's a "shade tree" job, unless your tree is better
furnished than most. With the right tools, though, it's about a 6 hour
job.

  Excellent point... but for those of you who are interested in Yakima's
products, i think this sale is ESPECIALLY great!  I have on occasion
yearned for products that are NEVER put on sale, as per agreement b/t
the manufacturer and their dealers (for example, Oakley strictly forbids
any outlet to sale-price their sunglasses, especially the M-frames...

     I've received only the Sears, Harbor Freight, SK and Snap-on
   catalogues so far, but Griot's rachet still looks good by comparison.
   I'm still awaiting the MAC and Eastwood catalogues.  I'm not sure who's
   the most expensive so far, but Harbor Freight has some very inexpensive
   deals on "Pittsburg" and SK brand tools.  SK's direct prices are
   definitely cheaper than Snap-On.  The Snap-On propoganda is impressive.
[stuff deleted...]

One word of warning on the "Pittsburg" tools sold through Harbor
Freight and other tool discount houses. "Pittsburg" in this case
means Pittsburg, China *not* Pittsburg PA. What you are getting
is a piece of junk that will fall apart in your hand.

My rule of thumb when it comes to these super cheap tools is buy
them for non-critical tasks, but don't rely on them as your main
tools because they are *very* shoddy. The S&K hand tools are very
good, a notch below the pro-stuff.

P.S. Hurry up and buy your Sears stuff soon, because their catalog
	is going out of business!

Subject: Is Silicone Brake Fluid Bad for Your Car?



Is silicone brake fluid _bad_ for your car?

I ask because that I've gone through four (that's right,
four!) brake-light switches on my '67 912 in only the last year.

I have two theories to explain why those switches fail, 

(1) my master cylinder is pretty old, and maybe the seals are 
deteriorating, shedding rubber, and clogging the switches 
(they are pressure-actuated switches), and 

(2) I am using silicone brake fluid instead of the standard
stuff and maybe the brake-light switches react badly to that
kind of fluid.  

Silicone brake fluid doesn't absorb water like 
standard brake fluid, so I use it in all my older cars (I've
replaced too many calipers and brake cylinders that rusted with
the standard stuff!), and I did in fact use it for 
at least 2 years before my original switch failed, but one of the 
mechanics here in Palo Alto, CA at Carlsen Porsche says that he 
thinks he heard one time that silicone brake fluid shouldn't be 
used on a car unless it was designed for it.  I'm surprised to
hear that however, because I thought silicone was a pretty inert
substance!  

By the way, the brakes have always worked fine with
the stuff, it's just the brake-light switches that have problems, 
and the rest of the brake-light circuit works fine--its definitely
the switch that's failing.

Have any of you had a similar problem with pressure-activated 
brake-light switches?  
Have any of you ever heard about reasons to avoid silicone 
brake fluid?

P.S. theory #3: Maybe Porsche produced a really bad batch of
brake-light switches that all fail prematurely?  Seems unlikely 
though since I've purchased switches from both Stoddard and 
Carlsen.

They are traded only on the German exchange, in Frankfurt.  I don't think
there are ADR's available for Porsche in the US, but a full-service broker
should be able to give you a definite answer.  If they are available, they
are probably the best way to go.  Holding non-US securities is a tax
hassle.

If ADR's are not available, I think you should be able to find a broker
able to purchase shares on the German exchange.  You may find the fees
expensive, though, especially in as much as, at $279 per, you are likely
to be buying an odd lot!

Subject: tools and black again

re tools and black again.

I bought a radian(tm) wrench a couple of years ago and like using it. it is
a bit disconcerting to use because there is no ratchet, it operates by clutch.
I was warned not to oil up the wrench or it would cause the clutch to slip. 
this has not been a problem.

The major disadvantage is that it has to be flipped over to reverse, not using
a standard reversible ratchet. it seems quite well made.

due to the announcement re the sears catalog, I called the tool catalog 800
number and ordered a few things.  I also inquired re the availability of the
tools not usually carried in the sears stores.  the person I talked with said
that they had been told that the stores would still be able to order the tools,
even though the public would not be able to place catalog orders. For example,
the sears best(tm) tools are nice and are seldom seen in a sears store. this
statement from the person did not stop me from ordering about 1.5 RCUs of tools
(one RCU or race car unit = an expenditure of $100, the unit used to purchase
supplies used in racing)

If you can locate a snap-on dealer in your area, they will come out to your 
garage, at least mine has done so despite my not being in the business.

Black Again.  I have used it.  it is not like amorall.  it is a thickesh 
somewhat milky substance which smells of solvent.  it works pretty well. the

Subject: brake pad types -- same needed for front & rear?

There has been recent discussion about the acceptability of mixed pad
types front vs. rear:

I'm no authority on the subject, but I do track my '89 944S2 (ABS) and used to
track my '85 944 (no ABS).

I've always had stock pads in the rear, and at one time or another have used
stock, Ferodo and Kool Kevlar pads at the front. The better pads stop the
car much better of course, and also don't melt off and ruin the front rotors
like the stock pads did, so I much prefer good pads. (In fact, the stock
bads are completely unacceptable for high speed track events.)

BUT, I've never had any problems with the stock pads on the rear, either
with our without ABS. Maybe the car would stop a little better with better
rear pads, but I've never had any loss of control or detectable fade due to
these rear stock pads.

All this is, of course, IMHO.

    One word of warning on the Automotion sale.  They seem to re-price a number
of products just for (or just BEfore) the sale.  In this way, not everything is
offered at 20% off their catalog price.  I found this out when I ordered from
them during my first sale 2 years ago.  You may wish to call them before the
sale to find out what price your Yakima stuff will be during the sale.  If this
company does have an agreement with its retailers, the "regular" price may be
bumped 20% so that the "sale" price is the _real_ regular price.  You should
probably ask for exact prices.

    BTW, is $175 a good price for new 914 carpeting?

In my 1987 944S, I ran the factory pads for a number of track events,
and they were manageable. There was some fade (from pad material melting,
I believe, rather than fluid boiling), but they were usable. Of course
the 944S has much less power than a turbo or an S2, and I tend to use
the brakes less than most (I used to track a stock 914). I had the
factory asbestos pads, not the newer non-asbestos pads which were so
terrible in Kevin Gross' similar car.

The point relevant to this discussion is that I decided to try to fix
the modest fading, and I changed the front (only) to Repco metalmasters.
With this combination (front metalmasters, rear stock Porsche), the
brake balance was clearly wrong under some conditions, in particular
when trailbraking. I am somewhat sensitive to this condition after
looping my 914 at the end of the back straight at Watkins' Glen by
beginning braking before the car had fully settled from the crest of
the hill, thereby locking the back. It spun so fast (at 100 MPH or so)
that to this day I don't know whether it went around clockwise or
counterclockwise. I was going frontward one instant, and backward the
next. Although I didn't spin the 944S, the same feeling of instability
at the limit was there with the mixed pad types that I felt (and 
incorrectly ignored) on laps just before my 914 spin. I replaced the
rear brakes with Metalmasters as well, and the instability went away.

Therefore, I would recommend that certainly if you plan to track the
car, and probably even as a general practice on the street, you
would be wise to use the same pad type front and rear.

Subject: RE: Is Silicone Brake Fluid Bad for Your Car?

Yes, silicone can damage parts that are not designed for it.  Also, it 
can exacerbate the corrosion problem in that any water in the brake 
system will not mix with it, and cannot be easily flushed.  Of course, 
if you *know* there's no moisture in the lines or resevoir, that's not 
a problem.

Silicone (DOT 5) is also more compressable than DOT 3/4 fluids, and 
gives a "mushy" pedal feel in some instances.  Bruce Anderson tried 
silicone on some 935s years ago and had so many problems, they removed it!

Your mechanic was correct about being wary of silicone fluid.  It's 
generally a good idea to stay away from it.  The best application is 
older, historic / antique cars that get little driving (as long as the 
silicone doesn't attack seals/metals).

	Howdy all,

	I found an advertisement where someone is selling their
stainless steel heat exchangers for 250.  Is this a good price?  They
don't know how old they are.  Looking in the one 914 catalog I have
the stock exchanges seem to cost >1000.  What is the net wisdom on
this item?  Should I get it...

	This is the same guy who is selling a 74 2.0L engine for 500
and other miscellaneous stuff.  The engine was apparenly running well
when he pulled it out (2 years ago) but does have about 100K on it.
From what I have been told the 500 is reasonable if it has ALL the FI
stuff.  So that is what I am going to look at.  I will just plan on
rebuilding the engine before it gets sold/used.  I assume that putting
the 2.0L will increase the value of a 914 by more than 1000 (esp a
1.8L) so I guess it is worth it. Sound reasonable?

	Getting real anxious to get my hands on some 914's, Alex

Subject: Fuel Safe cell question

This is a question we'll ask the manufacturer tomorrow (Monday).  But
I though perhaps someone out there may have some enlightenment to share.

One of the winter projects is putting a fuel cell in the 911 race car. We
have received and started fitting a 15 gallon off-the-shelf unit from
Fuel Safe.  It occurred to us, in fitting the thing, that it would be a
little nicer oriented with its longer dimension running from front-to-back
of the car, rather than side-to-side.  The question is whether this
alternate layout would require turning the internal slosh tank 90 degrees,
to let it do its job properly.

If we leave it side-to-side, how important is it for the bottom of the
tank to be co-planar with the road surface?  Finally, since we've removed
the original fuel tank, we are thinking of spanning the hole with a sheet
of metal to recover a little of the structure so lost.  Make sense?  Anyone
done this, and how?

Cheers... Kevin
