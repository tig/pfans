	| Granted, it has Porsche quality, maneuverability,... but ANY

	| in terms of performance specs. The 968 is only 236 hp!!!!!

	Two interesting models of the 968 in Europe are the 968 Club Sport,
	devestating handling, 20mm lower, sport suspension, no electric gizmos,
	100 kilos lighter, fat wide turbo-style wheels, turbo brakes, no
	silly seats in the back, ligtweight racing seats etc etc.
	In the UK the is 28000 sterling, at least 6000 sterling less than
	the standard 968 version. I think that this is very competitive on price,
	and unmatched in price/performance/quality ratios.
	
	For those with 70000 Sterling there is the 968 Turbo S. Handbuilt by the
	racing department at Weissach (sp?), this is an utterly brutal (I think
	380HP plus massive torque) road racer with suspension and brakes seriously
	uprated over the standard 968.
	
	The top line Japanese "sports" cars are all far more expensive 
	the 28000 sterling 968 CS in the UK at least, and personally I would rather 
	drive a Trabbant than a Kamosukazdaota MXLCII 12x-15a loaded with pointless 
	gizmos, (But in the meantime I will stick with my 911!!)


The 968 CS (Club sport) has been racing in the Australian Production Car series
this year quite successfully.  In the 6hr endurance race it finished 1st and 2nd
(only two team cars in the series) and I think it finished 2nd and 4th in the
12hr endurance race (I was in Germany at the time: the results are what I was
told).

There has been a long running battle with the racing association (CAMS) and
Porsche Cars Australia (PCA) as to the legality of the car for production car
racing.  Apparently Porsche Stuttgart sent some information to support the
claims as having production car status.  However I hear that most complaints
are coming from the strongest competion: Mazda RX-7 turbos (6hr: 3rd & 4th; 12hr
: 1st & 3rd).  Anyhow the 968's were disqualified from the 12hr race on
completion as the wheel base(track?) was found to be 15mm too wide.  Apparently
the wheels they were using were not the standard wheels.

Apparently Mazda have been upset with Porsche brakes and fuel consumption.  The
brakes on the Porsche lasted the full 6hr race without a pad change: they have
much larger disks than the Mazda.  The Mazda needed brake pad changes every hour
: and it was an amazing setup that Mazda had for the brake changes.  The fuel
tank I think is almost twice as large in the 968 as in the Mazda: not surprising
to any of us that let our fuel tanks run a little low and then end up with the
bill at the service station for refilling it.

Some privateers have also been running a Honda NSX which seems to finish behind
the Mazda and 968 in most races.  Apparently the guy who runs the 968 team was
going to run some 911's instead, but under the persuasion of PCA and after he
drove the car he was tempted to the 968.  He says the 968 is just so easy to
drive and the brakes are incredible.  Plus the fact of a normally aspirated 3L
competing with a turbo rotary.  It certainly makes good viewing for us Porsche
enthusiastes: seeing the Porsche whip some butt now and then.

Yup, I'm looking forward to this one, I will be interested to
see what kind of treatment Top Gear hand out. Most of the articles
and items I have seen in the non-motoring press and media on
the 911 30th anniversary are of the type "Porsche hit by recession
as yuppies get their P45s" (for the transatlantically challenged
the P45 is a form stating earnings and deductions you get from an
employer when you get fired).

Often the article tends to be written by someone who has zero 
knowledge of the 911, but is just knocking out another `lifestyle' 
feature. 

It seems rather than seriously review the longivity and superiority
of the 911 design, most prefer to concentrate on the representing the
911 as a phenomena of the wealthy 1980s, happily ignoring the
previous history of this extraordinary design. Still they don't
have to own one, which means more to go round for the rest of us!

Subject: Upfixing der 914 III


     Howdy all,

     To sum it up:

          THE BLOODY CAR IDLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     It finally works.  I was having an idle problem on my '74 1.8L
914.  It would not idle.  I have worked on this problem for a number
of weeks looking at the engine management system component by
component.  Once I had checked that I looked at the fuel delivery
system...

     The problems I encountered were all simple (relatively):

          Air Flow meter was dead (replaced it)

          No gaskets on Oil Filler cap (bought new ones)
               taking the cap off when the car is idleing will
               IMMEDIATELY stall it out...

          Fuel flow volume was LOW (not even close to spec)
               Replaced fuel filter (helped, but still not totally
               up to spec)

     These three things seem to have solved the entire problem.  Now I
need to adjust the idle right so that it will pass emissions. 
Anybody have an idea of what emission were present in 1974?

     It was actually a total accident that I noticed that the car
idled.  I was taking it out so that we could work on the race car and
after I parked it I just let up off the throttle.... and it didn't
stall.  I was so happy that I took the girlfriend out for dinner :-). 
Maybe this car will be driveable one of these days after all...

     In any case, I just wanted to share the triumph of this moment
will all of you as you have all heard the problems as well :-). 
(though there may still be a few in the electrical system...)

     Thanks to everyone who offered encouragement and advice.

One of the pullies, when properly adjusted, doesn't touch the belt (!). 
 This seems odd in the shop, but at higher rpm the belt resonates & 
vibrates - this is when the pulley does its thing.  This is normal.

One thing I found when measuring pressures: if you have loose rings, 
oil will help seal them.  As you check each cylinder succesively (and 
pump a little oil around), the seal improves and makes subsequent 
measurements a little higher.  This can "fake out" the mechanic doing 
the test.  I suggest you remeasure #1 after finishing #4.

I think these numbers are good.  The important thing is that they're 
close to each other.

No, it just means there's no major hole - a small gasket failure won't 
show much on the compression check because the amount of leak is "in 
the noise".

No, they break at the weakest point for that gasket, which is not 
necessarily predictable.  Mine have always blown between a cylinder and 
a water tunnel.  :-(

Actualy, having just done this adjustment myself, the balance shaft belt
pulley being talked about is adjusted for two different clearances. It
should have a gap (0.5 mm?) with the lower balance shaft sprocket in one
direction and it should deflect the long span of the balance shaft belt by
between 0 and 1 mm in a perpendicular direction. So, as I understand it,
this pulley will always be in contact with the long span of the balance
shaft belt (at least the tip of each rib) to keep it from resonating.

Of course, one question came to mind during the adjustment... Should the
belt be pulled tight before measuring this deflection or should it be left
bowing slightly outward in its "normal"
adjusted-to-2.7-using-the-very-expensive-tool position? Any comments?

I screamed and pulled my hair out (I'm bald now) last autumn, trying to 
adjust the belt per the factory manual.  I had the infamous gauge too!  
Porsche technical writers leave MUCH to be desired!

The only way to fully answer your question is to talk to the factory 
engine designers directly (fat chance).  I'd suggest you take a wild 
guess, since that's what the manuals imply...

Hello,

My brother has an '86 944 Turbo he would like to sell.  
He's the 2nd owner (since about 10k miles) and he
only drives it in the weekend.  The odometer now reads
26k.  It's in very good condition, with leather interior.
He's getting married so the car has to go :-)
If he can't sell it, I may consider it.  Haven't
driven a Porsche for 8 or so years ago since my
'76 2L 914 got hit.

Now my question:  what is a reasonable asking/selling
price for such a beast?  Anyone may be interested???

Around Boston, the market for average condition 86 951's is $12-13K.  
The low miles might add some.  Overall,the Porsche market is quite 
depressed right now.  You could probably "steal" the car for a great 
price, considering it's abilities and replacement cost.

The 944 series held up well until maybe 2 years ago, then the bottom 
fell out along with the economy and hasn't yet returned.  911's are in 
much better shape; I'd hate to sell a 928S4 right now...

Subject: tensioner update

     I'd like the collective wisdom on the urgency of updating to
Carrera style chain tensioners.  The car in question is an '83 SC
with about 110K on it.  I've heard that since the chain guides
are improved over earlier (pre '76) models, they don't become
brittle and break up when the chain becomes slack.  Therefore,
catastrophic chain failure is not a problem.  This being the
case, it makes sense to update the tensioners when and if an
original goes flat, rather than fixing something that isn't
broke.

     Is this reasonable?  Does anyone have first hand knowledge
of catastrophic chain failure on an SC?  When a tensioner goes
flat, does it do so slowly, with gradually increasing chain
noise?  Or does it suddenly collapse, causing you to grab for the
ignition switch and coast to a stop.

     I know some folks jump at the opportunity to upgrade
anything on their Porsche.  I'm basically from the "If it ain't
broke, don't fix it" school, however I do like to avoid expensive
catastrophies.  I'll appreciate your advice.

Wrong. I did the tensioners on my '81 SC over Christmas or thereabouts.
I had to fish little bitty pieces of chain rail out of the interior
of the engine and then play jig-saw puzzle with them to convince
myself I hadn't left any inside the case. These suckers get *BRITTLE*
as they age -- mainly from HEAT, not chain wear. (Think about it --
they're basicly phenolic...)

There is a distinctive sound of failing chain tensioner. Failure to
listen to that and effect immediate repairs will lead to a catastrophy.
Think in terms of "magnitude of disaster" -- cost of total disaster
divided by cost to prevent disaster. If you have valves kiss pistons,
you're looking at a $5-8k rebuild, depending. Cost of the tensioner
kit is $349, labor is $200-350 depending. So, we have a disaster 
index of what, between 7.1 and 14.5? That's *BIG*...

I waited until I was *SURE* I heard chain slap before doing it. I'm
also driving a car with no 2nd synchro and crunchy 1st gear until it
drops because I already know I need gears as well as bearings and
synchros, so it doesn't matter when I do the work -- might as well run
it until it drops. Given that as a basis, I want to say that after 
doing the upgrade, and looking first-hand at my parts, I wish I'd done
it a year sooner.

Hey! I got it out on the first!!! Big improvement from last month...

My big news: sold two of the 914s this month. The GT-3 race tub, and
the 1.8 liter. So, I'm just down to the racing 914, the 911, and the
356...  Well, the 912 doesn't count -- it just sort of sits there
waiting for a new home...

The motor I blew at TWS last month: it turned out to be that the cam
followers had been eaten away by the cam (over 1/4" in many cases)
which also caused the cam to wear... It seemed to be a metalurical
problem. *BUT* the vendor, SCAT Products, whom you've heard me praise
many times over the years, *REFUSES TO WARRANTY THE PARTS*. I have
an appointment to talk to their president tomorrow, and if I don't
get satisfaction here, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do -- but I bet
it involves trying to take all of their 914/356/FV cam business away...

Point of interest: if you're a PCA member, would you be interested in
affiliating with an "electronic region" in addition to a local region?

We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, you know...  Also DO NOT 
ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too much work. Thank you.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business service where we could write you a tape for a fee.

   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

Subject: stupid human tricks :-(


ok, folks, i'm going to admit that i did something really dumb, and you guys
are going to admit that you knew some dumbshit who did something similar one
time, and this is how he escaped with his wits... :-)

yesterday, while pulling the right-side cam housing off of my '79 928, i droppeda bolt. ok, no big deal, you say, a little fishing with a magnet, and viola!, 
right? well, not exactly. remember above, i used the word dumb? well, at the 
time that i dropped this particular bolt, i had the spark plugs out, and the
holes were open... since i can't find the bolt, i'm a little worried.

what i've done so far: stormed around the garage calling myself an idiot, 
fished around in the 'v' of the engine with a magnet on a stick, looked every
where i can see, with a little flashlight, turned the engine over 'real' slowly
by hand, listening real closely, and fished around in the nearby combustion
chambers with a clean magnet. i have no eveidence that it went into a cylinder,
but i don't have the bolt, either.  BTW, we're talking m5x20 bolt here. 10mm
head. would only fit down spark plug hole is the most unfortunate of curcum-
stances.

what would you guys suggest? 

if it did go into the cylinder, will i hear it when i start the engine? will
it then be too late to save my bank account? if it is in a cylinder, why can't
i fish it out with the magnet?

it is entirely possible for a bolt to fall into center 'v' of a 928 and not be 
reachable by magnet or photon, so its very likely its just laying down there,
in the oil that's been leaking out of the cam housing. its also possible that
if fell where most dropped 928 bolts go, which is into the recesses of the
front suspension components.

ok, so i'm a dork. help me not be a destitute dork (priced 928 block/piston
sets recently :-) ).

    We had a Tech Session a while back in the LPR on this subject.  The gist of
it seemed to be that each type of tensioner had its own benefits and
liabilities.  The older-style were simpler, and could be fitted with a "collar"
which prevented _completely_ catastrophic failure, but they tended to die more
quickly than the oil-fed (Carrera) tensioners.
    The oil-fed ones were very good, but for some reason couldn't be fitted
with the collar.  They also tended to crack their oil lines (in the earliest
form), and gunk in the oil could clog the lines.  No more oil means no more
tension.  Of course, if you are careful about changin your oil when you should,
there won't be enough gunk to cause a problem, right?
    The failure is supposed to be a gradual one, with a "Marble in a Blender"
noise that gets progressively worse as the thing goes.
    The mechanic's opinion seemed to be to let it go until you hear the noise,
then update to the oil-fed type if you could afford it.
    Interestingly enough, he didn't mention much about the ramps, which he
really should have....

I make this adjustment with the belt in the "adjusted-to-2.7-using-the
 -very-expensive-tool position".  This, of course, means that the belt
has been unloaded a bit by turning the crank back a few degrees from
TDC before making the tension measurement with the gauge.

Speaking of "the very expensive tool", I see in Pano that
Automechanika is offering what appears to be an electronic version of
this gizmo.  Has anyone seen one of these?  Unfortunately, the price
is the same as the mechanical version, which surprises me a bit.  I
would presume that the method for measuring the tension would somehow
be different in an electronic gauge (surely they wouldn't just slap a
digital display on the old gauge, would they?).  If the difference is
indeed more than just cosmetic, then I would have expected some
difference in price to reflect what must surely be a difference in
production costs.  Presumably, they'd sell a few more if they could
get the price down.  On the other hand, given the lack of alternatives
for the tensioning job, if the market has born the $380 price for this
long...

Subject: tensioner update


   of catastrophic chain failure on an SC?  When a tensioner goes
   flat, does it do so slowly, with gradually increasing chain
   noise?  Or does it suddenly collapse, causing you to grab for the
   ignition switch and coast to a stop.

Just one thing to add here on listening for collapsing chain
tensioner noises. I have found that the best way to hear the
chain is to rev the engine to around 4000 rpm and then abruptly
let go of the throttle. The chain slack can be heard best in
this "overrun" mode. It will sound like a loud metallic
"GRRRRRR" which quiets down as the engine approaches idle speed.
A screwdriver, with the handle against your ear and the blade on
either chain cover, will help to amplify the noise. 

This noise is your advanced warning of impending failure. You
should not go to the next autocross.

Two ideas come to mind from my previous "dropped and lost bolt" experiences:

1) Drop another bolt from the same position as the first and watch very
carefully where it goes (of course you don't want to compound your problems
by letting it drop into anything that you can't easily get it out of...).
This "technique" has worked pretty well for me despite the "pachinko"
effect of most engine compartments.

2) Buy a better magnet - one that has a wand attached to a flexible head
containing the magnet. Mine is a Craftsman; it has a stronger magnet than
anything I was able to find around the house and seems to suck up steel
without needing to actually touch it.

Jim.....if you are worried about the possibility of the bolt being in
one of the cylinders I'd try other ways of checking before taking
the head off.  For example if you have a good friend in the aircraft
engine industry you might be able to borrow a fiber optic inspection
scope.  With that you'd know in minutes if the cylinders are clear.
If you can't get a scope then buy the strongest magnet possible
drop each piston to Bottom Dead Center and fish around.  If nothing comes
up chances are you probably are clear.

Good Luck.

     I once lost a part in the cam bay of a push rod V8.  After
much fiddling and self criticism, I made an electromagnet (the
magnet-on-a-stick just didn't cut it).  Use a steel rod of
appropriate diameter.  Wrap about 100 turns (not critical) of
insulated wire tightly around it, leaving ends long enough to
reach your battery from your work position.  Find a friend to
help (your wife will jump and scream when the wires spark on the
battery terminal).  Stick the rod down the plug hole, have your
friend connect the wire ends to the battery, and quickly pull out
the rod.  You will only have a few seconds before the insulation
melts on the wire, but if the bolt is in the combustion chamber,
it WILL be on the end of the rod.  Of course, if the bolt is
sedeways it may not come through the hole on the first try, but
at least you'll know it's there (you should hear it rattling
around).

     You may want to remove your wrist watch, and your friend
shouldn't be using a pacemaker.  Teflon insulated wire will hold
up better than the regular plastic insulation, and you should
hold the rod with vice grips, or gloves, as things may heat up.

You don't need to change the sprockets unless they're worn. Same for
the chain. Chain replacement (master link kind) is not really in
the realm of preventative maintenance.

You should definately update the idler arms to the new style. 
The bushing on the early idler arms can seize on the shaft. The
updated idler arm bushings are wider (by about 10mm) and are
designed to work with the new Carrera tensioner.

I'm not sure what year the SC arms were updated, anyone know?
You may already have the newer arms in your engine.

If you decide to use the early arms then you will need a spacer.
Make sure the kit contains this or bad things will happen if you
leave it out.

*************************************************************

This is a **good** idea!

There are a few thing might inprove durability:

      More turns of wire [stronger field too].

      A .5 to 1 ohm resister in serries, this should still give you a 
      strong field and most wire will survive 12 to 25 amps.

Also, you should avoid sparking the battery as there may be
hydrogen present.  I've never seen a battery explode from this, 
but have seen photos...

You could use jumper cables (or similar) and make the final connection
away from the battery.

You can *usually* get the kits from AJR (see ads in Pano, Excellence, etc)
for $349. Other good sources are Imparts, German Precision, Dallas

The kits I've seen have everything you need for the tensioners -- BUT
do not have chain rails. You need to get them separately. I forget what
you need but it's either 5 black and 1 brown or 5 brown and 1 black.

While the fiber optic inspection scopes are neeto-keen, they cost a few

Colgan, all the way.  Available at fine aftermarket stores everywhere.  
You can custom-order it with/without license plate, foglight, headlight

On the other hand, bras are a real pain and can only be used when the 
car is clean and dry.  They easily cause damage if left on in the wet 
(sand gets under it while driving and sandpapers your paint).  Major pain.

Hello

I am planning on getting a Radar Detector.Need info on what to buy.

Living in Norway I am not too sure which bands I'll need to have.

Detectors are not allowed over here,makes me believe our Police's

radar guns could be model 'stoneage'.

Is this worth going to?  I'm primarily interested in swap-meet parts,

OBDisc: I know nothing about this car!

A friend of a friend is selling a '78 gray-market 928 (imported from Germany).
It is claimed to have a new engine from the factory. Asking price is $9,000.
I assume that is negotiable. The phone number to call is 617-944-6303. If that
doesn't work, try 617-935-7773 and ask for Paul - he should be able to get the

Subject: removing exhaust and gas tank from 914


	Howdy all,

	I am having some problems getting the exhaust off of the '75
914 I am parting out.  The bolts that hold on the stainless steel heat
exchangers have been replaced by regular nuts in some places (other
studs have hex head bolts on them) and I can't seem to get a regular
socket in to remove the nuts.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how
to get in there?

	I am also going to pull the gs tank out of the car.  The
manual seems to indicate that there are bolts holding it in (in
addition to the strap on top.)  Where are these bolts?  I have removed
the cover plate underneath where the brake cylinder is and don't see
any.  What am I missing, or is the manual incorrect?

	As always, comments and suggestions welcome. Alex

Subject: PCA Electronic Region

Stan recently asked for those interested in an electronic PCA region.  I
suppose I am one of those.

But, I guess I am wondering what such a region might DO, generally? And,
what it might do different (and differently) than this electronic forum?
I put this out on the big board because there may be some good ideas which
need to be brought together on this.  In part I suppose the question is for
Stan (you seem to have thought about it) but the idea has potential which
others might contribute to.

I get the postings in digest form and find each day's message somewhat like
a magazine (even with entries which resemble ads).  Our regular region PCA
occupies itself, at this time of year, with track events (planning them,
doing them, watching them, remembering them).  In the winter we eliminate
the "doing".  In many ways this BB is an extension of all my local stuff.
What Stan has opened IS already an electronic region.

Hi all,

now that my more mundane coolant temperature problems 
are over and the car has been tuned up to top shape, I have 
time to think about, how shall I put it ... hmmm,
some "porsche-actualization" issues (cf. Abraham Maslow's 
hierarchy of Porsche driver needs):

1/ tires
2/ stereo system upgrade

1/
This past winter, I bought 4 season Michelin XGT tires 
(4 tires: 215/60HR15) for my Porsche 944 ('86). 
They had excellent handling on snow and ice (in the 
Montreal (Canadian) winter which is as bad a winter as you 
can possibly get besides Alaska or Siberia perhaps).

Now that its summer, I miss my worn out Yokohamas (352)
which I threw away when changing the tires.
The major thrill of the 944 is not the performance 
which is mediocre but rather the super cornering
capability and high speed precision maneuverability.
Without good tires, this pleasure is lost. So, I remain
nostalgic of my Yokohamas. PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE. 

2/ Any advice on improving the standard sound system ?

(That stupid Blaupunkt Monterey SQR 25 with those 
4 bass insensitive, treble incapable, metallically inclined,
horrible sounding, weird sized  4' by 6' speakers are getting 
slightly on my nerves !!!!!!) Just as Porsche's CEO is 
ignorant marketing-wise, it seems that Porsche Engineers 
are ignorant acoustics-wise. 

NOTE: I do not want to drill holes, put different sized
speakers or touch the wiring in any way. I would like 
to minimize installation modifications.

Subject: resolution of "stupid human tricks..."


thanks to everyone who sent suggestions on how to verify that the errant bolt
hadn't taken up residence in the cylinder of my 928.

hurf sheldon sent me mail yesterday, indicating that the shape of the 928
combustion chamber is such that if a bolt of that size falls in there, 
it will stop the
engine from turning over, when turned by hand. i was able to rotate the engine
with a wrench, so i felt better.  i went home last night and studied 
the diagrams
in my shop manual, and got out my copy of 'Excellence was Expected', and looked
at the cutaway drawings and photos of the 928 motor. sure enough, the 928
combustion chamber is wedge shaped, the narrow end of the wedge is towards
the outside ot the engine (the 'down' side), and the clearance there looks VERY
tight, like about 0 to 2mm, maybe? i went back out to the car, and 
rotated the crank,
until i could see the cylinder wall/piston conjunction on the bottom of each
combustion chamber on the right bank, and verified that i couldn't see anything
out of place. i went ahead and finished re-assembling the engine, 
except for putting
the spark plugs back in. i rotated the engine with the starter, while 
listening for sounds
of impending doom. i didn't hear any, so i put the plugs in, replaced 
the air cleaner
and fired her up. runs great, no expen$ive noises!  i also think maybe 
i got another
of my oil leaks fixed!

thanks again to everyone for helping me to insure a happy ending!

The differences are significant :-(.  There was an article in the
PCNA publication Panorama last month that outlined the differences
between the Carrera RS (European), RS America, and the Carrera Cup
cars.  The RS America is basically a delete-option USA spec Carrera 2
that has a fixed spoiler, the M030 Sport suspension package, and a
very short options list (Limited-slip diff, sunroof, radio, and A/C).
Porsche had to leave electric window lifts and other weight-adding
components to avoid having to re-qualify the car with the US Department
of Transportation which would require Porsche to provide 10 cars for
destructive testing.  


Many, if not most, RS Americas are being sold to enthusiasts
(please no flames re: Enthusiasts != New Porsche buyers) who are 

updating the cars to the Carrera RS specs.  Mine is essentially
stock except for a roll bar/racing harness setup and front camber
truss (PCA events only for you SCCA folk...) and is used 

primarily for timed racing events. 


The European Carrera RS sheds weight by utilizing thin glass on the sides,
Aluminum hood, crank windows, re-mapped DME for a few more horses and torque,
in addition to some significantly different suspension components that were
outlined in Pano in detail.  I don't have the magazine here with me right
now, but I recall things like different upper-strut mounts, 

lower height/higher rate springs, racing seats, etc.

Subject: 944 tires/speakers

I upgraded the stereo in my 87 951 as follows:

  4 pyle 4x6 speakers in the stock factory locations.  easy to install
  in front, not so easy to install in the back.  direct screw-in, no
  drilling or cutting required.  no external signs of any change.

  Alpine pull-out head unit in place of factory Blaupunkt.  easy to
  install with no cutting.  did minimal changes to wiring and used a 9
  pin molex connecter to attach speakers so that I could attach another
  of the same connecters to the Blaupunkt speaker leads and thus easily
  put the factory radio back in.

  Alpine 6 disk CD changer in left rear of trunk behind rear wheel.
  made special wooden bracket to shape of opening and used exisiting
  hole to attach bracket to body.

Without cutting metal and vinyl, you probably can't improve the stereo
much more.  The system sounded quite good and a *lot* better than the
factory Blaupunkt head unit and speakers.  The factory speakers were
single cone paper speakers that probably cost Porsche a dollar or two
each; replacing them was a big part of the improvement.  With a high
quality coax 4x6 you should be able to get real good sound for
frequencies above 100-150 Hz.  Below that you need a speaker with more
surface area to get good bass response; the 4x6's will only be average.
The only other thing that I could have added would have been a subwoofer
box but I didn't need that much bass.  Total cost was about 1000 USD
plus 30 hours of my time.  Well worth it in my opinion.  Note that you
can make these improvements in stages so you don't break your bank.
Keep going until you run out of money or the sound is good enough!

Subject: 1992-93 Carrera RS


Someone mailed in earlier asking about differences between
Euro Carrera RS and the RS America. Can't help on the RS America
but the Euro Carrera RS is available in three models, which may soon
be deleted soon I suspect, because of the new 911 coming out in September.

RS touring, 260 HP (~285 with official Porsche straight through exhaust), 
Cup alloys with ultra low profile rubber, 20mm lower on supension than 
Carrera 2, full underseal, no rear seats, lightweight glass, racing
seats, turbo brakes and very hard suspension, lightweight glass etc.
I tried this one out and it was great. About 100 lb lighter than
the Carrera 2

RS. As above but no electric windows, radio etc etc. Minimal soundproofing
and corrosion proofing. About 200lbs lighter than the redular Carrera 2.

There was also a prepared racing model, with slicks, roll-cage, battery
switch, etc available from Porsche. I don't know if these are still available
in the UK, but the RS touring and RS started off at about 65k sterling
in 1991 and slid to 55k sterling by Jan 1993. These 911s have not
suffered the depreciation hit that many 911s have taken over the past
year. Only 75 (I think) were sold in the UK and although I follow the market
fairly closely, I have only seen four of five on offer for sale in a year.

I have driven the 1992 RS, courtesy of my dealer. I loved it. Some people
hated it though, due to the hard ride and high noise levels. I thought these
characteristics made it even better.

I often see an all black RS lightweight, straight through exhaust, in the
area where I live (St Albans, Hertfordshire, UK). Nice.

On speakers for a 944: Kenwood makes a direct replacement speaker (I bought
through Crutchfield). The model number is the KFC-463V. The construction
is far superior to the original Blaupunkt speaker, but frankly, there isn't
a quantum leap in sound improvement. I replaced the door speakers but didn't
bother with the rear speakers since I'd heard that they are very difficult
to get to.

You can replace the head unit in the dash with just about anything, but
beware if you want to put in a cd player. The angle of the deck is pretty
steep and the car's stiff suspension makes for a tough environment for
an in-dash cd player. I bought a Denon and it skips. I think an Alpine
would do much better. They have very shock-resistant transports.

As I understood it, some European countries have stiff fines and
even jail terms for radar detector use, so at the least I would
recommend that you should check out the penalties associated with such
activities in Norway.

Not that I would recommend breaking the law, but there are certain
things that people in less restrictive areas (like, for instance,
anywhere in the US except VA, CT, and other fascist municipalities)
can do to reduce their exposure to abuse by the Law Enforcement Officials:
it is well known that, even where they are allowed, the use of radar
detectors greatly increases the likelihood of being given a ticket
when you do get pulled over. So, what some people do is mount the antenna
in a headlight or turn signal socket, and the detector unit itself
in a well-hidden engine compartment area (like under the battery...)
and feed the alarm signal into the radio aux input (or as one person
did it, mix it into the amplifier input). There used to be a unit
called Autobahn Covert which has separate antenna, detector, and alarm
units that could easily be installed in such a discrete configuration,
otherwise it is not hard to convert most units for such an application.

The "discrete" mounting idea is fine, but you may also want a decoy
to give to the cop.

A friend of mine got pulled over ('cause the cop saw him JAM ON HIS

if he handed over the detector, he wouldn't get a ticket.

My friend felt that the cost of the detector was lower than the 
cost of the ticket.

I don't know about turning them into race cars.  But I would have to agree
that they are going to enthusiasts, judging by the number of them I see

One of our fellow Porschephiles learned a bit about this little problem. The
Canadian legal system has a complete cow over a little bitty black box when
they find one. The giveaway is indeed, your brake lights, when they blast you
with radar. Suggests an optional brake light defeat perhaps  ;-)

Just a simple question....if the detector is in your pocket and you
are sitting in the driver's seat, won't the detector, even with its
fancy-dancy right angle attachment, be below the level of the hood/dash
and thereby significantly reducing its effectiveness due to radar
reflecting off the hood and not reaching the detector ? Hmmmm.....

Eh? OK asshole, go down to a Porsche dealer. Look at a 944 (mine's a
1988).  Pop the trunk lid, go over to extreme right/left sides and pull up
the flaps.  In one well you'll find the air compressor kit for the spare,
and the other you'll find the tool kit and the plastic bags. Read the
printing on the plastic bags.

have fun. eat your words when done.

A few years back the people who made escort detectors decided that 11.55GHZ 
was the best frequency to use between the two frequencies used in
radar guns. One thing they did not do is put a shield on the detector to
prevent this frequency from leaking out. The vm-1 and I think VM-2 used
in Canada and other places, search for 11.55GHZ signals. If you have
a valentine 1 I think it will not be picked up by the detector - detector.

Hey 928 owners,
Some of you may remember my question about cheap 928 factory shop
manuals.  I settled on a $30 standard microfiche version of the
complete 8 volume set in 19 pages from TMC Publications in
Baltimore at (410) 367-4490.  I've got access to university
microfiche readers that will print out whatever page I'm looking
at, so this was a terrific deal (compared to $250 for the set and
$150 for a dubious photocopy).  Thanks to all who responded.

Handy tip: You can buy the 928 parts catalog for about $10 from
dealers in NONSTANDARD microfiche format & cut it with a razor to
fit standard microfiche readers.  Very helpful diagrams.

Is anyone on this list a statistician?  If so, is it valid to make such 
a measurement: deaths per capita?

A better measurement is based on how much of the population is exposed 
to vehicle travel, i.e., deaths per passenger-mile.  On this basis, 
Germany's death rate is lower than ours.

The message is that more of Germany's total population die in cars than 
in the U.S., but of those who are in cars, fewer die per mile.  Or 
something like that.

British Columbia, Canada, doesn't have a problem with Radar Detectors as
of yet.  In fact, the last time I got a radar ticket (not in the Porsche
but in the Turbo Colt I used to own), I was flying through some twisty 
mountain two-lane and the cop and I passed each other.  No warning from the
detector until it was too late due to the road/mountain configuration.  
The cop was pleased I had a radar detector because he didn't have to chase
me as far -- I knew I'd been caught.

I've switched back to Yoko's after several years of BFG's.  (The only reason
for the switch is that BFG jerked me around about availability of
245/45x16's, which was exactly what Yoko did a few years ago, at that time
prompting me to switch to BFG!)

So the switch was from BFG Comp T/A R1 road racers to Yoko A008 RS2.  Both
tires are excellent for track events and autocrosses.  I put 'em on my
car in the spring and take them back off in the fall.  Both tires have less
tread than, for example, an all-season tire, and are for that reason offer
a little less performance in the wet, particularly as they get nearer the
end of their lifetimes.  But, yes, they are practical on a street-driven
911 (or any car).

Hope this helps.

I had a detector rigged between the passenger seat and its headreast,

I have used the A0008 before going to Bridgestone's
on my '73 Carrera (no flares).  A0008 were the best
track tire I had used to that point; not very good at
all on wet roads, and as usual they wore out quickly.
I have been using Bridgestone's until recently ..
again they were the best tires I had used *AND* they
had the best wet road handling I had encountered in
a hi-speed rated tire.

I now keep several sets of wheels for special purposed.
I wanted to get something with longer wear and better
water handling for the rain in Austin.  Aqua-tred is
not available big enough, and it turns out Comp T/A-3
are not available small enough.  So I have gotten
Yokahama 509s.

The 509s are known around here for good wear and better
wet handling than the Comp T/A-3.  So far the road handling
is very good, next week I should have an opportunity for
my typical wet road exercises!

incidentally... I have a set of 16x7 Black Fuchs for sale...
used once for an autocross from a 944 Turbo... $1200 OBO.

I run the A008RS on my racing 914, with great success. I run Yoko 
AVS Intermediate on my 911 for street use, and in the 1991 local PCA autox
series, took it to a 2nd place in 911 class on those tires. This year,
I've varied between them and the BFG T/A R1s, and find that the stickier
tires only make about a one second difference.

The 008s (both RS and P) tend to be great in the dry, OK in the wet
if there isn't standing water (that's *ANY* standing water) and
suck really hard if you have to deal with normal rain type situations.

Subject: 911SC brakes.

G'day;

I have a 1978 911SC, bought in California then shipped to Australia.
I'm just finishing up the conversion to right hand drive, and as a
consequence, the hydraulic system has been apart for a long time
(about 2 years).  I've got it all back together again, but the brakes
just don't feel right; kind of 'spongey'.  It doesn't feel to me like
air in the system, but I've given it a good bleed from each wheel
anyway, and didn't get any air through; just nice clean brake fluid.
The linkages from the pedal to the master cylinder seem properly
adjusted, and there doesn't seem to be excessive freeplay; the pushrod
into the brake booster starts moving as soon as the pedal does.  The
sponginess is such that it is possible to reach the stop of the pedal
travel quite easily, although this does provide 'OK' stopping power,
I don't feel it's anything like up to 911 standard.

Could the brake hoses have deteriorated substantially during 2 years
of non-use?  Could that explain the springiness I can feel in the
pedal?  Is there anything else I should check?

Thanks for any advice...

Subject: Re: 911SC brakes.

Andrew -

Make sure there are no high spots in the lines you've run which could
trap an air pocket.  If you have not pressure-bled the system, I would
also recommend you try that.

The callipers, pads, and rotors could also be a problem.  Make sure the
piston seals are not leaking.  Check the pads for taper wear.  Check the
rotors for true and run-out.  Make sure you do not have a loose wheel
bearing.  Check that the callipers are correctly and securely mounted.
All of these can lead to a spongey pedal.

The rubber hoses could certainly be a problem.  Check them for blockage,
cracking, and swelling.  If in doubt, replace them with fresh OEM
rubber hoses.  Steel-brade teflon hoses ("stainless steel hoses") are
not the cure and are not recommended.

Before you assembled the brake system, you should have cleaned the lines
and as a last step flushed them with alcohol.  Contaminants, such as
other cleaning fluids, can easily contribute to a spongey feel because
of their compressibility.

Hope this helps.  Let me know what you find.

I believe that Yokohama's recommendation is that the A008RS2 is an
autocross ONLY tire. The rubber compound is design to heat up quickly
and then be allowed to cool after an autocross run. For track use or
autocross, the Yoko A008RS is the recommended tire.

Canadian legal system has a complete cow over a little bitty black box when
they find one. The giveaway is indeed, your brake lights, when they blast you
with radar. Suggests an optional brake light defeat perhaps  ;-)

Comments from the international fugitive....

A.  The radar detector-detector works.  I was busted by one in a 
brown Taurus SHO.  They drive around with their radar off and this
gizmo enabled.  When the get a hit, they turn around and come up 
behind the pack of cars.  On comes the radar.  On comes the the
brake lights of the guilty party.  He said I got on the brakes so
quickly he couldn't get a lock on my speed.

B.  If you get caught, play ignorant tourist.  It goes something like
this...

OPD Officer:  "Radar detectors are illegal in Canada.  Didn't you see
the sign when you crossed the border, eh?"

Fugitive-to-be:  "No officer, I didn't know they were illegal.  I
crossed near Quebec.  They had -all- those strange signs in French.
I didn't understand anything."

OPD Officer:  "Well, eh..  Why did you try to hide the detector when you
saw me, eh?"  

Fugitive-to-be:  "I didn't want you to see it.  Sometimes the police 
departments in the 'States will be a little more harsh if they
find one of these in your vehicle."

OPD Officer:  "OK, eh.   I should confiscate the detector, but I won't
in your case, eh.  You can keep it, but put it in the trunk until you
leave Ontario, eh.  You will have to pay a $cdn 100 fine, eh.  When you
return from your vacation, just mail it to the address on the back of
the citation, eh."

Fugitive-to-be:  "Thank you....."  Right.  I'm going to pay this one.

Does Canada have the equivalent of "America's Most Wanted?"

Subject: 914 questions


hey there,

ouf finally got around to writing a bit here. I got 
the blue 914 1.8 (73) to my house. This was last week 
and I've got the motor out and started on the rust 
removal. While on this subject, I had a few questions.

firtst
	The tar-like coating covering the trunk and floor,
	I was hoping to get rid of. Does anyone have 
	a suggestion on a method for removing it. My 
	floors are clean, but a bit of surface rust has
	started. 

second
	Most of my car is clear of rust except for the 
	part below where the battery tray was originaly.
	I know this is common, most of the restore places
	sell replacement pannels, but I haven't found any 
	of the ones rusted on mine. Also, is the heater
	tube below the door considered structural??

third
	I posted a month ago that I wanted to part out 
	the two or three  other 914's. Thanks for the 
	responces I got unfortunately I really haven't h
 
	had the time to work it out. Right now I would be
	more interested in some sort of trade. Here is what 
	I am looking for. I would like to find a 914 tub, in
	relatively good shape stucture whise, with or without
	a roll cage. 

fourth
	I've seen the chassis stiffning plate for the
	914/4. Has anyone seen these, or used them ,
	with any comments???

fifth
	As mentioned before, I am working on the rust. Any 
	general or specific comments on the subject  would 
	be helpful.


I appoligize(sp?) for not responding to the mail sent about the
parts. I will individualy go over them in the comming week, to
try to reply. thanks in advbance for your patience.

2/ Is it possible to put different speaker sizes

Heat gun works great for this PVC undercoat. Heat it up with the gun
and scrape it off with a spatula, this works very well. Replace it

Folks,
Got the 914-6 in the shop the other day for a general overhaul.  It's been
sitting for quite some time, covered and out of the rain, but as things go
on a car that hasn't run for several years, there are lots of problems that
were manifested from this sort of neglect.

The carbs are getting rebuilt and having the bakalite spaces put on to increase
the distance of the venturis from the intake ports, Henry my mechanic, otherwise
know as Dr. Weber recommends this to prevent vapor-lock in hot driving condition
s.  I trust his knowledge in this area.

We need to procure some other parts to do the general overhaul right, namely;

 - pressure plate
 - clutch disk
 - throw-out bearing
 - valve covers, lower and upper (turbo type)
 - also looking at replacing the syncros and going thru the 901 trans, any
   tips on these parts too?
 - need to get a cover for the electronics in the enging compartment, this is the shelf of relays and terminals that sits adjacent to the Oil tanks on the
driver's side of the car

As you can see, I have my hands full with things to do and working up quite
an investment in parts on this long overdue project.  As you all know, the
end result will be worth every penny, I wait with much anticipation to once
again get back on the road in the 914-6 and hit the coastal highway, CA 1 or
run up Skyline, CA 35 on a pleasant summer day ;-)

Actually, radar detectors are not illegal here in British Columbia. There was 
talk a few years ago about outlawing them but nothing came of it. They really 
don't use radar much here. Even when they do it is pretty predictable where 
they are going to be. Plus they usually give the public warning when they are
going on a speeders blitz.

It is worth a $500 fine. It does not have to be active

when you enter the province, the signs are posted in

It should be pointed out that the radar-detector detectors cannot
detect a radar detector that is not turned on, so I wouldn't be too
scared about carrying a radar detector in your trunk or a travel bag
if you decide that you want to respect the no-radar-detector law as
you're motoring through the province.

The only thing more important than the French language in
Quebec is money. I heard that fines were not holding in court
because the defense argues that they did not understand the
signs as they entered the province.

Actually, I had a run in with the law last year. I used to 
take the 911 for a run on a remote highway up north. I've
hit 220 kph previous times but this time, as I reached about
180, I see the highway patrol coming on the opposite lane. I
slowed down by releasing the throttle and shifting to third.
I prayed that they would continue in the opposite direction
not having seen me (ya right!). 

About two minutes passed and I saw them racing towards me in
my rear view mirror. The officer asked me if I was testing
out my car. I admitted to only going 140. Then he asked if I
had a radar detector. Being the honest (stupid?) person that 
I am I said yes. They asked me where is it located, I sshowed 
them where it was and they promptly removed it. 

They asked me to destroy the detector by stepping on it and 
throwing it into the woods. They said that they should give
me a ticket for the detector ($500) and one for speeding ($200),
but because I was honest, they wouldn't. I think the reason
was that they did not record my speed with their radar. 

The lesson I learnt was it is better (and cheaper) to join 
the Porsche Club and have fun on the track rather than on the
public roads. So, hopefully when work calms down a bit, I will 
have time to take my car to Mont Tremblant race course for some
drivers education.

BTW, the language police has received about 2000 complaints of
bilingual or english only signs (not just street signs but
private businesses as well) over the years. The funny thing is that
over a thousand of those were written by one disgruntled 
student.

The heater tube itself isn't but if it's shot you have look
hard at the door sill, the inner and outer rockers. One or
more of those is usually shot if the tube is rusted out.

And try Mill Supply for replacment metal.

>I've seen the chassis stiffning plate for the

>with any comments???

Well, it's a replica of the factory kit. It's designed to be
installed with rosette welds, which is a problem -- there is a
lot of metal to metal contact, without any welds holding it together.
If you don't do it right, you'll get condensation between the two 
pieces of metal and it will rust out. But before it does, it will
be a lot stronger... 8{)

>As mentioned before, I am working on the rust. Any 
>general or specific comments on the subject  would 
>be helpful.

Cut the bad stuff out, and weld in new metal. Nothing else works.
And use a MIG welder, too. Keeps the metal from warping. Be sure
and use a sealer on the metal before priming it, or it will rust
again, pretty much immediately.

(Portland, OR) Nostalgic Performance Garage announces the expansion of their 
pit crew.  Last week, on June 2, at approximately 9:06 pm, Miq Millman,
proprietor and cheif spender/wrencher of NPG, along with CFO Mari finished
preparations and accepted final contracts for a new member of the pit crew.
Jordan Patrick will be helping out around the garage as soon as he is able to
hold a spanner wrench correctly.  Miq was a bit skeptical about the usefullness of the new member immediately, mostly due to his stature (7 lbs 6.5 oz, 20"),
and personal habits (sleep, eat, change clothes, repeat ...) but assures the
press that Jordan will soon be of great assistance in those awkward hard-to
reach places....

The rotor should pop off.  It is apparently not retained by any hidden
screws or such.  You may end up breaking it to get it off.  If this
happens, be sure not to let any pieces travel into the distributor,
where they can do damage.

Hope this helps.

Gee, I dunno about this.  I don't have Yoko's official recommendation,
but the tires are V-rated.  I also checked them hot with a pyrometer
at Lime Rock last week, and the temperatures were fine, that is, they
did not overheat as one would expect, for example, BFG autocrossers to
do.  We are running them on a bunch of cars, with no problems.

Thanks for the warning, though!  I should indeed double-check with
Yokohama.

As I recall, both 4x6 and 6-round speakers will fit.  The car comes
with 4x6, and you have to remove them and a screwed-in "template" to
expose the 6-round mounting points.

Dunno about getting the interior trim out.  I think you have to break
some glue seals.

Hi

Thank you for all the response I got.

I'll get me a 3-band detector and test it out.In Norway I believe there
are no such things as detector detectors.

I guess there is very few detectors in use over here.Personally I do not know
one single chap that ever had one.

The cops would NEVER believe you have one.

That is the good thing.Bad thing they are not allowed to import.

Issues 1 and 2 of Performance Engineering Magazine have extensive
articles in them regarding the testing, care, and cleaning of
fuel injectors. I think that there are probably a few of the
"sample" issue 1 copies available, and issue 2 should be out
quite soon... send mail to perform@dixie.com to request back
issues and for subscription info.

Briefly on cleaning, plug the inlet before cleaning the outside.
Don't let the insulation soak in the solvent. Trichlorethane works
as a good solvent. Once the grunge is off the outside, buzz the
nozzle in an ultrasonic cleaner filled with fuel injector cleaner.
Clean the inlet screen the same way - then backflush to clear the
crud off. The article (by JGD) explains a lot better, including
test rig hardware & software.

Squirt carb cleaner in the supply end and then use shop air

For cold start valves and electric injectors make up a jumper

Well, I didn't write this, but I thought it was relevant, so I'll add it
(readers of alt.toys.hi-tech will recognize this; unfortunately I posted it
there, confusing the discussion there with this one).  It may or may not work,
and I don't know if it is technically legally correct, since I've never
done this (not having a radar detector, it is naturally difficult to get 
caught with one).  Also, it probably won't earn you the goodwill of your
local officer, and might perhaps be enough goading for him to get you on
other technicalities.  I didn't write this, BTW.

Title: Solution to Anti Radar Detector Law.

     I live in Montreal Canada where posession of a Radar detector is against
the law.  That does not stop me however, since every system has a loop hole, 
and I found one that works here and would also be effective in the United 
States.  The solution lies at your local post office.

      Bring your Radar Detector in an UNSEALED encelope to the post office, and
have the clerk affix the appropriate postage on the envelope.  Now what you do
is, addrees the envelope to a friend (addressing it to yourself looks stupid) 
take the radar detector out of the envelope and use it normally.  The loophole
is in the envelope.  All states that prohibit the use of RADAR detection 
devices will have a sign posted at the state line, ao you'll know when to be 
careful, but I still use mine.  In the event that you get pulled over and you 
have been using your radar detector in a state that is prohibited, place it 
inside the envelope (that I told you to put postage on before) and seal the 
envelope, and you have no problem.  Sounds stupid but it works, and the reason
it works is that any piece of mail (Addressed Item that has postage stamps 
affixed to it) is the property of the Federal Government.  If the officer opens
the envelope, he is committing a Federal offense, meaning that all charges 
against you would have to be dropped since it was an illegal search.  No police
department is going to attempt to get a Federal warrant to bust you for a RADAR
detector.  I have been doing this for a while, and twice I went to court, and 
the charges were dismissed.

shoot, for a grand (for the muffler) i'd try to borrow/rent one from a
sympathetic 912e friend if you have any.  of course, if you buy one
yourself, maybe you can lend/rent it to someone else.

i don't have stock gear on my '69 912 (bosch 009 distributor, "broken"

A very good point.  Try taking it to someone who doesn't know a 912 from a bug.
 I smogged my 914 at a BP station in Sunnyvale (only $27, with certificate, but
not pass-or-don't-pay), and the tech obviously did not know Porsches well.  Not
only did he not give me any guff about not having a vacuum advance on the
distributor (removed for late 74 1.8L), but he listed it at a VW 1600cc engine,
and checked the box that said the carbs were OK, and the box that said "N/A" to
fuel injection!!  Not bad for a stock 1.8L 914!
Anyway, is the OEM muffler considered smog equipment?  You probably can get
away with just a muffler that fits & works (& looks old), as long as it still
has the catalytic converter.  The EGR would be more problematical.
However, as noted earlier, the 912E had a 914 2.0L engine in it, so you can try
the 914 places.  Two recommendations for new or used parts would be EASY up in
Emeryville, or High Price ...  I mean High Performance House in Redwood City. 
The latter specializes in 914s, and they have tons of 914 corpses lying about
for parts.  Good luck!

Subject: Movie for Porsche lovers ...

All the Porsche lovers should watch a movie "No Man's Land" starring Charlie
Sheen, among the others. The movie in itself is quite bad but you'll see more
911s (+ derivatives) than in any other movie ever made (IMHO). 

This might be old news - I just saw it last weekend for the first time.

The edges on the teeth are rounded more on the new version.
Remember you'll still have to change the crank sprocket.

Subject: 911 Carrera 3.2 or 944S2 ???


I am thinking of changing my car (85/2 944 Lux) and am looking for some
advice from the list on what to go for. The obvious choices seem to come
down to the 911 Carrera (3.2) or the 944S2 of about 1988ish vintage as I
need a car which is reliable and can be used as a daily driver above all.
It will only have road use and won't get driven *very* hard *very* often.

Has anyone on the list driven both these cars (or are there any magazine
comparison articles)? How do they compare?

Is the Carrera 3.2 the right 911 to go for? Would I be better off paying
less and getting an SC?

How many cars has Porsche called "Carerra"? How do people talk about them
(apart from the Carerra 3, Carerra 2 and Carerra 4!) - "Carerra 2.7",
"Carerra 3.2"?

Are the Sport or Super Sport worth considering? I understand the Carerra
Sport has revised suspension and tea-tray spoiler (which I actually like!)
and the Carerra Super Sport has the turbo body (which slows it down) and
brakes. Are there any other differences?

What comes standard on the Carerra 3.2 and what is an extra? Limited Slip
Differential? Alarm? Immobiliser? ABS? Sun roof? Leather?

When did the Carrera 3.2 get a hydraulic clutch and is it worth having?

What books can I read for more information on the 911 (I have already
ordered Bruce Anderson's book and it should arrive shortly)?

Is the 3.0 litre 944S2 *much* faster than the 2.5 litre 944? Does it have
much more low-end torque (which I think the 2.5 lacks)?

What other car (heresy!!) are worth considering? Jaguar XJ-S V12? Ford
Sierra Cosworth 4X4? BMW M5 or 535i?

Totally irrelevant to the above, but I have often heard mention of NACA
ducts on cars like the 924 Turbo. But what does the acronym NACA stand
for?!

Thanks in advance for any help (which I will happily summarise and send to
Stan for the FAQ).

Subject: (Partial) Porsche Bibliography


	Herein follows a (partial) Porsche bibliography. I would
appreciate any additions or ammendments to this list. In particular, there
are many places where I am missing information, represented by an "?" (as
well as authours where I only have an initial rather than a first name) and
I would like to fill in the gaps.

	The information for each book is :-

			Author
			Title
			Publisher
			ISBN

and they are sorted by author (I have the information in a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, so if anyone would like the list sorted by any other field,
please let me know).

	Please reply by e-mail to <Katz_P_M@bt-web.bt.co.uk> (rather than
to the list); once I have incorporated any changes I'll send it out again
(unless people don't want me to!?) and also to Stan for the archives.

	I have got these details from a number of sources, including a few
books which I own, lists from booksellers, the local public library
catalogue, etc., but I'm sure that there are some inaccuracies.

Speaking of Porsche Bibliographies, I read a few years ago about a

Does anyone know the title/author of this book and how I could obtain
a copy?

Subject: TV Grand prix coverage 

Yesterday was the Canadian GP and it wasn't on TV in NY, (Elsewhere?)  As
noted on porschephiles a few weeks ago, the Monaco GP also wasn't shown, and
this one used to be shown with great fanfare by ABC.

Is US popular interest in GPs down? For many years Car&Driver has has a
campaign to ridicule GPs as boring, dilletantish and generally useless.
Recently, Road&Track dropped their 'magazine of record' style of giving
an article to each GP, and has gone to a back-of-the-book brief description
of each race, which hardly gives any details and focusses on the politics, etc.
Do these format changes reflect a correct view of the US demographics of GP
interest?


So, what's it like out there? Opinions solicited.

The way things are going Americans will have to travel to see an F1

Autoweek and RACER magazine have pretty good F1 coverage.  At least with
Autoweek you don't have to wait a month.

Subject: '67 911S clutch problem


Help!  Any advice on the following would be greatly appreciated.

The clutch in my 67 911S has started slipping with only about 2000 or
2500 miles on it. 

Background: car was off the road for about 2 years while some rust repair
was done, and transmission rebuilt.  Engine was installed in car with new
clutch about 4 months before the car was finished and started.  The clutch
was hell to "break" the first time, since then has functioned normally but
has always felt a little weak.  The car has been driven hard (one solo event)
so far, but not so hard as to go through a clutch in a month and a half.
Details:  lots of adjustment room in the clutch, definitely no binding in 
the cable or fork.  Adjustment such that the clutch begins to engage very 
close to the floor, and is fully engaged an inch or so later, does not
reduce the slippage.  Slips a little going into 3,4 or 5 hard, and can be
slipped by flooring it in 4th or 5th in the powerband.

Parts: new flywheel, can't remember who I bought in from.  All bushings,
flywheel pilot bearing, throwout bearing, etc., replaced with new ones.
Clutch pressure plate and disc are the correct '67 S 'copper' clutch
pieces - I bought them from Vasek Polak when they were having a sale on
them ($150 for both) - was this a mistake?  Lastly, I'm fairly sure that
there is no oil getting on the parts as the crank seal behind the flywheel
was replaced and all the trans seals are new.  Also, there is no shuddering
at all, only nice smooth, weak, engagement.

I realize the '69S clutch (215mm) is stronger and can be used, and if I
have to buy a new pressure plate and disc then this is what I will buy.
Any ideas how I could avoid the $500 U.S. for these pieces?

Is it possible to install the clutch disc backwards (wrong side facing the
flywheel)??????  I do remember torquing the pressure plate correctly...

Thanks in advance

      suspect that the extra 27 Hp is helping him!  (At least I
      like to believe this!)

      My sc gets about 24 mpg on the freeway (at about 65-70 mph).

      My friend says that his 3.2 get 32 mpg on the freeway (he drive
      fast, but I don't have a number - suspect similar speeds).

      City mileage is similar at 15-18 mpg.

Is the Carrera 3.2 the right 911 to go for? Would I be better off paying
less and getting an SC?

      If I could do it over, I might have held out for a 3.2.  The
      'sc is a lot of bang for the buck.  Both have bullet-proof 
      engines, though the 3.2 has noticeablly better power to weight.

How many cars has Porsche called "Carerra"? How do people talk about them
(apart from the Carerra 3, Carerra 2 and Carerra 4!) - "Carerra 2.7",
"Carerra 3.2"?

      Once upon a time (when rear engined cars ruled the earth)
      Carerra ment something: usually more Hp., less weight, stiffer
      springs, fatter 'sway bars, no A/C, no cruise, no sunroof.
      Get the idea?

      Now, Carerra just means 911 (can you say "resting on your
      laurels and forgetting your roots?")

      [stuff deleted]
      
When did the Carrera 3.2 get a hydraulic clutch and is it worth having?

      The hydraulic clutch appeared with the G50 transmission.  The 
      clutch is (to me) much less of an issue than the **Highly 
      Desireable** G50.  Both appeared in '87.  Along with another
      10 Hp.  However, another friend has gone through the parts books
      and can't find *any* different components (if there was another
      10 Hp. out there, he wanted it too!), so it is unclear what's 
      going on.  They may just have rested the sucker and/or printed
      a higher number.

      [more stuff deleted]

Totally irrelevant to the above, but I have often heard mention of NACA
ducts on cars like the 924 Turbo. But what does the acronym NACA stand
for?!

      NACA: National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics

      In 1958, NACA became NASA and their charter was expanded to
      include space (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)

      Much (most?) subsonic airfoil data compiled in this country was 
      done by NACA.

      What it means in the duct context, is that an appropriate duct
      shape was used to minimize drag and maximize airflow.

By far the best magazine coverage of F1 races (and, I think, IndyCar,
NASCAR, F3000, F2000, FF1600, F2, F3...) is in OnTrack. This magazine
comes out twice a month, so AutoWeek always beats them to the scoop,

There is no substitute for the factory manual. The Haynes aftermarket
manual is so much better than all the other non-factory manuals it's not
even funny. The factory manual will set you back between $300 and $400,
but it is worth it.

When you get the factory manual, just order the right owner's manual. 
Should be about $30 or so.

As to *WHERE* to get these, any of the major aftermarket suppliers have 
these items. Just grab a copy of Excellence or Pano and start calling.

 914 1.8L F.I.
Hello again, fellow PorschePhiles!
    It's coming time to (attempt to) deal with some minor but annoying fuel
system problems in my 1.8L 914.  The symptoms are twofold:  It takes about 2.5
 - 3 minutes for the car to idle at the correct RPM.  I must keep the
accelerator slightly depressed to keep the car from shuddering and sometimes
dying.  The second part is, if I drive the car during this three minute period,
it backfires occasionally when decelerating (too rich?).  If I get it warmed up
and then turn it off for more than about three minutes(?), I have to let it
idle for three before it runs correctly again.
    It sounds like something in the control system/brain.  Unfortunately that
means all the vaccuum hoses, the brain box, etc, etc, etc....  Has anyone else
dealt with this?  Is there something in there that works on a three-minute
timer?
    Any advice appreciated.

Except for, of course, Autosport.  Autosport is weekly, has much better
photos, more in-depth F1 coverage than OnTrack -- and Nigel Roebuck's
wonderful columns (Forrest Bond is good, but he's no Nigel Roebuck).  They
also have extensive coverage of F3, F3000, WRC and other European racing
series, but not so much NASCAR (or other non-Indycar U.S. series).

The downside is the cost -- I think US subscriptions currently run about
$125/year from Eric Waiter Associates, and more if you order direct from
England.

Dave,

I had a similar problem with my 1.8.  It turned out to be leaky injectors.  They
would continue to drip into the cylinder after the car had been shut off.  When
I started the car after it had been sitting, it would spew black smoke from the
exhaust and wouldn't idle until the extra fuel had been used.  There is a drip
test spec but I don't remember what it is.  Maybe someone else can help?

There is NO comparison between the plain 944 and the S2.  The S2 has gobs of

ready to blast off.  It also remains the smooth sweet car that the regular 944
is.

Sounds like two things: idle problem (cold) is usually due to a defective
aux air regulator. Check to make sure that it's open cold and closes warm
If it's not open cold (or not open all the way, even) then you'll have bad
cold idle. If if doesn't close, you'll have other problems.

Second: the backfire may be a result of a defunct decelleration valve. That's
the little gizmo with three vaccum hoses going to it off on the battery
side of the engine compartment that I mistakenly identified as your fuel
pressure regulator a couple of weeks ago (set-mode item-on-face egg). It
keeps you from getting an instantaneous manifold pressure transition when
you go from mostly open throttle to closed throttle, to prevent just the
backfire you're seeing.

The aux air regulator heater element, which is why I suspect it. Well, 3-5 
minute anyway. If it's bad for a short time, then good, the cold phase
is probably crocked.

Subject: 911T valve adjustments


In my quest to get my MFI system running correctly on '72 911T, I needed to
make sure my valves were adjusted right first.  Judging by appearances
of the rocker arms and clearances, this task was not done regularly
on my engine (@87K -- it had cork gaskets). The awkward angle makes 
this process quite a challenge compared to my experiences with VW 
rocker arms.  I bent my feeler guage to accomodate the angle of attack. 
I have all the pertinent manuals but they are lean on technique. 
I have been opening the adjustment screw enough to get the blade in, 
then tightening down to the clearance.  It seemed impossible to just 
insert the blade first to check the existing clearance (hmmm- extremely
tight valves or wrong technique?).

Anyone have any other insight or tips to speed up the process? 

I recognize there is a learning curve of how to do it, of course, but 
there has to be some net wisdom that I can draw upon.  I did four cylinders 
in 2.5 hours! The last cylinder only took 15 minutes --yes I know there are two more to go ;-}

Is this a task most of older 911 owners pay someone else to do or is it an 
obligation that has to be met by only the owner-- similar to devout vw
air-cooled lovers?

I used to do my own valve adjustments on 914 2.0 as well but that is another
story.

here but if that's not in place, you (or your wife) may be loading up
the clutch fork by pressing the pedal beyond its intended range.

It has been a while since I had the 72 transmission down, but I don't
remember the throwout lever on the 1972 stock type 915 transmission having
a ball pivot on the throwout lever.

The 915 transmission that was stock on the 72T had sleeve bearings as
I recall and is a hardy assembly.

I'm guessing but perhaps a previous owner installed a type 901 (1965-69) or
type 911 (1970-71) transmission in the car?   

The 911 type tranmission and it had a unique way of using the clutch cable
sheath to move the throwout bearing fork.  This is the only 911 series that
had the clutch cable end attached to the engine case, pressing the clutch 
pedal caused the free end of the cable sheath to move to the rear of the car
moving the clutch release bearing fork of the pull type clutch.

If your 72 has been converted to the 1970/1971 configuration, you have
to make sure the cable sheath is properly guided by a sheetmetal
guide assembly on the side of the transmission.  This was the only
transmission that required this adjustment.

Are all the parts consistent with the 1970/71 transmission?  This
might be a source of problems. 

As I remember, the following parts are unique to the 70/71 transmissions

  1. throwout bearing fork
  2. clutch cable
  3. plastic actuating piece on the clutch cable
  4. clutch cable sheath
  5. throwout bearing
  6. cable sheath guide assembly.

Subject: 911T valve adjustments


   Anyone have any other insight or tips to speed up the process? 

Here are a few tips that work for me in adjusting 911 valves:

1. Remove the plugs to make the crank turn easily.
2. Get the engine to top dead center, compression stroke on
	cylinder #1 and then do the valves in order 1,6,2,4,3,5
	by rotating 1/3 turn on the crankshaft each time. Do
	both intake and exhaust at the same time. Rotate clockwise.
3. Get the special feeler gauge holder and the little replaceable
	feeler blades, the tool is angled properly for the 911
	engine and the blade is short so it doesn't flex as much.
4. Don't loosen valves first. Insert the tool using the edge of
	the blade to get under the swivel foot (takes practise).
	Loosening the valves takes too much time and is unnecessary.
5. Remove everything in the way first, like catalytic converter
	or A/C compressor. The time you spend trying to reach
	around these things is often less then just removing it.

Bill,

     My experience agrees with yours, both in time and in the
difficulty of fiddling the feeler into place.  There is a feeler
handle with a replaceable piece of shim stock which makes it a
LITTLE easier.  Even then SOMETIMES I just can't get it into
place without backing the adjustment way off.

     I'll be interested to hear comments from the old hands.

However, I will continue to run Redline products in my radiator,
transmission, differential and power steering system.

First, this article is going to be posted on a few mailing lists.  I
doubt that any of those lists include in their charter "for the
purpose of discussing oil, Slick 50, etc."  If you have a point to
make in response to this, please consider that the oil debate rages
365 days a year in rec.autos and that most of the list members
probably don't want to hear your opinion unless you're an engine
builder, engineer or something comparable.  Unless you have some cold
hard facts or experience that includes an actual engine teardown, most
of the readers do _not_ want to read about it.  I also don't want to
get a surprise and see this pop up in some publication or newsletter,
so let's: Copyright 1993 Brian Kelley :-) Contact me if you want to
publish it.


Disclaimer, background

I'm not a fuels and lubes engineer.  I don't speak for my employer.
Our source was a lab report and a fuels and lubes engineer.  He does
this stuff for a living.  He won't put Redline in his race engine.  In
fact, I get the strong impression that you'd have to pay him to run
Redline.  His concern is for the camshaft.


The test cars

Two modified late model Mustangs.  These cars run open track events,
solo II and hard street driving.  Engine modifications include 80mm
MAFs, large throttle bodies, GT40 upper and lower intakes, ported
factory heads, B303 cam and full length headers.  The cars weigh about
the same and the drivers use the same shift points (6,000 RPM).  They
both run the same Earl's oil cooler with the same type of
installation.  The cars always run at the same events.

If you run a late model Mustang, you'll have to run pretty hard to
beat up your oil more than these guys do.  Their cars make power well
above 5,200 and they spend a fair amount of time there.

History

The cars both received an oil change at the beginning of the season.
Ken ran the new formula Mobil 1 in 10W30.  Rob ran Redline 5W30.  Open
track events included two hot days at Waterford road course and 2 hot
days at Gratten road course.  They also ran two Solo II's and hard
street driving.  Total mileage for the season was 6,000 miles (on both
cars).  The cars were garaged in the fall and the oil samples were
collected near the end of Winter.

Results

Redline did not outperform Mobil 1.  Both of the oils performed just
_fine_ for 6,000 miles of street and track abuse.  Unfortunately, for
test purposes, neither oil significantly gave up the ghost.  Both oils
were in excellent shape when tested.  The actual numbers for Mobil 1
at first glance look much better than those for Redline.  However, it
must be emphasized that both of the samples are in excellent
condition.  The numbers are so low (which is good) that if another
sample was taken the results could be reversed - the numbers for
Redline could be better.

Note that the results for the Redline oil showed a higher amount of
Silicon, and that makes sense, according to the engineer we consulted.
Rob had recently replaced his intake.  The higher Silicon content in
his oil is the result of the Silicone based RTV used to seal the
manifold.  Pretty neat, eh?

Note that the viscosity for the Redline is slightly better.  Higher
reving engines will tend to reduce the viscosity more.  Since we
didn't really damage either of these lubes (too bad :-) I really
wonder how the results would have been after a 24 hour endurance race.

[ The actual text from the engineer follows. Note he road races a

- --------

The verdict is in - Redline does not outperform Mobil 1 in 5.0L
Mustangs of Rob and Ken! Additive treatments of the 2 oils look normal
with presence of Na, Mg, Ca, P, Zn, Si, and Mo. The viscosities of the
2 oils are also normal with both oils remaining in grade. (These guys
must have not stressed the oil too much in the Mustangs-I would
suggest the next test take place in a HIGH PERFORMANCE FIESTA!) Fe,
Cr, Pb, Cu, and Sn wear metals are lower with Mobil 1 than with
Redline. However, the Redline wear metals look typical for most oils
while the Mobil 1 is very low. Examples: Fe 22 ppm vs.  84 ppm for
Redline: Cr 4 ppm vs 43 ppm for Redline and Pb 6 ppm vs 62 ppm for
Redline (could come from leaded fuel???)  [ No. Neither driver runs
leaded additives or gas. ]

Anyway, either of these oils would allow an engine a long and painless
life. This is true even of mineral oils when changed frequently (3000
miles???). These guys changed the oil at 6000 miles.  So finally, the
verdict is really that each of these oils protect their engines
adequately.  The only choice left is which one will you use?  If it's
based on economics, probably the mineral oil with 3000 mile changes.
If you really love your baby, the Mobil 1 at $3 or the Redline at $7
for 6000 miles will do.  

Thanks,
- ----------

Oil Change Intervals

The Mobil 1 from Ken's Explorer was also tested.  He changes the oil
every 8,000 miles.  The oil was excellent and he will continue that
oil change interval.  Another friend has used 10,000 mile oil change
intervals with Mobil 1 with excellent success.  The first vehicle was
an '83 Mustang 5.0.  At 110,000 miles the engine was torn down for a
hi-po rebuild.  The engine was in fine shape and would have gone many
more miles on the street.  He uses the same oil change interval in his
'88 5.0 Mustang.

Subject: Re: 911T valve adjustments

Bob,
	In my experience, I find that the metal handle on the purpose
	made feeler gauge holder is way too heavy to be convenient, as
	are feeler gauge assemblies. I also find that the long ribbon
	feeler gauges are to flimsy to push under the swivel foot.
	I have fabricated a lightweight feeler gauge holder from a wooden
	pencil and a short (1/2") piece cut from a feeler gauge ribbon.

		1. Remove the eraser from the metal ferrule on the pencil. 
		2. Flatten the ferrule. 
		3. Carefully break the ferrule open at the tight bends. 
		4. Bend to appropriate angle.
		5. Insert the feeler gauge after slightly roughening 
		   the broken end. 
		6. Epoxy in place. 
		7. Cut the pencil length to suit your usage.
  
	Voila a lightweight feeler gauge holder.

	Now, when I adjust the valves, the oil film between the swivel
	foot and the feeler tend to hold it in place while I use my other 
	two hands to hold the screw driver and the offset box wrench while
	tweeking in the final valve lash adjustmnet.
	Still, I do have problems in pushing the feeler into the "gap" 
	between the valve stem, and swivel foot, but with my "third hand"
	it takes little effort to open the gap and insert the feeler, and
	reajust the valve.
	I prefer to measure the lash prior to adjusting, to get an idea of
	the wear the engine may be experiencing, but usually succumb to 
	openning the gap if I fail to get insertion in 2 or 3 tries.

	As a point of interest, I've used Mobil 1 15W-50 from 8,000 miles
	and now have 84,000 on my '87 Carrera and usually find that the 
	valves need little or no adjustment. But, I do it any way! What 
	other excuse could a sane man use to justify laying under his 
	automobile for half a day?

Subject: A question about cam identification

a question for all you porschephiles

Well here I am putting hydraulic tensioners on my 1976 911s and I find that 
the old non-hydraulic tensioners are loose.  big suprise there right.

So now I am going to do a little cam timing, just to be sure.  The only strange
thing is that I expected to find punch marks on the end of the cam shaft to 
do the initial setting.  Well there wern't any.  So now I am wondering if these
are the original cams or not.

So my question is does any one out there have a part identification guide for
this year 911?  The only visable number on the cams is on the end of the shaft
and is as follows:

			911 14400

Does anyone recognise this number at all?  Thats the right cam, I have not
taken off the left side cover yet...

I have the cam timing specs for the factory cams I was just wondering if this 
is a factory cam.  I recently bought the car so I don't have the life story.
Also I was under the impression that the original cams had punch marks for the
initial settings from which you would do the fine tuning with the dial guage.

Thanks for any and all replies.

Subject: 924 Cooling System


Hi,

I have recently been having some problems with the cooling system on 
my '82 924.

After driving for 1/4 hour or longer the temperature steadily rises to
about 1/2 on the scale (the normal position was 1/4 on the scale). It
then stays here varying slightly until I stop the engine. A minute or so
after stopping the engine, a lot (approx. 1 litre) of water is forced
out of the pressure release value (in the radiator expansion cap) onto
the floor (after switching the engine off, the gauge reaches about 3/4
when the water is released).

   o The cooling system isn't leaking.
   o I have flushed the radiator and replaced the thermostat.
   o Thermo switch is okay.

After suspecting a problem with the cooling system .... and not finding
anything obvious, the next thing I checked was the compression.

I ran the car until normal temperature was reached, and found the compression
was quite good -

    Cylinder pressures : Lowest 10.8 Bar, Highest 12.0 Bar.

So, I guess the head gasket is okay ?

Is the problem a leaking head gasket, with a very small leak or does it
sound like something else ?

Thanks,

Richard.

I've seen inexpensive halogen bulbs for use in signal lamps.  Try 
Automotion & Imparts.

The brighter-bulb solution might not be necessary though.  As 
reflectors age, they corrode, and the lense gets "micro-pitted".  
Replacing the reflector & maybe the lense might restore them to proper 
condition.

Also, standard non-halogen bulbs darken through time as the filament 
molecules deposit on the glass.  A new bulb of the same type may 
improve the situation - cheap and fast!

Subject: RE: 944S2 extinguisher

I've got mine mounted on the vertical panel in the rear footwell, 
behind the front passenger's seat.  I can reach the extinguisher from 
the driver's seat, and it's fully supported mechanically - no bracket 
fatigue problem.  HOWEVER, this location required drilling the chassis 
and nearly hitting some gas lines on the backside, just forward of the 
rear spring tube.

I think the best idea is to get angle iron (or aluminum) and fashion a 
simple bracket.  Mount the bracket under the leading edge of the front 
seat brackets (i.e., under your knees).  Use the seat's original 
mounting bolts.

This solution is great except it limits seat travel forward.  If you 
want unhindered seat motion, drill the seat rail and fasten it there.

Helmets: the Snell 80/85/90 issue depends on what your local group 
regulations are - there's no PCA National policy except at the Parade, 
where it's Snell '80.  In Boston, we require '85.  From my experience, 
nearly all regions near us require '85 at this time, but the day of the 
'90 is approaching.

Sounds like your head gasket is in the process of failing.  You won't 
see any problem with compression until it gets quite significant, 
however.  I've had these same symptoms twice; in each case the head 
gasket was failing, with a fine crack between the water jacket and a cylinder.

Argh, not another oil question.  I wonder where all these odd people are
who recommend single-weight, non-detergent oils.  I never meet them.
Maybe they lurk out there, waiting to prey on new owners of Porsches...

The latest official poop from Porsche is in the tech bulletin book I,
group 1, number 9207, dated 17 April 1992.  It covers oils they have
"tested and found to contribute less to caron build up."  It endorses
the use of single-weight, multi-weight mineral oils, and synthetic oils,
each within an appropriate range of ambient temperatures.

Personally, I would stick with a multi-grade or synthetic.  They have
lots of advantages over single-grade oils, and no disadvantages (except,
with the synthetics, cost).

I really dislike this set-up because of its inaccessibility.  Yes, you
can get to it fine when you are sitting in your driveway.  But if you
have had an "incident", suspended upside down in a flipped car, dazed,
in shock, and maybe there's something you really need to use the
extinguisher on, I think you might have a problem getting to it.  Bottom
line: if you're going to put in the car, put it where it will do the
best good for you.

If you do put it between the bottom seat rail and the floor, put washers
or spacers to match on the rear allen bolts as well.  You want to load
the bolts' fillets evenly, not to mention the all-to-easy risk of cross-
threading them (lots of people have done this).

I have a moves-with-the-seat, top-rail set-up, which is probably the
nicest one to have.  I can US-mail plans which appeared in a newsletter
article; let me know.

Remember common sense: if you've been in a serious accident (car 
inverted) and can't think clearly, you should just get away from the 
car and lay down.  Or maybe just stay put until help arrives.  A 2.5 lb 
extinguisher doesn't do much good in those circumstances anyway, so 
there's little to be gained and much to be lost in trying to use it.

I've had this in the past too.  I believe it's excess water in the oil,

Subject: 944S2 fire  extinguisher and helmets

Michael Todd has just bought one of these and asks 2 things:

1	Where to mount the extinguisher for track events?  I have done 2
	things.  Initially I did this:  I drilled holes in the floor behind
	the passenger seat.  I then bolted the mounting bracket to the floor.
	Get bolts about 1.5" long, which is enough for them to protrude down
	through the floorboard, and you bolt them in place from underneath the
	car.  This method is good, but since my child rides in the back, I had
	to remove the thing after each event and re-install it next time.
	This took about 15 minutes each time and got to be a pain.

	I later bought a bar which extends accross the car.  This bar mounts
	at the rear seatbelt pivot point.  My main reason for the bar was as
	part of my 5-point harness system, but I also use it for the
	extinguisher:  I had bolts welded onto the bar, and mounted the
	extinguisher bracket onto these bolts.  Now, the extinguisher is more
	accessable, and I have no extra labor getting under the car, etc for
	each track event. {Michael: Contact me off-line of yu want more info
	about the bar.}


2	Helmet.  My region of PCA, NNJR, (and I think this is true for all
	regions) does not yet require a 90 Snell rating.  They will require
	this after the 94 season.  Everyone knows the joke, '$5 head, $5
	helmet', right?  I got a 90 helmet 2 months ago, figuring that if I'll
	need one after next year, I might as well get it now.

A leak of what? Coolant?
I'd have to guess moisture - 
fuel mixes pretty well with oil,
and that's the only thing I can think of
that would leak into a 911 engine's oil.

If you are interested in appearance related stuff, and cars only up to

the best option. If you are interested in performance and mechanical

Actually, in terms of the single-viscosity/multiple-viscosity issue,
the culprit is the Porsche factory itself, at least in terms of
recommendations for older cars made back when those cars were new
or near new. In the early to mid-70's, the factory line was that only
single viscosity oils were acceptable. They claimed to have tested
the multiple viscosity oils available at that time, and said that
the viscosity improvers used to provide the viscosity range broke
down under the conditions found in air cooled Porsche (is that redundant?
it was at the time- some will say it still is) motors. If I recollect,
Porsche would not honor the warranty if the car had used multi-viscosity
oil. Of course, multi-viscosity oils have improved greatly since then,
and the factory now recommends them not only for new models but for the
older models as well. However, more casual owners have probably passed
down the "old factory word" from owner to owner, rather than re-checking
with the dealer.

I have never heard the "non-detergent" arguement applied to Porsches,
certainly not from the factory. The typical arguement there, frequently
applied to very old British cars, was that if the car had used a
non-detergent oil for all of its early life, it should continue to
be used, since the detergent would wash so much crud out that it
might clog filters and screens in the oil system. I don't know if
the arguement on this point had any validity (I put detergent oil in
my old British cars).

I agree. I would not even consider a single weight oil. Use a good brand
(how is that as a good way to start a lively discussion) of multi-
viscosity oil, and change it regularly. If you don't mind spending
extra money or if you drive a Porsche model with known lubrication
shortcomings (e.g. 944 series and their #2 rod bearing), consider a
synthetic.

Remember common sense: if you've been in a serious accident (car 
inverted) and can't think clearly, you should just get away from the 
car and lay down.  Or maybe just stay put until help arrives.  A 2.5 lb 
extinguisher doesn't do much good in those circumstances anyway, so 
there's little to be gained and much to be lost in trying to use it.

      Perhaps I'm just a bit dim today, but I think you have the sign
      backwards.  As I see it, if you are hanging upside down in a 
      car, I see LITTLE to be LOST and MUCH to be GAINED from pulling
      the fire bottle.  Of course I'm comparing MY life against $50
      worth of halon.  Perhaps you have something else in mind here?

      If a 2.5 # extinguisher doesn't do much good in "those 
      circumstances," just where do you expect it to do some good?  
      (and, therefore why is it in the car at all?).  If it buys
      you 10 seconds in a fire (rare as they are), that could make 
      all the difference.

      Oh yeah, I guess I am assuming that there is a reason to pull
      the sucker, like smoke or fire.  A fire extinguisher isn't
      **ANY** good for much else.

      I suppose if you have 2.5 # of dry chemical, no smoke, no fire,
      halon armed course workers within 20 feet, then yes, just sit 
      tight.  Otherwise...

      We had a car go off course (backwards) into the weeds at an 
      autox a few weeks ago.  The weeds under the heat exchangers
      started smoking and everyone got pretty excited; it would
      have been an easy time to spray a pretty nice 911 with every-
      thing in sight.  The weeds just smoked, no fire.  We got the 
      dry chemical extinguishers seperated from the halon so we
      would be sure to use the halon first but didn't use either.

Hmmmm. Geeze, I guess I'll stick my head up on this one again... OK, on
the *NEW* generation cars (2.7 and up 911s, all water-pumpers) I use only
multi-vis oils. Usually Valvoline 20W50 Racing, since we have a deal with
them. 

*HOWEVER* on the *OLD* generation cars (all 356, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 914)
I use single grade. PERIOD. Even the race cars. And when I do use synthetics
from time to time in these guys, I use Amsoil SAE-40 Racing.

My reasoning is pretty straightforward: sure, the oils have gotten a *LOT*
better. *BUT NO ONE WENT BACK AND CHANGED THE ENGINEERING*!!! The engine
was designed to have certain lubrication characteristics from a certain
weight of oil (corrected for ambient temp) pumped at a certain rate under
a certain load and engine temp. So, while I'll grant you that the oils may 
be better, can you assure me that those operating characteristics will be
met by them??? A case of the oil of your choice to the first person to
actually convince me... 8{)

Come on people, we're not talking about a Big Deal here. The major problem
with single grade oils is that you have to change them as the weather changes.
OK, at what, $0.80 a quart that's a *MAJOR* investment... Plus, if you're
not changing the oil that frequently anyway, you're just asking for major
problems anyway.

See above. Then again, I seem to recall that neither of the people who started
this own anything in the "old" engine series. When you have to worry about 
stuff like $2k cranks for your 356SC (which could go NLA at any time), 
or your $1k set of Carrillo rods, you think might think about this stuff
differently...

The rear shoulder belt mounts are ready to go, you just need to locate 
the European belts and bolt them in with correct hardware.  Shouldn't 
be too hard.

Later American 944s had inertial reels, I think.  These require 
different rear trim panels and different mounting.  This could be a bit 
more work.

Friends of mine with babies report that there's basically only 1 model 
that fits in a 944 rear seat (circa 1987 information).  Sorry, I'm not

Perhaps I left too much to be inferred from my message?  The point I'm 
making about car fires in club competition or speed events is complex.

First, most of us are amateurs.  We're not expecting an accident or 
possible resulting fire.  Asking an untrained, surprised, 
adrenalin-rushed individual to do something smart while other cars are 
whizzing by (on the track, until the red flag comes out) often fails.  
Panic is the common thing.

Fire is fortunately extrememly rare in maintained street cars at our 
events.  But when it happens, there's a good chance it'll come from 
gasoline & heat, or, as you pointed out, grass & heat.  A 10 second 
extinguisher squirt may dim the flame, but as long as the heat remains 
(and it will) and the gas still leaks (or the grass remains planted 
under the car), all elements to start a fire remain.

Temporary measures to extinguish the blaze are useful during passenger 
extracation but do little afterwards.  Continuous cooling is required 
to prevent a re-flame.  These fires aren't like candles, where you blow 
them out and that's that.  A brake fluid & rotor fire may be different, 
but I'm examining fueled fires with larger sources.

As for "why is it in the car at all?", the fire extinguisher's there 
because you put it there to conform to a regulation that was probably 
created because "it seemed like a good idea", not because anyone ever 
researched the problem, historic incident levels, or applied any other 
form of study or engineering.

Usually, uninformed region / Zone Boards of Directors just "jump on the 
bandwagon" and make the rule requiring a fire extinguisher.  If real 
race cars have extinguishers, then it must be a good idea, right?  
Wrong!  It's pretty simple to compare what genuine race cars do vs. 
what PCA'ers do on the track. The same logic dictates that we wear 
Nomex, balaclava's, and install fuel cells, which we do not do.  
Genuine, in-depth studies often reveal that the real reasons behind our 
notions are unknown to us.

As a result of several people in our region noticing the above aspects, 
we've rescinded our extinguisher requirement as of 1993 in the 
Northeast Region.  We originally made the requirement a few years back 
for no known reason.  Actually, the reason was as I stated above: 
uninformed people making judgements outside their area of expertise 
and/or knowledge.

Big fires can't be helped by little fire bottles.  Yes, I'm aware that 
smaller / marginal fires can be squelched.  I believe that on-board 
extinguishers are really a good idea *in the event of this circumstance 
only * (small fires).  Broken high-pressure fuel lines (944 recall 
campaign), or stopping on dry grass are a different story.

An entirely different argument relates to the circumstance where fires 
begin: accidents.  Some accidents are serious, some aren't.  For 
accidents that cause enough damage to break apart the vehicle's systems 
and start a fire, you may also have bodily injury to the occupants.  
Will a dazed driver think clearly enough to unhook and use the 
extinguisher properly?  Will they stay off the track as they use it?  
Will the fire spread and get on them if they're covered with fuel?  Do 
you want to suggest that they try to fight the fire with their 10 
second squirt, only to endanger themselves?  This is really complicated 
as these few issues reveal.

We've bottom-lined it: number one priority in any circumstance is to 
protect people.  This means: don't stay near a car fire, don't stay 
near the track & other cars which may contain startled drivers, etc.  
An autocross course is much more managable of course, and should be 
dealt with differently.  But rule #1 is to get away from danger, not 
stay with it.  Insurance can replace the car, but not the human.

If I have 10 seconds "to buy" in such a circumstance, I'll spend it on 
getting away from the incident safely, not unlatching and deploying a 
fire extinguisher.  I do carrying a 2.5 lb. charge halon bottle in my 
car, but don't plan on using it if I get into a serious accident.

There's another risk area to carrying a fire extinguisher - it can 
become a projectile during an accident.  We've had many problems over 
the years with bad installations that render the extinguisher unsafe.  
Lots of car owners (& mechanics) don't understand accidents and the 
sudden pulse-loading of force on all bolts, screws, or whatever.  We've 
had plastic brackets which would snap on the first good bump!  I 
believe this is a more *real* danger than the remote possibility of 
fire.  Best bet: get a permanently installed system with a big red 
discharge button and nozzles on the driver & engine, like the pro's.

In the above, I'm coming from a position of what I'd describe as larger 
incidents or fires.  Certainly, I agree that little fires do 
occasionally happen and that the difference between driving home in 
your car and seeing it burn up might be a 2.5 lb. fire extinguisher.  
But there are many, many other factors to consider as I think I've shown.

Actually, an extinguisher won't help smoke.  And smoke is what usually 
kills people in house fires, not flames (cars may be different).  You'd 
have to get right onto the ignition source with the extinguisher to 
stop smoke generation, but even then smoke continues to linger.  This 
is a strong danger.

I'm glad your group stayed cool enough to think this one out.  If a 
fire had started, would the 2.5 lb. bottle inside the car have been 
enough to put the fire out and keep it out?  Would it have contributed 
significantly to anyone's safety?  That's my point!

Subject: Dangers of Fire Extinguishers...


Apropos Fire Extinguishers and the protection they offer I submit the 
following true story from about three months ago, as presented to my 
non-Porsche-driving friends. They told me I was an idiot (which is probably
not inaccurate, given the circumstances...)

For reference purposes only, my car's a '73 914 2.0.

			SAMUEL'S BIG ADVENTURE

The Scene: Friday Afternoon, 5:30 PM, Imperial Highway 3/4 mile from the
Pacific Ocean. It is warm and clear, with the orange sun just getting ready to 
start plunging into the Santa Monica Bay.

I was driving home the scenic route, getting ready for the weekend. I had 
both windows down, and loud music playing (Jah Wobble's "Rising Above 
Bedlam").

About 3/4 mile from the ocean, there's a stop light on Imperial, shortly 
after which the road narrows from three lanes down to two. Naturally,
there's always some good-natured jockeying for position among the drivers 
when starting off after a red light.

So there I was, at the red light. To the right, a guy wearing mirrored
sunglasses sat in his big growling street-racer Mustang. To the left, a
sneering suit-and-tie in a very shiny Lexus. Naturally, I saw that my manifest 
destiny staring me in the face -- It was imperative that I not allow BOTH 
of these individuals to sneak into my lane ahead of me. After all, is it not 
true that Open Road is the only True Path of Glory? Is it not said that life
begins at 4500 RPM? My mission was clear.

As the light changed to green, my foot shoved the pedal to the floor. The 
tachometer lunged as the black smoke of dinosaurs past spewed heavily from 
my exhaust.

By the time I hit third gear, I sensed that my competitors were no mere 
mortals -- to the left, the Lexus had lost less than a foot to my 
acceleration, while on my right the Mustang was inching forwards, eating at 
my narrow lead. Gritting my teeth, I held it in third until 5000 RPM, 
powershifting into fourth.

At our current speeds, someone would have to yield before I hit fifth gear. 
I heard louder growling from my right, and the Mustang crawled forward, 
gaining a half-length lead. I quickly realized it was now just me against the 
Lexus for the remaining lane.

The road was narrowing, the grasses along the shoulder whipping about in the 
furious wind. Feral snarls distorting our faces, we vied back and forth for 
that elusive strip of pavement. And then Great Exaltation for the People! The 
Lexus hesitated, allowing me to spring gloriously into the lead! Destiny had 
been served out, and the Gods of the Highway had smiled upon me.

But then, quite suddenly, I was shocked into seriousness. From behind me, I 
heard a muffled report and felt a reaction through the seat. It had sure 
sounded like a gun. Had my car just been shot?? I had thought that this was
just another friendly race, a good-natured sparring for position.
Something was certainly wrong -- I heard hissing noises behind me, and an
acrid smell filled the air.

I tried to look into my rear-view mirror to see what was going on, but the 
car's cockpit was quickly filling with white choking fumes. All I could see 
in the rear-view mirror were twin plumes of smoke pouring from my windows!

Braking sharply into the now-empty lane behind the Mustang, I began to pull 
off the road. The Lexus flew by with a roar. As soon as my car had stopped 
moving, I dove out of the door, and was horrified to see the huge white 
clouds boiling out of the windows and open door. It looked like it had taken
a fire-bomb. Hoping to try to save some of the car, I reached in the door
for the fire-exstinguisher that I keep behind the seat.

And there, I saw the problem. Evidently, the extinguisher had worked its 
way out of its harness. The initial acceleration had held it against the
frame of the car, but when the acceleration had begun to lessen (and with 
the side-to-side swerving for the lane), it had fallen sideways, shearing
off the nozzle on the seat-belt bolt, and liberating the compressed 
chemicals inside. As I watched, it spewed out its last few puffs of vapor 
and then was still.

MORAL: Lexus drivers are evil and dangerous psychotics and should be kept 
off the streets at all cost.

Just do a normal oil change, but hang a sprig of rosemary or mugwort around
the filler neck for the first 500 miles to ward off evil spirits.  And
don't wait another 80,000 miles again before changing the oil.

I would hope that you don't have to pull the instrument.  To my experience,
the bulbs push into from behind and friction-fit the VDO gauges.  (Alas,
I have a print of the '77 Euro 928 fiche, but it does not call out the
bulbs for the console.)

So I would go hunting under the dash, which may be a major act of
contortion.  See if you can pull out the current bulb.

The parts are certainly available, as Jim points out.  In fact, three-point
rear belts appeared on the 944S2.  Unfortunately, in addition to the
expense of just the belts, installing them also requires replacing a
bunch of interior trim, and done right, would probably add up.  If I
remember correctly, part of the problem is routing the shoulder belt
properly.

I might suggest that since so few 944 owners actually use their rear
seats, you might be able to strike a deal with someone who has a car
with the newer, three-point setup.  If not an outright sale, perhaps a
friend might be willing to swap parts with you for the duration.

>Also, has anyone found a good child seat that fits well in the rear seat
>of the 944?

There is a very nice-looking one on Porsche's 944 microfiche. 
Unfortunately, there is no part number called out for it because they do not
make it available in the US.  When I called Reno about a suitable seat a few
years ago, they recommended the Century 2000-STE model.  We got one, and
while it is a very good car seat, it does not fit in the back of my car.

What Gary and Michelle Carr did, local 911 friends, is get a car seat and
remove some of its tubular frame so that it nestles quite well into their
car's rear seat.  If I am not mistaken, current child seats no longer use a
tubular outer frame for obscure safety reasons.  They're all molded plastic,
the benefit of which is that there is less/no chance for a child to catch a
finger on the frame.  This being the case, removing part of the frame to get
the seat to fit may no longer be possible.

(Looking over a '89 Century catalog, it looks like all that year's models
had a rear "leveller" bar which, if removed, I would guess would allow the
seat to fit.  Maybe the current models do too; I dunno.)

If you do find a good kiddie seat, please let me know.  I hear this question
asked a lot, being a local guy who a) has kids, b) admits to the
fact, and c) drives them and the car around all year.  I will confess to
having put the two-year-old in the five-point racing harness in a pinch.  It
holds him in very well, and he hasn't the strength to operate the cam lock.

Whenever I hear this line (If you've got etc.), I'm tempted to ask:
"So do you have a $200 head or a $500 head?"

2.  I saw an ad for Automobile Atlanta's Club 924.  Has anyone
on the list joined this? Is it worthwhile? Most of the drivetrain
information would be useless to me (924S), but tire/wheel/suspension
tips and, of course, 924S-specific topics would be of interest.

3.  I had the car in for 'Major Service' (45K) this week, and they
offered me the 'Induction System Clean-Up Service' by BG Products.
It appears that they pump in some detergents to clean up the fuel
and air systems and valves.  The implication is that even if the car
has no identifiable problems, this treatment will restore some
performance lost to deposits.  I didn't have it done, but I'm curious
as to whether anyone has tried it, and whether it's effective for
either diagnosed problems or as a general tonic.

Stan,

I think Porsche was pretty cavalier about engineering mods to the oil system themselves.  My 2.2T motor is a pre-piston squirter version but to update all I would have to do is tap the webbing and pick up the oil gallery that runs inside it like the factory did.  The 3.2 Carrera tensioners are another example - I think they will retrofit back to everything after the center oiled cams.  Porsche endorses this upgrade but I doubt they went back and checked to see what effect the tap into the cam oil lines would have on cam bearing lubrication in early cars.

I used to run Valvoline Turbo V 20W50 but when I started to do driver's ed events and seeing temperatures of 260+ (no oil cooler) I became a bit concerned.  Since switching to Mobil 1 I can run a 40+ minute session on the short course at Sebring and not exceed 250.  The synthetic also seems to cool faster as I'm usually down to about 225 after a one cool down lap and a circuit of the infield.  I still change my oil after every other event just to be on the safe side as I remember one of the discussion topics from the '89 War Bonnet Tech was the breakdown in oil additive packages at 250+.

The only downside I see to the synthetics in older motors is that they tend to seep quite a bit with the older seals.  This results in a few spots on my garage floor from my 23 year/135,000 mile old motor (top end at 110K but only pulled the heads) but that's what baking pans are for.  :-) 

Steve

P.S> I'll take a case of Mobil 1 :-)

Subject: 944 and kids

Hi 

As a mother of two kids who has as primary transportation a
84 944, the car seat issue has been a four year long problem.
One daughter, as of yesterday, is 'legal', but her sister is
not.  I tried the Century STE 3000 and it does fit, but I feel
more comfortable with her riding with the lap belt in the back.
We tried a road trip with car seats, and never again.  Too
crowded.  As far as the bar around the molded plastic frame of
the car seat, it is what adjusts the angle of the seat.  Even
if you took it off, the plastic part is large compared to seat
size.  Anyone want to talk to car seat manufacturers on behalf
of Porsche owners and convince them that we don't all drive
mini-vans?  No flames, please, but I am trying to make a 
point.  My Toyota Celica wasn't easy with two car seats either.

in the very long discussion of 944 fire extinguishers i didn't notice
my favorite mounting place, namely on the vertical surface of the rocker
panel to the left and below the driver's left knee.

that area is an enclosed box so screws in it won't cause a rust problem.

you do have to be careful to position it back far enough that it doesn't
interfere with your use of the dead pedal, but forward far enough that
you don't scrape your knuckles using the emergency brake.

very unobtrusive, very accessible, doesn't detract from anyone else's
seating.

Hi - I'm putting my '69 912 on a flatbed trailer for a long drive
next week.  This trailer has two sets of chains on each end,
presumably to connect "around the axle".  Obviously, I'm not going to 
do this literally and ratchet the chain down tight after looping it
around the half-shafts.  The trailer has no facility for putting straps
around the tires - only the chains to connect on the front and rear.

Any advice appreciated, including the approximate (within half a foot is
okay) location of the front-to-rear center of gravity (with a full fuel 
tank but otherwise empty).

Thanks!

BG has some *REALLY* good induction clean-up chemicals. I do however 
recommend seeing if you can find them direct from BG rather than getting
them at 300% markup from the dealer. I tend to use the BG stuff after
running race gas (no detergent in race gas) and it's *GREAT*.

The reason that you probably haven't heard about fastening an extinguisher
to the inside of the frame rail in the driver's footwell is that, to be
blunt, it's a lousy idea.  There is always the chance that an
extinguisher of the sort we're talking about can come loose, especially
if you put it in such close proximity to a guy doing fancy footwork!
Loose, you got a real problem on your hands.

I wish I had kept a complete record of the seats we used for our son over
the years, but...   :-/
If my memory is even marginally reliable though, the seat we found -which
fit in the 931 (also used in a 944 and a 924S)- was a GT 2000. Unfortunately
I am unsure of the manufacturer. Think it was a French company. Anyway,
the seat was available through Consumer's Distributing. Features a well
rounded bottom section so it won't carve the seat to bits, and is narrow
enough to *just* fit the seat. We tried a bunch of different seats before
settling on this one. My apologies for the less than precise info.

wrt. rear seat belts: If anybody comes up with a practical solution to
this one, I'd love to hear it. The dealer requests about $300 per seat
to furnish 3 point belts for the 931. I know zero about the nature of the
belt, but I don't think they use any recoil mechanism at all.
There was a requirement in the US at least, to furnish attachment points
for the belts even before  belts were mandatory so that part of the update
is easy.

No I didn't go, sadly, but I did catch the final few hours on Eurosport
yesterday afternoon. I must say I am not really interested in
the group C type vehicles, but I am interested in 911s and the
track was swarming with them! I guess everybody knows the result
Jaguar came in first in the GT class, but virtually every
other place and finisher in the class was a 911 of some sort or another. 
One particularly impressive finisher was a 911 the suffered serious
engine problems, and could only manage 20 MPH in the last couple of laps,
but none the less limped home sounding like a sick lawnmower.

Subject: Any AC Gurus?

        Well I finally replaced the AC compressor on my 85/2 944 because of
an internal bearing noise that I worried about. (If the bearing goes so
does the core on the compressor not to mention all the metal in the AC
lines) I purchased a new rebuilt compressor from I.C.E. (many adds in
Pano). With all compressors you have to replace the receiver/drier for the
compressor to be warranted, so that was replaced too along with fresh
o-rings all around. I did the compressor swap myself, easy job BTW, and
took it in for a full evac and recharge.
        So it seemed to cool well at first but now about 5 weeks later it
is not doing too well. The symptoms are:

        At 76F outside temp, 65% relative humidity the low side is reading
20psi and the high side about 150psi. There are no bubbles in the sight
glass but the high side seems a bit low ( should be 185-210psi ?) and 20psi
is about max for the low side so there is some indication of "Low side high
+ High side low = Bad compressor" even though I'm not quite sure of the
logic.
        The factory manual states that the temp at outlet should be 2-4C
but with all the vents closed except the center console and the fan on the
lowest setting the coldest it gets is around 10C, if the fan is set on the
3 or 4 setting the temp quickly rises to around 15C. I checked for any
problems with the e-valve by measuring the high and low sides after the
system was off for 15 min. and they match exactly, besides I didn't have
any problems with the old compressor besides the bearing, it cooled fine
but I never scrutinized it with a thermometer. The cooling temp does not
seem to be affected by measuring at 2000 rpm parked or at 65mph so I don't
think it has anything to do with an air flow problem. The new
receiver/drier is a bit smaller than the original but that should not have
anything to do with it. (If you do replace the receiver/drier on a 944/951
be sure that the distance between the inlet and outlet are the same as your
original because the first R/D I got from them was about 1 cm longer which
caused the AC line to foul on the headlight bracket when I turned on the
headlights on)
        So could anyone out there maybe tell me, what are the freon
pressure readings on your 85/2 or later 944 for the high side and low side
or what is the temp of the air from the center vent with the fan on 4?
Thanks for any help.

Also, once you have pulled the bulb (if it comes out...), try shining

Subject: Leaking Wheel Valve Stem

I am having a weird problem with one of my wheels.

I have a set of BBS RS (3 -pc.) wheels on my 944. I have
had them for 4 1/2 yrs with no problem. Recently, one of
them developed a leak. Seeing a piece of metal in the tire,
I assumed I had run over a nail and took it to a local
garage. It turned to be leaking around the valve stem and
the local garage couldn't fix it. Then I took the car to
NTW in Nashua NH, who had mounted my tires a few months
earlier. They were unable to fix the problem even after
obtaining special metal valve stems from BBS.

Does anyone have a clue as to why this wheel leaks from
around the valve stem no matter what kind of valve is
used? Does anyone know of a wheel/tire shop in the Boston
or So. New Hampshire areas who may be able to help?
Any help/suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks!

Hi all,

after 5000 $ cdn worth of repair on the 
first year of my ownership of a 944 ('86,64000miles),
I am beginning to be fed up with this car.

There is yet another problem:
The steering system fluid is leaking from 
the rack and pinion section. I've been 
told that the sealing kit not being available here 
in Montreal, I have a choice between replacing 
that part (new=over 1000$, old=? $).

Up to now, I kept the car in top shape. Every time,
there was a repair, I upgraded (if possible) 
the piece to be changed.

Now, I think its time to draw the line. The Porsche 
is very exciting car to drive when it is in top shape,
but maybe its better to start looking at Mercedes 
for reliability's sake.

Is it possible to stop the leak just by putting 
some tape or something???
I'm tired of spending...

Regarding Philip Katz's questions of "Is the 3.0 litre 944S2 "much" faster
than the 2.5 litre 944? Does it have much more low-end torque . . .?", my
opinion is definitely YES!  I owned an '83 944 for 7 years which I auto-x'd,
tracked, and did a few hillclimbs plus put on 60,000 miles of normal driving.
The S2 is a much improved car in all respects plus the increased power and
torque.  At the annual Silver Sage Region PCA BBB Hillcross, I lowered my
previous 944's best time by around 8 seconds (2:09.9).  My car is an '89, the
first model year.  All cars came to the US loaded-dual airbags, sunroof, ABS,
climate control A/C, alarm, power seats-and were sticker priced over $40K.
I think they are a great bargain because '89s can be found in the low $20K's.

Read *CAREFULLY* -- it's more expensive to own what kind of car
than what kind of car?

I'm constantly astounded at how expensive 944 and 928 parts and
service are! But then, we've had 30 years of 911s, so there are 
many more cars, and many more aftermarket sources for the parts.
And, most importantly, the 911 dates from an era when Porsche 
designed cars for *THEMSELVES*, and didn't take design projects for
other companies (Audi, for the 924/944, and MBZ for the 928) and
turn them into cars. 

For the record, my 911 (which I drive 18-20k miles a year, autocross,
and occassionally take to track days at TWS) usually costs me about
$1200 a year -- $350 for a set of rear tires, $100 for 1/3 a set of 
front tires, and a "major service" at about $500. The rest is misc
stuff that breaks unexpectedly. It's been that way for years. Don't
expect it to change, except when I need to finally break down and
rebuild the engine...

Oh well -- just look at the rear of my 914 racer -- "Just say no to H2O".

I had the radiator in my '83 944 replaced just over a year ago. After
talking it over with my mechanic, I went for the Porsche-equivalent
radiator (the "Porsche" label had been removed by the manufacturer). I'm
not sure where he got it but I recall that the price was in the $330
range (the whole job was about $450-500). 

The updated radiator is a bit thicker (about 1/4" I think) than the
original one. It solved the car's problem of overheating when doing
long uphill climbs on hot days; but now it tends to overheat when
driving in town on hot (>85F) days with the AC running. My suspicion
now is that my fans are unable to pull sufficient air through the new
radiator. I know that there are better fans available (6-blade vs. 
3-blade) but I don't think they will fit the early '83 944.

Comments? Similar experiences? Etc.

No, once the seals go, they cannot be patched or replaced by the 
average mechanic.  The rack works under something like 1500psi, so tape 
will not do anything for the leak.  You need to replace the rack.

	Howdy all,

	I passed one of the two major hurdles this morning when
the 914 ('74 1.8L) passed emissions here in VA.  It passed extremly well
also.  I will post the following numbers which it got:

	Test Type	Standards	Current Test
	CO %		6.00		.12
	HC ppm		600		57
	Dilution	6.00		11.22
	RPM		1600		835

	Actually the 914 did almost as well as my '92 Honda Civic.
It is really amazing how well it did :-).  

	I didn't pass state inspection because the rear brake pads 
were to worn down, and ther were no rear liscense plate lights.
I have two pair of ferrodo (sp?) pads, but I don't know what the
correct numbers are.  Does anyone know what is correct for the
914?  Hopefully I will have some liscense plate lights on one of
the other 914s.
	
	In any case, thanks for all the help everyone has given
me in getting the car to this point.  I will describe the electrical
problems I solved last light in another message.

Actually, water-cooled cars can be much cheaper to own than you might 
think.  For instance, the self-adjusting DME fuel system, hydraulic 
lifters, etc.  The only "losing" area relative to 911's is the radiator 
& water/oil intercooler (certain years).  With the power steering in 
the C2/C4 line, 911 owners can now enjoy the same steering rack seal 
failure that water-coolers have enjoyed for years!  Technology *does* 
spread throughoutt the model range!

I had an '83 944 that was dead reliable.  It wasn't until I got a 951 
and beat it on tracks like Watkins Glen (full boost for perhaps 60 
seconds of a 150 second lap) and pulled 1.3 G's on corners (measured) 
that gaskets and wheel bearings started failing.

From: bart@research.att.com

i have a question that is more a request for elaboration.  i have used
ds11's and metalmasters on my 951S and am thinking of finally plunging
into the cool carbon camp.  i have many concerns:

1) which hardness to get?  951's are heavy and fast and typically hard
on brakes - is there no point to getting anything but the hardest compound?

2) bedding in.  since carbon pads wear so little, is it advisable to
machine the rotors flat before installing carbon pads?  i have this
image of carbon pads taking two track events to fill in the ridges and
valleys of a set of rotors.

3) warping.  i know people who have warped rotors with performance
friction pads.  is this a carbon problem in general, eg lack of heat
conduction, super heating, etc, or are cool carbon pads somehow better
(and why)?

4) squealing.  i would prefer not to have to change between street and
track pads, but i hear carbon pads squeal something awful.  i've heard
more than one model for pad squeal, for example (a) it's the leading
edge of the pad and squeal will go away if you bevel it, (b) it's the
backing plate against the pistons and using a permatex compound takes
care of this.  what's the truth?

would machining the rotors before installing pads affect squeal?  the
metalmaster installation instructions recommend putting a cross-hatched
finish on rotors before installation, yet i don't know *anyone* who's
bothered to machine 951 rotors, regardless of pads.

we've all heard lots of hearsay - i want to hear from someone with
experience with carbon fiber pads on heavy cars.

Subject: Solved electrical problems on 914



	Howdy all,
	
	I wanted to post a quick description of how I fixed the left
headlight and horn on my '74 914 1.8L. 

	Following the advice I got on the net I pulled the fuse panel
out of the car (only two screws) and checked the silver relay, which
drives the highbeams apparently, for a short (even though the high
beams worked well.) That worked fine.  I next looked at the headlights 
and switched them side to side.  I couldn't believe it, but the 
headlight that wasn't working was filled with WATER!!!  Amazing.
No wonder it wasn't working.  I also learned that the compartment under
the headlights floods with water if the drain holes get filled (I 
kept wondering where all the water in the garage was coming from.)  Make
sure all you 914 owners check your for leaves if you part near
trees!!!  I put a sealed/dry headlight on the left side, and if worked :-).
Unfortunately I then turned the key off and the headlights retracted,
cracking the worked headlight :-(.  But, I had two spares in the basement
and they both worked once installed.  So, one major fix which was
needed before I could get the car inspected.

	The next problem was the horn (actually horns) on the car.  It
is a '74, but it has two horns??  Is that right?  Whenever I pushed
on the horn button I heard a clicking from the fuse panel.  The two
black relays on the right side of the fuse panel seem to drive
the horns (one for each side.)  I also checked to make sure that 
+12 volts was getting to the horn button, and that it worked.  I verified
that by simulating the horn button with a piece of wire.  Same click
as pushing on the button.  Okay, I guess that the horn itself works. Good.
I next pulled both horn off the car, and connected them directly to
the battery.  One worked, one didn't.  I also tried the horn button
with just one horn connected.  That didn't make a difference.  HHmmmm.

	I put the horn the worked back in line, and put the horn piece
back on the steering wheel and tried everything again.  It worked!!!
Unfortunately, it only worked until I got my girlfried to come hear it
:-(.  Drat!!. I doublt checked EVERYTHING again....  While I trying to 
figure out how to debug the horn relays I tried to switch them.  And
that worked!!!  (and it still worked when I got to the inspection
station this morning.)

	All in all, I learned alot about the car (again.)  Now all
I have to do it the liscense plate lights, and the rear brake pads, and
the car might actually be street legal.

I'd stay as original as possible.  Aftermarket parts in general are not 
of the same quality as originals.  This has been shown case after case.

If you drive the car only in conventional "street" mode, it's not such 
a problem.  Track, high speed, or high temperature driving is more 
stressful and requires 100% engineering - not 80% as most aftermarket 
parts as designed.

Unless you can test the radiator for cooling efficiency & corrosion 
resistance, you'd be gambling on the part.

To older 911 owners:
What has been your experiences with the longevity on your electric
fuel pumps?  A new one for my '72 911T is $189.00 (the cheapest I could find
from polling Panorama ads) but I can pick up a used one for $90.00. My mechanic 
says a new one is the way to go.  He is probably right but....

I finally threw in the towel on getting the MFI system running by myself
and took the car to a trusted but carb conversion inclined mechanic :-(
It seems that the fuel pump was the root of my problems!

BTW last week's valve adjustments tips were great and I made the pencil based

You can get red, blue, and green (for some cars).  Blue has the highest 
friction / best stopping power, and wears the rotors fastest.  Red is 
similar to DS11's, which is why I stayed away (DS11's work as well as 
OEM pads - that is, I cannot lock the brakes).  Friends with 930's & 
911's like the blues, so opinions vary.

compounds.  No problem here.

It's a problem with all 951's (S & regular), and is caused by OEM pads 
and inadequate cooling.  Get a Cool-Brake kit or contemporary 
equivalent.  The carbon pads are an excellent choice to prevent 
warping.  OEM be bad.

Yes, they squeal a lot!  Anti-squeal tricks (backing pads, goop) work.  
Don't know why, never done an examination.  Possibly high frequency 
resonance between pad & caliper or pad & rotor.  I used to switch back 
to "street pads", but got tired of the labor and reduced braking 
ability.  I now wash the wheels every other day to remove the carbon - 
very black!

I've never heard of anyone doing any preparation like this either!  
Sounds a bit excessive.  Basically, they want you to make the rotor 
abrasive to help cut-in the pad.  I wouldn't machine-down a 951 rotor - 
it'll just crack if you're a heavy brake user & you drive very fast.  
I've been through 5 or 6 front pairs, and they were all well within 
wear limits when they cracked!

Too broad a generalization, for my tastes.  Plenty of counterexamples,

>1) which hardness to get?  951's are heavy and fast and typically hard

If we're talking about Cool Carbons, there are three componds.  The original
compounds were orange and blue.  The oranges were for cars up to about 2000
lb, the blues for anything heavier.  Recently, a green compound has been
introduced, and is suitable for today's heavier, full-featured car.  I
forget the weight criterion, but the blues are the way to go for a 951, and
the greens are the right thing for a C2 or C4.  The compounds have
coefficients of friction which are very close to one another.

>2) bedding in.  since carbon pads wear so little, is it advisable to

Dunno that they wear that much less than other compounds.  I think they bed
in just fine to existing rotors, so long as the rotors have not be severly
scored or grooved.  Normal rotor wear is fine.

Unlike others' reports, I have found that Cool Carbons require no less
bedding and heat cycling than other pads, perhaps more.  I recommend you
find a little-used road, get the car up to 60 or whatever, threshold brake,
do it again and again until the pads start to green fade and emit that
unmistakeable perfume.  Then take a "cool down lap" home.  Do it again the
next night, just to be sure.  I think the pads may require less of this now
than the early production Cool Carbons did.  But I'd much rather do this
before going to the track than miss run groups at the track because of green
fade.

I too have seen it recommended that you change rotors when switching to
carbon/carbon or carbon/kevlar pads.  I think it unnecessary.

>3) warping.  i know people who have warped rotors with performance
>friction pads.  is this a carbon problem in general, eg lack of heat

The rotors will warp not because of the pads you use, but because of the
heat you are trying to dissipate through them.  Inasmuch as carbon pads have
higher coefficients of friction and make it easier to pump more heat in a
time period, I would have to says that you increase the chance of warping.

Several solutions.  One, run with rotors that have as much depth as
possible.  More depth means more mass means less temperature rise per
braking event (corner).  Two, cool the rotors with a brake cooling kit. 
Three, use your brakes less.

According to Puhn, the squealing comes from the pad against the rotor, and
from the leading edge in particular.  You can cure it in a few ways,
including the rubbery gook which you apply to the back, anti-squeal lines,
and chamfering the leading edge.  I personally live with a little squealing.

Hope this helps.

 I've just had the 914 painted and I'm replacing a couple of seals. Namely
 the rear trunk seal. I bought the real seal from Porsche rather than buying
 a substitute. Real one cost more but I just installed it and it fit 
 perfectly. Went on well and I'm pretty convinced that it fits better than
 the fake one would have. I've installed fakes before (wish I could find one
 for the rear top seal on the roof!) but always been disatisfied. Either
 one had to cut them to length or they died after just six or eight months.
 Not worth the money I saved (in general).

hi gang...

i've been running RedLine MTL in the transaxle of my 928 for several 
years now and decided it was time to change it ( i guess i should 
change it more often, but i only drive the car about 5K a year). 
anyway, as i was looking through my specs book, i noticed that Porsche 
specifies a GL-5 gear oil, and MTL is GL-4. The RedLine information 
that i have indicates that their 75W90 NS gear oil is probably what i 
should be running.

 i get the impression that the GL-4 spec doesn't provide the high film 
strength for differential gears that GL-5 does. am i going to 
prematurely need a ring and pinion for my 928? i'm going to have to 
open the tranny up soon of have it rebuilt soon, anyway, since the 2nd 
gear synchro takes about 20 minutes to spin second gear up to speed 
:-), but i'd rather not have to fork over for a new ring gear or other 
such high-priced 
carved-by-little-elves-in-the-black-forest-from-unobtanium type parts. 
am i doing any harm or accelerating the wear on the diff by running MTL?

does anyone have any experience along these lines?

btw, if anyone needs any tidbits of info about RedLine products, they 
sent me a large packet of pretty technical information when i called to 
find out where to buy the stuff up here. if you'd like me to look 
something up for you, let me know.

Well, the 356 *WAS* a hotted-up VW! At least until the 3-piece cases

Well the 914 VW/Porsche was designed by *Porsche* as a Porche sports-racer
specifically to carry the 911 engine. The 914/6 is where you need to look
for the design features on that car -- but when you "diff" the 914 and 914/6,
there isn't much difference at all except for the engine! The 4-cylinder
cars came from VW wanting to augment the Karman Ghia with another sports
car, and the fact that they later backed out (due to  the untimely death
of the VW exec who decided to go for this) didn't have much impact -- the
cars were designed for the 6, and adapted for the 4!

No, they don't sit around and say "Let's make a second class vehicle" at all. 
But what they do is more subtle: they design a car the fits their customer's 
(i.e. MBZ, Audi, Fiat, etc) profile so that it doesn't disrupt the customer's 
product line, service procedures, etc. Don't get me wrong -- the 944 and 928 
are *FINE* cars.  They're just built to a different standard. 

The 944 was to be an Audi GT, and while the Audi GTs have always been 
interesting and fun cars, they have a history going back into the mid-70s of 
being expensive to repair and more failure prone as they're basicly designed 
to sedan-type suspension and drivetrain specs for *COST* reasons. If you
don't believe me, look at the front suspension on the early 944s, and the
evolution that the car has gone through to get it to the late 944S2 level.

But hey, that stamped-metal Rabbit A-arm brought *A LOT* of its engineering
bretheren with it, many of which can't be erradicated. Like why can't you 
R&R a 944 engine without taking the whole front suspension off? And why
do you have to drop the whole rear end *and* exhaust out to change a clutch
on a 944 Turbo, all because the driveshaft is solid (but the 928 has a
slip joint that makes it possible to do the same without touching the
rear end)?? 

None of this (nor the countless other things I could bore you with)
make the 944 and 928 *BAD CARS*. They're just built to a different set
of standards, and have *DIFFERENT COSTS TO OPERATE*. You can't own
a 911 thinking that you'll be able to maintain it like a VW Beetle
(hey, they're both German, air-cooled, horizontally opposed -- should
be the same, right?) any more than you can maintain a 944 or 928
like you can a 911 (but hey, they're both *PORSCHE*, right?).

The difference is simple, and really, really shows when you start taking
these suckers apart: the 911 was built as a simple car, as a racer in the
spirit of the 356 but with better technology.  And sort of accreted the
luxury stuff as the price started going up, to make it "worth it" to their
buying public. Without execption, *ALL* of the water-pumpers were
built to be someone else's GT car, designed for luxury first, but with
enough performance to make it worth owning. And it shows when you go to
work on them.

   No steering rack leaks or other visible mechanical problems.  Good brakes 
   and all...

    There's probably been a lot of response on this already, but....
I've had good experiences with Yoko A509's.  They seem to be wearing pretty
well, and they hold the road quite nicely.  There are some places which will
warranty them for 20K miles.  I've also heard (and felt!) good things
about the various A008's for 911's and Datsun 510's.  The main drawbacks are
the faster wear, and the fact that they are a lot worse in the wet than the
dry.
(We went through a puddle in the 911, ran for a block or so, and cornered
moderately
hard--it just kept going, sideways!  Quick recovery, due to my friend's AutoX
experience....)

I dunno about lube, but when I R+R'd mine earlier, I had some real rubbing

notches that are just the right size for the cable in the sheet metal on the

Have the car checked out by your mechanic. It is not unreasonable to shell out 
an additional $2,000 for upkeeping the first year. Murphy's law dictates that 
when you buy a "perfect running car", it will show all its deficiencies the 
moment you drive it away. Likely culprits: clutch, rotors, waterpump, brake 
pads, power steering, sunroof, exhaust, water hoses. Also I would make sure 
(check the records if available) that the timing belt has been replaced every 
30,000 Miles and would do so if unsure. Although unprecise, a compression check 
with and without oil may give a rough estimate of engine condition (new 145, 
wear limit 95). However, after solving initial problems, you are likely to have 
a car that will be fun to drive for many miles. By the way, whenever cars are 
sold, "new tires" are mentioned. I consider this a minor cost compared to the 
"real" problems. Ever wondered why people put new tires on and than sell the car 
? Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: 944 steering leak

I couldn't agree more. I own a 1987 951 (60,000 Miles) and a 1987 911 Carrera 
Cabriolet (62,000 Miles). Both cars are great to drive and bring out different 
emotions. The 911 is smooth with great torque in the low and mid end, and feels  
like a sportscar. The 951 has great handling too and has the amenities of a 
luxury car. Performance is unbelievable but more peaky. There is no substitute 
for the  40-110 Mph "turbo-rush", leaving anything else in the dust. BUT... at a 
price. Although used 951's are much cheaper to purchase, they make more than up 
in maintenance costs. Even without major repairs, the 951 has been much more 
expensive. The higher engine stress and heat production wears of on all other 
components. I had to replace rotors, waterpump, auxilliary waterpump (turbo 
charger), clutch, power steering bottle (common problem), water hoses, and rear 
shocks (Koni) at significant cost. Early in its life, the car was a "mixer", 
also a common 951 problem and had the necessary work done under dealer warranty. 
The 911 on the other hand hasn't cost me a dime aside from routine maintenance.
I am certainly not the only one dumping a lot of cash for the pleasure of 951 
driving and challenge anyone claiming that the 944/951's are "cheap" Porsches!!!

Subject: 911SC restoration questions

Hi,

Will Roberson and I are painting/restoring a '79 911SC (european) and
we have a couple of questions to ask the collective net wisdom.

Trim pieces:  This question refers to the side and quarter window trim
pieces (and door frame).  I am under the impression that these pieces were
originally anodized black (they are quite faded now).  Is this correct?
Has anyone ever had these pieces re-anodized and if so what was the cost
and quality of the outcome?

Windshield seal: Just looked at a new Carrera and the windshield and rear
window seals look like they might fit.  Does anyone know for sure?  They
don't have the metal trim piece in the middle and thus might save us from
fixing/replacing the old ones on this car.

Air conditioners:  We think that this car has an aftermarket AC system and
it seems strange to me.  There are two condensers, one on the rear deck lid
and one behind the left rear wheel.  The one behind the rear wheel had a
fan which no longer works.  Is it possible that the condenser on the deck
lid was added after the fan quit, or do we need both condensers to produce
any cold air at the vents.

Air dams:  We have thought about adding a front air dam/spoiler, but
although the standard Porsche aftermarket sources(Performance, Automotion,
Tweeks) have nice things, their prices are prohibitive ~$400.  Are there
better (cheaper) sources that still have good products?

Thanks!

Brandon Dixon

P.S. The resoration is a down to the metal job.  We'll let you know how it
turns out when we finish.

I experienced that "mixing" problem with 944's over the weekend. The oil
light came on, and when I opened the hood (drove to the next gas station)
and there was oily coolant spewing from the raditor hose. It was foaming
a light brown, like a nice cappucino... The plastic radiator reservoir
was almost empty, but was full of that brown foam. I checked the dipstick
but the oil in the crankcase looked clean. So I guess only the cooling
system half is contaminated. Is there are reason that the oil in the
crankase also wouldn't be foamy? I suspect that the rubber radiator hose
blew because of of the heat of oil in the system, but maybe it was already
weak? (looked like a crack developed).

I had some alum. trim pieces re-anodized on my '77 9ll.  Cost was $20-$30.
One note: the door handles are NOT anodized, I had them re-plated once
and the shop told me it was a multi-step process.  From what I remember
there was the base metal, plated with copper, then a black oxide.  Cost
was $50.

        A few years when I had the intermix problem no coolant got in the
crankcase, I guess if you catch it soon enough you won't have to rebuild
the bottom end. I just noticed oil in the coolant tank one day, I never got
the "cappuccino" effect. But I've heard of people that have had coolant get
into their oil form the oil cooler seals blowing. My guess is that the
update kit does a good job of fixing the problem.

I've had the same experience as you all - oil in the antifreeze, but 
not vice-versa, thank goodness.  I change the oil/filter to be sure anyway.

I'd bet the reason the oil trashes the water (rather than the other 
way) is because the oil pressure is higher than the water pressure 
(40-100 psi vs. 15-20 psi).

Anyone with a 911 ever had this problem?  Cappuccino in your water, 
that is?  I imagine some 956's have had it.  :-)

Subject: Carbon brakes on 944

Bart asks about the carbon brakes for his 951. (944 turbo) I put them into my
944S2 1 1/2 years ago. Others have given scientific replies to Bart's
question. Here are my anecdotal experiences.


1)	which hardness to get?  The BLUE is the one to use for any kind of
	dual-use (road & track) car.


2)	bedding in.  I just drove them on the street for a week or so before
	my first track event, and towards the end of the week did a few
	heavy-duty stops.  no problems thereafter.  as far as 'since carbon
	pads wear so little' I can't agree.  I'm on my 3rd set, and I drive <
	6 track days/year.  It is probably a good idea to machine the rotors
	prior to installing them.

3)	warping.  I have had NO PROBLEM with any warping.

4)	squealing.  Yup.  They do squeal in street driving sometimes.  (I
	can't figure out what provokes them -- sometimes they squeal and
	sometimes they don't.)  I just bought a backing plate along with new
	pads, but these are not yet installed, so I don't know if they'll do
	any good.

CONCLUSION:  The Carbons are GREAT!!!  They simply do not fade and they have
unbelievable stopping power, in fact I think they even get stronger as the
session goes on.  On the street they are so powerful that sometimes the ABS
comes on if I press the pedal just a little too much.

The reverse flow may come after the engine is shut off, when the
water pressure remains in the 15-20 PSI range much longer than the
oil system maintains pressure.

I also had traces of oil in my water when I bought my 87 944S several
years ago. I had planned to do the cooler seals myself, and just
change the oil, based on the very small amount of oil in the water.
However, the dealer volunteered (!) to pick up the job on warranty,
and they changed the rod bearings as well (which the factory calls
for when oil is found in the water).

SUBJECT: Splitfire sparkplugs a placebo?

I have just removed a set of Splitfire SF 406C (supercedes SF 259D)
sparkplugs from my CD ignitioned (factory) early 911.  The plugs never got
a chance to see an event -- track, A/X or other.  I would hesitate to use
them even for street.

The car runs smooth with these plugs, but lost a SIGNIFICANT amount of
low end and mid range power.  Top end (5500+ RPM) seemed the same.  I know
my car is very picky when it comes to plugs as I did "seat of the pants"
testing two years ago of Bosch copper, platnum, ND U-groove, and NGK Paladiums.
The winner hands down was the NGK Paladiums -- runner up, with slightly less
low end was Bosch copper.  Bottom of the line (never to be used) was the NDs

For now I'll stick with the high-end NGKs.

Has anyone out there had experience, good or bad, with Splitfires?  Am
particularly interested in use in your tow vehicle, commute horse, etc.
(non-Porsche), as I'm still considering trying them in this application.

Also, has anyone found other plugs that they feel work good in CD fired
911 ignitions?

Subject: Choosing a manual (for a beginner)

With the last repair on my 911 being pretty expensive - Emergency Brake was 
not working, had to replace emergency brake shoes, flush brake system (I was
told this was necessary just in case because of the brake failure, the 
fluid might have boiled) - Labor=$350, Parts=$274.  I have decided to look
at doing some of my own repairs in the future.

Can anyone help me in finding a good manual for a beginner.  

Basically I am not looking to become a mechanic overnight, but a manual with
reasonably explicit instructions should be enough for me to start learning
and saving some money at the same time.

Right now, I guess I am very much a novice.  Change oil, air filter,
plugs etc...   I am looking to move up in the world.  Hopefully I can
graduate to doing brake jobs, adjusting emergency brake etc...  I 
would guess that these jobs wouldn`t be too hard.  But being a novice I need
a good manual to pretty much walk me through it.  In addition, pictures would 
be extremely useful in showing what's what.

I figure doing stuff like flushing the brake system should be reasonably easy,
but have no idea where to start.  This is where the manual comes in.

I have heard that quick tune-up shops and the like have manuals that
your basic idiot can use.  For example, last time my girlfriend took her
duster for a tune-up the "mechanic" (I use the term loosely in this case)
popped the hood and looking at the engine asked how many cylinders it
had (couldn't he tell by looking at how many plugs there were ?).  

So what would you experts recommend ?

Subject: bike rack on 911?

Does anyone know of a source for a bike rack of any size or configuration
that will mount on a '79 911SC Targa with a tail?? Or does any one have a
creative idea for transporting a bike (19" mountain) inside the car (roof
on or off)? Or is this sacrilegious?

SUBJECT: Splitfire sparkplugs a placebo?

I have just removed a set of Splitfire SF 406C (supercedes SF 259D)
sparkplugs from my CD ignitioned (factory) early 911.  The plugs never got
a chance to see an event -- track, A/X or other.  I would hesitate to use
them even for street.

The car runs smooth with these plugs, but lost a SIGNIFICANT amount of
low end and mid range power.  Top end (5500+ RPM) seemed the same.  I know
my car is very picky when it comes to plugs as I did "seat of the pants"
testing two years ago of Bosch copper, platnum, ND U-groove, and NGK Paladiums.
The winner hands down was the NGK Paladiums -- runner up, with slightly less
low end was Bosch copper.  Bottom of the line (never to be used) was the NDs

For now I'll stick with the high-end NGKs.

Has anyone out there had experience, good or bad, with Splitfires?  Am
particularly interested in use in your tow vehicle, commute horse, etc.
(non-Porsche), as I'm still considering trying them in this application.

Also, has anyone found other plugs that they feel work good in CD fired
911 ignitions?

See ya' at Parade (Car # 716).....

Subject: Re: 944 Supercharger

>Over here in the UK there's been rumours that a 944 supercharging kit is 
>available over in the US.  Does anyone have any info on this?

Since I have this history that includes building supercharged big-block
Fords back in the '70s, I sort of perk up when I see any "supercharge
your XXX" ads. I called both Exotic Images in the Chicago area and German
Auto of Knoxville (616-691-1911) about their kits. Exotic Images seems to
not be answering their phone these days, so I didn't list their number.

Both kits use a Paxton centrifugal blower, belt driven off of the crank.
I'd already deduced that from the pictures, though. Both have different
special plumbing for hooking the blower up to the standard stock air intake.
Both claim to be something you can bolt onto your 911 or 944 "with no 
further changes". 

Yeah. Right. It's like this: you pretty much have to make *SERIOUS* changes
to the way you engine works if you want do this right. It's kinda like adding 
a turbo -- if you have a CIS or carburetted car, it's not a big deal, just use
bigger injectors or bigger jets to get more gas. However, with a DME car, 
you'll need new software and maybe new injectors too. The hard part is
getting enough new information about how much air you're using to make sure
you get enough gas soon enough.

You also have to make another trade-off on final boost and how you get it. 
If you keep your stock compression ratio, you'll have good low-end performance 
and some extra power when the blower comes in (and yes, there is a "comes in" 
effect -- not quite as far from 0 RPM as a turbo, but noticable) *BUT* you 
have to set the wastegate low so as to keep from slagging your pistons. On the 
other hand, if you lower your compression, you can run more boost -- which 
changes your power characteristics, mainly where in the RPMS it hits -- but 
you still have to observe the maximum cylinder pressure rules, so it's not 
clear that's a win or not!

Basicly, my expectation is that this is full engineering project to get
right. If the kit is engineered with acceptible "tolerances" and with 
sufficiently pessimistic assumptions, I have no doubt that you can just
bolt it on and get more power. I just have concerns about little things
like "for how long" and "so what aren't they telling me". 

However, this has gotten me excited enough that I've decided my next street
Porsche project is to find an '80s model 930 with a blown engine for cheap,
and build a supercharged engine for it. I'll know more after I'm done, right?
Stay tuned...

The 914 is one of those "it depends" deals. If the windshield is loose
because of the seal being shot, then you should go to a glass shop and
have them re-install the windshield. Should be cheap, $50 or so. If it's
loose because it's been loose before and the metal has rusted away, well,
that's not so good, nor cheap to fix. Involves fabricating new metal from 
flat stock, welding it in, etc. Unfortunately, you won't know until the 
glass is out...

I use a Yakima rack on my 66 911 with no whale tail. You can adjust the
postion of the bike on the rack if needed, but I doubt the rack and
tail would come close to touching.

Nice thing about the Yakima rack is that it is modular, so you can
convert it for a variety of uses (carrying windsurf boards, small
boats, luggage containers...) Heck, I take all the bike attachment
parts off the rack cross bars, tool down to the local lumberyard, and
load up on 4x8 sheet of plywood, or lengths of lumber.  Amazing what
you can haul. It takes a lot of rope to tie the load on securely, and I
stay off from high speed roads.

You can check out Yakima racks at bicycle shops.

We are setting up a 911 with a single plug MSD system.  As far as I can
tell we have to fabricate some bracketry to hold the unit and to hold
the sensor as well as a plug for the distributor.

Has anyone come across some pre-fab units for this?  How big a deal is
fabricating the sensor bracket?

Thanks!

Subject: 911 Heat Exch./Exh. ports

This may be a bit obscure, but on some 911 engines (77 2.7 USA, 80-83 3.0 USA,
3.2's All) Porsche used an inner sleeve on the exhaust manifolds which
extended beyond the flange into the cylinder head.  I believe these things 
were called 'gasket savers'.  Anyways, I bought a pair of SSI exchangers
recently which do not have the sleeves, and when I removed the exhaust 
from my '77 9ll, I noticed that the exhaust port had the port modified 
(~1mm larger diam. for a depth of about 15mm.) for these sleeves.  
My question is, will there be a (significant/noticeable) performance hit 
for not having the sleeves fill in the gap?  What is the purpose of these 
things?

Here's a picture:

the SSI system.

Subject: Re: bike rack on 911?



Is the Yakima rack a roof-mount rack?  If so, it might not fit
on Targa tops.  (The original poster, Philip O. Jefferson, mentioned 
he had a Targa.)

Racks are a big question mark in my mind.  I've used a Piper ski
rack on my 911 Targa and it was OK.  The Piper holds only skis
(2 pair) and attaches to the rear of the car in two places: 

 1) The top half clamps to the engine grill on the rear lid.  This 
    can be tricky if you have AC, because you have to get under
    the condenser.  Takes 15 minutes and 4 hands.

 2) The bottom half screws in under the license plate bracket.
    Very easy to install.

Installing and using the rack caused no damage to the car's finish.
It held two pairs of skis securely at speeds up to 70 MPH.  Note
That the lock is useless because it is too low to clamp the skis
between the bindings.  I don't know how it would work with a 
whale tail.

I suspect that the Mohn (sp?) racks that Automotion sells might be
better because of their clamping and locking mechanism.

Do any Porschephiles have experience with Porsche-brand racks?

PS:  A 6'5" surfboard just fits inside a 911 Targa, if it
     lies diagonally within the passenger compartment ;^)

I have not used Splitfire(TM) plugs myself, but have read their brochure
with great interest.  I personally am going with my instinct that they're
not going to be worth the money.  Their claims are typical of scam
products in the past.  There one-liner excerpts of reviews by minor
automotive magazines do not impress me.

Of course they never include data from scientific studies, by which I mean
double blind statistically valid measurements.  Also, if they were any good,
don't you think that a car manufacturer would be stupid not to use them as
OEM if they actually produce more horsepower with no additional fuel or
increased emmisions for only about $10?

This is not to flame the original poster, just my opinions.

Subject: Squeeky Cool Carbon's

Just a quick comment..

My Cool Carbon's only squeeked (and a very small amount at that) when applying
them slightly at a stop light!  They did not ever squeek at ANY OTHER TIME!

I could contribute this to a few things:

(1)  When I installed them, my mechanic rebuilt all my calipers, assuring
I had no 'dragging' calipers in the system.

(2)  My rotors were near 'new' and had never been warped.

(3)  I broke them in exactly as stated in the instruction (3-5 easy apps
of brakes from 60 to 30 mph/ 3-5 med. apps from 60 to 30/ then HARD on them
from 80mph until they fade or smoke, then PULL OVER and let them COOL
for 30 minutes- a great time to let your adrenalin subside due to their
INCREDABLE STOPPING POWER!!!).

(4) The rotors were turned 'very carefully' (read slowly, thus assuring
that the rotor surface was very smooth, as opposed to a quick cut on the
brake machine that leaves the surface wavey....takes 15 minutes a rotor
vs 5 minutes at 'Midas')

(5)  Lastly, I removed the backing plates (dust sheilds) which may cause
some high frequency vibrations to occur under braking (theory here...).

A note, I just recieved a set of Cool Carbons for my wife's BMW 318i and
in the instructions was a comment that CC now has a 'special' lub to cut
down on the  amount of squeeking.... call them and talk to them about it!


Also, I had experienced little to now 'dust', but my car was (I say was
due to the fact the at I totalled it 4 weeks ago.... ego and fractured
wrist healing slowly.....)weighed only 2340 lbs ('72 911 ).

These comments, as usual, are IMHO!!!

G'day,
