Subject: Gas

Those who recalled the Consumers Report article on gas were right.  I tracked
down the article and its subsequent updates and corrections (last one was 6/91
I think).  Basically, relying on company self reporting, the following brands
have fuels with additives which pass the "BMW unlimited mileage" test in
regular, mid, and premium grades: Amoco, Atlantic, Chevron,
Diamond-Shamrock,Exxon, Fina, Gulf(Cumberland Farms), Hess, Kerr-McGee,
Marathom, Mobil, Phillips 66, Shell, Sunoco, Texaco. Conoco regular & premium.

Those whose premium grade only passes the BMW unlimited mileage test
are:Citgo, Clark, Getty, and BP west of Johnstown PA.  As I understand it BP
east of Johnstown is different and doesn't pass at any level.  Arco seemed
confused. There is a table in the April 91 issue of CR but a correction/update
adds a few more later on, none are deleted.  It would seem therefore, that if
the owners manual says regular fuel is fine for your Porsche you need only
stay with a premium BRAND to get the additives which will reduce/eliminate
fuel based deposits on valves.

	From London's _Evening Standard_ of 28-MAY-1992, written by Ian
Morton and reproduced without comment :


	Forget wind in the hair macho motorists, women drivers are the next
target for the sports car.

	Porsche, which supplied many of the wheels for the upwardly mobile
in the Eighties and nosedived into the recession with them, is set
for a comeback. But this time, "new woman" is the target.

	Porsche's new 968 will trigger a new marketing approach, says UK
sales manager John Edwards. Women executives are "a growing and
significant force in business and will be specifically targeted -
this is not sexist, it is an accurate way to address our market".
Porsche's 968 replaces the 944 beloved of the yuppies and teenage
scribblers who helped the firm to a record 3,700 sales in the UK
four years ago. And Porsche makes no apologies for its rather
similar appearance - though 82 per cent of components are new or
modified, the 968 is an evolution of the previous model.

	Major differences include an engine that automatically adjusts its
timing and power output to demand. The price of progress looks steep
- the manual fixed-head version will cost #34,945, nearly #6,000
more than the replaced model, and the cabrio #38,724, an increase of
more than #8,000.

	"The 968 will reach 60mph in 6.5 seconds - but will stop safely
from 60 in less than three seconds," said Edwards.

I beliver the reason your high performance Porsche has an
85 MPH speedometer is that it was the law back then. The theory
by the insurance companies, et al, was that if you could not see
numbers greater than 85 mph you would never want to driver faster than
that and the world would be safe. That law was rescinded around 1984-85.

	Two questions for the 944 cognoscenti :

1. My tool roll has 6 compartments in it, but only 5 tools. So what, if
anything, is missing? The contents are:

21mm Spark Plug Spanner
17 X 19mm Double ended box spanner
Tightening bar for above
Allen key with rubber bung at one end (what is this for?)
Towing hook

2. The garage which did my last service has gone out of business :-( and
it's time for a 6k service, so I'm now trying another one which was
recommended by people in the local Porsche Club. I had planned to go for
Mobil 1 oil after reading good things about it here, but this garage only
uses Shell oils. They tell me that they use 15/50 normally for 944s, and
only advise using Gemini in turbos. 

a. Is Gemini as good as Mobil 1? Are all synthetic oils much the same?
[Hope I don't start any religious wars!]

b. Should I go for Gemini rather than 15/50, or should I bring my own
Mobil 1? The 15/50 is 2 pounds per litre and the Gemini 3.60 pounds, so it
wouldn't add an awful lot to the service costs.

	The car is an 85.5 UK spec 944 Lux, 53k miles, absolutely stock,
used only for road use.

	When I acquired my 85.5 944, there were a number of niggly
electrical problems with it, many of which I managed to fix with the
assistance of people on this list. In the hope that they may be of use to
others, I've summarised the problems and solutions ... e-mail me if you
want more details on any of these. There are also a couple of problems
which I've not yet fixed - any help on these would be appreciated.

	Car : 1985 ('86 Model Year, i.e. teardrop dash) 944 Lux, 2.5
litre, UK spec, 53k miles, manual transmission. Stock.

PROBLEM : One of the twin horns wasn't working.
SOLUTION : The gasket on the horn had leaked, allowing the innards to
corrode. I tried dismantling, cleaning and remantling (is there such a
word?) but to no avail and ended up having to buy a new horn :-(

PROBLEM : The windscreen washer did not work in the "only spray water but
don't activate the wipers" position.
SOLUTION : I suspect that the previous owners had never used this position
on the switch (you pull it back one position to just spray the screen and
further back to activate the wipers as well). I removed the switch (after
taking off the steering wheel - and despite claims to cover this model,
the Haynes manual does *not* tell you how) and sprayed contact cleaner
into it. After repeating this treatment, it all works fine.

PROBLEM : The MPG gauge stopped working - it went to maximum (0 mpg) when
the ignition was on and stayed there.
SOLUTION : This took me the longest to trace, about 12 hours in total.
There is a red plastic connector in the passenger compartment and one of
the pins had come adrift, possibly when my alarm was installed. I only
discovered it when I was at the "lets take *everything* apart and spray it
with contact cleaner" stage. Kevin Gross kindly snail-mailed me a wiring
diagram which helped me identify it.

PROBLEM : The windscreen washer was fine on the driver's side but only
spluttered on the passenger side.
SOLUTION : There is a one-way valve in the plumbing to each of the washer
jets which had seized on the passenger side - this took me by surprise as
I know little about plumbing and never expected a valve there!

PROBLEM : The tilting roof intermittently doesn't.  
SOLUTION : I wish I knew - this one's still not resolved. I've tried
dismantling the motor mechanism and cleaning it as best I can. The switch
and relay seem OK as when the roof doesn't open there is still a whirring
sound from the motor.  The problem is intermittent - sometimes the roof
won't open at all, other times it partly opens and yet other times it all
works fine. It usually will close OK.  Could this have anything to do with
the micro switches near the motor, or worn brushes?

PROBLEM : The speedometer intermittently doesn't work at speeds below about
30mph.
SOLUTION : This is the other one I haven't figured out. Sometimes the
speedometer stays at rest until I'm doing about 25-30mph, then it works
fine. Again this is intermittent. I've had a quick look at the leads going
to the speedo sender and they seem OK - could the sender be duff? Is it
expensive to replace?

On the '73 914 I recently bought, I noticed that the 2 'warm air guides'
which are normally mounted under the engine about where the pushrod tubes
go, are not there.  Can anyone tell me for sure whether 
 (a) these are strictly heater system parts
 (b) these are guides to help the fan cool the engine
 (c) both (a) and (b)

I don't have any temp guage on this car yet and I don't want to drive
long distances and overheat the thing.  Having heat is not important to
me.  Thanks.

I had a problem similar to this on my 1988 944. It turned out to be
the two plastic gears which lift the two supports at the rear of the
sunroof. The motor turns a worm gear cable which turns one end of the
plastic gears. The other part of the plastic gear raises the roof.
In my case the roof stuck the first time I raised the roof in the
spring and caused the motor to strip the plastic gears. Needless to
say, I now push the roof up manually once when it has not been
opened for a long time prior to using the motor. Hope this helps.

My '85 944 had a problem with the sunroof also. Sometimes when I went to "open"
it and the last thing I had done with it was "tilt", nothing would happen. If I
used the tilt again it would then start to work. I always put this down to being
slightly out of adjustment. It was too intermittent to bother with. I think
yours is a similar problem to mine. Does the problem always occur when you last
used the roof open? Another think I noticed was about 30sec after the ignition
was turned on, the sunroof motor would turn on for an instant as if
retightening itself. I always thought it must take a german mind to have a
timer recheck the roof after starting the car ;-)

The speedometer is an easy problem to diagnose. The jump up to the current speed
from 0 when you reach 25-30 is because the guage itself is sticking. only when
the force is enough will it pull away from the point at which it sticks. I have
not taken a gauge out of a Porsche so I do not know whether it is fixable, nor
do I know how much a new guage would be. I guess you could always try fixing it
and if all else fails then replace.

I've been working on the brakes on my 911 (72) and got out my little
"Technical Specifications" book to get the torque settings for some
of the bolts. The tables in the book have "mkp" as the units. What
does this stand for? My best guess is that its German for kgf-m 
(kilogram-force/meters) which is ~ Nm/9.8 (I think).

By the way, I learned at our novice week-end's autocross school that the
standard issue Porsche first aid kit contains everything one would need for,
say, an appendectomy or simple organ transplant, but lacks band-aids.  Go
figure.  The first time I had opened the thing since owning the car.  One of the
participants had cut his finger.  My daughter has since generously contributed a
small assortment of Walt Disney band-aids to the cause.

I have never heard of Gemini.  I assume it's a UK brand.  Mobil 1 is fine.  In
fact, a street-drive car is just as well off (and your wallet more so) with a
good brand of mineral oil.  I use Castrol 20W50 or 10W40 for no reason other
than its availability at a good price at a local mall.

There is a fair-sized collection of electrical and mechanical stuff which runs
the roof.  There's a detailed trouble-shooting guide in a tech bulletin and in
the workshop manuals.  There have also been a series of tech bulletins
describing lifting roof repair do's and don'ts.

The micro-switches are certainly worth checking.  I've heard them blamed before.
I would myself get the wiring diagram out and go after the system with a
multi-meter, figure out how everything works and what doesn't.

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!


I am traveling heavily for the next few months. I am also asleep a the
switch, or I would have sent this out yesterday! Anyway, list maintenence
will be once a week unless I get lucky and have more time. Please keep this
in mind if you have problems.

And remember, I now edit the newsletter for the Lone Star Region. 
If you happen to have on-line copies of your regional newsletter, or
at least the interesting articles, maybe we can set up an article exchange.
Or, if you'd like to write something or have something written that you'd like
to see in print outside of your own region, let me know....

Some Porsche Club info follows. IF you're not a member, join!! 
I'm going to investigate getting permission to create an "electronic region"
where the "region boundaries" are defined by network connectivity. Won't
displace your regular physical region, but hey, you should see how we'd
get to do the driving events... 8{)

Porsche Club of Americia.
Does take non-US membership.
+1 703 922-9300, roughly 9:00 to 5:00 EST (GMT - 6).  Dues are $36/year.
Have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number handy, if you own a car.

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@karazm.math.uh.edu


The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) Please try to send all administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, as some members have discovered,
   you can also reach me by phone (sometimes).

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

The sheet metal sections I assume you are talking about simply guide a
small part of the cooling air delivered by the engine fan to the heat
exchangers, where that air is heated, and then delivered (through the
"J tubes" and the flexible air hoses) to channels within the car's
chassis and thus to the interior, for heat (and to the dashboard area,
for defrost).

To answer your question specifically, I believe that you can run the car
without those ducts in place without fear of overheating the engine.
The only danger would be that the presence of the ducts and heat exchangers
would restrict the air flow enough that when they are absent, too much
of the cooling fan air is lost through the disconnected openings. I believe
this is a very small risk. If you are concerned, you could block the
unused cooling fan output openings with duct tape or the like.

I was going to go to the swap meet but overtime at work will probably
prevent me from taking that Friday off. It is a 10 hour drive to
Ohio from Montreal. From the ads in Excellence, it seems like a 
pretty big event.

My main reason for wanting to go (among other things), is to find
black anodised window trim for my 911 Coupe. It is currently dressed
with aluminium coloured ones and was going to try and trade it for
some black ones. Tweeks has the pieces for 4x$70 which is more than
what I want to pay for a purely cosmetic item. Does anyone know where
I can get (or swap) window trim new or used, at a reasonable price?

I know what parts you are refering to, but those are not what I am worrying
about.  The 'warm air guides' (I've also heard them called 'lower deflector
plate' right and left) are roughly trapezoidal pieces of sheet metal which
cover a section of the bottom of the engine.  I believe it was Kevin Gross
who already responded that these parts are necessary for proper engine
cooling, but I would like to hear any experience to the contrary.  I'm
going to get these parts and install them, but who knows how long it's
been driven without them so far.

Two questions for the group:

1) What do you get when you put a large (5 year-old) Mercedes engine in a small
BMW?  (Hint: yes, this is a Porsche question.)

2) Porsche supposedly changed the model number of the 911 from 901 because
Peugeot claimed that all three-digit model numbers with a middle zero were
reserved for them. How many European (non-Peugeot) models of the 50's and
60's had such numbers? (You can restrict to those where the number was not
keyed to engine displacement, like Mercedes 200 and 300; maybe they could
get a waiver from Peugeot.)




























































1) A 356 (cf. 320, 325, and Merc. 560).

2) Incomplete list: BMW 502, 503(?), 507; Bristol 401, 402, 403, 404, 405
(note 401 and 403 are Peugeot model numbers); Facel Vega HK500. Also involving
capacity: BMW 700, Ferrari Dino 206.

Yes, I'll be at the Stoddard swap meet this month.
I hope there's a lot of body, suspension, and interior stuff there

Hey, anybody need a '69 911/912 passenger side fender - CHEAP!?
Need a '66-68 vintage fender in case anybody has one they want to sell.

If anyone has recommendations for where to stay, I'd appreciate

Mark,

The trapeziodal(sp?) warm air guides on the bottom of the 914 engine are positively not required for engine cooling.  Additionally, they do not use or 
block any other cooling fan air outlets.  Their deletion may reduce the 
effectiveness of your heating system and the lack of a left side one may affect
the calibration of the thermostat for the movable cooling flaps since it will
now be operating in cooler air.  I suspect their absence actually improves 
cooling once the thermostat opens the air flappers all the way.

When I bought my first 914, I had the same concern as you and actually ordered
new ones.  Now I seldom even put them on the cars.

I have never heard of Gemini.  I assume it's a UK brand.  Mobil 1 is fine.  In
fact, a street-drive car is just as well off (and your wallet more so) with a
good brand of mineral oil.  I use Castrol 20W50 or 10W40 for no reason other
than its availability at a good price at a local mall.

*******

A friend at work posted (paper on a bulletin board, not electronically) 
a fairly scary note regarding Castrol.  Appearantly (in wet sump engines)
the oil will foam, which supposedly reduces the lubricating properties.

There was also a story about bad smoke problems that were cured by 
switching to another (non-castrol) oil.

Since the 944's are wet sump (I think), I thought (i) this might be 
informative, and (ii) has anyone else hear anything similar?

I can get Kendall for about $1.59/qt, so that's what I've been using.

I suspect that the most important quality of the oil is that it is FRESH.
I change mine about every 3500 miles.  (I shoot for 3k, but...)

I'm **really** glad that Mountain View (where I live) has a curbside
recycling program that picks up motor oil; 911's hold a *lot* of oil.

events)? I know I've heard of this happening before, but I can't remember
if I should be concerned or not.

Though I had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong with my
alternator (no electrical problems), when I removed it to do other work
on my car, I noticed that it makes rather unpleasant grating noises when
I spin it by hand.

Does anyone have experience repairing alternators that seem fine

Since we're on the subject of Castrol's problems...  Has anyone heard
about Castrol and the Honda Interceptor motorcycle engines?  I seem
to remember something about Castrol oils lacking zinc disulfide (?).
The Interceptor engine has really tight valve springs, or something.
Zinc disulfide protects alloys similar to cams and lifters.  Owners
who used Castrol (specifically) had to replace their camshafts much
sooner than owners using other oils. "Sooner" meant 1/10 the life of
cams under other oils.  I don't remember this topic very well, but it
was discussed at length in the rec.motorcycles(.racing ?) group a
couple of years ago.  

Can anyone enlighten me on the realities involved here?

Subject: 914 Fog light electrical question

A while back I decided to get the old, broken fog lights on my '73 2.0
914 working again, but I decided I wanted driving lights instead.  I
found the right diameter Hellas (no easy task) and have them
installed.... *But*... I find these lights behave in a manner that
would be perfectly appropriate for fog lights.  That is, when the
switch for them is pulled out in the on position, they will only be
lit if the main headlamps are on lowbeam position, the only one you
would use in the fog.

I'd like to be able to have my driving lights stay on regardless of
what mode the main headlamps are in - highbeam or lowbeam.  In looking
at the wiring diagram in my Heinous manual, it looks like there is a
fog light relay somewhere in there.  My very non-expert feeling on
this is that if I can short this relay (terminal 30 to 87) my driving
lights should stay on no matter what the main headlamps are doing.

Can anyone tell me if this is the right way to go about the mod?  If
so, does anyone know where this relay is physically located on the car
and what it looks like?

Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone.

A while ago somebody mentioned using Redline in their tranny
with good results.  I'd like to know if anyone else has used
this product and what they can tell us.  My 915 tranny is 
getting very tricky.  when the car(transmission)  gets warm
going to reverse or first is hell.  It grinds pretty bad.  I 
have to hold the clutch for a while.  Could it be a clutch
adjustment?  When the car has some speed (5mph) I can go to 
first gear with no problem.  The grinding noise is only there
when shifting in full stop.

Please help.

sean.

In this months issue of Road and Track, the technical tidbits section, they 
discussed the use of synthetic oil in the tranny. The editor of the column
stated that syncros need a certain amount of friction to work well. If the 
synthetic is >too< good, then you get the gnashing of teeth and other bad 
things. He also said that is >does< depend on the tranny. Some work remarkably
well with synthetics and some, well, clench thier teeth.  =)
Just a possible suggestion...

Robert,

I too have noticed this problem with 914 alternators.  In fact, every high 
milage 914 alternator I've had out recently has had this problem.  I normally
just take them to the local alternator rebuilder, who replaces the bearings
and checks them out for me for about $45.  I also have friends who do it them-
selves.  I would be uncomfortable with reusing the alternator if it was making
bearing noises.

Jeffrey,

I just did the modification to allow my foglights to come on independently of 
the headlight switch.  It is very well laid out in an article by Allen Caldwell
in one of the volumes of Up-Fixin der Porsche.  I don't have the index with me
here at work, but I think it was one of the later volumes.  By the way, Allen
Caldwell recently put out an index to 914 technical articles which has only
been published in the Connecticutt Valley Region newsletter to the best of my
knowledge.  I'm sure he would provide you one if you wrote him, however.

The modification is easy, and requires only a minor rewiring of the relay and 
switch connections.  If you don't have access to Up-Fixing der Porsche, drop
me a message and I'll see that you get a copy of the article.

Gary

Gary -
     Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately I don't have access, so far
as I know, to Up Fixen der Porsche.  In fact, I'm not really familiar
with what that is, to be honest.  But it sounds very useful - does it
come with membership in the POC?
     Maybe if you could just summarize in e-mail what rewiring of the
relay needs to be done, I could figure out the rest on my own.  Also,
if you could tell me generally where to look for the relay, that would
help.
     Also, if you have the address of Allen Caldwell, I would
definitely be interested in getting a copy of that 914 technical
article index.  

Thanks again for your help!

Jeff

I had the misfortune of having alternator problems on my 911 which I
fixed by purchasing a freshly rebuilt one.  My car had about 130K miles
on it.  If the alternator's old and it makes noise, in my opinion, you'd
be best served by taking it in for a rebuild at your local generator shop.
If you don't, you stand the chance of installing the old one, just to have
it fail a short while later IMHO.

***************************************************************

Sean,

I recently replaced whatever oil was in my 915 (transmission) 
with SWEPCO ($50/gal).  Didn't make a bit of difference. :-(

I have to be careful going into first and reverse also.  I usually 
put it into second before going into first or reverse.  Otherwise,
I need to let it sit a few seconds (5-10) with the clutch in before 
putting it into those gears.

I also have to be careful on the first to second transition, strangely
enough, I don't have to be as careful on the third to second shift.
When I described these symptoms to one of the other local 911 owners, 
he suggested that it might be a clutch "hot spot," i.e. clutch not
disengauging completely.  At this point, I think it's just worn 
syncros.

However, I did replace the clutch cable.  Until this time, EVERY time
I have replaced a clutch cable (cars or motorcycles) there has been
a large improvement in the clutch action.  Nada.  Didn't make a bit 
of difference.  This could still help you, I would remove the cable
and check the action, clean, lube (or replace).  Oh yeah, I did
find it necessary to lubricate the new cable (unusual).

If you try the redline, please post your results.

I have the same problem on an 83 911SC.  It is worn synchros by
everyones account I have talked to.  I too have to try reverse, or
another gear to get it to go into first sometimes.  This stops one of
the shafts which allows it to go into first more easily.  This is a
chronic problem on 911 trannys.  You CAN NOT force the shift, you just
have to wait for the synchros to do their thing and when the are worn
it gets very bad, especially into first and the first to second shift.

My 911 has 202000 miles on it and I've used swepco in the trans and I
have abused the first to second shift doing stop lite racing against
Detroit iron.  At times it takes 30 seconds of fooling around to get
it into first.

Just one of the things to love/hate about 911's :-).

Subject: Shifting


It seems this gets brought up at least every other month (i'm not
suggesting a FAQ or anything)...

Sythetic Oil in 911 transmissions is fine - it will make shifting a
little harder but will generally preserve the components better since
it "clings" to the metal more than normal oil.  

Everyone should be shifting into first before they stop, double-clutch
into first and then sit at the light/sign with your foot on the
clutch.  The pressure-plate and throw-out bearing, which this
technique will reduce the life of, is far far easier to replace than
the synchros, which this technique will increase the life of.

 _All_ the sheet metal on the 914 motors is essential to 
 proper cooling. You leave it off at your motors risk.
 This info, I have from a couple of successful 914 racers
 and my shop.

 Additionally, the right-side one (wear the cables run)
 is very useful in protecting your speedometer cable from
 being melted through by heat from the motor. I replaced
 a speedo cable learning this.

 Generally, I would leave parts on Porsches rather than
 leave them off. Most often, they are there for a very good
 reason.

I've had the same tranny problems on my '82 911.  I autocross the car
just about every weekend, so the more I had to shift, the worse I got
beat.  The solution.  Double-clutch.  It REALLY works.  I practiced
it every time I drove the car.  It was cumbersome at first, but after
I got the hang of it, it became second nature.  The only problem is that
people look at me funny when I bring the revvs up like I'm hot-rodding or

     Thanks for the tip.  Gary is sending me a copy of the article he
mentioned, along with a PCA application.  If it's a reasonable cost
(I'm a poor graduate student with a 19 year old metallic German
dependant), I'll definitely sign up.  I have no idea how active the
central NY group is, but I would guess with the Glen nearby, they
probably have a lot of fun.

Speaking of the Glen and PCA, there is a large PCA drivers education
event at the Glen on the July 4 weekend. It is probably too late for
you to join PCA (a necessity to participate in the event) and actually
enter the event, but if you want to come over and talk to a bunch of
Porsche fanatics and see what one part of PCA is all about, you would
be welcome. There is no entry fee (for visitors). You would need to
sign a release, but that is about it. I believe that if you show up
at the door in a Porsche, no one will ask any questions, but if anyone
asks, feel free to mention that I invited you (my name will be on their
list of entrants). The actual event is all day Sat. and Sun., but the
instructors (including me) will also be there on Friday.

I posted this rather than mailing it in case other Porschephiles who
might be within a reasonable drive of the Glen might also be interested.
The same invitation applies for them.

Peugeot also had a 404, which I believe came out in the mid '60s...

Anyway, the point was that Peugeot had these numbers reserved IN FRANCE.  
They could not have done anything in about Porsche selling 901s elsewhere
in Europe, but Porsche did not want to give up (or use a different model
number in) the French market.  I doubt Bristol ever sold their cars in
France -- don't know about BMW's 500-series models.

Thanks for all your help locating my 914 oil pressure sender, wire, etc.  I've
located the sender (it is indeed in the middle of the round thingie on the
bottom of the engine).  My problem now is that I can't find where the wire
connects.  The wire is a couple of feet long, with a couple of brackets
attached to it, with a standard 1/4" female quick-disconnect on the end.  The
wire appears to be perhaps light green (but hard to tell), and it runs in an
off-white sleeve (that contains only this wire).

Can anyone supply more details?  I can't find anything for the brackets to

*************************************************************************

I routinely double clutch every car I drive, every time I downshift.

When I started autocrossing, a new dimension got added:  Double clutching
AND heel-toe'ing.

I had previously put in braided steel brake lines and carefully flushed 
and bled the brakes.  This provided a nice hard brake pedal, but it was 
no where near the same height as the throttle pedal.  I had to shim the 
throttle pedal about 3/4" to get the pedal height (between brake and 
throttle) correct to allow me to heel-toe easily.

If anyone wants to try this, I'd recommend taping (duct tape) a 
piece (or a few pieces) of wood to the throttle pedal to determine just 
how high you need it.  Once I determined the correct height, I cut a new 
wooden shim and attached it with sheet metal screws.

Another solution to this (at least on an older '77 911S) is to adjust the
height of the brake pedal. The linkage has a section that has right hand
threads on one side and left hand threads on the other and a turnbuckle.
This worked quite nicely and never caused any problems.

This is fixed simply. All you have to do is move one wire on the headlight 
switch. Unfortunately, I forget which wire. Gotta go dig in my notes....

I routinely double clutch every car I drive, every time I downshift.

When I started autocrossing, a new dimension got added:  Double clutching
AND heel-toe'ing.

I had previously put in braided steel brake lines and carefully flushed 
and bled the brakes.  This provided a nice hard brake pedal, but it was 
no where near the same height as the throttle pedal.  I had to shim the 
throttle pedal about 3/4" to get the pedal height (between brake and 
throttle) correct to allow me to heel-toe easily.

If anyone wants to try this, I'd recommend taping (duct tape) a 
piece (or a few pieces) of wood to the throttle pedal to determine just 
how high you need it.  Once I determined the correct height, I cut a new 
wooden shim and attached it with sheet metal screws.

You must have been reading my mind!  I've had the same problem with my
brake pedal after putting on new pads recently.  I'll try the block of
wood to get the height figured out.  Thanks.

Since we're on the subject of heel-toe, what technique do you use?
In the book Driving on Competition by Alan Johnson, he shows his
technique of placing the heel of his foot on the floorboard and rolling
the right side of the ball of his foot onto the throttle to blip.  This 
works great on my new MX-6 as the pedals match perfectly.  On the 911,
I encounter the above-mentioned problems.  I've had others tell me that I
should use the heel on the brake pedal, using the toe to blip.  How do
you people do it???

Frank -
     I appreciate the invite, but unfortunately I and the 914 will be
on the other side of the continent at the time of the race at the Glen
you mentioned.  Tomorrow I start my 9th cross country trip in that
thing (could I ask the list to say a collective prayer for the 914 -
this is always a risky proposition!)  Maybe if there is another event
at the Glen in the early Fall I could come check it out.
     In the same time frame (4th of July), there is a race at Willow

Association and a store in LA called Alfa Ricambi are having the
"Porsche vs. Alfa Challenge" (I hope that name doesn't imply *we're*
the challengers - ha!).  A friend of mine and I are going to tool up
there for that race, he in his '67 Duetto Spider, and me in the 914.
Is anyone else on the list planning to attend?

The technique of heel-and-toe is the same on all cars, but you'll often have
to maneuver your feet differently depending on pedal and footbox
configuration.  I've never driven a 911, but in the 914, I use the ball of
my foot on the brake and the right side and heel on the throttle.  In my
GTI, I use a similar setup, but I've widened the throttle pedal to
facilitate this.  Without it, I use the toes/ball on the brake and the heel
on the throttle.  In other cars, it's heel on the brake, ball on the
throttle.

You'll just have to try it a few different ways to find out what works
best.  Note that if you have particularly wide, narrow, long, or short feet,
what works for someone else might not work for you.  I have a 7.5 AA men's
foot -- shorter than average and *very* narrow.  People with particularly
wide feet (you know, 14 EE) might have trouble hitting only one pedal
sometimes, while I occasionally find my foot slipping between the two.
Heel-and-toe is a very personal subject...

Ooof! The 911 has the pedal arrangement that ORIGINATED the term "heel and toe",
what you do is put the toe end of your foot on the brake pedal and use the heel
to mash the gas pedal, down near the floor. Works just as well on Type I
VW's.

I thought I was the only person in the world who used this method on
Type I's!  It really helped to rev match the old bug given how far
apart the gear ratios are.

In my 84 GTI I use the "Heel-on-the-brake" method.  

When I went to a 1/2 day Jim Russell Driving School "teaser" at Laguna
Seca they were insistent that we use the "Big Toe on the right edge of
the brake, right edge of the foot on the throttle" method.  
This was fine given the extremely tight pedal set up on a FF, but my
size 11.5's had trouble.  I could practically operate all three pedals
with my right foot!

Also, since I have always driven synchro cars, my heel and toe-ing
efforts have always been for fun, not necessity.  As a result, I would use
the rev matching technique simply so that when the clutch re-engaged
in the new gear the revs were already correct as opposed to the engine 
suddenly having to adjust to the new gear ratio...  In the Formula Fords,
of course there was no synchros and the technique was necessary  to change
gears--the shifter *would not* move unless the revs were perfect--well
maybe you could deselect the higher gear but there is no way you could 
engage the lower gear.  After the gear was engaged, the guys at Jim Russell
said to just dump the clutch and not worry about maching the revs to the
new ratio...  probably they knew there was only so much we could handle at
one time...  now that I think of it, they had us heel and toe-ing but not
double clutching.  My guess is that in the full 3 day course they would
have had us double clutching as well.  In a 1/2 day teaser course we
were lucky if we could keep from blowing engines and spinning off the
track to say nothing of double clutch heel-and-toe-ing

I'd hate to see the bottom of the gear box of the Formula Ford I drove
that day... :^)

On my early 911 (67), I found that the "side-by-side" technique where
the left half of the right foot works the brake pedal and the foot rolls
to the right for the "blip", with the right side of the toe pushing the
gas, worked quite well. That is for size 11C shoes, and, as Mark mentioned,
different techniques may be required for other size feet. Also, I believe
that the pedal details have changed in 911's over the years, which may
also force the use of different techniques. By the way, the same technique
worked fine in my 914, and works fine in my current 944S, after some
tinkering with the pedals.

On the subject of different techniques, I wonder about the alternative
of using the heel on the brake and the toe on the gas. I haven't spent
any time working with this technique, but it seems that it would be
inherently harder to effectively modulate the brakes at the adhesion
limit with the heel, as compared to the toe. Are there any accomplished
race drivers out there, or does anyone know of any, who brake with
their heels? Perhaps I am putting too much emphasis on the racing/track
driving aspects of Porsche driving- I suspect that the either technique
might be fine on the street (unless you need to stop quickly -:) ).

Yeah, it's OK, but you can't quite get the gas pedal to the floor that way,
while if you heel the gas pedal near the hinge, you can excercise its entire
travel while threshold braking... (if you need to)

> That is for size 11C shoes, and, as Mark mentioned,

11C? Those are small feet - mine are 12.5 EE or so (actually none of the
standard sizes fit...) and I can often cover all the pedals I need with
one foot.

> different techniques may be required for other size feet. Also, I believe

Indeed - the roller pedal that was used for the earliest of 911 and some
Type 1 cars is rather hard to heel - I took it off and put in a later pedal
cluster. This of course is not recommended if "keeping it stock" is important.

If yoou practice it enough, you can get good at it. I found the other
way around to be a lot easier to get my foot at, so that made the difference,
but this way sometimes is the only method that works, too - it depends on the
feet, pedals, and footwell layout...

How is that possible?

Why would you double-clutch a car?!

I can understand it with my '66 911 that the 1st and 2nd gear synchros have
since long departed, but on a car with good synchros, it is more of a
hiderance than a help. And what kind of auto-x's do you attend that mandate
a shift? Are you driving a car with a super large ring gear that puts
the spread between very small (e.g. an auto-x specific car)?
I love auto-xing my 911, but have never had to shift. Then again, around
here (S.F. Bay Area) the spots we get are pretty small and hence we get
pretty tight courses.

My two-bits worth.  It is my understanding that both the brake and clutch pedal
heights in 944-series cars can be adjusted.  I think the same is true in the
Carrera's; MFTM adjusted a client's C4 a few weeks ago before she went to her
first driver's ed event.

I haven't changed mine largely because I cannot make up my mind.  At the track,
the brake pedal tends to be buried a lot deeper when I want to heel-toe,
compared to street driving.

I have size 8.5 feet.  I originally tried heel-toeing with the right edge of my
foot on the accelerator, ball on the brake.  Didn't work - getting you foot
stuck between the pedals at the end of a straight is, uh, exciting.  So I have
switched to using the top of my foot on the brake, rotating the heel over to the
gas.  I put my foot higher up on the brake for this than I would otherwise, to
get my heel high enough up on the accelerator so that I have fine enough
leverage.

I have a set of OMP pedal plates I plan to install soon.  The big hope is that
with the much wider accelerator pedal plate, I can go back to the easier,
original technique.

It might sound silly, but I have found choice of footwear important
too.  Nice wide runners or similar makes it much easier, although
you can then end up blipping or braking unintentionally!

This is in regards to the shifting problem on the 915 tran.
Last night I tightened the clutch cable by 1/4 inch and what
seemed to be a syncro problem is now gone.  See, when I had
the clutch pressed all the way, I think it was still engaged
but not strongly to move the car (please let me know if i'm
b.s'ing).  But seriously, that's how it felt.  Now, after the 
adjustment, the clutch pedal has to be about 2 inches from the
floor (as opposed to ~0 in. before) before the car moves.

Also, somebody mentioned that the 911 syncros need some friction
to operate correctly.  I heard the same thing from my mechanic.
He said any lighter(?) oil would probably damage the syncros.

As promised, here is a note on how to rebuild a 914 alternator.

Sorry about the line length, but I'm too lazy to fix it...

Alternator Alternative
by Mark Gohlke
Maverick Region

lt seems a shame to me to replace an alternator just because it does  not work any more.  lt 
is even worse to replace one when it is still working, but needs something like bearings 
replaced.  This article specifically addresses my experiences with two 1970-74 914 
alternators, but the comments will generally apply to other models as well.
One of my alternators was suffering from the effects of exposure to the elements and needed 
it's bearings replaced.  The other was old and had apparently been apart before.  It needed 
itUs bearings and  brushes replaced, and was missing a spring washer which belongs behind 
one of the bearings (footnote 1.).  The parts to repair the alternators were surprisingly easy 
to come by, and cost MUCH less than two replacement alternators (rebuilt $130).  Almost all 
bearings are made in standard sizes by bearing manufacturers.  Companies like Bosch who 
make alternators, etc, purchase these bearings to use in their products.  Thus, whenever any 
bearing needs to be replaced - whether in an alternator or somewhere else - the chances are 
very good that the bearing is available at your friendly local bearing distributor.  The same 
goes for oil seals.
These are the parts I found to replace: - Front bearing, part number 6203-z.  $9.00.  The -z  
refers to the seals on the bearing.  They come open, shielded, or sealed on one or both sides.  
The manufacturer's name will also appear, but is not important.  The bearings in my two 
alternators were from Peer-Romania, Fafnir, and Delco -- Pear bearing, part number 6201-
z.  $7.00. -- Brush assembly, part number 021-903-503-A.  $23.00 from your VW/Porsche 
parts man.  This part contains the two brushes and guides mounted to a plate which  also has 
the terminals which plug into the car's wire harness. -- Washer  kit, part  number 02 1 903 
220 $6.00 from your VW/Porsche parts man.  I needed this to get the large spring (wavy) 
washer which was missing from alternator number two.  The kit also contained a spacer, 
some flat washers, and two screws.  None of these parts should really have to be replaced 
unless they are missing.  No doubt the rectifiers can be replaced, but l won't know as long as 
luck is with me.
To disassemble the alternator, first mark the orientation of the two halves and the back 
cover.  The pulley has to be removed to get the front bearing off, so it may as well be done 
first.  The pulley has some slots in it to enable you to hold it to get the nut off.  It will then 
come off easily with a puller.  Remove the back cover, and then remove the long screws 
holding the alternator housing together.  Now the two halves will come apart, although they 
may take some careful prying.  The wide iron ring which divides the two housing halves is the 
stator and must stay with the back (large) half (it has wires connected to it).  The rotor will 
stay with the front half.  Now the bearings and other parts can be removed and replaced.  
Note the bearings are a light press fit onto the rotor.  Use of the proper tools is helpful here.  
Your friendly mechanic, machine shop, or some parts stores can help if necessary at this 
point.
I found that the wires connected to the commutator rings on both rotors were physically 
separated from the rotor.  They had obviously been glued down when they were made, but 
presumably centrifugal force had separated them.  Reposition and rebond the wires if 
necessary.  You may have noticed the ominous sound of the brushes springing from their 
guides as you separated the housing, and sure enough they appear to be blocking all hope of 
ever getting the alternator back together again.  They have to be held out of the way for the 
back bearing to get past them to put the housing together.  This is done by carefully pushing 
the brushes, one at a time, back against the spring until you actually push the brushes out the 
back of the guide slightly.  At this point the spring will go from pressing on the back of the 
brush to pushing on the side of the brush, holding it nicely in place for assembly.  After the 
alternator is assembled, the brushes may be snapped into place one at a time.  They are 
accessible through a hole adjacent to the connectors for the car wire harness.

1.  See page 123 of the Haynes 914 manual, or the factory shop manual for an exploded view 
of the alternator.

Subject: Steering Wheel Removal/Replacement

Removing the steering wheel on an early 944 is easy.

You need a 24 or 28 mm socket (I forget which) probably on a half-inch
drive socket with a 3 inch extension.

First, remove the center cushion.  Use your fingers to get between the
cushion and the wheel itself.  Depending on the wheel, it has either
three or four retainers (they kind of clip in).  This takes a good
amount of force to pop them loose, but it will work.

Next, mark the relative positions of the steering wheel and the
steering column.  I use a punch to notch the steering column at the
point which is the center top of the steering wheel.
Make sure that you do not mark the nut, because, after all, it will
not be attached to the column when you re-align the wheel.

Next, remove the  ignition key to lock the steering column in place.

Use the aforementioned socket, extension and ratchet to loosen and
remove the nut.  Watch out when the nut loosens; if your ratchet
handle is too long, you just might break your windshield.

With the nut and washer off the column, the wheel should slide
off easily.

Replacement is left as an exercise for the student.

Be a little careful about popping the center pad off the steering wheel.  The
retainers are hard plastic and can crack if you generate any shearing motion
when removing the pad.  I once got one side of the pad loose 'unexpectedly'
(it does take a bit of force to pop it) and sort of ripped the other two clips
off.  Since the clips also hold the springs for the horn in compression, the
pad just sort of dangles on the wheel if any one of them is broken... boo

Subject: 944 horn (was Re: Steering Wheel ...)


There have been some good discussions on removing the steering wheel 
without damage. I believe that the original poster mentioned that the
problem was that the horn only honked with the steering wheel in 
selected positions. This makes me think that the problem is related
to a problem a friend of mine with an 84 944 has. His horn never
honks, and we have tracked it to the lack of a ground to the splined
shaft on which the steering wheel mounts (the horn button connects
the nominally grounded shaft to a wire, which then is connected to the
horn through a slip ring which you see when the wheel is removed).
In looking at my friend's car with the steering wheel and the various
turn signal and wiper switches removed, it is not very clear how the
steering shaft is supposed to be grounded. There appear to be some
concentric copper-looking rings where the steering shaft enters the
steering lock assembly, but we don't at present see what wipes against
what to ground the steering shaft. We did verify that if we connect the
steering shaft to the lock assembly temporarily with a clip-lead,
the horn works fine. Has anyone had a similar problem, and found the
solution?

   turn signal and wiper switches removed, it is not very clear how the
   steering shaft is supposed to be grounded.

*IF* it's the same design as the 914 and water-cooled VWs, then it's
grounded through the steering shaft bearing.  No kidding.  When your
bearing wears, you're SOL, horn-wise.

Sean,

Yes, your solution makes sense.  Although earlier 911 syncro's tend to go away, a problem with first and reverse is likely to be a clutch freeplay adjustment problem.  This is the adjustment you described.  Many supposed transmission problems are actually clutch adjustment problems in disguise. 

There is one more clutch adjustment on most cars, called the pedal travel adjustment.  I recommend you break out the books and do both adjustments to make sure things are right.

Subject: 911/912 Workshop Manuals

I have a '66 912.

Has anyone purchased the 911 or 912 "workshop manuals"?  I recently
bought a general 912 manual and its okay, but, not very specific.
I want *details* about every little/big thing on the entire car.

A friend of mine has a set for his 'vette and they show every
nut, bolt, plate, etc. for the entire car.  This is what I need.

I would appreciate any reviews/comments on available manuals.  Its hard
to judge what the various companies have to offer from their
product descriptions.

Thanks,

Why would you double-clutch a car?!

I can understand it with my '66 911 that the 1st and 2nd gear synchros have
since long departed, but on a car with good synchros, it is more of a
hiderance than a help. And what kind of auto-x's do you attend that mandate
a shift? Are you driving a car with a super large ring gear that puts
the spread between very small (e.g. an auto-x specific car)?
I love auto-xing my 911, but have never had to shift. Then again, around
here (S.F. Bay Area) the spots we get are pretty small and hence we get
pretty tight courses.

**************************************************************************

Dave, 

My experience is that the syncros last longer if you double clutch.  
When you consider that you are not requiring them to do as much work,
this may make sense.  I've never owned a new car, so...  Most of them
have had one bad syncro that needed to be "helped."

Most auto-x 's don't require any gear changes (once in second, anyway).
However, some do and if you want to be able to get into first w/o nasty
grinding noises, I recommend practicing.

My observation is that one does autocrossing what one during daily driving,
i.e. you revert to what is most familiar when under stress.  So...
I double clutch on the street, I heel-toe on the street, and I use the an 
auto-x hand technique ("Zarcone" (sp!) method) on the street.  Sometimes 
I'll even late apex, but that's rare, since the turn-in isn't necessary 
and **really** feels strange unless I'm at speed (not to mention what it 
does to your passengers).

Actually, I checked last weekend, and I only D.C. about 70% of the time.

Philip -

Hi there.  The tech bulletins are available as either an expensive subscription,
by which you get them "real time" as issued.  Or in year-end compendia, for $20
to $30 a pop.  The part numbers are:

  Book  Bulletin Issue Date  Part No.     Date
    A   Prior to 11/84       PNA 000 056  10/87
    B   11/84 - 12/85        PNA 000 028   1/86
    C    1/86 - 12/86        PNA 000 055   1/87
    D    1/87 - 12/87        PNA 000 062   1/88
    E    1/88 - 12/88        PNA 000 076   1/89
    F    1/89 - 12/89        PNA 000 082   2/90
    G    1/90 - 12/90        PNA 000 082A  2/91
    H    1/91 - 12/91        PNA 000 082B  2/92

The Service Bulletin Index is PNA 000 018D, dated 3/92, and is a very handy
pocket-size index to all bulletins through 12/91.

The part numbers and title pages would lead me to believe that they are
published by PCNA (Porsche Cars North America), not PAG.  I am certain that a US
dealer's parts department would be happy to sell them to an overseas customer. 
I asked my parts guy (Mac Mackenzie at Clair Parts Express, Dedham MA, fastest
fiche west of the Elbe), and he would be happy to have your business.

The "Upfixin der Porsche" series is published by the Porsche Club of America
(PCA).  What we do is, every few years, collate all the technical articles from
our national mag into a new volume.  You can buy these volumes from Ruth Harte
and the friendly folks at our national office: 703 922 9300, eastern time.  The
articles are aimed at club members, rather than professional mechanics, and are
generally a lot more accessible.

As ever, I'm happy to forward to you photocopies of anything that will help you
with your sunroof.

Ron,

I have both the 911 Factory manuals (Vol 1 and 2) and the full 914 Factory manuals.  The Factory manuals are great, although the translation is sometimes a little shakey.  The procedure on CV joint reassembly is a good example of this.
The factory manuals are very expensive, however.  The primary difference between factory and all other manuals is the discussion of why and how things work.  The factory manuals also have more detail on the procedures.  They assume you have the specialized tools, however, whereas Haynes manuals sometimes give suggestions on work-arounds for folks that don't have the tools.  

The best place to just see parts breakdowns is in the factory parts manual.

I also use a Haynes manual and I have a Chilton's manual for the old 911's.  Haynes is much better than Chilton's and is small enough to keep in the car for emergencies.  The factory manuals are a little large for that.

Just a piece of info that may or may not be relevant to the solution
of this puzzle.  A few weeks ago I had to replace the steering rack on
my '86 951.  One of the steps in this operation was the removal of a
small ground wire that electrically connects the rack to the
crossmember (although the rack bolts to the crossmember, it rides in
some rubber bushings).  It is pretty hard to imagine that this could
be the ground path for something as important as the horn circuit,
since the current would have to go through the universal joints on the
steering column, which does not seem like the most realiable
electrical connection (i.e., the connection might be better in some
wheel positions than others, depending on how the pieces of the joint
are making contact, dirt in the joint, etc.).  Nevertheless, if it is
not obvious how the column is grounded, that would seem to make
grounding through the rack a possibility to explore.  You might check
for continuity between the column and rack, then rack and ground.
Since the rack is supposed to be grounded and the column bolts to the
rack, I would think this should be *a* ground path, if not the main
one, for the horn circuit.

Let us know what you find,
-Milo

I'm looking for data on failure of 944 steel front control arms.  I know of two instances where folks have told me that they experienced this failure on the race track.  What I want to know is:

- How long do we expect the steel control arm to last on the track before failure?

- Where does the failure occur?  Is it possible to detect an imminent failure visually before it happens?

- What can be done to strengthen the arm to preclude failure (other than the obvious change to the cast arm)?

- I understand from a reliable source that the cast arms have their problems also.  Any information on the failure of cast arms or ball joints would also be appreciated.

Don't be afraid to respond with only partial information.  Anecdotal replies are welcome also.

If you look at the "package shelf" which replaces the +2 seats in the 968,
you'll notice an ideal location not only for a full factory workshop manual set,
but all the tech bulletins as well!  Such forethought, such inspired design.

Message-Id: <QA350D40@mamarat>

The local(Northeast) chapter of the PCA recently had a 944 tech
session at a local independent repair shop and the subject of
horn grounding was mentioned. I believe that, in fact, the
u-joints in the steering do ground the horn and can cause the
horn to malfunction when they(u-joints) become loose. It was also
mentioned that the grounding wire occasionally becomes disconnected.

Don't wait.  Replace them before going to the track.  If you need PCNA doc
backdating or whatever SCCA rigamarole requires, let me know.  (Did the same
last year for someone out west who wanted to put Carrera tensioners in a car.)

Usually in the really fast downhill sweeper.

I know that there is a tradition of welding up reinforcements to 911 and 914
suspension pieces, and see no reason this couldn't also be done to steel 944
arms.  Not sure it's worth the bother.

>- I understand from a reliable source that the cast arms have their problems

The wear-items with which I am familiar in the cast front arms are the eventual
wear of the ball joints (non-replaceable) and the bushings at the trailing point
(replaceable).  I am not familiar with any catastrophic failures, except for
Dick Howe's shattered spindle last year (extreme car, extreme case).

           Greetings all,  I am nearing completion of a full bodywork
  restoration of my beloved 914.  Nearing is the key-word...

    What I could really use right now is a front trunk floor pan...
    Not the full-size part, just a patch the size of the air conditioner
  condenser -that no longer resides there.  I could fabricate the part,
  but it would not be exact to oem.
    A rusty part would be acceptable, even if it has holes in it, I can 
  refurbish it (i have gobs of practice at patching holes now), but i cant
  fabricate the whole thing.  And dont you know how much fun die forming
  with a ball pein is?
    
    If anyone is interested, i will have a body rotisserie for 914's for
  sale here shortly... can you say 'in position welding -on a 914'?

    If i get a response, i will give the floorpan dimensions.    -kyle

  Hello, I am trying to avoid making an expensive mistake...
   Has anyone out there had any doings with the chassis stiffening kit
  (weltmeister) for 914's?
   The kit consists of 8 peices of FLAT steel with punched out holes for
  welding onto the body in strategic places that are known to flex under
  stress.  Half of the stiffening plates require some shaping and forming
  to the body contours -not a problem.  But why, oh why would someone want
  to pay nearly $200 for flat steel (0.055") with a few holes in it that
  has to "heat and beat" to make fit?
   Has anyone got a pattern for these peices, or does anyone know the
locations
  on the body these will be placed so I can fabricate from my own dimensions?

   After doing over my rusted out 914 body -flat sheets of patches is really
  easy to do with my air nibbler.  There have been many times where i had to
  make a funny shaped patch to repair a panel or segment that was either too
  expensive, or was not available.  Repairing a body this way was like 
  constructing a 914 from postage stamp size bits of steel.  I am quite sure
  that i could build a 914 from a box of factory parts and do the job quicker
  than i did the restore.

    Could someone please respond to this?  I just got on to this special
   group and i am not sure that what i send out is actually getting out!

I think the best picture of how this stuff gets installed is in
Volume IV of "Upfixin' Der Porsche" from PCA. And that's a pretty
shitty picture of Richie Ginther's car from the early '70s. Brett Johnson's 
guide to authenticity has some pictures but not clear ones.

You might be able to get some additional help from Automechanika since
they sell a pre-formed trailing arm stiffner kit and don't believe in the
old heat and beat method...

Personally, for the street car, I decided that it didn't need reinforced.
The track cars, I triangulated,one with sheet steel gussets, the other
with chromemoly tubing. Big win. Highly non-original. Sigh.

How about 911 trailing arm repair kits/stiffening?  I noticed Stoddard
has a kit for $250.00 per side.  If its just a "heat and beat" then it
would not appear to be worth the money.

Does anyone else make these kits and have experience with them?

hi there!  i finally got off my duff and subscribed to this list.

any other 928 owners out there? especially those who work on their

of the heater core/air conditioner assembly.

also: i'm going to have to put a new clutch in mine soon, and i'd 
really like to upgrade it to the single disc clutch of the '87 and

does anybody know anything about this upgrade, or know anyone who might
know which parts have to be swapped.

Kyle,

I don't see why you would want to put a chassis stiffening kit in the car unless you are going to spend lots of time on the race track.  I have been racing and maintaining two 914's in a class that does not allow chassis stiffening or triangulation and have not found a major problem with it, contrary to what others say.  I did experience cracking in the area over the rear suspension on the right side, but  I think that had more to do with an airborne assault on one of the guard rails at Lime Rock that left me in the middle of the track with the rest of the field about to run over me.  

I recently had the opportunity to inspect a reinforced trailing arm.  I'm sure it wouldn't break or bend, but you would not believe how heavy it was.  Certainly the trailing arms bend, but the fix is simple - change the trailing arm when you can no longer achieve appropriate camber or toe settings.  I average 1.5 seasons per trailing arm replacement, with a season consisting of nominally 12 races.  Of course we don't use slicks, but the sticky tires we do use are capable of rather high cornering loads.

My advice - save your money, don't buy stiffening kits unless runnning in EP or a GT class (or using slicks), and have a set of spare trailing arms around.

Kevin,

I guess my ability to store manuals will have to wait until I can afford the money for a 968.  Until then, they'll reside in the back of my pickup.

By the way, My article on driving NHIS in this month's Nor`easter was written before my last trip there on May 25.  Between April 26 and May 25, the track management made several changes to improve safety.  The 'mini-runoff' I mentioned has been deleted and most of the gravel area outside of three has been paved.   Berms have been installed on the inside and outside of 12.   The paving of the runoff outside of 3 was a major safty improvement since now if you run wide in 3 you still have some surface to slow down on that's paved.

Just the thing to make a PCA safety chairman happy!

Subject: Pumped up

Hi,
   I want to get some info on 944 water pumps for a friend of mine.
His water pump broke, leaking a lot of coolant last weekend. He wants
to know what is the best solution for the repair? The choices seem
to be the following:

1) New water pump with update kit
2) Refurbished pump with update kit
3) New or refurbished pump.

Is it worth getting the udate kit if he is not planning to
keep the car for very long? How much should the repairs cost?
BTW, the local dealer is back logged for the water pumps for
at least 2 weeks here in Montreal. Apparently the last order
of refurbished pumps were defective in having an impeller that was
too large.

On another note, after switching from Castrol XLR 20W50 to Mobil 1
15W50 oil, my fuel mileage has increased dramatically. It went
from about 450 KM per tank to about 550-600 KM. I think it is due to
the fact that I take short trips where the engine just begins to
warm-up and the thinner Mobil 1 has an advantage. I have also
installed the Cambermeister on the front shock towers and would
like to know how to adjust them for the best handling?

Cheers

Sugi

Subject: Watkins Glen '92 (was "cracking" disk rotors on 951)
Cc: attmail!rbartlett, mtqub!rgb@att.UUCP

Well the microcracks in my disks lasted through 2 days of Watking Glen
abuse (about 3 hours of 140 to 90 MPH stops). I plan to replace them for
peace of mind (if for no better reason). Where is a good source of new
disks? Also, I've heard that there are a couple of different manufacturers;
some are better than others. Which are the good manufacturers and how can
you tell the difference? The car is an '86 951.

On a related note I thought people would be interested in knowing what
changes have been made to Watkins Glen for '92. The short answer is "none,
yet." So far this year the changes at the end of the back straight have not
been used for any races or track events. The work on the new section is
still being completed, however, and the grandstands have not been built.
The general, unconfirmed, feeling was that the new "suitcase handle"
(right-left-left-right) section might only ever be used for Nascar, GTP,
and other highly modified races (ala Lime Rock's modified course). In any
case if this section is ever used its entrance is very tight (one car or
two "half cars" with wreckage) and very slow (40MPH, if that, for "street
cars"). The exit is very near turn 5; there would be no way to reach
maximum speed in Turn 5 (~90MPH) until the middle/end of the turn.

Subject:      Air Conditioner

In conversations with Gary Cooke, (otherwise known as the president of the
West Coast 931 Owners' Support Group),  ;-)   we have discovered a flaw in the
A/C of our 931's. I expect it occurs in other models also. When the A/C is
turned on, the fans which cool not only the engine coolant, but also the A/C
condenser, should be locked on full speed. (With the A/C switched off, the fans
rely on a thermal switch to power them on as needed).
If they do not switch on with the A/C, the high pressure side of the freon
system will pop up to EXCESSIVE pressures when the car is not moving and the
fans are not running. Exploding refrigerant lines, can prove exciting, as Gary
has attested, especially if they are inside the car. (Much like a shot gun
going off beside you).
Both of our 931's developed leaks at the sight glass/receiver. Is there a
commonly occurring cause for this problem? ie. any particular relay that
frequently fails or other electrical weak spot? ken.

Subject: 951 front swaybar bushings

The front swaybar on my '86 951 shifted sideways during each run session
these past 2 days at Watkins Glen. The left end would "almost" come out of
its bushing while the right side would bury itself in its bushing. It is a
factory 25.5 mm swaybay from an '87 951 that I installed this winter. The
car used to have a factory 24mm swaybar and was run all last year without
any problems. The suspension, with this swaybar is identical to the '87
Sport suspension option on 944s. I used all the correct bushings and
changed the inner clamps to the slightly larger diameter ones specified for
'87 and later cars.

My question is how to stop this??? I am assuming that '87 and later
swaybars should be able to be used on '86 cars? Was there some other
modification between those years that I'm not taking into consideration? I
know the hub offset was changed...

My idea is to use urethane for all four bushings based on the assumption
that some deformation of the rubber is taking place on the bushings to
allow this to happen. Any ideas???

Where can one find urethane bushings for stock 944 swaybars?

Subject: dash lights


recently, i discovered an interesting phenomenon with at least one
of the "idiot lights" that can appear on a porsche 928 dash.  when
brake failure occurs, a relay is tripped and the "brake press" light
comes on.  simple enough, except that the relay remains tripped as
long as there is power to it.  in order to reset the relay, you have
to pull the battery cable.

for those keeping score at home, i related a tale about "the bearing
bummer" at about this time last year in which an inner wheel bearing
had broken wreaking havoc and trashing a brake caliper (catastrophic
brake failure).  after fixing things, the light remained on, and i
posted several questions to the list asking for advice on what to
check.  thanks again to one and all, and especially milo, without
whose help, i'd still be walking.  it turns out, all i had to do was
pull the battery cable.  so, i think we have finally reached the happy
ending of a long story: i no longer have to look at the big red "!" and
"brake press" lights while driving...  cuts down on embarrassing
questions, too.  :-)


cheers,

bert

	Just to add that, according to my Haynes manual, the correct torque
is 45Nm.

	When I took the wheel off my 944 to get at the washer switch, I
put it back slightly crooked. It really annoyed me, but still it was
several weeks before I got around to fixing it :-)

Re: the changes to watkins glen.  Is the new chicane past the number 4 brake

I have raced there the past two years at the SVRA event and not found the 
 corner to be particularly hazardous, but I was braking around the 2 marker,
not the .5 as another car in my group did.

There appears to be more than one "conventional wisdom" on that subject.
I believe that some racers believe that reinforced versions of the old
steel arms are fine. My recollection is that the school cars (944) used
by the Akin-White racing school use reinforced steel arms.

Bob Strange (successful SCCA racer of 944 Turbo's) claims there is a
catastrophic failure associated with the new arms, where the shaft of the
ball joint fails where it enters the strut. You can (and should, if you run
many track events) loosen the clamp on the strut and slide the ball joint
shaft out a bit, and look for cracks in the shaft.

The interesting part is that you can't replace the ball joint separately
in the new, cast arms. Therefore, we have moved from periodic replacement
of a relatively inexpensive steel arm to periodic replacement of a
relatively expensive cast alloy arm (in Bob's opinion).

Subject: It was bound to happen...

Well, the other night I was awakened at 4am to the sounds of my 87 944S'
alarm going off at full blast and the squeal of tire rubber. It seems that
some nefarious people had managed to get into my car by prying open the
sunroof, and breaking out the lock cylinder without setting off the alarm.
They then proceeded to adjust the seats and turn the ignition switch.

That set off the alarm (thank God), and they went right out the sunroof.
Probably looked like toast popping out of the toaster...

Anyway, it seems that there is a chink in the Porsche alarm system, ie 
prying open the roof. While they could not take the car, the thought tha
any moron with a screwdriver can get into my car without setting the alarm
really bothers me. Is there a way to link the auto alarm to the sunroof
switch? Is the sunroof that easy to pry open?

If not/so, what is a good alarm system that will stop the thief before he 
gets into the car?

Subject: RE: It was bound to happen... 

I'm sure you have heard it before......If someone wants your car bad enough,
no alarm is going to stop them.  That being said, there is a lot you can do.
Some of the things I've learned since my Sciroc was stolen 6' form where
I slept.
1) Never get an alarm with a delay. Even 30 sec is enough time for most people
   to get past most alarms.
2) Battery back-up is a good idea.
3) Try not to mount the alarm brain in an obvious place like under the dash.
4) If you park your car on the street at night, get an alarm that flashes the
   lights or one that has a small $5 strobe that you can mount under your car.
   I've seen a car alarm with one of the strobes and it was very noticeable
   to say the least.
5) The best option I got with my new alarm is a "field sensor". I have it 
   hidden in my ash tray and it will trip the alarm if anything comes within
   about 3'. So even if you have your sunroof off and someone just reaches
  into your car the alarm will go off. Most likely you can retrofit most alarms
   with this sensor, and they only cost around $100.

If you need more info I'll dig out my receipts and find out exactly who makes
the field sensor.

Reply-To: vwp@cbnewsk.att.com


So far I've been unable to find the cause of a strange problem on the '73
914 I recently bought.  Whenever the key is in the on position, I can hear
the relay clicking at the one-second or so intervals, under the dash.  This
is whether or not the motor is running.  Both the turn signals work properly
when activated, including the little arrows on the gauge, and the hazards
are also okay.  What else could be causing the relay to operate?  The only
thought I just had is that if the button under the emergency brake was
broken and the red light above the gas gauge was burnt out, it could be
trying to tell me the emergency brake is engaged.  I can't test this until
the car comes back from some welding work later this week.  Any other
possibilities?  Thanks.

Instead of adding a switch to the sunroof, you might look into getting a
motion sensor.  I have one of these in my convertable.  Its adjustable for
area, I have it set so that you can touch the windows, but if you bat the
roof or stick something in the read window the alarm goes off.  I don't have
a shock sensor or a glass break microphone, since its a convertable, just
the radar motion sensor and switches on the doors, trunk and engine.  Very
few false alarms this way and when it goes off I know someone is inside.
The best part is I can leave the top down and the alarm will still function
the same way.

Mark,

My 74 914 does the same thing.  I've never taken time to fix it, althought I believe that either the problem you mentioned or a problem with the brake failure sensing switch (or a ground in the line to the switch) on the master cylinder is the cause.  My brake failure warning lite flashes constantly.  Honestly, in one of these cars, if you need a light to tell you the brakes have failed you shouldn't be driving a Porsche.

Subject: Solex Carbs.....


At the Stoddard swap meet this past weekend, I had lots of opportunities
to BS with all kinds of enthusiasts.  One conversation in particular
related to Solex Carbs.  He mentioned that to properly adjust the
floats, you need some kind of $90 float adjustment tool and...... 

He recommended the following:
	1.  take carbs off car.
	2.  construct a 1/2" in diameter 7'2" in length hose and connect
		it to the gas input
	3.  fill this hose w/gas
	4.  adjust the float using the $90 fload adjustment tool.
	5.  reinstall

Allegedly, he says you need the 7'2" hose to put the appropriate
amount of pressure on the carb to adjust the floats correctly.  I
can only imagine him filling that hose in his basement in the
winter, think of the fumes!  He also said the carbs are soooo sensitive
that 1mm off can make the car run hot (too lean) or flood (too rich)?
Further, he also said you cant adjust them on the car.

Okay, so what gives?  Is this guy nuts, or did I get some
great info.  I'm having enough trouble getting the gas tank out (rust
on this ridiculous piece of sheet metal underneath the gas tank)
to get it rebuilt, I really dont want to start making a 7'2" hose up
when I rebuild the carbs next month.

Thanks,

Ron


By the way, my car is a '66 912 with Solex Carbs.  The swap meet was
great, got a fender ($120), steel wheel ($20), and all kinds of stuff
from Stoddard (shop manuals, brake cyl rebld kits, etc.), and saw
lots of great examples of old 911/912s!  Stoddard people were also
very helpful with body work questions.  As for this guy in the
story above, hopefully you all can help me assess his value.....

His story is essentially accurate, but there are other ways to handle
this. I had a jig set up with a 5 gallon plastic fuel cell (from another
project), an electric fuel pump and an adjustable pressure regulator.

And a funny little piece of metal that looked like an intake manifold
mounting flange welded to a piece of angle iron.

Bolt carb to bracket, install bracket in vise. Hook up gas plumbing
and turn on the pump. Adjust pressure regulator to correct value (depends
on application). Pop top on carb, adjust float level. Viola! Done.

Some Weber and Dellorto carbs are similarly sensitive. Particularly the 
Weber progressives. Bleah. This is, by the way, akin to adjusting the
pressure monitor on an FI car. You wouldn't complain about having to 
do that, you'd just do it. So, just do it.

If you're not somewhere outside of the US, ignore this message. I've

I need a warmup regulator for my '81 Euro 911SC. The Bosch part number

I also need some Euro check-patterned interior cloth, the funny stuff
where the size of the squares varies depending on where on the cloth
you are, so it gives sort of a parallax effect making the seat back look
*really* deep. In blue velour.  For the two front seats.

I need the warmup regulator a lot worse, needless to say. If you can
help, please let me know.

Thanks,

I have the same problem with my '75 911.  It also makes the emergency brake
indicator blink but not as brightly as when the emergency brake is
actually on.  The intervals are the same as the turn signal.

Is this a bad relay?  
I understand the master cylinder has a switch on it.  Could that be screwd up?


Thanks.

Stan -

You moved a decimal point, which made looking up the part take five minutes
instead of 30 seconds for my friend the Bosch CSE!  The original part on an '81
Euro 911SC is 0438.140.069, not .039.  The .039 part was likely substituted
during federalization because it chows less gas, keeping those all-important
numbers down.  This was a pretty common thing to do in federalizing.

The original part (.069) is available.  List is $300, but a cheque for $225 sent
to Jerry will liberate one for you.  Send it along to:

  Jerry Pellegrino
  European Performance Engineering
  10 Cochituate Street
  Natick, MA  01760
  508 651 1316

Mention my name and the part number.  I have no financial interest except as
limited to keeping Jerry in the black so's we can go to track events and split
hotel room bills...

By the by, Jerry is a Bosch CSE and can apparently lay his hands on otherwise
hard-to-get Bosch parts.

Indeed.  There must be something pithy that can be said about my knowledge being
more conventional than wise!  I have no first-hand experience with the steel
arms or their failures.

True.  I saw stamped steel arms listed for <$30 today, aluminum for >$300.  It's
also the case that polyurethane bushings are not available for the front
944-series suspension with the new arms.  I called Automotion today.  They are
developing them, and the bushings should be available in a few months time.  The
original rubber bushings at the trailing edge of the control arm (where the
caster is set) deteriorate with age.

I don't know about the original Porsche factory bars.  With the Weltmeister
front bar, the "correct" clamping solution is to go to Radio Shack and get a
couple of TV antenna mast clamps, the kinds with a threaded U-shaped rod and a
saddle bracket.  The hose clamps which Weltmeister/Automotion gives you aren't
up to the job.  The Radio Shack parts have the correct yellow chromate finish to
go with the bars!

Christopher -

Sorry to hear about this.  You can certainly integrate the sunroof into the
factory alarm circuitry.  There is a "roof closed" microswitch.  It may take
adding a new relay.  I'll try to puzzle it out with the wiring diagrams it as
time permits - I don't have a quick answer.

It is also possible to gets the car's lamps to flash with the alarm horn.  In
fact, this was an option added in MY 89, option M484 if memory serves.  I have
just about finished upgrading my '87 944S factory alarm to this option by
acquiring the relay, socket, and connector pins from my parts guy (Mac at Clair
Parts Express).  It's a simple matter of taking the strobed (except in
Switzerland - no joke!) alarm signal from the alarm control unit, and using it
to drive the new relay.  The relay switches the fog lamps and rear parking
lights.

In fact, the (almost) last piece went in this evening after I was given the
weird female pin used in the relay socket for the small (2.8 mm) male pins - a
miniature version of the four-tonque, spring-type connectors used in the CEB
connector blocks.  I'll get its part number from Mac tomorrow and should then be
able to write up a how-to article.

I've never heard if anyone bothering to go in through the sunroof before.  Since
the windows are not alarmed, most thieves will just punch the driver-side
window.

Subject: Weltmeiter Chips

I managed to have a Automotion 11th catalog via the french "Mecatechnic".
In this catalog is proposed a Weltmeister chip for different Porsches, 
writing those give an power increase of about 15% to 20%.
I only use my 944 85.5 on the road and in town, but I would like to
have much more power sometimes.

I would like to know different things :
	- is it "true" for these 15% ?
	- how is the power, how is the torque with this chip ?
	- is it safe for the motor ? (any experience welcome)
	- is it easy to change for an "amateur" mechanic as I am ?
	- the price proposed to me is 2600FF, about 500$ (not knowing
			the exact change rate), is it OK or not ?
			
		Thanks a lot to all of you.
		
	Charles.

I am in the process of replacing a few broken head studs and 
performing a top end rebuild to my stock 80 911SC at a friends shop. 
He told me he thinks he can get a good deal on some 3.2 piston
and cylinders :-). 

Is there any drawback to putting in the 3.2s besides more $$$$$?

What class at a PCA autocross would I have to run in?
Modifed SC class or with the Carreras?

Would it be competitive with the Carreras?

One other thing is the motor has 71,000 miles on it and shows
very little wear on the inside.

Subject: Rollbars again

Whilst calling around trying to find a deal on a bolt-in Autopower (AP)
roll bar for my 944 turbo, I talked with a dealer who said he refused to
sell them any more since there had been a couple of recent failures (as
I understand it, the AP bar is made of chrome-moly and is harder (hence
more brittle) than cold rolled steel and when it reaches its stress
point, cracks rather than bends. I assume that AP uses CrMo for weight
savings (anyone know how much lighter than a steel bar they typically
are?).

I've also seen ads for bars by Saftey Devices, but don't know anything
about the company and the quality of their product. AP has a good
reputation among the drivers I hang out with.

Should I be worried about this? I'm just running club driving schools --
no racing (yet), though I do plan to run the Walter Mitty at Road
Atlanta this fall.  A custom steel bar is going to run me about $500
(installed), whereas I can pick up the AP bar for about $300 and install
it myself ("with a little help from my friends").

Any suggestions for where to find a good deal? Best I've found so far is
about $240+ shipping ($70-80).

    (as I understand it, the AP bar is made of chrome-moly and is harder
    (hence more brittle) than cold rolled steel and when it reaches its
    stress point, cracks rather than bends. I assume that AP uses CrMo for
    weight savings

interesting.  AP's race equipment _must_ be mild steel, or else it'd
be illegal in most SCCA competition classes (all, perhaps?)  this would
be the full cage, and the roll bar that is convertible to a cage as well.

    I've also seen ads for bars by Saftey Devices, but don't know anything
    about the company and the quality of their product. AP has a good
    reputation among the drivers I hang out with.

Safety Devices is considered at least a little nicer than AP in the
circles i'm familiar with.

Subject: 3.2L Upgrade

When I rebuilt my 911SC engine, I wanted to get the 98mm pistons which
would have given me 3.2L. Besides the fact that they are expensive, the
only drawback for me was the fact that the heads need machining to
accomodate the cylinders. I found this quite surprising because the
911 Performance Handbook never mentioned this fact. I found out by
inquiring at Andial for the P & C set. I did not want to machine the
heads in case I needed to revert back to the 95mm pistons.

In the end, I went for the 9.8 CR 95mm pistons and am happy with the
results. I figure I have around 200-205 HP with these pistons and the
SSI exhaust in my 79 911SC. I reckon with the 3.2 conversion, you can
get around 220 HP and much better torque. Can anyone else comment if
the heads really do need machining?

Cheers

Subject: Re: Rollbars again

Steve Tynor asks about roll bars for his 944.

My personal opinion is that a roll bar is only an incremental  
improvement over no protection.  Based somewhat on personal and  
anecdotal evidence, but mostly on professional experience with  
materials and structures (I have a PhD in mechanical engineering), I  
would suggest going all the way to a roll cage.  A roll bar will only  
protect you from some rollover accidents, will not protect you from  
most rollovers where the front of the roof is impacted, nor from side  
or front impacts.  Recall those accidents you've seen at the track  
and ask yourself whether you'd rather have a roll cage or roll bar in  
each case.

For a relatively heavy car like the 944, I would suggest following  
the SCCA recommendation of 1.75" x 0.120" DOM tubing of mild steel.   
Alloy and/or heat-treated steel tends to be more brittle as well as  
stronger, as well as being more difficult to weld correctly.

I have a roll cage from Kirk Racing Products in my 944 SCCA ITS race  
car.  It cost about $465 and was delivered about 10 days from when I  
placed the order over the phone.  The tubing is DOM mild steel, 1.75"  
dia by 0.120" wall, and it is legal for all SCCA and PCA stock  
classes.  It is relatively unobstrusive, requires no cutting of  
interior trim (other than carpet) and the door bar can be easily  
removed for street driving if you wish.  I don't drive my car on the  
street, though.

Call (205)823-6025 and ask for Al.  He will know my name if you  
mention it, though I have no relationship with the business other  
than as a satisfied customer.

Concerning Safety Devices Roll Cages:

I've seen two Safety Devices Roll Cages for 914's.  It makes me think that someone at the company either can't read, or didn't thoroughly read (more likely) the SCCA GCR.  The cage they were selling for the 914 did not meet GCR requirements in that all components of the cage were not made of the same tubing.  The rear supports are flat tabs that bolt into the shoulder harness holes vice tubing as required by SCCA.  I don't have any problem with the stength of the cage, but it's a hassle to have to pay good money to modify an already expensive product to comply with existing rules.  The funny thing is, if you call Dick Martin at SCCA, he'll tell you that the cage is OK as is, but won't give it to you in writing.  I modified the cage to comply with GCR.

The moral is - whenever you buy a product for racing, don't take anyone's word that it's legal without verifying yourself.

Sean,

I was deficient (and was reminded of it) in not mentioning the master cylinder switch.  Certainly if the brake failure switch is defective such that it's always shut and can't be reset, then the light won't go away.  As was pointed out, most of these cars have a reset for this switch located under the rubber grommet on the master cylinder, beside where the wire plugs in.  To reset, just push in on the little plastic point sticking out.  It should stay in when reset.  
In my car's case, the light flashes even when this wire is unplugged, which prompted my comments.

as near as i can tell, there are two different types of
Safety Devices cages, one which meets the GCRs and one which
is marginal (some european standard, perhaps?)  there are
a few IT drivers here in the northeast who are running the
GCR legal cages in the NARRC series without serious modification.

Where are the rollbars cracking and, more importantly, under what

strength than your plain carbon steel like 1020 to 1040.  It is not
that it is lighter per se, but you can use less and get the same
strength, or use the same amount and get higher strength.  As for
cracking rather than bending - yes, generally the higher strength
steels will not deform as much as the lower strength steels before
ultimate failure.  Without knowing any of the important details, I
think this cracking info needs to be treated like a major league
red flag.  I would not want to buy one until I knew enough about
what is what.

Some things that could cause cracking that come to mind:
1.  They used 4140 (or higher C content material) by accident and their 
    welding process left some microcracks that were just waiting to 
    open up at an inopportune time.     :-(
2.  They screwed up the welding very badly (of course, the cracks
    would need to be at the welds for both of these scenarios.....)
3.  The users really hit something superhard and the structure
    deformed and failed (hard to believe but possible).

If it is your life at stake, I'd spend the bucks to get something that
you are *sure* is going to work.   My 2 nickels worth..............

4130 is also passing out of fashion in roll cages; i don't have
the GCRs in front of me, but as i recall, while 4130 cages are
grandfathered in, i don't think that new ones are allowed past
tech these days.

I had the black/silver wheels on mine and I decided to paint the crest also.
I used the "Humbrol" enamels (for models) as I have used them for other

Just hot water washing-up liquid and scrubbing, that will remove any grease

|3. What are the Porsche colours? I know that they are black, red and
|gold, but are they particular shades or hues or whatever of these?

Now you are asking, I forget the paint "numbers" ;-) They are just red, black
and gold. One thing though, after about 1 year after painting I found that the
gold was wearing off. Then I realised what I should have done when I finished
painting was to have put a "clear" coat over the paint when I had finished. If
you do this it will last much longer.

Another hint too, buy a VERY VERY small brush it makes life much easier.

Hi-

Maybe the answer is obvious, but not to me....

My mechanic's just put the head back onto the 81 931 after replacing the
cam$haft.  He cranks the beast, it runs fine for 10 secs, then dies.  Does
this repeatedly (it never had starting problems before).  He's trying to
run this down, and says that he's getting no spark.  His guess is a Hall-effect
sensor.  I suspect that he's pulled something loose while removing the head.
Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks!

Is there any drawback to putting in the 3.2s besides more $$$$$?

Modifed SC class or with the Carreras?

Would it be competitive with the Carreras?

One other thing is the motor has 71,000 miles on it and shows

Greg,

Anderson's book (911 Performance Handbook) doesn't mention any drawbacks.
Sugi mentions that the heads may need machining.  I haven't heard this 
from anyone else, but I don't know anyone that has done this mod.

I drive (auto-x) in zone 7 (ggr) in IP (one class up from stock).  If I 
remember correctly, you are allowed (in IP) to make your car 
"functionally equivalent" to others in the model range.  Since the 3.2 
carreras are in the model range (i think) and use the same transmission, 
you could probably (worst case) carry some extra weight to ballance things 
out.  Of course, these are zone 7 rules and your mileage may vary.

I think there may also be an allowable displacement increase for IP, in
which case you may be okay w/o any extra weight.

You definately will not be able to run as "stock."

If you don't buy the p/c (or more than one set is available) let me know,

Any suggestions for where to find a good deal? Best I've found so far is
about $240+ shipping ($70-80). 

***********************************

Try I/O Port in Berkeley, CA.  I think their roll bars start about $200.
The business is run from a desk in the corner of another business (I don't
think this guy's rent is taking too big a bite out his gross ;-)).

I can't remember what full cages run, but all his prices seemed very 
reasonable.

I don't have the phone number, but the area code is 510 so you can
call information (510-555-1212).

Boy! People on BOTH w2w and porschephiles are getting a hefty share of 
info on roll bars aren't they?  Notice how many of this message you got.
The info is worth reading twice though :-)
I'm going ot check out the place in Berkely.

Cc: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu

Nathan,

These are my recommendations for trying to eliminate a vibration in the steering wheel at 65 MPH.  For the porschephiles, any other comments on this problem (with which I am nearly totally unfamiliar) would be appreciated.  Car is an 85 944.

- Have wheels dynamically balanced (currently only statically balanced)

- Swap fronts to rear and check for change in problem

- Ensure front wheel bearings are properly adjusted (at the tight end of spec)

- Check for play in tie rod ends, ball joint or strut attachments (or anywhere else)

- Ensure toe is properly adjusted, consider slight increase in toe in

Other recommendations:

1) Check out Upfixin Der Porsche (Volume VII, I believe) which has
   recommendations for wheel alignment to minimize this type of
   vibration.  I seem to remember that that the caster get changed to
   +2.5 degrees.  That change made a big difference in sensitivity
   to this problem on my car.

2) Have absolutely, positively, zero-tolerance round wheels and tires.
   No matter how well they are balanced, if they are the least bit
   out-of-round, your steering wheel will shake like crazy.
   This includes flatspots from braking.

3) This problem was supposed to have only been really noticeable
   on early 944s, without power-steering.

4) Don't drive 65 (drive 85 or 90, like God intended you to!)  :-)

Subject: Momo steering wheels

I'm ready to buy a Momo steering wheel.  Looks like I probably want a Veloce,
black leather, in the smaller diameter.  But I'd settle for the Porsche
Design wheel. :-)

Anyone know of a good cheap source?  Cheapest price I've got so far is $200
including hub, but they don't have the smaller size in stock.

I'd also consider used wheels.  If anyone has either of these wheels laying
around and they'd be interested in selling, please let me know.  I'm settled
on a three-spoke black leather, metal spokes.  I'd consider a used Monte
Carlo, but would prefer a Veloce or Porsche Design.

If someone has a Veloce or PD and would be willing to trade for some other
used wheel, let me know...  Perhaps we can arrange something.

Subject: pca zone 7 rules on 911sc 3.0 to 3.2
To: porschephiles@karazm.math.uh.edu


I brought in my rule book (pca zone 7) to check the effects of the 3.0
to 3.2 conversion (95 to 98 mm p/c) on auto-x classes.

Production:

"Cars may be converted to the specifications of another model within its 
model range provided that the converted car is functionally equivalent to 
that model.  Functionally equivalent is defined as being identical
in areas of engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, weight, and other
performance-affecting items."

The 3.2 carrera produces 207 hp; the 3.0, 180 hp.  I believe that the 
brakes and suspension are the same.  Both use the 915 transmission.  The
SC weighs about 2750 lb; I don't know the weight of the 3.2.

The model range is "911 1978 on," the next model range is the carrera 2,
so both are in the same model range.

So, for zone 7, you would have a good chance of staying in production
as long as your car weighed the same as a 3.2 (or carried extra weight?).


Super Production:

Cars that are production but have additional modifications (allowable
mods are specified).  One of the mods is: "Non-stock pistons and/or 
cylinders, with up to a 5mm increased bore."


If I interpret the rules correctly, you would be production if the car
weighs the same as a 3.2, and super production if it is lighter.

There has been recent discussion on the "Zone 7 rules".  I therefore assume
there are no nationwide PCA rules?  How do they handle it at the national

Anyway, I'm in Zone 1 (I think).  Upstate NY.  How do the classes work here?
Where would my 914 fit?  It's got lower, stiffer springs, stiffer torsion
bars, plastic suspension bushings, short-shift kit, 15x8" wheels with
205/50-15 R1's, and this winter I plan on replacing the fuel injection with
some other injection system.

Thanks for the help...

I'm curious about which injection system you're considering?

Like out of another car?  Will the car be streetable too?

Not straight out of another car, no.  I don't know yet.  There are numerous
aftermarket possibilities, like Haltech and Weber, though the Weber system
is currently only for American V8's.  Then there are more generic systems,
like Bosch Motronic and LH-Motronic.  I prefer these because they are
pulsed, and because they also control the spark.  However, converting these
to work on the 914 will probably be challenging, as a result of (1) the
number of inputs, and (2) the difficulty in changing the computer
parameters.  I don't happen to have a PROM burner handy, though there must
be one around here somewhere (I *do* work in an EE department!)

I discussed the idea of taking one out of another car recently with someone
else.  This is generally unfeasable.  The problem is that things like intake
shape, injector size and performance, engine size and performance, cam
profile, you name it will affect the parameters of the injection system.
You've got to be prepared to change *everything*, from the computer itself
to the injectors, intake manifolds, throttles, everything.

I suspect that the "former dealer" was doing sour grapes. I recently

was that it if anythingwas on the heavy side and probably over built. I didn't
think it was chrome moly but I didn't ask.

You might call them to check the weight and material. Our local "IT guru"
discussed running Autopower bars in IT-cars with me and his comment was
that they were a bit heavier and clunkier then custom cages. He didn't
say anythin negative about their strength.///dickn

are you sure? I thought chrome I read that chrome moly was legal in SCCA and
that they allowed you to run a thiner wall tubing if it was moly.

Subject:What rims and tires for my Porcsh 944?

My 944 is reaching 37,000 miles on the original tires (215x60x15VR).
I am thinking about to get 16" rims and tires which I think are more
desirable. I plan to spend about $1000 or more on them. I have found a set
on "Road and Track" for $729. They are MSW Type7-16"s (16x7 205x55ZR
for front and 16x8 225x50ZR Yokohama for back wheels). I am not so keen
about this package, 'cos most of MSWs are too cheap. Do you know what is
the most popular rim set for Porcsh 944? Please help!

I was curious cause I have driven a 914 2.0 with europeon specs motor using
the original injection system that was a blast to drive.  The car was
fast, economical, and reliable.  

The injection system in the 914 I have now is a little tired but still 
functions well.  

Maybe the injection system that is on there now can be modified to be
computer controlled to improve the old design?  At least you wouldn't
have to start from scratch?

The limit on the stock Bosch D-Jetronic (914 1.7 and 2.0) is not in the
computer.  I know of people who have put a Haltech computer in and kept
everything else the same, and saw minimal gain.  I don't know where the loss
is, but it's not in the computer.  Probably in the air intake; that would be
my guess.  Possibly in the fuel delivery system itself -- D-Jet is a
high-pressure system, and is prone to fuel leaks.  I dunno, but I definitely
want something else.  Something low-pressure, something individually pulsed,
something light and simple to work on (once it's in), and preferably
something that also controls ignition.

Subject:What rims and tires for my Porsche 944?

Ed, if you ever plan on running a track event anywhere in the
Northeast, DON'T USE AFTERMARKET WHEELS.

The track chairs and the zone safety chairs are pretty much in
agreement that Porsche factory wheels (and perhaps BBS)
are acceptable for the kind of driving that we see.

If I may promote my favorite set of books again (Upfixin der Porsche),
there is a great picture of an aftermarket wheel which has had the
center broken out of it.

If you're never going on the track, never going to drive more than
55, never going to hit a pothole or a curb, then MSW wheels are exactly
what you need (but put them on your Mazda Miata, not your 944)...

(My personal experience with MSW wheels goes back 9 years, when I
bought 4 to replace wheels on my Audi coupe;  Two years later, I
bought 4 BBS wheels, which stayed on the car for the next 7 years.
The MSW wheels were almost as susceptible to bending as the original
Audi cast wheels....JUNK!)

Do it right the first time, or don't waste the time or money doing it
at all.  Original 15 inch wheels are better than junk 16 inch wheels
anytime.

The Appendix C in the Solo I and II book about roll bars says:

"...seamless, ERW, or DOM mild steel tubing.  Chrome alloy such as 4130 is not 
recommended since the strength of the area adjacent to welds will be impaired 
if the structure is not normalized, and because of the difficulty of making 
satisfactory welds."

Charles -

I think that the answer depends on how much you are willing to pay for the
performance increase.  In turbo-charged cars, the chips can typically make a
very big difference.  They can also make a big difference in the longevity of
the head gasket, etc., if done improperly.  In normally-aspirated cars, the
gains from aftermarket chips seem minimal, from my own experience and from all
other credible reports.  (Dissenting opinions are sought, anyone?)

I put an AutoThority version 2.5 chip in my 944S only because someone spent a
lot of money on it, then decided to sell his car.  The new owner didn't want the
chip, so the original owner sold it to me for a lot less.  There seem to be
plenty of people in this situation - I would recommend that anyone looking for a
chip try first to find a "used" one.  I checked with AutoThority before
purchase, and they were happy to transfer warranty and upgrade privileges to me.

If you do decide to get the chip, go with a known product that other people have
already successfully used.  AutoThority is such a product, although there were
problems with earlier versions of their stuff.

If you are not handy with electronic devices, and even if you are, it's probably
a good idea to have a knowledgeable friend help you install the chip.  Wear a
static-discharge cuff while you do it (or wrap a wire around your wrist and
connect it to the DME box - same thing).

But I would really recommend that you first spend this kind of money on:

  - driving schools,
  - tires,
  - sways bars,

and probably a number of other items before moving on to chipping the car.

Nathan -

Also check over the brakes and rotors for warping (is the vibration mostly when
braking or all the time?).  Gary's list is pretty complete.  Check the condition
of the bushings.

Consider getting a nice set of original forged alloy take-offs from Robert Wood,
who advertises in Pano and Excellence.  I have bought two sets from him and am a
happy customer.  Much cheaper than what Porsche will charge you for them, of
course.

Qua NER Safety Chair, I second what George said about acceptability of
aftermarket rims at the track.  There are certainly a lot of good rims made by
companies like BBS.  There is also a lot of dangerous garbage, it would seem,
being packaged and sold.  The imitation Fuchs five-spokes he refers to are a
case in point.

As far as legality goes, it's entirely up to the region to decide.  They often
pattern their classes after the PCR's.  The Parade Competition Rules (PCR's) are
used for the annual, national meet.  They are, uh, far from perfect.

A lot of regions make up classes and decide legality based on the population of
local cars.  For example, we (NER) created a class this year just for Carrera
with a popular set of modifications (twin-plug, etc.).  We have a bunch of
people who had this set-up, who wanted to autocross, but were discouraged at the
thought of being dumped into a catch-all class.

Example: my 944-series car is entirely legal in NER, legal at the Zone and
National levels if I change my rear tires, and is totally frowned upon for any
of a long list of reasons in SCCA competition.

Subject: 914 Injection System

  The 914 injection system is more easily modified than the newer CPU
based systems. The 914 injection system is an analog computer that uses
resistor values and an amplifier to vary the pulse width for the injectors.
  If you vary the resistor values, to change the pulse width, you can change
the fuel delivery curve. The fuel delivery curve can be modified to compensate
for larger displacement, full race cams, an enlarged throttle body and etc. 
  The only short coming are the points in the distributor which can be changed to hall affect to improve reliability.
  In short the tools required to modify an analog computer are a lot less expensive and easier to change than the CPU systems. Oh I forgot to mention that the
electronics in the 914 are circa 1965 design practices, long before 8 bit micro
processors.
  I would be interested in knowing if any one else in this mailing has modified
the stock 914 electronics????

Have Fun

Subject: 914 flasher relay - solution
Organization: AT&T Network Systems
Reply-To: vwp@cbnewsk.att.com

Last night I found the solution to the clicking relay in the 914.  After
looking more closely at the wiring diagram, the emergency brake contact
switch (which has been removed from my car by a previous owner) seemed
to be connected directly to the light on the dash and then across the
light to get to the flasher to activate it.  So I pulled the gauge with
the fuel level and big red lamp on it, and disconnected one lead from
the lamp.  Now the thing only clicks when necessary.  And, like Gary
says, if you need the warning light to tell you your brakes are bad, you
shouldn't be driving a Porsche.  :)

Subject: Fuel Injection


Hi there. Sorry for the delayed response, but I'm on the Digest list, not
the "immediate" mailing list. For any responses, please include my email
address in the CC list. Anyway, I seem to remember having a similar
discussion on W2W not too long ago. I ended up using the Electromotive
system for several reasons.

1. It provides both injection and ignition.
2. Both VE and spark advance tables can easily be programmed through a PC.
   In addition, you can have several different tables stored on disk, each
   with a different setup and specs, and download whichever one is
   appropriate.
3. For a similar system it's much cheaper than the Haltech and certainly
   than the NOS system. And from conversations I've had with users of
   Haltech, they had lots of problems with it. Please remember, however,
   that this is only according to two Haltech users. It could be that they
   didn't know how to use it properly, that they had different expectations
   from it, etc.
4. I don't have the new version, but there's an article in the latest Turbo
   magazine that describes it. It has charting capabilities, and
   closed-loop tuning. This can make life A LOT easier, believe me.

The only problem I had with the TEC-II unit, as it's called, is that the
reference manual that comes with it is far from clear. Actually I don't
think that there was any direct correspondance between the manual and the
system that was shipped to me! I have to say, though, that they had lots of
on-line help in the program, but to me it's not the same as having a manual
in your hand. Take care.

- Have wheels dynamically balanced (currently only statically balanced)

- Ensure front wheel bearings are properly adjusted (at the tight end of spec)

- Check for play in tie rod ends, ball joint or strut attachments (or anywhere else)

- Ensure toe is properly adjusted, consider slight increase in toe in

I don't remember the original post, but...

Nathan, 

If you are using Pirelli P7's on the front, this may also be a function
of your tires.

I road tested a 911 a few years ago and it had a front end shimmy at 
about 65-70.  Since I knew very little about the car then (now I 
know enough to THINK I know something... ;-)), I spoke to Clark 
Anderson (at Garretsons), mentioned the front end problem, and the 
FIRST THING he said was: "What tires are on the front?".  Seems that
there is a problem with the belts (plys?) delaminating (?) internally
on the P7.

Subject: chips

18 June

Charles,

Hello.  Regarding chips for 944:  I put an Autothority chip in my 1985.1.  I
can say only that I LOVED IT!! I found that there was noticably more torque
which made both part-throttle and full throttle operation MUCH more pleasant.
I can't tell you quantitatively how much  more power/torque there was, but
I can promise you that it was very noticeable.

I had absolutely no reliability problems, nor any trouble. There is 1 very
important caveat, though: you MUST use gasoline of high-enough octane
rating, or you will get destructive knocking. The 944 chip requires you to
use high-octane gas, versus the low-octane which the un-chipped car uses.

I think the chip is very easy to install even by an amateur.  You remove the
electronic brain from the car with a screwdriver.  You then can take it
indoors and open the brain with a screwdriver.  You GENTLY remove the stock
chip by rocking it a little and/or prying it up with the blade of a
screwdriver, and pop in the new chip. As long as you are CAREFUL and GENTLE
there will be no problem. You then close the brain case and put it back in
the car. Lastly, you drive away with a big smile on your face. 

Implementation suggestion: Put high-octane gas in the car in advance of the
chip conversion, so that you will have only the good gas in the tank!

A friend of mine is considering the purchase of a 1987 951. Does anyone
have any tips on specific things to look out for, and what improvements
were made to the model after that date?

I threw out all the messages about different front A-arms (having an old
911 (*for sale*) myself), but as far as I remember, this isn't relevant
since the Turbo always had upgraded suspension bits.

The car in question has very low mileage. Any worries on that score?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Covers

Folks,

I just bought a cover for my '90 944 S2, mostly because I was tired of
cleaning bird droppings off it, but also because I plan to keep this car
forever (which is just short of when I'll have it paid for) and I'd like it
to look nice.

Now, of course, I'm paranoid about when to cover and when not to cover:

In the rain?  Then do you have to dry out the cover before you put it on
the car next time?  Would it stop water marks?

When the car is dirty?

When it's sort of windy?

When it's really windy?


And (worrying early) in the winter?


Finally an extra points bonus question:

What about bras?

Thanks.

Leonardo,

The most cost effective track time you can get is the PCA Driver's Education Program.  For less than about $70 per day you can get instruction in your own car at the significant race tracks in our area.  If you are not a PCA member, let me know and I'll get you an application for Northeast Region.  I need your address to do so.

Greets,
 
I am looking at a 70 911T and was wondering if anyone has any comments 
and/or misc information on this particular model.  Unfortunatly I have 
not been able to look at it real close but I do know this much about it:
 
   It is a 5sp
           Webber Carbs..
          
Other than that, there is nothing out of the ordinary about it.  Any
comments/warning are requested. 

Thanks

Kevin

Chris -

I have a cover which I use except in the winter.  The car gets driven
year-round, but with salt and sand, covering in the winter isn't practical.  I
use the cover, like you, for bird poop, sunshine, and as a theft deterrant. 
(Question: if you're a thief with a lot full of swell cars, would you waste time
on the covered car?)

I think the cover's a Technalon or whatever it's called, sold by Imparts.  I
haven't had any problems with scratching or from wind, other than getting it on
and off.  Light rain doesn't penetrate it, but really heavy rain will leak a
bit.

I also use a bra.  I had two Colgan three-pieces, now have a Porsche bra and
it's unquestionably the best design.  (From the manufacture and markings, I
think Colgan makes Porsche's bra for them.)  The key is keeping dirt and grit
from between the bra and paint, otherwise you're worse off.  I vacuum it out
every time I take it off to wash the car.  It seals against water pretty well,
so I have found it not necessary to remove it except after driving in heavy
rain.

One hint is to slip small squares of flannel cloth between the bra and the car
at its stitching next to the topmost side clips.  I am not sure whether it is
because of invaded grit or the stitching, but without the flannel scraps I get
scratching.  I got this idea from a 911 owner friend who had the same problem
over his fenders.

I've modified the bra.  It is only available with a license plate cut-out, into
which I stitched a piece from an earlier bra.  I also cut out pieces to allow
air into the dam where it gets fed to the Holbert Cool-Brake, rehemming the
edges with hemming material from the earlier bra.  Piece of cake, structurally
copacetic.

re the 70 911T

they are pretty nice cars and with some rejetting the performance can be
increased substantially.  the 2.2 is a nice motor and pretty reliable.  if
you need more power later you can always turn it into an S.  BTW, it is
VERY desirable to get a car with S instruments and brakes, this can save a 
lot of money later.

a nice one, needing nothing should be around $10-12K.  Ones needing attention
could be 4-5,000.

He has been unable to locate a set of the Webers.  Any ideas where to look for

Leonardo,

Hello again. In reference to driver's schools, and depending upon the state
of your wallet, I strongly recommend Skip Barber. They have many sessions at
Lime Rock in Connecticut.

There are 'drivers' schools, where you use their BMWs, and 'racing' schools,
where you use their Formula Fords. I have attended both, and they are both
tremendous fun and very useful. The very best part is when you take the
downhill top speed in the Fords!

PS:	For readers not located near Lime Rock, Skip Barber has schools in
	many other locations.  They can be contacted at their Sharon CT,
	headquarters.  There are also many other schools, such as Roos,
	Russell, Bondurant.

Kevin,

I'd be primarily concerned about two things - rust and engine.  These cars have lots of rust problems.  Pay special attention to the front, where the front of the A arms bolt to the chassis,  the battery boxes and spare tire well, the rocker panels and the area where the rear torsion bars enter the chassis.

I think old 911 prices are depressed, so you can get good value for the money.  But!! A 911 engine rebuild can run into $3000 of parts, and the cost to have it done could mean that even if you purchase a car at a great price, you could end up having much more in the car than it's worth.  I would only purchase a 70 T if the engine was rebuilt (and I knew who did the work) or if it still had lots of miles left on it.   Otherwise, the price would have to be very good.  I think a T is a fine car for daily driving or for a starting point for modification.  The 70 series is one of the lightest weight versions.  Watch for worn out transmission syncro`s.

I have a 71 E, so I'm somewhat familiar with these.

This is incredible. I can believe he has been unable to locate a used set,
or to locate a set at his preferred price point, but not that he can't find
any. Let's see: you can get these guys from Automotion, Performance
Products, Tweeks, Stoddard, and the other big aftermarket guys. You can
also go to Red Lion or to PMO for a more direct connection. PMO is the
preferred provider, and a new set of IDA403C for Zenith or Solex replacement
should be about $950. Don't have PMO's number, but they have ads in 
Excellence, Pano and (usually) European Car.

Hi - I've got a '69 912 with split shaft 40 PII-4 Solex carburetors that
I rebuilt (all new gaskets, float valve, soaked & blew all passages)
over the weekend.  After balancing the carbs and adjusting idle mixture,
the car runs smoother (smooth idle, no more acceleration flat spots, very
mild deceleration exhaust rap, smoother warm-up) than ever before.

Now for the bad news.  The engine idles at 1200 rpm with the idle speed
adjustment screws completely backed out.  I've double-checked the throttle
linkage, and it doesn't appear to be hung up anywhere.

Have I done something wrong?  How do I remedy this?

Thanks...

Hi - '69 912 here...

Does anyone out there have a Solex float level gauge that you'd be willing
to loan or sell to me?  I don't particularly relish laying down $85 for one
(from Performance).

If someone has one to loan, I'll pay shipping both ways plus $10 to make
it worth your while.  I'd need it for a week (or two at the most).

Over the last week there has been some interesting traffic on this list
regarding EFI for the 914. Since I've been doing a lot of work in my

and programmed two different systems for an IMSA GTU 911, I want to speak up
here. 

Two warnings: I'm not an expert. I've just got a lot of "seat time" in 
working on makiing EFI do strange things, and have spent time trying to
reconcile my hands-on findings with the actual physics involved so I can
repeat the performance. Second, this is going to be a *LONG* message. I'm
going to start off with a re-cap of the weeks's traffic on EFI so we all
have it fresh in our minds, then start my info at the line with "*START

113 lines from here in case that works better for you.

I'm curious about which injection system you're considering?

Like out of another car?  Will the car be streetable too? 


From: Mark Sirota <msirota@ee.rochester.edu>
Date: Wed, 17 Jun 92 13:38:55 EDT

Not straight out of another car, no.  I don't know yet.  There are numerous
aftermarket possibilities, like Haltech and Weber, though the Weber system
is currently only for American V8's.  Then there are more generic systems,
like Bosch Motronic and LH-Motronic.  I prefer these because they are
pulsed, and because they also control the spark.  However, converting these
to work on the 914 will probably be challenging, as a result of (1) the
number of inputs, and (2) the difficulty in changing the computer
parameters.  I don't happen to have a PROM burner handy, though there must
be one around here somewhere (I *do* work in an EE department!)

I discussed the idea of taking one out of another car recently with someone
else.  This is generally unfeasable.  The problem is that things like intake
shape, injector size and performance, engine size and performance, cam
profile, you name it will affect the parameters of the injection system.
You've got to be prepared to change *everything*, from the computer itself
to the injectors, intake manifolds, throttles, everything.

I was curious cause I have driven a 914 2.0 with europeon specs motor using
the original injection system that was a blast to drive.  The car was
fast, economical, and reliable.  

Maybe the injection system that is on there now can be modified to be
computer controlled to improve the old design?  At least you wouldn't
have to start from scratch?

The limit on the stock Bosch D-Jetronic (914 1.7 and 2.0) is not in the
computer.  I know of people who have put a Haltech computer in and kept
everything else the same, and saw minimal gain.  I don't know where the loss
is, but it's not in the computer.  Probably in the air intake; that would be
my guess.  Possibly in the fuel delivery system itself -- D-Jet is a
high-pressure system, and is prone to fuel leaks.  I dunno, but I definitely
want something else.  Something low-pressure, something individually pulsed,
something light and simple to work on (once it's in), and preferably
something that also controls ignition.

Date: Wed, 17 Jun 92 15:31:31 PDT
From: bobq@tc.fluke.com (Robert A. Quarterman)

  The 914 injection system is more easily modified than the newer CPU
based systems. The 914 injection system is an analog computer that uses
resistor values and an amplifier to vary the pulse width for the injectors.
  If you vary the resistor values, to change the pulse width, you can change
the fuel delivery curve. The fuel delivery curve can be modified to compensate
for larger displacement, full race cams, an enlarged throttle body and etc. 
  The only short coming are the points in the distributor which can be changed to hall affect to improve reliability.
  In short the tools required to modify an analog computer are a lot less expensive and easier to change than the CPU systems. Oh I forgot to mention that the
electronics in the 914 are circa 1965 design practices, long before 8 bit micro
processors.
  I would be interested in knowing if any one else in this mailing has modified
the stock 914 electronics????

Hi there. Sorry for the delayed response, but I'm on the Digest list, not
the "immediate" mailing list. For any responses, please include my email
address in the CC list. Anyway, I seem to remember having a similar
discussion on W2W not too long ago. I ended up using the Electromotive
system for several reasons.

1. It provides both injection and ignition.
2. Both VE and spark advance tables can easily be programmed through a PC.
   In addition, you can have several different tables stored on disk, each
   with a different setup and specs, and download whichever one is
   appropriate.
3. For a similar system it's much cheaper than the Haltech and certainly
   than the NOS system. And from conversations I've had with users of
   Haltech, they had lots of problems with it. Please remember, however,
   that this is only according to two Haltech users. It could be that they
   didn't know how to use it properly, that they had different expectations
   from it, etc.
4. I don't have the new version, but there's an article in the latest Turbo
   magazine that describes it. It has charting capabilities, and
   closed-loop tuning. This can make life A LOT easier, believe me.

The only problem I had with the TEC-II unit, as it's called, is that the
reference manual that comes with it is far from clear. Actually I don't
think that there was any direct correspondance between the manual and the
system that was shipped to me! I have to say, though, that they had lots of
on-line help in the program, but to me it's not the same as having a manual
in your hand. Take care.

*START OF STAN'S INFO*

OK, let's start off with some basic info on pulsed EFI. Think in terms of
what it is you want to do here. The goal is to have an engine which provides
a good trade between performance and drivability and economy, all of which is
of course nearly mutually exclusive 8{)

What do you have to work with, in terms of inputs? You have actual current
RPM, amount of airflow either in mass or volume (which is proportional to RPM),
manifold pressure (which can be indicative of impending changes in RPM), air
and engine temp, and that's about it. If you are talking later cars, you also
have the O2 or lambda sensor. If you are getting to do this from scratch, 
you can also add exhaust gas temp sensor, barometric pressure, fuel density,
and some other wild stuff.

And, in terms of things you can control to make any difference, you have
start time of EFI pulse relative to TDC, duration of pulse, and (potentially)
fuel presssure.

The question becomes: how to I modulate the outputs to match the inputs and
my expectation set to give me more performance? I think I've found some
answers. I've at least found an interesting way to look at the problem.

Some things to note: as the engine runs faster, pulsed EFI approximates CIS.
Think about it: as engine rotation time goes down, pulse width needed to 
deliver enough gas plus the relaxation time of the injector (time it takes to 
close) will *exceed* the rotational time of the engine. This, by the way, is
one of the reasons that injectors fire on every engine rotation, not just
on the intake rotation: its the only way to get enough gas in.

The above isn't quite true, but you have to keep another factor in mind: an
injector will flow so many lbs of gas per hour (normal measure of injector
size) if kept full open at a certain pressure. If pressure goes up, the
gas flow goes up (to a point) *and the spray pattern improves*; if pressure
goes down, gas flow goes down *and the spray becomes a stream, which doesn't
vaporize very well, and consequently burns very lean*. Moral: low pressure
isn't necessarily good. (But neither is high pressure).

To maximize efficiency, you want to burn gas at the 1:14.7 to air, which is the
stochiometric point. For maximum performance, you want to get this down around
1:12.4. Maximum economy is about 1:16 (max lean-out before detonation).

Now, the hard part: making changes to the engine, and how that impacts the
injection system. For CIS, if you can flow enough air, then to get more gas 
you have to have more fuel pressure. But if you just jack up the fuel pressure, 
you get over-rich idle since *you just moved the set-point up on a linear 
curve*. The good news is, you'll get more power on  top end. The bad news is 
you won't be able to use it because you'll have loaded your plugs up from
running over rich at idle. This is also true for D and L as well. 

So, you need something that will increase pressure under load. If manifold 
pressure approximates load, you can tie your fuel pressure to manifold pressure 
and win big here. The device that does this is called a rising rate regulator, 
and is very effective for CIS. Ditto for L-jet.

The suggestion is often made that you can change the inputs to the EFI brain
by inserting a resistor or some such in the path from the sensor. Any time
you do this, you are guaranteed to screw up some part of the RPM range. The
problem you are trying to solve is multi-dimensional and any linear input 
change may have the desired effect *in a certain range* but not through
the whole operating range.

Anyway, I can't talk specifically about what I've done on D-jet systems (yet)
because (a) it's still under test and talking would be premature, and (b) I
think I'm going to productize it. In a nutshell, though, here are the key
things I've noted:

1) if you increase fuel pressure, you must decrease pulse time at idle

2) if you don't increase fuel pressure, you starve at high RPM

3) the pulse width is controlled by the intersection of RPM and manifold
   pressure sense, with some input from temp sense.

4) manifold pressure sense is not adjustable from the factory

5) the throttle throat  has a theoretical flow rate that levels off at
   about 7000 RPM

6) a stock engine will explode at 7000 RPM if kept there very long

SInce changing the brain is illegal in the roadracing classes I live in,
I can say for the benefit of those not so constrained that I have a digital
reprogrammable replacement brain in the works that eats the current analog
inputs and controls the same old injectors. But, it's programmable against
about a dozen inputs with two maps, one for "normal" and one for "performance".
Should be connector-compatible with your current system, plus some optional
sensors if you want to add them. Not sure how much it would sell for, but 
hopefully less than HalTech!

On that topic as well: the HalTech system is OK, but very limited. There are 
only 16 RPM ranges in which you can diddle the settings. If you need more
granularity, you can't get it. They also have a *VERY* simple system that 
approximates air flow by RPM (just like D-jet!), or one that's more 
sophisticated and used manifold pressure too. The Electromotive TEC II is 
a very good system and is what we currently use on the GTU car. It's more 
flexible than HalTech. Electromotive is harder to deal with than HalTech, but 
their VAR network makes that a lot more bearable.

Anyway, I hope this makes sense, is useful, etc.

The D-Jetronic manifold pressure sensor appears to not be adjustable,
but it really is, with a little tinkering. When you look at the unit,
the end without the connector has a protrusion filled with epoxy.
Under this epoxy is a set of adjustments. The sensor actually has
several different slopes of inductance (which is the way the brain box
reads vacuum) versus manifold vacuum, determined by two separate
pressure sensing diaphrams and mechanical stops. You can adjust the
mixture at high vacuum (e.g. at idle or light load) separately from
that at low vacuum (wide open throttle), and you can adjust the location
of the transition, all by mechanical adjustments.

To make a sensor adjustable, you need to remove the epoxy. You can remove
most of it from the outside with a small screwdriver, dental picks,
etc, depending on what you have handy. You will still have trouble
removing the threaded aluminum plug, however, due to epoxy in the threads.
Therefore, disassemble the unit (4 screws on early units, drill out
the rivets and replace with screws later on later cars), and screw the
aluminum plug into the case (away from the epoxy in the threads).
Then remove the last of the epoxy from the threads. Note that the
location of the aluminum plug is one of the adjustments (my recollection
is that this is the full throttle mixture), so note its location before
you remove it. Under the plug is a screw slot, which I believe is
overall mixture. The screw is surrounded by a hexagonal indentation,
which is the third adjustment (the transition point, I believe).
You will need a special tool (effectively a hollow allen wrench)
for the latter. I made one for myself. Once you look at how the sensor
is made, you should be able to figure out what adjustment does what.

I don't know if any of this is legal in a particular class, or of any
interest, but it offers more adjustment opportunities than you would
guess at first glance.

Also, on the subject of resistor changes, there is a lot of waveshaping,
etc. done in the brain box before the pulse width is established where
you could do much more than an overall mixture change, if you wanted
to play with analog circuits rather than computer tables.

	Got in my '85 944 to drive home from work yesterday, and something
strange happened. It normally ticks over at about 950 RPM. This time
when I started it, it went up to 2000 RPM. I blipped the throttle in
the hope that it would reduce. Instead it started hunting between
(about) 1000 and 2000 RPM. The cycle was fairly fast (1 or 2
seconds). Switching off and on again, or driving around the car park
made no difference.

	Not having any tools, manuals etc. with me, I called out Brittania
Rescue (1). Their engineer came out, took one look at the car, said
"I don't know the first thing about Porsches and I'm not going to
mess about with this" and offered to trailer me home, which I
accepted.

	When I got home, I opened the bonnet ("hood" across the pond?!) and
checked that all the electrical connections and vacumn connections
(2) were tight. They all appeared to be fine.

	Then I restarted the car and it ran fine. I did about 30 miles
yesterday evening, and another 10 today and the car has acted
normally since.

	What could have caused this? Is it likely to have been a loose
connector which I tightened, or does it sound as if something is on
the way out and that this will continue to happen/get worse?

(1) Brittania Rescue (along with the Automobile Association (AA),
Royal Automobile Association (RAC), National Breakdown and a myriad
more) are organisations which for a small yearly fee (about #25 or
US$40) will attend to small faults which stop your car from running,
or will bring your car and passengers anywhere in the UK if they
can't get the car running. Well worth the money for the peace of
mind. I don't know if the AAA or anyone else does a similar service
in the US.

(2) Is it possible to get a plumbing diagram for a 944? I suspect
that it would be something like a wiring diagram, but not quite as
complex. I would dearly love to know what all the tubes in my engine
bay do!

Subject: To resurface or not to resurface?

Well It's brake time for the 944. I wanted to get some input on what people
think about resurfacing old rotors. I have a good machine shop here and I had
the rear rotors turned for $18 and they seemed to do a great job. I spent some
time with a couple grades of emery cloth to finish them off and as far as I can
tell they seem about as good as new. I know that the rear brakes only account
for about 20% of stopping power and I may not notice the difference between 
new and resurfaced rotors in the rear as much as the front. So now it's time
for the front and I wanted to see if people think it's mandatory to replace 
the front rotors as opposed to having them resurfaced and polished.

One of the reasons that I decided to do the front brakes now is that I just
had the car aligned to spec and I still get a small vibration in the wheel at
65 as noted in a previous post. AJR said 2.5 deg front camber (as mentioned in
Up-Fixin ?) would be way too much and would cause a lot of tire wear. One of
the possible causes John at AJR mentioned was a rotor that is slightly out of
balance. So I'm going to do the front brakes and see if that helps, if not
John also mentioned having the wheels balanced on the car or "spin balanced".
He says that there a guy down here that is a old master at it and has done a
number of 944's with good success. Sorry if I'm getting a bit long in the 
tooth so I guess what I'm trying to say is am I wasting my time resurfacing
my front rotors and should I just replace them and cough-up the $120/pr?
Thanks!

I don't know anyone who has milled 944 rotors.  They wear well and get replaced
when they get too thin.  The wear limit is stamped on the hub.  I think it's
19 mm for most 944's.  I dunno about the folks you deal with, but I have the
impression that much of the rotor milling done in the world is a scam.  You
should not have to have your rotors milled unless there is a problem that has
been indentified and corrected (ie, not just to treat a symptom).  As far as I
know...

I think you want toe-in and not camber to correct shimmy.  2.5 negative degrees 
of camber is indeed a lot.

The first thing anyone checks is the idle stabilizer.  It can get clogged with
soot.  You should take it out and clean with with solvent, such as brake
cleaner.

The next thing I would check is for air and vacuum leaks.  The vacuum hose
routine is described (in US cars, at least) on a schematic pasted onto the wheel
well arch behind the windshield fluid bottle.  For air leaks, I would check the
whole induction system for loose clamps, and the manifold gasket and injector
o-rings.

Both my manifold gasket and a couple of the injectors were leaking a couple of
months back.  The symptoms were a weird idle/decel initially, then on one cold
day, I could not get the car to idle at all until really warmed up.  (I used my
right foot to idle at stop lights for the first five minutes.  Then all became
fine.)

You can test for air leaks with a cup of water.  Sprinkle the water at the
suspect, and listen for a change in the engine idle as well as a sucking noise
as it is drawn in.  You'll also see the water disappear where there's a leak. 
The same thing can be done with a bottle of brake cleaner.  You'll also smell it
in the exhaust as it combusts.  Do no use a freon-containing liquid if you value
your lungs!

I replaced the gasket and all injectors' o-rings under the tutelage of my
mechanic.  No big deal, I learned, except that pressing the plastic retainer
caps onto the injectors is a real pain.  The parts are not expensive.

Hi there, 
  I'm looking at a '88 924 that a local dealer has on his lot, and 
I would like some info/advice about the car. Anyway, here are the
details that I have.
   
    Year: 1988
    Make: 924 (I'm not sure if it is a 'S' or not, what's the diff.)
 Mileage: 34,000
   Trans: 5 speed
   Other: Red,Tint, Radio/Cass
   Price: $8,500

  The mileage/price have me really interested, It sounds too good to
be true for a car the listed for $26k four years ago. I understand
that '88 was the last year for this model.
  
  What I would like to know is, what size engine is in the later 924's.
Is it still a 2.0 litre? Is there any similarities between the 924 and
the 944. 

Any advice/info would be helpful,

Subject: 88 924S

John, $8500 sounds about right for this car.  These cars do not seem
to hold their value as well as the 944 series. (Just not as sexy...)

The 924S has the 944 8-valve engine, a slimmer body style, narrower
tires and wheels, the old-style (pre-1985/2) interior, and a
marginally higher top speed.

Things to watch out for:

1) Water Pump
2) Oil Cooler leaking into Cooling System
3) Power Steering
4) Timing Belt Replacements

In fact, the original post referred to 2.5 degrees of caster (not camber or
toe). 2.5 degrees of toe-in would also be a lot. Caster is best viewed
as the fore-aft inclination of the axis about which the wheel assembly
rotates as you turn the steering wheel.

Subject: Milling 944 Rotors

Turning brake rotors may be acceptable on a street-only car, but, for
me, since I do track the car, I chose to put new rotors on when my
originals were noticeably worn.  The cost was not that significant
and I took the opportunity to change the wheel bearings at the same
time.  I feel much more confident about my brakes knowing that I have
full thickness rotors to dissipate the heat I generate at the end of
a long straight.

Although most people do not take their Porsches out into the snow and
salt, for the cars that they drive in the winter, rotors tend to rot
from the inside out (especially on vented rotors) and turning them
merely exposes metal that is closer to the rust.

BTW, the +2.5 degrees mentioned in Upfixin for the 944 vibration problem
is for caster, not camber.  There's a big difference!

It's a 924S.  It has the 944 engine, but the 924 body.
Because it lacks the wheel bulges (in my opinion, the
bulgeless design is much cleaner and more elegant), it
uses narrower tires, but has better areodynamics and a
higher top speed.  Although the suspension layout is
exactly the same as the 944, it uses stamped steel
control arms on the front instead of cast alloy.  Thus
it may not last as long on the track, but then again
it may.  Because of 944 snobbery, you can get an
extremely good deal on a 924S, and (again my opinion)
have even more fun because you're not worried about
losing a $30,000 Porsche!  _MS

Mark,

You didn't really say what the problem is.  What does the gage read -high, low, always some middle value?  The last time I had a fuel gage problem in a 914, I changed the sending unit, only to find my problem was two connections interchanged on the back of the gage.

Subject: Ignition distributor vacuum

Need some help diagnosing a prob related to the ignition distributor.
For a while, my '81 928S has been running pretty poorly, especially at
high RPM (>3500).  Well, I decided to tinker with it a little, like
checking the timing and vacuum hoses.  It seems there are two hoses that
run into the vacuum advance and retard mechanism.  The hose going into the 
retard was worn out so i decided to replace it.  BUT when i disconnnected
the retard hose, i noticed a significant improvement on the idle.  So
i figured a test drive in store without the vacuum.

It was like comming out of the dark.  THe car felt much better, especially
at high RPM.

Anyways, would anyone know why this could be?

P.S.  I have a new set of cap and rotor installed, but not 100% sure if
      they are correct for the Euro ignition distrib., parts guys seem 
      to think they are correct.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]


Hi,

A few questions on a 911.

1. What kind of gas mileage should one expect from an SC engine?

2. I think the newer 911's have a vent on the dash.  Can you cut
an opening and install a vent on an older 911?

3. I still have a problem with my engine just dying.  It happens
more often on hot days. When I drive the car for a while, let it sit 
for about 15 mins. and then try to start it up.  It starts fine then
it dies.  It does it for a few times, then it becomes normal.  It seems
to have something to do with the fuel getting hot or something.  It even
happens on the freeway and all I have to do is quickly turn the key to
off and quickly back to on to get it going again (I have to engage the
clutch while doing this otherwise it backfires, very loud).

Well,  That's all for now.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I once had this problem too.  I believe it was the warmup regulator
for the FI System.  You didn't say what year or how old.  Mine has
>200K miles on it and the FIS is getting tired and hard to get a good
tune for idle, especially across wide ambient temp swings which I see
living on a foggy coast and commuting into a hot interior valley.

So, what's the going rate for an '88 944?
How about an '84 944?

Subject: 88' 924 Maintenace Book?

Hello, I'm looking for a maitenace book for my beloved 88' 924S here in
Japan. I checked Hanes and Chilton, but there were only books for pre-82
924's. I assume this is useless, since the power unit for 924 changed at
circa 85. They say there's no such thing as Hanes book for 88' 924 nor
Chilton. Is this true? Is there any alternatives? I noticed the book
'Upfixen Der Porsche' mentioned sometimes in this list. Is this relevant
to 924? Is this written in English (not in German, I hope)?

Thanks a zillion in advance. Please mention the full title and
publisher, since I will have to order it from Japan.

John -

Any car with vacuum (dynamic) advance also has a fixed advance which is
adjustable.  I would check it.  This is usually very simple: pull the vacumm
hose off the distributor and clamp it, then use a timing light to set the
advance.

If merely changing your cap and rotor brought this one, you know where to look! 
You should be able to get Bosch part numbers off both old and new and compare
them.  Any Bosch servive centre should be able to get you the right part numbers
from their fiche set for a Euro car.

Your problem could also be due to the bob weights getting hung up in the
distributor.

Make sure you put the rotor on correctly.  Generally, they are keyed and cannot
be put on incorrectly.  (On the other hand, my 944S rotor (same as US 928S
except for longer bolts and spacers) is not keyed.  You have to remember how it
came off.  If you put it on wrong, the engine would plain not run, rather than
lose power as your describe.)

Happy hunting!

I got 21 MPG on my most recent tank, including 160 miles of, ummm, 
"spirited" driving to Austin and a full day of running at Little Le Mans.
Both these included expeditions to the high side of 100 MPH.

If you're talking about A/C, the answer is yes. Call Performance Aire
in Anaheim for their kit. Don't have the number, but its in area
code 714.

Sounds like your control pressure regulator, often called the warmup
regulator. Possibly the temp sensor too. CIS is such fun....

	You might want to buy the Haynes manual for the 944 as it has the
same engine as the 924S (although the 924 is detuned).

	Upfixin' der Porsche is a publication of the Porsche Club of
America and is written in American (rather than English :-) ) I
believe.

	You might want to buy Peter Morgan's "The 924/944 book". I'll
e-mail you the full details tomorrow if I remember.

	The Porsche Club of Great Britain sells 4 books dealing with 924s.
They are:

Porsche 924/928/944		Jerry Sloniger		12.95 2.00
Porsche 924/944 book		Peter Morgan		15.95 2.30
Porsche 924/944			Nigel Edwards		11.95 2.00
Porsche 924 Gold Portfolio	1977-78			10.95 1.00

	The two prices (in Pounds Sterling) are for the book and for
shipping to the UK - "overseas orders are normally sent by surface
mail: 25% of the total value of the goods ordered should be added to
cover the extra carriage costs involved".

	The address is

		The Club Shop
		Porsche Club Great Britain
		Ayton House
		West End
		Northleach
		Gloucestershire
		England
		GL54 3HG

		Telephone	+44 242 516063
		Fax		+44 451 60011

	They also mention the Haynes manual (10.95) and the Chiltern
(12.00) which is only 1977-81.

regards,
Philip

Hi,

A few questions on a 911.

1. What kind of gas mileage should one expect from an SC engine?

2. I think the newer 911's have a vent on the dash.  Can you cut
an opening and install a vent on an older 911?

3. I still have a problem with my engine just dying.  It happens
more often on hot days. When I drive the car for a while, let it sit 
for about 15 mins. and then try to start it up.  It starts fine then
it dies.  It does it for a few times, then it becomes normal.  It seems
to have something to do with the fuel getting hot or something.  It even
happens on the freeway and all I have to do is quickly turn the key to
off and quickly back to on to get it going again (I have to engage the
clutch while doing this otherwise it backfires, very loud).

Well,  That's all for now.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
************************************************************************


1.      I get between 4 and 24 mpg in my 1980 sc coupe.  4 when 
        autocrossing, up to about 24 on the freeway.

2.      The dash "vent" is for the air conditioning.

3.      Sounds like a fuel injection problem.  I would have thought 
        warm up regulator, but from your description, it sounds like
        it does it under load.  My knowledge of FI problems is limited,
        but this is sounding like a fuel pressure problem.  Probst (I think
        that's the name) has written an excellent book on Bosch fuel 
        injection.

------------------------------------------

Well here in rumbling So. Cal. a '88 944 in very good shape would cost
$14k to $17k depending on the miles

An '84 would be around $7k to $9k but that all depends on what service 
has been done. If it has a new clutch, updated water pump, new motor
mounts (not that important) and fresh belts it may cost a bit more.

	As promised, details of Peter Morgan's book :

		"The Porsche 924/944 Book"
		Peter Morgan
		Published by Foulis/Haynes, 1990
		ISBN 0-85429-764-2
		Library of Congress catalogue card number 90-81744

	On another tack, I can highly recommend (even though I haven't
finished reading it!):

		"The PORSCHE Driving Book" (2nd edition)
		Martin Beck-Burridge & John Lyon
		Published by Porsche Cars Great Britain Limited, 1990
		ISBN 0-9513737-1-4

which is available from:

		Porsche Cars Great Britain Limited
		Bath Road
		Calcot
		Reading
		Berkshire
		England
		RG3 7SE

and cost 19.95 Pounds Sterling when I bought my copy from a local dealer.
This is the book which PCGB give away free with every new Porsche, and
deals with advanced driving techniques like advanced observation and the
overtaking triangle, as well as less useful things like heel & toe.
Interestingly it recommends that you always double declutch (something I
have been practising in hire cars:-) ). There are also separate sections
on how to drive the 911/944/928/turbo.


	The local Porsche Club GB had a street concours on Sunday and I
managed to get a lift in the local dealer's 968 demonstrator - they
wouldn't let anyone drive it because they had had a 911 totalled recently
at a recent event :-( The salesman who was driving wouldn't go over 120mph
:-( :-( but he did give me a demonstration of the 3 second 60-0 time which
was impressive. A desireable car, but I really did feel that it was a 944
S3 rather than a totally new car.

	I also got a copy of the Performance Products catalogue which a
local company is importing. How do these people rate for price and quality?
