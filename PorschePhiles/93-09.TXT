Subject: Re:  Brakes

 
 You need to think in 3space. Contrary to popular belief the
 brake disc is not a two-dimensional object :->

 ------------------------------------------

From Dr. John Robinson's book on motorcycle tuning:

 Drilling and slotting discs can be used for several effects: to make the
 disc lighter, to alter its surface area and to help break it up and clear away
 debris at the pad surface.

 Of these, making the disc lighter probably has the most value, and any hole
 will remove material and weight. Obviously it is important that the holes do 
 not weaken the disc - drilling holes close together on the same radius or 
 in a radial line, would not be a good idea.

 As the holes pass under the pad, the contact area changes continuously, so the 
 local pad pressure varies and this is probably good for keeping the pad clear
 of any glazing or other contamination on the surface layer.

 If the disc weighs less it will heat up faster and, for a given heat input,
 will reach a higher temperature. The holes can also make the surface area of
 the disc greater, smaller or leave it at the same value. As the disc cooling 
 depends to a large extent on surface area, a careful choice of hole size 
 can help it to run hotter or to cool it.

 If the thickness of the disc is "t" and the diameter of the hole is "d", then
 the circular area of the hole is "pi*d^2/4", removed from each side of the 
 disc.

 The wall area of the hole is "pi*d*t", added to the disc, so the total change
 in surface area is "pi*n*d*t - pi*n*d^2/2" for n holes.

 If d < 2t the surface area will increase.
 If d = 2t the surface area will stay the same.
 If d > 2t the surface area will decrease.

I wrote in a previous thread:

<stuff deleted>

Back to our exciting story: if you use a factory fender cooler (SC is a
trombone loop of pipe (ok), early Carrera is 3 rows of 20 odd tubes (good),
later Carreras had radiator style (better), and late ('87+) Carreras used a
radiator style with a pusher thermostatically controlled fan (best) (for a
fender mount unit) you will need the AN-12 to metric (30mm??)
fittings.   <more stuff deleted>
.
.
Instead of a fender cooler, I used a RSR style spoiler and mounted an early
Mazda RX-7 oil cooler behind it (did he say, ugh, MAZDA?) (yes he did).  This
is not that straight forward in that it requires some sheet metal work.

I'm not sure what the front spoiler looks like on your C2 Turbo kit, but if
it's got air passages for a cooler, you'll get the most air flow, and cooling
capacity by mounting a cooler behind it.  Next best is the fender mount
radiator style with a fan (fan is mostly for stop & go).

A used RX-7 cooler costs in the $100 range plus the mods to adapt to AN.  The
fender mount unit will user your existing lines sans the trombone, you'll
need the flex lines that go between the cooler and your existing oil lines.
In either case I'd get a used one and have it tested -- new ones are ex$pen$ive
I'm not stuck on using the Mazda cooler either -- there are bunches of them
out there, the Mazda one I know personally to be a very hardy, well built and
cheap.  BTW it is an early RX-7, I think '79 - '81 or '82, that has the right
cooler...

There was an article in either Pano or Excellence a couple of years back that
a guy wrote after progressing thru several different cooler setups.  He ended
up with the RSR style but the fender one worked well for him too.

If you decide on the fender unit, I've got a late one w/ fan and flex hoses
for sale, if you're interested...

Subject: Drilled rotors.


Hi Guys,

When Porsche was serious about hillclimbing, they extracted weight from
the rotors by cross drilling as a quick expediant to a diet for the 
berg-spyders. Edgar barth noted that the brakes did work better in rainy
conditions than before. Those guys had big gazongas and drove in every
condition, no wussies there.

The idea was adapted for the factory racers, as the rotors were tossed 
after each event.

I had a lot of problems in 1968 with the Corvette brakes, as I mentioned
in yesterday's diatribe. I couldn't get enough air through the cooling
ducts. So I put a Corvair cooling fan on each front wheel, the rules
allowed any wheel. This did the trick, at the Laguna Seca Trans-Am race
that year, Mark Donahue and his crew chief looked the Corvette over real
well and gave us some tips on which pad and grooving the disc. Nice 
guys, we had some calls from the east when pictures appeared in 
Competion Press. 

We didn't need ducts with the fans.

   coolers in the Automotion catalogs sufficient or is there some other one I

The stock Carrera cooler, radiator type, with cooling fan used from
'87-'89 works remarkably well. I can't believe you're running a 3.2
without a cooler! This is probably a bad idea, as I would think oil
temperatures will run off the gauge.

A complete used setup from a salvage yard, including solid lines, oil
thermostat, cooler, fan and hardware should run around $1000.

I took a look at an '85 911 w/ Salvaged title last night.  It was in very good

4 way power switch to control the upright portion of the driver's seat drove
the motor but the seat did not move. How difficult would it be to fix the seat?
Also the seat did not angle forward when I pulled up on the side levers.
Must have been damaged in the collision.

Front and rear spoilers need to be replaced.  The rear speaker section behind
rear seats appears to be warped.  How much would it cost to replace these

Fellow Porschephiles,

A precursor to the dreaded Cottage-Cheese coolant seems to be attacking my  87
924S (86k).  There is some oil in the coolant and Oil pressure is off a

consistent with KG's explanation below that the O-rings or other parts of the

  The guages pop out.  Get a fingernail under the lip and lift.  You might
find one guage easier than the other, if so, remove that one and work your
way over to the speedo and tach.  Another method is to come up under the
dash behind the guage and push it out.  Course, you could always leave the
hood popped up to the safty catch.  At speed, my speedo blows out that way
 :->
 One disadvantage of turning them is you hide some of the guages under the
steering wheel.

Bart,

Please read my scribblings a little more closely, I wrote that you 
should NOT remove the gravel shield.

On 924s alone, the grill in FRONT of the radiator may be altered.

The gravel shield on all 924/944/968 varients is intended to direct and
control airflow through the radiator and around the engine in 
conjunction with the radiator shroud and fans. This is very critical 
with the turbos. It also keeps s*** out of the fan assembly and timing 
belts.

On 944 non-turbos with the stock spoiler/valence, the slots where the
brake ducts would normally be can be opened up for better air 
distribution to the brakes. 


As for Compuserve fame, I'll pass. I wrote for Excellence and other
automotive publications and haven't gotten it yet. No biggie.

It couldn't be easier. The gauges are hold by the rubber ring which

Thanks for your comments.  It turns out that I was getting second-hand info. 
On talking with the (rooftop) mechanic, I of course got a better explanation
and a visual tour.  The Woodruff key which is seated in the balance shaft and
in effect keeps the sprocket (cog wheel?) in place was bunged up as was the
seat.  This allowed the sprocket to slide forward into the plastic cover  and
leave a partial circular slit.  The balance shaft belt  and sprocket were *not*
in good condition.  The explanation for the cause was that whomever replaced
the water pump before I bought the car had not installed belt guides/shields
that come with the upgrade kit (so I was told) and that allowed lateral? play
resulting in the originally note slits in the plastic covver and attendant
difficulties. Repairs cost 2100 iron men but at least I got to it before the
timing belt was affected.

This *doesn't* seem reasonable! The balance shaft will never slide forward
enough to hit the plastic cover. It is held in place by a bearing (and the
associated bearing cap) that snugly fits between two rotating weights.
Something else must have cracked the plastic cover (maybe the mechanic :-).
Sounds very suspicious to me...

    A while back I promised an update as to my effort to fix my dead
    starter problem (no response in hot weather, after long

    rebuilding the starter/selenoid, I installed a relay and a new

    This weekend I was at the track and had the opportunity to test my
    fix.  The weather was hot (typical D.C. weather- hot and humid!).
     I am pleased to announce the fix has alleviated the problem.  At
    no time this weeked (after two days of driver's ed and time
    trials) did I have a dead starter.  Once, however, after my last
    run on Saturday, and a particularly hard run at that, did the car
    not want to start- the starter did turn over, but not fast enough
    to start the car.  I waited a bit for it to cool and it started

Assuming you are talking about a late series car (post 85 1/2), the
procedure is not too bad. You need to remove the steering wheel (for
clearance). You then remove a series of small phillips head screws
holding the trim around the complete instrument cluster. With the trim
out of the way, you will see 4 (I think) larger screws which hold
the complete cluster in place. Remove them, and slide the whole cluster
out. The electrical connections are made by three removable connectors.
With the whole cluster in your lap, the speedometer is removed (from
the back) by removing the obvious set of small retaining screws.

I didn't have to replace my speedometer, but I did replace part of the tach
(due to significant errors, NB), and the access procedure is essentially
the same.

I have an EZ Bleed, and for cars that it can be made to work on,
it is a major win. Purging the old fluid is a "breeze", and the
bleeding phase went MUCH more quickly than it has with any other
system I've tried, and resulted in a much firmer brake pedal than
I ever got before, as well. And the "one hand behind your back"
operation is great, too. I have not had much luck using the fluid
reservoir, though, since I have yet to get a really good seal on the 
cap to the reservoir of the car. So what, I'm used to having to top
it up between wheels anyway. The caps that it comes with fit most
british cars - oh, your car isn't? Too bad - you have to drill a 3/8"
hole in a spare brake reservoir cap to make up an adapter.

Subject: Coolant with Salad Oil


Bob and other concerned Porschephiles;

The dreaded oil in coolant can occur for two major reasons:

1) the Oil cooler has failed and it's delivering a good amount of oil 
   to the cooling system.

2) the seals have failed and the same is occuring. 

Both fixes REQUIRE that the cooler housing be removed and the cooler 
seperated from the housing. If you have doubts, pressure check the 
cooler for leaks. 

While the housing is apart, clean it and inspect for hairline cracks, 
I've seen one that was cracked. Use only the updated gasket set.

The cooler is about $250 and the gasket set about $70.

One other thing, once you've added the oil to the cooling system, the 
jelly must be removed and then the refilled cooling system brought up to
temperature to get the oil to the point it can be purged from the system
as it's presence greatly reduces the efficiency of the system. I've 
seen it necessary to do three purges.

It is not unusual for a `replaced' unit to fail if the mechanic did a 
schlock job cleaning the components.

I'll second the recommendation to keep the gravel shields.

When I bought my '86 944 (non-turbo) it didn't have the gravel shield.
When I got it back from my mechanic after having the belts changed
(the first week that I had it) I noticed that it ran cooler.  My mechanic
explained the next day at a PCA SD tech session that he didn't find one
on the car when it came in, so he put on one he had stored away.  

Keep the shields, they are there for a reason.

Subject: bursch

my previous room mate worked at a porsche repair shop that was heavy into
auto-x. the 2 best cars they built both ran better with bursch exhaust than
with sport muffler. they used the bursch exhaust for the early mechanical
injection (3 small mufflers that look like glass packs). i found the sound to
be wounderful, when the throttle was blipped it sounded like paper tearing and
at idle had a deep bass sound. both cars were very fast (mid 12s in 1/4mile)
the first car was a convertible (two cars welded together in the middle with no
roof but a roll cage)
with turbo suspension, engine 3.2L taken out to 3.5L ,s cams ,carbs,headers,915
trans,2200lbs. it won f prepared nationals 4or5 years ago. the second car was a
74 coupe, carrera suspension, 3.6L C2 engine,carbs,headers 915 trans. this car
never did as well as first car it had less power and at the time there were no
other cams avalible(clearance is very tight in these engines). a fair amount of
modification was required to fit this engine into the earlier car and the
results were disapointing. for the money the 3.5 was a better option.

Jim,
  Interesting comment on the loss of low end response.  Can you be a bit
more specific?  Mine was on the car when I got it so I have nothing to judge
that with.  I've not noticed it lagging behind at track events but am always
willing to learn - and pick up speed.
  Corvair in heat?  Must be a different version (was told there were 3
levels when mine was made).  This one sounds more like a good old V8.  Not
all that loud but much 'deeper' than normal. I must admit, many 'purists'
prefer the whine to the rumble but at Bridgehampton I did get peoples choice
for best sounding car :->

Subject: seats

Regarding the discussion that went on a couple of weeks ago regarding
Carbeau and Recaro seats, would I like to share my experience.

Last night I mounted a Recaro seat and took the 911 for a short test ride.

I was actually suprised to find out (although is was a short ride) that:

 - I could "feel" the car better at cornering. This feeling was evident.

 - Even acceleration felt different. It felt like I had more  "control" 
  over the car.
  
 - It felt as if though I had more power in my arms when manouvering at low 
  speeds (e.g. slalom).
  
All in all a significant change of the feel of the car. Next step will 
(hopefully) be new Bilsteins. 

The sad thing is that there will not be any more track events this year..

By the way, does anyone known if seat rails from an other car (VW ?) can be
used in the 911??

Greetings Porschephiles.

This is a copy of the RULES that get sent out to all new members. Since
I have just revised them to include the copyright and fair usage info
as an official policy statement, I wanted to make sure that everyone had
a copy. This supercedes anything posted as rules in the past, and is
up for FTP in /pub/porschephiles/RULES in case you need a fresh copy.

- ---
[ policy message updated 9/3/93 sph]

**These are the rules. Save this, and re-read it frequently. Should you
**lose it, it is available by FTP on tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/RULES. 

- --

Welcome, and congratulations!!! You are now on the Porschephiles electronic
mail discussion list.  

This introductory message has four parts

	HOW IT WORKS
	ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES
	RULES FOR USE
	FTP ACCESS
	COPYRIGHT ISSUES

HOW IT WORKS

It's really quite simple. If you send a messages to  the address

    porschephiles@tta.com

it gets reflected out to over 400 people, as soon as it comes in. Messages
are also saved and sent out in one daily batch as Porschephiles-Digest
for members who prefer to only get a single message a day.

Also, once a month you'll get a Montly Update mailing which has some useful 
information, and the Who's Who list. To get listed on Who's Who, send me your 
name, the state you live in, kind of car (sorry, I only list Porsches), and 
your email address. These two notes are also available via FTP along with 
archives of past digests. (see the FTP ACCESS section for details)

ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES

If you want to get the digest version, need to change your address, need
to tell someone about broken service, wish to request to be dropped from 
the list, or just have comments, complaints, and other administrative 
issues to the address:

    porschephiles-request@tta.com

This list is operated *MANUALLY* -- all requests are handled by hand, there
is no "listserv" functionality. 

PLEASE do not burden the whole list with any of the above, and if you give 
out info about the list, refer to the "-request" address ONLY.  Use the 
"@tta.com" addresses listed above, instead of any other porschephiles
addresses you might have heard about in the past. They are defunct.

RULES FOR USE

Please read the rest of this message. There *WILL* be a test...

First, this is NOT a USENET newsgroup. It is not even *similar* to a USENET
newsgroup. For starters, it was designed to cater to people who actually
own or know something about Porsche cars. People very busy trying to make
money to support their German metal habit. One of the implict assumptions
in that is that you *must* be doing something right, or you'd be drving a
Yugo. Hence, you are expected to act in a responsible and professional manner.

Second, neither I nor the rest of the list have time to spend on people doing 
stupid things, so if you start doing stupid things, you may be dropped from
the list. These may include doing any of the following things:

* persistant, annoying, whining, postings about things that aren't
  relevant to the group 
* responding with seriously wrong info to a question, and then being
  less than humble about your mistake -- if you don't KNOW, at
  least have the sense not to tell the rest of us you don't know
* posting of "test messages"
* having mail to you fail more than 3 days in a row -- maybe less if
  it's getting to be a problem
* complaining about the above policies 8{)

I admit this is a bit restrictive, but that's life. Quality BEFORE quantity.

If you *DO* happen to be dropped from the list, you can petition to be 
reinstated.  Should you be dropped due to a bad mailer or something related, 
it's automatic when you ask. If you actually did something stupid, we'll have 
to talk. Don't worry, I'll *TELL* you if you did something stupid...

Third, be cognizant of what exactly is going on when you send a note out.
Mail sent to list gets sent to hundreds of people, traveling through many
hundreds, if not thousands, of computers.  This may take days to
actually occur, as some sites still use once a day polling to transmit mail.

Given the current state of technology it is not improbable that one of those
links will exhibit some sort of problem.  When you post a message, you may get
back error messages.  This DOES NOT mean you need to resend it.  What it does
mean is that everybody got it except for maybe one or two folks.  Don't repost
things unless you are absolutely, positively sure it did not reach anyone on
the list. (Clue: the failed mail message would be from  "mailer-daemon" or
"mailer-daemon@your.site.name" or "postmaster@your.site.name")

Please remember that not everyone has the latest and greatest screen technology 
at their fingertips.  Keep your text limited to lines less than 80 characters
long.

Try to keep the size of your submissions under control.  Keep it short and 
interesting, if at all possible (I mean, how interesting can 951 rear inner
bearing wear characteristics be?? 8{) ).  So, instead of sending three messages
of one sentence each, try to send one message with three sentences in it.  
Same information content, it just puts a little less load on everyone.  If you 
are replying to a message, use discretion in how much of the original message 
you quote.  Forwarding a complete message only to add a single sentence or 
two of your own doesn't make you look too smart.  Folks will delete the 
message they think they've already seen long before they get to your comments.  
And speaking of trying to look smart, read over your text at least once to 
catch the obvious errors, like spelling errors and such.

FTP ACCESS

If you'd like to get a feel for past discussions, or are just a glutton for
punishment, the archives of this list since 4/90 are available via FTP on 
tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/archives. Please limit your FTP access to 
between 7:00 PM and 8:00 AM CST, or I'll have to revoke the privilege. 

In /pub/porschephiles you will also find three other files of interest:
"RULES", a copy of this message; "Whos-Who", the current list of Who's
Who on Porschephiles; and "Monthly-Update", the monthly message to the
group as a whole giving updates and key info.

Also available for FTP are a collection of images of Porsches in 
/pub/images, and some info on joining the Porsche Club of America

Subject: Bursch

Bill,

The Bursch systems for the 4-bangers was a pretty significant thing, 
the actual efficiency went up with them.

On a chassis dyno for a 2-liter six, the Bursch give some improvement on
a 914/6- 911T motor over 5500 RPM. Below that I saw a loss of 8% on 
torque. For a track car, the Bursch wouldn't be too bad as the RPM range
is in the upper end.
Larger engines aren't as affected, but the later stock mufflers have a 
lot of restriction as compared to the 1974 and earlier systems. If you 
compare that factory system against the Bursch  on any engine, the 
Bursch will have lees bottom end than the 1974 Porsche system.

This all assumes a fairly stock engine. Race engines or purpose built 
engines need to be engineered to the tip of the tail pipe, I'd say most 
I've seen don't do a very good job for headers, muffler or tail pipe.

Seat of the pants is a hard way to really see how your engine is 
responding. The Chassis dyno is the best for observation and watching 
mixture and other things less restriction on the exhaust changes.

I put one on my SC last year and I actually kinda like it.  The exhaust

The price was right and it didn't take too much work to install (had to

Hi all-

In trying to locate a fuel sender gasket, I called up a) Performance and
b) a Porsche dealer, and c) a VW dealer (in the hope that the part would
be the same across the line).  In calling Performance, I got one number for
everything from a 911 to 944 to 928; 477.919.133.  In calling a Porsche 
dealer for a '77 924, I got the number 477.XXX.YYY (can't recall right now),
and a different number for an '83 944.   At the VW dealer, the part 
is 113.919.131A (which is for everything from a '73 Bug to a '80 Scirroco (sp?)). Is it possible that the part is the *same* for all of the vehicles, 
but the part *numbers* are different?  I mean, this thing is a *gasket* for
crying out loud.  How much re-engineering goes into gaskets (besides at

company, the associated hardware would be the same as well...

Subject: help/advice with 1962 356B

Hello! I'm a new member to the list, with several questions...

I came across a Porsche 356 sitting in the corner of a field by a road - 
the body's in good shape, and it was sitting there with the windows down
and doors unlocked. Odd thing is, there was no "for sale" sign in it,
nor on the old Ford sitting next to it.

So, being curious (and hopefull) I got the body number from the 
driver's door panel... 212126
I popped the engine cover, but wasn't able to find the block number 
(not sure where to look).
>From the body details I think it's a 356 B - dual intake grills
on the engine cover, two horizonal slats in the openings by the
front running lights, bumper & headlight positions...
On the rear of the car, there is a "Porsche" plate attached, the number "60", 
(possibly broken 1600?) and two holes below where something came off.
I looked up the body number in two Porsche reference books I have, and compared
photos, so that's how I think it's a '62 356B. It's ivory exterior, red
interior, with solid hubcaps (no emblems).

I left my name and number on a piece of paper in the car, hopefully the 
owner will give me a ring.
Is there anyone with Porsche knowledge out there who can help me pinpoint 
the age/type of this car?
If it's up for sale, it's probably out of my range (unless it's not in 
running condition) but can anyone give me a hand in figuring out a good 
price offer? I looked thru the mail list archives and saw a range of $10-20K.
Is this reasonable?

Any advice/help/shoot the breeze, please email me at
dwhite@nist.gov

thanks in advance,  Doug

Keep in mind the gasket is probably not made by Porsche, but *for* Porsche.
You might want to check the OEM part number and cross-reference it to
the Porsche number(s). For example, if your gasket is manufactured by
Krupp, and the number is KR45-345H then you can check the Krupp cross
reference to see what cars it fits on, and you'll see the 928, the
944, the 911, the Scirroco (sp?) and maybe a Volvo and Lada thrown in for good
luck. 

The short answer is yes, it is common for an identical part to have
different numbers. Maybe they do it to fool 930 owners so they don't
realize that their car shares many parts with a Super-Beetle.

According to GATES, the most researched of the Bill Gates 
bio's, Bill has been into Porsche for a long time, not just 
a 959 come lately. I don't have the book handy, but as I 
remember it, a metallic green '77 911 was his first 
indulgence with Microsoft. This was when MS was in New 
Mexico. He used to drive it at very high speeds to unwind. I 
think he wrote a letter to Porsche complaining that it would 
not meet the advertised top speed. I don't remember how many 
Porsche's he's had since then. His daily beater is a Lexus, 
I think. He didn't have a reserved parking place until 
lately. He reportedly got the reserved spot because too many 
people would try to beg money off him on the walk in from 
the boonies.

Stan, maybe you should send billg@microsoft.com a digest 
subscription and question him, see if he'll fill us in with 
his big brother troubles in re the 959, and perhaps compare 
the 959 with his various 911's.

>difficult it is to learn to weld at home?  are there good books

  KC, (and HotRodders)
  It is not difficult to learn to weld.  The difficult part is
  affording the tools and acquiring the 'knack'.
  There are a raft of books on the subject, but reading a book on 
  welding is like playing football from your armchair.  You learn
  the basics but never quite get the execution.
  
  The Welder's Handbook by HP books makes a very good primer on what's
  out there and techniques.  After neglecting my welding skills for over
  a decade, this (HP book) is where I re-started.
  
>on technique?  what form of welding is most forgiving of a novice?
>(mig, tig, torch,.....)  i am an expert at soldering (both pc
>boards and plumbing types), but would like some advice before 

  Soldering skills will be a benefit because welding is very similar.
  The flowing of liquid metals (fusing) together to form a joint is
  remarkably applicable regardless of what metal(s) you are working.

  You should be familiar with 'heat the joint and let the solder melt
  into the joint'.  I do a *lot* of hand soldering where I work
  (making electronic prototypes) and eye-hand dexterity is where it's
  at.  Welding (in any medium) is similar, but with much more care in
  the temperatures being used and having to train the eye to sense
  a proper weld.  This takes raw time in the saddle to acquire.

  MIG welding (wire feed, inert gas) or GMAW I found to be the most
  forgiving to the novice.  This is because of the gas envelope
  (and I much prefer GAS MIG) and it's effect on arc retention.
  Honestly, I was a mediocre welder (I chose not to make it my
  profession =|^> ) until I purchased a MIG, then it was like
  my talent was amplified.  Migging is best done in a garage or enclosed
  space because of the tendency to lose the gas envelope as a result
  of moving air in the vicinity of the weld site.  Flux migging
  might suffer from this (dunno for sure) but has the added problem
  of flux residue remaining after the weld.  This type of MIG is
  the cheapest available for the hardware, but the most expensive for
  the mig-cored wire reels. (consumables)
  
  Gas (oxy-acetylene) welding must not be ignored here either, this
  method is also very good for welding sheet metal.  I have infact
  used gas to followup a MIG weld to ensure PENETRATION.  One of my
  favorite tricks is to use the MIG to 'tack' a panel in place, then
  fill in using the mig and folow up with the torch to smooth the bead.
  Otherwise you have to grind A LOT.  Specific attention to avoiding
  warpage in a panel must always be forefront in your mind.  For this
  reason, I avoid using a torch to tack a panel in place, the heat buildup
  is just too great to control warpage.  Trust me, warpage is a BIG
  problem when wrangling sheet steel, the larger the part, the worse the
  risk.  This is where some skill at metal bumping comes in.  Another 
  lost art for panelworking is hammerwelding, but that's another topic...

>taking the plunge on equipment.  the pro's want an arm and a leg 
>to do what needs to be done, and i've got a *lot* more time than 
>money.  

  It will be a plunge...  I purchased both MIG and Oxy-acetylene sets,
  these set me back over 1K.  And I bought entry level stuff.
  My choice for MIG was the Airco miglite 100, at $450 from my local
  friends at the welding shop.  Phooey! This unit is made in Britain
  by SIP (Standard Industial Products) and was also offered by JC Whitney
  as their delux ($350) model.  The price was right, and I LIKE IT.
  It has the Binzel torch and hose (very soft and light weight) ideal for
  tight confines (like those found in my 914). Six heats and 100 amp max.
  Not sure if Warshawsky still sells that particular unit. I got %10 off.
  The above mentioned price includes rental on gas cylinders (Argon/Co2, o2,
  acetylene) for 7 to ten years.  The unit operates on 115Vac, and can be
  used on an extension cord (but not on the higher power settings).

  Having lots of time (and short on cash) can work to your advantage.
  pinch yourself up front to get the hardware, then study and practice
  techniques until you can weld something your life may depend on.
  Literally, fabricate something of use that will demand quality welds.
  In my case, I welded a scad of pencil boxes out of playing card size
  punchouts of sheet steel of similar gauge to your car.  give them away
  as gifts so your friends can critique your work...peer pressure -its
  wonderful.  If you're really good, weld up a rotisserie to mount yer car's
  body to so you can do all your welds 'IN POSITION' by then, YOU can
  weld a panel onto your car and maybe not warp the bejeebers or blow
  holes in it.  Since you now have fabrication capability, exhaust systems
  become a snap, chairs, shelves, trailers, engine stands, etc. become
  items of want if you got the steel and a design in mind.  I paid for
  my gas weld set in one weekend after making an engine stand for my
  Porsche motor. (tool P201)
  

  Now perhaps you understand why the welding shops maybe gouge the folks
  wanting a little skill and equipment to make a rusted out panel like new
  again.  I too, learned this the hard way -nobody rides free, and 
  discounts are tough to come by.
  Sorry if this sounds sarcastic in places, but the realities hit me
  pretty hard.  I have yet to drive this car, and I am sure I could
  have constructed a 914 from a box of factory parts (if i could $ them)
  and be driving it now.  But then I would not have a good reason to
  own a fine set of tools and equipment, and I would still be ignorant
  of all the doings that go into making a car (from scratch?).
  Much of this stuff is pure judgment call... do what you like,
  each to his own...not the worst, not the best.  Spousal support
  would be invaluable.

  Fare Thee Well.

Au contraire.  Surprisingly enough, a VW part bought from Porsche will often
cost less than if bought from VW.  My parts guy mentioned this to me many
moons ago; he sells Porsche, VW, Audi, MB, etc, parts.  For yucks, he
punched up (ooh, I love using computerese) the prices for some electrical
goobers I was ordering on the VW system, and saw prices that were, like,
50% higher in some cases.

According to the chassis number, the car would be a MY 63 356B made from
July 62 on.  Should be a coupe, and should have a 1600S-90 engine.  In
fact, from the chassis number I would say it was one of the last such

62 was 212171.

Because, by American iron standards, Porsche engines *ARE*
blueprinted.

I've built big-block Ford race motors that had looser tolerances
that street/autox 911s I've built. Factory balance weights are
in the 3-10 gram range, where that's considered "blueprint balanced"
in many "hot rod" shops.

I've got a blue-printed 924 engine. Not quite a true Porsche engine I know,

Even on a VW engine it doesn't have the effect that it does to some of our

I'd be interested to know whether you dyno'd the engine before you had
it blueprinted, for a few reasons.  First off, dyno's do vary in calibration
and the only real way to know the effect of work, we believe, is to
measure the "before" and "after" with the same dyno, same car, same
everything.

The second reason is Porsche's legendary understatement of their engines'
horsepower and torque.  Btw, this is the reason I almost completely
discount the hp gains Autothority claims for aspiro engines within
the power band.

Nonetheless, seven hp is nice to have!

Well, I'm just back from that, and after spending a weekend with about 300
356 owners talking cars, working on cars, concouring cars, etc. I'm
completely convinced that you all need to sell whatever it is you have
to buy a 356 and join this group. I'm seriously impressed with the *quality*
of the people involved -- no gold chains, no rolexes, no "my car is better
than your car" attitudes, just a solid *DEEP* abiding passion for the
cars.

Highlights included 

	* Brett Johnson (and a host of volunteers from among the attendees)
	  assembling a car shipped down as boxes of parts, to be driven
	  back to Indianapolis (didn't make it -- brought several *KEY*
	  wrong parts not available at the swap meet). But I think they 
	  would have done it if it hadn't been for wrong/missing parts!

  	* Bill Jones (who, btw, sold my car when it was new...) and Bob
  	  Jones doing a Q & A session for most of an afternoon. I actually
  	  learned a couple of things, which always impresses me...

  	* Harvey and Linda Smith talking about (a) how to really restore
  	  a 356 and (b) how much it *REALLY* cost and why. A real eye-opener
  	  for some people, I'm sure...

  	* Jim Cunningham (from Buda, TX, no less) with a Carrera GS in
  	  Le Mans trim. When he was finally convinced to start it up, it
  	  spit fire about 4 feet out of the tail pipe!

  	* swap meet of huge proportions (by 356 standards). One guy trailered
  	  in a 24 foot box trailer full of stuff...

  On the whole, I can't say I'd rather have spent the weekend any other
  way!

  Sorry NO. The engine was a basket case...i.e. I bought a box of bits which had
been half blueprinted. My original engine had a worn cam shaft, a blown piston ( the
cause of failure) and worn big ends. I was offered this "project" at less than the
cost of replacement parts for the old engine. I had the blueprinting finshed and
valve guides replaced.

Having said that I cannot compare.. I have a friend with a 90K 924 with new rings.
He also has a K&N filter, big bore throttle and vernier cam pulley and only pulls
120 (i.e. 5 down) on the same dyno ( he was 10 down before he improved
his induction system).

The hp isn't that noticable, but what I will say is the engine is much smoother...
it isn't really rough until 5K (my old one was wanting you to change at 4... the last 2K
were really painful). Having said that it's still not V8 smooth.

Yes, my problem now is oil cooling. No problem cruising at 70-80mph, the water gets slightly
warmer but the oil is OK. Take it on a track and the oil pressure is down to 2.5-3bar at 4K
too low for my liking and thats after only 15mins. I'm trying to figure out how to
add an oil cooler

Any Ideas?

Doesn't matter what media  you use. It's one of those "you use, you lose"
deals.

We had an area *NEAR* the engine compartment of a 914-6 bead-blasted as part
of a sleezoid repair. The carbs were taped shut, all entry passages sealed,
etc. -- should be safe, right. Wrong. The media gets *EVERYWHERE*, and will
eventually work its way into something critical. In this case, both the
air intakes and the *OIL TANK*. So, saving the time to remove the engine
and do the repair correctly to begin with cost us a full engine rebuild,
including new pistons, cylinders, and crank due to media-induced wear.

If you want to get then engine *REALLY* clean and shiny on the outside, use
SoftScrub and a toothbrush. Seriously. If you have the opportunity to take 
the engine apart, you can bead blast the case *THEN* polish it.

Doug,

Yes, the cooler is removeable with the engine in the car. You must 
remove the gravel shield to gain access. Plan on a new oil filter and
a gasket set for the cooler and housing. 

The pressure relief valve may be removed also, if you want to put a new 
aluminum gasket under it, I've found that some teflon plumbers tape 
helps to seal the cap better.

Malc,

Get an Automotion Catalog, they offer an adapter to go between the oil 
filter and the block to accomodate the lines you'll need. You WILL 
need a thermostat, I used a GTI unit, and a cooler, I used a Mazda RX-7.
An MGB cooler will work as well, probably easier to find in the UK.
The GTI thermostat is a necessity as the oil will split the cooler when 
cold.

BTW, the output of your engine sounds right for a stock Euro engine from
what I've seen. The blueprinting and balancing probably made it `right'.

Subject: Blueprinting


Tom and others with this question,

Blueprinting on the average Porsche engine, 914 and 924 included, can 
still be performed as there are still variances in the process. The 
variences are much smaller than the typical mass-produced engine, but 
still exist. Porsche admits that, they used to list weight groups for
pistons and rods for the 356 and 911 motors, this was a guide for 
builders when assembling an engine. You wanted to use the lightest rods 
and pistons, in the old days the light stuff was reserved for `S'(super)
motors or special stuff for the real paying customer or the race team.

On the water cooled stuff, it wasn't well advertised but Porsche wound 
up taking the 924 turbo short blocks apart at Zuffenhausen and improving
them by replacing the main and rod bearings, re-gapping the rings and 
balancing the rotating parts. It doesn't sound like a lot, but they were
much smoother that way. I did a couple of 924 autocross motors and the 
balance and blueprint yielded 21 HP. That included head work to spec and
setting the valves and seats correctly. This isn't a problem with 911s
as that is specified in the build spec for all engines.

The 944 can use a better balance job and the head needs CCing and some 
flow work.

BTW, most american engines, mechanically, are to specs as tight as 
Porsche's these days, the problem is that when they make a mistake, 
they screw up thousands, not four or five.

What blueprinting is:

Taking a stock engine and matching/machining every part
to the "intended" ideal specifications.

What blueprinting is not:

Porting, polishing, doing trick HP increases or other 
machine work.

American cars generally profit from blueprinting because
parts are matched by "size group" - thus undersized pistons
might be matched to undersized cylinders in order to take
advantage of looser manufacturing tolerances.

Porsches, as mentioned before, are generally pretty close
to spec., although there are size groups for p/c's and
intermediate gears. Weight balance on new engines is
generally very close. This is not to say a good machinist
can't get work magic on a Porsche engine - but that's 
different from blueprinting.

I can't tell you much about Mintex, but I am on my third set of Repco's so
I have a little experience with them.

The factory claims are mostly true. They claim that they don't squeal, fade,
or produce dust. Mine have never squealed, they are almost impossible to
fade on the street, they produce very little dust. 

Strangely enough, they produce almost no dust when new, but they seem to make
more as they age. Maybe they harden with heat over time? I've got no idea.

Pedal effort is lighter than a lot of pads.

All in all, they are the best street pads I've used. (But I'm always open
to suggestions, that's what got me to try Repcos :-)

Repco and Mintex make very good pads for your street driver. I'm using 
the intermediate Repcos (NOT metal master) and they work quite well, I 
have used them on the track and they work better than some more exotic
stuff on a street-tired vehicle.

I will advise that you should have the rotors surfaced to get the

Subject: Oil coolers, take 2...



I've heard several people recommend the RX-3 and RX-7 oil coolers, in the 
Bruce Anderson book he recommends something by a company called Turbatrol in 
indianapolis (which doesn't seem to exist any more, or at least not in 
Indianapolis).

Anyway my question is this, I'd like to get a front oil cooler in the car 
(this is the same '71 with a 3.2l engine I asked about earlier) and I'd like 
to know a few more things.

(A) Do the RX-3 or RX-7 coolers, or the smaller ones from Pegasus or 
Automotion fit in the fender or do you need to mount them behind the front 
spoiler?

(B) Would any of the coolers do a sufficient job when used with aeroquip 
hose? Those factory hoses cost a lot of bucks ($500+) and the only local 
junkyard around here for those parts ends up selling them to some of the 
local hop up shops, so we can't get them. I realise the fatory 
pipes/fittings do provide added cooling which the aeroquip hoses don't,  but 
the aeroquips easier to work with.

(C) Bruce Anderson's book on 911 performance doesn't offer much in the way 
of instruction on how these things should be hooked up, he does mention that 
you can get starvation if the flow capcity of the cooler/lines isn't 
sufficient, but there's nothing on what is sufficient. Do I need a different 
oil pump or will the current one push things through? I know I do need a 
thermostat too. Are there any other highly recommended books that would show 
this procedure, as I'd prefer to do it myself if possible. (i.e. save money 
and learn more about the car at the same time)

thanks for all your help!

Raman,

Your problem is shared by many owners who are not fabricators. It is 
more complex than assembling parts, even to install a factory setup.

Bruce doesn't mention that the lines should be fairly flat with no or
minial humping to get air bubbles trapped.

For mounting behind the air dam, the Mazda and MG coolers work well, 
there were some coolers on Alfa Romeos as well tha work. Pressure test
all used coolers, avoid ones that had a catastrophic failure in the 
engine, all the crap gets in the cooler, a quick flush will NOT get the
particles out.

I'd use factory hard lines to the front of the car, then build the lines
to the cooler. 

I think Bruce didin't want to get into a bag of worms by giving distinct
instruction on how to put a cooler in. There are a lot of variables.

Automotion offers a fairly complete kit for upgrades if you have an SC 
or late Carrera.

I have not tried experimenting with sound deadening material myself.

The principle is however that you generally add MASS to dampen the 
vibrations which causes the sound (lower the resonance frequency). 
The material also absorbs the sound.

If you're willing to add mass then Dynamat, Antiphon or any other type of 
dampening mats are likely to do the job.

What I would do (if I someday don't want the sound) is experimenting with 
"constraint layer damping" which is not as heavy. This is a rather thin 
adeshive with a aluminum top layer. This dampens vibrations (sound) in free, 
unsupported fields of the body. This may not be sufficent for a engine 
compartments but could be used in e.g. doors. 

This material is used in aircrafts but I have not seen it sold in any
car parts shop. The only supplier I know of is antiphon international ab
(+46 8 28 27 55) but its probably hard to get a small order.

Malcolm,
 The 931 has all the parts you need to add an oil cooler to the 924.
I know it's a long shot, but perhaps one of the Porsche boneyards would
be able to provide you with all you need. That has the bonus of avoiding
those distasteful *off brand parts*  :-), and you avoid dealing with
Automotion in the bargain!    :-)

Subject: RE: Oil coolers, take 2...



Raman Asks about the company Turbatrol.  The company is actually called 
Turbatronics and they are indeed located in Indianapolis.  They advertise in
Pano and are also listed in the back of Bruce Anderson's book (although he
does not list their phone number).  I don't have a copy of Pano here or I would 
list the number.

I just got a 01 Kit from Turbatronics for my 76 911s which had no front 
cooler.  The kit was very well put together with everything that I needed to
plumb the cooler in.  They have two different coolers, one that goes in the
fender well and one behind the front spoiler.  I am using the fender well cooler
and the oil temp stays about 190 F now.

By the way the oil lines that they send you are very large.  They are bigger 
then the stock oil lines on a 911.  They are however high pressure fabric
as opposed to steel.

The RX-7 oil cooler would likely have to go behind the spoiler as its a little
too big to fit in the wheel well.

The thing that I liked about the turbatronics oil cooler kit was that I could
buy everything as one package and not worry about trying to piece something
together.  The complete price was $795.00 which is less then what some places
wanted for just a cooler.

I don't have a Pano here w/me but I'm confident I still see their ads there
and/or in Excellence.  I put their cooler in my 77 Targa (w/no stock cooler
as delivered) with no serious hassles; kit is as close to bolt-on as such
things come.  Horn has to be relocated, and Terbatrol underestimates the 
difficulty of fitting two fat hoses behind the rocker trim, even if dealer-
installed air isn't already using that space.

Terbatrol cooler works, too.  Effect is especially clear when a summer traffic
tie-up unravels.  Without cooler, oil temp stayed over 200 for an hour or
more at speed.  With cooler, temp is down to 180 in just a few minutes.

The troopers use a small transmitter on their person which runs through a
repeater in the car to relay back to the station. The transmitter and the
repeater in the car send sync signals at a regular interval. This is the 
signal picked up by the beartracker. The CHP uses this system, as I remember.

I have a BearTracker with about 5000 miles of road use in my 964. It works as
advertised. E-mail with other users on CompuServe indicates it is especially
effective in CA where the CHiPs tend to leave it on all the time.

Caveats:

Only 36 states have mobex extenders, 16 don't. Check your Mobile Scanner books.

Some of the troopers in mobex states leave it off unless they are out of the
car, Newer Mobex units automatically turn on when the cruiser door opens so the
trooper doesn't forget to use it. This avoids confusion at the dispatcher if 2
units are working within a 3 mile radius. These units work best in rural areas,
the alarm sounds constantly in metro areas as local cops use them too. 

Preprogrammed = not programmable! However the scanner works fine exclusive of
the alarm function giving you a choice of CHiPs, Local cops and NOAA.

There is also a different product called EZE-BLEEDER which is 
essentially a large syringe with a short, angled segment of
tubing to connect to a bleeder screw.  The prescribed use is
to fill the syringe with fluid and pump it into the bleeder
screw, pushing the bubbles up to the master cylinder.  Since
(in my experience, anyway) the dirtiest fluid is in the
caliper, this is backwards for flushing.  I've used the syringes
by extracting the fluid out the bleeder; it works, but the
plunger effort is high and the syringe needs to be emptied
frequently.  Some fluid always manages to leak out onto the 
driveway.  So it's not as elegant a solution as it first seemed.
Those contemplating buying a bleeder would be wise not to
confuse the two products.

There's a larger (full-page) ad in recent AutoWeek editions.  I believe
the transmitter referred to is the RF link between the patrolman's 
walkie-talkie and the cruiser (which then 'repeats' it to the base).
This RF carrier is always active when the car is in the field, so it
should be present anytime a cruiser is nearby.

There was a previous product marketed that used the same principle
(although it didn't have the 'select the state' feature) that was 
named the 'CHiPs Detector', so I believe this would work also.

I went looking for 303 Protectant recently - according to the

America were the two he mentioned.  It's also available mail order
from Performance.  The Bliss Marine stores in Massachusetts are
part of the E&B chain, where I found the 8oz spray bottle for $4.99.
Quart refill bottles are $15.99.

I dont have any experience with Dynamat, but, I do have recent
experience with the sound deadening material that Stoddard/Tweeks
sells for 911/2s.  It only fits the "back" area, not the sides, you
have to buy (approx. $60) a second piece and cut it up to fit.  The
fitting work isnt toooo bad.

The primary problem is getting the stupid thing to stick!  I used the
recommended 3M "Super Trim Adhesive" product which requires
"firm, continuous, and even pressure for 24 hours".  Well, just
try THAT since the material has to hang on the back ledge of the
fire wall!  I had to buy a bunch of small "sticks", cut them to
size, and then prop a piece of cardboard against it to get
even, continuous, and firm pressure - it wasnt pretty, and it
took a good part of my Labor Day weekend.

My engine compartment was freshly stripped and painted - a perfect
clean surface, and I had a H*LL of a time getting it to stay up there.
I dont know what Dynamat is like, but, if its heavier than the "stock"
stuff, you better find SuperGlue in mass quantities to get it to stay there.

Good Luck!

Subject: 931 Oil Cooler system


I see someone suggested using a 931 (924 Turbo) oil cooler system on
a normal 924. 

You will find that the housing and filter for the engine side are 
positioned so they will interfere with the exhaust, either stock or 
headers. The Turbo manifold routes the exhaust around that area. The 
system will NOT work without severe rework. It's easier to build new.

As I've said, Automotion seels the parts to make a 924 (or 914/4)
oil cooler system for your car. Be sure to use a thermostat.

BTW, the cooler position in the Turbo isn't that great, it would work
better in front of the radiator. In Malcom's case, he has no A/C 
condenser in his way. Stand off the cooler about an inch.

Pegasus sells a number of different metric-sized sandwich plates for
just this sort of application.  I am unsure which is the right size for
a 924 or 931.  But coupled with a Mocal oil radiator, some -12 hose,
and the right fitting, I think you'd have what you need.  The only
gotcha to watch for would be that there is nothing in the way of the
filter when its position is "biased" by the thickness of the sandwich
plate.

Hope this help.

There's a hall sender which gets pulsed by a mechanical take-off from the
transmission.  Sounds like the hall sender may be slightly out of

It depends on "who" told you to use the additive.  If its a Porsche

check the accompanying documentation, or call the importer, Autotech in
CA, and get their recommendation.  I don't recommend oil additives of
any kind for Porsches.  A synthetic gear oil, which says it's
compatible with LSD, such as Mobil 1 75W-90, is good enough for me.
Redline and Swepco are overpriced, and additives are money down

Patrick, why don't you get America Online.  $10 per month gets you 5 free
hours and no mail charges.  Compuserve charges for each Internet mail item,
although you get $9 worth included each month.
   On another subject, I rebuilt the engine on my 1970 911E last year 
including a complete valve job.  It runs leaner, now , I assume because it's
breathing better.  Problem is:  I'm getting detonation under hard
acceleration, depending on weather conditions.  Anyone have experience with
Mechanical Fuel Injection that can advise me on how to make the mixture
richer, or should I leave it to the experts?
By the way, is high idle a symptom of lean mixture?  My idle wants to jump up
to about 1500rpm when the engine gets hot.
Thanks,

Hi there,

I noticed recently that when I set the speed 
of the fan to level 1, it does not work. 
However, level 2,3 and 4 work fine. 
The air conditionner which

Subject: 914 pushrod tubes & mpg

I finally did something about those oil puddles on my garage floor last
night -- we changed the pushrod tubes.  The nice thing about the engine
is that you don't have to pull the heads to change the tubes, but we
decided to go one further and not drop the engine, as this would require
disconnecting all kinds of things and then reconnecting them to the
same places.

Well, there's not much room to slide them out (that's sort of like saying
that the Audi quattro engine compartment is pretty full).  You can get
five of the eight pushrods and tubes out without a problem, but they have
to come out and go in *straight*, and the trailing arms are in the way.

Well, we ended up lowering the engine (by undoing the rear transmission
mount and ground strap and lowering it sloooowly), which got two more
tubes out.  To get the last tube out required also lifting the driver's
side trailing arm -- you can get pretty good leverage with a 2x4!  :)

I have to wait and see whether the leaks are gone -- both the engine and
my garage floor are pretty greasy, so it's not immediately apparent.  Not
a piece of cake, though -- good thing we had a hoist.  Kids, don't try
this at home!  :)

On a completely different topic, I finally remembered to look at my gas
mileage when I filled up this morning.  I put in 34L after driving for
182 miles, which works out to about 11.5L/100 km or 20 mpg (US).  Is
this reasonable for a 2/3 highway tankful?  It's certainly worse than
my 2.0L Golf GTI 16V, but I don't know whether that's a valid comparison.
I didn't buy this car for its mpg :), but I do want to know whether this
is normal for a 914.

Thanks for your ears (or eyes!)...

Yeah, my 911S did that too.  I had just had the injection tuned and I went
on a 2K mile trip - guess that burnt all the crusty carbon junk out of the
valve seats, increasing the intake volume (but with the same fuel input).
The symptom was that, when warm, the car had two idle points: 2000 and 1200
rpm, stable at both of them.  I could partially engage the clutch to lug
the engine down to 1200 where it would stay...very wierd.

Anyways, 4 notches counterclockwise on the MFI pump rack adjustment screw
did the trick.  It also lowered the operating temp by about 10 degrees ;-)
I played with it + or - 4 notches, and settled on this setting as the most
powerful (I don't have the portable CO meter...yet).

To access the pump control rack adjustment, you need to remove the socket
head bolt (5.5 or 6mm) just above the shutoff solenoid on the front of the
MFI pump.  Having the MFI tool set (available from Performance Products) is
nice.  The tool to do this is a long T-handled shaft with an allen bit
welded on the end.  You could get by with a regular key...  After the
access bolt is removed, you need a very long narrow flat head screwdriver
to adjust the control rack position.  Insert it in the hole, wiggling it
around, until you feel that it is in the groove of the adjustment screw.
The screw has "notches?" in it's turning - only go 1 or 2 at a time.
CCW is rich, CW is lean.  Remember the original setting in case you really
screw it up.  Obviously, do this with the engine off - drive it after each
modification to see what effect it had if any.

Of course this assumes your throttle linkage bars are all set properly,
your valves adjusted, etc.

There is another bolt to adjust the idle mixture - you probably won't have
to mess with that if it was set properly before.  I talked with a guy who
made the adjustment to this screw by the smell of the exhaust - yuck.

Hi Guys,

Speaking of pushrod tubes, i had a friend with a 911 with leaky Oil
return tubes. He asked me to show him how to do it, so i brough my stuff
which included a set of EXTREMELY large channel lock pliers. I pulled 
the heat exchangers and drained the crankcase oil. Then I used the 
pliers to yank the oil, leaky tubes from the engine. I let him do the 
last two. Then we replaced the tubes with aluminum expanding tupes, 
curing his leaks.

A year of so later, he purchased a 914/4 with what looked like leaking 
oil return tubes. So he purchased a set of pliers like mine and removed 
the heat exchangers and drained the oil from the crankcase. Then he set
about to remove the leaky tubes.

Hi wife informed me after I had to come over and drop the engine and 
trans and cut all the pushrods and tubes out of the engine that he had 
spent 4 hours cursing the F******** B*****s that designed the piece of
Teutonic s***. He was unaware of the fact the 4 cylinder engines had
pushrods.

Sometimes it pays to read the instructions or ask questions........

I have a Century MIG welder I obtained from Sam's for $200.  It's only 70 amps
and doesn't have a variable heat setting (only high and low), but it's worked
well for everything I've run into so far.  It also runs off of 120VAC which is
nice.  It has the attachments for gas not including the valve to turn it on
and off with the trigger - works fine with flux core wire though.  Just have
a wire brush/grinder handy.  Comes with everything you need (mask, wire,
etc.).

Sam's also has a $300 version that's like 85 amps or so with a variable heat
control.  They both have variable wire speed...

This latter version is probably the same one as JC Wittney, so it's a pretty
good deal (esp. if you already have a Sam's membership).

It's called the series resistor and is mounted to the fresh air fan housing
under the plastic cover right behind the fire wall under the hood. There is
a large black plug with a few round prongs that plugs into the back of the
ceramic resistor. I replaced mine with a used one from Asse for about $75,
the new one is close to $130. It did *not* fix the problem. What I found is
that sometimes the fan would go off on the 1,2 or 3 settings but would
always work on #4. It was intermittent, and still is but now happens very
rarely. It seemed for a while that when the fan was on the #3 setting that
would cause it to shut down faster than keeping it on #1 or #4. Have yet to
break out the volt meter and track it down but the series resistor is a
good place to start. Maybe I'll poke around next time mine is acting up.

The resistor block for the fan speed circuit is under that black plastic

is ridiculous.  In the unlikely event the problem is a fried resistor,
just go to an electronics supply house and get a replacement.  Just
guessing from what I remember about the size of them, I think they are 
5 watt, but you will be able to tell for sure if you pull them out.  I had

I have a bit of an amusing story for the rest of you.

About 2 weeks ago, I was driving over to my girlfriend's house
and my 911 started making this terrible noise.  Kind of a scraping
noise.  Still ran great, just this clanging scraping noise.

You guessed it, I lost a chain tensioner.

I limp the car over to Lois's and leave it there until the next 
weekend (I've been procrastinating about installing the pressure
fed tensioners - they're in the garage ready to put in).

Here's the "funny" part.

Chain tensioner failure is contagious.

Lois's 911 ate one 3 days later.

Put the new ones in last weekend.  No real problems.  If anyone is 
contemplating the job it took me about 10-12 hours over 2 days.

A few suggestions that will save a bit of time.

1-      Drain crankcase oil.  Oil tank may stay full.

2-      Remove screen - look for debris (I found none).

3-      Put the car on stands **as high as you can**

4-      Remove:
            A/C compressor.  Tie to engine cover to keep out of way.
            A/C compressor bracket.
            Muffler.
            Left side heater hoses (2) in engine compartment (on 911sc).
            Left side heater hose under engine sheet metal.
            Distributor - put engine to #1 TDC first.

5-      Disconnect the hard oil line on right side of engine, not the
        one to the oil tank.

6-      Unplug oxy sensor.

7-      Remove muffler.

8-      Lower engine as much as practical (several inches) with floor jack.

9-      Remove cover over the main pully (on end of crank).

10-     Remove rear engine sheet metal.

Now you can begin the real job!

I'm hoping for a one day job this weekend.

OK, I need the wide-ranging experience of porschephiles for a
"problem" that keeps cropping up. Jim Pasha and I go round and
round on this with some regularity. 

In 1988 there were produced some 924S cars that I know as an SE
model. They were all black, had some pinstriping, cloth 
seats in an ugly (sorry, I don't care for them) striped pattern.
All this is relatively ordinary, but the ones I have seen all
have a fully adjustable front suspension (ala late model 944S2)
with the screw type height adjustment. The rear is swaybarred.
Wheels are 6 & 7 x15 in the 928 phone dial style. Some have LSD.

This is the car that Franklin Wong drives in SCCA autocrosses with
pretty good success.

The point of contention is the front suspension. Jim maintains that
these cars were never delivered with it.  He says he saw Franklin's
car when he first bought it and it didn't have the adjustable front
suspension. I have no reason to dispute what he saw, but I've seen
two others that looked the same, with the adjustable suspension.

Are these cars a recognizable "special" factory model? 
Can anyone out there can shed some light on this mystery (preferably
with some proof) I would be most grateful.

I agree that $90 (or $70) is ridiculous, the problem may well not be the
resistor, and, if it is, an external resistor is a good fix. However,
I am confident that they need to be more than 5 W. for that sort of
fan motor. When I had mine apart, my recollection is that the resistors
were mounted to metal as a heat sink, so it may be hard to judge
the wattage rating of the OEM part. I also recollect that they
didn't look like standard commercial power resistors, also making it
hard to judge the rating. I would expect something in the 25 watt range.

I replaced the oil return tubes on my 81' 911SC without having to 
remove the heat exchangers.  As I recall, the procedure was rather

Hi Guys,

On a 911 or 914/6 it is much easier to remove the heat exchangers to 
do the oil return tubes, especially with the 74-early type exchangers.

Yes, there is a risk of removing studs or breaking them when trying to 
remove the exchangers.. This can be minimized by using LOTS of 
penetrating on the nuts. It helps to have 12 and 13mm swivel-sockets
to reach in at the angles and a long 6 or 8 mm hex allen(it's been a few
years since I did this)sockets handy. If a nut seems to bind when trying
to remove it, tighten it slightly and hit it with more oil to prevent
metal bind. Studs removed with nuts can be replaced, I don't use exhaust
nuts over again unless I'm at the track and can't find any. 

I use the expansion-type return tubes with RTV type sealant, they won't 
leak again if everything is clean.

Sure, the later cars have more access on one side, but you should remove
those things when you do it. ALWAYS use new exhaust gaskets where you 
break a connection.

For informational purposes, Century makes a non-gas MIG welder
for $269.00 at the local hardware store (Builder's Square) here
in IL.  The gas kit brings it into the $300 range.
Not too fancy, but, does the job.  I agree the gas MIGs
are nicer/cleaner, but, more $$ up front - $339 is a good price, however.
I guess it depends on just how much welding you have to do, how
easy it is to get gas, and whether you are tacking stuff in
or trying to make long continous welds. 

BTW - I thought long continous welds weakened the metal??
	I also dont seem to remember seeing many original continous
	welds where there wasnt any rust holes on my 912, but, then
	I replaced just about everything but the roof!  :-).

Subject: RE: 924s


What David Blanchard and I are trying to find are actual Porsche
catalog documents that have a) an option number; b) a list of what the
components are by Porsche P/N that made up the option. 

If it wasn't offered as an option on a US delivered car, then it ins't 
legal for competition under SCCA, Pro-Solo or PCA (PCRs). There are 
specific passages that state "as delivered in the USA". All street
licensed autos must be certified and registered to comply, any options,
such as gear ratios, wheel/tire sizes are also certified with DOT and 
EPA when the car is certified for sale.

Gray-market cars aren't legal. Ask a few people with 911SCs and 
Carreras that were protested and disqualified at a Parade or two.

The issue at hand is that there was a word-of-mouth car that no formal
documentation says exists, but a number of enthusiasts seem to have 
found. If there is no supportive documentation, then it's not legal. 

Don't get rash like the Honda owner did and make it up, he was banned 
from SCCA competition for a few years over that. 

If the documentation really exists, I would like a copy to verify with 
PCNA, Holbert P/A  and Porsche, AG.

Remember, just 'cause it fits doesn't mke it legal to run. i.e. a 3.0
into a 914/6.

Jim and Dave,

The PCNA 1988 Fact Book does call out "Special Edition Versions" as an
available option for the 924S, as well as some other models.

I cannot put my hands on anything specific about these SE's.  Their story
reminds me a lot of the 944S2 Firehawk cars.  These are, to the best of
my knowledge, street-legal US cars.  However, the factory pulls them off
the line and puts a lot of rather non-standard stuff into them.  And takes
other stuff away.  Perhaps they fall under the M030 catch-all, but I kind
of wonder.

I would probably get the option codes off one of these SE's rear valence,
then go to the fiche and match up corresponding parts.  For example, for
the 944-series, there is a ton of special part (numbers) called out for
option M030.

Well, I guess I am a real 944S owner.

Last night I was sitting at a stop light, and the engine just stopped. Nice and
quietly. I turned off the ignition, put the car in neutral and called a tow
truck.

Porsche hasn't called back with a diagnosis, but I am guessing that it is 
(suprise) a broken timing belt. Now for the question: How much should I expect
to pay to have it fixed//replaced valves//etc. The car was idling at 900 rpm
when it stopped, and it did stop quickly. Are my valves still trashed? Also,
what other things should I replace while it is apart (I remember reading that
one of the pullys should be replaced. Which one?)

And the belt had 45K miles on it. I had scheduled it to be replaced monday.
Sigh... 

For the record, it was a .02 belt, I had it retensioned at 30K (and re-retened
at 32K), on the advice of the Porsche mechanic who said that the belt looked
"Like new", and why did I want to replace it?

Chris,

Sorry to hear your news.  I am not sure, but I think you're looking at
about 20 hours of labour.  PCNA paid for most of my labour and all of my
parts when it happened to me.

PCNA told a 944 Turbo-owning friend that there was a 3% chance that a
broken belt won't trash the valves.  Depends on exactly where in the cycle
that things let go, he was told.  Dunno whether that figure holds for
four-valvers.  In my case, I think it was exhaust valves.  I've seen both
sets of valves get tootsed.

In my car, they replaced "everything the belt touched."  All the pulleys,
for one thing.  I've never dissected the RO, but I think they updated a
bunch of stuff in the top end as well, like the oil pipe, chain, and its
tensioner.

Where did you take your car?  Please don't say "Chambers."  I can recommend
a few good dealerships and independants in the Boston area if that helps.

I finally purchased an HTP unit which is the choice of many of the racers on

opted of the 220 unit. If you're looking for a good buy, that's not as ex-

I put (used) pre 74 heaters/ 2 inlet muffler on my '79 SC. The RH line was
indeed rusted/corroded to the thermostat block. I used lots of penetrating
oil (Kroil) over two days, then very large crescent wrenches. It took about
30 minutes of continuous, strenuos effort, being careful not to bend the 
block to far out of position. A few hammer blows were ineffective and I quit
hammering because the potential for damage seemed to high. The old line was
also somewhat rusty, probably contributing to the problem. After the old line
was out, I wiped the block clean and installed the new line with teflon on
the threads (in case it becomes necessary to refit the stock exhaust). I 
don't have access to a dyno, but I notice a slight increase in low RPM 
acceleration, and about a 5 mpg decrease (from ~25 to ~20 mpg). IMO, this 
is the proper exhaust configuration for a 911.

I agree on the possibility of the DEALER special edition. Unfortunately,
dealer installed options ARE NOT allowed by SCCA rules unless it can be

Nothing.  There is more to pleasure cars than country of origin.  That is
something that to the autophile/holic is probably of little consequence; or
it should be.  Cars should be enjoyed for the pleasing sounds and forces they
place on the driver, and the pleasing curves, nuts and bolts on the
maintainer.  I own cars from England, Germany, Japan, and the United States.
I have the cars I do not because they were built in Abingdon or Stuttgart or
Hiroshima, but because of the total package and experience.  If you take
pleasure in driving the car you have, and enjoy sworking (swearing and
working) on it in your garage, what difference does it make where it was
manufactured.  Most of my cars are older than what you normally see on the
road, they are paid for, and I do my own maintenance on them.  Only my wife's
daily driver/tow vehicle is new, but I plan on doing the work my self.  We
picked the vehicle (I deem that Suburbans are much to large to be called
cars) for the features it had and not who built it.

I'd imagine that your friend with the Alfa has done the same thing.  Each of
his cars is different and he enjoys them for different things.  

I'd like to have an Alfa someday.  And an old stock 240Z, and a Jaguar Mk II,
and a big Healey 100-6, and an Amilcar, and a Norton, and a Hummer, and a tow
truck, and .... well you get the idea.

Okay, now that I've ordered my 'Street Quiet' Bursch exhaust
($165 on sale from Tweeks) for my '66 912, I've got two more problems:

Problem 1:
The far "driver's left" gauge in my 912 is a tempature gauge
for outside air.  A long mesh-covered solid wire runs from
the gauge to the front of the car and terminates near the battery
in a loose coil.  And always reads 80 degrees, which isnt correct.

1.  Is there something supposed to be at the END of the mesh-covered wire?

2.  Is it the gauge itself that needs to be repaired?  This is my assumption,
given that I can not find any evidence that something is supposed to
be at the end of the wire.


Problem 2:
The person who applied the paint to my car took the wiring harness
all apart near the engine compartment, and there are a few wires
I have no idea how they are to be "run" through the compartment.
I have a color wiring diagram, but, its no help to know how they are
supposed to be "snaked" through the car.  Is there anything I
can buy (some manual, etc.) that shows this in great detail!?
The parts/workshop manuals are no help.

I guess my only other solution, is to find a 912 owner in IL and
"inspect" his car and draw a map - any volunteers??

wish to computerize my limited number of Porsche parts so I will quit
ordering stuff I already have.  I would also like to track Porsche-type
contacts and other stuff.  For me the nonprogrammer, with no real intention
of becomming one, would I be better with Access or Approach.  I am thinking
if this wouldn't be too much trouble, it would certainly be better than
me searching for the correct rubber grommet when all those look the same.

Subject: parts (or other) database software

For a modest database project like the one you outline, anything from Nutshell
to DB2 will do the job.  Probably better to base your decision on other factors:
.  which can you get local (ie not vendor's telephone) support
.  which does your employer/spouse/neighbor use
.  which does local region's PX use 
.  for which, if either, has someone already built an appropriate inventory
structure you can plagiarize

I'd suggest a judgement about the longevity of the product, but I don't know
how to do that -- sometimes bad products happen to good companies.

Probably would make sense to fast-talk someone else into sharing the work, 
swapping the parts, sharing the benefits, to get economies of scale by 
inventorying two or more garages, rather than just yours.  Otherwise realistic
computation of the value of the time you spend will be the same $.35/hour that
I pay myself when I work in the garage.

Subject: 911T - 5th gear problems

I just got back from vacation yesterday and found that I cannot shift into
5th gear anymore on my '73 911T w/CIS.  A friend of mine used my car who was
not too used to manual transmission so what I am wondering is:  Could it have
been the way he was driving it?  

One other note is that about 1month ago, oil started dripping from between
the engine and transmission.  The car still ran OK, so I have been putting off
checking it out(it is my only car), could the leaking oil have an affect on
shifting?

thanks for any advice!
Steve

ps.  when I bought the car in november, I had the engine and tranny pulled,
sychros checked, and a new clutch put in.  It is still under warranty for this
and on Monday I'm taking it in to the guy who did the work(Tom @ T&D Performance
in campbell CA)  Hopefully this problem will be covered, but I would rather go
in there with some knowledge instead of totally ignorant.

The manuals have always said that it should be filled to a level about
6 to 8 mm below the bottom edge of the filler port.  I, Mr. Anal, made
a little dip stick for this from a piece of thin brass flat stock.  I
bent it at right angles, and scribed lines at 6 and 8 mm from the bend.
I find it kind of hard to judge with my finger, because for some reason
tranny oil feels like nothing to me when I stick my finger in it.

Btw, use this same right-angled goober to measure the clutch release
lever travel and friction disk depth.

I don't know the reason for this fill level, but you could be right.  If
you fill the tranny with one of those goose-neck pumps, be careful.  One
of the gears is pretty much right in front of the filler port.  It could
block the goose-neck's "exit," and you'd think from the fluid being
pushed back out the filler that you're done.  Happened to a mechanic
once.

Start the car with the temp control at minimum.  Have someone turn it to
maximum while you have an eye on the heater valve, seeing whether it
opens.  You should see the linkage from the vacuum diaphragm move from
one end of travel to the other.

On your car, I think the heater valve is between the back of the block
and the fire wall, spliced into the coolant hose coming off the heater
pipe which runs along the exhaust side of the block.  These valves
fail with time.  Unfortunately, where they are, a failure can also mean
coolant dribbling onto the clutch bell, and into it and onto the clutch.
This can ruin the clutch as a few netters have learned.

Hope this helps.  If not, it should give you a start one way or the other.

I finally got fed up, last winter, looking for old invoices to chase down
obscure parts.  Since it was a particularly vile winter weekend, I
decided that I had nothing better to do than to take my invoice file and
bang everything into the home PC.  There were some part numbers I was
clueless about, but most of them got tied back to what they were.

Now for the really weird part.  I used Lotus Notes.  At the time, I was
developing an application based on its API.  On the plus side, I can
replicate my home and office databases as easy as, er, 1-2-3.  On the
negative side, the product really isn't suited to this sort of application
for a lot of reasons.  For example, its report generation flexibility is
really nowhere near that of, for example, Paradox.

I think you'd probably be fine using just about any PC database lying
around.  They're all really good about export to/import from a text
file, so changing horses in the future should be easy.

  I introduced it to the region a few years back and thats how we do our

  Depending on your requirements, it could take anywhere from 1/2 hour up to

From: RICHARD3300@delphi.com
Subject: More on MIG Welders Chapter 2

A couple of more thoughts for anyone contemplating the lower buck MIG welders.
Check out the drive roller assembly that feeds the wire to the squirt gun. On
most of the lower cost units the drive rollers and pressure rollers are all
PLASTIC. They just don't hold up long term and eventually groove out from the
wire itself. Also as they don't transmit a continuous pressure (plastic
compresses) and feed to the wire, feed is sporadic making it harder to weld
in a smooth manner.  

Look at the manner in which the gun and cabel assy connects to the housing
Is it removeable? On most of the smaller units the cable just runs into the 
main housing with no strain relief or disconnect. Look at the switch in the
gun itself. Again most are real cheap and break after usage - they get alot
of wear as most people plug weld or stitch weld.

Finally what is the total weight of the welder? It's a good indicator of the
general construction - transformers, capacitors, etc. The unit I almost 
bought weighed less than 80lbs. The one I bought weighs 160lbs. 

I agree with the observation that cheap tools are a source of never ending
frustration and you get to buy everything twice. In the long run it costs
too much. And it only took me 41 years to learn this!

Steve,

You didn't mention if the oil was from the engine or transmission.  If it is transmission oil the input shaft seal my have failed.  I had this happen a few years ago and went from 3.5+ qts of fluid to less than .5 qts which definitely makes shifting harder.  Unfortunately it went during a drivers ed at Sebring and I managed to cook 2nd gear (it's a pretty blue color now).

If it turns out it is a leaking seal it may have been damaged when pulling the gear cluster to check the syncros so I would expect it to be covered under warranty.

(Probably too fast if he was in 5th!)

The shift into 5th problem is probably just adjustment
of the lockout plate which is located under the rubber
boot at the base of the shifter. It's just matter of 
loostening a couple of bolts and moving it a bit - but
be sure to try all the gears before you go too far from
home (slip it into gear and let your foot out on the
clutch a little bit) The lockout is important to keep
you out of reverse when you're headed for third.

The oil probably isn't too critical either, if it's just
an occasional drip. Almost all of them drip, even with new
seals. The problem is probably the input shaft seal which
is either a pain in the neck to replace (have to split
the transmission case sections, take out the differential
etc) or easy (changed from the bell housing) depending on
whether you have an early or late 915 transmission. Generally
it can wait until the engine comes out for something else,
but if someone told you that they changed the seals, they
may have skipped the input shaft seal because of the hassle
or because they couldn't see how to get at it.

good luck,

 -Reid

Hi all-

After checking out the obvious places for fuel tank leaks
(filler, fuel tank sender, etc.), we have found that (after
dropping the tranny and the tank, and taking the tank to
a radiator shop), it seems that the tank is the culprit.
(The current tank has some corrosion near the top, and 
some near the seams in the tank middle).

Getting a new tank is obviously out of the question.  My
mechanic mentioned to me that a tank can be redone with epoxy,
in and out, to seal everything up.   Or should I get a used
tank, and hope (*that*) one doesn't go?  Anyone have experiences
that they would like to share?

M.Seibert just e-mailed me this morning, and mentioned that
he got a used tank from a salvage yard, with no problems to
date.  Given this one data point, I'll go spring for a used
tank; any other comments/stories are appreciated.

I had some wheels re-chromed at Highland Plating in L.A. a few years

and disassembly/reassembly of the wheels(they were BBS 3 piece wheels). 
The quality of their work was good. I can get an address if

I'm familiar with the R5 Turbo, our local hotshoes, the Archer Brothers, came 
up racing Renaults of various kinds and even had an R5 Turbo that was used to 
chase parts around town.  I have about 30 variations of the car in my model 
collection, all quite colorful.  Tommy Archer said the thing was a real 
handful and he cut his teeth ice racing (what else is there to do up here for 
eight months?).  It was a product of the FIA rally rules that encouraged such 
cars as the Ford RS 200, the Quatro, Lancia Stratos and 037, and the unlovely 
English Metro.  Too bad those days are gone.

Subject: Gravity and 944 upper-mount brake light

I had an interesting failure the other day:  the rear brake light mounted to
the glass hatch fell off.  It dangled from its wires.

I spoke to a person at PCNA.  He said that hot weather sometimes weakens the
glue on these fixtures and they fall off.

If this happens to anyone, here is what to do ...

Buy some one-half inch wide 2-sided sticky tape -- the padded foam kind.
Do NOT use the non-foam kind, which won't work.

Open up the light fixture into its two halves, which is easily done by 
removing the two screws on the sides. Unplug the fixture from the car.

Clean any residue from the original sticky tape remaining on the hatch and
also from the fixture mounting plate.  Place two lengths of sticky tape on the
large bottom area of the mounting plate and one length on the narrow top part.
I also suggest that you trim two pieces to about 3/8-inch width and place them
on the sides. Carefully press the mounting plate into position on the black
plastic which is bonded to the hatch glass. Replug the wires into the
harness, fit the two halves of the fixture together and fasten the two screws.
The job is complete.

Subject: Fuel tank treatment (more hands-on from Kyle)


  Greetings,
  fuel tanks...
  I just finished treating my 914 tank inside and out with Wurth's
  Rust Guard, silver on the inside and black on the outside.

  A BIG THANK_YOU to STAN for the pointer to Wurth's coatings.

  This stuff is 'rock hard' as the hype sez.
  Not a paint, but a 'polymer derivative', more like plastic in a can IMO.
  It is sensitive to UV, so must be overcoated if exposed to sun.
  I sprayed it with a Blue-Point 400 jamb gun...be sure to CLEAN UP
  afterward or trash the gun.  The finish from RG black not the best...
  scuff it with scotchbrite to make tooth for the OEM black, no rubbing
  needed after.  Looks/smells like -new-.

  Dunno how it will turn out, but the cost was ~$50 for the 
  coatings plus a little for panel prep.  I did spend considerable time
  prepping the tank (sandblasting in and out, metal patching/finishing).
  If it works, will eliminate further problems (new or used).
  Seems silly to get a used tank -why substitute a used tank for a used
  tank? fix the one you got, if its fixable of course.  
  I forget that many of you out there have bux to burn...I dont.

  ++914 restore status++

  I had a lot of black left over so...I put it on my car's body
  to Encapsulate her innards, now I am about to put another couple
  quarts on all the other not-so-cosmetic surfaces.
  Following this will be coats of WURTH's seam sealer, schutz, and SKS.
  I have discovered Wurth...hhs2000 really is good stuff!
  Beats the synthetic sperm-whale oil I been using (bike chain lube).
  Expensive potions and liquids.

You should not have any problem switching to synthetic.  I wouldn't think
that a synthetic oil will make your car run any cooler, though.  If you
have an overheating problem, the solution probably lies elsewhere.

Subject: 944S a/c compressor - mount repair


Fellow porsche-ills sufferers, 

Can anyone give me advice on the (re-) mounting of a 
1987 944S a/c compressor? 

The front bolt sheared in the compressor mounting lug.
Q1. Drill a pilot hole and use a bolt remover?. 

At the rear mount, the lug on the compressor body 
broke off, across the bolt hole. I still have the piece 
 - it stayed on the bolt end. 

Q2. CAN this be welded back in place and then drilled 
and tapped?  The compressor body is some kind of alloy,
which may not help.

Q3. Recommend a machine shop who might do this work, 
in the Bay Area. 

Q4. Also, a _reliable_ shop who could drain, and then 
refill the a/c system. Hopefully in less than the 3.0
hours the last charged me.

Q5. Is a replacement a better way to go? A compressor 
replacement from a breaker's yard is $350 but mine 
is otherwise ok. The part says Nippon Denso. Is it
by any chance the same as one for a Japanese/Audi/other
econobox, at say, $49.95 ? 


Advice on this new low in porsche mechanicals very much
appreciated. 


Thanks,

Hi! 

Based on the research I did for the recent purchase of my '87 944T, the 
significant changes are: 

	. dual airbags became std in '87 
	. ABS was first available in '87 

Under the hood, the 2.5 L put out 217 HP until '89 when it went up to 250 HP. 
I looked up old copies of Road & Track in the local library for road tests for 
each model year.  R&T also did a long-term test with a 944T in '87. 

Happy hunting!

Subject: Re: 924S

I own an '87 924S with M030 suspension, and have therefore done a lot of
research on the car and the '88 M756 option.  My experience is that
Porsche tends to not document very well special cars/options .  However,
the following pieces of information convince me the M030 suspension on
the 924S was available from the factory beginning in '87.

1)  Our local Porsche dealer has one of the '88 black 924S cars with the
special option M756.  He had no idea the car had the M030 suspension
(either when he sold it new, or now, as he is trying to sell it used).
He, the dealer, did not modify the car.  (If you are interested, the "M"
options listed in the spare tire well include:  030, 160, 360, 657, 756,
990.  M756 is listed in the options book as "'88 Special Model").

2)  The '88 special addition car is not unique to America.  (Franklin
Wong told me there were 400 build for the US.; all black.  I do not have
documentation to support the number or that all were the same color.)
In the UK. there were 74 build with the special suspension; half were
white and half were black.  The cars were call "LeMans" edition cars and
had a "LeMans" script on the outside of the car.  The suspension
features matched the US. black cars.

3)  I have a February '87 parts fische for the 924S (given to me by my
dealer).  It lists the M030 suspension as optional on the 924s, and has
all the parts for the M030 on the 924S fische.

4)  The Porsche "Little Spec. Book" for the 944/924S lists the M030
option for the 924S and describes all the suspension parts.

5)  Finally, Franklin Wong said the '88 special 924S was described in
the Porsche sales document "1988 Porsche Fact Book".  I tried to obtain
a copy, but the dealer was out (in 1992).

With the above documentation, I am convinced the M030 was not a dealer
option.  Further, I am convinced the '88 special edition was built by
the factory (for what purpose I'm not sure).

Hi! 

I'm evaluating different chips for my '87 944T.  So far, I've looked at 
Autothority, Hypertech and SuperChips.  From what I've read, Autothority seems 
to have the most experience and I'm looking at their Stage II chip with 270HP. 
SuperChips claim 281HP from their chip. I will be taking the car to the track. 

I'm interested in hearing about reduction in turbo lag, torque increase,

I have to disagree with you here, Kevin.  I agree that there should be no
problem in switching to synthetic at 85k miles, but I DO believe it will
make a difference in the operating temperature.  After switching to
synthetic in my Vette I noticed that my oil temps at the track were down a
good 30 degrees over previous lapping sessions.  Simple theory here - less
friction means less heat!  In an air-cooled engine the lower oil temp
should definitely have an impact on engine temp...IMHO of course...

'
Subject: Re: 911T - 5th gear problems

Sorry for including the whole note, but time for me is short.
I agree with an earlier poster on this probably being an adjustment (or,
try that as a fix first).  I had the coupler shift a little which caused
5th and reverse to get hard to reach.  Other easy things to check are the
condition of the nylon socket that holds the end of your shifter, the nylon
inserts in your shift coupler -- if these are worn much, replace and then
adjust per below.  Note that the shift coupler nylon inserts come sort of oval
when new, but it's hard to tell how much wear there is without holding
a new one next to yours.  There is no reverse lockout adjustment in the tower.
(at least on mine, anyway).

to adjust:
Remove the cover plate on the tunnel between and behind the front seats.

Mark the location of the shift shaft (comes from the shifter in front) relative
to the shift coupler.  Fingernail polish would work.

With the trans in 1st gear, loosen the bolt & nut (13mm) that locks the shift
shaft to the coupler.  Have someone else hold the shift lever solidly and try
not to move the coupler end too much.

Adjust by moving the shift lever first to the left til it hits the limit of
movement (hits the side of the tower) back it off an inch or so (to the right).
tighten the bolt and nut while still holding the shift lever position (takes
two again), be sure not to change the fore/aft position (much, anyway).

test drive to be sure all the gears are selectable -- minor adjustment may
be necessary.  Be sure your reverse lockout is being contacted -- try a 5th
to 4th downshift by pulling straight back and then over and down, shouldn't
grind reverse -- if it does lever needs to be further to the right (more
than an inch)

BTW: 5th and reverse are the easiest and most likely serviceable gears for
the shadetree mechanic to work on in a 915 trans.  They only require removal of
the trany nose cone to get to and don't require sophisticated alignment tools
like the rest of the cluster does...  Don't be afraid to attack it.

are considering Carlsen in Palo Alto for replacement of the clutch slave 
cylinder (944) but have not heard a thing about the quality of their work.  

Any interest out there among those of you doing your own repairs that
would be interested in this job?  The car is parked at Stanford.  

From life on crutches,

Hi:
Thanks T.C. and Kevin for your input on the use of synthetic oil. I have
another question concerning the possiblity of synthetic oil leaking
around seals on an older car. Right now, I don't have any leak problems
with my 911. Would the addition of a new type of oil cause any problems
with the old engine seals?

I have experienced problems with the wonderful cleaning effect of synthetics
removing the sludge that is sealing the gaskets, especially those gaskets
with high oil contact time (ie. valve cover, etc). I still use synthetics
anyway. I feel that a gasket that is being sealed with sludge needs to be
replaced anyway.

Subject: 924S-SE



 If its of interest to anyone I can fax a copy of the sales brochure 
published by PCNA in 1988. This brochure seems to contain the info 
regarding the so called 924S-SE. The document itself is produced for the 
commemoration of the 250,000 911 built and three special edition cars 
were manufactured to celebrate this, a 911, 944 and 924S. There is not 
much mechanical information but generalized descriptions of what makes 
these cars special editions is listed. The cover shows three gold 
medalions one specific to each of the models and presumably each new 
owner got one. By the e-mail descriptions Ive read I am sure these are 
the cars. Also these cars are not the same as the 911 25th anniversary 
editions which had Ferry Porsches signature on the headrests (as well asa 
some other options).

Subject: Dumb questions from a first time por$che owner


I had the good fortune to find a 74 911S that had been setting for two years.
All the gas had evaporated and turned to varnish(you can't imagine what
that does to a 74's fuel injection.  It was pretty rough, but cheap.

During the past year it has been painted, new interior, new gas tank, new
windshield, new fuel tank, etc.   It now runs and looks pretty good.

Because this is my first porsche, I am not sure of some things.

1.  It it normal for this model to be cold natured.  It coughs and sputters,
backfires(I installed a pop off valve).  Once it warm it idles OK and runs
OK(see next question), it's just hard to start and after it does start it
seems to be in a bad mood for a while.

2.  I took it to a porsche place to get it checked over and they said "great
car", and adjusted the timing to spec.  The first few time I drove the car
I was disappointed in the performance, but I was driving kinda timidly.  One
day when I went to pull on the freeway and got above 4000 RPM, it was like
turbo's kicked in!  I was impressed.  My question is is this normal.  I almost
feel like the timing is off?  Should it have the power spread thru more of the
RPM range?  I experimented a little and advanced it myself.  It started easier
cold but would not start when it was hot, so I went back to the origional setting.

Thanks

  Droppings.  Actually, I havent seen the varmint, just calling cards.
  After pooping on my brand new gloves (the opossum, not ME!), I 
  declared war and set out some
  mouse traps.  The traps are too small to harm, but soon I will get a
  live trap and move the critter to the woods. (if i dont break his neck)
  This all happened in a shed last week sometime.  My parts from the 914
  project (amazing how many) are stored there along with some spares.
  The victim speedo was laying in a box face-up (naturally, the taped-off
  back was facing down) and it (opossum) let fly on the glass. This soaked
  thru the bezel and into the housing.  When I picked it up I noticed liquid
  on the rim and looking at the guage with smelly stuff rolling around
  inside.  Hey! It can happen.
  This prompted me to educate the net on yet another of my many experiences.

  Perhaps this particular speedometer should be sent to VDO or 
  Hollywood speedo's for repair and calibration =;>.

  Far as I know, 914's never had liquid filled guages...

Thirty degrees is a lot.  What grade mineral oil were you using beforehand?
And what grade synth did you switch to?  Yes, less friction means less
heat generated by friction.  But you really have to ask yourself why the
synth is responsible for less friction.  Catastrophic failure of the
mineral oil?  Blow-by?  What were the "before" and "after" oil temps?

I'm sure you can read a temperature gauge as well as the next guy.  But
this great a change in oil temp is very atypical.

My experience has been that switching to synth netted little or no change
in engine oil temp.  I do see significantly different temperatures
depending on the track (ie, one track vs another), ambient temperature
and humidity, and just how hard I'm pushing.  Like about 15 degrees F.

There is a degree of adjustability in the mixture and in the idle.  The
mixture can be adjusted at the air flow meter, and the idle at the
throttle body.  I wouldn't try adjusting either without a Sun analyzer
(eg), which is where the "take it to a professional" comes into
play.  There rarely is any need to adjust the settings, anyways.

Subject: 944T Chip Upgrades

Steve,

My vote is for Autothority.  Advertising is one thing, but proof on the
track is everything, and their R&D into the entire package really
makes the difference.  Plus, they speak intelligibly on the phone,
whenever I call with questions, and they warrantee their products.

The chips are only capable of doing three things:

1) Modifying ignition timing and fuel pressure (which is why the 
     octane reqt. goes up)

2) Increasing red line by changing electronic rev limiter

3) Increasing boost pressure by changing control pressure on the
     wastegate, and fooling KLR computer (anti-knock system,
     another reason for higher octane)

Turbo lag is a function of the design/size of the turbo and the
mass/volume of exhaust gas your engine makes.  Thus, little can be
done electronically to influence turbo lag (perhaps modulating the
rate of wastegate opening)

Torque increase is how you get HP increase, but again, chips have
the most influence in high RPM's when the boost is on and timing
advances are most useful.  Don't expect any low RPM torque 
improvement, but with Autothority chips, you shouldn't see any
losses either.

When performance exceeds design limits of the engine, there is a
decrease in reliability.  If Porsche ever publishes TRUE design 
limits on their products, then we will know where that reliability
line lies.  Until then, you can assume you have crossed it if you
put chips in your car.

Regarding performance, The KLR chip which increases boost is the
only set-o-the-pants improvement I have noticed.  I've had an OEM
turbo cup DME chip, and couldn't feel the difference, but could
see it on the rev limit.  Other than that, unless you have your
own dyno, you have to take the manufacturer's word for it.

As far as fuel economy, or dis-economy, as the case may be, more
boost means more air, which means more fuel.  At highway speeds,
when you're just into a bit of boost, the difference should be
negligible.

Wayne,

Yes, a '74 CIS system is cold-natured.  It doesn't have some of the
cold start and warm start accessories that clog the engine bays of
later CIS cars.  A '77 CIS motor is better-natured IF every accessory
on the motor is operating correctly.  Unfortunately, these add-ons
are more prone to fail than the basic components.  I have a '76 with
most of those gadgets.  I should say "had" because I removed them
and have learned to live without them.  So it takes me another 40
seconds to start up in the morning.  Big Deal.

As for the power band starting at ~4000 RPM, yes, this is normal.
It can be adjusted with ignition timing some, and with cam timing
more, but there are trade-offs, as you discovered.

Subject: 944 Fuel Mixture


Ken,

To properly adjust the mixture, you will need a machine that gives you
the percentages of CO and HC. Of course you can do seat of the pants, 
but the engine will not perform correctly. The mixture must be read at 
the port in front of the catalytic converter to be accurate.

The adjustment screw is under a plug on the metering box next to the 
air cleaner, it must be drilled out to reach the adjuster.

Unless you suspect that there is something wrong, leave it alone. If 
you have put in a chip or changed the exhaust, it is imperative that
the mixture be checked and adjusted if necessary.

Subject: 924S

Hi Guys,

OK, I've sent a lot of message traffic around the country and a few 
phone calls about this car. Here's what's real according to Porsche and 
all.

Kevin gross and a few other people were 100% correct in that the car was
a commerative job. The only trick thing was the availability of the 
944 Sport Suspension and 6 & & inch x 15 " wheels. 16 x 6 wheels were 
also available, with a $1,700 tag on them.

For the front and rear suspension, the springs, torsion bars and sway
bars were the same as offered on the 944 Sport package that year.

The microfiche and Porsche build orders DO NOT list ANY 951 components
for use in the suspension. This would include spindles and strut 
assemblies as they are unique to the 944 Turbo (and later selected S2s
and 968s).

The correct part numbers for the strut assemblies on all 924S varients
are:

	944.343.031.12  L
	944.343.032.12  R  Standard, either F&S, Boge

	944.343.031.11  L  Standard Koni
	944.343.032.11  R

	944.343.051.00  L  Sport Koni (from 944 Sport)
	944.343.052.00	R
	944.343.059.00      Replacement insert for Sport Struts.

	477.411.105.  O or Q (can't make it out) Standard springs
		      G       Sport Spring

The reason for this clairification is that there are a few people that 
would have you believe that 951 Club Sport front struts were delivered 
or offered on the 924S. They were NOT. Porsche would have to support
these in the field and provide parts for the model.
The 951 Club Sport has unique struts and spindles, requiring a smaller
(overall diameter as well as height) and the use of the calipers offered on that model.

So, to the few people out there that have been BSing the sanctioning 
bodies, stop it not. You don't make the other Porsche competitors very
happy by being so blatant about using components that do not belong on 
your car. A Porsche win in an illegal car isn't much of a victory. The 
other b******s have to do it, look at what they drive.

Thanks to Kevin, Mike, Dave and the rest that sent mail.

You should not have any problem switching to synthetic.  I wouldn't think

Hello,

     I have an '87 944S with the sport suspension.  My problem is, when I 
have it aligned I ask for the max possible Caster and all that my shop can 
get is approximately 1 degree negative on both sides.  I think the spec. is 
about 3-3.5 degrees.  I am using negative 1 degree of Camber on all four 
corners and zero toe.  The alignment shop tells me I need new Caster 
bushings (the eccentric bushings at the rear of the front A-arms, this is 
the only place he adjusts the Caster) and my mechanic says that these don't 
wear out.  I have owned the car for 1.5 years and have always had this 
problem.  I think the front end has had minor (?) body work.  I don't think 
this caused this problem due to the fact that both sides max out at 
approximately the same amount of Caster and if body damage were responsible, 
I would expect there to be a difference from side to side.

     Thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: Cruise control question


I seem to be experiencing a problem with the cruise control on my '84 Carrera
It seems to decelerate very slowly once the desired speed is set. I'm able to
accelerate using the control lever, so electrically I believe everything is ok.

My next guess is the servo. I noticed that there are two hoses connected to it,
one about 1/4", the other about 1/2". The thin hose is connected to a vacuum
feed from the engine. The thick hose goes into a an oval hole (about 1" x 3") 
located by the firewall. The hose seems to just fall into the hole. 

I was able to apply vacuum to the thick hose with a tester and the servo
retracted its actuator and held vacuum. So I think its working ok.

My questions are:

1. Does the thick hose get connected to a vacuum source? If so where? I looked
   around with a mirror but could not find an open connector.

2. Can the problem be a defective speed sensor? I know there is a couple of them
   by the flywheel. I think this is not the case, since the car runs fine 
   otherwise. Is there a separate sensor for the cruise?

3. Is there a separate CPU used for the cruise control or is it an integrated
   function inside the DME unit. If its a separate unit, where is it and can it
   be replaced/adjusted? ( I added a factory unit to a Volvo once and there 
   were some adjustments available for sensitivity on its CPU)


Your help will be appreciated!

The Bosch MFI is one of the greatest FI systems ever, when properly
tuned.  However, it's downfall is that tuning is an immensely
difficult project.

      On another subject, I rebuilt the engine on my 1970 911E last year 
   including a complete valve job.  It runs leaner, now , I assume because it's
   breathing better.  Problem is:  I'm getting detonation under hard
   acceleration, depending on weather conditions.  Anyone have experience with
   Mechanical Fuel Injection that can advise me on how to make the mixture
   richer, or should I leave it to the experts?

If you feel comfortable doing it yourself, get the shop manual which
outlines how to do the process.  You can pretty much "feel" when it's
tuned right (as opposed to buying a CO meter and then taping it to the
car and driving it at 3000 RPM under load, etc, etc).

   By the way, is high idle a symptom of lean mixture?  My idle wants to jump up
   to about 1500rpm when the engine gets hot.

This could be a sign of any number of things.  When people relate
their own stories of problems with their cars remember, these are not
professional mechanics, and their range of experience is typically
limited to their own cars, not to several cars a day.  The same symptoms
do not mean the same problem.  The most likely cause of a "hanging"
idle, as you describe, is that the butterflies are not closed all the
way.  Improper mixture can obviously cause this, too.  So can having
the timing or dwell set wrong, and having the hot air intake hose
disconnected. A leak in one of the seals around the intake manifold or
the injectors can cause this, as can improperly adjusted valves.
Lastly, a malfunctioning solenoid might cause it as well.

The best approach to diagnosis is to test each possibility in order of
the ease in which they are tested.  For example, the easiest thing to
test is an external (manifold or injector) leak - spray some carb
cleaner around the areas that can leak and listen for an RPM change.
The next easiest thing to check is the timing (if you have a light),
etc. 

I wouldn't recommend you just start adjusting the FI until the other
possibilities are checked.  Note that improper (lean) mixture can
cause detonation, but more likely detonation is caused by cam or spark
timing problems, or a score of other things.

Detonation is a pretty serious problem, as well.  You can be really
damaging your engine, and this would be sad on a recent rebuild.

Subject: 944 Sport Alignment


Scott,


I have run my 944 successfully with this alignment:

	Front:

	camber:  3/4 degree negative max
	toe   :   30 minutes toe in
	caster:  3.5 degrees

	Rear  :
	
	Camber:  1 degree negative max
	toe   :  30 minutes toe in

For the later cars, more caster, not much though, can be gotten by 
loosening the collar bolts and sliding it in, then readjusting the 
eccentric. The early cars have only the bolts and must be slid around 
to set the caster. I keep the negative camber at a point where the 
designed safety feature still works and doesn't eat the insides of the 
front tires. The rears will wear evenly. I got 35K miles out of AVS
intermediates.

If your car has been hit, the side with the impact usually shows the 
inability to get an adjustment. If you can't get what you want, then set
the caster on both sides equally, the same goes for toe and camber.

The figures given are a street/track compromise and work very well on
all surfaces and most weather conditions. All bets off in mud.
The figures also apply to the 924S, 951,931,968 and 924 varients.

One other thing, when you set the alignment, set the rear ride-height 
eccentrics to set the car level on level ground. Then set the alignement
and you'll find that things REALLY work better. Like get the right 
amount of caster.

Mike Billings suggested that the Special Edition '88 924S, option M756 was
also offered in other countries other than black.  Kevin Gross said his
documentation showed the M756 as a US only option.  From my Porsche Product
Knowledge, Group 17, Number D3, dated 6-7-91, it does list M756 as a US only
option titled 'Special Model 924S, USA 1988.  However, it also lists a M755
option titled 'Special Model 924S, 1988 with the Not For USA blocked checked.
This could be the 'LeMans' version Mike was referring to.

I went with Mike to look at this "special" 924S model the Boise, Idaho dealer
sold new and took in on trade for a Eurovan.  Also of interest was the fact
that the car had roll-up windows instead of the standard electrics which
may suggest interest in weight reduction.  This goes along more with the
performance intent rather than just a visual intent.

The Salesman was as interested as we were to see the M030 printed on the
factory option label in the spare tire well as he too was a non-believer
that 030 was available on a 924S. The car had 7 inch rear wheels and I stuck
my head under the front to verify the adjustable spring perches.

  Yes, it's in the fuse box in my '86 951.  It's labeled in the diagram
as the klaxon (If I remember right), it's obvious once you pop open the

closest to the driver and I think it's the one closest to the mid line
of the car.  Mine is erratic, sometimes just pulling it out and putting
it backing seems to help, no technology to it, just grab and yank.
  If you do get a replacement or just fix it, please let me know.  Thanks.

Another 944 coolant _and_ a/c leak
**********************************
 or How Not to Buy a 944S Porsche.
 *********************************

The car was a 1987 944S with 70k miles.

I had had the car a week when I stopped and noticed a _flood_
of coolant. Drove half a mile home very carefully, looking at
the temp guage (possibly inoperative due to coolant loss?).
Found a burst manifold to radiator hose. Replaced it and filled
the radiator. Outraged at $65 cost for a coolant hose (boy was
I about to get an education in porsche $$). Ran the engine to
bleed the system. Temp redlined. (again possibly partially
inoperative due to an air pocket?).

Called a porsche distributor and they very kindly suggested
that I needed to use the pressurizing tool you used, Steve.
Did so and it seemed fixed. Was NOT happy that the Haynes book
never even mentioned this tool's use or radiator pressurization.
(What 944 shop manuals. $250??)

Coolant consumption became ridiculous. Reminded me of my last car - 
one Buick Skylark, 1980 which had only _two_ heads replaced
in my three years of ownership. On the _third_ head problem
I scrapped it. (Jinxed? No comment).

The we_come_to_your_car pre-purchase inspection guy had
diagnosed the scummy coolant as non-threatening using an
exhaust gas hydrocarbon analyzer (or was it with 'trek phaser,
set to stun?) Don't laugh. Please. He was not a porsche
specialist (V. Big mistake - read on).

Finally took it to reputable specialist (read $huge) in
Campbell, CA. They took off the head, noticed the No. 4 plug 
was loose and not seated properly in the cylinder. When I
described the coolant problem they had asked if I might
also have replaced the plugs. Not guilty - so how did 
the inspector miss this?

They read a service bulletin on 16 valve head cracks .. and 
naturally found one. A factory reconditioned replacement 
head was $1245.  No breaker had one, naturally. The labour 
was $900 (@65/hour) and there was another $600 for gaskets 
and _all_ the other coolant hoses. (Once bitten etc).

****
 Steve your 87 944T is 2 valves per cylinder is it not,
 so this should not be a specific problem with your car,
 except for the ever present possibility of a cracked head
 with any head leak?
****

At the same time they recommended and did new motor mounts,
timing belts and a 30,000 mile service. (The last two
because the car had no service history - part of my first
big mistake - who would have thought $500+ for timing belts?).

They also noted that the clutch master cylinder, front wheel
bearings and an a/c hose needed replacing.

a/c hose
********
This was replaced for $350, including $65 to replace the hose,
reusing the existing fittings, misc parts and 3 hours labour.
They then noted that new shocks, clutch and an O2 sensor 
were needed.

(I think they are giving me the bad news gradually. Now I am 
afraid to go back, hence my last post on a DIY solution for a
broken compressor mount ($1250 new, $350 breaker). 

****
Steve:
 The a/c hose replacement should be similar on
 your 944T. You might have a less expensive shop drain and
 refill the a/c system, while you get the hose fixed. I got
 a separate estimate of $250 from a radiator shop. Then
 again you might want to stick with a specialist given the
 downside risks.
****

LESSONS
*******
So my $65 hose replacement may have cost me $2745, or the 
head might have been bad despite the pre-purchase inspection.
Or maybe I should I have had the car towed to a dealer on
noticing the leak.

Oh and a specialist inspection should be mandatory before
buying. (20:20 hindsight is wonderful).


Hope this will help Steve with his own leaks. My sympathies!
Plus help any other prospective 944 owners to avoid buying
a "hobby" car. (It must be a hobby or else you'd be insane).

Subject: Front Suspension Problems


Since there has been some discussion of front alignment, let me add
my problem:

    My new (1968) 912 steers very nicely, zero play in the steering
wheel and it tracks better in hands-off mode than any of my other
four vehicles.  HOWEVER, at high steering angles, parkinglot manuevers,
etc., it judders and bucks, both going forward or reverse.
    My initial thought was that the Akermann (sp?) has gone away.
    Short of going to an alignment shop (perish the thought), where do
I start in troubleshooting this?  Could it be related to a previous
ride height adjustment--the car does not look lowered, but I don't
yet have a book that tells me what the ride height is supposed to be.
    Any comments appreciated.

                            Thanks

  Yes, my 86 951's fans WILL turn on even with the ignition off.  I

pre-86.  I had the opposite problem at one time, my fans didn't turn
off!  I came back to the car and it was battery-dead.
  I replaced the thermo-switch which is screwed into the back of the
radiator to cure the problem.  If you need advise on replacing the unit
yourself, just let me know.
  FYI: The thermo-switch comes in two varities, 3 prong and 2 prong.  I
believe the 2 prong is pre '86, the 3 prong has two temperature settings
so the fans turn on in stages.

If I had to choose between Bruce's opinion (or that of some other PCA

The factory has occasionally taken some very obstinate positions in
the past. The factory also sometimes has a marketing or product
liability axe to grind.

Agreed. I'm not sure that Bruce or any of the other experts have argued
that synthetics are bad. They have questioned if they have any benefit
over a good quality dinosaur oil, and have warned strongly against
believing the hype from the synthetic oil manufacturers that you can
greatly extend the oil change intervals. I believe that Bruce has
esentially said: use any good quality oil you want, but change it every
3000 miles or so, synthetic or not.

First check the fuse(s).  Dunno about pre-85-1/2, but the later cars have
separate fuses for the two fans.  If they're OK, check the coolant temp.
switch in the radiator.  Pin 3 is ground, pin 2 gets switched to ground
at 92 degrees C (for fan #1), pin 1 gets switched to ground at 102 C (for
fan #2).

OK, looking at the wiring diagram for '84, I see that it's different.
Apparently you have two fans, one for when the AC is running, and one
which switches on when the engine gets warm.  (Someone correct if I'm
wrong.)  Two wires off the switch.  The bigger 2.5 mm brown wire is
ground, and the smaller 1.5 mm brown/white gets switched to ground at
some unspecified temperature.

The fans only come on when the engine coolant gets a little hot, and that
might only occur when the car heat-soaks after parking it.  Then again,
it might not, depending on how hard you drove and how hot it is outside.

Agreed! Bruce's main complaint was that some synthetic
oil manufacturers were claiming that you could leave
the stuff in your car for 7,500 miles. He rightly pointed
out that even if the viscosity holds up, any oil becomes
contaminated with carbon and acids after 3,000 - 3,500
miles.

The main advantage to synthetics seems to be that they
hold their viscosity over a much wider heat range. I'd 
like to see a "scientific" test of the various brands.
I'm interested - but still fixing oil leaks and the stuff
is still a little too pricey to oil the roads with. Some
brands are more than double the price of others around
here. Is it a case of "you get what you pay for" or do
they all perform about the same?

Anyone seen a report, or heard anything about cost vs 
performance?

Please send me an email reply if you have a car for sale. My intent is
that it be my everyday all-year car, but I'll drive it at high-
performance schools and time-trials. I like the handling and braking
of my '86 MR2, but I'd like something quicker in the $5,000 - $15,000
range. My requirements are that it needs little or no repair and that
I don't have to drive too far to see it. Well-executed improvements
over stock are a plus.

Both my '81 931 and '87 924S run one fan with the ignition off.  The fans 
are not wired identically, one runs under a smaller set of conditions
(either only with AC on or with ignition and temp) than the other. The
fan that runs with the ignition off does so at a reduced speed; this is
controlled by the fan relay and a resistor.

I had to do this with both of my cars, but I don't think that's Steve's
problem.  It sounds like either the resistor or relay is at fault.

Steve, I'll dig out my schematics if you'd like the details.  The 
924S should be fairly similar to your car.

Bruce, 

Have a good shop check the ball joints on your 912. They are the very
old type that have an arm on the end and slide into the lower a-arm.
Sometimes the darn things wear but don't show any signs of it until
you back the car up. Have the bolts and end of the arm inspected also.

OK, another ocassion to yell at you all: don't do things like this.
There is an address just for such admin items, "porschephiles-request@tta.com".

You all know about it. You got a note to that effect when you joined.
You get a note to that effect *EVERY MONTH* on the first. You get a
note when basic rules change.

You can *NOT* claim you didn't know. So, *DO IT*.

Bruce is gracious, charming, and will take your call just about any time
and chat for a bit (I know I don't always have time to do that, and wonder
how he manages it). He has an enviable  breadth and depth of experience,
much more so than your average "expert".

He also has very good PR and name recognition. 

But most importantly, he's human. He *has* been wrong -- recently. On
an engine where I was also involved. With something that frankly 
surprised me..

Big caveat on using Bruce as a resource: (a) he (nor anyone else) can not
give an opinion that's worth anything if he has to *SEE* a part or car
and is doing this over the phone, (b) he will generalize, and let you
draw your own conclusions -- you *CAN NOT BLAME HIM* for any conclusions
you draw, (c) if you bother him enough, he will (apparrently) tell you
what makes you happy instead of what you need to hear.

Subject: Galvanized floor pans

    Jim-

    Porsche "started" to galvanize the floor pans on the 911 series in
    1971.  This does not mean, however, that all 911s from 1971 on had
    galvanized floor pans- only certain vin numbers actually had the
    galvanized pans for the 1971 911 (I have the range of numbers if
    you need it- it is in the factory manual).  I believe that once
    the 1972 model year came around ALL the 911s had galvanized pans.

    I am not sure about your question as to engine cases, but I
    believe that the 911 case was aluminum up to (and including) 1968.
    For 1969 through to 1977 it was magnesium (considered lighter,
    but not as strong as aluminum). In 1978 (SC) to the current model
    they went back to the aluminum case.

    Good Luck.

	Re the existing thread on synthetic oils:
	I've use Mobil 1 15-50 in my '87 Carrera for the past 80K miles,
	for the following reasons:

		1) The Porsche "Flugemotor" (sp) (Aircraft engine derived
	  	   from the 3.2 l 911 engine) is certified for flight only
		   with synthetic lubricants. Speaks to some form of increased
		   reliability.

		2) Known high temp stability of synthetics, less ash,
		   better viscosity stability, less degradation due to
		   acids and water etc. This tells me that the product is
		   a superior lubricant. Why would I use a less superior
		   lubrcant in my superior engine?

		3) Cost should not be an issue! With the cost of a rebuild
		   in the $6,000 to $10,000 range why would you worry about
		   an additional $50.00 per oil change every 3000 miles.
		   your increased cost per mile is $.016, less than what you
		   pay per mile for premium performance tires!

	If you have an oil leak problem, fix it! Porsches don't have to leak.
	Sythetic oils will not cause an oil leak. They might expose an existing
	problem by washing some contaminates that are plugging up a pre-existing
	leak, but by themselves they don't make cars leak.

OK, I'm convinced.  Now about that "seat of the pants" procedure:  A
Porsche mechanic where I used to live once said, "If the mixture is either
too rich or too lean, turn the adjustment screw a half turn."  I can't
remember which way is which, but I am guessing that counter-clockwise would
be to make the mixture richer and clockwise would lean it out.
 
More importantly, what are the most obvious symptoms of a too rich and a
too lean mixture?

Ken,

In my Porsche Spec Book (~$10 at Performance products and is recommended indeed)
it is stated that the screw shall be turned clockwise to make the mixture
richer (higher CO level) for 911SC (if I remember it correctly). Always
check in the spec book or similar.

And Jim, You state that the plastic plug covering the adjuster screw has to be 
drilled out...sounds scary to me. Isn't there an easier way?

My '82 has a CO level of 0.9% instead of the recommended 1.5 - 2.0 and it
runs somewhat unsmooth at 2000 to 2500 rpm (legal city speed on 3rd gear).

Subject: RE: 911 front suspension problem

In reference to the 76 911 with the 27.5 inch front suspension height.

It looks like you have one that was never modified from the original US Spec 
setting.  The 25.5 inch setting was the setting for europe, the US had a 
higher measurement for reasons of bumper alignment.  Went with all of those 
wonderful federal bumper laws.

Most of those 911's have since been set to european specs, like my 76 911s.
The change is fairly simple for the front, not so easy for the back (you 
did not say if this was OK or not).  With the car on level ground and the car
loaded as you normally drive it (that means someone of equivlent weight as you
in the drivers seat) you turn the large screws on the torsion bars of the front
suspension.  You adjust a little and measure, then do the other side then 
recheck the whole car again as setting one side affects the others.

The rear require taking out the torsion bars and reindexing the teeth one
or more notches.  And of course resetting the other wheels after you are done.

In answer to Kevin, it will stop when we figure out where these cars

but they do.  Where did they come from?  There are to many of them to
have been whipped up by some ordinary dealer.  Jim Pasha suggest that
maybe Holbert made them.

Again, there is no reason to believe that the fiche are gospel. These

Do you have any idea why the pulley seized?  Until we know why this
happened, it is not at all clear that you would not have had this
problem even if you had changed the belt.  Mark Sundt recently had a
balance shaft bearing go bad (in his 951), in spite of having followed
standard belt change/tensioning recommendations.  This is all by way
of trying to help you not beat yourself up any more while shelling out
all the $$$.

Subject: Setting 944 fuel mixture


I agree with previous respondents who advise leaving this alone,
unless you have some really good reason for thinking it needs
adjusting.  However, there is a shade tree procedure for doing this
using the exhaust gas analyzer that came with your car (i.e., the
oxygen sensor).  The sensor emits voltages between roughly .1V (lean)
and .9V (rich).  The ideal setting is about halfway between the two
extremes.  The procedure is therefore to drill out the cap over the
adjustment screw in the air flow meter, disconnect the oxygen sensor
and attach a voltmeter to it, warm the engine oil to operating
temperature, and adjust the screw until you see about .5V.  You do
have to make sure you don't get the engine too warm, or the sensor
will read near its max no matter what you do with the screw.

I believe this method is suggested in the Probst FI book, and I have
seen an independent Porsche shop use it.  At the Parade in Monterey a
few years ago, I asked a Bosch rep whether this was a reasonable
procedure.  I expected him so give some party line about only using
some Bosch-supplied analyzer, but he surprised me by saying that this
was a pretty good way to get close without investing in a real
analyzer.

Is it OK to switch back and forth from synthetic to petroleum-based oils?  For

street.  A friend of mine has gone up to 20K between changes using Amsoil 
synthetic.  He changes the filter around 10K and adds a quart.  He says that 
the oil is still fairly clear and viscous (subjective).

Subject: Re: 924S

There appears to be confusion regarding the front struts on the 924S.
To begin with, Jim Pasha is correct, there are only two struts for the
924S, these are:

                   PART NO.          DESCRIPTION           NOTE

             944 343 031.11/032.11  SHOCK ABSORBER -KONI-

             944 343 059.00         INSERT         -KONI-*

(from 01/89 Parts Fische)
*part not pictured on Fische

And Jim is also correct, there is no "951" front strut.  However,
misunderstanding and assumptions begin at this point.  The M030 front
strut for the 924S is adjustable and is not a "951" or turbo part.  The
944 343 051 part is the "mystery" adjustable front strut.  At last
check, it lists for $786.25/strut from your local Porsche dealer (does
not include cartridge).  Feel free to order one for confirmation
(however the restocking fee is 10%).

As further confirmation, the "Models Dimensions Tolerances" guide for
the 924S/944 (pn WKD 423 320) reads, p 65:  "Height Adjustment M03/m637
(height-adjustable spring strut):  Bottom screw edge of control arm
bearing at rear under wheel center 146 +/- 10mm".  It clearly refers to
the adjustable front strut.

I don't believe "Wong was wrong", nor is the M756 model I saw here in
Boise, nor is R. L. Mitchell (racing a 924S in Tennessee), nor is my
car!

Seeking the nets wisdom...

A friend of mine with a 911SC is switching over to
synthetic oil and asked me if he should be concerned
about the fossil oil left in his oil cooler. I don't 
have a front cooler, and hadn't ever thought about it.

What happens to the oil in the front cooler when you
drain? Seems like it's downhill from some of the plumbing
and would retain oil even if the thermostat is open.

Does the cooler and associated lines hold enough oil
that you even have to worry about it?

Is there a procedure for getting air out of the lines
or does it self-bleed when the thermostat opens?

It doesn't look that complicated in the factory manuals. Are there any gotchas
that I need to look out for?

I am also interested in getting some information on the factory style stainless
steel heat exchangers being imported from Europe. How well do they fit? They

Let me try to answer some of Lou's questions regarding cruise control problems:

  The thick hose is a vent/intake.  There isn't anything to connect to the

   No, at least not on my car (a 911sc).  In my car the cruise control brain
   gets this speed information from a tap off of back of the speedometer
   which gets its information from a sensor on the transmission.  I don't
   think flywheel sensors would have anything to do with speed control, except
   maybe to prevent over-revs.

   No, at least not on a 911sc.  My car's cruise control brain is located in
   an approximately 4"x6"x1" silver box located in the trunk, behind the large
   fiberboard cover just in front of the dashboard.  It definitely can be
   replaced (I've done it.  It didn't change the problem I was having.  Want
   to buy my spare?  I've also got a couple of spare servos.)  I don't know
   about any adjustments - the factory manuals don't mention any.

   Hope this helps....

   and .9V (rich).  The ideal setting is about halfway between the two
   extremes.  The procedure is therefore to drill out the cap over the
   adjustment screw in the air flow meter, disconnect the oxygen sensor
   and attach a voltmeter to it, warm the engine oil to operating
   temperature, and adjust the screw until you see about .5V.  You do
   have to make sure you don't get the engine too warm, or the sensor
   will read near its max no matter what you do with the screw.

Good idea, just make sure it's a high impedance type volt meter,
like a Fluke DVM.

Does anyone know what the size of the huge nut at the front
of the crankshaft pulleys is for an '80 928?   I'm trying to
buy a socket for it so that I can rotate the engine to TDC

Subject: Re: 944 climate control

The resistor bank is basically a dropping resistor with several tap-in 
points.  As the fan switch is rotated from position 0 towards 4, a 
different tap is switched in, lowering the effective resistance from 
the +12V source to the fan motor.  On position 4, the resistor bank is 
bypassed.

Since resistors with current flowing through them get hot, the bank has 
multiple integral thermal self-resetting circuit breakers.  If these 
get dirty, they'll go open-circuit and knock out a couple fan speeds.

I had a circuit breaker failure in the early days of '86 951 ownership. 
 Repairing it took about 5 minutes once I had it in my hand (also an 
easy task).

If the resistor has good (and fairly low) resistance readings from all 
taps, and the breaker contacts are clean, then it's OK and the problem 
is in the fan switch or associated wiring.

Subject: Not a 914: MG Midget parts car for sale

Just in case any of you are interested (I thought I'd give you guys first
crack):

1973 MG Midget - parts car - for sale.

The car had it's right rear side smashed to death (from straight behind by a
big white Ford truck going about 30-40mph -- never did find the guy) in May of
1987 and has been sitting (outside) ever since.

The bad news:
 - The engine is frozen. I took it all apart to try and get it unstuck a few
   years back. No luck. So most of the engine is in boxes
 - The right rear fender/bumper area is toast
 - The top is still covering but will probably turn to
   dust the minute it's touched
 - Interior is probably not too happy
 - The frame/body was bent in the accident. When I sat down in the driver's
   seat there was new "feature" (bump) under my butt
 - One of the front fenders was not quite the right one (I bought it that way)
 - The passenger side vent window hinge is broken (someone tried to "break"
   in (when the car was still on the road). They also cut the top -- I don't
   even think the car was locked!)
 - 1st gear was noisy. A mechanic told me it was bearings, not gears.

The good news:
 - Still have all of the parts. The car ran great before the accident. I was
   going to start restoring it just about the time...
 - All of the dials and gauges were in good working order
 - The rear trunk lid is not in too bad of shape and should be recoverable
 - I have a brand new (factory reconditioned) transmission
 - Have a new top
 - Have a replacement vent window and frame for the passenger side door
 - Have several engine gaskets and door seals and other new parts (like I said,
   I was getting ready to start restoring)
 - Windscreen is OK (I put in a new one)
 - Have all 5 wheels
 - Doors should be OK
 - Dash is not in too bad of shape
 - I bought and put on a lot of those little body detail-type items before
   the accident (like the "British Leyland" emblem behind the front wheel
   wells, the big "MG" plague on the trunk, etc.). So all of that kind of
   stuff is there, but it's faded.
 - Got a shop manual (it doesn't have a "rear-end collision" chapter though 8-)

I'd like to sell the whole ball of wax to a good home. I paid $600 for just the
transmission back in '86, so I'd guess about $1200 for the whole thing might do
(I gotta support my 914 habbit, don't ya know!). Sigh. I'll get another one and
start over someday. You'll need to come and get it within the next couple to
few weeks. I'm looking for a new job and I may be moving...that's the real
reason I'm getting rid of it.

Now don't take advantage of me or nothin'. If it's really worth $5000 I expect
someone to at least tell me it's worth $1300! 8-)

Feel free to pass this around (other people, other email lists...).

Subject: 944T Chip Upgrades

Steve J.

In answer to your inquiry:

Yes, you must use 92 octane w/autothority chips because the KLR
chip is increasing boost by in effect limiting your knock sensor.
Thus, your protection is lost when running increased boost.  I'm
not sure what the rev limit is set at on any given aftermarket chip,
but I do know that autothority will custom program a chip for you,
including the rev limit (all it takes is $).  There is no 'stock
rev limiter' per se.  The DME computer shuts off the fuel flow
when it senses the designated RPM's on the engine.  So you can
still over-rev the engine by down-shifting at hi speed.

The 'overboost cutoff' is your wastegate.  It is controlled by
the KLR and pressure taken directly from the intercooler/manifold
section.

I haven't dyno'd my engine (yet), so I can neither confirm nor
deny his HP/torque claims.  As for 28 mpg, that sounds OK, since
I get 29 mpg (freeway@65 mph, 605 miles/tankful) with chips.

As for my turbo cup chip, I bought it from a salesman @ a Porsche
dealership (out the backdoor, $600) who was campaigning an '86 951 in
SCCA at the time (~1987).  I traded that chip in to autothority in
exchange for their 2.7 software.  It's old technology, and has been
most likely incorporated into other products by now.

Since my previous posting has been the subject of critical review,
I feel obliged to post a correction, and cite my sources.

FI computer maps modify ignition timing and fuel FLOW.

With Motronic, DME, and any pulse-injection system, fuel flow is
TYPICALLY modulated by controlling the duration of the pulse, not the 
pressure during the pulse.

But in at least one instance that I know of (Andial 2.8 stroker kit
DME map), the software maintains a higher pressure in the fuel rail
before shutting the pump off.  This pressure is a control pressure,
the chip does not run the pump faster or harder.  My source for this
is Mr. Dave Truax, Parts Manager, ANDIAL, Santa Ana, CA.

They don't always scream before failure!  Sudden, catastrophic failure 
is silent, just like the sound of your engine a few seconds later.  
Replace the pullies - it's an easy job, once you've ripped the front of 
the belt system apart.

Not true.  Current chip versions do not affect the knock sensor 
operation, and all protection remains.  In fact, this is a problem for 
myself and a friend - operating in street mode causes boost shutdown 
from time to time, due to the knock sensor.  My friend had his

2.5 Stage II chips.

Yes, the stock rev limiter affects only fuel injectors so you can still 
force an over-rev by downshifting.  But this is true of any car except 
Tiptronic / PDK / CVT jobs.  The stock rev limiter is something around 
6300-6500 RPM: check manuals for the exact number (probably something 
like 6351 RPM...!)

Mr. Truax must not have explained this well, because software cannot 
change fuel rail pressure.  That is a function of fuel pump design, and 
the fuel pressure regulator action, none of which are modulated or 
operated in real-time.  The fuel pump gets simple on/off commands via a 
relay operated by the DME, but this is not used for pressure regulation.

Anyone set up flowmasters?  How about Walker Turbos?

Subject: Porsche parts database candidate.

 Hello,
    A week or so ago someone (Kevin G. and ?) was talking about data basing
their parts ordering so they could streamline the process.
I recall Dbase II and maybe III being mentioned, but nothing more.

If I may add to the list of possibles for use in this capacity, it would
be Q&A by Symantec.  I have used it off and on for a couple years, mostly
keeping track of my compact discs.
I just finished creating a template (which is not a big deal) that would
contain most of the data types in a useful, sensible order..
Naturally there were some limitations (because the programmers did'nt 
think anyone would use TWO decimal points in a number -like Porsche does)
but if you can read a 9 digit number ok and remember the revision is in
another field, this could work for you.

Having never used Dbase, I cant speak for ease of creating the database,
but it is very easy with QA.  Entering data can be a drag too, QA will
import/export data files in DBII or DBIII format and DIF and ASCII.
QA is fairly cheap if memory serves.

The biggest reason I like QA is the 'Intelligent Assistant' which allows
you to query the database using plain english language like: SHOW LAST ORDERED
or SHOW FICHE PART NUMBER 039107361 or SHOW WHERE USED AND QUANTITY ON HAND.

Does anyone out there have any of the microfiche's in data base form?
I MIGHT be willing to poke in my entire 914 microfiche if someone wanted to
reciprocate with 911, 944 ??  This would be a good time, I 'spose.

I put stock used exchangers from a 74 on my 79 SC. This was to get rid of 
the catalytic converter and extra piping- to make it simpler. The air 
injection components were deleted, also. This required two different oil 
lines (standard for the 74 configuration), one from the engine's left to 
right side and the other from the right side to the thermostat in the 
right fender. These oil lines will not need to be changed for a replacement 
1980 system, but the left to right side may have to be removed before the 
exhaust system is removed. The exhaust studs in my heads were rusted and 
five (of twelve) broke when I removed the nuts leaving part in the head. 
Since I don't have shop facilities, I was able to partly attach the 
replacement exhaust and roar to the shop which had a jig to drill the 
bad studs out and put new ones in. Three of the six air injectors also 
broke because of excessive corrosion, but I was able to get them out myself. 
I would suggest not trying to remove them. 
The stainless systems I'm familiar with are the early configuration; you 
should check with the vendor (Stoddard or others) to ensure it is the 
late configuration you want.
Finally, always use new gaskets, period.

Why the split -- the throttle shafts  are  not made of a very good grade of
steel, and over time, you get a rotational varience  between the two throttle
plates. The split shaft lets you adjust this away and really balance all
four throats to be exactly the same.

It appeared on the late 912s, and  they are shunned by the uninitaited 
because they're "hard to adjust". I like them better  than any other
356 carb (except for Webers, natch) because they *are* so adjustable.

Subject: 924/944/968 Front suspension


Hi Guys,

This is an alert to all of us track denizens that push our cars to the
limit. 

I've been out playing in the last year at Laguna with the Ford people 
and have put a few really hard sessions (a 1:50.9 for my troubles) on 
the car. I put the car on the rack to inspect the front suspension 
before an alignment and found that the front crossmember bushings were 
on their last miles.

So I went home and pulled the front arms off and noticed that the rear
bushings were worn down to the metal. Talk about a bad hair day!! I 
decided to buy new arms as well, I have an '83 and those arms are still
stamped steel, the price from Automotion was $40 bucks eack for the 
arms, the complete package with new ball joints was $210.  

A press is required to install the bushings, the arms are directional
once the bushings ate installed with the ball-joints, so note location 
and direction.

The car feels better now on the road, like new, I compared it to a new 
968. The car turns in better and I don't feel the expansion joints on 
the road as much.

A recommendation. If your car has track time or is approaching 100K 
miles, check or have a reputable shop check the a-arm bushings for wear.
If the crossmember end is spalling (split and peeling) or the rear seems
to be delaminating, replace them. The cast front arms have larger 
bushings but will do the same. I'd replace the ball-joints as a matter
of course as the arm's out and it isn't difficult.

The components of the front suspension take a real beating as they were designed for a car that weighs a thousand pounds less and doesn't 
generate cornering forces like the 924/944/968 cars. The steel arms 
twist, you may consider the cast arms if there is no problem with the
sanctioning body (SCCA does not allow upgrades like this for my '83 for example. That's why steel arms went back on).

Again, the bushings wear. If you have high miles on a straight car and 
the front won't align correctly check the bushings.

I replaced the heat exchangers on my 73S last winter - the previous ones
were totally shot and I was sick of breathing CO and smelling like exhaust.

I replaced half of the exhaust studs in the process.  Heh, one of them
had been replaced with a hex bolt.  The trick to not breaking them is to
first soak them liberally in WD40 for a few hours just in case the nut happens
to feel like coming off, and then if the nut does not want to break loose to
work the nut/stud back and forth when you are taking them out.
(Left...right...squeak...squeak...left...right...squeak...squeak...)
Do not apply excess torque or they will break and you will be up the creek.
Plan on replacing several of them - I took the old exchanger off and then went
out and bought the new replacement studs.

When installing the new ones, I used blue loctite to hold them in the head and
used a couple of locked nuts on the end of the stud so I would have something
with which to screw them into the head.  Use anti-seize on the ends of the
studs before you install the exchangers - you will thank yourself if you ever
have to take them off again.  I used all new hardware: copper nuts, those
wierd expensive allen nut things.

Good luck,

I have a 91 Carrera 2. Im replacing the "Carrera 2" emblem on the engine 
lid because it now says "arrera 2". The emblem is held on with adhesive. 
Does anyone know how to remove it without taking the paint with it? Also, 
what should I use to prep the surface before applying the new emblem? I was 
thinking about simply using Tar & Bug remover.

Thanks,
 -Ed-

Subject: Re: 924/944/968 Front suspension

Just a short followup to Jim Pasha's excellent advice about checking for  
front control arm bushing wear in 924/944/968 cars.

The later (85/2 on) aluminum control arms are stiffer and (apparently)  
stronger.  However, they do break, and they tend to actually fracture  
instead of just yield and bend like the steel arms.  This seems to be  
limited to cases where owners who track the car have installed stiff  
anti-roll bars but kept their stock springs.  For example, breakage has  
happened to several people in Firehawk (where stock springs are required,  
but antiroll bars are free), most recently to a 968.  The bending stress  
put on the arm by high antiroll bar forces (the mounting point is in the  
middle) is certainly more than its designed load.

So, if you remove your control arms for any service reason, inspect them  
carefully.  If you track the car regularly, and have stiff anti-roll bars  
installed, you might want to have them Zygloed or Magnafluxed (depending  
on the type of arm).

Also, according to Porsche, the ball joints on the late control arms  
cannot be replaced, you need an entire new arm.

And while I'm at it, if you insist on using Weltmeister anti-roll bars  
(IMO they are junk), and if you must use the "non-competition" drop links,  
which have a rubber bushing on one end, check those bushings regularly.   
They wear out and cause very unpredictable handling....with sometimes  
disastrous results.

Subject: RE: Talk about 914s


R.B.,

No, I didn't ignore the 914s on the front ends. You 914 people should be
looking at the steering rack for end-play and bind. The a-arm bushings 
should be examined for spalling and delamination, these are important as
the torsion rotate around this axis. 

The rear suspension of the 914 is much more important. The rubber in the
actual control arm pivot should be retained for ALL street 914s. Race-
oriented 914s can use plastic because it's usually a situation where 
things get inspected frequently. Plastic usually transmits all 
vibration and shock to the fragile inside ears, eating to mounting hole 
out and making for and early reverse Weisach axle.
Rubber will require new rear arms, these days. Expensive but it returns 
thing to normal and keeps from tearing the body apart. Worn-out arms 
should be ready for some racer, so there is still some value.

On the fronts again, check the upper mount rubber and the bearing area.
If split or worn looking, replace.

I didn't forget you guys, but no one was asking.

I have very mixed feelings about steel control arms, esp. for guys who
are progressing in driving skills and therefore probably pushing a little
harder.  Gary Edwards, late of the list, thinks they're great because
they are cheap, and he always checks over his race cars very carefully.
I don't think most people do, though.  One guy who didn't was an
instructor whose early 944 we pulled out of the woods at Bridgehampton
last fall.  (He just managed, as I recall, to put it between two trees
rather than into either of them.)

As has been pointed out, the ball joints in the newer aluminum arms are
not replaceable, probably because they are peened into the arms.  Someone
has started advertising a replacement service for them in Pano.  Has
anyone checked this out?  Both my arms' ball joints are approaching the
end of their useful life...  The ball joints in the stamped steel arms
are replaceable.  If your only problem is a torn rubber boot, they are
available as Audi parts, if memory serves.

Btw, Nathan, still looking for that Zyglo or Magnaflux reference.  How
hard is it to do it yourself?

Sure.  I use mineral oil in the winter, synth in the track season.  They

Btw, if and when you do adjust the ride height, be sure to get the corner

A few friends have done this sort of operation by heating the emblem
gently with a hair dryer, enough to soften the glue.  I would recommend
cleaning afterwards with a Wax and Silicone remover, such as PPG Acryli-
Cleen, BASF Pre-Kleeno, or Prepsol.  Bug and Tar removers I've seen,
while fine in general, seem to leave an oily residue, which probably washes
right off.

Subject: Limited-Slip Rebuild

I've decided to rebuild a used 951 limited-slip differential before
installing it into my 944S2.  The unit is in good condition, but since
it is a major job to install, I thought I would start as fresh as possible.
The unit is spec'd from the factory as a 40% limited-slip. The factory
workshop manual describes measuring the housing depth, measuring the clutch
pack assembly, subtracting the difference to yield a 4.2mm difference. This
can be adjusted with plates from Porsche that come in 0.1mm increments. Then
after reassembly, measure the breakaway torque. My question is about the
spec range of this torque value. The manual says it should be within a
10 to 35 N-m range.  The used unit measured 22 N-m. Is the middle of the
range equal to 40%? Should I rebuild the clutch pack closer to the upper
end of the torque range? How does the break away torque relate to percent
slip? I'm also curious about other's experiences with 944 limited-slip
rebuilds and results.

Please, no, not again!  :(  How about at least settling for a 914/6

Subject: 951 turbo waterpump



I realized yesterday that the turbo water pump of my 87 951 is not functioning.
No current goes through when the engine is on. Somebody at a earlier posting
indicated that the voltage between the two wires that lead to the waterpump
should have a 12V differential. I have checked the fuse and it is ok. The
other part in question is the relay (part 951-618-149-00). I called the
dealer and they quoted me a $70 price. From the schematic outlined in the 
relay box, it looks like somebody can build a new relay using parts from the
local electronic shop for less than a quarter.

Can somebody verify that the voltage that goes to the pump is 12V? Also do
you have any tips for checking the relay? It looks like that the pump is not
working for quite sometime know. I don't know what the effects will be, but
I would like to bring the pump up as soon as possible.

thanks in advance,

The pump only runs when a thermostat tells it to, or immediately after 
shutdown.  It runs for at least 25 seconds (the relay delay time).  
Under normal conditions, the pump does not run.

An easy quick check of the pumping system electronics is to simulate 
overheated water into the thermostat.  There's a single wire connector 
(round, black plastic) on a water line behind and to the right 
(driver's side, as you're standing at the front bumper) of the air 
filter.  It just pulls off the turbo thermostat, which is screwed into 
a 1/2" (or so) metal pipe.  Touch the connector of this wire to a 
ground through a screwdriver or other item.  The pump will start and 
run for 25 seconds longer than you hold the wire to ground.  This works 
with engine on or off.

The effects are a damaged turbocharger, through time.  Yes, the pump 
takes 12VDC, as does everything on the car.

>Btw, Nathan, still looking for that Zyglo or Magnaflux reference.  How
>hard is it to do it yourself?

Both Zyglo and Magnaflux are proprietary crack locating processes.
Magnaflux, as the name might imply, is a magnetic technique intended
for steel parts, and uses an iron-based powder on the part to be
crack tested, while a magnetic field is applied. Even an invisible
to the eye crack or an internal crack disrupts the magnetic field,
which is visible in the pattern formed by the powder. It is commonly
used for highly stressed engine parts such as cranks and rods, but can
be used on anything which is steel.

Zyglo is a process intended for non-magnetic parts (it will work on steel,
as far as I know, but is slower). It uses a dye-penetrant approach.
The part is cleaned, and then coated with a dye which has very low
surface tension. The dye penetrates any surface cracks. The dye on the
surface is then washed off, and another coating applied which draws
out the dye from the cracks (if any). Zyglo is a variation on the
simple dye-penetrant technique in which a UV sensitive dye is used,
and UV light is used to find traces of the dye.

You can buy generic dye-penetrant crack test sets which you can use
at home. I don't remember for the moment if any of them use UV enhancement
or not (Zyglo may have broad patents, or UV lights may be scarce in
most shops). I'm not sure if you can get "homebrew" magnafluxing
equipment.

Steve, 
  I am also on a search for a 911 and here is what I've learned.
In 84, Porsche added the Carrera automatic oil fed cam chain
tensioners, a shortened throw shifter, and few more horsepower, 
bringing it up to 207HP (mostly due to displacement, I think)
among a few other minor things I'm unaware of (can anyone else
elaborate or correct?)

>

Along with the new clutch came a new transmission, the G50. It is a 
heavier box than the venerable 915, which had been used since the 70's,
but it features new and improved synchros and higher torque capacity.
The engine HP rating was updated to 217HP, but I'm not sure what was
done to achieve that. I know that in 87 the wheel offsets changed
for 944's to allow for bigger brakes, but I'm not sure if that also
applies to the 911 series. Please forward me any email you get
concerning differences, as I'm still on the learning curve as well.
What part of the country do you live in? I couldn't find you on the

I would say that at this point, the 914 owners are at LEAST the equals
of the others on the list, and a measure of political sensitivity prevents
me from claiming that we are in fact superior to the others. And perhaps
a measure of sanity...

In my case, my own standing aside, I have a '70 914 "in need of much attention",

ments that still "look stock", and suggestions on ways to convince my PASSLQ

Subject: RE: emblem replacement

Ed,

I removed my "TURBO" emblem from my 951 in a 2-step process:

1.  Using a length of dental floss, I cut the adhesive material
behind the emblem.  This removed the emblem intact w/o damage
to the paint.

2.  Using Tremco General Purpose Cleaner and Adhesive Remover,
I removed the remaining adhesive resuidue.  This takes time and
patience with a plethora of paper towels and judicious use of
this solvent.

3.  The nice thing is that this is also a suitable prep of the
surface.  Be advised, you will have to polish and re-wax any
surface which this solvent touches, as it takes the wax right
off.  This stuff is also good for removing wax build-up on trim,
lights, etc.

Subject: Non-destructive testing

For those interested, what follows is a short description of the most  
common methods of non-destructive testing (NDT) of metal parts.  This is  
prompted by a question posed by Kevin Gross.

Liquid-penetrant inspection (Zyglo is one trade name) basically involves  
the use of a liquid material which is spread over the part to be tested.   
After sufficient time to allow penetration, the excess liquid is removed  
and a "developer" is applied, which forms a film over the surface and  
slightly pulls out any liquid which has penetrated flaws in the surface  
(to make it easier to see the flaws).  There are many types of penetrants,  
including water-based, oil-based, and flourescent (the most sensitive).   
This method can detect surface flaws or cracks as small as 1 micron in  
width.  Portable kits are available which are packaged in aerosol spray  
cans, making testing of parts in the field quite convenient.  Pegasus  
sells one such visible-light penetrant kit.

Magnetic-particle inspection (Magnaflux is one trade name) involves the  
use of a fine ferromagnetic powder or solution which is spread over the  
part to be inspected.  When a magnetic field is applied, the particles  
will bridge any cracks or discontinuities, thereby indicating their  
presence.  It (obviously) only works on ferromagnetic materials.

Eddy-current and magnetoinductive testing is a sophisticated and versatile  
method for detecting flaws and features in the part.  It basically relies  
on measurement of electromagnetic induction in a part.  Although it can be  
used on a variety of materials, ferromagnetic and not (depending on their  
magnetic permeability), it requires relatively sophisticated equipment,  
and the part must be sent out.

Radiographic inspection works just like medical X-rays, though the X-rays  
are sometimes used to expose a radiosensitive paper instead of film, or  
even to produce an image on a display screen.  It's an excellent way to  
measure casting voids and weld pores or inclusions, but not very good for  
measuring surface cracks.

Ultrasonic inspection is also a very effective technique for measuring  
flaws deep below the surface of a part, sometimes many feet deep.  It has  
a number of advantages for use in the metal processing industry and for  
measuring very large structures, as well as for automated testing of  
forgings and casting.  It requires the use of expensive equipment and  
well-trained operators.

I believe Carroll Smith talks about NDT in one of his books, and, for  
racers, recommends X-ray inspection of new castings and forgings, followed  
by magnetic-particle or dye-penetrant inspection of critical parts at  
regular intervals.

    Here we go again!  One of the biggest advantages the 914 has is that it's
light,
light, light!  If you put a V6 or V8 water-cooled engine in, you change that. 
It can
also be a rather expensive proposition.  (Stan?)  Not to mention ripping the
holes
in the poor little beastie for the cooling system.
    If you want lots of power, go the 911 engine route.  A 2.4L "E" or "S"
would do
rather nicely, and still be very light.  For more power, more weight, and (it
seems)
*much* more reliability, go the 3.0L + route.
    To do a conversion (of any type), start with a '73 or '74 chassis.  It has
a bet-
ter transmission linkage design, better amenities (the windows usually go up
and
down when you want them to!), and several other improvements (e.g., hand brake)
over the earlier cars.  '75-'76 would be OK, especially if you decide you don't
care
all that much about the weight.  The main difference (besides emissions
equipment)
is the 5MPH bumpers, which are better in the parking lot, but add weight, and
add
it out at the ends, where you don't exactly want it.  If you can find one that
has the
"sport" group, so much the better.  It will have swaybars on it already, with
the
associated mounting points.
    911 front suspension/brakes are just about a must, if you up the power. 
That
means 5-bolts, so you'll need to do the rears as well.  That's OK, since you
can
get wider wheels that way.  (Someone on the list has 6", anyone have more under
a stock fender?)  What with getting the rears drilled for 5-bolt (buy the '70
wheels
for the reinforced drilling points!!!), getting the 911 rear calipers (possibly
'S'
calipers) buying an adaptor so you can still use the hand-brake, the cost is
already
up there.  Want more?  There's more.
    Or, if you are not interested in being smog-legal (or live in a somewhat
lax area),
you can take a 2.0L four-banger and tweak the heck out of it.  I thought I
heard Stan
mention 150 HP, although I have no idea of what engine life would be like.  Not
a bad
little go-cart, and still as light as the original.

Donald & Trond,
     Thanks for responding to my question about the 928 vibration
damper/crankshaft bolt.  I ended up going to Sears and kept trying
different sockets in the lot until I found one that fit.  It turned
out to be a 27mm bolt (I too would've guessed 36mm from the stock
number).
     This is all part of an attempt to change the timing belt and
camshaft seals (I hope my oil leak is from the camshafts and not
the crankshaft!).  I have the factory manual on microfilm and
copies of the Chilton's, Motor, and Mitchell's manuals. 
Unfortunately, they didn't tell me I needed to get the vibration
damper off to change the belt (there was something very vague
translated from German), so I have to wait until next weekend to
finish the job.  Incidentally, I'm going to skip using the 9201
tensionning tool ($400!!), and I'm going to go with Chilton's
recommendation of a 90 degree twist in the belt for the early
928's.  I'm keeping an detailed outline of the procedure which I'll
post once I'm done.
     Let me know if you have any suggestions!

Subject:  911 differences

     In addition to the differences mentioned by Tony, the 85
would have the DME (electronic) fuel injection and engine
management, while the '83 has the CIS injection.  Also, in the
'85 the front oil cooler is a radiator type, which is more
effective than the double loop configuration in the '83.  The
differences are mostly incremental improvements.  Both cars are
very similar in performance and reliability.  It costs about
$1000 in parts to upgrade the tensioners and oil cooler from an
'83 (SC) to the '85 (Carrera) level.

My '83 has worn synchros (1st/2nd).  This is a common problem.
Most folks just live with it until something else necessitates
disassembly.  The G50 ('87 and up) doesn't have the problem, but
then the car is much more expensive.

To all those people who want to put anything but a type IV or Porsche

about how to sit next to a harmonic balancer spinning 6 grand.

I won't have to tell you that the transaxle will take a s*** when you 
stomp it and the suspension will drop an inch and a half. 

I won't have to tell you that you'll freeze you butt off because the 
heater doens't have a little radiator. Then again, if you do it like 
all the others, you'll fry in the summer because of the radiator hoses.

Then again, just suggesting that you want to do that tells me you have 
no appreciation for the car in that first place. Don't buy one and save 
us a lot of unnecessary message traffic.

In reality, the chassis is at a limit with a regular 2.7. All the 914/6
GT parts help, but those cars were built for a limited life and purpose
so the longevity may still be limited. Most of the Non-Porsche swaps
tore the daylights out of the car in a couple of years.

Then again, now that I remember it, the prototype 924 motors w/Audi
trans were tested in 914 chassis. The factory crushed those B******s
to hide the evidence.

Well, if you wanted bars for a 924/944/968, I'd be glad to sell you a set  
of ours.  Unfortunately, we don't race 911s, so I haven't designed  
anti-roll bars for your car.

I believe Andial sells a nice anti-roll bar for 911s, and the ones from AJ  
Racing seem to be well-designed, but I haven't used either of them.  Any  
personal experience from 911 track people out there?

The Weltmeister bars with their "competition" drop links are probably  
adequate, as long as they are of the one-piece bent bar design.  I've seen  
some with tubular arms clamped onto the square end of the lateral bar.   
This is a crime against nature.

In general, there are two ways of building a good anti-roll bar.  You  
either use a straight section of tubular or solid steel with splined ends  
(similar to a torsion bar), then have arms with matching splines, or you  
use a single piece of round stock and bend it to form a shallow U-shape.   
In either case, the bar should be of high-quality steel and heat-treated  
after forming.

Any other method I've seen, which includes the Weltmeister square-end bars  
and another design I saw recently which used a hex end, is an invitation  
to disaster.  Aside from the creation of a monstrous failure point as the  
bar necks down to the square or hex end, the joint has very high stress  
concentrated in a small area.  The result is local yielding, which leads  
to play in the joint, which can lead to you in the tire wall.

Subject: Belt tensioning

Hi Guys,

Let me make a recommendation to the PCA region members out there, have 
your region BUY a belt tension gauge and rent it to the members.

I DO NOT recommend the Chilton method for belt tensioning on a 944/928/
968. If you screw up it's REAL expensive. The gauge is a real accurate
method to assure yourself the tension is done correctly. The gauge 
should also be used for the counterbalance shaft belt and the serpentine
accessory belts. If you use the gauge, have a mechanic or someone that
knows how to use it show you how to make accurate measurments

924s may use the 90 degree twist method, then the compression and valve
timing make a mistake less costly.

I also recommend re-checking at 1000 to 1500 miles after a new belt is 
installed. If you do a lot of stop and go or driving in heavy traffic,
re-check at the 15,000 mile point, the belt will have stretched and 
need adjustment and inspection.

If you do track events, inspect and adjust prior to each event, re-
inspect afterwards, adjust if necessary or replace.

Just the tinkerer giving some learned advice.

Sounds like classic worn CV joints to me.  Sometimes repacking them will make
the noise go away, sometimes not.  The problem is determining which of the 4
joints is bad (maybe more than 1).  Try grabbing the driveshaft near each CV
joint and trying to move is perpendicular to its length - it should not move.
If it does, you've isolated the bad joint.

PS '72 911 CV joints go for about $100 apiece.  I went through a couple of
catastrophic CV joint failures until it was determined that I had a bent
driveshaft.   It was so bent you could look down its length and see the bend.

Subject: 911 coupe vs. 911 cab

This ought to make for some interesting discussion, although it's
not about 914's. In my continuing search for a 911, which I plan
to use for autox, track, and some (minimal) daily driving, I had
been considering only the coupe version of a 911. This weekend I
heard another theory which presented a conflict with my current
set of assumptions. I had always assumed that the coupe was the
preferred body style for autox, because of its structural rigidity
and that the cabriolet body had too much body flex to make a good
autox/track car. 
  Because the cab body had to be strengthened (read more weight) 
in the lower chassis to reduce body flex, the weight was added 
below the center of gravity of the car and below the hub axis 
of the wheels. The alternate theory suggested that the benfit of
this lower center of gravity out-weighed the disadvantage of body
flex and additional weight, assuming that Porsche had once again 
done its homework, and reduced the body flex to a point where the 
effects were negligible.

My questions are: 

Do you agree or disagree with this theory? why?

Does anyone have exact weights for 84-87 911 coupes, targas, and 
cabriolets? The technical spec book I have only lists one curb 
weight for all 911 Carreras in this model year range.

Does Porsche publish center of gravity information (maybe they
call it roll center or something) for these cars?

Thanks in advance for you answers,

Subject: Square-ended Sway Bars


To Nathan and others.

Having used Weltmeister Bars for sometime, I can offer this:

All through-body Porsche Factory Sway-bars have square ends. (1965-1974)
Later bars are formed pieces.

I have never seen a broken-off end on a square-ended bar. Factory or 
aftermarket. I have seen broken U-tabs on the a-arm, stripped adjustable
arms, frozen spherical ends, broken swaybar mounts (torn from body). 

Unless the car is stuffed into something at a good clip, it is almost 
impossible to bend the bar along it's axis. 

IT IS possible to have the bar take a set based on useage and have a
slightly different plane one side to the other, that's why we started
building adjustable links. The adjustment relieves the preset. 

Most installations on 944s that I have seen have a lot of pre-load, 
this indicats that the a-arm is always under load. This will be the one that cracks.

BTW, the stock car type sway-bay systems are better than the Weltmeister
for the 924/944/968 as the arms can be set in the correct plane to the 
a-arm. The Weltmeister had an arm radius that is a little short to 
cover the bend AND the arm lever length. All of the Holbert and Allan
Johnson DP 924s used a hollow 31mm bar with the stock-car setup. a 19mm
for the rear. This will be a setup that is best used for track cars, it
did require welding up the front arms.

So guys, the factory thought square ends were fine, so why the flames?
The real problem was the non-indexed aftermarket adjustable arms.

Tony,

Count on a 250 pound penalty between the chassis stiffening and the rear
glass window. This is observed reather than printed. 

Flex for the targa is greater, though not as much of a disadvantage as
one would believe unless you really push the car. Then you'll see 
some misalignment of the doors and other problems.

If you use a targa, find a 1975 or so fiberglass solid Targa top and 
bolt it in place if you do track events. A product worth making by
an enterprising person, BTW.

I have one. It just gives you more throttle opening per inch of

I generally believe the engineers at Porsche know what they're doing, but  
that doesn't mean I trust them blindly.  I have a PhD in mechanical  
engineering, and spend my days designing mechanical systems for use in the  
deep ocean and performing related research.  As a result I may be a little  
picky about design details.

In this case, obviously the engineers at Porsche thought the loading on  
the anti-roll bar ends in those early 911s was low enough that they could  
use (the convenient) square ends.  But if I remember correctly, those  
early anti-roll bars were pretty skinny, and the early cars didn't way  
much over 2000 lbs.

As tires become stickier, cars become heavier, tracks become smoother  
(sometimes) and drivers become more interested in improving the handling  
on their cars, anti-roll bars have gotten bigger and bigger.  The loads on  
the bars have also increased dramatically.  I worry when I see square ends  
on fat anti-roll bars.  


No, I haven't seen one break off yet (and hope I never do), but what I  
have seen is the corners of the square end wearing the corners of the  
square hole, and the resulting play in the sway bar.  This is bad, because  
it can make your handling very unpredictable.  A couple of weeks ago I  
watched a friend of mine, who happens to be an excellent race car driver,  
stuff a 914 into the tire wall at NHIS because of what turned out to be a  
similar problem.  Luckily he wasn't hurt, nor was the car badly damaged,  
but if he had lost it on the oval turn instead, things might have been  
different.  Which just confirms my distrust.

Rather than using the factory's use of square ends in early 911s as a  
justification for their use under different circumstances, you might ask  
why they stopped using them.

I disagree, for two reasons.  Having a lower CG is better than having
a higher one, sure.  But you're really talking about finding a less
odious home for excess weight.  Weight is the enemy; simply locating
it lower in the car doesn't make it a blessing.  Extrapolate: how about
tacking on an extra 200 pounds on the bottom of the car.  Even lower CG,
sure.  Feh.

The other reason is that, CG or no, you have less torsional rigidity.
Which sucks.

My 2 cents worth.

I saw one, broken on a friend's Carrera.  He is a rather aggressive
driver, really pushes his car and does a good job of it.  It was broken
right at the base of the square, as memory serves.  I do not remember
seeing (or not seeing) any signs of fatigue in the break, ie, a smooth
part to it.  However, I would have to attribute the failure to fatigue,
since this guy didn't (and doesn't as a rule) have "offs."  Oh yeah, the
bar was an Automotion.

One really ought to set them up with zero preload.  I always load up my

If you decide to install one of these things, make sure that at wide-open
throttle (foot to the floor) you are up against the pedal stop on the
floor and not stressing the throttle cable.

I don't know anyone who has ever put a different throttle cam in their
car, which says something to me.  Kind of reminds me of the scene in

John,

Have you done any research on this project yet? I was thinking about
doing the same thing with a spare type IV I have into my baja bug.
But, I don't know if the bolt pattern is the same; or how the type IV
flywheel/clutch set-up would fit. I also wondered about the starter
mounting as well. Upon, reaching this point I decided to leave it alone
for a while. If this is really possible, I'd appreciate any info you
could provide.

BTW, I also briefly considered the V8 into my 914. But after seeing
where the motor mount bar bolts to the body, I concluded that my 325hp
torque monster would rip the little Porsche to bits unless I spent
thousands to reinforce the body and upgrade suspension and brakes. So
I decided to build a 2.0l for it instead.

> i have a question myself..Did they use a torsion bar front suspension
> in the 914?

Yes, 914s do use a torsion bar front like the 911. You can upgrade a
914 front suspension by bolting in a front from a 911. Getting the rear
upgraded is a lot more involved however.

Brendin

What kind of hp/torque can I expect to get if I put a 2.0 in the 914?
how about if I turbocharged it?

I have one on my 88 944. It only saves you from stomping on the pedal all
the way to open up the throttle; the throttle opens up with less pedal
travel. It's a cinch to install too. I don't have either a positive or
negative recommendation, but I like it because my previous car had short
pedal travel, so the alternate cam feels more natural to me. It's just
a matter of preference as far as "feel" but it doesn't make your car
any faster.

Well, I have decided on a different Porsche 911 to buy, so here is
one I looked at last week which I think is a pretty ok deal.

I have looked at the original window sticker and service records
which is reflected in the description

84 911 Carrera Coupe (no sunroof), platinum metallic($1k option),
Full leather interior, matches the outside, leather sport seats,
nice blaupunkt cassette.  The car has 113,000 miles, only 3K in
present owners hands.  The orig. owner was pretty fanatical about
maintenance...had the engine overhauled and clutch replaced by
Perfect Power(local RUF dealer)  at 68Kmiles for $9,850..., instead
of getting a rebuilt alternator (90 Kmiles), put a
new factory unit($770) in, replaced calipers and rotors and about 90K
miles($2,300).  Wheel bearings were done.

body has a two small dings on a door and a ding on the engine
cover....otherwise real nice.  Interior is perfect, no
signs of wear. car has no oil leaks.

trans does need  synchros..probably 1,2 and 3..

I get the impression the current owner needs to sell.  He is asking
$16,900, but I am pretty sure one could get it for $15K.  I
explained that it would take close to 2K to do the trans and clutch,
he seemed negotiable.

I do not know the owner personally.

The car is in Grayslake, IL (708) 546-1016. ask for Ed...I forget
the last name.

All carreras starting in 84 do away with hoop cooler in fender for

although orig stated hp was 207...i believe that was later raised to
222...just because the factory found the later figure more accurate.

The brake rotors on carreras are larger than SCs...and the calipers
are different (at least in the front)

fog lights are inset into the valence on carreras, stick out on SCs.

lot more room in the engine compartment due to motronic vs CIS FI

I'm not going to argue that the throttle response cam makes a significant  
difference, and it certainly doesn't give you more power or anything like  
that.  On the other hand, if you spend most of your time at wide throttle  
openings, the cam gives you finer control over the throttle.

Let's say your foot moves approximately 4" from no throttle to full  
throttle.  In approximate terms, the stock Porsche part uses the first 3"  
or so for the first 45 degrees of the throttle plate opening, and the last  
1" or so for the last 45 degrees.  This is fine for a street car, and  
because of the throttle design, probably maps very nicely into the actual  
air flow.

However, on the race track, you spend most of your time modulating the  
throttle at or near wide open, especially with a relatively underpowered  
car like the 944.  And, with the throttle response cam, you have finer  
control at those wide openings.

Do I notice the difference in my car control?  Definitely.  Does it make  
any difference in lap times?  Probably very little.  Would I put one on my  
street car?  No.

     My Italian mechanic, Aldo, is factory trained but likes his "caffe con

     Aldo to replace the brake pads, but I'm not sure he did. He did putter 
     about and return the car with the squeal moved to the rear wheels.
     
     I started to check the pads myself but found the pads held in place 
     with a four-leaf-clover-shaped wire affair which I couldn't see how to 
     get off.

Kevin mentions (mostly correctly) that all weight is bad.

However, in this case, it appears (assuming that I have not been 
misinformed about the skid pad info, i.e. did same driver do tests,
same tires, etc) that the reduced roll torque from the lowered c.g.,
with respect to suspension center, reduced the inside-to-outside
weight transfer, thus improving handling.

The only skid pad info I have is anecdotal; anyone have real numbers?

I know of at least one car (mid 60's spitfire) whose handling was 
**much** improved by 100#'s of sand in the trunk.  Of course this 
was a brittish car... (no flames please, it also had a bad fuel

Tom Husschilt asks what transmission I'm using for this project.  I'm using
the stock 81 VW 4-speed, with some confidence since I don't tow, plow, or drag
with the van.

Martin Schneider at MSDS has a kit aimed at the wealthier Vanagon owner, which
assumes a later DME-equipped engine which (just) fits under the Vanagon's
engine lid, which my 2.2T Zeniths and fan-shroud do not.  Anyway, his kit can
use either the stock 4-speed or the G-50.  5 speeds would be nice, but if I
had more money I would probably still put it into engine, at least until my
4-speed has more mileage (less than 75k now).

If anyone is interested in that swap I have a Buick 215 engine completely

I too have a spare type 4 engine, but this is NOT the best way to get
more power into your Bug. The upright fan housing and doghouse cooler
on the standard Bug engine is much better adapted to being in a Bug
to begin with, and the reasonable-cost availability of high-output
parts for the stock engine allows one to bolt together a good reliable
engine with quite a lot of power, without having to go through the
expense of adapting the pancake motor to the Bug.

Hi there folk,

I don't run track with my '79 928, I drive it daily and with fuel prices
going up I do worry about economy.  I enjoy driving this car.  Sometimes I
feel that the car needs a 6th gear.  Does anyone know the gear ratio for
my car and is there a way to raise the gearing to increase the mileage?  I
believe that the engine is strong enough to perform well with the higher
gears.  Or should I just change the raise the fourth and lower the fifth
and or the pinion gears?  Any thoughts on this will be appreciated.

I installed the Autothority cam on an '84 that I used to own.  This is
probably a matter of taste, but I do prefer the throttle response
offered by this replacement cam.  The stock cam requires (what seems
to me) an excessive amount of pedal travel to open the throttle
initially.  After driving other cars, I frequently bogged the engine
trying to get my 944 moving from a dead stop until I installed one of
these cams.

Subject: RE: Sway bars

Hi Guys,

Didn't mean to stir up the pot on the subject of swaybars.

I've looked into the subject rather thoroughly over the years. The 
square-ended Porsche front, through-body sway bars are fine, even the 
large diameter ones work well. You will note that I directed a comment
or two about the ARMS attached to the bar.

It doesn't take a PHd to figure out that the inherent weakness in the 
design is the method ( or lack of) of indexing the clamping ends to the
bar. A larger number or deeper splines don't make much difference. 

My own bitch is that H&H, Automotion and others use a simplistic design 
which is easy to produce. These designs are fine for the street, BUT 
require attention to assure integrity.

BTW, the factory stopped using the square ends when the '74 model 
came out, excepting the Euor-RS, RSR and the Turbo models. All models,
excepting race models used the single bar mounted to the back of the 
rack/torsion bar mount. 
The reason? It was cheaper. It didn't require holes in the body and the 
bar wouldn't tweek the body if a wheel was hit in an accident.

I have designed race cars for a hobby for a considerable period of time,
if I have a choice, I use the stock car stuff. Sway bars included. Not
a job to be done in an ordinary garage.

I think it's not so much about your absolute position of throttle but
the rate of change, with respect to time... i.e. when you "squirt" the
throttle from position a to position b it takes less time to do it than
with the old one.... so basically what happens is that the engine
managment "thinks" you want lots of g's and aprortiately dumps more
fuel in!

i.e. the effect is very similar to re-calibrating your accelarator pumps
on carbs.

I guess the downside is you get a more "hair line trigger" throttle making
it more difficult to drive around town. (I've heard that said about them).

Depends what you want.

The gear ratios should be in your owner's manual.

The cheapest way to raise your rear-end ratio (no, I don't mean how to 
fatten your butt!) is to put larger circumference tires on the back.  
It's less permanent than changing the xmission and involves fewer 
headaches.  Depends on how commited you are to this change, I suppose.

650 Sunroof
220 Ltd Slip Diff (LSD) (my guess is you don't have it)

There are a couple of other ways to determine if you car has
an LSD. Raise the rear of the car to get both rear wheels off
of the ground (floor jack on the transaxle, or jack stands at
lift points on each side). Spin one tire and watch the other.
If they both spin in the same direction, it's LSD. If not, it's
an open differential.

The other way is to call PCNA Owner Relations in Reno, NV.
The number is (800) 545-8039. Ask them to help you with decoding
the options on your car. They will ask you to FAX proof of ownership,
and after receipt, they will tell you what each of the option codes

The following cars are for sale.  The first one is mine and the second is 
offered by a local 911 fan.

MY CAR:

My car is a black 1978 930 with black leather.  It is a US model but it has 
Eurolights (H4s) and the emissions control gear is long gone (which should 
bring it up to about 300 bhp as I understand it).  The engine was 
professionally rebuilt (with pressure fed tensioners and updated lower valve 
covers) in 1991 and since I've been on the road a lot since then, it has 
only about 5k miles on it.  A new K27 turbo was installed in 1990, preceding 
the engine work by only about a thousand miles.  The tires (Comp T/As) are 
also relatively fresh, with only seven or eight thousand miles on them.  The 
brakes were done this year as well (new pads, turned rotors).  It also has a 
power sunroof, power windows, rotary A/C (needs charging).  The stereo is a 
Blaupunkt Koln, but it's old and the tape deck doesn't work (I'm generally 
content to listen to the engine - music enough for me!).  The paint's in 
decent shape but it's nothing to write home about (even though everyone 
seems to be quite surprised when they find out how old it is).  I have all 
the records for the car since I bought it (1988) but they're pretty sketchy 
prior to that.  I don't really know how many miles are on the car as I found 
out (too late!) that the odometer had been tampered with.  For those of you 
who are interested in such things, it was owned for most of it's life by Ron 
Rice of Hawaiian Tropic fame (why do people with that kind of money insist 
on doing things like turning back odometers?).  At any rate, I'm getting 
married next year and moving to Utah, either of which would be reason enough 
to sell.  I've been asking $27,000 as of late (though in a moment of 
despair, I put an ad in Hemmings for $26,500) and would like to think that 
the price is pretty firm.  Everything's negotiable in life though.  And, 
just to keep things interesting, I'll post a $100 bounty for anyone who 
hooks me up with the person that ends up buying the car.

HIS CAR:

1977 911S, silver w/ black leather, sunroof, H4s, A/C, 2.7l w/ hydraulic 
tensioners and divlar studs, Blaupunkt AM/FM/Cassette w/ Infinity speakers. 
 Tires, wheel bearings, rotors, pads, transmission, alternator, and battery 
are all reasonably fresh.  It has 46,900 original miles on it and he has all 
documentation.  He is looking for $10-11k for the car and refers to it as a 
"forced sale" (actually, I think he just wants to keep his teenage daughter 
out of it).  His name is Jeff Quinn and he can be reached at (315)737-9307. 
 Be sure to mention my name.

Read the archives! Just the '93 stuff alone will give you a *WEALTH* of
info on 914 engines.... I'm getting busy enough that I don't have
time to re-post all the stuff I've written over the last N years....

A full-race SCCA EP legal 1.8 will make 185 HP for about 10 hours.

A modified to the limits of reason semi-legal for "stock" (i.e. you can't
tell by looking it's not stock, including the EFI) 2.0 engine will
make about 120 HP for about 100k miles.

Turbos are the great killers of young air-cooled engines. You can't
just bolt one on, you have to engineer it into the rest of the car,
including better cooling, better oiling, different exhaust, and if you're
even half-way sane, suspension and brake improvements too.

The coupe is the clear choice for *road racing*, for just the reasons
you mention (and a lower Cd). It's not so clear that it matters for autox,
at least when measuring on a short-term basis. On a long-term, lots of
events per season, constant pounding basis, it might be the case that
the coupe lasts longer before needing body alignment attention. And
since you can have a tub re-bent *CORRECTLY* at least two places in 
town, it doesn't matter.

This is true. And the Targa got almost *exactly* the same stiffening,
but had the "hoop" added, and the heavier rear glass as well. Now, for
street driving, and for autox, the difference is low. For road racing, 
there are some interesting harmonics in the body that have to be overcome
with different cage construction than you'd use for a coupe, and
you *STILL* lose on the Cd issue.

>Do you agree or disagree with this theory? why?

To a point. The facts are valid, it's just a question of to what degree
it *MATTERS*. The "weight is evil" crowd is partially correct -- weight
*IS* evil, but it's only **REALLY** evil if you're running in highly
prepared racing classes where all other things are essentially equal --
*ESPECIALLY* drivers. The "low CG is good" crowd is also partially right --
*IF* you have enough power to pull the extra weight (you do, in a 911), and 
*IF* the weight is also doing something else meaningful (like stiffen the tub).
(As an aside, check out the "ambulance stabilizers" from the 60's 
sometime -- 1" ID tubes a couple of feet long full of MERCURY! They 
bolted/welded up to the bottom of ambulances to make them less top 
heavy and to pre-load the suspensions).

I *DO* know that Cabs are a big win over Targas (until you get to the late
model electric tops which add a lot more weight) as the Cab weighs less 
and doesn't give up any stiffness.  The "ultimate" would probably be a Targa
that had been converted into a "Sypder" including fiberglass fenders.

And, Scott Jessen and I both drive Targas and last time I checked, weren't 
exactly considered crazy...

My own opinion is that for autox and driving school type track days, that
a Targa or a Cab would be just as good as a Coupe. Until you get to a
level of preparedness that approaches the absurd, it just doesn't make
that much difference. Oh sure, Hans Stuck might be able to get an extra
0.003 out of a coupe that he might not in a targa, but hey, that's not
a problem most of us have... (Although I'd have been a *LOT* happier if
I'd found that extra 0.006 in August... 8{( )

For that final little tid-bit: I've been pounding my car *HARD* for the
last three years. It has 225k KM on the clock, and I started getting a
little nervous. Took it in to Transformers, had them put it on the Hunter
alignement system for a quick body check -- it's within 1/8" of perfect
on only one measurement, and the rest are perfect. And they found the seam 
which was *mis-welded in a collision repair* that was adding the extra stress 
to pull the body out of alignment. When I asked about the issue of body
stress from autox and track days, I was told that it wasn't going to be a
problem unless I started hitting things...

I'd suggest trying an owner's manual. It *might* have the info,
but then, I'd expect the spec book to have it, and I can't find it
in there either.

Nope. And you don't even really have enough info to calculate it.

I'll throw in my two cents worth just for the hell of it. This comes from a 
conversation I had with Susan Hagaman who used to clean up in ASP Ladies 
with her 911 Targa (I beleive she's got 6 or 7 national chapionships in that 
car),  no flames to me, I just asked her about it one day and what she said 
was:

"It turns out the Targa's are actually faster autocrossers than the coupes." 
The reason she gave was "Because they actually flex and keep the tyres down 
on the ground better, you don't get Targa's picking up that front tyre and 
losing steering control as badly as a coupe"

Now, I'm hazy on the rest of the conversation (this was sometime near the 
beginning of last year) but I do remember that part disctinctly.

Uh, that's ASL, not ASPL.  Linda Mitchell is the fearsome ASPL (and LSP1)
Porsche driver.  Which is not to discount Susan's knowledge, but rather
to put it in its correct perspective.  She should know plenty about
Stock 911's.

Interesting concept.  I'll have to agree that most 911's I've seen do lift
the inside front, some rather dramatically.  Even Dwight Mitchell's, and
he does Porsches for a living.  Can't say as I watched Susan's green car
much, but her (Ken's) orange car did some front-lifting.

Amazingly enough, at the Great Canadian Bug Show a few weeks back, I was

I fixed this, finally, by putting in a spring from a good-condition Beetle
seatbelt.  The basic mechanisms are identical (mounting and latches aren't),
and the spring works great.  You just have to be verrrry careful when
taking the springs out... :)

Apparently there is no adjustment, and the looseness is caused by the
deterioration of the rubber seals in the roof -- which are insanely 
expensive, of course.  But all hope is not lost...

Last week I was at work, when it started raining pretty hard.  My driver's
side window is still misadjusted and there is a gap near the top, causing
leakage in the rain.  So I ran to the hardware store next door, and bought
some 1/2" x 1/4" (I think) black foam tape, which did a nice job of sealing
the gap.

But yesterday I saw the tape again on the garage floor :) -- and put it to
some more good use.  Applied it to the two rubber strips on the roof which
rest on the roll bar edges, giving some extra thickness.  Presto!  *Much*
less squeaking and roof rattling, and you'll never notice the foam tape on
the roof.  Cost: new rubber: $250, waterproof foam tape: $2.50.  It was an
easy choice!  :)

Ferdinand Piech (at the time the engineering director at Porsche, now
managing director of Volkswagen) had two built, one as a 70th (?)
birthday present to Ferry Porsche, and one for his own use.  There
were lots of small variations, but the big difference was that while
Ferry's car had a detuned 908 engine, Piech's car was in full race tune.

Both cars are currently owned by Porsche, and the Porsche Museum usually
has at least one on display.

Pete asks,

     o  Is brake squeal routinely indicative of worn pads? Should I replace 
     them again (if he did, in fact, replace them before)?
     o  How do I get the four-leaf-clover-shaped wire gizzie off? Do I need 
     a special tool (other than a six-pack)?
     o  Anyone know a good source for 928 tech manuals on microfiche?
 
No, brake squeak has become a generic problem with pads since asbestos
has been fazed out.  Porsche makes vibration dampers which cure the
problem.  They are basically pads of rubbery material which get shimmed
between the pad and the calliper piston, usually fixed with adhesive to
one or the other or by a spring to the calliper piston.

In your case, tech bulletin book F, group 4, number 8902 calls out the
part numbers.  For a MY86 928S, you need dampers on the fronts only,
p/n 928.351.096.19 and 928.351.096.18.  You need four of each.  Word of
caution: a Euro car may have different callipers taking different parts.
These p/n's are for a US car.

Rather than telling you how to take the gizzie off, I would recommend
someone show you how it's done.  It's not hard to do, but the price of
screwing up your brakes can be pretty high.

According to Karl Ludvigsen (Excellence Was Expected), some 20 916s
were built. Peter Gregg had one and so did Ferdinand Piech. No mention
of one for Ferry Porsche. Also, these cars had 72 911S engine.

The 914/8 is the car with the type 908 3.0L engine. Two were made.
One for Ferry Porsche on his 60th birthday and one for Ferdinand
Piech.

Yep.  I have 15x8" wheels with 205/50-15 Comp T/A R1's.  That's quite a bit
smaller than stock in diameter, which is why it works in the front.  I had to
pull out the rear fenders just a hair, but it's subtle.

Next season BFG is supposedly coming out with some new sizes for the
226-compound Comp T/A R1, and I may go with something a little shorter and

Subject: advice on used 911s



Greetings,

I've just joined this net and I already have some questions I like to ask my
fellow porschephiles.

I am thinking about buying a used 911. Last night, I looked at a 1986
911 Carrera Targa, it is black/black, 87K miles, full spoilers.
The owner said that he has just replaced the clutch and the synchro.
I noticed that after I finished test driving, I popped the engine bay and I
could smell the burnt-smell from the clutch. He said it was normal since the
clutch was new. Is that normal?

Also, the shift linkage is very sloppy despite a rebuilt synchro. A lot of time,
I have to search for gears; I was downshifting from fourth to third and I went
into first instead. There was a loud grinding noise and the tach jumped like hell. Luckily, I wasn't going very fast. He said that the linkage was even sloppier
before the synchro was rebuilt. Many times, I can't tell whether I was in first
or third and second or fourth. Is it normal for the shifter to be that sloppy? 
Or is it I have to get used to it?

He also said that all 911s can't shift rather quickly even with  the new ones.
Is that true?

Last but not least, when I was test driving, I thought I heard some bearing 
noise. He assured me that it was the road noise from the tires which were
Comp/TA V rated. It has some treads left maybe another 5000 miles.
He said that if it was Pirellis, the road noise will disappear. 
Is that a fallacy?

Other than that, the car looks and runs good, it has its usual stone chips,
coulpe of door dings by the driver door. It sticks out like a sore thumb though
because the car was black. The targa top is wavy and its pillar's color is
fading. The motor is strong and dried.

What is a fair price for this car which has 87k miles?
He's asking for $19,900 and we are from the Chicago area.

Thanks for your patience reading this long posting.
I appreciate all comments.
I wanna do my home work before sinking any money into it.

  Brendin,
  I, too would be curious as to the option codes(if any) for 914's
  and where the numbers are.

  The A/C systems for 914's was a dealer installed option only, NOT a
  factory installed system.  That's why the front trunk has a rough
  hogged-out opening for the condenser _ugly_. The car wasnt designed for it.
  There were two types of A/C models available VW and APC.  The compressor
  in my system is a York (dont recollect the number) and required
  the dealership to hog out a hole for it to fit in the engine shrouding.
  Another blemish inflicted for passenger comfort.  The  installers also
  had to perforate the body in various places to run the hoses -AacK!

   I love the way it cools (will freeze you on lo -lo @>60mph), but hate
  what it does to performance and character.  IMO, the system is overkill
  in cooling capacity.  I removed the entire contraption from my restored
  914 body, I intend to replace it with components from a honda crx
  (compressor, condenser) and custom fit the thing some day.
  
   If the CFC replacements become readily available, I may switch to 
  components compatible with that system -if not too expensive.

Awright! My kind of car-shopping. Network's technical expertise may not help
you much here. Porsche shopping below $2000 means counting wheels (car should
touch ground in exactly four places, all of them rubber) and checking if you
can see the road below in addition to in front and in back. I love a good
$2000 car, just so long as it is a toy that you don't need Monday and you 
don't mind using some of the other money.  "What other money?"  The other
money you'd have to pay for a car that's not a project.

I have an aircooled chauvinist sense that the "right" way to come into Porsche-
world is from Beetle to 914 etc., but that may just be because their engines
stand up by themselves when they're out of the car.

Two more taglines for the recent thread:
"Don't laugh at my car and I won't laugh at yours."
"Never pay the asking price."

Enjoy the shopping for its own sake -- it's the cleanest fun you'll have for
months.  Good luck.

In Mark Donohue's book, "The Unfair Advantage", he claims that the
reason most race prep'd 911s lift their front wheels is because people
use very stiff front anti-roll bars trying to conteract oversteer.

I recall that he had a different solution to setting up a 911, but I
don't remember off the top of my head.  (I'm sure he wasn't talking
about autox, though.)

modified my stock throttle cam to make the response more linear and
decrease the pedal travel required in the early part of the throttle.
This was quite easy to do and didn't require removing it.  The later
portion of the cam is round and is connected to an arm extension in which
the cable travels.  This longer arm decreases rotation angle for equal
amounts of cable travel.  All I did was cut a groove in the cam to route
the cable through, thus eliminating the extended portion. I then had to
take some slack out with the throttle adjustment.  Thus I had a cam with
a constant radius which is what the picture of the Autothority one looked
like.  The Autothority version may use a different radius.

I liked the "feel" of the modified throttle on the track, but the biggest
benefit was during heel&toe downshifting. Less throttle travel was helpful
when one foot was doing 2 pedals.

     Tensioner update kits at AJR are about $410.  I'm here in
San Diego.  I drove over there and told them I could drive 60
miles to San Marcos and get the kit for $359 from WPA (which also

please save me the drive.  They mumbled about the completness of
the kit, something about spacers, and agreed to $369.

Look at it as propaganda, as nice as the new Corvette is, the chances
of a Corvette driver having enough understanding of what it can do are
far lower that that of the AVERAGE Porsche driver.

David Blanchard and I have proven that quite a number of times.

The fact that they have to wear a T-shirt...... well I'd suppose thats 
to impress the owners of the Japanese stuff. They have no idea and will
believe anything, look at what they bought.

On the X-8, four pairs of cylinders on a common crankcase. The damn 
thing fires smooth and balances each 90 degrees. Ford almost built it
as a cheaper version of the regular Ford. It was NOT a true radial, as 
they fire sequentially around the direction of rotation because of the

    Kevin-

    I am thinking about building a 3.0l motor for a track/road car
    (read "I will drive it to the track").  I saw your message the
    other day about Flowmasters and was wondering how it would be on a
    3.0l.  How is it for the street?  How does it compare to
    Supertraps?  How about the weight comparison to Supertraps?

    I expect my setup to be 3.0l PCs on 3.0 crank w/3.0l heads but it
    will be on a 3.2 case with 3.2 crank fire.  While I do have the
    full 3.2 induction/injection, I think I will use carbs (probably
    40IDAs to start).  How will the Flowmaster work with this setup?
    How about cost?

    Also, do you know if I can use the 3.2 crank fire & brain w/out
    the induction?

    Comments are appreciated.

Bob,

	The spacers you mention are necessary for a kit upgrade of the
chain tensioners, but not the best way to do it.  

	I got my tensioners from Imparts for $359, no tax, no shipping,
with extra gaskets, and I also got the new, complete chain wheel 
carriers which incorporate the 'spacer' into the construction.  I
believe the two updated carriers ran an extra $40.

I know there was a bunch of recent traffic on 944 front end issues, but not

Do 944's wear out ball joints?

I have begun to notice a very soft clunk coming from the right front
suspension of my '89 turbo. The clunk can barely be felt / heard in the
steering at low parking lot speeds when I hit a bump and disappears at
speeds above 20 MPH. I have removed the wheel and checked for something
obvious, broken shock, tie rod, etc, but found everything to appear normal.
Could this be a ball joint begining to wear out? The car has 55K miles. Any
other ideas?

Thanks for any help you can give him...

Cheapest way is to play with the wheels and tires.  This was discussed in

In Pano I have seen Andial has 928 gears listed in their ad.  I looks tho 
like they only offer lower.  Terminology of lower could be lower numerical 
(what you want).

IMO, If you tend to yearn for the same acceleration feel,  you may be more 
into the throttle, and end up at the same point.  Then the clutch wear, 
speedo error, etc....

Greg,

My local newspaper has a special column in the classifieds entitled
'autos under $1000.'  This is where I look for 924's and usually
find them.

If the car is running, then with regular oil changes, it will most
likely continue to run until you get $1800 worth of transportation
out of it.  Perhaps sans any comfort or style.

If you have to join the PCA and need a Porsche to do it and only
have $2000 to spend, this will do the trick.  As a weekend project,
as was previously mentioned.

If you are not presently in a transportation emergency, I would hold
out for a 78+ 911 SC.

As for 912's, a '76 912E is just a step above the 924 when it comes
to holding value (based on personal observation), and a early 912
with carbs won't start monday morning come January in ND.  Same
with early 911's (before about 1975?)

Not wanting to personally rupture Bob's bubble, but the value of
the 912E is accelerating rapidly. The "collector market" figured out
that this is a mighty rare beast, and good samples are *VERY* hard to
come by. 

Admittedly, it's not as good a car relative to the '76 911 as say the
'66 912 was relative to the '66 911 -- but that seldom counts when people
are looking at cars from an ROI perspective. If you happen to know

Yes.  Sigh.  Puhn describes diagnosing them in his book "How to Make
Your Car Handle,"  f'rinstance.  Get a really big pair of slip-joint
pliers.  Put the bottom jaw on the underside of the ball joint.  Put
the top on the top side of the ear in the steering knuckle to which
the ball joint fastens.  Squeeze.  If you see no play in the ball, ie,
squeezing doesn't push it up, it's perfect.  If you do see a millimeter
or so of play, judgement call.  If you see much more, get out that
credit card.

Check the locking nut at the top of the shock bearing, under the hood.
It can loosen, and if you've had it off more than once or twice, it may
have lost its ability to lock properly.  Use red Loctite on a new one.

If you have Weltmeister sway bars, check the tightness of the fasteners
and the condition of the heim joints.  They will definitely clunk, even
if only a teeny bit loose.  Also, if loose, they tend to chew up the
collar washers in the heim joints.  If you don't have the "competition"
versions, check the rubber bushings which also wear.

Check the strut for play between the shock piston and the shock body.  With
the wheel off, grab the strut on the spring perch, and push and pull it.
It is not uncommon for there to be some play, which can be mistaken for
a loose wheel bearing.  A little play is nothing to worry about.

Check the free rotation of the top spring "perch" in the shock bearing.
With the wheel off, have some turn the steering wheel.  Ideally, the
top perch will turn, and the spring and the rest of the strut with it.
What will often happen is that the top perch won't turn, and so the spring
doesn't, but the bottom perch does.  The spring rubs the bottom perch as
it turns, making funny noises.  No big deal.

Probably other stuff, but it's late, and I'm tired...

  they were most prevalent in the last 18 months.  There may also be a

I've had a '79 924 for over 10 years now.

Beware that almost all opinions of the 924 coming from
Porsche-people are from those who have never driven one, 
and who think that there is something "un-Porsche" about
something you can buy at a reasonable price and that doesn't
rust itself to dust like the pre-galvinized models.

My opinion is that many Porsches (as with many more exotic
cars) are partly priced by snob-appeal, so price is not
necessarily a fun-index, a quality-index, nor a Porsche-index.

The 924 is a fun Porsche.  Insurance is cheap.  They don't
worry much about a $2K car, and neither do I.  99% of the
general public can't distinguish it from a $40K 1993 968.

It won't win drag races.  It will keep up on street curves.
It won't rust out.  It will carry loads of luggage.  It
won't have to be parked at the extremes of parking lots.  It
will go in snow.  It won't lose anywhere near $10K-$20K of
value in a few years.  And it will be fun!  _MS

I just completed two (yes two) upgrades.

Vertex had the kit for about $349 ($369?).  It came with no instructions.
The other kit came from ImParts and also had no instructions.

You should also replace the chain ramps.  Five black and one brown.
Brown goes in the lower right.

The spacers are for pre-mid-1980 cars.  My car ('80) is post change.
I ordered the spacers (if anyone wants them they're free but you 
have to pick them up on Mountain View, CA.) but did not need them.
At least I couldn't find anywhere they could fit into the engine (and
the serial # indicated that they were not needed).

Installation is pretty easy.  Count on two days the first time.
It's mostly just take it apart and put it back together.

As with any 911 repair, ** if something's in the way, remove it,
don't try to work around it **.

I agree with previous postings that it's probably a CV joint,
but one other thing to check - the inside (upper) bushings
on the trailing arms might be worn out and the trailing arms
might be thrashing around a bit. It doesn't take much movement
to make a lot of noise.

Also, while it would seem obvious, check the bolts that 
connect the cv joints to the transmission and hub ends, to
make sure they're all tight.

Hint: They make even more noise when they come all the way off  

        (not admitting to any past sins, of course!)

From: David_K._Ferguson@Quadzilla.Apple.COM
Subject: 914 suspension upgrades

I am thinking of modifying the rear suspension of my 914-6 race car.  

I currently use adjustable spring perches, with 150-250lb springs (autox
vs. roadracing), and a 16mm anti-roll bar.  I have reinforced the chassis
in the trailing arm area (basically the factory 6pc kit), and have boxed
the trailing arms and installed the Weltmeister plastic bushings.  I use
Goodyear radial slicks on 16x10" rims.

The biggest problem that we have is compliance that is introduced as the
trailing arm pivot shaft elongates the shaft hole in the inner mount area. 
The
problem seems to be that the Weltmeister bushing tend to "grab" the shaft,
and cause it to turn, acting like a drill (or file) on the inner mount.  I
also have a slight problem where the trailing arm seems to interfere with
the trailing arm under full bump  (this actually defines full bump since
the interference is putting a dent in both the trailing arm, and the
chassis).  This occurs because of the extra material added by the
reinforcing of both the trailing arm and the chassis.

I was thinking of trying to convert the trailing arm mounts to use a
spherical bearing to hold the shaft, and maybe trying to build new trailing
arms using a stock hub area attached to tubes leading forward terminated
with rod-ends.

Has anyone heard of anyone doing anything like this?  I would like to learn
from your experiences.   If I design and develop this suspension setup,
would anyone be interested in buying a conversion kit?

If you want to send email to me directly, you can use either the address in
the header of this message or the short form: ferg@quadzilla.apple.com.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Is this for real Stan? They must have been military

increased? I had a Chevy MonteCarlo company car one time
that rode like it had a half-full tube of mercury in the
headliner!

One other bit of info on choosing a 911 body style for the 
track - taller drivers might have helmet clearance problems in 
sunroof coupes. I'm not sure about Targas.

By the way 914 drivers - if you want an ego boost, hang out
at your local PCA Racing Series or club event. Those little
buggers sure can get around the track (even without V8 
engines) I've seen 2.0 liter (4 cyl) 914's clean some 911
clocks on some *gold-chain-type* unsuspecting drivers. You
can have fun in ANY Porsche, and more cubes is still no
replacement for driving skill.

My 1984 911 Cabriolet had an oil leak at the main crank shaft seal at the 
transmission when I was using Castrol 20W50. My mechanic put in (by shear luck) 
Kendall 20W50 and the leak stopped. Is this possible? Has anyone heard of this? 
Where can I buy some Kendall oil, other than from my mechanic who charges $60 
for an oil change?

The same car sometimes has some difficulty going into 2nd gear. It does not 
grind, just refuses to go in. Any idea? Can using a good synthetic oil like Red

The workshop manuals and the technical specification

Don't even consider it. If the wheel is out of true

(Or turn it into artwork). The strength of Fuchs
alloys comes from the forging process. This is a one

Well, the tubes run parallel to the ground. I dated a girl in the
late 70s who's father had installed a set on her Mustang. Since at
the time I also had a Mustang (with a Ford NASCAR SHOC 428 CJ, but
that's another story...) we would "get frisky" on the roads from time
to time. It wasn't until I ducked under her car for a peak at whatever
mondo-swaybar she *had to be* running that I noticed these big tube things
running fore-and-aft. When I asked about them, she blushed and said that
her dad had installed them as a "secret weapon" to help her embarrass the
various guys who thought that girls couldn't drive. Asking him gave
the rest of the story of their origin. Further deponent saith not.

Amen! I test-sat a Speedster and a sunroof coupe today while I was
waiting on a status check as to how the swap meet this weekend was
coming together. I *COULD NOT GET IN THE CAR* on the Speedster. Like
my head would not go under the top with my butt in the seat. Scary.
And the sunroof coupe, well, that was a joke, too. I had to crank the
seat all the way down and lay it back about 40 degrees to get where my
head was not touching the top. And that's *WITHOUT* a helmet. Oh, never
have such problems with my Targa, nor with friend's Cabs, even with the
helmet. Guess it's either Targas, Cabs, or car surgery for me...

I've seen this done on 911s, and on the full tube-frame GT-2 914/6s, but
not to a basicly stock tub 914.

I've never seen it done, but if you do it, you might consider having the
part cast in aluminium with the Vellios 911SC rear brake mounting flanges
as part of the deal. Since getting the Vellios "super" trailing arms is
about a $1k investment, and you still have the run-out problem you mention
with them, I know that *I'd* be interested in being able to get a set
of Al arms (stronger, lighter) that also let me use 930 bearings and flanges,
and 911SC brakes for the same kind of money...

The C4, in the UK, is only type approved with the cat fitted - although
having said that it's not illegal to fit non-cat systems (presumably
the FI control must also be updated) because the UK obtained exemption from
the EC for such things. I do, however, think that it's a shame to throw away 
something that has such a great effect on emissions output for a measly 15PS,
which could probably have been obtained with any aftermarket system anyway (inc
cat). Unfortunately the MoT (yearly vehicle test) emissions test is so lax
as to make it a joke (eg my '73 911T with carbs would easily pass the test for 
'93 year cars with 3-way cats!!). I hope this is not a trend in the UK considering the 
pollution problems the UK has with auto-emissions.

Now, where's that nomex stuff.... :-).

Pre-A speedos are 160 Kph until May '52 then 200 Kph or 120 MPH
afterwards. "A" speedos are 120 MPH for US models, or 200 Kph for Euro,
but Carreras were 160 MPH or 250 Kph -- except the 12 volt Carreras,
which had a "different unit" (about which I know nothing). "B" speedos
where 120 MPH/200Kph, but the Carrera 2 (2000GS) had a 160 MPH
unit. "C" speedos were just like "B" units.

Given that, I have *no idea* what you have unless it's one of the
12 volt Carrera units that I don't have a description for.

	There was an article in PANO awhile back about the 936.
The factory built 2 for their use.  They built one more (after
Excellence was written) for Joest Racing, but they called it
a 908/80 (in 1980) so as not to piss off their other customers
who had also asked for a 936.  Rumor has it there is another
936 kit in a box somewhere in CA, yet to be assembled.

     On the 928, take off the side carpet panels surrounding the radio bay. 
     This makes it easier to manuver the radio. Does your radio have four

     pins, jeweler's screwdrivers, you name it.. long, straight, metallic 
     (toothpicks won't do), fitting the hole as closely as possible. 
     Minimum length is about 1 1/2 inches. Now put one nail in each hole; 
     leave enough head sticking out of the faceplate so that you can pull 
     the nail out with needlenose pliers if required. This will release the 
     four catches (one per hole). Now reach in behind the radio (remember, 
     you removed the side panels so you can reach behind) and push it out. 
     Expect a firm push will have to do the job.
     
     My wife's Saab turbo had a clarion radio with the same layout. Only 
     her radio came with a pair of sexy U-shaped metal gizzies which not 
     only released the catches but made nice handles to pull the radio out 
     with. Maybe you can find one at a car stereo store.
     
     Worked for me.

Any advice on how to get the radio (Baupunkt (RENO SQR 46)) out of a 928S ?
     
I just got the car, and the radio needs to be serviced, or replaced.
     
Any tips would be appreciated.

I'll check the voltage and see what says,it seems the 'green' starts at
37.5 and stops at 45 mph.

>Why is VW stamped all over my 914 motor??
    Well, the car was first sold as the VW-Porsche 914.  That's right,
it has a good ol' Type-IV VW engine in it.  Think of it as an engine from
a late Microbus, and you won't be far wrong.

>Should I replace it with a REAL Porsche motor ??
    Yes, especially if you have a whole bunch of money lying around,
and a friendly neighborhood Porsche mechanic who needs to make a
mortgage payment or two.  If you go the air-cooled route, you get a
lot more power and torque for not much weight.  Just make sure that
both you and the suspension and brakes can handle the extra power.

    Yum, yum!  It'll look kinda funky (IMHO) with the monster flares,
but it would be a *real* fun ride!  I've seen several 914's prepped
that way.  And of course, if you keep some form of Porsche engine 
in it, you can do PCA auto-X, time trials, club races, etc.  More chances
to race with a pretty good bunch of folks.

Someone else mentioned this problem recently when using Weltmeister plastic
suspension bushings.  On my 914 autocrosser, I have a similar rear suspension
setup, except that I don't use slicks and I haven't reinforced the chassis
or the trailing arms (I wish I could, but it's illegal in Street Prepared).

Am I likely to have this same problem?  How can I tell?  What can I do about
it, legally?

Thanks for your advice.

I believe that these radios have four holes, two on each side, each about
the size of a medium-sized nail (ok, I forget the pennyweight).  I get
mine out by inserting a nail in each, which pushes back a flat-spring
sort of lock, allowing the radio to slide forward.

Or you can get the official tool, which does exactly the same thing.

I've never heard of the caster pieces wearing; I guess anything's possible.
I would suspect that you're having one of two problems.  One thing to keep
in mind is that there is quite a bit of adjustability in toe and camber,
but considerably less in caster.  Caster is also the hardest to gauge
when doing an alignment.

So, problem #1 may be operator error in doing the alignment.  For example,
sometimes the plates on which the four wheel sit may bind up, perhaps
because they happened to be near the edge of their travel when the
car was driven on.  Or there are a bunch of other possible mistakes.

Problem #2 may be damage to the front frame or suspension, per bodywork you
noticed.  You may be able to get around its effect on toe and camber because
of their adjustability.  But not caster.

Btw, your alignment figures are about right.  You should have a little
toe-in, like 10 minutes or so.  Camber is largely a matter of how you
use your car.  We took a little out of my front tonight, down to 2.1
degrees from about 2.5 after pyro testing.  I run about half that in the
winter with winter tires.  Caster is good at about 2.5 to 3 degrees in a
944.

Subject: Fuel tank sender seal problem

Hi all-

On my '77 924, as I mentioned a few weeks back, I had a strong smell
of fuel in the passenger compartment, and after pulling the tank, we 
found some corrosion, and a pressure test on the tank showed some problems.
Ok.  So I bought a used tank, got it cleaned up, and we put it back in
the car.  The tank I bought came with a fuel lever sender as a bonus,
but the o-ring was shot.  Using my old sender and a new o-ring, I figured,
would be OK.  Unfortunately, after filling the tank up (full), and doing
a little test drive with a few sharp turns, I started to get a major leak
around the seal!  My mechanic (who was open on Saturday) and I looked
at this, and could not figure out what was wrong.  The surface of the
tank and the sender seem clean; what could be causing this problem?  Any
ideas out there?  My mechanic mentioned to me that the setup is identical
to that of the VW/Audi (no surprise there), and he usually has never had
a problem with such things.  Are we missing anything?  Is there anything
special about sealing systems that come in contact with gasoline (other
than not smoking while working :-) )?

Thanks.

          Greg - "european car" magazine recently did a 13 part series
          on a 1978 924 project car.  If you decide to go ahead with
          the "bargain" 924, I could probably dig out copies of the

Subject: Yet another 944 timing belt question

Sorry folks, another question on this subject :-)

I have an 83 944 , acquired in May this year. Although I was assured by the
(non-Porsche) dealer that sold it to me that the timing belt had been replaced,
I took it to the local Porsche dealer a couple of weeks ago to have it checked
out and re-tensioned.

Now, although this dealer has a very good reputation, I'm not a trusting sort
of guy when it comes to this subject, so here's the question for you net
experts :

It seems to me, when the engine is cold, that the belt has sufficient
play to just lightly tap against the plastic cover, downstream from the
cam pulley. It can be heard doing so, but the noise seems to go away when
the engine has warmed up. I have no idea if this is normal, but I cannot
recall hearing it before the dealer did the work.

I don't have access to the tensioning tool, nor can I find anywhere it is
sold in France (seemingly not through the dealer network), so what do I do ?

Trust that the dealer adjusted it correctly and pray ??  

Drive to Germany and get a 'real' mechanic to do the job :-)

Stop worrying about it and focus more on that nasty sound from the clutch .....

Many thanks ..

Chris.

Does anyone out there have any experience with Leland West
Insurance.  The advertise in Panorama and offer PCA members a
special deal for Porsche only insurance.

I looked into it and it is more than competitive with State
Farm....something like $150 cheaper for better coverage(stated
value), incl. flatbed towing, motoring accessories coverage and $75
deductible windshield ins.

Are these people reliable?

From what you describe your belt is too loose. When you got it back from 
being tensioned the engine sound should have changed slightly to include a 
slight whine from the belts. If this did not occur then they were not 
tensioned enough. If they are slapping the casing when cold they need 
retensioning. Yes you should worry, you could be heading for a valve job or 
worse.

The 914 didn't have a Porsche motor to begin with.

Have any of you actually compared the cost/power/weight differences
between converting to a 911 motor vs. a small block american V6/V8 ??

How is doing a "clean" motor conversion worse than cutting a car
up to prep it for racing?

You guys need to lighten up on this "100% Porsche" thing.
The 914 is basically a kit car anyway.
	body by Karmann
	manufactured by Volkswagenwerk AG
	motor by VW
	with a few Porsche parts thrown in

If I had the money to do it, I would look very hard at ALL the options
for a motor conversion. From the things I have read, A Mazda rotary
engine seems like the best choice.

But, what do I Know??

Do you think the motor from my John Deere cotton picker will
fit in my 914??

<Chris.

Funny you should mention this, when my car ('84 944) was new, I had exactly
the same problem; just before the 20t km service was coming up,I heard the
timing belt hit the cover when the engine was still cold.I also veryfied this
by checking the scratch marks on the inside of the cover. After adjustment,
the noise dissapeared so I concluded that the belt had just been to slack.
Unfortunately, I cannot remember if it was the cam belt or the counterwheight
shafts belt.

There are some upgrades for the belt system(s), at 120t km I had one installed
which is basically a guide that prevents the insides (toothed sides) of the cam
belt touching each other at their closest point in the event of the belt beeing
to slack.

I've also heard of a pressure-fed tensioning system ala 3.2 911, but as I
recall, this was incredibly expensive at the time.

The cam belt itself comes in different flavors, I'm just about to install the
4:rth set of belts (at 200t km:s) and the part number of the recently acquired
cam belt (in Switzerland) ends with 04.From what I hear, the later belts don't
stretch as much as the earlier ones.

In your place, I would strongly suspect a badly adjusted belt, and I would also
check the partnumber on the cam belt to get an idea of its age.

I've heard a lot about 944 problems on the net, but so far after 200t km:s, all
I've replaced on the car is belts, brake pads and discs,wheel bearings and the
waterpump.

Hope this helps, Tommy

Subject: 924T Wastegate Problem

I am having a problem with my 1982 924 Turbo and would like 
any help/information that may be available.  The car has 
103K miles on it with a turbo rebuild ca. 15K miles ago.  It 
has run very strong (I'll resist saying that "it runs like a 
top" and without any major problems until just recently.

A couple of weeks ago several things happened:  First, it 
started running stronger than it ever had before, then began 
cutting off at high boost.  Second, I discovered from a 
change in engine sound that a (front) exhaust manifold stud 
and one of the two main turbocharger bolts ($53 each from 
the factory!) had dropped out (not broken off) and the 
exhaust manifold gasket appeared to be damaged.

As might be guessed, the major problem aside from lost studs 
appears to center around a wastegate valve that is not 
controlling boost.  We don't yet know if the diaphragm is 
gone or what the precise wastegate problem is.  This is an 
expensive problem.  According to the experienced mechanic 
who has my car, Porsche does not supply rebuilding parts for 
this wastegate and wants ca. $1600 for a new wastegate  
unit.

Here are my questions:
	
	1.  Is this a common problem with 924Ts?

	2.  Are there alternate sources for wastegates or 	
	    are wastegate valve rebuild sets available at 	  
	    reasonable cost for this car?

	3.  Just as an aside, does anyone know just how the 	                             
	    specs on the euro version of the 942T differ from 
	    the US version to enable 177 hp instead of 154?

Any help on these things would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: Porsche's return?

Ed,

	I didn't know that Porsche had gone anywhere!  Porsche
AG is and has been operating in the black for many years.  Over
half of their business is design and R&D for industry all over
the world, including Airbus (A320) and Harley-Davidson (latest
generation of motors).  

	Obviously, they have sold fewer cars worldwide as a result
of the economy, but which carmaker hasn't.  Porsche cars are more
susceptible to economic swings because they are not a necessity
(although I'll argue that on a personal basis, too!).  While their
lows are lower, their highs are higher, too.

	What Japanese onslaught?  The best Japan has mustered is
the Acura NSX, and it's not exactly setting the world on fire.
The New Supra has impressive power, but it's as heavy as the 
300ZX and the VR 3000 GT.

	Pressure on Porsche in the showroom stock racing arena
is coming from the US, in the form of Firebird Formula cars
in SCCA Firehawk.  And Porsche is dominating the Bridgestone
Supercar series.

	As for how Porsche is dealing with the competition (any
and all comers), they are reportedly planning four new models
in the next four years:
'95 993 (new Carrera 2)
'96 986 (Boxster)
'97 996 (rear-engine water-hauler)
'98 996/8 (8-cyl. 3.9 ltr. 400 HP water-cooled rear-engined )

I don't think it's a comeback, just another wave to ride.

The BIG point to make is that they offer only two plans,
Limited Pleasure Use Plan and Classic Collectors Plan.

The key on limited pleasure is that it can not be used for ANY daily 
transportation at all, reading from the pamphlet "...excluded if the Porsche 
is used for any driving to-and-from work, school or shopping.  Business, 
commercial or substitute vehicle use is also excluded.  Porsches must be 
parked overnight in a locked garage or continuously guarded lot."

As I didn't buy my Porsche to stay in the locked garage, it will always be 
my daily transportation.  If they would add a "low mileage daily plan" that 
would be another story.

Next time I'm looking for a car I'll call you Left coast
p-philes! Our prices would be at least double that here
in the Northeast. Probably due to supply / demand and
the fact that cars turn to dust in 10 years here, zinc
or not, if they're driven in salt/snow.

Anyone up here experience any lower prices, or is this
just common to the suburban NY area?

And if you have noticed any pitfalls in your search.  I have heard the

          Randall - I have owned my '84 944 for a couple of years and
          it has been great for PCA events and entry into the
          porschephile world.  A couple of tips:

           The timing belts are the heart of the engine...adjust
          every 15K and replace every 30K.  If you can't document
          ABSOLUTELY when the belts were changed, factor this into
          your purchase budget.

           I don't think clutch replacements on any Porsche are cheap
          but the clutch housing on the 944 has an inspection port
          which will let you measure the wear and estimate how much
          time you have to save up for your new clutch.

           The motor mounts were also a weak point on early 944s.
          The mounts are constructed like a suspension shock absorber.
          On a ten year old car these have probably already gone kaput
          and been replaced with the upgraded Turbo mounts but it is
          worth checking.

           Finally, a number of improvements were incorporated in the
          "late '85" models...tipoff for a late '85 is the new style
          dash and instrument cluster.  If I was buying today, I'd try
          to scrape together a few extra $Ks and get a late '85 or
          newer model.

          Hope this is of some help and welcome to 944 land.

cooler without having to get new connecting hoses eg 3.2 Carrera '85 on.  Can
anyone shed any light as to what coolers are compatible with the 2.2 S
hardware.

Subject: 3.0 engine

I am looking for a 3.0 engine with all the associated hardware (pollution
stuff, muffler, etc.).  I want one that does not need rebuilt and that has
relatively low miles (50K-100K).  If you know of one currently available,
or one that will be available in the next few months you can contact me
direcly at any of the addesses shown below.  

I will use it to replace my 2.7 which now has 153K miles. It is running
well, but I want to plan ahead.  I use the car as a daily driver, so a good
solid reliable engine is the goal.

Thanks

The lock consists of a mechanical part, and the electrical switch below it,
which seperate easily. Once the mechanical part is out, the switch can be
checked by inserting a screwdriver and turning it like you do with the key. 
Cost for a the electrical switch only is about $15.

Taking out the lock is fairly easy, in fact i was astonished that Porsche
didn't make it harder. Remove the steering wheel and take out the switch for
direction signs/ wiper. Might have to remove the foam pad under the dash to
get to the connectors. Two screws will then release the lock.

Hope that helps, Hans

Subject: Newbie wants advice

Newbie here:

I need a new car, and rather than spent $15-20K on a new Japanese car I'm  
thinking pretty seriously about getting an older Porsche instead. I've  
been looking at late 70's/early 80's 911 or 911SC, a few of which I've  
seen in the $10-15K range. Or I could go cheaper and get a 911T or 912 for  
less. I need something dependable that I can commute in (60 miles round  
trip). I suspect that I won't get the reliability of a new Jap car, but  
the pride and fun of driving a Porsche would be worth something to me. 


Questions: what should I look for? Are there certain models, years, etc.  
to avoid? What sorts of mechanical things should I check to make sure I'm  
getting a good car? Any other suggestions? (Or maybe a good book to read?)

many thanks

Subject: Can a 930 be an everyday car?

Hi there -

I am considering purchasing a 1987 930 (or is it 911 turbo??) and have 
a few questions of interest (ranging from mundane to real issues in no
particular order):

1. Am I looking at a 911 turbo or a 930?  Kelly blue book and all the
adds in the paper say 911 turbo but the mailing list here and other
persons call it a 930?

2. Anyone have a feel for how this car would serve as a drive-to-work
car? Specifically, I am concerned about driving in the rain, driving
in the snow ..etc.

3. The car has 66,000 miles which is high for this type of car.  It
already had its 60,000 checkup but what other types of maintenance are
common around 60K miles (timing belts, motor mounts ...etc?).

4. How many miles can I expect to get out of the turbo prior to having
to do some major work on it?

5. Anyone have a feel for the performance difference between the 1987
3.3T and the 1993 3.6T (I see numbers on the 3.6 but how does the 3.3
compare?) 

These are the questions that have already come to mind.  I am more
than interested in any other issues at large so please feel free to
point out any that were missed.

Thanks -
Jay Connelly

Sorry for the non-applying geographical band-width BUT...

Is anyone going to be attending the Western Michigan Region Grattan

The event is 2 days (Saturday & Sunday Morning Lapping Practice, Sunday
Afternoon time-trials).

This is the same event that in 1991 was the site of an outragous

make you do strange things.

I'll be in a Gold 928 stop by and say hi.

Karl,

For one thing, lets be nice people and call it a "Japanese" car; not
a "Jap" car which sound derogatory or racist.

A '78 to '83 911SC would be a very reliable car. All I have to do is
change the oil (3000 miles) and tune it up once a year. It runs great,
gets descent mileage and is fast enough.

Scott Winders says not to sound racist when refering to Jap. Well, when I hear
Jap, I think of an oddity in motoring history, the JAP. A three-wheeled 
vehicle with two wheels in front and a prominent, air-colled JAP motor. This
car can be seen in a Peter Sellers movie, "The Party". I, too, have seen one
tooling around the greater South Bay. Quite lovely.

PS	I think JAPs were used as aircraft motors. Anyone?

Subject: 944 Turbo information

Hi,

I'm new to this mailing group, and I have some basic questions about purchasing 
a used 944 Turbo or 944 S4.  Thanks in advance for any answers and/or opinions
to these questions.  Also, apologies in advance if this subject has been hacked
to death before.

1) What were the years these models were in production?  In particular, what
   are "bad" and "good" years for these cars, and for what reasons? (i.e. 
   drivetrain or suspension improvements, or nagging reliability issues)
   A brief description of the improvements/model year would be interesting,
   including such details as whether they were produced with ABS, airbags,
   traction control, etc.

2) Given a choice, would you buy a 944 Turbo or a 944 S4?  Why?  How bad is the
   turbo lag on the 944 Turbo in day-to-day driving?

3) How are these cars for interstate drives over two hours?  Are they
   particularly uncomfortable or noisy?

If you have any comments regarding these cars that you think are relevant,
please include those as well.  I suspect the car will be driven a few times
a week, but not as a daily commuter (I ride my bike to work...).

thanks,
albert

No. But it was a Porsche design, specifically for taking the 911 engine
and going FIA racing. Note that Year One, they went 1,2,3 in class at
LeMans. And it only got better from there, right up until IMSA banned
the 914/6 in competition (hey, you could outrun a 956 in one, for a
hell of a lot less money)...

The VW engine deal was originally to make it economically feasible to
produce the cars, since Porsche knew they'd never make enough of the
6 cylinder guys to make it worthwhile. And, it would have worked *VERY*
differently if it had not been for the unfortunate plane crash which 
killed the VW operations guy who had made the deal on a "gentleman's 
agreement" basis...

>Have any of you actually compared the cost/power/weight differences
>between converting to a 911 motor vs. a small block american V6/V8 ??

Yes. Both for street and racing. And have actually done a number of
911 conversions.

>How is doing a "clean" motor conversion worse than cutting a car
>up to prep it for racing?

It isn't. But that's the point: you can't just drop a V8 into a 914,
you *MUST* do a whole pile of stuff which falls onto the "prep for
racing" list if you're serious about racing.  This includes full chassis
reinforcement and tubular semi-frame, different (improved) suspension, bigger 
brakes/wheels/tires/fender flares to accommodate same, hydraulic clutch, 
916 transmission kit, fix *ALL* rust, relocate battery, and while you're 
at it, probably all the cosmetic stuff too.

If you *DO* all that stuff, then you have a well prepared one-off car that 
you can drive in reasonable comfort for a long time. Unfortunately, not
counting the motor, which you'll probably want to "prep" and most likely
will want to "balance and blueprint", and the induction/exhaust stuff,
which will all have to be *CUSTOM FABRICATED*, and the cooling system,
which you'd better design before you build the car (so you can cheat and use
tublar frame members to carry hoses front-to-rear) -- just the body prep
you need to do to get ready for this other stuff will set you back
well up in the high 20k's. Assuming you do it halfway right. Assuming
you aren't a professional-grade racing fabricator. Assuming you aren't
qualified to do a full chassis engineering job. If you are, then well,
that's different, and it will only cost about $10k in parts (but if you
were so f****** brilliant, why would you be doing this anyway?)

So, figure that you're looking at a $30-45k investment, to do it "right".
That's still not bad, for a street-legal mid-engine Big-Three powered
car. But if you're thinking about doing this, it's because you were
either dropped on your head as small child, or because you're *CHEAP*
and think you can do something better than the factory for a whole
lot less money. Yeah. Right.

If you *DON'T* do all of the above, you wind up with a car that you
either can't cool, can't stop, can't shift right due to body flex,
or that simply comes apart when you "stand on it". There is one of these
in Houston -- looks great, huge flares filled with 'vette-sized wheels
and tires, nice Buick Al v8 with all sorts of go-fast stuff. Stock 914
brakes. Toyota 1.6 liter radiator, no fan. No chassis reinforcement.
Press-on rubber hose for oil plumbing. I've seen this guy spray all
sorts of fluids on the ground. I've seen him rip one of his rear 
suspension corners *RIGHT OFF THE CAR*. He doesn't get it. More fool he.

On the other hand, you run into some of the same problems putting a 911 
engine into a 914 -- except one thing: they were designed to fit, and you can
get the right parts to make it work pretty much off the shelf from any
number of aftermarket sources. Not the stuff to make a "real" 914/6
clone, but the stuff to make it work -- the Quick Six bar, the FAT Performance
oil tank, the Performance Werkes header system, etc. And, you can find
a good used 911 engine for about $3-7k, depending on vintage, and be
"running" for less than $12k.

Because you *don't* upset the balance of the car. And you *don't* add
a weight load that it's not designed to take. And you *don't* need to
deal with extra water cooling stuff. You do still need better brakes,
and would probably like bigger wheels/tires/etc., and if you're going
to race the car, of course you need the cage and chassis reinforcement.
But because you have a relatively low torque engine that makes power in
the high RPMs, instead of a high torque engine that explodes at high
RPMs, you don't need to do near the chassis reinforcement. And can even
use the stock rear suspension pieces!

>If I had the money to do it, I would look very hard at ALL the options
>for a motor conversion. From the things I have read, A Mazda rotary
>engine seems like the best choice.

Yeah, that would be nice. If you were going to do something like that.
Or a Toyota 4A engine. But you'd have to engineeer and fabricate *EVERYTHING*.
And my cost estimates aren't that far off, unless you've got a machine
shop in your briefcase...

>Do you think the motor from my John Deere cotton picker will

Nope. But you might try the single-cylinder Porsche "Junior" tractor
engine...

I've wasted enough time on this. I gotta go see a new prospective customer...

Subject: 914 headlights not moving

Could some lucky devil (who has a set of schematics) give me an idea of
which wires/parts to go after?

1. With all of the lights off I turn the knob on top of the headlight motors
   and after a few turns the headlights pop up, and then go back down (which
   is a good thing).

2. When I pull the headlight switch all the way out all of the lights come
   on except for the headlights which don't pop up either (which is a bad
   thing).

3. With the light switch all of the way out the motors don't even pop up when
   I manually turn the knob (which is a ? thing).

4. If I manually crank the headlights up with the light switch pulled out, and
   then push the light switch in, the headlights go down (which is a normal
   thing).

Both headlights behave (or misbehave) the same. The engine doesn't need to be
running for the headlights to work, does it? If so, how to you wire around
that (that, IMO, would be too stupid).

Which manuals (besides the $400 variety) have the best set of schematics?

Thank you for reading this.

Well, in the few minutes before I go home: there were no "bad" years 
but there are a few differences:
	1) the '86 turbos (951's) are the only ones with positive offset steering and
	the matching wheels.  all later years have new offset (negative) which
	allows more wheel selection.
	2) '87+ had ABS as an option, if not standard.  Turbo S & S2 had it
	standard.
	3) '86 951 had headlight washers, xmission cooler standard, later cars
	had them as option until Turbo S.  I *think* the S2 had them as optional too
	4) all years have brakes insufficient for the track - you'll warp 
rotors.  Change
	the pads, no matter which car you get
	5) '87's had water pump problems - check this
	6) '86's 951's had exhaust manifold & fuel line problems & recalls, along
	with some '87 S's I think (might be wrong on the S's)
	7) a few diddly other things that I can't remember, but basically not much

> 2) Given a choice, would you buy a 944 Turbo or a 944 S4?  Why?  How

The S4 is a 928.  The 944 S2 is a little slower than a 951 (turbo) but 
smoother and less peaky in engine power than the turbo.  Probably lower 
maintenance (no turbo, no turbo problems...)  Otherwise they're very 
similar.  I bought a turbo because I like ultimate kick & speed, not 
short autocross low-end.  depends on your desires.

No, they're quite nice actually.  I drive to Watkins Glen - 6 hours - 
with no discomfort, and I'm 6' 1".

... After decades of gears that won't shift, headlights that don't light 
and brakes that burst into flames, the Jaguar has fans who can't get enough
of horror stories, which are a very big part of the lore of the car.  Many 
of the 47 Jaguar clubs in the U.S. now give annual awards, some called  the
