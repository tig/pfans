Subject: Re: Porsche quality & market position (long text)

	Some comments on Jim Selders' thought-provoking contribution:

>>  I've never heard the name Deming in relation to Porsche.

	Uh-oh.  This is exactly my concern.

>>  But those Germans can be proud and stubborn, so who knows what they're up to

*If* they (a fine German company such as Porsche) would implement 
a program of quality improvement, I'm sure that they would do a 
fine job of it.  To be successful, ongoing quality improvement 
requires dedication and commitment - surely strengths of Porsche.
My concern is that the transition takes courage to depart radically
from the way things have been done, and this is *not* an easy thing to do,
especially for a tradition-rich company such as Porsche.

	The irony of these situations - when a fundamental change occurs
in a business (in this case, auto manufacturing according to new design 
principles) - is that the successful companies are typically the *most* 
resistant to change ... and therefore the most likely to suffer.  
Having worked for a German firm (Siemens, in Munich) for several years, 
I agree with Jim's comment that German firms can be *very* resistant 
to change.


>>  In any event, applying Deming techniques would improve the quality and

>>  The net effect is more money in Porsche's pocket and the consumer's.  
>>  Sounds like a win-win!  

	Exactly!


>>  Hey, let's get somebody from Weissach on this mailing list!

	Good idea.  I wish that we could use this forum to provide
feedback and suggestion to lots of services that see us as "customers:" 

	* SCCA (being attempted in autocross mailer)
	* Pacific regional autocross director (being done in autocross mailer)
	* ESPN & ABC motorsports (done on an ad hoc basis, in autocross, when 
	  some comments are gathered and mailed to their programming director)

	My fear is that they are moving upmarket \\not because they want to
sell more extravagant cars// (though there has been decision to decrease
production below the level of the" 944 boom" years, to prevent oversupply
of the car from reducing demand), but \\because they have to//, in response to 
increased competitive pressure (similar price/performance offered by 
Japanese products).  If this is the case, then running from the competition 
to a new arena will *not* solve their problems.

	I think that the move upscale is forced by the performance/price 
that Japanese cars provide.  I am disturbed by the arguments that are 
made in defense of Porsche which revolve around the financial *need* to 
make more costly cars.  IFF a company produces a superior product, then 
they can be financially successful making any kind of car that they want.  
Porsche makes exclusive sports cars, but Japan offers similar performance
at much lower costs now.  Knowing that price/performance is not linear,
do we really expect Porsche to be able to fundamentally enhance their 
product (relative to the Japanese) by spending incrementallly more 
on their cars?  And what prevents the Japanese firms from following suit,
now that they can compete with Porsche?

	The reality is that Porsche probably has higher development costs 
than the Japanese, so they have a choice:

	* stand and fight (requires cultural change, to become more efficient
	  producer, in order to compete)

	* move upscale (risky, requires new products that provide 
	  incremental value) 

I hope that Weissach's new product strategy (in providing incremental value)
is more than simply "exclusivity" because that depends on people paying more 
for less performance.  I think that Porsche is moving out of the segment 
because it has become too congested with new competitors, and their 
heritage and desire for "exclusivity" gives them an excuse to move upscale.

	It *may* be that in order to make the cars that Porsche wants to 
make, that they will become more costly to produce.  But I think that this 
move is being forced by their competition, and it worries me.


>>  I love Porsches, but have to admit that the 300ZX Turbo is a

	I guess that Kevin has hit here at root of the problem: 

   I want to continue to be able to afford Porsches, 
   but Porsche is starting to look more like Ferrari (unreachable)
   with this move.  

I like Porsche, and I hate to see them leave me and many other customers 
behind (and leaving us with one fewer alternative to the Japanese products).


	Competition is healthy, Porsche; stay and fight.  Get lean and mean.

Here are a few questions which have accumulated recently.

1. Mobil was perhaps the first fuel brand which earned a good rep in injected
cars because of its detergent content.  Yet one cannot help noticing Mobil's
consistent absence these days from manufacturers' lists of approved fuels.  Why?

2. Has anyone chipped their '87 or '88 944S with the Autothority chip set?  With
what results?  How has the low-end driveability been affected?  Anyone ponied up
for a chip set from Porsche Motorsports?

3. Has anyone grafted a 944S2 air induction system onto an '87 or '88 944S?  The
theory is that it yields a greater air flow rate and a bit of natural boost at
the manifold.  This allows the fuel flow to be increased, with correspondingly
better performance.

4. Can anyone recommend tires for a 928 which sees all-year driving, but little
snow if its owner can avoid it?  Judging from the recent 951 tire thread, the
following might be appealing:

  Bridgestone RE71 VR4
  Goodrich Comp T/A, V-rated not H-rated
  Dunlop D40-M2
  Pirelli P700 (except nobody has really used 'em)

One point should be mentioned regarding Porsche's production gaffs.  Sure, the
951 had problems with its exhaust header (port liners) when it came out.  But
fixing them didn't cost their owners a red cent.  And someone may indeed have
gone through several manifolds before they got it right, but Porsche stood right
behind them.

PCNA has been extremely generous with me and everone else I know in fixing
busted stuff, even out of warranty.  No squawks from the dealer or rep about,
oh, that funny looking sway bar, or the different ducting, or, say, those brake
lines aren't original, are they?  Were fire extinguishers standard equipment in
'87?  Hmm, 245/45 A008R's to drive to the shopping mall, Mr. Gross?  Danged if I
can imagine any other manufacturer who would stand behind the car this way.

I think that we have to cut Porsche a bit of slack in the quality department. 
They are producing, as Jim pointed out, almost race-ready cars.  When you push
the envelope, things might break.  You go out and hammer your 951 at the track
and autocross, and maybe the clutch friction material works loose.  So you get
it fixed, Porsche sees this happening a lot, and rev's the part.  What else can
you expect?

Porsche doesn't sell 100,000 units of anything a year, and they don't take ten
years to produce a wuss copy of a 'real' car like the Japanese do.

I believe that the real reason to decrease overall sales volumes relates
the need to commit significant investment up front in manufacturing
capacity when the ability to sell that volume depends on a variable
that Porsche cannot control ($/mark). Porsche got in over their head in the
early-mid 80's by significantly increasing their 944 sales volumes in the
US through attractive pricing, commiting (to Audi) for significant
increased manufacturing volume, and then having the $/mark ratio change
to make their cars less competitive, making the additional manufacturing
capacity unneeded. I believe that the statements that Porsche made at
the time said that they would never again commit that degree of their
business future to a foreign market. This essentially forces Porsche
up-market, since the largest opportunity for high volume sales of
their cars is the US.

This does not in any way imply that Porsche should not focus on quality
improvement, but it does say there are other business reasons to move
to high-cost/low-volume if you are a relatively small company. I, by
the way, also deplore the implications to us middle class enthusiasts,
but I guess we will have to settle for used Porsches.

Date: Wed Oct 03 12:14:42 1990


Hi all!  I'm a new member of this list, and I'm currently looking at
buying a used 944 Turbo, and would like a little advice.

I'm currently looking at a couple of 86's.  Both were built in 1985
(03/85 and 07/85, I believe).  I believe the earlier car was one of
the original demonstrators brought over.  Both have 5 speeds, cloth
seats, and sunroofs.  I don't know what (if any) other options were
available except perhaps leather.  Asking price for both is $19995.
My blue book lists the 86 944T at 13375/16725 wholesale/retail, plus
125/175 for alloy and 450/575 for sunroof for 13950/17475.  Both have
43000-45000 miles.

Here are my questions: Is there anything about the 86 (and/or very
early 86) 944T that I should know about?  Any particular problems
that have been cleared up in later years?  What is a reasonable price
for an 86 944T?  Is it a big mistake to buy one that's been driven
hard, or do they hold up pretty well?  I've heard about a replacement
chip that increases power a fair bit.  Anyone know any more?  Price? 
Advantages?  Disadvantages?  Any other mods that are often made?

I plan to autocross the car (I drive an 86 Rx-7 in C Stock now, it'll
move me into B Stock) as well as doing some track time, mostly with
marque clubs I would think.  The early car has Tokiko's on the
back, I'm not sure what (but not stock shocks) on the front, Repco 
Metalmaster brakes, and a new clutch.  I know it's been driven fairly 
hard, and I believe it may have had some front end work (may have hit 
a wall).  On the other hand, the tires are much more reasonable than 
on the other car (Yokohama 4?? vs. Pirelli P7), and the shocks make a
big handling difference.  I might also be able to get a cage thrown
in, as I believe the owner has one, and the car is certainly drilled
(ie. one has been installed at one time). It feels very strong, and 
has 150psi compression in all cylinders, and no leak-down problems.  
There are a couple of minor oil leaks - 'behind belt cover' (timing 
chain?), and 'rear of cam housing'.  Are either of these terribly 
significant?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Last time I checked, they wanted to make sure you could really afford
to buy a new model before they'd schedule you for track time. Bah.

I haven't heard of anything regarding PCNA providing track time.  I know Brumos
did it in Florida, but they did it by themselves.  As you may know, Brumos has
raced Porsches for a number of years.  I believe it is run by Debbie Gregg,
Peter's wife.

Maybe it's already been mentioned, but PCA runs a good number of track events
all over the country and in Canada.  Do the various Northern CA PCA Regions have
events at Laguna or Sears Point?  I'd expect them to.

Also, there are companies that have track events, such as Track Time, but
they're much more expensive and include a multitude of different cars and
driver/car capabilities.  Also, BMWCCA events here in Boston are open to other
marques, and we have another car club that has regular track events open to all
comers (but without instruction).

Go for it, Patty!

I did a similar operation on a '73.  I noticed, actually, that the
cylinder is remarkably identical to those from VWs of that era.  Although
I could have rummaged through my spare parts boxes and disasseble a
handful of locks to find the right pins, I used the brute-force method
instead.  As follows:

	1. Remove cylinder from lock.

	2. Insert key which you would like to operate lock.  This
	   engages the pins; if you inserted the proper key, all pins
	   would be retracted.

	3. File down any protruding pins.

	4. Remove key, reverse, and repeat step 3 for the other
	   orientation.

	5. Reinstall cylinder.

After this procedure, you'll have a re-keyed lock.  The original key
will still work, as will probably a million other keys, but its a
quick-and-dirty method to get your key to fit.

If you have some security issues with this procedure, try the following
(which I'd recommend instead).  Remove the glove compartement lock.  If
the previous owners of your car are anything like the rest of the world,
that lock is pristine.  Take the lock to a locksmith and have him make a
key from it -- you'll get an ORIGINAL key back, or pretty damn close to
one.  Now, swap cylinders between the door lock (non-re-keyed) and the
glove-compartement lock.  Voila: you have a NEW lock on your door, and a
secure glove compartement, much more convenient than two different door
locks.

Cheers!

Subject: Re:  944T info sought

	
	
	Hi all!  I'm a new member of this list, and I'm currently looking at
	buying a used 944 Turbo, and would like a little advice.

Advice: buy one. :-)
	
	I'm currently looking at a couple of 86's.  Both were built in 1985
	(03/85 and 07/85, I believe).  I believe the earlier car was one of
	the original demonstrators brought over.  Both have 5 speeds, cloth
	seats, and sunroofs.  I don't know what (if any) other options were
	available except perhaps leather.  Asking price for both is $19995.

Gee, I paid that much just for one! :-)

I'll let more experienced people (who are also probably better at
bargaining than I am :-) ) give you a real answer to the "what are
they worth?" question. Mine had been kept up at the dealership,
and they put a couple thou into it before putting it up for sale,
so I didn't mind going a little higher. (Well, I *minded*, but I
feel it was worth it.)

	There are a couple of minor oil leaks - 'behind belt cover' (timing 
	chain?), and 'rear of cam housing'.  Are either of these terribly 
	significant?

Aha--you said the magic words! "Timing chain." I know the answer to this
one: make sure the original chain has been replaced. It's supposed to be
done every 30K miles. Otherwise you're apt to be in for Big Bucks one of
these days. I got that advice from everyone I talked to when I was shopping
for a 944. (And wound up with a 951 which I love.)

p.s. BTW, all you automotive mavens on the mailing list, I heard a
brief business news item today about "an American car that's a big
success in Europe: General Motors' Opel." Are the folks at Dow Jones
(they supplied the biz news segment) drinking Drano, or are some Opels
really made over here now? Mine just went back to Germany, ironically
enough.

Uh, I would look further than the 'early' car you've found.  If it's smacked a
wall, the frame is in all likelihood our of kilter.  It can be checked and if
necessary straightened, but you'll pay dearly for it.

The oil leaks can be fixed too.  Very often 944's develop leaking balance shaft
seals.  They can be easily replaced, if I am not mistaken, but not before you've
pulled off the timing belt and a bunch of other stuff.  More money.  However,
your timing belt may need replacement anyways.

I have never heard of Tokiko shocks on a 944.  Most folks I know stick with Koni
or Bilstein.  I have the sport Konis, and they work fine (except when the rears
leak!).

There are a fair number of options available for the car.  Pick up a PCNA '86
Fact Book through a dealer or mail order; it lists all the options and their
codes and prices.  To find out what your prospective Garage Queen has, unpop the
snaps holding down the rear carpet over the spare tire.  On the body wall you
will find a sticker listing the car's build list, ie, all its options.

The early 951's had problems with their exhaust manifolds and port liners, I
believe.  Porsche replaced them for free on demand, but not everyone noticed the
leak and asked.  They have also replaced the fuel hose(s?) on the 951.  If your
has a crimp in the end where it meets the rail (I think), it's an original part
and MUST be replaced.  There is currently a recall campaign for all 944-series
cars: some get the fuel hose, some get the rail.

Other things to look for are the oil/water heat exchanger and the water pump. 
Symptoms of the former's failure are oil in the coolant (looks scummy in the
reservoir) and water in the oil (foam or taffy-coloured goop on the dipstick). 
Symptoms of the water pump include coolant leak, overheating, and noise.  The
exhaust-side motor mount has been upgraded many times (five or six).  Symptoms
include loud, macho growling before you get the revs above 1200-1500 RPM.  The
real test is to measure its height; a bad mount has lost its fluid and
collapsed.

The aftermarket chips of choice are the Autothority version 2.5.  Avoid like the
fiscal plague any kit which drills the recycling valve or shims the waste gate. 
Doing so defeats your DME's ability to protect against overboost, and can mess
up your engine.

To answer one question directly: it's a mistake to buy any car which has been
driven hard when a creampuff can be had for the same or less money.  Last I
checked, dealers weren't interested in paying book (wholesale) for 944-series
cars.  There are so many on the market: many stock brokers find their Porsche's
interior clashes with their new Burger King uniform.  Find yourself one in
better condition.  And by all means have an experienced Porsche mechanic check
it out.

And join the Porsche Club of America!

Hope this helps... Kevin Gross

Jim,

Just to add to Kevin and Patty's good info, another documented 951
gotcha has been the failure of the #2 connecting rod bearing in cars
operated at full throttle for significant periods of time (i.e.,
tracked) running at power outputs above stock via chips.  This problem
is discussed by Bob Strange (B. F. Goodrich test engineer) and Charlie
Learoyd (PCA tech committee member) in the May 1990 issue of Panorama
(page 38).  I doubt that the autocrossing you intend to do with the
car would exacerbate this problem (since you wouldn't be standing on
the gas for long periods), but I just thought someone should mention
it anyway.

If you can get your hands on the February 1990 issue of VW&Porsche
magazine, there is a survey article on the various 951 chips.  The
July 1990 issue of Panorama also contains a good discussion (complete
with an interesting history of Porsche factory-produced chips for the
Turbo Cup series and the famous 300hp "head gasket" chip) on page 61.
The #2 rod bearing problem is mentioned there as well, and the author
(Charlie Learoyd) concurs with Kevin's advice to avoid mucking
mechanically with wastegates and cycling valves (i.e., let the
computers handle the job).  I have not yet bought a chip for my 951,
but if I were to do so I would probably go with the Autothority
product, which I have heard good things about (in addition to Kevin's
recommendation).

My experience with owning an '84 944 and an '86 951 is that oil leaks
and failing water pumps (this is actually a seal problem as well) are
a fact of life with these cars.  My 951 has had an oil leak at the
back of the cam housing for some time now.  Since it doesn't seem to
be causing any problems other than putting a few drops of oil on the
garage floor, I am waiting until it's time to change the cam belt
again, at which point I will pull the housing and replace the gaskets.
I would not, however, similarly delay replacing oil seals on the front
of the engine because of the risk of getting oil on the cam belt.  If
you are planning on doing your own work on the car, you may as well
budget an additional $400 for a belt tensioning tool, since doing damn
near anything on the front of the engine (like resealing the shafts
and installing new water pumps) requires removing the cam and balance
shaft belts.

Good luck in your search for a 951, but don't buy the first one
you see.  There seem to be many good specimens out there for
prices similar to those you quoted.

dorr@crg.llnl.gov

P.S.: If I am correct in concluding from your address that you work
for Microsoft, your boss Bill Gates will surely be pleased by your
decision to upgrade from Mazda to Porsche!  At least yours won't be
locked up in an Oakland warehouse like his 959.

P.P.S.: Perhaps just before you joined the mailing list, there was
considerable discussion about Porsche bitmaps.  Would you happen to
have some .bmp files of Porsches lying around for Windows 3.0?

Subject: Re:  pins for porsche locks sought

You can get these from Porsche, as part of a "lock kit".  I had my
914 re-keyed back to the original when I had my door handles replaced.
I did however have to go to a locksmith to get it done -- apparently
you can't get the pins on a onesie-twosie basis.

I also know that you can get a "re-key the car" kit for 911s, and I'd guess
that there is a similar part for the 914. I even have the 911 part number
laying about somewhere -- I seem to recall that the kit is about $200,
whereas "doing it the hard way"  (i.e. ordering matched parts for all of
the stuff with locks) is about $800.

Try a good locksmith for your lock pins.  If you bring him/her your two locks
and keys, he/she should be able to match them up.  Tumbler pins are a specialty
item; Porsche won't carry them.

car!

Along the same lines, how many people who think they're "buying American" get a
Ford Probe, SHO (Yamaha engine), or one of the other Mazda-built cars?  Or
Chrysler, with all it's great Mitsubishi products?  It's funny how the big three

Message-Id: <00901004162400/0003844665NB2EM@mcimail.com>

Kevin and Milo give great advice!  Last but not least, here's my two cents (plus
tax):

The 86 951 has had two fuel-line related recalls.  One is for one of the hoses
going from the fuel rail through the F/R wheel housing, and the other is a 5"
stub at the front of the rail.  It'd be hard to describe what the fix looks
like; find a local PCA/PCNA person and/or get full records.

The problem with the exhaust is that the solid manifold cracks due to thermal
stress between #1 and #4.  The replacement has an expansion coupling in the #1
pipe.  The ceramic port liners are perfect; there is no problem related to them.

If you run the car on racetracks, you must alter the brakes.  Run with a harder
compound such as Ferodo DS-11, or carbon fiber pads.  Do *NOT* run with stock
pads or you can kiss the front rotors goodbye when you begin driving fast and
hard (they'll be fine at 70% driving but warp as you approach the limit).  You
will also have to change your fluid to a high dry-temperature type, such as
AP-550, available through the mail.  Standard fluids (Castrol DOT 4 LMA) can't
stand the heat; they boil and your pedal goes away.  The addition of a "cool
brake" kit is also a good idea.  It's a system that rams high pressure air into
the rotors.  It's not very good quality and it's expensive ($200), but you
should have it.  Check the cars you're looking at to insure the rotors are OK -
the car should brake smoothly and without shuddering, and the rotors must not
have any radial hairline cracks.

Note that with brake fluid you're looking for a high dry boiling point - the wet
boiling point is insignificant for competition use.  LMA is DOT 4 due to it's
high wet & dry numbers, but AP-550 is DOT 3, since it has a poorer wet boiling
point.  AP-550 is also good for street use.  The wet boiling point doesn't
matter if you bleed the brakes a couple times a year, or before every track
event.

As to the subject of the balance shaft belt and cam belt: the cam belt is
critical to the life of the engine!  Equally important are the pullies that the
belts ride on; Porsche recently issued a service bulletin suggesting replacement
at 45K for the pulley.  These things fail internally and the belt goes limp,
causing extensive internal engine damage.  Have the belt tension checked yearly,
and replace it every 2-4 years along with the pullies (depending on how hard
you'll be driving).

The balance shaft belt is less critical than the cam belt.  If it breaks, the
engine gets rough but that's it.

I've heard of several cases of leaky balance shaft seals and such; this seams to
be a fact of life with these engines.  I've been lucky in that regard, despite
56K miles on an '86, and about 5K track miles.

The oil leak at the back of the cam housing (and probably yours, Milo) is easy
to fix.  Mine and a friend's had that problem.  There are 3 bolts holding the
end-cap on; these are under-torqued by the factory and back out.  Just tighten
them snugly, but not too tight or you'll over-compress the gasket.  If the bolts
are gone, that's a problem too - go buy a new one!  Two of the bolts are easy to
get to but the third's a little trickier.  It's no real problem though.  Nuf
said.

Kevin's comment on the oil/water intercooler is valuable; a lot of those things
failed and were misdiagnosed as blown head gaskets.  It's not hard to get that
fixed.  Same deal with water pumps, a long-standing problem with all water
cooled cars in the world (except Japanese ones...!).

I also endorse the Autothority 2.5 chips, with some caveats.  The Autothority
people tend to experiment carelessly in my opinion; the results can be greatly
reduced engine life.  I've had numerous extended conversions with Auto. people
in person, and have quizzed them on several topics.  Sometimes their responses
were flippant and suggested that they knew exactly what the Whole Deal was,
where Porsche and Bosch were in left field.  Yah, that's why their previous
version of firmware let my engine knock, and the **BAD** drilled cycling valve
idea a few years ago blew many an engine (mine included).

That said, the 2.5 chips are really great, since they include 4 years of
learning from the field testing of earlier versions.  As Kevin said, don't touch
the cycling valve and leave the turbo and wastegate alone!  One nice little
touch is to not use their fixed-size orifice in the vacuum/boost line behind the
air filter housing.  Instead, use a small, high quality valve.  This will give
you complete control over how much boost you get.  I turn mine up for
autocrosses and down for track use.  I limit to 1.8 bar for track and 1.9 for
autocross; this gives around 260 and 270 hp, respectively.  Any higher and
you're running out of safety room on the engine.  A hardware store stocked the
valve I used.

As a side note to engine power increases: Bob Strange told me at Tech Tactics
that the difference in lap time between 247 and 300 hp at Road Atlanta was about
1 second.  Power doesn't gain as much as you'd think; driving on the friction
circle does.

The #2 conrod bearing will die in about 60 track hours.  If you don't replace it
before then, you'll buy an engine.  A guy in CT blew a hole out his block at
Lime Rock because of it.  Absolutely, use Mobil 1 15W-50 oil!  It's very
expensive, but it protects your engine a bit better than conventional oils at
high temperatures and high shear rates (RPM's).  The turbo center bearing will
love you too.

Speaking of the turbocharger, some of them have failed.  One friend had a blade
fall off, and had only 1.2 bar boost.  Another friend had an undetermined
failure, but it still gave him boost.  Mine is whining, making little mechanical
noises, and blows oil into the intake runners and manifold.  If you're about to
purchase a car, pull the intake hose at the throttle plate; look around for oil.
 Also listen for a "distant police siren" when the turbo spools up at low speeds
with the driver's window open.  This sound is distinct from the normal turbo
whistle, but hard to hear.

And of course there's the clutch.  The guide sleeve, an $18 aluminum part, wears
and causes clutch shuddering during engagement.  If it's left uncorrected, the
clutch eventually fails.  Unfortunately, replacing it costs close to $2000 in
labor, and you should replace the clutch at the same time, so add another $1000.
It's possible to save money on parts by finding a discount source, but I
strongly recommend using only factory-blessed parts through the PCNA channels. 
There are many so-called "identical" parts from the same manufacturer, and with
the same part number, that are *not* in fact identical replacement parts.  You
mentioned that the early 951 had this work done; that's a big bonus in my book!

(Note: Clair Motors in West Roxbury, MA gives %15 discount - call Mack in
wholesale parts at 617-323-4600, and mention my name - Jim Selders).

One last item to note is the warranty.  '86 models have a 5/50 warranty on the
engine and drivetrain.  No other year has that.  If you're looking at cars in
the low-mid 40K mile range, you'll still have time left.  This can save your
wallet if those weak '86 parts fall off the car!

I don't know what the market's like in your area, but here in Boston an early
'86 951 would go for more like $17K in average shape.  Deduct for the messed up
front-end of the one car.  $20K is too high.

>From memory, options in 1986 were sport seats, sunroof, sport shocks, LSD,
cruise, metallic paint, forged wheels, rear wiper, central locking, alarm,
extended steering wheel hub, smaller steering wheel, and stereo.  '86's had
transmission coolers and headlamp washers, which became options in '87.  Also,
for cars produced before 9/1/85, there's no CHMSL (third brake light).

Good luck on your purchase.  Feel free to inquire about any other subjects.  If
you'd like a more terse answer, let me know that too!

to the previous owner).  A friend who had a 911 (actually a 64 901) set one
of his torsion bars once and afterwards swore never to do it again.  Is there
some kind of trick to getting them back into place easily?

  Thanks in advance,

Jim,

Thanks for the info on the cam shaft oil leak.  In fact, last weekend
I poked a mirror behind the housing and noticed that one of the end
cap bolts was indeed missing and that the gasket was wet.
Anticipating that this might at least be part of the problem, I
dropped by the Porsche dealer last Monday and purchased a new gasket
(for 79 cents, I think this is the smallest purchase I have ever made
there).  Anyway, I did not rush home to make the repair, probably
because I was not really convinced that all that oil was coming from
the cap, and that I would probably have to replace the gasket under
the cam housing anyway.  Your recognition and confirmation of the
missing bolt problem has reassured me now, and I will be under the
hood soon.

Subject: air-cooled Porsches

I am a new reader of this mailing list.  Is there an archive of previous
postings available for ftping?  Or, if anyone has saved postings
related to air-cooled Porsches, restoration of 356s, please contact me
and let me know.  

It has been about twelve years since I owned my last Porsche (coincidentally, 
my daughter is 12), but I have been out looking, beating the bushes for a 
restorable 356 or pre '75 911.  So far, I am not impressed - there is a lot 
of junk out there, and a lot of speculative prices.  

For example, I have looked at 4 356 C coupes, one for $7k (it runs), two for 
$12k (both were restored 10 yrs ago, and are mechanically fine but need 
repainting and interior work), and a fourth for $20k (condition is similar to 
the $12k cars, better paint).  

The biggest problem with all of them is that they were professionally
restored at some time in the past, and it shows (e.g. paint alligatoring 
due to excess hardener, etc.).

How do these prices compare with other parts of the country?  Would it
be worthwhile to expand my search beyond central California, or is the
market pretty much the same everywhere?

You might find a slightly better deal in LA, but California is 356 Heaven. 
My best advice to you is to join the 356 Registry and buy a car through 
the classifieds in the back. I've seen Pristine 64 and 65 356 C and SC
coupes, with factory sunroof, for $14K through the Registry.

I'm planning on coming along with Kam (kamk@kambo.asd.sgi.com) to check
out your VW parts for $ale this weekend....we can talk more about the
specifics. I'll try to remember to bring a copy of the Registry magazine
so you can check out the prices therein....

O.k. I'll admit to it.  I'm totally confused about a lot of things.

1) Whats a 951?  Sounds like a 944 with a name change.

2) Porsche Club of America?  How do I join?  Whats the point?

3) Autothority -- I'm interested in their chips and need an address.

4) What exactly do you mean by autocross?  I've always been interested
in racing but I have no idea what is involved, etc.

Thanks

I don't follow 356's much, but I believe there's a good following in the
Northeast (PCA Zone 1).  Lots of people in CT, NJ, and MA have fine older cars. 
Contact the 356 Registry too.  PCA has a great guy named John Paterak in
Chatham, NJ, who can talk your ear off about restoration and originality.

Subject: Re: 911 Torsion Bars
Message-Id: <24901004213742/0003844665NB3EM@mcimail.com>

Torsion springs have splines on them, which mate with the car and determine your
ride height.  If one side doesn't match the other's height, then the springs
were put back "off-by-one" tooth (or possibly more than one).  Unless anyone has
a better idea, I think you have to have the shop pull the two errant bars and
install them again, correctly.  Which two are wrong depends on what ride height
you want.

The ride height should be equal at all corners with a full tank of gas and you
sitting in the driver's seat.

The weight on each wheel is set by the car's design.  Raising the corner 1"
doesn't transfer weight; it just raises the car.  The suspension will, however,
be at a different point and have different camber, toe, etc., so this will
affect handling.

Are you measuring the lean with or with the driver in the car?  With a full tank
of gas and correct tire pressures?  A properly set up car will sit a wee bit
tilted when empty, 'cause it's got to be right when you're in the seat.

Adjusting the torsion bars is not very hard. You just have to follow the
Porsche Manual procedures. Level the car, then measure the angle. If they
are off, you will have to pull them out and turn inner to right or outers to left (or opposite) to get the right angle. The inner splines are offset
compared to the outers, therefore you can get them within a few minutes
accurate. You will however have to do an allignment after, as your rear
camber and toe will be off, since you have to remove the bolts to pull
the bars. If they are corroded, sand and paint them and put grease
on the bars when you re-install them. If your springplate bushings show
any wear, I recommend you change them at that time. Use Weltmeister inner and
outer bushings on each side, as you cannot get factory replacements without
buying the springplates. Good luck!

1. '951' is the factory project number for the 944 Turbo.  You'll also find it
stamped on many of the car's parts, as the lead clause in the part number.

2. To join the PCA, call Myra Sutton in Richardson, TX, at 214 690 6205.  She
will hook you up with the closest Region (aka chapter), and send you an
application form and a sample issue of 'Panorama', our national monthly.  Your
local region membership secretary will send you a copy of the region's
newsletter, listing their calendar upcoming events.

3. Autothority numbers:
Sales: 703 323 0919
Service: 703 323 7830
FAX: 703 323 7325

4. An autocross is a driving event, the basic idea of which is to negotiate a
course marked out with pylons as quickly as possible without knocking any pylons
over or out of position.  Cars are grouped into classes of similar performance:
either the car's or the driver's, depending on local convention.  You need a
helmet and you car will be checked for mechanical soundness.  Tons of fun!

1) a 951 is a 944 turbo. 951 is the internal model number

2) PCA is great stuff. You're in the Longhorn Region, and I don't
   have a contact up there, but I know you can call the mechanic 
   I use at (713) 661-6428 and get them to find out who to call
   in Austin to join (they have a subscription to your regional
   newsletter, and do a lot of business with Austonians). You get
   to meet other Porschephiles, you get a really great magazine
   ("Panorama" or "Pano" as it's often called), you get a regional
   newsletter, you get to participate in driving events, and you
   get discounts from a lot of shops. Not bad for $25 a year.

3) Autothority, 3763 Pickett Road, Fairfax, VA 22031 (703) 323-7830

4) autocross or autoX is a form of competition where you drive, a
   car at a time, on a course laid out from rubber traffic cones,
   for best time. It's a gas. Check with your PCA or SCCA club for
   details on when/where. 

   FYI, the Longhorn Region sponsors one of the coolest autoX events
   I've ever heard of -- Little LeMans, the week of the real thing.
   It's a scaled down version of the actual track. I mannaged to miss
   this year's event as I was out of town, but not next time!!

Do you mean to sand and repaint the torsion bars or the bolts?  As I

strength has been compromised.

Yesterday, I was the happiest person I know.  2 weeks ago I bought my dream
car, a 1970 911T in good condition with NO rust.  I love it.  So I finally
get around to taking to get a smog check so I can register it in my name.

Everything seems to go fine, slow but fine, until the printout comes...
FAIL... Max HC(Idle) 500PPM, Tested HC 1380PPM.  Off bu over a factor of
two.  All of my dreams, shot to the ground.  Well, not really.  Anyway,
now I need help on finding the problem.  I'd rather not pay a real mechanic,
I can do minor things myself and would like to keep some money.  The car
backfired a little bit, the compression is good on all of the cylinders and the
timing is near perfect.  Bad spark plugs possibly?  I'm going to change them
tonight.  Any ideas Porschephiles?

Also, I am going to replace the oil return tubes that go from the cam covers
to the engine block, for they be leakin' something terrible.  I plan to use
those nifty expandable kind so I don't have to remove the heads.  Do these
leak often?  Any insight on the use of these nifty replacements?

Subject: 914s

	
	I always always always use 20/50W in air cooled engines. I like Kendall and 

In my 914 I used 15W-40 Valvoline Allfleet(sic?), in an attempt to minimize
the viscosity range. 20W-50 is ok if you seldom drive the car in cold
weather (e.g. below freezing).
	
		
		I am interested in making it a FUN car, and not necessarily an
		all-original car.  I'm excited about it!
	
	Get Bilstein shocks, Yoko tires, the biggest sway bar you can find and
	
I prefer Koni's, but Bilsteins are certianly reasonable. Yokohama makes
a wide range of tires- if you want "boy racer" tires, A008RTUs are
among the best (except for the well known wet weather issue), with the
other candidate being BFG Comp T/A R1. However, for street use many would
find that the additional handling is not worth the terrible lifetime.
If you want a good street tire with a different balance of wear, stick
and wet safety from the boy racer tires, I am not sure that Yokohamas
are the best choice anymore. I would consider Bridgestone RE71s or
Comp-T/A (not the R) as the high cost, high overall performance choices.
Others may want to comment on the "value" choices.
	
I have a strong comment about very stiff sway bars on an otherwise
unmodified 914. The chassis is simply not stiff enough without a roll
cage or at least significant additional stiffening underneath to
support a stiff suspension. The fastest 914s without roll cages
at PCA track events have suspensions near the factory optional setup.
Either buy the factory bars if you can find them, or buy an aftermarket
front bar like the H+H 19 mm, and run it on the softest or near
the softest setting. Dont neglect the back bar, where the factory bar
with the stock springs is the best setup. Another alternative is
to use 140 lb (but not stiffer) rear springs without a bar.

In any case, if you are willing to compromise some wear for handling,
dial in more negative camber, perhaps -1 deg. front and -1.5 deg. rear
or, if you are really gung-ho, perhaps 1.5 deg. front and 2 deg
or even 2.5 deg. in the rear. At the latter setting, the car won't track
very nicely in a straight line.

Speaking of recalls, have there been any for the '84 944 that a second

was recently a recall.  Was this the '86 951 that she might have been

I've had the cam belt replaced twice on my 73k '84 944 but I was recently
warned about the balance belt or the tensioner belts or repacking some bearings
here.  I'm not sure if the last job did this so that's why I was wondering
about the rough running engine.  I know the motor mounts are a problem and they
too have been replaced once.  Might they need it again?

Subject: Racoon repair...


It's time to pull the fan and clean out the racoon and replace
the fan...

Kevin Gross sent me the instructions for pulling the fan
shroud out and that will really help.   I'll probably
p/u the Haynes manual also.  Thanks Kevin.

My mechanic said that around my year, March 1984, 944, the
two fans were going through changes and it was difficult to
pinpoint the correct fan.  Anybody know about this?  I was
figuring on calling...  Performance or Automotion and ordering
the fan.  Will they get it right?  Also the fan shroud assembly
was damaged.  Of course it's not listed but would these vendors
carry it.  Probably not huh?  Where can I get such a part?

While I'm ordering these parts, is there anything else I should
consider for low-rpm improvement that 3rd parties do well?
Also how about lowering the car, sway-bars, special tranny
fluids (synthetic?), windshield wiper blade replacements...

Oh, yea, that reminds me.  My wiper fluid has stopped squirting.
The squirter motor works fine, I pulled it apart and unstuck
it a long while ago.  But now I'm not getting anything out
of the sprayers.  I've replaced the valves but that didn't
help.  The tubes seem clear incl the filter in the bin.
I've cleaned out the sprayer with a thin wire...  Any clues?

Thanks for any info,

[ saga of '70 911T high on the HCs ]

Two suggestions:
1) Advance the timing.  Advance it as far as you're comfy and as far
as you can and still be able to start the car.

2) Crank the idle speed up to the allowable maximum.  I can't figure
out what state you're in from the address, but CA has higher
allowable idle speeds for older cars.  Your local smog station won't
go above the 1150 or whatever it is, but the BAR (Bureau of Auto
Repair (down the street from the Ministry of Love and around the
corner from the Commission for Oral Sex)) will.

Doing these two things will produce more complete combustion in the
cylinder.  Basically, they do the same thing: advance the timing.  It
means that the time between spark and exhaust is a little longer.  It
also means that you'll get more NOx in the exhaust, but '70 cars are
still in the NOx exempt era, and you're gonna retune your car
afterwards, anyway, so it shouldn't matter.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Torsion Bars (Clarified)

  It seems I did not provide enough information, so let me clarify myself...

  I have a '73 911S that leans to the side (ie the right side is lower than
the left).  In fact, the right rear tire will hit rub the inside of the fender
if I hit a nasty pothole.  This lean is noticable just in looking at the rear
of the car.  I had a friend look at it while I was still in the car (add 175
lbs) and it still had a lean.  It seems to lean no matter how much gas is in
the tank.  One day I measured the distance from the fender lip to the ground and
found the right side to be one inch lower in the rear than the left side.

  It did not do this trick until I had all new inner and outer radius arm
bushings installed on both sides.  I assume my mechanic (European Import
Car Repair in Austin) knew what he was doing when he put them on and had
the angle of the radius arms set correctly when they were installed.
However, they have been known to be careless at times (torn transmission
ground strap and a pinched fuel line on my old 914).

   There is no sway bar in the back (yes, I intend to get one _soon_).
However, someone responded that the overall tilt of the car can be
adjusted via the front sway bar.  This sounds like the best option (and
only) option assuming that the radius arms were set correctly to begin with.
Opinion?  Should I break down and have mystery mechanic do it here in 
Durham?

Thanks in advance,
Jeff Shorey

With Porsche torsion bars, you cna be off by much less than one tooth.
They use a "verneer" system, where the number of teeth at one end of
the bar is different than the number at the other. You can meve very
small angles by moving one tooth at one end, and one tooth the other way
at the opposite end. This is part of what makes the whole process 
"interesting".

	
	The ride height should be equal at all corners with a full tank of gas and you

	The weight on each wheel is set by the car's design.  Raising the corner 1"
	doesn't transfer weight; it just raises the car.  The suspension will, however,
	be at a different point and have different camber, toe, etc., so this will
	affect handling.
	
	
Actually, raising one wheel will affect the relative weights. You can't
change the weight on the sum of the front wheels, or the sum on the
left side (and similarly the back and the right side), but you can
change the diagonal ratios. I therefore question the people who claim
to get balance within a few pounds left to right, with an inherently
assymetric car (driver not in center). You can get the back two wheels
equal, or you can get the front two wheels equal, but not both.
I'm sure we can spend megabytes deciding which of the above is preferred
(I try for achieving the same front/back weight ratio on each side of the
car).

When you get the weights right, the ride heights at the four corners
may or may not be uniform. My experience is that usually they are close.

Your observation that ride height changes affect suspension settings like
camber is accurate. Camber then affects relative weights, so it
is very much an iterative process to get the combination of suspension
settings and wheel weights you want.

It definitely sounds like your right side torsion springs are lower than they
should be, and that this happened when your mechanic reinstalled them after
replacing the bushings.  The correct fix is to have them put in properly.

Don't "patch" the problem with the sway bar; this will give you drastically
different handling in right vs. left turns.  It's not the sway bar's function to
level the car!  You'll kill the sway bar's bushings and have a weird handling
vehicle to boot.

If the torsion springs are indeed mounted correctly, then there must be another
problem somewhere.  I suggest you find the *real* problem instead of mucking
around with a pseudo-fix.  Good luck!

Subject: 911 Torsion Bars


OK, forgive me, I have a tendency of posting too rapidly since I
rarely have much time.  THe point I wanted to make is that the ride
height, expecially in older cars, of the fenders is not the thing to
adjust.  It's the weight distribution on the tires.  It may very well
be that Jeffrey's car's problem is that the torsion bar was installed
wrong.  I was merely reacting to what is a common occurrence amongst
911 and 914 owners, since the front is so easy to lower, often you see
people trying to adjust all four corners to the same height.  This is
wrong, although often you get the correct results.

I see a couple responses and they reflect some knowledge of the
issue.  Let me try to give a better explanation, I think my quick shot
was probably too ambiguous, and I don't think I said what I meant.

This is only true of new cars, that is the way they are designed.
Often, as time goes on, uneven wear on the springs may cause slight
differences.  As a result, adjusting the ride height to equality on
all four corners could very well be making the problem worse.

Raising the corner (that is, raising the height of the fender) doesn't
transfer weight, it INCREASES the load on that wheel and on the
diagonally opposite wheel (note - a very common misconception is that
by increasing load on one wheel you decrease load on the diagonally
opposite, but the truth is they BOTH increase).  The "car's design" in
the case of a 911 is for the wheels to have a similar load side to side.

OK, close, but not exactly (It seems like you know the right thing to
do but not why, or perhaps you're having the same problem as I did in
my last posting, not expressing what you mean).  You actually can
change the weight on each wheel.  The easiest way to explain what is
actually a very difficult problem is by thinking of a table resting
evenly on four legs.  If you were to raise one leg, most of the weight
of the table would then be supported by that leg and the diagonal one,
and the table would teeter between the other two.  Thus, raising the
fender (which is really lowering the wheel) will increase the total
weight supported by the diagonal pair of wheels.

Most cars are pretty symmetrical (l-r).  In fact the left-right weight
difference in a 911 with just a driver is under 1%, and with a
passenger is about 4% (that's percent of total car weight), which
isn't that much.  Your method is correct, the proper procedure for
adjusting weight balance is called "corner balancing".  The idea is to
maintain the same ratio of front/back tire weights on each side.  When
this is done, the car no longer "teeters" the way the table would if
you raised one leg.  This teetering is an extremely dangerous
performance characteristic.  Once the ratios are correct, usually the
job is complete, for now the left and right front tires should have
within 20 lbs of weight on them.  If not, then you have the equivalent
of a table with two adjacent legs raised - it won't "teeter", in fact
it will be stable, but it will be tilted.  In this case, you have more weight
on one side than the other.  This isn't bad, and apparently some
people are satisfied with this, but the problem remains that in hard
braking, the lighter side will lock up sooner than the heavier.  To
fix this is really complicated, because while corner balancing can be done
by just adjusting the front torsion bars (which is easy), side to side
balancing requires adjusting all four and it takes an ENOURMOUS amount
of time.   It's much easier to just buy new springs that are fresh.

I personally have corner balanced a few cars, and they've all come out
within 10 lbs right-left difference (w/driver).  That they come out
looking lopsided sometimes is a fact that can be corrected with new
springs, but it's really not necesary.

THis information is from my memory of:
  Carrol Smith's book "Tune to Win" (I think that was the name)
  An article in Pano last year, and one in one of the Upfixen books.
  A phone call with Bruce Anderson.

Generally should have your car realigned after changing the balance.
Obviously if you pull the rear torsion bars you must.

Shit, I already spent a half hour on this - sorry for spelling
mistakes, hope this helps some...

I agree with what you are saying here, but I believe that it agrees with
rather than disputes my hypothesis that without changing the angle of the
table (or car), you cant change the SUM of the weights on any pair of
ADJACENT legs (or wheels), but you can change the sum  of the
diagonals (my previous posting referred to "diagonal ratios", and that
is in fact a poor way to express it).

My experience (911s, 914s, several symetrical and asymetrical race cars)
is that most cars have reasonably symetrical weights without the driver,
since there is not nuch to create assymetry (perhaps the battery, etc).
I'm not aware of any Porsche which has a designed in offset of the
drivetrain. Assuming that is the case, adding a 200# driver (my case)
puts ~100# more on the left side (since the driver doesn't sit directly
over the left wheels). If you use the rule of even left-right ratios,
this would put ~40# extra on the LF and ~60# on the LR, not far from
your 20# value. Others would argue that in a 911, the backs should be
exactly equal, and then the fronts get the whole 100# differential.
A lighter driver would help (no volunteers please!).

	maintain the same ratio of front/back tire weights on each side.  When

I absolutely agree that you want to eliminate "teetering", but in my
experience there is a range of settings which meet that criterion
due to inherent assymetry with a driver in the car.

I think you missed my point. When you align the car, you will (or can)
screw up the weight balance, requiring an iterative procedure. Toe
changes are obviously ok, but camber changes will change the weights somewhat.

Nice piece, Chris.  It was very informative.

I think there might be a misuse of words or definitions that's bothering me in
this dialog.  I'm thinking of my physics classes when you talk about changing a
corner's weight by altering its height.  In the pure sense, this isn't possible
(assuming the car stays fairly close to earth, etc.).

Is what you mean, that when one wheel (for instance) is lower than others, the
dynamic load is greater?  That is intuitively correct to me.  However, the
weight, or static load, remains identical.

For example, if both front wheels hit a speed bump at the same moment, then on
the one that's lower (higher chassis ride height), the spring/shock will begin
resisting the bump shortly before the other front side.  This is because the
diagonal corner's suspension doesn't want to be "teetered" into the ground by
the lowered wheel/raised chassis, so it's doing it's Newtonian thing and pushing
back, thus increasing the force at the lower front wheel.

Hmmmm, now that I think about it, this'll increase the apparent force on that
front wheel even statically.  But it's still due to the diagonal corner fighting
back - the *weight* of the corner is still the same.

Hey, it's Friday night and I'm going to go play with fast cars from Germany!

Well, I've already had both mounts replaced once and it looks like it
may need them again.  I've got receipts, but who can I contact?  I sent
in a "transfered owner registration card" but never got any word on it
from Porsche.  Also, I'm in College Station w/o a real Porsche dealer.
I'll probably have to drive somewhere.  Further, the motor mounts may
need another replacement again anyway.  Since the racoon incident with
my cooling fan, the vibration level of my idling engine has gone up although
I don't know how it could be related.

BTW, is there a relay that is supposed to maintain the idle when the A/C is
running?  My idle drops down when the A/C is turned on.  This is also when the
vibration is the worst.

Marciano should really get a 'kick' out of this one.

This is word of mouth but there is supposedly an article in Dear Abby that
goes something like this (anybody actually read the article?): 


A guy was looking for 911s and found an ad for one for $50 [sic].  He thought
it was a typo but called anyway.  Even if the ad was missing a couple of zeros,
it was still a good deal.  The lady on the other end said that the ad was correct
and that he could come over and test drive the car.

The car was in good shape, ran fine, etc.  This was impossible.  The lady
said that if he wanted it, it was $50.00 and he could drive away.  Of course
he asked how she could sell the car like that.

She simply said, "My husband ran off with his secretary and left me a message
saying, 'Sell the car and the house and send me the money.'"

the pictures i've seen of it hit a sweet spot in my brain.  but of course,
so do the mercedes, jags.

to change the topic, so how would be get some from the factory to get on
this mailing list?  surely, they must have computers, well, general purpose
ones anyway.

any ideas?

Subject: New Porsche Crest for X


Hey PorschePeople,

That Crest is really great!!!  Thanks to whoever brought it on...

But I found it a little too B/W for my poor eyes so I added some
(dithered, so to speak) grey with the bitmap program under X windows.
And here's MY version of it...

	OK, guys, if you're going to tell tall stories about $50 Porsches, 
I've got a *true* story for you. I got my black 1990 911 Carrera 2 Cabrio
for $A50, which is about $US42. That was the price of the ticket in the 
lottery I won! (My wife prefers to tell friends that "one of our investments 
came good").
	The magnitude of my good fortune may not be apparent to US Porsche
owners, so here's some background. Thanks to what you might describe as
extremely aggressive taxing of luxury cars, the list price of this car in 
Australia is $A175000 (say $US140000). Now, I'm not particularly poorly paid
(20 years experience, network manager at a large tertiary education
institution), but this represents something over 6 years of my post-tax income.
Or, it represents around 1.6 times the price of a typical new house and block
of land here in Adelaide, which is a State capital. In other words, it's not
the sort of car that is commonly owned by your average Computer Centre person.
My two Civics and an Accord are more representative of what we see in the car
park. This does mean that new Porsches are very rare, so there is a lot of
"head-turning" value in it!
	I've just (two hours ago) arrived home after the last 800-mile leg of 
a trip to Newcastle (near Sydney) in the car. When I've had some sleep and 
cleaned up 191 new mail messages, I might write an article about the car and 
the trip. In the mean time, Marciano (and "JZ") can quietly grind their teeth!
Perhaps a little teaser: 2200 miles, mostly at 70-80 mph, saw perhaps 6 police 
cars, and of course didn't get booked.

Cool story, Rollo.Ross!  After you sleep a bit, maybe you CAN write a long
version of your winnings and trip, and then send it to Panorama for publication
under the "Personal Porsches" column.  I promise to read it!

Ever been to the F1 race in your city?

Subject: re: air-cooled Porsches

I am happy to report that my search is over.  Thursday I phoned an
auto broker who specializes in classic & muscle cars, and an hour later
he called back with the following description: '64 356 C coupe, 1 owner,
138k miles, always garaged and serviced, complete set of records, engine
rebuilt 6k miles prev., finish and interior in good condition, all
original.  Owned by a dentist in Fresno.  Price $10,300.  It sounded too
good to be true, so Friday I drove over to Fresno (about 3 hrs) to see
the car.  Well, it was love at first sight!  It has some minor faults:
crankshaft pulley seal leaking; engine tin needs repainting.  The finish
looks great from about 15 ft., and the car runs and handles like it should.
The only problem was how to get both cars home.  Currently, my '67 VW
Squareback is sitting in his garage.  I managed to locate a friend who is
going to Fresno on Wednesday, but the Squareback is going to have to sit
outside once it gets home.  May have to build a new garage (or convince
my wife to park her Jetta outside) :-).

On Saturday, JZ came down and helped his friend Kam remove a pick-up load
of VW parts.  I kept one type III engine, but now I have lots of room for
Porsche parts.  Anybody have any 356 engines cluttering up their garages?

I also heard Mercedes has a flat-12 in development.  Maybe they want to do F1
and 750i bashing with it?

Someone in PCNA should be contacted to check into this mailing list idea.  I
have a number in Reno; I'll try it and see if I can generate some interest. 
Anyone have the PC Week issue a few months ago where Windows 3.0 sites were
being polled, and one site was PCNA/Reno?  They gave the name of the director of
computer services, which I'd like.  It was the main cover story.

I know, I know...

I was modeling it after my keychain.  But the curvy top was a little
bit more than I wanted to muck with at 5am...  Next version...

Great stroke of luck there...some of us just had to beg, steal, borrow
and trade in...

However it's not just the Aussies who get stung for porsche prices.
A new 911 Carrera 2 over here in the UK (with a decent option or two) is
between 50K & 55K sterling, or (at an exchange rate of 1.85)
close to the $100,000 range. For a Cabriolet, you can expect to pay
about 7000 pounds more, or $112,000. Being so close to Germany, it is
difficult not to notice that in the transport between Stuttgart and
Porsche Cars Great Britain, the price is hiked by about 15,000 pounds.
You can also expect to wait (even in this market) a year for delivery,
or 18 months upwards for a Carrera 4.

I look forward to the single market in 1992 when I can go into a german
garage & order a UK spec car, import it to the UK myself and 'lose' the
somewhat large Porsche GB profit margin... until then, left hand drive
cars to the UK specification will remain available solely through them.

Still, how can I ever say that my carrera 2 (targa, not cabrio) wasn't
worth the money? :-)

Subject: upgrading stock 944 suspension

Ok, let's say we have this guy who wants to upgrade his stock 944 suspension.
He gets on some Porsche snailmail lists, and he starts getting Porsche
catalogs. Well one of these catalogs has this nice multi-step process
for upgrading suspension. The catalog in question is Performance Products.
Our man takes a gander at the catalog, and here is what he comes up with:

STEP 1: Koni adjustable shocks, 1038Ts for the back at $158.95 per. 1209Ts
	for the front at $96.50 per. Total price of STEP 1: $510.90

STEP 2: 25mm Torsion bars for $241.00 per pair. Stock height 220lbs springs
	for $75.50. Total price of STEP 2: $316.50

STEP 3: Weltmeister sway bars, front 28mm kit $329.50, rear 22mm kit $214.50,
	plus adapter kit since this 944 has no factory rear bar, $68.50.
	Total price of STEP 3: $612.50

Total price of STEPS 1-3: $1439.90 for parts.

So this fellow is wondering, indeed asking the experts out there: Is it worth
it to do this to a 1984 944 with 72000 miles? Remember that this car has
a new set of RE71 tires and alloy 3 piece wheels, the existing shocks are
the originals, and the driver of the car wants to join his friends out on
the local autocross courses.

Also, let's say this guy made some money by selling short in the recent
stock market woes, so money is less of an object, but doing things right
is the object and is very important...

Any friendly advice for this person would be greatly appreciated. I will
be sure to pass the info along to him :-)...

And not just the Aussies and Brits.  Greece has a 117% importation tax
on (all) automobiles.  No, I didn't drop a decimal point: if a
maufacturer charges x for a car, you will pay 2.17*x.  Holy Cow!

Things WILL be changing dramaticaly in '92, and even now, in Athens, you
see few really new cars since everyone is defering their purchase a few
years.

Gee, I guess we're pretty lucky in the U.S., with gas that was (thanks, Saddam)
only US$ 1.30 / gallon for 93 Octane (95 European), and Carrera 4's for $65K. 
We have plenty of new Carrera 2/4 models available.  In fact, they're even being
discounted slightly!

Subject: Re: upgrading stock 944 suspension
Message-Id: <83901010212838/0003844665NB3EM@mcimail.com>

Steve, let me respond to your 944 suspension question more with philosophy than
hard yes/no's.

Porsche does a fairly good job with the suspension design.  In particular, they
choose spring and shock rates that are harmonious.  That is, they work very well
together and are well integrated.  Sometimes it's too soft for what you want,
though, so you wanna spend $$$ to get it firmer/stiffer/faster etc.

There are many, many companies willing to sell you a part to stiffen up things,
but it won't be matched with other components.  What you get is a slightly
faster and firmer car, but without the great factory tuning.  Don't sell them
short in Weissach; they do a lot of work to get things right.

The Koni adjustable shocks are nice.  Adjustablility is good so you can tune
them a bit.  But this is probably jounce rate only, I'd guess.  The rebound is
set by design.  Those two rates determine a shock's characteristics.  You may
also want to consider Porsche OEM sport shocks so you're assured they're matched
well with your spring rates and chassis weight.

The springs will make the car better on smooth surfaces but much less
comfortable on bumpy (i.e., real) roads.  They'll transmit forces into the
chassis faster, which has an effect on chassis, bushing, and trim wear.  You'll
also get less roll with stiffer springs.

The sway bars are, in my opinion, the best deal of the lot: they keep the car
flat, and easy to control and tune, but don't affect the ride or comfort beyond
that.  The '84 needs much more roll stiffness but only a little firmer ride to
my posterior's way of thinking.

Also, have you considered updating the front control arms or rear trailing arms
to the 85 1/2 aluminum ones?  They're lighter and stronger.  The stamped steel
front arms have been known to fatigue and fail.  Some track people around here
have updated the arms purely from the saftey standpoint.  When I changed from my
'83 944 to my '86 951, the suspension was *notably* more compliant and smooth. 
The unsprung weight seems to be down.  Anyway, I thought I'd mention that
because it's a subtle but nice change.

I've heard through the years a couple important messages from people far more
experienced than I, and they seem to be very accurate.  First, making a car
stiffer and spending loads of money on it doesn't get a whole lot back (except
possibly for the very advanced driver).  Second, Porsche does a lot of research
and development on suspensions and has decades of experience tuning race and
street cars.  They know more than we ever will!

Along those lines, I've kept my own modifications very simply and I've been
highly pleased.  My 951 has a totally base suspension except for fat Weltmeister
bars tuned for a slight power-off understeer, power-on neutral attitude.  That
coupled with 225/245 Yokohama A008R's has made a nearly unbeatable combination
of handling.  I love the car set up this way, and I can tune it for different
tires fairly easily.  The bars made every difference, and the car is still
entirely useable on the street.  A friend with basically the same car but a full
lowered, stiffened suspension has a car that's horrible to drive in and squeaks
terribly, plus he's slower on the autocross course!

In summary, what I'm saying here is to repeat what I've heard for years and
seems to make perfect sense: keep the modifications simple and just learn to
drive better.  That's really the key!  Buy or borrow a G-Analyst and get
yourself out on the friction circle, whether it be at .8 or 1.2 G's.  Let me
know what you end up doing and how it works!

My two bits:  Flip #2 and #3, go for the sway bars first.  And if you want to be
competitive at the autocross, get some R-compound sticky tires, like Yoko A008R
or A008RTU, BFG Comp T/A R, Bridgestone RE71R, etc.

Two other recommendations.  First, don't wait for any of the above before
autocrossing.  The one thing which needs the most work and will yield the
biggest improvement in times is the driver.  Get out and enjoy yourself! 
Second, call me next time you have an inspiration regarding the stock market!

Subject: Hi again...

hi - I'm new to this list, BTW...  just bought my '69 912 (red, alloys,
1750 kit, 009 dist., no rust, etc.) an really like it.

I've got a few questions I'd like to ask... (911 guys listen, too)

1. Unless I hear otherwise, I'm considering using Precision Automotive
   as my mechanic (111 N. Myrtle @ Foothill, Monrovia CA  818-358-8194).
   They seem to be pretty knowledgable about older porsche's (I know, a
   REAL old Porsche is one from the 40's or 50's, but still, mine isn't
   BRAND NEW).  Anyone out there deal with them?

2. Mechanic says my Solex's (split shafts BTW) are weeping gas, both down
   the throat and outside.  Is it worth rebuilding them (can I do them
   myself - I've done Strombergs and Holley's before???) or should I
   throw 'em out and buy Webers (manifold or new adaptors - I'd lean
   toward adaptors, else - I'm told - I'd have to pull the engine to
    hook 'em up)??  Mechanic likes Webers - says that when you adjust 'em
   they stay there and don't change.  Are Webers legal for CA smog????

3. Best prices on parts?  I have catalogs from Tweeks, (can't remember the
   rest - about 6 other catalogs came with the car).  Or is it a case of
   "you have to compare each source for each part because they vary"???
   Let me hear about any parts houses who have given you hassles (ie.
   forever backorders, no returns, etc.).

4. Now for the mystery clunk of the month... despite rebuilding the rear
   suspension (and servicing CV's on ONE side only), there is a clunnk in
   the rear end - sort of a back and forth noise: turn left, CLUNK, turn
   left again, no clunk, turn right, CLUNK, right again, no clunk.  Kinda
   like a bowling ball in the trunk.  Someone suggested the axle on the
   unserviced (CV) side is binding, then letting go.  Sometimes I hear
   it on uneven speed bumps (going slow as always) or curbs/driveways.
   Funny, we've tried to make the sound artificially by rocking the car
   sideways, etc., but can't make it happen except when driving it.
   The rear end (the whole car, actually) is really tight - no rattles
   or mysterious sounds of any kind, except for CLUNK.  BTW, it has the
   smallest (forget the size) roll bar in the front, none in the rear.

5. Comments.... we replaced the generator brushes two weekends ago.  The
   lower right brush was a hassle - we disconnected the oil filler and
   filter (are the nuts on the back of the filter bracket SUPPOSED to be
   tack-welded to the housing? mine aren't and they're loose!) and the
   four generator bolts (the ones on the fan housing) and rotated the 
   generator 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then replaced the 2nd
   brush.  90 mins for what we thought would be a 10 minute job (sigh).

I thank you for your help.  I've owned and worked on older vehicles
('69 Triumph GT6+, '72 MGB, '56 GMC pickup), but the 912 is definitely
the most fun.  I've got to change my mindset somewhat - rear engine,
split case, dry sump, air cooled, etc. - but looking forward to it
just the same.

BTW, this is a daily commuter vehicle - 15 miles round trip/day.

Tell your "friend" that all of the parts you listed are good quality
and will make the car handle better. They will also make the car 
significantly stiffer on the street, which some people would find
uncomfortable (but which others either tolerate or like). Several of
the parts you listed can be bought from other aftermarket suppliers
for significantly less money, if you care. If you are going with
that type of setup, you may want to consider the Koni "S" series,
which standf for sport (typically the same or almost the same price,
and the same number followed by an S).

Another variable, and perhaps the one with the most bang for the buck,
is tires. A set of "boy racer" tires like A008RTU or Comp T/A R1
will amaze you (both with their stick and their rapid wear).

More broadly, however, I would suggest that you just go out and drive
some autocrosses or whatever. A stock 944 is a fine car right out of the
box.  Leave it alone and buy seat time, undil you develop some driver
skill in that environment, then fiddle with the car if you want.
If your 944 doesn't have the optional sway bars you might want to consider
that (actually, you said you need the adapter for the Weltmeister rear,
so I assume you don't have the optional bars). Buy a set of stock
optional bars from a Porsche wrecker like Kempton (my recollection on
bars is $85 per end). The car will still be very nice on the street.
Make it a race car later, when you are surer that is what you want.
(or what your "friend" wants- sorry) If you are already sure, dive
in and have fun.

Pete, a 911 owner here had a mystery clunk in the rear end for months.  All
sorts of things were checked.  Turns out it was the wheel bearings, which a
local shop had allegedly replaced twice...

Lateral clunks would seem to indicate CV/halfshaft, bearing, or if things are
really bad, trailing arm problems.

Hey, I'll have to check if I have a rear sway-bar.  Silly as it may
sound, I don't know.  The last time I hit an autocross was two and a
half years ago when I first bought the car!  This sounds like
a nice option for the back.  But what do you mean $85 per end?
Front and back?  I didn't know there were stock fronts.

Do you have a number for Kempton?

A very common cause of clunking, esp when you notice it in cases where
one wheel is loaded, is the trailing arm to spring plate
bushing, I forget what it's called.  There was an article in Pano this
year about replacing it.

I'm new to the list, also.  Perhaps one of the more experienced 356/912 owners
would comment on the use of 009 distributors.  My 356C also has one, but
I understand that it has less advance than the 050 distributor that should
have been on the engine.  What should the timing be set to for the 009?
Should I find an 050 and replace the 009?

You might try tightening the screws on top of the Solexes.  My Zeniths
were leaking, and that solved the problem.  As for rebuilding them, it
primarily depends on the condition of the throttle shaft.  If there is
any appreciable wear, vacuum leaks will cause problems.  As far as
Webers go, be careful - they don't come set up correctly, and need to
be rejetted.  Ask your mechanic for references - find another 356/912
owner that has had the work done by him.  I looked at five 912's when
I was searching for my Porsche, and only one was correctly jetted.
Another problem I seem to recall is that the Webers come with a
smaller venturi than the Solexes, and a performance decrease can
actually result if used as is.  Perhaps someone with more knowledge of
the problem can confirm/deny this.  The owners of the cars that had
Webers said they are legal, but they had to braze a connection for
the oil-breather hose onto the air-cleaner in order to pass smog.  One
owner had a letter from DMV certifying the legality of the swap.

I have heard del'Orto carbs come highly recommended as Solex replacements.

BTW, pulling the engine is relatively simple - you will have to
disconnect fuel and accelerator linkage anyhow - all that remains are
the electrical connections, the cables and ducts for the heater boxes,
possibly the rear pan (sheet metal), the tach cable (or do 912s have an
electronic tach?) and four bolts that attach the engine to the transmission.  
At most, it is an additional 1.5 hours work to pull it and reinstall it.

Buy yourself a Bosch 050 distributor.....the advance curve is much better
for the 356/912 motor. The 009 works, but you'll like the 050 better.....
	
	I've got a few questions I'd like to ask... (911 guys listen, too)
	
	1. (I know, a REAL old Porsche is one from the 40's or 50's,
	    but still, mine isn't BRAND NEW).

Your Porsche is beautiful.....wish I had one....my '61 356 is wonderful, 
but a 912 to drive every day would be too much fun for one human to have....
	
	2. Mechanic says my Solex's (split shafts BTW) are weeping gas, both down
	   the throat and outside.  Is it worth rebuilding them (can I do them
	   myself - I've done Strombergs and Holley's before???) or should I

	   they stay there and don't change.  Are Webers legal for CA smog????

Solexes that weep gas down into the intake can ruin your motor! If an intake
valve happens to be open when you're parked with the gas tank higher than
the carb can fill the combustion chamber with gasoline. Simple physics 
sez you can't compress liguids. So you get a bent rod when you try to 
fire that baby up again....called the "gasoline hammer" effect....

You can probably rebuild them, though old solexes can wear in the throttle
shaft thingie and then rebuilding won't help. I have Weber 40IDF carbs and
adapto-plates and they are indeed wonderful! I think, however, that you 
may have to reinstall those solexes at smog time.....call the BAR or
a referee station for confirmation.....(*DON'T* tell them you're thinking
about keeping two sets, of course...) 
	
You can install the webers without dropping your motor. The adapto-plates
come in various flavors, though....and some are better than others. The
best kind are available from Harry Pellow (408) 727-1864 and Charles
at Guaranteed Import Repair (408) 425-8158. Both will gladly ship to 
your address. I believe Charles maintains lower prices...

	3. Best prices on parts?  I have catalogs from Tweeks, (can't remember the
	   rest - about 6 other catalogs came with the car).  Or is it a case of
	   "you have to compare each source for each part because they vary"???
	   Let me hear about any parts houses who have given you hassles (ie.
	   forever backorders, no returns, etc.).

Buy a copy of VW/Porsche or maybe other mags.....they have ads for exclusively 
Porsche junkyards and such......Also, both Charles and Pellow are good sources
for your parts....

Well, I touched on it in my first reply, but this is essentially the scoop
as I understand it. The 050 has more total advance (like 33 degrees, and the 
022 which was stock [I think] has 35 total degrees) and the advance curve
is more aggressive on the 050 than the 009. 

When timing your porsche, set the timing to 30-35 degrees BTDC at FULL ADVANCE
(i.e. over 3500 rpm) Then check to see where it falls at idle. My 050 gets
33 degrees at full advance and is right at TDC at idle. Works like a 
charm.....

Yes! This is true. I went through several jetting changes on my 356 before
I found the trick-hot setup. Charles (at Guaranteed Import Repair) was
great about providing the jets and helping out in this regard. Pellow 
has firm ideas about the right jets, and he ships the webers with the jets
that he likes for your car....I expect that they are close to or the 
same as the ones I settled on.....(I don't quite remember the numbers,
I'd have to go home and look to check...)

though, I can't confirm/deny this statement except to say that the

Dellortos are almost exact duplicates of the Weber 40IDF, except that they're

Subject: Re:  009 distributor, Solexes, Webers

 Well, my mechanic called me early this morning and told
 me my new throttle switch was in. For those of you who
 aren't familiar with the 914 motors they use a Bosch
 fuel injection system with an electromechanical switch
 triggered by the movement of the throttle plate in the
 throttle body. 

 I was having problems cruising at steady rpms and having
 the ignition/fuel injection drop out for a couple of beats.

 I thought it was the trigger points or the ignition points
 and replaced the distributor, trigger points and put in
 an Allison optical trigger to replace the points (no more
 replacing points every 8000 miles, yeah!!).

 This didn't solve the problem so we took the car for a 
 long test drive and when the glitch occurred my mechanic
 said that he thought it was the throttle switch.

 $76 from VW, $60 from Porsche. Porsche seems consistently
 cheapest for parts for this motor (amazingly enough). Same
 part number, different pricing structure.

 Anyway, pulled the throttle valve assembly (the throttle
 switch is mounted to the bottom of the assembly on a 1.7 
 litre motor) and cleaned it thoroughly and put on a new
 switch. Voila -- no more drop-out.

 But that's not really the reason I'm writing. 

 The car is running very well right now after a complete
 tune-up. I thought it was ok yesterday, now it's great.
 We took the throttle valve assembly and tanked it in 
 solvent, brushed off all the crud, blew out the passageways
 and lubed it.

 I would highly recommend this for any similar motor design.
 My idle went up 400rpm after cleaning the assembly and
 the whole throttle mechanism feels like silk. Very smooth
 and seems much more responsive. No hesitation when I press
 the accelerator and a really smooth motion.

 I think this sort of work is very easy and easily overlooked
 and I wanted to recommend it to at least the other 914
 owners out there. The throttle assembly is often somewhat
 neglected and given its position on the motor it is rarely
 if ever cleaned.

 The whole process of removal and cleaning took perhaps
 1/2 hr.

	 Am I correct in that I can use neither of these distributors

Yes, but I think they make virtually identical models with such

Jim, I've been away for a week so I didn't get a chance to respond.

I always have trouble relating this to physics.  If there were only
two wheels it would be simple, but with four, it becomes a "statically
indeterminant" problem, it is a highly non-linear function and optomizing
the weights is virtually impossible.  Only existing rules of thumb
will work.  The procedure I outlined is one.

> Is what you mean, that when one wheel (for instance) is lower than

First of all, weight is generally "mg" (mass times gravitational
constant), so when I say `weight' of the wheel perhaps I was wrong.  
The car has a weight, which won't change.  Put up on blocks, this
weight is distributed across the car to the four corners in a certain
way, which also can't be changed (well, can't be changed by this
process.  You can put weights there), I'll call this the static weight
distribution.  Note all this applies to a non-moving car only.

In my last msg, I said `weight' for a number of reasons:

- First, weight is often used to refer to the "force pushing down".
When I said weight of the wheel, I meant the downforce exerted by each
wheel on the ground.  Let me call this the static loading on the
wheel.  This is *not* the dynamic load - the dynamic load is a term
usually used to describe the changing load on a wheel while the car is
moving (cornering, aerodynamics, braking, etc).  

- Second, what scales measure is usually called weight.  The static
loading on a wheel can be measured with an ordinary "bathroom" scale,
and when you change the height of one of the front wheels, the reading
on the scale changes.

- Third, the sum of all the scale readings is always constant, and
always adds up to the total weight of the car.

> Hmmmm, now that I think about it, this'll increase the apparent force
> on that front wheel even statically.  But it's still due to the
> diagonal corner fighting back - the *weight* of the corner is still
> the same.

Again, the best way to think about it is a four legged table.  You
obviously can't change the weight of the table by raising one leg, but
you *can* change the distribution of the weight to the legs by raising
one.  Raising one will cause the table to rest on three instead of
four legs, and the weight supported by each leg will change.

In a car, it's far more complex, because raising one corner doesn't
cause another to come completely off the ground.  Also, the static
weight distribution is not constant as it is in the table (at least
the one I was thinking of).  Raising one corner will increase the
amount of static loading on the wheel there (and it's diagonal pair),
meaning a greater percentage of the cars weight is now being supported
by that wheel.  You havn't changed the static weight distribution of
the car, but you have changed the static load on each wheel.  THis can
be seen, as I've said, by putting a scale under each wheel.  Raising
one wheel will increase the scale reading on that wheel and its
opposite, and decrease the scale reading on the other two.  The sum of
the four readings will always remain the same.  [read those last few
sentences a few times if you still have questions, empirical data is
often the proof of the pudding].  There are no springs
fighting back, this is a steady state reading, and it is absolutley a
measure of the portion of the cars weight that wheel is carrying.  The
reason the static load on a wheel can be changed whereas on a table it
can't is because the position of the springs indicate how much they
will support.  If one spring is pushing up more than another, the
counter force (which we all forces have) must be pushing down more.

Well, it's not exact, but things like the oil tank and cooler  are
mounted on the right side just to counter the driver, and I think the
gas tank is designed to carry more on the right..  W/o a driver,
the 911 is definitely heavier on the right side, but by how much I
don't know.  Anyway, the heights can be adjusted so that the two
fronts and two rears are equal, I say this because I've done it.  I
really don't have time to figure out exactly why, but I suppose given
an afternoon and a good enough reason I could write up a free body
diagram and work it out.  Or maybe I could suggest to one of my
colleagues in the physics dept that he put a problem like this on a
test.

Click!  The little bulb above my head just went on!  Thanks for the detailed
explanation of chassis height and "weight" balancing, Chris.

So it really is just the interaction of the four corners that does all this
magic.  Got it.

I have had good experiences with all the major parts discounters who advertise
in Panorama: Imparts, Performance Products, Automotion, Tweaks, etc.  Never a
problem with returns, my fault or theirs.  Imparts tends to be the cheapest, but
their product line is limited.  I believe they do carry carburators.

One often overlooked source of clunking can be the shock absorbers.  Make sure
their bolts are torqued to spec.

You want it?  You got it.

This version includes the taper noticable on my keychain and the

I'm not sure how it will look on the lower res one.

Have fun!

James,

Since I kidded you about the flat top on the last version, I am
morally obligated to congratulate you on this one.  The upper boundary
and Porsche lettering are a bit ragged on my Sun 3/60 screen, but it's
no worse than the unavoidably curved lower boundary.  The extra
"authenticity" more than compensates for the lack of pixels.

Thanks a lot for the crest bitmap, it looks LOTS

Subject: 944 rear glass (hatch)


I have a '84 944 and the rear glass is getting detached from the frame.
I heard that this is a common problem but is there a good solution?
If not, does anyone out there know where I can get a new glass at a
reasonable price.  The dealer wants $1600 just for the part and the 
labor is additional.

Thanks,
Vas Kodali

Vas,

How's the car going?  I've looked back at the old mail and found that we
have been having similar occurrences with our 944s.

I saw your subject headline and my heart started pounding.  That is
a problem with my poor car too.

The big question is:  Has it popped out of the frame?  My '84 has most of its
glue, or whatever it is, separated but it hasn't separated from the metal
lip that covers the whole top of the glass... 


I've seen a 924 turbo (first or second year) with the glass completely out
of the lip.  That's gotta suck.  Be assured, though, the glass will not
fly out because it's bolted in  on the hatch frame a little below the
hatch shocks.  But this would certainly be a sorry thing for our cars to bear.

A while ago this issue was discussed here with no resolution except that
Stan Hanks recommended some action.  I've not hunted down this avenue yet.

	Last week I told you about the 911 Cabrio I won with a $A50 lottery 
ticket, and said that the price of this car here is about $US140000. That was 
at the old sales tax rate for luxury cars of 30%. The current tax rate is 50%, 
pushing the price of my Cabrio to around $US160K! Gives you a warm glow to know
that my government got over $US30000 in taxes on my car - plus whatever they
took in import duties.
	My car is a proper built-for-Australia model, which means it's
virtually the same as the US ones with the exception of the right-hand drive
conversion and any minor engine changes due to emissions requirements. (The
Road and Track test in April listed it at 247 HP; my handbook says 250 HP, so
I'm not sure whether there's actually any difference.) The change to right-hand
drive has been done rather half-heartedly - the instrument panel and steering
column are simply transplanted rather than being reversed, leaving the
passenger inspecting the oil-level gauge rather than the clock, and the driver
trying to operate the gear-shift lever and the turn indicators with the same
hand. Interestingly, the air-conditioning control panel is a mirror-image of
the LHD ones, aided by a cunning symmetry in the holes needed for the
switchgear.
	So what's it like to drive? My first reaction is - it's fantastic! The
performance, whether in traffic or on the open road, is everything you'd 
expect, and it certainly isn't either finicky or prone to spinning wheels if
you're incautious - at least in the dry.
	And the handling? Well, I've been driving moderately-powered 
front-wheel-drive cars for the last 14 years. My instincts are pre-programmed 
to an action of "plant the foot, steer out of trouble, and then analyze what's 
going on" when a cornering crisis occurs. With a car as powerful as the 911, 
I'm sure this could lead me into big trouble. Yeah, I know, "slow in, fast 
out", but something tells me they don't mean "slam on all the power" when they 
say "fast out". So, this is just a long-winded way of saying that I'm still 
working up to exploring the handling limits. I've noticed that the road tests 
of each year's new 911 model say things like "this year's 911 is the 
best-handling yet; it's virtually dispelled the old oversteer spectre of last
year's model". The trouble is, they've been saying that for many years now. I
don't want to find out the expensive way what next year's magazines are going
to say.
	In last week's message to I also mentioned that I'd just returned from 
a quick trip to Newcastle, just north of Sydney on the east coast of Australia 
and about 1650 km (1000 miles) from Adelaide. I used the fast route to 
Newcastle, via Ouyen and Wagga Wagga, going through one corner of Victoria on 
my way from South Australia to New South Wales. (Refer to your atlas, and 
don't be surprised if you can't find Ouyen - population only 1500, but a 
significant junction in north-western Victoria.) The roads are not really
"outback", but neither are they exactly highways. About three-quarters of the
distance is on two-lane bitumen, some of it badly cut up by recent floods and
hurriedly patched. Near the state capitals (Adelaide and Sydney) there are long
stretches of four-lane divided highway to what we'd call freeway standard -
controlled access, and few or no bends worth slowing down for. The speed limit
on these sections, and on most of the two-lane stuff, is 110 km/h (68 mph), but
nobody seems to bother if you use a little more in SA or NSW. I set the cruise
control to about 125 km/h (80 mph) except in Victoria, which has an open-road
limit of 100 km/h and a "lock 'em up and throw away their licence" attitude for
30 km/h over the limit.
	Once away from the cities, driving on these roads is a new experience.
In South Australia and Victoria, the road wanders back and forth for no obvious 
reason across rolling country, punctuated every 50 km or so by a signpost
announcing that you've arrived at places with names like "Linga" or "Walpeup".
Most of these are nothing more than railway sidings with road access to the 
silos used to hold wheat during the harvesting season. Further on, near Hay in 
New South Wales, it's sheep and cattle country, and you're likely to come
across a drover with horse or motor-bike (and caravan with TV antenna!) moving
a few thousand animals along the road, presumably on his way to the stockyards
where he'll sell them. In a bad season, when drought affects the properties,
some farmers resort to using "the long paddock" - the strip of land beside the
road, taking advantage of the grass growing in the meagre rainfall runoff from
the road surface. In the daytime, you encounter these animals spread across the
road, making it necessary to stop and wait for them to move across. At night,
they're generally held behind temporary fencing, leaving you to worry about the
occasional animal that may have escaped and is chewing its cud in the middle of
the road.
	Night driving in this area has another hazard. Kangaroos come out of
the bush around dusk, and graze along the roadside or snooze in the middle of
the road till late in the evening. Their dark fur makes them hard to see in the
dark, they jump unpredictably when frightened, and they make an awful mess of a
car if you hit them at speed. The trail of roo corpses by the side of the road
showed that they had been active the previous few nights; I chose to spend the
night in a motel rather than risk bending some expensive bodywork. If a mere
raccoon can do the engine damage reported in an earlier message, I reckon a
fully-grown roo could take out a lot of bodywork on the way through to the
engine. 
	Incidentally, risk of such surprises and the low traffic density leads
to an interesting adaptation of high-beam etiquette. You spend most of your
time with high beam on, and many cars (and all the semis) have a pair of 100W
or 130W driving lights as well. Dropping to low beam when you first see an
oncoming vehicle leaves you almost blind on an unlit and poorly-marked road,
and you may have to drive another 2-3 km before you actually meet him. What
the semi drivers and more experienced night travellers do is to leave the
lights on high beam until the other driver's lights bother you. As soon as one 
driver dips, so does the other. This means you both get the benefit of high
beam for as long as possible. If things go wrong (for example, one driver was 
on low beam when you first see each other), a quick flash gets you back in 
step. 
	Continuing our trip, two-thirds of the way across, around Narrandera,
you encounter the start of the Great Dividing Range, the mountain range that
runs down the east coast of Australia. Here it is merely hilly country, but it
does mean that you encounter traffic, mainly semis, straining to get up steep
climbs. On the two-lane roads, this sometime means waiting for an opportunity
to pass. Such opportunities are a lot easier to find in the 911 than I'm used
to!
	Soon we join the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Sydney, which carries 
a lot more traffic and has had a lot more money spent on it. It's mostly 
four-lane divided road, very smooth, and suitable for much higher speeds.
Unfortunately, it carries a lot more traffic, so it's wise to stick with the 
traffic flow and "dawdle" into Sydney at around 120 km/h (75 mph). Once in 
Sydney, we average about 40 km/h (25 mph) through the suburbs until the start
of the Newcastle Expressway, which is to my eyes a stunning piece of 
engineering - some huge excavations to get a fast 4- and 6-lane highway 
through mountainous country. 
	And so we arrive in Newcastle after 16 hours of driving time, an 
average speed of 102 km/h (64 mph) with a fuel consumption of 9.7 litres/100km.
(Sorry, I haven't got a conversion factor for US gallons, but I can tell you
it's 29 mpg Imperial.) Fuel was a problem; there's a stretch of 700 km (440
miles) where we couldn't find hi-octane unleaded, but with careful planning
there's no need to resort to ordinary unleaded. The fuel gauge didn't help
though - several times it dropped to empty after less than a tenth of a
tankful, only to recover after a few hundred kilometres, leaving the fuel
warning light on and the needle pointing to full!
	A recent test of the 911 by an Australian car magazine claimed it was
"hyper-impractical" for Australian conditions - bumpy, uncomfortable, and so
on. I can only report that it was no more uncomfortable than my 1987
Civic; a stiff suspension, certainly, but the larger wheels seemed to give a 
better ride through potholes. On the trip I found the performance, well, more 
than adequate. My usual passing technique of "select the right gear, keep the 
foot flat until you're ahead of the passee, then smoothly return to your own 
lane" had to be modified somewhat - it's all too easy to arrive at 160 km/h 
(100 mph) before starting the "smooth return" phase. 
	I'm more than happy with my $50 Cabrio; it seems petty to complain 
about the number of faults it had when delivered. But after owning four 
Hondas, I was surprised to find so many things wrong with this "quality" car 
when it was delivered: cruise control not working, two-inch long threads
hanging from the stitching in the roof, trim bolts falling out in the boot, 
the rear lights and red "Porsche" panel showing widespread crazing and 
condensation inside, ignition interference in the cassette player, and the 
fuel gauge problems. The local Porsche dealer has fixed or is fixing the 
problems I've reported so far, so I guess I haven't much cause for complaint. 
	My only remaining problem is that I can't really justify driving 
around in a car worth more than my house. (Or so my wife tells me.) When the 
used Porsche market has followed the increase in prices of new models, we'll 
probably be selling this one and buying a house and a more reasonably-priced 
car. Who knows - it may even be a Porsche!

Vas -

If the glass is undamaged, there is no need I can see for replacing it.  It
probably needs to be disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled with fresh adhesive.
This is apparently quite a bit of work.  Jim Selders had his rear glass replaced
not too long ago; ask him what the parts and labour were.

I have been told by a knowledgeable friend of one common source of squeaks and
rattles from the rear.  There is a less than ideal mating between the glass and
the top fixture/trim.  He found one temporary cure was to wedge thin pieces of
cardboard between the glass and the trim around the top edge.  The cardboard he
used was the wrapper that single-edge razor blades come in.  This worked fine
for a while, until the pressure of the wedged cardboard pushed the fixture
further apart, and the rattle returned.  This after PCNA replaced the hatch once
in attempt to cure the rattle.  Both he and PCNA have given up!

Another source of rattling is the cone-headed bolts which lock the hatch down. 
They can be adjusted with a 13 mm. wrench.  You can judge which side is rattling
by pushing down on the spoiler with the hatch closed, looking for audible travel
(so to speak).  Loosen one or both bolts, and depending on whether the hatch is
currently rattling or sticking, turn it a quarter turn at a try in the
appropriate direction, then retighten.  For those of us who drive our 944's all
year, this is a seasonal adjustment which must be made to compensate for average
ambient temperature!

There is after-market glass available for some if not all Porsche applications. 
One friend has considered using US-made glass for his 930's front window because
of its hardness.  German glass, we are told, is softer and therefore more prone
to chipping and pitting.  Anyone know whether 944 glass can be had?

Vas, I just had a rear glass installed after a break-in.  It came to just over
$2000 - $1692 for the glass ('86 w/ 3rd brake light stuff) and the rest in labor
and a $45 plug where the wiper goes.

I've never heard of this problem; It's certainly not common in my experience.  I
have no experience with this sort of thing.

Talk to a local shop that's done 944 hatches before.  If the glass isn't broken,
there's no reason it can't be re-bonded to the frame.  It's all just glue, if
I'm correct.

Rollo, I really enjoyed the story of your cross-Austrailian trip!  It gave me
strong images of what you must've seen.

As to the comments about a few things not working on your 964: I've too heard
that the fuel senders are flaky, and I've seen several cars with rear lights
cracked.  Must be something about stress in shipping or production that makes
the little suckers break.  Sounds like your car didn't get a good roadtest by
the delivering agent, or they would've found the defective cruise.

Have you noticed the tube taking warm air from the engine to the rear lights? 
They must've found that the double lenses fog up, so they actually run warmed
air into the left side light assembly to dry it!

Subject: CAR COVERS!!!



Just a short note to reiterate my third and most valuable deterrent in
car destruction...

To put it clearly, I love my car cover.  It makes me feel so good to know
that not only will the burglar find it an extra step towards getting in
but, it hides all the contents, protects it from the sun, makes my shiny red
car a grey blob, makes it difficult to ticket (for those with parking permits
because the officers don't like to look under it, at least at my school),
keeps it clean and shiny for weeks longer, makes parking easier on the
conscience (door dings chipping the paint just don't happen), reduces
the probability of keying, pisses off tow-trucks (which doubles as another
really nasty way to steal cars), AND can serve as a blanket if it gets 

cold one morning waiting for the ski-lifts to open and you're freezing...

It's definitely worth the investiment.  It takes me less than a minute to
put it on or take it off.  And even a junky one is better than none (quite
unlike the running parts :-)

So there's my yen on the subject...

	James (and porschephiles) -

	Breaking in thru the huge expanse of rear hatch glass is
a new one on me.  My Porsche (944, followed by 944S) has been broken 
into 3X over the past 5 years.  Each time it was thru the driver's side
glass - twice by bashing the driver's side back seat window glass, once 
by bashing in the entire driver's side (front seat) window glass.
Each break-in was for different reasons: CDs were stolen (hope they 
like my taste in tunes!), once the car was simply searched for goodies. 

	Here's what I've done to prevent theft of *contents* (break-in):

	1) I have since installed a *removable* stereo
	   ... since the last break-in provided me with an opportunity to, 
	   ahem, reconsider my choice of stereos.  I have had a nice CD/stereo 
	   player, and since the head unit was stolen the last time my car was 
	   in for repair (!), I thought it wise to remove a visible 
	   enticement to break in.  Likewise,

	2) I keep my CDs (and valuables!) out of sight
	   in a case *in the trunk* (in one of the two "saddle bags") 
	   when I'm parked.  I used to keep CDs in a black nylon case 
	   behind the front seat - that I thought matched my black interior 
	   well enough to be unobtrusive. But, last January, someone relieve 
	   me of them on a snowy night (along with my window glass), and I 
	   spent a long, cold drive reconsidering that decision.

	3) I carefullly select my parking place.
	   Try to select someplace that is out in the open, to present some
	   risk to a potential thief.  (I don't know how much this helps,
	   as the car has been "properly parked" every time the car has been 
	   looted.  Perhaps this has deterred some additional other thieves, 
	   but I don't know).

	4) factory alarm 
	   This has helped to frighten away at least one thief, and prevent 
	   theft of the stereo or additional items in the car.
	   I have considered additional devices, like a fuel cut-off 
	   to prevent theft of the car itself.


	NOTE: Do not *avoid* making claims for theft of vandalism to your 
	insurance agent for fear of increasing your premium.  Your auto 
	insurance will cover all acts of vandalism or theft under your 
	Comprehensive coverage (minus your Comp deductible), and will not 
	affect your premium (at least for my coverage with State Farm; 
	check your agent or policy).  My agent called this a "non-chargeable 
	claim."


	Any other ideas?

	"Out in the open" can be a mixed blessing! When in Sydney (in a lesser 
vehicle) last March, I chose to park my car in an open well-lit car park 
visible from my room, rather than in the dark basement car park. Late the 
next afternoon, a hailstorm struck that area of Sydney. Newspaper headlines 
described the hailstones as "the size of tennis balls", and had photos to back 
it up. My car suffered over $A4000 damage. The one fun bit was filling out the
box on the insurance claim form that said "How many other vehicles were
involved in the incident?". I wrote "30000, according to newspaper reports".

	Still, this is the only time I've had any sort of damage (beyond
parking lot paint chips) to a parked car, and I've been driving for 25 years.
I've also never been broken into. I guess there are some advantages to living 
out here where the more extreme forms of "civilization" haven't spread yet.

To: porschephiles@bcm.tmc.edu

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL0]

Can someone recommend a *specific* tool and/or method for bleeding
the brakes on my '74 914 2.0?  The Haynes says there is only one
bleeder nipple on each rear caliper.  Not true.  Both have two.  Do
I need to bleed from both nipples on all wheels?  My 'One-man brake
bleed tool' really sucks - the hose pops off the nipple before the
one-way valve lets brake fluid out... If I hold the hose on the
nipple, part of the tool falls apart...

symptom: first press of brake pedal goes to floor, little or no
braking action... second and subsequent presses lead to resistance
and braking action (very good braking action, actually).

Tired of squirting brake fluid all over the garage...

 Well, we live in the same area so let me recommend
 my mechanic (Ralph Foglein, who owns European
 Auto Works in Mountain View, 966-8866). I let him
 do the bleeding with a power brake bleeder. Works
 very well, takes 1/2 hr of his time (less than $30)
 and you've got the great system. Bleeds all four
 at once (I think).

 I normally do all my own work on brakes but it 
 just wasn't worth it to me to do the 914. Sorry my
 answer doesn't have a magic solution.

 Let me recommend the Weltmeister backing material
 for your brake pads. I put some on this morning
 (and tightened my sway bar, and tightened my front
 wheel bearings) and my brakes are magically quiet.

 No more oversteer either. Car handles like a dream
 with the tighter swaybar.

As Rollo knows, I'm afraid I can't report the same.  I have a bright
red 944 which seems to attract low-life.  Here is the litany (over
four and a half years):

Spray-painted the driver's side with white paint
Stolen the badge (this one is expected)
Smashed the windscreen and A pillar with a brick
Slashed the tyres
Scratched the fender with coin/key/nail (who knows which?)

and that's all I care to remember right now...  sigh

I bought a bleed tool also, but it was horrible.  I threw it away, finally.  I
just get another person to help.  It might be worth spending $$$ for a power
machine, if they're only $100-$200.

I don't know about your brakes specifically, but 2 bleed valves means, yes, you
have to bleed both.  Just get some aquarium tubing and dump into a sealable
bottle.  You really need two people.

Do you have 2 piston calipers?  If so, that explains two bleed valves.

P.S. - don't overtorque the bleed valves; they'll snap off and then you'll be
sorry!

I agree with what Jim Selders wrote.  The best set-up is a piece of clear hose,
a wrench, a catch-bottle, and a friendly third foot.  For the latter bit, I have
even managed to press my wife and a teenage neighbour into service at different
times, with excellent results.

I use a simple homemade pressure bleeding system. Find a spare brake
reservoir cap at a swap meet (or buy one), drill a hole in the top,
and insert a tire valve and stem. I used the type for mag wheels which
is metal, has rubber gaskets, and srcews on. The technique is to replace
the regular cap with this one while bleeding, and apply about 20 PSI of
air pressure to the tire valve. I use an air chuck which clips onto the
tire valve (gas stations use them for setting the bead when mounting tires).
If you have a compressor, just set the regulator to 20 PSI. You could
also use an air tank, such as the converted Freon bottles. Be careful
not to apply much more than 20 PSI or so, or you can make a real mess.

Once you have the top of the reservoir pressurized, just go to each
wheel, hook up a piece of tubing, and open the bleeder nipple.
Do all of the nipples you can find, but the ones which get most air out
are (not surprisingly) on the top of the caliper. This works very well
for me, on a variety of cars, including 914s. The only concern is that
it is very easy to bleed a lot of fluid through, so you can easily
run the reservoir dry (which means you have to start over). Check the
reservoir often. Good luck.

Hey Frank, I like your method of compressing the brake fluid resevoir!  Just
like the expensive systems, but cheap.  I don't think 944 resevoir caps seal
well though; mine always spills fluid during spirited driving, even with a
gasket installed.  It has to be able to draw air in to displace the dropping
fluid level, which accounts for the small leak.  I also have the level sensing
float in the cap - maybe if I get another cap from a car without the float...

I found a tool that seems to work about a year ago, but I can't remember
who makess it (I found it in one of those auto discount stores in the
HELP section).  What this thing is is a hose where one end goes over the
nipple and the other end is a one-way valve (using a ball bearing).  The
hose was rather long, so I cut it down to about 5 inches so on each nipple
I could refill it with fluid so to speak.

James (et al),

Do you put your car cover on just when you're going to be parked
for several hours or what?

Since I don't have a full-time job (I'm self-employed), I'm not
usually one place for hours at a time, so it seems like a hassle
to cover and uncover the car. I also only tend to do it on sunny
days, since I've looked at the cover more as sun protection than
as vandalism protection. What do you (and other folks) recommend
in this regard?

I did read something about using unleaded gas in older Porsches.  I think Bruce
Anderson wrote it.  If I remember correctly, the real risk is to the valves
and/or their seats.  Apparently Porsche valves/seats have always been
constructed of a hard enough materials that unlead fuels are OK.  With the
advent of unleaded fuels, other manufacturers started using similar materials.

I might expect that your car's time would require some adjustment with a lower
octane fuel.  So you might be trading off a bit of performance against holed
pistons.  There must be someone out there who can speak more convincingly to
this point!

Patty,

A number of things come into play when I'm deciding whether to put the
car cover on or not:  Time of day, length of stay, weather conditions,
location.

If the sun is shining, I like to put it on no matter what.  If I'm 

planning on staying longer than an hour, I like to put it on.
If I'm in an unfamiliar place but don't fear for my life then
I'll put it on (if it's too dangerous, it's better to drive off
in a keyed car then get mugged while trying to uncover your unkeyed
car.)

It's just a matter of getting in a routine of doing it a little more often
than you're inclined to do it.  Forgive the analogy but... it's sort

Subject: 914 tire sizes


 I'm thinking of replacing my current Yoko A403s (195/50x15)
 with A008RTUs (205/50x15) on my alloy 5.5" rims. Can
 anyone making a convincing argument for a better tire
 (or one almost as good but one size bigger)? I would love
 to fit a 225/50 (they don't make a 215/50 do they?) if
 someone knows of one that will fit my rims and wheel
 wells.

 Of course, I've got the standard offset and all that,
 nothing fancy. Perini alloys.

If you are talking about the air-cooled engines, I think I can
comment with some confidence:

The heat transfer picture in the engine depends on a number of factors,
amoung which are the enthalpy of vaporization of the fuel and the flame-
front propagation rate, as well as the fuel combustion efficiency.

These characteristics of modern unleaded fuels can be quite different from
the equivalent characteristics of the high-test leaded fuels your engine
was designed to run on if it was built before about 1973 (I think). A
VW/Porsche mechanic told me that they get about a degree (C) of engine
temperature decrease per octane point increase, and recommended
that high octane fuel should be used to prevent thermally induced stress
from cracking the block at the studs.

I was curious about some of the same questions as Patty.  Do folks

about rain?  In Texas, there are long stretches of time where the

while I take it off (although the later actually bothers me less).

What do you folks do?

Imparts sells a brake bleeding tool which is quite excellent.
I have used mine a lot and it works nicely.
It creates a vacuum and collects the fluid of each caliper in a
little plastic container. The tool is fairly inexpensive, I think
$39 or so, and works really good. Snap on sells a very similar one.
It costs a lot more so. It has however one advantage. The imparts tool
requires that you have pretty big hands, as the pump levers are big
and spread apart pretty far. The snap-on tool is much handier, yet much
more expensive and they both do the same job. The tool kit from imparts
includes a vacuum pump complete with gauge, the brake fluid collecting
container, hoses and tons of different adapters for different sizes and
kinds of bleed valves. It further comes with a nice case and a nice
manual for vacuum trouble shooting.

I noticed that one hose from my vacuum advance/retard unit goes nowhere.
There is one hose that follows a circuitous route to the throttle body.

Appartments, yes! (many many hours, jealous tenants?!?).

Wet car covers, (I'm in Texas too!) depending on if you *think*
it will be dry by the time you get back.

And, try to keep the cover clean by turning it inside out,
hosing it off, inverting it again, and letting it dry 

(hosing off the car in between steps).  Or, you supposedly
can put it in a washing machine also.

Subject: Oil *pressure* gauge


Jim, Kevin, anybody...

Question...  Da Da Da Duuuuuh (with appropriate timing:  one-ti-ta-two... )

Lately my 84 944 oil pressure gauge has been sitting comfortably at 5 with
little drop except during a lull in my idle when I pull my foot off the 

pedal after gassing it a little.  I think my idle is tuned a little high
but even when the Tach shows approx 820rpm, the pressure doesn't drop.
I've got the dipstick reading halfway-between from the bottom to top
of the flattened portion.  The car normally, in hot weather would drop
down to about 3 or 4 and I haven't seen my temp gauge go above the
first temperature tick (even with only one fan) but it still seems
strange.  It's *not* completely PEGGED against the (appropriately named)
peg but it's so close.  It makes me wonder if my sender is getting
iffy.  Or my gauge getting sticky.  I *do* need to change my Mobil 1
ASAP but that wouldn't be a problem would it?  I shudder to think...

Any ideas?

 I've also found that replacing cracked and worn
 vaccuum hoses and elbows is a cheap thing to do
 and means a smoother idle (mine is very smooth 
 now). I run a can of Techroline through the 
 motor every four or five tankfulls. Further,
 I'm running these nifty new three-electrode
 platinum plugs in combination with an Allison
 optical trigger ignition. 

 I would consider pulling your distributor if
 I were you and checking, cleaning and possibly
 replacing the trigger points. Lube everything
 again (may not have been done for a while on
 your motor).

go on a '74 914 2.0.

Well, it's supposed to be the same as my '73 2.0, and my dist has two of
different sizes.  The larger one is routed 'under' the distributor and
around to the rear of the throttle body, and the smaller one goes to the
front of the throttle body.  Seems weird, but that's the way it goes.

thanks,
  -Robert Merithew

Logically is easier (it has been about 17 yrs since I worked on these): the
connection to the throttle body should be the advance hose.  I believe that
it responds to vacuum just prior to the throttle plate (if the engine is
under load, and a large volume of air is passing through the venturi, then
vacuum would be relatively high at this location.  If the car is idling or
decelerating, then vacuum would be relatively low at this location).

The other connection is probably direct to the intake manifold or intake
air distributor.  It is located after the throttle body, and is intended
to provide a source of vacuum which is high when the car is decelerating.
The vacuum retard line should be connected to it.

If the vacuum retard is not connected, then you have a vacuum leak which
contributes to poor idling performance.

914s are very sensitive to vacuum leaks.  There are a number of steps you
can take to prevent problems, however.  Here are some things you might want
to look for:

  1.  make sure that all vacuum hoses are in good condition and connected.  Look
      at the ends of the hoses for any small cracks in the rubber.  Sometimes
      cutting off 1/2" solves the problem, but it is a good idea to get some
      spare vacuum advance hose.

  2.  make sure that the crankcase is tight: the O-ring in the oil filler should
      be in good condition, the valve cover gaskets should be installed properly,
      the pcv hoses should be in good condition.

  3.  check the distributor operation: remove the cap, rotor, and dust cover,
      and apply vacuum to the advance and retard lines to the distributor, one
      at a time (I use my mouth, but there are hand operated vacuum pumps
      that you can get for this).  Watch the plate that the points are on,
      and make sure that the advance and retard are working.  It is very
      common for the diaphragms to start leaking, which provides a vacuum 
      leak and prevents proper operation of the distributor.  If the advance
      works, but it sticks or seems difficult, dissassemble the distributor
      and reassemble after cleaning and adding some silicone grease to the 
      bearing surfaces.

  4.  check the hoses between the intake manifolds and air distributor.  There
      are four of these, about 2 inches long and about  1.5 inches in diameter.

Another problem area is the injector seals.  Each injector has a seal at the
tip (a rubber donut about 1/2 inch in diameter).  You have to pull the injectors
to inspect them, but if you haven't replaced your fuel hose recently, you can
head off some future maintenance (and prevent the possibility of an engine fire)
by doing both operations at the same time.

Subject: Engine: what is it?


I have an engine in my garage. It came my way as a "porsche engine".
Basically I have run out of garage space, so I want to pass it on
to someone who can use it.

"zursch@sgi.com" says it sounds like a 914 engine, so he doesn't
want it.

"sai@sun.corp.com" says it sounds like a VW squareback engine. Maybe so.

Here's the description. Can anyone identify it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4 cylinder Porsche engine. No manifolds or carbs. All position related
commentary is relative to a driver sitting in the driver's seat.
Comparative notes are relative to 4-cyl VW Beetle engine.

Oil cooler top left, mounted between the two cylinders. Oil pressure
sensor top right rear corner of oil cooler.

Low, slick-looking fan housing. Fan mounted on rear end of crankshaft.
Heater outlets on sides of fan "shroud". Fan shroud top is shorter than
oil filler, and it does not touch the ground on the bottom (engine resting
on the ground). Serial # on fan shroud: 311.119.225C. I did not see any
other serial numbers on the engine. Where should I look?

The distributor drive, fuel pump, and oil filler have the familiar side-
by-side orientation at the rear end of the block, just in front of
the fan housing, dist. drive left, fuel pump middle left, oil filler
middle right. Fuel pump looks a lot like a Bug pump, but with a plastic
dome over the top.

Clutch looks OK, missing 1 tensioning bolt.

3 ball T throttle linkage, horizontal mounting on mast forward of fuel pump.

Flywheel looks like a 180mm.

It is a type III VW engine, pre '67.  The 311 part number, the location

Subject: lifting wheels


 I've found that while cornering really hard 
 I can lift the inside rear wheel. I wonder
 what I can do to compensate for this.

 I've got a 19mm Weltmeister front sway bar,
 22mm Weltmeister front torsion bars, 930
 tie rods, Koni gas adjustable front
 shocks, 150lb rear shocks with KYB shocks,
 195/50x15 Yoko A403s on 5.5" Pedrini alloys.

 I thought that adding a rear sway bar would
 cause that inside rear to lift. But I don't
 have one. 

 So any suggestions?

Hi, netters...

I just went through a painful time getting my '69 912 smogged:

* throttle positioner was missing
* distributor replaced with Bosch 009 (hence no vacuum advance)
* carbs out of whack
* non-stock exhaust (Bursch)

...what I want to know is, to avenge my loss of power:

* what (if any) Weber/Dellorto/?? carbs are CA smog legal??
* what (if any other than stock) distributors are CA smog legal?

Subject: Random tachometer

   Here's a strange problem that I have been having that maybe one of you
out there has had some experience with.  Shortly after buying my '73 911, the
tachometer started reading _twice_ the actual RPM at idle.  I have rewired
the engine wiring harness dealing with ignition, and checked the circuit all
the way up to the tachometer.
   The problem seems not to occur when the car is first started (ie cold), but
on occasion it will.
   I've noticed the early cars without the CD ignition have what is called a
ballast resistor...I haven't tried it, but would something of that nature
help without degrading the ignition?

   Along the same general lines, does anyone know anything about a Bosch
W3CS spark plug?  My car has them (since 85 according to the records), but
the gap on them is _huge_.  I have not been able to find a reference to them
in any of my catalogs, and am wondering whether they are even platinum.  They
don't have the pointy electrode that I have seen on other platinum plugs, so
I wonder...

- Jeff Shorey

PS - thanks for all the torsion bar info...it was cake to adjust, and the
car handles _much_ better.

Hoo boy......the voice crying in the wilderness...saying "How can I make 
my car smog legal and still have it be worth driving?" 

The simple answer is, you can't have it be smog legal and get decent
performance. 

Now, this is not to say that you can't have decent performance at the 
same emission levels, but you can't be *legal*. 

The reason is that that law is written so that you must only use absolute
stock parts to be legal. I believe that this was designed to take older
cars off the road as parts become harder to find and put you in a new
Ford Escort or something....

So nothing but old Zeniths or Solexes are legal. Nothing but the Bosch
Vacuum Advance unit that came stock is legal, no aftermarket anything
anywhere is legal. 

So you get to do what thousands of other people do.....which is to keep
all the smog stuff around and put it on at smog time. 

Or you can make an appointment at a "referee" station and plead that the
older stuff is all worn out and replacements are either No Longer Available
or prohibitively expensive. ($300 will do it...) Then the referee makes sure 
that your emissions are not too egregious and gives you a sticker saying that 
motor number ###########-####### is exempt from that portion of the law that
says you gotta be bone stock .

It's a screwed law. It should be that if you pass, you pass, and if you
don't pass, *then* they check to see if you're stock.....but that's not
how the legislature works.....recto-cranial inversion.....

This is what I thought, too, but when I was looking for a used car to
buy I looked into it.  I ended up phoning the ARB, who said that there is
no dollar limit which allows you to replace required smog equipment with
non-approved smog equipment.  Further, there are no approved replacements 
for Solexes.  The only way around it would be if the Solexes were no longer 
available.  Since they are still available (at a cost of $1000/pair?), Webers 
are not legal.

I asked "what if the Solexes are worn out?". Then, for a '69 car, if
you have already spent $50 trying to get the car smogged, you
can go to a referee station, who can give you permission to use the
worn out Solexes, but cannot give you permission to use new Webers!

The $300 limit comes into play for later model cars.  Apparently the
referee station can require owners of such cars to purchase new smog
equipment to replace worn equipment, if the cost does not exceed $300.

I had heard from a friend who moved to LA with a big block Olds 
that had some pretty seriously non-stock equipment on it that if
you could prove that it would cost more than $250 or so to make your
car comply with the smog check, that they  would give you some sort
of "hardship waiver". Anyone know anything about this??

Down here in Houston, the check is a good deal less strict. I hear that
in Dallas, which just started the smog check stuff, that there is a huge
black market for fake smog inspection stickers. A raid the other day
neted about 1500 stickers and about $65,000 in cash. Wierd.

  Also, I might be possible to take it to a smog place that is ignorant of 
the vehicle that you are having tested.  When they ask if you have modified 
the car, say no.  This happened to me with my squareback last year.  I 
brought it in to be smogged at a shop that was unaware of my car and it 
passed.  It wasn't until I had the car in a VW shop later that year that they 
told me about it not being smog legal even though it passed.  You see the 
previous owner had a radical cam and webers put in the car.  I can't change 
the cam every time I want to test it.  By the way, if the car is pre-'67 then 
you only have to pass once when you purchase the car.  Mine is a '67 so I 
have to test it like everyone else.  Good luck.

Subject: E Production Racer

Well, fellow Porsche Enthusiasts, I went out and did it. 

I bought a 1962 356 Coupe. A real ugly one with primer all 
over and a roached interior. 

The goal (and you can mark my progress on this as I go) is to 
put it on the track around late '91 or early '92 as an E-Production
class road racing car. 

Basically, it's going to involve stripping, painting, and fixing 
all the bodywork (which is in better shape than my street 356), 
renewing the brakes and motor, and putting in all the safety gear. 

Should be a nice project, I think. I've got a head start, in that 
a lot of things are missing from it that I'd just have to remove anyway....
Indeed, that's why I'm considering this project. The car was cheap ($3k) 
and I think I can afford the rest....if I eat bread and water for the
next year. 

Any suggestions or offers of sponsorship will be gleefully accepted.

Actually, the booklet I got from the DMV says that '65 model year foreign
cars have to be smogged when they change owners and never otherwise...but
that '66 and later have to be smogged eveyr two years and when they 
change owners. 

Just for the amusement of the group, here is a segment of a book I'm working
on about living with old VWs in the 90s. Comments are appreciated, of course...


* The Wonderful Intelligent California Smog Law:


Since 90% of the crummy Volkswagens left alive in the world live in California,
we have to deal with the wonderful California Smog Law. So you probably 
want to know what the smog law is, right? Well, it's like this, it doesn't 
matter what the law is because each individual smog station is a little
law unto itself. Technically, your car must have all the engine parts 
just as it came from the factory. 

The amount and complexity of smog gear goes up exponentially as your car 
gets newer. By 1974, there are exhaust gas recirculation systems, vacuum
retard as well as advance on the distributor, and a host of other bizarre
little devices. Add this to the fact that most mechanics in your neighborhood
garage are not experts on the various changes that have gone on in the 
smog gear of every car on the road down through the years and you have the
makings for a pretty chaotic smog inspection system. A quick note, 1974
California cars have a different muffler and intake manifold ......if you
have a 1974, be prepared to pay up to $100 for a new muffler. Ouch! 

But the clincher on smog is this. No matter what you do or what is connected
to what, the inspection still consists of a guy looking at your car 
and deciding if everything is hooked up correctly and then checking 
your car's emissions with a little machine. The Law prevents them from
hooking up the little machine and checking to see if your car passes
the test if they don't think everything is hooked up correctly. I have
taken totally legal VWs to the various smog stations and been assured
by an "expert mechanic" that I needed to hook up the carb warm air intake
into the heater box to make it legal. This is blatantly absolutely 
postively wrong and I told the guy so and showed him why, but he didn't
believe me. I changed it, because I needed a certificate and he wasn't
going to give it to me until I did it his way. Every smog dude is a petty
tyrant, and gives or witholds those precious little certificates as they 
please.

I've also taken cars in with tubes randomly plugged on to every  tube 
mounting point, had the guys give it a look and then they merrily wrote
the certificate. The bottom line is this: Volksies almost always can pass
the smog check if they are reasonably stock. The big killers are
high-performance camshafts and super-huge carburetors. But there is no
difference between a mechanical advance distributor and a vacuum assist
distributor at the smog check, except that they won't write you a certificate
with one and they will write it with the other. 

So get your car smog legal as best as you can and get down to your local
station. If they say you have to run a tube from your windshield washer 
bottle to your right front headlight to pass, go ahead and do it. These 
guys are the ones who sign the certificates and that's really all that
matters. If things really don't seem quite right with what they want, 
try a different one....that's the beauty of this confused situation, since
every one does it their own way, sooner or later, you'll find one that 
does it *your* way. (provided your way is reasonable.)

There is a cut off point that you will want to know about if you intend
to modify your car "for off road use only" with parts that "may never
be used on a pollution controlled vehicle." (in my estimation, about 75%
of VWs on the road are not smog legal.) California currently requires
that smog checks be performed every other year on cars of model year
1966 and newer. I've gotten several different stories from the DMV
(where each clerk also does things their own way) but I think the
prevailing view is that 1965 cars have to get a smog certificate 
when they change owners but only then, and 1964 and older cars never
need smog certificates. The rules are different for American cars,
but this is about Volkswagens, right? 

So if you decide to make your car go faster than the factory intended
and faster than the department of motor vehicles wants you to go, you
have some choices to make. If your car is a '64 or older, do whatever
you want! If your car is a 1965, you can get it smogged once and then
go to town on the improvements, but if you have a 1966 or later car,
you are going to have to get it smogged every other year until
we elect politicians with brains. (and we all know when that will be...) 
You can make it so that with a few hours of work, you can replace the carbs
and distributor and all the tubes and wires with the stock stuff and go 
get your certificate, or you can keep a spare engine around that's all
smogged up and ready to go. (this is a little more difficult, and really
unnecessary unless your real motor has a high-performance cam and other
goodies under the cooling tin. 

One more note about smog. You are allowed to upgrade to later equipment. 
The way it works is thus, if your car is a 1970, you must have 1970 smog 
gear on it. If you have *more* smog gear, you're OK, you just can't have 
*less* smog gear. So if you have bought a car and had three separate smog
guys charge you $40 a pop to tell you that "ain't no way this baby's gonna
pass unless you let me put a new-rebuilt $700 motor in it" you can start
cruising the parts sections of the advertiser for someone parting out a 
similar volksie to yours and go buy the complete, hopefully smog legal
motor for $75 or so. It may not run well, but it's better than letting
the service station overcharge you and keep your nifty go-fast motor
(as a "core") while he puts *his* $75 cruddy motor in your car.....A central
truth....the smog guys *always* get smog certificates when they want, because
they write them!

If the whole smog thing is a real tragedy, you may have to take the car to a 
mechanic and get it put into reasonable shape. If you have to do this,
make sure you ask for all your old parts back! I guarantee you your car
will not run well after being smogged. You may find you want to sell these
parts for something approaching market value, or put them back on. 

Conversely, if you have a smog legal car and are planning to modify it, don't
throw those stock parts away! They are worth their weight in new go-fast
parts because you, me and every other volksie owner needs them to get those
damned smog certificates! So sell them at the swap meet, keep them in your
garage, or mail them to me, but don't let them go to the dump! The best
route is to keep them in a box, because when you sell the car, you are legally
responsible for ensuring that it is smog legal. So save the future owner a
world of hassle and hang on to those parts!

Jeez, I'm staying in Massachusetts!  Here, they check your emissions and if
you're under the limit, you're OK.  It's illegal to tamper but they don't check.
In fact, most inspection stations will do everything they can for you to help
you pass (idle, mixture, etc.).  Some friendlier stations may accidentally
insert the test probe into the wrong car...

I concur.  The attendant at the station where I inspected my 914/6 didn't
bother checking anything.  Anything.  Now, the car old enough that there
aren't any emissions requirements for it, but he didn't check anything at
all.  Not headlights, brakes, directionals, backup-lights, handbrake, horn,
wipers, nothing.  I even had a crack in the windsheild.  Sheesh.

The '3' in the spark plug number you have indicates heat range.  The heat range
depends on exactly what kind of '73 911 you have.  According to Bruce Anderson's
'Porsche 911 Performance Handbook,' it breaks down as follows for the '73 cars:

        911T W235P21/W5DP, gapped to .6mm
        911E W265P21/W3DP2 gapped to .55 mm
        911S W265P21/W3DP2 gapped to .55 mm

Performance Products carries them.  If they haven't been changed or gapped in
five years, you're long overdue for a fresh set!

Hopes this helps.

Subject: RE: Tach and Plugs

  Replacing the points fixed the tachometer doubling problem.  It seems that
even though my car has mechanical injection, it uses the points for the CIS
cars since mine was made in 05/73 (at least that is what it says on the door).

   In reference to the plugs, Bruce Anderson says they are Bosch silvers, which
makes sense since they don't say platinum on them.  Note they are W3CS plugs,
not W3DP.  The gap on them is around .8mm (my plug gapper disappeared when I
moved to NC - all I have is a metric feeler up to .5).  This seems to be a
bit large - also reinforced by the fact that they are caked with dry black
soot.  The car has also started popping into the intake on a couple of the
cylinders at idle recently - probably because of the plugs, now that the
ignition is almost entirely renewed - hopefully not because of the injection.
Balancing the idle air bypass screws seems to have no effect, although the
popping is less likely to occur with the air filter apparatus installed.
   The only place I have found that sells the things (at least from Pano and
catalogs) is Performance Products (aka Performance Pricing).  Does anyone
have the gap specs on these particular plugs?  Bruce suggested that they be
set to .3mm - I am assuming that he is talking about the plugs and not the
points, which are also .3mm.  Is there a less expensive place to get these
things (PP's are around $6)?

Thanks in advance,

-Jeff Shorey

Off the top of my head, the 935 *might* have that arrangement, and the 956 / new
962C do. But the 956/962 heads are water cooled.  If you want an air cooled DOHC
motor, you're talking about a non-911 motor I believe.

Subject: DOHC 4v 911 heads


I'm sure the 959 had 4vpc, and I thought it was a standard 911 block,
but I don't remember the details.  I'm sure 959 heads would be real
cheap, maybe you could get a pair.

real cheap?  I think they only made 200 of them.
The 959 has water cooled, DOHC, 4valve/cyl heads, but I
have been informed that the bolts that secure the head to the block
are 6mm farther apart than the 911 bolts.

Question for the enlightened:  I have first-hand experience with torsion
bars problems with 914's.  Torsion bars must be protected by having them
painted, coated with grease, and with good bushings, or a little scratch
will cause the bars to rust and break within days.  The question is, how
is it that coil springs can be mounted relatively out in the open, where
rocks and salt and other hazards can get at them, but they don't seem to
break the same way?  Don't coils use similar principles as torsion bars?

Sorry I didn't put smilies, I thought it was obvious enough sarcasm
that it wouldn't cause confusion...

I didn't remember the water cooled aspect of the 959, though, guess
that pretty much rules it out.  SOunds like you have more information
than I do.

Coils and torsion bars operate on the same priciple, but in effect operate on
the steel in different ways.  This is based on geometry and the principle axis
that is being strained.  Strain is the amount of deformation that one puts
into the steel, usually expressed as inches per inch.  This is a measured
parameter and is usually intsrumented with strain gages.  The implied part of
the equation (to find the force applied) is buried in the geometry of the part
you are measuring the strain in.  To calibrate it is done either by measuring
the part, and calculating the strain for a given load (from stress) or by
emperically loading the part and measuring the strain directly (a good
experimentalist will do both, just for a reality check).  But back to coils
and torsion bars.
 
Coils work on bending the steel from one shape to another, there is some
twisting but it is inconsequential compared to the bending of the unstressed
shape.  A torsion bar works by twisting.  This implies that the maximum strain
occurs at the surface and the minimum strain occurs in the center of the area
moment of inertia (another topic).  Bending causes a strain at the outside
edges as well. but here the area that is under maximum strain is very small in
area, a compressive area and a tension area.  As both these areas are small
and move in relation to the amount of compression the coil is under it is much
more difficult to damage a coil with a ding or scratch than it is with a
torsion bar.  There is another mitigating reason as well.  The strain for a
given load in a coil with the correct spring constant (k in engineering) is
much lower than the the same load with the correct `k' in a torsion bar.  This
means the stress at the surface of the torsion bar is inherently higher.
 
Why torsion bars instead of coils in the first place?  Volume.  A torsion bar
isn't very big, volume wise, compared to a coil to do the same job.
 
As for the question about the water cooled 4 valve heads, they were first used
on the 935/78.  And there are lots of these heads around, but they aren't
cheap (relatively speaking).
 
just my opinion...

Nobody knows how many 959's were made!  I've heard that the original count of
200 was raised to 224.  And if you crash one, as what's-his-name 962 driver did
in Germany, they'll build another body for you.

Yah, I'll bet they have lots of extra 959 DOHC heads sitting around at Werks I.

Well, some spring principals are the same and some are different.  Coil springs
have some torsional load on them, but it's not as great as an axial torsion
spring [any physics types care to elaborate?].

A greater question is what material and grade is being used on your torsion bar,
and is it hollow or solid?  Sounds like low grade steel to me.  I've had
Weltmeister bars on for 3+ years and there's nothing but dirt on them.  They
don't rust.  At least you get good quality materials for the bucks they charge!

Subject: wrong throttle body on my 914 ?

Date: Fri, 26 Oct 90 1:21:25 PDT
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL0]

1974 porsche 914 2.0l (orig. sold in CA)

I recently asked where the two vaccuum hoses from my distributor
advance/retard unit were supposed to connect.  A few people said that
a medium-sized hose goes under the distributor and around to the back
of the throttle body (near the idle adjust screw) and that a smaller
hose goes directly from the distributor to the front of the throttle
body.  One person said the small hose is supposed to go nowhere.  A
dealer seemed to think that both hoses go to the throttle body as
above.

That's all fine and dandy, but my throttle body only has one connection
on it!  It's the one near the idle screw (big hose).  I really don't see
a place where the other hose could connect.  One person said that if the
little hose were not connected, I would see hesitation coming off idle.
That's exactly what I see with this car.

Could someone with a 2.0l 914 look at the part number on their
throttle body (mine is easy to see - no parts need to be moved from
the engine) and compare it with the number on mine?  Could you
describe where the second hose connection is on yours if you have
one?

Throttle Body:  039 133 067

Is this from a different engine without vaccuum retard?

I have a Haynes for this car and investigated getting the factory
service manual (the one for my Audi was about $45) and discovered
that the 914 manual is an 8 volume set that costs over $300.  Sigh.

thanks,
  -Robert

Are the ~$300 factory manuals worth the cost and are model specific?

Engine_ which has instructions directed to 914's.  It has the best engine
removal description I have seen (the Heinous-I-Mean-Haynes 914 manual tells
you to remove all the FI components when dropping the engine - this one
gives you the correct way to do it).
  I have never rebuilt a 914 engine, but after reading the book I would have
had no qualms doing it.

Subject: Koni shock help <- I need it (914)
Cc: autox@hoosier.utah.edu


 Hi guys,


 I could use some expert advice. I'm trying
 to decide which shock/spring package to put 
 on the rear of my 914 (which will shortly
 be autocrossed).

 I appear to have three choices:

   #1    Koni gas rebound-adjustable shocks          ~$250
   #2    Koni gas rebound-adjustable sport shocks    ~$250
         (approximately 30% heavier compression
         damping than #1)
   #3    Koni hydraulic rebound and compression
         adjustable rear shocks                      ~$600

         all would be accompanied by the
         sport spring kit (150lb springs with
         adjustable perches)                         ~$250

 Apparently, the hydraulic double-adjustables are
 available through Koni Racing after a six week
 or so wait (anyone know a shop that _might_
 be stocking them right now?).

 So, I'm leaning toward the sport shocks with the
 spring kit (total cost about $500).

 Can anyone think of where I can get a better price
 (on #1, #2, or #3) or a better availability of the 
 hydraulic shocks (#3)?

 Any help would be appreciated as the bucks are
 burning a hole in my pocket and my KYBs a whole
 in my *ss.

 Stefan

Hello

I have a question for the collective wisdom of the mailing list.  This
is a trivial thing but its driving me NUTS!  I replaced the front Targa
top clips on my 911 with the aftermarket ones available from Hoptner
Products (advertise in Pano).  These are great.  My stock ones would
not hold the top anymore, but now it is air and water tight to a
fault.  However, now that it is tight it SQUEAKS!  I have put various
lubricating emollients everywhere I could think of to no avail.  Has
anyone else ever had (or preferably solved) this problem.  My car is
getting to the point where it's pretty right and now its little things
like this which are driving me crazy.  

P.S.

I could use a new windshield seal, but I don't really think this is
the problem... perhaps I'm wrong.

P.P.S.

I spent most of the summer removing a bad alarm and stereo from my 1980
SC Targa and replacing with nice stuff installed in a (if I do say so
myself) super clean manner.  This also involved reupholstering the
doors and recarpeting the interior.  I got interior parts from Autos
International in Solana Beach CA (highly recommended).  If anyone is
interested in hearing about my experiences in this area, please E-Mail,
I won't overload the whole list with tales of solder and carpet cement
otherwise.  --

Robert Merithew asks:
    Could someone with a 2.0l 914 look at the part number on their

     039 133 067

Well, as some of you know, I've been parting out my 2.0 914, so I looked
at my part #, and it's exactly the same as the one Robert quoted.
This one has TWO hose connections.  Then I dug through some of my fuel
system stuff I got at a swap meet, and found my other throttle body in
there, and it also has this exact same part #, but only ONE hose connection.
When you put them side by side, you can tell the castings are the same,
and where the hose connections are there is a sort of raised circular
plateau where they can either drill a hole and weld these connections
or not.  The one with only one connection is either from a 74 2.0 engine
or a whatever year 1.7l engine, which are the cars that I got the pieces
from (in a box).  My advice to you, since these throttle bodies aren't
exactly wear items that you can get easily, is to drill the other hole
yourself, if you can find a metal tube to accept the hose.

Bruce,

I've generally solved interior plastic-to-plastic squeaks with silicone spray
lube, this in a 944-series car.  The biggest offender has been the sun roof's
pop-up wind deflector, where it inserts into the removeable sun roof.  Other
folks have solved similar squeaks where the A-pillar's interior meets the dash.

Silicone seems to last reasonably long.  Since it's not greasy, it doesn't catch
and hold bits of grit (like a grease would).  Nor does it bleed or wick out.  I
reapply it whenever I have the sunroof out for cleaning, which turns out to be
about once a year.  I "mask" the spraying with a couple of drop cloths; no
reason to get silicon all over the interior.

Hope this helps.  I would be interested in hearing what you've tried.  Where
exactly is the squeak coming from?

I have a question for the wisdom of this group.

In driving over an "open deck bridge" - it is a steel deck that is open through,
my 944 seems to wander.  Any ideas of what may be the problem or is it no
problem at all, just the issue of the tires and suspension on this
type of road surface?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: 911 Timing Cover Gaskets

   I replaced the timing cover gaskets  on my 911 this weekend, and thought
I would relate some of my experiences to anyone else wanting to do the same
thing to their car.

  The reason I decided to replace them in the first place was because I
previously had had a hole in my exhaust which blew directly onto the base
of the right timing cover and evidently toasted the gasket.  Every time the
car got hot and was parked it would drip a little puddle of oil onto the
floor, which stopped after the engine had cooled down sufficiently.  This oil
blew onto the heat exchanger when driving, resulting in the standard 914
"cooking-up-ribs-in-the-back" syndrome.

   To get the the blasted thing, you have to remove the back license plate
panel, the exhaust, the sheet metal on the rear of the engine, and your
AC mounting bracket if you have one.

   I had purchased a timing cover kit which included the lock nuts, gaskets,
and washers.  I got it for around $8, half the price of Tweeks or anybody else
at one of the local Porsche shops in Durham.

   Here's the kicker of the article: you must scrap every little piece of old
gasket off of the chain box and timing cover.  I left a piece that was almost
imperceptible to the fingertips around one of the lower studs.  Evidently a
previous mechanic had injected orange RTV into just the bottom portion of the
gasket to try to get it to stop leaking, causing the gasket to stick and
requiring it to be scraped off.  Leaving this fragment on the chain box caused
oil to _stream_ out of the box when the engine was turned on, no matter
how tight the nuts were tightened.  Overtightening the nuts was another bad
idea - the soft washers flattened out and essentially stuffed themselves down
the holes for the studs, making it a bitch to get the cover back off and
making it necessary to pick the remains off the stud once the cover was
removed.

   So, after learning all of these little tidbits, I got the cover back on
and now the engine leaks not a single bit of oil.  Quite a change from the
914 where no matter what you do, you still have a rolling Valdez.

Probably no problem. Do you have snows on it? (or all weather radials)
They seem to exhibit this behavior more strongly than the "pseudo-slicks"
(A008, A008R) that I run in the summer. Actually anything with real
tread will "grab a line" here and there, and the lines run every which
way on that kind of surface. Another "complication" about such bridges
is the when wet they offer close to zero traction. Wheel-spin at 1/4
throttle in third.

If you are worried about your alignment, though, get it checked.

Joe, your 944 wandering on a mesh-screen bridge deck is normal.  All those
little ridges nibble at your wide front tires and make it track terribly.  The
problem is exacerbated if your front toe is 0 or toe-out; it should be slightly
toe-in.

Well, there are two ways your Targa top can squeak.  First, two surfaces can
move relative to one another at an interface, and second, the top itself can be
stressed and emit noise.

I'd expect that your problem is the former.  If so, it's a matter of locating
all interface points (i.e., any place one part touches another) and lubricating
it.  This may only work for as long as the lubricant wants to stick around, then
your noise will return.

Have someone drive your car while you move around locating the sound source. 
Then stop and examine things to find the nasty spot!

Good luck!

Sometimes Porsche revises a part and appends a "rev number" to it.  There should
be a two-digit rev after the number to indicate this.  Your cast intake parts
may not show it, but if you go to a dealer and look at the book, it'll probably
be an -01 or greater number.

Sometimes the revision is just to improve a part, and it remains compatible with
the old part.  In other cases, the rev'ed part is entirely different and cannot
be retrofitted.

For example, my 944 hood struts got rev'ed once and it entailed coloring the
strut rods black and improving the bottom mount point slightly - totally
compatible.  But the front brake rotors also have a -01 rev number, but that's
for the negative offset front end; the -00 and -01 rotors are entirely different
things!  I guess this means that if they ever change the -00 rotors, they have a
problem with the part numbers...

Your story reaffirms how important it is to clean all old gasket material from
mating flat surfaces.  It sounds like you went through a lot of work to solve
such a little problem!  Must've been frustrating, though educational.

Subject: Interesting Dr. Porsche quote


	Hiya Porschephiles,

	I have had these quotes on my wall for a while now. Though you
might enjoy them. (these are quoted without permission from Porsche marketing
stuff)


"Life itself is a race, marked by a start, and a finish. It is what we learn 
during the race, and how we apply it, that determines whether our participation
has had particular value. If we learn from each success, and each failure, and
improve ourselves through this process, then, at the end, we will have
fullfilled our potential and performed well."
							 Dr. Porsche

"Committees are, by nature, timid. They are based on the premise of safety
in numbers; content to survive inconspicously, rather than take risks and move
independently ahead. Without independence, without the freedom for new ideas
to be tried, to fail, and to ultimately succeed, the world will not move
ahead, but live in fear of its own potential."
							Dr. Porsche



	See ya, Alex

I'm posting this long musing to the whole list because I think it
will have fairly general interest.  The Porschephiles list is not that
active so I think bandwidth is available.  If someone wants to scold
me for excessive posting - go ahead, I can take it.

Ah let's see, where to begin...

I decided that I wanted 1976 or later because of the new body style and
zinc coating to reduce rust.  I have read and heard alot about problems
with '76 and '77 models.  Perhaps more so in CA versions.  Five bladed
cooling fan, magnesium engine cases, thermal reactor system all have a
bad reputation.  Read Bruce Andersons 911 Performance handbook.  The
3.0 engine which came on line in '78 is really the way to go.  He raves
about their strength and longevity.  I would have taken any good car in
years '78 to '8whatever based upon cost.  I didn't want red - I
definitely wanted a Targa.  I live in San Diego so I was reading all
San Diego sources of information and the Los Angeles Times as well.  On
any given weekend there were probably three or fewer cars that came
close to the above criteria.

I looked for about three months, sometimes I think perhaps I should
have looked longer but I wanted the car and I was using alot of time
looking, test driving, and daydreaming.  I looked at probably ten cars
in the area including LA and Orange County and probably rejected three
times that many over the phone.  I finally paid $18K for the car ($1.5K
off asking price).  That is a decent but not particularly good price.
It would have been better had the car been in the condition that I have
since brought it to.  To give an idea of what I have done to get it up to
what I begin to consider Prosche standards since I've had it I've (note
that I'm kind of a fanatic):

1.  Had the Targa top interior redone ($85.00).

2.  Replaced scads of minor interior, exterior and engine pieces
including getting proper plug wires ($300-500).

3.  Added new style hydraulic chain tensioners (1980 already has the
new larger chain idler wheels - a plus) and did alot of clean up
rerouting, cable tying, hose replacing in the engine compartment.
($350.00 or so).

4.  Replaced brake lines and leaking master cylinder ($150.00).

5.  Replaced Targa bar seal ($130.00).

6.  Front spoiler repainted with ding resistant paint ($200.00).

7.  Replaced non-functional and funky alarm system ($250.00).

8.  Replaced barely functional and funky stereo system (obviously
discretionary) ($600.00).

9.  Replaced all interior carpeting and door panels (consequence of
earlier stereo installation), rebuilt and recovered door pockets,
miscelaneous interior work ($500.00).

10.  Tune-up, valve adjust and replace all fluids ($100.00).

11.  New voltage regulator.

12.  Found and replaced missing jack, inflator and tool kit (don't
overlook these) ($275.00).

I've probably missed some things; the point is that if the car isn't
perfect, alot of money can go into getting it there.  Note that of
course, this includes parts only.  There are literally hundreds of
hours of my labor which would have to be paid for if you or whoever
isn't mechanically adept.  Of course, I enjoy working on automobiles
and so this is a plus rather than a minus for me, although even for
a fanatic, it has consumed alot of my time over the past eight months.
In spite of all the above, note that before I did any of it, I jumped
in the car after only an oil change and took a 1000 mile trip up the
coast to San Francisco, drove through driving rain (alot) and started
easily in probably 10 degree temperatures in the Sierra Foothills;
these cars are an order of magnitude better and more reliable than
practically anything on the road (remember this is a 10 year old
vehicle).

Other lessons learned:

1.  Know the market, research the cars, take your time looking.

2.  Take your time looking, research the cars, know the market.

3.  Subscribe to Panorama and consider cars from outside of your local
area; I see what look to be alot of good buys, although flying to the
car, financing across state lines and emission regulations (far more of
a consideration to a Californian) make this difficult.

4.  I bought a car without alot of documentation.  I know cars pretty
well, and it sounded fine and it ran very strong, the compression test
was good.  Even so, I should have probably gotten additional expert advice
although overall I feel I made a decent buy.  Its probably worthwhile
to try and get the "perfect one-owner cream-puff with a receipt for
every light bulb replaced since new" but it is difficult.

5.  Look out for battery area corrosion.  Mine has just a touch and
I've spent alot of time cleaning and fighting it.

6.  All the ususal advice about checking for straightness of body
panels, matching numbers, looking for strange paint mismatches, etc.,
read all the books on buying used cars, be especially careful if the
car has been painted.  (If you can't tell, you probably should have
help looking for your car).  The paint on my car is decent but has minor
flaws and this is one area that is *very* expensive to bring up to
standards.  New paint is also, of course, a sign of potential previous
abuse/damage.

7.  Be *very* careful around dealers, "exotic car specialty resellers",
and semi-professional Porsche restorer/sellers.

8.  Insurance is not as bad as everyone makes out, but it is not an
inconsequential expense, check first.

10.  If you can, establish a good relationship with a local shop/parts
seller even if you do your own work.  Alan Johnson Racing here in S.D.
has been very helpful; if you buy alot of parts ask for and expect a
discount.  The Porsche parts network is wonderful, every tiny screw,
nut and plastic thingamagig is available and usually readily (for a
price).

11.  Drive as many as you can if you're not familiar with 911's.  They
have a feel all their own (wonderful!).  Get to know what the clutch,
transmission, steering, power are like when they're right and when
they're not.

12.  Engine parts are expensive: one mechanic advised me to get a good
engine and compromise on body and interior if necessary, this is what
I guess I basically did (I hope).

I still expect to:

1.  Replace the clutch someday (ref: Bruce Anderson 911 Perf Hdbk).

2.  Perhaps repaint someday (after the payments have stopped).

3.  New trunk carpet.

Don't be put off by all of the above.  Porsches are finely made and in
my limited experience and research very reliable.  Mine is absolutely
a joy to own and drive!  There is no substitute!

Probably because Porsche the company is quite different from Porsche the man. 

I think the greatest things come from one person's vision. Many people may lay
hands on a project, but the key to success lies in letting one person have a 
vision and the authority to keep the process on track. 

Many of the great automobiles have been created this way. Ferry Porsche's vision
of the 356 produced great cars. After time, the marketing forces take hold and
you end up with 2 valve 911s for years and years. That's why they killed the
912 and 914.....so they could open up a market for the 924 and then move those
people up to the 944 or 928. 

For another example...

The Datsun 240Z was great. After the marketing forces convinced management that
they could improve the car by "giving people what they wanted" you ended up with
the 280ZX. Barf. 

I think that "marketing" and the general influence of bottom line corporate
types ruins everything it touches.  These are people whose only visions in life
are of big numbers on the bottom lines. They are the ones who make things a
little cheaper to improve the profit margin. They are the ones who say you
have to have a back seat so you can sell to the people with kids. They are
the ones who tell you that convertibles won't sell anymore and then turn 
around and sell the "comeback" of the convertible after they realize they
were wrong. 

Speaking of which, I predict the Mazda Miata will go the way of the 240Z 
and become a Marketing Monstrosity. It will get bigger, more comfy, and 
have more "features." Then they'll introduce the Coupe version......with
a 2+2 rear seat. They'll ruin what is probably a nice car inside of 5 years.

Feh, Ptooey! 

Sorry.....you hit a button.

The Miata is nice car.  One of the nicer ones put out in the past few
years.  The first one rolled off the factory line as a Marketing
Monstrosity, though.  We're talking about a car built up, down and
sideways on marketing hype.  It has two seats and is convertible.
End of sports car heritage.

The car feels like a tank compared to an MGB.  Who wants a sports car
with a Cadillac ride?  They spent *weeks* on the exhaust to give it
"the same note as an MGB, only quieter."  And as on any car build in
the last ten years, it's impossible to work on.

The Miata is an example of one of the funner cars being produced
these days.  But it has been marketized and engineered to be
*exactly* what it is: a car that with most features of the sports car
people longed after but none of the spirit.  Jesus H. Fucking Christ,
who needs an air conditioner in a convertible?

Sports car companies: MG, Healey, Porsche, AC, Triumph, Fiat, Alfa,
Datsun (not Nissan), and based on one model only, VW.

Go ahead, flame me.

Miatas ride like Cadillacs?  ???

I'm sure you were driving the new Aussie Mercury Capri, NOT the Miata.
There is no, repeat NO way I could get ANY Cadillac EVER made through
twisties with the speed, alacrity, and/or fun that I've had in a friend's
Miata.  The car is tight, controlled, solid, fast and relatively affordable.
The only way to make any Cadillac perform that way would involve repealing
several laws of physics.

Fine, if you feel that a sports car must be uncomfortable, devoid of con-
venient features, and send your mechanic's kids through college, it's
your prerogative.  I hardly see how a Miata can be equated to a tank,
except of course for the fact that it doesn't rattle like an MG.

I do agree that A/C in a convertible is weird, but I'm more than willing
to accept the existence of such a thing if it allows Mazda to sell enough
of them to keep producing that sort of car.  I'll just have mine without
A/C, that's all.  If my neighbor is dumb enough to waste the top-down
experience to keep from mussing his hair, that's his problem.

I said compared to MGs (and Porsches).  It was a gross comparison.

On my 2 MGs, Porsche, Toyota, and chunky GM Truck, I've given
mechanics enough money in the past three years to send their kids 
to a nice dinner and an evening out on the town. Actually, that was
entirely on the Porsche.

The seats out of the MG are so comfortable that I've put a set in the
truck.  Exactly what convenient features are missing in MGs?

Rattles have been few and far between on the MGs.  Always easily
diagnosed and solved.

In my experience, the Miata has a mushy suspension and lacks in upper
end power, *compared to* the other fun cars in my stable.

I still think it's one of the better cars available new these days.
If you're dead set on getting a *new* fun car, go for it.  It is,
however, a Marketing Monstrosity.  That was the point I was making
to JZ.

First, thanks to y'all for clearing up my throttle body mystery... someday
I'll drill it out (*carefully*) and add the other vaccuum hose.  Now I
have another problem... oil leaks...

 aha!  So it *is* a common problem!  On my '74 914 2.0 oil leaks from
the vicinity of the valve covers onto the heat exchanger and creates
quite a nasty stench.  I thought I'd replace the cover gaskets and
cross my fingers... If that doesn't work, I assume the culprit is
the pushrod tubes/seals.  I assume I have to pull the heads to replace
these?  Can I do it with the engine in the car?

If I can't stop the leak, is there an aftermarket air/oil deflector
or something that will at least keep the oil off the exhaust system?
I hate the stench and fear that I may end up with an engine fire...

P.S. any magic tricks for getting the valve covers off?  Those clips

Subject: Are European Porsche's


	Hiya Porschephiles,

	A question about European spec porsches, in particular 1978 and
later 911's. As I am going to be in Europe for a number of months I 
wondered about the feasability of purchasing a 911 there and bringing
it back to the US. I would expect it to be easier to find a "good"
car since 911's are more common there. On the other hand, would I
be able to get the parts here (ie: what diff's are there between the
European and US cars), is it legal to import the vehicle, how much
does it cost, how annoying is it to do. Any suggestions/comments 
would be appreciated.

	As I just joined this mailing list I hope that this thread has
not been beaten to death. 

	Thanks alot, Alex

Well, now, I can't let that one go by without defending the good name
of Opel. I loved my GT and didn't let it go until I had a Porsche to
replace it. (Even then I was still tempted to keep it.)

Also, what about Toyota MR-2s? And, er, Ferraris and Lamborghinis? :-)

I'm sure it's difficult to think of every appropriate company just off
the top of your head. Andy certainly thought of more than I would have.

+++++++

So I started taking the EP car apart this weekend. It turns out that the 
only Super 90 part on the car is the bloody Tachometer! All checks on the
motor show it to be a 1962 Normal. 

Now, I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, the guy said it
was a Super-90, but I didn't take his word for it and didn't check. (I
could have checked it very easily) Mostly I didn't check because I would
still have wanted it if it was a normal or super. And it's a Normal. 
The big win because it's a normal is that the parts are quite a bit 
less expensive than if it were an S-90. The big loss is about 30 Horsepower. 
But since my wallet is significantly smaller than my desire to be on the
racetrack with it, a normal is probably better for me. Plus normals will
last longer and run better on modern gas. 

The car needs new torsion bars all around, as I discovered that the driver's
side sits about 1.5" lower than the passenger side....it also needs a new
steering box. So we're looking at about $500 right there jsut to make it 
drive around the block. 

It does run pretty well, though. With a carb rebuild, I bet it will run 
Just Fine. 

The big problem of the weekend was one of the &!^#*&^*!&^*)&$^@# rear bumper
bolts. A little 13mm ATF bolt that was rust-welded very tightly. I worked
and strained and pulled and strained and finally went to air-chisel it off,
but surprise surprise surprise, the little bugger ate two of my chisels with
nary a scratch on it. Just goes to show that some grade 8 fasteners are 
more equal than others. I finally clamped a vice grip on the nut and pressed
real hard with a cheater bar and twisted the little f***er's head off. 

The car seems to be responding well. Anyone who tells you that old Porsches
don't know who's touching them and what's going on is a fool. Things are
springing to life that weren't working before. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang 
was not fiction! 

More as it comes....

Kept the Porschephiles (since british-cars is still in hiatus);
ignore the hardware, the passion's the same:

Yep.  Old MGs are the same way.  We kludged up the choke
(well, cold-start mixture control wire) last weekend, 
in a way that only a Keeper of the Faith would know how
to do (till I get desperate and install the Right Cable,
anyway).  That plus cleaning the dashpots, running a 
little Marvel Mystery Oil down a chopstick (no, I'm not
kidding) and onto the distributor lubrication hole, burnishing
the oxidation off the rotor, wiping out the cap, putting a
little Bosch grease (but not too much!) on the distributor
cam, and topping off the SU dampers with more of Marvel's
finest made a stunning difference.  The cold-start problem
is GONE -- we start with a roar now, and run well enough to
chirp the tires (well, the palaeolithic Dunlops help that)
even before the needle rises up to the C on the temp gauge.

Old sports cars just need to be touched in that special way
every so often.  Just like their owners...

And from the PCS, page 14:

"D.4.  It is permitted to lighten, balance, or modify in shape by 
tooling components of the engine and drivetrain, provided
it is always possible to identify them positively as such.
It is not permitted to add any material or mechanical 
extension unless authorized in these Rules."

Section E, "Engine -- reciprocating," is even more interesting:

"1.  The compression ratio may be increased by machining, using
any head gasket, or doing without one.

"2.  Reboring the cylinders is authorized on condition that the
greatest bore measurement specified for that make and model is not
exceeded by more than 1.2mm (0.472 inches).

"3. Substitute pistons of any material or origin are authorized.

"4.  The substitution or addition of any valve springs [...]

"5.  Use of any pushrods.

"6.  Any camshaft(s) may be used. [. . .]

"7.  Alternate connecting rods are allowed, providing they are
the same material as original rods and original geometry crank pin
to wrist pin dimension is maintained.

"8.  Alternate rocker arms and attendant assemblies are allowed.
Material(s) is unrestricted.

"9.  Crankshaft main bearing caps mey be substituted and 
additional main mearing caps may be used, provided no material
is added to the block for their attachment. [.. .]"

Get the point?  Unless the Super 90 is the only way to get a 1600,
it's a waste of money (and an interesting street motor) to use it.
The engine you end up with for E Prod will only bear a superficial,
external resemblance to a Porsche motor anyway.  You will want to
run compression up near 13:1, a cam with about 1.5 times the lift
of stock (and yes, that means cutting little notches in the tops
of the pistons so that the valves don't bang into them) and duration
of probably greater than 300 degrees, ports big enough to 
drive your FV through, and rocker assemblies of purest virgin
unobtainium.  Do you already know about carbon-fiber pushrods?
Aluminum flywheels?  Radiusing the crank journals?  Do you
know which connecting rods work the best (I'll bet HCP does)?

And, since we're going to be in the same class when you get this
car finished, do you have any idea why I'm telling you how to
make it go faster? :-)

Well, yes 'n' no. The Super-90 motor takes a different case, different
heads and different all sorts of things. 
	
	Manufacturer: Porsche
	Model: 356, 356A, 356C-(1500, 1600), 356C/1600SC, 356B Super 90

Now this is interesting. This list is not by any means complete, unless the
punctuation is really screwy. I'll put it vertically to show what I mean:
	
356,
356A,
356C-(1500, 1600),
356C/1600SC,
356B Super 90
Cabriolet

Now, nowhere on this list does it say 356B Normal, nor does it say "Karmann 
Hardtop, Speedster, Roadster, 1600 Super, or any other of the different
types of 356 available......It would seem to indicate that any 356 or 356A
is eligible, and the completely never-did-exist 356C-1500 is eligible, as
are the really-did-exist 356C and 356SC models. It would also seem to 
indicate that any Cabriolet is eligible.  The point is, a 356B Normal Coupe
does not appear under any of those designations. 

I think the spirit, however, is that any 356 is eligible. (with the exception
of the 1300 356, which is eligible for G Prod.)

This is good, it means I can use aftermarket 83mm pistons and barrels. (the

My car does have a super 90 cam, if the previous owner can be believed.

	Get the point?  Unless the Super 90 is the only way to get a 1600,
	it's a waste of money (and an interesting street motor) to use it.
	The engine you end up with for E Prod will only bear a superficial,
	external resemblance to a Porsche motor anyway.  You will want to
	run compression up near 13:1, a cam with about 1.5 times the lift
	of stock (and yes, that means cutting little notches in the tops
	of the pistons so that the valves don't bang into them) and duration
	of probably greater than 300 degrees, ports big enough to 
	drive your FV through, and rocker assemblies of purest virgin
	unobtainium.  Do you already know about carbon-fiber pushrods?
	Aluminum flywheels?  Radiusing the crank journals?  Do you
	know which connecting rods work the best (I'll bet HCP does)?

Well, that's if I want to be competitive. I'll have to make quite a
few more $$$ before I can afford a Super-90 core motor. Now, I'll buy
the pushrods and valve springs and big valves soon.....but the super
90 shit will have to wait. 
	
	And, since we're going to be in the same class when you get this
	car finished, do you have any idea why I'm telling you how to
	make it go faster? :-)

Because you'll spend most of your time in the paddock trying to stop
oil leaks and you want me to beat Ackerman? ;^}
	
	--Scott "Team Fizzball: From Abingdon to Zuffenhausen" Fisher
	
Great slogan....

Seriously, I think I can do this without all the super-hoopy stuff and still
not shame myself. I don't think I need a Super-90. If I set the rest of the 
car up right, I should be able to coax good performance and reasonable
longevity out of my motor. 

And still beat you. ;^}

Yes, ain't it the truth.  The '64 C coupe has been at home just three
weeks now, and jealousy is rampant in the stable!  The Jetta's battery
open-circuited; the Squareback had a distributor rotor disintegrate and
has taken to rough idling; the Bus has picked up a nasty sticking hydraulic
lifter.  And to make matters worse, the C has responded by crapping all
over the garage floor...  I can see that it will take all winter to
massage bruised egos and make the C feel young again.

You may not have to pull the heads to replace the oil tubes.  There's an
expandable tube for 911s that I've heard works well.  You just slide it into
position and expand it out to fit.  Saves lots of work!

I don't know specific sources for this part; try the usual magazines and Porsche
rags.

Ha!  You've discovered my trick!  When all else fails on a stubborn bolt, get
the vise (vice) grips out and clamp the little mother!  Never fails!

If you can, get new anodized grade 8 hardware for reassembly.  I have it on my
exhaust system and the stuff is wonderful!  It doesn't rust; you can just
unscrew the things after 50K+ miles and 4 years on the header pipes.

Hey everybody!  Road & Track has an owner survey on page 157 in the Nov. issue. 
They'd like information from people who have 944's and 951's, owned them since
new, and have at least 10,000 miles on them.  They didn't mention 944S or S2
cars, but maybe they'll accept those responses anyway.

If anybody would like a FAXed copy of the 2 page form, send me your name/number
and I'll get it right out.  Or you can just buy the magazine...

Subject: Re: Are European Porsche's
Message-Id: <04901031162240/0003844665NB3EM@mcimail.com>

If you're looking at pre-Carrera (1984) 911s in Europe, some things are very
different.  The compression may be different due to different pistons/heads, the
cam will be different, and the engine management (injection, advance/retard)
will also be different.

And there are a few lesser items: no cat, no fuel pipe restrictor, wrong
bumpers/shocks (and too-low bumper height), no side marker lamps (easily adapted
using factory holes), wrong headlamps and bezels, no door beams, wrong speedo
faceplate, and no emissions certification.  I think all the window glass and
seatbelts are OK.

It's gotten *very* difficult to bring in non-US cars the past few years.  I
suggest calling the DOT or a compliance shop to get the latest deal.  You'll
need a lot of luck!

As Jeff pointed out, I have a fondness for Opels, also.  They
certainly fit the "less is better" philosophy of sports cars.  Not
even a cheesy motor raise the headlights.  Just a big lever in the
car with a mechanical linkage to the lights.  I love it.

Sports cars are built with one purpose: to drive.  If it isn't
essential to driving the car, it doesn't belong there.  Electric
windows?  Ha!  A crank is easier and damn near maintenance free.
Better yet, snap on side screens.  You should be able to feel the
balance.  I guess that's one thing I never felt in the Miata.  Not
only should the car be agile, you should be able to point it with
your right foot.  You should be able to tell you're loading the
suspension on a certain corner or end, not just be able to tell the
car is pitching and yawing.  The car should be an experience to
drive, not just a fun (or status showing) way to get from point A 
to point B.

> Also, what about Toyota MR-2s? And, er, Ferraris and Lamborghinis? :-)

Never had the pleasure of driving, riding in, or researching an MR2.
Toyota seems to be the "put a candy coating on the idea" type car
company, but I can't say for certain about MR2s.

Ferrari and Lambo are a different class.  They're toys, but a
different type of toy.  I don't know what to say about them.

Well, yeah.  I knew the list was incomplete.  I could add the Rootes
Group, Mercedes (based on several models), Elva, Lotus, Lancia (sort
of), and probably a few others if I thought real hard.

Sports cars are a religious issue, but I try to attend their church
on some Sundays. :-)

Yes, cars are a religious thing.  I go to "church" very often during the summer,
sometimes for 3 days at a time!  But when winter comes, I just read the various
"bibles" that come in the mail.  I'm even on the minister's committee's, and I
sing the praises quite often!  I've been know to pray at certain church
circuits, when the inertia of my impassioned vehicle fails to slow
sufficiently...

Thanks to the Blues Brothers, I've discovered Our Blessed Lady of Acceleration!
