Porsches (in fact all cars) in Germany are very expensive.  MUCH MUCH
more expensive than they are here.  This is a direct result of
unification.  This has begun to spread to neighboring countries.
Europe is not a good place to go hunting for value in used cars right
now. 

According to the Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide, and verified by my
own experience, there are a higher concentration of Porsches in
California than Germany.  The IPBG claims that, at least up to the
time it was published (1986, I think) half of all Porsches ever sold
were sold in the US, and half of those were sold in southern
california.

Plus, southern californian weather leaves the cars in better shape
than European weather.

Moral: looking for a used Porsche?  go to california.

Subject: Racer's tool and supply catalog

I just received a great catalog, and thought there might be some
interest among the racers in the group.  The company is:

	Racer's Tool and Supply
	4290 Bell's Ferry Road
	Suite 10634
	Kennesaw, Georgia

	phone: (404) 924-4543

They sell stuff for fabricating your own body panels, tools, books, some
supplies.  Some items that immediately caught my eye:

	Leakdown tester   $59.95
	Piston ring filer $36.95  (looks just like the one in the Porsche
		356 B/C factory workshop manual)
	Magnaflux spotcheck kit (does not require a blacklight) $67.50
	Magnetic crack detector $329.00
	Mitutoyo dial caliper $89.95

There was no charge for the catalog.

The star heads are stock - someone did you a favor and replaced half of them
with the allen head bolts.  I have the correct star socket and still the damn
things strip out.  Then I get out the pipe wrench - that works great, so you
don't need the grinder.
   A word of warning - do _not_ over tighten those bolts, as I did a couple
of times with the pipe wrench.  It overstresses them and then one day when
you put away from a stop sign you shear the bolts.  All 4 of them.  And then
you are up the proverbial creek.  Last time it happened to me (before I got
smart and started using loctite) I was lucky enough to have a reversible,
rechargable drill and a set of bolt extracting bits with me...still took me
several hours, though.  I always keep a couple of extra bolts in the trunk,
also.
   Fortunately, the 911 has the allen head bolts stock, so I dont't have that
problem anymore.

I can only speak for Germany, not all of Europe. I lived in Germany in '86 and
 '87, more precisely, in Zuffenhausen, about 1 km from the factory. While there
are quite a few Porsches (particularly 911's) around Stuttgart, most of which
are from recent vintage, finding a good used one is impossible. They get DRIVEN 
over there. Personally, I went through a set of rear tires every 10K kms (6.2k
miles). Driving flat-out is part of my  daily  commute, which sometime include 
a lap or two around the old Solitude Ring on the way home, if I need to wind
down.

Perhaps, but how many people in the East can afford Porsches? For Americans, I
think it has more to do with the lousy exchange rates. I bought my 83 SC from
an american army doctor, for US$17K early in '86 because it was a better deal
than I could find on the economy, the exchange rate at the time was 2.5 dm=$1.

When  I left in 87, I bought my 85 Carrera, again from an American for US$22K, 
they were going for around 50K dms at the time.

The current exchange rate hovers around 1.55 DM = $1. You can do your own
arithmetic.

I imported my car back to the US, it is a piece of cake, here's the break down
of cost:

- Shipping to Baltimore - $700 (company paid)
- Marine insurance, port fee, triple bonding - $700
- import duty 2.72% - I sweet talked my way out of it. I still CAN'T believe
  it.
- EPA and DOT costs including ALL the paper works to the DOT folks and the
conversion works - $3600.

The conversion was done by Champagne Imports in Hatfield, PA. I visited them in
advanced, they are a good, reputable outfit, who is still in business, though I
can't imagine doing much conversion work anymore.

    > Moral: looking for a used Porsc> he?  go to california.

Buy one (or several) in California, and ship them to Germany, you can make
some money, my friends are doing it. The buyers will have to get TUEV approval,
which is a piece of cake and pay the mehrwertsteuer (VAT) of 14%, which again 
can be *adjusted*.

-------
Some personal observations:

1. Why do most people think it is much harder to import grey market cars?

They probably read too much and got caught in the media hysterics, caused
mainly by the greedy Mercedes Benz of North America folks. The difference is,
the government now requires a bond trippling the value of the car instead of
equipvalent. AND, there is no longer a 5 years EPA, waiver rule.  All cars have
after '68, have to comply to the equipvalent US models.

2. What is the difference between euro and US 911?

EPA: most (all?) euro 911 (Porsches) now have catalyst. If it ain't there, you
got to add it.

DOT: 

- There is no difference in bumper height (as someone suggested), unless it
has been privately lowered. 

- Most 911 (Porsches) since 83 have door beams for all markets. Both of mine
did. Bumpers have no shock absorbers, for 911, you can buy them and retrofit 
yourself. 

- Markers, lights, speedo, Fuel funnel etc have to be added. The euro H4 are 
a zillion times better than the US lights (9004 included).

Performance:

- The euro SC's was rated as followed: 180ps in 78, 188ps in 79,80, 204 ps for
81-83. Mine 83 SC had NO problems keeping up with my friends Porsches. most of
my friends works for Porsche Styling or the racing department, they are not
timid drivers. I remembered the first time driving home after the inaugural
Super Cup race at Nuerburgring, I passed one of my friend's 944 Turbo on
autobahn 8, no one believed they got passed by an SC going flat out. ALL
PORsches are different, the ratings are nominal.

- The Carrera had 231 PS, it had 11:1 compression, different ECU, and forged 
piston instead of the heavier and less durable Kelsey-hayes alunimum pistons.
I saw 260+ kpm on the speedo and redline in 5th on the tach a few times. I know
there is some error in the speedo, but not the tach.

Ah, I take it that a few of you have pulled Porsche CV joints.  I'm a little
bored and it's getting colder these days, so I just might try it some snowy
night with high winds.  Can 944/951 owners who've pulled CVs relate the
experience?

What size star-allen do I need?  Are there hidden circlips, as on Rabbits?  Is
the outer one hard to do (1986 with aluminum trailing arms)?  Is Loctite
necessary if the bolts are torqued correctly?  Are the 930 allen-bolts an exact
fit?

Help those who follow in your (now wiser) footsteps!  Thanks...

Yes, the "triple square" bolts are all over my 944S: the clutch, the rear axle,
the rear hatch hardware, etc.  Anyone know of a reasonable source for the tools?
Snap-On has 'em, but they're as expensive as all Snap-On tools are.  What
mechanical advantage does such a bolt head have over, say, a hex allen bolt?

Jim -

There was an article on CV joint rebuilding in another PCA region's newsletter a
few months ago (HCR?), which I clipped and saved.  Doesn't sound too hard.  I
can mail you a copy if you send me an address.

I have rebuilt the half-shafts on my '86 951 as well as on the '84 944
I owned before that.  You need an 8mm 12-point star-allen socket to
remove and install the CV bolts.  Automotion (1-(800)-777-8881) sells
such a widget (for a standard 3/8" rachet) for $16.95, but I found an
8mm 12-point bit (to use in a standard socket) at a local hardware
store for a few dollars.

I did not encounter any particular difficulties removing the CV bolts,
except for one bolt that I believe was stripped (the head, not the
threads) by the previous owner or his mechanic.  The only circlip
(which you need some patience and a good sturdy set of snap ring
pliers to deal with) is the one that holds the CV joint on the shaft.
The aluminum control arms did not pose any particular problem.  On
both the inner and outer joints you can only reach a couple of bolts
without turning the axle because of the angle the axle makes with the
joints, particularly with the suspension in full "droop".

After inspecting the joints for scoring, I used Swepco Moly-Lube to
repack them.  I did not use Loctite on reassembly, but simply torqued
the bolts to 42 Nm (31 ft-lb) as prescribed in the factory manual.  I
don't know if 930 bolts will fit.  Don't forget to notice which way
the joints are facing before you remove them so that you can reinstall
them the same way.  There is a groove etched on the outside of the
joint that should be nearest the side facing away from the shaft.

By the way, if you've never tried to reassemble a CV joint before,
you're in for some fun (if you like puzzles, that is).  There are two
ways it can go back together.  As usual in life, the wrong way is the
easy one.  You'll know when this has occured, however, because the
inner and outer races will be securely locked together!

Good luck,

-Milo

}RE 944 CV joints:
 
They are EXACTLY the same as doing the rabbit inners, only same on both
ends.  6mm I beleive.  The CV Kits come with new bolts (at least that's
how I get them from the wholesaler) a new boot and a tube of CV grease.
Cost is in the $70 range per.  I replaced them one at a time, over a
span of about 2 mos, so I would at lease inspect all if you are going to
bother, and repack.  Best to opt for replacement.  You have to pull the
whole axel anyway so at least replace them in pairs.

The 930 boltas are about 2 mm longer, which makes no diff since all
holes are drilled all the way through flanges.  Mine were torqued to
feel.  I have a whole mess of "cheesehead" screws that are brand new if
anyone needs some, and it's not a bad idea to carry a few spares.

To replace you will need a 4" gear puller to get the inner "race" off
the axel.  It is held on with a single non-holed circlip.  No fun to get
that off.

In any event, my 951 -w- 70K miles needed all 4. Look for spalling on
the races.  They wear MUCH faster if the car has been lowered alot.

} Yes, the "triple square" bolts are all over my 944S: the clutch, the rear axle,

Porsche calls these "cheesehead bolts"

You should pick up a 6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm.  Most are 6mm, clutch, CVs,
hatch hardware.

The local pep boys sells them. They are made by Leslie and almost any
good car parts store should sell them.  They come bubble wrapped.

You can buy them with or without the socket.  The big mothers (10mm and
12mm) come as a shaft only.  The 12mm is needed to pull the tranny
tailshaft (Fun fun fun!) and for the flywheel bolts (also a barrel of
laughs).

I think the only parts of the turbo which I havn't disassembled are the
rear wheel bearings.  Note to follow on that one.

If you can't get them in Jersey (since they may be restricted to real
states ;^}  ) I would be happy to pick one up and bring to a track
event.

Subject: RE:Star bolts

  I got my "triple-square" from an import car parts shop that specialized
in bug parts.  Evidently the bug has the same format of bolts (isn't that
reassuring).  Note that this is also the same kind of bolt used in the 911
door striker bolts, and I have seen them in the door hinge bolts, although
I don't know if that is stock.  Perhaps Porsche went to all the trouble of
using this bolt to impose a sort of a mandatory torque limit on the bolt, ie
it will strip out by design if you torque it too hard.
   Also, don't be fooled - this is not a "torx" head bolt.  A torx key/socket
will work, but not very well.  I spent a couple of years with one until I
found the correct tool in the above mentioned bug store.

   Heh, I know about the CV puzzle - they are a bitch to get apart once you
put them together wrong.  An easy way to put them together properly is to
remember that the wide spacing on the outside race goes with the narrow
spacing on the inside race.  The spacing between the bearings that is.  Use
a good moly grease (I think Swepco 101 is the right kind, Tweeks sells it) and
get a new boot if the one you have looks old.  It's very messy when a boot
breaks open, and very expensive if you don't catch it in time.

Subject: 944 Belt Tension Values


I own a late model 1983 944 and recently shelled out to money for the
camshaft and balance shaft belt tension tool (P9201).  My problem
is that I have two sets of documentation which give two different
tension values for the belts.  Does someone know what the current
accepted values are ?

The documentation I have gives the following values:

  Camshaft:
             1)   2.0 +/- 0.3  New Belt   OR    2)   2.4 - 3.0  
                  1.6 +/- 0.3  Old Belt              Both Old and New

  Balance Shaft:
             1)   2.4 - 3.0               OR    2)   4.0 - 4.6 New Belt
                  Both Old and New Belts             3.7 - 4.3 Old Belt

This is indeed the best clue to the puzzle.  I couldn't figure out how
to describe this situation as well as you (although it's not clear
that anyone who doesn't already know what you're talking about knows
what you're talking about :-)).  We need to figure out how to get some

To: porschephiles@bcm.tmc.edu
Date: Fri, 2 Nov 90 15:41:04 PST
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

I loosened the valve cover retaining bale on my 914 last night
(threaded a shop rag over the bale at one end and prised with a medium
screwdriver at the other end... worked like a charm!  Thanks for all
the hints!)

Now I want to replace the pushrod tube seals to stop an oil leak.
Here's what I think I need to do.  Please comment or correct me if
I'm wrong:

1)  remove the rocker assemblies (the two rods around which the
    rockers pivot)

2)  remove the strange thin-wire clip that (apparently) holds the
    tubes in place (?)

3)  pull out the pushrod tubes & seals, put on new seals, and
    slide the tubes back in.

4)  put the thin-wire clip back in and put the rocker assemblies
    back on.

Questions:

    1. do I need to use any sealant on or around the pushrod tube
       seals?  i don't really want them to leak any more.

    2. will it be difficult to put the rocker assemblies back on?
       will I have to compress the valve springs?  i don't have
       a spring compressor tool...

    3. will i need to do a valve adjustment afterward?  i look
       forward to it being much easier than the bucket & shim
       valves on my Audi...  What's the easiest way to turn the
       engine over to line up the valves?  I don't want to push
       the car because it'll be up on stands...

Anything else I should beware of?

	    1. do I need to use any sealant on or around the pushrod tube

Yes, you need to use permatex 98H. It's kind of burgundy colored goop
that seals hot engine joints very well. It *will* leak oil if you 
don't use something, and people I respect use Permatex 98H. (Hi Dave! ;^})

No, it's not difficult at all, but pay close attention to it!
You shouldn't need a spring compressor, some of the valve springs will 
compress on their own as you torque it down. Make sure, though, that 
all the pushrods are in their seats at both ends as you bring the rocker
down. Torque it down nice and slow in stages. Your shop manual will 
have the final torque value and a procedure outlining the torque stages
on the way....

Well, a pure technical theory would say no, but I always do. It is 
such an easy process that there is no reason not to. Move your 
motor with a large metric crescent wrench on the pulley nut.
Don't use an SAE one or it may round off your pulley nut. 
Get the motor to TDC on #1 cylinder, as indicated by the position
of the rotor (you take the distributor cap off). Then turn the 
motor  *backwards* (that's counter-clockwise) and you can do the 
cylinders in order (1,2,3,4). As you have guessed, the firing 
order running forwards is 1,4,3,2.  This has the added advantage 
that you do the 1/2 side and then the 3/4 side. 

If you don't have a book that describes the process, How To Rebuild
Your VOLKSWAGEN Air-Cooled Engine by Tom Wilson (HP Books) gives
full and specific information for the type 4/914 motor. I highly 
recommend this book. It's $12.95 well spent at the Bugformance shop
on El Camino Real in Sunnyvale. 

	Anything else I should beware of?
	
Yeah, use new pushrod tubes. They're cheap.
And use all new gaskets when you put it back together.
I don't use the 98H on the valve cover gaskets, they
don't generally leak at all. But those who are really
conscientious sometimes use Copper Gasket Coat spray
on those to keep them well sealed.

If you get stuck, give me a call at (408) 336-3382, I should
be at home all weekend. Seriously.

Do you really need to remove the entire rocker assembly?  Can you
just take out the adjustment screw and get the pushrod out?  My
roommate didn't say anything about this...

Replace the tubes if you can - they are designed for a one-time
installation and crush in place.  Also, I have heard about some
super-duper seals that do a lot better job than stock.  Lube the
seals with silicone paste or a grease-type lubricant.  Dow-Corning
111 compound works well here (Borrowing from Bruce Anderson's
Performance Handbook).

If you have to remove them, you won't have to compress the springs.
Also, I think the rocker assemblies are held in place with locknuts.
Use new ones for this - I had a set loosen up on me in Colorado one
year and had to drive back to Texas with 3 cylinders - it sucks only
being able to go 65mph.

Yes, you will have to adjust the valves if you loosened or remove the
adjustment screws - good idea to do it anyway while you have the stupid
covers off.  The way I turn the engine is to jack up one side and have
the other side on the ground (both rear tires mounted).  Release the
parking break (make sure the car is stable) and put it in 5th gear.
Take off the distributor cap to see which cylinder is on the firing
stroke - the rotor will point to the appropriate ignition wire.  Two
of the cylinders fire on TDC, which is marked on the impeller with an
O.  I don't think 180 degrees is marked - you'll have to guess.  At TDC
or 180 degrees, the cylinder pointed to by the rotor will be the one
you want to adjust, as both valves are fully closed.
The cylinders fire 180 degrees apart in an order I forget.  Just turn
the raised wheel to rotate the crank until the appropriate marking comes
into view.  Oh, I forgot - you need a mirror to see the impeller through
the sight hole as the markings are on the side toward the rear of the car.
Not very convenient, unless some nice person painted the timing markings on
the front of the impeller, hint, hint.
   Adjust both the intake and exhaust valves to .006" or .15mm.  Sometimes
in really hot weather I move the exhaust valves out a little more,
sacrificing performance for engine safety.  You need a 13mm wrench and
a stubby screwdriver - set the adjusting screw so that your feeler gauge
just drags in the gap and lock the nut while keeping the screw from
turning with the screwdriver.  If the engine is in the car, I don't think
you can adjust the front passenger side cylinder because a suspension mount
is in the way - you'll have to wait until you drop the engine to do that one.
Unfortunately that is also the same one that is under the oil cooler and
is notorious in Bugs for overheating.
   My description is a bit unorganized, but it should contain all the
pertinent information - use the Heinous (Haynes) manual as a reference.

Have fun!!!

Craig,

I empathize with your uncertainty about the tensioning values.  After
one has purchased a very delicate (therefore very expense) instrument
to measure the tension in our precious belts, it is rather
disconcerting to see such a wide range of suggested tension values
(although the 1.6-2.0 value you reported is a new low for me, and
sends chills up my spine).  Here is what my factory manual (which, if
you don't have, you should.  After all, it costs less than half what
the P9201 tool cost :-)) indicates:

Cam belt:      4.0 +/- 0.3  new
               2.7 +/- 0.3  used

Balance shaft
belt:          2.7 +/- 0.3  used or new

The higher value for the new cam belt is of course to compensate for
some stretching.  A new belt should be readjusted after 1000 miles to
the 2.7 value.  I have no idea why the same stretching considerations
do not seem to be applied to the balance shaft belt.  Since this belt
is not critical like the cam belt, we don't need to be as fussy about
it?

>I own a late model 1983 944 and recently shelled out to money for the
>camshaft and balance shaft belt tension tool (P9201).  My problem

I have successfully trained my mind so that whenever it thinks about
the "shelling" my wallet took to buy tool P9201, it immediately
recalls the hefty sums I used to pay mechanics who owned the tool
before I did, and I sleep well.

-Milo

P.S.: If you have replaced or removed (perhaps to install a new water
pump or reseal the engine ;-)) these belts, make sure you crank the
engine around (by hand) a couple of times to make sure you've gotten
the slack out before checking the tension.

The numbers Milo quotes in his response are correct, per the latest updates to
the factory workshop manuals and tech bulletins.  One additional figure is that
for the polyrib drive belt for the a/c and alternator.  It should be tensioned
to 9.5.  Hey, get a little extra use out of that expensive tool!

Jim Selders noted recently that the idler pulley should be replaced with the cam
timing belt.  Am I quoting you correctly, Jim?

There is a calibration tool for tool 9201.  It doesn't cost a lot, in comparison
with the price of the tool itself.  I don't know how important or how often 9201
needs calibration.

Kevin,

My factory manual sayeth: "The tool must be calibrated after:

- about 100 measurements

- hard jolts or knocks

- slight damage.

Calibration will not be sufficient in case of greater damage or
display deviation of more than 2.0 scale units."

Milo -

Right-ho.  But the manual assumes the tool gets used a lot (like in a
dealership), rather than sitting on a shelf most of the time, getting used two
or three times a year (assuming you have one or two friends you trust to lend it
to!)  So, not knowing what it's made of, I wonder.

I've been lucky so far.  My '87 944S' belt got replaced in a recall, then
retensioned when PCNA bought me a new water pump earlier this year.  So I have
been spared the delight of investing in the tool myself to date.  I figure my
luck's going to run out soon!

I'll be making my debut at Road Atlanta for PCA-sponsored 'drivers ed' in two

The car is a very clean '87 951 (944T), and I really don't want to drill holes

avoid it... So I ask the net: where do you mount _your_ extinguisher?

Kevin,

Actually, I am sufficiently neurotic about this belt tensioning
operation that I end up making *quite a few* measurements before I
feel confident enough to crank it over with the starter.  I probably
don't hit the 100 measurement limit, but may not be far from it ;-).

me. Just don't freak out if they're 12mm nuts....

Subject: Fire Extinguisher


Mount it where you can get at it. Forget the holes in your floor. 
If you're that worried about it, I'd think twice before driving
it at Road Atlanta. Seriously, I'm not trying to be an asshole
here, but I never put a car on the track that I'm not prepared 
to walk away from while the towing guys decide which junkyard
to take it to. 

I saw a guy stuff a brand-new Conquest into a wall at Laguna Seca 
this year. Your insurance won't pay you a dime if you stuff it 
at RA. The Conquest was totalled and this guy was bumming hard.  

And nothing lowers resale value like a fire in the car. And your
face is more important than resale value. So put the extinguisher
where it needs to be to save your life. A few holes through the
floor are no big deal....


EP Porsche Update:

I continued the teardown this weekend, though I have the Cold from 
Hell. I tried to stay in bed, really I did! I just couldn't help myself. 

I've made the decision to take the car apart to the last nut and bolt
and to put it back together with all new fasteners. In between, I'm 
going to have it dipped to get rid of all rust and glue and padding 
and paint and road crap. 

I haven't quite decided whether to keep the stock dash or try to carefully
cut it out of the car. It would be difficult to use the stock dash without
ruining it....I'm trying to decide if I can cut it out without ruining 
it, too. 

So the windows are out, the wiring harness all the way to the fusebox from
the front of the car is out, the interior is out, except for the underdash
wiring and gauges and switches. 

It's beginning to look a lot a skeleton.

The oil cooler is over the passenger side front cylinder - whatever
number it happens to be.  This is the same one blocked by the suspension
mount (my mount was redone in quarter inch plate steel, thanks to the
wonderful battery box - maybe it gives you less clearance than stock).
The suspension mount doesn't give you enough room to get a screwdriver
in there, but you can fit the wrench in there.  Maybe if you
had a trick screwdriver (like from a skateboard or something) it would
work, or you could just do trial and error until you got the right gap.
I just did it when I dropped the engine.

I'm pretty sure it's 13 on the 914...it's also 13 on the 911.

The lower settings are the correct ones.  Porsche reduced the values when they
came out with the improved belts a few years ago.  The new belts don't require
the tension of the older ones.

P.S. - Are you at MIT?  Several of us in and around Cambridge have 944 series
cars and would like to rent the tensioner tool come Spring, if you're willing...

Thanks to everyone who helped with the CV joint story!  It sounds like a pretty
easy job, except maybe for those circlips buried in the goopy grease.

On another topic, my 951 started handling weird this weekend.  Turns out the
rear bushings on the front control arms are tearing apart from all the track
use.  The A-arms are wiggling a lot more than they should be.  All you track
junkies, watch those bushings - they stress to death!

	Good question; PCA requires 1985 standard (approved) helmets
next year.  Might as well get one this time (1990 version) that'll 
be allowed for an additional 5 years.

I'm not sure that there are any Snell approved 1990 grade helmets
for sale as yet. 

I just went helmet shopping for my racing suit, and the best I 
could find was Snell SA85. (SA means Sports Applications, as I 
discovered.) Nobody knew when the Snell Foundation would upgrade
from that level. 

I have further been assured that the SCCA will continue to honor
M85 through the end of 1991, and SA85 until at least 1995. I think
that the SCCA is a good touchstone. If the SCCA will let me wear 
it as primary protection, it's certainly as good as you're likely
to find. (within reason)

When I was shopping for helmets a few months back, the folks at Halo Products
said "everyone will probably upgrade requirements to SA85 in a year or so, buy
one now. It'll be at least two years before SA90 helmets are available, and
longer till they're required, so this should probably last you at least 3
years."

	Hiya Porschephiles,

	I need some advice on an ad I am going to place in Excellence. YOu
get one add free with each year of subscription that you have. Since I am
looking for a Porsche a want add seems appropriate. The only problem is, what
to write.

	I am looking for a 1978- 911 in great mechanical condition, the
body is not as important. Also, the budget for the car will be <25K, and
preferably <20k.

	What things should I ask in an ad that will be placed in a nationally
distributed mag? 

	Any and all suggestions welcome.

	Many thanks, Alex

Oooo... I'm not so sure I'd place an "I want to buy a car" ad in Excellence,
or any nationally distributed mag, unless there was something *REALLY* 
specific that you were looking for, like say a '72 911S sunroof coupe with
the SportoMatic transmission (total of <50 made). (Incidentally, if you
know where one is, do call....)

First off, go get a copy of Bruce Anderson's book "The 911 Performance 
Handbook" from which you can learn all of the gotchas on the whole
family. Figure out what you can and can't live with, and for the stuff
you can't live with, figure out if you can replace it with aftermarket
stuff.

For example, living in the humidity capital of the world, also in the
middle of the SunBelt, it gets bloody hot here in the summer, and it's
always damp even in winter. So you really need to be able to run the
A/C compressor to de-humdify even your heat or defroster. Well, you don't
get that until you get into the '84 and up Carrera series. Not much
you can do about that. If on the other hand, you think the 20mm rotors
and wimpy brakes on the SC's suck, you *CAN* replace them with 24mm rotors
and Bremtek calipers, and even go to 935 style jumbo master cylinders if
you want to cut down the stroke (at the expense of raising effort).

Anyway, once you figure this stuff out, you need to budget some $$$ for
"upfixen der Porsche" and some more $$$ for "gogetten der Porsche en der
first place". You can trade them off against each other, but I generally
allow at least $1000 per every 4 years of age, just to be safe.

Then go shopping. Look at lots of cars. Talk your friends into looking at
cars for you. Go to PCA meetings and ask folks there. Check out the 
want ads in the back of Panorama (less of the gold-chain crowd trying to
make a buck off of the "exotic German investment" than in Excellence or
AutoWeak [yes, I spelled it that way intentially]).

And, above all, plan on treating your first 911 as a learning experience.
That means you acknowledge up front that you're not going to get your dream 
car, because you really don't know what that means yet, and that it's OK to 
plan on selling it in a year or so and getting another. Or, if you're
like me, not selling it in a year or so, and getting another anyway....
(I did debate over whether to call this "porschephiles" or "porscheholics"
with good reason.... "my name is Stan, and I've got this problem...")

Enjoy! Good luck!!! Good hunting!!! And let us all know what you get!

Stan

Did you see the snide, but accurate quote in Autofreak from somebody (I think in
CART) who said, at least Porsche can win in the Porsche Cup series...

Message-Id: <05901105213450/0003844665NB2EM@mcimail.com>

Well, ahem, there are two common ways of mounting extinguishers that I've seen
in 944 series cars.  First is bolted to a home-made steel bracket that bolts
under the front seat track (either side).  This is a clean, removable job but
requires that you get some steel and do a little cutting and bolting.  Not too
bad really.

Second, drill the chassis or tunnel in a place that doesn't interfere with seat
travel or hit anything on the back side.  Mine is in the rear, on the passenger
side vertical wall (behind a hypothetical passenger's heels), at floor level. 
This is very secure and I've had no problems in 4 years.  Only thing is that
when you drill, make sure you don't hit the fuel lines on the other side, in
front of the torsion spring cross-tube!

Drilling the car isn't such a big deal.  It drills like putty, and if you secure
the bolts with lock washers and spray rubberized undercoating all over, you'll
have no leak or rust problem.  Plus, on the interior you're drilling through
carpet, so the hole won't show when/if you remove the bolts.

JZ has an excellent point; the fire bottle is there to protect you - don't worry
an inordinate amount about how pretty it is.  Make sure you can get to it while
you're seated in the driver's seat!

[Editorial follows]

On a related note, I'd like to share an opinion with track folks and get input
from you all.  Several of us in New England have been talking about the
extinguisher rule lately, and have come to the conclusion it's pretty useless. 
I'm considering recommending that it not be required for Green (beginner), and
possibly more/all groups.  The reasoning is as follows:

1) Fires are extremely rare in our experience.
2) Fires are electrical or gas related.  You often can't get to the wires
causing an electrial fire, and fuel-fed fires can be so big that you just want
to protect your life (explosion risk, non-stop flames, etc).
3) Requiring a mounted bottle for beginners is a deterent to participation;
people don't want to spend $50-$100 just to *try* a track once.  They also don't
want to drill their car.
4) If there is a fire, a 2.5 pound bottle won't help very much.
5) Many other participants, and all flag stations, have extinguishers.
6) It doesn't make sense to require extinguishers but not require fireproof
clothing and helmets.

So basically, we feel that although it's better to have an extinguisher than
not, it provides little real protection and hinders new-comers.  If we're really
worried about fire, then let's require suits, and SA85 helmets.  M85 helmets
aren't required to be fireproof.  Zone I people don't even know that!  Also, the
biggest "safety" issue in most track incidents is extrication, not fire.  People
have to get out of the car quickly in case there *is* a fire hazard.  Yet we
don't talk about leaving doors unlocked, or having all windows down (to climb
through).

Comments and flames are encouraged!

I'll let you in on how I did mine.  It is by no means ideal (yet), but works and
avoids drilling holes in the floor and carpet.  Btw, if you do decide to go
through the floor, be real careful of you fuel lines!  Also make sure the
extinguisher you purchase has a metal exhaust tip, not plastic.  Imparts
generally has them for a very good price.

The rule is "metal-to-metal" hereabouts.  What I chose to do was mount a 2 1/2
lb. extinguisher in front of the passenger-side front seat.  Two L-shaped pieces
of flat stock are bolted, one to each top chair rail.  (The top rails are fixed
to the seat and travel with it.  They lock into and slide with the bottom rails,
which are bolted to the floor.)  The bottom of each 'L' bolts to the front of
the the corresponding rail, using a 1/4" (or M6) bolt, split washer, and nut.

A cross-piece of flat stock joins the tops of the two L's.  The extiniguisher is
bolted to this cross piece.  The whole shebang travels with the seat and fits
under any passenger's knees without getting in the way.  I positioned the nozzle
at the far end, facing down.  In the case of any accidental discharge, it is
more likely to go down into the floor rather than up onto the windscreen!

You will have to remove the seat to drill the holes in the rails.  It is held
down by six allen bolts.  When you put it back in, position the bolts very
carefully; it is easy to cross-thread them.  Drape the door sill while doing
this to keep from scratching it.

I enhanced this original set-up a bit to make it less wiggly.  The L's now have
back-to-back L's which brace them against the floor.  They just sit on the
floor; they're not drilled in.  I plan to redesign this over the winter,
hopefully using angle stock so to obviate the "need" for the second L's.  The
bracket has been primed then sprayed matte black.  It is easy to remove if
desired.

I do not like to see extinguishers mounted in the rear (cf. Timmins' & Selders'
postings).  If you believe an extinguisher belongs in a car, it should be easily
accessible under what is likely to be a panic situation.  If you're panicked, or
if you're on a side or a roof, navigating even a 2 1/2 lb. extinguisher out from
behind the seat (which may have moved during impact) is very hard.

Another thing 944 owners used to do was put down the rear seat and mount the
extinguisher to the rear seat "back."  This was very flimsy, and the seat does
not lock down.  No longer allowed.

While JZ's statement about being prepared to walk way from any track car may
work for him, it goes 100% against the way we in Zone 1 of the PCA run track
events!  (And I would assume the other Zones as well!)  We run high quality,
fun, but safe events.  I cannot afford to trash my car, emotionally or
financially.  We want to encourage our members to get out and experience their
cars "in ihren schoensten Form."

In Mass., we are indeed covered by our standard-issue insurance policies against
damage which occurs at the track so long as the event was a school and not a
competitive event.  So, except for the small number of time trials held, Mass.
drivers are in theory covered.  I say "in theory" because I'm not an attorney
nor am I an insurance agent.  I do know of several people who have made
forthright claims from incidents at the track, and no-one was denied
compensation, to my knowledge.  Of course, things are probably different in each
state.  Ask your broker/agent, and if the answer's 'yes,' get it in writing.

Finally, I agree with Jim Selder's comment regarding the need for extinguishers.
While I have nothing against them in cars, I think that requiring them for
"safety" makes very little sense.  There are much better things we can do which
bring bigger wins in safety, the least of which is properly training corner
workers.  Some Regions do this very well, most (in my experience) do not.  (By
way of comparison, the SCCA's workers are top notch.)

I would really enjoy hearing other people's opinions on the need for
extinguishers and on track safety.

Here's my editor's column from August this year (so they stole it from me):

********
Air Cooled Advertiser    August 1990

Nuts and Bolts                    Chris Welty

It all started, really, with racing.  Were it not for racing, there is
no question that Porsche would not be what it is today.  However,
currently Porsche is floundering in a putrid sea of indecision, as it
desperately searches for an arena in which it can score motor sport
victories.  Currently, the only series Porsche seems to have reliable
and consistent success in is the Porsche Cup.  As a result, they have
sent some of their top research engineers to study that series and
determine what the key difference is that makes Porsche a contender
there, while failing in so many other places.  After detailed and
lengthy analyses, they determined that in order to be assured a
victory in any class, they merely needed to eradicate the competition.

As many people know, before I was offered the job as Co-Editor of the
Air Cooled Advertiser, I was a well known figure in international arms
smuggling, as well as the leader of an elite mercenary squad upon
which the movie "Delta Force" was based.  To the layman, I was sort of
a "James Bond" for hire.  One day it hit me that the pen was mightier
than the sword, and I traded in my uzi and rocket launcher for a word
processor and Porsche (which, although perhaps not mightier than the
sword, is certainly more fun to drive).  However, my reputation had been so
deeply established in the underworld that few believed I had left for
good, and somehow the news of my retirement never spread.

It should have been no surprise, therefore, when the call came.  Never
the less, I was rather taken aback to hear Hans Branitzki, CEO of Porsche
AG, on the line.  He was quite insistent, and - after numerous refusals
on my part - he turned to blackmail, claiming to have in his possession 
some films of me and this Swedish number I knew in the old days.  When I
reminded him that those films had been a gift, he switched tactics
(remembering that you can attract more flies with honey), and mentioned
that the payment would be BB-PW 959, the prototype 959.  The first.

Luckily we were not on videophone, because he mistook the silence on
my part as hesitation (when in reality I was collecting my jaw from
the floor), and threw in my well known favorite: a year's supply of
canned squid.  That was lucky since I had almost ran out from my last
job.  At this point I could do little else but agree.  It wasn't until
a few days later that I realized even with my connections in
government it would be impossible to bring a 959 into the US, so I
sent Hans my regrets.  I didn't really want it anyway.

This issue, which is late again, proves that we the editors can do
little to get a newsletter out on time if we have to write everything.
This month's tech article, aside from being humorous, is meant to
remind people that you shouldn't work on your car unless you know what
you're doing.

Well, I suppose I should explain myself a little better. I don't go out
there thinking my car is a throwaway or that if it gets munched, it's 
no big deal. I guess the central thing, though, is that regardless of
how careful you are, the potential for a munch is always there. Therefore,
I wouldn't drive your 944 on the track, because it's not mine and my
insurance does not cover me driving your car under those conditions. 

Running your events with an eye towards keeping the cars in one piece
is good, but everyone should be aware that these things happen. I think 
it's a little naive to downplay it. 

I think everyone tries to run safe events, and while I try to maintain
a reasonable balance between driving fast and keeping my car in one piece, 
I can't vouch for the crazy &^$&^%@*)#&^$&^@$ millionaire who wants to 
pass me in the turns. 

I was specifically thinking of the fellow who was worried about his
resale value. I'd advise him to think long and hard about how he
wants to do this. It's a risk, but then again, probably less of a 
risk than my drive to work each morning....(mountain commute, y'know.)

Subject: Fire Extinguishers

	Several of us in New England have been talking about the
	extinguisher rule lately, and have come to the conclusion
	it's pretty useless. 
	I'm considering recommending that it not
	be required for Green (beginner), and
	possibly more/all groups. 

Well, I kind of like them, and I keep them in all my cars, but your mileage
may vary....I've also never had to use one in an emergency situation. I 
have come upon a burning car, too.....the guy was already out, and I 
took one look at that Honda Accord and at my little fire bottle and decided
it was a waste to even try. However, had the guy been pinned, the 
fire extinguisher would have been most handy in aiding his extraction. 

	The reasoning is as follows:
	1) Fires are extremely rare in our experience.

Yup. But boy oh boy, when they happen! 

	2) Fires are electrical or gas related. 
	You often can't get to the wires
	causing an electrial fire, and fuel-fed fires
	can be so big that you just want
	to protect your life (explosion risk, non-stop flames, etc).

Which is where the inside bottle comes into play. To give you the five 
or ten seconds to get yourself out of the car before it does serious 
injury to you.

	3) Requiring a mounted bottle for beginners
	is a deterent to participation;
	people don't want to spend $50-$100 just to
	*try* a track once.  They also don't
	want to drill their car.

Ummmmm.....are your track schools otherwise free? 
I'd say $20 is more like the cost of a decent 
car-sized fire bottle. Your mileage may vary.

	4) If there is a fire, a 2.5 pound bottle won't help very much.

But maybe just enough. 

	5) Many other participants, and all flag stations, have extinguishers.

Yup. Good thing, too.

	6) It doesn't make sense to require extinguishers
	but not require fireproof clothing and helmets.
	
That's true. A Helmet requirement seems reasonable. But lacking that,
and if you will believe me that an adequate fire bottle can be purchased for
$20 and might possibly save your face in a marginal situation, I don't think
many people would be that cheap....though I've seen examples....

	So basically, we feel that although it's
	better to have an extinguisher than
	not, it provides little real protection and hinders new-comers. 

I think it is better to have one, and the little protection it gives 
comes pretty cheap. 

	If we're really worried about fire, then let's require suits,
	and SA85 helmets.  M85 helmets aren't required to be fireproof. 
	Zone I people don't even know that! 

I didn't know that, either. Makes me glad I have an SA85....But about your
first point, there's a clear cost/benefit ratio here. Requiring a fire
suit would indeed scare away people. Even requiring *any* sort of helmet
would tend to thin the ranks. But contrariwise, you enhance the attitude
of the drivers by requiring some safety gear. I mean, if I'm wearing a 
helmet, it ain't toodling to work..... I think the cost/benefit of 
a fire bottle is worth it. As you point out, fires are rare, so the 
person makes a one time investment and then has the bottle for next
time! (or for extracting his/her spouse/kid/friend/etc. on the street....)

	Also, the biggest "safety" issue in most track incidents is
	extrication, not fire.  People
	have to get out of the car quickly in case there *is*
	a fire hazard.

As I pointed out, the fire bottle is there to give
you an extra 10 seconds in the event of a fire. 
	
	Yet we don't talk about leaving doors unlocked, or having
	all windows down (to climb through).

You should. Driver safety is something that every school or open track
I've ever seen has spent a lot of time with. You want to encourage the
right mindset, otherwise you invite trouble in a couple of ways. First,
they won't know what to do if they're in trouble. Second, they won't 
take the thing seriously enough so they'll be more likely to get in trouble
in the first place! The guy who stuffed his Conquest at Laguna Seca 
didn't show up to the safety meeting and sat in the back of the room 
wearing shades and looking bored when we discussed how to spin off the
track gracefully. The instructor asked him specifically if he would
like to join the group and he said "I know all this stuff." (yes, a 
direct quote.) He then did *exactly* the wrong thing and ruined his car 
because of his bad attitude. 

	Comments and flames are encouraged!
	
No flames, this is intended to be persuasion by reason, not argument.
It's a tradeoff. When I used to ride a motorcycle,
I always wore a helmet. Now, a helmet on a bike
won't save your life in a clear cut horrible accident, like getting 
run over by a UPS van. But it can save your life in some situations and
more importantly, it will keep you from being maimed in a non-life
threatening situation.....likewise a fire bottle can help prevent you
from getting 2nd degree burns on your hands and face as you climb out....

Yours for quality track time,

Your point of the extinguisher being used as a time-extender is a good one.  It
can be nice to have an extra 10 seconds to get out of a burning car (except, see
below).

A Halon 2.5 lb bottle with metal discharge nozzle and bracket is about $40-$50
mail order, and more in stores, plus installation if the driver can't do it
him/her self.  It's not too bad for most people, but it's just another expense
on top of a helmet, etc for a beginner.  I certainly wouldn't trade my potetial
safety to save so little money.

There's an implication in your discussion that needs further examination.  The
idea of the extinguisher giving you a few extra seconds is nice, but not as
valid as it first appears.  That's because it takes you several seconds, maybe
5-10, just to get the thing out of its bracket, pull the pin, aim and shoot. 
And remember that you've (possibly) just had an accident or are slowing down
from a high speed, so you don't have full concentration.  I'd rather spend my
time getting out of the car than fiddling for the fire bottle.

I agree with you completely that everyone *should* have one, but is it worth
*requiring* it, considering all the afore-mentioned arguments?  The little
squirt of halon and the difficult getting it isn't like a permanent,
"professional" system where you just hit a button and the thing shoots through
plumbing all over the car.  But I think that some people treat the extinguisher
as if it were that easy to use.

Anyway, these are all just open thoughts on the subject.  The feedback is useful
and helps illustrate other ideas and opinions.  Thanks for your input!

Subject: Rusty Exhaust: how to treat?
To: porschephiles@bcm.tmc.edu
Date: Tue, 6 Nov 90 17:05:39 PST
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

This weekend I removed the pushrods and tubes from my '74 914 2.0

It wasn't too difficult - I removed the exhaust system to get it
out of the way and was able to remove all of the rods and tubes
without lowering the engine.  (Many thanks to all who gave advice
about replacing the pushrod tube seals...)

I figured that while the exhaust system is out, I might as well
treat it for rust.  It's uniformly rusty, but solid (no holes or
pits)  I'm looking for advice on what to do to keep it from getting
worse.  I presume I should go at it with steel wool or a wire
brush (on a drill?) and then paint it with something.  How far
should I strip it down & what should I paint it with?

I'm talking about the muffler and the two heat exchangers.

Thanks,

Subject: What's Wrong with this car?

I just sold an 1985 1/2 (the new dash and insides) in Dallas for $13K.
>From the sound of it, my car was in much worse shape.  I had about 67K
miles and a lot of cosmetic flaws (cracked dash, door pings, etc).
Plus my tires were almost gone.  I did have mega-sway bars and a super
slick CD player but that didn't seem to matter much.  My trick for
selling the car was "owner financed" and that made a big difference in
the phone traffic for the car.  Loans for used cars are harder to get.
In Dallas, $10.5 is a fair price.  (Mine was priced at $14K, I had
hoped to get $12K and figured $10K was fair.  Lets just hope the guy
can make his payments now :-)

Subject: File Extinguishers

Not knowing anything about the topic, I was a little surprised that
the file extinguishers you guys are talking about require the driver
to get it out of its bracket, pull a pin, aim, shoot, etc.

If Halon gas is all that it is cracked up to be, then I would assume
that one, two, or at most three jets in the right places would kill
any fire.  Especially since the car is reasonably air tight except at
the windows (i.e. its not like your driving a dune buggy or
something).

I think I would be tempted to mount it on the side passenger's seat
back with the nozzle pointed down towards the driver's lap.  The idea
being that you are trying to flood the floor with Halon gas.  If you
can split the spray and hit both floors, all the better.  Rig it so
that it will discharge when a pin is pulled.  So when you hit the
wall, you pull the pin and head for the door.  As a final trick, add a
fire detector to discharge it in the case where the driver is
unconscience.

Also, I would assume (although I've never seen it) that if the gas
tank blows, you're in a heap of hurt and a little bottle of Halon gas
won't do much good anyhow.

Am I totally out to lunch? -- hot dogs anyone?

I thought the book was good in terms of interior or body work.  It
was a great help when I replaced my rear glass.  The mechanical portion
of it isn't so great...

It also recommends Slick 50 right before the mechanical section, if that
is any indication of their mechanical expertise (heh).

Cc: porschephiles@bcm.tmc.edu

 If it's rusty it's going to give out sooner or
 later. Don't bother wire brushing it, you'll just
 thin the metal and give the rust nice new metal
 to oxidize. Use a rusty metal primer (from Rustoleum
 paint, available at Scherba's on El Camino in Menlo Park
 or a cold steel galvanizing spray). Do this after
 hot tanking the parts in solvent (to remove all the
 built-up oil).

 Forget it. Just scrap it and order some stainless
 steel heat exchangers from Mid-Engine Mania in
 San Luis Obispo. 805-549-8525. They can get them to
 you for $185 each (sale price). Really good buy.
 Internal diameter is slightly larger than stock
 so you get a mild performance increase.

 Then put on a Bursch exhaust and you'll be one happy
 puppy. Forget Anza and Monza crap. Gone through at
 least three of those exhaust systems (they rust out
 QUICK). I've seen some figures which say they actually hurt
 your horsepower.

 Best of luck.

Subject: '91 944S2
Message-Id: <54901107034645/0004056890NB1EM@mcimail.com>

I saw a '91 944S2 on a dealer's lot this AM.  The changes are minor:

  1. The rear air dam as it appeared on the '90 Euro turbo.  Solid loop above
     the window.

  2. Redesigned rear wiper (huh?)

  3. Different radio (Zzzz....)

The front PU valence is unchanged, and is not as expected from the spy photos
(and the Ricoh give-away ad: see pg. 83 in the 29 Oct Forbes).

Production of the current 944 series is to cease permanently in December of this
year, we are told.  They will be replaced by a car with a new chassis, and a
six-cylinder engine (and that likely a V, since the boxer won't fit).  Porsche
will be building them 100% themselves, like the 911- and 928-series cars.

Out of the mouths of salesmen...

Message-Id: <20901107034602/0004056890NB1EM@mcimail.com>

The only quality harness installation I've seen in a 944-series car is Elizabeth
Ames', done for her by RST in Bow, NH.  They took the two shoulder belts back
through the horizontal split in the rear fold-down seat, and mounted them into
the rear deck.  Since the holes are under the removeable rear carpetting, no
damage, visible or otherwise, was done to the car.  The angle was right...

And speaking of angle, I believe the rule is that the shoulder belts cannot
incline at more than a 45 degree angle.  (I forget whose rule this is, SCCA or
PCA, maybe both.)  This rules out use of the bolt holes for the two-point rear
seat belts.  One idea I have not seen tried is a fixed bar between the two top
mounting bolts for rear three-point harnesses.  The harness would be attached to
this bar, much as it is attached to a real roll cage.  Anyone tried this?

Five- and six-point harnesses are wonderful.  But a good first step would be a
simple lap belt.

One other thing to try is a locking plate with the car's three-point belt.  This
is a simple piece of metal which cinches the inertial belt for you, sort of like
a D-ring belt buckle does.  Datsun (oops, Nissan) sells them for a few bucks a
piece, and they come with most child seats.  Instant three-point harness.

Subject: Re:  Rusty Exhaust: how to treat?

Look in your Yellow Pages (no, not on your workstation 8{) ) under
"Metalizing" or "Metal Treatments" or similar. What you're looking
for is a shop that can aluminize your exhaust. Should cost you 
about $150 to have the heat exchangers and muffler done. The process
involves sand blasting followed by spraying hot aluminum emulsion 
onto the metal. If you look at ads for "lifetime mufflers", you find
that's how most of them are treated...

I agree!  Quoting the obvious only exposes the seller as somebody who doesn't
know what they're doing.  That's why I'd suggest any potential buyer of such a
car to excercise caution...

Like you, I love (hate) the ads that say "944, elec. windows, right side mirror,
bucket seats, German made".  Duh.  It's more useful to say "sunroof, alarm,
Blaupunkt Shnitzel radio, 215/60-15 RE71's" etc. etc.

Perry, I think you're talking about permanently installed halon system in closed
race cars.  What you described is almost exactly what is done, in race cars.

In our street cars, we have little hand-held extinguishers that must be bolted
to the chassis (or rollcage, for the few who have them).  Our problem is very
different.

Kevin Gross mentioned what I forgot to be specific about - you can't mount to
anything besides metal.  The rear seatback, besides not being locked down, is
made of wood in 944s.  This won't do.  It's gotta be either the seat rails or
the chassis itself.

Well, the rear tires are the wrong size, and the hp is wrong - it should be 143.
 Funny for someone who quotes the torque to the 1/10 lb-ft.  The series I 944 is
much less desirable than the 85 1/2 series II.  Knock about $1500-$2000 off and
see if he bites.  But pay close attention - the tire choice alerts me to an
unknowing owner...

I'm not an expert, but I'd remove all the heavy rust and get down to solid,
fairly clean metal.  Maybe use a solvent to insure good chemical adhesion, then
use a special high temperature exhaust paint.  Try a good car parts place for
that.  You can get grey and brown/red, I believe.

To the Porsche Mailing List:


I am interested in obtaining contacts for two projects:

	1. . conversion of earlier cars to 4 wheel drive

	2. conversion of earlier cars from coupe to cab

The normal body conversion guys are well known to me.  I am more interested
in people who have performed these operations.  My design firm is working
on a computer controlled differential that we would like to put into the
front of 9 series (we are in Colorado, after all).

I personally, dismayed with 912 #555 complete lack of resale value, have
decided to cut off the top to match the '59 cab.  Initial investigation
yields "reinforce it to match a targa, and let it rip".

I'm also looking to diversify our minor manufacturing capability of very
high tech stuff.  Anyone with an idea for simple mechanical stuff to make
is invited to contact us.

	Hiya Porschephiles,

	As it becomes more and more obvious that to find a rust free Porsche
in my region will be impossible it appears that I will be searching
elsewhere for my 911. 

	This is the problem: I have no idea of how to go about buying a
car long distance. What do you ask? When do you go see it? How do you
find a mecahnic there to check the puppy? etc...

	Motorbooks (they are loving me at this point) has a book called
" How to buy or sell a car by long distance" by Adams Hudson. Does anyone
have any comments on this book. Perhaps suggestions for another book
elsewhere that does a better job that Hudson?

	Thanks again, in advance, for all your suggestions, Alex

ps many thanks to everyone who has responded to my earlier questions...

Alex, don't despair.  There are MANY nice cars all over the U.S.  Although the
concentration of them is higher in SoCal, they exist everywhere.  A good number
of people store their cars during the winter, so you can get a clean, rust-free
car even in New Hampshire.  In fact, it may have lower miles and less ozone &
sunlight degradation than a California car.  LA's air isn't exactly clean...

Late model 911s have zinc treated bodies, so you won't find much rust on them. 
It's really the older 911s and 914s that have problems.  Each car has specific
areas to look at, such as battery trays, rocker panels, A-pillars, sway bar
mounts, etc.  There will be a couple books on the subject, I'm sure.  It's best
to peruse the books in a store to filter the less useful ones out.

Also, use old fashioned common sense.  If you get serious about buying a car,
send the owner a few bucks and get him/her to send good color photos, with
close-ups in the trouble areas of the body.  Ask about maintenance and crash
history, and if the car's seen much track use.

Judge the overall appearance of the car cosmetically and mechanically.  If it
looks like the one you want, fly out and buy it!  It IS hard to buy a car long
distance, but with enough time and questions and phone calls you can do it.  I'd
suggest looking for the best car you can possibly afford, though - it isn't
worth all this effort and travel/expense to get an "OK" car.

One rule of thumb I've heard others mention and I've seen myself: the vehicle's
overall care reflects the owner's mindset.  If the owner is neat, organized, and
meticulous, then the car is likely to be in better shape.  If the owner is a
space shot, or appears to be more relaxed in maintaining his/her possesions,
then the car will probably suffer the same thing.  People are consistent in
behavior for the most part.  A clean, well maintained car is a better gamble
than one that's obviously a little worn.

Good luck on your search.  I hope you find something that is fun for you!

I have  recently purchased a  1973 914 (1.7).   It is a  very nice car
except last weekend we took it up to the mountains and nearly froze to
death.  Since  this  car is new  for me, and I  am only a very amateur
mechanic,  I was  wondering  if someone   knows anything  about   this
problem.  Is  it a problem or just  a weakness of   the  car?  You can
reply directly to me to save net congestion.  Thanks in advance.

	Hiya Porschephiles,

	Now that I have made the decision to BUY A 911, the thought of
insurance crossed my mind. So, I called up Allstate, and the guy interrupted
me before I even finished saying what year 911 it was with, "Sorry, can't
do it." Damn. 

	How, where do I go? I am a 22 single male (almost the worst possible,
you know :-)). What company doe you use? Are the prices unreasonable. I realize
that the rates are very location sensitive, but.... 

	Please someone tell me that I will be able to insure a Porsche 911.
(BTW I could insure a Honda CRX Si for a measly 4100 per year, PA is so
pathetic sometimes.)

	Thanks alot, Alex

Subject: Re:  Heater Problem (914)

The heaters on 914's, when working correctly, can melt most commonly
used metals 8{)  OK, so that's not quite it, but you get the idea.
If it's not working, you have (chose at least one)

* missing parts in the heated air path (flapper boxes, heat exchangers,
  the various bits of plumbing that connect it all up, hoses, etc)

* broken parts in the controls (cables, flaps, etc)

* the coolest running air-cooled engine I've ever heard about.

Based on experiences with my 914, I'd guess that you have missing
parts. Here's the drill: if you get oil leaks (and what 914 doesn't have
oil leaks?) you end up inadvertently lubricating the screws that hold some
of the sheet metal together, and when it vibrates (and what 914 doesn't?)
they, well, fall out. Causing the whole thing to be a bit more ventilated
than it might otherwise be. 

Suggestion: get a copy of the microfiche sheet that shows the parts of the
heater plumbing (you dealer can turn fiche into paper - usually) and 
get under the car and see what you're missing. It is less messy but more
expensive, but you could also take it to the shop and let them do it....

	Please try State Farm.  I was able to get great rates from them
for my 944S, as they are very competitive in this type of car.  In fact,
they went looking for *me* to tout their coverage.

I've heard good things on this list about State Farm.  Try them.

It sound's like you're gonna get killed on insurance!  $4100 for a $12000 Honda!
 That's crazy!  If I were you, I'd grow old, get married, and change my sex!

Do you have family or friends whom the policy could be written under?

A friend of mine here in Boston got a corporate insurance policy.  He had a
friendly agent do it for him, although he's not really a corporation.  You get
"fleet" coverage for all your vehicles and it helps a lot - the particulars of
each driver are hidden from the bean counters.  This is a little tricky but you
can certainly try it.

Subject: Re: Heater Problem (914)


Well, first of all, welcome to the wonderful world of 914's :-). The
first thing to do is to get down on your hands and knees and ... no,
not pray, but check under the car to see whether you have a heat
exchanger. If not, well    GET ONE! :-). Actually, that should be the
SECOND thing to do. The first one being to get a Hayne's manual for
the car, 'cos you're going to need it. Nothing against 914
mechanicals, mind you, but it's a lot more fun and cheaper to do
yourself all those little adjustments that are required.

If you DO have heat exchangers, the next thing to check is whether
you're actually using them (no offense intended, but when my dad drove
my 914 for the first time, he didn't even know it had heater controls
on the dash - not that they're hard to miss).

The next weak link in the chain is the blower motors that get that
wonderfully aromatic hot (well, warm) air into the cockpit. As I said,
the best thing to do is to get a manual and go through the debugging
routine. It's very straightforward. And don't believe people who tell
you that you can't get warm in a 914. I have driven mine in Montreal
winters without any problems. Good luck.

We may be talking different animals here, but I was 20 when I got my 914
in PA, and it wasn't any problem for State Farm at all (pretty cheap).
They seem to not care once the car is a particular age whether it's a
Lamborghini or a Yugo.  It also made no difference financially whether
we registered it in my name or in my dad's name with me as the principle
driver.  On the other hand, I had a friend from PA who
bought a 75 911S when he was 18 and the car was 11, and he paid about
3000 dollars a year in insurance.

Well, last year my 914 was less expensive than my wife's Beetle
to insure. We go for the "whole enchilada" -- liability, comp/collision,
glass, etc. so it's still pretty serious money for cars that age. We
also (based on a *NASTY* experience I had with State Farm some years ago)
only have "stated value" policies written for those cars. Sure, I have
to look harder to find an agent who can do it, and I wind up with some
strange companies (like Crum & Forester [a.k.a. Xerox Financial Services])
but it's worth it to *KNOW* that the car is really covered if anything 
happens.

For the 911, I just get full coverage on a "straight" policy. Ditto for 
the Hyundai Sonata. Intersting to note that the 911 insurance is only 
about $350/yr. more than the Sonata.....

For the next year, the renewal notice sez that my 914 and 911 will jump by 
about 50%, while the Beetle and Sonata stay the same. Looks like my insurance
company is trying to Darwinize me off of their rolls...

Alex,
	Believe it or not, I understand your quandry.  I went out at
age 25 (minus two months) and bought a 1980 928.  I had looked at
several sports cars and the "male driver under 25" clause really sucks.
I stayed with USAA where I had to pay $900 for the first six month
policy (some of that I got back once the bean counters figured out
I had turned 25) -- and that was with no points in two years, and
never an accident... Oops, better knock on wood for saying that...
Anyway, the moral of the story is you're gonna have to pay quite
a lot in insurance until you turn 25.  Sorry, it's unfair, but that's
the way it is.  The good news (if there is any) is that right now I
pay less than $700 a year (in South Carolina).  That will go to about
$1000 when I actually move to the Bay Area.
	To answer your question, I suggest you look at State Farm
or maybe Nationwide.  Allstate has always been too high from the
experiences of my friends (I have always been with USAA but they only
insure military officers, former officers, dependants, and former
dependants -- I now fill the last category :-) and the most obnoxious
part of it is that Allstate tends to drop people after an accident.  I
have to say that I'd refuse to talk to Allstate until they change their
attitude.  Try State Farm first: I have a 24 year old friend with a
1988 951 (944 turbo) that pays less than $1400 a year, with a speeding
ticket (55/30!).
	Good luck and enjoy your Porsche!

I had really good luck with the AAA (triple A or locally as the Southern
California Auto Club).  This was when I was 20 years old, 1 ticket and no
accidents.  They got me for $ 460 a year, with a permanent address in LA.  Oh,
the car was a '67 912, but I was told that 911 or 912 didn't matter as they
were treated the same.  Now I'm sure rates are worse now, but the only other
quote I got was for $ 1200 for 6 months from Century.  This was on my own, I
couldn't get insurance on my parent's policy (same company and same address).
 
Just my $0.02 worth...

My '72 911 costs about the same as my '81 Saab did. ~ $1100/yr.  I'm with
a company call Amica.  They're a bit more expensive than the average, but
well worth it when you make a claim (very little hassle).

I'm 29 and apparently I live in the most expensive zip code in the
Bay Area to insure (on the edge of Haight-Ashbury in SF). Or so they
told me.  If I lived where my parents live (central peninsula) it'd be
more like $600/yr.

Gulp!!! $4100!!! I insure a 944T for about $1K per year at State Farm.
I'm 32 but I have tickets.  Joe Bob says, "Check out Start Farm".

I'd put in my two cents for State Farm also.  Major cheap and great deductibles.
I'm now 26 UGH HOW TIME FLIES and my insurance for my '84 944 is around $600
and that's with $200 comp $500 collision (I'm suggesting that these numbers
have a great influence over the price.) In Irvine, CA back when I was young :-P
I was paying $900 for $1000/$1000 with low liability.  That was with Mercury
Insurance (I don't know if they're still around but they were by far the lowest
I could find.)  The whole time it's been like really important to have no tickets
and no accidents, pricewise that is...

All this talk is making me feel like buying a long term policy from State
Farm and then neglecting to tell them I'm living in California, when I get there...

BTW, all the car covers in the world don't help when the jerks in parking
lots don't know how to back out straight.  I've got a pretty little 

dent on my back fender.  Boy, some idiots...  Where did they learn to drive?
Let's go see what State Farm has to say about this one...

  I just finished talking to State Farm myself yesterday.  I had priced out an 
'86 944.  I learned this from a friend of mine that you should try to take 
advantage of the small loop-holes like multi-car discount, <100 miles per week, 
and using the 911 as a secondary, weekend car.  If my primary car was the 944, 
it could cost me something like $110 - $135 per month.  If I keep the 
squareback, make it my primary car (yeh right!), my insurance for the 944 is as 
low as $79. Insurance is such a rip-off, especially for those under 25 and not 
married.  You end up paying for the few mistakes that other people made in your 
age group.  Fortunately, I'm over 25 now and married and can now look at a 
sportscar without my wallet sceaming!

...heh, you haven't looked at my car.  It's got 3 orafices in it:
one for gas, one for oil, and one for money...it uses them all in
great quantities.

Perhaps you should rephrase that as "new sportscar" :^).

graduate? ah, then here may be another piece of info that will get you lower 
insurance :  When I was a student I got a further discount with State Farm
by being considered a good student.  You might want to check that out if it
still exists.  ( That was in Canada about 10-15 years ago )

Besides State farm possibly being the best for insurance rates, they are very
good when it comes to actually having a claim, I've found.

Cc: porschephiles@bcm.tmc.edu

>That's great!  Do you notice any variance across measurements?

Sorry, but I have been out of town (and therefore off the air)
most of this week.

I am sure my many measurements were unnecessary.  The main differences
occurred (as you might guess) before and after I cranked the engine
around by hand.  Although I tried to pretension the belt as best I
could when wrapping the belt around its various pulleys, it still took
a couple of turns of the crank to evenly distribute any slack around
the belt.

The other important trick (as you probably already know) is that after
you have cranked the engine around and back to TDC you have to turn
the crank backwards about 10 degrees (which corresponds to about one
and a half teeth on the cam pulley) in order to remove any uneven
tension induced by the cranking.  It was this part of the procedure
that my neurosis had me double and triple checking.  I once saw a
professional Porsche mechanic perform this operation.  He didn't try
to measure crank angle or count cam pulley teeth -- he just gave the
breaker bar he had attached to the crank nut a quick firm jerk to
unload the belt pretension.  My current procedure is therefore a
combination of "cranking" and "jerking/teeth counting" until I am
satisfied that there is no slack hiding out between a pair of pulleys
somewhere.

By the way, regarding the correct tensioning values Jim Selders
recently posted:

>The lower settings are the correct ones.  Porsche reduced the values when they
>came out with the improved belts a few years ago.  The new belts don't require
>the tension of the older ones.

Jim, to make sure we are all on the same page, could you please give
the numerical values of the "lower settings".  I would also be curious
to know which manual supplement or tech bulletin is the most recent
authoritative pronouncement on this topic.

I have had a bunch of positive feedback on my setupo, so here goes:

Sub belt:  remove seat and place just behind crossmember along front of
seat

Lf waist belt: remove seat belt attatchement and replace bolt with
harness eyebolt.

Rt waist bolt: drill a hole in the trans tunnel.  When bolt io removed,
carpet will obscure 3/8" (approx) hole.  Screw in eyebolt and make sue
to use the supplied big washers on underside of car;

Rear mounts:  Now THIS is the trick setup:

Remove rear carpet.
Look at the area by the drivers turn signal.
On angled sestion, 2 bolts can be placed.  These must be drilled fron
underneath.  Beleive it or not this can be done without removing the
muffler.  You may wish to drop it a few inches but it really isn't
necessary.  Again, use big washers but on BOTH sides of he sheetmetal.

This setup is the only one Ive seen which is safe (low angle of
seatbelt: no compression, can be run with the seat up or down, and which
hides the rear mounts when not in use.  You will need to use the long
sholder harnesses.  Also, you will need to remove rear carpet at the
track.

The following reprinted without permission from the "Windblown
Witness", San Diego Region PCA Newsletter, November 1990

...some of the juicy gossip out of Porsche AG... It seems that the
product development for the mid 1990's includes two instead of three
product lines and development of a full four seat and possibly "four
door" sports car to replace the 928.  This car could have a short
snout, large cabin and sports car shape.  The new, premium-priced four
seater is not destined to arrive before 1995.  That means a full 18
years since the intro of the 928 here in San Diego in 1977.  They say
the 911 (now known internally as the 964) will be around to the year
2000.  Sou you can figure that the 928 and 944 will drop out of the
line up around 1995.  The 944 will be freshened up for 1991 and will
feature a new front and rear end and some interior improvements and
more output from the 3.0 liter, 4-cylinder engine.  There is even a
rumor that the air-cooled six in the rear of the 911 could be replaced
by a narrow-angle V-8 that is being developed for the 928 and would
displace 3.5 to 4 liters, receive four-valve technology and develop up
to 400 horsepower...

Milo, I think the tension values you and Kevin emailed are the correct ones. 
They used to be at 4.0, or somewhere nearby, for new AND used belts.  Apparently
they reduced the second number to 2.7, so the belt can relax and have a long,
happy life after an initial stressing.

It's important to have a good, new version belt that's tensioned correctly.  But
it doesn't matter so much if it's 2.6 or 2.8, or maybe with some imperfect bit
of slack.  As long as the belt won't jump teeth, and isn't excessively tight,
then you'll be safe.  Of course, the belt also shouldn't resonate and hit the
belt cover, or be unstable at sustained high rpm.  But as long as it's good and
snug and stays out of trouble, it'll work.

What I'm trying to do is sooth some of the excitedness (?sp) that often
accompanies 944 belt tensioning.  It's only a problem if ignored or very badly
done.

While on the subject of timing belt tension... my friend recently got his
timing belt change in his 944T, after which he was told to come back after 
a few hundred miles to have the belt tension readjusted.

Is this necessary? should the tensioner automatically do this? did they do this
just to get more money out of him? I was appalled to hear how much the whole
job costs. I had my belt and the tensioner rebuilt in my Alfa GTV-6 for about 
$100, and I didn't have to come back the second time.

Subject: '89 951 changes

I was told that the '89 944 turbo engines are different than the
previous years.  What is the differences between them?  Do they still
have the "eat the second cam bearing" problem when the high
performance chips are used?

Thanks;
pedz

The '89 951s are basically the 944 Turbo S model of '88.  I believe there are no
differences other than the dropping of 'S'.  It has the 'S' chassis and 247 hp
engine.  And yes, it has all the "features" of the #2 bearing...  If you run
Mobil 1 15W-50, change it often, and replace the bottom-end bearings every 40
track days (60 hours or so), you should have no problem.  "Your mileage may
vary"...

They're not greatly changed from earlier years.  The horsepower was increased to
about 247 hp by, one would assume, making some of the same changes that the
AutoThority people did to the chips.  All sorts of fairly minor engine
improvements have been made over the years.  The '89 Turbos got improved exhaust
valves and stem seals, for example.

Outside of the engine, it got hardened 1st and 2nd gears in the transmission,
and a slightly different limited slip diff (I forget the changes).  The big news
was the 928S4-heritage front spindles, rotors, and brakes.  In fact, some of the
parts are 928 parts.  The rear fenders got their lips folded to accomondate 9"
rims.

Well, I wish I had been smart enough to use Hemmings when I was looking
for my 356.  Instead, I paid an auto broker a commission for finding me
a car.  It turns out that he did read Hemmings, and located a nice rust-free
single owner car for me in Fresno.  I could have spent months looking
through want ads in local papers and the San Jose Mercury without finding
a similar deal.

I have a '89 951.  In the past 21 months (15000 miles), I spent (approximately)
at the dealers:

  $58 at 2500 miles (oil change)
  $90 at 7500 miles (oil change, etc)
 $310 at 15000 miles (whatever required for 15K)

  $70 for oil (valoline turbo) and filters for oil changes at home)

BTW, I'm in SF Peninsula area, California.

I contacted two different brokers.  The one I settled on was Bradford
Auto Consultants, (408) 394-7704.  Their charge is incredibly
reasonable: $200, payable if they find a car, and includes road testing
and mechanical inspection.  They specialize in finding used, classic,
and muscle cars.  While they are not Porsche specialists, they have a
lot of practical experience, and know the questions to ask.  They will
travel to see non-local cars for you, but of course that adds to the
cost.  The broker that I dealt with is Jerry Bradford.  His dad, Ace,
raced VW powered dune-buggies back in the 60's, 70's, and 80's (perhaps
he still does - the shop always has a couple in various stages of repair).
Prior to opening his own shop, he ran the used car repair dept. for
Wester VW Porsche Audi.  So, there is a lot of VW-Porsche experience
in the family.

BTW, I phoned Jerry on a Thursday.  By that evening, he had located
several cars that seemed to meet my specs, and had phoned the owner of
the car in Fresno that I ended up purchasing.  I took Friday off, drove
to Fresno, and bought the car.  Jerry was trusting enough to set up the
appointment for me without meeting me, without any contract between us.
I paid him the next week.  It is nice to do business with people like
that.

The second person that I contacted was Dave Terdy, who is the president
of the local PCA chapter, and who owns a business which specializes in
Porsche buying services.  He has a list of cars for sale, which is
available in either single copy or subscription service, and he has
developed a series of videotapes which offer pointers on what to look
for when buying a used Porsche.  His company is called Driven by Design,
and is located in Carmel (408-625-1393).  If Jerry Bradford had not
been able to deliver, I definitely would have gone this route.

Subject: 914 autox preparation

Note: this is going to the autox, porschephiles, and info-vw mailing lists.
Please direct your replies appropriately, to some combination of me, autox,
porschephiles, and info-vw.  Is 914 stuff inappropriate for info-vw?  Do all
the relevant people also hang out on porschephiles?

I just purchased a '73 914 2.0, which I plan to build into an autocrosser.
I have a number of particular questions, and then am looking for some
free-form help.

First of all, the car nominally has California emissions.  A 914 autox
specialist tells me that there's no difference between the CA cars and the
49-states cars, other than a sticker on the windshield saying that the car
passes CA emissions.  Can anyone else back that up?

The car is in excellent condition; no significant rust anywhere (the only
rust is on the surface, and it's at the back of the floor of the rear
trunk).  It is mechanically very strong, and compression reads 135 for #1,
#2, and #3, and 125 for #4.  It does seem to have a significant oil leak
somewhere, not sure where yet.  (I did just get it this past weekend.)  It
has approximately 103K miles on it, and basically nothing has been done to
it.  I have (almost) all the service records from the time the car was new -
the only significant work was new clutch and related parts and repacked CV
joints at about 70K miles.  Other than that, it's completely original, down
to the 165R15 tires (suggesting that it's never even been driven hard).

Now, I'm planning on keeping the car in Stock category for the '91 season,
and then moving to Street Prepared in '92.  I'm not wealthy, and would
rather not do anything twice.  It seems to me that the smart move is to do
everything that's legal for both categories, and leave everything else
alone.  The particular help I need from Team.Net (the autox people) is
creating this list, and then I need help determining if the stuff that's
missing is important.  Note: for those who aren't aware, in Stock most
things must be off of a '73 914 2.0.  In Street Prepared, I can trade just
about anything between any 914 2.0 and any 914-6, regardless of year.

For instance, I will probably want to replace all the suspension bushings,
since they're 100K miles old.  But in Stock, they have to be stock rubber
bushings.  In Street Prepared, I can use harder rubber or something like
that.  Do I want to do this twice?  What other things have similar issues?

Here's what I've come up with so far:

Engine: Fortunately, I believe the engine internals will be the same for
	both categories, and only the intake, exhaust, and distributor will
	change.  So I should build the engine this winter, because it's the
	same for both?  True?

Gearbox: Leave it untouched for Stock.  Next year in SP, I know that the
	914-6 gearbox had different ratios.  Are they better?  Also, aren't
	all the 914-6 gearboxes the rear-linkage models, while the 2.0's
	have the (better?) side-linkage?  In SP the linkage can be
	modified.  Is there anything that can be done to make it less vague
	with either box?  I would definitely shorten the throws.  I'd also
	try to find a good limited slip in SP, preferably a Torsen.  Are
	these available for this gearbox?

Suspension: In Stock, all I'll do is put in the Koni's and play with sway
	bars.  The car has the factory-optional sway bars; do I want both of
	them in Stock?  I can use any front bar, and can use either no rear
	bar or the factory-optional one.  Suggestions?  In SP I'll want
	lower rear springs, stiffer front torsion bars, and harder bushings
	(including steering bushings).  Struts and sway bars will remain the
	same.  How about stress bars?  What should I do about the suspension
	bushing question?  Replace them now and then replace them again
	later?  Is this a big deal?

Interior: Probably won't touch it for Stock, other than maybe changing the
	steering wheel.  Are there any fully padded and upholstered racing
	seats that will fit for SP?  It's awfully tight...  Any other common
	interior mods?  I'll put 5-point harnesses in both seats.  No roll
	bar or roll cage, if I can help it.

Wheels: It currently has aftermarket 15x5.5 wheels (the stock size), which
	I'll probably keep for Stock with 205/50-15 tires.  In SP, I assume
	I'll want the GT/916 fender flares, and maybe 225/50-15 on 8.5" rims
	up front and 245/45-16 on 9.5" rims in back.  True?  Or should I
	stick with the stock fenders and go with narrower tires to keep the
	car narrow?

What am I missing?  Do any of you SP people have complete lists of
everything you've done to the car?

Any and all help is appreciated.  I'd like to keep a list of people who are
good contacts for these sorts of questions...  If you're available for help
please let me know.  Thanks!

Yes Steve, your friend should come back after about 1000-2000 miles to get the
belt retensioned.  The tension must be reduced after an intial stretching /
break-in period.  He should NOT come back in "a few hundred miles"; this is too
soon.  I believe the number that Kevin Gross and Milo Dorr quoted was 2000
miles.

Tensioning the belt costs about 2 1/2 hours of labor at our local dealer; belt
replacement costs another $200-$250 if I recall correctly.  I know, $400 sounds
a little high for two new drive belts.  You're right, it is obscene!  I just 
bought a cam belt for a Rabbit/Golf/Audi for $6, and it'll last >75K miles!

Kevin points out the difference between the '86-'88 944 Turbo and the '88 944
Turbo S / '90 Turbo.  Note that the '89 "944 Turbo" *is* a "Turbo S"-type car. 
The lower-power engine, original brakes, and other pieces were no longer offered
in 1989.

The old 944 Turbo chassis (brakes, mostly) now appears as a 944 S2.

I heard news of a new Porsche model from a [usually well informed] sales rep at
a car show here last week.  Sounds like Porsche has secret products in the
pipeline to replace the 944 VERY soon.  He thinks it'll have a 4 cylinder
engine, but I've long heard rumors of a 6 going in.

Also, John Andretti's T-car was at the car show.  It is returning to Europe to
an unknown life.  Maybe some bar in Stuttgart will put it on the wall, and serve
Foster's beer from the fuel cell!

I'll summarize the maintenance costs for the models you quote:

1) 944's aren't too bad, as Porsches go.  That means several hundred bucks a
year if nothing much goes wrong.  Tires and shocks are expensive, but tune-up
parts are cheap.  The cam belt should be tensioned and examined for damage every
15K miles for maximum safety.  That will cost perhaps $100 in labor.

2) The 944S should be the same as the 944.  It's got mostly the same parts
except for the head.  The chain drive to the second cam is very reliable and
works wonders on the 4-valve 928s.  Again, keep after the cam belt.

3) The 944 Turbo is less reliable.  A number of them have turbo failures due to
oil leaking internally.  The drivetrain takes more power, so CV joints and
clutches wear faster.  The clutch guide sleeve fails routinely in 30-50K miles,
requiring about $1500-$2000 in labor to get to the clutch area.  The early
exhaust manifolds crack (these have mostly been replaced by Porsche with a
bellows-style expansion joint).  There have also been 3 fuel-line related
recalls on the car.  Some fuel lines leak/burst, causing a fire.

If you track any of the above cars, you can easily triple (or more!) your
maintenance cost, in addition to needing more brake pads and tires.  The 944
Turbos warp front brake rotors on tracks, unless you switch pad compounds.  944
Turbo brakes are the weakest point on the car.  Later models ('88 Turbo S, '89
Turbo) had 928 front brakes and these are much better.

BTW, if you get a model with air bags and they ever deploy, the repair cost is
very high.  The passenger side bag breaks the windshield, at about $1000.  The
bags themselves cost about $2000 or $2500 according to a very recent Autoweek
article.  So a minor bump that pops the bags could set you (or your insurance
company) back $3500, plus the scrape on your paint ($100).  Aren't air bags just
wonderful?

Opinions flowing freely,

I just finished (I hope) fixing some oil leaks on my 914 (pushrod
tube seals, valve cover gaskets) and I think I should have the
engine steam cleaned so it stops smelling like burnt oil & grease
and so I can locate other oil leaks more easily.

I have never had an engine steam cleaned - is there anything I should
know or do first?  Will it ruin the valve cover gaskets I just
finished putting in?  Other gaskets/hoses?  If I have to remove
fuel injection parts, then it might not be worth it...

I usually just take mine down to the coin-op car wash, select the
"engine cleaner" option, hose it all down, then after letting it sit
for a few minutes, hose it down with the high-pressure gun. 

Note that this is *UNDER* the car. You get all your electronics wet
if you do this for the top of the engine. I've done that, but be prepared
to do the usual stuff for reviving a wet engine....

P.S. Never cleaned the 911 engine. Partially due to no leaks, partially
     due to laziness. No concours here...

Ummmm. I also remembered something else: the smell may well be coming
from your heat exchangers, which do a spectacular job of retaining oil
spilled from the usual pushrod/valve cover/oil pressure sender/oil cooler
leaks. You may need to pull the heat exchangers, and clean them at 
the same time...

I have to second this. I currently have a friend's Isuzu I-mark in my 
backyard because the timing belt failed and he bent a couple of valves. 

It's going to cost him about $500 total to fix this, and it's that 
little because I pulled the head for him and will reassemble it 
when we're done for free.....

So check those timing belts, you overhead cam guys!

How did the valve adjust go? Steam cleaning is a very good idea at this

with foamy engine bright and Brake cleaning solvent for the really nasty
grime.

It won't require removing anything, and it won't ruin your valve cover
gaskets, either. But try a can or two of Foamy engine bright, or gunk,
or any other thing of a similar nature.....it might work well enough to
suit your purpose....

Yes, it is at Carlsen's in Palo Alto.  They seemed to be OK to me, though this
time they put quaker state rather than valoline turbo for me.  I can't tell
anything different before and after the service, so don't know if it really
worths the money.  I'll ask for a list of the things they do for 15K the next
time I go to Palo Alto.

My 951 used to "drink" oil like water until I switched to Valvoline turbo.
Does yours have the same symptom?  The dealer claims that's normal for
924/944/951; just keep adding oil every 600 miles or so.  With Valvoline turbo,
it was able to last for 5000 miles before I added 1/2 quart.

Ummm, I don't know if I can give you any more info than what you hear from
the streets.  However, I work in Compiler QA and know a few things on the

 Consider very carefully what cleaner to use on tranny.
 I seem to remember that Porsche cautioned one against
 the use of some solvents as they would corrode the

 Simple Green and a scrub brush and a lot of elbow

Liek Stefan, I stick to Simple Green and elbow grease.  In my 944S, I also cover
the brake fluid reservoir and distributor with a scrap of plastic and a rubber
band to keep the water out.  The "electrics" are pretty well sealed on the car,
in particular, the relay box and the battery.

Does anybody know from experience about the shift linkage on 73- 914
transmissions?  I've got everything else apart needed to drop the
motor, but the connection to the trans (with the ball joint) seems not
to have screws as the Haynes (heinous) manual shows.  So I don't see
how I can get this thing off.
By the way, there are (and will be for quite a while) many more parts
off this car I would like to sell.

To stefan: The trans is made of magnesium, I think, just like the engine case.

That's funny, the brand of oil shouldn't affect consumption much at all.  Use a
10W-40 for "normal" driving and a -50 for competition.

A quart every 600 miles is NOT normal, unless you're at the race track.  You may
have ring/valve guide problems, or the oil might be mixing with your water via a
bad water/oil intercooler or a blown head gasket.  Also, there could simply be a
leak, like at the back of the cam cover.

Simple Green also works wonders at cleaning oil, grease, and grit.

I did get an engine steam cleaned once, and I won't do it again.  It's so
effective that it removes undercoating, and attacks card/fiber- board.  If the
steam is left pointing at the edge of a gasket, I'm sure it will break it down
in a few seconds, due to extreme heat, water, and pressure.

I'd stick with what the others have mentioned - a good engine cleaner and a few
minutes of elbow grease.

Hmmmmmm.......perhaps instead of getting my race car tanked to get rid of 
all that, I should just rent a steam cleaner. Removing all that stuff
is *exactly* what I want to do......

But I'll pick up some simple green and use that on the motor and trans....

Some of `us' OHC guys use other methods to power our cams, towershafts with
bevel gears and chains to name 2.  They need care as well (chain tensioners
especially).

And don't forget that just because you don't have OHCs doesn't mean you don't

Hey, same here, and my previous experience was even worse, a Honda Civic and 
a Toyota 1-ton truck.  A few months after I bought the car, on one rainy
morning going to work, I had some hairy experience on the grease collected 
at the lights, slipping and sliding when making a left turn, and suddenly
the turbo came up.   I was lucky the curbs were really low; the left front
got up the center island, came down, and I over adjusted and got up to the
side walk on the right.  The car just stalled there.  Fortunately, I was able
to restart it right away and drive to work just a block away.  Nothing was
damaged except my ego.

Usually busy, but very interesting, and always lots of food.  Mips feeds
us free drinks and other goodies all the time.  Today we have a Chili cookout
also.  Don't worry about weight gain; Mips has gyms for us to work out
and the work load is always enough for the brain cells to burn plenty of
calories.  The stock price is disgusting, but it's great time to join here
to get a low option price.  Lots of openings in the Compiler group.  We'll 
split the referral fee, $1000!  Interested?

Subject: Re:  Hemmings...

Sorry if this is a repost.  I tried to mail this before and got no reply.
So I'm rewriting this in hopes of some advice.
First of all what is Hemmings?
I'm looking for an early model 60-65 Cab. and may have finally found one.
It's a 1960 (late) classified as a 61, 356 Cab. "95% restored".  The paint
was striped and any rust that existed was removed.  The car was repainted the
original porsche red.  New chrome,  0 miles on the rebuilt original engine.
The car does need new tires and wheels and to have the interior redone.  
The owner has the materials to replace the interior.  He has owned the car
for fifteen years and says he has invested $30,000 in the car.  He needs
cash for his business and wants to sell the car for $25,000.  He took the
car down South to try and sell, so I haven't seen it yet.  When he gets back,
if the car hasn't sold, I'm going to have it checked out.  What do you all 
think?  Is $25,000 too much for a "95% restored" 356 Cab?  What should I look
for?  The owner says all the numbers match and it doesn't have any rust.  What
else should I look out for?  Any help would be appreciated!
                  Thanks,
                      Lisa

"Hemmings" is Hemmings Motor News, a thick, comprehensive list of all sorts of
specialty vehicles, new and old, from all over the world.  It's an excellent
source if you're trying to locate a specific, unusual car.

I don't know anything about the car you're buying, so I can't be of any help. 
Good luck!

In addition to being an excellent source for buying cars themselves,
Hemmings has all manner of listings for parts and services for more
interesting vehicles.

For example, I have an 1959 Mercedes-Benz 220S sedan.  The car has a
Blaupunkt radio with tubes and seek tuning that no longer works, and
in Hemmings I found a man who restores such ancient equipment.  It's
an excellent source for hard-to-find parts, and for people who are
parting out cars.

The only drawback to it is that I can't seem to look through it
without drooling...one time I went through and added up the "asking
prices" of all the vehicles in which I was interested...I stopped when
the figure passed 2 million.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]

I've been trying to post this to rec.autos.tech but Pnews has been
giving me problems... Thought I'd ask y'all... thanks for listening!

=================

Recently I've been spending more time under my car than I'd like
(cleaning and fixing oil leaks mostly) and the grime is getting harder
and harder to remove from my hands.  I've been using Sta-Lube hand
cleaner with pumice and don't really like it.

Can someone recommend a better hand cleaner?  Also, I had a theory
that if I applied lots of hand lotion before getting under the car, my
skin would be less likely to absorb as much oil & grease from the
engine... seems to sort of work (I guess).  I was telling this to a
friend and she said she thinks there is some product you can put on
your hands before you start working that makes them easier to clean
when you're done.  Anyone know of such stuff?

Replies via email or post (or both)...

Thanks!

and it's available at most car parts places. It's basically
a latexy solution that you rub on and it dries and only feels
a little wierd....like a thin coat of gelatinous stuff on your
hands....once you're greasy and dirty, you'll never notice it.
But when you go to wash it off, the grease and ick just comes 
right off with soap and water.....assemble your car in the afternoon
and go shake hands with the pope that evening, no sweat.

Great stuff, both products are available at any major part palace.

Subject: Administrative Notice

This is just a routine announcement. I'm leaving Baylor just after
Thanksgiving to go back into consulting on a full-time basis. There 
should be no impact on this list, as I will still be maintaining it from
Baylor, just as it sits. 

However, if any of you happen to do something to cause mail to not be 
deliverable (like change to a different workstation name or have a site 
postmaster who changes things semi-randomly -- you know who you are!!), it 
may take an extra day or so for me to get things ironed out and get your 
mail flowing smoothly again.

The same holds for speed in processing subscription additions, deletions, 
or changes. 

Anyway, I just wanted you all to know up front.

Regards,

Stan

Subject: Need Seat Height Help!!!

OK fellow PorschePhiles, I need some help. I've been offered
a truly spectacular deal on a '86 Carrera sunroof coupe, and I'm
thinking about ditching the Targa and doing the deal. But wait: there's
a problem. 

I'm pretty tall. OK, by some standards, I'm real tall. And I have short
legs, so most off my height is from my hips on up. All of my Porsches
to date (except for a 356B) have been Targas, and with the relatively
mild Texas weather, I get to spend a lot of time with the top off. And
even on terrible days, the Targa top has a little extra room in it even
relative to the regular coupe.

My problem is that I need to lower the drivers side seat by at least an
inch and a half, preferably a bit more that two inches, if I'm going
to make this sunroof coupe deal work at all. I'm willing to cut, weld,
or even buy Recaro seats if that's what it takes. But I gotta do this
or ride around with my head hanging out the window (not acceptible).

So, if you know anything about my prospects along these lines, *PLEASE*
let me know. I want this car bad, but not bad enough to have vertebrae
removed...

Stan

P.S. If I do this, I can offer someone another truly spectacular deal on
my fire-breathing '81 European Targa, in case anyone is interested...

Subject: 356/912 european heater swap

I recently located a good running 912 engine which has a european heater.
I have been looking for a spare engine (mostly as insurance against the
growing lack of availability of repair parts at reasonable prices) for
my 64 356 C.

The owner claims that the european 912 heater is practically a bolt-on:
all I would have to do is run hoses to my front heater boxes and discard the
existing linkage rod for the rear heater box flapper.  He said that the
European heater system is always "on", meaning that air from the blower
is always pressurizing the system, and that it does a much better job
of heating the car than the export heating system.

I seem to remember der Maestro saying not to attempt the 912 heater box
swap into a 356.  But, he may have been referring to the 912 export
heater system...  

Have any Porschephiles done this swap, or know the details of what
is required? 

BTW, the engine is priced $500 less without the heater sytem than
with.

thanks -

  Dave Erickson

I just use ordinary heavy duty hand cleaner paste, without pumice.  It takes
lots of scrubbing when you're done, but it always works.  You should NOT wet
your hands before using it, for maximum effectiveness.

I've heard of a product called ?'invisible glove' that you apply before getting
dirty.  Try hardware/automotive stores.

Also, you could use thin Latex gloves, similar to doctor's gloves.

There is a product that claims to be an "invisible glove" for pre-application.
I've never tried it, but seen it on the shelves.

Alfa Ricambi has been advertising a hand cleaner called "Tarkelp" that claims
to have no petroleum contents. I'm going to order some next time I order and
will report back.

On the front page of the Wall Street Journal, Friday, 16-Nov, is a news blip
that Porsche placed an advertisment complaining about the new federal luxury
tax.  Their ad. says, "What will they tax next?  Sex?".

How do porschephile people feel about paying Uncle Sam more tax money for
purchases?  I think it's funny that they tax cars of $30K+, which hits a major
portion of up-market, but not luxury, cars but doesn't tax boats until $100K. 
I'm not a boat person (ahem), but doesn't that seem a little out of balance?

Well, about the higher limit for boats.....you gotta figure that a lot
more people are going to buy those cars, which is what the gov't 
*really* wants to tax...they jsut have to throw in boats over $100K
(which covers most commercial boats that people use to earn their
livelihood, but not most pleasure yachts) to maintain the illusion 
that the rich are going to be taxed for their luxuries.

Hi, porsche-phans.  I know this isn't a 'porsche' question, but feel that
one or more of you may know something about this.....

We've just moved from Reno with a '89 Toyota Celica (with Federal, Canada and
Australia, but no CA emissions certification) and are about to register it.
I heard from a AAA rep that CA has instituted a $300 penalty for registering
previously-out-of-state vehicles that don't have the 'CA Emissions' sticker.

Supposedly this is the case EVEN IF THE CAR PASSES CA SMOG TESTS!!!!!!!!

What gives?  I can appreciate CA trying to clean up its (our) air, but to
penalize someone WHOSE CAR PASSES CA SMOG sounds arbitrary and punitive to me.

Anyone out there able to clarify this?  Help, suggestions appreciated.

I gave the new luxury tax some thought, and don't have a problem with it.
If we all try to draw lines around things that we love to protect them from
taxes, pretty soon there's nothing left to tax. Now while I'm a big proponent
of the notion that "no government is good government", as long as we're gonna
have one, and it's gonna tax us, we might as well be equitable about it.

It's kinda like what my wife says about eating out "If you can't afford
to tip reasonably well, you can't afford to eat out." If I can afford
the car, I can afford the tax.

Subject: CA smog ripoff

I heard from a AAA rep that CA has instituted a $300 penalty for registering
previously-out-of-state vehicles that don't have the 'CA Emissions' sticker.
What gives?  I can appreciate CA trying to clean up its (our) air, but to
penalize someone WHOSE CAR PASSES CA SMOG sounds arbitrary and punitive to me.
	
Anyone out there able to clarify this?  Help, suggestions appreciated.
+++++++



Well, I can clarify it for you, but you won't necessarily like it. They're
trying to remove old cars from the road. Specifically, they want you to 
buy a new car that does have a CA emissions sticker.....

I suspect that the auto companies are behind it, but I have no proof, and
no desire to look like a conspiracy theorist....

So pay your money and think about moving to Oregon, like I'm trying to do.

Subject: Re:  Administrative Notice

Stan,
	First and foremost, let me say thanks for putting in the extra work to
keep the list going.  I know I'm really enjoying the articles that come across,
and I sure don't have the time to administrate a list, so I'm very glad that
you're doing the work.  :-)  Second of all, I admit to being one of the guilty
who was at a site where sendmail configs got modified a lot for quite awhile as
the sysadmins were trying to figure out how to get the MX records working...
However, I am now at a different site, and I'm pretty sure I won't be the cause
of any more trouble.  :-)

Cheers,

Phellow Porsche Phreaks, 

A while back, someone posted a place (I think it was wuarchive) and
I was able to load some really great porsche pictures. 

Well, my computer died and took with it all my great pics. So
if you remember how to get to this wuarchive machine, please send
me the information, because I'd like to restore my photo archives. 

Thanks,

BTW: does anyone know how to separate all the info-vw, porshcephiles, other

but is there a program that will automatically save them to info, porsche

Mellow out, Ron.  I don't know about you Porsche People, but us VolksWagon
Volks try to take life in stride.  Anyway, we got the newgroup message
here recently (yesterday, or maybe the day before?).  Besides, the way I
understood it, the mailing list was never intended to go away, but to be
bi-directionally gatewayed to the news group.

May your valves never crash, and may you never run out of diesel fuel
on the entrance ramp to the Whitestone Bridge.

Stan -

Well, shoot, I'm here.  There just seems to be a temporary dearth of
controversies to stir people up here.  Perhaps we should import some from the
autox list, currently featuring:

 - the pros and cons of left foot braking,
 - mechanical vs. electronic tachs, and
 - fun with rev limiters.

Or perhaps discuss the eligibility of new Mercedes 500-series owners for PCA
membership.  I mean, Porsche did do the engine and assembly for them, right?

Of course, no news is better than a discussion of the merits of synthetic
lubricants (comparative sense, not superlative).

 Hi Stan, and anyone else out there,

  We haven't met, my name is Mike Steffen and I live here in Germany,

  land of beer, blondes and of course PORSCHEs.  I've been reading the

  net for a couple of weeks, and this is the first time that I've

  sent anything in.  Amoung other things, I'm the technical and safety

  chairman for Porsche Club of America - Germany Region and a rather

  hard-core autobahn and slalom racer. (What else would you expect 

  from someone after living in Germany for 14 years !!)
 

  Well, let's see if this gets to you and any of the other folks on

  the net.  Who ever is running this thing now please let me know if

  I can help or assist.

Hi all,
  as I'm new to this list allow me to introduce myself; my name is
Richard Cole and I live here in England.  I am currently in the process
of restoring my 1972 911 E.  This project has taken rather more ellapsed
time than I would have liked (the car has been off the road for nearly 3
years) and I am definitely suffering withrawal symptoms :-)  I hope to
be back on the road in the spring.

  Now a request - I have heard of a company in the 'States called, I
think, Stodards (I may be wrong though) which specialise in bits for the
older cars like trim etc.  Anyway, if anyone can enlighten me with an
address of this (or any other well thought of company) I would be
grateful.

OK. Well, we said we needed some discussion, so I will start.

I'm a neophyte driver. I admit it, and really, I don't mind. The
time will come when I'll be proficient.

In the mean time, I've been triving a 944T for about six months now,
and have got the hang of daily driving. I am interested in attending
one of the "Technical Driving Schools" such as the one offered by
Porsche in New Hampshire next summer.

But before I do that... I'd like to figure out some more "advanced"
maneuvers. A friend of mine drives and restores old Chevy Z's... She
told me about a method of slowing down smoothly called "heel and
toing it" but this doesn't seem to be feasable with the pedal
arrangement of the 944. Is this true or are my 10 1/2 feet too small?

On a slightly different track... What do you guys have to say about
the Porsche (and perhaps other) driving schools?

Doug

Mike, you didn't say what model Porsche you drive, but if you have any
information regarding the availability and cost of 356 restoration parts 
in Germany, I'm sure there would be some interest among the Porschephile
readers.  Are there any good mail-order sources of parts that might be 
worth investigating?  Are there any good European English-language magazines 
devoted to Porsches?

Excellent!  It's too bad that the rest of the world doesn't share your

I don't know what the pedal arrangement of the 944 is like, never having
driven one, but you can heel-and-toe in just about any car.  Not that it's
easy in every car, just that it can be done.  Sometimes you have to really
contort your foot, almost make it horizontal.  In an Acura Integra, the foot
is almost horizontal with the heel on the brake; in a Fiat X1/9 it's almost
horizontal with the heel on the throttle (and I personally find it somewhat
painful to hold my foot in that position).

It takes a lot of practice.  I have size 8AA feet, and if I can do it...

I am not familiar with the pedals on a 944. The 911/912/914/VW Beetle
layout, however, is the one that makes the term "heel and toe" actually
meaningful: you actually toe the brake pedal, and you actually heel
the gas. This is because the gas pedal goes right down to the floor,
where your heel can reach it.

Most "modern" cars don't work that way (THEY ARE WRONG (imho)), you
use the left side of your right foot for the brake, and the right
side for the gas. This is "not a good thing" because it means that
the tolerance for pedal activation height is much lower: the brakes
have to "come on" at about the same level at which the gas pedal
changes from "decelerate" to "accelerate", since (most people's)
feet are longer than they are wide.

I just attended my first PCA-sponsored 'drivers education' event at Road
Atlanta a couple of weeks ago. Absolutely exhilarating! $125 for two days (3
20-25 minute sessions each day). Had an instructor in the right seat each time
- great feedback. I knew immediately what I was doing right (and what I was
doing wrong). There's an incredible satisfaction when everything clicks and one
turn sets you up for the next... Hard to describe. I was really struck by the
difference in sensation a flat out acceleration on the track compares to on the
street. When my turbo kicks in on the street, it feels like someone is kicking
me in the pants - on the track, I almost always felt underpowered (mumbling to
myself "more, more, more..."). And this is pedal to the floor, full boost
acceleration, something I rarely if ever do on the street.

I've been told that this is something you have to be shown how to do - it's
hard to describe. My instructor thought it best to concentrate on the basics
(driving the line, avoiding early apexes, avoiding engine braking, getting a
feel for how to control an insipient skid, getting confortable about driving
balls out into a turn etc.) before worrying about heal/toe
braking, etc.

>On a slightly different track... What do you guys have to say about
>the Porsche (and perhaps other) driving schools?

Join the PCA and drive as many events as you can (if you can't tell, I'm
addicted - I knew I was going to have fun, I just didn't realize _how much_
fun). I've heard that autocrossing is an excellent way to learn to control your
car at relatively low speed. I've not yet had an opportunity to attend one...

Again, I don't know about the pedal arrangement on a 944, but if I can
do it in a Golf (heel and toe, that is (-:), it can be done in ANY
car! You might have to do something like left-side-of-the-foot-
right-side instead of heel-and-toe, but it can be done. As John Lupien
wrote, however, my 914 (and a friend's Beetle) seems to be made for it.
The pedal arrangement is perfect.

On another note, and at the risk of starting a flame war, (but I know
that people on the mailing list are much more mature than the general
newsgroup readership, right?) it seems to me that the general
consensus is that heel-and-toe is NOT to be used as a means to slow
the car down. This is better left to the brakes. H-and-t should only
be used for smoother shifting (mainly downshifting). Anyone? Anyone?
Anyone?

Track time is difficult to describe to someone who hasn't done it.  The
problem is that it is addicting, even if you're driving a car (quite an
admission from a motorcycle nut :-).

This is often very confuseing, and I think bikes and cars treat the problem
the same, but the terminology gets reversed sometimes.  I usually say that we
_try_ to get an early apex, that is to say, get slowed down early enough that
you do _most_ of your turning early in the corner and get back on the throttle
early.  A late apex is where you go wide on the exit because you overcooked
the entrance.  I think the confusion somes from whether people refer to the
bike (oops! vehicle) apex (the actual turning) or the _road_ apex (where the
vehicle comes closest to the inside edge).
 
Now, I maybe the one who has it backwards, and I'd like to hear other opinions
on the matter ("besides, what the h*ll does a motorcyclist know anyway?!?").

Auto-X is another excellent place to learn vehicle control.  It also has the
added advantage that if you screw-up, then all that happens is that you kill a
few cones (physical damage anyway, ego suicide is another story).
 
Just my opinion...

Heel and toe is used for shifting, on that I will agree.
However, it is useless to pretend that the engine has
no role in slowing the car. The engine can profitably
be used to modify the brake bias forward or back, at need.
This is not usually important, but when it is, it can make
a big difference. For normal driving, using the brakes to
slow down makes a lot of sense, since it's a lot easier to
replace brake pads than engines.

To clarify the question somewhat: Not specifically heel-and-toe, but engine
braking, is what we don't want to use to slow down the car.

Right, the brakes were designed for slowing the car, and so they're the
proper thing to use to slow down.  Engine braking is not the root of all
evil, however.  It's just not that good for the engine (thought not
catastrophic), and certainly not nearly as effective as the brakes.

Right again, the purpose of heel-and-toe is to have the car already in the
proper gear for when you're ready to get off the brakes and back on the
throttle, smoothly.

The point at which you begin to turn is referred to (in most cases)
as the "turn-in point". The apex of a turn is where your vehicle
reaches its nearest point to the inside of the track (where your
knee guard catches grass, on a bike). If you over-cook the entry
to the turn, the closest you get to the inside of the track may be
your turn-in point (a very early apex indeed) and you either have to
make what should have been a single turn into several, or pick yourself
up out of the bushes. It is not always a bad idea to early apex: racing
situations can make it almost mandatory. The USGP of motorcycles last year
(I think it was last year) had the eventual winner going inside the 1st
and 2nd place runners at the same corner with two almost identical passes,
where he made the turn into two turns, taking the apex of the first
exactly as he got inside the other bike. A late apex is usually better
if there's nobody in the way, because it lets you make the last part
of the turn on the gas.

I think you are indeed the one who has it backwards, but your point is well
taken.  In every driving school I've taken, every book I've read, and with
most of the racers I associate with, the apex is the point (or area) at
which the vehicle is closest to the inside of the turn.

I have no comprehension of what you call the "vehicle apex"...  Maybe that's
when the vehicle is cornering at its hardest or something?  Maybe it's just
a bike term and that's why I don't understand it.

Now, the terms "early" and "late" are a little wierd.  In order to achieve a
late apex, you must turn later than for an early apex, yet this can be said
that you are setting up early.  Similarly, if you get behind ("late") in a
series of esses or in a slalom, it's because you're turning in too early
(apexing early).

Once again, to achieve a late apex, you set up early (staying wide and
turning in late), so that you can get on the throttle earlier.  It is, as
you say, somewhat confusing until it becomes second nature.

I heartily agree that heel and toe operation is ONLY for smooth downshifting.
It is only used when you anticipate needing a lower gear, typically after
deceleration for a corner.

Downshifting should NEVER be used to slow a car!  This is a hold-over from
the early days of racing, when drum brakes weren't too good and it was OK to
sacrifice the machine to win the race.  Brake pads are cheaper than clutches!

Also, downshifting causes the driven wheels to act like weak brakes, and can
induce a spin on slippery roads.  I know a guy with a Z-28 [bash, bash] who
was going too fast and decided to slow by downshifting.  It was autumn in
New England, so he drove over wet leaves and the rear [braking] end swung
around. He went off the road and flipped the car.  Moral: just use the
brakes.

Subject: Some discussions ...

Toufic wrote that H-and-T is used only for smoother shifting.  I think
what he meant is that h-and-t is used for smoother shifting while
braking.  I'm still a total novice at this but my assumptions were
that the h-and-t trick was used to match rev's so that the downshift
did not cause an added, and unexpected, braking force on the back
tires which could cause them to break loose.

With my old 944, I still used the brakes and the clutch to stop
especially on wet streets.  The idea was that I would brake until the
front tires broke loose (or just before) and then brake with the
engine (via the clutch) until the back wheels were about to break
loose.  Well, actually it was a game of breaking the front and then
the back and then the front by applying more and then less clutch.
This is just something I sorta thought up on my own and have no idea
if it is a valid technique.  Its not much different than "steering"
with the throttle alternating between understeer and oversteer.  It
seemed to work though.  The new ABS makes this trick unneeded for the
most part -- especially since I was only able to do it when I was
practicing and never really could do it when I really needed it.

All this aside, I've always wondered how good is a good race car
driver?  Do they use these tricks 99% of the time or not?  Also, I
often wonder how consistantly a good driver can recover from a spin.
Or do they simply know the limits and avoid the spins in the first
place.

	I've been told that this is something you have to be shown how
	to do - it's hard to describe.

I've got a couple of large articles saved previously posted to this list about
double-clutching/heel-and-toeing.  I'll mail them to anyone interested.
They are a bit large to post to the entire list I think.

I think where I first learned heel-and-toeing was a book called 'High
Performance Driving' by Bob Bondaurant (sp?) which unfortunately is stored
in a box 6000 miles away right now.  I thought the book quite good and
it had pictures to go along with the description.  You can find where to
order it ( Classic Motorbooks? ) from ads in Road&Track.

concerning engine braking: Bondaurant said that in the past it was used alot
more but now-adays brakes are so much better and engine braking wears your
engine.

This book made me think alot, because up till then I had a dirt-bikers 
atititude of coming out of corners.  ie: go nuts and get on the gas.
Bondaurant explains how you don't wanna do this in a high performance car
and talks about the shifting weight on each wheel as you are accelerating
or braking. (I'm not explaining this very well). So now I had more than 1
or 2 wheels to worry about...

p.s my 912 has a beautiful pedal arrangement for heel-and-toeing.
p.p.s I wonder how many people are on this list...

To oversimplify quite a bit, race drivers will always use threshhold braking
and heel-and-toe downshifts when a downshift is necessary.  To remove the
simplifications, sometimes they'll left-foot brake, sometimes they'll
downshift without the clutch, etc.  Sometimes, being human, they'll even
lockup a wheel or two while braking, miss a shift, etc.

Someone with lots of experience in catching spins will almost always be able
to catch a slow one, especially if you know it's coming because it's caused
by a mistake you made.  Practice makes perfect.  Racing means always driving
at the limit of adhesion - the idea is to stay right at the limit.  Again,
being human, this means that sometimes you're under it and sometimes you're
over it.  The fast way to drive a car on dry pavement is never to slide, but
catching spins is definitely part of the game.

Ok you guys, back to geometry class!  When we drive and talk about cornering,
we use the corner as the geometric reference and alter the vehicle's path to
"do the right thing".  The word "apex" refers to the corner, and specifically
the well known "inside" part of the turn.  That's what an apex is.  Imagine a
"V" drawn from the turn-in point, to the apex, and to the track-out point.
That's how the term's been used for the last umpteen years!  I can't imagine
why another motor vehicle group might use another interpretation!  This is
sounding like religion...

I do use engine braking in one circumstance: when I'm coasting to a
stop.  In a Motronic car, a closed throttle and RPM over about 1200 shuts the
fuel flow off completely.  This saves gas and helps drop engine temperature
for a moment.  If you do this before exit ramps on highways, just think of
all the brake wear and gas you'll save!  Unless, of course, you're like me
and see every off-ramp as just another challenge...

Aside from the above use, which is really just "coasting" and not
downshifting to decelerate, I'd never use engine braking.  Balancing the
brake bias with it is a scary thought - it's much too hard to control to the
precise level needed, and you can only _increase_ braking at the drive axle,
not the other (front) end where 2/3 of the braking force is.  If the brakes
are so out of balance that this trick actually helps, then get a bias
adjusting valve!

The 2 of the 3 track schools I've been associated with (3 of them, more later)
have all done something similar, we also usually mark some sort of a brake
marker, just to provide a reference for initiation of braking.

This is something else again.  Setting up is always done to maximize the exit
speed onto the next straight.  So being inefficient in the first corner of
series is _usuallY- a good thing, provided it places you in the correct place
for the exit of the last corner.

Now both Mark and John say that the `apex' is defined as the point where the
vehicle track approaches the inside of the corner the closest.  Bike racers
call this a `false' apex or a `track' apex.  (I'm trying to explain this the
way it was taught to me, I'll get my references tomorrow.)  If there were
infinite asphalt everywhere, then this definition has no meaning, even if the
turn is geometrically the same.  So then the mathmatical definition of `apex'
is where the turn radius is the smallest (or absolute value of the 2nd
derivative is largest).  This point in the vehicle path occurs long before the
inside edge of the track is approached.  Now you say, "but the track is
causing the path to be such".  True, but any number of conditions can make
that particular path the optimum.  Once the optimum path is selected, ignore
the track, stick with your own game plan.
 
The track schools where I have heard this were:
 
California Superbike School
Kawasaki's `Ticket to Ride'
American Federation of Motorcyclists
 
And the references I offer are (I'll check on these tonight):
 
Motorcycle Road Racing: Art and Science
A Twist of the Wrist
Soft Science of Motorcycle Road Racing
A Canyon Racers Guide to Fast Street Riding
 
So _I_ believe that we are saying the same thing.  I just think we call it
something different.
 
But then, just my opinion...

 That's because you're being car-centric. In motorcycle racing,
 the term apex refers to the point at which you flick the
 bike over and begin your drive out of the corner. Given that
 with a bike there are many more lines through the corner,
 I can see how car drivers could become confused at the difference
 in terminology.

 When we speak of "late-apexing" a corner it's because there
 are two general forms of taking a turn in use in motorcycle
 racing right now. There is the "late apex" (in which the
 turn taken by the bike follows a parabolic arc), where you continue
 straight for longer, braking harder, and then flick it over
 and drive out of the corner (often clipping the interior
 apex of the turn on the drive out) and then there is the
 "classic line", where you ride the turn in more of an arc.
 
 Either turn is valid. One often uses the late apex to pass
 a rider taking a classic line. The classic line generally
 carries more speed through the turn but this is offset by
 the fact that you can't use the speed if someone appears
 in front of you (having taken the late apex line).

 In general, I rarely "apex" the corner the way a car
 driver would. Rather, I clip with a knee as I drive out
 (so I guess we generally apex our turns sooner).

 So be careful in making generalizations and realize that
 there are two apexes in any turn. The one on the tarmac
 and the one from your turn. The two do not necessarily

I suppose I should add my two cents worth...

The apex is to the best of my knowledge, the "ideal" spot at which you should
come closest to the inside of a corner.  That doesn't always mean getting on to
the turtles, of course.  Depends on the corner.  Some corners, those that go
through a larger change in compass direction, will require a double apex.  (Many
highway ramps are this way.  Big Bend at Lime Rock is a double.)

So, a "late" or "early" apex really is a someone's way of telling you that you
did it differently.  Depending on your car, this ideal spot may or may not be a
good thing.  911's handle differently that 944's, we are told.  Us learners
should generally stick to the turn in, apex, and track out points as laid out by
those benevolent souls who showed up real early that morning and set up the
cones!  Once you progress (or if you have an opinionated instructor), you'll
probably want to try different apexes and lines.

Since cones are noticibly absent in real races, it makes sense to start finding
reference points that aren't orange and triangular.  The three pylons really
aren't enough, anyways.  Pavement aprons and transitions work well for me, as do
mysterious splotches of white paint.  You used to head straight for the
restrooms coming out of Big Bend and going into the esses at LRP, for example. 
There was (maybe still is) a splotch of white paint in the left hander in the
esses.

Heel-toeing is how you make two feet do three things.  The one with the big "L"
sewn over the toes works the clutch, and the one with the big "R" works the
brake ('cause you want to slow down) and the gas ('cause you want to rev match
while downshifting).  The idea is that, after braking and come time to get on
the gas, you don't find you're turning 1800 RPM's.  By downshifting, you pace
yourself at the right point in your car's torque curve to come out of the corner
strong.  If your car is a turbo, this also keeps the turbocharger spooled up and
on boost.

You don't learn heel-toe at the track or autocross.  You learn it on the street
and bring it with you.  If you're uncomfortable doing it, don't.  It won't buy
you much.  Pick a gear you're comfortable in, and stay in it (third is nice). 
You have more than enough to keep your adrenalin-soaked noggin occupied anyways.
(For example, Senna stuffed his car at one of the last F1's this year when he
missed a shift.)

I have size 8 feet, and I find the foot-vertical technique doesn't work well for
me.  I am changing now to try using the front of the foot on the brake, the heel
on the gas.  I am finding that I really have to centre my instep over the brake
pedal, then swing my heel out to the gas, to get the right action.  Anyone have
similar experiences?

Yes, you can downshift to slow the car down.  In the halcyon days of drum
brakes, people used to do this a lot more in order to save the brakes. 
Fittipaldi tried this last year when he had brake problems, and ended up
trashing his transmission and DNF'ing.  (Don't these big-time examples help?) 
Nowadays, it's best to save your transmission and use the pads.  I will
down-shift to slow myself or just maintain speed cruising down a hill in street
driving.  It takes a long time, at least for me, to be very smooth at all speeds
and rev's, and I practice as much as possible.

As others have mentioned, PCA autocrosses and track events are tons of fun and
very cheap.  The professional schools are great too.  They're expensive, but the
education you get, I am told, is worth it.

Well over the allotted two cents...

We're all talking about the particulars of a corner but using an undefined
term.  The car folks talk only about the turn's geometry, and ignore the line
the car takes.  The bikers DO consider the line the bike takes, and use the
word "apex" in reference to that line.  This is independant of the corner
itself, and would remain valid on the Salt Flats.

Gotcha.

Subject: 914 FI-carb mods.


I am planning the purchase of a 73-74 914 2.0L.

I plan to rebuild the engine pretty much to stock with the exception of
junking the fuel-injection  and replacing it with either Weber of Dellorto
carbs.

I have already done this on a 79 VW bus 2.0L which is almost the identical
engine and the results were excellent.

I am interested in anyone's experience in making such a conversions,
i.e. the pros and cons and 
Weber vs. Dellorto.

I am aware of the legalities in CA.

The car is intended for rallying etc. and on the road serviceability is
essential.

Thanks in advance,
George Treacy

I did that on my 1971 1.7 using twin Webers. It might be subjective,
(I have no hard timing data), but I really like the results. The
engine seems to breathe and respond better in both city and highway
driving. The only drawback is in-town traffic jam driveability, where
you can feel he carbs stumbling :-), but I'm sure this can be
remedied by some appropriate tuning. I just never bothered to do it (I
rarely used my 914 for commuting, it was mainly for fun and trips -
that's one of the advantages of living in a nice mass transportation-
minded city like Montreal - plug plug).

Also, you might want to look into replacing the stock muffler with
something that breathes better (I put a Monza muffler, but I'm not
sure I'd recommend them. Although I think they DO provide a slight
power increase, the workmanship is pretty lousy, and parts of the
tubing rusted within 6 months).

Well, that's my 5 cents' worth (inflation). Good luck, and most of
all, HAVE FUN! Let us know what happens.

 Most everybody knowledgeable I've talked to has
 recommended against replacing the fuel injection
 on a stock motor with carbs (for a 914). Apparently,
 you get really bad off-idle performance and
 low-speed driveability. If your car is a daily
 driver it probably won't be worth it. Aside from
 the cost, the fuel injection system is relatively
 trouble free with a little maintenance. 

 If you're building the motor, you might consider
 one of the programmable fuel injection systems.
 I don't think it would be an overstatement to
 say that fuel injection will give you superior
 performance over carburetion in every instance
 (when properly implemented). I believe the
 control is just much more precise. 

 IMHO.

Just a quick thanks to all who responded to my request for US parts supplier
addresses - what a pity one can't use email to talk to these places :-)

Dave Erickson asked about the restoration parts situation in England.  Well
I have to admit that I haven't tried many non-Porsche suppliers.  Thus far I
have been able to get what I want from Porsche (but one does have to be very
careful with "superceded parts").

As far as I know trim etc parts are not made in the UK (in fact one well known
supplier, Autofarm, is now importing trim parts from the US !).  However there
are quite a few places the will supply third party body panels and OEM
mechanical parts - Porsche Post (the PCGB mag) is a good source for these.

Actually, Richard, you can use e-mail in a one-way sense to talk to the
suppliers.  Most commercial e-mail systems allow sending a FAX.  For example,
MCI Mail, MHS (eg, DaVinci), cc:mail, and many others support this.  So you
could send in your order from your mailer.

A nice thing about this is that the received FAX is of really high print
quality, because there is no alignment problem.  MCI Mail offers you the
additional ability to have recorded your company's logo or your scanned
signature for blitting onto the FAX.

This may be one of the few advantages to not being directly on the Internet!
