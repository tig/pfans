Lorenzo had another question:

I've seen a few very clean '87 and '88 944S models in the $10k-11k price
range.  This would be my choice when I go shopping to update from my '84.
(Unless I can stretch the budget to go for an S2.)

The non-S turbo gives you a few more HP, but at increased
purchase, insurance, and maintanence costs.  You also have to live with
the turbo lag.

While checking prices on replacement exhaust valves for my 2.0 liter 
914 I have discovered that I can choose between the OEM style Sodium 
cooled valves or Stainless steel valves.

Do either of these valves have any advantages over the other?
(other than price!).

It seems that dealer oriented sources sell the Sodium cooled and the 
generic parts houses sell the Stainless.

Which style should I use?... why?

The swap meet will be held, rain or shine.  In the case of rain, it will be

It's a good sized meet, not as large as Ski Roundtop, about the same size as

Don't be hasty when you generalize:
You wrote:> All Porsche struts are the three-piece type where you have the
strut body,the screw-on cap, and the insert.
In fact, on some 944 and 944 Turbos, the front strut is a one-piece (read
$$$) unit which cannot be renewed.

But I wouldn't expect you to know everything about everything!  :-)

Neil,

I wish my parents were cool enough to have had a Porsche,
particularly a 911. I guess I just didn't bring them up
properly. We had a series of utterly uninspiring British
cars, the only slightly interesting one was a Rover 2000,
even then I was disappointed because I hoped they were going
to get a Rover 3500 which I though was pretty cool due to the huge
V8.

They were pretty shocked when I got my beast though!

Dave,

        Was this while the cluth was fully engaged? Or while you were in
the process of engaging it? Also was it an actuall "bucking" or more of a
violent "shudder". The reason why I ask is that I have a violent shudder
sometimes while engaging the clutch at higher power in lower gears. From
what I've read I believe that this could be bad engine/tranny mounts. Are
there any unpleasant noises with it?

Jordan, are you certain the headliner is original? If so, very unusual. I
can't remember ever seeing anything but white. Refer to Brett Johnson's
book, The 356 Porsche, on page 122: "White perforated vinyl headliners,
according to the factory books, arrived with the 356A model change."
Although I know, that in those days, the factory would "build-to-suit," I
didn't know that included the headliners. 

My advice: take the white headliner - even if you can get light grey, no one
will believe it is original unless, of course, you have documentation (for
example, my sales receipt lists an extra charge of $47.60 for "white" white
paint not included in the color list).

The motor mount I can handle, but should I replace it with stock fluidfilled

Hi Rick,

I have the same situation with my '86 cab and the owners manual.  When 
I asked the dealer what the story was, I was advised that the manual
refers to the (Optional) automatic heat control system, and I "don't 
have that option".  I thought it sounded fishy, but there it is...

Subject: Bursch Mufflers

When I bought my '74 914 2.0 it had what I thought was a Bursch muffler. 
It was quite loud, but sounded great, and the resonances, if there were
any, weren't noticeable.  

Recently I rebuilt the top end and while doing so discovered that this
muffler was not a Bursch, and it had a hole in it.  So I replaced it with a
Bursch from GPR. While it's by no means quiet (esp. at idle), it feels like
a great match for my motor (stock except perhaps for the cam - unknown
history).  I love the way it sounds (it's quite raspy). At highway cruise
with the top on and windows up the car is actually pretty quiet.  If you
like to hear your motor, and you enjoy moving up and down the rev range (my
motor is quite happy to pull beyond the redline, but there isn't much power
up there) you may like the Bursch, but _it's not quiet_.

The "high quality black paint" on the header/collector part of the Bursch
burned off completely within 50 miles.  The muffler is still black,
however. Also, with 195/50's the rear clearance is a bit low.  It fits
perfectly.

I wish the 914 had its exhaust on the _passenger side_ so the driver could
hear it but at reduced volume.

Hope this helps,

Andrew

Subject: need help resolving 951 characteristics

I'm just joining the P-file world and would like to confirm some things that I 
have noticed about my '88 951.

Is the stock clutch on a 951 high in comparison to other Porsches?

My 951 seems to be very very sensitive to road conditions.  The quality of 
road is transmitted to me via the degree of vibration in the steering wheel.  
The wheel is quiet if the road is smooth but will become noisy at the slight 
indication of the road being not flat.  I bring this up because my 951 seems 
much more sensitive than a friends 88 911 with 17" SP8000s.  Two shops I spoke 
with essentially told me that was part of my introduction to a Porsche-land 
and 944s.

Subject: The Porsche Blues


	Sorry to re-open a debate which raged a while ago, but I'm trying
to ascertain exactly what colour *my* 911 is. When I bought it, the
salesman described it as "Baltic Blue", but the paint sticker says "378 9
7 Taubenblau Metallic", as does the touch-up paint which I received with
it.

	However, I'm told that the literal translation of taubenblau is
"Dove Blue", a colour I've never come across before.

	Can any Porschephiles shed further enlightenment?

	Also, do Porsche have more Blues than any other colour? So far I've
come across:

Tim,

  Take my advice, go and spend the money in prevention. My belt
broke around 38K. There were no warning before it broke, left me
stranded in the middle of the intersection in morning rush hour.
Spend $300 or so now, cost me $2K for replacing 4 valves, belts
and water pump. 

If any thing open the belt cover at least find out the condition 
of the belt.

Remember Prevention is better than cure, and Porsche and 
Prevention both starts with the letter "P" and in the wisdom 
of this list they both go hand in hand.

The dial marked 0 to 9 would be for an automatic heater control - you
set that dial and it automatically moves the heater lever up and down.
The one that has 0 to 3 is a heater fan speed control, and you move
the heater lever(s) up and down manually.  I've owned cars with both,
and I don't really have a preference (except that my current one, which
does not have the automatic heater control, has two heater levers, one
for the driver and one for the passenger, which I do like better).

*LOOK* at the pads! It's really easy to pull them out. I would not recommend
trying to do a driver's school with anything less than 50% pad. Most schools
won't pass a car (Tech inspection) with <50% pad. All the work is in getting
the wheels on & off. Porsche has just about the easiest setup for changing
pads.

Hi, Lou

You have a very valid complaint.  The O-rings should
last longer than that.  Keep us posted. 

My case turned out to be worse than we had thought when
I took it in last Fri.  Seems that the "cooler" (or what-
ever you call that finned box that the oil goes through to
get cooled) itself had a hole in it. Corrosion caused it:
about the size of a No.2 pencil lead. And with 90-100 lbs. 
pressure behind it, it wasted oil into the water faster than
my ex- wasted my checking account.  

The bottom line was (and its a good thing I love this car) the
new cooler was $310, and the total came to $750!  With all the
flushings they did of the oil and water cavities, the interior
of my engine is *got* to be in concours condition.

Tim, do not wait,do not pass go, go directly to your best mechanic and have
it done.

Your frugality in looking for the tool may cost you big bucks when it comes
to replacing every valve in the motor.  I know, I did it once.  Once it too
many times.

On the other hand, I have a nice motor for you (special for frugal
Porschephiles!) when you need to buy one.

For your info, my sunroof functions perfectly except for the fact that
I can not remove it. Once I took the car to the dealer, where the mechanic
(for testing purposes) swapped the relay out of another 944 and the roof
came right off. So I found the problem but have not replaced it since the

Subject: Thru Europe in 993

Bruce (and others who asked about the trip to pick up our new 993 in Europe),

	Got back last night (after a 17 hr trip back, including 2 hour drive from
Denver to our home in Beaver Creek). Had a great trip driving through
Burgundy. Started off driving from Stuttgart on the Autobahn to the
Baden-Baden exit where we got off and had lunch at B-B. Don't get too
excited, the Autobahn was too crowded to get any high speed driving in (and
the car was too new, having only 23 miles when we started). It took a little
while getting used to having to read the KM/Hr markings on our speedometer
because they were small since it was a US-spec car! But I did NOT go 120 MPH
in any 120 KPH zones :-). After lunch in B-B we drove down through the
Schwarzewald (black forest). Whenever we stopped we attracted a small crowd
of German tourists who couldn't resist the 993 (it looks great in red). The
driving on the forest roads was great, as the rear suspension of the 993
really allows spirited driving without the notorious trailing throttle
oversteer. My C2 was good, but I never felt comfortable pushing it to the
limits like I could the 993. We headed west out of the Black Forest to
Strasburg and drove into town to do a little sightseeing. Again, the car got
many thumbs up and whistles from Europeans as we drove by. The 911 seems to
be more rare in France then in the US. Driving in a big city in Europe can be
very intimidating, but I had some experience from before so I tried not to
get too sweaty-palmed while trying to get around and trying to remember what
the strange signs meant :-). After Strasburg it was a few hours of driving to
Chateau D'Isenbourg, south of Colmar. Quite a bit of driving for the first
day. D'Isenbourg was nice and we had a nice dinner there.
	The second day we headed down to Mulhous to see the Schlumpf museum and
their wonderful display of cars (including an old Lotus 7 that looks like my
Caterham). From there we headed on back roads over the hills that are on the
west side of the Rhein and into the northern Burgundy farmlands. This was
probably the most enjoyable traveling, once I got onto the lesser traveled
"D" roads. With the detailed Michelin guides, we were able to explore many
small roads and villages on our way to our next chateau, Chateau de Vault de
Lugny, near Avallon. This was our second favorite place to stay on the trip.
Absolutely beautiful old chateau with a 13th century fortress tower,
wonderful rooms and good food, not to mention the great country setting with
geese, ducks, hens, roosters, and peacocks roaming on the grounds. We spent
two nights there, exploring the local country-side and the old medieval
village of Vezelay. On our last day we had lunch at L'Esperance and headed
towards Beaune, again on the back roads.
	In Beaune, we stayed at Hostellerie de Levernois, just east of town. Do not
stay there. There are other chateaux in the area which are better. The
Hostellerie looks like it was built in the fifties for tourists and the room
we were in had serious mold problems from a water leak. The food there was
good, but it seemed to us (and to our German friends who came down from
Wiesbaden to join part of our trip in their white 993) that all the tourists
were put in one room and all the local French customers were put in a
seperate room. Sort of tacky. We were in Beaune for two nights and had a
wonderful meal at the Relais & Chateau in Lamelois, about 20 KM south of
Beaune, on the other night. Also, we enjoyed exploring Beaune and Dijon.
	Next we headed towards Lyon with our German friends in our two 993's. This
time we took the French autobahn (130 KPH speed limit) and trucked along at
about 160 KPH (my friend is a little crazy when it comes to driving). These
were the nicest autobahns we were to find on our trip, since the German
autobahns seem to be taken over by truck traffic these days, especially in
southwest Germany. We drove through Lyon and had lunch at a nice restaurant
(and chateau) outside of town about 30 km, on the Rhone, called Beau
Rivierge. From there we went back north to Chateau Bagnols which is about 40
km northwest of Lyon. This chateau was the highlight of the trip. It is a
restored castle from the 12 century and was the most luxurious and beautiful
place we have ever stayed. It was so nicely restored that there were tourists
stopping by wanting to see the castle all day every day. We stayed there two
nights and ate at Paul Bocuse's famous restaurant one of those nights. Since
we thought we may be drinking a lot of wine at Bocuse, we had a driver take
us there. Unfortunately, he got lost and finally we insisted that he hire a
cab to lead us to the restaurant (we passed the same bridge on the Rhone 4
times!). Although we arrived at Paul Bocuse 40 minutes late and were very
tense from the ride, the waiter calmed us down and was very nice to us. Of
course, we had a great meal. The dinner at Bagnols was also very nice.
	Our German friends headed back home and we went to Chamonix. It rained most
of the time there so we didn't get to hike, which was very dissappointing. It
was clear enough to enjoy the views, though. Again, we had a great meal where
we stayed (Auberge du Bois Prin).
	From Chamonix we drove back to Stuttgart to return the car. Once again, the
German autobahns were crowded, continually under construction and, all in
all, not conducive to high speed driving, although I did get a chance to
blast up to 150 MPH once. Since I had driven my friends 930 at 160 MPH before
It was not a big deal, but it would have been nice to see what the top
indicated speed would be with the 993.
	When we returned to Stuttgart, we had over 1500 miles on the car and I was
pretty exhausted from all the driving. The next time (some day) we will go
through Switzerland and try to drive less distances each day. The most
enjoyable driving was on the French back roads (the smaller the better) and
the French autobahns followed by the drive through the Black Forest. The
French national roads were less enjoyable, due to traffic, and the German
autobahns were, generally, a pain. BTW, we rented a car and drove to our
friends' home in Wiesbaden and the autobahns near Wiesbaden were much better,
but the rental car was slow :-(.
	Well, hope I didn't bore you too much.

They do help a little bit, but not much.  The reason you don't see them
advertised is that the boys and girls in Washington can read too, and
they take a real dim view of modifying emissions control equipment.  You
see such 911 stuff advertised (eg, SSI heat exchangers) because it is
ostensibly sold only to pre-cat cars.  A lot of people do put the stuff
on later cars.  This will become increasingly problematic in the next
fews years as inspectors keep getting (pressured to be) tougher on
illegal mods.

Subject: 914 "pulses"

I hope someone can help me with a problem that has
avoided every attempt at solution.
    I have a 1976 914 2 liter with about 18,000 on a carefully
rebuilt motor. I have had the same problem withboth the old
motor and with this rebuilt one.
     The problem is a slight bucking or pulsating or hesitation
in the engine. It is not a regular rhythm but is repetative.
It NEVER happens when the accellerator is more than half depressed.
It only happens when I have a light foot on the gas.
It tends to happen when accellerating gently in 3 and/or 4th
gears.  It is more pronounced when the motor is cold and in
the first couple of miles of the morning the motor may also
kind of burp a couple of times.  It also happens at constant
speeds when I have a light foot on the gas.  On level ground
at about 50-55 mph in 5th gear, for instance, or when pulling
a hill in 4th.  
     We have checked the temp. and pressure sensors, the relays, 
the fuel pressure setting, installed a new throttle switch, 
tried putting another computer on it. Also the alternator and 
distributor are new.
    I'd appreciate any hints aabout what this might be.

Lou,
Please be advised that if water gets into the oil it is prudent to replace
the rod bearings. Apparently they are very vulnerable to poor lubrication and
using water for a lubricant certainly qualifies.
When ever Porsche fixes the water - oil mixing chamber (oil cooler) they
replace the rod bearings. Often they don't even tell you they do this, as
happened to me. I only found out the bearings were replaced when I talked to
the mechanic. There was no information on the repair invoice.
Cute Huh?

Use the sodium filled exhaust valves *ONLY* if the original application
was sodium filled. The 2.0 914 is such a case. There are others -- 356SC
and I think Super 90, some 911s, etc.

The sodium filled valves have a very different heat transfer property
than the solid valves do. This is very important for correct operation
of the engine and not burning the valves in very short order.

Let's put it like this: you have to do *EXTRA* stuff to make a sodium
filled valve. Non filled valves have been around for a loooong time and
as you observed, are cheaper. Now, given that, would the factory have
*REALLY* gone to the extra effort and expense if it weren't justified?

Only use stainless valves for racing engines where they are on a scheduled
disassembly basis of no more than 20 hours operation. They start burning
after that.

The little ball and socket gizmo inside the control unit has come loose.
This is *VERY* common as there's a cheezy plastic socket that wears
out. The replacement part is like $1.25 at the dealer, but you have
to do a moderate amount of surgery to the car to install it. I wrote this
up at some point in the past, and frankly don't have time to go dig
it out of the archives for a while yet. The proceedure is in the factory
service manual, and is *NOT* very involved, other than you *MUST*
remove the passenger side front seat to do the work.

> I do not have a manual on the car interior controls.  How do the dash

Get a owners manual, about $20 most places. Very instructive. The dash
levers handle air distribution and fresh air venting, the floor control
handles heat.

The stiffness is normal if something is wrong, which is actually pretty
normal... It's worth it to spend some time lubing the cables from time
to time...

That's like saying you unbolted the rear view mirror to make more HP.
Put the fan BACK ON THE CAR. It's there for more than just the heater,
it's part of the engine cooling system. Do it now.  If it wasn't needed,
it wouldn't be there.

Philip,

Both your English and German names are correct.  The colour was first
used, if memory serves, in '89.  I first saw it on a 928S4 in an
advertisement, and later on a friend's 944S2.  It's one of my favourites.
I've always taken the literal translation to be Pigeon Blue, though.

Other recent blues include Copenhagen Blue and Ocean Blue (metallic).
The latter is called Nautik in German and is my car's colour: dark
blue with rose highlights.

You want to replace the motor mount(s) with the latest factory parts.
I don't know anyone who runs any other kind of mount in a street car.

The balance shaft retime is just a matter of aligning them properly
with respect to TDC.  Why they're off position is a good question.  If
you just bought the car, and you don't know when the balance and timing
belts were last replaced, you really ought to have them replaced like
yesterday.  The parts are cheap on an eight-valve car.  Also check
all the other components in the belt train.

Hello All,

Thirty-nine years ago today one of our Porsche-loving cohorts met an untimely
demise in his 550 Spyder.  I'm talking about James Dean, of course, and I
was wondering if anyone on the net has taken his fateful route?  It sounds 
like a nice drive - is there an organized rally of some sort?

Anyone been to the marker?  How about actually *seen* some of the wreckage or
knows where the body (the 550's!) ended up?

Art question:  there is a Champion spark-plug poster w/ Jim on it, changing
the plugs in his 550, getting ready for the race-that-never-was.  I have
a copy - anyone have an ORIGINAL from the promo copies that were sent out?
If so, where did you get it and what did it cost?

Well, anyone on the list w/ a Beck 550 or <gasp> an original?  If so, drive
extra careful today!  ;-)

Subject: info needed 1980 924S


A friend of mine just got a 1980 924S Turbo (931) 
very cheap ($250). It's in very good shape with no
rust, but hasn't been running for a year. A few 
questions:

The line to the resonator valve has been chewed-through
by a critter. It looks the same as the high-pressure 
plastic fuel lines. Can this be replaced without special 
tools? I don't remember how this thing works. Can someone give
me a *brief* refresher?

What's the approx. value for a 924S of this vintage. As I
recall, they aren't worth much, but it seems like a pretty
decent car.

Thanks,

Subject: '73 911T for sale

At a shop that was making a boat trailer for me the woman has a
'73 911T Targa.  While we talked about Porsches she mentioned that
she would be interested in selling it.  The car appears to be in fair
to good conditon-a good clean-up might make all the difference in
the world.  It's kind of a burgandy with black interior.  Fuchs,
body looked good at a glance.  Motor was rebuilt several years ago
but only has like 5K on it.  Some special pistons/cylinders 
(Aireal???), E cams, heads and mechanical injectors modified
for better flow.  Revs easily past 7K.  I may have much of this
detail wrong, so call her and ask for details.  I was thinking
of buying it and switching motors with my car!

Anyway, price is $5K which seems fair to me.  She has no internet
access and I don't have any involvement in this so call her
directly.  I could get a little more info or take a better look
at the car if it would help anyone out.  

Car is located in San Jose CA.  Tell her the guy with the
MasterCraft told you about it.

Car is at Sport Boats in San Jose daily at (408) 292-6503.

Bryan, no I haven't done a 914 engine swap, but I have put a 911 engine in a
Vanagon.  I have to think that the oil tank issue with the 911 engine has to
be a lot cheaper/easier to solve than the radiator issue with any humid engine.
You weren't pricing a new original 914-6 oil tank were you?  When two different
vendors in the back of every Porsche mag want to sell you reasonably priced
aftermarket parts?  

Yes, the 911 engine will be more expensive than the Mazda, but I'll bet a com-
petent 914-6 conversion will be worth more at sale than a competent 914-"what
is THAT?" conversion.

Either way, you picked a great car to start with.  If I didn't live in rust
hell, I'd probably have a 914.  Let us know what you decide.

Subject: Re: wasserpumper oil vs.water

Jerry,

In fact Porsche decided that the bearings need to be inspected, not
necessarily replaced.  They did not always call for this inspection.
I had my heat exchanger resealed before they inspected bottom ends, and
never had a problem with the bearings.  The tech bulletin is book D,
group 1, number 8707, dated 6 May 87.

We did my bottom end over last winter.  Despite getting water
in there years ago, despite six not-so-gentle years of track
events and year-round driving, and despite the Cult of the Number
Two Conn Rod Bearing circle of fear, they were all absolutely
perfect.  (We replaced them anyways.)

Hiall,

First I'm glad we have tta.com back pumping bytes again.

Second I would like to have your viewpoints in the following matter; 

Are there any guys/gals out there that would have enjoyed a separate list 
for the vintage porsche's??
(Vintage is not a clear defined word, but anything pre '66 might be 
suitable. ;-)

The porschephiles list is the *best* porsche list for general purposes, but 
if you're mostly into the old 4cyl 4bangers the 'noise-ratio' gets abowe 95% .

There are some *terrific* 356 experts out there, just a couple of keystrokes

I suggest checking the output volumn of the fuel pump.
I just recently solved a similiar problem on my '74 2.0 that drove
me nuts for about 3 months. It turned out that even though my fuel
pump was pumping enough volume to keep the pressure up at idle,
it wasn't enough to keep the pressure up under load at a constant 
throttle position.  My guess is that the enrichment curcuit of the 
throttle switch helps to mask the problem by opening the injectors 
for a slightly longer period of time when the throttle is opened 
wider - then when the manifold pressure equalizes again, the injector 
durations are shortened and then aren't injecting enough fuel again.
This causes the moter to run LEAN and is a very bad thing if not 
corrected quickly. ( My reward for not checking the fuel pump sooner 
is a burned valve )

hope this helps!

The fact that it makes a difference unplugged is a pretty good sign

Define major!  I'd recommend trying the pressurization procedure
described in the workshop manual.  You cut the end off an old fuel
filter, install a tire valve where the fitting used to be, clamp
it on the induction hose instead of the air flow meter, and pump it
up to about 0.5 bar.  I did this to my car a few weeks ago, and it
really works well.  You can hear any leaks, esp. if you have an
electronic stethoscope, or just put a length of hose to your ear.

Check esp. the lower injector o-rings and the intake manifold gasket.
You can do this with the engine running by dribbling water on them.
If they leak, they will visibly and audibly inhale the water.  If
not, it just pools by the gasket/ring.

Subject: Re: 914: popped outa' gear, no power

Most likely sheared CV joint bolts.  You should be able to see a driveshaft
hanging down underneath the car.  Solution: have the bolts torqued to spec next
time (ask me how I know).  If you're lucky the transmission flange and the CV
joint survived - you'll just need 4 new bolts.  Make sure the 2 roll pins are
also present in the CV joint.

Could also be a sheared pin in the shift linkage inside the transmission.  You
can tell if this is the case from the feel of the stick - it's like
there's no H-pattern there.  You can get to this pin via a small access plate
on the bottom rear of the transmission (held on by 4 10mm nuts).

Could also be a dropped grub screw at the shift coupler just outside the
firewall.  If you're lucky you still have the rubber boot that goes over the
coupler and the screw is in there.  I used loctite on that one.  Same lack
of H-pattern, but the stick can be moved outside the normal range of motion.

Those are the three modes of failure I've experienced...

  1.  I replaced one in a 928, it went much better than I'd feared (most
  everything was easy to get to). I got mine on sale, rebuilt thru
  Zim's for about $350.
    The one trick for installation is that Porsche (well, most cars)
  use these giant (like 36mm) "thin" nuts on the tie rod ends, a normal 
  wrench is too wide. To get to it, I bought a cheap 36mm open end wrench,
  and took a grinder to it to narrow it enough to fit between the 
  obstructions.
    Of course you'll need to have your front end re-aligned afterwards,
  but you can get close enough to get it to a shop. Make sure to replace
  the dust boots (if they don't come with the rack) or you'll waste your
  inner tie rods, I guarantee.

   2. On another subject (all you water coolers) does the 16-valve
      928 use the same valves as an '87 944 ?? I've got a pair of
      good spare heads for a 928 (market for them is Zilch) and a 
      friend who lost the timing belt on their 944. Does anybody know
      if;
         - They are the same valves ?
         - They are the same length and stem diameter ?
         - If the 928 valve is bigger, has anybody heard of cutting
           bigger valve pockets and installing 928 valves in the 944 head ?
         - Or what/where is the right price on 944 valves ?

Subject: Hasty departures

Howdy Porschephiles,

I've gotten a disturbing number of messages to the list announcing the
departure of sundry folks, citing the noise level.  Gosh, I don't know
quite how to put this so as to avoid hurting any tender feelings, but now
that you've acquired a Porsche, and a goodly number of you are all
Varminted-up as well, would you consider getting a grip?

The worst is over (well ok, once you've endured this); what could be worse?
(yeah, Yeah.  Me too, I cheered up & things got worse...)

But it occurs that perhaps it wasn't the reasons stated that percipitated
these departures.  Perhaps a distaste for the general level of "Piling-on"
has made folks too uncomfortable.  We Americans like to think that we have
a higher than average sense of fair-play.  I think we do.  And "Piling-on"
isn't "fair-play."

I agree with the gentleman from Belgium who noted that Ted is responsible
for the security of his account.  Also, Ted deserved to get his butt kicked
for his "Dr. Porsche" mailing, and Stan properly kicked his butt for that.
If he's also guilty of the mail-bombing he's accused of, and denies; he's
in for a lot worse than that.  But the Constitution I swore an oath to
defend, many years ago, says that folks accused of a crime should be
presumed innocent until their guilt is established, and that still remains
to be established.  I'm not defending Ted, I'm keeping an open mind.

So the question is, "What time is it, Uncle Bart?"  I'm glad you asked
Kiddo.  It's *time* to LIGHTEN-UP a bit.  Have a great week-end, everyone.
Love and Kisses (er, ummm, better make that last bit "Porsches")!

Some of the messages have been sent some time ago, so you may not have

Personally, I began sending messages to have my name removed each time

I copied his sysop on one of the responses and got a note back from the

Subject: Re: Balance Shaft Adjustments

Jim,

1) Motor mounts should be replaced with the fluid filled factory mounts, but
of the Turbo type.  Generally available new from the usual aftermarket
places for about $135-150 each.  My recommendation is to do both sides at
the same time, although usually, the side nearest the exhaust manifold is
the culpritl.  You can do it yourself, with appropriate jackstands, and a
couple of good floor jacks.

The symptom that indicates bad motor mounts is a vibration in the steering
wheel at idle, which disappears at rpm's above 1600 or so.

2) Balance shaft timing is another story.  The symptom for balance shaft
timing being incorrect is a buzzing vibration (not unlike a vibrator) in the
shift knob.  It does not go away with higher rpm.

If the relationship between the balance shaft pulleys and the balance shafts
has not been disturbed (has the water pump been replaced? have the balance
shaft seals been replaced?) by some mechanic/hack, then timing the balance
shafts is not too difficult.   Of course, you will need appropriate timing
diagrams (Jim Pasha's article in Excellence (June 94 I think) had an
excellent diagram of timing for the balance shafts) and you will also need
the infamous cam belt tension gauge P9201 - (spend the money...If you're
going racing, you're going to have to get used to it!).

Of course, fix one problem at a time.  My suggestion is to check the balance
shaft timing first by removing the upper belt cover, rotating (by hand) the
motor to TDC on Cylinder #1, verifying TDC by noting the timing mark on the
camshaft pulley through the inspection hole, then checking the balance shaft
timing on the pulleys (the lower balance shaft timing can be inspected with
the lower belt cover in place, through the inspection hole).

Good luck

Yes, a post about an actual CAR!!!1
The problem is that my car runs really rich.  It appears that the last 
owner (or one of the last owners) took the liberty of adjusting the Air 
Flow sensor.  I want to know if there is any way for me to recalibrate 
this beast.  The glue on the screw is broken, but the goop on the plastic 
parts is still there.  If I adjust it back to where it naturally goes (ie 
the goop pulls it back to place) it still runs pretty bad.  
As an aside to this, what does the adjustment screw on the AFC box 
actually do.  Again, it looks as though someone decided it need 
adjustment and has done so.  I would guess that it is a mixture 
adjustment, and if so which way leans it out?

Due to the continual opening and closing of the rear deck, one of my 
hinge brackets is now broken.  I have been considering buying a welder

	The sodium in the sodium-filled exhaust valves is there to help
thermal conduction from the valve face to the valve stem so that the heat
can be dissipated into the head via the valve guide. Stainless steel, on the
other hand, is a *very* poor thermal conductor which cause the valve face
to run at higher temperature.

	Advantages of the sodium-filled valve include:
Ability to utilize higher compression with a given gas
Ability to use lower octane gas at a given compression
Ability to operate with more spark advance (at a given compression/gas)
Longer operating life.

	Disadvantages of the sodium-filled valve:
High cost
Higher mass

	Advantages of SS valve:
Hot face resists build-up
Much cheaper
Lower mass (can be set up to rev higher without float )

	Disadvantages of SS valve:
low thermal conductivity

	If you are trying to make more power by twisting the motor at higher rpm,
SS may help (Titanium would help much more ) but at the expense of lifetime.
For a street motor the sodium-filled valve is what I prefer for long life and high
performance.

Dear folks,

Ever since I saw a 911, I've always wanted one. But I have a severe case
of arthritis which prevents me from driving a 911 stick shift -- the clutch
is way to hard/stiff. I can't currently afford to buy a new 911 Tiptronics,
so I looking for a 911 that I can restore. This brings up a bunch of questions
that I hope someone more knowledgeable than myself could answer:

	1.	How would you rate the complixity of a Porsche 911 to, say,
		a BMW 325 or 2002? BMWs are the only cars that I have worked
		on.

	2.	Is it a crazy idea to buy an old 911 and restore it? What
		model year should I look for? What years had a lot of
		problems?

	3.	Are the tiptronic trannys reliable? Can anything be done
		to the stick shift clutch to make it softer?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Kory

When I had the clutch replaced on my 87, my mechanic performed an update that
changed the bearings the the throwout bearing fork rotates in and maybe the
fork but I'm not sure. This is appearantly a Porsche recommended update -
before they did the work, he explained the problem and showed me a tech note
describing the update. I also saw the old bearings while they were still in
the bell housing (is that a proper term for a p-car?) and they were trashed.
The pedal effort was much lower and smoother after the fix.

If my memory is correct, I paid $1600 for the complete job including the
update. I think the update added 250-300 to the job.

There have been some good articles in Excellence magazine regarding the

but I don't remember the issue offhand.

Thanks to Jim Pasha for authoring these essential articles for 944 owners.

From: James K Benson <jbenson@ecn.purdue.edu>
Subject: 944 Turbo information


In response to several questions posted on 944 Turbos:

*(The difference between the Turbo S and a standard Turbo)*
   The Turbo S incorporated many of the performance upgrades
of the race cars, built for the Turbo Cup Series, into a production
car.  1000 Turbo S's were made in 1988, 700 came to the US.  Most were
silver rose metallic with burgandy interior.  In 1989 all 944 Turbos
had the Turbo S upgrades.  They are as follows:

Engine:
	The engine has larger exhaust valves than the standard Turbo.
	The K26 turbocharger has improved exhaust and compressor blades
	allowing faster spin up.  The KLR computer runs a little higher
	boost pressure (1.82 bar absolute) than the standard Turbo (1.75
	bar abs.).  This rates the Turbo S at 247 bhp and 258 ft*lbs of
	tourque @ 4000 rpm.  The stock Turbo is 217 bhp and 243 ft*lbs
	@ 3500rpm.  

Transmission:
	The limited slip differential with external transmission oil
	cooler is standard on the S.  It's an option on the other
	Turbos.  Also, first and second gears are given an additional
	heat treatment to withstand the additional torque developed by
	the engine.

Suspension:
	Koni adustable shocks on all four corners.  The front struts
	are double adjustble, for stiffness and ride height.  The front
	springs are stiffer, about 165 lbs/in over 130 lbs/in for the
	stock suspension.  The front sway bars are 26.5 mm and rear are
	18 mm.  Off hand I can't remember the dimensions for the standard
	car but they are somewhat less.  The rear torsion bars on the 
	Turbo S are also larger diameter.  In addition, all the rubber
       	suspension bushings on the Turbo S are made of a stiffer compound.

Brakes:
	Front brakes on the Turbo S are the same as the 928 S4.  They
        are substantially larger than a standard Turbo.

Other:
	Airbabags, ABS, improved stereo system are all standard.
	7 and 9 x 16 forged wheels.

*(Price ranges and what you can get for $12000)*
   As far as prices go, the ranges for average to good condition Turbos:

'86                $10-$12 K
'87                $13-$15 K
'88                $14-$16 K
'88 & 89 Turbo S   $17-$20 K

I know I'll get all sorts of disagreement on these price ranges, but these
are ballpark of what owners are asking for their cars.  Usually dealerships
will be on the high end.  For the $12000 range (specific question) I 
recommend an '86 Turbo.  It's an awful lot of car for that price.  There
are quite a few around and if you're patient you should be able to find a
pretty clean example without having to drive through 2 states to see it.
Maintenance costs are higher on a Turbo than a plain 944.  More high stressed
parts to fail and more parts in general.  Also, for this reason, certain
repair jobs require longer labor for the Turbos than a plain 944.

*(Oil use and consumption)*
   As far as oil use, I recommend Mobile 1 15w 50.  Especially if you run the
car hard or track it, the high heat and high rpms really degrade the oil.
One quart for 1500 miles seems like low consumption to me.  I track my
car and it will use a quart to a quart and a half for a weekend event (300 
miles).  Otherwise, for highway, maybe a quart per 800 miles or so.  Do
not let the oil level get low.  The rod bearings (esp #2) are suceptable
to oil starvation.  Watch the level and keep it on or even slightly above
full, if you run the car hard and don't let go even half a quart down for
street/highway (easy) use.

*(Wheels, offsets, etc.)*
   An 88 Turbo S or '89 will have the 7 and 9 x 16 in. forged
seven spoke "Club Sport" wheels.  The 944 S2 and early C2/C4 seven spoke
wheels are the cast version, sometimes called "Design 90" wheels.  Forging
is a better manufacturing process than casting.  Forged wheels are
stronger than cast.  They are less likely to crack.  Any wheel off a 944 
from 1987 on will fit any other 944 in that year range.  The wheel offsets
were changed in 1987 to accommondate the ABS option, whether the car had the
option or not.  The C2/C4, RS Amer, 968, C2 Turbos, etc.., all have the
ABS offset hubs (Fuchs will not fit on a C2).  Therefore, the new 17 in.
5 spoke wheels will fit on any '87 or newer 944.  For a 944 Turbo, I'd
recommend the 7.5 and 9 x 17 set that the 968 w/ M030 came with. 

*(Catalytic Test Pipe)*
Removing the catalytic converter will improve the performance of a 944 Turbo.
It will run a little cooler and sound a little louder.  European versions
have what is called a primary muffler in place of the catalytic converter,
which acts as an addtional muffler on US cars.  I removed the cat. in my
car for the two reasons above.  I had always heard that the cats were well
enough designed, that they did not reduce performance.  Wrong.  The car
breathes a lot better and has more pull on the top end.  The real top end,
like above 120 mph in 4th gear.  If you don't run the car at high speed
tracks (Road America, Brainerd Int'l Raceway, etc) you may
not notice much improvement.  Everything is a trade off.

Subject: 944 windshields

     To All,
     
     I just wanted to post a notice to everyone that has a 944x.
     I just went through a bad experience that actually turned out pretty 
     good at the end. I own a '86 944 and was changing the front hood 
     shocks when out of the blue the bottom of the shock just tapped the 
     bottom of the window and shattered about a one inch section of the 
     lower windshield. Needless to say this grew within a week to cover the 
     hole shield. For those of you that have ever cracked a 944 windshield, 
     you know that this is one of the most expensive w/s on the market at a 
     install price of avg. $1100. 
     On line here I was directed to one of the most friendly based 944 
     parts companies that you could ever deal with. 
     Porsche All 944 (1 800 255-7944) Even though they didn't have a W/S
     they where very helpful in directing me to someone that did.
     Glass Wholesalers (or Distributors) 800 421-1414 had factory OEM W/S 
     for $440. Once I received it, the company that was to install it 
     couldn't get it in. (To keep this as short as possible I will skip the 
     details. This glass does not go in like normal glass.)
     Don was eager enough to tell me that if they needed someone to walk 
     them through the process, via phone, he would. I was nervous having 
     someone put it in that had obviously had no experience with P-Cars.
     But they had more experience installing car glass than anyone in the 
     state. 
     In making a return call to Glass Distributors, Don tried to forewarn 
     me to be real careful with this W/S. He said,"we ship most of this 
     glass to people that are trying to change hoodshocks or readjust their 
     hoods". He commented that he was going to write a article to warn 
     people of this in an upcoming issue of Pana. At this point I had to 
     tell him of my idiotic adventure and that I wished that I had talked 
     to him sooner.
     After thinking about it, I decided to give an FYI to all here just in 
     case. Hopefully this will give you a heads up when playing under the 
     hood or around the windshield wipers. This is a very sensitive area.
     And, I would personally give a THUMBS UP! to both of the companies 
     listed above.

I installed double shocks on both the front hood and the engine lid about 
two years ago.  I got tired of having the shocks wear out and dropping the 
hood/rear lid on my head!!  On the front hood, the corner where the double 
shock is installed is also raised up.  I guess the double shock exerts too 
much upward pressure for the weight of the hood to hold it down.  I don't 
think it causes any permanent damage but ** I'd really be interested to know 
if it has caused permanent damage to anyone else car**.  I'm planning to 
keep the double shock for the same reasons I installed it unless someone 
knows of the possibility of damage.  I did not have this problem with the 
rear lid.  I've also got the full whale tail, same as Mike Dayton, so the 
extra weight is offsetting the extra upward pressure from the double shock 
and keeping the body fit.  I suspect that this extra tail weight over the 
regular, no tail,  rear lid is what wears out the shocks so quickly 
(replaced every 2-3 years)

Regards.

>My 1983 Targa is overheating at full throttle settings.
There's been a lot of discussions about 911 temperatures.  Interestingly, 
the owner's manual only says that when the temp gets to the red bar (in cars 
without numbered gauges) is the temperature excessive.  The bottom of the 
red bar translates to 302F degrees.  (The guages have degrees C printed on 
the far left side of the bars, back behind the face of the guage).  IMHO, 
Porsche either felt that less than 300 degrees was not too hot, they knew 
the cars would run very hot and did not want to scare owners or they wanted 
to sell lots of overheating-derived repairs (I think it's really choice 2). 


General concensus from the experts seems to be that 300 degrees is much too 
hot for long engine life.  A typical solution is to replace the front oil 
loop with either a factory or aftermarket oil radiator.  I've used both 
Terbotrol and B&B with the B&B appearing to work slightly better for my car, 
YMMV.  Depending on the how hot the climate where you live is, auxilliary 
cooler fans may be helpful. .  My temp (in Phoenix) still runs 230-240 when 
it's hot out, in traffic, with the air on so next year I'm going to add a 
fan.  You should price shop around salvage centers to find a system out of 
an 84 or an 87+ model (if you want the aux fan) to compare with the 
aftermarket products.  Be sure to really clean out a salvage system. 
 Mobile1 (or any synthetic) will help reduce the temperature, which you've 
already done.

This is a different system from the US models.  In my 83SC there is only the 
auto heat control dial, no levers.  Not having a manual for that car myself, 
I would venture a guess that the cable connected to the dial mechanism had 
failed.

This should be in the regular owners manual.  You should be able to order 
one through a Porsche dealer.

>How do the dash levers control the temperature, in conjunction with the

This lever controls fan speed for ventilation air.  As it moves from left to 
right it first opens fresh air vents and then turns on the fan.  It does not 
help increase warm air flow on car with the auto temp control (the "lever" 
controls do this).

>The levers on the dash are sort of stiff to move.  Is this normal?
They should not be real stiff.  You should feel just a slight resistance.

>Oh yeah-Does that little stubby rubber thermostat up by the rear view

Yes it works well, as long as the connector wire hasn't come loose.  You can 
undo the screws that hold it up and check to see if the wire still makes a 
good connection.  If it has come loose, then the thermostat doesn't work.

Yes.

When I was trying to locate my sunroof problem I checked the micro switch
which was sort of loose and was effecting the normal operation of the sunroof.
I don't think that is your problem because you have a functional sunroof.

I did disassemble the rear assembly (curiosity :-) ) but don't remember
(as someone else posted to this list ) that there is a second relay
in the rear. My guess is that in the newer model that relay might have
been moved into fuse box as shown by the Haynes Manual. But remember
this is only a guess, may be someone with a shop manual can confirm this
for you. ( Hello Kevin )

Hope this helps.

Hans Stuck -- but it was done SO tongue-in-cheek and so obviously
by Welty and so humorously that I had to laugh and let it go.

Besides, you only saw the *effect* of the faked mail -- not the

Subject: Re: Rebuilding 914 ign switch.


  Brian, and my Porschephile friends;
  Yes, the switch can be cleaned and reused.
  Procedure:
  Use an X/acto knife blade to gently pry the 2 tabs on the side
of the switch body apart to separate the contacts from the cover.
  Be careful not to flex the nylon too far or the tabs will break.
  Use a solvent to clean the center and outer contacts on both
halves of the switch.  You may have to use a pencil eraser to scrub
the oxides off the contact zone, an ink eraser works best.
  Re-lube with silicone grease and reassemble.
  End procedure.

  The switch body is keyed so you cannot mess it up.  The center contact
is silver plated and is the starter contact.  While you have it apart
inspect carefully for heat warpage that might cause mis-alignment of
the internals and aggravate the fail mode.

  I've posted this before about the cause of this failure:
  There is no spike supressor diode across the starter's engagement
solenoid.  The ~300V spike is enough to fritz the contacts over time.
  Adding a 1n4004 or 4005 in proper polarity will permanent fix.

  Not sure, but all 9xx cars may share in this..

Aftermarket expandibles can be installed with the engine in the car; using
the stock parts requires sigificant disassembly and should not be
done unless you're doing at least a valve job. By the same token, I
always replace the expandible jobbies with the real parts if I have to
take the top end apart, just on principle...

Subject: ALL: re: 356 list



	I like the idea of a 356 only list, but I do understand the
concern of losing this content from p-files. Two alternatives I propose:

	1- separate 356 list and Cc: porschephiles; or

	2- use the first 3 spaces of the subject line to indicate which
cars are being referred to (ie, 356,911,944,etc, or ALL,AIR,H2O)
	
	This second alternative (which I think someone might have
suggested before) would allow people with limited time (or expensive
access time for those of us who don't get this access with work) to
quickly scan their mail for the info that interests them. 

	I think it would be great to keep everyone in good communication
with each other, and using a 3-character code in the subject line might
actually encourage some of the busier people to stay with the list because
it would be more user friendly.

	All this system would take to implement is for people to start
using these codes in their subject lines, like I have above. Of course,
you can still write a regular subject after the code. Show your support by
using these codes, or post your suggestions/comments.

Subject: Re: 356 Zenith Carb Adjustment

Dear Tom:

       Before you try to adjust the Zeniths, make CERTAIN that the timing is
right (30-35 deg high speed advance, 3-7 deg advance idle), the valves are
adjusted correctly, and the plugs and wires are in good shape!

     Then, and only then can you adjust the carbs! The mixture screws (one
per hole) are like your garden hose valve- screw them in and they cut off the
gas; screw them out and they  increase the gas. I screw the screw in with my
right hand (starting on #1 cylinder, the rt front), with my left hand on the
middle of the fan shroud to feel how the engine responds. As you near all the
way in, the cylinder should die and the engine run rough. Back the screw out
and the cylinder should kick in. Go too far and it'll run rough again (too
rich). Iterate until you find a position such that a 1/8 turn either way
makes it run worse. Then go to the next idle mixture screw.
   Once you get all 4  mixture screws adjusted, put on your Synchrometer (NOT
a "Unisyn" The Synchrometer is like an air mass meter on a fuel injection
system and does NOT disturb the engine like the old obsolete Unisyn does
However if you have a Unisyn, you can peel off the rubber bottom and use it
with your  new Synchrometer). Compare the air draw side to side, and adjust
the idle STOP screw until both carbs draw an even amount AND the idle is from
900-1100 RPM. (I prefer 1000-1100 RPM, the oil pressure is higher and the
generator is usually charging).  Then repeat the idle mixture procedure. Then
check the side-to-side air draw with the Synchrometer. Repeat until happy.
   If you find a mixture screw that has no affect on the engine when you
screw the screw alllll the way in, you probably have a clogged idle jet. The
idle jet is located inside the square cover on the side of the Zenith, held
by a 10mm across the flat bolt. NOTE WELL: if you should remove that bolt,
the entire contents of the float bowl (gasoline),  WILL gush out allover your
plug wires and hot "J" pipes. Place rags or some such underneath before you
remove the cover!  You have been forewarned.

KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

Subject: Monthly Update -- IMPORTANT TO READ IT THIS TIME!

October 1994

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Well, it's been another interesting month... Ted Matsumura FINALLY has 
been kicked off this list. In the event that he does anything to annoy you
or to attempt to make your system unusable, please let me know at
once.  There have been reports of retaliatory activity.

With the Great Unpleasantness surrounding this, we've had a good deal of
attrition. We've also gotten back some folks that went anti-Ted a long
time ago, and have a ton of new members. Membership is up to about 850
at this point. The Who's Who will not be mailed out for a while though
to give me a chance to clean it up, removing the "old dead members".

The digest is new and improved -- new software will auto-send
the digest before it hits the 50k byte limit that many of the on-line
services have trouble with. So, that means you'll typically be getting
three digests a day, not one.

And, some trivia: the current membership of 850 is spread over 417 different
domains. Since I'm using smart mailer software, it only sends one copy to
each domain. If the average digest is 150k, that means that there are over
*FIVE HUNDRED MILLION* bits per day of Porschephiles traffic on the 
Internet. If I were using stupid mail software, it would be well over a
gigabit a day of Porschephiles. So, when the list seems to have a slow
turn over time, remember this.

Finally, a moment of silence for my 911. It's gone to live with a new
owner, as of about three weeks ago. It was a great car, certainly the
best of the street 911s I've had to date. While I'll miss it, I'm
re-focusing on my racing and 356 activities for a while. Once my new
venture pans out, I'll have to see about a made-to-measure 993...

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 18 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.

FINAL NOTE: As I noted in a prior mailing, the FTP restriction above applies 
to major downloading of stuff from the archives, not WWW access. Suggestions 
for improving the WWW pages would be welcomed, as well as experienced help
in doing so.

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained more regularly than it used to be. I have
   routine access and try to handle changes at least once every other
   day.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (713) 661-2084 or (908) 287-8070..

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

OK, I'm a certifiable Porsche nut. I've had at least one each of the air 
cooled street cars, none each of the water cooled cars, have lusted after the
Mooney with the Porsche engine, seriously considered getting my dad a
Porsche Junior tractor, etc. This list is consequently for all things
Porsche.

I understand Trond's concerns though -- if I want to get a 356 specific
answer, I have to wade through a PILE of non-356 stuff. In fact, the
356 content is just about zero. So from *THAT* perspective, the signal
(356 content) to noise (everything else) ratio is pretty bad.

Here's the kicker: you find tidbits of info that are useful in all the
other "non-356" stuff. Like welding tips from Kyle talking about 914s,
or brake plumbing tips from Nathan Ulrich talking about race-grade 944s,
or interior tips from people talking about concour prep for Carrera RSs.
When we start splitting the list up, we lose that.

My personal solution to this is to maintain my own private list of people
that share certain interests -- on paper. That way I know who to shoot
a private mail message to for a clear and concise response in real time
about specialized topics. I've created my own personal network of contacts
and people I turn to when I need info.  People I would not have met except
via this list. People I would not have respected enough to value their
opinions except for what I've heard of their advice and opinions on this
list.

So, if there *ARE* little specialized sub-lists out there, that's
OK. My own interests are broad enough that it's not a requirement
for me, and my ego needs are met via enough other things that I don't feel
like I have to somehow "own" all the Porsche content in the world.  And I 
somehow figure that if there's a specialized list out there that 
I *should* be interested in, they'll find me...

I thought that I was clear in that I was strictly dealing with the
upsportsmanship issue. Stan seems to have picked-up that, but maybe it was
not so clear to others.

I sincerely appologize for anything I've said to make anyone think I am, in
any way unsupportive of Stan's actions. I have long admired him for his
service to the group; especially given the incredibly busy man that we know
him to be.  

My comments about presumed innocence were not meant to be taken as
criticism of Stan's actions in booting Ted, but as supporting the thesis that
the group has been exercising poor sportsmanship in the piling on.  I bit
my tounge on that for a long time, although it rankled me; until folks
starting leaving with public departure messages that I thought
*unsporting*.  Re-reading my posting, I can see that I could have made that
point much more clearly.

Open mouth, insert foot.  (Yech, not too tasty...)  Well, I wondered where

Subject: This could ONLY happen in California...



I'm so pissed off I can't see straight!!
In this morning's San Jose Mercury News,
there is a story about a new law passed
in California that can allow the State
to seize and SELL your car if you are
convicted of driving without a license
twice in 5 years. This law takes effect
on January 1, 1995.

Now, the article states that this law
is intended to remove vehicles from
the possession of people caught
driving with suspended or revoked
licenses. BUT, the article continues,
the law also applies if you are
stopped by the police and cannot
produce a license because you
may have left it at home. Pretty
serious punishment for a minor
traffic violation.....
 

So this law also affects people
who may be law abiding, licensed
drivers, who for whatever reason
forget to carry a license with them.
I'm no political activist, but such
an erosion of civil liberty such as
this may turn me into one.  The
Governor who signed this is up for
election in November..... His name
is Pete Wilson. Vote for ANYBODY
else, please!!

I think what Bart and others are trying to get across to the
group has little to do with Ted, and a lot to do with
the rest of us. Many many MANY people exhibited poor
judgement and MUCH immaturity in they way they responded
to Ted's actions, whether real or perceived.
 
Simply look at the tone and language of some of the

there are a lot of college students in this list, but

Subject: Bart Chambers' tire wear

Hi, Bart.
 
If you are wearing the rears out twice as fast as the fronts, I think you
should look at the example of a Really Expert Slalom Driver who used to be
on this list. Ya see, ya gotta mix tire brands on your car to fine-tune its
handling AND WEAR. A harder compound at the rear will equalize wear. After
all, the factory doesn't have time to do this on each production car. Also,
because you probably drive alone, there will be slightly more weight on the
left rear. You should consider having not only harder tires at the rear, but
carefully select a slightly harder brand on the left rear compared to right
rear. (Sears Roadhandlers are good, hard tires.) Also hard tires bounce off
curbs much better, preserving the clearcoat on your wheels so you won't have
to put an entire row of hose reels around your house.
 
NO, NO, THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT AT HUMOR!!! PUT AWAY THE CUTTING TORCH! (We have

Hi, Tom.
 
I have mostly Solexes, so I had to read the manual. Translating from

1. Warm engine, remove air cleaners.
 
2. Pop throttle linkage off carburetors.
 
3. Turn in both idle speed adjustment screws (idle stop screws) together
until idle is about 1000 rpm.
 
4. Tighten both idle mixture screw all the way (not too tight, could
damage seat) then open 1.5 turns. From this point, working on each
carburetor individually, turn left or right until
engine runs smoothest. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVE IDLE MIXTURE SCREWS IN
CLOSED POSITION. Repeat this fine-tuning on other carb.
 
5. Loosen idle stop screws until idle speed is 650-750 rpm.
 
6. Use special device P 75 [this is the old Unisyn; you'd be much better off
buying the more modern STE Synchrometer with the appropriate rubber adapter;
see ads in Porsche magazines, lots of places have it].
 
[following is for old Unisyn] Turn idle mixture screws to place ball about
halfway up in tube.
 
7. Without turning screw on Unisyn, place on other carb and
turn idle stop screw to place ball at same level as other carb.
 
8. Turn idle mixture screws on both carbs so that ball shows minimal
oscillations.
 
9. Press throttle linkage rods back onto carbs. ACHTUNG! Adjust length of
rods if necessary so that they fit right onto ball ends without being
forced.
 
10. Set idle speed with hand throttle to 1200-1300 rpm. Check for same
throttle opening with Unisyn again, as under #7 and #8. If the levels are
not the same for both carbs, adjust linkage length.
 
11. Check idle speed again.
 
12. Check accelerator pump volume, 0.2- 0.3 cc for two strokes.
 
13. Check stop bolt for throttle pedal. When throttle pedal is floored,
throttle arms on carbs should be about 1 mm short of hitting end of travel.
 
14. Put air cleaners back on.
 
Remark: If smooth idle is not achievable, the throttle body must be checked
according to section 8 KR. The carbs must be removed for this procedure.
 
 
If you adapt sections 7 & 8 for the Synchrometer, that's it.

Subject: James Dean & Beck Spyder

John Berry asked if anybody had retraced James Dean's route.
 
A couple of years ago, I was testing a Beck Spyder for a car magazine. It
was even tricked out with the number 130 and "Little Bastard" written across
the engine lid. The photographer and I decided to go up to the accident
scene and shoot it there. So we have photos of the car parked by the
monument, reflected in the monument, and in front of the Cholame "post
office" (read: shack). On the way, we passed famous Brown Material Road and
did a self-timed photo of ourselves examining our shoe soles <g>.
 
Then we shot the car in Paso Robles and headed back to LA the next day. We
had nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon, the photographer asked what we
should do now, the sun was too high for photography, so I suggested we rent
"Rebel without a Cause." Watched that. Got idea. We went up to Griffith
Observatory to shoot the Spyder after sundown, lit by our truck headlights.
While shooting in front of the place where the last scenes in "Rebel" were
filmed, a middle-aged guy came by and asked if this was a car like James
Dean had. "Well, yes and no, it's a fiberglass replica but faithful to the
original idea." He said he used to hang out with James Dean. Yeah, sure, we
thought, everybody in Hollywood probably says that. He then said he used to
ride around in his white Speedster before he sold it to buy the 550. Now it
gets interesting; most wannabes don't know about the Speedster. Maybe this
guy is for real. I said we were shooting here because the movie ended here.
"Oh, yeah, I was in that movie." Really? Who did you play? "I was second in
command of the gang, and got shot by Sal Mineo in the old Getty Mansion."
Oh, heck, we just watched you a couple of hours ago on video. He said that
he was hired as 'gang rumble advisor' to the film, out of Hollywood High,
and was sort of talked into acting by James Dean. He's been at it ever
since. Name is Frank Mazzola. He said he never got a ride in the 550, as
Dean was busy prepping it for racing and the accident happened before he
could just cruise around in it. So I suggested he drive the replica down to
the LA Zoo and back up. He got his James Dean 550 ride, just a few decades
late.

Subject: Re: Porsche Hood Shocks

The hood-support thread seems to have reappeared, with 
remarks about doubling the shocks etc:

For those with 912s and older 911s:

    Early 911 hoods are longer and weigh more than current 
    onnes, because the treatment of the hood where it reaches
    the front of the car has changed.  Early hoods wrap down
    to become part of the front of the car; recent hoods stop
    at the top of the bumper.
    So recent shocks aren't designed to hold up older hoods,
    and they die early.

This tidbit is from a recent Automotion catalog.  They added
that they sell old-spec shocks for old-style hoods.

Chris and Hussain.

The roof did change slightly in February 1986 (if I remember right from the 
shop manual) but the relay circuit is the same as the 85.5. There is the main 
relay controlling the roof which is an elctronic type in the fusebox (not so 
easy to test). There are two more relays on the motor plate in the rear that 
are indicated as one relay in the wiring diagram. These would be easy to test 
out of the car. There is an additonal microswitch on the post 86 that 
indicates when the roof is closed (this could be the switch at the front of 
the roof). I think that the pre 85.5's are similar. 

Sorry I don't have the manual to hand to verify all the details so this is 
from memory - feel free to correct me if i'm wrong guys.

Regarding the microswitches, I thought that my roof was operating "correctly" 
until I realised that being able to unlock the roof at speed was not 
Porsche's expectation for the design! (unlike a convertable Ford Mustang that 
I once drove. Being able to open a convertible top whilst moving could have 
interesting results). Definitely worth checking all 4.

Subject: 911 Blower Removal

Fellow Porschephiles,

I want to repaint my engine blower fan but I'm not
absolutely sure how to get it off. I can get the
belt pully off, but how do I get the blower
off the alternator shaft?

There's plainly not enough room between the blower
and the rear sheet metal to get a puller in
there. My Haynes manual says the blower can
be removed with the engine in the car, unlike
the alternator and upper air channel, but it
doesn't say how. Do I just beat it with a hammer
until it comes off (scary)?

I know many of you have taken off your ugly,
discolored blower fans and made them pretty
again, so please help me. Direct email replies
appreciated.

Subject: 951 rattle solution

Are you bothered by rattles coming from the rear of your 951?  I know I was.
I searched and searched and couldn't find the source until it occurred to me
that when I was applying the brakes the rattle went away. 
Turns out the problem is with the brake pads in the rear calipers. The
backing plates for the pads are a sloppy fit in the caliper. This seems to be
especially prevalent in aftermarket pads although I have since learned that
it can be a problem with factory pads as well.
The result is that the backing plates shake up and down over rough roads
resulting in the backing plates hitting the rotor "hats". This produces the
rattling noise.
The solution is to make sure that the pads are held more firmly in the
caliper. You can accomplish this by altering the retaining spring or shimming
the pads until any slop is eliminated. I used some thin aluminum shims and it
works just fine.
The other solution is to turn up the radio.
Hope this helps.

Hiall,

Just in for a brief summary and feedback and some viewpoints.

I tried keeping the 356-list discussion 'off line', as some has
brought it 'on line' I might as well comment them in a broader forum.

Problem; what does a unstructural person do when his/hers mailbox
receives 50 messages a day? Deletes some, reads some, save some.....!
I'm sure I've deleted messages I should have answered to, because
maybe the header put me off, or I did it unknowingly....

Solution; Forum for 'similar-interested-in-your-interest' people.
There are many possibilities, real high-level it is only a simple mail-alias,
just update it now and then and distribute it to the 'members'. This
is possible but it is much more difficult to organize than a maillist.

Note my mail program today,......'Friend does not let friend do DOS

Subject: Re: 911 Blower Removal

Unfortunately I've had to remove my blower several times. It's held on by 
the big nut and a key. The shaft is slightly tapered (or so it seems) and 
once you hunker down that nut it gets real tight. We have fabricated a 
puller using a piece of 3/4" steel with two holes drilled in it just 
larger than the blower diameter. Then we took two 3/8" long bolts, put a 
95 degree bend at the end, cleaned up the bend with a file, and hooked 
the bolts behind the blower hub. If you tighten up the bolts with the 
blower nut on the shaft flush with the end, you can pop the blower off 
by  backing out the nut. Even though we used a generous amount of  
anti-sieze the last time, it took considerable force to break it loose. 
It's true there isn't a great deal of room to work behind the engine but 
if you're careful with the dimensions of the "puller" it works quite 
well. It seems to me we're having to use too much force, but I don't see 
any other way to do it. Perhaps there are some smarter folk out there!

Subject: Re: Some questions (long answer)


Richard - 

I've waited to give an answer to your question of "Are Porsches
worthwhile to own," to see if some of the more knowledgable
and erudite amongst us would respond. Hopefully they will but
meantime, I'll throw my couple of phennings your way.

I hadn't paid much attention to the marque for a long time (kids,
vans, soccer games, dance practices left no time or money to indulge)
but life being what it is, things allowed for the purchase of one
a couple of years ago.  I must say I have never appreciated any
thing mechanical as much as I have this car. It is, simply, a joy.
The car is a better car than I will ever be a driver. Thus the 
challange: to become a better driver.  If you were lucky enough to 
read Kim's travelog on driving a new 993 in Europe, you could tell that 
this is truly one of the ultimate pleasures of this life.  For me, I'm 
at the other end of the wide spectrum of drivers: it's my daily haul to 
and from anywhere (she got the van and gives me the single digit salute 
in the winter and I smile and wave in the summer). I wish I didn't have to use
it that way and someday I won't have to. Meanwhile, it gets me there
reliably every time I ask it to. 

It being a mechanial baby, it's going to wear and occasionally break. To
fix means to spend money - this isn't a Ford or Toyota Corolla that you can
run down to the nearest auto parts store and necessarily pick up what 
you need.  This is a car where parts tend to be expensive because of the
rather limited number manufactured (economy of scale in reverse) and the
number of competent fixers are fewer than those for Buicks.  What you have 
noticed on this list is a cross section of a wide variety of models
over an even wider variety of years. You have people talking about driving
and maintaining 356s from the '60s along with others doing the same with their
models from the '70s, '80s and up to the present day.  These people see
their value in what they have and are willing to do what it takes to
keep it so.

If some of us seem a little shrill at times about certain maintnance features,
it's because we are trying to convey that some things (though they actually
be few in number) *must* be done in order keep the car from becoming an
expensive, and sad, pile of junk. As an example, my 944 is actually very easy
to tune up: plugs, "points" and air filter. Change the oil at regular
intervals (depends on your driving) keep it clean and spiffy (you will
want to do this) and do the driver's manual check items and off you go.
But the cam/timing belt is an absolute must to be replaced on schedule.
The price of ignoring it or ignorance is a new engine. That ain't cheap.

Has the last three years of ownership been worth it? Yes. 
Knowing then what I now would I do it again? Yes.
Why? Well, I've fallen in love the beast and I look so damn good in it! (can't
deny the ego value, either).

It is worth it to you? Only you can decide that and then only by actually buying,
driving and enjoying it will you know for sure.

Stan repeated a few weeks ago what someone had said some months back, "Porsches
will get you through times of no sex better than sex will get you through times
of no Porsches."  This is truer than you may believe!

I hope you go for it and let us know what happens.

Good luck,

The guides may feel fine, or even measure fine, now when they're out of the

Hi, Jordan.
 
How bad is your original headliner? If it isn't torn, it can be re-dyed to
look fresh.
 
The same process can be used to dye a replacement headliner any color or
shade you like. There are guys who go around to used car dealers and fix
tears in vinyl and re-dye vinyl and leather. I had the original headliner of
one of my 356s redyed to cover the leaching rubber and glue stains for about
$100, because of the problem you're having now -- the repro headliners look
different.
 
The vinyl dyes are made by several companies including SEM. Auto paint
specialists may carry them.

Hi, Kim.
 
Thanks for the travelogue. You hit some of my personal favorite spots. Did
you stay at the Chateau d'Isenbourg? Neat place, great restaurant. My idea
of a fun weekend was heading off to friends in Strasbourg on Friday after
work, and exploring roads in the Vosges hills west and south of town. Thanks
also for telling everybody that the autobahn isn't all it's cracked up to
be, so to speak. Deep down, nobody believes you can't blast along on it all
day long.
 
If you had given enough warning, I would have given you a list of other
stuff to do around Baden-Baden and Stuttgart and such. There's a great
open-air restaurant outside B-B, just past the SWF radio antenna, called
Klosterschenke, with views of vineyards and the Rhine valley. And the
theme swimming pool in B-B, the Carcalla-Therme, is kinda neat. And when in
B-B, gotta go to the casino, just to say you did it.
 
I hope you took the time to at least see the Porsche museum. The Mercedes
museum is much bigger and well worth the commuter rail ride to the other
side of town.
 
I used to do top speed runs to test cars on the section from Karlsruhe north

Hi, Andrew.
 
>What's so special about the bolts holding calipers together?
 
The strength grade. 11.9 is a high-strength bolt. You can get these from
well-stocked local nut and bolt suppliers. These should not be re-used. The
torque may be low, but you have high force on the pistons trying to split
the calipers apart. Also they're loaded in bending. Considering that it's
your butt, replacing these is probably the cheapest part of a caliper

Dear porsche experts,
	I have a question you probobally have discussed before but seeing 
as i'm new here, please help me.  My father recently bought me a wrecked 
83' 944 as a driver.  After fixing up the body, i'm now looking to add 
some to the performance.  What do you recommend?  Some say the chips are 
the way to go.  Others say I should stick to suspension.  I realize that 
i'm not presently capable of driving the car to it's full potential but i 
do intend to get involved with professional instruction and some track 
time as money allows.  Any experience you have or advice would be helpful.

Where do you get 944 "points" and where do you put them once you got 'em?

Subject: 1984 911, Buying Questions

Hello Porschephiles,
 I'm new to the group and have been trying to absorb all the good info. out
there on this board.  I'm buying my first Porsche and need help.  I have
several books that have been recommended and have looked at several SC and
Carreras.  This '84 has 80K miles but is in superb shape and runs great.
 What kind of reliability can I expect from the 3.2 liter?  I understand the
3.0 liter is good for 200,000 miles without a teardown, can I expect that ?
 I'll have the car checked out by a Porsche mechanic.  Also, the brakes,
clutch, tires & targa have been replaced.
  I know you've answered this type of question many times before but I don't
have access to the FAQs via AOL.
 Thanks for all the previous good info. and in advance for the help on this.

I've been running 100W/55W (that's right, 100W low beams, 55W high beams)

appears identical for the high and low beam circuits, so I figure the low

BTW the H1's are very good at keeping the light below the level of the

Subject:  944 questions

Dear P'philes:

1. Strongly considering move to "newer" 944, and weighing turbo vs. non-turbo
such as S or S2.  Please give yr thoughts on relative merits.  I've got the
book w/ old magazine reviews on the cars, and their advice in the late 80s
was that the S2 in particular was more tractable under the conditions I drive
in (e.g., town/suburbs/weekend flings on the twisties).  Is the 3 L S2 engine
a vibrating beast, or do the shafts tame it as well as my 2.5 L?  Relative
service/maint. costs?

2. Still need to replace or re-dye luggage area carpet and carpet around
shift lever on my '83 944.  Have asked the list before for advice on sources
w/o success.  Anybody know anything on this?

3. George B. kindly sent me a replacement rubber seal for the air passageway
on the rear edge of the driver's door.  How do I get the plastic ring out to
replace the seal w/o damaging something?  (It is amazing how such a simple
device can baffle one [me, anyway]).

4. This has been covered before in midst of various (lost) threads, but any
advice on products for treating my rubber seals?  How about the spoiler (mine
is getting sl. dull)?

Thanks to all; I am sorry to see some familiar names signing off the list.
Sure hope they'll get cold and lonely and drift back to sit by the fire w/
us....

Subject: 356 desire


Many years ago my wife and I sold our '62 356B to help finance my MBA.  Even 
tho we love, and will not part with, our '83 911SC,  we have decided it's 
time to expand our fleet of automobiles to include another 356.  This is not 
going to be a track car, an "investment-grade" car or a restoration project, 
just one to fix up, drive and enjoy.  Reading about Trond's heroic efforts 
has made me realize that I don't have the time, patience or mechanical 
skills for a "project".  What I'm looking for at this time is knowledge. 
 I'm joining the 356 Registry and our local AZ 356 club.  There's a couple 
of books listed in FAQ that I'm going to check into:

     Duane Spencer:  Porsche 356 Performance Handbook
     Dr. Brett Johnson: The 356 Porsche: A Restorer's Guide to Authenticity

Are there any other sources of information or experiences that I should 
check into?  After I figure out exactly what to look for, I'll then start 
the looking process.

Regards.

Subject: 914 Calipers -- Thanks

I just wanted to thank everyone who responded with advice
on the piston removal procedure for the 914 rear brake calipers.
The point of confusion in my case was that the 4mm socket
headed plug bolt had ejected itself from the driver's side
caliper (somewhere on the highway) and the hex adjuster
contained behind said plug ejected also. Now that I realize
what happened I am in a quandry. I picked up a caliper 
rebuild kit from Automotion ($39 for each caliper). Most 
expensive rubber washers I''ve bought in a while. I picked up
a pair of stainless steel hex headed plug bolts also, but I'm still
short an adjuster mechanism for the caliper. Is the adjuster
mainly for the Emergency brake or is it imperative to the operation
of the normal brake also. If it's E-brake only, I'll rebuild the caliper
without it and go with it. Else, I'm hunting for an adjuster mechanism
(yeah those are easy to find...)

Advice?

Subject: 944 Alignment Questions

Hi all,

     How can a person do a fairly accurate wheel alignment on his car at home
without using one of those $20 billion machines that the shops have. Is it
possible to do if one has a good understanding of alignment theory and some
basic tools ??? I'm not even thinking along the lines of *totaly* aligning a
car, just a few *tweeks* here and there. I notice you racers seem to be able
to tweek alignments at the track fairly easily, so what's the deal ???

      Please go easy on me for being so stupid about alignments - it's one of
the few things I've gone to the dealer for in the past. But hey, I'm getting
tired of spending around $150 a pop to align the car so I'm asking about
alternative methods.

Any suggestions are welcome.

I am in the process of setting up a 914 for the track. The car has the
steel flairs on front and back. Im told by some to run 8 inch wheels all
the way round but others say to run 7 front and 8 rear. Their reason is
that 8 inch all round will cause the steering to be overly heavy and might
induce mor oversteer. Thanks for any comments.

They probably stole the V6 information from Autoweek.

Now, Pete, tell us that the misprint a couple of weeks ago was actually a
plot by Autoweek to determine who in the publishing industry is blatantly
plagiarizing your road tests.   :-)

I wonder if the Maestro would care to comment on the firm that advertises in
Excellence, as remanufacturing 356's (full page, white text  on Black).  I
seem to recall reading that they were a first class outfit, and if so, that 
might be a good option to consider.  Maestro, what sayeth thor?

Well, consider the source.  Boxer-6 is probably considered to exotic a
concept to explain to a population that has not had a new VW since '79

Now automotive specialty magazines would never make such a bozo mistake 
Ooops, don't want to offend any folks from ONE famous weekly enthusiast
magazine, so I won't mention the fact that they very recently did 
just that.  Furthermore, Pete Albrecht might tell you, but wild horses

Hi Brian,

YMMV, but the best *FIrst* investment you can make in performance, is in
making yourself a better driver.  Afterall, this investment, properly 
utilized, is transferable to every other car you will ever drive.

In addition, money spent in *go-faster* mods, only increases your chances
for disaster if *You* are not competent to handle what you already have.

Of course, I'm just an ol' country boy, so what do I know...?

Anyway, Welcome to the group, and congratulations on getting a P-toy!
Best of luck to you!

Subject: Re: 944 Performance Upgrades

Hi Carl,

For your 83 944, I would budget my money in the following priority:

1) Join the Porsche Club of America.  The $36 per year gives you access to
Porsche experts, relatively cheap parts, a great magazine and driver
education.

2) Go to driver education.  In the northeast (Delaware is near the
Northeast, isn't it?) there is a multitude of great places to drive. Most of
them are used by PCA regions for driver education and club racing. 
Typically, the cost is $60 to $100 per day, depending on the region, and the
cost of renting the track.  

3) Brakes.  Upgrade your brakes to Cool Carbon or Cool Kevlar.  They squeal,
but they are phenomonal.

4) Suspension. Upgrade to at least 86 Turbo Swaybars and Koni Adjustable
Shocks.  Your car may not have a rear swaybar, in which case you have to buy
the mounting hardware also.  If you are seriously tracking the car with
serious rubber, upgrade the steel front A-arms to the 85/2 or 86 Aluminum
Control Arms.

5) Chips are available for your car. Several suppliers are available, some
of whom are porschephiles.

Of course, this list does not include consumables, like tires, 108 octane
gas, nitrogen for your tires. roll cages, helmets and 5-point harnesses.

Lastly, the cheap thing to do is do items 1 and 2 above, without changing
your car one iota.  (Read: Learn to drive what you have.)

Good luck

Subject: fuel injector testing

If my engine carries on running as poorly as it was this weekend, I'm going to
think more seriously about building a fuel injector test stand.  Is there any
fluid less noxious than gasoline that could be used as the medium for such
testing?  Or anything as dangerous as gasoline that would leave the injectors
cleaner than they were at the start of the test?

The CIS system on the car can be used as a test stand, but if there's gasoling
to sprayed around, I'd rather do it out in the middle of a garage bay than in
a dark, cramped, 12v wired engine compartment.

Thoughts?
Thanks.

Ghost Racing has a 914-6 GT that uses 15x8s all the way around. Drives like
a dream on the track, steering is a little heavy on the street but only
relative to the feather-light "normal" 914 steering. It's more like a late
911 with lots of castor.

Subject: (44 Belts and mounts and Mass Unsubscribes.


Hi gang,

I've seen a few people bow out because of the actions of one idiot.
Relax, things will get back to normal quickly. This is just a lesson in
what happens when a sociopath decides to get attention for himself.

I've seen a few more postings on 944/924S/968 belts and motor mounts.

1) If the engine is vibrating, get it fixed pronto.
2) If someone tells you the balance shafts are out of time, get that
fixed even faster. 
3) If there are no records with your new purchase indicating the last 
time the belts were changed, change them.

The cost to change belts should be no more than $250. If a shop want to 
charge you more, find out why. The belts are no more than $75 and the 
time to change is about two hours (turbos are more) ALL belts, cam and 
balance shafts must be timed together. If the mechanic doesn't know how 
to do it in that time, find another one. 

Always recheck tension with the gauge. Remember to have it re-checked 
2,000 miles after initial installation.

FYI, the Pirelli belt seems to be the best, it seems to stretch the 
least and remain in time.

Motor mounts. The latest motor mounts will run $350 to $400 depending 
on who you buy them from. They will have green paint on them and are 
NOT hydraulic. Figure 5 to 6 hours installation. You can do them 
yourself if you are patient. HINT: remove the front cross-member from
the car when you change them.

Subject: Re: fuel injector testing

Regarding FI (injector) testing: National makes a purpose-built chip (the
LM1949 Injector Drive Controller) which is intended as a driver for fuel
injectors (1 chip per injector, or per group of injectors firing together,
I suppose). It requires very few external components (a Darlington and a
few R's and C's, plus a clock), and does all the neat tricks (different
peak and hold currents, compensation for battery voltage drop, etc.) It's
in a DIP-8 package.

If you plan on making an injector test fixture (out of the car), this may
be the simplest and best way to go.  Call your local distributor for
samples.

Is there a way to clean Euro headlights.  The inside glass is turning
opague.  Also,what should one know about weak links in a 1987 930?  Years
ago, Bruce Anderson wrote about 930's with turbo horror stories,i.e., car
smokes after start up if not driven for a long time.  In the northeast, our
cars lay dormant for at least 6 months.  Will the turbo gremlin strike an
'87 vintage machine?  Is there a way to make the boost come on before 3000+
rpm?

Folks,

Slight addition to Jim Pasha's advice.  Just to set expectations, the cam

belt for a sixteen valve car is a lot more expensive, like a little over 
$180 list
last time I checked.  And don't even think about using an aftermarket belt

Subject: 944S coolant leak


Greetings,

Several weeks ago I asked several questions about my 944S.  One of these had to
do with coolant disapearing and not knowing where it was going.

Well, this weekend I found a nice small puddle under my car.  The coolant seems
to be comming from between the timing belt cover and the engine.  I assume this
means the seals on the water pump are going (gone?).  The leak is still quite small
and I only found the puddle once, no new puddle since Saturday.

Question:  How long can I run the car with this sort of a leak?  The car has over 
94000 miles on it and I have no idea when or if the pump has ever been changed.  
I had been planning on changing the water pump when I change the timming/ballance belts 
in about 6000 miles.  Can I wait this long for the water pump replacement?

Are there any signs to watch for that show a imminent failure?  

Thanks for any advice.

Funny thing, that, my '71 914 NEVER felt like it had ANY shift pattern,
H, HE, or whatever you call that peculiar layout. Moving the shift stick
was like stirring a bowl of jello. Knowing where the bears were supposed to

Thanks to all who relied to my request about installing valve guides.
I was giving some thought (very little, really) on installing them

I have decided to let an expert do this portion of my work for me.  I

Thanks to Pete A. on the reasoning behind valve guide reeming.  I had
suspected this, but wanted to be sure.

Subject: 951 Wheel Bearings

This weekend I decided to find my power steering leak and while
I was in the process of it I checked my suspension.  It appears
that I have a bad front right wheel bearing.  This doesn't seem
too bad to fix, but in the European Select catalog there is no
bearing listed for my '87 951.  According to it, I have to 
replace the entire control arm.  Is this true or did I miss something?
This will seriously irritate me if I have to spend $650 just to
replace a bearing!

As it turned out, my problem with the steering rack was that a
hose that ran from one side to the other of the rack was 
disconnected on the passenger side.  I hooked this back up
and I haven't lost any power steering fluid yet.  When I 
turn sharply I still hear some grinding - I'm hoping this
is just air bubbles in the pump.  How do you bleed a power
steering system?

One additional question:  How much would a decent set of track
wheels cost for my car.  I don't want anything pretty.  They
just have to be the correct size and straight.

Thanks,

Finished refinishing (sounds funny) my fuel tank this weekend.  Really came
out quite nice.  Thanks to all who gave advice on chemicals, paints and
undercoatings.

I stripped the tank to bare metal, ground off all traces of rust and
applied the Scotch anti-rust metal prep, a coat of zinc based primer
and Scotch black undercoating.  This was all done after re-sealing the
insides with the product from Hirsch (sp).

Looks great and after test fitting the tank, and looking under the
car, the rest definitely will be redone.

Am I the only one, or do the rest of you encounter this.  You begin one
thing and find that to do right, three more need to happen and because
of those three, nine more and so on.  Or am I just being too neurotic. B^)

Steve,
You already have seen the signs of imminent failure. Don't put off the
inevitable. Overheating on your car is VERY serious, as it is on all
waterpumpers. 
BTW while it's apart be sure to replace the timing belt and balance shaft
belt. The labor is the same since they have to be removed in the process.

RE> 914 AFC (L-jet) question
>I want to know if there is any way for me to recalibrate

    The "right way" (at least, according to the factory manual)
to do this is to hook up a CO-meter to the exhaust.  Tweak the
knob until you get about 2% CO *before* the cat.  (75's have the
catalytic converter, right?)  This is done as an adjustment on 
the *whole* system, and can be used to compensate for vaccuum
leaks, etc.

    The screw adjusts the amount of air that bypasses the flap.  It
will adjust your mixture.  In (right to tighten) should mean that
the flap measures more of the air coming through the intake, and
should richen the mixture.  Out (left to loosen) should mean that
the flap measures less of the air coming in (more of it is un-
measured) and so should lean out the mixture.
    Rich is an unusual mode for the 1.8s, usually they get some sort
of vaccuum leak somewhere and run lean (like mine).
    Also check the cold start valve and the switch that controls it.
The switch may be stuck "on", or the valve may leak even when closed.

Subject: 944 S2 Questions 

Porsche Fans:

I would like to upgrade my 944 S2 from the 7 & 8 cast alloys 
to the Forged 7.5 & 9" x 16" alloys.  I understand that the S2 
came with a sport chassis option that offered the forged 
alloys.  

My first question is, do I have to upgrade the chassis in order 
to upgrade to the forged alloys? 

My second question is, does anyone know where I can pick up a 
set of forged alloys without having to spend 2 grand?

Also, I m having a problem with the power trunk lid.  It seems 
when I press the switch nothing happens...  Hmmm, Im not 
really sure what is suppose to happen?  I replaced the trunk 
shocks but that didnt help.  When I turn  the key entry to the 
trunk the latch opens but the trunk lid does not lift under the 
pressure of the shocks.  Is this normal behavior?  Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Has anyone figured out how to reliably stop the windshield wiper shudder that

I've tried cleaning the windshield daily with Windex, replacing the wipers, 
Rain-X, and in one case (because it was time anyway) replacing the windshield 
itself.  None of these actions seems to have made much difference . . . at

By the way, I have the same problem on the flat-windsheild of my '73 VW Bug as

Hi, 

 I drive a '79 924, "slightly" adjusted, it has a 944 body with a 
so called 'testarossa kit', tires : 205/45 in front, 245/50 rear ...
also some engine tuning was done when I bought this car.
Anyway, my problem is that my wife complains about the heating,
the air comming into the car at her feet is never cold, I have no problems
with this, but it's true, her side of the car (passenger seat) blows
heated air ... even when heating is off, it blows warm air ...
I mentioned that oil temperature raised too since a couple of months,
before it was ALLWAYS at 1/3, now during normal driving, it's 1.5/3 to
2/3. Radiator flushed, water pump replaced, termostat replaced, ... ???????
My solution is to buy a new 911 Tiptronic-S, but I'm not the only one 
at home ...

     I am in the process of fixing a nasty oil leak.  I have isolated the leak 
     to the turbo.  I have removed it, and the compressor housing.  I noticed 
     that there is a bit of play side-to-side, and when I fill the turbo with 
     oil, it leaks around the compressor blade.  
     
     I have removed the compressor blade and the ring holding in the plate 
     behind the blade, but am now stuck.  The plate that seems to hold it all 
     together won't come out.  It there some trick to getting it out?

First of all thanks to Jerry and others who posted the follow-up on my
EPA testing inquiry.

Well I finally passed the EPA, but I don't know what the mechanic did.
He adjusted the mixture which reduced the CO significantly but not to 
the required specs.

Then he told me that he will alter something temporary, which will make
the car pass the EPA but that I will have to come back after the test so
he can undo this temporary fix. I don't know what he did but I do remember
him raising the car and dismounting the front left tire on both occasion.
Total Cost $60. 

I know the folks on this list have mention about the O2 sensor being
located on that side, but I was looking for speculation as to what
the guy did to reduce the CO numbers. Since this is an annual thing
I want to keep the car under EPA compliance. Assuming that he disconnected
the O2 sensor would that effect performance.

thanks,

Husain

Hello 'philes,

I ran my 1st autox yesterday and had an absolute blast!!!  My 914/6 is still 
on jackstands so I took my wife's 1991 Toyota Tercel with the "sport" 
package.  This consisted of 4 doors, automatic tranny, and 155/80 SR 13 
tires.  :-)

I managed to place 2nd in my class even though I was up against higher 
powered cars.  I lost to an experienced driver in a Paseo.  I don't feel bad 
 - I feel great!!!  I was freaked as hell at the start, and I surprised both 
the announcer and myself by not getting a DNF nor hitting any cones on my 3 
runs.  My times were 87.898, 81.816, and 79.637.

I had a blast and learned *A LOT* about how the car handles under high-speed 
cornering.  This was the first time I've really pushed the car since I don't 
believe in learning about that on the street!  I can definitely see how these 
events would help in making you a better driver.

Thanks for your encouragement, Stan.  To those who haven't done this: try it 
 - especially the 911 owners!!!  Learn what your car does when it's pushed to 
the limits.  It's fun and *SAFE*.

Trond writes, "The porschephiles list is the *best* porsche list for general
purposes, but if you're mostly into the old 4cyl 4bangers the 'noise-ratio'
gets abowe 95%."

First of all, this *should* be discussed on the list, and not by direct
e-mail. 

When I bought my new '61 Normal Coupe, I bought a Porsche. When I bought my
used '55 Speedster, I bought a Porsche. And, when I bought my used '86 951,
as a garage companion to the other two, I bought a Porsche. I'm interested
in every thing Porsche does - all Porsche cars. What in the world do your
mean, "noise-ratio?" 

A Porsche is a Porsche is a Porsche is a . . . . (except maybe those owned
by a DOS user).

Yes.

When I was trying to locate my sunroof problem I checked the micro switch
which was sort of loose and was effecting the normal operation of the
sunroof.
I don't think that is your problem because you have a functional sunroof.

I did disassemble the rear assembly (curiosity :-) ) but don't remember
(as someone else posted to this list ) that there is a second relay
in the rear. My guess is that in the newer model that relay might have
been moved into fuse box as shown by the Haynes Manual. But remember
this is only a guess, may be someone with a shop manual can confirm this
for you. ( Hello Kevin )

Hope this helps.

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               ALL: re: 356 list



	I like the idea of a 356 only list, but I do understand the
concern of losing this content from p-files. Two alternatives I propose:

	1- separate 356 list and Cc: porschephiles; or

	2- use the first 3 spaces of the subject line to indicate which
cars are being referred to (ie, 356,911,944,etc, or ALL,AIR,H2O)
	
	This second alternative (which I think someone might have
suggested before) would allow people with limited time (or expensive
access time for those of us who don't get this access with work) to
quickly scan their mail for the info that interests them. 

	I think it would be great to keep everyone in good communication
with each other, and using a 3-character code in the subject line might
actually encourage some of the busier people to stay with the list because
it would be more user friendly.

	All this system would take to implement is for people to start
using these codes in their subject lines, like I have above. Of course,
you can still write a regular subject after the code. Show your support by
using these codes, or post your suggestions/comments.

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               RE>Rebuilding 914 ign switch.


  Brian, and my Porschephile friends;
  Yes, the switch can be cleaned and reused.
  Procedure:
  Use an X/acto knife blade to gently pry the 2 tabs on the side
of the switch body apart to separate the contacts from the cover.
  Be careful not to flex the nylon too far or the tabs will break.
  Use a solvent to clean the center and outer contacts on both
halves of the switch.  You may have to use a pencil eraser to scrub
the oxides off the contact zone, an ink eraser works best.
  Re-lube with silicone grease and reassemble.
  End procedure.

  The switch body is keyed so you cannot mess it up.  The center contact
is silver plated and is the starter contact.  While you have it apart
inspect carefully for heat warpage that might cause mis-alignment of
the internals and aggravate the fail mode.

  I've posted this before about the cause of this failure:
  There is no spike supressor diode across the starter's engagement
solenoid.  The ~300V spike is enough to fritz the contacts over time.
  Adding a 1n4004 or 4005 in proper polarity will permanent fix.

  Not sure, but all 9xx cars may share in this..

Subject: Re: Porschephiles #885 Mon Oct 3 02:00:03 CDT 1994

I wanted to thank everyone on the Porschephiles list.  I got a wonderful
response to my question about rebuilding the ignition switch of my 914 -
especially from Kyle.  (I had also posted the same question in the VW
newsgroup, but all I got from them was rude comments!)

I followed Kyle's instructions, and found that everything he had 
described was exactly like mine.  So, it appears that even the 914
shares the same mechanism as some of it's more expensive cousins.

I did have one small hitch - taking the switch out of the sleeve that
houses the ignition lock.  After I got everything into a better light,
I discovered a small screw.  Normally, I wouldn't have a screwdriver
that small, but I recently bought a small "eyeglasses repair kit" at
the drugstore, and it included a small screwdriver, which was exactly 
the size I needed.

Once the switch was out, it came apart exactly as Kyle had described.
The contacts were pitted, and once I got them burnished, the switch
worked correctly.  Tonight, it goes back in to the steering column.

On a non-related thread:  There was a discussion about "varmits".
I had to place a tent of plastic over my 914, then roll a bug-bomb
underneath.  Seems I had a nest of red wasps in the bumper.  The
next morning, there were about a dozen dead wasps under the plastic.  
They tried to fly out when the bomb went off, but they were trapped
under the plastic.  NOW maybe I can adjust the clutch cable!

Thanks for the help, everybody!

There's been a lot of discussions about 911 temperatures.  Interestingly, 
the owner's manual only says that when the temp gets to the red bar (in cars 
without numbered gauges) is the temperature excessive.  The bottom of the 
red bar translates to 302F degrees.  (The guages have degrees C printed on 
the far left side of the bars, back behind the face of the guage).  IMHO, 
Porsche either felt that less than 300 degrees was not too hot, they knew 
the cars would run very hot and did not want to scare owners or they wanted 
to sell lots of overheating-derived repairs (I think it's really choice 2). 


General concensus from the experts seems to be that 300 degrees is much too 
hot for long engine life.  A typical solution is to replace the front oil 
loop with either a factory or aftermarket oil radiator.  I've used both 
Terbotrol and B&B with the B&B appearing to work slightly better for my car, 
YMMV.  Depending on the how hot the climate where you live is, auxilliary 
cooler fans may be helpful. .  My temp (in Phoenix) still runs 230-240 when 
it's hot out, in traffic, with the air on so next year I'm going to add a 
fan.  You should price shop around salvage centers to find a system out of 
an 84 or an 87+ model (if you want the aux fan) to compare with the 
aftermarket products.  Be sure to really clean out a salvage system. 
 Mobile1 (or any synthetic) will help reduce the temperature, which you've 
already done.

Regards.

When I had the clutch replaced on my 87, my mechanic performed an update that
changed the bearings the the throwout bearing fork rotates in and the fork.
This is appearantly a Porsche recommended update - before they did the work,
he explained the problem with the original needle bearings and showed me a
tech note describing the update. I also saw the old bearings while they were
still in the bell housing (is that a proper term for a p-car?) and they were
trashed. The pedal effort was much lower and smoother after the fix. I also
had the rubber center clutch plate (the cause for my clutch problems)
replaced with a spring centered clutch plate and it appears to work fine.

If my memory is correct, I paid $1600 for the complete job including the
update. I think the update added 250-300 to the job.

loop with either a factory or aftermarket oil radiator.  I've used both 
Terbotrol and B&B with the B&B appearing to work slightly better for my car, 
YMMV.  Depending on the how hot the climate where you live is, auxilliary 
cooler fans may be helpful. .  My temp (in Phoenix) still runs 230-240 when 
it's hot out, in traffic, with the air on so next year I'm going to add a 
fan.  You should price shop around salvage centers to find a system out of 
an 84 or an 87+ model (if you want the aux fan) to compare with the 
aftermarket products.  Be sure to really clean out a salvage system. 
 Mobile1 (or any synthetic) will help reduce the temperature, which you've 
already done.

Regards.

This is a different system from the US models.  In my 83SC there is only the 
auto heat control dial, no levers.  Not having a manual for that car myself, 
I would venture a guess that the cable connected to the dial mechanism had 
failed.

This should be in the regular owners manual.  You should be able to order 
one through a Porsche dealer.

>How do the dash levers control the temperature, in conjunction with the

>control lever) ?
This lever controls fan speed for ventilation air.  As it moves from left to 
right it first opens fresh air vents and then turns on the fan.  It does not 
help increase warm air flow on car with the auto temp control (the "lever" 
controls do this).

>The levers on the dash are sort of stiff to move.  Is this normal?
They should not be real stiff.  You should feel just a slight resistance.

>Oh yeah-Does that little stubby rubber thermostat up by the rear view 
mirror really
>work as a climate control?
Yes it works well, as long as the connector wire hasn't come loose.  You can 
undo the screws that hold it up and check to see if the wire still makes a 
good connection.  If it has come loose, then the thermostat doesn't work.

Regards.

     To All,
     
     I just wanted to post a notice to everyone that has a 944x.
     I just went through a bad experience that actually turned out pretty 
     good at the end. I own a '86 944 and was changing the front hood 
     shocks when out of the blue the bottom of the shock just tapped the 
     bottom of the window and shattered about a one inch section of the 
     lower windshield. Needless to say this grew within a week to cover the 
     hole shield. For those of you that have ever cracked a 944 windshield, 
     you know that this is one of the most expensive w/s on the market at a 
     install price of avg. $1100. 
     On line here I was directed to one of the most friendly based 944 
     parts companies that you could ever deal with. 
     Porsche All 944 (1 800 255-7944) Even though they didn't have a W/S
     they where very helpful in directing me to someone that did.
     Glass Wholesalers (or Distributors) 800 421-1414 had factory OEM W/S 
     for $440. Once I received it, the company that was to install it 
     couldn't get it in. (To keep this as short as possible I will skip the 
     details. This glass does not go in like normal glass.)
     Don was eager enough to tell me that if they needed someone to walk 
     them through the process, via phone, he would. I was nervous having 
     someone put it in that had obviously had no experience with P-Cars.
     But they had more experience installing car glass than anyone in the 
     state. 
     In making a return call to Glass Distributors, Don tried to forewarn 
     me to be real careful with this W/S. He said,"we ship most of this 
     glass to people that are trying to change hoodshocks or readjust their 
     hoods". He commented that he was going to write a article to warn 
     people of this in an upcoming issue of Pana. At this point I had to 
     tell him of my idiotic adventure and that I wished that I had talked 
     to him sooner.
     After thinking about it, I decided to give an FYI to all here just in 
     case. Hopefully this will give you a heads up when playing under the 
     hood or around the windshield wipers. This is a very sensitive area.
     And, I would personally give a THUMBS UP! to both of the companies 
     listed above.

Stan writes . . . 
 
OK, I'm a certifiable Porsche nut. I've had at least one each of the air  
cooled street cars, none each of the water cooled cars, have lusted after the 
Mooney with the Porsche engine, seriously considered getting my dad a 
Porsche Junior tractor, etc. This list is consequently for all things 
Porsche. 
 
I understand Trond's concerns though -- if I want to get a 356 specific 
answer, I have to wade through a PILE of non-356 stuff. In fact, the 
356 content is just about zero. So from *THAT* perspective, the signal 
(356 content) to noise (everything else) ratio is pretty bad. 
 
Here's the kicker: you find tidbits of info that are useful in all the 
other "non-356" stuff. Like welding tips from Kyle talking about 914s, 
or brake plumbing tips from Nathan Ulrich talking about race-grade 944s, 
or interior tips from people talking about concour prep for Carrera RSs. 
When we start splitting the list up, we lose that. 
 
My personal solution to this is to maintain my own private list of people 
that share certain interests -- on paper. That way I know who to shoot 
a private mail message to for a clear and concise response in real time 
about specialized topics. I've created my own personal network of contacts 
and people I turn to when I need info.  People I would not have met except 
via this list. People I would not have respected enough to value their 
opinions except for what I've heard of their advice and opinions on this 
list. 
 
So, if there *ARE* little specialized sub-lists out there, that's

I do think it would be helpful to informally adopt as a standard (where

OK, I'm a certifiable Porsche nut. I've had at least one each of the air 
cooled street cars, none each of the water cooled cars, have lusted after the
Mooney with the Porsche engine, seriously considered getting my dad a
Porsche Junior tractor, etc. This list is consequently for all things
Porsche.

I understand Trond's concerns though -- if I want to get a 356 specific
answer, I have to wade through a PILE of non-356 stuff. In fact, the
356 content is just about zero. So from *THAT* perspective, the signal
(356 content) to noise (everything else) ratio is pretty bad.

Here's the kicker: you find tidbits of info that are useful in all the
other "non-356" stuff. Like welding tips from Kyle talking about 914s,
or brake plumbing tips from Nathan Ulrich talking about race-grade 944s,
or interior tips from people talking about concour prep for Carrera RSs.
When we start splitting the list up, we lose that.

My personal solution to this is to maintain my own private list of people
that share certain interests -- on paper. That way I know who to shoot
a private mail message to for a clear and concise response in real time
about specialized topics. I've created my own personal network of contacts
and people I turn to when I need info.  People I would not have met except
via this list. People I would not have respected enough to value their
opinions except for what I've heard of their advice and opinions on this
list.

So, if there *ARE* little specialized sub-lists out there, that's
OK. My own interests are broad enough that it's not a requirement
for me, and my ego needs are met via enough other things that I don't feel
like I have to somehow "own" all the Porsche content in the world.  And I 
somehow figure that if there's a specialized list out there that

What is the great advantage of a 4 wheel drive system in a sports car like a
Porsche? I know it will transmit power to all wheel simultaneously, making
for better traction, but does this really alter performance for the
recreational driving these cars are mostly used for? Is it worth the $6000
difference in cost? What other aspects of handling are affected? I appreciate

  It sounds like you stripped the center hub out of your clutch
disk.  Were you by chance accelerating and changing gears when 
this happened?  I bet you have a clutch with rubber pucks as torsional
shock springs in the clutch disk.  These can fail just like you
describe.  Have you been able to 'catch' it and make it grip long
enough to limp it to a shop?  How aged is your clutch and how was
it performing when hard accelerating (passing)?

  Sorry Greg, but I would say plan on getting at the very least

 Steve,
Take care of this problem immediately.  I've heard of guys driving
their cars with these types of leaks and never experiencing problems,
however, I had my water pump seize up on me and came within a
a fraction of MM of shearing my timing belt.  Luckily my mechanic
had the foresight to tell me to have the car flatbedded in rather than
driving it.  Water pumps are cheap compared to the damage you
can do if one seizes up on you.

Subject: Re: Welding and Don's 914 hinge rework.



  Don, and 'philers.

  Sorry, but cant help with your FI problem.  (ask me anything about
GM TBI and TPI systems tho')

  On your hinge rework..
  For these, a light weight MIG will do a wonderful job.  The stick
welder might just blow holes in the panel (which is the backside of
the wheelhouse) unless you are *very* good at stick welding panels.

  Replacing these is one of the easier tasks on a 914, and a great
starting point if you move on to other things in need of repair.
  The most difficult part is removing the remains of the old hinge
mounts in preparation for installing the new.  It is a cramped place
to work unless you got the powerplant out, even then...
  Remove the engine deck lid, its only two 10mm bolts.
  Another glitch in this task is those pesky springs, use the MIG
or buzz box to *make* the right tool for that job. practice, practice.

  But, in practicality you may be better off just prepping the car
and taking the mount(S)? and all to a welding shop for the one time
installation.  Be sure to mark where the old hinge mounts were so things
line up again as they should, umm use a pin drift to dent the panel
right thru the bolt hole and use that as the index for the new parts.
  I used 'rosette' welds to reattach the mount plates, and I hog
out a drain hole at the bottom of the 'cup' and coat with 'cold zinc'
after welding to prevent rust reoccurance.

  Oh, cant get the old bolts out?  Shame, these need lubrication to
keep 'em from seizing in the bearing surface.  That is what starts 
this process of breaking the mounts away from the spot welds.
  There is a fix tho' it entails drilling a hole into the bolt face
and inserting a zerk fitting, and cutting a groove and drilling a 
channel in the bearing surface to allow a shot of grease to fill in.
  Anyone know if these are available from aftermarket?  sources?

  Shoot me a note if you need more detail.

I think the company you mean is Glass Suppliers, Inc. in Sterling, VA, who
advertise in PANO.  Mention you're a PCA member and they'll give you a good
price.  I got a new SEKURIT windshield installed from them along with the rear
hatch re-glued for about $650.  Less than half what the dealer wanted :)

My 2 cents about insurance:  After about 10 years with CSAA (AAA for
California) I ended up switching to Nationwide and saving $500 per year. 
This surprised me because I price shopped on a regular basis and didn't think
that there could be that much savings available.  The savings were primarily
from the Porsche (951).  The total bill is $1600/year for three cars and two
drivers (clean records).  
'86 951  (my daily driver  8k miles per year)
'89 Nissan Maxima (wife's daily driver 18k miles per year)
'92 Ford Explorer 4WD (weekend pleasure rate)
The Porsche is the cheapest out of the three.

I had the same problem on my 914.  After lots of good advice
from porschephiles I finally got smart and checked the
CV joints on the car.  It turned out that the right
inner CV joint had sheared.  

To find the problem I eventually jacked up the rear of
the car and manually turned the the rear wheels while looking
at the CV joints - and then ran the car in gear (with
help) and watched the CV joints.  Then it became obvious,
the inner CV joint would turn, but the half shaft
wouldn't.  Took me a while to find it though.

Good luck, Alex

Fellow Porschephiles,

Some of my exhaust valve cover studs have "become one" with the nut, thus
forming a bolt. And in trying to remove the nut, I removed the "bolt"
instead, and therefore the stud. So,

What size are the exhaust valve cover studs in a 1980 911SC engine?

Also, what is the best stuff to put on them when I put the new ones back in the
cam housing so they won't easily come out again? Locktite?

Subject: 930 turbo vapor lock

Only recently became a Porsche owner and E-mail user but hope someone can 
help with Porsche problem.  I have had a difficult time starting the 
automobile after driving it, turning it off and allowing the engine heat 
to build up after short periods of time, approx. 20+ minutes or so.  I've 
been told the reason is fuel vaporization from engine heat prior to ignition.
One mechanic redid the ignition sequence so that the electronic fuel 
pumps can be activated prior to ignition, thus allowing liquid gasoline 
into the lines replacing the vapor but this has not solved the problem.  
Any suggestions?  The car is a 1977 Turbo Carrera and when it runs, I 
love it, just doesn't always start when I want it to.

Hey Husain,

Here in Las Vegas they do a 'no-load' type emissions test (next year we
go to a dyno-type test). I have a '73 911T with an '83 SC FI engine and
typically if the mixture is rich it will flunk emissions, as it did this
year. The shop that I've been bringing it to made a quick adjustment
(leaned it out, I believe) and it passed with very low numbers. I don't
know if it is this easy with the 944, but if it is, $60 sound kind of
pricey for the adjustment.

George-

On Oct.3 you answered a posting from Carl, and at the end of your answer  
you mentioned consumables, including nitrogen for tires.  This got my 
attention, because about a year ago a person who races some sort of 
stock-cars told me that he uses nitrogen in his tires, I think he said 
it reduces the pressure increase due to heating of the tires.  At the 
time I wondered if this really made any difference, since air, if I 
remember correctly, is abour 70 to 75% nitrogen.  I did not want to quiz 
him to hard and possibly offend him, since he loans me a set of electronic
wheel scales from time to time.  I would like to stay friendly with him.

Can  you explain what the advantage of inflating tires with nitrogen is, 
and is it really useful in driver training situations, with about 30 minute
run sessions.  I have used a pyrometer on my tires and they seem to run 
about 135 degrees.  I would appreciate any wisdom you can shed on this.

Thanks in advance

Subject: 951 wheel offset

In their otherwise very complete description of the differences between the 
944 Turbo and Turbo "S", someone recently stated that all 951s from 87 and on
can use the same wheels. I'm not sure if that's accurate, as the offsets were
changed in 87 and again in 88 for the 951 "S".  Here's the offsets (in mm) 
from the factory 951 manual (other p-philers please correct if this conflicts
with what you know):

Year            Front   Rear
- ----            -----   ----
<=86            23.3mm  23.3mm
87              52.3    52.3
88 non "S"      52.3    52.3   
88 951S         65      60   (928S4 brakes in front, 9" wheels in rear)
89 (all)        65      60   (Manual doesn't distinguish between the 88
                              951S and the 89, so I assume they're the same)

Some C2 models have the 52.3mm offset, so 87 and 88 951 (non-S) owners are in
luck for finding a second set of track wheels.

Steve,

FWIW, my water pump seized with NO warning except a very small trace of dried
coolant on the front of the engine case as you describe. There was no visible
leak. I foolishly decided to "let it get worse". Additionally, by waiting
until the pump seized, the core was gouged up by the impeller when the
bearing failed, making the core worth zero instead of $50.00. And then there
was the $150 worth of towing...

My advice is: replace the pump now.

Best of luck...

     Thank you all for your dolly ideas.
     
     What I ended up doing was placing a hydraulic jack under the transmission 
     mount point under a "thin" 2x4 which ran the length of the support bracket.
     
     I placed another hydraulic jack under the engine block by the drain plug.  
     I ran a 2x4 along the length of the block until it ran into sensitive 
     areas.  I had another "thin" 2x4 running perpendicular.  The center crossed 
     the 2x4, and the ends touched the exhaust pipes.  I cut this "thin" 2x4 in 
     the center slightly to weaken it so most of the weight was on the 2x4.
     
     Dropping the engine was no problem for one person, and the hydraulic jacks 
     performed well as dollies.  It was easy to pull the engine out from under 
     the car.  I am now dismantling the damaged areas on this contraption.  It 
     is rather stable, as I was really yanking on some stuck bolts with no 
     problem.
     
     Hopefully installation will be just as easy....

Does anyone know if there is a similar update for 84-86 Carrera? Will it make 
the clutch effort lighter? I have been procrastinating for the last year and a 
half on my 84 carrera clutch. But, it is now starting to grind downshifting to 
second gear while double clutching. It has always had a rough clutch take up 
action due to the rubber center plate. And the clutch effort is extremely high. 
If I can only reduce the clutch effort on this car, I would keep it for life. 
Else, does anyone want to buy an 84 Carrera Cabriolet with low miles?

No stupid questions, only stupid opinions...

Here in the northeast US, 4 wheel drive will allow you to flog your beloved
Porsche all year long, in snow up to about 6" deep.  Higher than that and
you risk highcentering.

Is it worth $6K more than the 2 wheel drive version?  Well, the previous
arrangement in the Carrera 4 made some pretty lousy drivers pretty good at
some track events.  We had one guy who refused to even come close to the
edges of Lime Rock Park, and he still managed to turn in some pretty good
times in a C4.

Perhaps a more pertinent question is whether or not the viscous setup will
be as responsive and durable as a full differential setup.  Methinks  that
a cheaper power transmission setup is the real reason that
the price delta (from C2 to C4) is less for the 993 C2 to 993 C4.

Anyhow, you pays your money and you takes your chance.

Fellow Porschephiles,

What's up with everybody wanting *quieter* exhausts? Haven't any of you

from the rear of a kick-ass race car? It's heaven to hear an engine
breathing free!!! I want my cars to sound like that. An exhaust note which
says "this car's got balls!" and wakes the neighbors at 3AM!!!

I'm currently running the Quiet Bursch exhaust on my '74 and the sound is
wonderful but it AIN'T LOUD ENOUGH!!! So I've ordered the glasspack Bursch
and I'll put that on this weekend. I'm even going to put the Bursch racing
megaphones on there after I put a set of Bursch headers on it early next
year and see how loud that is. Probably get me a ticket for noise-ordinance
violation!!! ;-> Has anybody run the megaphones? How do they sound?

My Turbo still has the stock exhaust and it's pitifully quiet. I'm definitely
going to straight-pipe the wastegate and put a B&B exhaust system on it
next year. A friend has a 400+ HP 930 that rumbles and spits at low RPMs
and sounds like it doesn't even want to run. Then on boost it'll blow you

I am told that there is a decided difference in handling characteristics 
between the 964/C-4 and the 993/C-4, in that it was practically impossible
to induce oversteer (hang the tail out) in the earlier version, while the
993 version allows this.  Pete Albrecht might have a word or two to add on
this, since he was among the select group that got to test the (rare) V-6
version for AutoWeek.

> Is it worth the $6000

This is the classic YMMV.  What's $6000 among friends?  How do you like 
driving your *normal* 911 when things get wet and slippery?  (No Pete, I'm
not in MY Porsche under *those* conditions either...)  For that matter,
do you *ever* plan to expose your expensive toy to such conditions?

> What other aspects of handling are affected? 

Well, it is 150 lbs heavier than the normal 993.  I suspect that the
extra grip will offset the extra avoirdupois, with the net result being
merely a *different* feel.  You might like it, or you might not, Quien Sabe?

Check it out, my friend; then these mysteries will be revealed to you...

I've seen one of these, and, in its favor, it goes like a bat out the Fire.
I never drove it so I can't comment on its handling, but I don't expect it
handled well--too much rear weight bias.  Were I going to try swapping a V8
into the 914 (I'm not, BTW) I'd think about an lighter alloy engine.  Hmm...
I wonder if a 928 power plant would fit.  That'd keep things in the family.

The major problem, however, with any engine swap that brings appreciable
power gains is that the rest of the car must be beefed up to handle that
extra power. Bigger brakes, more rubber on the road, beefier chassis,
stronger transaxle, new electrical systems (something has to drive the
transplanted injection system), etc.  These are the things that tend to push
these kinds projects into the hyperexpensive realms.  Additionally, one has
to keep the end product in mind.  Will if provide the charms of original 914
only with more power or will it be an uncontrollable beast?  ('Course my
wife claims my stock 914 is an uncontrollable beast).

Now, a question from the dreamer in me that wants shoehorn a late-model 911
power plant into the middle of my 914.  What really are the mechanical
issues to create a tractable automobile?  Anybody BTDT and survived to crow
about it?  I'd just like to how deep into the pipe I've been dreaming.

I have seen them dribble for 6mos. (My '87 944S did that) and I have
also seen them puke all at once.  I think there is potential for 
belt and/or roller damage if excessive coolant gets in the area by the 
belts.  I think I'd change it before any trips or demanding driving.

It's an expensive proposition, but it is wise to check all the radiator 
hoses and the timing/balance belt rollers at this time.  Also you should 
check the balance shaft oil seals (right behind the balance shaft 
sprockets) and the front crankshaft seal.
(sigh) and also it might be time to do the power steering hose(s).
The one that goes in front of the water pump has been updated to
a version which goes behind the fat radiator hose.  This will
clean up that area from oily crud and ease access to the water pump.

Check out Jim Pasha's article in Excellence Magazine about belts and
water pumps.  I think it was August 94.

    I had a good weekend.  I wish I'd been there both days, but
I was kinda busy Saturday...
    The course was surprisingly fast.  I was warned that Laguna
Paddock autocrosses were almost always a big triangle--this one
was, but it was well-disguised.  Two tight hairpins, two nice
straights, and a lot of twisties for one of the corners.  I was
able to hold 3rd gear through about 1/4 - 1/3 of the course,
which is unusual for me.
    Several people (including some *fast* people!) complimented
me on my time--46.1 or so.  My former Nemesis, Bert Del Villano,
who has since moved up to "Improved" class with A008RS tires,
only beat me by about a second.  The tires are supposedly good
for about 2-3 seconds on this length of course, so I'm very very
happy with that!
    My "bucking" problem turned out to be a $6 vaccuum hose (to
the vaccuum advance on the distributor) instead of the $50+ tranny
mounts that I replaced.  Oops--but they needed to be done anyway.
    My new tires are working out wonderfully.  I got the same type
of tire--A509--but in 195/50-15, instead of the /60s I was using.
What a difference!  I don't know if the other tires are just too
old or what, but the car seemed to hold a lot better, and I was
getting a *lot* more feedback from the car.  For the first time
ever, I was able to detect the back end losing grip before it was
completely gone, and correct it without losing *major* amounts of
time.  I am *VERY* happy with the new tires!  Low profile, stiff
sidewall is definitely the way to go--the heck with the harsher
street ride--"Toys are to be played with!"
    The next event is on the 15th, up at the Sonoma County Airport.
Come out and play!  Test the limits of yourself and your car, im-
prove your driving and car-awareness, raise your heart rate, give
yourself a big shot of adrenaline, and GO FAST!  Safely.

I have visited every auto-related shop in 5 cities without finding a decent
model of a 944.  None of the catalogs I get show one, either.  Anyone know of
a source for a nice metal or plastic display model, perhaps 8-9 inches long?
And for less than a thousand bucks?

Yes, I've been living with the problem for so long, I sort of take it for 
granted.  That's why I thought I'd give the list a try . . . just in case 
someone had a miracle solution. 
 
In any event, I think I'll publish the feedback I receive once the results are 
tabulated. 
 
As for Rain-X, I think it's great - at least the stuff for the outside of the 
windshield.  I use it on the windsheild of my 356 and in all but the heaviest 
downpour I can get by without the wipers.!  I once drove the ~50 miles from 
Sacramento to Palo Alto in a pretty steady light rain without using the 
wipers, although I wouldn't recommend trying that at night. 
 
One caveat about Rain-X: It seems to be sensitive to window cleaners that are 
heavy on ammonia which causes the windsheld to develop a thin haze when it 
dries.  However, the haze is easily removed with a soft, dry cloth to no 
apparent ill effect as far as the Rain-X functionality is concerned.

Micheal-I'm sorry, but I think it's a problem you'll have to live with. My
Porsche does it, my friend's Rolls-Royce Corniche does it. Hell, for fun we
put my neighbor's Ferrari 275 GTB in the rain, and it did it too. Just out
of curiosity, what do you think of Rain-X. I also hear they have something
to cut down on foggy windows. Thanks, and good luck!

Subject: Re: 951 Wheel Bearings

Ross,

Sounds like you are describing the control arm ball joint, and not
the wheel bearings.  On the 85.5 and later cars, they are not
separately replaceable.  I have been told that the ball joints are
peened into the aluminum arm, a one-time operation it would seem.

There is an outfit in Texas, if memory serves, advertising an
alternative repair or replacement.  Their ads run in Panorama.  I
don't know what it is they do.  If you (or anyone) does decide to
give them a try, be cautious.  Having a control arm ball joint fail
could be a pretty dangerous thing.

Buying a good used arm is tempting.  Make sure you trust the fellow
you buy it from.  944's get recycled because they get totalled,
generally.  When they get totalled, it's 'cause they hit something
real good.  And when they hit something, it's usually with the
front end of the car -- can you say understeer?!  The *only*
recycler I trust for a part like this, personally, is 944 Ecology,
owned and operated by Porschephiles' very own George B.

The way you check a ball joint (either control arm or tie rod) is
by lifting the lower half (the cup) and looking for play between
the cup and the ball (upper part).  The easiest way to do this is
with a large pair of pipe wrench pliers ("channel locks"), placing
one jaw under the bottom and the other, typically, over the pinch
clamp which captures the ball rod coming out the top of the joint.

Puhn suggests in his book that manufacturers will give you a wear
limit spec., but I have yet to see one from Porsche.  If you see
more than a millimeter, swallow hard.  Remember that there is sort
of a "servo" action to play: as things start to get loose, they
then can pound harder and accelerate wear.

Y'all should check your ball joints as periodic maintenance items.
In addition to checking for play, look for slashed or leaking rubber
boots.  Pretty common, and you can replace them with boots available
from VW/Audi.  But only if you catch them early enough.  The ball
joints get overlooked by a lot of PCA track event tech inspectors,
probably because they have to get under the car!

WRT the power steering rack, the bleed procedure is to turn the
steering wheel from lock to lock a number of times, topping off the
reservoir as needed.  If you are stil symptomatic after trying this,
it may be that something is wrong with the pump or rack.  Make sure
the pump belt is tensioned properly.

Subject: 944 S2 vs Turbo S

I am curious how many of the Turbo S upgrades appear on the S2.
I know the S2 has the big brakes and I believe it has the same
suspension upgrades.  Did the S2 come standard with
LSD, the trany cooler, and hardened gears?  The note below
says that the S2 did not have the forged wheels.

I am evaluating what my next car should be.  I want a step up from
my '84 944.  The car will be used for everything: daily driver, auto-x,
and driver's ed at the track.  Seems like the S2 would have an
advantage in auto-x and in stop and go traffic because of the
lack of turbo lag.  The turbo, of course, would be faster at the
track.  Anyone driven both and care to comment?  You turbo
owners, do you notice the turbo lag when autocrossing or in
traffic?

Thanks,

    Eric

<some stuff deleted>

| Transmission:
| 	The limited slip differential with external transmission oil
| 	cooler is standard on the S.  It's an option on the other
| 	Turbos.  Also, first and second gears are given an additional
| 	heat treatment to withstand the additional torque developed by
| 	the engine.
|
| Suspension:
| 	Koni adustable shocks on all four corners.  The front struts
| 	are double adjustble, for stiffness and ride height.  The front
| 	springs are stiffer, about 165 lbs/in over 130 lbs/in for the
| 	stock suspension.  The front sway bars are 26.5 mm and rear are
| 	18 mm.  Off hand I can't remember the dimensions for the standard
| 	car but they are somewhat less.  The rear torsion bars on the
| 	Turbo S are also larger diameter.  In addition, all the rubber
|        	suspension bushings on the Turbo S are made of a stiffer compound.
|
| Brakes:
| 	Front brakes on the Turbo S are the same as the 928 S4.  They
|         are substantially larger than a standard Turbo.
|
| *(Wheels, offsets, etc.)*
|    An 88 Turbo S or '89 will have the 7 and 9 x 16 in. forged
| seven spoke "Club Sport" wheels.  The 944 S2 and early C2/C4 seven spoke
| wheels are the cast version, sometimes called "Design 90" wheels.  Forging
| is a better manufacturing process than casting.  Forged wheels are
| stronger than cast.  They are less likely to crack.  Any wheel off a 944
| from 1987 on will fit any other 944 in that year range.  The wheel offsets
| were changed in 1987 to accommondate the ABS option, whether the car had the
| option or not.  The C2/C4, RS Amer, 968, C2 Turbos, etc.., all have the
| ABS offset hubs (Fuchs will not fit on a C2).  Therefore, the new 17 in.
| 5 spoke wheels will fit on any '87 or newer 944.  For a 944 Turbo, I'd
| recommend the 7.5 and 9 x 17 set that the 968 w/ M030 came with.

Do you hear the motor run?  On my car, the hood unlocks, but the hood
will not open by itself. A vibration like closing the drivers door
will make it pop open. I've heard it's designed this way.

  Hi everyone.
  Whew!  Driving back from Iowa last week (9/21) I drove thru one
of the worst late-nite storms on the kansas turnpike i've ever been thru!
  Even beat the time I had to park and wait for 3 tornadoes to pass !!
  !!! Yow !!!  50mph cross-winds, driving rain, flashbulb fusillade
  lightning, and triple decker semi trucks.  Anus clentching fun!!

  The next day, the Saga of '76 was missing both side rocker
panels.. must've ripped off at nigh 80mph just as I eclipsed a damn
semi.  Made a hell of a noise that woke me up good too!  It was too
rainy and dark to go look for them, besides I think Saga ate them or they
are in orbit above the Flint Hills.

  So now my dilema is the company I bought these from:
Ecurie (sp?) Engineering..I cannot find a current listing in Pano for them.
  They make a *really* nice set of generic fiberglass rockers for
35 or $40 each side.  I want another set.  Make that TWO!
  Anyone got a handle on these guys?  Are they still around?

  Muchly appreciated.

Jim, I have an '87 944S with the self tensioner. Does it hurt to
set the tension more often than what is recommended?  I've already
done the 2000 mile retention.  Would it hurt to set it every 5000
miles?  I mean, it's so easy to do.

My belt is a Pirelli. Had the latest part number. I got both belts
and all the rollers from Zims for < $200.  Is this belt the $180
belt Kevin was referring to? I hope so.

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative 
issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting
all of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with
slow mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want
to convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          President, NetSmiths, Ltd.
          2025 Lincoln Highway
          Edison, NJ 08817

     He lives in Houston TX and works in Edison NJ (Don't bitch about 
*YOUR* commute):

          '64 356 SC (OK, so he fell in love again).

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

    Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available via FTP at tta.com in /pub/porschephiles/
Archives in five subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94) each of which has 
the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: This FAQ; also specific FAQs about specific Porsche models
are being added (so far there's only one, for the 914--feel free to
contribute one on YOUR favorite Porsche).
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state of residence, their car's year and model, and their net
address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the information,
and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out on a monthly
basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't send your Alfa
Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send submissions or changes 
to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

Which clubs are there for Porsche owners?

     Several different clubs are available, depending on your interests
and location:

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     Porsche Cars North America, for a fee of $20, will research the 
original bill of sale for your car and give you a Certificate of 
Authenticity stating the facts and figures for the car as it was 
delivered to the dealer.  If you're interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What models of streetable Porsches have been made over the years?

     356  - The original Porsche sports car, built from 1948 until 
            1965; various engine and drivetrain components and various 
            styling variations existed.
     550  - Really more of a racer in the fifties, but driven on the
            street as well; this is the car James Dean died in.
     911  - Porsche's flagship.  Built from 1964 (excluding the '63
            901 prototype) in numerous variations through the coming
            993.  Rear-engined, air-cooled, boxer six-cylinder engine.
            Through its long life, many many variations, from the
            original 2.0 litre car to the new 3.8 litre RS.
     912  - The 911 with the four-cylinder engine from the 356 inserted
            in place of the flat six-cylinder.  Built from 1967 through
            1970.
     912E - The 911 with a four-cylinder engine from the 914, 1976.
     914  - The mid-engined car co-developed with Volkswagen between 
            1970 and 1976; a popular autocross/slalom car.  The 914/6 
            was a variant with a two litre 911 engine inserted in place 
            of the four-cylinder engine.
     924  - The first of the water-cooled front-engine cars, built from
            1976 to 1988.  Originally with a four-cylinder, Audi-derived
            engine, updated in mid-86 as the 924S with the 944 drivetrain.
            Has the best aerodynamic shape of any Porsche.
     928  - The high end car produced from 1978 to present, V8 in the
            front, water-cooled, has grown from an original 4.5 litres 
            to 5.4 today.
     930  - Turbocharged 911, homologation and street version of the
            racing 934.
     931  - Turbocharged 924, sold in 1980-1982.
     944  - Front-engined, water-cooled inline four cylinder car, with
            nearly perfect 50/50 weight bias.  Sixteen-valve and
            turbocharged versions were produced.  Produced from 1982
            through 1991. 2.5 litre displacement, except for a 2.7 litre
            eight-valve 944 model in 1989 and the 3.0 litre 944S2.
     951  - The turbo version of the 944.  Built from 1985 to 1991.
     959  - Supercar 911 derivative.  2.85 litre, four valve, twin cam,
            dual turbochargers, all-wheel drive.
     964  - Another name for the 911 Carrera 4 and Carrera 2 as introduced
            in 1989.
     968  - Rebirth of the 944 series in 1992.  Most noteworthy feature
            is variable valve timing.
     993  - The latest iteration of the 911, introduced in 4/94.

=======================================================================

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What references exist for detailed Porsche technical information?

There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for you
depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the technical
articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of their
Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's executive
office.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  
If you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note:
Information about water-cooled cars is lacking; those with favorites
should submit them to one of the names at the end of this FAQ.)

There are also Haynes manuals available for most models.  While the
Haynes manuals tend to be very weak on specifics having to do with
different model years and variations, they are good at teaching how-to
procedures for different maintenance and repair tasks.

=======================================================================

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications.
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Bruce was invited to join and did so back in '91. The load then
was too much for him.  All of what, 2k a day or so.  Now, at 15x to 20x
that load, he probably doesn't want back on.  He's not stupid -- he 
knows where we are.

     No specifics are available regarding other renowned Porsche people.
If they want to be known, they will announce their presence.  (Besides,
your definition of "renowned" may differ from mine.)

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute can do
so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are always
welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

Subject: 944 p-brake question

	I am buisily looking at 944's, and I've noticed on several of the 
cars i've looked at (all '83's -- my price range is pretty low) that the 
parking brake doesn't work at all.  The brake handle just doesn't lock into
place (it comes up -- it just don't stay there).  Is this a common problem?
what likely needs to be fixed/replaced?
Thanks,

1. A hood (any 851/2 or later part will fit)
2. Front fenders (these must be from an S2 or a turbo)
3. Front Air Dam (this must be from an S2 or turbo)
Color is not important although I am sure he would prefer white if given a

Hi, George.
 
I had nothing to do with the V6 thing. But interesting that it reappeared
(g). It's like the OJ thing. One TV station generates BS, and the others all
gobble it up with a fork and spoon because it must be true, after all it
was reported by da Media.
 
I run the numbers, provide the results to their staff, along with my

write the story or provide the tech specs.
 
The price on the coupe is lots lower than they quoted, $59,900. The cab is

Whoops!  Correction of something I wrote earlier, which should be
a relief to Darren and others.  The price of 944S/S2/968 timing belts
has come *way* down in the last six months.  It was indeed like $183
list back in the spring, but is about half that or less now.

My apologies and thanks to Jim Pasha for digging out the right price.
Jim tells me that Automotion has the latest, .02, Pirelli part, which
they apparently sell for about $35.

Of course, I have one of the $183 belts in my car!

Hi, Bill.
 
I have a 1990 Porsche parts list, the big thick paperback book, it's not in
there. Are you sure it's still listed?
 
For Porsche stuff, the place that has them if nobody else does is Stoddard's.
If it is no longer available new, then you have to try the wrecking yards.
Aase in Anaheim, EASY up in the Bay Area, Best Deal, Southern California
Import Dismantlers. My Stoddard catalog doesn't show it either.
 
It may be possible to replace just the tapered roller bearings. Is the
finger itself worn or damaged? A good bearing supply shop may be able to
help.

porschephiles@tta.com

1976 911-S  2.7L  with K-jetronic FI
My car is very very hard to start - 15-20 seconds of cranking - 
several times.  Finally it catches but seems like it runs on 3
cylinders for a short while.  Thermoswitch kicks in and it smooths out
but runs rough until warm.  When warm/hot it runs great, no miss, good
acceleration, runs real smooth .

So far I have installed a new fuel pump, new fuel filter, several cans
of Techron.
Do dare replace the warm-up regulator, fuel accumulator, or cold start
valve.  Could it be loose/leaking injectors?

Is this job for the pros only. 
Experts, please advise,

Bruce -

Most people will tell you that it is to save on weight (i.e. nitrogen is 
lighter than air).......NOT.  It is that Nitrogen will not expand as your 
tires heat up.  Thus, after you set your tire pressures you can forget 
about having to adjust them.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will let us 
both know.

Hi, Trevor.
 
At the track, you'll see racers using a Dunlop gauge to set camber. They're
not terribly expensive but the home shop still won't get enough use out of
one to justify it.
 
You can set your own toe-in fairly accurately if you have a flat garage
floor. With the wheels pointed straight ahead, CAREFULLY push a tack into
the tire tread at the back of the tire (at the level of the axle). Drop a
plumb bob over the pin, and carefully mark the location of its pointer on
the garage floor. I use some tape, put a dot on it. Now roll the car forward
1/2 tire rotation, so the pin is now at the front of the tire, again at axle
height, and do the same. With a steel tape measure, carefully measure the
distance between the front and rear marks. Subtract, and that's your toe-in
expressed as a distance. If you need it expressed in degrees, just do some
trigonometry using the tire diameter (not the distance you've rolled it).
Angle = arctan (distance difference/tire diameter).
 
There are other settings, of course, and as far as I know you need fancier
equipment to do them.

Michael Hodos writes:

"Has anyone figured out how to reliably stop the windshield wiper shudder that
seems to develop a few days into the rainy season? "

I use Bosch wipers, and had the same problem last winter.  Near the end of the
season I asked my foreign parts guy what he thought was going on.  He said that
the wipers leave a little trace of themselves on the windshield, and then stick
on that deposit as they're traversing it.  He said alcohol would remove it.

Well, I looked, and sure enough there was barely visible set of vertical streaks
of faint grey in the area where the skipping ocurred, which came off with
rubbing alcohol.  As I recall, no streaks after that.

I never heard of a preventive measure, though.

On a similar subject, Al Schlegel of the local (San Diego) PCA recommends
cleaning the wiper blades with a small amount of lacquer thinner, and then
treating with a small amount of Armorall, as a way of making the blades last
longer.  I tried this on both the 928 and our Taurus, and it did bring both sets
of streaky blades back to life.  Perhaps this will also cut down on the on-glass
deposits.

I'll second that. About two years ago I was in germany when my cluth gave
it's last breath rather suddenly costing a defective 2nd gear also. 

But since I was nearby and the shop I usually use (in Denmark) knows
Freisinger I went to him. He could fix it all in one day, he said, 
and he did. Only thing is, that I got a bill of DM4500 (=$3k) for  
a new cluth and fixing the gearbox. He had not only fixed the 2nd gear
but almost renovated the entire gearbox completely!!!

That would have been fine, except that the gearbox was only 2 months
old, COMING FROM FREISINGER HIMSELF!!!

The bill was shipped to Denmark (my usual shop) who told him this and
he reduced the price to around $2k, which was still a bit high. 

Bottom line: DON'T USE FREISINGER...

Sounds familar.  A few years back, a friend and I were going to change
my tie rods on my 914 - an upgrade to the turbo units.  After dropping
the inspection plate/cover under the front suspension, we found
ourselves face to face with a _large_ black widow spider - inches
away. 

I did the plastic tent (plus a car cover) and a couple of bug bombs to
get rid of any others that my have been under the car (the first one
was adopted as the garage mascott).  

After the encounter, with my 914 being black, the nickname "the Black
Widow" was adopted for my car - which now sports a spiderweb and a red
hour-glass.

Still, driving home that night after finding the first spider was an
interesting experience.

Subject: Mini Porsche Parade in Yosemite :-)


Evidently I'm not the only one who considers the Yosemite area to
be Porsche driving heaven. I was heading from the valley to Glacier
Point yesterday afternoon when somewhere near El Capitan, I spotted
what looked like a black 993 in the other lane a ways ahead of me.

As I got a little closer, I saw what appeared to be another 993 ahead
of the that one. And another, and another, and....Well, to make a
long story short, there were six New 911(tm)s in a row, all sporting
manufacturer's license plates from Nevada. Presumably some PCNA folks
trying out the new toys for the weekend.

A couple of them waved as I went by. The others didn't; either they
were too intent on their driving (only 35 mph and not exactly a
challenging road), or they didn't deign to acknowledge a 944. :-)   
I briefly considered pulling in ahead of the front one--there being 
few opportunities for a 944 driver to have six 911s trailing behind her
- --but I was trying to get to Sentinel Dome by a certain time and also
had to be ready to make a left turn soon, so I just kept going.

For the record, there was one silver, one black, one bright yellow,
two of a plum color (similar to a beautiful Ferrari 308 I saw once),
and I think the sixth one may also have been black. No Guards' Reds,
which seems odd for a group of six Porsches. :-) 

A few hours later, I went past a 356 that was going up the Chinquapin
Road, and I also saw a couple of other 911s. Dunno where the other
944 folks were; there must have been some secret 944 convention
somewhere else I didn't know about. :-)

I had a great time driving in on Highway 120, going to and from 
Sentinel Dome via the Chinquapin and Glacier Point Roads, and leaving
the park on Highway 140 (the Merced River Canyon). I can't actually
prove that God made the Sierra Nevada for the benefit of sports-car
drivers, but I think I could make a good case that Caltrans made the
roads for us. :-)

Subject: re: 914 aux air regulator

I've known my AAR was bad for a long time, since I had to live with a
really low (almost stalling) idle during warmup and high idle afterwards,
but never really was into fixing it until the recent thread.

So I thought I'd share my opinions about my fix.  I tried soaking and
banging the AAR to free the valve (and 12 volts), but I'm an impatient
type and didn't want to wait the possible two weeks as some other
porschephile wrote, so I took more drastic measures.  I pried the bottom
part away from the valve/hoses part, since the metal, although thick
gauge, was just 'wrapped' around the flat area of the valve.  This showed
the simple internals.  The bottom is not in any way linked to the top,
inside the metal can is a plastic housing and a sort of filament.  As
most of you know, this heats up when the 12 volts is applied to the wire
and the case is the ground.

The bimetal 'spring' is placed as close to the filament as possible, but
is only connected to the other half, ie the valve.  The spring can be
pulled off the valve shaft after a small adjustment screw is removed.
Then you can just turn the shaft by hand while using your preferred lube
on the shaft and the valve.  Reassemble with the adjustment in the same
position.

This all assumes you can live with re-sealing the unit with high temp
silicone or something, and have some pry marks on it.

Depending on where the valve decided to freeze at, applying 12 volts might
be the opposite of what you would want to do to free it.  Looking at
the valve through the hose fitting, it is important to know that it rotates
(counter clockwise while heating, when looking down on it as mounted in
the engine compartment), and that there is about a 6mm long slot in it.
If you can't see the slot at all, it is frozen in warmed-up mode.  If you
can see a lot of the slot, it is frozen in cold mode, and 12V might help
loosen it while soaking.

Subject: 951 Wheel Shimmy Revisited Again!

I am running out of solutions concerning a front end shimmy problem that I
have had for quite some time now. I will give you a brief history on the car
and explain what work has been performed. The car is an 86' 944 Turbo.
I purchased the car 10/93, with 85K almost a year ago.(near perfect Condition)
It came equipped with 928 Type/ "Phone Dial" wheels. The option sticker 
revealed a forged wheel option 7" & 8" Fuch's. I then found out that the 
"Phone Dial" wheels were the wrong offset (they were 87' wheels for the 
changed front end geometry). Someone pulled a fast one!! The shimmy did not 
seem to show up until I changed the front brake pads. I did not replace the 
wheels in the exact position on the hub. Live and learn. I had  both wheels 
balanced, the shimmy changed slightly. I then had a P-Mechanic take a look at 
the front end. He said that the upper strut bearings were bad and needed to be
replaced. I did this @ 90 K and also replaced the front shocks with Koni Sport
shocks.(yellow) No change! A very reputable P-Mechanic test drove the car and 
said that my Pirelli p-700's steel belts had probably shifted. He said that 
this was common with the Pirelli's. I replaced all 4 tires (was time any way) 
with BF Goodrich Comp T/A ZR-4's. I also sold my 87' Phone Dials and replaced 
them with the proper Fuch's (brand new from Robert Wood).  At this time a four
wheel alignment was performed. He also checked my work (strut replacement). 
After spending hudreds of dollars the front end felt great. I was a happy 
camper. No pull. Steering wheel now perfectly centered. No shimmy! Well, not 
very often or very servere anyway. Since then I have put 5000 more miles on 
the car. It gradually got worse as time went by. The shimmy in the steering 
wheel is now a constant problem. It doesn't favor a certain speed, it happens 
for several miles then stops completely for a brief time. At speeds (50+) the 
steering wheel actually shakes my arm. I tried having the wheels balanced on 
the car. The drivers side front did not balance correctly, The mechanic said: 
"that my tire was probably bad!" Doesn't anyone know what they are doing??  
Help!!! Now the shimmy is even worse! At times I can feel vibration in my legs
and feet!

As far as I know , the rotors are original. New pads @ 86 K

I checked the wheels & tires for truness. They look perfect.

On warm days when the brakes are heated up, I get a rubbing sound when I
apply the brakes. The vibrating/rubbing sound will disappear when I
apply hard pressure to the pedal. Rotors Warped? 

I have tried the technique where you apply the brakes when the problem occurs,
while keeping a constant speed. No change with the shimmy. No shimmy during 
braking.

I also have some movement in the front wheels at the top of the strut, when I 
move the wheel top to bottom. I have been told that this is normal? Side to 
side is nice and solid.
Possible wheel bearings? Had those checked 7K ago, they were adjusted, and
said to be fine by the "mechanic" who said I needed upper strut bearings!

I am at a loss. Maybe suspension components? Everything looks OK?

PLEASE HELP!!! This problem is driving me crazyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!

If there are any sugestions anyone can give I would greatly appreciate your 
help.

I suspect your chain is being yanked a bit. Serious racers use nitrogen in
their tires as it does not expand as much as air when heated. therefore tire

it is not needed.

There are two adjustments.  One is a jam nut on the linkage at the hand

lever.  The other is a "star" adjuster inside each of the rear rotor hats. 
 It may be that
all one of these cars need is a little adjustment.  Or the shoes may be 
smoked,
and they are depressingly expensive last time I checked (which was a bunch
of years ago).  It is quick and easy to pop the rear rotors off and probably

Has anyone heard about a recall or update for the S2?  I think it may have
to do with the front suspension or brakes?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: 944 water pump

Greetings,

Given the overwhelming responce from the list, I 
have decide to replace my water pump immediately.

Question: Has anyone used the EuroSelect water pump?
Its cost is about half of the factory pump.  I have 
heard some bad things about some of the EuroSelect 
parts and was wondering if its worth the savings to
try the cheaper part.

Thanks for the info.

Okay pfilers, here's one for you.  I need a part for my Zenith carb on my 64C 
cpe.  It's a metal plug that fits into a recessed hole in the side that I 
guess was then peened with a punch to keep it in.  It fell out, a common 
experience I guess.  When I find one I'll epoxy it for a little extra 
security.  Does anyone know of a carb rebuilder in the SF Bay area who may 
have one?  Tried the Maestro and Dieters in Palo Alto with no luck.  Thanks in

Well, I finally got the fan from Part Werks a few days after I decided to

(at least there's a stamp inside that has an 85 on it), and has some extra
cooling slots around the edge of the hub, but otherwise looks like the one I
installed on my car. $140 takes it, otherwise I'm sending it back, so respond

Time out -- think about what it is you're proposing to do.  You have a stud
and nut which may be junk, right?  So as you turn the nut, the stud backs 
out,
making replacement easy.  Now, let's say you had put a litte red Loctite on
it last time -- what would happen?  Uh, you'd rip the nut off and have a 
junk
stud staring you in the face, locked to the cam housing.

Studs back out, head gaskets blow out, and rocker arms break, and we're

Yes! It at least used to exist, that is trailer hitches for Porsches.
And not just 911s -- I've actually seen 356 trailer hitches and the
Tweeks "Garage Sale" flyer pereptually has a 914 trailer hitch...

Congratulations!  There's really no need to replace your blaupunkt system if
you want to keep the car original.  You can easily add a CD changer under the
hood with a remote in the cockpit.  I have an inexpensive Panasonic 6-disk
changer with a wired remote.  It plays thru the Blaupunkt radio, tuned to 
87.9 (not sure of the exact freq, check the manual that comes with the 
changer).  Works great.

Subject: Review of new Carrera 4 (993)

I've just read the articles in the two UK magazines concerning the new 
Carrera 4, Performance Car and CAR.  It seems that Porsche AG has made 
many improvements to the AWD system on the new C4 compared to the last 
generation C4.  It seems that the distribution of power is now better 
handled and that the extra weight of the AWD system no longer affect the 
accerleration numbers compared to the C2.  If I was in the market for the 
new 993 (and I wish to God I was..), I'd probably shell out the extra 
money for the AWD system.  This way, I'd get to go to track days in dry 
or wet conditions and have lots of fun in either.  As for now, I'd have 
to be content as a university student and look for a '90 or so C2 or C4 
and hope I find a real peach.

Mike,

I've seen a few of these - specifically where people pulled a small
trailer to carry track tires and tools to events.  

However, a better solution is a 928.  According to ROW specs, the 928
will tow it's own weight.  Something I seriously considered when
buying my second Porsche.  It could have been 928 tow vehicle and 914
track car.  8-)

Steve - 

I second what Jerry said about not waiting any longer
to get your leak fixed (No comments, Barton!). My water 
pump did what you described and I got it fixed. Then, not 
24 hours later the radiator sprang a leak (read geyser!). 
My mechanic said you never know what's wrong until you start 
fixing things. So I guess one moral is to pressure test the 
system after the pump is replaced. It *may* show up 
other faults before you get out on the hiway - and maybe
it won't. YMMV.

Good Luck!

Sorry, I don't do water. But I *DO* have tons of experience in using
Carrillos in VWs, 914s, 911s, 930s, and misc. big-block Ford stock car
motors.

In a word (ok, two words): finest kind. They are absolute necessities
for high-rev racing motors, and they last and last and last and last...
On your average air cooled motor, take a counterweighted crank, PolyDyne
the bearings, and use Carrillos, and the bottom end is just about 
bulletproof. Of course, it also helps to have lightened tool steel 
wristpins and lightweight forged pistons too.

Not sure about "worth it" for a street car, though. Kevin? Nathan?

Subject: Why gauges sometimes register high readings

This may explain why gauges (temp, fuel etc)  sometimes show higher or
lower than expected. 

As cars get older the electrical connections weaken (corrosion, dust, 
dirt etc increase the electrical resistance at the connectors), and as a
result the gauges show a little higher than they did when the car was 
newer. It has happened on my 87 Jetta and it had happened on my  1978 924.
Both cars indicated slightly hotter coolant than when newer, both cars 
were checked at Autobahn Inc, at different years.  Both times the coolant
temps were within  limits although the gauges were showing higher than
whan the cars were newer. In the case of the 924, the gauge was
approaching red,  but the coolant temp was still acceptable. 

The 924 fuel gauge indicated empty when the tank was 1/3 full...

Anyone with additional comments/experience on these?...

Nitrogen will expand with increasing temperature! The presumption is that it
will not expand as fast as air. A quick glance at the Virial coefficients for
"standard" air and N2 indicates that this is probably an effect of order 1%.
However, this would vary greatly with the moisture content in the air.

Subject: Where should I look for a '72 or '73 911S?

Well, after all the posts of "do I want this car or that", I've decided to
search for a '72 or '73 911S Targa.  I may end up settling for an earlier
S or an SC but, for now, I'm focusing on the 2.4 liter cars.

The question looms, however, where do I find one?  I'm currently checking-out
Hemmings (the prices are always a little high there) and the Auto Trader (for
non-Los Angelinos, that's a local used car rag).  I'm in the process of 
joining the POC and the early S registry (they have magazines that have ads)
and I can't join PCA until I have a VIN (though PANO would be a good place
to look).

Anyone know of another place to look (or, even better, one for sale)?


Wade
wade@nb.rockwell.com

P.S., I was wondering something about the longevity of the pre-'78 3.0
liter Carerras.  I know that the 2.7 liter engine has a short life span and
that the 911 SC 3.0 liter has a tremendously long lifespan.  Are the 3 liter
Carreras built from a bored/stroked 2.7, an early version of the SC, or
some other engine?  What's the life span on those engines?

It's probably not important -- I probably can't afford one but I *am* 
curious.

	Me thinks this is an old (racer's) wives tale... In the pressure/temperature
range in question both N2 and Air (which is 78% N2) behave as nearly ideal gasses.
That means that :

(Pressure) * (Volume) = (number of moles of gas) * (gas constant R) * (absolute temperature)

Now, if you were really desperate to save a little weight you could fill your tires with
Helium or Hydrogen. Of course, both of these would leak out pretty fast and the H2 is also
pretty flammable.

Dear Porsche Friends:

	My 85.1 944 badge is badly faded... I would like to replace it with a
new one.

How do I go about about replacing it? On my 911 I was able to get to the nuts
that hold it from inside the trunk lid.

I can't seem to be able to get to the badge's back on the 944. I even removed 
the front bumper (had a headlight washer leak...) but could not get to it.

Are they just pressed on? Held in place by glue or what?!!

Subject: Dimensions of a 944

Hi everyone,
I just joined this list, and I have been paging through all the archives 
from over the years.  I'm thinking of buying an '83-'85 944, and most of 
the comments about tall drivers have been pretty positive- no problem for 
drivers that are about 6'2". Other comments?

The other thing I'm a little worried about is- how wide is this car?  I 
live in San Francisco, so street parking is not really an option.  My 
garage is narrow, and I want to make sure a 944 would fit.  How about a 
924S?  Is it significantly narrower than the 944?

I'm really enjoying the list!
Thanks in advance for any information.

Mike,

I'll admit right up front that I don't know for sure, but you can
check these things yourself.

First, wheel bearings.  Any chance that these are out of adjustment?
Did you take the hubs off when you changed the pads?

Second, what condition are the ball joints in?  (See earlier post on
ball joints and the alloy a-arms.)

And then, a strange one, what kind of shape are the a-arm bushings in?
These are the bushings on the inboard part of the a-arms where they 
piviot on the body.  I've never actually seen this on a 944, but with
some VW's that have similar setups to the early 944's, I've seen a
similar problem.

Hope some of that helps.

Not true.  I just bought inner and outer aftermarket bearings locally.  These

I like to build model kits of cars I own so that they look exactly like 
my actual car. For my 944, I was able to locate a 1/24 scale kit from 
Revell (made in W.Germany). The number on the box is 7289 which might be 
the catalog number. The title on the box is 'Porsche 944S'. It is dated 
1988. Fortunately, the actual kit had 'Phone-dial' wheels just like mine, 
unlike those pictured on the cover. Also, it included a 951-style rear 
apron which the previous owner of my regular 944 had installed. By 
slightly modifying the Euro-bumpers of the model, it was identical to the 
real thing. Hint: use lacquer automotive touchup spray-paint, followed by 
several coats of lacquer clear-coat for the body.

Hope this helps.

I looked at this myself when I bought the 911.  Porsche makes a hitch for the

Mike, it sounds you've done a lot of analysis and spent time & money here.

You did not specifically mention replacing wheel bearings, or checking 
the A-arm ball joints.  These are wear items and could cause wheel shimmy.

You mentioned that braking stops the shimmy.  This is a good clue.  
This indicates a shaking rotor and stable caliper.  The rotor is 
affected by the wheel bearing's condition and adjustment; the caliper 
is not.  Also, both the rotor and caliper are affected by the ball 
joint and shock tower bushing (i.e., the mounting points for the whole 
strut assembly).

I would investigate the wheel bearings at this point.  They're 
reasonably cheap ($40-$60 per side, if I recall) and easy to replace.  
Give it a try.

I definately do. I'm using a 3.5" single-exhaust on my 3.2 (soon-to-be 3.6)

certain track events have limits on the noise level, so I have to have

Subject: Re: 911 fuel injection trouble

one way to test your fuel accumulator would be to
 undo the cold start valve fuel line at the valve.
there should be a short spray if it is holding
 pressure (note: engine is off). then put the line
in a beaker and have someone turn the engine over
 for a second. if there's instant fuel spray it's
not likely the pump but to make sure a pressure
 test should read 72 psi acc. to my clymer manual.
the problem with your engine turning over too long
 then running poorly sounds like fuel starvation
to me.if the fuel pump is working right then it 
 could be too much fuel.to check the cold start
valve for leaking,take it out with the fuel line
 still connected and unplug the electrical connection
and put the valve in a cup or something to gather
 any fuel that leaks.if you can bypass the pump
to make it work good otherwise have someone turn
 the engine over .if the valve leaks it's bad.
it's possible to check the injectors in a similar
 manner except that the fuel pump must be turned
on without turning over the engine.they shouldn't
 leak unless they are bad.it's unlikely that a
non functioning warm-up reg. would cause these
 symptoms.
 to clean the injection system and combustion

Hello Everybody!

I've been looking and calling around to different parts houses locally and 
nationwide to price various things I know I'll be needing soon.  One of 
the biggest stumbling blocks to getting an accurate part number and price 
is convincing the person on the phone that there were TWO 951 models in 
1988; 951 and 951S.  Most company's computers seem to jump from the '88 
951 to the '89 951 with no mention of the '88 951 S.  My question is this: 
Can I just tell these people that I have an '89 951 (or '89 944 Turbo) and 
be reasonably assured I'll get the right part?

I've been following the threads describing the uniqueness of the '88 951S 
and '89 951.  I think it's the best 944 investment.  Given the limited 
production runs, it may even be collectable some day in the distant 
future; but, speccing parts for it is turning out to be a pain.

What do you all think?  Is it safe to tell 'em '89 951?

Eric,

Actually, the turbo lag is not really noticeable. It feels more like the
car just doesn't have alot of power at the low end (compared to the top
end). As for autocrossing, the tall gearing is likely to cause more
difficulties than the turbo. In particular, a good launch in first gear
requires ~3K+ RPM before engaging the clutch (slowly). With a LSD this will
keep the car from bogging down and produce just the right amount of
wheelspin. You can just imagine how good this is for the life of one of
these (normally short-lived) clutches :-). My experience is with a stock
'86 951 (w/limited slip, w/o chip) but a stock Turbo S should be similar.
If you put a chip in a 951 then the "launch" becomes much easier (better
"tip-in" throttle response, I'm told). As for the S2, I don't have any
direct experience, but would guess that the advantage in autocrossing, if
there is one, would be small.

Hope this helps.

rear shocks and springs were all off the car.  The roof and rear
window were in good shape, but the chassis showed flex with the
roof off.

In short, I think I'm gonna pass on this one.  It'll cost far more
to fix up than it'll be worth when it's done.

Thanks to all who related their experiences with early 911/912
models.  You made my evaluation of the car much more comfortable.

Subject: Re: Carrera 4

The 89-94 C4's use a true center differential with wheelspeed sensors 
and electronic clutches to distribute power to the wheels. It is true 
all-wheel drive. Normally I think the split is 67% to the rear and 33% 
to the front. If a wheel begins to slip, its power is reduced and sent 
to the other three wheels. This system --- a remarkably sophisticated 
one -- make it possible to drive the C4 in all kinds of poor 
conditions, and very hard to spin. However it is noticably heavier than 
the C2, and tends to understeer quite a bit when driven hard. So the 
real driving enthusiasts tended to favor the C2 of the same era. It was 
also $10k more money for the C4, and for lots of people, hard to 
justify when the only external difference was a "4" on the decklid.

The new 993 C4 has a much simpler system for power distribution. 
Normally, all the power is sent to the rear wheels. A viscous coupling 
to the front wheels send power to the fronts only when the rear wheels 
begin to slip (slippage and shear forces make the viscous gel become a 
solid). Porsche also uses ABD (Advanced Braking Differential?) which 
uses the ABS sensors detect wheel slippage and applies the brakes to 
the wheel that is slipping, at speeds less than about 40 miles an hour. 
The advantages of the new viscous system are that it is lighter and 
gives the driving feel of a two-wheel drive car until the limits of 
rear traction have been exceeded. So the enthusiasts should like it 
better. It is also cheaper and simpler, which is itself not a bad thing 
either -- in computers we might call it more elegant! While it is not 
as sophisticated a drive system as the old C4s AWD, between it and the 
ABD, the new C4 should be drivable in all kinds of rotten weather. In 
many ways the new C4 is the best of both worlds - more fun to drive in 
the dry, without giving up much in the rain or snow to the old C4. And 
it's cheaper.

FWIW, most "4x4's" on the market don't use systems as nearly as 
sophisticated as even the 993's.

(I am writing this from memory - someone please chime in if I have 
gotten some technical bits wrong.)

Calling all Floridians...

I recently looked at a used 93 RS America originally from Florida and
wondered if anyone might know the history on this car. It was white w/o a
sunroof, had a PCA decal on the window, a Miami dealers license plate
holder, and non standard 16" OEM starfish wheels. All this added up made me
think that someone in southern Florida, who was a PCA member, could have
been running the car in some local driving events (using the standard 17"
wheels and using the 16" wheels for the street). The dealer here in Houston
seems to always have a bunch of Florida cars, supposedly from a high end
auction house down there somewhere.

Anyway, I thought this car might ring a bell with someone who could give a
yea or nay on the condition and or treatment of the car. Other than the
wheels it looks pretty good and has < 10,000 miles. This seems like pretty
low mileage if it is street miles but 10,000 miles at Moroso would be a lot
of wear and tear. I was told I could pick it up for somewhere in the $38 -
40 K range, which is still a lot of money to me but after driving one this
weekend at a local track event at TWS my mouth is watering.

Anyone want to buy a nice 74 Carrera or a 89 951 ??

Thanks

   First, make sure your fuel pump is really good. If its whining or making
  much noise when hot, its probably bad.
   Vapor lock on the CIS system is prevented by the "accumulator," it is
  basically a piston on a spring. When you turn off the pump, the spring puts
  pressure on the fuel lines to prevent vapor lock. Generally when they go bad
  they leak, unless yours is leaking its probably ok.
    From the supply side, the only reason you keep pressure is because of
  a check valve in the fuel pump. Without it working right, pressure bleeds
  straight off as fuel is pushed back to the tank. A common symptom of a
  bad check valve is that the car will start only after cranking for a couple
  minutes (this problem on a friend's car made me a believer in Interstate
  batteries !). The fuel pump on your car I believe is up under the steering
  rack, this is a cheap and easy part to replace.
    I know it seems funny that you can activate your fuel pump and not rid
  the vapor lock, I can't explain why that happens but it does.
     Don't custom wire your ignition ! Though I've been the first to do
  things like this, it really is the worst thing to do in that you'll probably
  end up with a worse connection, plus soon you can end up with a pile of
  spaghetti and be left wondering where wires really go....

       Hope this works for you--Lee

Funny you should ask this.... I'm in the middle of that right now
myself, waiting on the second box of stuff from Zims to arrive.
While I'm replacing everything else (front bearings and seals, all
four rotors, pads, rebuilding calipers, replacing master
cylinder, rubber brake lines and emergency brake shoes) I'm only
replacing the seals on the rear bearings. 

Why? In part because they're not kidding about needing 400 foot lbs
of torque. Even the lowly VW Beetle used 375 foot pounds to hold
it's rear drums on. You need  a special tool that you bolt across
two of the lugs bolts that then braces the hub against rotation 
by pressure on the floor. And about a 4 foot long breaker bar. There's
even a special VW part number for it and you can still get it fromA
Baum (the folks that actually make almost all of the VW / Porsche
special tools).

So, until the bearings start complaining, I'm going to take  a pass
on that exercise. Then I'll probably let Elmer do it, since he's
got the tools and the experience. And I figure you need to do that
what, every 30 years?

Oh -- on price: obligatory plug for United German Imports in
Pittstown NJ. They have a full package for $495 that has in theory
everything you need to do the job in a one-stop shopping manner.
It's a little less expensive to buy from Zims, but you have to 
remember what all you need... 

Finally, when you get ready to do brakes on your 356, make *SURE*
you have wheel bearing seals on hand. Odds are, you're gonna need
them. That's why I'm driving the Beetle this week instead of the
356...

Len,

According to the workshop manual, this is done on a 944 by prying it
up with a thin putty knife.

The manual also warns you to be careful not to damage the paint. 
Whenever they say something obvious like that, it typically means that
there's a real good chance you're going to screw it up!

Sigh.... We used to store the IMSA slicks in airtight bags filled with
nitrogen, and filled the tires with nitrogen, because it is widely 
believed that in an all-nitrogen, low-to-no oxygen environment, the
tires *LAST LONGER* i.e. they don't get harder over time.

Now, we never tested this theory any longer than we had to, mind you,

According to the basic laws of chemistry and physics, *ALL* gases
expand equally (and linearly within wide limits) with temperature
changes. (Scientists in the group will recall the formula PV=NRT).
I looked up nitrogen and found no mention of any unusual behavior
re. temperature & pressure.

Per Stan's note, yes, the Carillos are well respected, reliable, and

I don't know about 944 Turbo applications.  Not sure whether the

shop has done a couple of those.

BTW, I will not even utter the name of that *other* company selling

Hi netters, 
 
          I had bugged you all some time back regarding the purchase of a 
924 first and then a 944. Well, tell you what, I DID IT!  
 
          I bought a '84.5 944 last friday (sept 30). The car is in very  
good shape and has done 87k miles. I had come to this country about three 
months back and has made an old dream of owning a Porsche come true. I  
used to drive an old Ambassador in India with a 2 litre 41 BHP diesel 
engine (transplanted) and you cannot imagine the difference.  
 
          I am already in love with my 944 and am still getting used to  
it. I have some doubts which I will ask in a later post.

Hi, Lou...

Yep, you guessed it...held in place by (the magic of) friction.

The pins in back of the crest fit into a couple of black plastic grommets. I
use a gasket scraper to get a bit under the badge and then gently pry it up

OTOH, the symptom was that the handle would not stay in the up position. 
Most likely, the ratchet release is rusted in place or the spring is broken
or something is screwed up on the handle which might be diagnosed by
inspection of the parts inside the cabin.  Easier to look at and diagnose
with the driver seat out.  Besides, it's a chance to find all those quarters
and dimes that have fallen out of the previous owners' pockets.

Only 1,500 pounds, eh?  That's about $3000 CDN or $2235 US.  This is what I 
paid for my pickup truck which has a towing capacity of about 7000 pounds 
PLUS I get an 8-foot bed which I could fill with tires, tools, and a small

There's got to be about half a million competant shops out there which could 
weld you a custom hitch which would bolt in place for easy 
installation/removal for the light loads you require.  I'm betting they could 
do this for about 1/10 the cost of the installed Porsche part.

Stan,

     Thanks for the tips.  In my case, I want to do the rear
wheel bearings because a) it *HAS* been 30 years, and b)
something isn't right back there.  There is a rumble from the
rear which sounds/feels like a bad bearing.  I would guess a

Diff/carrier bearings.  Well, I figure I'll try the easier first.
Besides, the rotors are undersized, and the rear brakes
occasionally howl, even when not braking (maybe a frozen caliper
piston?)  I know what you're talking about when trying to decide
where to stop in a repair.  You can "while-it's-apart" yourself

Matthew,

	Sounds most likely to be a broken handbrake cable.

	The handbrake on my 944 (85/2) was never very good. Even though I
adjusted it a number of times, it kept needing more and more
"clicks" to hold the car on a slope. Eventually it snapped - the
week before I sold the car :-(

	Replacement is not especially trivial.

	I also suspect that many people don't adjust the cable at the
handbrake end properly - the service manual says that you have to
remove the driver's seat to do it, though some small spanners and
*lots* of patoence will also work. It *is* much easier with the seat
out (my seat was out for recovering, so I though I'd clean or adjust
anything which I couldn't normally get at). There is also a star
adjuster inside each rear wheel.

	Good luck with your search.

Oops, I suffered a brain fart and wrote the number down wrong.  It's
really 533 *not* 583.

So now here's a better question.  The car in question ('87 911 Targa)
has option "220 - Locking differential".  Is this another way of saying
limited slip differential?  And how is it different from options
"219 - Differential" and "221 - Porsche-locking differential"?

Text item: 911 jerky acceleration problem when cold


  Greetings fellow p-philes -

  I have an '84 911 that gets a bit moody when cold.  She starts up
  immediately, though runs a bit rough at low RPMs (around 700) for a few
  seconds until something (?) kicks in and boosts the RPMs by 100 or 2.  So
  far, no problems - except that I haven't moved yet.  As soon as I start
  driving, I get jerky acceleration in 1st and sometimes 2nd gear, usually
  in the low-RPM band.  Given the outside temperature, this problem goes
  away anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes of driving.  Colder the
  weather, the longer the problem is around.  Runs like a champ when
  warmed-up.

  And the net wisdom of the p-philes says ???

Hunter,

Next time you are in a big bookstore (Barnes & Noble type), or a hobbyshop,
pick up one of the model car magazines. You will find mail order places that
have "new old stock" of discontinued models. I suspect that there may be no
current production of 944 kits since the real cars haven't been in production
for a couple of years.

I have a 1:24 scale euro '86 944 Turbo model built from a Hasegawa kit, which
a dealer was able to order for me, but this was a few years ago (like 1991 or
92).

And, sadly, I also suspect that there aren't too many teenagers falling
asleep dreaming of owning one of our delightfully solid, balanced
automobiles. Their loss...and not much incentive for the kit manufacturers.

Rudy, obviously you have not joined the Porsche Club, or you would not be
asking such a question.

As an example, (bear with me please) - my waterpump on my 83 944 sprung a
leak in 1987.  I took it to the dealer, who quoted me a price of $1600 to
replace the waterpump, belts, and labor.  With the help of several unselfish
PCA members in my region, we did the job ourselves in 6 hours, total cost
$200.  Now, I will grant that we used a rebuilt pump instead of a new one
(PCNA at that time was not offering rebuilts), but certainly I saved $1400
in one incident alone.  That itself will pay my PCA dues for as many years
as I will be alive...

I'm sure that as a Michigan State student, $36 can buy you a lot of pizza
and beer (to cry in, after a football loss), but it can be the best $36 you
can spend on your Porsche.

Rob,

   Well, they did spend time leaning the mixture which brought
the numbers down but not within the required specs. But honestly 
speaking he spend about an hour of his time working on the car
in my presence. 

Actually my post was to find out what adjustment did he made after
removing the front right wheel. A faulty O2 ( Lambda ) sensor will 
rich the mixture but since he didn't say anything about the sensor
being faulty, I am assuming there must be something else or some
other adjustments down there to lean the mixture. 

The EPA Test in Illinois requires you to Rev. the engine to around
2300-2500 rpm.

True.  Nitrogen is used primarily because it is first dried to remove the

Only recently became a Porsche owner and E-mail user but hope someone can

automobile after driving it, turning it off and allowing the engine heat 
to build up after short periods of time, approx. 20+ minutes or so.  I've 
been told the reason is fuel vaporization from engine heat prior to ignition.
One mechanic redid the ignition sequence so that the electronic fuel 
pumps can be activated prior to ignition, thus allowing liquid gasoline 
into the lines replacing the vapor but this has not solved the problem.  
Any suggestions?  The car is a 1977 Turbo Carrera and when it runs, I 
love it, just doesn't always start when I want it to.

This sound just like the fuel pump check valve.  It is located on the

which is caused by back pressure from a hot engine.  Have the check calve

My swing-axle beetle rear axle nut required an estimated 600 ft-lb to

cheater pipe, which wouldn't budge the bugger. Finally got it off with
a Ubangi - an ingenious device made of half-inch plate steel, with a
hex hole in it of the right size to fit the nut (36 mm?) and on the other

breaker bar in the drive hole, the hex hole over the nut, stand on the
cheater pipe, and hit the flat part with a sledge hammer. Still took
three whacks... the Ubangi is availble from Johnny's Speed & Chrome,

I always found that the shudder is due to a different effect than deposits off
of the wiper blade on the glass.

The wiper blade is made to pivot as it sweeps the glass.  An ASCII cross 
sction looks like this:

wiper direction --->                       <---

        /                (wiper blade)          \
_________________        glass surface      ________________

When the wiper is parked, it is always on the same side, and the blade changes 
shape through time.  I find that the shudder occurs when the wiper doesn't 
flex in the proper direction, due to fatigue of the rubber, or shape
deformation.  Replacing the blades is the only solution I know of, other than
leaving the wiper arms sticking straight up so you don't deform the blades.

The latter looks pretty silly going down the road <g>.

Subject: 951 DME relay

Last week the DME relay in my '86 951 was acting up, and I was wondering
if anyone else has experienced the same symtoms, and can offer suggestions
as to cause.  

While driving to work the engine would suddenly cut out for a fraction
of a second and then kick in again.  Whenever this happened I could 
hear a relay drop.  This happened about 5 miles after I started driving
the car when it was cold.  The relay would drop out about once every 
minute whether I was cruising, or stopped for a light.  Well, I limped
it home and later on picked up a new DME relay from the dealer.

The next day I swapped relays, and drove to work.  Again the same 
thing started happening, only worse, now the relay fluttered, and
that makes for one hell of a rough idle !  I limped this home to and
removed the relay and inserted a jumper across the three pinouts which
would correspond to the contacts the closed relay would make.  With a
lot of effort I got it running, only to stall and turn over but 
not start at all.
At this point I had it towed to the dealer.  When I called them the
next day, they said that they popped the new relay in, boosted the battery
and it ran fine.  They drove it, idled it and no bad relay action.

To me this is black magic, as I basically did what they did.  Soo...
the question is what the heck happened.  Any ideas out there ?

know of:
Fujimi 1/24 356A/B/C speedster, Carrera, Roadster, Cab, Coupe, Karmann
Coupes available, also various 911's . The Fujimi EM series has fantastic
detail, done to scale. In the case of the 356's it includes a crankshaft
c/w rods, and counterweights (only if the engine had counterweights)! I
kid you NOT! Expensive and well worth the money if you have the time and
some modelling skills to devote to it.
Tamiya 1/12 934, 935- Big, superdetailed, working suspension, in short,
unbelievable! Expensive, I paid about US$40 for my 934 in Japan, I suspect
it would be double that at least here.
Tamiya 1/20 935,928 Good kits, reasonably priced.
Revell 1/24 904 - poor kit, the lines are OK, the engine is a joke. I
built mine with a 2.0L Carrera from a Fujimi kit that I wired with
ignition (that task alone took 2-3 hours), a trans from a Fujimi 911, and
wheels from a Fujimi 356C. Needs extensive reworking, but the results can
be good.
Gunze Sangyo (I think) 904,906- you can tell what they are supposed to be,

There are others, this is all I could think of at the moment.

before removing the plugs. (a shop-vac would have been a better
choice in retrospect)

In relaying the story to our biosafety guy at work (also auto-
motively certifiable) he said that I should have been wearing 
a dust mask or better yet, a cartridge type full-face mask to 
protect myself against Hantavirus in the mouse droppings. 

My first reaction was that it was silly, BUT ... there are 
increasing cases of this nasty virus, and it *can* be deadly.
So, take care of your nice killer felines, give them free range
of your garage over the winter, and if you do end up with little
critters in your car over the winter - be careful with the clean
up.

Subject: Shop Troubles Update

Ok,

	Well, my SO wrote a letter to the shop that hosed her BMW, stating
(in effect) 

	A) I'm pissed
	B) My car is hosed beyond belief
	C) You mechanic stinks and I wouldn't trust him to change a lightbulb.
	D) I've asked VISA to withold payment until futher notice (which they did)

	The shop owner called her back, and she and he set up a meeting with
me, my SO, the mechanic, and himself to try to work this
thing out.

	I'm wondering if we should take it to an independent shop first, in
order to have something to back up our claim that they've hosed the
car, or should we wait 'til after the meeting.  The meeting is 
next Tuesday, so it is kinda short notice.  Plus, I wonder if she should
drive the car to a shop or not.  She hasn't driven it since she
got it out of the shop last time.


Any feedback would be appreciated.

Subject: Purchase of repossessed 87 911


 Ok heres the deal. I work with a guy whos future wife works for
a credit company. They (credit company) have have a 87 911 Coupe 
that was repossessed. The price is around $18k, it has 60k miles 
and is said to be in great shape. I have not seen the car myself, 
but I am making arrangements to test drive it today yet or tomorrow. 

 Now for the questions, has anyone purchased a repo'd car before?
Is there anything extra I should look out for? I plan on taking
it to a Porsche mechanic (if I'm interested in it) for a overall
checkout.  even if this car is not exactly what I want (color,
mileage, etc) 18K for a 87 911 is almost to much to pass up. I 
haven't seen a 87 coupe in the paper or on the net for anything 
less than $23k. So what do you think?

Seems that this should make gauges read lower, not higher. I assume that
gauges are typically in series with a sensor, and that the sensor is a
variable resistor, that changes with whatever is being sensed. The lower
the resistance, the higher the gauge reading. So additional resistance
in the circuit should make the reading lower.

One possibility for making the reading higher would be excessive voltage
to the instrument. Maybe the regulator doesn't do as good a job as it
did when it was new? I have noticed that turning on my headlights makes
my temperature gauge read a little higher, and assumed that the
regulator was overcompensating for the increased current drain. Maybe
that's a bad assumption (wouldn't be the first time...). Anybody got
a more persuasive explanation?

I've heard this claim before and my immediate thought was BS.  However,
I've learned to pay attention to the empirical evidence: if these are the 
measured numbers, saying they're impossible is, well, stupid.

The only reason I can come up with to explain the effect (if it exists - I 
haven't made any measurements...) is the water content of the air.  

Bottled N2 (or any other gas) should be pretty dry.

Compressed air is often quite damp due to condensation in the compressor
and the effect may be more due to the water than the gas.  Be aware that 
I'm speaking off the top of my head here and have not sat down and checked
the tables for wet air vs. temperature.

Agreed; definitely "NOT".  Air is ~80% Nitrogen, so there's not going to
be much difference between them.  Most of the balance of air is Oxygen,
which is very close to N2 in molecular weight, too.  Maybe someone's
thinking of Helium?  That shouldn't make a difference anyway, IMO.


> ...It is that Nitrogen will not expand as your tires heat up.  

With heat, the gas will become more energetic and TRY to expand, but
since the volume is fixed by the tire, the pressure will go up instead.
The Ideal Gas Law suffices for modelling the changes:  PV/T = constant.

To better model real world physics' molecular interactions, you should
use the Van der Waals equation of state, but I don't think you need that
level of precision here.  Forgetting to use Absolute temperatures (Kelvin
or Rankine scales) is the most common error made when applying the Ideal
Gas Law...heating from 20C to 40C is NOT a +100% increase, but only +7%.


>...Thus, after you set your tire pressures you can forget about having

FWIW, I don't think Helium will work either, although I will *speculate*
that it might be _possible_ to have a constant pressure while temperature
increases but only as a short term effect.  My speculation is because He
is a very small molecule, it is a hard gas to keep bottled.  Its possible
that the He could leak out at a rate roughly equal to the increase in
temperature so that your tire pressure could remain constant.  But as
time passes, the pressure will go DOWN as He continues to escape (and it
will go down a LOT when the tire cools).  Helium is notorious for being
able to escape confinement; it even passes through even Steel and Aluminum
pressure vessels.

empty-vs-full tire to see how much (little) weight we're talking about here?

OK.  Here goes.

My car had twinn cherry bombs welded to flanges which bolt dirtectly to

If you have any doubts, ask anyone who has seen (or heard it) at the

Interestingly enough, a pair of the local Porsche Gurus gave me a rash
of (word deleted) about tham, saying you couldn't put a $20 exhaust on
a $20K car and expect it to work.  TO prove their point they bolted on
their "hot setup", a pair of 5" supertrapps with 15 diffusers each.
The supertrapps added 0.2 seconds to the 3000-7000 RMPPM runtime on the
local jetting hill!\


They've been real quiet ever since.

Good choice! But be prepared to search far and long for one at a decent price.
It took me about two years to find my '73 911S Targa for around $8000.00.  
I searched through all of the common auto rags and finally found my car in

How much are you willing to spend?  This is important when looking for any

Hi George: First, I should have put some :-)s in my msg. because I meant it 
to come out lighter than it may have. I'll also add that I generally find 
your contributions valuable and actually look for them along with other 944 
stuff in my daily p-philes digest. 

Now... Less obvious than you thought: I've been a member since soon after I 
bought my 944 this spring, though I haven't had occasion (fortunately) to 
take advantage of benefits such as the one you describe.(I have no idea what 
my # is, but I'm in the Motorstadt region, and "you could look it up", I 
presume.)  As for your original msg., 

>>1) Join the Porsche Club of America.  The $36 per year gives you access to

$36 IS a great deal and I plan to be a member for a long time and hope to 
make the kind of FRIENDS you've made through membership, because what you've 
described sounds like an act of friendship more than a function of 
membership. I guess I meant to poke fun/doubt though, George, [;-)] whether 
driver education, for instance, comes with the $36. Actually, I am a prof, 
not a student, and, if you were my student [:-), :-)], I would edit the

I meant to be funny and not picky.. 

(BTW, while Pano IS great, I was disapppointed that they've dropped photos

George, If you're ever in the area, get in touch and I'd enjoy taking 
another $36 and treating you to some beer and pizza. And, remember, I don't 
cry after a football loss, I drive my Porsche.

Here's the PCA newsletter press release for the Zone 1 Tech Tactics for 
1995.  Several porschephiles attended last year and had a great time...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Mark your calendars now for the weekend of March 18-19, 
1995!... because you won't want to miss out on all the fun and 
events we have planned for this "very special" 15th annual Tech 
Tactics weekend.

Tech Tactics is a two-day event, offering:

 -  Several interesting speakers who present programs on 
technical, and just a few not-so-technical, subjects, all 
intended to help you and your Porsche enjoy your relationship.

 -  A vendor display area, just outside the doors of the 
sessions, enticing you to purchase many items useful to you and 
your Porsche.

 -  Door prizes, awarded at various times during the weekend.

 -  Lots of socializing, especially in the hospitality suite on 
Friday and Saturday evenings.
 -  NEW THIS YEAR!
   Our keynote speaker will be a representative from the 
Porsche factory - a first for this event. The factory will also 
present several very interesting and challenging contests to 
pique your interest and bring out your competitiveness - with 
prizes for the winners!

It's a great time to get out from under the winter doldrums, 
visit with your PCA friends - and make new ones - meet the 
speakers, and learn a lot about your favorite marque.

A new registration format will be offered this year, whereby 
you can design your own weekend package.  This has come about 
as many people can only attend for one day, or for part of the 
weekend.  We hope to make this easier for you, and encourage 
increases attendance through this flexibility.

Complete details will be sent to each editor within the next 
few weeks, so watch your newsletters for complete registration 
information.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please do not hesitate to contact Bob and Joan 
Moir at (908) 879-6171.

We look forward to hearing from you and meeting you at the 15th 
annual Zone 1 Tech Tactics, March 18-19, 1995 at the Sheraton 
Hotel at Monarch Place in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Per Stan's note, yes, the Carillos are well respected, reliable, and
all the other good stuff.  They are also available with non-standard
dimensions, for example with a smaller little-end bore for our race
car's smaller wrist pins.

I don't know about 944 Turbo applications.  Not sure whether the
Andial stroker kit includes different con rods, but I can ask.  The
shop has done a couple of those.

BTW, I will not even utter the name of that *other* company selling

924 first and then a 944. Well, tell you what, I DID IT!  
 
          I bought a '84.5 944 last friday (sept 30). The car is in very  
good shape and has done 87k miles. I had come to this country about three 
months back and has made an old dream of owning a Porsche come true. I  
used to drive an old Ambassador in India with a 2 litre 41 BHP diesel 
engine (transplanted) and you cannot imagine the difference.  
 
          I am already in love with my 944 and am still getting used to  
it. I have some doubts which I will ask in a later post. 
 
Cheers, 
Sreelal Ramachandran 
84.5 944 (burgundy metallic)

Hi, Lou...

Yep, you guessed it...held in place by (the magic of) friction.

The pins in back of the crest fit into a couple of black plastic grommets. I
use a gasket scraper to get a bit under the badge and then gently pry it up
(without damaging the paint!)

Subject: Re: 944 Handbrake

Yep, Kevin Gross is right (again!).

The handbrake brake shoes list for $50.25 each (p/n 928.352.097.10) and you
do need four of them to do the job.  Of course, I know a source for used
shoes (:-)) at great prices...

OTOH, the symptom was that the handle would not stay in the up position. 
Most likely, the ratchet release is rusted in place or the spring is broken
or something is screwed up on the handle which might be diagnosed by
inspection of the parts inside the cabin.  Easier to look at and diagnose
with the driver seat out.  Besides, it's a chance to find all those quarters
and dimes that have fallen out of the previous owners' pockets.

(Where do you think that I get all of my spending cash???)

Only 1,500 pounds, eh?  That's about $3000 CDN or $2235 US.  This is what I 
paid for my pickup truck which has a towing capacity of about 7000 pounds 
PLUS I get an 8-foot bed which I could fill with tires, tools, and a small 
swimming pool.

There's got to be about half a million competant shops out there which could 
weld you a custom hitch which would bolt in place for easy 
installation/removal for the light loads you require.  I'm betting they could 
do this for about 1/10 the cost of the installed Porsche part.

Stan,

     Thanks for the tips.  In my case, I want to do the rear
wheel bearings because a) it *HAS* been 30 years, and b)
something isn't right back there.  There is a rumble from the
rear which sounds/feels like a bad bearing.  I would guess a
wheel bearing, but someone else suggested the possibility of
Diff/carrier bearings.  Well, I figure I'll try the easier first.
Besides, the rotors are undersized, and the rear brakes
occasionally howl, even when not braking (maybe a frozen caliper
piston?)  I know what you're talking about when trying to decide
where to stop in a repair.  You can "while-it's-apart" yourself
into a full restoration.  Then it doesn't matter what condition
it was in when you bought it, because you just replaced
everything anyway.

Subject: RE: 944 p-brake question


Matthew,

	Sounds most likely to be a broken handbrake cable.

	The handbrake on my 944 (85/2) was never very good. Even though I
adjusted it a number of times, it kept needing more and more
"clicks" to hold the car on a slope. Eventually it snapped - the
week before I sold the car :-(

	Replacement is not especially trivial.

	I also suspect that many people don't adjust the cable at the
handbrake end properly - the service manual says that you have to
remove the driver's seat to do it, though some small spanners and
*lots* of patoence will also work. It *is* much easier with the seat
out (my seat was out for recovering, so I though I'd clean or adjust
anything which I couldn't normally get at). There is also a star
adjuster inside each rear wheel.

	Good luck with your search.

Philip

Oops, I suffered a brain fart and wrote the number down wrong.  It's
really 533 *not* 583.

So now here's a better question.  The car in question ('87 911 Targa)
has option "220 - Locking differential".  Is this another way of saying
limited slip differential?  And how is it different from options
"219 - Differential" and "221 - Porsche-locking differential"?

Text item: 911 jerky acceleration problem when cold


  Greetings fellow p-philes -

  I have an '84 911 that gets a bit moody when cold.  She starts up
  immediately, though runs a bit rough at low RPMs (around 700) for a few
  seconds until something (?) kicks in and boosts the RPMs by 100 or 2.  So
  far, no problems - except that I haven't moved yet.  As soon as I start
  driving, I get jerky acceleration in 1st and sometimes 2nd gear, usually
  in the low-RPM band.  Given the outside temperature, this problem goes
  away anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes of driving.  Colder the
  weather, the longer the problem is around.  Runs like a champ when
  warmed-up.

  And the net wisdom of the p-philes says ???

I HATE reading about these things, only to go find out I have the same problem

b) I never noticed until someone pointed it out.

I have the same problem with my wheel (at least I knew this was a problem).

Hunter,

Next time you are in a big bookstore (Barnes & Noble type), or a hobbyshop,
pick up one of the model car magazines. You will find mail order places that
have "new old stock" of discontinued models. I suspect that there may be no
current production of 944 kits since the real cars haven't been in production
for a couple of years.

I have a 1:24 scale euro '86 944 Turbo model built from a Hasegawa kit, which
a dealer was able to order for me, but this was a few years ago (like 1991 or
92).

And, sadly, I also suspect that there aren't too many teenagers falling
asleep dreaming of owning one of our delightfully solid, balanced
automobiles. Their loss...and not much incentive for the kit manufacturers.

Good luck!

    Well, it looks like I've hit my first case of Really Bad

mounted.  It ain't.  It appears that the mounting bracket has
pulled out of the metal it was bolted/welded/riveted/whatever

think that said metal is a part of the right-rear suspension,
which would make this a case of the Dreaded 914 Suspension

Rudy, obviously you have not joined the Porsche Club, or you would not be
asking such a question.

As an example, (bear with me please) - my waterpump on my 83 944 sprung a
leak in 1987.  I took it to the dealer, who quoted me a price of $1600 to
replace the waterpump, belts, and labor.  With the help of several unselfish
PCA members in my region, we did the job ourselves in 6 hours, total cost
$200.  Now, I will grant that we used a rebuilt pump instead of a new one
(PCNA at that time was not offering rebuilts), but certainly I saved $1400
in one incident alone.  That itself will pay my PCA dues for as many years
as I will be alive...

I'm sure that as a Michigan State student, $36 can buy you a lot of pizza
and beer (to cry in, after a football loss), but it can be the best $36 you
can spend on your Porsche.

Rob,

   Well, they did spend time leaning the mixture which brought
the numbers down but not within the required specs. But honestly 
speaking he spend about an hour of his time working on the car
in my presence. 

Actually my post was to find out what adjustment did he made after
removing the front right wheel. A faulty O2 ( Lambda ) sensor will 
rich the mixture but since he didn't say anything about the sensor
being faulty, I am assuming there must be something else or some
other adjustments down there to lean the mixture. 

The EPA Test in Illinois requires you to Rev. the engine to around
2300-2500 rpm.

Husain.

Although I haven't seen it on my Porsche, I have seen windshield wiper
shudder on my wife's 91 Plymouth Laser.  I saw an edition of Owings Motor
Week, the PBS TV show, that suggested the following course of action for
shudder. First, wipe your windshield down with Prep-Sol (while trying not
to get any on the rubber). I tried this, but it didn't really help.  Of
course, it suggested replacing the blades or the whole wiper.  Didn't help
the Laser.  Then it suggested tightening, or replacing the springs on the
underside of the wiper blade.  It makes sense, if the springs are worn, you
won't get enough tension against the windshield, and they'll shudder. 
Success.


On another subject:
My 1983 944 makes what I can describe as nothing else but a short,
flatulent sound after driving about 20-25 minutes.  It makes the sound once
and only once during each trip.  The sound seems to be coming from the
front driver's side - maybe the wheel area.  At first, I thought it was the
*&^$!!* useless power antennae motor kicking in every once and while,
giving its last gasps.  But now I'm not so sure as it seems to happen more
often when cornering.

I'm not too worried about it, but I wondered if other 944'ers out there
have run into this.  (When it happens, my wife and I just look at each
other and excuse ourselves.)

...I'm already imagining the responses I'll get to this one.

  I've never had a 930,(I've tried to buy 2) but I do know;
  1. The 3.0 liter appeared in '76, HP was about 235 (I still have the
     Panorama introducing this model !).
  2. The 3.3 liter came out in '78 with 254hp, but also the significant

     that the intercooler goes a long way in making the engine survive.
     Apparently you can find intercoolers for the earlier cars, but you'll
     have to change the rear decklid to the "tray" type to fit.
       Both the 3.0 and 3.3 use an aluminum case, but I'm guessing the
     3.0 didn't include a fender-mounted oil cooler. 
  3. I guess in '85 HP became 282, apparently still under CIS power.
     I don't know when/if DME was adpoted for the 3.3l turbo.
  4. Despite what Porsche Claims, the first production car with a Turbo
     WASN'T the 930, it was the 12-year-earlier Corvair. Agreed, 18-second
     quarter mile then probably left room for some improvement...
  5. The Porsche Turbo was imported every single year to the US, though
     HP is 20-35hp less because of exhaust changes. A lot of 930s in the
     US are Euro converts, though.
  6. How fast are each ? How fast can you drive ??  A Porsche mechanic
     assured me that most 930s have been slid over a curb sometime in their
     life, but if 13 second quarter miles aren't enough you can change
     the exhaust, get a bigger intercooler/bump the boost, replace the cams
     with SC cams, and mill the barrels to up the compression, or replace to
     a bigger turbo.

      Staying with a '78 or newer car probably makes sense, I'm sure a lot
     of people would argue that a 944 turbo is faster, safer and cheaper,
     but it sure lacks the visual impact of the 930.

Michael Hodos writes:

>Has anyone figured out how to reliably stop the windshield wiper shudder that

I don't know if my solution is the ultimate answer but I will tell you what 
has worked for me!

For one thing I keep my windshield clean--I clean it or at least wipe the dust 
off every time I fill the gas up.

The next and most important thing is that I try to "park" the wipers with the 
blades bending opposite of it's normal "off" position.  In other words, 
under normal conditions whenever you turn the wipers off, the wipers will come 
to rest at the end of it's last swipe with the blades slightly bent up towards 
the top.  But what I do is at the end of the day or when I finally put the car 
away for the night, I will pull the wipers out from the windshield and force 
(very slightly) to make the blades bend downward so that the blades will rest 
with the opposite bend.  My theory is that since the blades are always bending 
one way, it bends against the windshield during the swipe vs. bending with the 
wipe during operation.

Lastly whenever you have to use the wipers, always make sure that the 
windshield is wet.  You don't want to use the wipers against the dirt or dust 
that will scratch your windshield.  The dirt will also ruin the the blades.

Since I tend to keep my windshield relatively clean, I don't use nor need 
Rain-X.  I don't need to use the wipers during a heavy rainstorm on freeway 
driving.  Of course once I use the wipers on the freeway, then I have to use 
the wipers.  Usually if it starts to rain while I'm on the freeway, I don't 
need to use my wipers since the wind current tends to push the raindrops away 
and allow me to see w/o using the wipers.  I do this for both day or night.

Since I "discovered" this solution, my wipers have lasted about 5 or 6 years 
before needing replacement.  I think the opposite bends on the blades also 
protects it from the sun too.

I don't do this all the time since my wife also drive "my" cars.  I only do 
this when I'm driving the car that just came in from the rain or if I remember 
to do it to the car that my wife just brought back home.  Otherwise, I wait 
until I get gas and wipe the windshield clean before bending the blades down. 
 My wife couldn't be bothered with such minor details.

That's "my little secret" brew for the windshield wipers.  It seems to work 
for me and I still do this since I have nothing to lose except for a few 
seconds after bring the car home or I make sure to wipe the windshield clean 
every fill-up and car wash.

We all know that it is important to use this $360+ tool to tension a $20

specific, equally precise belt tension gauge and calibrate it against the
factory gauge? (In fact, I think the original tool comes with a special

Ross,

The 0.5" of play at the tire top is not good.  It could be a wheel
bearing, it could also be a strut going bad, or it could be the control
arm ball joint.

You already know how to check the ball joint.  To check the strut, first
take the wheel off.  Put one hand on the strut, the other on the top
of the rotor.  Wiggle the rotor in and out with hand #2.  Hand #1 will
tell you whether the strut is indeed internally loose and moving.

Loose struts are very common, and are often misdiagnosed as a bad
wheel bearing.  A certain amount of looseness is no big deal.  Past
a certain point, the camber change will affect handling.

Caveat: the following is not an expert opinion but simply my experience and 
opinion.

I have limited experience with the 944S having test-driven an '87 once; none 
with the 944S2.  I remember making the used-car slimeball very nervous with my
spirited acceleration and cornering.  The power in the 16-valve seemed to come
on strongly above approx. 4000rpm very smoothly.  However, below 4500, I found
it lacking.  I expect the S2 is similar in nature.

I am very familiar with the Turbo but I have not driven the Turbo S.  I expect
they drive similarly. In the Turbo, at lower speeds, boost kicks in between 
2500-3000 rpm and is much like an on-off switch but I've gotten used to 
flooring the pedal and waiting a sec or so for the turbo to spool up.  I don't
find my Turbo very competitive in autox compared to naturally aspirated 911s 
or 914s, esp. in tight, short tracks.  The main reason is due to the on-off 
nature of the turbo at the low speeds typical in autox.  I suspect that the 
944S2 will be quicker than the Turbo at autox, all other factors being equal. 
 However, on fast highway drives and on the track, I don't notice the turbo 
lag if the gears are selected properly.  Keeping the revs up by 
heel-and-toeing probably helps.   Another 'future' advantage to the turbos is
the cheap and simple chip upgrades for more power, and someday you **will** 
want more power.

I've seen several claims that the Turbos are "driven harder" and are therefore
subject to abuse and higher maintenance costs.  I question this theory since 
**any** car could have been driven very hard and abused.  

Trivia question: How many Turbo owners on this list have actually had to 
replace the turbo/intercooler or other components specific to the Turbo 
models?  The owners on this list are probably not representative of the 
general population out there since a lot of us track our cars but also 
maintain them better.

When I buy again, it will be a 914 for play and someday a Turbo S or 911.

Whew!  This has gotten more lengthy than I expected...

	Basically, if you pull the handle too high the clip that holds
the handle up moves past all the teeth.  No matter how hard you push the

The only option is to force the handle down, which pushes the clip around 
so it won't engage anymore.  Like I said, it doesn't make much sense now, 
but the fix is rather simple.  Don't let it stop you from buying a perfectly

Mike,

The only shimmy that I ever had was on a Volkswagen Rabbit that had a bad
tie rod end. The shimmy got worse the faster you went; at 65+ it was
unbearable. When braking this shimmy also went away. Did someone
specifically check out your tie rods or steering rack for play?

zero in on the wheel bearing(s)

Subject: Do I really want a '69 911S?

Though my 914/6 3.0 liter  project has been a blast, I'm now inspired to 
replace my trusty '76 911 with something more interesting. I've often 
thought a '69, '70, or '71 lightweight "S" would really be fun to own. I 
really don't care about the gas mileage, but how much trouble does the 
high compression bring about in terms of fuel? It's almost impossible to 
find 92 octane gas here in the Ozarks.
- -------------------------------------

Dave, 

Here is some info about the eary 911 S models, and some opinions.

The '69 S is about as fast in the 1/4 mile as the 2.4 T. Also the '69S
pistons are no longer available. The 2.2 ('70 & '71) is better, and with more
power. They were also available with some cool lightweight options like the
aluminum rear deck lid and license panel. I don't know what else made them so
light, but I remember a road test that showed about 2100 lbs weight (I don't
really believe it). The 2.2S may be hard to run on 92 octane gas, the 2.0 S
being even worse (CAM2 probably). 

The 2.4S has much lower compression (8.5 to 1) and will run fine on most
premium or PLUS grades of unleaded gas. The '72 and '73 did not offer the
lightweight options, but should weigh no more than 2300 pounds. (Of course
you can make them light if you want!) The 2.4 S engine is more tractable too.
Also rustproofing was better than the early models, with partial galvanizing
of chassis steel. The tranny is stronger too, and better than the weird
"pull" clutch of '71 or so. So you shouldn't overlook the 2.4 S. An E should
be nearly as good, but seems hard to find lately.

Good luck, hope you can find a nice early S !

N2 in tires?  Because it eliminates oxidation of the rubber (and other

(some do, anyway) because carcass failure is so annoying when it happens
halfway down the runway at liftoff speed with all the fuel tanks 
full...  I think N2 for car tires was even discussed in the popular
press a decade or so ago, at which time tire life increases by a factor
of several were claimed. 

For racers, who might lovingly deposit their tread around the track

Greg,

Sounds like the warm up regulator. These units act like a choke. They
enrich the fuel mixture (by altering the fuel system pressure) over the
first ~2 minutes of operation. Their primary failure mode is to get stuck
in one position and stop making any adjustment. I used a fuel injection
pressure tester to check for this	type of failure; bought one a number of
years ago from	a Saab dealer (there must be much better sources now) and
have found it indespensible.	They can also help you set the fuel system
pressure (via shims)	and help in diagnosing other problems, too.

The cold start valve only operates for a few seconds in very cold weather,
so it is not likely to be the cause. Also, an air leak major enough to
prevent starting the car will also keep it from idling when it is warm; so
this is also not likely.

Hope this helps.

I'm intrigued that you have had great experience with this firm, yet, expect

While it is true that you will pay if you have a chargeable accident (3 years,

Most customers prefer to pay lower rates while they are accident/ticket free,
while those having accidents pay more. 

The unfortunate fact is that statistically drivers with tickets/accidents have
accidents much more frequently than a separate group with no T or A.

Not true. While it may differ from state, you do have to be at fault to receive
a sircharge (51% in Ca.). Depending upon how long you have been a client, and
accident free, the sircharge may actually be waived (while you continue to
receive an accident free discount!). They are VERY interested in details. Agent
and client feedback is crucial with this firm.

A common misconception. With my car, the combination of aluminum heads, and

Wether or not it is an _uncontrollable beast_ is strictly a function of

Subject: Dismantling a (Holset) turbocharger

Hi Len,

I have an automotive-size turbocharger installed in the lab, and use it 
in experiments when I teach my piston engines and turbomachinery classes
at Washington University. It's a Holset (UK) turbo, designed for Cummins
diesel engines (USA), so your 930 turbo may be different. I have never
seen the insides of the 930 turbo, but all the many others I have seen are
similar to the description below. 

When the turbo is stationary it is normal to have A BIT of play in the 
shaft and A BIT of oil leaking from the shaft. Stress, A BIT. The shaft 
rotation provides the stability and the oil sealing. 

In order to take the Holset apart you need to take out the compressor
diffuser and the turbine diffuser (the scrolls), each in two parts (a
total of four sets of bolts around the perimeter).   What's left is the
middle of the body containing the oil supply and return holes, with the
two impellers (compressor and turbine) at either end. Between the backs of
the two impellers are the shields and the labyrinths on the shaft that 
keep the oil inside the middle of the body. The shaft is integral with the 
turbine impeller, which slides out the turbine side after you have removed
from it the compressor impeller and associated seals, labyrinth, packing
etc. In other cases the turbine is also held on the shaft by a mechanism.
Depending on the direction of shaft rotation, there may be reverse threads
on the nut(s) that hold(s) the impeller(s) on the shaft. It is critical
to get the right torque on this (these) nut(s).  

Now for the bad news. The turbine-impeller/shaft/compressor-impeller
assembly is balanced as a unit, and if you take it apart you must mark it
so that you maintain the azimuthal orientation between the  components,
otherwise it will likely rub and self-destruct when you put it back in
operation. By self-destruct I mean the impeller(s) will rub on  the
diffuser or back shield, rub some metal off, overheat, and burn.  In this
process you are also likely to bend the shaft. You will see the balancing
marks as part of the metal that has been shaved off the perimeter of the
impellers, the back of the impellers, and perhaps the two ends of the
shaft. This balancing is critical; the unit has small diameter, but in
normal operation it rotates at high rpm (the Holset goes up to 150,000
rpm). I would not know where to balance these units. In the past I had
sent mine once to Cummins for balancing (but this was a special case, 
donation to the University). I had also seen a larger compressor impeller
(about 30 inches in diameter), from a slow speed marine diesel engine,
balanced in 1981 at Hellenic Shipyards.

I hope I am not the bearer of bad news, and that this helps.

Mike,

This is hogwash!!

Air is 78.06% nitrogen gas by volume (75.5% by weight). But this is not
even important when you understand that all gases act according to a set
of laws. These laws are disussed below (reprinted without permission from
Grolier's Encyclopedia):

         In chemistry and physics, the behavior of gases under varying
         conditions of temperature, pressure, and volume may be
         described and predicted by a set of equations, or gas laws.
         These laws were determined by measurements of actual gases and
         are valid for all substances in the gaseous state.

         The first quantitative measurements on gases were published by
         Robert Boyle in 1660. He observed that if an enclosed amount of
         gas is compressed until it is half its original volume while
         the temperature is kept constant, the pressure will be doubled.
         Quantitatively, Boyle's law is PV = constant, where the value
         of the constant depends on the temperature and the amount of
         gas present.

         Jacques Charles later studied the relationship between the
         temperature of the gas and its volume while maintaining
         constant pressure. Charles observed a steady increase in the
         volume as the temperature increased. Specifically he found that
         for every degree Celsius rise in temperature, the gas volume
         increased by 1/273 of its volume at 0 deg C.

         Charles's observations led to the concept of the absolute
         (Kelvin) temperature scale, since the gas, according to the
         equation, would have zero volume at -273 deg C. The absolute
         temperature scale was defined so that absolute zero equals -273
         deg C and each absolute degree is the same size as a Celsius
         degree. (The modern value for absolute zero is -273.15 deg C.)
         This new temperature scale allows Charles's law to be written
         V/T = constant, where V is the volume of the gas, T is the
         temperature on the absolute scale, and the constant depends on
         the pressure and the amount of gas present. An important device
         resulting from Charles's law is the gas thermometer.

         Joseph Guy-Lussac studied the relationship between pressure and
         temperature and in 1802 found an equation similar to Charles's
         law: P/T = constant.

         Boyle's, Charles's, and Gay-Lussac's laws may be combined to
         express a generalized gas law, PV/T = constant, where the value
         of the constant depends on the amount of gas present and T is
         the absolute (or Kelvin) temperature.

         The generalized gas law may be written in another form: PV/T =
         nR, or PV = nRT; in this form it is called the ideal-gas law. R
         is the gas constant, and n is the number of moles of gas. The
         gas constant can be evaluated experimentally as R = 0.082 liter
         atm/kelvin moles. Knowing R, the fourth variable can be
         evaluated if any three are known.

         The laws discussed above are valid for most gases at moderate
         temperatures and pressures. At low temperatures and high
         pressures, gases deviate from the above laws because the
         molecules are moving slowly at low temperatures and they are
         closer together on the average at higher pressures. Both of
         these effects increase the attractive forces between the
         molecules that cause the deviations from the normal gas laws.

         The gas laws are used by chemists to measure amounts of gases.
         The weighing of gases is usually cumbersome and a technique to
         be avoided, but by using the gas laws the chemist can obtain
         the weight of gas simply by measuring the volume of the gas at
         a known temperature and pressure.

Does this happen when the engine is cold or hot?  If it is hot, I would
suggest measuring the pressure decay to see if the system is holding
fuel after you shut the car off.  Since you've replaced the fuel pump, we
can assume the check valve in the pump is OK.  I would guess the fuel
accumulator is leaking.  If the engine is cold when this happens, it
sounds like the cold start injector isn't working, because if it was, the
engine would most likely fire up - not just sit there and crank.  I would
also suggest you check the control pressure, as it sounds as if this may
be a problem (read "warm-up regulator").  If I'm not mistaken, when the
warm-up regulator fails, the control pressure stays on the high side,
causing the mixture to lean out.  This adversely affects starting.

Unfortunately, without doing some pressure tests, I think you'll only be
guessing if you attempt to start replacing components.  

Good Luck!!

I just bought one for my 85/2 944. It only comes with a rubber 
gasket and just presses into the two holes. 

To Glue or not to Glue, that is the question. Folks on the list
say not to glue it, so that if someone want to steal it, then they
can do so without damaging the color or body. 

I think that if you have full coverage on you car, than at-least
the emblem and the body damage is covered by the insurance.

the trouble of grafting a '72 oil filler door and installing a complete '72

Well, you asked for comments.
 
The nominal torque split of the 993 C4 is 31/69, unless the center
differential diffs. I don't know what its limits are, but I don't think it
can go as far as 0/100 or 100/0.
 
I think Audi also used an electronically modulated hydraulic clutch system

Subject:  Exhaust noise, love of

Dustin Boyette's paean to exhaust noise took me back to Lubbock, Texas, circa
1956 (are you tired of this yet?).  My first motor vehicle (age 13, yes,
legal in them days) was a Cushman Eagle, a kind of pseudo-motorcycle with
scooter-sized wheels.  It was a 6 hp one-lunger, but with the core taken out
of the exhaust pipe (one screw, and voila!), it made a truly wonderful sound,
to thrill a teenager's heart. Throttle up, back off suddenly, maybe blip it a
time or two... snarling lions, man.  Then there was my first car, a '51 Ford
flathead V-8; with dual glasspack mufflers, the rumble shook the earth at
least... well, a *block* away.  Vroom, blat-t-t-t!

Back to reality: the norm for exhaust noise has really changed since the
'60s, and things we could get away with then would get you a Big Ticket now.
My own tolerance for exhaust noise has decreased, maybe out of fear of
deafness, but also from my desire to listen to the radio at less than 100 dB.
And then there's simple consideration for others; the numbers of vehicles on
our streets are so much greater than when I was a lad that if very many of us
chose loud exhausts, life would be decidedly less pleasant.

I do admit an occasional hankering to make some *real* noise... wouldn't it
be nice is "lakes pipes" (any of you old farts remember those) were legal?

So, Dustin: enjoy your exhaust note, but *please* don't come by the house
full throttle at 3 a.m.!

Theo,

   On my 944 I had the same problem with my coolant gauge after I had
a new waterpump installed. The gauge will stay around the red zone. The
dealer where I had the job done, checked out the coolant system and
and assured me that the coolant temperature is fine and that the
gauge is just showing incorrect (high) reading. 

   Not willing  to compromise, I posted the problem to this list and
someone on the list suggested to properly bleed the coolant system. I
followed the recommended procedure to bleed the system and since then
I have had no problem ( i.e high reading ) from my coolant gauge.

Don't know much about Jetta or 924 but you ask for comments and

The reason airplane tires are inflated with nitrogen is because nitrogen

This is normal.  Cold oil is much thicker (viscous) than warm oil and
generates more resistance to its being pumped through the oil
passages.  On cold start my 944 also registers oil pressure near
the top of the gauge.  When warm, the gauge reads about one
third of the way up at idle and then goes back up near the top
as RPMs increase.

But the oil pressure IS high when the oil is cold. Cold oil is thick->high
pressure; hot oil is thin->lower pressure. Doesn't sound like a problem.

Normal.  Expect to see about 5 bar off idle, 4 bar idle, when the car
is cold.  Can drop to under 2 bar at idle when hot.  Only worry if it
ever drops to or below 1 bar.

Symptom of a failed sender is that the meter pegs as soon as the electrics
are turned on but while the engine isn't running.

If you ever have to replace it (or have it replaced), take the old one
and open it up.  Tap around the crimp with a chisel.  Really a neat little

Ken,

Actually, this is for everyone on the list who is not an original
owner.  You ought to visit your friendly neighborhood dealer and
fill out a card they have.  This card lets PCNA know that you own
the car.  They'll notify you of any recalls and service actions.

The dealer can also look up the warranty, recall, and service
action history of any US Porsche, through PCNA.  They cannot, of
course, necessarily find its non-warranty service records.  However,
they as often as not can point you to the selling dealer, who is
likely to have the records, often computerized and therefore
easily available.

We went through this process when we picked up a used Benz for
Mrs. Gross last Feb.  Most educational.

I had a similar experience after the first time I worked on my 951.  If more
than one gauge is acting strange at the same time I would suspect that
there is a common problem.  In my case I had removed the negative terminal
to the battery which caused the other end (ground to the car body) to loosen.
This resulted in a weak grounding point.

Easy solution is to remove the other end of the battery negative cable, clean
connector and connection area on the body, then replace and tighten to the 
correct torque.  This solved the faulty gauge readings.

I have a problem that I hope some of you may be able
to help with.  I have a 85.5 944 that has a vibration
noticed by the gear shifter shaking around whenever
the RPM reaches about 3700 -3900.  This happens with
the car sitting still, clutch in and out, in any gear
(except I haven't tried in 5th yet).  It goes away with
higher and lower rpms.  It shows both directions through
the band.

The engine mounts are now both new, the timing belts have
now been checked multiple times, all exhaust mounts have
been looked at, and this week the transmission mount has
been examined.  If you have any additional ideas or thoughts,
I would appreciate them.

Well I use Helium in my tires, to make my car lighter and therefore
go faster.  It is amazing, when I go over the crest of a hill, I can
get great hang times, and then turn on the rocket fuel thrusters to
let me pass in the overhead lane.  I am thinking aobut using a system
such as the Humm-Vee (Hummer) uses to inflate/deflate tires while driving.
This way, I could replace the Helium with Freon without even stopping, 
and thus cool the car more.  Or I could use nitrous-oxide and always drive
around happy  with a smile :-) :-) :-)

I'm not sure when Porsche started to use 5-speeds in the 930, but my
'84 has a 4-speed and I can assure you that you won't run out of gears.
My car is good for 55 m.p.h in first, 85-90 in second,and ~130 in third.
The owners manual says top speed is 160, though i've never seen it.

I would like to have a 5 (or 6) speed in my car though. The gearing is so
high that starting from a dead stop can't be done quickly.

I would suggest it indicates that your oil is still viscous and has not 
thinned out  due to heating.

944s tend to run with the oil pressure up in the the 4-5 range on the gauge, 
mine only drops to 3 when the engine is both idling and warm.

If you are still concerned check you have a clean filter and clean, new  oil 
of the correct viscosity for the climate you operate the vehicle in and then 
check again.

I have been unhappy with Stoddard's rotor pricing, so I can believe
their high prices, as the same high costs were applied
to my '66 912!  One other thing to watch for:  The small grommet

You may want (as I did) to clean up the trailing/bannana arms while

And they are the only ones to carry it.  I hunted high-and-low for a

Stoddard and grumbling about the bill.

(However, that was nothing compared to a bushing for the rear of the

Lou...

After reading the responses provided by Kevin and George I'm going to have to
qualify the below as a possibly non-944-universal solution - just to protect
my hiney!  But, on the 944s2 you have to pull the front cowling to access the
air filter and once you've got the cowling in hand, the plastic caps holding
the badge in place are there for the taking (or removing as the case might be).

The cowling (on my s2) is held in place by a row of screws along the hood line,
and a couple of bolts and screws which can be accessed by raising the head
lights and removing the weatherstripping sandwiched between the frame and
the front valence. I realize your front valance is different from mine, but
I would think the cowlings are universal. However, its very possible the s2
cowlings were modified to permit easy removal for the filter change.  Anyway,
with the fasteners removed, you slide the cowling forward and its off!

Once you've located all the fasteners it's really a quick operation, about 30
minutes roundtrip. I would definitely investigate whether or not this procedure
is compatible with your vintage of 944.  Prying the badge off doesn't sound
too appetizing . .

P-Limo) One year, Rocky A. who owns the Benihana restaurant chain ran the 
One Lap of America race in a 911 limo, which I believe was based on a '72 
911T Targa. OLOA is primarily a street TSD rally but does include track 
racing and auto-x for points. My favorite entrant came from two guys who 
each had a Dodge Omni Goes Like Hell. They had crashed them before the 
race, 1 front, 1 rear, and ended up combining the front and rear clips to 
build one racer. Porsche entered a couple of 993's (non-limos) in the last 
one.

Where 2 buy 911S) Pano has mostly higher priced cars. And the cars are all 
over the country. Excellence magazine has cars in the classifieds. I would 
check the more reputable independant Porsche service shops in the area. 
Often customer cars are for sale, the cars can be seen close by and you can 
check out the service records without having to see the car first and deal 
with its owner. They will usually tell you if the car is tracked regularly, 
and why the owner is selling, 2 things an owner might lie about. It also 
helps you pick the shop that you want to do the pre-inspection of your 
prospective purchase. Regular customers always let their mechanics know 
when a car is for sale. All P-cars are maintenance-intensive, and 25 year 
old ones more so. My August issue of the Porsche Market Letter had 2 cars, 
both '73 911S for $15-17K, neither in CA. Sept. Pano had 6 cars $9K-27K, 2 
of which were in CA. Email me if you want the ads.

You also might want the check out any PCA events in your area. Probably not 
too many cars for sale, but it's still a shot.

I can't imagine ANY Porsche being used as a tow vehicle, even for another 
Porsche, a pure waste of machinery.  However, Porsche does (or use to) sell 
a tow bar you can mount on the 928, for an outrageous fee of course.  Wonder 
how many they sold?  Or maybe I read this wrong,  perhaps you meant to say 
that the 911 should be towed?

In the NY/Philly area the 911 and 924/944 models are a fairly  common sight, 
they must be like Chevy's in California.  I've seen less than 10 928's the 
past year on the open road, double that if you include the two Porsche 
events I attended.  I bought a 928 mostly because you see so few.

The 928 is a great long distance highway cruiser, which is what I primarily 
do.  If I were going to go dashing around cones or race tracks on a regular 
basis, then I would opt for a 911 or 944.  I don't want to tick off the 
owners of other Porsche models, different Porsches for different needs.  I 
would however draw the line at a Porsche station wagon for fulfilling my 
future family hauling needs.

FWIW Helium has been used in attempts to lower weight in bicycles.  The
US team at the Olympics and various others at track events and record
attempts are reported to have used Helium to save weight.  I've never
seen it done but it was reported in several publications.  Always seemed
really silly to me but bicycle racers do become obsessed with weight. 
In Barcelona the winning pursuit bike was built by Lotus, during
development they noticed that the painter had used primer because the
frame was overweight by something like 4 grams.  In the finale version
they didn't paint the frame at all to save about 12 grams.  Maybe
Porsche will build a track bike next ;-)

Husain,

   I am hoping that I will only have to disconnect the Brakes and Rotor
   assembly, tie-rod end and the bottom two bolts of the Struts assembly. 
   Is this a very simple view and am I missing something?

Yes, that's about right.

   I picked up a used spindle from "Porschephiles' very own George B."
   Any opinions on used parts of this nature?

Well, you know that I think George is a pretty square dealer.  In my
own case, since we have a Magnaflux kit, I'd check 'em with it.

   How difficult is it to disconnect the tie rod end from the spindle
   assembly without the special tie-rod puller tool?

No, you really do not.  It's a waste of money most often.  I bought
one like six years ago, used it once, and gave it to the shop last
year after five years of dust gathering.  It would be a help I suppose
in the odd case of the knuckle really being corroded/etc. onto the
ball stub.  But I wouldn't throw $80 at what is likely a non-problem.

   Do I need a spring compressor for the struts or not?

Not for this job, only if you're replacing the struts at the same time.
Don't event bother disassembling the top of the strut, that is, from
the fender.

   If I mark the location of each disconnected part, would I still
   need an alignment after the assembly?

Ah, well, as a practical matter, I'd say so.

   I only have access to Haynes Manual, is that enough for this 
   job?

Kind of inaccurate, but you can figure most stuff out.  I'd at least
pick up a tech spec booklette for your car so's you know the torque
values.  WKD.423.320.

Stuff to think about doing (in for a dime, in for a dollar):

 - Check rotor thickness and replace if too thin,
 - Replace the two bolts, nuts, etc., which attach the spindle
   to the strut (one eccentric, one normal).  They tend to fasten
   less well after several on/off cycles.
 - Replace the wheel bearings.  If not replace, at least clean
   and repack.
 - Use anti-seize.

Why are you replacing both spindles?  Or should I not ask?

I don't want to be guilty of "piling-on" here, but this message needs to be
heard.  Since the anti-social behaviour of any member of an identifiable
group tends to be associated with all members of that group; in a word,
"Don't!"  Waking your neighbors who need their sleep in the course of
earning a living, is beyond juvenile or stupid.  It is *SERIOUSLY* anti-
social.  Mellow is cool, LOUD is *anti-social*.

If you were in his environment, would you provoke an adult male predator;
say, for the sake of argument, a sleeping adult male grizzly?  Haven't you
learned that the adult male human is *the* most dangerous predator alive?
What you propose is stupid and juvenile. In the real world, you will be apt
to discover, to your sorrow, it to be non-habitforming as well.

I suggest that you put a higher premium on your own health.  Immature and
assinine behaviour is often overlooked by adults.  However, when it goes
beyond that, and becomes *SERIOUSLY* anti-social, it frequently, if not
usually, invokes retaliation of some kind, appropriate to the offense.  If
you do that to me, and I can get near enough, you will need serious medical
attention immediately.

Please observe the conspicuous lack of smileys in this message.

>for coloring the black Fuchs to match the white car ?

    I don't know if you can have these powder painted, if you can
  thats your best finish (maybe not your best color match, but will last
  forever).

    Second best is to paint;
   1. Strip off any old paint (are the originals anodized ?). Strip off any
       wheel weights, valve stems, etc. Pop out your hubcaps and paint them
       separately.
   2. Prime them with an etching type or epoxy primer. I'd suggest
       Dupont Vari-Prime or PPG DP-90. These both have excellent adhesion
       and will stick to aluminum.
   3. Sand the primer. Forged wheels will take fewer iterations of this,
       depending on just how smooth you want your wheels.
   4. For the paint itself, try and match the same color code as your car with
       either Dupont Imron or PPG Deltron. These are both very durable
       urethanes, you will need one quart to do all 4 wheels. Gloss flattener
       isn't available for Imron, in case you want to take the sheen off the
       paint.
   5. If you were painting them for an aluminum look, I'd suggest using a
       silver metallic out of a spray can then topcoating with Deltron clear
       (like a DAU-82). Imron clear is only available in gallons, which is 
       probably more than you'll want to use. Don't use clear out of a spray
       can, they ALL yellow.

    When painting, the best advice I can give you is to not rush things;
   if you have a touchup gun, use it instead of a full size gun, or keep
   the volume of paint down/pressure at the gun down. With a very small
   surface  its easy to put on too much paint and get runs. Put on just
   enough, and let it get tacky before you put on the next coat.
    Lastly, make sure you take the wheels to someone who won't hack them
   completely up when remounting the tires (my last mistake).

         Good luck ! Lee A.

have lots and lots of gases and as a result lots and lots of ions.  The 
result is that we probably get a much higher n, for a given volume of air 
than we would if we had just one gas, because of all the ions floating 
around. Further more, N2 is not going to break down to N + N.  To explain 
my thoughts, the only reason we use salt on winter roads is the fact that 
NaCl will break down in water to Na+ and Cl-.  There is a formula again 
that tells you how much the freezing temperature of a liquid will depress 
when you mix something in it.  One of the variables in this formula is 
again n.   Well, by having NaCl, just plain table salt, break down, you 
double the amount of n compared to what you would have if you mixed in 
the water something that does not break down.
Now you may ask, why nitrogen.  I will hazard a guess here.  It is rather 
inert.  Hydrogen or oxygen would be simply out of the question, too 
volatile.  I also think nitrogen is rather cheap when compared to 
helium, argon or crypron (or any one of the inert gases group VIII).
I apologize to the folks who find this way to dry and technical.

Dave -
Sorry to hear about your suspension console :-(  I can sympathize with you as I discovered
some rot on mine as I was replacing my battery tray earlier this summer.  I ended up just
temporarily pop-riveting the new tray in place and closing the deck lid, figuring that this
winter I will drop the engine and have the console repaired along with the rusty rear trunk floor.
I haven't looked into repair costs yet.  Until winter, I'm doing a Sgt. Schultz imitation -- I see Nothing!
I know Nothing!

Are you saying that the fuel pump is hanging by its lines - or that it just isn't there?  If it's not there,
it is probably located up under the fuel tank, either by the factory ('75-'76) or as a modification ('70-'74).

A related question to the group:
My '75 914 has plastic(?) fuel lines going from the pump to the engine compartment.  Do these
become brittle with age and need replacement?  I know about replacing the rubber lines.

Good luck with your repairs,

Hello all:

>From the BMW list last season...

Nokia makes 3 tires worth considering:

Hakkapolitta NR09 -- a older tire, excellent in snow but noisy
Hakkapolitta NR10 (or just Hakkapolitta 10)
                  -- newer design, excellent in snow, slightly quieter
                     not available in certain sizes (but the NR09 generally
                     is available in these sizes, which are usually narrower
                     tires for older european cars.)
Nokia NRW -- "all season"; not as agressive as the NR09 or 10,
                     and reportedly more pleasant on dry pavement.  far
                     better than most tires labeled "all season" from what
                     i hear.

I agree with you here Stephen. At about 3900-4000 rpm, the power really
comes in.  I found my '87 944S lacking below 4000 rpm.  I'm curious

As for fitting a tall driver inside a 944, an early model, without
the power seats, affords more room than the later models with the
power seats.

As help for those of us who have to lean the seat back to fit a helmet
inside, there was an extended hub wheel that makes it easier to reach
once the seat is leaned back.  It's just hard to find a burgundy one

Those are some fairly high level names to drop! I have a friend that has

the trouble of grafting a '72 oil filler door and installing a complete '72
oil system like the one in Bruce's project car. A lot of work and of
questionable legality for vintage racing, but it will make for a better
balanced car! There is a historical basis for this type of system since the
911R used virtually the same approach.

Hi, Mike.
 
Well, you asked for comments.
 
The nominal torque split of the 993 C4 is 31/69, unless the center
differential diffs. I don't know what its limits are, but I don't think it
can go as far as 0/100 or 100/0.
 
I think Audi also used an electronically modulated hydraulic clutch system
like the older C4 for their high-end AWD cars, but I'm not sure. Anybody out

Subject:  Exhaust noise, love of

Dustin Boyette's paean to exhaust noise took me back to Lubbock, Texas, circa
1956 (are you tired of this yet?).  My first motor vehicle (age 13, yes,
legal in them days) was a Cushman Eagle, a kind of pseudo-motorcycle with
scooter-sized wheels.  It was a 6 hp one-lunger, but with the core taken out
of the exhaust pipe (one screw, and voila!), it made a truly wonderful sound,
to thrill a teenager's heart. Throttle up, back off suddenly, maybe blip it a
time or two... snarling lions, man.  Then there was my first car, a '51 Ford
flathead V-8; with dual glasspack mufflers, the rumble shook the earth at
least... well, a *block* away.  Vroom, blat-t-t-t!

Back to reality: the norm for exhaust noise has really changed since the
'60s, and things we could get away with then would get you a Big Ticket now.
My own tolerance for exhaust noise has decreased, maybe out of fear of
deafness, but also from my desire to listen to the radio at less than 100 dB.
And then there's simple consideration for others; the numbers of vehicles on
our streets are so much greater than when I was a lad that if very many of us
chose loud exhausts, life would be decidedly less pleasant.

I do admit an occasional hankering to make some *real* noise... wouldn't it
be nice is "lakes pipes" (any of you old farts remember those) were legal?

So, Dustin: enjoy your exhaust note, but *please* don't come by the house
full throttle at 3 a.m.!

Theo,

   On my 944 I had the same problem with my coolant gauge after I had
a new waterpump installed. The gauge will stay around the red zone. The
dealer where I had the job done, checked out the coolant system and
and assured me that the coolant temperature is fine and that the
gauge is just showing incorrect (high) reading.

Subject: Tires and Nitrogen

Folks,

I decided that it would be good to check with the "sci.chem" netwnews group
on the internet about this subject. below you will find some the responses I
have received so far. The consensus is that nitrogen is not a win at all
when compared to air even if the air has some water content. I think we can
now put this old wife's tale to bed now.

Scott Winders

Alex Krooglik (krooglik@minerva.cis.yale.edu), a Graduate Student from the
Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University wrote:

Well, you're lucky enough to own a Porsche, you may as well learn how to
drive the damn thing properly.

Anyway, to your question. Filling the tires with nitrogen will not make any
difference and I'll tell you why. When you are rounding the corners very
sharply, what you are doing is transferring frictional energy to the air.
Additionally, the air is also being compressed. This is the most important
issue. You see, the temperature change of a gas due to compression is a
function of the heat capacity of the gas (which in scientific terms is Cp,
or heat capacity at constant pressure). The process of compression is, in
thermodynamics, called "adiabatic", that is, no heat transfer takes place.
i.e. All heating takes place by performing "work" on the air in your tyres,
namely, your friction.

So, the crux of the matter is, the heat capacities of air and nitrogen are
nearly the same (as you see, air is 79% nitrogen), hence adding nitrogen
would have little effect in the temperature and volume change occurring in
your tyres.

Unfortunately, you are not going to have many alternatives either. The molar
heat capacities of most gases at pressures around atmospheric (35 psi is
only 3 x atmospheric pressure) are all _very_ similar. Unless someone
points out a really exotic gas, you aren't left with many alternatives.

The water vapour has little effect on the compressibility of the gas really.

So, of the other gases you might consider, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
pure oxygen, methane, butane, etc, you will find none are really suitable for
what you need.

If you've any other questions, let me know.

John Douglas Porter (porterj@uclink.berkeley.edu) from U.C. Berkeley wrote:

Because the temperatures you are dealing with are so far above the boiling
points of the constituents of air (except water vapor, which is a very
minor component) and the pressures are so low, the ideal gas law is
actually quite good at describing the relationship between pressure,
volume and temperature of the air in your tires.

The deviations are in the small percent range.  There are improved gas
laws with a few more parameters but they don't really improve the
description.  If you are interested, the data are in the Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics.  There are several semi-empirical equations that
look like PV=nRT with extra parameters for P and V and a slightly modified
R (temperature-dependent, that looks like slightly higher than linear T
dependence overall).

Anyway, since the ideal gas law is so good, one consequence is that the
identity of the gas molecules is completely irrelevant.  So there will be
no discernable difference between air and pure nitrogen, or pure oxygen
(not advised...unless you want to make one hell of a spectacular exit) or
just about any other easily-available gas.  Even heat capacities aren't
really all that different, unless a monatomic rare gas is used.  The
temperature rise of the tire will be dominated by the heat capacity of the
rest of the tire anyway, because the mass of the gas is insignificant.

What will be different for the different gases, though, will be their
non-thermodynamic parameters, especially their heat conductance.  I don't
see how that will help.

Bill C Hutton (wchutt@alex.monsanto.com) from Monsanto Company, Corporate
Research wrote:

Your question really has to do with rubber chemistry. Heat plus oxygen
plus water causes chemical reactions in rubber. Dry nitrogen provides
an inert environment and these reactions (oxidation) of the rubber can
not occur inside the tire. Oxidation will change the properties of the
rubber and could efect the performance of the tire... particularly the
sidewalls where the rubber is the thinest.

Wet air could have different expansion properties than dry nitrogen as
the tire heats up. But I doubt this is a major factor.

Subject: re:930 Turbo HP

A correction to Turbos being imported to the U.S. Porsche stopped in '79 
and started again with the '86 model. The '78/'79 and '86 all had the 3.3 
motor. The '79 was rated at 261 h.p. and the '86 at 282 h.p. Though the 
Turbos were brought in thru the grey market my mechanic suggested 
avoiding them, though I don't remember why. When I was having my '78 
rebuilt I was looking into some of the go fast goodies. The folks at 
Windward Performance said the '86s used the same fuel system as the '76s 
and the '78/'79s used a larger fuel system, I didn't need to add a 
micro-fueler. I also looked in to SC Turbo grind cams, Windward said I 
wouldn't loose any power at the bottom end. When I contacted Web Cam, 
they said I would loose power at the bottom end. Bruce Anderson suggested 
using the 964 cams, Windward said the 964 cams didn't work very well and 
to stick with the SC cams, so who knows. Hot rodding these motors is very 
expensive, Intercooler $1500 - $2000, Free flow exhaust $1200, micro 
fueler $1200 +, add to that, installation, your talking(spending) 
$4000-$5000. I didn't do any of the above because I ended up spending 
over $5000 having the top end and a few other things done. For daily 
driving, the  261 h.p. is plenty. It's extremely difficult to stay under 
70 m.p.h. because it takes so little power to get there and it feels 
like I'm only doing 50. The used Turbo prices are coming down, at least 
in the bay area. I've seen acouple of low milage, exceptionally clean 
ones for under$30,000.

 I have owned a 944, driven an 944S, 944S2 and 944 Turbo, (but not a Turbo S)
I agree about the 944S, below 4000rpm the engine is about the same as a 944,
maybe even a little weaker, but kicks in stronger above 4000rpm, however the
944S2 pulls very strongly and very smoothly from around 1500rpm all the way
up to redline.  I think an S2 would be a much better choice for auto-x, the
response is much better, also i have heard that Kelly Moss racing was able to
post better times here at Road America in the S2 than in the 86-88 Turbo cars.
  I found both the Turbo and S2 cars to be much easier for around town driving
than either the 944 or 944S, maybe just because of the higher gearing.  Also
S2's are much harder to find, and more expensive than 86-88 Turbos.  You should
drive *BOTH* types of cars before making a choice.

Subject: carbon deposits and water

Hi, Steve.
 
If water steam cleans off the oil film, what would gasoline vapor do?
 
Water injection and to a lesser extent water-methanol injection is an old
trick to keep engines from detonating. Everybody -- Allies, Germany, Japan
- -- used it to produce temporary extreme power under emergency conditions
(combat power) for fighters and bombers. One German system used nitrous
oxide to make a bomber capable of outrunning British fighters, until the
bottle ran dry.
 
A significant percentage of the water vapor will dissociate during the
combustion process to form hydrogen and oxygen. Somewhere down the exhaust
pipe any leftover H and O2 may recombine, or tie up with carbon to form HC
and CO2 and CO. All of the water does not carry through the whole combustion
process as steam.

I'm still in the throes of fixing my warm/hot start problem
that is amazingly similar in symptoms. I've replaced the
fuel pump check valve and purchased a CIS injection test
guage and eliminiated the warm start regulator and the
accumulator as suspects. At this point it looks like I have
a leaking injector (pretty common according to local P-mechanics)
and just need to take the time (hopefully this weekend) to test
each injector for bleed-down. The cold start valve is really not
a suspect. If all of the injectors pass test, then it gets expensive
as it's probably a problem in the fuel distributor (~$450 + Labor)
I'm hoping it's  injector(s).

Being on the prowl for a 911 Sportmatic, I recently purchased a book 
entitled "The Used 911 Story" written by Peter Zimmerman. I would highly 
recomend this book to anyone wanting to purchased a used 911. He goes 
through every year, starting from 1965, to 1993 and describes whats good, 
bad, etc.. about each year and what problems to look out for. He also has a 
very comprehensive checklist of what things to check out for signs of 
trouble on all 911's.

I ordered it from a mail order book store which advertises in Excellence
magazine, the name escapes me right now. You might want to order a copy.

Thanks,

I can't agree.  We sold our 87 944S and replaced it with a 91 944S2.  I'd
agree with your assesment of the 944S, there just wasn't much there below
4K.  Different story on the S2 however.  The car has loads of torque and
will pull strongly from 2,200 on up to redline.  This was really noticable
up at Watkins Glen when we'd come up the boot and pull away from almost
anything because of the large amount of torque available.  The faster cars
would then catch us on the straight...  The S2's about as fast as the older
turbo, but has more torque down low.

I hate to make this suggestion but your clutch plate center may be coming 
apart. The center of the disc is a big rubber donut and they are known to 
disintegrate with age (and heat).

As the rubber hub falls apart it will :

a) get out of balance,

and/or

 b) lose  its rigidity in a vertical plane. Either or both of these 
conditions could be causing your vibration.

The cost of replacing the the clutch is not trivial

Hope this is not the problem

Subject: Why gauges sometimes read high

As expected, whether a high resistance contact causes a gauge to indicate 
higher or lower depends on the gauge + sender wiring arrangement.

For illustration, assume the gauge in the two examples below
indicates higher with more current thru the gauge.  

My examples are from 20+ year old cars.  Extrapolate to newer cars at 
your own risk.

Sender = transducer = FREQUENTLY a variable resistance device.

1. Sender used as shunting resistor 

               +12 ----|
                       >
                       <  <-- series resistor
                       >
                       |----------------|            
                       |                <            
                       |                >  <--- sender
                       |                <
                     gauge              >
                       |                |
                       V                V


  In this case, the gauge will indicate HIGHER if there is a high
  resistance contact to the sender, since the sender shunts less current
  from the gauge.

  If the wire leading to the sender shorts to chassis, the gauge indicates
  lower.

  From my experience, a similar arrangement is used in the 1972 911T oil level
  gauge + sender, since mine indicated a quart or two higher when the sender
  had an ohmic contact to the sender's output tab.  

  I verified this today on my 69T by pulling the wire off the oil level sender.
  The oil level indicator pegged high.

2. Sender in series with the gauge

               +12 ----|
                       |      
                     gauge   
                       |    
                       >    
                       <    <-- sender
                       >   
                       |
                       V


  In this case, the gauge will indicate LOWER if there is a high resistance
  contact to the sender, since the higher the sender resistance, the lower
  the current that will flow in the gauge.

  A sender wire shorted to chassis will indicate higher.

  The fuel level sender in my 69T is this type, again verified by
  pulling off the sender connector in the trunk.

  The fuel indicator dropped to the bottom.

In EITHER arrangement, a HIGHER supply voltage, caused by a failed
voltage regulator, would cause either gauge/sender arrangement to 
indicate HIGHER.

The factory wiring diagrams don't help in determining which type of
gauge/sender arrangement applies since they don't give enough detail.  

For resistance type senders referenced to ground, an open (high resistance)
or a short to ground (low resistance) will indicate which type is used.

Having driven them both extensively, I find that the S2 has substantially
more power on the low-end than does the S.  The general "feel" of the cars
is also quite different.  Although both are wonderful cars, the S2 is one
of my favorites.

Subject: Crumpled 944 85/2:Totaled?

My soon-to-be-ex has been liberally abusing her 944, with multiple dings
and dents on virtually all accesible sheet metal.  Mechanics and interior,
however, remain good.  Last week she hit an imovable inanimate object
with the left front and broke the windshield with a dense animate object
about the size of a human head.  Estimate to fix the current damage is
about $5000, of which around $1800 is reasonably priced and sourced
parts, the rest labor.  The windshield would take another $600, parts
and labor.  This expenditure of $5600 would produce a badly dinged
car, thew residue of previous damage.

Two dismantlers have each offered $2500.  Hence the net cost of keeping/
fixing is $5600 + 2500 = $8100.  This seems like too much for a badly
scarred but servicible 944 of this vintage.  Additional variables of
possible relevence: automatic (yic!), one powere seat, all leather,
only 67k miles.

Question- Is this car totaled? If not, why not?

Wisdom (spare the wit) eagerly and urgently solicited.

On the subject of adjusting system pressure via shims.....  I recently took
my car in to a shop to fix some CIS problems (hindsight being 20/20, I should
have bought the pressure gauges and done this myself) - anyway, we (I ended
up helping quite a bit with the repairs) had to add more shims than should
have been necessary to get the system pressure up to specs.  The fuel pump is
OK - system pressure coming out of the filter was >90psi.  The woman at the
shop (these folks are a husband/wife team - she does the CIS stuff, among
other things) felt that I should consider replacing the fuel distributor - I
didn't share her opinion.  The piston portion of my pressure regulator showed
some slight wear/scoring - I'm going to placate myself with assumption that
fuel is leaking past the piston into the return line, hence the need to add
additional shims.  Does this make any sense, or do ya'll think my
distributor is to blame??

Just wondering..

I just went by the local VW store to get some 356 carburetor jets (OK, I

tighten the axle nut to some godawful number, 350 or 400 ft.-lbs, or else

Subject:  Solex jets

Pete and Stan:

I missed the first posting on this subject.  Apparently Stan asked about
obtaining Solex jets.  

A surprisingly little-known secret:  The Main and Air Correction jets for
Mikuni carbs interchange quite nicely with Solexes.  Mikunis are stock on lots
of rice-burners, both two-wheel and four-wheel.

I learned this at Rockwell Motorsports in San Jose, CA, when I was using thier
chassis dyno to tune my 912.  In preparation for putting my car on the dyno, I
had collected a range of Solex jet sizes from the many PCA swap meets we enjoy
here in the Bay Area.  As Murphy would dictate, the car ended up needing a jet
size that I didn't have.  The owner (forget his first name, last name Rockwell,
and a very nice guy) said "no problemo" and went over to his extensive
selection of Mikuni parts, and picked the necessary size.  Exactly the same
threads and dimensions as Solex.  They just don't have "Solex" stamped on them.

Also, I've got lots of real Solex jets, and might part with some.  Whacha need?

Subject: Wheels for a Race Car

I am in need of some porschephile wisdom!!

I need to get a set of 9x16 and 11x17 racing wheels for the car I am
building.  The plan is to put 245/45R16 and 315/35R17 BFG R1 (230 com-
pound) tires on them.

Do I want three piece wheels? Do I have a choice? What brand and model
number should I get? What else do I need to consider?

My budget is not unlimited, so I would like to get the least expensive
wheels that will do the job safely. But, the wheels need to be light!!!

Subject: Re: 944 S2 vs Turbo S

Having owned a 944S and driven a S2 I can tell you that they are worlds
apart. The 944S was one of the bigger dissapointments in my life. Yes it did
have slightly more power than a standard 944 but only after 4000RPM. It
certainly wasn't worth the price. Also it turned out to be a pain in the butt
maintenance wise. Marginally faster than early (83/84) two valve cars. 
The S2 pulls like a tractor which isn't hard to figure, considering it is a 3
liter. For all around driving it is probably the one to go for. 
I am partial to Turbos but the S2 is certainly more tractable in traffic.
I would avoid the 944S like the plague

I think it would be a piece of cake.  If nothing else, you could advertise
your sport seats in Panorama (as soon as you join PCA), sell them and
purchase some regular seats.  My experience leads me to believe that you
could possibly come out ahead on the deal.

Good luck,

Pete -

Why?
Why do you want a new 993 C4 when, for a few bucks more,
you could have a 928 'woody' station wagon with a rear-
facing seat and an outlet for the nitrous oxide from the
spare?  The Bud Lite would be cooled by the freon in the
tires of course. And, I strongly recommend the 'lakes' exhaust
option with a timer that allows them to go off at 3 a.m.
whether you're in the car or not.

lit up at a track event, would the announcer be compelled 
to cry, "O, the Humanity!" ? or "Whoomp, there it goes!" ?

Yes, that would normally have fueled a perverted, uncomely and fitting
retort...but, I, too, have wittnessed this embarassing and unpredictable
metallic 'burp'/'bealch'. In mine, the only common basis of occurance
from one time to another is that the engine must be running. Other than
that.......   But it's been doing it for at least the last 25k with no
evidence of any thing wrong. And believe me, almost *everything* else has 
broken in those 25k miles!

Does anybody have a clue as to what this is (and will admit it?)

Subjects: Nitrogen and rear wheel nuts

Somehow the nitrogen in tires thread seems to have gotten off track.
It is clear that there is little difference (as a gas) between
nitrogen and air (even with a little water vapor in the air).  On the
other hand compressing air often condenses liquid water out while
bottled nitrogen is dry.  Liquid water will affect the pressure in
the tire at high temperatures beyond what is expected from the gas law.
At 212 F, it will add 15 psi to the pressure.  Thus, there might be
a difference for really hot racing tires that us common street drivers
would never see.  Water will also accelerate corrosion on steel rims.

My rear wheel nut tool is a 3/4 inch drive socket on a bar extended
by a pipe from a 1959 Berkeley bumper.  With someone standing on
the brakes, I can easily loosen and tighten the nuts by jumping on
the pipe.  It is certainly true that you do not want the nut loose
enough to allow play under load.  The damage to the splines can be
incredible.  Think of the splines as being primarily to line things
up and the tight nut as what carries the load.  This isn't exactly
how it works, but it is a good approximation.

I learned about splines and wheel nuts on a 59 Berkeley that the
previous owner had not tightened the wheels properly on.  I ended
up having to shim the spline fitting with wires to take up the
play.  I guess that those of you without access to Berkeley parts
will have to find some other way to extend your breaker bar ;-).

I think I would agree with Will's diagnosis, given the described symptoms,
in particular that the vibration is related to engine speed and not road
speed.  Could also, I suppose, be a problem with the balance shafts.  I
haven't heard of many cars with this sort of problem, however, and am
for that reason a little tentative.

Subject: Nitrogen in Tires

Well, I was chuckling with my lovely wife this afternoon about the N2 in
tires debate, which, I must admit, I was the culprit to instigate this
little excursion.

I had originally intended the aside as a sarcastic remark intended to show
how some drivers will spend large dollars for small improvements in
performance.  My mistake was that I did not include a smiley in my original
comment.

My last word on the subject has to do with observation, not with conjecture
or speculation.

For a few years running, my lovely wife and I were fortunate to work with
the Dyson Racing Team, as they campaigned their Porsche 962 in the IMSA GTP
series.  My recollection of the Daytona pit area included the Goodyear
Racing support truck, which was mounting and balancing tires at a prodigious
rate for the entire period of practice, qualifying and the 24 hour race.

At no time did I see any evidence of Nitrogen bottles there or anywhere else
in the pits during that time.  Goodyear was using nothing but good ol'
compressed Daytona air for inflating (now pay attention to this!) tires that
were going to be traveling at 200 mph for long periods of time!

Now, in my way of thinking (flawed though it may be by years of abuse and
chemicals), if there was any advantage to be gained by using nitrogen in
tires, I would have seen it then and there.

QED, if it was not used there, I doubt that its use on any of the cars that
we drive is going to provide a competitive advantage.  (Of course, if it
helps to keep rubber from oxidizing, there may be a valid reason for using
it, after all...)

I'll go back to sleep now...

Once when I had a Porsche Dealer shop check on an apparent transmission 
leak around the seals I was told that there was no seal problem, and that 
the leaking was the result of filling the transmission too full. Now I 
think my 951 transmission may need some lubricant added. How is the 
proper fluid level determined? Thanks for any suggestions.

Subject: Draining fuel from 924

Would anyone know the best way to drain fuel from the tank of a 924?
I'd like to do it with the minimum mess and spilled fuel.  The vehicle has
had the fuel since December (about 1/2 tank) and will not start (bad fuel is
the probable cause).  I'd like to drain it, hopefully without being drown in
gas.

Has anyone tried to drain by using the fuel pump to drain the tank?

Thanks

Frank,

Fill to a level 6 to 8 mm. below the filler bore, that is, the bottom-
most point of the hole.  Most people stick their pinky in to check --
not terribly calibrated, but not terribly critical.

Rick,

First of all, water does not boil at 212 F when subjected to the
pressures a tire is inflated to. I don't know how much higher the
boiling point of water is at 20 or 25 psi, but it is significant.
Also, how can you state that the water, when it turns to a gas, will
add 15 psi? Don't you need to know how much water is in the tire and the
volume of air in the tire to figure this out? The answer is yes. Don't
forget that moisture is not a friend to air compressors, so they tend to
be kept as "dry" as possible.

Again, the bottom line is that nitrogen offers no significant advantage
over air as a gas for tires.

I dunno, but I decided to get them instead of the "guaranteed to be OE" 
rotors from United German mainly because Zimms had them and UGI had
them on back-order. So, they arrived a few days back --- Zimmerman

Oh, they also have the parking brake pads, about $68 a set, plus a $50

Having just joined this group I find the topics interesting & 
informative but note the lack of discussion on the 928.
Living in New Zealand with relatively few Porsches seems a different 
world from USA or GB presumably where the majority of "porschephiles" 
mail sources from.

With summer just starting I felt it was time to address the problem I 
have of the fan (interior) and probably the air conditioning not 
working.However I have had the 928 at the auto electrician today only 
to be told that he cant find any obvious cause.

Symptoms- Having just come thru winter I cannot be sure exactly when 
the fan/air stopped but first noticed about a month ago.I checked the 
fuses and unfortunately it wasnt that simple. The fan does work when 
you slide the controll to demist but not when you turn the dial.I 
only presume the air doesnt work ?.About a week ago it suddenly 
started working (& the air) but just as suddenly stopped.
The small fan that runs all the time still works.

It also doesnt help that the bookshop has had the workshop manual on 
order for two months & I therefore dont have a wiring diagram.

Has anyone else had a similar problem?.

Any suggestions would be gratefully recieved.

Some time ago, there was a discussion concerning how to remove a  36mm
generator nut to R&R the fan from a 356/912. It was suggested  that using an
impact wrench  on the nut as opposed to holding the Generator Hub in a vice
(or with vice grips) might be a Better Idea, as shearing off the key or
ruining the keyway might not be a good idea.
   Last week a Customer  sent me the remains of just such an attempt- holding
the hub in a vice, he attempted to remove the 36mm nut on the fan.
   Result: one BROKEN generator hub, AND one sheared-off key, AND one
elongated keyway in the generator shaft which meant: a ruined generator
shaft! Which meant a ruined generator!
   The rather impressively abused parts are now on display in the collection

The only difference I've noticed between Zimmerman rotors which come in
the PAG box and those which appear in the wholesale aftermarket, is that
the PAG rotors get their hats painted and don't rust.

I see a few p-filers have found out what Spyder really means. Be careful
when bug-busting useing toxic agents. tends to stay in the vent system.

Mufflers, well, my Dad told this one. The story has been confirmed by
many of his Air Corps buddies after a few beers.

Seems after WWII ended, my father and his buddies were stationed 
somewhere in the Stuttgart area. They made a deal with some locals for
a bunch of ex-Wehrmacht Zundapp motorcycles. They sounded pretty good 
with the mufflers removed, so I'm told. They liked a Gasthaus out in the sticks, heading out on Saturday afternoons for a beer-tasting. There was a Sunday morning roll-call they had to make, leaving the Gasthaus at 5am
they could make the formation. 

It seems these Sunday motorcycle runs took them through a few small towns
with quaint houses on narrow streets. The locals were not amused at theirsleep being disturbed. 

One clear Sunday morning the troop was returning through a village when 
suddenly, yellow rain decended on them. Seems the locals had a way of
getting the point across.

The following week, mufflers were on all the bikes.

I like quiet cars. It was always rewarding to autocross with a quiet 
muffler and win. A little head advantage.

Subject:  Solex jets

Pete and Stan:

I missed the first posting on this subject.  Apparently Stan asked about
obtaining Solex jets.  

A surprisingly little-known secret:  The Main and Air Correction jets for
Mikuni carbs interchange quite nicely with Solexes.  Mikunis are stock on lots
of rice-burners, both two-wheel and four-wheel.

I learned this at Rockwell Motorsports in San Jose, CA, when I was using thier
chassis dyno to tune my 912.  In preparation for putting my car on the dyno, I
had collected a range of Solex jet sizes from the many PCA swap meets we enjoy
here in the Bay Area.  As Murphy would dictate, the car ended up needing a jet
size that I didn't have.  The owner (forget his first name, last name Rockwell,
and a very nice guy) said "no problemo" and went over to his extensive
selection of Mikuni parts, and picked the necessary size.  Exactly the same
threads and dimensions as Solex.  They just don't have "Solex" stamped on them.

Also, I've got lots of real Solex jets, and might part with some.  Whacha need?

Having owned a 944S and driven a S2 I can tell you that they are worlds
apart. The 944S was one of the bigger dissapointments in my life. Yes it did
have slightly more power than a standard 944 but only after 4000RPM. It
certainly wasn't worth the price. Also it turned out to be a pain in the butt
maintenance wise. Marginally faster than early (83/84) two valve cars. 
The S2 pulls like a tractor which isn't hard to figure, considering it is a 3
liter. For all around driving it is probably the one to go for. 
I am partial to Turbos but the S2 is certainly more tractable in traffic.
I would avoid the 944S like the plague

you could have a 928 'woody' station wagon with a rear-

Subjects: Nitrogen and rear wheel nuts

Somehow the nitrogen in tires thread seems to have gotten off track.
It is clear that there is little difference (as a gas) between
nitrogen and air (even with a little water vapor in the air).  On the
other hand compressing air often condenses liquid water out while
bottled nitrogen is dry.  Liquid water will affect the pressure in
the tire at high temperatures beyond what is expected from the gas law.
At 212 F, it will add 15 psi to the pressure.  Thus, there might be
a difference for really hot racing tires that us common street drivers
would never see.  Water will also accelerate corrosion on steel rims.

My rear wheel nut tool is a 3/4 inch drive socket on a bar extended
by a pipe from a 1959 Berkeley bumper.  With someone standing on
the brakes, I can easily loosen and tighten the nuts by jumping on
the pipe.  It is certainly true that you do not want the nut loose
enough to allow play under load.  The damage to the splines can be
incredible.  Think of the splines as being primarily to line things
up and the tight nut as what carries the load.  This isn't exactly
how it works, but it is a good approximation.

I learned about splines and wheel nuts on a 59 Berkeley that the
previous owner had not tightened the wheels properly on.  I ended
up having to shim the spline fitting with wires to take up the
play.  I guess that those of you without access to Berkeley parts
will have to find some other way to extend your breaker bar ;-).

Subject: Nitrogen in Tires

Well, I was chuckling with my lovely wife this afternoon about the N2 in
tires debate, which, I must admit, I was the culprit to instigate this
little excursion.

I had originally intended the aside as a sarcastic remark intended to show
how some drivers will spend large dollars for small improvements in
performance.  My mistake was that I did not include a smiley in my original
comment.

My last word on the subject has to do with observation, not with conjecture
or speculation.

For a few years running, my lovely wife and I were fortunate to work with
the Dyson Racing Team, as they campaigned their Porsche 962 in the IMSA GTP
series.  My recollection of the Daytona pit area included the Goodyear
Racing support truck, which was mounting and balancing tires at a prodigious
rate for the entire period of practice, qualifying and the 24 hour race.

At no time did I see any evidence of Nitrogen bottles there or anywhere else
in the pits during that time.  Goodyear was using nothing but good ol'
compressed Daytona air for inflating (now pay attention to this!) tires that
were going to be traveling at 200 mph for long periods of time!

Now, in my way of thinking (flawed though it may be by years of abuse and
chemicals), if there was any advantage to be gained by using nitrogen in
tires, I would have seen it then and there.

QED, if it was not used there, I doubt that its use on any of the cars that
we drive is going to provide a competitive advantage.  (Of course, if it
helps to keep rubber from oxidizing, there may be a valid reason for using
it, after all...)

I'll go back to sleep now...

Rick,

First of all, water does not boil at 212 F when subjected to the
pressures a tire is inflated to. I don't know how much higher the
boiling point of water is at 20 or 25 psi, but it is significant.
Also, how can you state that the water, when it turns to a gas, will
add 15 psi? Don't you need to know how much water is in the tire and the
volume of air in the tire to figure this out? The answer is yes. Don't
forget that moisture is not a friend to air compressors, so they tend to
be kept as "dry" as possible.

Again, the bottom line is that nitrogen offers no significant advantage
over air as a gas for tires.

Slightly academic point, but really excess fuel can in fact wash lubrication

Subject: $931 (924 turbo) / 924 Parts..



Primarily directed to those around the San Francisco Bay Area.  Many of
these parts are too difficult or expensive to ship.

It's time to scrap the Pcar...  Can't afford to "properly maintain" the
beast anymore.  Got a bad turbo, bad wastegate, bad block, slightly
cracked exhaust manifold..  Typical $931 failures.  Cost to repair >
cost of another car.  It's going to be towed to the wrecking yard any
day.

Prices?  Make me an offer I can't refuse.  This stuff needs to disappear
in the next 2 weeks.  I'd hate to add to our land fill problem in 
California.  :^)

I removed most of the good stuff this weekend.  The entire care is
available.  It's fairly worn.  150K+ miles.  The suspension and brakes
were rebuilt about a year before I parked it and have about 10K miles on
them.  There may be other parts that are good that I didn't list.

Good stuff includes:

o  A complete 4 wheel disc, 5 lug wheel 15" wheels (including the
   spare) setup.  A great update for any 924 or turbo without this
   option.  The wheels have 4 205/60 VR15 Comp T/A's in fair condition.  
   Rotors and pads are in great condition, except for a little surface rust.  
   Front A-Arms have new ball joints.  Front bearings are new.  Tie rod ends
   are new.  All four calipers were rebuilt and new pads installed.
   Front rotors are new.  Rear's were resurfaced.
o  Front springs..  2 sets.  220Lb from Performance Parts..  Lowers
   the front about an 1" to 1 1/2".  Anothers set from Automotion that
   are 200Lb.  Lowers the car about the same amount.  This set has dead
   coils that can be cut to further lower the front.
o  New 25mm rear torsion bars, still in the box.  Also from
   Performance parts.
o  Stock front (21/23mm?) and rear (14mm) sway bars including the sway bar 
   mounting kit for 924's that don't have the factory rear sway bar.
o  4 non-sport Koni adjustable shocks with about 10K miles on them.
o  Glass - doors, quarters, and rear hatch with spoiler (with sun
   damage, but looks when cleaned and treated).  Windshield is cracked.
o  Turbo hood.
o  Various motors (doors, wiper, headlights).
o  Cylinder Head "looks" ok.
o  Various relays, including the 931 specific fuel pump relay.
o  Tan interior.  Front seats were recovered.  Not a 100% match, but
   look better than rips and holes.  Front carpet is worn.  Dash is good
   for nothing except scrap.
o  Fan Switch (comes on earlier)
o  Head Gasket Kit (new, in box)
o  Timing Belt (new, in box)
o  Turbo Rebuild Kit (new, in box)
o  "PORSCHE" decal for rear (new, in box)
o  New gaskets for door handles and mirrors. (new, in box)
o  Tranny parts from Performance Parts.  016/9 type like the 944. (new, in box)
	SYC15		1st gear syncro
	SYC16		2nd, 3rd, & 4th gear syncros
	SYC17		5th gear syncro
	477.300.912B	Trans Gasket Set
	016.311.427	Bearing, mainshaft
	016.311.445	Bearing, mainshaft
o  Hella Headlights. (almost new)
o  Battery - Die Hard (almost new)
o  Washer pump, nozzles, & antisiphon valves. (almost new)
o  Switches - Power window, fog, rear Wiper, mirror select (almost new)
o  150MPH (or is it 140?) speedometer (almost new)
o  Brown shift boot (almost new)
o  Shift lever (helps fix sloppy shifting) (almost new)
o  Brown ash tray - improved type (almost new)
o  Cam belt idler..  Improved version. (almost new)
o  Brown Porsche mats, front and rear. (almost new)
o  Washer pump, nozzles, & antisiphon valves. (almost new)
o  Momo steering wheel mount kit with Porsche crest horn button. (almost new)
o  Fuel gauge tank sender (almost new)
o  Battery -  Die Hard (almost new)
o  Lights - Tail, turn, side marker.
o  Cooling fans
o  Oil cooler, hoses, filter adapter.
o  Fuel pumps (high & low pressure)
o  Fuel injection, including injectors, valves, cold start valve,
   flow sensor, frequency valve, injectors, warm-up regulator, etc.
   There a are several (4?) new fuel lines (all those not going to the
   injectors.  The intake manifold has a piece cracked off one of the
   mounts.
o  Power Mirrors - mirrors and motors ok.  Lots of rock chips and
   rubber is sun damaged.
o  Brown luggage cover
o  Brown sunroof cover
o  924 Owners Manual
o  Alternator

Stuff still on the car..  I don't want to remove it.  If you are
inclined to crawl in or under the car, it's yours.  

o  Turbo exhaust system.
o  Entire A/C system.
o  Radiator - probably ok.  Don't remember any leaks.
o  Heater blower / core.
o  Bumpers

The following are known bad:

o  Steering wheel.
o  Console
o  Dash
o  Front Carpet - rear is good, hatch area good, but faded.
o  Wastegate - broken diaphragm
o  Turbo - Probably rebuildable - I have the kit from Performance
o  Parts if there is any interest.
o  Engine.  One cylinder probably was damaged by a cracked ring.
   Probably caused by massive pinging when the wastgate got stuck
   closed.  Full throttle and unlimited boost.  It was fun while it
   lasted.  :^0
o  Exhaust manifold.  It's showing signs of cracking typical of
   $931's.  Right now, the crack is about 2" long of the block side near
   the turbo.  Repairable?
o  Front rack and pinion.  Seems slightly loose.
o  No rear wiper
o  DITC, distributor, heater valve, and starter have already  been
   claimed by other $931 sufferers.
o  The doors are there, but have bondo.  Front fenders are fair.
   Don't know how much bondo might be there.  Too hard to take off.  Be
   my guest if you want to give it a try.
o  Shell, it's sitting in the driveway, free to a good home.  It
   still has the block and 5 speed installed.  The suspension has been
   removed.  The 5 speed tranny, in ok condition.  Typical weak
   synchro's.  I have a box of parts to rebuild it (5 synchros,
   bearings, gaskets).

Subject: Windshield Wiper Streaking

I have no idea whether this stuff is any good, but I have before me a flier
for "303 Wiper Treatment", from the folks who brought you 303 Protectant
(which received good rewiews from this group a while back). It is claimed
to stop annoying chattering, skipping, and streaking. You can get six
applicator packets from them for $3.95 plus $1.00 S & H, good for 2-3
wiper blades per packet. It comes from the unfortunately-named "The
World's Best Products", PO Box 966, Palo Cedro CA 96073-0966, and is
non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally safe, and 100% guaranteed,
according to the flier. 

I Wouldn't take it seriously, except that the 303 Protectant is good, so
maybe this is too. In New England, our windshield wipers fail from
plain wearing out, rather than from ozone or sunlight or things like that.
Maybe if you filled your windshield washers with liquid nitrogen, and
gave them an occasional squirt during the dry season, you Californians
and Arizonans could make your wipers last better?

Subject: 928 engine in 914


Okay fantasy engine swappers. Dennis Kravig (think I spelled it right)
did it in 1990. Took him a few years to do it, here's why: There ain't
enough room in the car. Dennis, as i recall, lengthened the chassis 
almost 6 inches to make eveything fit. The 928 engine is VERY long.
I believe the color was aubergine, it has 914/6 GT fender flares. 


Dennis called me two days prior to the 1990 Parade Concours asking if he 
could show it. As the chairman, I couldn't resist, I'd heard of the
project and wanted to see it. We made room in the exhibition class.
There was a BIG crowd around the car. The Porsche entourage stopped for
a considerable time. My german was rusty, but I heard the remark "We
could have killed the Lancia rally team with that." What I learned was 
Dennis had barely completed the car before driving up from Los Angeles.
He drove it straight to the concours site!

Yes one exists. It's fast and makes a great sound.

Subject:       928 Ventilation

Having just joined this group I find the topics interesting & 
informative but note the lack of discussion on the 928.
Living in New Zealand with relatively few Porsches seems a different 
world from USA or GB presumably where the majority of "porschephiles" 
mail sources from.

With summer just starting I felt it was time to address the problem I 
have of the fan (interior) and probably the air conditioning not 
working.However I have had the 928 at the auto electrician today only 
to be told that he cant find any obvious cause.

Symptoms- Having just come thru winter I cannot be sure exactly when 
the fan/air stopped but first noticed about a month ago.I checked the 
fuses and unfortunately it wasnt that simple. The fan does work when 
you slide the controll to demist but not when you turn the dial.I 
only presume the air doesnt work ?.About a week ago it suddenly 
started working (& the air) but just as suddenly stopped.
The small fan that runs all the time still works.

It also doesnt help that the bookshop has had the workshop manual on 
order for two months & I therefore dont have a wiring diagram.

Has anyone else had a similar problem?.

Any suggestions would be gratefully recieved.

Subject: Broken Generator Hub


Some time ago, there was a discussion concerning how to remove a  36mm
generator nut to R&R the fan from a 356/912. It was suggested  that using an
impact wrench  on the nut as opposed to holding the Generator Hub in a vice
(or with vice grips) might be a Better Idea, as shearing off the key or
ruining the keyway might not be a good idea.
   Last week a Customer  sent me the remains of just such an attempt- holding
the hub in a vice, he attempted to remove the 36mm nut on the fan.
   Result: one BROKEN generator hub, AND one sheared-off key, AND one
elongated keyway in the generator shaft which meant: a ruined generator
shaft! Which meant a ruined generator!
   The rather impressively abused parts are now on display in the collection
of broken Porsche parts  Section in the Maestro's Museum. (Call (408)
727-1864 for an appointment.)
    Sometimes the Porsche gods send you examples of how not to do things, so
that you may learn from the mistakes and Kindness of Strangers.

Yes, you must own or co-own a Porsche. "Own" is pretty loosely defined
so that leases, etc. also count. So it's common to assume that "co-own"
is also similarly loosely defined... I have a friend that wanted to join 
PCA, mainly to have access to Pano to help him with the search for a
late factory Turbo Look cab. No VIN number, no joinee. So he made a deal
with another friend of mine to buy oh say the ashtray in his 930 for $5. 
Makes him a co-owner, right? Uses VIN number of said co-owned car, joins 
PCA. Buys the car of his dreams about 9 months later after some serious
hard looking....

Thank you for the real life sanity check. If Goodyear is not using nitogen,
then there is no advantage!!  As far as the rubber oxidizing is concerned,
there is no way to keep air away from the outside of the tire, so who cares

Recently I asked about K&N fileter for my 930 - general opinion was go for it 
but dont expect anything fantastic. Well went for it and fitted the new filter
 - on my 930 with air-con this only involves the removal of the inter-cooler, 
moving the air-con compressor and then taking off the airbox an easy 45 mins.
Well nothing startling - 930 already very fast - BUT my wife thinks its quieter (me too) and its a little smoother at the bottom - less hesitent before boost
really  comes on - maybe that was caused by the oiled old filter? So I am
pleased with the results (whether its real or imaginary) and thanks for the 
advice.


On a the fiche manuals. Got a scraped viewer from the company - rebuilt it and
its fine. Manuals from Stoddard in the US - $35 form 911 , $10 for 930 extras.
Look good to me except they are for the US cars as expected but since most bits
are the same should be no problems BUT why didnt I get the parts fiche at the

Well, I'll let ya know.... :-(.  I sprung for the warrantee ($590) when I

it's about 8-10 hours labor to replace the oil seals and bearings.  My
warrantee will pay for itself *if* they cover the job under warrantee, track
use voids the warrantee.  Hopefully they won't notice the 5-point belts... :-)

Perhaps the easiest way to get a large amount of gas from your 924 tank is
to remove the fuel gauge sender and siphon it out the top.

The fuel gauge sender is located in the luggage compartment, under the
carpet and a glass fiber protector.  It is held in place by 5 or 6 allen
bolts. After removing the bolts, lift the sender slowly, while the gas
drains from it.  A half-inch (ID) hose will drain about half a gallon per
minute.

I would stay away from using the fuel pump to drain the tank, if only
because it works at 75 psi...

p.s. make sure you have ample cans for the gas before you start the process.
Also, make sure that you do this in a well ventilated area, free from
sparks, etc.  (Liability disclaimers apply...)

JCWhitney has a spring-loaded extensible measuring stick that makes it easier
to get the "within a few millimeters" accuracy you need to set your own toe-in.
You set it between the two inside sidewalls, at axle height in front, and it
can stay right there while you roll forward one half rotation.  There are
scribed lines on the stick, so you are comparing distances of just a few centi-
meters rather than several feet across the track of the car.

Looking at the wiring diagram for the 84 928S, I was amazed to find that
the instrument cluster has a light labelled "Trailer Turn Signal". The
wires seem to go nowhere past the connector, but clearly someone had plans
for that big V-8 to move something more than the sylphlike 3300 pounds
of the car itself. Match that, you puny air-coolers!

I hate to keep sayin this *BUT*: there's no such thing as a good
used CIS injection part. You can only use them if they came directly
off a running car and go directly on YOUR car, no shelf time in between,
or if they've been through a Bosch rebuild program. 

I can certainly understand wanting to save a buck or three on this stuff,
but you'll pay more in the long run because you'll *STILL* have to replace
the part with a new one.

Terry Williams inquires about a heat exchanger on one side, headers on the

if the headers in the heat exchanger are designed identically to the naked
headers.  Have to make sure the air ducting to the no-exchanger side is sealed

My '84 doesn't have a small fan that runs all the time - are you sure yours

little about electric things should be able to check it out with an

Hi,

I used an electrical heat gun (max 600 deg. C) to remove paint from my '58 
model 356. It was *very* easy compare to the traditional method. In 3-4 
hours I managed to get half the car down to the original paint, I think it

Now it is half red, half white and I can recommend this method.

Do you store your 930 in the winter months? (Sorry, I don't know where you

to be replaced.  He gives the turbos a life of 10,000 to 30,000 miles.  Have
you had trouble with your turbo and what is the going rate for turbo
replacement?  I would like to learn storing techniques from 930 owners and
how they avoid the "smoking turbo" upon start up in the spring which
Anderson describes.  Bruce says that these cars should be driven regularly,
but I live in the northeast where the winter (snow and salt) dictates car
storage.

I have just traded my trusty '81 SC for an '87 930.

What I was looking for was an explanation, based on wiring, of how this

Egads, my '84 944 has just started doing this!  Very embarrassing! ;-)

My first thought was pressure build up in the cooling system, but

It just occured to me that it could be a vacuum leak. There is a
vacuum tank near the vent fan under the hood.  The ventilation
system uses this vacuum source for operating the dampers
via diaphram actuators. I wonder if one of these devices
could be leaking.  I only notice it after the car has been shut

Anyone have any ideas?

Since the car was oversteering a bit I want to try just the stiffer front bar
first.

Too, bad - like most things in life, you get out of the club whatever you're

Well, it all depends on the region. Some are just plain fun and full of 
damned nice people; some are kinda fun with some damned nice people and a
few jerks, and some are mostly jerks. Sorry your experience has been with
a mostly jerks region.

But it's kind of like this list: for every Kevin Gross or three, there's also

Not to disparage Roundel, which is *NOT* as nice as Pano or The Star, BTW, 
but did Satch ever beat those sexual misconduct with a minor charges or
is he just speculating about BMWs from inside the Big House?

In a more personal vein, I'll do things with the local BMW clubs (2 and 4
wheel) and the SCCA (*NOT* autox though), but not with the local PCA region.
The BMW guys are a blast, and they're sooooo slow on the autox courses 8{)

I have an 89 turboS that has the stock 28mm front and 18mm rear. the car is
used mainly for track events and the PCA race series. The car is, in fact,
bone stock and is competitive. However I was given some photo's of the car/me
in action and noticed that I was really leaning in some of the faster
sweeping turns. 
I have purchased the 30mm front bar (factory race item) and also a
Weltmeister rear bar (22mm). I have installed the front bar but not the rear.
Since the car was oversteering a bit I want to try just the stiffer front bar
first. 
This Friday going to Summit for the acid test. Give me a holler and I'll let
you know how I made out.
Yes the stock bars might be available. (they are much more rigid than normal
951 bars)

Hi,
     
I used an electrical heat gun (max 600 deg. C) to remove paint from my '58 
model 356. It was *very* easy compare to the traditional method. In 3-4 
hours I managed to get half the car down to the original paint, I think it 
had 4 layers of paint over that one. 
     
Now it is half red, half white and I can recommend this method.
     
Anyone else have experience with Electrical Heat guns for this task?

I dunno... there's nothing more rewarding to drive in the snow than
a well setup 911. Well, OK -- *maybe* a C4, but I haven't driven a

Well, it all depends on the region. Some are just plain fun and full of 
damned nice people; some are kinda fun with some damned nice people and a
few jerks, and some are mostly jerks. Sorry your experience has been with
a mostly jerks region.

But it's kind of like this list: for every Kevin Gross or three, there's also

At issue is whether they show up in sufficient numbers to spoil the fun.

Not to disparage Roundel, which is *NOT* as nice as Pano or The Star, BTW, 
but did Satch ever beat those sexual misconduct with a minor charges or
is he just speculating about BMWs from inside the Big House?

In a more personal vein, I'll do things with the local BMW clubs (2 and 4
wheel) and the SCCA (*NOT* autox though), but not with the local PCA region.
The BMW guys are a blast, and they're sooooo slow on the autox courses 8{)

Subject: Weber carb. questions

Hi,

This past week I received the Fall/ winter catalogue from Performance
Products. I was browsing through it and saw a section on Weber carbs which
got me thinking about tuning them myself.
Now I have a couple of questions.

1 Perf. Products sells two books on Weber carbs, one from Haynes and another
from HPBooks.  Which is the better book? Or is their another one  that
someone would recommend? 

2. Besides a synchrometer and a float level are there any other tools that I
should buy? 

3.  I am sure that the books will explain it, but how do I use a synchrometer
when I have tubes (they look like torque boosters as seen in the Automotion
cat.) sticking out of the velocity stacks. Can they be pulled out and do they
really help?

4. What size jets should I use. I have a 73 911S and currently have 40 idle
jets and 140 main jets. I feel that the car is running a little rich as their
is a slight smell of gas in the exhaust. Is there a formula for selecting the
idle and main jets? If so, what would be appropriate for my car in weather
conditions such as Miami, FL (Temp 85F, Humidity 75%) and where should I buy
them if they need to be changed?

5. Lastly, how difficult is it to rebuild webers. I have seen kits advertised
in Pano and was wondering if it was a job for pros or any mechanically
inclined person.

Hey,

Just returned from the Alabama Region's PCA driver's ed event (Sunday).  Good
turn-out, considering the *large* amount of rain we drove in all day.  Fellow
pfile Darren Evans-Young was also there in his 944S.

Quite a few off-track excursions (agricultural racing) due to the wet
conditions.  Luckily, I stayed on the pavement.  One of the highlights of the
day was one of the club member's 935 doing a few laps.  Incredible
car.  Quite a few nice cars in attendance, actually.  There was an early
911 race car - could have been an RS but it was raining too hard to go get a
closer look.

Watching a lot of racing on TV, I've heard that "when someone in front of you
spins, aim right for them, because when you get there, they will be gone".
 Well this is true.  A 928 spun right in front of me and the idea of aiming
right for it crossed my mind.  I decided not try anything fancy and just
slowed down.  Sure enough, here he comes back across the track!!  Luckily I
was going slow enough at this point to simply drive around him on the
outside.  

To reiterate some recent posts, join the PCA and get involved in
auto-x/driver's schools/etc!!!

Subject:  Alignment adventures and Turbo tie-rods (long)

After asking several questions, I finally have a story/experience to relate
with my fellow Porschephiles. I would have asked everyone for advice on
changing tie rods but time constraints and mail problems limited me to local
knowledge and a poorly written magazine article. Well here goes. Sorry it's
so long.

About two weeks ago I went to get my car ('73 911S)  aligned at my  LOCAL
Goodyear store (let me emphasize local because I'm sure other Goodyear stores
are more competent). After 45 minutes the mechanic told me that my car was
ready. I got ready to pay when I asked for the printout of the alignment
specs. They went to get it and upon receipt I noticed that they had done
nothing to the rear suspension and had not adjusted the camber of the front
suspension.  The manager then put the car back on the lift and talked it over
with his mechanics. After about 20 minutes of looking at the car and
comparing the car with the Hunter display, they decided not to risk messing
up the car any further and said that I should go elsewhere.  No charge.

Then I went to NTW and found a somebody who use to do all the alignment work
for the local Porsche dealership. Well, he put the car on the lift and
checked it out. After 10 minutes he called me out back and showed me how my
tie rod ends were slightly loose and that he couldn't guarantee that he could
align the toe within spec. So I decided to buy Turbo tie rods at Vertex for
 $120 w/tax. Especially since I was going to drivers' Ed at Sebring two days
later.

A nightmare ensued.  The change seemed fairly straight forward. Unscrew
everything and install new piece. The hard part was removing the passenger
side tie rod end from the spindle. It took me about two hours  using a
hammer, crowbar, WD-40.... everything but a tie rod end puller or a pickle
fork. Then magically it popped off. Then unscrewing the tie rod from the
steering rack was also a pain in my ***. The rest of the passenger side went
pretty quickly, relatively speaking. On the driver's side I expected an
equally hard time with the tie rod end and was wondering if I was ever going
to get it off. Fortunately I was wrong. It came off after 3 minutes.  I then
decided to take the end apart and noticed that the ball joint was completely
rusted and didn't have a trace of grease in it. I had more trouble getting
the rod off the steering rack but after several hours the novice home
mechanic had everything back together. Total time: no comment.

I went back to a different NTW  (the original mechanic who pointed out my
problem had the day off so he recommended somebody else. I would have waited
for him but I was off to Sebring the next day and couldn't wait.) and had my
car aligned as closely as possible to spec.  I think the rear toe wasn't in
spec, but the mechanic said that the total toe was well in spec.  Everything
was now completely finished. 

When I first got the car I was a little disappointed that it handled so
poorly compared to my mother's 1987 turbo-look targa, but I just attributed
it to a huge difference between a 8 year old turbo-bodied 911 with a 22 year
old  911 with only 205/60 15 all-around. The car now handles like a dream, it
no longer wanders all over the highway and there is less body roll when
turning (probably because the tires are both pointing in the same directions
at all times). All that for $120. A cheap fix for a Porsche. I was sure that
I needed new shocks and bigger sway bars. For the time being I am so pleased
with the improvement that I think the rest can wait a little longer.

Scott Winders came back hard when Rick Dill tried to correct him

Calm Down Scott! He wasn't talking about your mother (unless you are a son

He is actually CORRECT. Air compressors do spew out lots of water, due
to it getting compressed out of the air. That is why we use AIR DRYERS
when compressed air needs to be used to paint cars or operate machinery.
They are almost never used at garages. And this liquid H2O WILL at least
partly turn to water vapor when the tires heat up, which WILL
raise the pressure in the tires more (did you ever see a pressure cooker?
Did you ever see water vapor rise from the ground outside although the
air is less than 212 degrees?) And the rusting principle can not be
argued with. Your Ivy-league experts were not asked the questions
correctly, so they didn't answer correctly.

My '83 didn't either until I took it apart and cleaned it. The dash mounted

European Car too since the Porsche articles are getting fewer and fewer.  I 
just might finally cancel it this time since I just subscribed to the 
Christophorus.  Per someone's suggestion on this p-philies list, I inquired 
about the Christophorus and received a sample magazine which sold me.  At 
least every magazine will have something about Porsches, which seems like 
European Car is getting away from.

Subject: Futzing with CIS

I've decided it's time to get my hands dirty with my 911SC. Since the
fuel injection has been giving me the most problems, it will be my first
"victim." :-) 

Where's the best place to get started? I already have the factory manuals,
but are there any Bosch CIS specific books applicable to my car? Any old
articles in Pano or Excellence I should find? What kind of investment
in tools and gauges am I looking at? Should I even try?

Drew,

Does the RS America have different mounting than the C2/C4?  I notice in the 
Perfomance Products catalog that they have different H&R springs for the RS 
America than the C2/C4.  I thought the difference for the 2 cars were that the 
spring diameter from factory was slightly thicker for the RS America.  That 
shouldn't justify different H&R springs for the RS vs. the C2/C4.  

BTW, I heard from Performance Products that the main difference was that the 
Eibach's were fixed rate spring vs. the progressive rate springs for the H&R. 
 Maybe that's true for all Eibach springs.

Subject: 944 Vibration

I have had an engine vibration problem for the last 3 years with my 83 944.
My vibration seems to be most prevalent while accelerating from about 2800 to
3600.  I am unsure as to whether it is driveline induced or strictly an engine
thing.  I did re-alighn my balance shafts once and obtained some reduction.[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Dreset my balance shafts once and saw some improvement.  This 
suggests to me that balance shaft error would manifest itself in such a manner.
However to throw a wrench into the works, when driving over smooth pavement the
phenomena does not seem to occur.  Who knows?  Other possible things to think
about, driveshaft and clutch assembly both move at engine speed and both are
subject to load changes during acceleration.  My 944 is tres low, so I know I
have excessive rear negitive camber and possibly toe in.  Does this situation
sound familiar to anyone?  Any comments?

I have a heat gun but I haven't tried it on paint.....yet.  I'll give it a 
shot.

For those of you who don't have a heat gun or know somebody with one, perhaps 
you have (or can borrow) a small 4" grinder with a wire cup.  This'll strip 
layers of paint and bondo *WITHOUT* scratching up the surface like a sanding 
disc or putty knife.  It leaves the metal nice and smooth.

I stripped both sides of my 914 using this method.  The only problem areas 
are the nooks and crannies around the inner rockers, etc where the wire cup 
won't reach.  Perhaps this is where the heat gun would work well....

Wayne,
  From your message it was not clear to me if the fan was running or was it 
not blowing air..
The way the dial works: when you wheel it around to the blue section..it 
trips a vacuum soleniod and opens the upper duct work, the rubber hoses that 
are used in the vacuum lines will dry rot over time and loss of vacuum will 
occur..You can check this by removing the Glove Box and locating the vacuum 
lines and a lever/arm that
opens the upper ducts..rotate that arm open and seal of the opening to the 
soleniod.
A small piece of rubber hose with a larger nail in it works fine..Fresh Cool 
Air should
breeze through the vents..
 If the Fan doens't work at all, disregard all of the above...and check the 
A/C relay
the Chiltons Manual for the 928 has some pretty easy to follow wiring 
diagrams..

1) Put the top up and get it over 90 mph (on a track, of course).  It's not
scary at all...

2) Yes it has been done.  

3) Yes it was expensive.

4) As I recall, it was a Toronto shop that did it.  Claimed 350+ bhp.  Never
did identify the owner, for reasons of privacy.  I read about it in
Excellence (another of my Porsche junkie fixes...)

5) Cost prohibitive?  How much money do you have?  Nothing is cost

I'm with Stan on this one.  My basic tenet is that I'm gonna be dead
in 40 years or so, and have absolutely no plans to spend half that
time driving second-tier cars.  The funeral home doesn't give discounts
to people with concours-condition cars.

I drove my car *every* day in last year's winter, which was pretty
snowy here in New England.  It was the first year on Pirelli 190's,
which were very good and would have been even better had they not been
225 and 205 sizes.  (They came off a car which was bought and then sold
to someone who didn't want 'em.  The price was right.)  I dream of a
nice set of Hakka's -- hoo hee!

This stuff about "Porsches (sports cars) don't handle in the snow" is
absolute horseshit.  You put the right tires on, and you take the
camber down to a reasonable number (like factory numbers), and you
are then all set.

Like the old beer commercial said, you only go around once, so grab
all the gusto you can!

Adding more to my prior post, I discovered the source of the "noise."
It is coming from my radiator (overflow tank) cap. Before I rush out and
buy a new one, I want to ask the collective wisdom of the list if it is
normal for a waterpumper's coolant cap to wear out and not hold
its pressure as it is intended?

 Hi all, 
 
         I have a few questions regarding the '84 944 I bought 2 weeks 
back. This is my first Porsche and I haven't fully got used to it, so 
if my questions are stupid, please excuse me. 
 
     o   The brake pad wear indicator comes on erratically. Sometimes 
         it stays on after starting, sometimes it comes on while driv- 
         ing, and sometimes it does not come on at all. The mechanic 
         (Porsche mechanic) I had taken the car to before buying said  
         there was 50-70 % pad remaining. Also slight pressure on the  
         brake pedal while rolling to a stop makes a scratching sound  
         from the rear (especially when cold). 
 
     o   Yesterday I noticed a whining sound from the back of the car 
         just after starting the engine. It sounded like a motor but 
         I hadn't activated any (antenna, lights, hatch, windows etc). 
         The sound continued for about 5 seconds, stopped and reoccured 
         after about 10 seconds and so on for about 5 minutes after 
         which it disappeared completly. 
 
     o   The radio (Blaupunkt tuskan) reception is not very good. The 
         sound fades and there is some static even with the antenna 
         out. 
 
Any help will be greatly appreciated. 
 
Thanks,

I had this problem on my '79 928 but the problem was with the fuse; not that
it was blown, it was fine.  The contacts, however, were corroded.  A little
WD-40 and all is well.  And it affected my AC too.  Can't remember which fuse it
was but it's in the owner's manual.

Well, it's obvious to me that the lack of discussion means that "OUR" cars
are MUCH better designed than those pesky little air-cooled things.  Not
only that, but we can haul Benz's with our cars too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pete,

Wasn't Audi duty that rich texan who ran for president in the last election,
until a gang of murderous cubans driving yugos with helium filled tires on
explosive forged aluminum wheels threatened to kidnap his daughter (or at
least ruin her wedding), thus forcing him to retire?

Whatever.  High-end late model Quattros use Torsen (TORque SENsing) center
differentials while earlier models use (lockable) mechanical differentials. 
My Syncro is the Audi 4000 series quattro system (and I believe, the same
as the Ur-Quattro and all other pre-torsen models).  The center and rear
differentials can be manually locked by the driver, on the fly.  No
clutches are used in either system, to the best of my (limited) knowledge.

Ok, I'm going, I'm going... Stop pushing!

I like the H&R's myself, but have not had any experiences with Eibach.  From
feedback that I've had from people to use Eibach, I've not had anyone say 

they don't like them.  Some people have opinions regarding progressive rate
vs. fixed rate springs, but it appears to be a matter of personal preference.
I don't think you can go wrong with either H&R or Eibach, as both appear to 

have good reputations for producing quality products.  The only caveat I've
heard regarding Eibach was the early springs for the 964's required some 

modification of the spring perches on the factory struts due to their 

different diameter.  Andial also sells a spring set for the 964 that is
apparently built by Eibach that the RS America drivers around here seem
to universally hate due to the spring rates, though they're probably 

setup to be installed as a set with Andial's Cup suspension struts.

The motor has nothing to do with raising the hatchback. It is raised by the 
rear hatch shocks, which probably need replacing. Th shocks should push the 
hatch up quite quicky on release, If yours don't do that one or both are 
probably kaput. The good news is they are easy to replace.  If they seem 
O.K. it could just be that one or both latches is out of alignment and the 
locating pins are catching on the latch. They too are easy to adjust (two 
nuts) I did mine by inserting the key in the lock with a vice grip attached 
to the key fob (so it stayed over in the release position)  then I loosened 
the offending latch and moved it until the hatch sprang up and   - Voila!

A careful retightening of the nuts while holding the latch in position and 
no problems since.

else the wrong way, quite by accident.

Couple of suggestions.  There are over 30,000 PCA'ers, they're not all
jerks, and most of them are pretty darn nice.  I think Bill Buff once
made a comment about people who spend too much time sitting in cars
being not all there -- probably explains some of our aberrances!

Most regions seem to have a core of folks who, year after year, do an
awful lot for their members.  The downside to this is that sometimes
it gets a little cliquey, or the region's overt style reflects the
interests of that core.  For example, some regions get tagged "a track
region" because their officers and other core folks favour that
activity.

I don't think there is any volunteer organization which doesn't have
this problem.  Rest assured that there are a ton of people in PCA
with the same car as you and probably the same interests and expect-
ations.

I don't know who the original poster was, but if s/he's in Zone 1,
drop me a line and I will put you in touch with guaranteed non-jerk
PCA people.  Who spend too much time sitting in their cars.

WRT requiring a VIN, this is a subject which has been debated at
the National level in the past.  I think the dominant sentiment has
been that this is a Porsche club, for people who have Porsches,
because that's the kind of club most members want to have.  I happen
to agree.  Owning a Porsche isn't prohibitively expensive, they are
not rare cars.  My feeling is that any club has the right to define
the terms and conditions of membership -- to define itself.

If you disagree, that's cool.  Go start your own Porsche club or join
another one that exists without the ownership requirement.  Or join
SCCA.  Or subscribe to Excellence, Automobile, and SCI, which give
better coverage to Porsches than Pano does anyway.

(I think Pano has become little more than a US version of Christophorus
in many respects, and with all due respect to Betty Jo, Leonard, Bill O,
and the rest of the crew.  It pisses me off that Bruce gets fewer an
fewer column inches every year, that the new model coverage cannot
find anything less than perfect about each car, etc., etc.  Why aren't
Jim Pasha's wonderful articles in Pano?)

Subject: smoke, 993, and trafic school

Hello all,
  Well to say the least me and my 914 Kelli had a rather interesting RWe
weekend down in FL. I had to go down to Jacksonville from Charleston
SC to attend traffic school. FL has a cool deal that if you got to
traffic school they forget about the ticket. Considering I belong
to an elite group that get to swim in that high risk pool I didn't
need another ticket on my record. On the rather lame drive down I
get to pass by a rather nice 993. Of course I saw the guy laugh as
I drove by in my rather beat-up, but well loved, 914 which shows
the battle scars of a high risk owner. On the way home some rather
scarry/lucky things happened. When Kelli travels for over an hour at
higher speeds, like 80 or so, she really starts to smoke like a big
dog when A) the gas is bliped but not at a steady position. B) when
slowing down and the engine is under compression. I can hear what
sounds to me like a heavy valve click when the car is under load.
About an hour outside of JAX some little pontiac (the F car) passed
me and of couse I had to follow the faster car. Well he kept going
faster and faster the next thing I know is that he is leaveing me.
I looked down and I was stuck at 100. (yes I know I am crazy) I
know that Kelli can go faster than that. Then with my foot still on
the floor, she started to slow down. 95...90...85...80 at this point
I was waiting to feel a fly wheel hit me in the back. All I could
think was "she's going to blow captain". Well I slowed her down to 60
and half gassed her back up. She was ok after that. A little later
two cars passed at about 90 and I inclined to jump in the line. After
a mile or so I thought I better just take it easy on the way home
just to make sure I made it home. About two more miles up the road
ol' mister blue lights pulled onto the road on pulled those two other
guys off the road. After a little word of thanks for keeping
me out of that little mess I moved on to the rest I-95 north.

Hi Eliot,

I think you miss the point.  Porsche had an elaborate, computer-controlled,
all mechanical AWD on the original C-4, in which it was all but impossible
in induce oversteer. Porsche replaced it with the new system for two
reasons. The new system is half the weight of the old one, and the new
system allows more driver controll (it allows the driver to induce
oversteer).

Many folks who *don't* own 911s find the prospect of its propensity to
"hang the tail" out in the breeze, something to be feared.

911 pilots, OTOH, generally *love* oversteer, and consider the
significantly higher level of driver's expertise required to master the
challange of taming the 911, a significant part of its charm.  BMW may
claims it produces "the Ultimate drivING machine,"  911 owners know who
produces the ultimate *DriveR's* machine.  And, FWIW, who would argue that,
in a pure sports car like the 911, a much lighter and simpler system is
*Less* elegant...?

OK, I'll go quietly now...

No, these lines do not become brittle with age......mine are 22 years old

but that's from the heat in the engine compartment (probably).  Don't worry
about them, because the fuel pressure isn't enough to blow them.  However,
I've made it a habit (honestly!) to replace all of the rubber fuel lines in

I belong to PCA and agree with the sentiments you expressed above, but the
mysterious MQL makes a valid observation.

Years ago (1963-65) when I was an Army swine living in the hallowed Air
Farce Headquarters city of Wiesbaden, there was a large contingent of
Porsche clubbers (and I'm *pretty* sure it was a branch of PCA) in my BOQ,
the American (OPEN) Arms Hotel.  They were, to a man (and woman), a bunch
of insufferably obnoxious boors, manifesting exactly the attitude expressed
by the mysterious MQL.

There's nothing wrong with "clubiness" in the closed environs of a club.
However, the same "Clubiness" manifested in the genreal public, among folks
not privy to the club, is usually translated by the outsiders as
snobbishness.

I've been delighted find the Porschephiles refreshingly free from this
crap, but I have found the attitude wide-spread; with the unfortunate
result that all Porsche owners get tarred with that brush.  It's no joke,
and all of us need to be aware of the fact that the perception is both
widespread and, to an unfortunate degree, well deserved.

I saw H1s in Performance Products catalog, but they had an ugly chrome

Do they mount inside the factory (body-colored) headlight ring, or do
they have a chrome ring around them?

Personal tastes differ. For me tires "glued" to the ground is the max  
and rain is ok - I don't have any problem with it. But I just feel  
that any tire on ice is like slicks in the rain. Serious slipping and  
sliding if spirited driving attempted.

And it is good to be deprived of your Porsche occasionally. The

	If you are speaking of the plastic fuel lines in the engine 
	compartment, supply and return, I found them to get brittle,
	and replaced mine, just a few years after new!
	I had replaced an injector, 'cause the attached rubber line
	ruptured just as I turned off engine upon returning from a
	long weekend trip, (no fire!) in messing around I decided to
	investigate the other lines, and upon tightening a hose clamp
	shattered the plastic supply line!
	I promptly replaced both the supply and return with copper tubing.
	There were lots of engine fires in the early days, after they're
	burnt it's hard to decide which was the culprit that failed!

Subject: 928 Ventilation

Wayne Fowke writes about his '85 928 whose ventilator fan runs only when the
lower slider is set to defrost, or when set to low. (As John White points out,
at least on the American cars, the fan is never off unless the slider is all the
way to the left.  The rotary switch selects one of four non-zero fan speeds.)  I
also agree with John's diagnosis: given the description it almost *has* to be
the rotary switch or wiring/plug thereto.

I haven't had this particular problem with my '86 928, but I have removed,
disassembled and tested the control switch.  It's suprisingly easy (by 928
standards), and is thoroughly covered in the manual (removal Vol IV p. 87-44).
Basically, you pry/pull the central vent straight out, remove an "H" shaped
plastic bezel from around the switch with gentle prying starting at the top, and
remove the switch by removing a four philips-head screws at all four corners.
The switch plugs into two harnesses, one for the blower and one for the "flaps".

The shop manual provides a step-by-step procedure for diagnosing the whole
switch/slider assembly (p. 87-105:87-114).  In addition, the switch assembly
itself can be disassembled by careful unscrewing and prying, but that's not
covered in the manual.

It really helps to have a shop manual.  Wayne: have you considered ordering one
direct from a Porsche parts supplier in the US?  They're readily available for
about US$270-300.

If you can't solve the problem that way, e-mail me your address and I'll send
you some copies of the relevant pages.

Subject: Metal Shavings = Dying Autotranny BS | !BS ??

Took the 924S ('87, 28000 miles) to Black Forest Independent Porsche
service here in Atlanta for some minor stuff, and also asked thenm 
to look at the rear end.

The rear end has been leaking diff. fluid (black, thick oil). RUSNAK 
Porsche in CA had told me to (i) check the level every few months
and (ii) that to reseal it was $500 in labor, but wasn't really 
necessary.

Anyway, Black Forest claimed the following:

(i) There are metal shavings in the fluid (at? i think).
    There are also signs of beginning intermix btwn diff and at.
(ii) its going to need a new transmission soon
(iii) they cost $3K installed. for a new one from Porsche installed by them.
(iv) this won't really fix it because the audi transmission is not
up to the power the engine puts out. The new one might not last 30K either.

[ theyalso looked at the sunroof. they told me it needed gears and 
would cost $200 to fix, but thought I might not want them too given 
the rear end. they were right. ]  

Now, if its true then I should sell the car before it gets too bad to sell.

If its not true I should take my service business elsewhere.

A friend told me of a sting he saw on TV. A tow truck would tell motor home
tourists that they were smoking and pull them over. An inspection would reveal
metal shavings in the transmission , which were actually planted there. The
local garage could fix it for about $1500-2000, for which they changed the fluid
and cleaned the unit so that it looked brand new (the unit was not replaced).
In addition this friend seemed to believe that metal shavings were normal
in a auto. transmission and thats why you changed the fluid and strainer.

First, I need to ascertain the seriousness of the situation. Since the car
seems to drive ok, I am not that concerned. Since I don't  drive it to 
work, its not such a big deal. The problem is that I am incessantly 
curious about what is going on.

Subject: BMW Shop Problems (Conclusion?)

Hi,

	Well, we had the meeting today with the shop owners about the problem
with the crappy repair work on her 530i.

	The first thing we did was take the car to Neillo BMW here in Sacramento
and have them do an eval of the car.  They said the car definitely 
does _not_ have head problems, but was mal-adjusted.  The timing was way off,
and it was way too lean.  The only thing set right was the dwell, and guess
who did that? :)

	So, we all sat down in the shop's back room, and first off let me say it
was a little distracting, with 911 engines all over the place in varying
states of dismemberment and all kinds 911 parts scattered everywhere!
	
	So we're sitting there staring at each other, so I start with a 
description of the problem and what we wanted done about it, Amy adds her
dissatisfaction with being left out of the loop even though its her car,
and she was paying for the repairs.  They apologized profusely for this!

	We played good cop/bad cop.  I got to be the bad cop!  My position was
that we didn't want to pay anything!  She was willing to work with them.
Their first tactic was to make me look like an idiot my throwing a heap
of technical-speak my way, which I completely and effectively deflected
with firm, well informed responses and a couple of diagrams on some 
scrap paper.

	The mechanic tried to work the customer service angle, with "I'm 
willing to do whatever it takes to get your car running the way you want"  
to which I countered "you already had three tries!"  He then tried the
philsophical angle that "well, thats purely hindsight"  "Well, so is this
entire discussion..." counters I.

	The shop manager tried the humanistic 'you're being a butt-hole' angle
by saying "You know, I've known you for several years, and I've never seen
this side of you.  You've never acted like this - this isn't the Thom I
know"  To which I replied "Jim, we could be the greatest buddies, but 
when it comes down to the fine print, I'm a _consumer_"  I owe somebody
on the Porsche list for that line!

	So we argued.  Amy gave a very clear dissertation on what she thought
the problem was and how she was mad about being left on the loop _and_
being told 3 times the car ran great when it didn't.                

	Amy was actually the deal maker here.  She told them that she was willing 
to pay for the parts, but none of the labor.  I played bad cop and argued 
that we shouldn't even pay for the parts, since they were replacing
stuff in a clueless grasp at fixing the car!   

	She agreed that: she will pay for the parts at cost.  They will pay for
any repairs that the dealer says need to be made.  She will pay for none of
the labor incurred during the previous work (close to 20 hours @ $55).  To
sweeten the deal, they _gave_ her a new battery for the car!  Done deal!

	Amy would like to extend a big thanks to all who helped during this
ordeal.  We would probably not fared as well without your help!

Thom & Amy

Yipes!  Mine have the ugly chrome ring around them, but the car has chrome
trim all over, so I don't consider it a big deal.  They don't fit inside the
factory ring currently on you car, but you can purchase primered rings to go
over the chrome.  They are fairly expensive -- $121/pr at Perf. Prod.

Good luck,

Mike,
  A friend has had one on his SC for years.  He found a little trailer that
 would hold 4 mounted tires, a tool box, some luggage, and other minor stuff.
 That was his way of attending track events in comfort.  Never a problem.
 Believe he had it installed at one of the U-Haul-It centers.  I checked into
 it last year and they did have them listed.  I ended up getting a DustBuster
 (Pontiac Trans Sport) instead.

Most of us that have raced on progressive springs think they're evil. The
change in transfer depending on how loaded the suspension is at *that*
point in time is a killer. 

*HOWEVER*, it is good for street use -- in fact, I regularly recommend
the Troutman 165 lb progressive springs for street/light autox use on 
stock 914s. Just don't try to get cute with them on the track or you'll

Subject: 914 Recalls

This talk about brittle fuel lines and Pat's comment about 914 battery tray
recalls reminds me of something I found out about in 1990, when I bought my
first 914.

There *WAS* a recall on 914 fuel lines. These are the lines inside the
engine compartment, and it is (was in '90) *STILL IN EFFECT* No kidding.
When I took my car in, they found that my lines had already been corrected,
so I never went all the way through the recall, but the dealer said is was
still in effect, even after fifteen years.

Regarding the Battery Tray: I don't think Porsche ever fixed the actual
tray. What they would do is install a rubber cover over the top of the
battery so that water could not wash over it and down onto the tray and
suspension console. I don't know if that recall is still active.

Hello 'philes,

A friend of mine is considering buying an electronic arc welding helmet.  It

I can't remember how long it takes to darken, but after repeated use,

On rebuilding Webbers:

If you have leaky carbs, or the accel pump is not working, or the float
bowl valve are not operating, rebulding webbers is not difficult.  Much
easire than an american-type carb.

If you have loose throttle shafts, leaky plates, it's a whole differnet
matter.  The PMO kit is complete but compes with almost no
instruction.  You'll neet to learn how to set up the idle adjusters.

On jetting Webbers: good luck!  If you have a jet box handy, you can
find a nice place to do accelleration runs and dial them in.  That's
what I did.  As for getting anyone to tell you certain jets are good
for a certain car, hopefully someone will be able to assist.


Regarding the "torque boosters" the UniSyn which PMO sells fits in the velocity stack over this without fussing.

Here's a question for anyone on the net:

	What's the difference between a 40 and a 46MM webber?
	(Be specific - where EXACTLY does the differnce lie?)

Not sure. I assume you have the so-called boost venturis (a misnomer). 
The Haynes illustrations show those only on the 46IDA's. You sure can't

Thak -

The P65 stands for "with sunroof" on the 911 Turbo's and the 018 stands 
for "steering wheel with raised hub" on all models.  Haven't been able to 
fund out what the "C02" stand for though.  I think it has something to do 
with the general configuration of the car for different areas(?), but 
don't hold me to it.  My 944 has a "C03" and I think I was told it had to 
do with the California type car.  I will check further.

Yeah, the fuel pressure gauge is great!

However, these symptoms can also occur with a working WUR and a bad cold 
start valve.  By the way, the cold start valve is operational if the temp
goes 
below 60 deg F, not exactly "very cold weather." 

If the cold start valve injector is worn, it will dribble fuel instead of 
spraying it and will make the car hard to start.

You have to remove it to check; the spray pattern should be like any other 
fuel injector.

The bad news is that (if a '76 is like an '80) the cold start valve is
*really*
a pain to get to: it's behind (forward of in car coords) the throttle body.

Hi, Murray...

Well, don't feel too bad.  My 83 944 is what got me started in all of this
(PCA, track events, business...) a few years back.  Your 83 is a couple of
hundred pounds lighter than a lot of 944s, including turbos.

This makes it a better handling car and easier on the brakes and suspension,
etc.

I do currently have an Autothority Chip installed in my 83 944.  I do feel a
noticeable difference in low end torque (I find myself spinning the tires on
hard acceleration in low grip situations more that previously).  The overall 
power increase might be as much as 5 bhp.

That may not sound like much, but every little bit helps.

The best part of the chip is the ability to rev the engine a bit higher.  At
Lime Rock Park, this means that I can take a couple of corners in 3rd gear
with a bit more power available, instead of 4th, because I can complete the
corner without hitting the redline.

So, bottom line, I think that the chip is worth probably $200 in additional 
performance.  I don't think I would spend $495 for that much improvement, but
$200, yeah, OK...

Subject: Re:  928 Ventilation

Yeah, I suspected that that little fan in my car was dead, just haven't
gotten around to burrowing in there to get at it. Guess I had better do
it. Do you have any wisdom about cleaning it up once I have it out (since
I usually do something wrong the first time around, any gotcha's that
you found)?  

I don't have buzzing relays, but I do have a fan that from time to time
turns itself to high for no more than five seconds, then returns to the
speed the knob is set at - as if the defroster were turned on briefly.

My upshift indicator, when it works at all, seems to do what it's
supposed to - comes on around 1800-2000 rpm at light throttle load,
goes off when you get off the throttle entirely (microswitch) or when
you get on it harder (load). Sometimes it just stays out, though, which
makes me a little nervous since it is driven by a function of the same
variables which control the fuel injection. In fact, it is driven by an
output from the same brain, so it is conceivable that a malfunctioning
light is a symptom of a malfunctioning injection control system. Overall,
though, it serves much more as an irritant than as an aid - maybe a bit
of black tape would solve the problem.

Gee, maybe there is some truth to the warnings people have given that
928's are subject to electrical gremlins.

Get the Probst book -- "Bosch Fuel Injectino & Engine Mangement" published
by Robert Bently Books. There's also a moderately decent (notice at no point 
did I say "good") book available from Automotion called "Troubleshooting CIS 
Systems" or some such. The Probst book is The Bible on this stuff, next to 
the factory manuals. The other book is not bad as a mid-tech overview with 
some diagnostic proceedures. Given my background when I waded into CIS, 
and my CIS background when I started fooling with the 911 version, it
was mostly a waste.

You'll need the special adjustment tools, readily available in the
aftermarket. And you'll need a special set of pressure gauge/hoses/fittings/
valve to do most of the tests. Again, Automotion has them,but you can
get the "real" set from Baum Tool for about the same money. Total in
tools here is under $200.

Now, to *REALLY* do things right, you also need access to a chassis
dyno, a engine analyzer, and an exhaust gas and temp analyzer. But
you're probably a ways off from that yet...

As to "should you try", I dunno -- for normal CIS service, the main
issue is figuring out what croaked and replacing it. That's easy to
do without the special tools for the most part. CIS is a nightmare to
performance tune without a huge amount of experience and most of the
things in the "really do things right" paragraph. IF that's your intent,
then no, find someone that knows their stuff and use them. If you're just
looking to better understand things and maybe do a little light repair,
then get the Probst book and consider the gauges and tools later.

Beg to differ. I got to sit out a weekend of time trials and other assorted
fun at Cabaniss Field (ever notice the tendency to want to make that
be "Cannabis Field"? Just wondered...) due to an exploded plastic line in
my 914 2.0 ITA  racer. Since the optional gasoline bath is not an
approved safety item, I decided to fix it right as long as I was at it.
Not to worry, nothing that you can't fix with $200 worth of Aeroquip...

Mind that rear firewall when you go to install bulkhead fittings, though --
it's a 3" thick double wall. Gotta cut a big hole on the inboard side
to let you mount the fittings on the rear wall.  Behind the passenger
seat is the indicated location.

The setup is now Wurth-7-and-9mm-rubber lines to a 3/8" to -06 fitting
for the 9mm and a -04 to -06 fitting for the 7mm line, with -06 female
bulkhead unions fore and aft, and a pile of -06 AQP running through the
passenger compartment. Nice an tidy, all tied down with FAA approved
techniques to prevent hose chafing and everything.. Should never need
to undo the interior piece, and the engine and tank side use regular 
press-on fittings with good German hose clamps...

I *DO* second the motion that you should replace the rubber lines frequently.
Every couple of years or so, less if the car lives outside.

release as I heard described (it unlatches, but the motor doesn't raise the 
hatchback).  I have forgotten what various people have said the problem is, 
so if someone could tell me again, I'd appreciate it.  
Thanks,

Subject: Stupid question

When I drive any manual tranny car, including my 951, and I step on the gas 
when the car is in a higher gear (5th?) and turning low revs (1000rpm?) the 
car shudders and shakes until the revs get higher. I believe that this is 
called lugging, and is particularly noticeable in my other non P-car with a 
lightweight flywheel. Why does this happen and why is it bad? What is the 
solution? aside from downshifting. I believe that my commuting habits of 
holding coffee with one hand, and using the other hand to steer/shift don't 
help. Unfortunately commuting from where I live to where I work entails a 
massive amount of shifting.

Scott Winders winders@porsche.support.apple.com fired back :

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
You obviously did not read any of the information I posted. Water boils
at 212F at sea level. The "steam" you mention is not water turning into
a gas; it is another phenomina that I will not get into here. Under
pressure, waters vapor point is even higher than 212F. Water does not
gardually turn into vapor as it is heated as you sumize. ******

Sure, water does get into compressors. The point was that any minute
amount of water that gets into your tire via a compressed air tank is
not going to be a concern.

The point is that nitrogen does not buy you a thing!!!
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I'm a scientist/engineer and I checked my old chemistry textbook. Old
Dr. Wunderlich at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute must have been pretty good
because I remember exactly what he taught us (he had a GREAT German accent,
and looked like he should be wearing a white jacket in the Porsche lab
hunched over a smoking 356 4-cam engine).

Le Chatelier's principle about equalibrium says that if heat is added to a
system (the tire), the temperature would rise (duh). This would cause a
change in equalibrium which in turn ... would cause more liquid to evaporate,
causing the vapor pressure to increase. 
I quote the textbook : "after the addition of heat the new state of
equilibrium corresponds to increased vapor pressure and temperature. This
prediction (based on Le Ch.) is consistent with the OBSERVED FACT that the
vapor pressure of a liquid increases as the temperature increases". QED.

You hung yourself when you said water does not gradually turn to vapor as it
is heated - this is exactly what happens. Sorry to bore everyone about this
trivia, as it probably doesn't make more than a PSI or two difference, but
being a scientist it kills me to see these errors undisputed. I don't plan on
using nitrogen unless it is commonly available, in which case I surely would
use it.

Jeff Shorey, js@ee.duke.edu, asked :

__________________________________________________
Do you have problems running the 87 octane?  That's what I run in mine with
no
pinging.  If you convert the specified 91 RON into our gas (R/M?) you get
something less than 87.  See Bruce Anderson's book.
__________________________________________________

I re-read Bruce's book. Yes, the 87 octane gas (R+M)/2 meets the European
91 RON octane rating. But I wouldn't use it in any 6 cylinder Porsche engine
if I had the chance to buy Premium unleaded. It's false economy. Our older
engines have deposits which raise the octane requirements. Also our fuel 
systems are difficult to keep exactly correct, they can run lean. You may
think your car is not pinging (knocking) but 911 engines knock at high RPM,
and it is very hard to hear it due to the other noises occuring at those
speeds. The higher octane gas has no disadvantages, and is cheap compared
to anything else you need for a 911.

I always use 93 or 94 octane gas (readily available in the northeast), and
try to mix in some leaded racing gas whenever I can. The lead is nice to the
valve seats, but not really needed. Last month I ran at Lime Rock and
couldn't
get any racing gas before my first run group. I was running on Texaco 93 
octane. The car ran bad at high RPM, I had better power by short-shifting (in
an S!). I put in 50% CAM2 leaded (105 octane?) for the second run group and 
it ran much better. Maybe I had a bad tank of Texaco? I usually run Mobil 93
octane and it usually works fine.

I try to use Texaco regular in my street cars because it has detergents
(other brands of gasoline seem to require premium before they give you
the good additives?). I also like to add Chevron Techron to my gas tank
before an oil change, to remove deposits.

Also, NEVER use gas that has any alcohol as an additive. The govt is trying
to push it down our filler caps but WE MUST RESIST! It really SUCKS
basically.

Any other comments are appreciated, these are just my real-life observations
with a real Porsche.

Yep, the thinking behind the mandatory Porsche ownership escapes me.
If you're thinking about owning, you should read as much as you can about
the marque before you purchase. Pano has a lot of good info, and
the classified ads can help you find out what you can afford.

Now of course I've NEVER done this, but if you just need a VIN number
pick up a copy of Excellence magazine. (Another indispensable mag.)
Flick to the back. Notice all the ads, many with VIN numbers. Change the
last digit of a posted VIN number. Voila! Welcome to the club.

When you really buy your Porsche, just send a letter to PCA with the new
info.

I can't see any harm to this, since PCA will not exclude you if you have a
duplicate VIN. Of course if someone feels otherwise, I'll hear soon....

While you *CAN* take youre car by a dealer and request a VIN check
to see if it ever had the recall fix, please be aware that the "fix"
is a huge ugly "hat" for the battery, which keeps water from hitting
the battery, mixing with acid, and running onto the fuel lines.

That, by the way, was the recall issue. Battery acid running onto
the fuel lines (directly under the battery, natch) and eroding it
to the point of leakage at which point it sprays onto the engine
causing a fire.

Subject: 911 rough idle


Oh sages of the net, I need some assistance. My 1985 911 Carrera has lately
acquired a rough idle during startup. It stumbles at about 600 rpm for about
15 seconds, and over the next 15 seconds ramps up to 1000 rpm before
leveling off at a proper 800 rpm.

It seems to "need" this thirty second "no throttle" warmup. If I give it
a little throttle to stop the stumble, it will still go through its warmup
"stumble cycle" when I let it idle.

It has a new fuel filter and air filter. Plugs have only 5K miles. I checked
the idle air regulator as prescribed in the manual, and it seems ok.
(Test was to put +12V on center terminal, ground outside left and then right
terminal. Valve toggled quickly from one side to the other when I did this.)

Is this possibly a fuel pressure problem? The engine fires right up; just
runs rough initially. Only happens when it is cold. Perhaps it isn't holding
pressure? If so, why does it still fire up right away?

Thanks in advance!

P.S. Stan - Is anyone else getting "clipped" digests? This morning, I only got
about a quarter of the articles listed in the table of contents.

Subject: Re[2]: 914 hinge rework. (bolt zerk mod)


  I was wondering if anyone would pick up on this..
  You know, I have not done this and would like to have them for
my pair of 14's too.  I will check into who has these already made
up (I do not really have time to make my own right now).
  Seem to remember reading about these in Dennis Deeds
914 Owners Association publication, 'Mid-Engine Views'.  I let my
subscription run out over a year ago..maybe should re-start eh?

  Anyway, the mod was pretty simple in principle.  Drill a hole in
the head of the bolt deep enough to reach the center of the bearing
surface of the bolt, and of sufficient diameter to allow a zerk to 
self-thread in.  Then cut a groove about halfway in the bearing area.
The groove does not have to be deep, only enough for grease to migrate.
  Then drill a smaller hole from the groove to intersect with the
center gallery, your choice of going all the way through from one
side to the other, or just enough to intersect.  Not exactly rocket
science..
  A person could do it with a portable drill and a vice.
  To cut the groove, chuck the bolt into the drill and clamp
a half-moon file in the vice and carefully hog the groove using the 
sharp edge of the file.  A drill press would make life simpler.
  
  Granted, a little precision at the eyeball level, but not impossible.

  The bolts themselves are around $5 each..just a guess at
how much the mod'd bolt would be.. $10?
  btw, these bolts are used on the front and rear trunk lids (914).
  Anyone know if these are used on any other porsches?

  Everyone; go out right now and lube your hinges...=:)

  
  Thanks for the inquiry.

Subject: Gauge Readings in 924,944


Due to the design of the wiring harness and the early-style modular
fuse panel. there can be some significant variences in the indicated
readings when the headlights or air conditioning are used.

The voltage drop is due to the gauge wire used for power distribution, 
the inherent voltage drop from the fuse panel and the resistance in the 
ground return (again form the wire gauge and connector resistance).

Unless you feel the need and are knowledgeable enough to do a rewire
of the instrument circuit, leave it alone. A voltage/current regulator 
would help a little, however, this requires more circuitry to the
gauges.

The reason for the occurance is thus: there are numerous connections
in the modular fuse panel, each connection has some resistance. The
lights and air conditioning relays are supplied by the same switched 
power circuit the gauges and accesssories are. There is only so much
current available to run everything. Each gauge is electric with a long
current path to the sensors. There is voltage drop in this path, then 
the sensors are a resistive units. All depend on current being available 
to operated them in a given range. If another accessory takes some 
current to operate, then the oil pressure gauge (for example) may have
10% less current operating through it to provide a measured value.

A good designer will try to reduce the amount of current required for 
a measurement so as to minimize changes when other accessories are 
operating.

I never worry about it, I know what the indication is with and without 
the power hungry accessories operating. 

A few parties have added extra grounding between the chassis and engine,
this isn't much help. A cleaning of the existing paths is usually enough,
it is *VERY* important to ensure that the battery leads are free if
oxidation and corrosion. Clean them first, ESPECIALLY the ground strap
to the body and any straps from the engine to ground. I use either a
battery post protector or Permatex Dialectric Tune-up Grease to displace
moisture and dirt at the connections.

911s and 914s have the problem also, though it's less noticeable.

I have the Haynes and HPBooks books, plus some others. The HPBooks is a bit
more theoretical, the Haynes is more a cookbook on how to overhaul a couple
of different Weber models.

I found that a different book, an actual Weber publication, was the most
useful in understanding what all the parts do - it has some very nice

it from either Alfa Ricambi or AutoParts International (FIAT and Alfa). 
I'm moving, and I can't get to it for some time (months) to check it for

Main bore of the throttle body is 6mm bigger, taking larger venturies,
butterflys, and a few other odd bits (mainly gaskets). Otherwise, they
use the same parts.

The 46mm is too big for reasonable low-end response for a street car.
And near as I can tell, there's *NO* excuse for the 50mm "conversions"

Scott, this is true but irrelevent; the point here is not what the 
boiling point is at 35 psi (about 260 deg. F), but what the vapor 
pressure of water is at 212 deg. F.

>Also, how can you state that the water, when it turns to a gas, will

Rick stated that it would add 15 psi when it turned to a gas at 212 
deg.F, not just when it turned to a gas.  The difference is critical!

Boiling is *defined* as the point where the vapor pressure equals the 
ambient pressure.

Since we know water boils at 212 deg. F, we also know that at that
temp, it has a vapor pressure of 14.7 psi.  [14.696 from the tables]

>Don't you need to know how much water is in the tire and the

Actually, the answer is sort of.

There has to be sufficent water to saturate (100% humidity) the air.  
Beyond saturation, more water won't generate further pressure increase.
Below saturation, the effect will decrease down to zero at 0% water.

True.  However I've seen water spewing out of several gas station air 
hoses [in fact I always spray the hose to check for water before 
inflating my tires].  

Generally, compressors are *drained* to remove water.  In addition, most
air lines have water traps in them; I think you can assume that you are 
*not* going to get dry air from a compressor.

So says the guys on sci.chem.

However...

The clip you posted discussed a lot of stuff: compressability (not an 
issue), real vs. ideal gas (not an issue at these temps and pressures), 
difference between air and N2 (not an issue).  

It did not discuss the vapor (partial) pressure of water, which is what 
I believe to be the issue.

I mentioned in a previous post that when I first heard that filling 
tires with N2 reduced the pressure rise my reaction was: "nope, wrong,
fairy story; no difference between air and N2 at those temps and pressures."

However, the person relating the story commented that these were 
*measured* results.  Since I believe *the highest truth* is experimental 
evidence, either I discount the information or I have to be able to 
explain it.  Or it'll bug me.

The guys making the measurements were pretty serious motorcycle 
racers; they keep log books, record the changes they make, log comments
about the results of the changes, etc.

In other words I wasn't ready to ignore their data just because it doesn't 
fit my ideas.

So I started thinking what else is there that could explain the results. 
What
I come up with is water vapor.  (this was several years ago.)

My "engineering estimate"  [what they say at work when they want us to 
guess] is that one *could* get twice the pressure rise with wet air that one
would get with dry air.

This assumes a cold temp of 80 F.,  a hot temp of 180 F.,  dry air with no
water,
wet air 100% saturated, uses the above table extraction, and assumes that
T1/T2 = P1/P2.

That may not sound like much, but every little bit helps.

The best part of the chip is the ability to rev the engine a bit higher.  At
Lime Rock Park, this means that I can take a couple of corners in 3rd gear
with a bit more power available, instead of 4th, because I can complete the
corner without hitting the redline.

So, bottom line, I think that the chip is worth probably $200 in additional 
performance.  I don't think I would spend $495 for that much improvement, but
$200, yeah, OK...

So where does one find such a CPU/Chip upgrade for $200.00? I'm stuck with the 
non-socketed '83 944 CPU also!

The answer to your question is that at very low levels of
power and particularly torque, ie engine running at less than 1000
rpm, you must use the transmission in order to reduce the load on the engine!
I think that the car is telling you that it wants you to change gear :-)

I don't consider this a stupid question, in fact it is quite interesting,
I know that it is a characteristic of the reciprocating internal combustion
engine that it produces no power or torque at zero revolutions
(intuitive huh?), and very little power or torque at idle or low revolutions.
Therefore, if you adopt a gear ratio high enough that the force
required to turn the road wheels exceeds the torque the engine is producing, 
it will just stop. I suppose that in the twilight region
where the force required and the torque produced are very close,
then the system gets upset because the engine management is not capable
of regulating the system under load at such low power levels.

It is interesting to contrast the internal combustion engine with an electric
motor, which is quite capable of producing maximum torque at zero RPM and
has a completly flat torque curve. I am sure that
there is someone out there (Hi Theo!) who will be better able to explain
the mechanical principles involved and contrast the power and torque
curves of different types of engine, and correct any defects in my reply.

I don't like the electronic helmets. I've used a borrowed one, very briefly,
and several times it undarkened on me while I was making a weld. No thanks.
 
If you have trouble seeing where you're going to start the bead, try working
out in sunlight, maybe with your head in the shadow of something to avoid
extra light inside the helmet from the rear. And don't try to weld right
away, let your eyes dark adapt for 5 to 10 seconds, you'd be amazed at what
you can see through that dark glass.

I asked a professional welder friend about the electronic-visor arc welding
helmet. His opinion is that it's a good idea, but not quite ready for
prime time. It runs on small batteries, which run down after maybe a
hundred strikes, or after sitting around unused for a month or two; it
is a little fragile for something that is not likely to be handled with
care; and the spatter and crud generated by stick welding will foul the
sensor. He says it's great the first few times you use it, though.

Unless you know that the water traps are 100%.  

For guarenteed DRY air, any SCUBA diving shop has it.

For us divers, the tire inflator adaptor hooks up to your LP hose; <$20.

For you non-divers, innovation is needed - Scuba is a self-regulated
industry and they're not supposed to sell life support equipment to
untrained individuals.  

You should be able to talk them into putting air into some system thats
obviously not for life support use.  With "el-cheapo" conventional scuba
products, you're talking ~$200 to set up a new system.

Fellow Porschephiles,

First, I'm happy to say my '74 Carrera is back on the road after putting in a
new clutch. Many thanks to philers Don Munn and Jeff Shorey for making it
possible.

There is a strange problem which has appeared after putting the engine back
in: the OEL- light flashes intermittently after the oil has warmed a bit.
There is plenty of oil and oil pressure is good, so I don't think I really
have an oiling problem. The right cam tower line was replaced when the
engine was out, and the OEL- light sender was removed at that time. But it
was reinstalled and I have double-checked the wiring to the sender. Does
anybody know why this may be happening?

Also, in trying to replace the O-ring for the oil thermostat, I couldn't pull
the thermostat out. It lifts up about half an inch but then won't come out
any further. I've pulled pretty hard and even pried on it a little, but to no
avail. It should just pull right up and out, right? Has anybody had trouble
with this before?

Thanks in advance for any replies,

I've seen advertised, recently, sealed gel-type (?) batteries for automotive
applications that are supposed to eliminate acid leaks such as those common
to 914s.  The gel batteries appear to be about 30-40% more expensive than
conventional batteries.  Are there other disadvantages that make them evil
to use in a p-car?  Anyone have experience with these.  On the surface,
these sound like a better technology for solving the acid problem than the
Porsche's battery hat.

Subject: 356 ZF Steering box saga


Here is a status report on the 356 ZF steering box repair.  In response to
my request in finding a source for the cam follower (the "peg") I received
several suggestions, but the only actual source apparently is Tanner, 
suggested by Trond.  Trond also supplied the ZF fax number, but they did
not reply to my FAX (and it was in German).  I also got an offer of an
apparently good used box from a PF member at the reasonable price of $125.
Since I have at least one other worn box in my other cars, I did buy this.
But after I obtained the right puller and really got the defective cam
follower out of the box and the bearings off it, I decided to attempt 
resurfacing it.  The nature of the damage was pitting... must have been
some kind of stress corrosion.  There appeared to be no damage to the
worm either.  Luckily I have a "Minimat" which I can  mount on
the cross ways of my lathe.  By chucking a grinding wheel in the Minimat
and the cam follower in the main lathe chuck, I can achieve a pretty
good grinding tool with completely adjustable taper capability.  
Using a dial indicator I could set up exactly parallel to the existing 
taper on the cam follower.  I had to take off a lot of material to get
completely through the pits, I estimate about 0.4 mm off the radius.  This
reduction in diameter necessitated grinding about a mm off the end of the
peg and a similar amount off the shoulder.  The reworked peg looks of
course identical to the original, except the shoulder is 1 mm thinner and
the overall length is about a mm less.  Not knowing the hardening/annealing
history of the material, I decided the safe thing to do is not to attempt to
harden... my reworking the surface would not affect the strength or toughness,
but might have exposed a softer surface, because I may have penetrated whatever
surface treatment was used originally.  I reassembled the box with new bottom
seal and put it back in the car yesterday.  The car (356B coupe) with new
kingpins/linkpins, restored steering box, and (for the first time) correctly
set up toe-in drives like a dream.  Now I want to see if the pin wears
excessively ... keep you posted.

Well, I could be way off base on this, but your problem sound very similar to one I just had on my
Toyota Celica.  At constant highway speeds (about 2400 RPM), the engine would buck or stumble
occasionally and increasing the engine load would make it worse.  Depressing the pedal far enough
to cause a downshift (automatic trans) would cause the engine to speed up (>3000 RPM) and it 
would pull great.
Eventually, the problem got worse and the car ran terrible at idle and bucked steadily at speed.
The higher the RPMs, the smoother it was however.
Turns out the problem was a bad fuel injector.  I suspect it was spraying too much fuel as the engine
was running way too rich.  At higher RPMs, the engine could use the extra fuel it was getting and it
smoothed out.  At idle, it was running on three cylinders.

Hope this helps,

AAAH!  the main bore is not larger, except below the venturi - the same
venturis actually fit though the taper is wrong.  And the gasket sets
are the same!

We discovered (this much to our ammusment) when putting some 38mm
venturis in my 46mms.  Just for jollys we slid in a pair of 32mms from
a set of 40s we ha in hand.

I was relatively amazed to find that a) the venturis fit and b)
velocity stacks are the same on both (which is handy because someone
had put the short - A/C stacks on my 46s)


Other than the size of the bore at the throttle plate, we couldn;t see
any differences externally, though I must admit it was a cursory
examination.

RE the 46s too big - dunno, I think my 3.4 would have a litle trouble
in the above 5000 RPM department running 40s - since it's stronger
everywhere (even 3-4K) with 38mm vs 36mm venturis.  Idle is fine the

Main bore of the throttle body is 6mm bigger, taking larger venturies,
butterflys, and a few other odd bits (mainly gaskets). Otherwise, they
use the same parts.

The 46mm is too big for reasonable low-end response for a street car.

Subject: Winter 911 storage/restoration

Hello,

Well, it is nearly the end of my 911 Targa season in Boston, with frost
beginning to form on the grass when I wake up each day.  No, I will
not drive mine in the winter, I do not have porsches, I have a porsche.
and a winter $100 chevette, and that is life, and I want my porsche to 
be around for a while, galvanized or not, it has never seen snow/salt.

Anyways, I am the guy that earlier this summer, wrecked my valves and
probably other stuff in my 3.0 911 when racing that mustang.  Remember 
that one?  And against the advice of many, I have been drvigin it ever
since, without any problems, aside from a rough idle.  So now, in a few
weeks, I will be putting it to rest in my garage, and contemplating the
best way to go about repairing any damage I caused in the spring.

So I think I will be the first person this year to ask, what is the proper
way to store my '81 911 for the winter?   Last year, Dicks Auto Body 
stored it for the entire winter for free for me while they settled a 
nice $17K repair job on it on some guys insurance.  (He ran me off the 
road, and then tried to get away.  Insurance companies will pay EVERYTING
when their client tries a hit+run.  I got a 930 RUF conversion, new C4 rims, 
and entire paint job from his njegligence.)

Back to my questions about storage now.  Is there a list of things to do;
like defalte tires?  Any treatment for leather seats?  Any special things
I should do to engine until I get around to repairing it in early spring?
Why did someone last year say change the oil, and then change it again in
the spring - since it wont be used oil?  What about the comment I recall
about pressing in the clutch now and then?  Fill gas tank?  Dissconnect
battery?  Should I start it weekly?  I am concerned about corrosion of
the disc brakes.  My chevettte has sat in the driveway all summer, and
now needs brake work due to the grinding I hear when pressing on them 
when rolling.  Should the 911 discs be sprayed with something like wd-40?
What about a good wash, drive, and then wax before putting on the car 
cover?  What can I treat the tires with so the rubber wont crack?  Do I 
have to treat the whole tire, or just the sidewalls?  Should I put it
up on blocks, to relieve weight on suspension and prevent flat tire spots?
Crack open windows to let out moisture?  I may rebuild the Targa top.  
Would it be bad to leave this indoors (off) with the car covered?

My garage is not heated, has no garage door (open all the time), and has 
a concret floor, which gets wet throughout the summer.  Is a plastic vapor 
barrier under the car recommended?  Should I hang a tarp over the garage
opening to prevent snow from getting in, or will this matter since the
car will be covered?  Will the Giants win the Superbowl?  Thanks.

Oh yeah, while I'm in here:  I went to Chambers Porsche in Boston yesterday
and they told me my 911 color was called "SCHWARZ".  It is a dark mettalic
grey/green, almost black.  This is a Euro-911SC car.  What does Schwarz
mean in germany?  Does anyone else have a schwarz colored porsche?  At
the place, I checked out a black 964.  It said on the sticker it was a
turbo, and was a widebody, and had Turbo-3.6 on the back.  When did the
930 become the 964?  Are all 964's Turbos?  Why is this car $124,867.00?  
Who buys these things?  Why do I feel so poor?  help me.

Mike,

Here is some more information on this subject from John Porter:

========================================
Here are some useful equations and some numbers I have been playing
around with.

The ideal gas equation is, of course, PV = nRT.
All particles are "generic" in this model, so composition is irrelevant.
Depending on units used for P, V and T, the numerical value of R will
vary.  I will use P(atm), V(L) and T(K) where T(K) = T(C) + 273.15.  In
that case R = 0.08206 L atm/(mol K).

The next level of refinement is the van der Waals equation of state for
gases.  The equation works well for most gases at T >= Tb where Tb is the
boiling point of the gas at the given pressure. (I will get back to this
point later, as it refers to water).

The vdW equation introduces two new "substance-specific" parameters, a
and b.  The equation is:

        (P + (a n^2/ V^2)) (V - nb) = n R T

The first term effectively says the pressure is a bit too low because of
attractive interactions between gas molecules, and the second term
corrects for the fact that the gas molecules actually occupy a finite
volume like little hard spheres, so some volume is excluded.  There are
other equations but, as you'll see, this one does an excellent job at
describing your system.

Now, for the composition of "air" and the parameters for the different
components.  Here is the composition of "dry, carbon-dioxide-free" air at
the surface of the earth (the composition doesn't change significantly
with altitude at values where you wouldn't need an air supply to breathe):

Gas     vol%            a       b
N2      78.110          1.390   0.03913
O2      20.953          1.360   0.03183
Ar      0.934           1.345   0.03219
rest    0.003           (use mean of values above)
H2O     -----           5.464   0.03049
CO2     -----           3.592   0.04267

Real air at sea level and typical temperate climate temperatures has
between 0 - 7% water by volume and 0.01 - 0.1% CO2 by volume.  I used
3.5% and 0.05%, respectively, in my calculations and kept the ratios of
the other components the same as given above.  So, interesting - there is
actually more argon in the air than CO2.

Looking at the numbers for the a and b parameters, you can see some
interesting trends.  The "b" value is roughly the volume of a molecule,
so you can see that water is a relatively small molecule compared to the
other components (it is also light) while CO2 is relatively large (and
heavy).  The "a" values for water and CO2 are very large compared to the
others, because there are strong attractive interactions between water
molecules and between CO2 molecules.  So, a _pure_ sample of either one
of those two gases will differ from the ideal gas law to a greater extent
than the other gases, because the "corrections" are larger.

But just how large are the corrections under the conditions you are
interested in?  And, should the "a" and "b" numbers be different if the gas
is a mixture?  To answer the second question first, "yes".  Probably a
better model of the mixture would be to use a weighted average of the a
and b values, because most interactions will be between unlike molecules
in a pair-at-a-time way.  I didn't do this in my calculations, so I will
be _overestimating_ the deviations from the ideal gas case.

OK, let's calculate some values.  First, I assumed that you initially
filled the tire at room temperature, 25 C, with air containing water and
CO2 as I described above.  My calculations are in terms of absolute
internal pressure of the tire.  The measurement you actually make with
the tire gauge is the _differential_ pressure (Pinternal - Pexternal), of
course, with 1 atm approx. = 15 psi.  I assumed that the tire does not
expand, i.e. it has a constant volume of 22.4 L, as it is pressurized.  I
made calculations for total internal pressures that varied between 1 atm
(deflated) and 10 atm.  I don't know what your pressures are, but I would
expect between 30 and 60 psi (3 atm to 5 atm absolute internal pressure).

I made the calculations by: a) start with a total n, b) partition n
between the components by volume fraction, c) calculate the partial
pressures of the components from the vdW equation, d) sum the partial
pressures to get the total absolute pressure.  Here are a few typical
values (I did this on a spreadsheet):

ntot(moles)     T(C)    Ptot(atm)       P/Pideal
3.000           25.00   3.276           0.9997
4.000           25.00   4.365           0.9992
5.000           25.00   5.454           0.9987
10.000          25.00   10.882          0.9963
3.000           100.00  4.104           1.0006
4.000           100.00  5.470           1.0004
5.000           100.00  6.837           1.0003
10.000          100.00  13.662          0.9994

So what can the numbers tell us?

First, at 25 C when the tire is first filled, the total pressures are
within 1.3% of the ideal gas equation at the upper end of the practical
range, and well within 1% at the lower end.  The situation only gets
better as the tire is warmed; at 100 C pressures are all within a half
percent or so of the ideal gas equation.  So, as I said before, the ideal
gas equation is a damn good first approximation when dealing with air,
even moist air.

Hence, replacing the air with pure nitrogen will have virtually no effect
on these numbers -- if anything, they will get even closer to the ideal
gas limit (compare the a and b values for N2 vs. their ideal values of zero).

Why doesn't the water screw things up?  Well, because it is actually such
a minor component and it is in a pressure regime where the ideal equation
or, better yet, the vdW equation, is an excellent approximation.  If you
filled your tire in water-saturated air at ambient temperatures above 70
C, then it would begin to have a measureable effect.  Of course, you'd be
dead, but that's a minor point.

Also, as I mentioned in my previous note, the most important thing is the
temperature of the system, in terms of parameters that affect the
internal tire pressure.  Look at the huge change in absolute internal
pressure as the tire is warmed from 25 C to 100 C.  This blows away the
tiny "non-ideal-gas" effects.

And, as you probably know if you are a performance car enthusiast, the
_atmospheric pressure_ has a large effect, too.  The rigidity of the tire
is a function of the differential pressure (which is why the gauge
measures this).  So, if the atmospheric pressure changes during a race
day, then this can swamp out these tiny "non-ideal" effects, too.
Atmospheric pressure also has a huge effect on carburetion, and the ideal
gas law can be used there, too.

So, all in all, I would recommend using the ideal gas law as an excellent
first measure.  Control the temperature of the tires, and make
adjustments as the atmospheric pressure changes.  These things will be
far more important that the composition of the gas in the tires.

And, don't listen to "scientists" or "experts" (including me, of course)
without a healthy dose of scepticism.  That's why I like to argue with
numbers, because they are universal.  Models can be crude or
sophisticated, so there is room for argument there, but cranking out some
actual values is usually a very good idea.

This was instructive and fun.  Hope it helps.

J.P.
========================================

As you can see, water will have very little impact on tire pressures.

disk model (I love the 10 disc unit we put in my wife's Honda), but I 
cannot see where to put the sucker. Anyone out there put a changer in a 928?

As always, any help is mucho appreciated. Catch y'all later...

First of all, "driving the car to its limits under "relatively" safe
conditions." is not called racing, it is called driver education or track
events.

With your daily driver, you can do the occasional track event without too
much noticeable damage.  You will increase the maintenance schedule for your
vehicle, if only to more frequently flush the brake fluid, check your
wheel bearings and brake pads, buy more tires and wheels, change your oil
and tranny fluid, etc.

You may also increase the enjoyment factor of your car, since you will
undoubtedly become a better driver.

If you go to the track (even just to observe) you will see a good
cross-section of nice cars and not-so-nice cars.

(My car is a daily driver, 90K miles, 20K track miles, still going strong!)

This would be the perfect accessory for a Photo-RADAR detector if you 
could control the darkening with electric current. You could make a 
license plate cover with this material and hook it up to the detector. 
The second it goes off, the entire plate turns black. A few seconds later

I have spoken to both PCNA and Alpine about this.  PCNA will exchange a CD-2 for
a rebuilt one for about $400, if I remember correctly.  I don't know about the
CD-1.  Alpine, who manufactured the CD-2, refuses to provide any information or
to deal with the owner directly, referring the owner to his local Porsche
dealer.  I suggest calling PCNA and asking.

At that price I don't think it's worth it (especially given that I paid about
$200 for the CD-2).  The tuner in my CD-2 is really quite poor (by direct
comparison with a Blaupunkt cassette unit and a Pioneer CD unit).  The only good
things I have to say about the CD-2 are that a) it says "Porsche" on it, and b)
it tracks over rough surfaces better than the Pioneer.

Ben,

I never lived in Cleveland, but I spent 22 years of my life in western
Pennsylvania, which was close enough.  The weather is lousy (I'm in
California now), but compared to England it might be considered an
improvement.  However, rather than jumping on the Cleveland-bashing
bandwagon, I'll give you a positive for Cleveland Porschephiles.
Stoddard Imported Cars, one of the premier Porsche parts suppliers in
the US (especially for the older models I'm told), makes its home in
Willoughby, OH, which is only a few miles to the east of Cleveland.

Too late. They've already succeeded. If I remember the facts correctly, the
ethanol lobby, led by Archer-Daniels-Midland of Peoria, IL (Jack Daniels
etc.) has managed to force the EPA to mandate a certain percentage of
biomass alcohol in the fuel. That means alcohol distilled from corn. And
guess who makes that? The oil companies have pointed out (wrong, right,
don't know, they're self-serving too) that their own MTBE is just as
effective and cheaper, but that didn't cut any ice with those in Washington
who have presumably lined their pockets with lobbyist money. This is a fait

Regarding rebuldability of CD1:  Completely unsolicited
advice/question:

I had a 1986 951 converted to somewhere between a TS and a cup car
(Some parts form each suspension wise).  I put an ALpine 6CD changer in
it in the rear left stowage compartment.  It only skipped on SEVERE
bumps.

I'm not sure of the integrity of the sony units, but the local sony
outlet (sells on remanufactured and is actuaslly owned by SONY) has CD
changers AND decent head units -w- cassette, programmanble CD operator
for about $400.
  There's something to be said for having 10 hours of uninterupted un
  repeated CD listening.  Carrying 2 spare magazines will get you most
  of the way acreoss the country.

If your CD1 is toast, you may concider the change over.  Wiring is
realtively simple and sound quality should be comparable.  Just make
sure to hook up the antenna amp!

If you just make adapter plugs for everything you can retro the CD1
when (if) the car is ever sold.

Ben -

Appreciated your answer to the torque/power/lugging question.
Many would have blown it off, but you resisted the urge to 
grind your teeth, roll your eyes and make those low gurgling
noises in your throat. I didn't - but I applaud your patience
and knowledge.

Cleveland, however, is a different matter.  You are asking
red-blooded Americans to comment on something that is about
as interesting as used toothpicks.  It's a mid-sized city
with crime, poverty, dirt, traffic, kids, schools, churches,
hospitals, police, nice people, nasty people, rich areas
and poor areas. It's located half-way between everywhere
on the south side of a very large shallow lake which helps
to produce lake-effect snow in the cold, wet and windy winters.
The opposite of which is the hot, steamy summers. The surrounding
countyside reminds one a discarded pooltable that allows farmers
to get rich growing lots of things as it goes on and on and on....
Most of the people in Cleveland wish they were somewhere else
but not in one of the dozen or so cities just like it in the
great Mid-West (which spawned me, by the way). While the scenery
make many places great to look at (Bay Area, Seattle, Boston,
Denver, Anchorage), a place is what you make of it and there are
opportunities everywhere. The most important resource, though, is
making new friends - better than gold and nontaxable. 

Lastly, did you say something about getting a Porsche at bargin price?
Well, I guess every thing is relative. 'Course most of my relatives
back in Indiana never even heard of a Porsche so I can probably claim
I'm a victim of Porsche-deficiency-anemia.

In any case, good luck.

Subject: electronic welding helmets



About 15 years ago, I designed an electro-mechanical welding
helmet for my own use because I was doing some very fine-detail
mig welding that required both hands for control. I used an air
solenoid that pulled a standard darkened welding glass down and it 
returned by spring power. I had a switch on the MIG trigger and a 
fail-safe so that the welder couldn't start until the glass was
fully down. At the time I rejected liquid crystal because it would 
take many layers $$ to get adequate density, and I rejected a Kerr
cell because of weight.

I was pretty proud of my "super helmet" but couldn't get any welders
excited about it. They just didn't have the same problem I did 
starting a weld in precisely the right spot (or didn't care). They
also didn't like the noise (which could have been better controlled)
I used the helmet for a year or so and gave up on the idea. 

Mine was a pretty low-tech solution to the problem. Total cost as 
I recall was about $75 in misc. parts (not including the helmet)
The only machine work was making a custom "frame" to hold the sliding
window and a bracket for the solenoid. It would be well with the
capabilities of most Porsche DYI'rs

Subject: Re: Back-firing 911 SC

My 1980 911SC does the same thing when I lift off the throttle at
high speeds on the freeway (going straight, of course :-)). My
mechanic, too, says there's probably a hole inside the 
muffler itself. Replacing the muffler (and cat, if necessary) is
on my list, behind the fuel injection stuff.

My mechanic says there may be problems with new
Bosch warmup regulators for CIS cars -- something to do
with its fuel/air curve attenuating at then end, causing the
cars to run lean when warmed up. When he tried to compensate
by making the car run a little more rich, the car started surging after
ignition, presumably because it was too rich. Has anyone else
heard of this rumor? Could emissions be a factor in the changes,
if the rumors are true? If so, are European 911SCs using the same
exact part?

Keep the revs above 2000 rpm (at least on a 944) pretty much all of the
time. Lugging the engine is hard on a number of engine/drivetrain
components, so you really want to avoid it. I may get some heat from the
others on the list for this, but I feel that the 944/951 engine is quite a
robust unit. I have just over 75k on my '84 944, and I usually like to
cruise with the motor turning between 2800-4000rpm. I never let the revs
fall below 2000, but sometimes I will cruise at 2200rpm when feeling "laid
back". I really only use 5th above 55mph.

The only time your engine should be turning 1000 rpms (or there about) is
when the car is at idle.

In his excellent series of articles on the 924/944/968 in Excellence
magasine (Oct. 1994), Jim Pasha explains that lugging the engine is hard on
the engine main and rod bearings and other driveline bearings. He also
notes that keeping the trans at higher revs promotes better circulation of
oil in the trans. I think that what Jim says is correct (he knows a lot
more about cars than I do - since he's the one writing the articles and I'm
the one reading them :-)

I hope this helps ...

and raised in Cleveland and all my relatives live there, so I have spent quite
a few ENJOYABLE hours in Cleveland.  A Quick Tour for those who have never
been.  The Gateway complex, containing a new baseball stadium and basketball
arena, was just completed for the beginning of this years shortened baseball
season.  Now, within EASY walking distance of downtown, one  can enjoy sports
YEAR round in Cleveland (how many other cities can say that??).  Then there is
the Flats, which is divided into two banks one on easy side of the Cuyahauga
(something like that) River.  This is the entertainment spot in Cleveland. 
Numerous restuarants, clubs, and bars are located within a 2-3 square mile
radious. Also located in the Flats is the Nautica Complex which is a 10-12
thousand seat out-door concert hall.  I have been to a couple shows there,
seeing top rated bands like Soundgaren and Nine Inch Nails (a Cleve. BAnd).
But, the biggest attraction for Ben would be to see Stoddard in person (done

Subject:  How many keys for 914? 

How many distinct keys should there be for a 914 (1974 if it makes a
difference).  When I bought my 914 it came with a bunch of keys (2 of
which actually worked on the locks).  The keys which worked were:

1 black - opens driver's door and fits ignition
1 red   - opens passenger's door and rear trunk lock

I don't remember which one opens the front hood (bonnet) lock, but I
think it was the red one.

I know the car had been broken into at least once (glass under seats),
but I don't know if any locks were replaced or if that is what the setup
is supposed to be.  Does anyone know for sure?  The setup almost makes
sense (1 key for the driver, and another for everything else).

Subject: Distributor Problem/Question


Help, please..

The Problem:

I'm having trouble with the distributor for the '72 911E 
I'm rebuilding.  The  return springs in the mechanical 
(centrifugal) advance do not bring the weights back 
together, i.e., back to the 'zero point'.  Instead, the 
slightest spin, even by hand, brings the weights to an 
almost fully extended position, where they remain.  They 
never go back to the 'zero point'.  Thus, they are in the 
position of maximum advance to begin with, and as a 
consequence there is no advance as engine speed 
increases.  In this condition, it doesn't matter how you set 
the timing, things never work right.  The timing is all 
screwed up and performance is poor.

I've got the distributor apart -- not such an easy task with 
a Bosch unit, although it's a snap with any 
American/Japanese unit I've worked on - and it looks to 
me like both springs are fine.  They're not stretched, or 
otherwise worn.  The mechanism itself is well lubricated 
and free.

>From what I can see, the distributor is designed with two 
advance curves.  There are two different springs.  One 
appears to be designed to control advance at low rpm, 
and the other at higher rpm.  I believe my problem is with 
the low rpm spring.  There is a lot of slop where it 
attaches (slips over is a better term) to the stud on the 
mechanism.  The diameter of the loop on the spring is 
large compared to the stud diameter, so there's lots of 
slack.  Hence at low rpm the weights move out 
unimpeded by the low rpm spring, they merely take up 
the slack in the spring loop/stud arrangement.  When 
they're nearly fully extended the high rpm spring, which 
has a deliberately long (oval) loop and therefore 
deliberate slack,  takes over. It controls the last few 
degrees of advance, probably the last 10 or so. My guess 
is that there was once a teeny tiny bushing on the stud of 
the low rpm spring that must have worn away over the 
last 23 years, and said bushing took up the slack in the 
attachment loop.

The Question:

Is there anyone out there who has looked into a similar 
Bosch distributor who can tell me if I'm right?  It seems to 
me that I ought to be able to fabricate a small bushing, or 
even bend the stud to take up the slack.  I'm planning to 
try the former first, the latter as a last resort.  It turns out a 
new distributor is between $400-$500, and a rebuilt is 
over $300.  Seems nuts when all that might be missing is a 
2 cent part.  By the way, Bosch doesn't sell distributor 
parts, only the whole thing. 

Thanks in advance...better than thanks in retard...sorry, couldn't
resist it...

Hey Everybody:

Thanks for responding to my questions about the 88-951s vs 89-951.  I 
think the general consensus is:  Start by asking for the part using 
88-951s.  If their computer doesn't show that model, use 89-951 and be 
"reasonably" assured that the parts will be the same.  It also seems that 
consumable parts (filters, belts, etc..) are the same.

As for the CD-1: Ask the dealership for a rebuilt unit - If too expensive, 
forget it.  There are better units on the aftermarket.

I appreciate the advice.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

Well, there are supposed to be two keys, one red and one black, but
odds are that the car's had a  partially lock replacement because it's
*supposed* to have one that opens EVERYTHING and one that only opens 
the doors (both of them) and the ignition. And I get confused about
which is which color.

There's a factory part number for "complete lock set with keys" that

Subject: Vibrators and Lugging


Hi all,

A few notes on driveline vibrations from 2700 RPM to 3800 RPM (plus or
minus a few, depending on the mass).

The usual cause is disintegration of the clutch center. This can occur 
on ANY Porsche with a rubber dampened clutch disc. Oil, heat, dirt and
humidity conspire to cause the rubber to delaminate and make the 
vulcanized bond (not Spock as 007) go away. In some cases chunks of 
rubber larger than the usual small pebbles leaves the disc. This causes 
the disc to make noise as the clutch is engaged and disengaged and,
if the mass is large enough, cause a vibration due to a massive 
imbalance. 

How much of an imbalance? It doesn't take a lot. In addition, large 
pieces have been known to lodge in the pressure plate, causing 
engagement and disengagement problems. If caught early enough, just the 
disc requires replacement. Most have required disc, pressure plate, 
throw-out bearing. Always have the flywheel surfaced, have the flywheel and clutch components balanced together and always replace the pilot
bearing. Not-so-cheap insurance.

Lugging a Porsche engine. Well, they'll take it. They buck and shudder 
and gradually get back up to operating range. Consider this, keep all 
but the 928 above 2000 RPM and they will live a long time. The 928 has 
more cylinders and has a design more condusive to "urban" (or is that
urbane?) driving. 

Three things of major consideration occur: 1) Oil flow volume may not be sufficient to "float" the bearings at low crankshaft speeds, scuffing 
can occur. 2) the transmission bearings take a tremendous hit as there 
isn't much lubrication flowing. 3) the clutch takes a beating as the 
power impulses can cause slip. Besides, cooling isn't good because the 
water pump or fan isn't flowing enough coolant over the engine.

Some of the 4-cam owners know that low RPM can destroy an expensive
Hirth rollercrank. Same principles at work.

Turbos will pull well if driven in the 2000 and above range. Lower Rpms
do not spool the turbo enough to produce any useable boost.

One of the things that wipes a Porsche with a driveshaft is lugging. The
shaft bearings are designed to work under load in an optimal range. 
Lugging causes the shaft to flex and whip a little under the pulses.
Just smoothly drive the car, selecting gears as the RPM range and 
driving conditions dictate.

914 Rot Report
    Hi, again.
    The good news is that the worst rot seems to be confined to
the (non-structural) sheet of metal that the fuel pump was bolt-
ed to.  The bad news is that that piece has rotted *through*,
and that there's a fair amount of surface stuff on the other me-
tal near it.  Some of which is structural.
    So it gets some panic-mode treatment ASAP, including tie-
wraps or duct tape or *something* to keep the fuel pump from
flopping around.  Suggestions?  How about "rust converters?"
Probably have to chop that one section of metal out.  Then do
it right at a later time, when I can take the time to do it right.

Hello Philes,

I have a 79 911SC which stalls from a cold start. It starts up just fine but
will stall immediately. If you restart it a couple of times it will stay lit
and runs fine from there on. The colder the outside temerature the worst the
problem is. I figure since the car runs fine otherwise, it's probably not a
tune up or air leak problem. My guess is the warm up regulator. Problem is
the dealer I brought the car from says they installed a new regulator. I
bought the car in the summer so I didn't know the problem was still there.
Can't go back to the dealer since I've lived with the problem for 3 years
(lazy me). I'm concerned that a new WAR might not solve the problem. I
recall some years ago reading that some SCs needed the Euro WAR to solve
this problem. Any ideas?

Bert. Are you a PCA member? If not join. I'm not trying to stuff PCA
membership down anyone's craw but it is *THE BEST* source of Porsche car
driving events.  Every PCA Region has some kind of "low speed" novice
event(s), which is the most likely place to begin your driver training.

Autocross (in California it's called a Slalom) is the easiest, cheapest,
least hard on your car activity.  It involves driving your car around a
course laid out with (usually) orange traffic cones. You are running
against a clock and your time through the course is compared to that of the
other drivers in your assigned class.  About the only risk of damage will
be from hitting cones which can sometimes leave a smudge on the car. The
smudge can easily be rubbed off using car wax.  You will put some extra
wear and tear on your tires and you will be up/down shifting several times
during a run.

Driver Education is usually the next step up from Autocross. Most Regions
will *NOT* let you attend a Driver Ed. event without having some autocross
experience under your belt. Driver Ed is almost always held on a race
course and the opportunity to do some real damage to your exists. No, they
do not just turn you loose to see how fast you can go. There are rules, and
for the first one or two events, you will likely have an instructor on
board. These events are not usually timed, but most drivers have someone
time them or use an on-board timer to keep track of how well they are
improving. A variation on driver ed. is called a Time Trial which does
involve a formal timed run, usually on the afternoon of the last day.
Driver Ed./Time Trial events *WILL* put a serious strain on your brakes,
tires, and other mechanicals, but not to the point of breaking. Simple,
regular maintenance will keep your car on the track indefinitely. In
addition, most Regions require a five-point harness, which
may involve drilling a couple of holes.

Somewhere between autocrossing and driver education, your idea of a "daily
driver" will begin to change.  A suspension tweek here and an alignment
change there and...oh what the hell, it's what they were built for. Right?

Have fun!!!

4) Wrist-pin and big-end bearings take a much bigger impulse during ignition.
The piston is decelerating during the last part of the compression stroke,
which is where the charge is lit off. The thump from the "explosion" is
opposed by the force that causes that deceleration. At low rpm, that opposing
force is much less, which means that more of the thump gets transmitted to
the wristpin, rod, big end, and even the crank mains. Speedster 1500 engines
have a reputation for flat-spotting the roller bearings when you do that...

George,

   I was just wondering if you have any opinion or experience with regard to 
the chip sold by the EuroProduct Inc ( in Clearwater Fl). I recently bought
a SS muffler from them and was told that the muffler purchase entitles me
a discount towards the purchase of their performance chip. They said that
the chip is not the Authority brand but was their own brand.

My question is how many brands of performance chips are available ( for 
944/951) in the market and whether or not they all have a common
supplier. If their are many suppliers than how does one goes around
verifying the chip spec. without a dyno.

   High-end late model Quattros use Torsen (TORque SENsing) center
   differentials while earlier models use (lockable) mechanical differentials. 
   My Syncro is the Audi 4000 series quattro system (and I believe, the same
   as the Ur-Quattro and all other pre-torsen models).  The center and rear
   differentials can be manually locked by the driver, on the fly.  No
   clutches are used in either system, to the best of my (limited) knowledge.

This was the same scheme used in the Jeep Wagoneer "Quadra-Track"
system in the early/mid 70's, right down to the diff locking.  I think
that this was the first full-time (i.e. dry pavement) 4WD system.

realizing that my tuner sounded like hell before it died, I've decided on 
a Blau Lexington tape/radio player; $197(US) from Best Buy.  

All the Blau units sound virtually the same anyway (I'm standing by for 
incoming flames on this one). I can correct for any weirdness using the 
Blau EQ already in the car.  Since I have an extensive vinyl and tape 
collection but only 20 or so CDs (I'm a Porschephile not an Audiophile) 
this seems the best route.  

Now everything on the radio console will say Blaupunk....  yea!  :|

Well, I admit; I've wanted to visit Cleveland.  They have one of THE best

Subject: Re: Winter 911 storage/restoration

Beacuse I live in the "tundra" and as of Wednesday am a proud owner
of a '87 911 Targa, I am also interested in storage tips.  I've been
meaning to preruse the archives for tidbits, but I'm too busy enjoying
our limited good weather...

Anyway, I paraphrased the following from an article by Paul Brand in
the Minneapolis Star Tribune Oct 9, 1994).  All editorial comments and
spelling errors are mine.

 - Choose the last nice day you want to drive the vehicle.  Take it on
  a nice cruise for at least 30 minutes.  Enjoy yourself.  On the way
  home, fill the gas tank.

 - Once home, perform routine maintenance including oil and filter
  changes, chassis lube, cooling system flush ( ;-) - mjt),  transmission
  fluid and filter change, change brake fluid, etc.  Add fuel stabilizer
  and allow the car to run for a bit to let the stabilizer permeate the
  fuel system.

 - Check the air in the tires - remember that pressure falls with lower
  ambient temperatures.  There is no need to put the car on jack stands...

 - Thoroughly wash, dry, and wax the car.  Clean the interior as well, using
  vinyl and leather protectants where appropriate.

 - Disconnect and remove the battery.  Fully charge it now and once a month
  or so to keep it ready for the spring.

 - Open the side windows a crack to allow air circulation, but not so far
  as to allow small critters inside.  Plug the exhaust to prevent
  unauthorized entry by small critters.  Cover the car with a lightweight
  cover.


DON'Ts

 - Don't store the battery on a concrete floor.  Put it on a couple of
  blocks of wood.  Some people think that the concrete "reacts" with the
  battery, thus rendering it useless.  More likely the concrete slab
  is a good heat sink and that's really what does the poor thing in.
  (Anyone got the real story here, or is this just an urban legend? - mjt)

 - Don't put the car on jack stands.  Most modern tires won't "flat-spot"
  very badly over the winter.  If you must put the car in the air, lower
  the tire pressure to 15 psi.  Remember to reinflate the tires in the
  spring.

 - Don't start the car periodically.  Cold starts after weeks of inactivity
  in extreme cold are not helpful to the oil-feed components.  Short periods
  of idling without significant load are not enough to fully warm the oil
  and evaporate the raw fuel and moisture that condense inside the engine
  on a cold start.

  If you must: make sure the car gets *driven* to fully warm it up.  If
  applicable, run the AC to circulate the refrigerant/lubricant to keep
  the seals fresh.  But, remember that freon condenses into a pure liquid
  at -22F (January in Minnesota - mjt) so starting the car to run the AC
  at this temperature is useless anyway.


Does anyone have comments, changes, suggestions, etc?

thanks,
mjt

Fellow Porschephiles,

The verdict is in! Jeff Shorey and I did the frame-by-frame thing on scenes
from "The Big Chill" which feature the 911T Targa which Nick (William Hurt)
drove. It's not a '73, '72, '71, or even a '70. It's a 1969. The giveaway?
The push-button door handles which were replaced by the "trigger" type on
1970 and later models. And it's a U.S.-spec car, too.

It's good to have this crutial piece of Porsche movie trivia cleared up. ;->

Subject: Ferry tale

During a time near the dawn of civilized thought, a group of Persians
lived in a fertile valley. Although they lacked in worldly possesions,
the bounty of many fruit trees kept them free from hunger and they were,
for the most part, quite content. One day, however, one Persian 
lamented that the fruit, while delicious and satisfying, was difficult
to eat and left a sticky residue all over his hands. Determined to 
rectify this situation, he thought long and hard, and finally came up 
with the idea of lashing a flinty piece of rock to a stick. Using this
so-called 'rock-point' tool, he was able to cut the fruit up easily,
eliminating much of the work and mess. As good as this was, though, 
they still had to use their hands to eat the sticky fruit. So, another
enterprising Persian took this idea further by lashing three long 
thorns off of a tre to a stick. With this 'tree-point' tool, he 
could now eat his fruit and stay clean. There was a complication,
however, since the thorns came off of their ruler, Khar's, ornamental
trees. Since they were a penniless people, the trees were his only 
extravagance. Upon seeing his trees desecrated in such a way, Khar 
seized the 'tree-point' tools and in a frenzied rage, devoured them.
This point in history was then the culmination of events leading to
the development of the 'tree-point' tool eater poor Shah Khar era.....

Depends. If you're going to *REALLY* work on the car, there's no substitute
for the factory workshop manuals. If you just want to know more how it

Subject: Sunroof revisited


My sunroof on my 84 944 has never been able to release for complete removal. 


I am aware of all the advice in the past about ignition key positions etc 
but I would like to try one more crack at identifying where my problem is, 
so please bear with me.

The possible candidates for failure appear to be  :    The sunroof motor
                              The sunroof motor relays (431 951 253 D)  (2)
                              The radio relay (944 615 103 00)
                              The sunroof switch
                              The ignition switch

I would eliminate the ignition switch because it appears to turn on 
everything it should when it should (except the sunroof release)

I would elimate the sunroof motor and it's 2 attached relays as the sunroof 
goes up and down just fine

I would eliminate the sunroof switch becase it has been replaced and the 
problem preceeds replacement.

That leaves the sunroof/radio relay. The radio works fine, but I am not sure 
what role this relay plays in sunroof operation. on inspecting the relay it 
seems to be a complex  beast with chips and transistors in it. Can somebody 
tell me if it is possible to test these things to ensure that they are 
working correctly?

Any advice would be appreciated

I wouldn't go into a blind panic, but I'd fix this before getting
say new tires..

Like I've suggested before, find a good body shop that has a competent
fabricator, have him excise the bad metal and weld in a new plate.
Needs to be the same gauge steel, needs to be butt-welded, and you
gotta treat any other visible rust...

Shouldn't be very expensive, assuming that anyone in CA still does
work like this...

You may have already done this but check the position.alignment of the two 
microswitches on the motor plate.

>Will Hartje

This one isn't easy. I think you will need at least a 12 Volt power supply, 
bunch of jumper wires and quality multimeter to check this. The problem is 
that the "relay" senses the voltage level of several inputs to determine if 
it is safe to open the roof. I think that one of them includes wheel motion 
to allow opening. You may need to simulate the inputs. If you don't have a 
full specification for the device you need to work this out from the 
schematic.

I am not sure of the internal circuitry but it may need a output load to 
function correctly. It is basically an electronic switch with additional 
logic. Polarity of the measurements is important as is polarity of the 
supply. If you get the connections wrong you will probably blow the device.

There is a procedure in the factory manual to diagnose the roof. If I get a 
chance I'll dig it out.

I would get a replacement "used" from PartsHeaven or other and try that. If 
anyone has already been through the process and worked out the connections 
please let us know.

Hope this helps.

I couldn't take it any longer.  Following a fit a temporary insanity,
brought on by a spirited 30 minute test drive in a 993, I broke down and
ordered one a few weeks ago.  I now must do what I never figured I would:
sell our two 911's to pay for the new one.  This is very difficult.

I have owned 7 911's over 25 years and loved every one of them (as well
as a 66 912 and 59 356).  My all time favorite is the 88 turbo-look
below.  But the 89 coupe is hardly used and will make its new owner very
happy.  These were very good years for Porsche and the cars have proven
to be very durable.  If you know anyone interested please pass along the
word.  I will start to sell them seriously in December (ie, advertise them)
but until then it's word of mouth.  Both cars are very well cared for;
spared no expense in maintaining them.  Neither needs any work.

$28k: 88 factory turbo look targa.  Sticker shows $63k new (t-look $13.4k
option).  Incredible handling.  Unbelievable brakes (917).  Optional
diamond blue (silver/lavender metallic) paint.  Nearly perfect condition,
inside and out.  Full leather, full polished Fuchs (7 & 9's), painted crests,
HRS locks, upgrade Blaupunkt, 12 disk CD player, 4 channel Kenwood amp,
phone, never damaged in any way, new top, records, 3k oil changes. 115k
miles.  Looks and drives like new.

$29k: 89 coupe.  Sticker shows $58k new.   Silver anniv special (black
metallic, painted wheels to match, special leather console w/ gauges,
piping trim on seats, matching steering wheel, plush trunk carpet).
Factory short shifter, Autothority performance chip.  New RE71's on 7's
and 8's.  Parking lot fender-bender repaired by Porsche specialists
(BodyStyle, 10/93, *excellent work*). 3k oil changes.  36k miles.

Subject: skinny tires

OK tire and wheel experts, I have a series of questions:

I've got a '79 928 with stock ( i guess) wheels in a 7x16 size, phone-dial
type.  When I bought the car (I didn't do it!!) it came with a matched set of
T**-type tires, different sizes and manufacturers on front and rear.  What I
want to know is why someone would put on a smaller tire up front if the thing
understeers like a pig.  I guess I only notice the understeering when I'm
driving "with spirit" in autocrosses.  If I were a betting man, wouldn't I try
and get a bigger (more contact patch) type of tire to help alleviate the nasty
habit of understeer on the front?  The tire sizes are as follows:

front	7x16	205/55-16
back	7x16	255/50-16

I am planning on putting a bigger tire up front (255/50-16) but have no plans
to increase the rear tire size.  What is the widest tire that can be run safely
up front with no mods to the bodywork?

And is 7x16 a stock '79 928 front wheel size?

By the way, this car was purchased at a FBI Drug Seizure Auction about 1.5 years
ago.  That's why I don't know if this pig is stock or not.

Subject: Major DME problems! HELP needed!

Heeeeeeellllppp!

My shop has just transplanted a 3.2l into my old 2.7l targa, but
there is a SERIOUS problem: The engine is burning the DME control unit!

Not every time you turn the key, but about 1 out of 8 or something
like that. It has now shortcircuited 3 DME's and we're afraid to
install any more (it's pretty expensive little suckers - anybody
know how to repair these???)

Apparently car burns the DME when turning the key - NOT when driving. The 
car haven't even been driven hard before stopping the last time. When the 
DME is dead, it'll just open all fuel injectors all the time, flooding 
the engine completely with gas.

We've checked all ground connections to the engine. Furthermore we've 
changed the fuel injectors, the ingnition coil and the distributor just
to make sure.

The engine comes from another (former) 2.7l where there were no problems
at all.

Any ideas how to find out what the problem is?

We think that perhaps the starter doesn't have enough ground and somehow
pulls it through the DME hence burning it, but we've installed an extra
ground cable on the engine with no luck.

HEEELLLPPP!

Subject: Winders' Nitrogen tires... V5.1

Dear Scott, winders@porsche.support.apple.com

Soren LaForce said what I have already said twice and you keep ignoring :
your experts' explanations "did not discuss the vapor (partial) pressure of
water, which is what I believe to be the issue."

Your latest expert's calculations are great, but they AGAIN fail to consider
the main point : if there is "liquid" water in the tire. All his calculations
were only considering gases, and I agree that in this case the water content
does not make a difference. If there is liquid water in the tire more of it
will turn to gas at higher temperatures, and increase the tire pressure.

This time I will take the easy way out and ask the experts myself. Here
is the question :

Scott Winders asked you about using nitrogen in tires for racing in order
to have less pressure-buildup with heat. Your answers were good but
unfortunately Mr. Winders has never asked the question correctly. Liquid 
water is commonly spewed out of air compressors and builds up in racing tires
because they are filled and bled many times during their lives. I agree
that the percentage of WATER VAPOR in the tire makes no difference. But
if there is LIQUID WATER in the tire, then more of it will turn to its
gaseous state as the tire warms. This prediction (based on Le Chatelier's
principle which I explained to Mr. Winders) is consistent with the OBSERVED
FACT that the vapor pressure of a liquid increases as the temperature
increases.

Please let Mr. Winders (winders@porsche.support.apple.com) know if you
agree with me or not. Thank you for your time.

Subject: 914 engine removal, comments sought...

Hello all,

        Well I have finally undertaken the task of dropping the engine
/transmission assembly out of my new project '74 914. My primary
reason for this was to replace the transmission with a freshly rebuilt
one from parts heaven.
        I had a number of reasons to do all this. One, the tranny was
making a loud whiring sound in 3rd, 4th and 5th gears. I figured at
least one or two bad bearings, and I knew there were at least two bad
synchros. I also knew my clutch was bad. And I planned to try and
troubleshoot my overheating problems.
        With some help from fellow 914'er Dave Darling, we proceded to
find out exactly what was needed (and not needed) to drop the assembly
. I won't go into too many details to conserve bandwidth. But to sum
it up, the removal process took slightly over 5 hours for two people
who've never attempted it before. There were a few things that I'll
remark on however, If anybody has comments I'm open to hear 'em.
        One, don't bother with disconnecting the whole wiring harness and
all that, just unbolt the computer and let it come out with the engine
. Two, get the car as high off the ground as you can. I used ramps (
big ones) and with the throttle body and oil filler removed, It -JUST-
cleared the rear valence when I rolled it out on the floor jack with
one 2x4 under the engine. Three, and this is a good one, use two floor
jacks if you can. One on the engine and one on the tranny. And watch
those fuel lines when lowering the engine =8-o.

        Things I found when all was said and done:

On the tranny: lot's of grime ('nuff said). A huge amount of metal on
the drain plug magnet with only 700 or so miles since cleaned. A
totally fried flywheel. It was probably about 6 months away from
wearing all the way thru. All the linkage bushings were either worn or
cracked. The transmission mounts were also on their way out.

On the engine: lot's of grime... A leaking flywheel seal, NINE missing
blades on the fan! That would explain my overheating. Missing plugs
over the engine cowl (more overheating problems). A missing thermostat
, no big deal. 

        So, I plan on replacing the tranny mounts with the urathane
ones from Automotion, does anyone have comments about these. Should I
bother with them or stick with stock? Also, is there something that I
can do to the fuel lines to give them better clearance from the sheet
metal? 
        Any comments or suggestions on what I can do to make
instalation easier?

Thanks all,

When we called Gleason Torsen up trying to make a deal for them to make

the car is frying your DME's with too many amps.  Probably doesn't blow the

M. Christian Holmgreen -

This was posted to Porschephiles last May.  Perhaps it is your problem.
I would just go through the wiring diagram for the 3.2, and identify
the signals it expects at each of its pins.

Kevin Gross

 - - -

forwarded message from ken house:

This note is a caution to those people who are retrofitting a 3.2l  Carrera 
engine into an earlier model 911.  i just finished repairing two more DME 
(Motronic) control units that were damaged by incorrect wiring.  The cause 
of this particular failure mode has occurred so frequently that a word of 
warning is warranted.

Scenario: An early model 911 owner/racer buys a 3.2 motor with wiring 
harness and DME control unit, but usually does not buy the tachometer.  
Installation is straight-forward until the wires to the tachometer are 
encountered.  The Motronic tachs are microprocessor-based electronic units 
with two wires coming from the DME unit.  For some reason the wire to pin 
11 of the DME gets connected to a +12 volt line under the dash.  The 
installation gets completed, and the key is turned to start the car --zap-- 
it won't start.  After much time and trouble someone narrows the problem 
down to the DME unit, after a few phone calls they find out that i fix 
DME's and send it to me.

Cause/effect:  Incorrectly putting B+ voltage on pin 11 will BLOW the
proprietary Bosch injection controller chip on the analog board inside the 
DME and render it useless.  The car will turn over with the starter, the 
plugs will spark, the fuel pump will pressurize, but there will be no fuel 
injection.

Reason:   Pin 11 of the DME is an output not an input, it outputs  the fuel
injection pulse width as a 12 volt signal  TO the tach.  The special Bosch 
chip is an analog driver for both the injector stages and the tach.

Repairs:  The repair is easy--replace the chip.  The hard part is to obtain 
replacement chips.  If anyone has a connection to BOSCH to get chips i 
would be interested, or if you have DME problems give me a call.

Lugging? You want lugging? As a test, I recently was able to chug up a

at 800 or whatever it's supposed to have. I never touched the throttle, and
the driveway is about a 20-30 percent grade. Now THAT's engine management

Sounds like a classic case of bad warm-up regulator.  You say it is only 3
years old?  My '76 is on its third.  I've heard that these things are capable
of crapping out in amazingly short periods of time.  Before ordering, though,
run a control pressure test on the thing.  If you don't have the gauges, a
shop should be able to do it for you for about $20.  This test will tell for
sure whether it's the regulator or not.

Have fun,

Subject: 944 rear hatch

To continue a thread--
There are a couple of important points to be considered when dealing with the
rear hatch on the 944 series.
1. The electrical release or the use of the key ONLY is supposed to release
the hatch. It should NOT raise itself when this is activated.
2. The hood shocks provide two services. The prevent the hatch from raising
abruptly and once raised they prevent the hatch from coming back down without
your intervention.
3. If the hatch flies up on it's own accord, in an abrupt manner,  you are
going to end up with some expensive repairs. For instance the hinges and the
mounting for the hinges can break or become distorted. One poor sole told me
his hatch glass fractured when it hit the stops.
4. The point is the hatch should stay in place or rise up very gently when
the release is activated. Any other behavior is not acceptable.

This is not meant as a "flame" (pun intended) NotWise, but you can't "push"
amps into a load. If the DME boxes were defective (i.e. shorted internally),
then they could be drawing more amperage than desireable, but this is
unlikely with 3 different units. Also, it is difficult in a car to find more
than nominally +12 volts.

I suspect our friend's problem is simply a miswired harness for the
particular model DME he is using. I recall a posting here a few months ago
about DMEs from 3.6s and 3.2s, or some such combination. An input to one
model is an output on another. Very "friable" situation!

Tom,

Thanks for the info.  I didn't know that the PCA Club Racing editor
was out there in the e-world.

Yes, I think an upload of the newsletter would be cool.  However, I
don't have FTP access to the Internet and so would have to rely,
personally, on someone's forwarding it to me.

Related request:  I am not a racer, but I wrench on a number of racers'
cars.  F'rinstance, look in the new issue of Pano at the lead photo
in Ken F.'s story about the Bridgehampton race.  See the blue '69 911T
on the right?  Jerry and I rebuilt his engine that AM in the paddock,
after he missed a shift the previous day.  (He won.)

But do *we* ever see the newsletter?  Nooooo.  So, if there were any
way you could make its distribution available to us, way cool.  We'd
also probably be thrilled at the chance to pick up litte chachkis like
the decal and so forth.  We usually *do* manage to get t-shirts,
because Driver A (or B or C) standing around sorta bored and feeling
guilty that, once again, we are pulling his ashes from the fire,
buys them for us.

No flames here. I am firmly convinced that while the Germans can build
incredible cars, they cannot do diddley with car radios. That goes for
Blaupunkt and Becker. Beckers are even worse, IMHO, with all their
multi-function buttons and menus and stuff. Sure, after you've driven
around for a while with the radio manual open on your lap, you know how all
this works. But I think radio knobs should work intuitively.
 
The problem I've always had with Blaupunkt is the price/performance
tradeoff. The Japanese do it better, cheaper. But in a 911, I figure no
matter what you do, you're competing with a basically noisy engine
configuration anyway, big volumes for speakers are hard to find, and there's
no point in trying to get concert hall sound in a small sports car. So on
that basis I can tolerate Blaupunkt sound, if not the price.

Subject: Auto book prices

I just bought an interesting book, "High Performance: The Culture and
Technology of Drag Racing" by Robert C. Post. It's a well done, scholarly
work by the curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American
History. Publisher is Johns Hopkins University Press, it's one in the Johns
Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology series. How's that for going
mainstream? How about a doctoral thesis on the psychography of PCA members?
Or the flame wars on Internet?
 
Anyway, the point of all this is that the latest Motorbooks flyer is on
the current toilet reading stack, and I just saw it in there for $35.95. Add
to that shipping and tax (yes, I have to pay tax although I'm in CA and
they're in WI; their masters are in CA) and we're talking $40 plus. I just
got mine from the local Barnes & Noble; it took one day to order, and the
discounted price is $28.76. With tax, $30.99.
 
That's a 20% saving, closer to 25% if you count shipping. I used to order
a lot from Motorbooks, but they stopped giving volume discounts so now I
buy from Autobooks in Burbank (same price, no shipping) or the local
bookstores. I still get my books, I get them cheaper, and more of the
money stays in the local economy.

Subject: Referee!

Has anyone out there in P-phile land gone through the (California) referee
process with regards to getting your baby smogged?

A little background:  This is a 1977 911S that I bought in 1988.  It was
already on its second engine when it came into my possession, and,
naturally, the thermal reactors and air pump were conveniently left off.
The previous owners provided me with a smog certificate, and, yes, told me
that the emissions stuff was missing.

A little more background:  I've successfully smogged the car twice before.
Obviously the establishments didn't quite know what to look for in the
visual, but the sniffer part was honestly passed.  Says a lot for the value
of those thermal afterburners, doesn't it?

OK, it didn't work this last time.  I tried to play dumb, but no cigar.  I
think I'd rather just do the Referee thing and get it over with.  Or do I?
What can I expect, given my circumstances?  Will the head linesman throw a
flag, blow his whistle and say, "Sorry, you have to rebuild your engine and
make it smog legal."?  Yeah, YOU tell my wife!

Thanks for any insight anyone can offer.

Speaking of clocks, I notice the digital LCD clock in my '86 944 has no
backlight. Is it supposed to light up at night when the parking lights are
switched on? If so, is it possible to replace the bulb? It's hard to
believe Porsche would put in an unlighted clock.

   I finally got my sunroof operating perfectly (knock on wood).
The problem was the sunroof relay. New relay is expensive but
I picked up a used relay from a fellow list member George of 
944 Ecology. I must remind you that another fellow list member
Jim Pasha had an article in Excellence magazine on the subject of
buying used Porsche parts and he adviced against buying used
electrical parts.

I tend to agree with Jim but if you can pick one up relatively cheap
(i.e $10-$20) then I must say you should go for it. An ideal situation
would be to find a used part dealer locally, where you can check the
relay in your car and ensuring a proper sunroof operation. This will save
you shipping charges along with the satisfaction that you paid for
something that resolved the problem.

If luck is NOT on your side and you end up burning the used relay than
think of the money spent, as cost of trouble shooting and isolating the 
problem. Then replaced the relay with a new one. 

 I did opened my old relay, it has two circuit boards and a few,
what looks like a micro-processor. One of the resistor and the attach
point on the PC board looks burned ( dark area on the PC board ) but
thats about the extent of my trouble shooting. I think that without the
schematic it is going to be tough job but I am planning to tackle it
in future.

PS> With all the 944 owner having this problem I am wondering if Porsche,
	North America is aware of this problem and has there ever been a reall
	of this relay by Porsche?


Regards,
Husain.

Hi, Chris,

Yes the digital lcd clock in the series II 944s are backlit.  Bulb
replacement is not a trivial task, but can be done.

Steve Ross of Northeast Region PCA wrote an article for their newsletter a
couple of years ago about a procedure to replace the bulb, but I don't have
a copy.

Plan on $3 for the bulb and 100 for the labor, unless you do it yourself.

Hi, Phil.
 
Here's what happened, to the best of my recollection.
 
1) Porsche built what, 20 cars for Carrera Cup. Cars were brought in as
street legal machines.
2) Andial gutted the cars, installed roll cages to make them racers.
3) Series never happened.
4) Roll cages were cut out of cars to return them to street status.
5) Cars were eventually sold off. Many customers wanted the roll cages back
in them, so in they went again.
 
I would suggest that your reader contact Andial directly. If they don't have
any cages left over, I'm sure they still have the drawings and would be
happy to make a fresh copy for him and install it. Andial is sort of the
factory U.S. west coast skunk works. They have a very close relationship to
the factory racing department. I've stopped by there and found Porsche
executives "just looking around. We're on vacation." Uh-huh.

Hi, Bart - 

Had to get back to you about the 'clubbiness' of the porschers
at Wiesbaden, back then. It wasn't too long after your tenure
there in '63-'65 that Gen. David Jones, CINC USAFE, (can you
spell as***le) decreed that the entire headquarters unit be
moved to Ramstein AB. You know as well as I do that that is
like moving from New York City to Peoria. So they got their
comeuppance. Seems that when I was at Ramstein, '75-'79, one
of my NCOs was (gasp!) a member of the local club and was
having a great time in his 356. It was still going strong
when Pete said he atteneded some events down at Zweibruken 
in the early '80's. So justice does seem to have been served.
(Except that Davy Jones became Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
after the USAFE tour which solidly proves the adage of the

Dear Sir,

I've been exposed to different Blaupunkts over the past
2 decades or so and I cannot, to this day tell if they are
any good. Every car, 3 Rabbits, 1 GTI, 1 Campmobile,
2 Vanagons and 944 porch, has drowned out everything
except Jimmy Page doing his great riff in "Black Dog".
The one exception was the brand new '88 Volvo 244:
not bad for $623 option! And it worked fine until a 
daughter rammed her 'New Boys on the Block' tape into
it and jammed it permanently. It was still under 
warranty so the dealer reluctently replaced it. The
very next day, my soon-to-be-ex- totaled the whole
car! My last adventure with said brand was after getting
the 944, I immediately replaced the orginal Bpkt with
the Chicago (?) that played CDs. Misss-take. The CD skipped
so bad I thought I was back at a sock-hop and the damn
tuner buttons were hard to see there on the bottom of
the stack. Well after about 8 months of it sitting a
couple inches away from the exhaust, the CD mechinism
was toasted and wouldn't work anyway. Then some dumbs**t
stole it (it was a pop-out) and I got the insurance
money for it!
But I think the thing I won't forget is turning that 
brand new Blaupunkt over when I got it and seeing that
it was made in Taiwan! 
Sorry to go on but I'm glad to see that the 'mystique'
of the German radio being as good as the car is not true.

Hi, Tom,

For the 86 944 Turbo, two wheel arrangements were available\:

7x16 Front, 8x16 Rear Fuchs Forged Wheels
7x16 Front, 8x16 Rear Cast Phone Dial Wheels.

Those wheels were equipped with a 23.3 mm offset (that number can be found
on the inside of the wheel center - e.g. ET 23.3).  Wheels for 1987 and
later cars used a 52.3 mm or 65 mm offset and should not be used on the 86 or
earlier cars.

Mike, 
Bruce Anderson expressed the same feelings to me and I forwarded them to my
subscriber. Thanks!

PML has listed about a dozen 74 Carreras in the last 2 issues ranging from a
low price of $10k for one needing work to a high of $19750 for a flawless,
low mileage car with PCA concours history.
Most of them are between $12 - $16k which says to me that the prices you're
seeing in Pano are about right! Hope that helps.

The sender on the cam oil line boss is for oil pressure, not the oil

My sum knowledge of differentials comes from reading "The Racing

In case any of this makes it through the relevant subscribers, or in case 
any of you happen to have other correspondence with any listmembers at SAIC, 
I thought might share this tidbit with you.

It is common for all-of-a-sudden mail to stop working to everyone at
a particular company or institution. It usually has as a root cause
someone having reconfigured something, and can be quickly fixed once
the necessary people know about it. So, when I started having significant
trouble with mail to the half-dozen SAIC employees  on the list it didn't
bother me too much. When it didn't let up in a day or so, I decided to
send the usual polite note to the postmaster *and* root at SAIC since
that way at least someone would get the message. Started off "Gentlemen"
since it was going to two people, etc.

In response, I get this:

> First of all, the postmaster here is not a gentleman, I am a woman.
> Secondly, since this is not a business related issue for SAIC I will not
> devote any time to look into this problem.  Delete these users or send them

So, in the event that I have to drop the people at SAIC, that's what 
happened. This is the *FIRST* time I've been dealt with in such a manner.
Just an FYI.

Subject: Re: 914 keys.

When I bought my 914 (NEW!), it came with two sets of keys:  One black,
which would open EVERYTHING, and one red one, which was the valet key.
It would unlock the doors, and start the car.  It would not unlock the
trunks, or the glovebox.

Upon examination, the keys were IDENTICAL, except the red one had an
extra notch in the top of the key, apparently made into the key blank,
so it would be possible to take the black key to a dealer, and get
another valet key cut, or vice versa.

(Lost my valet key years ago!)

I found this in the archives for those who are interested in changing

I will be doing this soon also. Mine jus went.

****************************************************************************

Subject: Replacing 944/951 clock bulbs        (Friday  Dec.4  1992)


I got a number of requests for my offered procedure for replacing the
clock bulb in 944/951s.  Since this seems to be a fairly common
problem, I would like to post it here, at least for the sake of our
archives.

 -Milo

____________________________________________________________________________

My approach to replacing the clock bulb in an 85.5+ 944 (inc. Turbo)
involves removing (at least partially) the part of the dash that
contains the hazard flasher switch, clock module and cigarette
lighter.  This is a long plastic strip that is attached to the dash at
four points.  To remove it:

1.  Remove the plastic plate that covers the heating/AC control unit
in the dash.  To do this, you must first pull off the knobs on the two
slider switches that control the vents that send air to your feet and the
windshield.  These are just pressed on and will come off with
a gentle tug.  The control unit face plate is also just pressed on,
and can be removed by gently prying it out with a screwdriver or putty
knife at several points.  Take your time with this, since the plate is
not very thick at some points and is easy to crack if bent too much.
After you have the plate off, unscrew the four Philips head screws
that mount the heating/AC control unit to the dash.  Slide the control
unit out about 1" to get it out of the way a bit (it is not necessary
to disconnect or remove it).

2.  Locate the passenger compartment temperature sensor, which is
under the round, 5-slotted grate immediately to the right of the
cigarette lighter.  Remove the grate by inserting a coin and rotating
the grate counterclockwise until it pops out.  Remove the small
Philips head screw underneath the sensor hole.

3.  Continuing to the right along the dash, locate the (approx .5" x
1.5") rectangular cover plate to the left of the side vent.  Gently
pry this plate off using the slot at the bottom.  Underneath, you will
see two Philips head screws that you will also remove.

4.  Finally, open the passenger side door and observe that the end of
the dash is covered by a plastic plate attached by a Philips head
screw at its center.  Remove the screw and the plate.  This will allow
you to then remove the last Philips head screw attaching the end of
plastic strip we are wanting to remove.

At this point, the only things holding the strip (other than a snug
fit) are the electrical connections to the hazard flasher switch,
clock, cigarette lighter (and its light bulb).  It is probably best to
go ahead and disconnect all of these so that you can completely remove
the strip and have easy access to the back of the clock (which comes
out with the strip).  You might be able to sneak a new bulb into the
clock with some of these connections still attached, depending on your
dexterity.

The clock bulb has a "squarish" base that protrudes from the back of
the clock module.  Simply rotate it 90 degrees, remove and replace it.
I'm not sure how common these bulbs are.  I got mine from an
independent repair shop, but dealers should definitely have it.

As they say "installation is the reverse of removal" :-).

Subject: 944 steering vibrations


Hi,

last time I had my steering vibrating on 
the highway, my mechanic told me that my front
suspensions needed to be changed. So it was 
diagnosed and so it was repaired. The vibrations 
were gone for 2 years and a half... 

Now the vibrations are back. I've been told that 
Montreal "roads" (i.e. pothole sequences) are 
capable of destroying suspensions within 2 years.

Could this be the case or is there other ailments 
associated with this symptom?

Regards,
Andre Rotchel.

    Several years ago, I was at Delco's radio/test engineering facility
  in Kokomo, and ran across the guy who tested OEM cassette transports
  (of course, Delco buys these). Who made the best transport ? "Clarion".
  Who made the worst ? "Blaupunkt".
    Nearly every Porsche I've ever bought had a Blaupunkt in it, and they
  were -all- broken. In the mid-70's at least, Blaupunkt only guaranteed
  their tape decks with 60-minute cassettes, when 90 minutes was already
  the standard. with such experience I'll never get close to their CD unit.
    I agree also with Pete's assessment of ambient noise; an audiophile
  and a Porschephile cannot simultaneously exist. It is downright
  silly to talk about CD-quality signal-to-noise ratio and 96DB dynamic
  range in a 911 (there is some hope in a 928 or maybe a 944). I tried
  before with extra amps,eq, speakers in all corners, but as soon as you turn
  the key its all wasted effort.

    I learned this talking to Stan about (almost) the same subject quite a
while
ago:  Stan's definition of "not too hard" is *not* the same as others' (mine,
for
instance).
    It shouldn't be too bad (maybe) if you *start* with 2.0L heads and
exhaust.
But those are the priciest bits, so you might as well go with the full 2.0L
FI,
right?  Putting 2.0L P&C's on the 1.8L case/heads/etc is non-trivial. 
Something
about deck height requires machining the case or the cylinders...  I don't
re-
member the details, sorry.  Not at all hard for Stan, but not something I
wanted
to pay someone else to tackle for me.  (I don't build 914 racers regularly
for
fun...)
    If I remember correctly, Stan told me that the AFC FI from the 1.8L would
work fine with 2.0L displacement, even with higher ("Euro") compression.  So
if
you can do/have the machining done, it may then turn into a "bolt-on"
operation.

Hi Steve,

Those of us lucky to have been Cold-warriors, and even more fortunate to
have been stationed in Dear old Deutschland got quite a rude awakening when
we learned that every male German citizen, upon graduation from middle
school, is issued a brief-case; pre-stocked with a loaf of (great) bread, a
kilo of fantastic Wurst (of his choice, depending on the state he resides
in), and (at least) two half-liter flip-top bottles of Local Bier.

I'm fairly certain that this is *Guaranteed* by the German Constitution,
that also mandates regular breaks during the work day, during which the
contents of said brief-case, representing that which is good and wholesome
in life, are to be savored in the appropriatly reverential and grateful
spirit.  Then, again, I could be as full of sh*t as a Christmas turkey,
who's to say...???

Kevin:

This is snake oil sold in the USA. The plug has the tip of the electrode
split into a "Y". No other differences. It's heavily marketed on TV. THe
price is about 5X what a normal brand name plug list. They also sell their
own brand of plug wire -- with, you guessed it, two parallel wires going
from distributor to plug. Pure marketing hype -- think of it as the Zymol
of spark plugs; the Duralube of spark plug; or the Slick-50 of spark plugs.

Seriously.  I think I remember someone on the list a while ago noting

What a fun weekend we just had at the PCA Time Trial/Drivers Ed on the IMSA

Saturday morning greeted the 99 cars entered with uncharacteristic rain 
which kept the slick-equipped racers in the garage for the first two 
practice sessions. While us low life street legal types waltzed all over the 
track.

The field consist of a broad cross section of  Porsches from old tired daily 
drivers with numbers slapped on the doors to race prepped  914 s and 911 s 
to  Tom Congleton s exotic collection , a 906., a 907 and a 917K

By midday the track was dry and out came the likes of Martin Snow (lapping 
at 1.03) and Tom Congleton s exotics  As the weather improved the times 
quickened and at the end of the day POC ran a club race in their series. The 
incident du jour was when Martin Snow got inside the 917K at turn 2 and 
nudged  the $1,000,000 plus vintage race car into a spin. Fortunately, the 
contact was only with the tire of the 917k but the nose of Snow s 911 was 
well knocked about forcing him out of a race that he was leading by nearly a 
lap conceding  the race to a yellow and black  race prepared  914-6 ( sorry 
I don t have the entry list so I can t give you his name) .

Sunday was cold, - yes cold!, but dry. The rain threatened but never 
materialized. There were two more practice session s before the timed runs 
were started. The time trials were completed by early afternoon and POC 
again put on club racing. Snow gave another driving exhibition clocking at 
least one lap in the 1.02 s but the star of the race was the vintage 907 
that started near the back of the field and came storming through the pack 
to take second place on the penultimate lap of the race, Snow was way to far 
ahead to be caught.

It was a great weekend from both a participation and viewing perspective, 
Both the PCA and POC crowd are friendly and helpful. There is much you can 
learn from just wandering round the pits and talking to people, not to 
mention what you can learn out on the track.

To those of you that have been ,asking about drivers ed and racing, I 
thoroughly recommend you get out to one of these events soon.  -It s a blast 
and a great education. For those of you within driving distance of Phoenix, 
we will be out there again in February

Hi, 
 
              I has spend the weekend driving around skyline and 
              Mt. Hamilton (bay area, CA) and had the oppurtunity 
              to do some spirited driving on the fast twisty roads 
              The suspension and brakes were under some load (tires 
              squealing etc...). After the drive, I noticed a thin 
              black oily film on both the front wheels (the car 
              was washed just before the drive). I had noticed the 
              oil on the wheels before but was very little and over 
              a long period of time/driving. There is no significant 
              drop in any oil levels but I am not sure. What could be 
              the reason? Any help would be appreciated. 
 
              PS: I flashed at a couple of 911's on the twisties but 
              they didn't even blink their eyes back ;-)

'64 912!??  Was that a typo?  I thought 912s were first made in '65.
Could this be a '64 911 converted to use a VW engine?

    One.  Well, okay, I guess the "valet key" might be the second one,
but there should be one key that does all the locks.  My 74 914s came
with two keys for the 1.8L, four (!!!) for the 2.0L.  The 1.8 is down
to 1 key, the 2.0 down to 2.  And that'll go to one key whenever I
get 'round to taking the trunk pull out.  (yech!)
    If the car's been broken into, the drivers and ignition may very
well be replacements.  But the doors and rear trunk locks are nearly
trivial to remove.  E-mail me for details.  I got quotes of $10-15
per lock to re-key them to a specific key (my ignition key).

Subject: 911 option codes -- where listed on car?

Hi

Where are the option codes listed on my '83 911? I bought it used and
I'd like to know what suspension option it came with, because it's got
Bilstein (green) shocks installed.

I'm wondering if the car came from the factory with Bilstein shocks and
the appropriate torsion bars and anti-roll bars, or if the Bilsteins were
added later without upgrading the suspension.

So I guess my other question is, can I tell by looking at the struts,
torsion bars, and/or anti-roll bars, what type they are and whether they're
matched to the Bilsteins?

Actually, even if I *do* have the big torsion bars, can I put softer shocks
on the front and back and get a slightly softer ride, or must I change to
the softer torsion bars and/or anti-roll bars?

Thanks in advance!
Stefan

Sreelal,

I suspect, especially since the "oil" appears on both front wheels, that what
you see is a combination of pad dust from your dirty factory pads combined
with road grim,oil/tar.  You might want to dry some non-factory type pads,
like Repco DeLuxe and Metalmaster pads to reduce the wheel grime.

Hi Herb, Jim, Phello Philes,

Good to hear from you, thanks for jogging my (alleged) memory!

> Had to get back to you about the 'clubbiness' of the porschers
> at Wiesbaden, back then. 

You know, I got to thinking about this business and remembered something I
had long forgotten.  One of the most obnoxious guys in Wiesbaden turned out
to be a pretty nice guy when I ran into him 3 or so years in Saigon. I had
just arrived in Tan Son Nhut in May of '68, just a few weeks after the
shooting had stopped (more or less) from Tet and ran into him at the USAF
O'club.  He spoke to me first, as I hadn't recognized him at first.  We had
a couple of drinks at the bar, and he asked me where I was staying.  I told
him I had just arrived about 30 min prior to meeting him, and planned to
stay in the VOQ.  He offered me a place in the house he was sharing with 4
other AF Officers, as soon as the current "short-timer" rotated, which was
a week away.  I took him up on the offer, and lived there for about 6
months.

It was a pretty good base to get to know Saigon from.  The house shared
side walls with the houses on both sides (a town-house) and was 4 stories
high, with the fourth floor having a single large bedroom and attached
bathroom. The rest of the floor was Penthouse terrace, covered with terrazo
pavers and included a T-shapped Khoi pond, about two feet deep and a meter
wide. The shaft and top of the T were about 13 meters each, and the pool
complete with a good number of *large* Khoi, 12 to 24 inchers (!).

The AF had obviously occupied that house for several years, there was an
elaborate, thached-roofed bar with stools, refridgerator and three-burner
electric stove; and a large steel column out in the middle of the terrace
piercing a circular hand-made aluminum table top about 10 feed in diameter,
and supporting a large parasol roof, about 15 feet in diameter, to shelter
us from the monsoon.  Each evening, we'd gather around the table as we
dutifuly took our daily anti-malarial quinnine (suitably fortified with gin
or vodka) and watched the war go on around us.  Darkness would fall, Hueys
would start flying the perimeter of Saigon, probing the night with their
searchlights, and streams of orange tracers would rise from the ground
seeking them out like a bunch of glowing streams of water.  These, in turn,
would be answered by similar earth-bound streams from the Cobra gun-ships.
We had front-row seats, far enough from the action to be able to enjoy it,
and high enough and close-enough to appreciate it!  A civilized way to do a
war, to be sure.

Subject: Club Racing 

There have been several e-mail notes recently about PCA racing -- as a note from 
a novice whose initiation was this past weekend (rainy Saturday, dry Sunday) at 
Phoenix International Raceway -- GO FOR IT!  

You get 2 hours of raceway driving on day 1, an hour on day 2 plus the thrill of 
the timed laps.  There's lots of good Porsche-speak and Porsche-friends, too.

Special thanks to Phil Ryan (a e-porschephiler, too) and all who organized the 
PIR time trials.  In addition, there were POC cup races as well.  Both days, 
drivers and spectators managed to see lots of beautiful Porsches, including a 
906, a 907, and a 917  (no typos, you read it right).  In fact, the event T-
shirt featured the nose of the 917 in a rear-view mirror with the slogan "Toto, 
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore".

So, if you've been thinking about it, try it out. Also, some of the other clubs 
may invite your local PCA to join to halp in cost-sharing.  So you have several 
avenues, so to speak. 

And to all porschephiles in or around or just motoring through Zone 8, the next 
scheduled event will be in February and there will be a porschephiles posting.

Subject: Distributor Mechanical Advance - Update


I discovered something this weekend that might be useful 
to those of you with early 911's.  This is an interim report.

In my previous posting about slop in the mechanical 
advance mechanism I speculated that there must be a 
nylon bushing on the spring retainr studs that had worn 
away.  I contemplated making one if someone could 
confirm its existence on a good distributor, or bending the 
stud to take up the slop.  Well...no one confirmed its 
existence.  Actually, no one unconfirmed it either...

But, if you go to the trouble of pressing out the gear pin 
and removing the gear so you can slide the entire 
mechanism out of the distributor case, you will have 
access to the bottom of the advance mechanism, and 
surprise, surprise, there are two screws there that allow 
you to move the spring studs to take up any slack in the 
springs.  Which I did.

The reason this is an interim report is that I don't yet have 
it back on the car, so I am not 100% sure everything's OK.  
But it's looking very good.  Stay tuned.

RWR AutoX
    Yup, you guessed it, another event up at the Sonoma County
Airport this past weekend.
    This one was a long course--TTOD was in the low 51's.  Hank
Watts, as usual.  He keeps bringing out his 69 E ("the Elf")
racer--I think he didn't want to lose to Scott Winders again ;-)
It was a tight battle, which wasn't decided until Hank's last
run of the day.  Unfortunately, I forget who he was battling
against...  Third place, and TTOD for much of the morning, was 
our own Eric Nichols, in his white 912--feels good to see a four-
banger placing so highly.  Bill Newton, another fast 912 pilot,
commented that Eric "is so smooth, it took him three years to wear
out his first set of tires!"
    Unfortunately, I slept through my alarm (long night...) and
missed the morning session.  Sigh...  My times were less than stel-
lar, with a 59.3 being my best official run.  My one fun run wound
up with a 58.1, and I know that there was a lot left out there.
One person (who I'm told had only been to a couple of autoXes) com-
plimented me on my smooth driving.  Smooth?  I don't know.  But I
do know that I wasn't *nearly* agressive enough, and I was *way*
off my apexes--almost five feet in one or two places...  Sigh.  I
was still trying to figure out where the course was, I guess.
    More good news, Ray Scruggs was back with his silver 914/6.
You may recall that he bent it at the last Sonoma event.  Well, it
turned out to be not nearly as serious as it looked.  It did take
a number of hours on the frame machine, but according to Ray, it's
straighter now than it was before this whole adventure.
    He went down to the shop to pay the bill, and was told that,
"Someone came down earlier with a check.  It's covered."  It seems
that Certain Parties (who shall remain nameless) got together a col-
lection to help Ray with the bill--and to everyone's surprise, the
collection pretty much covered the whole thing.  The joy on Ray's
face as he related this was really nice to see.
    Damn, what a good group of people we belong to!  [Dave sprains
his arm trying to pat himself on the back...]
    Next Redwood event is November 5, again at the Sonoma County
Airport.  E-mail me for directions.  Unfortunately, I won't be there,
as I have a wedding in Illinois to attend on that date.  Too bad.

Subject: 914 Idle

Hi,

I picked up your message about 914 idle speed.

1400 RPM is too high. 850-900 is right. 

If this just happened to you, after it idled correctly for some time, then
I would suspect either a loose air hose or the Aux Air Regulator (AAR). But
first check your idle speed setting by turning the screw on the throttle
body (after you take off your air filter housing). Make sure that the car
is warmed up, then adjust. If you cannot lower, then check that all air 
hoses are connected.  

Also check your throttle spring; if it is old and corroded, and the idle 
does eventually get back to 900, but verrry slowly get a new one at a 
Porsche dealer!

If the hoses are connected,spring is good, and the idle adjust doesn't
help, then check the Aux Air Regulator. (1400 sounds just like mine when
the AAR failed...) It is kind of tucked behind the dipstick and looks like
a teacup with two hose attachments of top: One of these goes into the air
filter unit. With the air filter unit off, the hose from the Aux Air Reg will
be open at that end. A correctly working AAR will be closed (no air
drawing through this hose) once the engine is warm. 

If open, then note: The AAR's evidently fail a lot after 20 years...I had
a heck of a time finding one used, and they are not made any more. If you
live in a warm place, put a plug in the hose: The AAR will then never act
open, and the car will idle right once warmed up (a little harse until
then). If you live in a cold place, then first check out the electrical
connection to the AAR; one red wire, should get 12V with engine running.
If if does, then take out the AAR, spray some HD40 into the top, put it in
a can with 1 inch of HD40 (or similar) overnight, and the next day, tap it
gently on top. It may unfreeze. (Mine did not!) You can test it by putting
it on 12V and then you can see the inside piston close in a circular
way... 

If you really need one (cold climate, HD40 no help), call Rich at High
Perf.  Products in Redwood city, he has tested units: $75. OR Jay of
PartsWerks in Chicago; first one he sent me wasn;t tested, next one was
and worked too: $45. but more hassles. These were *$150* new.

Mark

PS Stan, hope I didn't miss anything...I should know about this...and by
the way, Performance Products had the best price I could find in the USA
for new Bosche 914 2.0L 73/74 Injectors -- $59. And in stock too! Car 
should be running again on Weds. Thanks for the help.

	Hi Philers, 

	I've been a read only subscriber to this list on and off now
for the last year, but figured it was time to post. You see I'm
buggered if I can remember how long ago it was that a 911 became the
car I always wanted, seems like forever. Well, I'm posting to announce
that the wait is over. Today, after a couple of months of searching, I
picked up a black 78 911SC...it's mint and it screams... Any ideas on
how to tell whether it's a boy or a girl :-)  

	I look forward to sharing in the wealth of knowledge I've seen
flying across the wires in this group!

Subject: RE: Vibration and Lugging


Mr. Lupien is correct, the top wnd of the rod and the wrist pin take
a big hit when the engine is lugged. Also, just FYI, the pistons
slap the cylinder walls head enough to consider it family violence.
Seriously, this is what causes piston skirt wear and cylinder wall 
scuffing.

Mr. Myers, 
I am sorry that all this talk about vibration go to you. I know a 
lady with a '59 Borgward that says it vibrates erotically. She loves 
to offer rides to anyone willing to help her with the problem. Frankly, 
I could never see anything erotic about a Borgward except the name
Isabella. That was on a night in Barcelona many years ago.....

I hate any vibration in my Porsches. It takes away from the 
pure experience of driving by suggesting mere sex. These days I can 
drive much longer (*sigh*).

You're going to get a portion of this population

|               I has spend the weekend driving around skyline and

|               to do some spirited driving on the fast twisty roads
|               The suspension and brakes were under some load (tires
|               squealing etc...). After the drive, I noticed a thin
|               black oily film on both the front wheels (the car
|               was washed just before the drive). I had noticed the
|               oil on the wheels before but was very little and over
|               a long period of time/driving. There is no significant
|               drop in any oil levels but I am not sure. What could be
|               the reason? Any help would be appreciated.

If it was a dust coating, then it would be brake pad dust and nothing
to worry about.

If it is indeed an oily fluid, how thick is it? A thin fluid would indicate
leaking caliper seals. In this case, an immediate caliper rebuild
is indicated.

If it is thick, it could be bearing grease. If the wheel bearing seals
were bad and the bearings/hub had heated up, then it would be possible
to throw grease. If the bearings run out of grease, they fail and then
your wheels fall off. Car control degrades once the wheels fall off. <insert
obligatory smiley>

If it were either bearing grease or brake fluid, it would be a bit of a
coincidence for both sides to fail simultaneously. But stranger
things have happened.

This may be true for the Split Fire Plugs but the Bosch Tri-electrode
plugs work *very well* on my 84 911.  Audi uses them as OEM on thier
turbos and I hear they're standard on new VWs as well.  I understand
they were designed to eliminate extinguishing spark in high boost
applications.  This is all "here-say" mind you, but others on the Audi
Quattro net swear by them.  I use them in in both of our Audis as
well.  I've tried the platinums plugs but the Tri-electrodes are definetly
better.  Sorry, I have no imperical data to back this with, the cars
just seem to run better, smoother idling, better cold starts etc... 
For those of you with turbos, I would highly recommend trying them.  
Anyone else try them yet?

Text item: Text_1

     Dear Porsche folks,
     
     I hope this is the right place to do this.  If not, apologies, and I'd 
     appreciate knowing the proper place.
     
     I've decided to part with my '71 914-6.  It has just over 50k miles on 
     the odo.
     
     It is a conversion with a '69 911 carburetted (Webers with Watershield 
     covers) motor.  About 8k miles ago the pistons and cylinders were 
     replaced with new 2.2 liter, 911E parts and the heads were rebuilt.  A 
     couple of months ago I added the hydraulic tensioner upgrade.  The 
     motor is very strong (~150 hp) and smooth, making the car very quick 
     and a pleasure to drive.  It has heavier-than-stock springs and Koni 
     shocks (I'm not sure about the sway bar), braided steel brake and oil 
     lines, an MSD/CD system (not the musical kind), and a new Bursch 
     exhaust.  The exhaust has heat exchangers, so the heater works.  It 
     has a short-shifter kit, and naturally, the tach was rebuilt for the 
     6-cylinder motor.  California smog legal with current certificate and 
     registration.
     
     It has an upgraded interior with the adjustable passenger seat, new 
     black carpet and seats, and gray door panels.  The center console 
     holds oil pressure and oil temperature gauges, a clock, an 
     am/fm/cassette stereo, an equalizer, and Clifford AND Alpine alarm 
     systems.  There are two tops (one with a tinted Plexiglas panel in 
     it), and both types of parking brake handles.  (The original, 
     retractable type is installed.  The other is in a box.)
     
     It has beautiful red paint, excellent chrome bumpers, Porsche nose 
     badge, 15" Rivera wheels with almost-new low-profile tires, and the 
     plastic thing that says "PORSCHE" between the tail lights.  I replaced 
     the plastic, crushable trunk rollers with bronze ones.
     
     The price is $9k firm.  There is another 914-6 conversion in the local 
     Auto Trader for $10,500 and there is an original 914-6 in AutoWeek for 
     $17k, so I think $9k is quite reasonable.  There's more to the car 
     than I can list here, and there's no way this car could be built for 
     $9k.  (I've probably gone on long enough, but I really love the car.)  
     This is a rare opportunity to buy a car someone ELSE has sunk tons of 
     time and money into.  :-)
     
     Please send any inquires directly to me at holl@priacc.com.
     
     Thanks,

If you are calling out of California the way to get wholesale+tax
prices is to call 1-800-523-2408 but you MUST ask for Linda or Butch in
the parts department.  They are aware of this group and have agreed
to sell at wholesale only if you identify yourself as a member of
this group.

Just for the record.  Carlsen Porsche/Audi/VW is located in 
Palo Alto, California.  Linda is a veteran of the parts department
there.  I've been buying wholesale parts from her for over
10 years and asked here to extend the privelage to this group.
All you need to do is mention the Quattro internet group(this group).
Thats what I call it anyway.  They don't always have the best prices
but for a lot of dealer only parts, Lindas prices are hard to beat.
btw, if you forget to mention the group you *will* get a retail price.

I've spoken with the owner of Carlsen about this group, and Linda has 
cleared this arrangment with her manager.  Hopefully someday other dealerships
will catch on and lower thier prices too.  But don't hold your breath.

Linda drives a Porsche 356 and is married to a highly skilled
factory trained Porsche mechanic. (he works on my car now and then)
Even though they are mostly a Porsche family, she has talked about
buying a newer Quattro in the future.

Subject: '83 928 heater always on

I'm posting this for a friend that owns a "hot" '83 928S.

He's already looked through the factory manual microfiche for help.

If anyone has any advice, either post it to the list or e-mail directly
to me.  

Thanks,

John Wright   jpw@sr.hp.com

****************************************************************

Can anyone help me solve a heater ventilation problem on an '83
Porsche 928S?

Normally, the automatic climate control (ACC) system on the 928S
would provide fresh air ventilation in the ECON mode. Recently
however, the ACC would always blow hot air through the passenger
vents in the ECON mode (heat setting was set to COLD). Turning
the ACC to AUTO (A/C) mode did not help since the A/C could not
offset the hot air coming from the heater unit.

I discovered that the heater control valve for the heater was not closing
 -- thereby always letting hot water flow to the heater core and producing
hot air in the passenger compartment. I verified that the heater
control valve was faulty by manually applying 18 psi vacuum to
the heater control valve. An 18 psi vacuum would close the valve
and eliminate the hot air. I tested the vacuum from the ACC
central diaphram and measured only 15 psi -- apparently not enough
to close the heater control valve.

At this point, I suspect three causes:

   A) Could the vacuum system be not generating normal vacuum?
   B) Could the interior and/or exterior temperature sensor in the 
      ACC be reading wrong and causing this problem? 
   C) Is it possible that the heater control valve has gotten "sticky" 
      and now needs more vacuum to operate?  


Thanks.

Racecar Engineering is indeed a good read, esp. for the Formula 1 fans

They have a split tip that you are led to believe fires two sparks

Subject: timing belts

Here is some information that may be helpful to porsche owners in the future.
As i understand it 944s have a lot of problems with timing belts. Currently
these timing belts are made by Pirelli(sp?) (PTI) and supplied O.E. to porsche.
About a year ago the division of pirelli that makes belts and hoses was
purchased by Dayco Products Inc. Dayco is the largest O.E. suppliers of
belts and hose as well as one of the largest aftermarket suppliers. As part of
this purchase the pirelli name could only be use for one year. The one year is
almost over and the pirelli name will no longer be used(as far as i know). As
part of Daycos new 94 part numbers for the aftermarket are timing belts for
porsche 944,968 and 928.(these were previously unavalible from dayco)
I was unable to find out if these belts are made by in the pirelli plant or
somewhere else( they also purchased another itilian timing belt manufactuer
at about the same time). The belts made by pirelli have a "dimple" at the
bottom of each tooth. I also could not find out if these belts are made to the
exact spec. as O.E.. The timing belts for these cars in the aftermarket are
quite a bit less expensive ($40 compared to $200). I will try and get more info
but its difficult because the plant is overseas. These may be a less expensive
belt that mactches O.E. quality. In the future the timing belts should not
have the pirelli name(as of some time this spring).

P.S.

I work for Dayco in aftermarket sales. Maybe someone on the list(in europe) can
get more information than I could(I dont know much about 944 ) All i could find
out is that Dayco tries to make all there parts meet or excede O.E. spec and
that they could be made in the pirelli plant( i have not looked at one of these
belts yet)

white and blue car can be seen in the current Porsche TV ad). Anyway, Herbie
the bartender started the Guiness thing, all the Brits from the styling
studio would hang out there, and when the place changed hands they kept the
Guinness. It was either Guinness or Pils for most of us. (Pils takes 5-10
minutes to tap a glass, to keep the foam down).
 
Small World Syndrome -- when I started work at Road & Track in early 87, I
rented an apartment in Huntington Beach. One night at the pool, a bunch of
folk with British accents came by. One looked a little familiar. We compared
notes, it turns out his previous job was clay modelling at Porsche. He used
to hang out at the Krone too, in the other corner. Mind you the Krone was
small, I think 20 customers would fill it. I think it had 5 barstools.
Anyway, his job in California was at the local branch office of IAD,
International Automotive Design, in HB.

If you're not misinterpreting a thin black layer of brake dust as oil, and
if the hub cap (the actual 2" or so cap over the central nut, not any sort
of decorative thing) isn't losing bearing grease, then you may be losing
brake fluid. THIS IS DANGEROUS. See if the inside of the wheel is wet. Look
for wet spots on the ground. Most of all look for dropping brake fluid
levels in the reservoir. You MAY be able to drive this way if the leak isn't
too extreme and you keep the reservoir topped up, but it needs to be taken
care of as soon as possible. If it is indeed brake fluid, you probably just
need new seals, about $10 plus lotsa labor.

Great!  Get out there and learn how to really drive your 951 quickly and 
safely.  Yes, it is a real adrenalin rush.  However,  PCA Driver Ed events is 
**NOT** wheel-to-wheel racing.  Passing is only allowed on certain sections of
track and only with the go-ahead of the car to be passed.  In NNJR, the 'R' 
word is verbotten at a PCA Driver's Ed. event.  Other than restraining the 
impulse to 'race' in an environment where other folks are trying to learn and 
bringing your car home without new 'racing' stripes from the Armco, another 
good reason to make the distinction has to due with your insurance.  Some 
insurance carriers will cover driver's ed but not racing (check your policy). 
 So track events may be covered but not autocrosses.  Of course, there is PCA 
Club Racing and the SCCA if and when you really want to go all-out racing.   
Sorry if I sound preachy, but this is a sore topic with me with everyone I 
know who disapproves of high-speed driving telling me about 'racing' my car.

OK, I'll get off my soap-box now.

Whoa, Nellie!  For now leaving aside the question of whether splitfire's
"work", unless the laws of physics changed since I got out of school,
there will only be one spark here just like a normal plug.  A spark
ionizes the air in its path, and the lower resistance guarantees that
the rest of the charge will take that path.  Therefore, only one spark
per compression stroke.  Of course, what they show in the commercial,
is the spark coming from all over the place, but they are just getting
one spark per 'firing'.  The spark can come from a lot of places if you
have a plug where a large area is about equally distant from the center
electrode.

Subject: 914 restoration


	I just bought a very cheap 1973 914 2.0 and it is time to make it 
look not so cheap.  This is my first porsche so I don't know as much as I 
should. I've restored plenty of older american cars and I feel 
comfortable with my car abilities.  I would like to hear from other 914 
owners about the best sources for information (written and spoken), the 
best/cheapest part supplies, etc.  I've read the 914 FAQ and I bought a 
Haynes, but I'm sure there is more and better.  I paid $500 for the car 
which was built in 9/72 (is September the first month for '73?).  It's a 
2.0 liter with the fuel injection still in place.  The body is in 
excellent shape (the doors close solid and easily with approx. 450 lbs in 
the car and the roof off).  The car is missing all exterior trim, 
however.  It is missing both bumpers, tail lights, side markers, front 
parking lights, and headlight surrounds.  The floor boards are extremely 
solid and interior is in far shape.  There are couple cuts in the driver 
seat and dash pad.  It has a 150 mph speedo which I believe is incorrect 
for 4-cyl. 914's.  The car was last driven in 1983 so I plan on 
rebuilding the engine before even attempting to drive it.  Also, the 
front, right torsion bar adjuster is broken so the sits unlevel. 
	So anyway, there is the car.  It's obviously not in perfect shape 
but in good overall shape and well worth the price in my opinion.  Any 
help from seasoned veterans or young porsche pups like myself will be 
greatly appreciated.

Ryan -
Congratulations on your purchase!  Sounds like you have a good solid car to start from.
The monthly porschephiles FAQ has a long list of parts suppliers that may have what
you need.  Many of them have free catalogs.
I think the 150 MPH speedometer is correct for your car.  Some of the earlier models had
(120 MPH)? units, but the later cars all have 150 MPH units.
Is umn.edu the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis?  If so, I'm right in your area.  I have a
'75 914 (1.8L) and may be able to answer some questions...

Good luck and have fun!

And if your bearings at either end of the rod are at all loose,
the resulting slap gets even more sever, while normal higher-rpm

I did this just for fun once.  I put the sticker on a piece of magnetic
vinyl (?) cut it to fit around the sticker, and slapped it on.  You 
couldn't even tell it was a magnet!  People would ask me: "why would 
you ever put a sticker on your car?"  And I would smile and take it
right off!

The stuff I'm talking about is what they use for signs and stuff.  I know
its commonly available, I just don't remember where.

Also, its a good idea to put a good coat of wax on the car first, just in
case!

Subject: Sparklers


Been reading a little on the thread about spark plugs. Interesting.
Here's a few cents for you guys that want a little more from your plugs.

Try indexing your plugs (I know you'll try it, read on). This involves 
using some spacers and marking your plug for the direction of the 
electrode. Indexing is used by ALL the major engine builders. The idea
is to ensure that the electrode "points" toward the piston face. The
spark-ignited fuel  is at the face of the piston as the gases are 
compressed, having an unshrouded spark igniting the mixture assures a
more complete burn.

I have used this method while testing spark plug combinations and for
my own cars. I can tell the difference. I have a device that I can 
screw the spark plug into to see how the electrodes are aligned. They
usually are not. In a given set you may find half that will point in 
the right direction when torqued in the head. The others point in 
directions you do not want. This is where the spacers come in. They 
come in thicknesses that allow for 60 degree adjustments. Some plugs 
are so far out that I just keep them for an oddly threaded cylinder. 
Generally, I can get plugs aligned within a 30 degree spread. 

I mark the plug base so I can observe the location when torqued. For
911s and engines with shrouded plugs, I have a set of extensions and 
spark plug sockets that are marked. I put the plug in with the marks 
aligned. 

My opinion of the plugs available. I have tried all of the popular 
configurations. Split-fires work, but not according to their 
instructions. They have crappy sealing rings and cost too F****** much
for what they deliver. My preference in Porsches, turbo or otherwise, 
are Bosch Silvers. They last and rarely foul. My opinion of Platinums
isn't very high unless we are talking about the old style and are 
running all day on the Autobahn. Follow the Factory recommendations 
on plug gap unless you are a mechanic of the Vasek or Andial calibre.

Most of the indexing components, calibration fixture, spacers, etc are
available from speed shops or certain engine builders. It is worth the 
trouble to do if you are going to track events with your vehicle.

Ummm. This is fine for autox and "around town" cafe racer stuff, but 
won't work if you're at speed on a track.

Common wisdom is to wax the car heavily, apply the sticker as late as possible,
and take it off as son as possible. Good luck.

Interesting idea. I've been leaving the electrode pointing up into the
outside air and having the ceramic insulator point towards the piston 
face... But it's a real bitch to install like that. 8{) 8{)

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, what exactly do you mean, Jim?

Yeah, I've ordered from them only once.  I ordered a set of turbo tierods
for my 914 track car.  When I got the box, opened it up to do the work,
they were wrong.  One side was correct, but the otherside was a different
kind of tierod and different size/type of end.  I had to send the whole
order back and wait for the correct parts - which I got, but no money or
compensation for having to send the box back for a mistake they made.

FWIW: If it's a one-off, I'd do as Stan suggests. If you plan on
using the stickers continuously over time, see below...

Actually, the mags will work on the track.  Through experience, I've
found that the larger the sheet of mag material, the better it sticks. Duh.
I also use a small amount of tape along the leading edge of the magnetic
material to seal the leading edge to prevent lift.  If you can keep the
magnetic material in a rectangular or curcular shape, this works pretty well.

The best tape I've found is used by the people in the medical
profession.  It's clear and has an effective, but not overly tenacious
adhesive.  I've also used duct/racer's tape in this application as well.
It doesn't take much tape to seal the leading edge so it's not unsightly.
If your're predisposed to travel at high speed in either direction (as I
have been known to do, on occasion) you may want to tape the trailing 

edge as well, but we all hope that this doesn't happen with your new
baby.

Oh, I almost forgot.  If you do use magnetics, I would still recommend
waxing prior to application and be sure to get the car-side of the 

magnetic sheet clean of dust/dirt/iron filings, etc.

Good luck,
Drew

So, to answer my question; the '79 928 came stock with 7x16 inch wheels front

wheels.

Peak torque is at 3600 rpm.  Peak horsepower is at 5250 rpm.  Max horsepower is
SAE net 219, with Max tourque of 245 ft/lbs.  Curb wieght is 3351 lbs.
My power-to-weight-ratio is 15.3 lbs per horsepower.

Subject: 951s and Turbocharging


Hello Phello Philes;

I have been following with interest the recent thread on engine lugging and 
suggested RPM ranges for best drivability of our Porsches.  I have had my '89 
951 for about 3 months/3000 miles now and I am still learning the power 
characteristics of the 2.5L Turbocharged engine.

Looking at the Torque/Horsepower curves for the engine shows what the seat of my 
pants already knows, below about 3000 RPM there just isn't much power available.  
>From 3000 RPM up to  6000 RPM the power builds rapidy.  Many refer to this as 
'the boost coming on'.

I don't quite understand this phrase.  Say I am running at 2000 RPM and floor 
the gas pedal.  A look at the boost guage shows 1.2 bar, i.e. full boost.  Yet 
the power is not felt until that 'magic spot' between 3000-4000 RPM when the car 
takes off like a rocket.  On the other hand, if I am running at 4000 RPM and 
floor the gas, the reaction is almost immediate at the same 1.2 bar boost.  Is 
this what is meant by Turbo Lag?

I think I understand the basic principles of Turbocharging:  using exhaust gas 
to spin a turbine which pumps more air into the cyclinder allowing more fuel to 
be burned generating more power.  Is there some RPM in the 951 at which the 
Turbocharger starts working its magic?  Below that RPM the 951 is no better than 
a normally aspirated 944?

My quest for this knowledge is based somewhat on relatively poor performance at 
the 3 or so Autocrosses I have participated in since purchasing my car.  I am 
finding it very difficult to keep the power up on tight, twisty courses even 
with downshifting to 1st gear.  I know I still have much to learn about driving 
my car, but maybe someone can pass on some of their secrets of success using 
Turbocharged cars for autocross.  Those pesky 911s and 914s are eating my lunch.  
My first track experience with the 951 will be November 13. 911s beware!  I will 
keep you posted.  Any enlightenment passed on would be much appreciated.  Thanks 
in advance.

    Typical source for high idle in D-jet 914s (1.7, 2.0)

Careful inspection of the brakes on my 89 951 showed that the rubber dust
boots around the brake pistons on the front brakes were disintegrating. This
is probably the result of my Oh Sh.t braking technique at the Glen.
Anyway it seems that they should be replaced so off I went to my friendly
Porsche dealer to purchase new rubber boots. Slight problem, they are
available only in the rebuild kit which contains the piston, etc. These kits
are about $45 each and eight are required, not to mention the unappetizing
prospect of pulling the calipers off and removing the probably perfectly fine
pistons. 
Having rebuilt 911 calipers that have only two pistons to deal with I
certainly don't feel like dealing with four piston calipers unless absolutely
necessary.
The question is;
1. Is it necessary to rebuild the whole caliper and replace the pistons when
just the dust ruffles are shot. (no signs of leaking anywhere)
2. These are Brembo calipers and the dust boots have Brembo stamped on them.
Is there a source of these parts other than Porsche?
3. Is there a Brembo dealer out there.

In california you have to replace *all* removed smog equip.  Then if it

I, too, would be interested in purchasing the rubber parts for the
calipers if they are available, for the rebuild (assuming the 
brake pistons are ok).  I think I'd replace the seals and the
dust boots if my dust boots were disintegrating because I would
worry about the seals being contaminated.
Also the rear calipers - are these the same as the 86-88 turbo?
and if yes, are there rubber parts available?

A trick I used with success on my other car (Dodge Daytona Turbo Z) was to use
the brakes hard in tight corners, but also keep the throttle open, thus keeping
the flow through the turbine side of the turbocharger.  It's real tricky, but
I can't think of a better way to keep the turbine/compressor spinning at peak
rpm's.  And when you complete the corner the revs of the turbo should be high
enough to get you to the peak torque of your engine (what you feel at 3000-4000
rpm) much faster.  The trick is to get your engine to peak torque quicker 
than the next guy, but with turbos, it's kinda difficult.  

The old Audi Quattro racers (Michelle Mouton...what a babe!  And she can DRIVE!)
used a technique at Pike's Peak where they had a bottle of compressed air that 
would contantly spin the turbocharger at max rpms.  Whenever they needed the
power, the turbo was ready.

Isn't there some kind of racers tweek about "indexing" the spark plugs so 
that the spark faces the inlet valve? This should allow more complete 
combustion, more power etc etc. I seem to remember that Tweeks or 
Performance Products advertises adjustment washers so you can align the 
plugs (and presumably move the vertical postion).

So my question to all you racers (especially Stan) is does this work? Is 
there anything to be gained on a street/autox car?

Subject: Stalling 911 SC

I have a '78 911 SC that has started stalling when coming to a stop 
after the car is warmed up, particularly when I come to a stop quickly, 
so the engine speed goes from fast to idle quickly when the clutch is 
depressed.  Sometimes it doesn't stall, but the RPMs dip to ~200 and 
then back up to 1000.  It's almost as if it's trying to stall every 
time, but most of the time something kicks in as the engine is idling 
down (i.e. clutch goes in when the RPMs are around 3K) to prevent the stall.

At one point (beginning of the summer), I reconnected the vacuum lines 
to an engine component on the top left of the engine (just behind the 
accelerator linkage).  Prior to that, the line was plugged below the 
'T' where it would normally connect to said engine component.

Any ideas?

And you only want it to cost $12.53 and you want it to get 45 MPG. Just
like everyone else.

Look, I've had a lot of experience. And the trophies to prove it. You 
*CAN* get 100K miles out of a 914 engine, really. You just can't do
it and make 125+ HP. Plus, you have a '76. If you live in a smog controled
area, you're gonna have to have all the relevant smog gear plus meet
spec on emissions or you're not going to be able to register the car
starting in '96.

> should I convert to a six? 

*ANYTHING* that involves a change from stock necessarily involves 
re-engineering. There's no such thing as "bolt-on" performance. WHen
you change any one component, there are three or four others that get
affected.

The 103mm pistons are horrible on the street. Lots of piston slap, and
it takes the rings a long time to seat if they ever do. Plus, that
would bias the engine towards higher RPM operation, but (1) those pistons
aren't light enough, and (2) then you gotta do all the things to keep
the rest of the engine together above 6000 RPM.

Stroked cranks are also bad, since now you gotta have custom rods and you
may have to have custom pistons to get the wrist pin geometry correct.
Not to mention the extra pounding the bottom end is gonna take.

Big valves are *ONLY* useful if you've increased the displacement, and
even then you don't need valves as big as the "performance shops" are
selling. Remember, they're in business to take your money, *NOT* to
solve your problem...

As to the 4 or 6 question, you can build a very good streetable 914 engine
that makes 125-130 HP on stock EFI and will last for 50-60k miles for only 
about $7,500 to $9,000. Depending on what you have to start with.

You can buy an early 911 engine (it's gotta be from the "with carbs"
era or you run afoul of the emissions stuff again), build it out to 
2.4 liters and make 140-190 HP for close to 100K miles for only about
$8,000 to $11,000 again depending on how lucky you are. Oh, then you
gotta pony up another $3-4k to modify the 914 to accept the 6 -- oil tank
and plumbing, different fueling, different motor mounts, etc. You could also
buy a good used 3.2 and plug it in but there is a TON of work to make
that  go together right. And more money spent solving unexpected problems.

The prices I'm citing are retail and assume that you have someone that
knwos what the hell they're doing actually do the work.

So, you tell me: what do you want to do?

Subject: Re: timing belts

>As i understand it 944s have a lot of problems with timing belts.

No they don't, the timing belt is simply a maintenance item, just as it
would be in any other car with a rubber timing belt (and hey I know, while
I was being paranoid about my 944 timing belt, my '90 Mitsi Eclipse broke
it's timing belt - fortunately it was under warranty).

>Currently these timing belts are made by Pirelli(sp?)

Well, I do believe that the 944S belt is a Pirelli (I'm not sure though,
because I've never owned a 944s), but the 944 belt is a Gates belt (at
least the ones I get at my dealer are - and this is one of the few parts I
go to the dealer for, 'cause it isn't one you want to cheap out on).

I don't know, I think that I would want to keep getting my belts from
Porsche, just for piece of mind sake, even if it does cost more. I know
that the 944s belts are quite expensive (he, he... yet another advantage to
having an 8 valver), but hey, there's 16 very expensive valves in there
(and lifters, etc.), and a lot of labour getting there to replace them. So
hey, I think it would be best to stick with the factory part in this case
...

Just my $.02 worth !!!


P.S. - A while ago I was coming home from Milwaukee and my balance shaft
belt broke. Even though I had never experienced a 944 with a broken balance
belt, I knew exactly what it was. Of course, I was due for belt replacement
about 10,000 miles ago - but I kept putting it off. So I drove the car home
(yes, the balance belt <did not> take the timing belt with it, and I'm
thanking the Porsche Gods for that to this day), and changed the belts the
next day. The timing belts Gods warned me, and I am thankful that they had
mercy on my 944's soul !!! Now I know to adhere very closely to the golden
rule: replace at 30,000, retension at 2,000, and then again evey 10,000.

I agree with Stan about HP/Reliability/Streetability/Cost
issues in hotrodding a 914. After all, if you had megabucks,
you would have started with a 930, right?

IMHO, I'd go for (1) upgrading suspension and tires, (2) reducing
as much weight as possible and (3) improving driver skills
 - Your order may vary based on current skill level.

PCA events are handicapped so that you can have an absolute
blast competing against cars with similar characteristics and
capabilities (except maybe 928's) without spending gobs of 
money.

There are some awesome (in the non-California sense of the word)
purpose-built 914's with tube frames and big liter engines, but
the cost and engineering effort involved puts them out of the
range of most mere mortals. You can go and drool over them at one
of the PCA Racing Series events. It's always fun to dream - and
much more affordable.

cost a min of $3500.This will be for a better than factory eng you
can get by cheaper. Do not use the Japanize pistons and barrels
they do not work real well. Rings do not seat!!!!

If you have to replace rubber seals on car will cost apporx 1500
for this alone.

Crome bumpers will run apporx 250-300each for rechrome once you
find the bumpers. The 914 bumpers are so thin that they can only
be rechromed if they need any dent repair work.

Subject: Re: 70-73 Values (Dave)

Dave,

I'm assuming you mean 911 values here. If I'm wrong, let me know.
Our 911 issue, which came out in July/94,  actually showed an
increase in average asking price for 70 - 71 cars (about 5%) and a
decrease in average asking price for 72-73 cars (about 15%). These
are 'asking prices'  based on PML ads between 8/93 - 7/94. I think
that the excitement generated by a new, and relatively affordable,
Porsche like the 993 and the availability of used C2/C4 cars will
naturally dimish interest in earlier cars(other than special cases
like 67S, 72-73S, etc). For this reason, it seems to me that now 
is a good time to look for any 911, 3.2L Carrera and back, and 
expect to find some good prices.  I just spent the last few weeks
getting my current issue out and haven't checked Pano closely yet.
You are the 2nd person to write this month commenting on what
seem to be reasonable prices on 911's in Pano. I've always found
prices to be relatively high in Pano(also the quality of cars is high),
so perhaps we should all be watching our favorite models closely
as 993's, Boxter's?, etc come out and get all the press!

No.

But, if you didn't replace them, odds are that they're the original
injectors. If you really love your car, you'll get new ones. Should be
about $60 each. You'll be amazed at the difference it makes.

On the "little hoses" -- they're a one-time compression fitting. You 
*CAN* break the compression band and then pull the hose off, replacing
it with new 7mm Wurth braided high-pressure fuel injection line and
a good Wurth hose clamp (you can even use the BMW clamp that breaks the
screw head off when you hit the right torque if you like...). HOWEVER,
if you need new hose, you gotta figure that it's because the old hose
started deteriorating, which probably means little pieces of rubber
got into the injector. You can hope they all went through, but if they
didn't they may be clogging the injector or disrupting the spray 
pattern. In any case, time to change them.

Just went thru this referee process with my 68 912.  It's a pain in the butt.  
Here are the basics.   
 
1. make an appointment with the referee. (Took 3 weeks before I could get an 
appointment). 
2. Show up at the appointed hour.  he will inspect to see if you have the 
factory installed smog stuff on the car.  If you don't he will give you a list 
of the parts you're missing. He will also give you a phone number to call for 
the "parts locater". 
3. Go home, call number.  Tell them what car you have and what parts you're 
missing and they'll give you the numbers of at least 3 parts places that may 
have the pump, reactors, etc.  Call them and tell them what you need.  If the 
parts are available, you have to buy them and put them on.  If they are not 
available, you have to call the locater back and tell him that the parts 
aren't available.  then he gives you a number and a phone number to call to 
make another appointment.  (three more weeks).   
4.  Go back to the referee.  If your parts are no longer available, he will 
smog your car and pass it.  If the parts are available, you have to put them 
on.  If you do this,then just go to a smog station and get it  smogged. 
 
There is a solution to this.  I won't put it out over the newsgroup, but if 
you  forward your email or phone I'll pass it on.

Has anyone out there in P-phile land gone through the (California) referee
process with regards to getting your baby smogged?

A little background:  This is a 1977 911S that I bought in 1988.  It was
already on its second engine when it came into my possession, and,
naturally, the thermal reactors and air pump were conveniently left off.
The previous owners provided me with a smog certificate, and, yes, told me
that the emissions stuff was missing.

A little more background:  I've successfully smogged the car twice before.
Obviously the establishments didn't quite know what to look for in the
visual, but the sniffer part was honestly passed.  Says a lot for the value
of those thermal afterburners, doesn't it?

OK, it didn't work this last time.  I tried to play dumb, but no cigar.  I
think I'd rather just do the Referee thing and get it over with.  Or do I?
What can I expect, given my circumstances?  Will the head linesman throw a
flag, blow his whistle and say, "Sorry, you have to rebuild your engine and
make it smog legal."?  Yeah, YOU tell my wife!

Thanks for any insight anyone can offer.

Jerry,

I went through the same "invoice shock" recently when I ordered these kits
to rebuild a set of 951 callipers.  I ended up sending them back.

>1. Is it necessary to rebuild the whole caliper and replace the
pistons when just the dust ruffles are shot. (no signs of leaking anywhere)

Yes and no.  If the pistons are pitted or otherwise damaged, you should
replace them.  They may not be visibly leaking today, but...  If you
are replacing the seals, you are effectively rebuilding the whole
calliper, since you have it as apart as it comes.  Do take everything
apart (except for the through-bolts, Lance!), clean it and dry it.  I
replace any hardware that even hints at looking questionable.  I also
popped, a couple of years ago, for a jar of the Unisilicon assembly paste,
lifetime supply.

>2. These are Brembo calipers and the dust boots have Brembo stamped

Porsche does not sell a repair kit with just the seals.  They used to,
but no more.  I don't know of a US Brembo source.  Brembo UK can be
reached at (0280) 700664.  Jon Milledge would probably be a good

Hi Tracy,

Pretty interesting post.  I'll be following the thread closely.

Until you commented that you are getting the same 1.2 bar pressure reading
at 3000 rpm, I had always believed that the problem was "turbo-lag"; i.e., 
that the turbo was not spinning fast enough in the low end of the rpm band,
and was therefore not producing significant overpressure.  Your message would
seem to contradict that, and now , too,I wonder what's los.

One answer could lie with the cam characteristics (profile, lift, overlap and 
timing).  Back in '66, when I was playing with different cams for my Corvette,
the first one I tried was from the '65 Fuelie.  It made a fantastic change,
it would run strong to 7500 rpm, but it had *0* power below 3000, and to
get off the line without bogging, the clutch had to be dropped at 6000!
Truly unsatsifactory for the application, and not too surprisingly, a HD
racing clutch was only good for about 10 runs.

If I understood the content of your message Jim, any engine but the 'pure'

Find a local mechanic with an injector cleaner.  This is basically
a pump handle with a pressure gauge and a reservoir for cleaning
fluid, with a fitting comming off it which connects to your injector
like the fuel line in the car does.  Using this setup you can tell at
what pressure the injector opens, wether it leaks at pressures it's
not supposed to and what the spray pattern looks like when it is

Most of the sign places you find in the Yellow Pages carry it. You can
buy a yard of it for a few bucks. This is how I put my slalom numbers on; we
have two drivers and can quickly change the two big "bullseyes" carrying our

I painted the white magnetic material with yellow Krylon before applying

Subject: 951s and turbocharging

 
Hi, Tracy.
 
Even if you are getting 1.2 bar of boost at 2000 rpm, that doesn't mean you
will feel strong acceleration there. It all depends on the cam and how well
the engine breathes at that speed.
 
Consider that a non-turbo has one atmosphere (more or less) of absolute intake
manifold pressure when the throttle is wide open. Your turbo, if the gauge
is to be believed, has 2.2 atmospheres absolute pressure at 2000 rpm (1
atmosphere ambient, + 1.2 bar boost, = 2.2; a bar is one atmosphere is 14.7
lbs/sq. in. more or less). OK, so a non-turbo has 1 atmosphere or bar
absolute to work with at 2000 or 4000 or whatever rpm. Your turbo has 2.2 at
2000 or 4000 or whatever absolute pressure to work with. Just as you
would not expect the non-turbo to pull strongly at 2000, the turbo won't
either, unless it was designed to do so at low rpm (like a truck
or tractor or piston aircraft engine).
 
As you have correctly surmised from watching the boost gauge, you do have
boost at low rpm, just nothing happens. People who say the car comes onto
the turbo at 3000 or 4000 or whatever are wrong; it has boost well before
that, and the electronically controlled wastegate keeps it steady at 1.2 bar
across a wide band. The reason you don't feel a kick until 3000 or whatever
is that that is the engine's torque curve, which is really a reflection of
the breathing efficiency (engineers call it volumetric efficiency) of the
engine. Non-turbos exhibit the exact same effect. This is just the way the
cam and valves and all that apparatus flows air as a function of rpm. The
newer 968 with resonance induction and variable valve timing (VarioCam) has
a broader torque band; it's like having two different cams in the engine,
and switching between them. By the way, the electronic
boost gauge (I don't know if your car is digital readout or analog dial) are
placebo gauges. On the 911 Turbo, they reach a predetermined value and stop.
That's to keep Joe Goldchain from going in to the dealer and saying Tom
Toupee's Turbo goes to 0.72 bar while his only goes to 0.71 and fix the damn
thing, will ya? (It doesn't matter, but Goldchain doesn't know that).
 
One trick to keep boost up on turbos is to shift very quickly. Drag racers
are able to shift without taking their foot off the throttle, but I
would not recommend this with any car you plan to own for any length of
time. I do it when testing cars for magazines, but then I get to give them
back a week later. (Except for a Lotus, which was doomed to fail anyway, I
have never broken any engine bits in 6 years of this "power shifting" or
"speed shifting").
 
Another trick to get going from a standstill with a turbo is to make sure
you have boost before engaging the clutch. You can sit there at a red light
and rev the thing to 6000 rpm all day, and it will not make much boost. The
engine has to be under load; you have to have the throttle wide open to make
boost, and you can't get the throttle wide open by holding revs constant
with the clutch out. The trick is to nail the throttle wide open from idle
with the clutch pedal down, and then when the revs pass the point where the
engine is making maximum torque, more or less (adjust rpm up or down to
compensate for tire grip) you engage the clutch. Not violently, not by
sidestepping it and letting the pedal snap back (some magazines test by
revving to 6000 and sidestepping the clutch. They break lots of cars but
because they are BIG magazines the manufacturers keep sending them more).
The idea of flooring the throttle from idle is to build up some boost by
making the engine work against its own rotational inertia. It can't do that
if held at constant rpm; it's only working against internal friction then. If
you do this right, upon engaging the clutch smoothly but quickly,
your engine will "hang" at some intermediate RPM (remember
you have engaged the clutch well before the engine could reach redline) while
the tires fight for grip. Once they have grip, the revs will climb toward
redline and you now drive as you normally would. Now, if the tires break loose
and the tach heads for the redline with spinning tires, it means you let the
revs go too high before engaging the clutch. On your next try, let the clutch
in maybe 500 rpm lower. If the engine rpms suddenly sag, you launched at too
low an rpm. Try 500 rpm higher. As you fine tune this, you may try 200 rpm
increments. What you want to look for is a brief second or two where the
tach "hangs" at one rpm, or drops no more than 50-100 rpm, before going up
normally to redline.
 
The quickest accelerating turbo I've ever tested, not counting the Brumos
IMSA Porsche Turbo a couple of years ago, was the 3.3 liter Turbo of I think
1991 or so, before they went to 3.6 liters. I tested that on a 40 degree F.
day on a deserted road in France. Turbos like cold air, and I would never be
able to get such performance here in California, at the Pomona drag strip
(70-80-100 deg. F). Using the technique described above, and power shifting
(leaving right foot down) I saw 0-60 mph in 4.25 seconds, repeatably. I
just looked up my test gear printout, the launch rpm was something like
3500 rpm. 1/4 mile in 12.74 at 108.9 mph.
 
Power shifting -- if you rev to redline, leave right foot down and then VERY
QUICKLY hit the clutch, yank the shift lever and get off the clutch, you
will not overrev. The engine can't overcome its internal rotating inertia
that quickly at peak rpm. Like I said, don't do it with something you plan
to keep.
 
For comparison, the Brumos car got 0-60 in 4.52, but that was not at full
throttle; this was the scariest ride I've ever seen at full throttle in
first gear and I couldn't use the technique described above, as the back end
would break loose and the car would slew back and forth violently. But it
did the quarter mile at 119.3 mph, and it takes a lot of power to make up
for time lost in first gear and reach such a high speed (1/4 mile time was
12.61, not that much better than stock 12.74). I figure the Brumos car had
450 - 500 hp.

      There's obviously a lot of experience on the net with "smog check,"   
    now we (Harris County aka Houston Tx) are going to have this instituted. 
    I have 2 cars that I'm worried about; a '70 with nary a smog device 
    designed into it and a '79 with its Catalytic Converters removed.
    My question to anybody who knows is;
 
      1. Are older cars exempt from testing ?  How old does the car have to
         be before nobody cares (even the '70 is a daily driver) ?

      2. Do the sniff test limits vary with the year of the car ? i.e., does
         my '70 w/o even a smog pump have to test as clean as a '94 Honda ?

      3. Assuming that the '79 car passes "visual" check, is there any hope
         it will pass the sniff test ? (the cats are there, just 
         hollowed out).

      4. Are there any good ways to cheat ? I'm wondering if there is any
         high-alcohol fuel mixture possible that appears clean enough
         to pass test.... 

        After reading the August issue of National Geographic relating the

      can respect what I once thought was environmental extremism. But
      I'm also interested in DRIVING....

       5. As a last question, about Lambda sensors; I'm considering putting
          one in my exhaust to monitor mixture. The Bosch unit appears to 
          act as a switch, i.e. above 14.9:1 a/f it puts out 0.2v,below
          14.5:1 a/f it puts out 0.9v. Is there another kind of oxygen sensor
          that is more linear over a 12:1 to 15:1 air/fuel range ?

I've had good dealings with Vertex.  Just beware the advertised prices 
varies between magazines (Euro Car, Excellence, Pano).  Pano usually seems 
to have the best price, but not always.  Perhaps due to different publisher 
deadlines?  If you order parts from them, make sure you get them to verify 
the prices and double check the bill on receipt.

For example, I recently ordered rear rotors for my 928 advertised in Pano @ 
$60 each, advertised @ $70 in other magazines.  When I received them (ATE 
rotors), the invoice listed them at $70.  I called and they promptly gave me 
a $20 refund and an apology for the mix up.  No bitching required.

Anyone can mess up, how it's handled afterwards tells you allot about the 
company.  They handled it very well.  Their shipping charges are fair, 
unlike some other part houses that see it as a profit center.  I have 
ordered from them twice now and would order from them again.

PAP in GA is also very good.  Their unadvertised prices are sometimes better 
than those at Vertex.  I get my filters and other parts from them.  Vertex 
claims to beat any price, if you want to haggle.  I never bothered on the 
small orders I have placed.  With all the parts you are looking to get, it 
may be worth a few calls.

Subject:  914 Brakes update

Here is a progress report on my 914 brakes.  (I have had a mushy/springy feeling brake
pedal and less than effective braking force.)

After much fiddling with the stock 914 proportioning valve and many test drives, I could not
get a satisfactory pedal feel and I could not get the rear brakes to lock up.  I decided to replace
the stock valve with an aftermarket unit.  I located a Wilwood proportioning valve at a local
racing supply shop and spent about a week hunting down the correct adapters to convert
from the metric brake lines to the 1/8 NPT threads in the Wilwood valve.  I ended up bending
and installing new brake lines to connect up to the proportioning valve, saving the original lines
in case I ever needed to go back to the stock valve.  The Wilwood valve output pressure is
adjustable from 57% to 100% of the input pressure.

The pedal feels very solid now.  The harder I push, the harder it pushes back - no more springy
region as the pedal gets half way to the floor.  Unfortunately, even with full rear bias, I still can not
lock up the rear wheels.  Either the stock 914 rear calipers are not strong enough to do this or
there is still something wrong somewhere.

I am considering a few options:
1.  Replace my unknown brand of brake pads with pads known to have a good grip.
      (Ferodo street pads?)
2.  Rebuild my rear calipers.  I should do this anyway as I have noticed that (at least) one of the
      piston dust boots is cracked.  Maybe I have a seized piston?
3.  Temporarily cap off the brake lines going to the front calipers and test the effectiveness
      of the rear brakes by themselves.  I stress that this would be a temporary, controlled test
      done just to determine how well the rear brakes are working.  I think they are doing something
      because the rear rotors do get hot, although not as hot as the front rotors.  I would expect this.

Overall, I like the new proportioning valve.  Even though it didn't fix my rear brake problem, installing
it was worth it for the improved pedal feel alone.  Anyone else considering a swap might want to
take the effort to find a valve with metric fittings as it was a lot of work to find the correct adapters.

"older" is pre-68. Your '70 will be subject to the same scruitiny as a '89.
Different specific standards, yes, but the intent is the same. All the
emissions stuff must be there. All the levels at the pipe must be as spec'd.

The spec you have to meet is the as-published spec for your car for your 
year. There's no "must be this clean to drive" spec. Fortunately.

Well, in TX the DPS will be running the emissions stations initially,
then handing them over to approved contractors. It's not like a state
inspection or for that matter like emissions checks in CA. There have
been rumors of chassis dyno checks for dynamic measurements. If they
do that, it's gonna be tough to cheat... And if Trooper Bob is actually
running the station, don't even think about bribery....

A good friend of mine was the DPS captain responsible for implementing this
in the metro Houston area. Unfortunately, he had to take early retirement
and move to Little Rock to deal with a major family crisis. I'm trying to
get him to connect me with someone on the inside that can keep me informed

Most likely the problem. I discovered in doing a brake job on my 356SC that
of four rear pistons, only *ONE* was actually moving. No wonder the
brakes felt so bad...

Don't do this. It's not necessary. If the rear is working right, they

I have heard that here in Colorado, we will also be going to dyno emissions

Subject: 914 D-Jetronic F.I.


I own a 71' 914 with the 1.7L and F.I.. While chasing wires and testing
components for a fuel problem (which turned out to be a pressure sensor which
was filled with corrosion and rust) I found my F.I. wiring harness, "brain", and
throttle switch were all for a 73' model. I didn't mind this in the least since
1. they're newer  and 2. the later model "brain" allows me to adjust the fuel
mixture. This leads to my 2 questions:

    1. Should I be adjusting my CO% for the 71' or the lower (in CO%) 73' specs.


    2. As far as I can tell, the only other difference between the 71' and 73'
F.I. systems is a deceleration valve on the 73' models. From what I've read and
understand, the 71' model F.I. had a different throttle switch with extra
contacts so that the "brain" would know to shut off the fuel during
deceleration, while the 73' model instead used the decel' valve to inject extra
air to take care of the extra fuel during deceleration. My question is: since at
this time I don't have either system in place, should I hook one (most likely
the decel' valve- its cheap,easy, and goes along with the reast of my
components) up? Is there any performance benefit (ie; fuel economy, etc.) or
does it help engine longevity, or is it "only" for smog prevention? It doesn't 
have to pass any emmisions tests but I'm willing to make it as mechanically and
enviromentally correct as needed, as long as the price isn't outrageous (which
this doesn't seem to be).

Any thoughts, insights, or comments would be appreciated.

     Do you mean the black round cover plate that goes around
     the keyhole and is on the dash?  If so, thats an easy one.
     Look around the edge of the circumference of the plate.
     You'll see about four tiny holes about 3mm dia around the
     circumference.  Insert two pins which will fit *snug* into
     two holes which are opposite each other.  Hold the pins
     and turn the cover plate anti-clockwise to unscrew it from
     the ignition keyhole.  If it is too difficult to turn, just
     insert one pin and hold it in place while tapping *lightly*
     on the pin with a small and light plastic faced hammer/mallet.
     
     Be careful not to scratch your dash!!!  Mask the dash area
     with masking tape before you attempt this.

I've purchased parts from Vertex on a couple of occassions and been
completely satisfied.  The parts were first class and the service OK.  I had
forgotten about the adder surcharge for credit card but I even with the 2%
their prices are excellent.

Recently I faxed a list of 911 engine rebuild parts to several advertisers in
Pano and Excellence.  Europroducts and Vertex were consistantly the lowest.
 EBS, in Colo. also had good prices.  One must factor in Sales Tax. For
example, in CA it is over 8% so one can save by ordering out of state.

Bill,

San Diego Region uses the Zone 8 rules.  The way it works, as Bob
has pointed out above, is that you get so many points to play with for
each progressively higher catagory (from "stock" to "prepared" to
"improved" to "modified").  The points are assigned for each of the
mods (not one per mod) as the Zone 8 rules commitee has determined to
assign the points.  

This system is often villafied, but it allows for personal choice as
to the mods that a person can make to a car.  Also, this helps keep
cars within a class competitive.  Way back when, there were several
drivers that ran 928's at both time trials and autocrosses and I've
seen some of the trophies taken by these cars, so they can be
competitive.  

  So, here's a quick rundown on your listed mods:
	bigger tires		2pts and up (depends on how big you
				             go)
	bolt in cage		0pts (as long as you don't go through
				      a firewall or to a suspension point)
	shocks			0pts (as long as they are the same
        			      style as stock - brands and valving 
				      are all free!)
	smoother driver		0pts 
	less_smokey engine	0pts (and then we won't think it's a
				      914)
	headers			0pts (for exhaust mods - just keep it
				       under 92dB.)

So, you're looking at 2-4 pts for tire size (unless you're going
_really_ big) so there's still points to play with.  Such a deal!

I suggest you get a copy of the Zone 8 rules, study up, and if you
want a change, now is the time to suggest it.  The Zone 8 presidents
meeting will be in San Diego at the Zone 8 Time Trial on Nov. 19.
This would be a great place to suggest any changes, or send them to
the rules guys beforehand.

What you guys really have to worry about is that I'm looking for a new
class to run my 914 in next year... humm, 928s and SCs, sounds pretty
easy to me.... 8-) 8-)

Not at all likely. Tracy tested a Benneton, but failed to really drive the
wheels off of it. Same general problems as Mike A. - not used to the short
braking distances, and not as confident entering the high-speed turns. Wound
up about 2 seconds down on Schu. Tracy has reportedly just signed with
Newman-Haas, so he probably won't be in F1 next year.

Mansell pulled a Drew and spun on lap 50...

Tracy tested the Benetton at Estoril, Portugal and ended up turning some
pretty good times.  Benetton offered him some big bucks to drive F1 but
he, instead, signed with Newman/Haas for next year driving along side
Michael Andretti.  There's been alot of speculation about his entry in
F1, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen in '95.

This is a rather unimportant, but interesting 944 story.

Recently I noticed that I was using up the supply of windshield washer fluid
in my 944S2 too quickly. When I spotted the puddle on the floor after I
filled it up, I concluded that there was a leak in the bottle, so I removed
it last night.

There was no leak:  Rather a 'straw' from the electric pump is simply
press-fit into a hole in the bottle. Over the miles the pump assembly had
jiggled around (I guess) and exposed the hole, so the fluid all leaked out.
Solution: push the pump straw back into the hole.

I don't think that Gerhard und Fritz did their best engineering work the day
they designed this method.

PS: I think the waterbottle is a VW part, so maybe Gerhard und Fritz work
for VW.

Only a  few things....

1) they don't stick as well as any of the Yoko, BFG, or Goodyear
   rubber

2) oh yeah -- the P-Zero *DOES* stick pretty well but not nearly enough
   to justify it's pricing 50-75% over the other tires that perform
   just as well.

3) they go out of round at around 20k miles

4) they largely suck in the wet (except the P-600 which makes up for
   it by largely sucking the rest of the time)

Gone are the days when the CN-36 was *THE* tire to have and the P-7
was spoken of in reverential terms. Pirelli just sat on past glories
these days, as far as performance tires go, is just about irrelevant.

Hi all, 
 
      Regarding the oil on my 944's front wheels, after the advice from  
      you all, I took a close look and found the following: 
           -    Ball, shaft seal is leaking. 
           -    Cam housing is leaking (very slight). 
 
      Both these above leaks are very small and there is no dripping on 
      my garage floor. I don't have the know-how to fix this, and even 
      if I was prepared to do it from the workshop manual, I don't have 
      the required tools. So I am badly in need of a Porsche workshop. 
      Please let me know of any good P-shop in the Bay area. I live in 
      Sunnyvale CA, and wouldn't mind driving to a place a bit far off. 
 
      I am switching to synthetic engine oil (mobil 1) today. The car 
      was previously on organic oil. Any advantages/disadvantages for 
      synthetic oil in 944's? Also, what is the oil change frequency 
      for synthetic's?

If you don't like it, don't read it.  Feel free to use it in another

Porsching - by Chris Welty, Hudson-Champlain Region

Perhaps I hadn't been paying attention.  Perhaps I was unaware that
the sun had been trying all day to break through the protective layer
of clouds.  I barely noticed the patches of blue sky in front of me,
but other than this, there was no warning.

Fire.  Bright blasts of searing heat detonated in waves of color,
blistering the paint on my blood-orange 911.  Poking through holes in
the scattered cloud cover, sunlight exploded on the trees in blinding
bursts of light - summer's verdant flame had been replaced by the
intense inferno of fall.

The air hissed loudly in protest, but like a fiery arrow I flew down
the blazing highway, creating brief swirling maelstorms of red,
yellow, and orange in my wake.  There was no stopping in this
firestorm, the ardent forest blasted my eyes until I could barely see
the road, and my ears were continuously assaulted by the deafening roar.

The heat was unbearable, surely neither I nor my car could withstand
it much longer.  The entire forest was ablaze, the flames blowing over
the road with the currents of rapidly rising air.  It was too late to
turn back, my only choice lay ahead in the hope that a break in the
inferno, a brief respite from the ceaseless burning, might offer
relief.

The turbulence of my passage evoked incindiary retaliation from the
forest, behind me now was a sheer wall of flame, which would soon
overtake and envelop my vehicle.  Survival now became a question of
speed, and my surroundings blurred into a swirling mass of blinding
color.  Car control was a matter of instinct, as temperature became
my all consuming concern.  The paint, coaxed on by the intense heat
around it, began to erupt in small flashes as it bubbled off the
surface, revealing the bare metal beneath.  My own skin was not far
behind, I felt as if I would ignite at any moment.   My breathing got
shorter, unable to compete for oxygen with the all-consuming fire.

I burst forth from the forest in a shower of flames.  I cranked the
wheel hard and slammed on the brakes, bringing the car around to face
from whence I had come.  After a moment for my vision to return, I
noticed that the clouds had once again succeeded in cutting the supply
of sunlight, and without this to fuel it, the forest had returned
to a cooler, more timid display of color.

"Oh," said my wife, just waking up. "The leaves are changing."

I shook my head.  She had no idea...

Tracy tested with Benetton several weeks ago.  Rumors exist that he
signed a deal to drive for Benetton *IF* he goes to F1 in the next
3 years.  However, he will be in IndyCars next year as he has signed
with Newman-Haas to partner Michael Andretti.

One far-fetched rumor is that Penske is buying McLaren who will
drop Peugeot for Mercedes.  Since Schumacher's Benetton contract
is only through '95, he will return to Mercedes (at McLaren) for
'96 and be partnered by Tracy.

Tom,

I don't get the relationship between Tracy and Ham.......

Ham was not spending time in Europe driving the car and testing. Because of
this, and his lack of familiarity with the circuits in Europe, led to poor
performances on the track. Because of this, he was fired and someone new
was hired (I forgot his name).

I saw the same interview re: Porsche Cup team and Nick Hamm.  What I got from
the interview was that Nick couldn't keep flying back and forth to and from
races and still continue to test.  Evidently, theses Cup guys are constantly
testing and Nick wasn't.

If I recall correctly from Octobers Pano, this wouldn't have come as 
a surprise.  In the article Nick Ham seemed to say that he was on the
hook to produce at Hockenheim.  He didn't seem to mind this as he
said that he normally did well at Hockenheim.  However, on race day
he didn't run well and made some crucial mistakes ending up with a
finish well down the pack.

I guess this was the last straw for the team manager and from your mail
it looks like the team has asked Nick to move on.

Gee, do I dare ask your opinion of Dunlop D60M2's?  I have D60A2's
on my Celica and they have been a good all season street tire for me.
So I was planning on replacing the old Sears roadhandlers on my 914
with the Dunlop D60M2 series since the 914 won't see snow.
(195/65 if I can get 'em to fit).  I expect these tires to be for street

Well, look out.  There's a lot of talk that this is the next step here
in CA.  If your car is so clean (factory specs, at the motor, not
after the cat.) you drive so many miles.  If you go over, extra taxes
and extra smog checks and possible fines.  Nothing is really clear

Some talk began about charging a unilateral cost per mile on
EVERY car/bike/truck out there.  Another idea to charge depending
on type of vehicle is also in the works.  God forbid they actually
try to charge according to road wear and tear, gas consumption,
and overall environmental impact.  

I'd be pissed if I had to pay the same for my motorcycle in taxes
as does the driver of an 18 wheel truck.

Actually, the latest word is that it's not gas consumption that is 
the problem, but emissions - straight out of the engine, that is to
be taken into account.  So, if your new 55mpg Honda isn't clean at the
engine (no, after the cat doesn't count) you won't get to go as far as
a "clean" car.

Yeah, I wonder if that was a "feature" that the factory designed in in
anticipation of laws like this.  8-) 8-)

Subject: 914 various messages

I noticed a few 914 messages worth commenting on:

1. On fast idle: I forgot in my note about fast idle and AAR's to mention 
something learned at the side of the master (Stan). To find out if a 
vacuum hose is leaking, spray carb cleaner at the hoses (especially the 
ends) while the car is running. A bad hose will suck in the air and idle 
will be even faster for a few seconds. Replace that hose. (We replaced 
ALL our hose even though the old tested ok; very little work or expense.)

2. On injectors and testing whether one is bad: Our 914 73 2.0L has gotten
pretty bad gas mileage. I noticed the other day that there was a gas
smell, and have since replaced one bad injector (gas was dripping out
underneath) and seals. (thanks Stan) Two others appear to have gas
covering the bottoms (finger under the injector comes up with a film of
gas)...all will be replaced by Sat at 11 AM. If you suspect the injectors 
are bad, you might try this finger under injector test...even slight 
fuel leaks are bad news. 

3. On parts from Auto Atlanta: If I could not find the part anywhere 
else, and I was desparate, I *might* call them. I do call Performance 
Products, Tweeks, High-Performance House and the dealer too. Although 
I've been told that High Performance House is high priced, he is much 
less than AA (1/2 in many cases) for used parts, and HPH's used parts 
are tested and work (at least for me). Parts Heaven is good too.

Enjoy

Kevin,
thanks for the info on the 951 brakes. As of now I wasn't contemplating
replacing the seals, just the dust covers, since they are bone dry and the
part of the pistons that are showing (at full extension ) seem to be fine. My
concern was that a complete rebuild would be necessary if I allowed dirt in
there because of the defective shields. 
I am curious; you said you returned the rebuild kits after the sticker shock,
yet you also said that you rebuilt the calipers?!?
I will continue the quest for the dust shields and if you have any further
info it is always appreciated.

Hi there all you interested in indy cars here is mess from

                FORWARDED MAIL ------- From:
C-reuters@clarinet.com (Reuters) Date: 18 Oct 94 Originally Posted
On: clari.sports.motor 

         LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. (Reuter) - Canadian Paul Tracy and
American Michael Andretti were named Tuesday as the new drivers
for the Newman/Haas IndyCar motor racing team, replacing
Britain's Nigel Mansell and Andretti's father Mario.
         Financial terms of the deals were not announced, but owner
Carl Haas said Andretti had signed for three years.
         Regarding Tracy, Haas said in a teleconference, ``We both
understand that we're looking forward to a longterm relationship
and I think that will happen, without going into a lot of
details of the situation.''
         Tracy, 25, comes over from this year's dominant Penske team,
for whom he finished third in series points and tied Mansell
with a season-high five victories. Mansell, a former Formula One
and IndyCar season champion, is back on the Formula One circuit
after two IndyCar campaigns.
         Tracy in the last two seasons had eight IndyCar wins, second
only to Al Unser Jr.
         A British racing magazine reported last month that Benetton
was believed to have offered Tracy a three-year deal worth some
$8.5 million to race in Formula One.
         Said Tracy of his European experience: ``The way things had
unfolded I was asked to come over, no strings attached. When I
got there, the situation changed. I wasn't about to sign
anything just to do a test on a car.
         ``I had my plans set for what I definitely wanted to do for
1995, that was to drive for Carl. I gave him my word on that,
and my word is good. We shook hands on the deal weeks and weeks
before anything of Formula One testing came up.''
         Tracy added: ``A contract was offered but it's something
right now I'm not interested in. I'd like to win a championship
in IndyCars first.''
         Tracy also said, ``At the end of '95 we'll make a decision
where we're going to be.''
         Tracy got some advice from his new teammate and from Mansell
about dealing with the Formula One scene.
         ``I might have told him, just don't trust them over there,''
said Andretti.
         ``I talked to Mansell and a lot of guys from Formula One,
and they said, don't trust anybody,'' said Tracy. ``You almost
have to wear a sheet of armor on your back when you walk around
there.''
         Andretti, 32, replaces his father Mario, who retired after
spending the last 12 years of his 31-year IndyCar career with
Newman/Haas. The younger Andretti is rejoining a team for whom
he raced from 1989-1992.
         During that time, he won the title in 1991, was the series
runner-up in 1990 and 1992 and ranked third in 1989. He won 20
races and 21 pole positions in 64 starts with the team, more
than any other driver in the four-year period.
         ``It feels like I'm going home with this Newman/Haas team,''
said Andretti, who upon his father's retirement became the
winningest active IndyCar driver with 29 victories.
         The big challenge for the Newman/Haas team is to catch up
with the Penske operation, where Tracy's teammates were
Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi and Unser.
         ``We're having new cars designed, new Lolas, and we're
continuing to use the newest version of the Cosworth engine,''
said Haas.
         ``Michael and I bring a lot to the table this year, Michael
being the factory Reynard driver and myself being at Penske the
last 3 1/2 years,'' said Tracy.
         ``We know pretty much what is going on with their new cars
for the future, which I think gives us pretty much of an upper
hand for 1995 in terms of developing the new Lola.''
         Said Andretti: ``Everybody on the team is working very hard
to attack the Penskes, obviously, because they seem to be the
team to beat. Knowing what they're doing, what's happening
within the team, I think we are going to be competitive with
them.''
         Haas said of the inside information his drivers were
briging, ``It's not an automatic magic, so to say, but it's good
input and there might be some things we can pick up.''
         Tracy said there had been difficulties with Penske's
three-car operation.
         ``With three cars at Penske it was a tremendous strain on
the team and the crew guys,'' said Tracy. ``Sometimes it looked
great from the outside but from within, it was quite a struggle.
For me, going back to a two-car team with a more concentrated
effort, I think it's the best situation for me.''
         He added of Roger Penske's chances of enticing him back,
''If everything goes right it's going to be pretty tough for him
to get me back. I'm pretty comfortable here right now.''

Q. Congratulations, Michael.  How did you feel about today's win?

MS: Just great!  It's the best thing that could have happened, starting 
with the football match that my team won.  Everything went perfectly 
today, especially with pole position yesterday after the little problem 
that we had on Friday.  Then we won the race today not just by a little 
margin but by a big one.  That's exactly what you want to do.  I just 
want to say that it has been a hard time for everybody on our team.  
Everybody has been even more motivated, to push even harder.  And we 
are a team -- this is a great team -- working as a team.  It is a nice 
feeling.  Today we proved it again. This has been a big success for me 
and for the team.

Q. Your race seems to have gone perfectly.  Did anything go wrong today?

MS: It was a 99 per cent: the one per cent was being held up by 
somebody. Apart from the first set of tyres, the race went perfectly.  
This is just the way you like to come back to F1: this is where I left 
it.  I am really pleased about the way things happened.  It has been 
very difficult in the last two races, for the whole team and for me.  
It could have been that the situation in the team had changed.  There 
was the pressure, and things going on that might have put down the 
level of motivation, or things like that. But as soon as I came back 
and started to test at Estoril, everything went back to normal.  It has 
been an amazing effort: the guys have done a fantastic job.  We proved 
that our strategy was the quickest way, but first you have to make all 
the stops exactly right.  They worked out perfectly. Plus I had to work 
things out on the circuit, and this worked out as well. I am just very, 
very pleased.

Q. At the start it looked as though you moved, then stopped ...

MS: Yes, it was like that.  Normally the red light stays on for a 
shorter time.  This time it was on for ... quite a long time.  I was 
also very close to the bite point of the clutch, and the clutch heated 
up and suddenly started to drag.  I had to come off the clutch again, 
and when the green light came on I was not prepared.  Then I bogged 
down and picked up too much wheelspin.  It was a mess ...

Q. Damon, did you keep to your original pitstop strategy?

DH: We always planned to stop two times, but the second stop came a 
little earlier than I expected.  It mean that I had quite a long second 
stint, which, with hindsight, may not have been the right way to go.


Q. You seem to avoid doing the three stop strategy, which always seems 
to work for Michael ...

MS: I would agree, up to a point.  But you have to remember that I was 
ahead of Michael, on a two-stop strategy, when he came in to the pits. 
That meant that I should have been looking very good.  But the race 
seemed to go his way at mid-distance and we seemed to lose out during 
that period, when you would have expected it to be the other way 
around.  I am obviously pretty disappointed.  I have to say that I had 
got my hopes up about doing well here.  The margin of victory was 
greater than I would have liked, also. Nevertheless, by finishing 2nd 
here to Michael, my chances of winning the championship are still open. 
 And with Suzuka coming up I can look forward to a circuit where our 
horsepower advantage will be worth having. I think we put up a close 
fight here.  If, from the three [end-of-season] circuit, you had to 
chose the one where the Benetton could be expected to be at its best, 
it would probably be Jerez.  Second place here is not, er, great, but 
it has kept everything alive, and it is still a good result in a GP.

Q. Where were you missing out to Michael today?

MS: He just seemed to pull away in the middle part of the race much 
more than I expected.  It's difficult to say, really ... I have to 
analyse things after, because it's not always easy to do it when you've 
been in a race. After my second stop I could see Michael ahead of me, 
but I just wasn't able to push in order to stay with him.  He was 
getting away at too much of a rate.  I was not able to keep up the same 
pace without starting to make mistakes or working the tyres too hard.

Q. No problems with the car, then?

DH: None at all.  It was great.  But you can't drive it beyond a 
certain point before you start to get into handling difficulties.  Like 
anything, it has a finite limit.  Anyway, Michael drove a great race 
and it was exciting there, for a while.

Q. Did you feel you had bad luck with the backmarkers?

DH: No, not really.  Part of the problem was that we had too much fuel 
on in the middle part of the race -- and it is more difficult to pass 
with more fuel in the car.

Q. Mika, your fourth 3rd place running!  Having started 9th, then got 
involved in that lively group at the beginning, was it a good race?

MH: It was really exciting today.  I was more or less watching what was 
going on, but I didn't want to join in so badly because it didn't look 
like much fun to me.  So I was waiting to see what happened.  Also, my 
car wasn't handling too well on the first set of tyres and I didn't 
want to take any risks.  Our tactic was to do two stops in the race.  I 
think it was right for us, and it felt good.  When I put on the second 
set of tyres at the first stop, the car felt much better.  That gave me 
an opportunity to drive harder -- and it ended up really well.  I am 
really pleased about finishing 3rd.  Of course I would like to be the

     LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. -- Michael  Andretti and Paul Tracy will drive 
for the Paul Newman-Carl Haas team in the 1995 PPG Indy Car World 
Series with primary sponsorship from Kmart Corp., Budweiser and 
Texaco/Havoline, it was announced today.

     Haas said during a news conference  that Andretti will return to 
Newman/Haas Racing to drive the Kmart/Texaco/ Havoline Lola, while 
Tracy will pilot the Kmart/Budweiser Lola. Both cars will use 
Ford-Cosworth engines, Goodyear Eagle tires and Havoline oil.

     Andretti, 32, of Nazareth, Pa.,  will replace his father, Mario, 
who has retired from Indy Car competition. Michael Andretti raced for 
Newman/Haas from 1989 through 1992, capturing the PPG Cup title in 
1991. He was the series runner-up in 1990 and 1992 and the third 
 -ranked driver in 1989. He won 20 races (31 percent) and 21 pole 
positions (32 percent) in 64 starts with the team, more than any driver 
during that four- year period.

     The Andrettis formed the sport's  only father-son team during 
Michael's previous stint with Newman/Haas. Mario has spent the last 12 
years of his 31 - year Indy Car career with Newman/Haas, his longest 
tenure with any one team. Michael had two wins this past season driving 
for Ganassi Racing and was fourth in PPG Cup points.

     Tracy, 25, of West Hill, Ontario,  Canada, is widely regarded as 
one of Indy Car racing's brightest young stars. Last year, in his first 
full season of competition, he tied Nigel Mansell with a series-high 
five victories and placed third in PPG Cup points. His peers voted him 
"Most Improved Driver."

     Tracy was the 1990 American Racing  Series (now called Indy 
Lights) champion with a record nine wins in 14 starts. He made his Indy 
Car debut the next year and joined Penske Racing mid-season as a test 
driver. He had three victories this past season, including the last two 
in-a -row, and again was third in the point standings.

     "Paul Newman and I are very pleased and excited that Michael and 
Paul will be driving for us," said Haas. "We enjoyed a lot of success 
with Michael in the past and, hopefully, that will again be the case.

     "Paul Tracy has proven that he is a fast and aggressive driver. 
Those are the qualities we want. We are delighted to have him."

     Michael Andretti said: "Going back  to Newman/Haas is kind of like 
going home. Paul and Carl provided a great home for Dad for many years, 
and also for me. I think the record proves the team and I worked very 
well together, and I'm really looking forward to re- establishing those 
relationships as we get ready for the 1995 season."

     Tracy said: "It's great to be with  the Newman/Haas team. There 
are only a few teams I'd want to drive for, and this is definitely one 
of them. I want to thank Paul and Carl for this opportunity and their 
confidence in me."


     Haas noted that Kmart, one of  America's largest retailers, will 
continue with Newman/Haas as a lead sponsor for the eighth consecutive 
year. The Budweiser brand of Anheuser-Busch, Inc., was the team's 
sponsor in 1983 and 1984, with Mario Andretti winning eight races and 
the 1984 PPG Cup championship under the colors of the "King of Beers." 
Texaco/Havoline has been a co-primary sponsor of Newman/Haas Racing since 1989.

     Joseph E. Antonini, chairman,  president and chief executive 
officer of Kmart Corp., said: "Kmart is proud of our partnership with 
the Newman/Haas Racing team and its professional approach to 
championship racing. We are especially pleased to welcome Michael 
Andretti back to the Kmart family and are excited that Paul Tracy is 
joining our team. The 1995 season promises to be one of excitement as 
Kmart also welcomes Budweiser as a primary sponsor. The 
Kmart/Texaco/Havoline and Kmart/Bud cars will proudly represent our 
commitment to excellence just as we strive to deliver that same 
commitment to customers of our Kmart Automotive Service Centers nationwide."


     Tony Ponturo, vice president,  Corporate Media and Sports 
Marketing for Anheuser-Busch, Inc., commented: "Everyone at Budweiser 
remembers fondly our role as the first primary sponsor of Newman/Haas 
Racing -- and driver Mario Andretti -- in 1983. The following year, 
Mario, Carl and Paul promptly rewarded Budweiser with a then-record six 
victories and the PPG Indy Car World Series championship, and stirred a 
passion for Indy Car racing at Budweiser that endures today. We are 
again proud to be a primary sponsor of the Newman/ Haas team -- and 
also of the brightest young driving star in Indy Car racing, Paul Tracy."

     Thomas M. Matthews, president of  Texaco Refining and Marketing 
Inc., said: "Newman/Haas Racing's reputation for achieving excellence 
is well known among Indy Car competition and its knowledgeable fans. We 
are proud to be associated with this outstanding team, our fellow 
co-sponsors Kmart and Budweiser, and the extremely talented Michael 
Andretti and Paul Tracy. This winning combination embodies the same 
spirit of excellence and top performance which we build into every 
Texaco product. We are looking forward to an exciting and successful 
1995 season."

     Haas added that associate sponsors  on both cars include 
Energizer, Gillette, Maxell, Uniden, Exide, RC Cola, Anderson 
Consulting, Braun, Bosch, Alexander Julian, Navistar trucks, Segerdahl 
Corp. and Yamazaen Inc..

Subject: Parts Suppliers

I thought I would share some experiences with you all regarding
some Porsche parts suppliers I've been dealing with. First, I've 
got very high marks for PartsHeaven. They have spent a non-
trivial amount of time on the phone discussing technical issues
regarding my 911 and 914, in one instance I ordered a parts kit,
received an incomplete kit, and they fedexed a complete new kit
to me (at no charge)  and told me to keep the first for future use...

Another supplier I've had good luck with is German Parts and 
Restoration. I've found them to have the absolute best prices
on Bosch FI parts and things like Oxygen Sensors. Usually about 
half price of places like Performance Products and/or Tweeks. The
other week, I ordered new CIS injectors for my 911, new injector seals,
and a set of washers for the banjo fittings at the fuel distributor. I ordered
everything on tuesday with 2nd day delivery so I'd have everything for the
weekend, on friday I found two packages on my doorstep, a box shipped
2nd day air with the injectors and seals, and a Fedex letter shipped overnight
with the washers! It turns out that they were out of stock on the washers when
they shipped my other stuff on wednesday, but washers came in late wednesday
so they packed up a set and overnighted them to me! (at their expense). Thats
what I call great customer service! Sooo... in the what it's worth department, I
highly recommend both PartsHeaven and German Parts and Restoration for
both good prices and high quality customer service....

Something here does not compute. Atmospheric pressure is only 15 psi,
so that's the highest vacuum you can get. Probably just a gauge that's
mis-calibrated, but 18 psi vacuum implies negative 3 psi absolute.

My guess is that the valves are not very sensitive to exctly how much
vacuum is applied, since they have to deal with reduced vacuum during 
accelaration, for example. It is a little hard to tell, since your
measurements are impossible, but if just one valve is malfunctioning
it seems to be a likely culprit. How about comparing its operation
with the others?

Hi Jerry,

>I am curious; you said you returned the rebuild kits after the sticker
>shock, yet you also said that you rebuilt the calipers?!?

Correct.  The few times that I have rebuilt callipers, I have popped for
the seal kits, which are cheap ($10 or so).  Regardless of the seal
condition, I have replaced them.  At $10 a calliper, it's cheap and
its the safe thing to do.

This time, because of the cost (like $150 or so per calliper) and
because the existing seals inspected OK, I simply stripped, cleaned,
inspected, and reassembled.  The callipers were take-off's being
brought out of retirement.

The only things needing any attention inside the calliper were the
pistons.  Brake dust builds up and solidifies on them.  I take it
down with a mild scrubbing pad, like a green Scotch Brite but much
milder.  We snarf them from the body shop next door.

I would like to find the seal kits minus the pistons, for future
reference.  They are not available in the wholesale aftermarket.  If
no one on the list is successful in finding a source, perhaps I could
give Brembo UK a call, or whatever.

Let me know what you find.  Take care,

Kevin Gross

Subject: 951 turbo failure/problems


question (maybe sanity check): took a very well running (and "tweeked") 951
to the shop today for minor stuff (brake bleeder screw, transaxle oil change)
and the mechanic calls in a panic---> said while on a test drive the car
strangely stopped making any boost. Car was fine-- stopped to pick up a part-
restarted the car and no boost.

then the scenario went: could spin turbo by hand ok, wastegate not stuck,
installed new knock sensors, no apparent oil leaks (or turbo seal leaks).
Restarted car, more tests, cool down car -> now turbo will not spin by hand.

diagnosis: seized turbo  (ie "probably coke on bearings)

The car has ONLY had Mobil 1 (since new), turbo is allowed 5-10 minutes 
idle cool down after hard runs (ie each track session), left to cool with engine
er hood, up. Oil is changed every other track event -> ie after each 12-14
hours of use.

Somehow I find this hard to swallow. Will turbos suddenly "seize" with no
warning (binary operation?)? Could something else be at fault? With the
careful effort to *prevent* heat buildup & cooking the oil in the turbo is it
still vunerable to heat related failures like this? Is there a better solution
to avoiding this in the future? (turbos are not cheap).

Thanks in advance.

They're a good tire for Celicas. They're also OK on 944s, oddly

You'd be happier with Yoko A-509s or AVS Intermediates, and 195/65 should

Subject: REFEREE!!


OK! OK!  I got covered with responses from people wanting to know the 
"solution" to the California smog "referee" process that I decided to put it 
out to pfiles and let the flames begin. 
 
First, a couple of things.... 
	1.  My car is legally smogged now.  While jumping thru the hoops the 
state puts you thru to get a 24 year old car smogged, I vented my frustration 
by focusing on figuring out how to be legally registered without having to go 
thru this insanity. The smog parts I needed are no longer available, they 
haven't been available for years, but the state keeps making us go thru this 
process every two years.  It took almost two months and to get the car 
smogged.  Technically, I couldn't drive it during this period but the state 
got registration (use) fees while I wasn't on the road.  I had no choice there. 
	2.  The environment is important to me.  I support clean air.  My car 
passed easily, it has a fresh rebuild, is in constant good tune and is not 
modified. All of my other vehicles are also smog legal and clean.  This car is 
rarely driven. The process that the state has set up to get older cars smogged 
if parts aren't available feels purely like harassment.     
	3.  A friend has another old Pcar with the same problem.  He drives 
his every day and couldn't park it while waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy 
to roll on so I gave him my solution.  It worked for him. Here you go: 
 
In Calif., there are two agencies you deal with to get smogged.  The DMV and 
the BAR.  They only connect with each other over your smog situation when you 
bring paper from one to the other. So, the right hand doesn't know what the 
left hand is doing. 
 
First, go to the DMV, pay your fees, get your registration.  You are now 
legally registered!!!!  You have paid your use tax!!!  You have a valid 
registration certificate!!!  They will not give you the yearly sticker until 
you come back with a smog certificate.  you have everything you need but the 
sticker. 
 
Next, go to your local "motorcyle dismantler" and buy a $50.00 wreck to 
"restore" .  honda 305's or 160's are good for this along with mashed Vespas.  
Take the title and pink slip to the DMV.  Spend five bucks, register it.  They 
give you a "sticker".  Same size, current year.  Take the honda to a landfill. 
 Keep the registration for next year.  you figure out where to put the sticker. 
 
You may notice that the sticker has numbers on it.  Do you think that the CHP 
can tie those numbers to license plate they're on?  Guess again.  Those 
numbers are for DMV internal tracking purposes.  Ask a CHP guy. 
 
Does the DMV follow up on the smog.  I don't think so. The car has to be 
registered whether you drive it or not.  BAR knows nothing about you until you 
show up at a Smog station or the referee. 
 
Well, this is what good citizens do when government runs amok, I guess. 
  
If you can get smog gear for your car you should.  If not, this works.  Good 
luck. 
 
I'll put on my Nomex suit now and wrap the terminal with asbestos.  Hell, we 
probably haven't has this much fun since the other Ted left.

	I don't have any driving experience of any of these cars so i can't
	tell you anything about reality, but i happen to know some technical
	and theoretical stuff that supports the superiority theory.
	From model year '69 the 911 and also the 912 got their wheelbase in-
	creased with 57mm (that's about 2,2 inches) by moving the rear wheels
	backwards.That made the 911/912's weight-distribution change for the
	better,it became more balanced.Before this operation Porsche had even
	used lead weights in the front of the car to prevent the front end to
	'jump' in sharp bumps.This gave the car better handling off course.
	Otherwise the '69 912 should be similar to the '67 and '68 models.
	The '76 912E is different than the '69 912 on one major point,the 
	engine. While the '69er has the old 1600cm3 engine from the 356 model,
	and thus is a 'real' Porsche,the '76er has the 1600cm3 Volkswagen type
	IV engine with fuel injection.Technically these engines are very simi-
	lar apart from the fact that the VW engine is equipped with fuel injec-
	tion (a mechanic one, not to be confused with modern electronic fuel
	injections).Both engines should produce 90bhp so performance should 
	also be very similar in both cases.The only difference is that (if I'm
	correctly informed) the VW engine is easier and cheaper to 'hot up'.

Mclaren is part of a rather large, rather well off company headed

A very strong rumour, bur Mercedes is still, apparently, considering Sauber - who

 	I don't have any driving experience of any of these cars so i can't
 	tell you anything about reality, but i happen to know some technical
 	and theoretical stuff that supports the superiority theory.
 	From model year '69 the 911 and also the 912 got their wheelbase in-
 	creased with 57mm (that's about 2,2 inches) by moving the rear wheels
 	backwards.That made the 911/912's weight-distribution change for the
 	better,it became more balanced.Before this operation Porsche had even
 	used lead weights in the front of the car to prevent the front end to
 	'jump' in sharp bumps.This gave the car better handling off course.
 	Otherwise the '69 912 should be similar to the '67 and '68 models.
 	The '76 912E is different than the '69 912 on one major point,the 
 	engine. While the '69er has the old 1600cm3 engine from the 356 model,
 	and thus is a 'real' Porsche,the '76er has the 1600cm3 Volkswagen type
 	IV engine with fuel injection.Technically these engines are very simi-
 	lar apart from the fact that the VW engine is equipped with fuel injec-
 	tion (a mechanic one, not to be confused with modern electronic fuel
 	injections).Both engines should produce 90bhp so performance should 
 	also be very similar in both cases.The only difference is that (if I'm
 	correctly informed) the VW engine is easier and cheaper to 'hot up'.
 	That is because of the availability of parts for the VW engine, and I

(Actually, I have a 924s, but the engine is the same as a 944.  :)

Hello there, my name is Craig Seko, and I'm a recent addition to the
mailing-list here, and its *much* nicer since...  oh yeah, that's
off-topic now...  <cough>

Anyways, at our (Rennsport Region's) last track event at Mont-
Tremblant in September, the power steering at idle was jerky,
which suggested either a worn power steering pump or a failing
steering rack. I continued to run, however when I started the car for
the last run of the the day, the P-car made that "Number 2 rod-bearing
has spun" noise. I have experienced this noise before - and, as such,
I was surprised because at the end of the previous run I had listened
to the motor at idle and nothing seemed wrong. I had also checked the
oil pressure constantly, and the oil level after each run. A
well-respected ex-dealer mechanic listened to the car and pronounced:
"bottom end" <sigh>. A new-to-Porsches by-stander also thought he saw
the crank wobbling. Needless to say, I trailered the car home, my sole
track time on Sunday being in my student's 993 <grin>.

Once home, I dropped the oil pan (NOT fun), and looked at the rod 
bearings. ALL of them were fine, which, it seems, implies the problem 
was a crank bearing (oh my gawd), so I pulled the motor (REALLY not 
fun in a gravel driveway with no garage), which leads me to my first 
question:

1. Can I use a "regular" four-finger engine stand to hold a 944 motor?
I have one, but I know there are special stands for 911's, and I don't
want to see the threads pulled out of the aluminum block because they
can't take the weight of the motor by themselves (the engine is
sitting on my front porch now, much to the chagrin of my neighbours).

Once I get the engine inside and on (hopefully) the stand, I'll be 
able to have a look at the crank bearings. One thing I have noticed
is that the power-steering pulley on the crank spins freely, which
explains the steering problem and wobbly appearance of the pulley (the
crank bolt is still on quite tight). I was wondering, though,

2. Would such a loose pulley (broken crank key, I'm assuming) cause or
be caused by a main bearing failure/bent crank? Would such a loose
pulley perfectly imitate a knock deep down in the engine?

I guess I'll find out the answer to this sooner or later, but I 
wondered if anyone had experienced a similar problem... and I'll be 
pretty damn upset at myself for pulling a motor for no reason. The 
engine was re-built at 40,000 miles (25 track hours), thanks to my
then-ignorance of the proper oil level, and I've only put another
25,000 miles (another 20 track hours) on since then.

3. If the crank is bent, though, I may have a line on an '89 944S2
motor w/Motronic for $CND3k ($2200US) - has anyone done this swap,
and/or am I asking for an electronics nightmare? (not to mention
needing better brakes).

On the other hand, now that the motor's out, I might as well replace 
the clutch, which leads me to two final questions:

4. What is the size of the internally-splined bolts that hold the
flywheel onto the crank? The socket I'll need is special order
(i.e., non-returnable) from the local tool places, so I need the right
size the first time.

5. I've heard awful things about rubber-centered clutch disks. The
only spring-centered ones I've been able to locate are the Sachs 
competition ones, which cost about double the already bloody expensive
OEM rubber clutch disk. Any opinions, sources?

Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to any and all replies.

Subject: Sponsor stickers - thanks.

Thanks for all the advice & recommendations on how to apply
stickers to a car & then be able to remove them without damaging
the paint. I received a ton or replies. I guess a few of you have
done this before!
 
There were really two basic option: use magnetic patches cut to
the size of the decal or apply wax &, prior to buffing the wax
clear, attach the decal over the cloudy wax (then buff the
surrounding wax clean).
 
For both options I was advised to apply a couple of fresh coats
of wax to the car before the stickers saw the light of day!
 
I use the magnet option for my car numbers when I take the car to
the track but I think for the stickers I'll try the other method.
I also like the idea of "linting".
 
I have a few months to decide before the event so I have plenty
of time to think about it.
 
Anyway, thanks for all of your help,
 
John Mulligan.

Subject: New Subscriber/911 Owner


Text item: Text_1

Hi to all subscribers,
I am a new subscriber and new (first time)P car owner having recently, that is 
less than 500 miles ago, acquired an '86 911 Turbo. After having changed 
underwear from the results of the first straight line acceleration I flung it 
into my favorite corner, a 180 deg. compound curve jobbie, and was mortified by 
the amount of understeer. I never thought it possible to build that much in to a
car with  so much rear weight bias and power! However a visit to our local 
suspension wizards here in Cincinnati, Performance Alignment, has cured all of 
that and the car now drives really sweet for road use at least.
Real purpose of writing was to seek some help. My early reaction to the car was 
amazement that the people at P would arrange the go fast and go slow pedals in 
such a stupid juxtaposition. How am I supposed to 'heel and toe'? (or should one
say center and side foot). Does any one know of a simple kit such as longer 
adjustable linkage and stops for the aforementioned go fast pedal which would 
make an elegant solution to the problem or do I have to duct tape a block of 
wood to the pedal?
Second question relates to seats. I have the standard electric up and down only 
seats. Some previous person hauled on the fore/aft release lever to such an 
extent that the torque tube connected to the lever has badly distorted and will 
not release the catch on the opposite side seat rail. I have jury rigged it by 
bending the tie rod and supporting the tie bar with a nylon tie wrap. Where can 
I get a new torque tube assembly, tie link and nylon clips/bushings for the tie 
link? also how do you separate the hard nylon bushing/clips to get the old tie 
link out?
As an expatriate Limy of 14 yrs. I have to advise Ben Evans that his gf should 
take the Cleveland experience, after all it was only for a year, just remember 
everything on this continent is more extreme, weather highs and lows (be careful
of quoted averages the standard deviations are extremely big), egos and fishing 
achievements included!!!!!!!! Beer of choice has to be real ale or porter pulled
by hand from the wood at cellar temperature, that's 57 deg. NOT warm, 
notwithstanding all of the Lucas ULs. I drink a half of Guinness once every five
years to remind me how horrible it is.
Sorry this has rambled on a bit, promise it wont happen again, thanks in advance
for anticipated help re pedals and seat.

Hmmmm - I have done this 2xs recently when I bought cars
that were not presently running so I could not get them smogged. Both times
I got a non-valid registration card (one that clearly states this
on it) This only documented the fact that you had started the transfer 
and paid your use tax within the required 10 days of obtaining the vehicle.
If you do not return with a smog certificate later you will receive a
letter from Sacramento stating that you have an incomplete registration
in process. (I believe it says get a smog cert or sign on the dotted line 
that you are not using the car anymore)

Well anyway, unless different DMV branches operate differently, I don't
think that you could get a car registred in CA without getting 
a smog cert. 
But of course there are many ways of getting that cert ;)

In Seattle we have dyno checks.  For two wheel drive they put you drive wheels
on the rollers and make you get out of the car.  The attendent then gets in 
your car and does the "driving".  For 4x4 or AWD type vehicle they just do
a regular tail pipe sniff at two or three rpm settings (and you get to see
how close your tach and theirs agree :-).  With 4WD vehicles they are worried
that the wheels not on the dyno may suddenly drive the vehicle off the dyno and 
cause damage to various things (people, buildings, cars, etc).

Thats how they do it here.

Subject: 69 912

        Reply to:   69 912
In 1969 Porsche increased the wheelbase of the 911 chassis 2.5
inches (the rear wheels were moved aft).  The engine remained in its
same place, but the rear drive shafts were angled back and the the
trailing arms were extended.  This change, carried forward on all
later cars, improved ride quality and had better weight distribution.
Porsche also flared the rear wheel wells some, allowing slightly
wider tires, and used twin batteries mounted in the front corners to
improve weight distribution.  (Remember the dopey iron weights
used in the very early cars' bumpers?)

I could be mistaken, but the 69 912 should have had these same
chassis improvements (maybe not the batteries?).  The 68 911
had horrible air-injection emission controls which caused plug
fouling, and overheating.  The 912 may not have, due to its
different engine.

The early 912 engine was the same as the 356SC (it is said it
was "detuned").  So this was a true Porsche engine.  The 76 912E
was not.  It was an Audi, I believe (or could it have been the old
VW 412?).

Hope that helps.

That's all it takes. I'm not sure if this is the same procedure on later

Hi Craig,

Sorry I missed a fellow p-filer at the event.  I was there too, had a very 
enjoyable
week-end.  It was my first time to Tremblant, and as you and I know, it's a 
gorgeous circuit, technical and long like Bridgehampton, but green and with 
good run-offs like Lime Rock.  Highly recommended.  RSR runs a very nice 
event.  The Saturday evening dinner at the top of Mt. Tremblant was 
wonderful.

(I couldn't get my car to stick all week-end, one reason/excuse for being 
rather slow.  Found out later that my fancy-pants digital tire gauge's 
batteries had gone off.  While it read 30 PSI, I had more like 38 to 40 PSI 
in the tires!  Argh.)

>1. Can I use a "regular" four-finger engine stand to hold a 944 motor?
>I have one, but I know there are special stands for 911's...

Dunno 100%.  You won't pull the threads, they're adequate to the job.  I do 
know from experience that you do *not* need the bespoke 911 stands.  The 
shop uses generic, adjustable stands for 911 engines, not even Snap On, and 
they are fine.

>2. Would such a loose pulley (broken crank key, I'm assuming) cause or
>be caused by a main bearing failure/bent crank? Would such a loose
>pulley perfectly imitate a knock deep down in the engine?

a) Probably not, b) quite probably.  If I were you, I would give some 
thought to fixing the PS pulley and putting the engine back in your car. 
 I'll bet your bearings are fine.

>3. If the crank is bent, though, I may have a line on an '89 944S2

If you get *everything* under the hood, you're probably OK.  But a lot of 
stuff is different on the S and S2, all over the place.  Think about the 
transmission in particular.

I think the tool is a 12 mm internal spline, er, could be 10 mm.  You can 
get Stahlwille sockets from Performance Products, I think, not too much 
money.

The rubber-centred clutch pack is fine.  Like I've said before, the 
spring-centred clutches fail too, generally because the spings break or, 
with the pre-S 951's, the friction material comes free of its disk.  When 
the rubber centre fails, the rubber bits usually fly out and lodge in the 
perimeter of the pressure plate case.  You can drive the car home, gently, 
on the travel stops.  (I've done it.)  When a spring breaks, it as often as 
not lodges and inhibits clutch/declutch.  Or it gouges the flywheel face. 
 Moreover, the spring-centred clutches transmit much more shock to the 
transmission, which is why 951's chew transmissions and R&P's.  Figure it 
this way: Porsche decided that the rubber centre was OK for the 200+ hp 
944S2.

     I decided that since the car was new to me I would take it into a

     out of the ordinary.  I also specifically told the them that the tube 
     to the vacuum advance was disconnected and plugged...
     
     I got it back a few hours later, the vacuum advance was reconnected 
     and the car was idling at about 900-950, a vast improvement. I drove 
     home no problem.  On my way to work I noticed , especially in lower 
     gears, that after accelerating up to 3000 rpm or so and changing gear 
     the rpm would drop down to 500 and the car would "sputter" for a 
     second or two , by which time I gave it some gas and that brought it 
     back up.
     
     I have worked on old cars before but none of them Porsches and none of 
     the fuel injected.  Apart from checking for leaks in the vacuum hoses, 
     using the suggested carb cleaner, what else may I want to check?

Or you can get the BFG HR-4's in a 195/60 (maybe 195/65).  On the race car
it almost impossible to get these to squeel on the on ramps and off ramps
with the race suspension.  They are also REALLY impressive in the wet.
Never tried them in the snow as the race car doesn't work well then :-).

Subject: Purchasing a 928, what to watch for?


  Well I've been thinking of buying a 928S ('84-'87) for a while now and
I think I may finally have convinced myself to do it.  So...

  What sort of problems/maintenance issues have people seen with th 928?  I
don't care if "its expensive to get fixed" unless you have actually gotten
parts from a discount supplier and found them expensive.  I have access to
a fully (well almost fully) equiped shop and I do my own repairs.  Also I've
owned european cars before and had plenty of people tell me repairs would
cost $600-$800 when if you do it yourself it really only costs $250.

  What I'm looking to know:  How much maintenance does the valve train need?
How long does the timing belt last?  Anyone changed one?  How are 928s in
adverse weather conditions?  In general what sort of problems have you
experienced?

  Finally, what do you LIKE and DISLIKE?  My knowledge of 928s really isn't
up to what I know about the 911, 914, 944.  What I do know I really like
and I'm willing to put up with a bit of a headache if I need to :-).

  If this is a BIG mistake someone please convince me and I'll find a nice
944 Turbo.... :-)  (BTW, I'm thinking of going with an automatic).

  Thanks!

I'm looking for a pair of C seats in rebuildable condition, but there's

Less ideally, all the parts would be there and reusable.

Subject: RE: '69 912 a better car

The '69 912 is considered a better car than a pre-'69 for a few
reasons I know of.

1.  Fenders are flared a little more so you can do
wider more modern profile tires
2.  Battery tray moved to prevent acid rotting apart
the suspension mounting points (This is a $1000-$2000 repair
needed on almost every pre - '69 models)
3.  Turn signal lenses instead of single-piece body
turn signals -- much cheaper to replace

    Yes.  In CA, I think, the "exempt" years start at (I think) 1965.  Later
has to pass a sniff test, even on pre-emissions equipped cars.  Just no visual
check (except possibly for "original"-type induction and/or exhaust).

    Yes.  I know of a number of people (including at least one SC) that have
passed the sniff test with a "test pipe" or other substitute for the cat.  I
don't know if they had to tweak the heck out of the mixture, but they passed.

    It's easier to pass visual when you get a smog tech that dosen't even
know which end of the car the engine is in.  One guy smogged my stock 914
1.8L as a VW 1600, checked off the "carbs OK" box, and checked "FI n/a",
when all of the FI was right there, staring him in the face!  I could have
brought a really radical racer in, as long as I could tweak it to meet the
sniff test, and had it passed.  Oh, well.

My apologies if this question has been asked before, but how low
can one lower an '81 911SC without running into problems with 
the tires rubbing the fenders?  I currently have the stock 
6" Fuchs on the fronts and 7" Fuchs on the rears.  The car 
is currently set at European height, but I was thinking about 
lowering it a little more.  Will the 911 handle better or worse?  
I understand lowering a some cars past a certain point will 
actually make the car handle worse.  Something about center of
gravity.

    The decel valve should give you some control over how quickly the
engine spools down from higher RPM.  But basically it seems to just be
there for emissions.  It seems to be a throttle bypass, kinda like the
idle air passage and the aux air regulator.  Gets air from one side of
the throttle to the other.
    The reason that they changed from a fuel cutoff to a throttle bypass
is (according to Probst's _Bosch_FI_and_Engine_Management_ book) because
air-cooled engines frequently put out more emissions when going from
normal running to decelerating with no fuel.  I think he said that it's
due to "uneven cooling"...  Whatever that really means.

They're definitely at Audi doing mischief.  Wife's 1990 Audi 80 is on its
third bottle assembly due to some nonsense (and second gas tank...do you
think Gerhard und Fritz did this, or should I blame MTBE fuel?).

Fortunately, all have been no charge, even though the warranty had run out

In a word, no.  While I don't have the numbers in front of me, Tracy did a
lap that would have qualified him 5th on the grid for the previous weekend's
race at Estoril.  He went faster in Verstappen's car than Verstappen did, 
despite never having driven an F1 car before (and Verstappen, heavily hyped
pre-season, has driven it all year).

Schumacher was testing new spec Goodyear tire; Tracy was running with those
tires *after* Schumacher had run them off.  All reports that I have read,
from a variety of sources, say that everyone was extremely impressed with
young Mr. Tracy.  Tracy is _seriously_ fast, but not yet predictable.

I'd would call his performance at Estoril "driving the wheels off it".

    At least part of this is due to the longer wheelbase.  It supposedly
made the 911 more tractable, and gives a better ride.  There were probably
other refinements.

>Also, any thoughts about the '76 912E ?

    Heavier than the earlier 912s.  2.0L 914 engine with thermal reactors,
catalytic converter on it, also the AFC (L-jet) FI more or less from the
1.8L 914.  Still only 90 HP, but probably a wider torque band, due to the
larger displacement.
    The AFC FI is regarded by some as problematical.  It *hates* vaccuum
leaks (don't ask how I know), the flapper box is expensive and thought by
many to be too fragile, and it dosen't work as well as the D-jet up above
4K RPM.  Fine for around-town driving, not so great for racing, etc.
    It also suffers quite a bit in comparison to similar-year 911s.  The
earliest 912s were only down 20 or so HP from the base-level ('T') 911s.
In 1976, most 911s seemed to be 'S' models, with 150+ HP (?)--a big dif-
ference.
    My personal opinion:  bleah.  914 more fun, 911 more power.  914/6 
both.  And with the prices people want for the 912E's, you can get a
very good 914, or most of a 911 or 914/6.

Well, I've actually used these on my 914 as street/track tires.  Very
reasonably priced and they stick pretty well, too.  Infact, I was only
just over .5 second off the 2.0l 914s in my class running A008Rs's.  I

So what should one do if your 944T is putting out 300-325hp? Spring centered

Wow, Dave, thats some serious rubber!!!  I calculate those tires to be just over 3 feet wide. :) :) :)
I know, I know, it was just a typo...

The reason I'm worried about 195's fitting is that my aftermarket wheels are closer to the outer fender
than my stock steel spare wheel.  I measure 3 7/8 inches from the mounting flange to the inside of the
rim.   With stock 165 width tires, I have just about 1/2 inch of clearance between the tire and the outer
fender.  My stock steel spare rim measures 4 7/8 inches and the tire actually rides closer to the inside
of the wheel well than the outside. 

If I know the right way to calculate offset, zero offset would mean that the mounting flange would be
located at the half-way point of the rim width.  (2.75 inches for my 5.5 inch rims).  Anyone/everyone
feel free to correct me on this.  That would mean that the stock steel rim has an offset of
2.75 - 4.875 = -2.125 inches and the aftermarket wheels have an offset of 2.75 - 3.875 = -1.125 inches.

How does this compare to offset of the rims that you are using?

Subject: Pirelli tires has-beens

Hi, Stan.
 
Agree 100 percent on your assessment of Pirelli. Yes, in the early and mid
70s, the CN36 was THE tire. Then the P7 was developed specifically for the
911 Turbo, and for nearly a decade it was the ultimate high performance
tire. Then everybody else passed it by. The P Zero is not a financially
viable option for anybody but Italian exotic car makers, and it has no
significant advantage over Japanese and other Euro performance tires.
 
I've owned cars with CN36, and have gone through I don't know how many sets
of P7s on various 911s, but these days I stick with Bridgestone and
Yokohama. The C4 parked outside (temporarily, unfortunately) has Michelins
on it and those are pretty damn sticky too.

The valve gear uses hydrolic (I JUST forgot how to spell that word!) lifters
so the valve train is nothing to worry about.

I don't know how long the cam belt will last and have not changed mine yet.
It's new to me (the car) and has 109,000 miles on it.  The dealer charges
$62.00 for the belt.

In rain, even with junk tires, it feels stable.  The wipers (front and back)
work great and the ventilation system is very powerful.  Lights are also very
bright and interior is comfortable w/ lots of glass. Brakes are powerful and
easy to modulate in bad conditions; i.e. drunks, tires in roads, cars in road,
cops in road, etc.

Who came first: Chevy or Porsche.  In 196X when both companies had air

I have the A-509's on my Corolla, and they are awesome in the wet, quite
nice in the dry. They really shine when it's damp - the start of the
rain lifts the oils and other slick stuff up out of the crevices in the
road surface, and the heavier rain hasn't washed it away yet. With the 509's,
I can just ignore it and crank right along, with lots of margin, while people

I liked my Corvair a lot - 64 coupe, 110hp - but I would not put it in the
same class as either a 356 or a 911, and I don't think Chevy would either.
They thought they were building the Nissan Sentras of their day, and yes, the
hot models were nice little SE-R analogs, but never a sports car.  That 
doesn't make the driver of either one a poser.  Certainly Chevy was the one
appropriating ideas, not the reverse, unless you believe that F. Porsche only
learned in 1964 how to count to six.  Chevy was also the one more ready to
compromise the idea, first by building 80 (SAE) hp 2speed automatic four-doors
and then by running away and hiding from Ralph Nader.

Given Chevrolet's loyalty to a design concept, if there were still a Corvair,
the way there is STILL a 911, it would probably be the size of a Caprice, with
a pickup bed in front, driven by both passenger-side wheels.

Subject: Re: 944 engine work & clutch (long-winded questions about)

Hi, Craig,

About your questions:

1) Can I use a "regular" four-finger engine stand to hold a 944 motor?

Yes, you can. I do it all the time and have no problem at all.  Make sure
that the bolts do not go too far into the block or they will break the 
mounting points for the bell housing.

2) Would such a loose pulley (broken crank key, I'm assuming) cause or
be caused by a main bearing failure/bent crank? Would such a loose
pulley perfectly imitate a knock deep down in the engine?

What might have happened is that the large crankshaft bolt (the one that
also holds on the PS pulley, might have backed out enough to allow the 
driving hub of the oil pump to stop turning the gear inside the oil pump,
thus causing a lack of oil pressure.  That, in itself, can cause a spun 
bearing anywhere, including the main or rod bearings... Probably not a bent 
crank, YMMV.

3) Swapping 944S2 Motor - Never done it, my usual advice to those who wish
to do 944/turbo/16 valve swaps - sell your car and buy the original.  ALWAYS
cheaper to do it that way.

4) Size of the 12 point socket - 12 MM.  Get the best one you can find.

5) Rubber center clutches - I use a rubber center clutch in my 83 944, best
price these days is from PAR in Yonkers, @ 449 for the rubbercenter clutch,
throwout bearing and pressure plate.  Spend another $20 for the pilot
bearing and you're in fat city.  When I replaced my original clutch after 65K
miles, the rubber center was perfectly intact.  Those that have failed have 
tended to be on machines that had "rev the engine to 6000, sidestep the
clutch pedal" starts on them.

We had a guy in our PCA Region who said, "the car acts funny when I do this"
and showed me his Big Daddy Garlits launch.  So I said, "stop doing it."  He
didn't and did grenade his clutch soon thereafter.

For most Porsche 944 drivers, who acknowledge that the car is not a
dragster, this is not a large problem.

Once again, YMMV.

Hi, Javier,

Removing the rear seats on a 1988 944...

If you have a single seat back (two persons wide), the upper part is removed 
by unbolting the pivots (one shouldered 10 mm bolt on each side).  A 1/4
inch drive should let you in there.

If you have two seat backs (each one person wide), each upper part should
have the same kind of shouldered 10 mm bolt on the outer pivot.  The fiche
is not too clear at this point, but the inner pivot should just pop out of
its mount.

The seat bottom is glued in place.  After removing the seat belt anchor
bolts, start at the lower front edge of the seat (near the floor carper) and
gently begin to pull it up with your fingers.  It will eventually begin to
release from the chassis.

>...Who came first: Chevy or Porsche...Which company had the REAL sports

True story here: Back in 1962 or 1963, my across the street best friend had
an uncle who owned a Porsche. Co-incidentally, a co-worker of mine had a
Corvair Monza. As luck would have it, the Monza owner showed up at my house
at the same time as the Porsche owning uncle was across the street
visiting.  A discussion ensued over exactly the topic suggested above.

A quick drive to a deserted (relatively) road and a drag race was on.

The P-car was quicker off the line, but only off the line. As soon as the
turbo on the chevy spooled up, he was gone, gone, gone.

"Ah yes" said the uncle. "But you should try me up a canyon".

Another quick drive to the mouth of a nearby canyon.

I was riding in the Monza, my across the street friend was riding with the
uncle. With a wave of the hand the race was on. The P-car again got the
jump but was soon passed by a couple of smug individuals who had no clue as
to what was about to transpire.

The entrance into the canyon began with a tight left-hand sweeper and onto
a short straight and then into some twisties.  At the exit from the sweeper
I looked out the back window. The Porsche was twenty car length behind. At
the end of the straight he was thirty lengths back. We entered the twisties
at at least two times the speed limit. The Corvair was beginning to use up
a lot of road. I was no longer looking out the back window, I was holding
on for dear life. I had driven this canyon dozens of times but *NEVER* at
this speed.

By now we were using both lanes of the road. Not on purpose either. The
exit from the twisties was an up-hill right hander across a narrow bridge.
I was yelling at my co-worker to slow down, but to no avail.

To make a long story short, it was at this moment that the Chevy gave up
all desire to be a Sports Car, and instantly reverted back to its original
design as a tail heavy, softly sprung, four passenger piece of Detroit
Iron. You know, the kind of car that always knew that real cars have their
engines in front. As The car looped backwards, we found our selves staring
into the front hood of the Porsche. He had been right on our collective
ass. The Porsche blasted past on the inside as the guardrail made a hell of
a mess of the passenger side if the Monza.

Ralph Nader was right!!!

Mike,

Here is what John Douglas Porter sent me:

Scott, (this is long)

OK, we're closing in on a solution to the tire inflation problem.

I had assumed that air compressors used for your application were a cut
above run-of-the-mill service station types.  The compressors we use to
provide air in our labs include condensors and filters to remove water
and oil mist, for example, although they don't provide CO2-free,
water-free air.  Hence, in my previous notes, I had assumed that the
tires were filled with "equilibrium air" of the same composition as the
external environment, i.e. air equivalent to "divers' air".

Enough of a preamble.  If there is liquid water present in the tire, then
the situation is different from the conditions of my previous note.

In the previous note, the total number of moles of gas in the tire was
assumed to be constant.  If there is liquid water in the tire, this will
not be a valid assumption.  The reason is that the number of moles of
water vapor will change with temperature, even though all the other
components will be constant.

First, consider the (ridiculous) extreme where there is a large amount of
liquid water present in the tire when the tire is filled at 25 C.  Assume
that the volume of water is Vw (L).  Then everything from my last note is
valid at 25 C (i.e. the gas in the tire can be approximated well by the
ideal gas equation, including the water vapor component), but the volume
of the gas is now Vtire - Vw.

Now, if the temperature of the tire is changed, water will evaporate from
the liquid if T increases and water vapor will condense into the liquid if
T decreases.  Eventually, the system will come to equilibrium.  The
partial pressure of water vapor (the component of the pressure due to the
water) will be equal to the equilibrium value provided there is always
liquid water in the tire.  Here is a short table (there are more complete
ones in the CRC Handbook, for example):

T(C)    T(K)    Pw(atm)
0       273.15  0.006025
10      283.15  0.01212
20      293.15  0.02308
25      298.15  0.03126
30      303.15  0.04187
60      333.15  0.1966
80      353.15  0.4672
100     373.15  1.000

This is a pretty steep curve.  It can be approximated quite well by an
equation of the form:

        log(Pw) = (a/T) + b

where a and b are constants and T must be in kelvin.  You can use a
spreadsheet to estimate a and b if you like, or you can plot log(Pw) vs.
1/T(K), which should be a straight line, to get a calibration curve.  The
curve will only be good between 0 C and 100 C.  The value of Pw is
completely independent of the volume of the gas because there is a
reservoir of liquid water to act as a source or sink of water vapor.

So, as the tire temperature is raised the total pressure in the tire will
increase faster than in the previous calculations (although the ideal gas
equation can still be used for each component of the gas, as before).
Just substitute for Pw from the curve and Vtire - Vw for the volume.

This is obviously a worse situation than before.  So, filling the tire
with any gas in the presence of liquid water in the tire is worse than
filling the dry tire with any gas.  In other words, using nitrogen in the
presence of liquid water will be just as bad as using compressed air with
liquid water.  You want to get rid of liquid water in the tire.

OK, what about a more realistic situation, where there is a small amount
of liquid water in the tire?  For example, let's say you have
overinflated the tire (off the car), then rotated it to get the water
over the valve and released the pressure to expel most of the water.

In this case, there could be too little water for the system to remain
saturated with water vapor at all temperatures.  In other words, as the
temperature of the tire is increased, there may come a point where all the
liquid water evaporates.  The approach described above should be applied
for temperatures where there is still liquid water in the tire.  When
there is no liquid water, then the situation is analogous to my previous
note once again, except that the total number of moles of water vapor is
larger than assumed before.

So, this gives another way to empty the tire of water.  Deflate when the
tire is hot enough for the water all to be in the gas, then refill with
dry air.  Repeating once or twice will give you a bone-dry tire.  Which
brings you back to the "gas is gas" condition where nitrogen is no
different from any other (non-condensible) gas.

Let's do an example calculation.  Assume there is 50 mL of liquid water
remaining in the tire when it is inflated at 25 C (rather a large amount,
I think -- you would hear it sloshing).  This is 0.050 L x 55 mol/L = 2.75
mol water.  Assume that the tire is 22.4 L again.  If all the water was in
the form of vapor, then the partial pressure of the water would be
approximately Pw = (2.75 x 0.08206 x 300) / 22.4 = 3.0 atm.  This is
un-physically high (compare the values of Pw in the table above).  Hence,
50 mL water constitutes an "infinite volume" of water according to the
distinction given above.  If there was this much water in the tire, then
basically it wouldn't all evaporate until the temperature of the tire was
greater than 100 C.  Hence, you could look up the partial pressure of
water from the graph or table.  So, if your tires reached 80 C during a
run, the partial pressure of water would be 0.4672 atm, independent of the
volume of the tire or the pressures of the other components.  The original
partial pressure at 25 C is almost insignificant compared to this, so you
would take the "ideal gas" solution described in my last note and add
approximately 0.43 atm to it.

How little water do you need to make sure it is all evaporated at, say, 60
C?  Look at the value of Pw in the table: Pw = 0.1966 atm.  Put this into
the ideal gas equation to solve for n:  n = (0.1966 x 22.4)/(0.08206 x
333) = 0.16 moles.  This corresponds to 3 mL of liquid water, which isn't
much.


So, what are the general conclusions regarding tire inflation?

First, the ideal gas equation provides a good description of the
non-condensing gases in the tire.  The van der Waals equation is better,
but only by a percent or so at lower temperatures and by an even smaller
margin at higher temperatures.  The main message of these models is that
temperature is really the key parameter that needs to be measured and
controlled, if possible.

In order to use these models to predict the cold pressure needed to
achieve the desired race pressure, it is necessary to know: A) the
atmospheric pressure outside the tire, B) the differential (tire gauge)
cold pressure, C) the (cold) temperature, D) the (cold) tire volume and
E) the final (hot) tire temperature.  A better estimate would be obtained
if the hot tire volume were known (we assumed it didn't change in the
last note.  As you pointed out, it will increase with pressure, but not
by much once the tires are at their correct working pressure.  This could
be calibrated by immersing the tire and rim in water and measuring the
displaced water, correcting for the volume of the rim.)

Alternatively, the tires could be warmed to their race temperature and
the pressure adjusted to the desired value.  This could be done by
immersing them in hot water at the correct temperature, for example.

As far as inflating your tires is concerned, any non-condensing gas will
do, since they all behave similarly over the P-T range of interest.
Hence, pure nitrogen will be indistinguishable from air.

The presence of a condensing gas in the tire below the "dew point" of the
gas is bad.  The example given here is water.  The presence of liquid
water in the tire will cause the variation of P with T to be more extreme
than predicted by the ideal gas (or vdW) equation.  Even though the
situation is less ideal, it can still be taken into account and modeled if
necessary, using the equations given in this note.  Better to avoid this
complication, however.

It doesn't take much liquid to have an adverse effect.  A few mLs in the
hypothetical example tire was enough to have a big effect on the pressure
as the tire was warmed.

Hence, the use of _dry_ gas to fill your tires is very desirable.  The
use of _dry_ nitrogen is a good thing, then, if it avoids the
introduction of liquid water into the tire.  Alternatively, you could use
_dry_ air and get the same performance.  (Not all nitrogen tanks contain
dry nitrogen.  I have heard water sloshing in some.)  Dry compressed
(tank) air will give the same behaviour as dry compressed (tank)
nitrogen.

If you have your own compressor, and you suspect that water mist is
getting into your tires, I would suggest fitting a drying cartridge to
the output line.  There are commercial ones that contain a water adsorber
(like DriRite) and the adsorber can be reconditioned by baking in a
microwave.


Executive summary:

        dry air = dry nitrogen

        liquid water in tires = bad ... get rid of it if possible

Hope this helps.

I got a non-valid registration card (one that clearly states this
on it) This only documented the fact that you had started the transfer 
and paid your use tax within the required 10 days of obtaining the vehicle.
If you do not return with a smog certificate later you will receive a
letter from Sacramento stating that you have an incomplete registration
in process. (I believe it says get a smog cert or sign on the dotted line 
that you are not using the car anymore)

Well anyway, unless different DMV branches operate differently, I don't
think that you could get a car registred in CA without getting 
a smog cert. 
But of course there are many ways of getting that cert ;)

Jon, et al,

I also have had difficulties lately with pfiles digests on AOL.  I seem to be
able to extract all of the postings, but sometimes things are pretty screwy.

I seem to remember Stan saying something about some people's online services
having a hard time with the digest versions - speaking for myself, AOL did
fine with them.  If pfiles was a democracy, I'd vote to change the digests
back to the way they were.  It's not, but that's OK - I'll take it anyway I
can get it:>).

Subject: 944 belt idlers and tensioners


Much has been written about the changing and inspection of 944 timing
belts but no one has mentioned how you are supposed to check whether the
belt idlers and tensioner rollers are any good. I have heard of cases
where they've been known to take the belt with them on failure but is this
common? How long can I expect the originals to last usually?
 
In Peter Morgan's book, 'The Porsche 924/944 Book', pg. 95, regarding the 
timing belt, he states:

'The 1985 recommendation was that the tension must be adjusted again 
after 750-1500 miles (at the initial service),once the belt has completed 
its initial stretching. This has now been relaxed to 2000 miles.....After
this, routine checking is advised every 12,000 miles. The belt is claimed 
to last the life of the engine.'

Is the last sentence true? This seems to go against everthing I've read or 
heard.

Subject: Re: '69 912: a better car?

Dear Pallis:

     Yes, you're right- the '69 912 is , IHMO, the best of the 912's. It has
a longer wheelbase, and is the last of the Real 912's, but more importantly
it has NO SMOG PUMP unlike the '68 912. The '69's use Teflon coated intake
manifolds to eliminate the dreaded air pump that most all '68's had removed
long ago (although with smog inspections being  all the rage these days, the
lack of a smog pump is coming back to haunt the '68's. In spades.)
      Thanks to the lack of cold air being injected into a hot head, '69
912's crack the heads less frequently than '68's do. (The expectation now is
that three of the four chambers on a '68 912 will be cracked!)

     '69 912's also have a modified Rear Mount with 6 rubber cubes. (Previous
years from 67-68 had 4 rubber cubes; 1965 and early '66's use a solid rear
mount.) The 6 rubber cube rear mount does a better job of keeping engine
vibration from bad Solex carbs from being transmitted to the driver and his
passenger(s), and is a Better Idea.
     All in all, the '69 912 is my favorite 912.  '76 912E's are orphans,
made for only one year and have a modified VW 411 engine, NOT a "real"
Porsche engine. And good luck trying to find parts for a '76 912E- most
everything on the engine is special and since they only made 'em for 1 year
things are kinda rare.

   Just my $.02.

Subject: Re: 944 belt idlers and tensioners

Hi, Chris,

To check the idlers on a 944 one may remove them from the timing belt
housing and spin them by hand, listening for problems.  That's the cheap
way... The expensive way is to replace them at regular intervals.
Since the bearings are sealed, there is no way to predict when the failures
will occur, but they do occur.

As far as the belts lasting the life of the engine, when they break, the
engine is DEAD!  I guess that Mr. Morgan must have had his tongue in his
cheek when he was writing the article.

I change the timing belt at 15K intervals, since they are cheap at $9 or 10,
and if you have the right tools and the right attitude, it can take as
little as an hour.  After all, it is a maintenance item, like oil filters and
fuel filters.

If it's like the Blaupunkt that was in my car, it has a hole at each corner
of the front panel through which you can stick a nail, which you want
to do because it releases the spring clip that's holding the front of the 
radio to the dashboard.

If you jam a nail into each of the 4 holes, releasing the clips, you can
pull the radio forward and out of the hole.

Good luck.

Does anyone have a good source for a reasonably priced fuel injection
pressure gauge with fittings? I need to test the fuel pressure on my '85 911.
It's checked via a test fitting on the fuel rail.

What about fabricating one? You can get a gauge that reads to 100 psi at
any plumbing store for $5-$10. Of course, the threads are not metric.
Anyone know a source of hose/adapters that would allow me to use an
inexpensive gauge? I believe I need an M14 x 1.5 compression fitting to
properly attach to the fuel rail.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Bill,

Good to see another old Corvair veteran.  I loved/hated my Black '65 Turbo
Corsa coupe (white Naugahyde interior, white beltline pinstripe, full IRS
and 180 hp).

I loved the car, but hated its piss-poor assembly, and the Lawton, OK
dealer I bought it from and had to deal with. It had a terrible surging
condition at 30 mph, that I never got eliminated, but I *loved* the way it
would *smoke* full sized, power-pack Chevys.

'65 was the year the Corvair went from swing-axle to full-IRS, and I do
believe that it would corner at least as well as any stock Pcar of that
year (Gasp! Oh! the heresy...).  On the handling score, there was no
comparison between the IRS and swing-axle models, which were *evil*
incarnate!  I discovered this fact while in the mountains just out
Saltillo, Mexico. Corner hard, ooops, inside rear lifts, tucks, rolls tire
off rim, swap ends, flip, <crash>.  Get our, look around <turn green when
discovering good fortune in crashing into side of mountain, not over
1000'(+) drop on outside of curve).  (another long story omitted,involving
curious Mexican laws) Discoverd charms of driving 1200 miles, from Saltillo
to Dallas, sans benefit of windshield.  Not recommended, if you can avoid
it, by the way

I wasn't real charmed, though, by the fact that although it would run
happily all day at 95 mph, about 10 secs or less after hitting 100, the
overheat alarm would go off, and the cyl head temp would hit 525 F! < I
never did find out how fast it would go because of that. > If you would
stop and sit patiently on the side of the road to let things cool down, no
harm; but equally, no fun!  Fail to stop *right* now, no engine.  Alas.

Well, it was such a lemon that despite its considerable charms, I couldn't
take more that 8 months of dealing with the problems (or the *#@&% dealer)
and traded it on my '66 Corvette, a car that was assembeled as
exceptionally *well*, as the Corsa had been *Poorly*.  Who says there's no
justice...

For those with RCI.

The Corvair and the 356 have their roots in a common design, the 
"people's car." They suffer from the same design weaknesses in the
rear suspension and location of the engine behind the rear axle.
Corvair corrected this with the later cars -- 66-68. This was never
corrected in the 356.

The significant difference was the 356 was an expensive (for the time)
low volume sports car. The Corvair was the General's small economy car.
For a sports car to outhandle an inexpensive sedan is to be expected.

356s, especially the disk braked cars, very especially the Carrera
versions, were great little cars. Even the base 356 sold for 2 or 3
times the Corvair. The Corvair's were also great little cars --
especially the 66-68. They were sedans, not sports cars. The potential
of the design was illustrated by such things as the Yenko Stinger and
the Fitch.

BTW, the original design for the 911 used the same single cam with
pushrods that the Corvair featured. 

Comparing the Corvair and the 356 is just not appropriate. Different
design objectives. Like comparing apples and koala bears.

Subject: removing a Blaupunkt deck

Matthew,

The Blau head units are a piece of cake to remove. I'm using my '86 944 as a 
reference. There should be four small holes in the corners of the head unit. 
There are U-shaped tools that fis into these holes, that look like the 
handle mounts of rack mounted home stereos. You could probably buy the tools
from an installer, but I made a pair from a wire coat hanger. I have seen 
recent Ford radios use an identical setup. The tools fit in and release
catches on the sides of the deck that hold it into a thin metal sleeve around 
the unit. So, just make up two U-tools out of a coat hanger, so that one 
goes into top and bottom holes on the left, the other into top and bottom on 
the right, and gently pull the deck out of the car, using the tools as 
handles. If you want to remove the sleeve, too, it is held in place in the 
dash by tabs bent out to secure it. When installing the new radio (if you've 
got a windshield antenna) be sure to hook the power antenna booster wire back 
up.

Incidently, current Blau head units are made by Sony, with the exception of a 
couple of the lower line models which are made by Toshiba.

Good luck

My experience as a '66 912 owner is that the '69s are a better
car simply based on the price of pre '69 parts!  Brakes, suspension,
body parts (long wheel base!), almost everything I've been looking
for has been cheaper on '69 and later models.  Plus, lots of parts are made
by non-Porsche manufacturers - so at least you have lots of choices.
If the car needs any work at all and you dont enjoy the "hunt", my advice
is to at least consider '69 and later vintages of p-cars.

Hi, Fred,

Most likely it means that one of the four drain tubes is blocked in some way
(leaf crud, kinked hose, etc.)  You might try removing the sunroof completely
and trying to pour a bit of water down each tube to identify the culprit.

As I recall, the tubes go down the a-pillars and b-pillars.

(I would not suggest compressed air to clean out the culprit, because you
might blow the tube completely off the drain attachment point..)

Does your Blaupunkt have a pair of holes on either side of the faceplate?
There is a cheap special tool that goes in there to release catches, but you

And don't forget, the turbo on those things didn't work worth a damn anyway.
At least not for long. Typical GM solution: hurry up, install it, let the
customer do your development testing for you.
 
Back then, they had no idea how to manage the turbo output,
and just sized the things to choke at high flow rates and so be
self-limiting. Nobody had a wastegate on cars until Porsche brought it out
in the early 1970s. And they had no clue how to cure the bearing coking
problem.

442, is a cutaway of a Corvair engine. I held my hand over the caption and
showed it to a Porsche engine guy. "Oh, yeah, that's an early 901 engine
prototype. We decided to go with a vertical fan arrangement." Then I moved
my hand away, revealing the type and date, well before the 901/911 came out.
"Ach SO...."
 
The Corvair is another fine example of GM taking a great idea and tossing it
on the trash heap of history. Others: Wankel engine in general and
three-rotor Corvette in particular, the Fiero... I forgot a lot of examples
too.

ok, i finally have to jump in here. i race go-karts, and i have a small 
(5x8ft) utility
trailer that i use to haul the kart  and attendant stuff (tools, fuel, 
rain tires, lunch, etc.)
normally, we haul this behind our ford f-250 with a camper on it. there 
is going to
come a time in the future when i want to go to a kart race, and my wife 
wants to
go to a dog show, and i'm going to be left standing at home, holding my trailer
in one hand, and wondering whether it should be hitched up to the Kawasaki
Concours, or to my 928. so...

the question is this: does anybody have a good picture and/or description of
the factory hitch for a 928. i want to use it as a guide for getting my 
local hitch
guru to give me an estimate on building one for my 928.

its going to turn some heads when i roll into a kart race with the kart 
hitched up
behind the 928! very cool...

Hi, Neil.
 
If your Turbo had understeer going into a turn, it was because you were off
the throttle. (This is forgivable on your first turn -- or your first 100,
or first 1000 -- in this car). <g>
 
Easy way to fix the pedals: move the throttle pedal higher. Easy way to move
the throttle pedal higher:
1) Go to Porsche parts counter
2) Buy new plastic throttle pedal
3) Remove existing pedal to make work easier. There is a ball joint about
midway up, pops right out of the plastic socket, and two bolts on the floor.
Hinge is just plastic.
4) Taking new pedal, cut the stop off the back with a hand saw. Cut hinge
off bottom with scissors or whatever.
5) Look at waffling on back of pedal, decide where you are going to put 3
holes for screws. Drill new pedal with clear holes for something like an M5
(metric) or #12 (SAE) countersunk machine screw. Countersink holes in face
of new pedal.
6) Drill holes in old pedal small enough to take thread from screws. Not
necessary to tap; plastic will conform.
7) Bolt this thicker pedal assembly back in.
 
Yes, you sort of tap the throttle with the side of your foot, but it's a lot
better with the thicker pedal.

Subject: Finally, a bad Japanese radio

After bashing Blaupunkt and Becker radios, and saying that the Japanese
offer better price/performance tradeoffs, I have to take that back, at least
in part. The Carrera 4 I have now has an Alpine stereo/CD deck in it, and it
is absolutely the pits. It's one of the removable face jobbies (reminds me
of the hockey game in the leper colony -- they had a face off in the
corner). Anyway, the pushbuttons feel cheap, the whole face moves when you
push something, the controls are not user transparent (have to get out the
manual), functions do not work conventionally (to store a station in memory,
you have to hold the preset button, and then when the display blinks, PRESS
IT AGAIN.) Worst of all, either the radio or the speakers are responsible
for absolutely dismal bass, with unbearable distortion. I'm not even talking
about Brian Adams, cranked full blast here (the Becker in the Mercedes 600
SEC at least did that well, it sounded so good I got sick). We're talking
Enya, "Shepherd Moons." Not your typical hard rock with lots of bass.
 
Past experience has shown that humans can get used to anything (including
Democrats in the white house), and I'm sure Carrera owners will get used to
this stereo deck, but with all the good Japanese decks out there, why did
Alpine copy the worst features of Blaupunkt and Becker, combined?

Subject: Stumbling 944


Am new to group so hope I don't break any of meister Stan's rules
and get roasted.

Thank you in advance to anyone who actually wades thru this mess with me.

Riddle that beats the "experts".....

Have '88 944 (136,000 mi) "stumbling idle" problem.  Also stumbles
under acceleration, especially at lower revs (2500 or so). Bought
U.S. spec 944 new, Tourist delivery Stuttgart Sep '87.  Have had
problem for 2-3 yrs.   Problem has stumped dealer AND two
independent local shops [who claim specialization in
German / Bosch / Porsche].  Taking matters into own hands.
Tired of throwing $$$ to incompetents only to hear how everything
checks out fine.  Collecting data re areas to check.  Don't own
Bosch injection manual but considering one.  Only have Haynes.
Wish I could get better schematics without spending $200+ for
factory manuals.





Detailed problem description.....

Only happens in COLD ambient air conditions - around 40-50F
and below - summer is fine.  Problem same with cold OR hot engine.
On idle stumble tach visibly dips to 50 or so (engine nearly stalls
out totally) then, ALWAYS, something steps in and revs back to
1000 or so and holds OK - for a moment or so.  Never dies
completely - just acts like it will.  Believe same problem manifesting
itself as momentary [often violent] stumble under acceleration.
Never misses under steady cruise.  Car has some history of
electrical gremlins.  Suspecting electrical rather than fuel.





Some electrical gremlins.....

Random, intermittent LOUD thumps in audio sys - usually
shortly after start of engine - then no more.

Fog lights stuck on - could not turn them off - was finally able
to cycle full headlight actuation in various combinations with
fog switch and get them to go off.  Other times, had to pull fog fuse.
Guessing sticky relay.

Recently blew cig lighter, dome light, etc. fuse - replaced fuse -
fine now for a few months.

Electrical gremlins seem to like rainy, damp weather - no big surprise.





Failed solution attempts (by Dealer, other shops).....

O2 sensor OK.
Fuel pump OK - good pressure.
Distributor checked / cleaned up - OK.
Various electrical grounds verified OK.
Some kind of throttle control plate thingy in intake air path - OK.
I ran a bottle of Techron thru - desperate, I know.






My thoughts.....

Peeked under hood on very dark night - cool light show going
on with original plug wires arcing to engine.  Replaced plug
wire set and plugs - no effect on problem.

Ignorantly went 94,000 mi on factory fuel filter - technician
commented "never seen sludge like that pour out of a fuel
filter" - oops.  Have since changed fuel filter again myself -
no visible sludge at 2nd change.  But maybe figures into things.
Filter located such that engine warming up wouldn't warm it - but
suppose exhaust would (ambient air temp correlation?).  Naaaa.

Original cat clogging? 136,000mi [largely interstate cruising].  Naaaa.

DME unit dying?  Damned expensive item to trial / error
investigate.  Ambient air temp?  Naaaa.

Tried disconnecting after market alarm sys, self-installed
stereo sys - no effect.

ODD SEQUENCE OF EVENTS - maybe bigtime clues here.
Last [non-dealer] tech identified bad air box.  Air box, incidentally,
also has [I think] intake air temp sensor in it.  Ambient air temp
correlation?  Hmmmm.  So.......installed new (rebuilt) air box
(not cheap) from Python Injection via Imparts.  Car barely ran
at all - useless.  Bad air box I said.  So did my technician.  Fine.
Shipped back air box.  Got exchange (noted s/n to be certain
they didn't just ship back same).  Installed 2nd new (rebuilt) air box.
Exact same behavior.  Car barely drivable.  OK, maybe Python
injection just sucks as a parts rebuilder.  But....tech then tried his
own air box from his own '87 944.  Exact same barely drivable
behavior yet again.  Hmmmm....new theory suddenly.
Remembered dealer comment that when adjusted CO mixture
setting [as part of problem pursuit] had to use up FULL RANGE
of some adjustment somewhere.  And even then couldn't get it
quite right - but close enough - they said - much to my chagrin.
Things that make you go hmmmm.  Could it be I really did have
a bad original air box and the incompetent dealer techs just
wanged the hell out of some other adjustment(s) to compensate -
poorly.  This last [non-dealer] tech conclusion - sell car in
summer - it's possessed.  I refuse to let this technical problem
beat me.  I do still love the car.  Considering installing yet
another new air box (non-Python just to feel statistically confident),
then limp to dealer again one last time.  But dealers suck.

Need more complete understanding of exactly what inputs
DME unit needs to do its job.

Any clues anyone may have - even long shots - would be
humongously appreciated.  Long shots may be best hope
since "experts" [hofentlich] checked standard causes.

Subject: '73 911 passenger side horn

I recently purchased a pair of OEM horns for my '73 coupe.  The existing
driver's side horn made a pathetic tone and was missing its bugle and the
passenger's side horn was nonexistent.  A few questions came up that maybe the
collective wisdom of porschephiles can solve:

  1) Did my car even come with a passenger's side horn?  The wiring was
     present, but it is debatable whether it had ever been used or not.
     Another '72 owner (Bob Spindel) was also missing that side's horn.
  2) Where do I properly attach the horn?  It came with an approx. 3" long
     bracket with a 6mm hole in one end and an 8mm hole in the other.  I ended
     up connecting the large-holed end to the base of the headlight bucket
     where a bolt comes down and connects to a bracket on the battery box.  The
     other end went to the top of the horn - it is positioned pointing
     downward next to the battery box in front of the tire.  In this
     orientation its flared end is barely inside the lip of the S spoiler.
  3) There was an extra set of horn connections on the driver's side, wired in
     parallel with the ones used.  Did they put both horns on one side if the
     car had a fender-mounter oil cooler (which mine does not)?

BTW I purchased these horns at Zims for ~$25 each.  They are original with the
exception that the bugle-like portions are black instead of red.  The horn now
sounds "like a 911 should sound (tm)".

Just a few observations after listening in on the Newman-Haas
news conference yesterday (the 18th):

Obviously, no-one would say much about Tracy's contract, but
there was plenty of talk about "long-term relationships".
The subject of Penske's option on Tracy for 1996 came up, and 
Tracy made it pretty clear he was not interested in returning
to Penske, and suggested things on three-car team were not nearly
as wonderful as they may have looked from the outside.

Clearly, Tracy was not about to say he'd love to go back to
Penske at a Newman-Haas news conference, but the tone of his
response suggested he'd be quite pissed off if Penske even
made an attempt to exercise his option.

On other topics, the Newman-Haas people indicated neither Michael
nor Paul would be designated as a "number one" or "number two"
driver, and said they were prepared to live with the risks of
having two very aggressive drivers going wheel-to-wheel from
time-to-time.

For those warming up their car-spotter skills for '95, 
Andretti will drive the Texaco-Havoline-Kmart colours; Tracy
will be in the Budweiser car.

Subject: Passing emmisions in an olde car

Hi all,

In Connecticut we've had the emmisions "sniffer" for several years. There are
two basic things to do to get your car to pass. I have not seen any replies
about how to make a car pass, so here is what I have done successfully on
older cars :

1. Add a few cans of dry gas to your tank (without much gas in it). Don't use
the old alcohol style, (methanol?) but the new one recommended for fuel
injected cars. On later cars with oxygen sensors this probably won't help,
but it should lean out older cars a bit.
After testing, fill up the tank with good gas to dilute it.

2. If possible, lean out your mixture, but not so much that you get a lean
misfire. If you read excessive HC after trying this, you probably went too
far and have a lean misfire.

3. Retard your timing. 5 degrees or so should be no problem. I retarded my
'72 S more
than that and it ran VERY HOT so be careful. You may want to adjust it a
block away from the testing center, and set it back to stock after it passes.

4. If possible, adjust your idle speed higher, or slowly depress the gas
pedal when the car is being checked at idle. You will run cleaner at about
1000 RPM's than at low idle.

Hope this helps someone to BEAT THE SYSTEM.

According to Webster's:

A machine that converts any of various forms of energy into mechanical
force and motion is an engine.

A power unit that develops energy or imparts motion is a motor. Examples
given:
        A: A small compact engine
        B: An internal combustion engine
        C: A rotating machine that transforms electrical energy
           into mechanical energy.

Based on this information, an engine is a motor but a motor is not
necessarily an engine. These definitions even hold up in the real world!

Ha-ha.. No, actually I was skeptical about Morgan's claim but doubt he 
made it in jest in his 'serious' book. Don't get me wrong, I would never 
leave the belts in forever. I know Peter Morgan has written other Porsche 
books on 911's etc. but his statement about the 944 cam belt causes me to 
question his technical competence.

phew - thats a lot of stuff! It sure sounds a bit suspicious to me. Have
you tried calling the BBB about this shop?

About the power steering - mine was leaking slightly, and I found that it
was just seeping from where the hose attaches to the underside of the
reservior. There is a hose clamp there, but apparently the hose can
harden. I just bought another clamp from Home Depot and put it on above
the old one, so there are now two clamps on. That fixed my leak. That may
be worth a try, especially if the hose appears to have fluid on it.

Subject: no longer mute!!and 914 stuff

Hi everyone,
Now I think the admins here and at tta.com have figured out how to get us
talking again I will!!
First off The P-car and the Girlfriend had a wonderful trip to western
Maryland. Twisty montain roads. I had a blast with the car. Leaves changing
corners changing speeds change in short change is good. On this trip the
speedo cable broke. Anyone got one for sale. I also need a rain tray. I
think Mike Willis is going to sell me the heater control valve I need. Now
some old messages that bounced back.


Hi everyone,
Now that it is getting cold I have noticed or rather my passengers have
noticed that there is no heat on the right side of the 914 (if it above 40
degrees and dry the top is off). So far I have checked the heater contol
valves and both open and close when I move the switch between the seats.
When the fan is on and the car is off on the left side of the car air is
being blown out in the car but the right side gets nothing. The fresh air
fan works on both sides. under the car it feels like air is coming out of
the heat exchangers near where the engine cool fan is (this is still with
engine off heater fan on). there is no air flow anywhere else on the left
side of the car. Nothing at the heater valve their at all. In addition for
some reason the dealer unplugged the heater fan and now if it is plugged in
it runs all the time. I have three wires. two go into the plug and the
third is dangling from the ground on the left side of the car. If I touch
the ground to the wires in the plug the fan turns on and off. Were is the
ground wire suppose to go so the switch in the car does this?


Exhaust noise. I love it!!!! I know this is an old thread but I have to get
my two cents in. The 914 with monza exaust sounds great to me. The day this
thread broke out I started the car up in front of a crackfinder oops I mean
pathfinder and its alarm went off! In parking garges cars with alarms will
anounce my arival by sounding their alarms. I love the way people turn to
look at my noisy little beast. There are  a few frowns, but most people
smile and give me a big thumbs up. I  went the vintage car races in philly
and the cars were loud and that was half the fun. In fact the M3 that went
around the track at high speeds were boring. No sound except for tire
squeel. A PORSHE is a a sensory joy. The more sensory feed back the better!
Loud exaust steering wheel that talks to your hands about what the road is
doing in relation to the tires and pedals that give feedback on what they
are opening or closing. The joy of a porsche is it includes all the senses
in driving. A loud exaust is just helping a sense join in the fun.

Hi there folks .....

I just returned from a short vacation in the U.K., and
had a really cool experience, that while not *exactly*
Porsche related, is close enough!  

The airfield my dad flew from during WWII is now a
race track (Castle Combe). So, I pulled in to the
pit area which is adjacent to a small sideroad.
The gate was open, and there was some activity
on the track.  The activity, as it turned out, was
the boys from McClaren with two of their million dollar
road cars -- the 220 mph F1.  I had a nice talk with
them, drooled a lot, took a few pix, admired the 400 kph
speedo and the 600 HP + engine, and watched as the
McClaren helicopter came in and landed next to my rental
car.  I was slightly in awe of the whole scene!

Then, in London, I attemted to visit Ben Evans
at his fortress office next to Victoria Station
in London. Ben was on holiday!! Thanks Ben!!! I suppose
next time I should tell you I'm coming your way!! (-B

Jim Bauman
Back in the US, back in the US, back in the US
with my '86 Cab thank god!! 

PS: I saw an ad in one of the London papers for the 993
tiptronic...they were noting the fact that the transmission
is controlled with push buttons on the steering wheel
(like the F1 cars).... THAT would take some getting used
to. It was bad enough having to shift with my left hand,
negotiate roundabouts the wrong way, drive on the wrong
side of the road, watch for pedestrians on humped zebra
crossings, keep my headlights dipped, and wonder what the heck
a stretch of motorway without cats eyes was! But, the Guiness
was great!

If your Blaupunkt is like mine, there should be two holes on both the left
and right side of the front of the deck.  If this is the case, then I've seen
the deck removed by inserting the ends of a horseshoe shaped tool (1 for each
side of the deck) into the holes.  This apparently releases a detent and
allows you to pull the deck out.  I've heard of people accomplishing the same
thing with 4 nails.  A word of caution however, you can apparently damage the
mounting fixture if you are not careful.  If you bought your new equipment
from a store that does installations, they would probably pull your old deck
using the proper tools (and experience) at no charge.  That's how I witnessed
the process.

There was some sort of system problem today that may have caused
some duplication of messages. Seem to have fixed it about noon central

Many people on this list keep complaining about the stupidity of the various 
governments and its intrusion, not to mention all the pork and crooked 
members of congress.  I keep hearing I'd join an organization if I 
thought it'd do any good.  That's the problem!  The National Motorists 
Assn only has about 15,000 members because everyone sits on their ass and 
complains that it is ineffective, then doesn't do anything about it.  

How many of you have written to your congressman recently about a car 
related issue?  How many have ever written?  I write about speed limits, 
HOV lanes, emissions inspections, etc. about every 6 months to some 
elected official.  If only 10% of you did the same they would be hearing 
a much different message than they hear from all the car haters who are 
constantly lobbying them.

The NMA dues are only about $25 a year.  That's less than PCA, and is the 
only source we have at the moment.  They're not perfect, and only 
partially effective, but without a larger membership base what can one 
expect?  

(Flame off mode:)

In the soviet of Washington cars 67 and earlier are exempt from 
emissions.  Cars 68-79 are not inspected to see if emission equipment has 
been removed, unless they don't pass.

Pallis, Pallis....., the thread here seems to be in favor of the 69 912's as 
the better 912.  Not so!! Sayeth I.... The earlier cars IMHO are the better to 
own because they are simply....MUCH MORE FUN TO DRIVE!!!!!! 
 
...and here's the scoop: 
 
First, the difference between the 912 and the 356 (note that I have a 68 912 
targa softback and a 64 356 C cpe, both painfully restored to STOCK FORM). 
Also note that I've done some research and am giving  you stats and driving 
impressions from "professionals" who wrote articles for major auto pubs, not 
just my opinions.  Though I have to concur with them.

sharing the 356SC;s undersquare bore and stoke ratio of 74mm x 82,5mm, the 912 
version reduced compression ratio to 9.3:1, altered valve gear specs, valve 
timing and camshaft design to reduce peak torque output from 4200rpm to 3500 
rpm.  Peak power in both available at 5800rpm.  The tuning changes produced a 
tractable, torquey,engine which could be revved dependably to 6000rpm without 
fear of damage." 
 
You shift at a lower rpm in the 912 because of this and plug in the 5 speed 
not avalilable in the 356 and voila!  faster!!  and it handles, oh how it 
handles. 
 
same article  "a happy byproduct of placing the 4 cylinder in the 911 bay was 
the alteration of the tailhwavy weight distribution of the 911. 41front/59 
rear to 44front/56 rear in the 912.Unlike the twitchy early 911, the 912 
proved virtually impossible to provoke into oversteer.  ...The 912 never 
threatened to swap ends like it's more powerful sibling.  ROAD AND TRACK 
adjudged it's handling to be vastly imporved over that of its predecessor the 
356-'Oversteer is a thing of the past and one no longer need be an expert of 
any kind to keep from losing it even in the wet....  Both ends grip 
tenaciously and about the only way to break the back loose is the same 
technique applied to front heavy cars: brake in the middle of a tight turn."  
If I drive the C over the same roads and at the same speeds as the 912,  I'm 
sideways in the C but just zipping along in the 912. 
 
Now, in 1969, the wheelbase got longer and wider to accomodate the 6 cylinder 
911. These early 911's(pre 69) were also a blast to drive but you had to get a 
little track experience before you got any good at keeping the car facing the 
direction you wanted to go. IMHO, the pre 69 912 was about as well balanced a 
car as one could find,  no need to change it.  The 69 912 lacks quick steering 
and is a heavier car.  It feels better in 911 form then 912. I drove several 
before I got the 68 and was really disappointed. 
 
Now, any of the early cars (65-68) are fine.  The 68 had a smog pump and yes 
it did cause some problems but it's no longer availble and is exempt from smog 
regs even here in Calif.  No pump-no problem! 
 
Parts cheaper in the later models?  Don't know about that but the later car is 
a WHOLE DIFFERENT CAR.   The difference in parts availabilty may be a factor 
but I've had no problem finding parts, new and used.  Also, you can buy a real 
nice, unrusty car in good shape here in Calif. for around 5K. 
 
76 912E?  Don't bother.  From all I've seen of them they don't do anything 
well.  Driving characteristics?  From "Porsche Sport, 1976/77, Joe Rusz blamed 
the 912E's poor handling on overly soft suspension settings and inadequate 
front roll bar size commenting "...there is a noncommittal feel which is 
perfectly acceptable for the non enthusiast driver.  Perhaps that what Porshce 
had in mind when it designed such an indistinct performer".....From previously 
quoted Excellence article "  The car that Porsche had originally devised as an 
amalgamation of the 356 and the 911 had grown flaccid in its 1976 incarnation." 
 
 I focus on driving characteristics in my response because to me, that's what 
Pcars are all about.  There you go.......

Ha-ha.. No, actually I was skeptical about Morgan's claim but doubt he 
made it in jest in his 'serious' book. Don't get me wrong, I would never 
leave the belts in forever. I know Peter Morgan has written other Porsche 
books on 911's etc. but his statement about the 944 cam belt causes me to

phew - thats a lot of stuff! It sure sounds a bit suspicious to me. Have
you tried calling the BBB about this shop?

About the power steering - mine was leaking slightly, and I found that it
was just seeping from where the hose attaches to the underside of the
reservior. There is a hose clamp there, but apparently the hose can
harden. I just bought another clamp from Home Depot and put it on above
the old one, so there are now two clamps on. That fixed my leak. That may
be worth a try, especially if the hose appears to have fluid on it.

Subject: no longer mute!!and 914 stuff

Hi everyone,
Now I think the admins here and at tta.com have figured out how to get us
talking again I will!!
First off The P-car and the Girlfriend had a wonderful trip to western
Maryland. Twisty montain roads. I had a blast with the car. Leaves changing
corners changing speeds change in short change is good. On this trip the
speedo cable broke. Anyone got one for sale. I also need a rain tray. I
think Mike Willis is going to sell me the heater control valve I need. Now
some old messages that bounced back.


Hi everyone,
Now that it is getting cold I have noticed or rather my passengers have
noticed that there is no heat on the right side of the 914 (if it above 40
degrees and dry the top is off). So far I have checked the heater contol
valves and both open and close when I move the switch between the seats.
When the fan is on and the car is off on the left side of the car air is
being blown out in the car but the right side gets nothing. The fresh air
fan works on both sides. under the car it feels like air is coming out of
the heat exchangers near where the engine cool fan is (this is still with
engine off heater fan on). there is no air flow anywhere else on the left
side of the car. Nothing at the heater valve their at all. In addition for
some reason the dealer unplugged the heater fan and now if it is plugged in
it runs all the time. I have three wires. two go into the plug and the
third is dangling from the ground on the left side of the car. If I touch
the ground to the wires in the plug the fan turns on and off. Were is the
ground wire suppose to go so the switch in the car does this?


Exhaust noise. I love it!!!! I know this is an old thread but I have to get
my two cents in. The 914 with monza exaust sounds great to me. The day this
thread broke out I started the car up in front of a crackfinder oops I mean
pathfinder and its alarm went off! In parking garges cars with alarms will
anounce my arival by sounding their alarms. I love the way people turn to
look at my noisy little beast. There are  a few frowns, but most people
smile and give me a big thumbs up. I  went the vintage car races in philly
and the cars were loud and that was half the fun. In fact the M3 that went
around the track at high speeds were boring. No sound except for tire
squeel. A PORSHE is a a sensory joy. The more sensory feed back the better!
Loud exaust steering wheel that talks to your hands about what the road is
doing in relation to the tires and pedals that give feedback on what they
are opening or closing. The joy of a porsche is it includes all the senses
in driving. A loud exaust is just helping a sense join in the fun.

Hi there folks .....

I just returned from a short vacation in the U.K., and
had a really cool experience, that while not *exactly*
Porsche related, is close enough!  

The airfield my dad flew from during WWII is now a
race track (Castle Combe). So, I pulled in to the
pit area which is adjacent to a small sideroad.
The gate was open, and there was some activity
on the track.  The activity, as it turned out, was
the boys from McClaren with two of their million dollar
road cars -- the 220 mph F1.  I had a nice talk with
them, drooled a lot, took a few pix, admired the 400 kph
speedo and the 600 HP + engine, and watched as the
McClaren helicopter came in and landed next to my rental
car.  I was slightly in awe of the whole scene!

Then, in London, I attemted to visit Ben Evans
at his fortress office next to Victoria Station
in London. Ben was on holiday!! Thanks Ben!!! I suppose
next time I should tell you I'm coming your way!! (-B

Jim Bauman
Back in the US, back in the US, back in the US
with my '86 Cab thank god!! 

PS: I saw an ad in one of the London papers for the 993
tiptronic...they were noting the fact that the transmission
is controlled with push buttons on the steering wheel
(like the F1 cars).... THAT would take some getting used
to. It was bad enough having to shift with my left hand,
negotiate roundabouts the wrong way, drive on the wrong
side of the road, watch for pedestrians on humped zebra
crossings, keep my headlights dipped, and wonder what the heck
a stretch of motorway without cats eyes was! But, the Guiness
was great!

(my mail from rahul.net bounces, soooo...)

Okay, something wierd is going on with my 85 944.

a few weeks ago:

my temp gauge would stay pegged in the center (as it should) but at stop lights 
and such, the temp gauge would rise to the caution zone. My big fan wouldn't
come on though.
(rec.autos and this list told me to change the sensor)

last week:
Well, I was broke, and I wanted to fix my other problem, I had some gunk in the
system, so I got some coolant system cleaner and followed the directions.

Lo and behold, my gauges and fans all came on fine and everything worked great.

This week: my coolant leaks like crazy if I stop my car after driving it.
i have to keep putting water in every time I start my car. :(
Also, my fans stay on almost constantly, anyone got tips on wehre to start?

I know I should look for the leak (duh), but I think its at the top of the
radiator on one of the hoses, unfourtunately, this is also the hardest spot 
to look at.

Also, i want to replace my coolant resevoir, any prices for those?

Thanks alot!

As an electrical engineer and a bit of a purest prude, I've always tried 
to make the "proper" differentiation. A motor converts electrical energy 
to kinetic energy (mechanical rotation), while an engine is generally 
considered to be non-electrical (there are many types!)

However, I've given up since just about everyone uses the term "motor" 
to refer to an automobile engine. Might (and mass) make right. So call an 
engine a motor, everybody else does.

I've had an '84 928S for about 18 months - parked it during Jan - March,
since the roads around here are pure salt, and not every bit on the car
is aluminum or galvanized (though most are).

Let's see - timing belts at 45 or 50K miles. I had mine start to make an
audible slapping noise at around 52K - tensioner was at the end of its
travel - drove it slowly and cautiously to the mechanic who replaced all
the belts for about $600. Certainly could be done yourself for the cost
of the belts.

Replaced the clutch master and slave cylinders - about $70 each from Zims.
Master cylinder is buried, so it takes a few hours. Slave cylinder is
easy.

I've had a few electrical gremlins, which seems to be a common complaint.
Mine have been in the antenna, the heating control panel, the inside
temperature sensor, one door's alarm keyswitch,...  Nothing disabling,
just annoying.

The only other complaint at the moment is very weak to non-existent
synchronizers on 1st and 2nd, and a bit of a growl from the trans-
axle which I am pretending not to hear.

I am still terrifically pleased with the car. No way on earth could
I have found a new car for twice the price which would have pleased
me as much. I think that the automatic is reasonable, especially if
you are going to be in traffic a lot - apparently the majority of
US cars were automatic, and it's only a bit slower, according to the
figures in the owner's manual.

Handling in bad weather is really a tire question - the car has 50/50
front/rear weight distribution, so it is different from cars which
have the majority of their weight at one end or the other. Mine has
Pirelli P7's - frowned upon by the list - which for my purposes are
OK in the dry and wet, but pretty hopeless in snow. Porsche
recommends skinnier tires and wheels for winter driving.

Looking forward to see what other responses you get...

Hey, the manual says it will pull 1650kg if the trailer has its own

I recently bought a 1987 944 S.  Regarding this purchases, I have a (naive)

I have heard alot about Porsche owners buying parts through discount houses.
 Who installs these parts?   Can I as an owner simply take the appropriate
parts to a mechanic and have him install them, thus avoiding the high mark-up
at a dealership?  It seems like improper etiquette.

Also, is there anyone out there in the Milwaukee metro area with advice
regarding a good Porsche mechanic/dealer.  I've owned a Porsche before and
I'm sure I will have a frequent relationship with some mechanic, so I'm
trying to prepare before a crisis.

I will be moving to Denver CO. in a month. I am looking forward to moving but I
think it will cause some problems with my 911. I have a 78SC and I will
have to pass smog inspection to get new plates in CO. My problem is that i
currently do not have any of the original injection or exhaust. I replaced the
heat exchangers with SSI and replaced the CIS injection with Carrera electronic
manifolds and injectors, all run with a L-jetronic injection computer from a
Nissan(i had planed to go with programable cumputer in future but smog
inspection has changed plans).
I have a couple options 1) buy all the injection and smog parts to pass
inspection 2) sell the engine and buy a 3.2l 3) trade my engine and trans with
a friend who has a 79 3.3l turbo engine and trans.( with engine apart). I
would like to go with the turbo engine as it is the most bang for the
buck(friend has theft recovery turbo, likes looks but doesnt care much about
speed and looking at high cost of putting engine together). I think the
3.2l would not have any more power at 6000ft than i have now(at close to sea
level). I will do all the work myself and have a good idea of what it will cost
to but 3.3l back together(rebuilt my 3.0l this winter). What problems will I
find in putting 3.3l turbo in SC or 3.0l in turbo? What other options might i
have (would like more power, must pass smog dyno testing in95)? any ideas

Yes, definitely improper etiquette.  Better approach is to buy the parts
cheaply and install them yourself.  Also a cheaper approach.

Keep in mind that the Porsche mechanic, whether he be a dealer or an
independent, is in business to MAKE MONEY!

He not only makes money on labor, but on parts markups...
He takes your money and does what he thinks is an adequate job on your car.

With a little bit of knowledge of basic mechanics, a few special tools, and
mostly non-special tools, some time, and a willingness to get your hands
dirty and learn something, anybody can fix a Porsche.

Also, if you haven't heard my rantings before, join the Porsche Club...for
36 bucks (roughly what mechanics around here get for one half hour's labor)
you get access to experts and porschephiles around the country and around
your own neighborhood.

Keep your money. Strike a blow for frugality. DO IT YOURSELF!

Subject: 10" wheels for 951/Brembo parts

Has anyone tried to fit 10" x 17" wheels on the rear of an 89 944T. Since I
race in the stock class I am allowed to go one size up, wheel wise. I would
like to use 315mm tires on these wheels and also I would like to do this
without altering the bodywork in any way, which is a definite no no in the
stock classes. 
If anyone has done this and knows a reasonable source of wheels please let me
know.
Also I am still searching for a source for brake piston dust covers for this
car. They are Brembos and apparently are made of unobtanium since no one will
sell me the proper parts. They only come in a complete caliper rebuild kit
which includes the piston, the seals, and the dust cover. The price of the
kit is about $50 and you need 4 kits per caliper. Even my simple math tells
me this is ridiculous. Any help or suggestions will, of course, be
appreciated and thank you to the people who are already trying to help.

Hi Nathan,

        I live in the Milwaukee area (actually Burlington WI. - aka "Hick
Town") and have used Capitol Import autos up on Brown Deere Rd. from time
to time. Although I don't have a personal relationship with any of the
mechanics there (I do most of my own work - so I rarely need to go to the
dealer) they have always done good work.

        A better alternative is a Porsche mechanic by the name of Frank
Collins who works at Motor Werks in Barrington, Illinois. Although this
would be a little bit of a drive for you, Frank does excellent work, and
you can bring your discount parts to him and he will install them at his
house (he does a lot of work out of his house, but I don't know how common
knowledge that is around Motor Werks, so if you call him there, I wouldn't
mention his home deal until you speak with him directly - in private). He
is a very busy guy, so if you're in a crunch situation, this may not be the
best, 'cause he usually can't do what you want right away. But if you can
wait until he can do it, you can save substantial money. I don't know if
he'd want me to publish his home number on the net, but if you are
interested in contacting him I could e-mail his number to you after asking
him if it's okay.

        You could also just have the work done at Motor Werks, and request
that you want Frank to do the work. Motor Werks is a very reputable outfit,
and of course, an Auth. Porsche dealer. They are expensive (as is any
dealer), but they are quite a bit cheaper than say, Lynch Porsche in
Chicago.

        Finally, I do agree with George that the best way to do the work is
yourself. The 944 isn't really that hard to work on, and you don't really
need to buy many special tools to do most things. I got my "Baptism of
Fire" a few years ago with my first p-car, a '79 924 euro. What a great car
!!! It was so easy to work on, it was great. The 944 is a little more
complex, but hey, start slowly, build your knowledge with things like this
list (and Jim Pasha's very cool articles in Excellence), and you will get a
feel for working on the car.

        Remember, no mechanic, no matter how good, will do as good a job on
your car as you. I don't mean that the mecanics don't do a good job, most
of them do (at least the ones working in Porsche shops). But hey, let's
face it, when you're working on something that's your own (as opposed to
someone else's), then you're going to do a better job.

        I hope this helps you out. Let me know if you have any questions
about your car, I will try to help as much as possible. It's nice to a
fellow Cheese-head on P-files !!!

trev.

I personally like the look of the SWB cars ('66-'68). Sure, some of the parts
are more expensive, but they've got a look about them...maybe it's an
acquired taste. If you want to add flares or do the '73 RS thing you should
definitely buy a '69 (with a SWB you could make it look like the unbelievably
cool 911R). If you want a car that just screams '60's buy a SWB.

Subject: Purchasing a 928, what to watch for?

A  few thoughts after 2 years of '86 928 ownership (in So Cal.):

The years mentioned (84-87) cover what is arguably the most important transition
in the 928's life: the change with the '85 model to the 4-cam engine.  This is
an important issue because with the 4-cam engine (on the plus side) you get a
whole bunch more power (like well over 50 hp), while on the minus side, due to
piston/valve clearance issues, a broken timing belt's could cost you $4,000+.
This makes timing belt maintenance a Very Big Deal.  As I understand it, the
2-cam US models will simply quit running and your out one belt.  I believe that
Euro 2-cam models will eat valves under these circumstances as well, but at
least there are half as many to replace.

The '87 model ("S4") is in a way the "culturally" more important transition,
since it has a (I think undeserved) reputation for being the year of most
significant improvements in the car.  It is the first year of the only
significant restyling the car got, along with an improved induction system
(which by the way makes the engine *much* easier to work on), electric rather
than belt-drive fan (another work reducer), improved aerodynamics (who cares?),
a better clutch, but not much else that I recall.  I think a good '87 can be had
for very low twenties, where an '85 or '86 should go for about $15-17K.  If I
had it to do over again, I would hold out for an '87, mostly because of the
engine-maintenance issue and the clutch.  I'm lucky enough to have a 5-speed
which I would recommend just because it's more fun, but they are hard to find
representing 20% or less of the US population.

Bruce Anderson's series on purchasing used Porsches in "Excellence" magazine are
must reading here.

My main caution to the prospective owner is go in with your eyes open regarding
parts cost and maintenance requirements. There are many, many 4-digit priced
parts in the car, and they are all packed into the car very tightly, making what
on other cars would be simple operations very time-consuming (John's reference
to the clutch master cylinder being an example).  So, thorough pre-purchase
inspection is absolutely critical here, and availability of a complete
maintenance record is even more desirable than usual.

On the other hand, when it's running right, it's the epitome of effortless and
composed high-speed travel over any paved terrain.  And there's no sensation
quite like the muted bellow the 4-cam V-8 makes in a head-long rush for the
horizon.

the rad to have it checked, but if you're in Canada and you don't put a
lot of mileage on the car, it just isn't cost-effective to buy the
necessary Porsche tools sometimes. For example, on the advice given on
this list, I ordered a Pirelli cam belt from Automotion for $17 US. My
total cost is (parts+shipping)*1.3=$29 cdn + duty $1 + tax $2 + Customs
handling fee $5 = $37 cdn. The dealer charges $74 cdn for this and its not
even Pirelli. Dealer price for balance belt: $192 (Ack!). 
 
Now the belt tensioning tool..The cheapest I've seen is $360 US = $490 
cdn + $18 duty +  $36 tax + $5 customs = $550 cdn not inclu. shipping!
 
The dealer charges $80/hr and quoted a 2 hr job for the belts which works 
out to about 3 to 4 belt changes to break even or 21 yrs given what I 
drive in a year.

I checked and my dealer has no problem with me supplying my own parts. 
The only caveat is they would not warranty the belt (big deal). At least 
the job will be done correctly (I hope). In the past, I've successfully 
replaced the head on my BMW, but on my 944 for certain jobs, I'd just as 
well have the dealer do it, if not for peace of mind.

Subject: 928 Alarm keyswitch problem


In John White's response to "Purchasing a 928, what to watch for?" he mentions
having a problem with one door's alarm keyswitch.  I was just wondering if your
problem resembled my problem.  Namely, every once in a while (like once a
month), under a very specific usage pattern, the alarm will go off when I unlock
and open the driver's door.  The particular usage pattern is that I start the
car from cold in the morning, drive it somewhere for lunch, leave it parked
*uncovered* (it's black, BTW) in the sun (normally it's under a car cover when
parked out doors) for about an hour, and then unlock it.  All I can surmise from
this is that either the alarm "brain" is nuts, or the driver-side alarm switch
closure that is supposed to disarm the alarm brain never arrives, but only under
this particular temparature-over-time profile.

I'd appreciate any hints anyone might have.  My next move will probably be to
swap the alarm brain ($125 new), but I really hate black-magic debugging like
that.  Especially when I have to wait an unkowable amount of time to determine
if I fixed it!

I guess I could attack the "intermittent alarm switch" theory by wiring up a
buzzer or light to go if it is ever the case that the "unlock door" signal is
present when the "disarm alarm" signal is not.  At least then I'd know if it's
the brain's fault.

Thanks,

Alan Watkins.

Subject: passing emissions - a couple more ideas



In addition to Mike's list, here are a couple of other
things I found to help:

    Clean or preferably replace the spark plugs the
    night before you test.

    Pick a warm day, and make sure your car is FULLY
    warmed up when you test (at least 180 degrees)

    On MFI cars, the hose from the left heat exchanger
    to the warm-up regulator must be connected and in
    good condition.

    Pick a time of day when you don't have to wait in
    line if possible.

    Be curteous and polite, so that if you're borderline
    they'll give you a break. - Remember, they will start
    out assuming you're a jerk unless you prove them wrong.
    (also applies to police)

Using the above guidelines and some of Mike's before I 
rebuilt my engine, I sailed through emissions checks 4
years in a row. (the first year I went in with stone guards
over my non-compliant H4's, track-type near slicks and an
attitude) I reeducated myself after getting tired of 
retesting that first year.

Generally, an engine always has pistons but a motor

But, drivers that race in circles always have *motors* -

Subject: 944 Pwr Steering Groans When Cold...

A small question re. the power steering on my '84 944:


When the weather starts to get colder out (like below 50, the way it is
here in Wisconsin), the power steering groans when the car is cold. It only
groans when I turn the wheels and the car is moving slowly or is at rest.
As soon as the car gets even *slightly* warmed up, the groans go away.
There is the proper amount of fluid in the pwr steering reservoir (as a
matter of fact, the system has lost almost no fluid in the last year ...)

So hey, any new wisdom on this would be welcomed. The car has been like
this for some time (it did it last winter - yes I do drive my 944 in the
snow, 'cause it's the *only* car I own), but this only happens during the
colder months. Is there a problem here, or is this normal for the power
steering to groan when it's cold out and the car is still cold ...

Thanks in advance ...

few campers or bicyclists around so I didn't feel like risking  
others. Motorcyclists were sometimes a problem, but cannot really

Subject: Re:  928 Alarm keyswitch problem

My alarm problem is pretty simple - the driver's side door lock neither
arms nor disarms the alarm, and the passenger's side and hatch locks
do. Took me a week or two to figure out what was going on, though.
Every once in a while I would unlock the car, same as any other time,
and the alarm would go off - it finally dawned on me that it only
happened when I had locked it on the passenger's side. I just assume
that the problem is in the switch, since it isn't aggravating enough
to start pulling the door apart - yet.

One question about your problem - how do you turn the alarm off, once
it is triggered? Just twist the key in the driver's side door again,
or in a different lock, or ...? You could try always unlocking the
car on the passenger's side whenever the appropriate circumstances
arise - if it never fails it would tend to implicate the door switch
and its associated wiring. All it would take is an intermittent
connection in the wiring, which is the kind of thing your temperature
cycling would bring out.

Maybe you could just put an LED on the "disarm alarm" signal, and mount
it someplace visible from outside the car. I don't even know whether
it gets grounded or +12v to signal activation, but that should be
(somewhat) apparent from the schematic. My guess is that the black
box is a fairly unlikely culprit - my other guess is that your guess
is the same, but it's the easiest thing to try, so why not?

Keep us posted on your progress, since it is probably only a matter of
time before the rest of the 928 owners have the same problem.

Subject: Re: Beer of choice for Porschephiles

My beer of choice is brewed right here in newark...at 373 W chestnut,
in my kitchen!

People always complain making beer is too expensive/time
consuming/etc.

Here's the deal:

1 hours effort -> 4 cases of pints, any kind you want, $8-10 per case.
Startup cost - $40 includes ingredients for first brew, frementing
bins, lids, bubblers, siphon, capper, etc.

Details below:




Here's the entire process

1) Heat up can of goo in saucepan (so it thins) with lid on
2) Dump out water in saucepan and put in 1 quart
3) Dump goo into saucepan.
4) Heat to boil
5) Fill "Fermenter" (pickle bucket) 3/4 full with cold water
6) Pour saucepan contents into fermenter (bucket "A")
7) Add enough water to fermenter to make 48 pints (5 gallons).   If
you're smart, you'll take 5 mikjugs of water and fill it up first, make
a permanent mark, then you never have to measure again!
8) Sprinkle yeast over mixture.
9) Cover for 1 week until "bubbler" stops
10) Siphon into bucket "B" taking care nbot to siphon ueast at bottom
11) Mix 1 cup "priming sugar" with fermented mixture
12) Bottle using capper and supplied caps, along with any returnable
 bottles from beer distributor.
13) Wait specified time (I always wait 6 weeks)

Yeild: 48 pints.  It's timewise efficient toi double batch it, i.e.
make 2 buckets full, which means you'll have to invest $9 in a second
bucket, lid, and bubbler top.

BUT - it's better than ANYTHING

Maybe you guys should hire the two guys who pulled out my Blau CD player in
about 2 seconds flat as the factory alarm was going off in my '83 944. 
They certainly seemed to know what they were doing, although they didn't
care too much about damaging the plastic on both sides of the radio
housing.

What made it worse was that I had installed the thing about 5 days before. 
I own a very cheap Panasonic stereo now...

One of the traits of Porsche owners being an impatience to get from point
A to point B, I find that about the third week I start dipping into the
store of bottles in my closet.  Probably means I should stagger or
'double-batch' as you put it.  I guess staggering is an apt choice of

     To all the resto guys out there, has anybody used a product sold by

I have a question concerning a chassis plate on my '71 911E. 

This car, according to its US emmisions certification sticker, was
manufactured in July of 1970. It is titled as a 1971 vehicle and has a
Porsche N.A. cardex history.

On the drivers side front door frame is a small aluminum plate that states:


Made in Western Germany

Kunstharzlack

1411-L


Are these plates common on C chassis 911s? Is Kunstharzlack a
manufacturing site or the name of a company? Any idea what the 1414-L
means? Was this body made by a third party?

Minor Dissertation on How Shops Work, Part 1:

When you take your car to the shop, your bill comes in four
parts: labor, parts, shop materials, and tax.

Labor: for "routine" jobs, you're typically charged the shop hourly
rate times the "flat rate manual" hours for that job. Sometimes you
win, if you have a particularly difficult car (i.e. parts rusted
frozen, etc.), sometimes the shop wins if the tech can do the work 
faster than the manual says. For "wierd stuff" and debugging type
things (like chasing wiring problems in a  356 for instance), you're
charged by the hour of real time.

Parts: you're typically charged the "suggested retail" from the *supplier*
that the shop uses. The shop typically gets 10-25% off as a shop, with the
expectation that they'll make some money on selling the parts to you. In
reality, the 10-25% *just about* covers the costs of keeping  and
managing inventory, shipping costs, and the costs of ordering (either
paying for a parts person or taking time off of "other jobs" in a one
man shop). This is not a profit center in most shops!

Shop materials: in the Old Days, this never ever showed up on a bill -- this
was part of the overhead of the shop. It's still part of the overhead,
but in an effort to hold shop hourly rates down, some shops started charging
directly for "materials" -- hand cleaner, parts washer solvent, etc -- 
on a small-percentage-of-net-cost basis.

Tax: you know all about this...

Anyway, the shop is paying the tech something per hour or per job but less
than the shop hourly rate for sure, is paying less for the parts that it's 
selling them for, and may be recovering some money from materials charges.
So, in theory, for every job they bring in more money than it costs them
in "direct costs". AH hah!!! Yoy say... Profit!!!!

Not so fast.... out of this "profit", they have to cover the rent, utitlies, 
the admin overhead (accounting, taxes, front office costs), buy new tools,
pay up front for inventory they may resell later (maybe a *LOT* later),
and "eat" mistakes and other rework. They also have to pay for advertising,
for other cost-of-sales items like those little promotional keychains and
stuff. They must cover their portion of payroll taxes, and pay the hidden
taxes like state and federal unemployment tax, workmans's comp, insurance,
and other things. On top of this all, they have to pay environmental
fees and use taxes, they typically pay tax on the total value of the 
business (the tools, inventory, etc) as well as income taxes on the
business income.

Then they *MAY* have a profit. Most likely they have a  huge pile of paper
and the owner is left sitting with his head in his hands going "Plumber....
I should have been a plumber...."

To add to their grief and agony, they have "good customers" coming by
asking for discounts off the shop rate, "deals" on parts, or to really
add insult to injury, customers that want to supply their own parts.
That's a bigger problem  than it sounds like, because in addition to the
fact that the shop is now losing money on this job, there's a VERY good
chance that the parts will either be wrong (because they were misordered
or mis-shipped) or that there will be additional parts needed that will
either piss off the customer ("well, I could have gotten them for you")
or cause delays, taking up space in the shop with a car that's unnecessarily
waiting on parts.

The exception to this is if the shop either asks you to provide the
part, or says "well, I'll install it if you bring it in." By the way,
that latter phrase is a *CLEAR* clue that maybe you're asking them to
do something stupid.... Just an FYI, you know?

Bottom line: "good customers" don't bring their own parts. They don't
ask for discounts. If they like the service, they send other people to the
shop. If they're smart, they make sure the shop owner knows about it. 
If *HE'S* smart, he then "takes care of you" by doing small things at
not charge or passing on discounts that he can or doing other things to
retain your trust and keep you coming back and sending more customers to
him. In return for this, you can expect to get the work done on your car
the way you want it done, to have it done right and in a timely manner,
and to get answers for any questions you may have. 

If you don't get what you're expecting, you will probably find another
shop. If you don't behave like the shop owner needs you to, he probably
won't ask you to go elsewhere. Just another inequality to think about.

Subject: Re: ca smog checks

     This  past spring the Cal. smog test cutoff was '65/'66  for
everything.    Think  of  it  this  way.   356's  don't   require
inspection  of any kind (a pleasant surprise when registering the
new  '65  SC),  911's  do.   These  cutoff  dates  have   changed
occasionally.  I once was required to have a '63 Falcon inspected
for an aftermarket PCV device.  That would no longer be required.

     I've  also  found  the  inspectors  getting  stickier  about
operation  of  the various devices.  I've a '78 Jeep,  which  has
always passed the sniffer test (had it for 10 years).  This year,
I  was  forced to replace a non-functional EGR.  This EGR  hasn't
worked  for  10  years.  In the past, they  mentioned  it  was'nt
working,  but gave me the certificate because the emissions  were
OK.   This  year  I  went to three places, all of  who  spent  20
minutes  or  so  checking things, verifying  the  emissions  were
within  spec.,  then  refused  the certificate  (and  my  $12.95)
because  the EGR wasn't working.  Finally, I bought another,  got
the  certificate,  and  re- installed the old  one  (because  the
driveability with the new one was terrrible).

     The  moral  here  is that things continue to  change.   Smog
compliance is a moving target.

Consider using a standard oil pressure sender, and wiring it into your
oil pressure gauge.  Then you can check fuel pressure on the road, watch
the warmup regulator operate... oops, you're Motronic.  Not sure how
useful this will be to you; is system pressure as informative as it is
with CIS?

On my '83 I got a duplicate oil pressure sender (it's a generic VDO
part) and a brass adapter tee and mounted the sender in the fuel line at
the warmup pressure regulator.  Then I ran the wire up to the dash (the
only messy part of the job... run several wires while you're at it),
and ran it and the original oil pressure wire thru a selector switch and
thence to the oil pressure gauge.  For CIS troubleshooting this is handy
as you can check things out on the road without hassle, and anytime
anything "funny" happens.  Warmup, leakdown, full throttle... all show
up in fuel pressure readings.

Let me know if you're interested, I can look up the part numbers and
other details.

HELP!  I need a set of exhaust manifolds for a 944 Turbo.  They MUST be the
newer design with the bellows in the heat shields.  Mine are the older type
and have cracked.  They have been repaired several times but they continue to
fail.  This may have to do with the fact that this car is only driven on
weekends in scenic places like Watkins Glen, Pocono, Lime Rock, etc.  I'd
like to do a couple of additional weekend tours this season, so time is of
the essence.

I am amazing by this bulliten board.  I wish I would have had this resource
when I owned my last Porsche several years ago.  Thanks to all who wrote in
regarding 944 servicing.

A new question for you all.  Several of you said that the 944 is not a
complex car to work on.  What is the best source for me to begin learning how
to fix the car myself, especialy learning to diagnos a problem correctly?
 Are there any books specificually related for  non-mechanic people (ie, not
written in complex technical jargon)  self-servicing the 944 S?  Thanks.

I personally like the look of the SWB cars ('66-'68). Sure, some of the parts
are more expensive, but they've got a look about them...maybe it's an
acquired taste. If you want to add flares or do the '73 RS thing you should
definitely buy a '69 (with a SWB you could make it look like the unbelievably
cool 911R). If you want a car that just screams '60's buy a SWB.

Subject: Purchasing a 928, what to watch for?

A  few thoughts after 2 years of '86 928 ownership (in So Cal.):

The years mentioned (84-87) cover what is arguably the most important transition
in the 928's life: the change with the '85 model to the 4-cam engine.  This is
an important issue because with the 4-cam engine (on the plus side) you get a
whole bunch more power (like well over 50 hp), while on the minus side, due to
piston/valve clearance issues, a broken timing belt's could cost you $4,000+.
This makes timing belt maintenance a Very Big Deal.  As I understand it, the
2-cam US models will simply quit running and your out one belt.  I believe that
Euro 2-cam models will eat valves under these circumstances as well, but at
least there are half as many to replace.

The '87 model ("S4") is in a way the "culturally" more important transition,
since it has a (I think undeserved) reputation for being the year of most
significant improvements in the car.  It is the first year of the only
significant restyling the car got, along with an improved induction system
(which by the way makes the engine *much* easier to work on), electric rather
than belt-drive fan (another work reducer), improved aerodynamics (who cares?),
a better clutch, but not much else that I recall.  I think a good '87 can be had
for very low twenties, where an '85 or '86 should go for about $15-17K.  If I
had it to do over again, I would hold out for an '87, mostly because of the
engine-maintenance issue and the clutch.  I'm lucky enough to have a 5-speed
which I would recommend just because it's more fun, but they are hard to find
representing 20% or less of the US population.

Bruce Anderson's series on purchasing used Porsches in "Excellence" magazine are
must reading here.

My main caution to the prospective owner is go in with your eyes open regarding
parts cost and maintenance requirements. There are many, many 4-digit priced
parts in the car, and they are all packed into the car very tightly, making what
on other cars would be simple operations very time-consuming (John's reference
to the clutch master cylinder being an example).  So, thorough pre-purchase
inspection is absolutely critical here, and availability of a complete
maintenance record is even more desirable than usual.

On the other hand, when it's running right, it's the epitome of effortless and
composed high-speed travel over any paved terrain.  And there's no sensation
quite like the muted bellow the 4-cam V-8 makes in a head-long rush for the
horizon.

lot of mileage on the car, it just isn't cost-effective to buy the
necessary Porsche tools sometimes. For example, on the advice given on
this list, I ordered a Pirelli cam belt from Automotion for $17 US. My
total cost is (parts+shipping)*1.3=$29 cdn + duty $1 + tax $2 + Customs
handling fee $5 = $37 cdn. The dealer charges $74 cdn for this and its not
even Pirelli. Dealer price for balance belt: $192 (Ack!). 
 
Now the belt tensioning tool..The cheapest I've seen is $360 US = $490 
cdn + $18 duty +  $36 tax + $5 customs = $550 cdn not inclu. shipping!
 
The dealer charges $80/hr and quoted a 2 hr job for the belts which works 
out to about 3 to 4 belt changes to break even or 21 yrs given what I 
drive in a year.

I checked and my dealer has no problem with me supplying my own parts. 
The only caveat is they would not warranty the belt (big deal). At least 
the job will be done correctly (I hope). In the past, I've successfully 
replaced the head on my BMW, but on my 944 for certain jobs, I'd just as 
well have the dealer do it, if not for peace of mind.

Subject: 928 Alarm keyswitch problem


In John White's response to "Purchasing a 928, what to watch for?" he mentions
having a problem with one door's alarm keyswitch.  I was just wondering if your
problem resembled my problem.  Namely, every once in a while (like once a
month), under a very specific usage pattern, the alarm will go off when I unlock
and open the driver's door.  The particular usage pattern is that I start the
car from cold in the morning, drive it somewhere for lunch, leave it parked
*uncovered* (it's black, BTW) in the sun (normally it's under a car cover when
parked out doors) for about an hour, and then unlock it.  All I can surmise from
this is that either the alarm "brain" is nuts, or the driver-side alarm switch
closure that is supposed to disarm the alarm brain never arrives, but only under
this particular temparature-over-time profile.

I'd appreciate any hints anyone might have.  My next move will probably be to
swap the alarm brain ($125 new), but I really hate black-magic debugging like
that.  Especially when I have to wait an unkowable amount of time to determine
if I fixed it!

I guess I could attack the "intermittent alarm switch" theory by wiring up a
buzzer or light to go if it is ever the case that the "unlock door" signal is
present when the "disarm alarm" signal is not.  At least then I'd know if it's
the brain's fault.

Thanks,

Alan Watkins.

Subject: passing emissions - a couple more ideas



In addition to Mike's list, here are a couple of other
things I found to help:

    Clean or preferably replace the spark plugs the
    night before you test.

    Pick a warm day, and make sure your car is FULLY
    warmed up when you test (at least 180 degrees)

    On MFI cars, the hose from the left heat exchanger
    to the warm-up regulator must be connected and in
    good condition.

    Pick a time of day when you don't have to wait in
    line if possible.

    Be curteous and polite, so that if you're borderline
    they'll give you a break. - Remember, they will start
    out assuming you're a jerk unless you prove them wrong.
    (also applies to police)

Using the above guidelines and some of Mike's before I 
rebuilt my engine, I sailed through emissions checks 4
years in a row. (the first year I went in with stone guards
over my non-compliant H4's, track-type near slicks and an
attitude) I reeducated myself after getting tired of 
retesting that first year.

Generally, an engine always has pistons but a motor

But, drivers that race in circles always have *motors* -

saying that?   I seriously think that our cars have an extremely unfavorable

I was driving on the 80-90 toll road in Ohio today and the buddy who was with

pull over if everyone were breaking the law.  He stated, quite bluntly, that
I would surely be pulled over first, because a car like mine would obviously

Subject: 944 Pwr Steering Groans When Cold...

A small question re. the power steering on my '84 944:


When the weather starts to get colder out (like below 50, the way it is
here in Wisconsin), the power steering groans when the car is cold. It only
groans when I turn the wheels and the car is moving slowly or is at rest.
As soon as the car gets even *slightly* warmed up, the groans go away.
There is the proper amount of fluid in the pwr steering reservoir (as a
matter of fact, the system has lost almost no fluid in the last year ...)

So hey, any new wisdom on this would be welcomed. The car has been like
this for some time (it did it last winter - yes I do drive my 944 in the
snow, 'cause it's the *only* car I own), but this only happens during the
colder months. Is there a problem here, or is this normal for the power
steering to groan when it's cold out and the car is still cold ...

Thanks in advance ...

Hi guy's,
 I'm going to be replacing the clutch in my '86 Carrera 
and want to know what people think of purchasing the
clutch myself and having a garage do the work.
 I spoke to one shop that was willing to do the work under
this arrangement and my old (Porsche) mechanic
was quite happy to do this sort of thing.
 Normally I wouldn't bother to save a few bucks but the
difference between a mail-order clutch [<$350] and the 
"shop" price [$600] I'd rather blow the $250 difference
on stuff like food and my mortgage. :-)
  Basically, I want to know if my normal shop is likely
to take umbrage at the suggestion.  I don't want to
take my business elsewhere but I'd rather have another 
place do the work than risk spoiling my relationship
with the place that will be doing my work in the future.
  Ideas ? 
                               Chris

P.S. Give me some credit - I don't intend to just show up
       with the parts.

I read this and I chocked it up to Stan not coming out to too many LSR
events of late, what with a move to/from New Jersey and all.  However I do
have to comment 'cause I think there are some folks that are working hard on
the LSR AX's as well as the High Speed Driver's Ed events (self included)
that this does a disservice to.  The crowd at both these LSR series has
changed in the last year and I think both groups are trying to steer clear
of the politics that were going on at the top (of the region).  I too moved
my membership back to my former region (Golden Gate) during the height of
the crap that was flying around in LSR.  I think that most of that has
stopped now and we decided to dual-member with LSR earlier this year.

I think the current LSR events are better than Stan remembers them from a
couple of years ago.  Both series are focused more on driver education and
the Autocross group is planning several AX schools next year.  I'd encourage
any Porsche owner in the Houston area to come out to our events -- we have
fun and we're fortunate to have some nationally top-rated solo drivers as
instructors at our AX events.

As far as the Beemer drivers being "soooo slow", we've got a few drivers
from the local BMWCCA that show up regularly, Stan, that are pretty good.
 Too bad you sold your "autocross weapon" or you could come out and show us
what you learned in New Jersey (big smile here)....

       idle                red line
              ENGINE RPM

On flat road every CAR has a speed-power curve that **LOOKS LIKE** the top
figure (one line only, the ordinate is Car Power, the abscissae is car speed). 
The higher the car speed the higher the power needed.  The car speed is
proportional to wheel speed (neglecting tire-diameter increase due to
centrifugal forces). Between wheel speed and engine speed a 911  has 5 gears
and a 993 has 6 gears. At all times:

(Engine Power) = (Engine Torque) * (Engine rpm) * (a constant, 2*pi/60.)
(Car Power)    = (Engine Power) - (Friction in gears, differential etc)

and neglecting friction (Car=engine power)
(Car Power)    = (Engine Torque) * (Engine rpm) * (C,a gear-dependent constant)

The second figure is also on flat road, and the curves would move upwards (more
power needed) to climb hills. In 1st gear one moves on the lowest line above,
and in top gear on the highest (only three gears on flat road are shown in the
figure). Of course in all shifts except from neutral to 1st  one doesn't go all
the way down in rpm, one jumps to  the higher line somewhere half way its
length. Let's go through 2 shifts:

1st gear, idle to 6,000 rpm: from low to moderate power, 
                             lowest value of the constant C, highest torque 
                             (to get you moving).
2nd gear, 3,000 to 6,000 rpm: from moderate to middle power, 
                              with a bit higher value of C than in 1st,
                              a bit lower torque.
3rd gear, 3,000 to 6,000 rpm: from middle power to higher power,
                              a bit higher value of C than in 2nd,
                              a bit lower torque.

The engine figure (2nd figure) shown above has superimposed islands of constant
efficiency  (or it's inverse, fuel consumption). It is critical to observe the
three (main) limiting lines shown in the second curve: (a) the bearing load
limit (the shafts need to MOVE to support loads at the bearings); the turbo
matching limit (that's to match engine air flow with air flow through the
turbine to power the compressor of the turbo); and the maximum bmep limit
explained below.  The location of lines in the above figure is APPROXIMATE. It
is critical to accept that at each rpm  the engine curve above has upper and
lower limits within which the engine will operate happily. At
low-power/high-speed  combinations marine engines tend to form sludge (I don't
know what 911 or 951 engines do, I don't normally rev the engine to max rpm in
neutral!).  Let's go up the 3,000 rpm line. Low power, but some power ok. Up a
hill, higher power, still ok. Steeper hill, max power at 3,000 rpm, engine
wants to stall, approaches bmep (Break mean effective pressure) limit. Break
means dynamometer brake, but it also means highest pressures in combustion
chambers etc. You increase engine power, you increase bmep, and eventually you
need "race" gaskets. Anyway, you eventually stall the engine as you are
straining to blow the gaskets, which are designed for max bmep.

This max bmep limit runs along the top of the second figure, slightly curving
upwards with increasing rpm. 

Now it is time to study the engine power and  gear-shift curves shown at
the back of the owner's manual. Note that at the back of the owner's manual you
get one line of engine power  versus engine speed, presumably from a dyno test,
near max bmep (Peter Albrecht,  can you confirm what's published in the
manual?)

When you insist in staying at a high gear in low rpm you operate the engine
near the bearing load limit, and as Jim Pasha has already said, you will need
to rebuild the bearings soon. It damages the engine unnecessarily, so please
don't do it.

My car doesn't have it either. This may sound stupid, but was their a
regulation
stating that horns had to be placed on the driver's side of the car? That way
if somebody brought the car to a country where they drive on the otherside of
the  road there would be no problem in changing the horn from the left to the
right side. But that is probably (certainly) wrong.

Did you install 1 or 2 horns? I have two horns and they are both attached to
the battery box. One is facing forward and just fits behind the S spoiler and
the other one is facing down and is about 6 inches from the front tire. If
you only installed one horn that would explain the set of extra connectors.
If you have any other questions just E-mail me and I'll take a closer look.

Anyone out there had any experience "tuning" the ignition advance
on early 911's?  Mine's a '72.  The factory advance curve seems to
be rather slow, which I think was characteristic of the early
'70s cars when emission control laws first appeared.  The slow
advance helped, but it didn't do much for performance.
I haven't seen anything on P-philes on the subject, and have
looked through some of the archives to no avail.

Putting in softer mechanical advance springs (or removing the 'stiff'
one in distributors that have two kinds) is pretty straightforward.

Any comments?

Neil, I have this same problem/feature in my '75 914.  I believe it is 
due to the turn signal relay.  Does your turn signal indicator on the 
dash glow all the time????  I looked at a schematic and the wireing of 
the circuit is less than intuitive, so I opened up the relay, and there 
is a circuit card with multiple active devices!!!!  I could not determine 
the purpose of the complex electronics for a turn signal.  I made the 
assumption "that which I cannot understand or figure out must be the 
problem."  Since this is a low budget car, I pulled the warning light 
back out and put the dash back together, and I watch the turn signal 
indicator glow.
This may sound dangerous to not have a brake warning light, but according 
to the schematic for the '75, the "warning light" only tells you if the 
parking brake is on.  Besides, when you drive a 914 you always drive 
without brakes :-)!!!

If there are any difinitive answers to this, I would be interested in 
knowing.

  I had this problem on my 74' and the cause was a bad brake pressure switch
the one on the master cylinder.  I took it out and cleaned it and the problem
went away.. (It was full of junk).  So disconnect that switch and see if the
blinking stops..

This could also be caused by the wires being improperly connected to the
master cylinder.  If they are on backwards, then it will blink ALL the time,
I wonder if it goes out when the brakes fail???  Hmmm...

Anyway, I found out by experience.   Try reversing the wires and see what 
happens.

Subject: 944/968/928 Timing Belt Idlers


There has been a thread going on for sometime about the other components of 
the 944/968/928 engine families. 

This is about the idlers bearings. The idlers are primarially set in locations 
to provide support and change direction of the belts. The main timing belt has 
two for the 944/968 family. The first is the main belt adjuster, the second is 
the small backside idler which has a static position. Both can have bearing 
wear, this is the priciple mode of failure. Lubricant can get old, dirt get 
in, metal fatigues; there are many reasons for failure. When you have the 
belt out for renewal, most of the idlers will need to be removed. Any 
impending failure due to the sealed bearing going away can be found now by a 
simple test.

Take the idler and slowly rotate the pulley. If you feel any clicking or 
roughness or hear any grinding, toss it and replace. Simple as that. Or spend
about $200 and replace as a matter of course. Most of the cars that I see that have have 200,000 + miles (300,000km) still have the originals. I think the 
thing is inspection each time the belts are  serviced.  

One thing, there are some toothed gears on both belts, if these develop pits
on the driven surfaces, replace them. This indicates some foreign matter got
in and over time eroded material from the gear. In the event a balance shaft 
or front crankshaft seal sprays the belt housing and components, a thorough
checkout of all components, especially the 1987 and later self-adjustment
systems is required. The 968 has an oil actuated adjuster that has the 
potential of leaking, so check that part out also.

I don't have a real solution to the tensioner tool. It measures the stress 
on the belt fibers. This is more accurate, but it requires a special device
to measure the tension. If a 1987 or later tensioner is operating correctly, 
there should be very little to check, other than the balance shaft belt.

The main accessory drive belt also requires a tension gauge for its adjustment.

Porsche recommends the belt change at 45,000 miles (72,000km), earlier at the
mechanic's discretion. Much of the folklore is reflected by the willingness
of mechanics to "guide" their customers into things that line their pockets.
To any mechanics that read this, sorry, but I have been on both sides. I know
quite a few shops in the Bay Area that like to "advise" customers to get rid 
of a car because the mecahnic can no longer keep the car in good running 
order in the low maintenace mode. They have to really work at tuning up a car.
Performing service on a newer than 7 year old Porsche is really no more time
consuming than any American car, 911 valve adjustemnt included. Many easy, but
profitable service items are pushed, the 944 belt being one. My observation,
over ten + years, is that many of these shops didn't like the 944 family 
because the usual "gravy" wasn't there. Even the water pump "problem" was 
less in labor than a late 930 valve adjustment. In fact, if you add up the 
total labor to do the water pump, adjust the belts, change the motor mounts 
and do the clutch, it is less than 14 hours. At the local $72/hr rate, 
that's $1,008 for labor, probably another $1,100 in parts at the prevailing
best price. So the shop sees a potential of about $2,500 in a car for the 
first 125,000 miles. This is not going to keep them in business. The average 
911 owner will spend twice to three times that amount in the same period, I'll
except the 1986 and later Carreras as they are very good on service.

I will repeat a fact that few mechanics can refute, more damage to Porsche 
engines (and drivetrains) has occured because of mechanics that know little 
about what they are doing. Many of these jerks work at dealerships and are 
protected by their Union. Quite a few competent independant shops have to
tell a customer that another mechanic did something improperly and it finally 
caused a failure. What PCNA and Porsche AG fail to comprehend is that people
become irate and sell the cars after learning and seeing what the dealer did.
Many never consider another Porsche. The result is that the mechanic, in this 
case, does a repair as necessary and the car is sold. The new owner gets 
pissed when the poor repair fails and bitches on P-files (just an example).
And so on. 

Anyway, check or have checked all the belt pulleys at the inspection (or
replacement) interval.

I think the best thing to do in this situation is to talk to the 
shop in question and tell them what you want to do.  It sounds
like you're not in a habit of doing this, and they should sympathize
with the difference in parts costs.  It seems like the shop would

Well, I probably SHOULD come out for an event to three, but I just can't get

If you develop a good relationship with _one_ shop (see Stan's
earlier posting) usually they will work with you to save money.

Any reputable mechanic would be wary of installing parts of 
unknown origin because it's _his_ butt and reputation on the
line. Even in the best of circumstances parts can fail - then
where do you place the blame? If a part like a clutch fails, it
means a day of non-profit labor to fix it when it may not even

My favorite mechanic - Gene Kirchner at Autohaus - (shameless
plug here) will tell me to find my best price on a part, and he'll
either match it or install what I found if it's of acceptable
quality. That's nice, and he has my continued loyalty as my thanks.

Subject:  944 Pwr Steering Groans When Cold...

Trev,
Have the same problem with 87 924S (96K miles).  Problem is a seal that
shrinks in cold weather allowing air into the fluid causing cavitation and
groan---so I've been told. When fluid warms seal expands, etc. Could also be
that clamp at base of reservoir is not working correctly as is often the
case.  I think it is Kevin Gross who perodically says to replace clamp with a
regular hose clamp. If it's the seal causing problems you used to be able to
get one in a power steering rebuild kit, tho that no longer seems to be the
case.  Ivan, the rooftop mechanic claims, that he replaced seal with a Mazda
seal.I guess one could learn to live with it, but in very cold weather it
seems to last interminably, and I can't believe it's not damaging something
or other.
Hope this helps.

Subject:  914 Brakes:  60 - 0 stopping distances

At the suggestion of p-philer Mark Skala, I ran some 60 - 0 MPH stopping distance tests with my 914 this
weekend.  Test conditions were cloudy, 45 degrees, dry asphalt pavement (if it matters).

(Test run not measured)
Run #1 - 135 feet  (some tire lockup)
Run #2 - 137 feet  (some tire lockup)
Run #3 - 122 feet  (no lockup)
Run #4 - 121 feet  (no lockup)
Run #5 - 123 feet  (very light lockup)

These results are actually better than I thought they would be.  Perhaps the high pedal effort leads me to
believe that the brakes aren't as effective as they are.  If my memory isn't too fuzzy, isn't the 60 - 0
stopping distance for an average sedan around 120 feet?  Does anyone have information on the stopping
distances for various Porsche models?  I recall watching a mid-80's Motorweek show in which a Corvette
had a stopping distance of 98 feet.  Not that I expect a stock 914 to match a Corvette...

Thanks,
Pete Klager

Hi, Pete.
 
How did you measure the starting and stopping points? Human reflexes aren't
good enough to judge exactly where to hit the pedal. Your 12 ft. difference
in distances amounts to only 0.14 sec. difference at 60 mph (88 ft/sec.)
That's about the order of magnitude of human reaction times for an expected
braking operation. Human eye-hand-foot coordination will give you more
scatter in the data than that already inherent in your braking system.
 
Distance will depend strongly on road surface. I test on a drag strip, and
pavement differences are enough to make a stop take forever if I hit the
wrong spot. The rubber laid down by dragsters is greasy under braking. I
have a certain "sweet spot" I use, about 300 ft. long. And it's been getting
smaller as they repave the strip over the years. But I think the record from
60 with my equipment is held by a 911 Turbo at about 113 ft. Anything below
120 ft. is phenomenal, and requires really high quality tires and brake
system engineering.

Subject: Speed shifting and drag racing

 
Hi, Clark.
 
I just happened across a Top Alcohol car sponsored by the Fluke (test
equipment) people at the local Fry's Electronics. I put the team to The
Question (manual or automatic) and what they call an automatic is different
from what you and I would call an automatic. No torque converter, a
conventional clutch is still used on the initial launch, but from then on
the driver has to manually punch up each gear shift (but does not have to
work a clutch). They use a planetary gearbox with three gearsets. (Actually,
it may be closer to a Sportomatic...)
 
Other interesting stuff -- the engines are even more like Porsches than
Porsches themselves; they have NO COOLING SYSTEM. No water jacket passages.
Not even a fan. It's not a drag race, it's a race against meltdown. Of
course, the alhohol fuel itself is the coolant.
 
Now this one I find hard to believe, and I'm too lazy to get my textbooks
out, but I'm told that nitromethane (the fuel for Top Fuel) apparently
contains so much of its own oxygen that it will burn just fine without
outside air. Basically, one of those rocket fuels that doesn't require a
separate oxidizer (that type of fuel has a name, I forgot it). I find that
hard to believe, as Top Fuel cars still suck in lots of air judging by the
inlet hardware that's visible on top of the things. But maybe some of the
chemists on the list can comment to this off the top of their heads.
 
(Later) Yup, sure enough, I looked it up and PURE nitromethane (dragsters blend
it though, don't run it pure) is a monopropellant (there, that's the word),
and a darn good one too. Specific impulse 210, compared to only 175 for
hydrazine or hydrogen peroxide, traditional rocket fuels. Density impulse is
not so great though, you would need a bulkier rocket to do the same job as
other fuels.
 
(This begs the question, why bother running nitromethane through something as
inherently inefficient as a piston engine, when you could be using it as
reaction mass for a rocket car? Answer: advertising. Detroit isn't selling
road rockets yet, and the fans might find the rocket cars and other forms of
weenie roasters interesting but not part of real racing.)
 
If this is true though, it means racing on the moon will be possible. This
will require (Yuppie Buzzword Alert!!!) a pardigm shift, because there will
be no need for aerodynamic devices, for one thing. You can make a Lunar Top
Fuel car as ugly as you want, it won't matter. You won't have Urropeen
tippy-toe drivers in the Formula Luna series bitching about the other guys'
cheater ground effects.

To get enough speed to make Formula Luna interesting, it will have to be run on a
very high-banked oval, so you can generate some downforce. Then, since the
excape velocity is pretty low, going off the track could result in the car
going into lunar orbit!

Gee Peter, you knew very little about drag racing. It is not a buch of low
tech good ol' boys running the quarter mile. The level of technology is
pretty high and the performances have to be seen to be believed. If you
think that Porsche is the paragon of technology, you have a great deal to
learn. As an ex drag racer and the owner of three Porsches, I don't really
think Porsche is the only source of innovation. The drag racers do a great
deal of testing and innovation on budgets that would not cover the pit crew
for a F1 team.

Second, both rear tires have a significant amount of camber.  At first I 
thought my car was falling apart, but yesterday I saw a car that WAS 
falling apart, and the camber was not that bad.  That unmentionable car 
parts "store" in Atlanta said it could just be missing shims.  Are there 
any other reasonable explanations?  Maybe bushings???  The trailing arm

but needs some help.  (The car I saw the other day was missing the

	Rear camber is set with shims under the outside mount of the swing
arm. Large negative camber is difficult. I had to modify the inner mount
to get -2.5 deg ! If you have large negative camber, something must be
wrong with either the rear console or with the swing arm/bushing.  Factory
bushings seem to be availiable only with the purcha$e of the swing arm. The only
replacement bushings I know of for the 914 swing arm are from Weltmeister
and are plastic so they will have to be dissassembled about once a year to
be re-lubed (If you use the right lube) or the sound will drive you crazy.
If you use the wrong lube, they will allways be noisy no matter how often you
lube them.

Hello, this is my first posting, so please bear with me.

I have a '79 924 with over a 100,000 miles.  I was wondering
if anyone had an idea how long the fuel injectors last from that
era.  I just purchased the car last spring, and am wondering 
approx. how long the injectors will last, and if there are any
warning signs as to when they are going bad.

I am curious about this since after talking with the local 
mechanic and talking about performance he suggested putting
a carb kit on it (after looking around he was able to find 
a company that made them for between $600-700).
>From his experience this really helps the 924 engine breathing
problem.  I know I will never be able to get MASSIVE amounts
of torque or hp out of it, but I would like some improvement.
Has anyone out there ever done this or know someone who has?
How much did it help?

Don,
Could be sagging rear springs.  I just replaced mine this summer for the same reason.
The 914 rear suspension geometry is set up such that as the wheel moves upward, it also tips inward.
So as the springs sag, the camber increases.

Hope this helps,

Subject: Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles


The dealer could not solve this problem the first time around, hopefully 
someone on the net can share some wisdom or recall a similar experience to 
mine.

Two weeks ago my '84 928S (93,000 miles) stalled while driving down the 
interstate (at highway speed) , but only for a minute.  It restarted before 
I coasted to a stop and I made it to work, another 40 miles, without further 
incident.

On the way home it died after approx.. 10 miles.  After trying to start it 
every 5-10 minutes for an hour, it started right up like normal and went 
another 10 miles before stalling out again.  I had it towed to Ray Catena 
Porsche in Edison, NJ where they diagnosed low fuel pressure as the problem. 
 They installed a new fuel pump, fuel filter and fuel pump relay for $688.

I picked it up this morning and drove about 10 miles before it died again, 
same symptoms as before.  Seems the $688 fuel pump was not the answer to my 
problem.  As the tow truck approached 40 minutes after it died, I tried to 
start it and it kicked right over.  But I had it towed in anyway.  Stalling 
on a busy interstate is not the rush I was looking for when I bought this 
car!

Each time it bucks a bit before dying, similar to running out of gas.  When 
trying to restart, it runs rough for 5-10 seconds before dying.  I seem to 
have spark, compression and some gas.  Since it will run strong, for 10 
miles anyway, I think my compression is OK.

Could it be some electronic black box or sensor somewhere?  I want to make 
sure the dealer has checked all possibilities this time around.

Should I pay for the previous repair which now seems needless?  I used a 
Master Card to pay and can fight it that way if need be.

History:
======
Timing belt (installed at dealer) has under 1,000 miles on it.
Old fuel filter had only gone 6,000 miles when they replaced it.
Plugs, cap, rotor, air and air pump filter replaced 6,000 miles ago with 
fuel filter.
No previous problems, always ran strong and started right up.

TIA for all suggestions!

The top fuel and funny car people have been racing WIITHOUT gearboxes since 
about '88-'89 ish.  Those cars have a direct drive (through a clutch) but no
gears.  This was made possible by making a different size and MUCH stronger
ring and pinion set for the diff.  You never hear these guys talk about gear
boxes exploding or losing gears anymore; you always hear them talking about
dialing in the clutch.  This non-gearbox stuff was made initially by Gene Snow,
a Top Fuel guy and it was his secret to success for 2 seasons.  evenmtually,
the word got out and he told them of this special diff set-up.  They even
showed it in the pits on TNN one time (yes, TNN does have some great color guys
and good racing occasionally).  This guy is putting the engine in the dragster
and the other guy grabs the transmission, holds it up to the camera and turns it
around so you can see through the gearbox.  No gears, selecctors, bands.
Nothing.  Gene went on to the finals, but I can't remember how he did.  I
believe this also has to do with the et's dropping and the speeds increasing.

Hi Bill,

I've had a similar problem with my 944.
Fortunately, the dealer was honest enough to 
admit he did not know the source of the problem.

I realized that it was an electronic problem
(as opposed to mechanical) given the nature of the 
symptoms. The bottom line is that the source of the 
problem is a relay that controls fuel injection 
called the "DME".

This sounds EXACTLY like the problem I had with my Dodge Daytona.  It turned
out to be the fuel pressure regulator which was located on the end of the fuel 
pump submerged in the gas tank.  I'm not sure where it is on the 928, but if
you find it let me know; it might happen to me.

   Had a friend with the same problem turn out to be a bad gas line, It had 
a kink that would close after about 10 miles.  He finally put a pressure 
guage on the line and you could watch it drop to 0 when the car would die
and after a few minutes it would return to normal.  So a extensive trace of
all the fuel lines let to the kink.. Replaced it and all was well. But this
car was not FI.

Well...
There was a skid mark laid down perpendicular to the traffic lane which I
used as a starting point.  I went down the road aways and headed towards the start
at 60 mph.  About a second before reaching the starting point, I pushed in the clutch
and moved my right foot to the brake pedal.  I tried to anticipate when my front wheels
crossed over the starting mark and hit the brakes just as they did so.  Hopefully, this
eliminated (or at least reduced the effects of) my reaction time from the test.
After the car came to a stop, I got out and marked a line in the gravel shoulder parallel
to the front axle.  I did this five times.  Then I measured the distance from the start
point to each end point.  I ran the test five times for several reasons:
  - to search out the point of maximum braking without skidding.
  - to average out the differences between the starting point and where I actually hit the brakes
    assuming sometimes I was early and sometimes I was late hitting the brakes.
  - to average out the effects of the brakes heating up and gripping better -or- heating up and fading.

Certainly, there will be inaccuracies in the test due to reaction times and speedometer error.
I ran these tests to determine if my car's brakes were operating as well as they should be, rather
than relying on a "seat of the pants" feeling.  If I had gotten distances in the range of, say, 160 - 170
feet, I would have had good evidence that my brakes are as bad as the pedal makes them feel.
Now I know that even though I really have to stand on the pedal, I do get a reasonable stopping distance.

For those of us racing 914s, this adds another factor: rear bump steer.
If you have springs that are too soft, then under compression (usually
acceleration exiting a corner) you get a huge camber change, which also
brings with it a caster and toe change. Ooooops. Come see my "Mr. Conehead"

Almost any fuel injected car will run a LOT beter with new injectors
if the current injectors are more than a few years old. "A few" varies
some by type and application, but anything over 3 years old will just
about certainly give a performance boost if replaced.

Note that this does not answer the "when will it die" question. With

as you may have heard, my new rear tires (275/40 on 10x17) rub under
compression. They hit on the inside front. will stiffer springs (i.e.
torsion bars) alone solve the problem? Stiffer rear springs will tend to
induce more oversteer? I figured that the current suspension (andial sway
bars and factory sport suspension) wasn't too soft: no bouncing or
bottoming any where on the track. ok, the body work rubs when I really hook
up exiting a few turns at the glen, but I'm told all 951s do that.

I assume I should also switch to stiffer front springs. I'd like to be able

I had a similar problem on my 924 but it was solved with the fuel pump

I also had the injectors replaced on my Vanagon, under a factory recall, 
because they apparently were not sealed properly, leading to bad electrical

which you mentioned.  Starting wasn't generally a problem though.

    The brake warning light blinks at you (it's supposed to

A good six is a thing of beauty, but it provides one of the toughest
choices in Porschedom: do you keep it stock and live with any number of

I tend to follow the "keep it stock" view, except when building a six
out of a stock 914-4. *THEN* you make it "right"... and then some!

Bone stock, a six has a ton more top-end than even a 2.0. However, the
torque is lower at the low RPM range, and it's not as good an autox
car. With some reasonable and inobtrusive modifications (like 2.4E
pistons/cylinders and a '68 S cam slightly advanced), it's a whole 'nuther
story....

> 1. What's a fair price for a 914-4 (2.0) and 914-6 in "good" condition, e.a.

Good 2.0s go from about $3500 to about $6000, depending on how lucky you get 
and how good the car is. Good 914-6s start at $9k and go up from there.
Usually, $14-15k will get a Very Good car, and $20k will get a 97 point
concour car. We're talking Real Prices here, not asking prices.

Any car with rust is too expensive. You'll need to take it apart to fix
the rust,and once you do that, you'll want to "do" everything -- which
is VERY expensive.

Ghost Racing does stock and modified 914-6 restorations for customers, 
since the principals own a total of 6 914-6s and have ample sources of
comparison for originality. The last one done for a customer was a
"street restoration" -- i.e. probably a high-80s concour car, but it was
just *GREAT* for the street. I think it cost the guy about $18k plus
his car, but it included an engine rebuild, full strip, fix rust, all
new original color paint, interior repairs, etc. Looked great, but not
a concours job by any means... To pick up those last 10 points or so,
you can roughly TRIPLE that cost...

> 2. What's the purpose of a side shifter modification ?

The original 'tail shifter' is about as precise as stirring a bucket of 
mud with a thin stick. The side shifter "cures" that. Sort of like
smoking cures lung cancer, in my opinion. It *DOES* help, but a shifter
spring upgrade kit and fresh hand-fitted shift bushings, plus new
motor and trans mounts, and some tranny work, will do about as good while
preserving the original setup.

> 3. Anyone with a 914-4/914-6 for sale ??

Yes. Two. Prices start at $15k. These are great street/track cars, 
have fresh engine rebuilds and mechanicals. If you're *SERIOUS*,
shoot me a note. If you want a great deal on a great car, this is
a good opportunity. If you want something cheaper, go bother someone

I had a similar experience years ago with a VW bug.  The little hole
that lets air back into the gas tank got plugged, so when the suction
in the tank went just above what the fuel pump could suck, the car died!

Subject: Re:  Help!  Car needs to rest 45 minutes after every 10 miles

This sounds pretty dumb, but one possibility might be that you're
developing a vacuum in the gas tank, due to a plugged vent. (I think
this was a Car Talk puzzler). Next time it happens, take off the gas
filler cap and see if you get a big whoosh from air rushing in. If so,
problem solved; if not, the shop that did the work certainly owes you
a loaner fuel injection control unit, to see if that cures the problem.
You could also figure out how to connect a pressure gauge to the
fuel rail test fitting; I thought the idea of using an oil pressure
sender, with an adapter for the fittings, connected via a two-position
switch to the oil pressure gauge was pretty cute, but maybe more
complex than you want for one-time troubleshooting. Your shop could
maybe connect a gauge so that the next time it happens you could leap
out, pop the hood, and check the pressure. The fuel pump doesn't run
if the engine isn't running, but the residual pressure should be 
pretty close to the roughly 2 bar expected during idle; that's
something you can check when the car is working, to compare with
when it's not. As always, let the list know the right answer, when
it's found.

A while back I bought 10 oil filters from Automotion during one of their

filters. Seeing as the box for OC75 said it was for a 911 Turbo I thought 
they had sent the wrong filter. Automotion assured me that the tall 
filter was indeed correct and the short one was being phased out. In fact 
they said some customers were specifically asking for the tall ones.
 
What's the true story behind this filter swap? Did Porsche really change 
the size of the filters used for 944's?
 
Logic would dictate that a bigger filter would be better for increased 
filtration. On the minus side is that it might increase the restriction 
on oil flow but this might be negligible given the pressures involved.
 
Which filter should I be using?

Thanks for the offer Ed, but as you mentioned, the Motronic FI system in my
Carrera does not vary fuel pressure in the way that a CIS system would. 
I really just need to check a couple of data points- pressure with the
engine running and pressure "bleed down" with the engine off. Your set up 
sounds like a great way to monitor a CIS system though.
 
Tom Oxner gave me a great (and now obvious tip) about fabricating a 
connection to the test connection on the fuel rail. Just take an old fuel
hose with fitting (like the one that connects to the fuel filter), cut it in
half and use some low tech hose clamps and non-metric fittings to mate it
to an inexpensive hardware variety pressure gauge.

also the 2.7 will need major work if it has not had it. you need

The 914 braking distances for stock sound really good. MAybe even too good
I opened up the R&T I have around to distract me from work and here are ome
of their braking results

braking 60-0 in ft

Volvo 850 sportswagon: 130
Alfa Romeo 164: 150
Chevey Camaro: 162

And thats enough data entry. So the 914 seems realy good when compared with
some of these modern "super-cars". I wonder what mine does 60-0 in with 911

I every one,
I went auto Xing for the first time. It was a blast I had a lot of off
course DNF's but hey its the first time. I went to a corvette club meet
with a friend (FLAMES OFF I JOIN PCA LAST WEEK). I couldn't believe cars as
big as that could turn that well. I ended up mid pack time wise with the
group that was there. This makes me think the 914 is a much better car for
this than vettes. It felt like if I could drive right the car would be a
lot faster than it was but I kept screwing up. oh well thats life at the
bottom of the learning curve. I cann't wait for spring!
914 heat questions:
1. the hot air from the engine fan and heater fan is not blowing out of the
right side heat exchanger. I can feel air leaking out of the exchange at
the join near the engine fan. I their something in here that could have
gotten stuck.A flapper of some kind maybe?
2. The heater fan was unplugged by a mechanic for some reason. When I plug
it back in it run all the time. Whats going on. It was working correctly
before it was unplugged. It even runs with the key out of the car. There is
a wire attached to the ground on the left side of the car. if I touch it to
one of the wires it turn the fan on or off. I imagine this wire has to be
reattached somewhere for it to work. The real question is where does it go?

Thanks for the help

Hello everyone-
I've been experiencing major difficulties gettingg through to this list, I
hope I'm not wasting my time again. My question is:How much does a stock
Porsche air filter cost compared to a K&N filter. Also, who can install it?
Will my very user unfriendly dealer tell me to go away? Should I try a
P-car specialist (i have 2 in my area).
My 'every 15,000 mile checkup' is approaching. This will be my first (I
have put 11k miles on my car since I bought it). Do you 944/924S owners out
there do this religiously? If so, how much $$ does it cost? I know I've
gotta do this or my car will give me hell in return, I'm curious what other

Subject: Why I won't use K&N Filters

*** WARNING , the follow is quite long....  

Why I Won't Use K&N Filters 

Before purchasing a K&N filter,I decided to take a careful and
common-sense approach to checking out K&N's claims. I was able to acquire
a K&N fact sheet and product literature on their filters. The more I read,
the more I had reservations about using their filter on my car.  

First, let me say that I believe that they WILL increase performance by
increasing air flow. The question is at what cost? The viewpoint I took in
my analysis was that I was to be using my car for street driving only and
not racing, auto-crossing, or off road driving (duh). Also, I was not
going to sacrifice engine longevity for a minimal increase in performance.
I disregarded the cost issue (i.e. as compared with paper filters) as I
seriously doubt people buy K&N filters to save money.  Anyways, here are
my concerns with K&N's claims. Let me know if I'm way off base in my
reasoning: 

K&N: "When K&N air filter is clean, the air flow and filtering
capabilities are very high, and remain so for an extraordinary period of
time. As the filter begins to collect debris on the outside, from the
atmosphere, an additional form of filtering action takes place. Because
there are no small holes to clog the filter itself, the large and small
particles adhering to the outside of the element, held by the oil, begin
to form a fitlering barrier."

 - This is my biggest concern and one which I'm surprised K&N is admitting
to. Basically, K&N is saying that when the filter is clean, you get lots
of air (and presumably dirt). As the dirt builds up, it serves to block
the dirt which was passing though when the filter was clean. Given their
claim that the air flow remains high for an 'extraordinary period of
time', imagine how much dirt makes it into the engine before the dirt
accumulates enough to become a filtering medium. On the other hand, paper
filters are designed to block out ALL dirt from the beginning. 

 - Also, no where in the literature does it state the minimum dirt particle
size which can pass through the filter. The emphasis of the text is
clearly on air-flow rather than engine protection. As such, there is no
quantitative measure of filtration throughout the documentation. 

K&N on the aluminum mesh in the filter: "The combination of square holes
in the screen and fabric create a grid-like effect which actually
straightens the air as it passes through. The air moving in a straight
direction moves faster than tumbling air creating an increase in air flow.
The principle of straightening air through a grid system is used by the
Aircraft industry in wind tunnel testing of aerodynamic shapes" 

 - Bogus. First, the filter is pleated so the air isn't going to hit the
mesh straight on. Second, the fact the the air usually has to travel
through a series of curves through the air-box, past the throttle plate
and into the intake manifold is going to cancel out any effect of
'straight air' from the filter. In terms of aerodynamics, scale makes all
the difference. This is why car manufacturers always like to perform
aerodynamic testing on life-size models. When using scaled down models,
other effects come into play which can influence test results. I'd be
hesitant to directly translate the results of aircraft testing to the
performance of an air filter. 

K&N: "...a filter that is cleaned too often might become damaged as well. 
A K&N Filtercharger can safely be washed up to 20-25 times. After this,
the filter should be replaced with a new one. Excessive washings of the
filter will tend to deplete the tiny cotton-hairs that criss-cross the
openings and grab the really small dust particles. If these tiny hairs are
damaged, the filter will gradually lose its ability to trap fine dust." 

 - You can bet the cotton starts to deteriorate after the first several
washings. And how can you really be sure when these 'tiny cotton-hairs'
are depleted? Ever notice how cotton towels are rough and their fibers
'stringy' after being washed. If you look closely, the cotton-hairs bunch
up and the towel never really feels as soft as it did when new. Why
wouldn't the same effect happen to a K&N? You could spray all the oil on
it you want and the fine hairs wouldn't 'stand up' again. 

K&N - Performance Hints: "Let the dirt "build-up" work for you; it will
not hurt the performance and actually helps filter the air. CAUTION: 
Extreme fine dust - agriculture or offroad use - will pull the oil from
the element. Frequent re-oiling of the element's clean side might be
required....For extra protection, use K&N sealing grease on rubber ends of
the element."  K&N: "Many K&N PANEL filters require a special touch to
install. Due to the firmness of the urethane we use, most filters should
be installed into lid first." 

 - Again, K&N admits it relies on dirt to filter dirt. Fine dust is
encountered in city driving too. You can guess where the dirt contaminated
oil gets pulled into. And what a mess this would make in the intake
manifold over time. Since when did a paper filter require sealing grease?
Good filters have a soft and rubbery sealing edge. K&N's are hard
urethane. 

 - "a special touch to install" - translation: our filters aren't
manufactured too precisely or too closely to spec so it may be kind of a
hassle to install and you may need our special grease just to seal out the
leaks. I doubt many owners use this grease and if they did, cleaning the
filter would be all the more messy. I've heard of owners having to
cut/grind/modify their factory air-box just to get the K&N filter to fit. 
What does this say about the quality of these filters? 

K&N: "A walk through the pits at an off-road race will show the numerous
K&N filters installed on competitive and class-winning machines. A look at
these filters after the race will show a considerable amount of dirt on
the outside of the filter, yet the inside will be as clean as a new
filter.." 

 - All used filters look clean on the inside! Perhaps the K&N is so clean
on the inside is because the dirt simply passed right though into the
engine. Also, what a lot of auto-products companies like to do is to use
racing as an example of why a regular driver should use their products. 
This is a false conclusion. Race car engines are constantly taken apart
and serviced so engine longevity isn't really a concern as it is for the
regular car owner. 

From Automotion Catalog on K&N filters: "Engine protection is so good that
over 90% of the NASCAR drivers use K&N filters....Maybe the best news is
K&N's written warranty,for the life of your engine." 

 - I seriously doubt NASCAR drivers care much about air filter protection. 
It's the air flow they're after. Their main concern is that the engine
will last the length of the race. 

 - As for the warranty for the life of the engine, wouldn't it be to K&N's
advantage if your engine DIDN'T last that long? They'd have fewer filters
to give away. Just like the timing belt joke...sure, the belt will last
the life of the engine; when the belt snaps, your engine's dead. If you
think about it, it is virtually impossible to prove damage from their
filter.  K&N claims a performance increase of 5 to 10% horsepower IF you
use their filter AND replace the factory air filter case.  This implies
changing the filter alone isn't going to buy you a whole lot, especially
when this may lead to pre-mature engine wear in the long run. Your engine
probably isn't going to take much advantage of the increased ability of
the air to flow if you don't reduce the restriction at the other end; the
exhaust system. 

  I've heard of many cases where 911 engines having easliy reached 200K mi
without major engine work and 944 engines opened up at moderately high
mileages and showing practically no measurable cylinder wear. Of these
cases, I wonder how many had K&N filters installed from the beginning? 

  I'd be interested to hear your comments on this filter or on my
ramblings. Actually, I hope I am wrong in my assumptions as I'm itching 
to put one in my car but given the reasons above, cannot do so in good 
conscience. Easy on the flame-throwers...

I can't speak for 944 stuff, but I was paying about $15 for stock air
filters, and I paid $30 for my K&N.  I have a '72 911, so YMMV

I change my oil about every other month or so (I know I don't need to,
but I'm anal that way) and I do the air cleaner every other time.  I
just hose it off, let it dry, and re-spray it.  A single can of oil has 
lasted me about 4 years!

Subject: Unleaded petrol

Well there has been a big fuss over here about unleaded petrol for non-cat
cars. Scientific evidence? suggests that benzene in unleaded petrol is worse
than the lead for the environemnt. Government could end up with egg on its
face as they have been pushing unleaded for that last 5+ years - and most cars
have not cats. 

  This has prompted me to ask what Porsche cars run on in the states - my 930
only runs on 4 star (98 octane) but PCGB says that 3 fills of Super unleaded
(98 octane, no lead) to 1 4 star is OK (My mechanics say 4 star ALLWAYS). I
have been wondering how long leaded petrol is going to last and what I will be
able to feed the thirsty beast in a few years time. Any comments most welcome.

For the first it's stupid to compare to F1!
Formula One is a testbed for the future,....lotsa ideas are transferred to 
standard cars and the money spent can (almost) be justified.

 Whereas a dragster is only motor and aerodynamics, and various combinations 
of the latter. How many breakthrough technology ideas evolved from Drag 
Racing?  

If you think pushrod Hemis are High-Tech, great for you. 584 cubic inches of 
Keith Black or Donovan *SHOULD* move a piece of tubing in a glassfibre shell 
fast.....*very* fast. If you think high speed/horsepower and high technology 
are synonyms, go buy yourself a dictionary....

The technology involved is old, too old in my opinion. It is just a matter 
of who's got the most Horsepower/Money.

Last time I went to see drag racing I fell asleep after the first hour, and 
that on the PRESS tribune, 25 metres from the Christmas tree.....only wake 
up for a few minutes to catch the Hydroperoxid jet dragster blow dowm the 
quarter in 4 seconds.

How about a '72?  A dealer near me has one that has been "completely 
rebuilt" - engine and all.  It looks to be in great shape, but they want 
$32,000.  Seems outrageous to me, even for one that's been rebuilt.

Hi... can I put koni strut inserts in my '69 912's boge front struts?  If
so, from whom would I order them?  

Maybe I should rephrase that: in Tweeks' and Performance catalogs (which
I have here at work), what they list as front 'shocks' - are those inserts
or complete shocks?

My question from two days ago still stands, BTW: how do I lube my A-arm
bushings?  They're squeaking like the dickens...

 Thanks to the detailed directions found in the Porschephiles archive I

 it makes a high pitched, loud, whining noise.  I think it sounds like a
 turbine my brother thinks it sounds like a vaccuum cleaner.  The noise is
 constant and does not vary significantly if the car is in neutral or in

 the rpm or car speed either.  I've already tightened the bolts on the exhaust system. 
 Have checked to see if I knocked a hose loose (didn't find one buy

Hmmm.  Only gas leak related problem I'm aware of with a 944 is one where we
yanked a person out of grid AND HE DIDN'T RUN AGAIN.  Perhaps you are
thinking of the time that the one of the safety team, Elmer Fooey, wanted to
bounce
an SCCA legal CP Mustang for his exhaust not terminating behind or to the
side of
the car.  Elmer's point was that the exhaust pointed at the rear axle and
was about 2'
from the gas tank.  In this instance, the other two members of the safety
TEAM met
with Elmer and it came to a 2 to 1 vote. It WASN'T the event chairman, and
it DID really
piss-off Mr. Fooey; but I also looked at the configuration and it met all
SCCA reqmt's
as well as having had been run that way for 2 years without problems. It
looked very
safe -- especially for an AX, If I was tech'ing the car for any kind of
high-speed event,
it would NOT have passed, however.

The current group is extremely concerned about safety at our AXes and I'd
have to
say that things have changed if that's what you were used to at LSR AX
events.  Again,
I think you ought to come out to one once you get settled.

I have to concur with you on the safety aspects, as well as the "fun
quotient"
of past high speed events at TWS.  I ran a bunch of Time Trials with Golden
Gate Region prior to moving to Texas, and I was literally scared to run with
the
LSR folks.  However, there is new blood running that series as well.  Once
Sally and my's national schedule calmed down this year I went to a TWS
event.
I was amazed at how much better they are run and how much safer they are
run.
The LSR TWS events are not near a level of safety (or competitiveness) that
the
GGR TimeTrials are run (things like full SCCA communications and SCCA
qualified corner workers is nice), but they are a lot better than they were.
 Again,
I'd say you ought to try one and see what you think, I know you'll see a
difference.
Besides, you won't have to think too hard on which car to take]  ;-)

Subject: 88 Carrera problem


I have a rather strange problem with my 88 Carrera.

If I rev the engine while the clutch is depressed,
the RPM falls at about half the speed one gets if
I rev the car with the clutch up. The car is obviously
in neutral to do this. This is an irritating problem
because when shifting up the revs do not drop as fast
as one can make the change.

For some reason pressure on the clutch pedal is interfering
with the release speed that the mechanism that the
accelerator pedal operates, is the theory that I have.

Is this a common problem? Does anyone know what might
be causing it, I am not familiar with the mechanics
of the pedal box, and would like some advice on diagnosing
this problem from one of you gurus please.

Hi, Sanjay,

Sound like you might have damaged the pilot bearing when replacing the
clutch. 

Or, it could be that you received a defective throwout bearing.

Or, that you assembled the throwout bearing improperly on the pressure plate.

I wouldn't touch it for the time being...maybe it will fix itself...

Yo, Bart. Been there, done that.

I autocrossed, time trialed, and raced my 2.0l for three years and then
last year, traded up to a "six". Here is what I found:

The 2.0 has slightly more low end grunt, is marginally quicker off the line
and handles about the same as the six. In fact, the simple addition of
carburetors makes the 2.0 quicker everywhere except at the very top end.

The six on the other hand, winds to an extra 1000 rpm, has better gearing,
slightly better brakes and makes a much nicer sound. On a track, the six is
significantly faster than an injected 2.0, and slightly faster than a
carbureted one. On an autocross course, they are all very close with the
edge going to the carbureted four bangers.

I really haven't noticed a big difference in handling except that, on the
track, the six is generally going faster so cornering is more of an exact science.

The side shift modification is a must for the track and serious
autocrossing, but not needed for average use.

There were over 115,000 914-4s manufactured, but only around 3360 sixes.
Expect to pay $3500 to $7000 for a four, and $10000 to $15000 for a six. A
first class, "concoursable" six can go as high as $20000 or $25000.  DO NOT
accept any visible rust! Rust is a sign of poor maintainance. And watch out
for "converted sixes", someone had to ruin two cars to make one.

Any issue of PANORAMA or EXCELLENCE, will have four or five sixes and twice
that many fours for sale.

Howdy,

After months *without* crawling around in my garage, I finally got around to 
remove the last traces of old paint on my '58 A model the last few days. 
Well almost, the original primer is still on at most places. It is *much* 
harder to remove. 

The 2000W 600 deg. C BOSCH heater gun I bought easily handled the task. I 
removed a total of 10-12 kilo of bondo, old paint (4 layers!!) and yucky 
mutations from the shell. Thats what one gets when people go crazy with 
sprayfiller!

To my big surprise I found all the uncovered outer panels to be 100% rust 
free. All the bondo/filler was there to 'hide' dents. 
Crazy, instead of knocking out the dents they used filler. The American 
way,....eh? ( just kiddin')

The next weekend I'll take out my BOSCH PEX 125 which is an excenter 
'grinding' machine with rotating speed at 22000RPM. I suspect 1-2 hours in 
the garage with this machine will leave me with a 'bare metal' A coupe.

Then I'll lead load around the Simonsen fender repair panels I used, and 
finish off with Corrorless. The heater gun could be fine for lead loading 
too, the lead comes off after some heating and I guess the gun will be great 
for this task. Anyone tried this?

I hope I'll have more to report from the project soon.....(as do the Car  :-)

Subject: 914 engine rebuild


Now that the weather is taking a turn for the worse and the body of my
'70 914-4 is ready for its trip to rustoration-land, its time to start 
the engine rebuild.

The goal is to have a very good-looking, streetable 914-4 I can enjoy for 
many years to come.  Once my baby is on the street, then I'll address 
performance issues if there's anything I don't like about the way it drives.

The engine has already been disassembled, cleaned and polished.  The stock
pistons/cylinders didn't, however, come close to specification when they were
measured.  Knowing as little as I did at the time, I opted to purchase a
"big bore" kit(it was cheaper than replacing the stock equipment), and have 
since been wrestling with the issues involved in increasing the displacement
of the stock engine.

I'm aware that it is impossible to slap on extra displacement and improve
performance.  I need to be fully aware of all the issues involved before I
start the rebuild(since I don't want to do it twice).  

In short, what are the required and optional addition modification the engine 
will require to support the 96mm pistons?  Would I be better off in returning 
to stock pistons and cylinders?

I've read that the D-Jetronic is very adaptive without modification.  To
address the additional displacement would 2.0l injectors do the job?  (If I
recall the bore kit uses pistons slightly larger than the stock 2.0)  

The specifications for the camshaft and timing are the same for the 1.7 and
the 2.0 914s, but the value sizes are different.  Are the larger valves crucial
to proper aspiration?

Heater boxes/muffler.  I definitely want an after market muffler, but am not 
sure if modifications to the exhaust system will be required.  What is 
necessary in this area?

You can see from the questions that it would probably be much easier in the
long run if I stuck to a stock engine.  However, I want to know *all* of the
issues involved before I sent the big bore kit back to the supplier.

Thanks in advance,
Jerry

I've seen the thread on the 928 that goes ten miles and stops. As a 
few other people have mentioned, the fuel pump or DME relay could be 
acting up. They are in line with each other on the circuit. They are
also fused. Check all locations. 
If the relays prove to be good, open the hood, and inspect the firewall
electrical connector (take it apart) for corrosion. this has proven to
be a source of similar troubles. This was covered in a recent Panorama

Also have the fuel pressure checked to see if the pressure regulator and

Hi Jerry,

Glad to see you're doing it right. Most people forget the critical
"clean and measure everything" step before getting into making decisions
about what they're going to do.

> In short, what are the required and optional addition modification the engine 
> will require to support the 96mm pistons?  Would I be better off in returning 
> to stock pistons and cylinders?

Hard to say. You have a 1.7, right? With the stock 1.7 EFI too, right? So
your big bore kit will take you to just over 1.9 liters. For the engines we
do at Ghost Racing with the NPR big bores, we usually also add a few things:

* balance everything -- crank, rods, flywheel, clutch presure plate, etc.
  You don't have to balance the pistons out of the box, but if you have 
  to deck-cut them, you'll need to do them too.
* high-capacity oil pump
* if it's going to be used "hard" or in very hot climate (like TX, AZ, etc),
  an external oil cooler with fan
* if it's either going to be a long-life or high performance engine, a
  Canton/MECA oil filter setup
* for competition, an Accusump
* for better performance, a FAT Performance "fuel injection cam"
  with new lifters (ALWAYS use new lifters with a new cam!) and new
  timing gear.

None of these things are "required" -- they just make you like the big bore
better. The oil mods allow you to maximize the life of your engine. The cam
gives you 10-15% more power and works very well with the big bore.

> I've read that the D-Jetronic is very adaptive without modification.  To

Yes. We use stock 2.0 injectors on 1.7 big bore kits. You also *MAY* need
to modify your manifold pressure sensor to be adjustable. With a first-
increment cam, it's usually not required; with the next step up it's almost
a certainty. 

> The specifications for the camshaft and timing are the same for the 1.7 and
> the 2.0 914s, but the value sizes are different.  Are the larger valves crucial
> to proper aspiration?

Depends. On the 2.0, there's absolutely no way that you need any head work
at all. On the 1.7/1.8 heads, it depends. For "normal" street use, you're
probably fine. I would recommend a venturi valve job (different from the 
"racing 3-cut valve job" that some places sell, or the stock two-cut.
For anything where you need to *sustain* over 5400 RPM, you have to do the
math and put your heads on a flow bench. Sometimes it's just a little porting,
sometimes it's new bigger valves. For full-race E Production engines, it's
cut the head in four pieces, weld up and re-cut the whole intake and exhaust
paths, weld the head back together, etc. About $2k a head for state-of-the-art
but that's a 10,000 RPM applications....

Big valves will slow the airflow speed at low RPM causing poor performance 
until you get to the point where they make a diffference. Since that's a
high-RPM application, it's seldom justified on the street.

> Heater boxes/muffler.  I definitely want an after market muffler, but am not

Nothing.  Use a Bursch extractor muffler and stock heat exchangers. The
next step up is a full Kerry Hunter header system, and that's not only
expensive, but you lose the heaters. Not indicated for cars that are not
*MAINLY* competition vehicles.

I think I've pretty much covered it. You'll need to check your deck height
and have the high pistons deck-cut to make that the same on all cylinders.
You can run a deck height of 0mm, BTW. You will also need to re-compute
the compression that you get with the cc volume of your heads, the deck
height and your new bore size. You can run up to 9.5:1 on super unleaded,
but extra oil coolin gis *HIGHLY* encouraged at that point. Stock is 7.6:1
and you *SHOULD* have about 8.5:1 or so with the kit as it comes. If you
need more deck height to reduce compression, you can either shim the
barrels or deck cut the pistons, I usually vote for shimming the barrels
but *ALWAYS* shim them all the same. Use Locktite 574 as a case sealer,
not Permatex 3H or *ANY* RTV/silicon/etc product. And good luck!

Wait a minute - "the noise doesn't vary with the rpm" - does that mean

GeorgeB mentions the possibility of defective throwout or pilot bearings.
However, the above description makes me think of the radiator fan. This
is a two speed fan which is nearly inaudible at low speed but quite loud
at full speed. Perhaps its (actually, their, there are two fans) controlling
circuit (relay and temp sensor switch) has been defective and up to
now only running the fan at low speed. Now, the nature of the defect
has changed so that the fan is running constantly at high speed.

Just a thought...

From: Bert=Garcia%DSS%DSS=Hou@bangate.compaq.com

Bert asked...
Does anybody remanufacture the CD-1 or resell restored units?  Do any of 
you do this kind of work or am I better off buying another different unit 
from the local stereo store?  (tuner's shot..I'm ready to buy!!)

I have the CD-2 out of my 89 928GT sitting on my lap as I write this.  The
unit is manufactured by IWAKI ONKYO in Japan and you should be able to get an
authorized agency to repair it.  Mine was replaced by the previous owner
because he felt the tuner quality sucked.  He replaced it with an Alpine
which I am very happy with.  Just have to upgrade the speakers...

Hope this helps!

car garauged for the last 5 year. I just installed the Boge TS
front and rear struts allong with new springs. Last time shown
was at the 914 owners reunion show and took 2nd place. Driving
the car is like driving a new one. It is 100% factory equiped 
(save for the springs which are no longer available) and rust free.
Reason for my selling this vehicle is the purchase of a 66 911.
I am a motivated seller and am willing to negotiate a fair price
for such a fresh, clean example. I live in the centre of PA in
a little town called Lewistown, aprox. 25 miles from State College.
This is where the prospective owner would need to come to view the

     One of the most exhilirating things I did during college (since I went
 to a school with lots more engineers than women...)  was a "drag race start"
 on my KZ1000; in first gear, feet down, rev the motor the 8krpm--to launch,
 start to slip the clutch and increase throttle to stay near 9krpm. Then
 you perform a balancing act of slipping the clutch out while increasing
 throttle, so after 1 second when the clutch is all the way out you are
 already at redline, and at peak HP the whole time.  This works great (time
 and again) on a motorcycles' multi-plate clutch, I was able to do it -once-
 in my 911 ! Smoke, smell, slip, Visa....

     Dragsters use open-loop "traction control," where a multi-finger clutch
 keeps engaging as the car travels down the quarter; the motor stays at
 6500 rpm, the drivetrain itself finally locks up the last 200 feet.
 Closed-loop traction control was banned after it won 2 years (I think 
 87/88), nowadays actuation of the clutch is probably the key to winning the 
 race; a computer is used only to train on the course (they can still monitor
 tire slippage, they just can't use that information til the next run) to
  setup the clutch.

     Pete, thanks for educating that Nitromethane is a "monopropellant." If
 Air/Fuel mass ratio is 14:1 (for gasoline), and the -volume- of air-fuel is
 11,500:1, imagine how much energy you can pack into a supercharged cylinder 
 if you don't have to worry about so much air !  Supposedly a dragster uses
 like 7 Gallons of fuel during its 5 second run (yes, 28gpm). You'd have a
 hard time dumping over 7 buckets during only 5 seconds.....but actually 
 combusting it is incredible.

    So tech question, what is the correct Air/fuel ratio for nitromethane  
blend  ??  Or, imagine a 600 cubic inch motor (er, engine) runs at 6500 rpm  
 for 5seconds  and uses 7 gallons of fuel...

6mm for a '77 911

I have observed this being done to my '77 911.  This seems to be quite
a touchy adjustment.  My local mechanic charges between $10 and $15 to
do this with an exhaust analyzer.  Seems like a good deal.

A friend of mine tried this adjustment himself on his 911 with a crappy
analyzer.  He ended up with fouled plugs and a tow job.

Good Luck,

Subject: Porshcephiles and AOL

All, 

First my apologies to some of you that I may have incorrectly advised that
you could use AOL Flashsessions with Windows to download your porschephiles
mail and read it offline. While this is true for almost all Macintosh
versions of AOL that have been released, the Windows versions don't have it
yet.  It alledgedly will be out when version 2.0 comes out.  I never DREAMED
that AOL would leave something so vital out of the Windows versions that had
been in the Mac version for so long. The closest you can come at the moment
is to ask Stan for the digest version rather than individual mail, open your
mail and save it to a file, then read it offline.

Second, if you have version 2.5.1 of the Mac version of AOL (I don't know
about earlier versions), you can now FTP files from the internet, including
porschephiles.  Use Keyword "FTP" , and when you go thru a couple of other
dialog boxes that allow you to enter your own ftp address, simply enter
"tta.com".  You'll see file folders once it connects, and you can find the
Porsche files in the "publications" folder as I recall.  I have NO idea if
any of this works with the Windows versions. This is new to AOL and they
admit it still has some bugs. And given my experiences with the internet, you
won't ALWAYS connect the first time.  My limited experience with this on AOL
is that it is reasonably fast for a modem connection at 9600 baud, actually
better than my convoluted internet connection at work! REMEMBER Stan's rules
about the times to access the files.  If in doubt, read the RULES that he
uploads once a month.

Good luck.

Just noticed this thread and thought I'd insert this info.  Someone oughta buy 
this car I've seen for sale around these parts for the last 2 years.  It's a 
1971 911T with low low (less than 5K) miles on it.  It's a silver car.  The 
story I remember is that someone bought it new, had a minor fender bender, 
took it to a body shop.  The body shop fixed the car (pretty good job) and the 
owner never showed, died, moved, went to jail, whatever.  The body shop owner 
finally got the title, put the car in storage and there she sat until 
recently.  I first saw the car in a repair shop (does good work) where they 
were getting it out of storage and running.  The owner was asking 25K.  I saw 
it recently and it was still for sale but now for 16K.  The phone is 510 452 
2700.  I have no monetary interest.etc., etc.. Would be nice to see someone 
buy it and do a concours number on it.  So, gentlemen, start your index 
fingers......and dial away.

Hello PorschePhiles,

I have a Blaupunkt (Reno model) in my 944 which I think needs service.

I was thinking about removing the stereo, I can use the tools that came
with my Saab to remove it, and take it to a stereo service shop. 
The problem is that I'm not sure if this Blaupunkt unit has
any security code that has to be re-entered after installation.
If so, who should I call to get this code?

Subject: 356 tires

Hello PBoys (and PGirls). Need some net wisdom on tire and rim choices for the 
C cpe. Thanks in advance for the input. 
 
Currently have 4 1/2 chromes with Michelin 165x15's.  Tires are starting to 
get small cracks in the sidewalls.  Have had this happen with other tires this 
size on the 356's and  912's I've had.  Seems like the cars are so light that 
you can't hardly wear out tires before they die from old age.  I associate 
this condition with a lack of adhesion.  They seem to get hard and lack bite.  
Anyway, these tires are not too sticky.  I push it a bit on local two lanes 
and get perpendicular to the white line a little too easy.  Doesn't bother me 
as much as it rattles oncoming traffic but I would like some sneakers that 
stick a lot better. 
 
Soooo, how large a tire and what brand?  I'd like to keep the car as stock as 
possible for street concours events. What am I limited to with the 4 1/2 rim?  
I can get steel 5 1/2 rims pretty easily.  Chrome one's are another story.  If 
I go for the 5 1/2's, what will fit.  Looked at a 356 cab, 63 with 5 1/2's and 
165s.  There didn't seem to be much air between the fender and tire.    Any of 
you 356 faithful have any ideas and recommendations for brands, tires, 
concepts, ect. Also, do tires lose their adhesion with age and is there any 
preventative steps one can take. I  had a set of Continentals go away in 3 
years/ 6000miles.  Sidewalls cracked and they seemed to "loose their grip".  
Is that my imagination or does it really happen. 
 Thanks again, Ted Smith

Not a bad choice. But there are better.

I'm running 195/65x15 Pirelli P6s. The last set was P600s, but they got
totaled in an unfortunate incident involving a 50 pound box of roofing
nails. 

Unlike the 9xx cars, the 356 has a special problem: it's a swing axle rear
suspension. That means you get a serious camber change with body roll,
fore-aft weight transfer, and changing phase of the moon. To maximize the
amount of rear tire you keep on the ground with a fairly stock car, you 
need a fairly tall sidewall and a rounded shoulder on the tire. That's
where the problems come in.... that's *NOT* how modern performance tires
are typically built.

You can get Michelin XZX in 165x15, but that's a pretty crummy tire. There
are more options in 185/70x15, but most of them have square shoulders.
There are *SOME* tires in 195/65x15, still having the square shoulder problem,
and you really can't go bigger than that without modifications.

Despite all the really nasty things I say about Pirelli, I use them for
this ONE application. P6, P600, and yes, you can even get CN-36s (which
are just the CN-36 tread carved on a P6 carcass). If you need the CN-36s,
which are a pretty nifty thing for the concours events, they're only 
available from Eurotire in Fairfield NJ or Stamford CT to my knowledge. 
It's supposedly part of some special deal they have that involves the tire
support for the Ferrari Challenge.

Anyway, I'd also consider the Yoko A-382s, since they're slightly rounded.
I use them on my wife's car, but decided to go back with Pirelli for the
356 again.

For serious competition use, you'll have stiffer rear torsion bars, do the

use the modern tires in 185/70 or 195/65! A008s tend to rip your suspension

Absolutely! The rubber hardens and as a result has less adhesion. The best
preventative I've found is to just drive the bejesus out of the car, and
try to wear the tires out first! It's usually worked for me.... (except
this one set of Flintstone umm, errr, Firestone slicks that just wouldn't
wear out....)

Subject: Re: CIS mixture adjustment tool

Hi Andy -

If I remeber right from my 924 days (I had two of them; '77 & '78) it 
takes a long 3mm allen type wrench.  As you adjust the set screw down 
inside the injection body, clockwise raises the sensor plate thus making 
the mixtures richer.  It doesn't take much to adjust this.  A quarter 
turn is too much.  Make a mental note of where allen wrench aligns with 
something to start and adjust maybe only 1/12 of a turn per time.  Then 
drive that car a bit and check your progress.  And also don't put to much 
downward pressure on the wrench as it is adjusted.

Hope this helps.  If this is wrong, maybe Jim Pasha should correct?

Hi all,
My conversations with Josh have brought back a nagging question at the back
of my mind. This is it: 914 140,000 miles, no rebuilds burns oil at the
rate of 1 quart every 900 miles. Smokes only under heavey acceleration or
backing off at high RPM. Corrvette auto X guy named me old smokey. It
smokes alot in these situation. Driving moderately the smoke is not
visiable. Can any body ball park how long the motors last. By the way I
drive a lot of hiway miles. I'm going Lancaster PA to New York city this
weekend. Is this motor ready to die.
Question two: When the motor reaches this point in life I'm I risking
massive engine failure and masive damage to the engine part I would hope to
reuse in a rebuild like the crank after some machine work engine case and .
. . or is it just going to loose compression over time until it one day
won't start?
Finally I have been chasing the FI hesitation slight miss and backfire
through exhaust mostly but sometimes through air filter I was reading in
Hanyes that these syptoms could be burned valves. Does this sound right for
this kind of mileages?

Hi all,
My brake upgrade situation as of now is as follows. 911 master cylinder 73
911 front calipers braid lines (I know about the braided line failure
thread I like the pedal feel and will replace them every two years). When I
installed this as is fronts locked up first. They locked up way before the
rears. Corrective action #1 proportioning valve to the rear all the way.
Helped but not much valve leaked (It was 20 years old). Next step replace
valve with T-junction helped I think maybe it was in my head because it
helped  a little. Heres the question. How about higher friction pads at the
rear? Or is this a bad idea. If I do try higher friction pads in back I'm I
going to wish I had the valve back to balance things out or can I get a
subtle change in pads? Finally the most expensive fix upgrade rear
calipiers. I have heard this is harder and more expensive than up front.
What are my options here.
Thanks

Lots of miles for a 2.0 what can happen you can suck a valve and
really case internal problems.  To rebuild a 2.0 will run 3500 for
a better than factory engine.  You can gain a lot by using euro
spec pistons and barrels which you will need to replace anyway
with those milesl.  do not use the NPR big bore kits they do not
work very well as the rings do not seat.

I would do much to the fuel injection until you get the engine
done and running then ck out the fuel injection as some of the
problems could go away with a good engine.

My guess is that most of your smoke is bad lose valve guides and
rings are gone by now.  

If eng never been rebuilt and you do not have rod knock you should
be in good shape to rebuild your engine with minimal machine work.

Subject: K&N air filters, 356 oil filters

 
Hi, Chris.
 
Good posting. Makes sense to me. I especially like the claim about "flow
straighteners." We should start marketing stick-on "speedlines" to improve
the aerodynamics of our cars -- little tape or wire dealies that extend back
from the edge of the roof, etc. to make the car look like it's zooming
right along.
 
I don't have anything to add to your assessment of K&N (I now have even less
intention to buy them than before I read your post) but your line about
using Knecht filters reminds me.
 
Before this weekend's slalom at Las Vegas, I decided to change the oil and
filter of my 356. For the first time in about four years, I replaced the
rubber gasket in the oil filter canister lid. The old one was fine, but hey,
an Italian filter I bought had a fresh rubber ring in it. Being a little
skeptical of this odd brand Italian filter, I used a Mann
filter but the Italian gasket. Just to be safe, I put the old gasket in my
on-board tool kit. Torqued the filter can lid down tight like it needs to
be, started up, checked for leaks, everything fine. Drove around for two
days, no problems. On the way to Vegas, checked the engine at a fuel stop in
Barstow, everything OK. My co-driver parked the car while I went for
munchies. Coming back, there was a trail of oil leading back from the car,
and a big puddle under it. I followed the trail back, it started 20 ft. past
the fuel pump. Total oil loss under 1 liter, and quick reinstallation of
the old gasket fixed it, but if it had happened underway, it is possible I
would not have noticed oil smoke in my mirrors it until way too late and the
green oil pressure light came on.
 
So I'm returning the remaining stock of my Italian oil filters and sticking
with the German filters and old rubber seal. (I don't use the new German
cardboard seals).

Nope. A T junction should send even more pressure to the back -- a prop.
valve is just not 100% "clear" when adjusted all the way off. So that's
believable.

This is a bad idea. For starters, it's just about impossible to find
pads with differing coefficients of friction that also have the thermal
properties. So there will be an operating range in which things could
be OK (or more realisticly, could be adjusted to be OK using a prop. valve)
but ove the operating temp range of normal usage, or more particuarly,
SEVERE usage, one end of the other will "go away" first. Probably just
when you need it. Also, there's the future liability issue -- if you've
designed a system that only works with model X pads in front and model Y
pads in rear, and eventually SELL the car to someone that promptly tosses
out your written instructions on how to care for the car, you could have a
really interesting problem on your hand when they have a serious braking
related accident....

> Finally the most expensive fix upgrade rear

You *COULD* do this. For racing, where you don't want/need an ermergency
brake, it's common to use 911 M calipers on the rear. Works really well.
But you won't pass inspection in any state that has a DOT based inspection
program (like TX). Hence, it's not a great idea for street cars.

Best idea: a dual master cylinder with adjustable bias bar. Should be
about $200 or so, some fabrication required to make it work for your
car. Tilton, Neal, JFZ all make good parts. Then you can fine-tune
your braking as you like it.

Here's the deal: 914 cranks rarely break but often bend. The big problem
is that if the main bearings have gone, the case center is likely 
pounded out. Or worse, there may have been fretting at the edges of 
the case or on the center webs. In either of those situations, the case
is worthless and cannot be reused. Good used cases are only about $150,
but still... So, you have to send the crank and rods out to be checked,
and may have to toss the case. Beyond that, I'd bet that the cam is
toast, and if you replace that, you also have to replace the lifters.
Plus, you will likely need to replace the pistons and cylinders, and
may need to have cracked heads repaired if it's a 2.0 or a 1.8 (don't
ask me why the 1.7s don't crack, they just don't). And of course a
valve job, with new guides, seals, and almost certainly, exhaust valves.

Don't even bother chasing this until you have the rest of the engine done.

Subject: 951 suspension upgrade options

In my quest to turn a stock non-S 951 into the ultimate track car, 
I've discovered two different methods (so far) of upgrading the 
suspension.  An article in Up Fixin Der Porsche vol. 7 describes
the installation of stiffer springs, a larger sway bar, and larger 
torsion bars to match.  This is confirmed by what I see at the track
as well as what I read from other p-philers.  

As an alternative, a mechanic I've been using lately has suggested a 
different approach:

1) Install larger (30mm) sway bar in front
2) Install coil-over shocks with adjustable ride height (400lb springs 
   front, 250lb or 350lb springs in back)
3) Leave torsion bars alone
4) Test car at track, and adjust ride height and/or change springs 
   in rear until car performs as desired
    
I think his theory is that the springs in back will take the place of
the stiffer torsion bars, and will be less costly to swap in and out
if additional changes are desired. 

I'd appreciate any comments on this approach, especially from those 
who have 951 track cars.  Thanks.

Just got back from Atlanta, where I spent 2 fun filled days
drooling over cars that are worth more than I'll make in my
lifetime.  The Sportscar Vintage Racing Assoc. held an event 
at Road Atlanta and about 200 vintage racers showed up. Lots of
356's, a few 911's and a 906 were there.

Wow, what a weekend. Of course, now I have the "racing bug".

While I was in Atlanta, I dropped by the famous shop of "Dr 914",
Automobile Atlanta.  Nice collection of 914's, 914-6's, 914-6GT's 
and a 916. A little disappointed that they were all behind glass, but
I can understand that he didn't want my drool and paw prints all over
them.  While I was there I picked up a few low dollar items even 
though I may have been able to get them cheaper somewhere else.
One of the parts I needed was the ignition switch for my 914. I told
George the symptom's and he said that the plastic switch usually
cracks and that it was easy to replace. I asked how big a job it was
and he said if I had the car with me, it would only take him about 15
minutes. Since the car was 400 miles away, George brought out a
complete steering column and switch assembly and showed me how
to do it! This probably saved me several hours of frustration because
I would not have thought that I needed to put the key in the switch 
and release the steering lock in order to get the switch assembly out.
I guess it sometimes pays to buy parts from a guy who knows about
your car.

Torsion bars are not that bad if you are mathmatically minded.

I uprated mine from 24 mm to 26mm (38% increase) by measuring angular
sweep of the 24mm bar, then calculating (by multiplying by 62%) the
angular sweep req'd by the new torsion bars, adjusting the inital
rotation of the trailing arem accoringly, and setting the 26mm to that
position.

Alone, without a lift it took about 8hrs and was very close the first
try.  Contraty to popular beleif, the eccentric on the trailing arm
gives .75" of rear height adjustment eah way from center, so you don't
really have to be that close on the torsion bar adjustment.

The problem with the spring-seat rear shocks is that the springs rare
lightly preloaded at normal ride height (unless you pull the torsion
bars and back them off), so they "clank" as the car comes off the rear,
such as under decelleration.

Secondly, the shocks/springs  are VERY expensive.

If yo ucan decide what spring rate you want in the rear, you can
calculate the diameter of the torsion bars, install them, and be pretty
close.  I think something like 30MM woul dbe pretty radical for a track
car (244% as stiff as stock 86, 191% as stiff as TurboS ) it's not a
bad setup.  At @$ 200 per pair it's pretty cost effective even if you
guess wrong once.

Subject: Nitromethane and my moped

 
Hi, Lee.
 
I just found a reference to nitromethane in the excellent new book "High
Performance" this morning. It seems drag racers run 2:1 or even 1:1 air/fuel
ratios while dumping straight nitromethane into the cylinders. I guess
rocket engines, open at one end, can go from liquid state to combustion
by-products with no problem, but I guess it's impractical fill the entire
combustion chamber with liquid and then light it off...
 
Stoichiometric air/fuel ratio; lessee if I get this right, chemists please
help/feel free to correct.
 
Nitromethane is CH3NO2 (3 and 2 subscripts, of course, can't do it here).
 
4 CH3NO2  + 3 02  --> 4 CO2 + 6 H2O + 2 N2
 
(not considering the CO2 or N2 in air; simplified version, it goes through
unchanged)
 
So yeah, for complete combustion you add oxygen. (How do rockets do it? Why
is this then a monopropellant, no oxidizer required for rocket use?
Anybody?)
 
Specific weight of nitromethane is 61.04 grams/mole. Oxygen in air has a
mole fraction of .2095, so you need 28.967/.2095  = 138.3 grams of air to
get a mole of oxygen.
 
So air/fuel ratio for stoichiometric combustion of nitromethane is
 
[138.3 x 3] / [61.04 x 4] = 1.699.  By comparison, the stoichiometric
air/fuel ratio for 2,2,4 trimethylpentane (close enough to gasoline),
C8H18, is as follows:
 
2 C8H18 + 25 O2 --> 16 CO2 + 18 H2O plus all the inert stuff,
 
AFR = (25 x 138.3) / (2 x 114.223) = 15.13, there's that magic
15:1 air/fuel ratio we always hear about.

Subject: 944 Pulleys; Addendum


Milo, 

One thing I forgot to mention when inspecting all toothed gears and pulleys,
if the pulley teeth have tooth wear from the belt and/or pits, replace them.

Tooth wear is when there is a perceptable ridge or shoulder from the belt
passing over the tooth. This erosion is the same as metal-to-metal wear,
eventually there will be a problem. If you can feel a shoulder by pulling
your fingernail across the DRIVEN face, replace it. It will wear a new belt
too.

This is one good reason to ALWAYS have the timing belt covers on while the
vehicle is in service. The dirt and crud present when driving will 
destroy a belt and the gears in a short period of time.

If everything is in good order, then okay. If you, the owner, has a doubt,
replace the component.

Hello Porschephiles,

I'm new to the list, I've been lurking for a while to see if you are a
friendly bunch. It looks as if you are, so I'll post a question or
two.

I've just recently become very interested in owning a Porsche. Either
356 or 911. Don't get me wrong, the others are nice cars, but the shape
and the idiosyncratic arrangement for these cars makes them very
special.

What I'd really like to do is to restore one of these models, but I've
never restored a car before. However I hate to see a beautiful thing
grow old. I do some simple maintenence on my wife's MG Midget ('72)
but this is her daily driver and doesn't really need too much work at
the moment. I'm attending a course in car restoration where I'm
learning bodywork/coachbuilding type skills. I should be learning some
mechanical restoration skills next year.

>From what I read here a number of you maintain and restore your own
Porsches. Do you find them difficult to work on? I'm inclined to think
that restoring a Porsche as a first project is probably more than I
could/should handle. Would I be better to start with a simpler car?
I've considered starting with a VW Beetle as these seem to be fairly
easy to work on, not too expensive, and might present me with some of
the problems I might encounter on a Porsche. Is this a good idea? Have
any of you restored both? How do they compare (as a project)?

I'd be interested to hear your opinions,

Chris Willis

Another answer which may or may not be more likely:  
In Arizona, or New Mexico, there is this sled test, which is a car on railroad 
tracks.  When the company I work for was making the inertial guidance systems 
for the Apollo missions, and other spacecraft and missles, they made these
accelerometers which they bolted to the sled and sent down the track to test.
Similar to a drag race, but no other sled next to it.  The G forces
measured on this sled were far beyond what a human could withstand without
coming out of a drivers seat in the form of a pancake (eyes in back of head,
most internal organs flattened against rear of the rib cage, etc.  You get
the idea, its Halloween right?).  They would put outdated or surplus missle 
engines on the back of this sled.  I know NASA put animals, and astronauts
on this type of sled, to see the effects and what rates lateral G forces can be
sustained by humans.  The sleds can pull 200+ G's and reach Mach 6.  The 
limiting factor of speed at sea level is aerodynamics and heat.  Humans who 
pilot fighter planes blackout at around 6 to 10 G's, and a guy who worked 
for NASA won a congressional medal of honor to sit on that sled and see what 
the limitations of the human body were.  They found out that the limiting 
factor of acceleration or deceleration on a human was the point where your 
eyeballs pop out of your head.  This happens at about 25 G's, and the guy 
nearly lost his eyesight.  A rocket car could be made that would make you 
a winner of the race for sure, but never be able to see the prize money.

Subject: 356 tires

 
Hi, Ted Smith.
 
My personal recommendation is to get those 5 1/2 inch wheels or have your
present wheels widened if/when you rechrome them (not that expensive, in fact
it should be free if you decide to have the wheels
rechromed, as part of the rechroming process is to cut off the
old rims and weld fresh ones on; it's not worth trying to get a smooth
surface on old pitted rims). I like Bridgestone RE71 tires, size
195/60 x 15. If you get these, you won't be sorry. They stick and last a long
time in regular driving. Yes, they are a bit smaller in diameter than stock,
but I have zero problems with clearance.
 
On 4 1/2 inch rims, it is going to be hard to find modern performance
rubber.
 
I don't concours, but I understand that 5 1/2 wheels are accepted now,
without penalty points (anybody differ?)
 
You might consider an extra set of 5 1/2 and keep the 4 1/2 (and you
should keep them, unchanged, if they are the original rims from the car,
with correct date stamps; note that not all wheels on a car need to have
exactly the same date stamp). For concours, Stan's CN36 suggestion sounds
good, and you can also get Continental Contact tires, new, in 165 SR 15.
Continental and Dunlop were OE suppliers to Porsche; I don't think Pirelli
supplied tires for 356s.

Hi every one,
Now that people have suggested that it is time to rebuild and sooner is
better than later I have a dilema. The 914 is my only car for at least a
year. So how much would it be to buy a core 2.0l motor that has a good case
and a good chance of having a usable crank and good heads. What about the
possibility of buying one with an induction system, preferably FI. Is 3500
dollars a resonable budget to get a 2.0l core motor and build it with a cam
and euro pistons. Is there a big bore kit that works better than the
slapping NPR kit that is cost effective. The extra oil cooling suggested
earlier for a similar project was external oil cooler and hi volume oil
pump. My goal is a reliable 130-140hp are these resonable modifications to
get there in this kind of budget. I plan on doing all the work that doesn't
require machining myself. The ideal would be to get the motor working
outside of the car, so the only down time would be instalation. One weekend
I hope.
Thanks for the insights

It's no big deal, but it's SOOOOO much easier to do with air tools
that it's not even funny...  Find out what your mechanic want for
the labor first. You an spend a couple of hours doing this with
hand tools, but do all four in half an hour with air tools and
a little experience. This is one of those deals where the Flat Rate Manual
works very heavily in the mechanic's favor...

Lowering the car much more than to Rest of World specs is not a
great idea unless you bump up the spring rates and shock dampning
rates. I used to run my Euro 911 at RoW height and found that I
only had parts drag on the ground coming out of or goin into very
steep driveways.

Maybe. You can have the brackets altered more easily on many of the
aftermarket seats than the stock seats. Best value is an aluminum
stock car seat for about $150 (see ads in Circle Track and Stock Car
Racing). Best seat is a Recaro, priced from $500 to as much as you
want to spend. Sparco also has a good fiberglass seat, nicely
padded with Nomex, for not too much.

Howdy,
     
After months *without* crawling around in my garage, I finally got around to 
remove the last traces of old paint on my '58 A model the last few days. 
Well almost, the original primer is still on at most places. It is *much* 
harder to remove. 
     
The 2000W 600 deg. C BOSCH heater gun I bought easily handled the task. I 
removed a total of 10-12 kilo of bondo, old paint (4 layers!!) and yucky 
mutations from the shell. Thats what one gets when people go crazy with 
sprayfiller!
     
To my big surprise I found all the uncovered outer panels to be 100% rust 
free. All the bondo/filler was there to 'hide' dents. 
Crazy, instead of knocking out the dents they used filler. The American 
way,....eh? ( just kiddin')
     
The next weekend I'll take out my BOSCH PEX 125 which is an excenter 
'grinding' machine with rotating speed at 22000RPM. I suspect 1-2 hours in 
the garage with this machine will leave me with a 'bare metal' A coupe.
     
Then I'll lead load around the Simonsen fender repair panels I used, and 
finish off with Corrorless. The heater gun could be fine for lead loading 
too, the lead comes off after some heating and I guess the gun will be great 
for this task. Anyone tried this?
     
I hope I'll have more to report from the project soon.....(as do the Car  :-)
     
cheers,
trond

I just did this exercise for another list member in a similar situation.
Core's *ARE* available, sometims with EFI, sometimes not. Odds are 50-50 
on any piece of the core being usable. Rods are *USUALLY* not a problem 
unless you're building some kind of competition motor where you just don't
want to even think about using reconditioned rods. The crank, case, and
heads all automaticly need to be cleaned and checked carefully. If you
can't use the case, good used is about $150. If you can't use the heads,
they can be fixed, or you can go looking for more. 2.0 heads in good
shape are *VERY* hard to find, BTW. If it has the EFI still intact, you
can use everything but the injectors and probably the injection points.

*NO*. Euro pistons alone are $800 as of two days ago. We figured that we
could get a core engine, do all the work, and have it ready to ship for
about $6500. There was only $1100 of labor in that price.

No.  There are no good 914 big bores. Next question.

Yes. And you still  need that if you change the HP output on the engine.
Unless, of course, you live north of the artic circle...

Dream on. You *CAN* get 120HP out of a streetable engine. You *CAN NOT* get
a long life from that engine. Maybe 45-50k miles tops. And while I have
no doubt that most of the people on the list *COULD* build an engine in
their driveway using a $99 set of Craftsman sockets and get it to sort of
run, trying to build a performance engine with no experience, none of the
special tools, none of the industry contacts, and have it be your FIRST
engine is sort of like OJ Simpson suddenly deciding to defend himself....

For your application and budget, the best thing you can do is call up 
FAT, RIMCO, or GEX and get a 914 long block sent out to you for about $1200.
It'll take all weekend to swap the sheet metal, EFI, etc. but it's 
cheap and quick. Make sure if you currently have a 2.0 that you get a
*914* 2.0 with the three-stud heads instead of a Type II 2.0...

If you had more money, I'd suggest you call Ghost Racing and get a real
engine...

I'd recommend that you start with a '63 VW Beetle. It's easier, cheaper,
the parts are more available, and when you're done, it's still a nice
car with decent market value.

I've done early Jags, pre-1950 VWs, many different Porsches, tube-frame
race cars from the dim past, and Mustangs. They *ALL* take the same
amount of work. They all have the same sorts of things wrong with them.
The difference is in what you have when you're done, and how much the
parts cost.

Subject: RE: 944 Parking Brake, parts fiche

| From: Carl Brian Klinetob  <vp@strauss.udel.edu>
|
| 	I need a little help with adjusting my parking brake.  There was a
| discussion about this before in which someone said there are two
| adjustments: one at the handle and on at the rear wheels.  The haynes
| manual I have also says this but only show illustrations for rear drum
| brakes.  Mine has disk and I was unable to find any way to adjust the
| cable there.  Can anyone help me?  Thanks.

Haynes shows drums because the parking brakes *are* drums.
These are miniature drum brakes in the hub of the rear disk rotors.
The parking brake adjusts just like you would expect of a drum
setup: turn the star adjuster to spread the drums apart or vice
versa. You need to jack the car and remove the rear wheels
because the access hole for the star nut is between a pair of
wheel lugs.

The only real problem you might encounter would be if
the parking brakes had been neglected long enough
for the star wheel to be "frozen" on its threads. Disassembling
the hub is not fun because of the stub axle nut: it's torqued
to 400 ft/lbs. And, if the car has been driven a lot with the
parking brake engaged, then the shoes may be worn
out. This would be an extreme case though.

At any rate, adjust the shoes to the point that they rub when the
hub is spun and then back off until they just no longer rub. If, at
this point, the parking brake lever still comes up too high, then
you will need to adjust the cable nut underneath the lever.

* The Parts Fiche

I had forgotten exactly how the parking brake went together,
so I looked at my parts fiche.

The official parts fiche for your year and model car is a
great source of information. Not only do they give the part
numbers so you can order replacement parts, but they are
composed of exploded diagrams of every assembly in the
car. Viewing the fiche, you can tell what parts disassemble,
what they look like, and more or less how they fit together.

If you don't have a parts fiche, go to the dealer and get one.
The local dealer gave me an old one free of charge. Most
libraries have fiche readers and some have readers with
built in photocopiers so you can get hard copy diagrams.
I consult the parts fiche more often than the factory service
manual, although the manual is a valuable source of info
if you intend to do serious repairs.

BTW, the dealer (Barrier Motors)gave me a great PCA discount
on the service manual: $165. Most mail order places get nearly
a hundered bucks more.

Subject: 914 engine choices

Hi all,
Now I know what a four banger is going to cost to get 120hp it is not
really an option in my mind. Now The body of the 914 isn't perfect, but all
structural rust was removed last winter so all that is left are some
bubbles in the sail panel and front fenders. These are very small. And of
course there is the rusty rear trunk floor. I can live without fixing this
for a while longer.
Now with the motor. The way I look at it is I have two serious options. One
3.0SC motor with modified body or FI to fit under the rear trunk, or a 2.0
six built out to 2.4 and carborated. Now I am inclined to the 3.0 with FI
because of reliability and CIS. But what about emissions with this motor.
For it to pass will I have to come up with a fancy custom exhaust that has
catalytic converters
Engine choice two: a built 2.0 six. Going this route do I avoid all
emission regs. Finally the 914 is mainly a blast because of low wieght in
my mind. How big a weight penalty for the 3.0 over 2.4.
I would probably right now go with the cheapest lightest solution. And I
already did the brakes so maybe now that the car stops fast I should make
it go fast.

Thanks to all who responded with tire suggestions for my 914.
I ended up getting a set of Yokohama AVS Intermediates as they
were only slightly more expensive than the Dunlop D60M2's that I had
been considering.  Ordered them from The Tire Rack on Monday around
2PM central time.  The guy says they should arrive in 2 - 4 days.
I'm thinking "Yeah, right.  A couple of days to process the order, a few
more days bouncing around on a UPS truck -- they'll arrive sometime
next week."  Well, they were waiting for me when I got home yesterday
(Wednesday).  Now that's FAST service!!

I noticed that each tire has a small red mark on the sidewall.  I had heard
that tires come marked to indicate which point is lightest (heaviest?), but
never really believed it.  I mean, it's got to be balanced on the rim anyway,
right?  Maybe the story is true after all?

BTW, I chickened out on trying to fit the 195's and ended up getting 185/65R15's.
The 185's look much wider and has much squarer shoulders than my old
Roadhandlers.  I'm sure I will be very pleased with them.  Thanks again.

Hi there,

	I thought I understood this, but maybe not.  A long time ago
I made the mistake of telling somebody (on porschphiles) that the different
911's were:

	didn't mention pre-'78 911s
	'78-'83 were the SCs.  3.0 liter
	'84-'88 were the Carreras.  3.2 liter
	'89-current were the Carrera 2's and 4's (this was before the 993)

I was informed that the '89 was still a Carrera and had a 3.2 liter engine
while the C4 had the 3.6 liter engine.  However, I never asked about the
body style.  Does the '89 Carerra (3.2 liter) have the body of the previous
Carrera's or does it share the body style of the 964?  The reason I am asking
is the in an advertisement in Automobile magazine (December 1994) on page
157, Prestige Imports shows an '89 Porsche 911 Cabriolet.  It has the 964
style body, though.  Is this a mistake or do the '89s all have 964 body
styles?

You can get a lot of power out of a 2.4, in fact, you can get as much
out of a 2.4 as the bone stock US spec 3.0. Go look up the HP for the
various 911s sometime -- the '72-3 911S made more power than any non-turbo
911 until the '81 Euro 911SC.

I'd vote for the 2.4E-on-a-2.0 case plan. If you pick a '68 or earlier
case number, it's technically a '68 engine and free as far as emissions
go.

Series II XKE. V-12. Roadster. Of course. 8{) But what I really
want is an XK-140 in decent shape... One of these days....

Yes and no. That only applies if you get it right. I did a ground-up
body-off-pan resto on my wife's '73 Beetle that she bought new in '73
after it suffered some serious heavy collision damage. It was worse than
some of the rusted out 356s I've worked on. Was it worth it? I think
so. Still, what I have is a perfect $7000 car with $22000 in it. On the
other hand, when I helped a friend do his 300 SL gullwing, the labor
was the same (we did spend a *BIT* more time getting the plating right)
but the parts cost was probably at least an 15 times higher. Is his car
"worth it"?? I *really* don't know -- the collector market flattened
out so the cash value is low relative to the net investment, but he has
a DAMN nice car...

And, you might get it wrong... A not-quite-up-to-speed resto on a fairly 
common car ('63 VW for instance) won't hurt the value of the car; on the 
other hand, butchering (the offical Dead Car Society term for not quite 
getting it right) say a Carrera GS or an 550RSK or an XK-SS even could have 
quite a different turn: not only will you not learn anything from the 
experience, but you'll have spent a lot of money to reduce the value of 
the car you love...

Turning out a less than spectacular S-90 Cab isn't *QUITE* in that league,
but it's close. I certainly feel that if you've never done a resto, that
you should start with something easy. If you've done *ANY*, then you probably
know enough to do the research on what to do for an early Porsche.

I *ONLY* do restos these days either for paying customers, or on cars
I personally want to keep for a long, long time.

Deaf? Who? Me? Naah,...I can hear a squirrel fahrt from across the Valley! 
(Remember Norway *IS* a little land... ;^)

The real reason I feel asleep was the saturday night party, I was signed up 
as an assistant to our local newspaper sport journalist, a friend of mine, 
and this just to get in for free, lookaround in the pits and generally have 
all them PRESS benefits.
A *HUGE* outdoor party with zillions bottle of Beer, Vodka and 'Moonshine'. 

The only *real* nice happening that weekend was something that occured when 
tracelling to the dragraces Friday evening. We picked up some girls with a 
broken up car along the road, and got invited to a party. They served us 
real nice, food a beer and...... (NO, not *That*!) but a couple of hours rest.

The funny part was when my pal, we were actually 3 that went down there, 
started hitting on some of the girls(YES,...*some* of them!). He being a 
rather serious 'Don Juan' we soon started to think that we might not reach 
the Motel at Mantorp Park (yes guys, that is in Sweden) in time.

Sometimes a man has to do things he are not proud over, but the life of a 
man is intricate. The other guy and I, merged with the people at the party 
and , secretely to our friend, informed them to be careful around him. We 
actually told all the girls that he was a rapist out on parole and that they 
shouldn't be alone in a room with him, and all the boys that he was a 
homosexual.
(Please note: I am not single minded, and try to accept people as they are!!)
After that statement I go on with the story; What seem to be a long night in 
Karlstad,(between Halden, Norway and Mantorp in Sweden) reached an 
anticlimax for our friend, and 20 minutes later he suggested we should get 
in the car and head for the Motel. 

cheers,
Trond

Nice car, but personally I prefer the XK120. I think the 140 & 150 series 
are inbetweens,...but thats *my* opinion. I take it for granted you want a 
roadster, the FHC's look to strange.

>Turning out a less than spectacular S-90 Cab isn't *QUITE* in that league,

I agree with Stan, open cars are woth almost double to coupe's and they need 
to be 100% to justify top prices.

But don't let your own skills stop you from putting that 'non-restorable' 
old car back on the road! Even if your first restoration might only be 
'good', your next will be better and so on. 
The importance of pre restoration research is tremendous, reading a few 
books and familiarizing with the car one have/want to restore and having 
faith in oneselfs abilities will do 'half the job'.(The other half is the 
tools.... ;-)

AHH, this is interesting as I'm in the same situation, i.e., a restoration
"virgin" trying to decide on my first project car. My '85 Carrera is in
great shape, and rarely needs work. So, I need to get my shopwork "fix"
somewhere else. Guess I should clarify restoration- I'm talking about a
"street" restoration, not a "100 points" car. I would like to rebuild the
engine and mechanicals as a learning experience.

I'd be interested in any other opinions/experiences for first cars. I agree
with Stan that a non-Porsche should be a first car. I'd love to start on
a 356 or early 911, but parts are not cheap and any mistakes I make will
be quite costly.

Here's my admittedly eclectic list of cars I am thinking about. I hope to
do research over the next few months and start early next year. I've got
quite a few British cars in it. (H'mm do I really want to battle the Prince
of Darkness? There is a ton of literature/how-to stuff on them though.)

VW bug (convertible)   Simple, parts available, timeless
Triumph TR6            Nice lines, strong engine
Triumph TR7            Modern convenience, weird sides, sort of the 928
                       of TR's (no offense 928'ers, I like 928's too)
TVR                    Not that common, but parts (Ford) pretty available.
                       I DO like the way they look.
MGB                    An obvious choice, but I just can't get excited about
                       them.
Jaguar                 XK's too pricey for me. Early XJ6's look interesting,
                       prices certainly cheap, how easy are repairs?
BMW 3.0                Again, probably not cheap/simple.
Alfa GTA               Nice engine, interesing lines. Somewhat practical.
Lotus Elan, Europa     Nice lines and handling. $$?
Toyota MR2             Yikes, from the Orient! They do handle well though.
Datsun 240Z            A milestone. Always liked the original.

Yeah, I know this is quite a range of very different cars -- I should figure
out what I REALLY want to do with the car when it is done. I'm still working
on that. This exercise will help me work to that end.

P.S. Anyone going to the Hilton Head Island Classic Concours on Nov 4-6?
I hope to go. Supposed to have about 150 cars there. The Jaguars class will
have a national points competition.

Thanks folks.

Subject: fi_pump_mech

I have a factory supplement to the 911 repair manual for the mechanical 
injection system.  The pump repair however is not covered.  This pump is 
similar to the pumps used on MB's both gas and diesel.  Try a 280se.  
Some diesel pump rebuilders have a test bench that will accommodate a 
Bosch pump.  Locally a nationally known rebuilder has slipped at least 
one 72 911T pump through there.  

Porsche had many sub-versions of this pump.  Too rich?  There are several 
adjustments on the outside of this pump that can be made.  One screw 
however, is accessed through the cooling fan with a long handeled 
recessed allen head wrench.  Look for it!

I have had the pump on my 70E rebuilt by Pacific Fuel Injection.

Good luck

I have the solenoid installed but disconnected, both big adjustment screws

Subject: 911 interest

Last week, while in Los Vegas at a confernece I rented a 93 911 C2 (250.00 
w/ milage etc. and confirmed what I always suspected -- there is only ONE
real sports car (actually I have know this since I was six).

I currently have a 90 Miata - great car - really but no comparison.
So how do I go about finding a 911. Budget 25,000.
What can I expect in terms of maintainance expense, downtime, is there
really 13 quarts of oil in a 911? what years do I avoid? Should I consider 88-90
 - this is what 25000 will buy? What do I look for? what are the weak - problem
areas? should high milage on a well cared for car be a concern? how many
miles before a major engine rebuild? I am not int[C the LUXO - leather  
electric headrest/ windows/ mirrors, prefer simple, lightweight, no-frill
fast car.  

I ordered "Porsche 911 - Guide to purchase and restoration" ( have not received)
are there other good books/ ways of researching this information

While I've spent the last three years on my p-car doing the
restoration of the body/suspension...my Brother has been restoring
a '61 VW Beetle.  From JC Whitney's in Chicago, I bought NEW non-OEM
Fenders for $49 ea!!!!!!  Unbelievable, the parts costs are simply
trivial compared to a Porsche.  I'd recommend you start with VWs
and move to a Porsche of you choice later, yes VWs are much easier
to restore.  I worked/restored several beetles and a karman ghia
before starting on my 912 and it was a great set of learning experiences.
It will also get you used to thinking in terms of "air cooled" instead
of water-cooled stuff.


Good Luck!!

Does anybody know the output voltage characteristics for the intake air temp

	I think it's time for a reality check. Are you saying you can't
afford a good 4 for your 914 so you are going for a 6 instead ? The cost
build a good 6 is astronomical compared to a 4. Plus you get to put a
lot on work into the conversion. If you are looking at something like
a 3.0SC motor, then your work increases by another big chunk, 'cuz you're
going to have to do a lot of mods to take the extra torque and still
have a somewhat reliable car. 

a *very* rough budget.

a decent flat 6    $7,000-$15000
conversion of your car from 4->6  $3000-$5000 
Mods to take extra power (trans, CV, half shafts, chassis, swing arms, brakes...) $3000-$5000

so a rough minimum to do this right would be about $13K with $25K easily possible.

I'd recommend you start with a VW Bus.  It builds character, AND you'll 
have a vehicle to take surfing and to shows to pick up those expensive
Porsche parts in.

The earlier the bus you restore, the more acclimated to paying $$$ for parts -
like the $200 I spent for taillights for my bus, or the $200 or so I'm going
to pay for the engine lid, and then $100 for the brake light....

With the current Drag Racing thread, the following comes to mind.

You don't just strap a jet or rocket to your butt and go to the drag 
strip on roller skates. When I was in college 30 years ago, a fellow
named Romeo Palamedes came to me about doing some work to keep his 
jet powered dragster from reaching rotational speed and flying. I had
just built a small wind tunnel, so the request was possible. I asked him 
what the problem was, he said " I had a driver get killed." He wasn't 
smiling. Seems he had a J79 out of an F-104 to play with. He had
been using a low-power J-45 in the wrecked car.

I was able to get him a body which didn't fly, but they had brake problems
after that. Seems they could hit 275 MPH in the 1/4 mile.

There was a fellow named Al Cadrobbi in Van Nuys that raced a Carrera 
4-cam at the drags. Use to be very fast. I don't remember what he used for 
fuel but my eyes watered after he went by. Hydrazine?

Subject: Re: Restoring VW or P-Car?

Thom Fitzpatrick (another with dual membership: Pphiles and Vanagon list) 
recommends a VW bus as a restoration choice.  I don't think medical science
has identified why some people NEED to sit over the front wheels to drive,
but I'm pretty sure that one either has this affliction or doesn't.  Buses
are good driveway projects in that you don't need ramps for a lot of projects.
When you do need ramps, with bus or Vanagon you can put the ramps in FRONT of
the back wheels and drive up.  Try that with a 356.  On the other hand, the
idea of a bus unibody on a rotisserie for a full resto boggles the mind.  And
the impossibility of getting all that metal flat is why there are no black
VW vans.

VWs generally are better training for Porsche work than other cars.  But I
think that if you want to work up to Porsches that need a lot, the place to 
start is a Porsche that doesn't need a lot, rather than a VW that does.

  I'm not an "expert" at this but, it seems to me that if I wanted to spend 
$3500, it would be on a 914.4 to 914.6 conversion. Not withstanding 
suspension and transmission upgrades we just bought a used 2.4 (built to a

accomplished for $3500, but can you make a 2.0 4cyc pump 130-140hp? And if
so is it worth $3500 when an upgrade can't cost too much more?

   Picking a project car is like picking a wife; you better be really
 sure you love it before you get involved....You'll have it for years
 if not for life, it will demand all your time and and you'll spend every
 dollar you make on it. Whether its a blonde or brunette is insignificant,
 if you make the wrong choice your life will be hell, if you make the right
 choice there is nothing like it.

   Another Porschephiler, Tony Eggers, helped a friend restore a '70 Mustang.
 It was his friend's first project car, originally planned to be a daily
 driver. The guy researched the car to death, apprenticed for a year (for 
 free) at a body shop on weekends to learn paint and body, and did every inch
 of the work (including the rebuild of the Automatic tranny) himself. $30,000
 and years later, the car made the cover of Mustang and Fords magazine and 
 wins Trailered Concours class at the National level.  That car has got to be
 the exception, though; most guys I know with project cars have them
 undriveable after 5-10 years, and have lost money, time and hope...

   Be honest about why you are doing the restoration, spend 6 months
 researching before you buy any car. Buy every book about the car you can
 find and read it first. But above all, be realistic about your abilities,
 your time, your expectations and your checkbook.

   The kind of work that restores a 100-point Impala SS is the exact same work
 that restores a Maserati Mexico. The difference is in resources (parts,
 books, expertise) available. In that regard, a Porsche is a pretty good
 choice and a 911 an excellent choice. You are -going- to lose money on
 whatever you do, just make sure its the kind of entertainment you want !

Subject: Changing struts/Air tools

After last weekend's blast at Bridgehampton (Hi Kevin G.), my 951 has some 
front-end wander. What was very slight play before the event has turned into a
thumpethy-thump from the front-end.  I don't think it's the ball-joint since 
they checked it at tech.   When the front wheels are rocked top-to-bottom, 
there is a slight play and I can feel movement in the strut.  I had changed 
and adjusted the outer bearings but not the inners.  Is this a sign of bad 
struts or inner bearings?  I have the original factory Konis.   If nec., I'll 
be changing struts/shocks on both cars (the daily-driver Audi also needs 
struts/shocks with 113k miles) and since I will have the springs out, 
replacing with stiffer springs and lowering the cars.  I'm looking at Koni 
adj./Eibach springs.

I'm also considering investing in air tools.  Of course, I still have to sell 
my loan officer (aka spousal unit) on the idea.  For home use, i.e. changing 
struts/shocks and an occasional clutch or three, what size air compressor is 
sufficient?  Brand names? Will they handle those tough 400 lb. ft. axle hubs? 
 Can you preset torque on an air-ratchet or is that a 'special' tool?

Other than spring compressors and large channel-locs, any other special tools 
needed for struts?

TIA,

According to the 944 Service Manual, page 28-28,

"Check temperature sensor I (intake air temperature). Turn off ignition and
pull off plug on air flow sensor. Connect ohmmeter between terminal 6 and 22
on air flow sensor (both outer flat male plugs).

Note:
Interruption on tenperature sensor causes richer mixture.
Short on temperature sensor causes leaner mixture."

Haltech makes an OK unit for competition, but it mostly sucks for combination
street and competition  use. It's also not nearly as programmable as some
of the other units available. Beware the Electromotive unit unless you
have a common intake plenum!

You also still have to provide the various instrumentation, intakes,
and throttle bodies. I know that Gene Berg has that based on Weber IDX
carb bodies if this is for a 914 or 356. There are places that do the
same for Weber sidedraft carbs for the 924/44s. Total to add custom 
programmable EFI to a 4-cylinder is about $3k. Total to add custom 
programmable EFI to a 911 is more like $8500-10k

Just and FYI, from someone that used to make a lot of money setting these
things up for IMSA cars...

Subject: Restoring a Porsche (maybe)

 
Hi, Chris.
 
Go for it. I took a body and fender class at the local community college
too, because I didn't like what I saw at the professional shops and figured
I could do better. Turns out I can, it just takes waaaaaay longer. The class
lasted 2 years, about 3-4 hours a day, 4 days a week.
 
The 356 and VW Beetle are very similar in many ways, certainly mechanically.
The Beetle body is built differently; the body is removable, as are the
fenders. On the Porsche, all that is welded to the "inner body" so if it's
bad you have to undent it, or cut it out and patch it, or replace entire
sections like the front or rear "caps" (known as "clips" in the trade), etc.
A VW body can be lifted off the frame to do a top-notch restoration; the
Porsche body can be stripped, but you still have a shell that is pretty much
complete.
 
Mechanically, 356s are fairly easy to work on. Most service parts are
reasonably priced, but certainly more expensive than VW (and no, there aren't
many parts that interchange between the two, so forget that right off) but
almost everything seems to be available. When not dealing with service
parts and normal wear items, things can get expensive, so be sure the car
you buy for restoration is at least complete. For example, it's cheaper and
easier to rechrome straight but pitted bumper guards than it is to buy four
reproductions, with questionable fit and high prices.
 
If you do a 356 (or any car) don't fool around with aftermarket manuals, get
the factory manuals and parts catalog. They tell you everything you need to
know. Get the leading parts suppliers catalogs to see what you're getting
into (for 356, that's Stoddard, NLA Ltd., Tweeks to see what's available but
not to buy, a few others).
 
As a first project, I would recommend the 356 over the 911; it's a much
simpler car. Look around for a while (several months is not out of line),
look at and UNDER lots of cars, form an impression of what cars are really
bad and what cars are in pretty good shape, be prepared to let what you
think are good cars go until you have more experience, then when you feel
confident you can recognize a good car when you see it, and the price is
right, go for it. Buy the best basis for restoration you can afford; a
basket case may be cheap but you'll probably never finish it. A good
drivable car with a few cosmetic problems may be best.
 
Good luck.

As I understand it, Henry ford specified the exact dimensions and construction
of the wooden crates which were used to ship (some unknown) parts in.  Being
the innovative and wiley entrepreneur he was, he arranged those dimensions
and construction methods to allow easy disassembly, and instant use of the wood
for floor boards with no manufacturing on his end.  Sort of outsourcing before
its time :-)

I have no proof of this, but it is common folklore...

| I'm also considering investing in air tools.  Of course, I still have 
to sell
| my loan officer (aka spousal unit) on the idea.  For home use, i.e. changing
| struts/shocks and an occasional clutch or three, what size air compressor is
| sufficient?  Brand names? Will they handle those tough 400 lb. ft. 
axle hubs?
|  Can you preset torque on an air-ratchet or is that a 'special' tool?

An air ratchet is not an impact wrench. Two different beasts. An air
ratchet is similar to a standard ratchet except you can use the air
to spin the socket to the point where the nut/bolt is snug. You then
use hand power to rotate the handle of the air ratchet exactly as
you would a hand ratchet and vice versa for loosening. Actually,
I don't use the air ratchet for final tightening; this is where one
employs a torque wrench.

You can use an impact wrench to loosen the really tight nuts/bolts,
like lug nuts and axle nuts. However, the bargain counter impact
wrenches only go up to 250 or so ft/lbs. To get a 400 ft/lb wrench,
you are looking at $150 or thereabouts. They do have adjustments
for torque output, but those are not accurate, although it would
probably be good enough for the axle nut.

That said, I don't have an impact wrench. I just use a breaker
bar and, if necessary, a pipe cheater. To spin the nuts on/off,
I use either the air ratchet or a cordless electric drill with a 3/8
square drive adapter. The bigger of my two torque wrenches
goes up to 100 ft/lbs, so I use that for the final tightening of my
lug nuts. For the axle nut, I use my 3/4 inch breaker bar with my
trusty 3 foot long cheater pipe. I weigh 180 lbs, so if I apply all
of my weight about 2.5 feet out, that's roughly 400 ft/lbs. Voila!

BTW, my compressor uses a 2 HP, 1800 RPM motor running
on 220. I built it myself using a Dayton motor, Sears 2 cylinder
pump, and a 10 gallon roll around tank I bought from an
industrial supply (I forget the brand, I could look it up if needed).
I don't think this is the way to go if you are looking to save
money (its a long story why I did it this way). You can probably
get a good deal on a compressor from one of those warehouse
hardware supply stores (Eagle, Home Base, etc).

If you do get an air compressor, don't forget to get the most
valuable accessory: an air nozzle for blowing things off.

Subject: Rocket-propelled machine

 
Jim Pasha mentions Romeo Palamides and his rocket cars.
 
Palamides is one of the early big names from drag racing history. The book
"High Performance" mentions his rocket car experiments:
 
"Bob Smith of San Jose, who took over the controls for Palamides after
Liederbrand went to work for Garlits, sustained only cuts and a few broken
bones when Untouchable 2 crashed off the end of a strip at Union Grove,
Wisconsin, but later he suffered extensive injuries when Untouchable 4's
parachutes failed at Milan, Michigan. It was not an edifying story.
Palamides, sure Smith would die, 'grabbed all the appearance money and took
off for California,' then filed for bankruptcy. Smith spend three years
recuperating, but he did survive. Later there were fatalities involving jet
machines built not only by Palamides but also by Fredrick and both the
Arfons brothers as well."

I've seen some references on this list regarding the use of

at the mounting points? Also, has anyone replaced the stock
brake proportioning valve with an adjustable unit? If so, which
one did you use, how'd it work, and where was the best source

Subject: Air Tools

        If you're going to buy a compressor, IMHO don't buy something too small
since over as time you will get used to air tools, you'll buy more and more
and you'll will need more air.

        I had a so -called "fake 5" ie -a 5 hp , 60 gal 220v, @3250 rpm.
Was fine at the beginning but after more and more projects, I began to cook
it.CFM was around 5-6CFM.

        Just bought a Curtis upright - 5hp, 80gal, 220v 850rpm, 2 stage.
CFM is 18-20CFM. If you have the budget - get a 2 stage, something in this
class.

I run for example;
3/8,1/2 impacts,3/8,1/4 rachets ( life savers!),DA's,Airfiles,Killers,
Sandblaster,flangers,cutoffs,HVLP spray guns, you name it. And all I
started with was a blow gun. Air is totally infectious and the greatest
thing for your home shop. Especially cool are the dustless DA's and
sanders..

The whole heart of your system of course will be the compressor. Prices new:
5 hp, single stage, 220v, 3250 rpm ~5cfm ~$350-500.00
5 hp dual stage                    ~7cfm ~$500-800.00
5 Hp, dual                850 rpm ~ 18-20~ 1500.00 - 2500.00

Used - 5 hp single - 250.00 300.00
       Big 5 - 700-900.00 if you can find one..
Remember - next toys are dryers, regulators, reels etc etc $  $ $.

Subject: I'm tired of driving the Honda

As the previous message said I"m experiencing a high pitched whining noise
in my Porsche 944s since finishing the clutch job.  The noise does not vary
in amplitude or frequency whether I have the clutch in or clutch out, reve
the engine...put it in neutral or a gear...drive it or not.  Any clues???

Oh, btw, the car does drive perfectly (although all I've driven it on is
short test run or two).  

One of the things I had to pull out when replacing the clutch was the
starter.  Well, turns out the starter needed rebuilding....so I put a nice
rebuilt starter in there.  It starts the car just fine.  However, it is
heating up rapidly AFTER the car is started and the starter is off (3-4
seconds time frame).  Could I have made some kind of dumb wiring mistake???
I don't think so but I'm totally lost right now.  

Thanks for any help

Hey,

I had the unique opportunity to spectate at a Corvette club auto-
cross here in Hunstville today.  Pretty interesting.  Here are some
observations:

1.  Corvettes are much quieter than Porsches.
2.  Even though this was a "timed" event, these folks didn't seem
     to be pushing their cars very hard (with a few exceptions).
3.  Alot of mechanical failures/problems with the cars.  The course
     even had to be altered due to the fantastic amount of oil laid down
    when one guy's engine let go.  There was another car parked with a
    *large* pool of coolant under it.  I could go on.
4.  Alot of the guys were overweight.  Sorry - couldn't resist.

Too bad I was in my 4Runner instead of the 911.  I actually think I 
could have held my own;-).

Have a good weekend!!

Folks,

As of yesterday, when Alan Friedman spoke to our region, the Corpus
Christi race was in January.  I didn't take a copy of the schedule and
so do not have the date.  So, like, is it a good track?  Worth the
commute from New England?

Also, the conflict on May 5-6 will, he hopes, be resolved.

There are apparently a total of 20 races scheduled or semi-scheduled

Hi, Peter,

Yep, much too quickly.  Look more closely at the water pump. Also, if you
can pressurize the cooling system (your mechanic may have a gizmo to do
this) and can leave it pressurized for a while, you may be able to figure
out where the coolant is going.  (Head gasket or oil cooler may be a
possibility...does your oil have a light chocolate brown consistency?)

Your radiator may be leaking, or any of the hoses.

Water pump replacement does require timing belt removal, inasmuch it is
driven by the timing belt.  Since you have a later model car, with the belt
tensioner builtin, you should be able to do it yourself, but make sure that
you have the factory shop manual before you attempt it, otherwise you may
hurt your motor by mistiming.

Good luck,

Mine was leaking until I had it fixed. The leak was at the seam where the 
plastic tank is clamped onto the aluminum core. I brought the rad in and 
the shop fixed it by simply clamping it tighter with pliers. Another 
possible source of leak is at the fitting under the top rad hose where a 
small hose is attached. This fitting simply a plastic nozzle screwed onto 
the rad tank and could be loose. For mine, I wrapped it with Teflon tape 
and made sure it was tight. Both these leaks were difficult to detect, 
the only evidence being one drop of coolant on a bolt holding the lower 
engine cover. Removing the rad is easy; raise the front of the car so you 
can crawl under. Then drop the fan assembly followed by the rad.
 
As for the water pump, I've read you have to remove ALL the belts, 
pulleys. idlers etc. just so you can remove the rear belt cover which 
blocks access to the water pump. Not a trivial task as is with many other 
cars. This is definitely one area where Porsche screwed up. In fact, I'm 
beginning to think this, and the need for P9201 gauge for changing belts 
was designed to discourage owner service (I was quoted $700 cdn for P9201 at 
the dealer!).

Subject: MY ' 86 951 fuel leak

After filling up recently I noticed a strong fuel smell and assummed
that the attendant had "topped it off"(ie; spilled gas all over the car).
When I still noticed the smell the next day I checked under the hood
and found gas dribbling out of the supply line where it goes into the
pressure regulator(is that right?).
   After determining that it was coming out of the hose(possibly crimp
connection) and not just a loose fitting, I ordered part #951.356.919.03 fuel
line.  This is a rubber hose with a heat shield jacket and crimp connections
to a solid tubing with an inline connector that apparently connects to
another solid line somewhere
behind the right front wheel well.  The hitch is that my existing line
goes all the way back to the rear of the car where it connects to the
fuel filter. No inline connector anywhere  Do I need to replace that whole
line from the hose that comes out of the fuel filter and runs forward?  Is
this an update/modification?  Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, Clint,

According to the microfiche, the original part number for that hose is 
951.356.919.02, which was superseded to the .03 part.  So, it seems that 
Porsche decided to add a connector to make life easier for them.

Looks like you might have to order a couple more parts:

477.209.169 Connecting Piece
951.356.967.02 Fuel Line

The Fuel Line shows as connecting to the fuel filter.

Subject: 911/2 Strut Cartridge Replacement

Just a quick question for the strut experienced:

Okay, I'm replacing my strut cartridge inserts in my '66 912.  I
removed the old ones this weekend and a few tablespoons of what
looks like hydrolic oil came dripping out.  I read in the factory
manual that I should expect this - ok.  

BUT, I took out the old Konis and they look like the top isnt
sealed and that oil would go in/out of them?  Now, I bought Boges to
replace them and they look to be 100% sealed.  The factory manual 
says to drain the old oil out, but, doesnt say anything about putting
new oil back in.  The Boge instructions say to put oil in if the
manufacturer says to.

The factory manual doesnt say anything about putting oil in or what
kind or how much.

So..... what to do?  My current thinking is that since the Boges appear
to be completely sealed, I'm not gonna put any oil in there.  I would
appreciate anybody's help on this who's already been through this.

Thanks!

Not likely - the frequency would change as the engine was rev'd. But the
fact that the starter is getting hot sure sounds like it is continuing to
run after the engine starts. That would certainly make a constant noise.
Put a voltmeter on the starter leads (assuming they are accessible) and
find out whether there is any voltage there when the engine is running.
Seems obvious, but why else would the starter be getting hot?

I have an 86 300E with 115k miles and I am considering replacing the shocks
and springs. I would like to make the ride more BMW like. I like the
compromise the current 5 series has struck for a sedan with pretty good
handling and ride. That's the key, I don't want to ruin the ride since I
live on the east coast (read bad roads). I also won't mind lower ride hight
since the 86 came to the US looking like an RV. The car was much lower in
later years. I'm looking for any experience with after market setups
(Bilstein HDs, Eibachs,etc.) or with the factory sport kit.

Thanks in advance and apologies if this is out of line.

Subject: 356 calipers, etc.

- -------
All,

	The exercise is to replace the rear wheel bearings, rebuild the
calipers, and replace the rotors on the rear of a '65 356.  Well,
the axle nuts came off without great trouble.  They were tight, but
certainly didn't take 400 ft/lbs.  I got down to the wheel bearings
and discovered the need for the special puller.  I'll be looking for one to 
rent or buy tomorrow (suggestions?).  anyway, on the the primary subject.

	I can't get the pistons out of the caliper.  I've tried shop air
(about 100 psi), and rotating them with pliers.  No dice. 
Initially, I pushed them in a little to get the pads out, and remove 
the caliper.  That was OK.  Removed the dust boots, which were essentially
shot, and loose.  There is some surface rust under the boots, including the 
small portion of the bore visible when the piston is compressed.  Anyway,
The air would push the pistons out to a point (roughly the operating point
for worn pads) and I could push them back with pliers.  Getting nowhere, I
tried pushing the pistons all the way in (C-clamp).Now the shop air won't
push them back out at all.  They seemed to move smoothly, so I don't think
they are cocked in the bore.  Is this what is meant by "frozen calipers"?

	Any suggestions on getting the pistons out?  Should I give up and
pay to have them rebuilt?  At this point, I COULD put it back
together and drive it somewhere.  How about hooking it back up to
the hydraulic system and punching them out with the brake pedal?  I
expect I might get one out that way, but not both.  

	Suggestions and experience apprecieated.

Well, there was this technological revolution about a decade or two back
resulting in gas pressurized shocks and strut inserts. In the Old Days,
shocks were no only rebuildable, but you could vary the damping by
changing the oil in them to something stiffer or lighter as your tastes
dictated -- sort of like motorcycle forks still are. But these days,
almost everything is sealed. So clean out the strut housings, install
the new inserts, and go play. You don't need to add other oil.

Are you sure you didn't used to own a NSX?? 8{) Please don't take this as
a personal attack; it's directed at everyone out there that complains about
this and you're just the first person in a while to say anything.

Tires are made of rubber. You have two choices: hard rubber for long
life, and soft sticky rubber for better performance. There is no such
thing as hard rubber that gives good performance. There is no such thing
as sticky rubber that doesn't wear rapidly.

OK: you spent *HOW MUCH* on the car, to get a *HIGH* performance vehicle, 
and now you're concerned about tire life??? The tires are a very important 
part of the overall performance of the car. If you change over to oh, let's 
say Kelly or General or Atlas or Western Auto store brand, sure, you'll can
get a 40,000 or even a 60,000 mile tire, but at the expense of not
*EVER* being able to drive the car it was meant to be driven.

Suck it up, and buy new tires. The right stuff -- Yokos or other sticky
tires. Sure, it's $150 a tire, but that's what percentage of the total
car??? And you got what, nearly 3 years? I went through a set of rear
tires on my 911 every 14 months, like clockwork.

I'm sorry, but this is BIG issue for me.... I got religion about this
when I started bitching about how much motorcycle tires cost, and a
friend said "do the math". He further explained that I should figure out
how big my contact patch was, and think about what my life was worth,
and did I really want the cheapest tires or the BEST tires I could find.

It's a little different putting tires on a P-car, but not much: what do you
value about the car? If the words "handling" or "performance" even *ENTER YOUR
MIND* when you answer that, think about it. Hard. Do you want to do something
to change that for the worse? Or should you just have bought a sedan to begin
with?

You need the special VW tool. You *MIGHT* be able to rent one from a 
shop that specialized in aircooled VWs. Failing that, it's made by
Baum, or you can get it at the dealer...

Oooooo. It's deja vu all over again... I *BROKE* two of mine getting them
out. Eventually, after spraying liberally with ZEP-45, I grabbed the little 
lip with ViseGrips, and pulled like a son-of-a-gun, finally getting just enough 
out to grab the main piston body (barely!) in the bench vise, where I was 
then able to put one foot on the bench, pull like hell, twist a lot, and 
eventually get it to pop out. It was toast anyway, so I didn't worry about 
further damage. The bore was fine, and I have NO IDEA why it was stuck.

Of the four rear pistons, only ONE came out OK. I broke two, which meant
replacing them ($37 each at Stoddard) and was able to save the other one.
Worst brake rebuild nightmare I've ever had...

Good luck. Sometime I need to get around to writing up how I went from
just changing pads to only have one metal line from the original brake
system left with all else replaced or rebuilt in only three easy weeks...

For normal shocks, you are correct. However, the Konis are gas pressurized

The coolant looks normal, no oil in the water. I ran it for a while today 
and looked all around underneath and on top and saw nothing abnormal. One of 
those pressure testers sounds like a good idea.

I did discover that my power steering fluid is coming out of the hoses at 
the bottom of the reservoir. It looks like the clamps are the wrong size to 
properly hold the hoses. I replaced one with a clamp I had around and will 
get another tomorrow. Everyone should check this out on their car because 
the fluid has spread about and probably will damage the rubber in bushings

I'm a newbie, so don't flame too hard if this has been covered before...

I've got a one-owner, high-mileage 1974 1.8 liter 914 in need of engine
work - it still runs, but with 189,000+ on it, well...

Question of the moment is this:  Does anybody out there have experience
with the hydraulic lifter cam set up sold by Performance Products?
I want the car as a street only machine - no competition.  The idea of
hydraulic lifters appeals to me, since it should lessen the need for 
valve adjustments.  Yeah, I know it's a privilege to crawl under there
every 3,000 miles, and all that; but at my age & with kids, I'm also
a realist, and know it ain't gonna get done...

So, how 'bout it folks?  Anybody running one of these setups?

BTW, thanks for the comments on the big bore kits - I'd been debating

not ultimate performance out of this car.

  I agree with Stan's advice on learning how to restore cars with a Bug
instead of a Porsche.  While the two seemed to be similar at first glance,
(Hold the flame throwers, I meant only a *slight* similarity) the cost of 
a screw-up is much easier to live with.  

  On the other hand, even after I have brought 2 different bug back to life 
and drag raced them back to their graves, I must admit that I was still 
unprepared for the BIG different in part prices between the bugs and the 
'74 914 2.0 that I'm currently working on.  Especially in the engine category.  

  $800 worth of valves/valves guides/welding on the 2.0 heads could've
bought a NEW pair of machined/full race/ready to run heads for a TYPE I.
Why does it appeared that no one is offering reasonably priced high 
performance aftermarket parts for Porsches?  For the price of freshening up 
a 2.0 914 engine, I could've bought, out right, a race ready TYPE I.  Now if 
I can shoehorn that TYPE I into the 914... (just kidding).

  Enough whining for now, back to the current project:

  Now that the 914 is almost ready to go again, can anyone suggest a
decent set up for a 914 that is mostly driven on the street?  I was told
to keep the front sway bar, get rd of the rear bar and change the tie rods 
to the 930 type.  Is this a good starting point?  Any recommended alignment
settings?  Please bear with me since the Bugs I used to drive doesn't need 
to turn corners very well. :-) The suspension on the 914 is currently stock
except for the KYBs that I bought the car with. 

  While I'm at it, anyone know of alignment shops in the San Diego area

22" logs hold the roof up at about 13' off the ground.  Our napkin 
calculations indicated this could combined with a few hoists for an 
exciting Saturday.

Actually I have been struggling with this exact question since I got the 
914.  The van is a part of my family history.  When I was a kid, my folks 
bought the thing new and we drove around in the thing across the US and 
Canada a few times.  It was also my mom's station wagon.  It was my 
travelling companion for my own jouney across the states and my sailboard 
hangar.   Now it sits and rusts while I consider what to do with the new 
little toy, mild rust, but nothing like impending doom.  

My conclusion is to try to sell the rusty runt and buy another that is in 
better condition, and spend my time on the van.  I think this would 
reduce the stress while welding and grinding.   The only excuse I can 
come up with is the van actually  actually deservs a bit of restoration, 
while the 914 hasn't earned it's stripes yet!!!!  Yes, a bit twisted.  Oh 
well.

Rich,

I have a '78 911SC with an '88 3.2 in it.  I was looking at building a
very fast autocross car (which it turned out to be) so I was looking for
all the horsepower I could find and still be somewhat street legal.  What
I mean by that is changes that I could undo in a day or so are okay, any-
thing else would have to wait for a dedicated car.

Anyway, the options I came up with included equal length headers, less
restrictive mufflers, mass flow sensor systems, and after-market chips.

After talking with a lot of people, especially those with no financial
interests in what I was doing, it became apparent that the mass flow
system from Autothority was not worth the dollars. Jerry Woods felt
that it was a waste of money (maybe a 5 HP gain). My engine guy said
the best thing to do is to go with equal length headers, a less
restrictive muffler system, and use an after market chip.

Autothority claims a 19% gain in power. Do you really believe and engine
can gain 40 HP by changing just the intake side of the equation? I don't!
The way to get a 3.2 to perform better (without spending a fortune or
changing all kinds of hardware) is make it breathe better. The intake side
is fairly adequate, the exhaust is the problem.

I went with 911SC RS style equal length headers with a '74 style dual
inlet, single outlet muffler and a Jerry Woods chip. I figure to have
in the area of 240 HP. This about all you can expect out of a 3.2 with
out changing the fuel injection, cams, pistons, cylinders, etc.

Hope this helps...

Bob,

Try a 'Grease-Press'(Dunno if thats what you call it...). Make an adapter, 
and connect it to the caliper. Grease presses can make an awfullly high 
pressure.

Another idea is to carefully heat the caliper, then try with air or Grease 
press. 
In a last attempt you could use 'shrink' spray (BRRR,...I'm freezing just on 
the tought..;-) on the pistons while the calipers are heated.

Hiall,

If you're among the the Porsche owners that use their car as it is intended 
too be used, buy Sport tires.(If there is such a thing...)
 
But on the other side I believe there are a lot of Porsche owners that 
doesn't care about what *Porsche* intended the car to be, they are merely 
interested in what *they* have intended for the car.
 
Anyone that need an A to B vehicle and think that a Porsche would be nice, 
doesn't neccessarily have the lust/need to push their car against any limits.
Why should you use Yoko's, Dunlop D40(?) or some other sport tire if you're 
mostly doin' 55 on your way to work?

My advice would be; choose your tires according to your drivestyle.

Trond.

The tensioner is not needed for the timing belt on your 88 944. In 1987,
Porsche added a spring-loaded tensioner, designed to set the tension
properly at installation, and then be locked in place (keep in mind that it
is not a self-adjuster, but setting the initial tension only).

However, the tension on the balance shaft belt and on the alternator belt
must (read should) be set with the expensive tool, P9201.  

The way I figure it, your car is worth about $10K-$15K.  Buying a tool that
costs $350-400 that saves you a couple of hundred dollars every 15K miles
will pay for itself in a couple of years.  Do the math.

After all, you do own a Porsche!

Subject: Re: 968 Tires,OR; tires for a purpose.

This brings up an interesting point - tires with a warranty.

I recently puchaced a set of Bridgestoine RE92 for my Honda.  I have
never been able to get more than 20K out of a set of tires on this or
any other car due to my cornering technique (scrape the door handles).
These tire came with 3 nice things:

1) The bridgestone Platnum Pacvt -
	30 day no questions asked money back Free hazzard replacement
	NOT prorated for treadwear.  Free flat repair 2) Free
roattion/balancing for the life of the tire 3) 40,000 mile pro-rated
treadwear.

The tires are HR rated and really stick.  At $300/set instralled they
were relatively inexpensive (about $63/tire + mount-bal).

Service is through Firestone.

I'm curious as to the warrantly on the RE940, RE71 and expedia.  I
liked the idea that the Firestome MasterCare Center  had prices within
$4.00 of tire rack (delivered) and I had a persdon to bitch to backed
up by a real dealer network.

The stock 914 proportioning valve is adjustable.  I replaced mine
with an aftermarket unit from Wilwood because I didn't like the
springy feel that the stock valve gave my brakes.  It was a pain
to find the fittings to convert the 1/8 NPT fittings on the Wilwood
valve to the metric brake fittings on the car.  If you do replace
your valve, it might be worth it to try and find one with metric
fittings.  I got mine from a local racing supply shop.  Apparently,
Kelsey-Hayes units are available from a GM/Ford/Chrysler
dealer, but I didn't check into this.  That might be a source for
one with metric fittings.

With the new valve, my brake pedal is *much* harder.  However,
even with full rear bias, I'm not sure I can lock my rear brakes,
so I think I need to rebuild my rear calipers.

Hi Richard,

GT-350 would be cool.  My nephew, not a skilled mechanic (at the start 
anyway) did a teriffic job on a 64.4 Mustang convertible, so creating a 
GT-350 should be very do-able.

I wouldn't rule out a corvette so quickly though (other than the '63 split-
window - real bodies are so rare now) OTOH, the '65-'67s are relatively
cheap and pleantiful, plus they have disk brakes all around (some '65s
did have the disk-break delete option, and have drums, but not many)

A roadster would make a great choice, but any corvette would have the same 
dual advantage/disadvantage:  the 'glass body doesn't dent or rust, so you 
miss the exercise of metal body repairs (a significant component of any metal
bodied restoration)  This would *Significantly* reduce the cost of the 
restoration.  Other benefits include the relatively bullet-proof drive
train and running gear of those years, and the ease of using a late model
and relatively inexpensive "built" chevy V8 for everyday use, while you keep
the original, restored matching-number motor (Yeah, I know... so's yer old 
man) relatively pristine and Lo milage.

Yes, the fluid will eat the rubber bushings on the front end.  I was 
changing the H2O pump in my '87 944 this weekend and noticed 
that the right sway bar bushing that holds the straight horizontal 
part of the bar is totally oil soaked and has deteriorated to the point
that it has split apart in the middle and has squeezed out of  the 
clamp that holds it in place. (fortunately no similar damage to the 
other bushings on this side).  The left hand side partner to this 
bushing is free of oil and looks to be in great shape.

My power steering reservoir has been leaking fluid for years now.
About two years ago I went in and cleaned out all the dirt and 
muck and replaced the hose clamps on the reservoir fittings 
figuring that this would cure the problem.  One week later I 
opened the hood and found hydraulic fluid all over the place just 
like before.  

I'm at the point now where I think I'm going to replace both hoses
that go to the reservoir in hopes that this will solve the problem. I
wonder if the hoses have become hard with age and no longer 
conform to the fittings well enough to make a good seal?

Anyway, I'm going to fix this, now,  before any more damage occurs

Harumphhh, (ahem...) Well, I nearly cried my eyes out when I read that the
factory had burned down, and the fire destroyed all the current XK-SS
production ['57(?)].  I know that at least one survived (maybe more, but
not many).  Tragically, the factory decided not to resume that line.
Imagine my sorrow and chagrin.

I seem to recall that the only XJ13 was (also tragically) destroyed, so
that leaves either an XK120C (aka "C-type), XK140MC (make mine a Drop-Head
Coupe, resplendant in BRG with Tan leather, Thank you very much) or a
D-Type (Ok, Same color scheme, but give me the full-Sail fairing) for those
of us who lust for models from the "Golden Age" of Jaguar.

I know, I know; XK150s were made in the tail of that era, and are pretty
sleek, as is the E-type, but somehow... nah...; they lack the that
muscular, yet voluptous line that characterizes Jaguar's Golden age. (Well,
OK, we'll allow the XK150 after all...)

The E-type though, with it's excellent IRS, doesn't even *handle* like a
Jaguar... Sheesh...

Subject:  Re: 356 calipers, etc.

I remember reading somewhere about a technique for "exercising" brake calipers.
The idea is that once a year or so, you move the pistons through their full range of
travel to keep them freed up.  This is done by temporarily replacing the brake pads
with the thinnest, most worn set you can find and stepping on the brakes to extend
the pistons.   Then, use a clamp to retract the pistons back into the caliper.  (Watch
that the brake fluid doesn't overflow the master cylinder as you do this step.)  Finally,
put the good brake pads back in and step on the brakes to move the pistons back
to their normal position.

Has anyone heard of or used this method?  Comments?

Text item: Text_1

     Hello files,
     
     I have just installed my 930's engine after removing it to have the turbo 
     rebuilt.  I have also replaced the spark plugs (damn are these expensive).
     
     After everything was together, I turned the key, only to have the engine 
     turn over extremely weakly, as if the battery was lacking oomph.  So I 
     jumped the battery to an operational 911, and got the same effect.  I 
     assumed I had a bad ground, so I polished the ground contact from the 
     transmission to the frame.  I also polished the starter contact.  It did 
     not change the situation.
     
     Anyone out there have any ideas for what could be wrong?

I like German cars.  When I made the decision a couple of years ago I
picked a BMW 1600 (for pre emission check reasons), but would recommend a
2002.  Lots of parts are available, they are relatively easy to work on,
and lots of advice can be gotten from enthusiasts.  You can build 
anything from an original daily driver to a serious hot rod.  
Furthermore, since so many were made it isn't like you were desecrating a

Subject: Coolant leaks and restos

If you are going to bring a 944 to a shop for a pressure test, if it has 
50K+ miles on the original hoses, if you don't think that your water pump 
is leaking, and if you are not getting lots of vapor in the exhaust, I 
would have all the water hoses replaced first. German rubber sucks. The 
cost of doing a pressure test would probably pay for the bulk of total hose 
replacement. And you have an excellant chance of fixing the problem. And 
you can probably do the hoses yourself, unlike a pressure test.

What major brands of coolant can be used in a Porsche? I know that Prestone 
and Zerex cannot, because of phosphates.

BTW, coolant leaks can damage more than your 944 clutch. Mazda has issues a 
recall on '93 RX-7's to replace the radiator cap. The old ones leaked, the 
coolant dried and became very flammable, and a few cars burnt to crisp.

If I wasn't to restore something, but was still looking, I would leaf 
through Hemmings, and check out parts and parts availability for 
restorations. Based on that, Mercedes and Jaguar have many great choices. 
For instance you can get a ratty but running 450SL for well under $10K, 
maybe even $5K. They are classics, 200hp+ on the early ones, the original 
build quality is there, parts are readily available, you can still drive it 
on nice days during the restore, and the value will hopefully go up by the 
time the restore is done. Beats the H*** out of restoring an MR-2 in every 
way. Of course, I would not do this and just go for something visceral like 
a Lotus Super Seven (in polished, waxed aluminum with a turbo FI RX-7 
powerplant) or a DeTomaso Pantera (street restore 500hp worked 351 and 
Italian styling).

There are three problems: 1) you run into HUGE difficulties if at any point
you have the car serviced by someone that does not know that there's
a hydraulic cam in the car and adjusts the valve as per normal on a 
mechanical lifter car. Bent valves, etc. kind of "Huge Difficulties"...
2) you have to keep the oil meticulously clean for the hydraulic lifters
not to gunk up. That means more frequent oil changes, or a conversion to
a Canton/MECA or System 1 oil filter, or better, both. 3) if you still
decide to do it, that's the wrong kit and in general the wrong place to
get it. Corollary: your engine builder had better know what he's doing,
too.

We use big bores on 1.7 and 1.8 engines all the time, and see the 100K
mile life out of them that we get on factory pistons and cylinders. Anything
bigger than 96mm is bad news, though, since it takes re-engineering the
whole top end. I'm not really sure where the "NPR == evil" word of mouth
got started, but I'd bet it involved engines in which *OTHER* things were done
to increase performance, that led to an untimely engine death.

A quick update since several on both lists (Porschephiles, Vanagon list) have
aided and abetted:

My 81 Vanagon is back on the road, now with 2.7 liters rather than 2.2 (still
with the 2.2's Zeniths tho', while I get the CIS FI organized).  Half a liter
is a noticeable difference.  In a sense the bigger breakthru is using the 
stock Porsche muffler.  This time I hung the engine about 2.5 inches lower,
at which height the Porsche muffler does fit.  With the six at the VW engine's
height the Porsche muffler would not fit, and no aftermarket solution I found
was at all satisfactory.  Now the engine is low (muffler 9+ in. from the
ground, 1.5 inches lower than it is in a Targa) but no problems in one after-
noon's test drives.

The 2.2 liter engine is excess to my needs now -- I would even listen to offers
on the 2.7 if someone wanted that market-forsaken size instead.  Email me
direct if you have a 914-4 or a bus or Vanagon that is waiting for this step

Well, getting old rusted pistons out of calipers is a messy and
potentially dangerous job, if using air, but it's the only way I could do
it.  When I ran into the problem Robert Albrecht described I filled the
caliper with brake fluid, put plenty of ship rags and soft pads between
the pistons, put the whole thing in a soft container with a lid, then
connected the air and let it sit.  Sometimes it took 5 minutes before it
popped loose.  Can't remember if I used WD40 in it overnight, prior to
this or not.  Obviously, a thorough cleaning of the caliper, both inside
and outside before reassembly is a must. 

Be careful when hooking up the air.  Those pistons coming out can damage 
other parts or you.

Ted Rodgers

P.S. Do it away from things you don't want to get brake fluid on.  Also, 
this is a good use for the remainder of the container you opened when you 
changed fluid in the spring.

a grease gun to generate enough pressure to force out the caliper
pistons.   Maybe  I'll  try Tom's suggestion first  (hooking  the

Actually it is this 'lever action' 'thing' you put grease patron's into. 
Some just fills up with grease from a bucket too. We have one that generate 
a 400kp/cm2 pressure from that tiny little piston, pops out almost any thing.

Subject: re:914 engine choices


     As a 914-6 conversion owner I thought I'd pass on my
     914s setup and experiences. My 914 was converted by
     the previous owner. He bought his engine from a place
     called Garretsons for about 5k. It consisted of a case from a
     1967 911s, 2.8 pistons, 2.4 heads and 46 Webers, and
     some sort of racing cams. The engine consistently
     fouled plugs and had no-power below 5000 rpm.
     The engine was a race engine, not intended for the
     street.

     He also installed a 915 transmission to handle the
     extra power. As for shift linkage he constructed his own,
     which was (is still) a mess. And also modified VW Bus
     half-shafts.

     When I bought the car it wasn't really street drive-able because
     of the very narrow power-band. My mechanic recommended
     and did the following changes. Have case-squirters installed.
     Change the 2.8 pistons to 2.7 to lower the compression ratio
     (it was supposed to be 13 to 1 with the 2.8's). Change the 46
     Webers to 40 Webers and lastly change the cams to
     a milder cam (from a 911 e, I think?). The engine was much
     more docile and drive-able after this.

     The engine started fouling plugs. I have since given up on that
     mechanic and started getting advice from a local 914-racer.
     He recommended that I add a CD to give me a hotter spark.
     He said that MDS-6 was an ok system and I got one with the car
     (in a box) so I'm going to put it back on. He also said that I had
     the wrong type of plugs and told me the right type of plugs to
     put on it. The distributor that is on the car is a Marelli and he
     recommended removing it and replacing it with a Bosch.
     As for the shift linkage, he has a Vellios 916 side shift kit on his
     915 tranny and recommended that I do the same.

     The car has been in my garage for the last year waiting for
     me to purchase the Vellios transmission kit.

     As for the engine I have the MSD-6, new plugs and the proper
     Bosch Distributor. But not being mechanically inclined, I have
     put off fixing the engine until I get the transmission kit, and do it
     all at once.

     How hard is it to install a MSD? How hard is it to swap the
     Marelli distributor with the Bosch. Should I do these at the same
     time? How hard is it to change the plugs? :-)

     As for conversion costs. I was told that the previous owner spent
     5k for the car. 5k for the engine, and about 10k for the transmission,
     oil tank, sheet metal, 911 suspension (he upgraded to 5 bolt),
     fuch alloys, and everything else, for a total of about 20k.
     He then sold the car to me for 7k.

I remember well in rebuilding my 64 cab brakes the difficulty in
removing the pistons.  Eventually I used air and a handpump...
kind of dangerous because when the piston came out (at around
200+psi) it didn't just flop conveniently on the bench.  I chased
the first one across the garage... the unguided missle luckily hit
only wood and cardboard and was undamaged.  Learning from that experience
I contained the others in some rags etc. But they were all perfectly
servicable, and when cleaned up did not bind of course.
Having more stuff , possibly even more smarts,
now I would definitely use hydraulic pressure, not
air.  In particular, a master cylinder with the addition of
only a suitable lever can be made in to a VERY high pressure pump.
That can be connected with steel brake line to the piston.  The other
ports on the mc plugged, and no flex hoses used....   (By the way
a way to plug the other ports is with crimped brake lines).

The Autothority Mass Flow Sensor is a hotwire type. However, this does
not automatically make it produce more power than the stock system.

As I said before, the problem with the 3.2 engine is not the fuel injection
system or how the air is metered. It is the exhaust and muffler system.

Subject: RE: 911: (re) zenith's enrichme

Hi, John.  I'll play back my understanding of the 911T Zenith fuel enrichment
circuit and that will give the real gurus a target to correct.  The purpose
is to richen the mixture during high vacuum medium RPM conditions, like on
decelleration with throttle shut.  Your ignition system (which I lack on my
Vanagon-converted-to-911-six-engine) tells it when to turn on and the big
adjustment screws tell it how much.  Its effect is to lower emissions during
the particular conditions, and I suppose in the long run to extend the life
of your intake valves.  Since the RPM range that turns it on is around 1800,
there shouldn't be any effect on performance.

One response to my question on disabling it said crank the big screws in and
optionally plug the lines into the carbs; also make sure that the diaphragms
are in good shape.  The other just said plug the lines.  I can second the
importance of keeping the diaphragms in good shape (in this as in other parts
of life).  One throat of one of my carbs didn't respond at all to the idle
air correction screw until I had replaced the idle enrichment diaphragm, which
had literally had a hole burned into it.

If I had the electronics, I would run mine.  Let me know what you decide and
why.

Hi David and Peter - 

I love this list. 

I learn somthing new everyday from it.

Here all along, I thought that 944s were raised by stern
gentlemen, and ladies, with dueling scars on their left 
cheek (face cheek, Bart!) and an eyepatch in old castles
around Stuttgart.

So much to learn and soooo little time........

Hi George -

You said, "My 83 has manual steering and will NEVER leak!"

Roger, that! I have the same situation. But last year my
steering went from solid as a rock at highway speeds to 
super-light and the steering wheel is now off TDC by about
20 degrees. My mechanic checked it out and did not find any
bushings, tie rods or any thing else wrong - in fact he said
the movement of the steering wheel was transmitted to the 
linkages just fine - no slack at all. He narrowed it down to 
the steering box and called around to try to find one. Most
difficult to come by since almost every other 944 has power
steering and the non-power steering units rarely fail.
Except mine, of course.
Any suggestions?

  It is extremely easy to get 'upside down' in a car (even a cheap one)

Subject: RE: Tires


Hi all,

Replacement tires for a 968. Well, make sure they are the same speed
rating as the OEM tires. Then make sure they are at least the same 
size AND aspect ratio. 

This means a "v" rating, minimum. Yeah, these can be expensive, especially
if you have the new 17" wheels. They should last longer than 12,000 miles, 
but the REARs on Porsches usually wear first, even on the front-engined
cars. It's all the power the factory gives us.

Seriously, keep inflation correct. The OEM tires can be replaced with
Yoko AVS, Dunlops, Goodyear GS-C, Michelin, etc. Replace ALL four with the 
same make. Differing compounds will cause some handling problems. Toyos 
work good also. Anyway, with AVS tires, I went 34,000 miles, rears wearing 
first.

If you have differing wheel sizes on your Porsche, front and rear (7" front,
8" rear), DO NOT rotate front to rear. This was intended. Just expect the
rears to wear first. If you have the same size (width) front and rear, it is
okay to rotate. This is true for ALL Porsches.

I've price Koni's and Bilsteins recently and found the best price by far
(for us average humans without resale numbers, connections, etc.) is at RD

  This seems like a good lead-in to a question I've been having regarding
  upgrading the exhaust and muffler system on my '84 911.  Saw and heard a
  new black cabrio at the last two track days in Portland with aftermarket
  headers and muffler.  A wonderful sound, though hard to describe - a bit
  more throaty than stock.  Defintely demanded attention as it rumbled on
  past  :-).  Too bad the guy didn't know what kind they were  :-(    Of
  course, now my interest has peaked and am thus revisiting this upgrade.

  I've seen the ads and done a bit of research regarding new headers/heat
  exchangers and mufflers.  Just wondering what the net has to say
  regarding all the different systems out there?  I'm sure a lot (if not
  everything) depends on how much you're willing to spend, but I'm just
  looking for reasonable suggestions.  Seen the Borlas, Ansa, B&B, etc. -
  any thoughts.  Also, is the recommendation replacing all components at
  once, or piece by piece as the money becomes available?

  I guess other considerations that will need to be addressed include:
  catalytic converter - retain or lose, DME chip - need upgrade for a new
  exhaust?  Any and all thoughts, comments are appreciated...

I have to confess to using Prestone in a 50 percent mix (with water) with no

Subject: 951 Track prep questions


Hello All;

I am preparing to take my stock '89 951 out to Driver's Ed at Summit Point 
Raceway with the Potomac region of PCA on November 13.  This will be my first 
Driver's Ed with the 951.  What preparations should I make on my car before 
going?  The following work has been performed recently:  
  New front brake pads 4K miles ago, rear pads at about 70%;
  Brake fluid service 4K miles ago, although still looks somewhat dirty;
  Oil/Filter change with Mobil 1 about 500 miles ago
  New rear tires last week;

I was considering performing the following items;

Alignment.  The steering wheel is offset about 15 deg. CCW when the car is going 
straight.  This just happened after getting the new rear tires.  Go figure.

Shock adjustment.  The front shocks are adjustable, but I am not sure how to 
adjust them and the effect the adjustments will have.  Lower ride height?  
Stiffer ride?

Any suggestions which would make for a safer, more enjoyable experience would be 
appreciated.  Please respond directly to me unless you feel your inputs would 
benefit other list members.  Thanks in advance.

          SUBJECT:   911 Shocks
 
 
I have only been a member of this list for a few months, so if this topic
has been recently covered then point me to the correct archive.
 
The 1972 911T that I purchased in June will be getting new shocks, and
probably larger torsion bars (21 and 26mm) this winter.  In addition I
will be having the ride height set down, the cars ride height has not been
touched (you could drive a Mini-Cooper under it).
 
I autocross and will be wanting to track the car next year (updated chain
tensionors will be done also).  As far as the torsion bars go, I really do
not know if I want the change in ride, since lowering and replacing the
shocks will stiffen the ride anyway, but since the car will be partly
taken apart to replace the shocks, and I would not like to have to pay for
two ride height adjustments, I may go ahead and install the new torsion
bars.
 
As far as shocks go, I have used Koni on other cars that I have owned.  I
would like an externally adjustable shock, but I am not sure if I really
need it for a 911.  Does Koni make an externally adjustable shock for 1972
911's?   I can get Boge, KYB, Koni, Blistein, I have not seen any sources
for Carrera, does anyone know of a supplier?  My personal order of shock
quality and reputation is:
 
        KYB
        Boge
        Koni
        Blistein
        Carrera
 
What do others think, am I being to name brand conscious.
 
Other questions,
 
Frequently, when I turn on the turn signal, right or left, both turn
signal lights on the Tach flash.  If I turn off the signal, then turn it
back on, it is ok, but sometimes it does flash both lights again, is this
symptoms of a bad relay?
 
What can be done to fix the Tach from bouncing during shifts, I read in
Up-Der-Fixen III, that a capacitor can be added the Tach.  Since the
articles are from the early 70's, I was wondering if there was a more
modern fix.

Looks like you're ready for your first driver's ed.

My advice is to not do anything to change the car before you go to the track
for the first time. Chances are, (if you pay attention to your instructor)
that you will not be reaching the limits of your car in any way.

Your car is already faster than you are capable of driving. So, leave it
alone until you are faster than the car. (BTW, I don't know too many
drivers, even instructors, who are faster than a stock 89 944 Turbo!!!)

As far as the steering wheel being not centered by 15 degrees. That should
be taken care of by wheel alignment. Since your car has an airbag, the
normal solution of removing the steering wheel and repositioning it is not
for the amateur.

Enjoy yourself, but remember, this is an education, not just a chance to
drive fast....

Subject: Starter Wires.


To the fellow with the possible starter problem:

The 944 starter wires are fairly simple:


	            Early (to 1985 1/5)      Late

From Battery                 Red              Black   Large Lug
From Alternator              Black            Black   Large Lug

From Ign. Switch             Red/Black        Red/Black  Small Lug


The starters may have TWO small lugs, inspect to see which you have BEFORE
removal and where the ignition lead goes. If you wire to the relay side, the 
starter will be on as soon as the key is connected. It will stay on, maybe
not engaged, as long as the switch is on in that condition.

From: spindel@anchor.apl.washington.edu (Bob Spindel)
Subject: First Restoration 


Don't know who first brought this up but...

I've been away, and am just catching up on my e-mail.  So this 
advice might be out of date already.

What you do for your first restoration depends a lot on what 
you already know.  Have you ever taken an engine apart?  Will 
this be the first?  Have you ever done any painting? Bodywork?  
Are you going to do it all yourself, or send pieces out to 
commercial outfits?  Like painting? engine rebuild?  The 
questions go on.

If you've never done any of the above, I'd strongly recommend 
something inexpensive and simple like an older water cooled 
car.  One of the best to start with is an early MG or Triumph, 
say late sixties.  They're simple, basic cars.  No emission 
controls, and the bodies are completely removable from the 
frame.  You can get the entire thing apart, right down to the last 
nut and bolt.  And parts are still available and relatively cheap.  
There are even a half dozen mail-order places that specialize in 
them.

I just redid two 240Z's, a '71 and a '72.  They are also very 
simple, and are available for a lot less than an MG or Triumph.  
You can get one in pretty decent shape for $1000 to maybe 
$1500.  And parts are about as cheap as you can find them, and 
usually available at your local parts shop.  The only slight 
disadvantage is that they are unibody construction (like the 
911) so the body and frame are integral.  Thus, they don't come 
apart quite as easily or as completely as cars with separate 
bodies and frames.  There's a book called "Restoring a Datsun 
240Z" or something close to that, that will be a big help. Also, 
there are a few books about rebuilding 240Z engines.  (If you go 
for the 240Z, let me know and I'll look them up for you.)  Those 
books are one thing that makes the 240Z such an attractive first 
restoration.

The VW is simple too, and air cooled like the Porsche.  
However, I think the VW engine is slightly more complicated 
than a standard water cooled unit for a first time rebuilder.  
Others may disagree, which probably means they're roughly 
the same.

All the advice about reading, reading, reading is very sound.  
Also, as someone said (Bart? Lee?), pick something you like.  
You'll be living with it for quite a while, and you'll want to 
spend that time feeling good about it.  

One more thing.  None of these cars will ever be worth a whole 
lot of money, at least not for a darn long time, but if you redo it 
yourself, it'll be worth millions to you in satisfaction.

I'm by NO means an expert, and I wouldn't mind having a slightly lower,
"throatier" exhaust sound as well as more power; but I believe that the
factory spent a lot of time tuning the exhaust on my '83 911SC, not just
to meet noise requirements, but also to make the engine's power output smooth
and driveable and match it to the transmission ratios. 

An engine with aftermarket exhaust will have differently shaped pipes which 
I think will affect the power of the engine at different engine speeds, 
making it less than pleasant to drive.

Someone please confirm or shoot down my theory :-).

Since this is your first event and your speeds will be relatively low
(it won't _feel_ slow!), it probably won't matter much.  They don't
affect ride-height. Set them to however you set them on the street. That
way, the experience you get at speed on the track will transfer to your
street driving. If you get hooked (I mean when :-)) and you start doing
more track events, you can start experimenting with varying shock
stiffness.

I tell all my students to _resist_the_urge_ to modify their cars until
they have enough experience to know what makes sense - for them.  If
you're not judicious, you can spend an infinite amount of money
upgrading your car. What's "essential" for one driver is a luxury for
another.  Remind yourself that a drivers ed. event is educational - not
a race: you can learn a great deal in a stock car. Actually, probably
more than if you're constantly `upgrading' the car: when you come back
to the track and find that you're 2 seconds faster than you were last
time you won't have to wonder whether it's you or the latest gadget you
installed.

My car is basically a stock '87 951. I've put '89 shocks all around, '89
springs and swaybars in front. Lowered it about an 1.5". Cool Carbon
Blue brake pads. Comp/TA R1 tires. Roll bar and 5-point harnesses. 
Autothority 2.5 chip. Note that none of these modifications were done
until after I had half a dozen schools under my belt. I didn't install
the chip until long after I became an instructor.

Re: oil. Common wisdom is to "overfill" your oil by about half a quart
for the 944/951. This supposedly helps prevent starvation of the #2 rod

Stefan,

The factory exhaust system, especially on 911's after model year '74, are not
high performance systems. The factory had to make a lot of compromises to
meet noise and smog requirements.

If your 911SC is a U.S. spec car, you have a single catalytic converter on
the left side of you car. Look at the path the exhaust gases take to get to
the converter. This is horrible for performance. For best power, through out
the RPM range, it is good to have relatively equal length paths for each
exhaust pipe to the accumulator. The factory system does not even come close.

Very true....

I've been to 3 autox events this year and at the last one, a guy decided to 
slalom down a hill a little too fast for the rainy conditions.  He got loose 
and sloppy and tried to "save" his run by doing everything he could to get 
his car around the cones without hitting them, but ended up nailing a 
concrete post instead.  Personally, I'd rather take a 2 second penalty and 
nail the cone.

Earlier this year I attended a 1-day high performance driving course with the 
local Ferrari club - my boss let me drive his 348!  Before we did any 
"serious" track time, we were supposed to follow the instructor-driven lead 
car single file around the course to see the "line".  A few cars in front of 
me, a guy decided he didn't like the slow 20mph navigation through a set of 
corners and decided to have some fun - he floored it in a corner from his 
slow speed.  Well, his car got sideways, then faced the other way, then it 
launched up a small dirt hill, through a fence, and ended up in a pile of 
dirt, rocks, and wood.

One of the instructors figured he did about $60,000 CDN worth of damage to 
his car - it was actually bent in the middle!!!

So, go out there and have fun LEARNING how to drive, but don't be a goof 
about it.  Be reasonable.  Who would have thought you could total a car going 
single file at 20 mph?  Definitely not the owner of that Ferrari!

Please enlighten me on these oil filters; I've not heard of them.  By 
'more frequent oil changes', you mean more often than 3,000 mi?  How
often would you recommend, for a car that's driven regularly, but not
especially hard?

Hello P-heads:  Need some input from the racing set.  I used to race SCCA 
events  25 years ago. A and B production cars, Corvettes.  Great fun, big 
bucks to me at the time but sponsorship helped a lot.  Been driving pcars 
since 1967 and been too busy doing other things to get back on the track.  
Don't want a big budget affair, just wanna go out and run sometime.  Don't 
want to use  current street inventory (356, 912, 911SC).  Want a track car to 
track for all the obvious reasons. Presently have an air cooled bias but am 
not anal about it. 
 
I know I should probably get out to track events and sniff around and I intend 
to do that.  What I need help with is some direction and cost/fun equation 
info. 
 
Specifically, wheres the most bang for the buck in pcar racing.  I can buy a 
fully prepared, 914-4 for about $9500 with "lo miles".  What's the same 
competive ride gonna cost in h2o mobiles. What's the level of competition in 
the different classes.  I'd even consider vintage if it made $ sense and the 
field was reasonably competitive and not too worried about being on the edge 
for fear of rock chips.  So if you racers can give me insights into what you 
like about your rides and classes, especially those of you who've had a couple 
of different types of care and been in different classes.  Also input about 
the friendliness quotient, how helpful are fellow drivers in different 
classes, etc. 
 
Would rather buy a car than build one so help in the " How much I gotta spend 
to get started with a decent ride" would be great. 
 
I'm in N. Calif. as  a geographical reference.  Understand racing at this 
level may be different from region to region. 
 
I've sure appreciated the info shared on this group.  Lots of good info, not 
much uncontested BS.  Thanks in advance for your opinions.

David Christiano writes:
>>>I can say the shocks should never by themselves affect the ride height.

The 944 uses MacPherson struts as its front suspension, right?  That means that
the ride height is determined by the location (height) of the lower spring seat
relative to the wheel centerline.  That means that the "shocks" (if by that term
you mean the front struts) *completely control* the ride height.  This holds for
*any* concentric shock/spring situation, not just MacPherson struts.  I know
this from sad experience using Spax shocks on a Lotus Europa.  Spax didn't
bother to put the spring seat as low as they were the factory shocks, so you go
a free but undesired 1" increase in ride height.

If by "shocks" you mean a strut insert, then we're back to Peter Tracy's
gas-pressure theory, or something.  Is the gas pressure really enough to raise
the car by 1-1/2 inches?  If so, that seems like a fairly serious design error
on Koni's part.

Subject: Advice sought - '87 911 Carrera Coupe

Porschephiles,

I am new to Porsches and am in the market for a 911. I am currently looking
at a 1987 Carrera Coupe (Black w/ whaletail) at a local dealership.

It is reported to have 80 some thousand miles on it. (The odometer has been 
changed. I have service records up through 89,000.)

I am having a place called Autothority evaluate the car for me. (It's near
Alexandria Virginia.) Can anyone offer any opinions about Autothority? Should
I have the car inspected any place else?

The body and interior of the car seem to be in fine shape (albeit the interior
is an ugly burgundy.) I took it for a test drive and it seems to be okay. The
engine pulls strongly and the suspension seems flawless. It drives practically
the same as later models that I have tried (for twice the price).

There are a few things that concern me about the vehicle:

Reportedly, 5000 miles ago major engine work was performed. I have the repair
receipt but it does not make sense to me. Supposedly the previous owner was on
the retentive side and had the engine completely overhauled at 89,000. The
receipts that I have (more are supposed to be forthcoming) don't add up. How 
many valve guides will $137 buy? How many head gaskets (are there 6?) does
$369 buy? how many rocker arms does $64 buy? There's also a cam shaft listed
for $596? (Is there one shaft for an entire side of the engine? Or is there
one per head? (There are 6 separate heads, no? One per jug?) There's a head
refurbishment listed on the receipt for #6 cylinder head. Is it normal to
just refinish one instead of doing all of them?

Is it "normal" for a Porsche to require major engine work at only 80K miles?
According to the service records there was one case where there were more than
22K miles between 'tune ups'. (I hope that the oil was changed during this time)
There was another where 17K elapsed between maintenance intervals. Could this
have toasted the engine? If the engine were in bad shape how would one determine
this?

The dealership has agreed to fix any items that are found to be wrong with it. 
We shall see  to what degree they actually mean it.
I am having it checked out by (what was told to me to be) a professional outfit 
and I am posting my concerns to this list. Is there anything else that I should
do or check before seriously considering the car? The asking price is $23,900
and from the sound of things they would probably accept 22,500.

I will get more information on the engine work that was performed tomorrow.

Any replies, suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am 
treading in unfamiliar territory . . .

This post, for some silly reason, reminded me of a time I agreed to help a
friend of mine repack some front wheel bearings.  While we
had the brake calipers off the vehicle, we decided to replace the brake
pads.  Of course the old pads came out easily, but I was having a heck
of a time getting one of the pistons to retract to get the new pads in.  I
finally became really annoyed and employed a set of *very* large channel
locks in an attempt to push the piston back in (the automotive victim in this
story was a 4WD Toyota - no pcars were injured).  For better or for worse, my
friend and I had consumed a few beers that day and I must say that generally
I have very good bladder control.  Having said that I now had the sensation
that I had just relieved myself right there in his driveway.  Luckily, it was
not my body fluids staining my
shorts, but a high pressure blast of brake fluid that hit me right in the
crotch as the bleed screw suddenly decided to rid itself of some crud.

Needless to say, no one fell for the "brake fluid" story as I walked around
the rest of the afternoon with a *big* stain in my pants.

Does this kinda stuff only happen to me?

Obviously this is a part you don't want failing at speed. If you are lucky
the only thing that will happen will be considerable body damage from the
flopping tire assembly. If unlucky......
Anyway when you check the joints there should be virtually NO play in any
direction. A clunking noise when turning or when hitting a bump is a real
strong signal to pull over and investigate.
It would be interesting if anyone else has had this kind of problem

	Ok, I read this and thought you should know what *I* ran into.  Maybe
you will change your mind on the car.  Actually, I was considering this car,
but, I don't think it is practical right now for me (I'm a college student
traveling 600 miles per week to and from school).

	In Dallas, Texas, there is a white 1987 911 Targa with Black leather.
Since I am in Austin, I could not drive/see it, so I had a very close friend
of mine (who knows Porsches) go and check it out for me.  It has 29000 miles.
It has never been (so he says) driven in weather.  The body and interior
are almost flawless.  It has one chip by the rear wheel well and a couple
road chips on the front of the car.  Otherwise, flawless.  He is asking
$23.9K for it also!  If you would like to contact him, his number is
214-363-2881.  I will tell you, however, somebody from Arizona is calling
about it also.

	Just a tid-bit of side information.  He is a dentist.  His first
"sports car" was a modifies Ferrari 308 which the previous owner had put
turbos.  Poor guy, huh?  Oh, his girlfriend is supposed to be pretty hot,
too!  (So says my friend! - he has good taste)

	Anyway, I think it may be worth a call anyway.
