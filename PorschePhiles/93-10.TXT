Perhaps more appropriate for the gold chain set, but you have to admit
these buggers can get expensive.  This frame got a chuckle out of me:

Subject: Re: 930 everyday car?

>1. Am I looking at a 911 turbo or a 930?
Both, the development project number used by Porsche is 930, all the parts
specific to this car start with a 930.. The name used by the general public
for this car is 911 Turbo which is also what the Porsche mid 1980 sales
brochures call it. When talking with Porsche owners I use "930", with
none Porsche owners I use "911 Turbo". The one place it does matter
is my insurance company, Farmers, they rate the 86' 911 Turbo and the
86' 930 differently, it seems that people who call their cars "930"
have less accidents/incidents than those that call them "911 Turbos",
actually this does make sense.

The 87 is a good year because it has the last major changes before the 93.
The 87 has the new 5 speed while the 86 has a 4 speed, the 87 has a fan
on the front oil cooler which is an expensive do it yourself add-on to the
previous years, but is a requirement if you drive in traffic.

>2. Serve as a drive-to-work car?
In California it is an everyday car if you can afford the maintenance.
Now that I have moved to Colorado it is a 50% of the days type car.
It has wide tires which make it float across rain puddles, it has
torque that makes ice and snow an adventure best not experienced,
(mine may be worse because it has a limited slip diff.).

>3. What other types of maintenance are common around 60K miles?
At 60K you should go through everything, I would even replace the 
chain tensioners (lost my first one 34K miles). I drive my car very
hard but still expect to get 150K out of the engine:-).
Expect $1K / year upkeep costs (beyond normal maintenance), if you
are not comfortable with this, do not buy it. 

>4. How many miles can I expect to get out of the turbo?
Did the previous owner warm up the turbo before use and cool down
the turbo after use? If yes, 100K+ miles is reasonable, if no, then
30K miles could be possible. I consider the turbo to be part of
the normal upkeep cost, much like replacing the alternator.

>5. difference between the 1987 3.3T and the 1993 3.6T?
There is a significant horsepower increase, ~60hp, and
the handling is also improved. If I could afford one I would
replace my 86'. If one can't afford a $110,000 car as an
everyday vehicle then it really doesn't matter what the differences
are. If you want specifics locate an old copy of Excellence or
Panorama, they both had articles covering this car, I'll try to
find mine.

Happened to be on the phone with Turbo City last night.  They weren't aware of
any wastegate rebuild kits, and they don't do wastegate rebuilds.  They do have
a few 'gates in stock, but none for a 931.  The good news is that if you need
your _turbo_ rebuilt, they're incredibly knowledgeable and professional.
Turned mine around in a day and a half for exactly the $$ of the quote.

Jay,

Yes a 930 can be an everyday car!..... most of the time...
Where do you live??? big question with this type of car.. I did
notice you mentioned snow.
I LOVE my 1987 911 turbo or 930.. 930 was the factory code for the car.
And I drive it almost every day except in the winter Nov-March
and I live outside of  Boston
My insurace agent did not differentiate between the regular 911 and the
turbo...insurance rates are the same!!!!

I have 46K so I'm not sure.. but we could talk about it off line..I have a
good buddy who owns a porsche shop.

>4. How many miles can I expect to get out of the turbo prior to having

Again we could talk.. that buddy I just mentioned also has an 87 turbo.

>5. Anyone have a feel for the performance difference between the 1987

1987 US version is rated at 280hp.. the 93 is 320hp..but remember hp
determins top speed.. both very fast 150+.. torque determins accelleration
both fantastic.

Also you should be aware of US v.s. Gray market

Re: the discussion on JAP  motors...

The acronym stands for J.A. Prestwich.  The motors were used for
power in Morgan 3 wheelers and various single cylinder 500cc F3 cars
in the early 50s.  The 2 cylinder motors used in Morgans are from
the 1930s.

914 conversions.

I happened to be at an acquantaince's shop the other day and he had
a customer car in which I have seen before.  It is a 914(pre bid
bumper) with a 3.0 911 motor, E cams, carbs, euro compression, 934
front struts, 180lb or so rear coils,  SC front brakes, vent. rotors
and bigger brakes rear, 901 trans w/904 mainshaft and closer ratio gears.
The car is black(top is smooth black), and looks mint, interior and exterior. I am
probably forgetting stuffHe just put the 3.0 in recently, because the
built 2.7 did not have enough power, the car is not flared and has
16x7 wheels all around and autox tires.....I understand that he is musing
over trying to sell in the low $teens...if that becomes reality,
I will put a message on the list.

I'm sure that if your selection criteria are `cheapness', going faster,
making people jaw drop and `better' handling, then a non-Porsche would 
be very suited to your requirements.

Personally I like my 911 (and all Porsche) because it is packed with
engineering quality, because of the flawed design, because of the 30
year development heritage, because it is engineered to last, because
of the vehicles character, and finally because of that extraordinary
flat six.

These criteria are mostly asthetic, in addition my 911 is sure as hell 
fast, probably too fast for maximum performance on public roads, and
you'd be advised not to push it's handling to the limit on public roads. 
I don't care if people look at it or not as I go by. It certainly was not 
cheap, but I don't subscribe to the `cheap is good philosophy'. If you
want a `cheap' car don't get a Porsche. It sounds as though these great
and fine motor cars would be most unsuited to your requirements.
In fact, I'm suprised you want to be on porschephiles at all!!

Subject: 944 Turbo or 944 S

There are probably others here more knowledgeable than me, but since I just 
went through the same situation, I'll throw in my thoughts.

1) The Turbo came to the US as an 86 model.  It was changed some in 1987, 
biggest difference being dual airbags and the availability of ABS.  I didn't 
spend too much time looking at the 4 valve version as I was told they were 
"peaky" in terms of around town driving and I preferred the "turbo look".  The 
S4 has the turbo look.  The things to look for are 1) when was the timing belt 
changed or tensioned (depending on mileage) 2) water pumps seem to be a weak 
point on early 944's, haven't heard much complaint about those after 85/2, and 
3) clutches.

I ended up buying a 87 turbo with 29,000 miles for $15,000.  The only records 
available were the delivery work and the 30,000 mile check which were done by 
a dealer.  The interior was excellent - the exterior needed TLC.  It appears 
that it was driven year around in Ohio and shows some effects from that.  
Meguier's and patience have made it look pretty good from 5 feet away.  It 
drives great.  The biggest negative about the car is the lack of torque down 
low in city driving and the strange "take up action" of the clutch coupled 
with what I think is extremely long throw in the accelerator linkage.

My wife and I just completed a 3300 mile loop from Duluth, Minnesota to 
Edmonton, Jasper, Lake Louise, Banff, and Waterton-Glacier and back accross 
Montana and North Dakota with the car and we both can't believe how 
comfortable it is. It burned 1/3 of a quart of oil and ran at the bottom of 
the temp range the entire time.  (anyone know why the temp goes up when heat 
is turned on? - just curious).  We cruised at 90 on the secondary roads, stray 
cattle and antelope make me nervous, and consideralbly more than that on the 
controlled access sections.  It is very quiet and stable at those speeds.

As to whether the turbo or the S4 would be better, all I can say is that the 
"toy" budget wouldn't quite reach the S4 level for me and I'm very pleased 
with my choice.

Subject: 911 smoke

This is kind of a repeat question as I asked it a few months ago, but
work has been done to the car so I'd like to ask again.  My '70T which
was smoking so bad that I had to quit driving it has recently been repaired.
I had just had the motor rebuilt and instead of clearing up after a few 
miles the smoking (oil by smell and consumption) got so bad it looked like
the car was on fire.  Tear down revealed a cracked head (not visable but found
by pressure testing) and two broken oil rings.  Compresion was still good
on this 1200 mile old motor.

The motor is back together with new pistons/barrels this time (the others
still appeared good but I wasn't taking any chances-anybody want to buy
them?) and a good used head.  I finally found somebody local to me who
got the Zeniths dialed in and now I have a strong running 911.  Prior to
tweakng the carbs this mechanic verified compresssion and general condition
of engine and ignition and found them to be good.

The car still smokes.  The engine has about 300 miles on the new pistons/
barrels/rings, good compression.  Smokes after you stop, idle and go, and
upon start up (quite a puff or two when starting).  No sputtering or hesitation
yet, strong acceleration, runs clean at steady rpm.  

The smoking is bearable from a driving standpoint but not accepatable after
the money I've spent on this engine.  Any chance it'll go away in a few
more miles?  I'm a little worried about valve guides/seals as I guess that
something wrong could have been done during the valve job/head work.  Any
way to check on these?

I'm measuring my oil comsuption and will be watching the plugs closely.

As a side, Mel at Pacific Coast Porsche in Santa Clara CA seems like a
pretty decent guy and especially likes old 911/912's, and mechanical
injected cars as well.  He went under estimate on the time/work required
to get my car running properly.  He also works on electronically injected
cars and 944's, occasional 914's, too.  If any Bay Area folks are interested
in him for work on your car you might give him a call at (408) 988-7842.

I'm looking forward to seeing his latest project.  4 wheel disk braked 911

Subject: RE: JAPs/aircraft


JAP's were not cars, just engines (made by the J.A. Prestwick company).
Usually fitted to motorcycles (e.g. the HRD that won the Senior (500cc)
TT in 1926), in single, twin, ohv and sv variations. Used by Morgan in
their 3-wheeler, mounted transversely in front of the car, air- or water-cooled, in a variety of tunes and ohv or sv. This drove a shaft and thus
the single rear wheel through one or two chains (two if early two-speed model).

Probably the most famous application was in Brough Superior m/cycles,
such as the SS100 made famous by T.E. Lawrence. Later models usually had
a MAG (Swiss) v-twin instead of a JAP. I've forgotten what the BS used
in the movie (first five minutes of Lawrence of Arabia) had for an engine.

I don't care if people look at it or not as I go by. It certainly was not

want a `cheap' car don't get a Porsche. It sounds as though these great
and fine motor cars would be most unsuited to your requirements.
In fact, I'm suprised you want to be on porschephiles at all!!

My response:

Please let not be racist about Porsche or Porschephile. We all own Porsche for 
one reason or another. Some like it for its looks. Some like it for its 
engineering. Some like it for its handling capabilities, etc. There is no law 
that says you have to buy a Porsche and be happy with your Porsche because of 
one reason or another. 

Personally, I like my 911 Cab because it looks sexy as hell, drives really good 
and has that tail end happiness that makes me giggle everytime I step down and 
lift off on the right pedal. It also bugs the heck out of me when I spend hours 
removing plugs and doing valve adjustments. For those times when I really want 
a more civilized car with gads of power and no-brainer handling limits, I would 
choose my BMW M3 over the 911 Cab. And for those days when there is a beautiful 
sunset over the bay, I choose my Ducati motorcycle over both cars. So, my point 
is live and let live, let everybody enjoy their Porsche the way they choose to 
enjoy their Porsche. Please.

And another thing, Porsche AG did and still does have some problems. It may be 
not anticipating the competition from Japan, not anticipating the market for 
all luxury cars drying up due to changes in attitudes and the economy, and 
pricing their products out of the price elasticity point. We all remember when 
everybody was lowwering their prices except Porschewho was raising their prices 
substantially. Say what you will Stan, but if you asked Porsche AG, I am pretty 
sure that they would admit to some mistakes themselves. When a company goes 
from selling 50,000 cars to less than 4000 cars a year, they have goofed.

I recently bought a '84 911 and have a little problem.
I am quite tall and I often hit the steering wheel
with my knees.  I remember driving an '83 SC which 
had the steering wheel further away from the dash,
leaving more room for the knees.  Would anyone know how I 
could increase the space between the dash and the 
steering wheel without spending too many $$$$?  Porsche
suggests buying another steering wheel which, I have been

Yikes! must come attached to a 924!

Philippe-

You can get a very nice (MOMO) steering wheel and hub for
about $400. Before you do that, though, check to see if you
have any adjustment on your seat mounting hardware. I have
factory Recaro seats and there are three adjustment holes at 
the front and back corners for height/angle. I just lowered my 
seat all the way and changed my driving position a little and 
it's ok. The only time I have a problem is getting into the 
car. It wouldn't be too good for the old LeMans style starts.

Still saving my money for one of those nice smaller steering
wheels, but after I lowered the seat, it lowered the steering
wheel on my priority list. 

If you do get a new steering wheel (easy DIY job) don't go too 
small. I drove a friend's 911 with one of those 12" fat wheels 
and couldn't see much of the tach. (I know, red line is all

The "JAP" engine is actually the "J.A.Prestwich" engine.  Originally built
as a motorcycle engine, is was also used in the Morgan car.  The Morgan _3-

for years they had exposed valve springs with drip-feed oilers.

I believe that single-cylinder, 500 cc JAP engines are still used in
British motorcycles used for speedway racing.

Hey porsche-guys/porsche-gals!

Haven't you noticed by now that a consumer's 
primary purchase criteria is *NEVER* based 
on things that are good for them in the long
run like QUALITY & DEPENDABILITY???????

Let's face the naked truth:

People's primary purchase criteria is EMOTIONAL.
Later, they will worry about rationalizing their
choice of products. 

The only reason why people 
buy Porsches is because of the 
driving pleasure (944...) or (inclusive)
the excitement (911...) it offers and because of the "look",
the "sound" and the prestige of the Porsche name
(that stand out of the crowd/herd feeling). 
As far as we have evolved, we are still animals 
(social animals to be sure) and our primary senses dictate
our conduct.

So, in light of the above facts,
let me rephrase the question that led to this discussion:

QUESTION--
What is it that has gone sour in this love affair between Porsche
and its public? Why are there 50000-4000 = 46000 divorces??

ANSWER--
As in all love affairs that turn sour : Resentment, feeling of betrayal.
The sex is not good anymore (read "Porsche does not win races anymore"). 
The Japanese cars make you laugh at the Porsche specs (horse power, 
torque....). This hurts the porsche ego-maniac in the deepest part of his/her 
emotional make-up and is sufficient to break up the relationship.


Best Regards,
(from one "ego-maniac" to the others,)

P.S.: The next time any of you feels like making a speech on 
quality and dependability, please go and buy a Volvo or 
an Acura or a computer or anything that generally works...

Welcome to Porschephiles! There has been alot of discussion on
buying/repairing 944 Turbos, so you might want to check the archives for
more info. The list of potential 944/944 Turbo problems is well documented
(and reasonably long). The most expensive is the clutch ($2-3K) on the
Turbo. The water-cooled turbo itself is *not* considered one of those
problems; It lasts a long time. Definitely have the car checked over by a
knowledgeable mechanic...

>2) Given a choice, would you buy a 944 Turbo or a 944 S4?  Why?  How bad is the
>   turbo lag on the 944 Turbo in day-to-day driving?

The 944 turbo does not have much lag, but just the same it is not
particularly fun to drive around town in stock form (stop and go traffic
here in NJ). The throttle needs to be pretty wide open before the turbo
starts to build pressure. I own one and would probably not want it as a
primary means of transportation around town. On the race track, though, is
another matter. These cars just seem to have relentless acceleration in the
70-140 MPH range. If only we could take full advantage of this on the
street...

One solution to the sluggishness around town would be to install an
aftermarket "chip." These chips, other than boosting HP by 20%, greatly
improve partial throttle response or "tip-in." This makes the car much
nicer to drive around town (caveat: I do not have "the chip," but have
heard this from several people who do).

>3) How are these cars for interstate drives over two hours?  Are they
>   particularly uncomfortable or noisy?

This probably depends alot on the tires and the road. Generally it is very
nice (great seats and climate control).  With stiff tires and the factory
sport Koni sport shock absorbers on older concrete (ka-thunk, ka-thunk)
highways it is not pleasant. But then it wouldn't be pleasant in any
Teutonic-suspensioned car either. Fortunately there are not many concrete
highways that I travel in the northeast.

If you're concerned about fuel economy, the Turbo gets an amazing 29 MPG on
the highway. The S2 probably gets 2 or 3 MPG less.

Hope this helps.

Mark

Subject: RE: Seat restoration


	I too am faced with a similar problem.

	The beige pinstripe material on my 944's driver's seat has a hole
(about 2 inches across) on the outside bottom bolster and is starting to
fray on the side bolster. A combination of sports seats, a door which
needs to open very wide to allow easy ingress and egress, and my
(over)weight have caused this.

	My local Porsche dealers can only sell me the material (which has
no guarantee of a perfect colour match) in 1 metre (39 inces for those who
still use Imperial measures!) lengths at approximately 80 UK pounds. I have
been quoted about the same amount again for labour. The cloth takes a
*long* time to order (17 weeks in the case of a friend whose 911 had gone
the same way).

	So, 160 pounds seems like a lot of money to repair a 2" hole, but
the car looks bad (and is getting worse). I've been watching the PCGB
small ads for a piece of material (I don't need anything like a metre),
but no luck so far (I just missed one piece, so another may yet turn up).

Philip

P.S. I'm still thinking about that earlier post which said that "quality"
was a major factor for buying Porsche, but belts, water pumps, engine
mounts, sunroofs, etc (on a 944) all seem to be problem areas! Ho hum.

Sure I can.  I doubt that Japan captured very much of Porsche's market
share at all.  Since '90, Porsches have been in the $40K+ range
(OK, $39.8K+).  Again, the only Pacific Rim Knockoff in that range
is the NSX.  I think the VAST majority of the problem lies in the economy
and the luxury tax.  Buyer's with $40K or more are not settling for
$30K cars, they are just waiting it out.

Something here is out of context.  The magazine tests to which you are
referring were done on OEM tires.  Since Acura is delivering the NSX
with RACE compound tires and Porsches come with normal street tires,
it's hardly an objective comparison of the cars, more like a comparison
of the tires.  The magazine editors make note of this, even though
you did not.  Also, if you look at some other statistics, such as
60-0 braking distance after 10 repetitions, the 911 shoots more holes
in the NSX.

My experience with them was less than satisfactory also:

1) They sent the rebuilt unit back to the wrong address (my mechanic
unwittingly wrote his address on paper with another dealer's letterhead;
still, it was clear from the instructions which address to use).

2) The turbo housing was reassembled incorrectly; my mechanic had 
to redo it.

3) They sent back gaskets for the oil lines; the 931 uses o-rings.

This ended up costing me extra labor charges to correct.  With the
(unexpected) cost of the new rotors, the result was a whopping $50
savings over just buying a rebuilt unit locally.

Hi Porschephiles,

Ok, ok, I give in, I am probably guilty of over generalisation when I 
claimed that Porsche motor cars were exceptionally well engineered, 
robust and fun, and therefore represented the triumph of quality
engineering over `cheapness'.

It's just the 911 that has these quality attributes and not 
the 944 if the responses are representative :-).

I do understand that some of the entry level Porsche motor cars 
have had design defects, engine mount problems, water pump trouble,
etc etc. Well thats the kind of thing that happens when the designers
do something really daft like putting the engine 
in the front, and then cooling it with WATER!  I think that Porsche 
are working on this fundamental design flaw, and all models will be a 
sensible rear-engine design in the near future.

then use a little tar remover to polish up what is left. This is too slow.
I will never get it off this way. 

Does anyone know of something like tar remover that will take off sticky
residue without hurting the paint?

Any ideas welcome.

It would be interesting to see what _does_ cause Porschephiles to buy a 
Porsche, and why. For me, there was no one factor: but a combination of 
price, looks, driving comfort, availability of parts, and euphoria.
     
I never seriously considered a Corvette, mainly because I didn't need the 
complimentary box of Clearasil which came with it. Besides, any Detroit 
iron... eh, too hard to get parts in Europe. Ditto Japanese, and a bad 
experience with a 280ZX (... my ex got it... I hope it exploded). Porsche 
seemed to be the proper combination of mechanical excellence, engineering 
sophistication, value, and fun.
     
I've got an '86 928S and an '83 944 ("Fun with Water Sports") which cruise 
comfortably all day at 100+ miles per hour. I get out of the 928 after a 
700-mile stretch and I don't pee blood. German drivers vacate the left 
lane when a Porsche comes up behind them; they ignore a Mazda or Nissan 
300ZX or Saab 9000 Turbo as if it were a Fiat 500. Status? Yeah, if you 
mean being taken seriously by other serious drivers. 
     
Then there are the other bennies. When I pull up to a European hotel 
entrance the doorman treats the Porsche.. and Porsche driver .. VERY 
seriously. (Not sucking up, but awareness that they will be rewarded based 
on how the car is treated.) They tend not to care about lesser cars. I've 
only seen one 'vette over here, and that driver had to submit to mandatory 
hormone testing to ensure he'd started puberty.
     
OK, enough of this folderol. But, there still is no substitute.

Hey gang,

Anybody out there taken a 944 speedo apart?

Not just from the dash, but taking the unit apart?  Looks to me like
the front has to come off of the casing, because the only way out the
back looks like cutting the casing.

NO, I'm not messing with the odometer; I have a spare that I want to
take apart to see how it works inside.

Sorry for tagging along here, but I would have to say that in keeping two
Porsches (one H2O, one no H2O) that the frustration level is just as high
as when I owned two Toyotas.  I was told by the owner of the place where I
bought my second Toyota that he didn't want to see me or my car again - he
was tired of his mechanics fixing the same problems over and over again :)
(fortunately for me the zone office was in the same town and another dealer 
was forced to attempt to fix the car).  And the problems I had with my 
Toyotas were just as major as the things that go wrong with Porsches.  
And I am not alone in my frustration with Toyota; both my parents had 
Toyotas and don't want another, and neither do I.  When I had my father's 
Toyota on the east coast (Connecticut) and the wheels were stolen the police 
commented that they were surprised the car wasn't stolen.  My father's 
response  "I wish they had."

So, if you think switching brands makes the engineering problems disappear,
dream on.  The engineers are just as overconstrained by their management.
I could attempt to explain the high cost of military jet fighters here, but I 
won't.  Remember, engineers don't get the final say in a project...  But,
they are the first to be blamed when there is a problem.  

My complaint with both Toyota and Porsche is that the mechanics that we
pay to service our cars either don't know the proper parts, procedures, or 
don't have the required skills and expertise to do the job correctly.  Which
does not imply or preclude an engineering or manufacturing problem.

So buy what you want, and deal with the repair bills.

I ran into some sticky stuff when I was working on my 928.  Someone had used 
this black sticky tar to hold the bottom door jam panel on.  I used several 
methods to get it off.

1) It was fairly thick, so I used a knife to cut its thickness down by half.

2) After I had it trimmed down, I used the cut off "Ball-O-Goo" to pull the 
remainder off with, by pressing it into the "still attached goo" then 
pulling it away.  However, I did loose some finger prints in that process. 
Not only did the goo stick well to a Porsche, it worked well on fingers too. 
 Perhaps it would be great for holding a driver in his seat?

3) Rubbing alcohol seemed to loosen it up also, but also changed to goo to a 
sloppy mess.

4) Very good quality duct tape also worked as in method #2, plus saved the 
finger prints on the ends of my fingers.  But the taped seemed to work best 
on very minor thin amounts of this unknown goo.

Please note, that the above are all my reckless methods and are not 
recommended on any Porsche, so if you try them, your on your own...and you 
did say "any ideas welcome"... Good luck.

The ring around the front comes off. With a very narrow screwdriver bend
the ring up a LITTLE bit inside (see picture). Go all the way around a
couple of times then the front will come off.
                                                                            
     Put a screwdriver under the ">" symbol and bend it up very carefully.
Do this every 1/8" or so all the way around. It will come off and it is
possible to put it back together it you don't scratch anything

Subject: 914: Just one more thing

I've just got one more thing to do to get my 914 on the road!
It's just a little thing...getting the engine to run.

It's a 1975 914 - fuel injection.

Actually, it ran fine several months ago when I bought it and drove it into my
garage. I came striaght from the mechanic's (who went over it and got it into a
"safe" condition -- there really wasn't much wrong with it. He just gave it a
good going over).

So after a few months of interior and exterior work, with occasional startups
just to keep ME going 8-), here's what it does:

 - Starts OK. Have to grind a bit, but I may just not be used to how to start
  it (when to pump, when not to...)

 - It idles...er...purrs just fine

 - It's REAL SMOOTH when it's running from 3000-5000 RPM (I was impressed)

 - (the problem) With it idling when you press down on the pedal (or work
  the throttle from the engine compartment) the RPMs drop way off (like to
  about 2 RPM 8-), it coughs, sputters, and 1) sometimes dies if you don't
  do anything, or 2) eventually (about 3-4secs) recovers and comes up to
  a higher RPM. When sitting at the new RPM if you try to speed it up again
  the same thing happens. After it levels out, etc.

Once the RPMs are around 2000+ it does the same thing, but the RPMs drop off a
few hundred and then it recovers (it doesn't go all the way down to 2 RPM).
When trying to go up in what would seem to be small increments (what do I know?
My other car is a beat up old Honda) I seem to be able to get it to level off a
couple of steps between 1000 and 2000, but then the next place I can get it to
settle is about 3300 RPM. Once it's running fast I can bring it back down
smoothly. I've let it warm up, but still does the same thing.

If this thing had a carburetor I think I'd know what to check. It's like the
accelerator pump is working overtime and trying to flood the engine. But...
Like I said it ran pretty good at one time even with the "bad" hoses.

The mechanic told me to bring it back and he'd fix whatever I broke. But that's
no fun...I'd rather fix this small (hope hope) problem myself!

I've checked all of the hoses, in fact I replaced them all (as you guy's
"suggested" -- talk about peer pressure 8-) when I found most of them to be
what I would consider loose. But it was doing this before I changed them. I
went through a mountain of rags cleaning the engine...so it could be just about
anything.

I don't have a Haynes manual yet (but one is on order -- thank you Pam!).

Any ideas?

Thanks! (he said, drooling on the 8 coats of wax, and sitting behind the
wheel making engine noises)

Turbo City rebuilt my '86 951 turbocharger about 2 years ago, and it 
runs perfectly. I believe they charged $300US.  They even dipped it or 
something - it came back looking nearly new.

If you mean the housing needed to be swiveled: This was true on mine 
too, but think about it: how do they know the exact alignment of your 
input/output exhaust pipes?  (If that wasn't your problem then nevermind...)

To Fix, you loosen 8-ish screws and swivel the intake to line up - it's 
easy!  I did it after my turbo was partially reinstalled.  Takes 5 minutes.

Not to defend Turbo City, but I think that not all perceived problems 
are actually faults; sometimes that's just how stuff works.

Bob Greschke was talking about his problems with the RPMs.  I don't know if
this is really appropriate, but I remember experiencing a "rev limiter"
in older VWs.  It was nothing more than a special rotor button which had
a sliding weight.  As the button spun faster, that weight would slide toward
the outside, and cut off the ignition.  

I have NEVER seen one of those in a 914 (bought mine new in '74), but
it is possible.

I use WD-40.

Spray it on, let it sit, wipe it off.
You probably need to wax over the spot(s) afterwards.

WD-40 also keeps your wheelbarrow from rusting.
Spray it on and spead it to an even layer with a rag.
Re-apply after every use.

From: pfile (Porschephiles Mailer)
Subject: Monthly Update from Your Moderator

October 1993

Monthly Notices for the Porschephiles mailing list. 
PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE MESSAGE!!

There are five sections: UPDATE, COPYRIGHT, FTP-INFO, CLUB-INFO, RULES. Be sure
that you are current on RULES...

UPDATE

Here it is -- the promised "Big News" I promised last month:

I'm in the process of leaving Technology Transfer Associates and starting up
a new software company -- NetSmiths, Ltd --  with fellow Porschephile
Fred Pack and his partner from UniPress, Mark Krieger. Fred and Mark aren't
leaving UniPress -- I'm just leaving TTA. As hard as I have worked to 
start and establish TTA, I just wouldn't casually go off on something
unproven. This is *REALLY* exciting stuff, as we are going to market NOW
with state-of-the-art software acquired from IBM's T.J. Watson Research 
Center.  This is not the place to talk about my new product, but if you're
interested, shoot me anote and I'll be happy to bore you with it...

Now the bad part: I'm travelling a *HUGE* amount, even for me. I will be
out of Houston  for just about the whole rest of the year. The good news
is that's I'm just a telnet away, the bad news is I'm so busy I just don't
have time to deal with porschephiles on the "constant attention" basis
you've seen in the past. 

So, what does this mean for you?

1) adds, drops, and changes will take at least a one day turn-around.
   No more than a three day turn around, but *AT LEAST* one day.

2) while I'm still available to help anyone with anything, it may take 
   me a day or so to get back to you

3) I'll leave most of the commentary and tech  help  to others. If I
   can just  dash off a note on something quickly, I will but if it needs
   my off-line library for help, and I'm not in Houston, nope, not this week...

Oh, my "normal" e-mail and phone continue to work (you'll get my voice mail
on the phone). New e-mail (stan@netsmiths.com) will be up as soon as we can get
some paperwork turned around at the InterNIC.  My phone number in New Jersey
is (908) 287-8070 -- you may get voice mail there too.

Am I moving? Let's just say "it depends". But nothing will happen until
at least Feb '94 at the earliest.

COPYRIGHT AND FAIR USAGE STATEMENT

The messages sent to this list constitute private correspondence by and between
members of a closed community. As such, the copyright for EVERYTHING that 
ANYONE posts lies with them. PERIOD. This is *NOT* a bulletin board system,
where consent for further redistribution is implied by nature of the the
system; it's PRIVATE.

If you wish to use something written by someone on the list, you must first
seek their permission unless they specifically grant the right in that
specific posting to reprint it at will. And, in general, it is a VERY GOOD
idea to *CREDIT* someone if you use something by permission "copyright xxxx
Joe Gearhead, used by permission" to keep *SOMEONE ELSE* from screwing up
down the line.

You may also solicit articles, comments, notes and expansions of previous
notes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Remember, when you read something on this list: what you are reading belongs
to whoever wrote it. They may have plans to publish it further themselves.
They may want to keep it "private" (i.e. just for list member use). They 
may not care what gets done with it. It's still theirs, and before re-use,
permission must be obtained.

Please respect people's rights, even if they don't make a big deal about it.
I mean it.

FTP-INFO

Archives are available via FTP, compressed, since 4/90. There are no
older archives available. Remember, while it seems like a good idea when 
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before, 
there are OVER 7 MEG of archives. DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. 
Period!!! And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or I'll 
have to take access away. We do have to get *SOME* work done around here, 
you know...  Also DO NOT ask me to mail you archives, since it's just too 
much work. Thank you.

Images from a variety of sources are available as well, in /pub/images.
There is an UPLOAD directory there as well, if you have images that you'd
like to upload. Please include a file called "from.<username>", where
<username> is your logon ID that describes the files if possible.

NOTE: To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY mode in FTP. 
Then on receipt, you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program, or equivalent,
to restore to textual format.

SECOND NOTE: if you really, really need to get a full set of archives, 
we have a business services group which could write you a tape for a fee.
Let me know if you really, really need that.


CLUB-INFO

RULES

This list is still being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming
mail to the whole list at once. The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  

To send a message to the whole list, mail to

		porschephiles@tta.com

To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other administrative issues,
send mail to

		porschephiles-request@tta.com

If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you feel
moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request" address.

The list is also available as a digest, where you get a compilataion of
the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all of the individual
messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow mail links or who
are just too busy to stay current. If you want to convert to (or from)
the digest, send mail to the porschephiles-request address above.

PLEASE NOTE A FEW ITEMS:

1) There are a lot of  members on the list. It's small enough to be effective,
   and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and sets of
   experience. Remember that before you decide to not ask a question, or
   if you get flamed for asking an "obvious" question. Diversity -- it's
   a *feature*....

2) The list is maintained irregularly. If I'm in town or can reach the
   host system from wherever I am and I have the time to deal with it,
   I *try* to handle changes on a real-time basis. However, as a consultant
   I travel extensively and from time to time, changes will be batched
   on a weekly basis.

3) ONLY send administrative mail to the "porschephiles-request"
   address, or to me directly. And, you can also reach me by phone 
   at (800) 582-6892.

4) In the same vein, if you use a "pure" System V mail system, please pay
   attention to your replies. The default will send the reply to 
   the "porschephiles-request" address, as it is the UUCP "From "
   address (first actual line of the mail header). 

   PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I ROUTINELY TRASH SUCH MIS-ROUTED MAIL!!!

5) If your mailer starts screwing up *you will be dropped from the list*
   Should you notice that you aren't getting the list any more, send me
   mail and I'll figure out why not...

Enjoy the list! If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to drop
me a note.

The D-Jetronic FI system (i.e. all 914 but 1.8L) implements the 
"accelerator pump" function with a series of alternating fingers on
a printed wiring board associated with the throttle assembly. As the
throttle is moved, a sliding wiper traverses these fingers, creating
a sequence of additional pulses which squirt additional fuel from
the injectors. It is easy to see how this fails lean on transition-
an open in the circuit prevents these extra pulses. It is harder to
see how it fails excessively rich. Your symtoms could well be based
on being lean, although they sound severe enough that the engine
may already be quite lean before the transition. Does it have reasonable
power at a steady RPM? If the problem is overall lean, a good place
to start is the fuel pressure (should be 28 PSI, if memory serves).
If you have other reasons to believe that it is rich (like black
smoke), try the cylinder head temp. sensor (near Cyl. 3). look for
a disconnected or shorted wire, and measure the resistance of the
sender (which is a thermistor).

Subject: 928 Temperature Controls


Thanks to all who helped me get the radio out of my 928.

Now, another problem :

Intermittently, there is a very high pitched whine from somewhere under the
dash.  It sounds like the noise made by stretching the openning of a ballon
very tightly and releasing the air slowly.  The noise will stop when the air
flow control is moved from side to side, but doesn't always stop.

I was told by the local dealership that there was a vacuum leak somewhere in
the system.

Has anyone else experience this or a similar problem ?

Any advice as to how to alleviate this problem ?

i.e. Do I need to remove the temperature / air flow control unit, and is
there an easy way to perform this operation ?

Thanks in advance,

Matt

Hello there!

As I am just above to restore my 356's I would appreciate some information

I know of Restoration Design, Stoddards, PAP, Zims, Tweeks and more.

But I am told the best panels are made in Denmark!!
And as some of you perhaps have noted I do live in NORWAY.

If I wanted to buy from this source I would much rather get it DIRECT from
Denmark,and save the 2 transatlantic crossings involved in ordering this
stuff from Zims.(who actually has the Danish panels for sale!!!!)

If anyone has this manufacturers identity or address, name, anything that

Sounds like it could be a broken spring on the mechanical
advance in the base of the distributor. You can have the 
distributor checked in or out of the car at a specialty
shop, or check the advance with a timing light and compare
it against the specs for your car. 

As previously posted, some cars had a governor built into the
rotor. One of mine kicked in at about 4,500 RPM with the 
symptoms you mentioned, and I just disabled the moving part.
I don't think that could be your problem UNLESS the spring
is missing. As the rotor goes around, there is a part that 
pushes outward against spring pressure until it touches a 
metal tab and either grounds or breaks the circuit (I can't
remember which)

Subject: Proper Lubrication...

Hello!

The mention of distributors in a previous message reminded me of my
favorite Preventative Maintenance Tip.  This applies to basically any
distributor on any car, water-cooled, air-cooled, whatever, that has a
mechanical advance mechanism.  If anyone has any exceptions, I'd be interested
in know about them...

I had a problem with my 2.7l 911S.  When cold it would crank and crank but
eventually start.  It ran fine except that it would sometimes sputter and die
at stop signs.  Major problem.  It would start again if I got out, took off
the distributor cap, ran a clean dollar bill between the points, and then
reassembled.  There was a large amount of black carbon powder (from the cap)
all through the distributor.

Finally, I took out the distributor and had a look.  The view from the 
inspection port revealed the problem:  a thrust washer had come apart and 
was tangled up in the advance mechanism (springs and weights).  Further
inspection revealed that the washer remains were blued from heat.  An obvious
case of insufficient lubrication.

This is what happened (as far as my mechanic and I could make out):  The shaft
and other components had not been lubricated (more on this later).  The washer
came apart and was holding the distributor too far advanced - thus it was hard
to start and would die as the revs came down.  The shaft had too much vertical
play (big tip-off to my mechanic) so it was jumping up and down, wearing out
the little carbon tip in the distributor cap.  Thus, the carbon was a symptom,
not a cause, of my problem.  The shaft was begining to bind to the distributor
body - very bad medicine here:  It may be unlikely but what if it had actually
bound up?  It's very bad to have gears and stuff flying around in a 911 engine
case!  We found very similar problems in his stock-pile of old *S* distributors,
not so much in *E* or *T* distributors.

My solution was a new distributor.  Pricey but it came ready to drop in and
has worked like charm.

Now, THE BIG LESSON:  Lubricate your distributor!  How?  Simple.

1) Take off the rotor button.  This is much easier if you first turn off the
motor and then remove the distributor cap. :-)

2)  Put two drops of oil on the small felt pad that is in the shaft (under the
rotor button).  I use 30W but anything is better than nothing.  Don't use too
much or the oil will get where it's not supposed to! (as in on the points!)

3) Reassemble and enjoy your car.  

4) Repeat every six months or so.

Thanks go to Marc at Hans Wittler's Automotive in Albuquerque, NM for helping
me out with this problem.  I recommend these guys for people in that area.
Also, thanks to Mickey at the dealer in ABQ, European Imports, for confirming
that they do this with every major service.  Two very good mechanics, IMO.

Distributor lubrication is something that most DIY people I know overlook.
I know I did and so did the previous owner of my car!  

That's all for now...  Comments from the group?

After I tracked my new 928GTS last Feb I found that all the duct tape goo
(and tyre rubber/tar!) that had touched the paintwork had stuck. I found tar
remover ineffective, besides it seemed to have a minor abrasive in it!
I searched around the garage for some kind of a solvent that would remove all
this stuff and not damage my paintwork. I found that regular mineral spirits
worked great! I tested it on a small part of the paintwork well under the car
by leaving some on for 5 minutes, as I didn't believe that this wouldn't
harm the paint. I then rubbed it with a white cloth to make sure absolutely
nothing was being removed ... perfect!

Still being extremely cautious I tried some on the inconspicuous parts first.

Anyway the result was that (in my case at least) it easily removed the
offending goo and did not leave any marks or scratches on my paintwork.

My paint colour is Indischrit?sp Indian Red/Guards Red.

Let me know if it works for you.

Hey, folks.
    The next installment in the wonderful saga of the '74 914 1.8L
Fuel System --
    I have an intermittent problem when on the road in my car.  It
usually happens when I'm running at speed--not accelerating or de-
celerating.  The symptom is that the power just *goes*.  Like I lifted
my foot completely off the throttle.  Or possibly more so.  If I keep
my foot where it is, often I can feel the power cutting back in and out
rapidly.  Sometimes, though, it just says out.  I can get it back by
pressing the accelerator down, but it comes back as soon as I let off.
Stomping the gas with the clutch in (voooOOOOOmmmmm) cures the
problem for seeveral minutes or more.  This can happen shortly after
I start driving, after 90 minutes of fun mountain roads, or any time
in between, it seems.
    Speculation:  Dirty injectors.  Anyone agree or disagree?
    What do folks recommend for a solution?  I'm probably going to
go out at lunch (soon) and get some fuel additive.

I bought the last 3 books because I was expecting lots of technical info
on my car like schematics and little tricks to keep my car running 
without having to go to a mechanic or a dealer. 

I was kind of disappointed when they didn't teach me anything I didn't
already know. They are just reprints of the question and answer section 
from Pano. There is a lot of duplication. The problem is that the 
authors of the answers are very careful about what they say. The 
porschephiles here on the net are much more free with advice on how to do 
something that might not be kosher with dealers or PCNA.  

I wouldn't send them back as they are a good reference, but my personal 
opinion is that the current net and the archives are a much better source of
information on our cars than any manual.(even *Upfixin Der Porsche*)

They do have interesting reading on the older cars that I would like to
start getting into before they get too expensive even for us.

Dave,
     I am not an expert mechanic by any means, so take the following for
what its worth :-)
     I had a very similar problem with my 72 914 a few years back. I also
suspected the injectors and tried Techron etc. all to no avail. Then, on
the advice of a friend who IS a Porsche mechanic, I yanked the distributor
and took out the FI clocking points at the bottom of it. The points were
dirty. Using carb cleaner and cardboard from a match book, I carefully
cleaned them, reinstalled everything... checked the timing. (Make sure you
mark the orientation of the distributor before removing it!) and the car
ran like a champ. My friend then told me that the clocking points usually
need to be cleaned every few seasons and often the spring's will lose their
tension and need to be replaced. If cleaning the injectors doesn't work,
I'd check the FI clocking points. Good luck!

I think there is more to this. If I remember correctly, the small felt
pad only provides lubrication to the rotating connection between the
cam and the distributor shaft, which change in angular orientation by 
perhaps 10-15 degrees, driven by the distributor weights. I don't
think it also lubricates the bushing where the shaft meets the
distributor body, which sounds like the one which caused your blued
washer. However, in thinking about it, I'm not sure how the
body-shaft bushing is lubricated. It is certainly subject to splash
on the inside, but is there more than that?

Subject: 911 valve adjust tool query

Hi All,

I've decided to break down and buy one of the gadgets that holds 
a dial indicator to the valve rocker during a (911) valve 
adjustment, the alternative to feeler gauges.

A few questions:

1)      Has anyone actually used one of these?

2)      Is there a particular brand/distributor to look for or
        to avoid?

3)      Can you actually see the dial for all valves?

4)      How about with A/C?

Currently I'm using one of the angled feeler gauges with the 
replaceable tip.  It's an improvement over a standard feeler
gauge, but it's still a pain.  Typically I just loosen the lock
nut and reset each valve clearance as this is usually faster than
working (by brail) the gauge into the gap.  I'm looking to reduce 
the time and frustration.  

Am I on the right track?

This is critical; my girlfriend is also driving a 911 now and I 
can forsee **a lot** of valve adjustments in my future...

 Failure mode is to send the fuel injection "full rich". Stupid design.
 Kills the motor instantly. Check the sensor and the wire to the sensor
 from the harness (it's hidden down near the #3 cylinder on my 1.7).
 Don't know if the design of the 1.8 is the same.. I suspect it is.

 One sure sign is if your car coughs out a cloud of black smoke on

EEEEE!!!! EEEEP!!! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson!

This is akin to lubricating your points wear block when you change points.
In principle, you say "hmmm. sounds good, cuts down on friction, etc. --
I'll do it!" In practice, you wind up slinging lubrogoop *ALL OVER* 
the inside of your distributor cap, which hoses up your ignition
to no end. 

And yes, you *DO* need to lube the "cam lube wick" when you change points,
and there is a special Bosch lube *JUST FOR THAT*. But I've almost never
seen someone from the Age of Electronic Ignition get the right amount in
the right place...

If you *REALLY* needed to lube the inside of the distributor, wouldn't it 
be listed in the service schedule??? *THINK* about it. (And while you're
thinking about it, look at the *bottom* of a distributor -- the oil comes 
up through there, from inside the case!)

Perhaps it's a youngish 50 year old driver, but more probably
the car was a mere $50K. (Kind of goes with "My other car is a
930 Cabro")

I was thinking of VESPIDA (yellow jacket) for plates on my

probably should end in AE but too many characters. VESPA is

Good advice! If these points are regularly getting fouled
with oil, the distributor shaft bushing is shot. Another 
indication is little brass shavings (or brass dust) on the
dust cover under the distributor cap. The rotor will wobble
and chew things up a bit. It can get quite bad before you
start to have problems.

Subject: 944 Belts and Insurance


Sorry I haven't responded sooner, but I'm a bit behind on my porschephiles
reading.

First, wrt the 944 belt hitting the cover. There was a bulletin from PCNA
(I saw it copied in the Porsche Spiel from PNW region) that our early '83
944s should have part of the reinforcing ribs on the inside of the belt
cover removed so the belt won't rub when there's a bit of slack (which there
shouldn't be right after adjusting). The article probably appeared 5-7 years
ago; I don't know if I have a copy still (I can look if someone is interested).

Second, the insurance offered for Porsches only. When the insurance was first
offered, it had restrictions like no shopping, no leaving it in an unlocked
parking area, etc. About six months later they had deleted those restrictions
and the major ones kept were no driving it to work (I don't recall about
school, since it didn't apply in my case) and limited mileage (but they would 
give you a special exemption on the mileage if you were driving to PCA events).
I don't have the insurance so I can't tell you more (some people in my region
have it and are happy with the price; they have never made a claim so I don't
know about that aspect).

Subject: Is a porsche still the premier sports car?


all my adult life I have wanted a Porche 930 - mostly because I viewed
the car as one of the best sports cars on the market - but now that I
have a chance to get one, I am questioning my goal. It appears that
the rest of the world has caught porsche and I have just been slow to
re-evaluate my goal.

Heres the deal - I am looking at 3 cars and I am interested in hearing
what the porsche world thinks of the decision I need to make (as well
as any factors that I missed) -

Also - here are the things that mean a lot to me in a car -

1. I love to drive hard.  I do not drive "dangerously" but my 1990
eagle talon TSI AWD (0-60 6.3, 1/4 mile in 15.0 and .91 on the skid
pad) sees the red-line several times a day (on a good day).

2. I am into "g" force.  I like to corner hard and accelerate hard (my
accelerator hits the floor several times a day).

3. I am considering taking my next car to the track for some serious
driving enjoyment.

4. Based on the above, I am looking for a car with some more power
(and handling).

The cars are:

1. 1993 RX-7 - this is the quickest and lightest car of the bunch.  It
has the fastest 0-60 (5.3) and the highest skidpad (.99).

2. 1993 3000 GT VR4 - this has the fastest slalom speed (68.7).  All
wheel drive makes it great in the winter (I live in Oregon).

3. 1987 Porsche 930 - definately the sharpest looking of the bunch but
also the most miles (60K). Expect the most maintenance costs here.

The question is - have the newer cars really built a better sports car
(0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad and slalom) or am I missing something. At the
risk of being flamed, it sounds like the rx7 and the vr4 will out
perform the 1987 930 (I do not have 0-60 or 1/4 mile times for the 930 but
I am assuming somewhere in the mid to upper 5 second range (5.7 or so)
and somewhere in the 14 second quarter mile range).

Help me out here folks - are there advantages to the 930 other than
the looks and the name?

thanks -

Even if you get the fastest car today, it won't be the fastest tomorrow.  At
that point, what's your taste in cars?  Do you date them or marry them?  If
you are shopping for a car you plan to own for 7, 10, 20 years, this is much
more realistic with a Porsche.  The evidence is only inductive, of course,
but we have reason to expect that when the 87 930 is 20 years old there will
parts, expertise, interest, a market, and a running car to talk about.  Less
clearly so for the Japanese products, however close to the state of the art

Why do these numbers matter? IMO, all that matters is whether you have fun
in the car. If for example the Mitsubishi is faster than the others but
feels heavy and cumbersome compared to the others, why would you want it??

Whether or not some guy got the accelerometer an extra .05g higher in one
car than what some OTHER guy got in another car on the skidpad probably 
won't be reflected in your enjoyment of either car.

Drive em and see which one FEELS good.

Hey, seems to me like Jay _was_ asking for advice.  Buying a car is a tough

You always have to be careful with skidpad numbers.  They depend heavily 
on the tires the car was equipped with and the driver as well as how difficult 
a car is to drive on a skidpad.  The RX-7 is a great handling and fast little 
car - and for the money (presently you can get a new one for little over 
$25k) it's a heckuva deal.  The 930 for example is much harder to skidpad 
due to the rear weight bias.  I remember reading at one time how a bunch of 
magazine editors & test drivers got together with some race-car driver and 
skidpad tested the same car.  Most of the magazine folks got 
something like .88 to .92 out of the car (a rear-drive GT car - don't remember 
which) - but the pro circled at .98 or something like that.  It's not just driving 
in a circle for sure!

Except for bad weather street driving I recommend heavily against the 
3000GT and it's siblings.  These cars are extremely HEAVY - and though 
they are powerful, they don't pack the same punch as an RX-7, 930, Vette, 
etc.  They are VERY sluggish on the track due to the weight.  Also, they 
have lotsa problems with the clutch and transmission.  Four wheel drive is 
hard on the car - you gotta launch at high-rpm to go fast and this tears up 
your car.  I'm sure you know some of this from the Talon.  Now imagine 
doing the same with 100 more horses and 1000lbs more weight.

> 3. 1987 Porsche 930 - definately the sharpest looking of the bunch but
> also the most miles (60K). Expect the most maintenance costs here.
What can I say - classic, rare, fast.  Certainly means more maintenance 
and maybe a bit less performance.  But it's still a Porsche.  If speed is you 
main concern - don't get the 930.  But if you care about looks, exclusivity, 
resale value, quality, superior engineering, etc. then this is the one.  It's 
also more challenging to the driver - it takes a lot of skill to make a 930 go 
fast, but when you get there - it's worth it.  Look back at Road & Track last 
year (I'm pretty sure I have the issue somewhere) - they had a test where 
Danny Sullivan drove ten different GT/sports cars on the track.  That's the 
real test you need to look for.  0-60 and skidpad numbers are just that - 
numbers.  A car with lotsa acceleration isn't necessarily gonna be best on 
the track.  Neither is a car with lotsa handling.  A truly fast car is a 
BALANCED car.  Good brakes, good balanced handling, good power, 
torque...  Anyhow - Danny chose the 911 Turbo ('91 model) over the NSX, 
Vette, RX-7, 3000GT - because he thought it was the most fun and the 
fastest when driven properly.
To summarize, I think you've narrowed the field well - I'd bypass the 
Diamond stars, the Toyota Supra Turbo (too expensive), and the likes.  
Sounds like depending on what you REALLY want outta the car you'd be 
best served with an RX-7 or the 930.  If you want to get REALLY serious 
about speed buy yourself a late model Vette (the torque is wonderful 
and the handling is superb - now if only the quality could catch up) and build 
the engine a bit.  It's the cheapest and easiest car to make super-fast - 
lotsa cubic inches you know.  But you got the right idea.  So go for it - good 
luck!

Subject: 930 Everyday Car

Sorry I took so long to get back to this.

There was a discrepancy between two articles on performance of
the 3.6 930. One stated that the 3.6 Turbo has ~60 HP more than
the an 86 930 and the other stated that the 87 930 has 282 hp and
the 3.6 Turbo has 320 HP. 

The 930 horsepower rating for the US 86/87 and all the surrounding
years is between 280 and 285 HP (Euro version at 300HP).

The discrepancy is in the 3.6 Turbo Numbers, both were low.
The car rags put the horsepower at 360 HP. The
Panorama numbers for the standard street version (there
are two other prepared versions with much larger HP numbers)
are as follows;

Horsepower	355 hp @ 5500 rpm
Torque		384 ft.lbs. @ 4200 rpm
0 - 60 mph	4.7 seconds

Many, many, many, most of which don't translate into
the usual data tables in car mags. Like the sound and
fury of a flat 6 turbo at 6,500 RPM (see what I mean - nothing)
but sit in one and experience it instead of reading about
and it's a life-changing experience.

re: flat-out cornering, a friend of mine with piles of
track experience followed a new RX-7 onto an exit ramp
at (legal x 1.9) or so, and watched the RX-7 out his side
window all the way around. I've seen him do the downhill
at Lime Rock flat-out without flinching, so I don't think
driving skill was a major factor.

You have to look at the total driving experience, however.
For me, the 911 was more of an emotional rather than 
logical choice. (whenever I forget, my wife reminds me)

Subject: 930 vs. others

Jay,

Vicarious enjoyment of the purchase of a 930?  Sure, I'll bite.

In deciding which of many competent cars to acquire, everyone has their own set 
of needs to fill, be they lower needs (e.g., saving money) or higher needs 
(e.g., social, status).  In my own experience with a somewhat similar choice, I 
found that I made the correct choice with a used 928 as compared to a new RX7 
(this was in about '88).

Once it was all over (and the 928 sold), I realized (rationalized?) my purchase 
in the following manner:

	My initial cost was the same for either choice.
	Interest expense was higher for the 928.
	Resale value was a bit better for the 928 (would be more so for 930).
	Insurance was much less for the 928 (may not be for 930). 
	Maintenance expense was more for the 928.

When I ran the numbers, my total expenditure was virtually identical for the
two choices.  And I had a 928 for five years to enjoy as compared to a common
car!  And, in the final analysis, all I gave up was the extra time spent 
socializing with Porsche mechanics.

However you decide to go, good luck.

I'm looking to purchase my first Porsche.  I have about 27K to spend.  I 
initially wanted a Speedster (57 or 58),  but  I have had trouble finding 
one in an acceptable condition that I could afford.  So I broadened my 
search to include all convertible 356's.  I'm looking for one that is fairly 
original cosmetically and in good working order. I plan on driving the car 5 
 - 6000 miles a year,  so I don't want to have to do a lot of work on the car 
initially.  

I've done some research on the subject.  I've read Illustrated Porsche

Porsche 356 1952-1965, and back issues of Excellence. I've looked at a bunch 
of cars and am now ready to buy,  but I would first like to get the input 
from some Porsche owners with real experience.  I'm interested in any 
comments or suggestions you may have.  I would also like comments on which 
model years, engines, extras, etc. that you prefer and why. What I should 
look out for and/or avoid. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I think you're going to find yourself spending a lot more time fiddling
with the dial gauge than it would take to stick with the feeler.  How
often do you adjust your valves, and why is your girlfriend's driving
going to push up the need to adjust them?

Everyone's had enough of bandwidth of my opinions of
teutonic vs. pacific road metal, so I'll stick to some
objective facts to consider, if you are at a subjective
impasse.

Look at NADA, NAR, or Blue Book values of the cars you
are considering over the past few years.  You'll see
that an '87 930 is past the depreciation hump, where
the RX-7 and Stealth depreciation is going to be all
yours.

Look at who's racing and who's winning in the showroom
stock racing series:
	The 930's are cleaning house in the supercar
series, against older RX-7's.
	The new RX-7's arer sweeping their class,
because that's about the only car in it (no one else
foolish enough to challenge it), but no Porsche's
eligible for that class.
	NOBODY's racing stealths (gotta wonder why?)

Lest I be accused of being prejudiced (who, me?),
I must say that if they passed a law saying I couldn't
own a Porsche, I would get an RX-7 with the R-1 option.
I think it's the most focused sports car to come
from the Pacific yet.  And with those new chips from
Autothority for an extra 100 HP, well...

It's because we're in such a hurry all the time in Europe...
No, seriously I think it has to do with the different emmission rules.

The US cars have to meet the Californian regulations which always have

It's mostly because of the pollution emission standards in North America

The catalytic converter and other emission control systems
add more weight to the car.

Leonardo,

The major issue in that time frame was the quality of the gasoline. In the 944 
we had lower compression and a less aggressive advance curve. This was also 
done on the Carrera and the 930 (911 Turbo). 

Some later cars have no differences as the gasoline did get better, though 
that's a subjective call. 

Porsche never ships too much power, then no one else does either. BTW, has anyone
noticed that a 150HP 944 weighing 2900 pounds still has better actual road 
performance than some of the `paper tigers'? It can also go to the track and not 
trash the drivetrain in the process and the brakes still work.  That's the 
extra cost option that's mandantory. Not bad for an $8,000 used car. 

A used 944 is still cheaper and a hell of a lot more fun than anything else out 
there.

I think that it traditionally was the additional emissions controls
that were placed on the cars. They need to change the _tune_ and 
add _smog pumps_ to meet US emissions. For later model cars though,
I think that there is no longer a difference. Can anyone else verify
that?

Subject: 911 Valve Adjustment

I'd like to give a strong second to the recommendation
for adjusting valves with a dial indicator. There are two
very good reasons for using these:

1) Accuracy. You simply don't know what the valve lash is
using a feeler guage. I would guess that these are, at
best, 20% accurate, and this assumes you can see what 
your are doing and are in a comfortable environment (hardly
the case in the engine compartment of a 911).
A dial indicator, on the other hand, is substantially more
accurate.

2) History. A seldom appreciated aspect of using dial indicators
to adjust your valves is that you get to find out where they were
before you break the nut loose. This is very useful information
when you suspect you have engine problems.

CAVEATS: With the above points in mind, let me also say that there
are few tools as important as well-trained hands and there are probably
many mechanics (professional and not) who can set valves quite
accurately with feeler guages. I, however, don't do this for a living
and would rather spend a little money on a useful tool which can also
be used for other things (like setting the cams, checking disk rotor
runout, etc).  On the history point, there is a potential problem
from the ``a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing'' school of 
thought. I used to check and readjust my valves at every oil change
for the first 8,000 miles after I rebuilt my 2.2L 911E engine. I found
that about one third had opened up 10%-20%, and so I broke the nut
and reset them. I brought this up with Bruce Anderson one day and he 
suggested that what I was seeing was  a natural ``bedding in''
of the screw/nut/thread combination. There is an equilibirum established
under normal engine running forces in the valve/rocker mechanism. 
You upset this when you break free the valve lash nut.
The point is, they probably move a little intially, and then stay put.
So, you shouldn't get too worried about it.

Anyway, dial indicators are ``fine things.'' I bought mine from
Norbert at Eurometrix several years ago for around $120.00. I have recently
seen them for about $140.00 (inflation). A good quality jeweled dial indicator
costs about $75 and then you have to make a bracket for it. I think the
rig that you get from Eurometrix is just fine for the approximately
$50 you pay for the extra pieces. It also has the adapters to set
the cams (essential when reinstalling cams). Of course, if you have 
access to a machine shop, you could also do it yourself.

The European horsepower is rated according to the DIN (Deutsche Industrie-
normen) standard, while on this continent we use SAE (Society of Automotive
Engineers) specs.  The difference generally works out to 5-6%, meaning
that a 300 hp DIN engine would possibly be rated at 280-285 hp SAE.

Hey, that's what the US engine is rated at!  Could it be the same engine? :)
The older engines had bigger differences than just the SAE/DIN discrepancy,
with often 20-30% power differences after taking the hp conversion into
account.

Jay,

I noticed you are here in Portland but others may be interested in this.

There is a driving school this Saturday at PIR with a classroom session
Friday night.  This is hosted by a local racing club.  Bring your Talon.
It will give you real track experience just fine.  There will be Porsches
out there, maybe a 930 and maybe an RX-7.  e-mail me for more info.

The Oregon region of the PCA is having their annual RainBonnet 
November 5-7.  There will be a concours with lots of different models
represented.  There will be technical discussions.  There is a Porsche
only track day on Sunday.  There will be 356's, 911's (all years),
930's, 944's, 951's.  A couple of these are race cars.  Come out and
get a ride and talk with the owners.

You have been looking at the numbers of the different cars which is
good.  But the numbers won't tell you how the car feels and if you will
like that feeling.  I bought a 92 Integra when they were first out and
got rid of it after 6 months because I couldn't stand the feel of it.
It was not, what I would call, a driver's car.

You also need to look at if you want to keep the car absolutely stock
or add aftermarket performance enhancements to it.  If you don't mind
getting away from stock there are easy upgrades that can be done.
Just ask this list. :-)  As a matter of fact the same can be done for
your Talon.  You will find Porsches are modified far more than RX-7's.
Probably because Porsche drivers find the driving experience to be much
more important than the average driver.

Like someone else already mentioned, weight (3000 GT) is your enemy on
the race track.

I bought my 911 because I fell in love with it.  The look, sound, and
feel are all wonderful.  Learning to drive it well (on the race track)
has been a challenge and a very rewarding experience.

I don't think so - Vespidae is the plural, meaning Yellow Jackets,
and your VESPIDA would be correct for a single instance thereof.
Vespa, on the other hand, is Italian for Wasp (and yes, a brand of

But from a distance it looks great.

Subject: Horsepower-DIN/SAE

   A few words about horsepower specs:

Although the US usually specifies automobile
horsepower according to SAE standards and Europe
uses DIN, this is NOT the reason some Porsches
have less horsepower in the US! It was pointed
out (quite accurately) by someone else in this forum
that due to stricter emissions laws, the US bound
cars had variations on the engines and exhaust
systems. In fact, the type numbers stamped on the engine
cases reveal this. This information is also available in
any of the Technical Specification books for the
model year you are considering. In order to meet emissions
laws in the US many variations were tried over the years
including different distributors (advance curves), 
different ignition timing, different piston/cylinder
sets, different exhaust systems, air pumps, oxygen
sensors, and on and on and on. These differences invariably 
resulted in lower horsepower ratings for the US bound Porsches.
But, rest assured, the factory is on a constant quest for a
one world car, that is, a car that simultaneously meets
all world emissions standards. If you think about it,
it makes complete sense. They save on manufacturing costs by 
having fewer models, and, the customers in places like the US
(their largest market) don't feel like they were cheated out of 
the high performance Euro cars. That simple perception has a profound
impact on marketing. Just consider all the attention in this forum!

One more thing, in the later workshop manuals and technical specifications
books, the engine horsepower is rated in both DIN and SAE terms as well
as the MKS unit of power ``watts''.

As an owner of a Euro 911 who had to research this, I can help:

1) gas differences. Euro models until the mid-late-80s were spec'd
   premium leaded and hence had *much* higher compression. You'd
   be surprised how much difference that, plus different timing,
   will make.

2) on the 911 family, the valve timing is *slightly* retarded from US spec.
   Retarded == more high end, == more measured HP given the way we tend to
   measure HP.

3) air [smog] pumps != EVIL. You can run *A LOT* richer and still have a
   low CO number with a pump, and who's going to miss 2-3 HP on a ~200 HP
   motor?? Particularly when there are other wins from the extra richness.

Playing mix-and-match with parts, still using nothing but stock 911/930
hardware, you can get a Euro 911SC to pass EPA/DOT and make 250HP, up
from the 205 HP a stock Euro SC makes, *WAY* up from the limp 185 HP a
stock US spec SC makes.

If you want the details, I'd be happy to sell you the car *then* tell 
you...

It's quite correct that there are some (actually, many) cars that do
have lower power output on this side of the Atlantic.  Some early
engines really did have 20-30% lower outputs here.

However, many engines today are "world engines" due to improved emissions
technology and tightening regulations in Europe.  And there is a *REAL*
5-6% difference between hp.DIN and hp.SAE ratings for any given engine.

I'm not dufficiently familiar with the '86 930 engine to know whether
this was a world (or "almost-world") engine.  However, since the gap
between the Euro-spec hp.DIN and US-spec hp.SAE is approximately the
same as one would expect from the basic hp.DIN and hp.SAE difference,
I would expect this to be the case.

In fact, the factory has made considerable progress on this front!

The current European practise tends to emphasize the power ratings in 
the SI unit of kW (~1.32 hp.DIN or 1.25 hp.SAE), but hp.DIN is almost
always shown as well.

Subject: a turbo that really smokes

A predicament for the collected wisdom of the Porschephiles to ponder...

I had the turbocharger rebuilt a month ago on my 1980 931.  I
considered going to Turbo City but heard some opinions against it.  I
settled on a local shop, Santa Rosa Diesel, which does some of their
own rebuilds but which farms out KKK products to a third party "guru".

Immediately upon reinstallation, the car smoked (blue oil smoke) like
there was no tomorrow (and no Air Quality Board).  Since then, in
short, I've gone back and forth to SR Diesel and two other shops to
pin down the source of smoke.  I had a turbo oil drain line vent tube
installed by Porsche (it was a factory recall in '83).  I had
compression and leakdown tested (poor but passable).  I put in a new
air filter.  I drove the car to bed in the seals.  I was told the
valve guide seals were likely culprits.

Result: the car still smokes, albeit less so.  It NEVER used to smoke,
not even a little bit.  It's especially bad when the car is warm, and
I shut it down and re-start it 10 minutes later: it idles fine but
blows a cloud for 30 seconds when I put it under load.  It smokes
equally under low and high engine "vacuum".  I can see the smoke and
smell it too.

I'm nearly certain that the turbo is to blame.  The intake air
pressure plenum is wet with clean oil on the inside, and I don't think
that's normal.  My problem is the R/R job on my turbo is a B**ch...
about $400-500 of labor time, which the turbo warranty specifically
excluses (don't they all!).

Can I do anything else to pin the problem on the turbo before I remove
it?  

Do I have a chance of recovering the R/R money from the rebuilder?
Could I win in small claims court?

Subject: HiTorque Bolt Removal-928 Damper

  Anybody out there have any advice on how to remove the vibration
damper on a 1980 928 (in order to replace the timing belt)?  It's
held in by a *extremely* high torque bolt (something like 160
ft/lbs).  I bought & inserted the flywheel stop 9131 so the
crankshaft (which the bolt goes into) wouldn't turn.  I have a flex
head socket bar that I used with the correct socket, but I couldn't
turn it by hand.  Someone on Prodigy suggested hitting it with a
sledgehammer, which didn't work.  I then tried jacking the bar up
with a hydraulic jack from underneath, but I only succeeded in
splitting the extension (Stanley unfortunately) and damaging the
head of the bar (Craftsman fortunately).
  The manual doesn't give any advice.  I'm correct in assuming the
bolt threads turn in the "normal" direction, right?  There's what's
called a "thrust washer" behind the bolt, does this alter the
situation at all?
  I'm really at my wits' end; any help would be greatly
appreciated.
Thanx, Jeff Karandjeff, 1980 928

Hi Mike,

   A friend of mine had a very similar set of symptoms on his 74 911
after having had the air box replaced when it blew out on a backfire.
It turned out that one of the hoses had gotten plugged into the wrong
inlet, and was sucking nice clean engine oil up into the intake.

160 ft/lbs? That's "high"? I have this tool that is used to remove
Bug axle castle nuts, which routinely require 600 ft/lb to remove.
The tool (called a Ubangi) is quite a neat item - a 1/2" thick plate
with a hex cutout for the nut, and a square cutout for a breaker bar,
and two flats. You put the hex cutout on the nut, the breaker bar in
the square hole, have your assistant stand on the breaker bar, and
hit the upper flat with a sledge hammer. The nut comes right off...
I spent an evening and almost wore out an impact wrench (breaking
the socket in two in the process) with no progress at all, and using
this tool (two days later, X-mail from CA) I had the nut off in about
2 minutes.
 
> I bought & inserted the flywheel stop 9131 so the

Good move - I have one of those too, which I purchased after the
fun and games of drilling holes in a long rod and bolting the flywheel
to it... that works but the flywheel stop is much better.

At 160 ft/lb (assuming lack of any appreciable rust), you really
should be able to get the thing off in seconds using a normal impact
wrench (assuming there's room).

If you can't use (or don't have) an impact wrench, use a breaker bar
with a cheater pipe. Don't use a flex extension - you should use a
1/2" hard extension of the right length. The cheater pipe is just a
length of 1-1/2" ID pipe, about 5' long is good. You slip it over the
breaker bar and push on the end of it. This gives you about 3 or 4 times
the torque that you can get with just the breaker bar.

Subject: Electronic Ignitions


I definitely recommend this switch, especially if your distributor 
main shaft is a little worn or some other factor is affecting your
iginitions ability to maintain a consistent point gap. 

Of course, the electronic ignitions do away with point gap adjustment
by replacing the points with a magnetic or optical sensor sitting a 
a base like the one the points are on, and a triggering device that 
mounts on the distributor shaft.  More importantly, these triggers
do not limit the coil voltage as regular points do, resulting in the
ability to use stronger coils and larger spark plug gaps - note the
difference in plug gap specs from your car and the electronic ignition
motors.

I'm partial to the Alison kits myself.  They have a basic kit which 
would likely meet your needs and costs no more than $150, and they
have higher performance kits which vary 'dwell' according to RPM, and
have plug-ins for a two stage electronic rev limiter.  Also, as I
understand it, once you buy a kit, if you switch cars and keep the kit,
they will give you the necessary trigger components for the new car for 
free.

The MSD units are the other common option, which are really big on the
relatively low rpm American V8 engines, but by the time the motor is
spinning 6500 or 7000 rpm, the resulting spark output looks about the
same. However, it might stop my/your car from fouling plugs at idle!

Subject: 911 2.7L case inserts

I have some questions about the head-studs/case-inserts upgrade to the
2.7 liter motor.  As I understand it, the job consists of:

1) drop the engine
2) remove the heads and cylinders
3) remove the old studs
4) drill out the stud holes in the case
5) instal the "inserts"
6) instal new, case-alloy-compatible studs
7) re-install the cylinders
8) re-install the heads
9) re-install the engine
10) adjust the valves

As you can probably tell, this is from the perspective of someone who
has never done any engine-out-of-the-car work at all.  Nor am I
planning to start now.  I just want to understand what is involved.

So, have I missed anything big?  Do you have to open the case?  What
else should really, really be done along the way?

Anyone care to take a shot at an hours-of-labor estimate?  Parts cost?

Actually, over the last few years the weight penalties have been jiggered

Porschephiles,
	Wasn't the recent question regarding electronic ignitions concerned 
about application on a Porsche 914?  If so, there was an article in European Car 
magazine (was VW-Porsche?) on application of a Crane/Allison electronic ignition 
to a Porsche 914 during 1993, I cannot remember which issue, I think it was 
about May.  If this is important, I can dig up the issue.
	Crane and Allison are one now so either/both names describe the old 
Allison brand name.
	Best price I got on my unit (for a '76 Lancia Scorpion) was with, gulp, 
JC Whitney.  Price was $99.95 plus about $13 shipping.  Normal price was about 
$120.
	Good luck!

It's not too hard.  Are you sure that you need a new one? There is a
fair amount of adjustment available... Could it be that your clutch
is worn?

A good trick I've used is to tie a strong piece of string to the old
cable before pulling it out, and then use the string to pull the new
cable through. No "special" tools required. Tighten up the cable and
set the free play to spec, then drive it around some and set the play
again.

Al-

....."but I can't figure out the 924."....  I like that.  Can we add this to
the tag-lines list?

The 924 was the first of the water-cooled/front-engined/rear-tranny'ed p-cars
(pee-cars?).  The line evolved from the 924 -> 944 -> 968 (current model).
Intro'd in 76 as a 914 replacement, production stopped in 85.  Originally
designed by Porsche for VW, but VW decided against marketing it, so Porsche
sold it as its own.  Fair number of VW/Audi components used to try to keep
cost down.  Powerplant is an audi block (also used in various audi's, vw vans,
and ...sob...  yes, by AMC in pacers and gremlins), but with a porsche
designed head.  Output was 95-115Hp for the normal unit, 143-156hp for the 924
turbo (aka 931) in the usa, depending on model year.

The "under-powered" reputation is real and in some sense deserved.  The base
car _was_ a bit underpowered given the fairly steep asking price when new.
The turbo models put out the same power as 944's though, with less weight.

The "not a real porsche" sentiment though, IMHO, is a bum rap.  I figure this
came about because the automotive press was 1) not ready for the concept of a
water-cooled, front engined porsche, and 2) bummed at the idea of paying a lot
of $$ for a car with a lot of VW parts in it.  Of course, neither point has
anything to do with _the_car_.  The dirty little secret is that the 924 is
probably one of the best-handling porsches of all time.  It's a gas to drive
around town, and with regular maintenance, the base model is fairly
bulletproof (931's, though, have more than their fair share of problems --
believe me :-( ).  The good news is that the lack of respect for the 924 means
that you can pick up clean, well running examples for $2500...

This isn't meant to diminish the accomplishments of Hurley, Hans and the 
rest of the Brumos gang, but Consulier GTPs would be kicking everybody's 
butt if IMSA hadn't saddled them with so much extra weight (witness the 
early days of the series).  And since I understand the boys from Consulier 
had one with a Chevy LT-1 at Nelson Ledges this year, that could be only 
temporary (butt ugly car though!).  And while we're on the subject of the 
930 vs the rest of the world, it is a truly neat vehicle and will knock your 
socks clean off, but if your drive to work is on city streets (public roads 
in general for that matter), don't plan on hitting red line too often.  On 
mine ('78 w/ 4 speed), red line in first comes up at about 40 mph and second 
runs out of revs at about 80.  And it's pretty much a dog under three grand.

PROBLEM (86 911 Carrera partial wire-harness):
In my attempt to correct (insulate) the VERY bad Radio/Amp wiring job of the 
previous owner I discovered that many of wires in the cable that carries the 
+/- supply to the radio are now FRIED! 

The harness I need starts at the fire wall-
(driver side) it powers the ignition starter switch and also carries the
wire harness that supplies the fresh-air pannel lights and the ground for each
of the bulb socket (the + wires are terminated in the LIGHT switch; it 
including the radio +/- wires.

Is there a parts source for this cable other than Porsche who prefer to sell
the
complete harness for too much $$. Is it a numbered part?

Any of the reader have such a "buuger" for sale?

I haven't seen anything printed wrongly.  Stan made the point on different
internal engine stuff, etc.   For the 928 there were different cams and

Subject: a turbo that really smokes

A predicament for the collected wisdom of the Porschephiles to ponder...

I had the turbocharger rebuilt a month ago on my 1980 931.  I
considered going to Turbo City but heard some opinions against it.  I
settled on a local shop, Santa Rosa Diesel, which does some of their
own rebuilds but which farms out KKK products to a third party "guru".

Immediately upon reinstallation, the car smoked (blue oil smoke) like
there was no tomorrow (and no Air Quality Board).  Since then, in
short, I've gone back and forth to SR Diesel and two other shops to
pin down the source of smoke.  I had a turbo oil drain line vent tube
installed by Porsche (it was a factory recall in '83).  I had
compression and leakdown tested (poor but passable).  I put in a new
air filter.  I drove the car to bed in the seals.  I was told the
valve guide seals were likely culprits.

Result: the car still smokes, albeit less so.  It NEVER used to smoke,
not even a little bit.  It's especially bad when the car is warm, and
I shut it down and re-start it 10 minutes later: it idles fine but
blows a cloud for 30 seconds when I put it under load.  It smokes
equally under low and high engine "vacuum".  I can see the smoke and
smell it too.

I'm nearly certain that the turbo is to blame.  The intake air
pressure plenum is wet with clean oil on the inside, and I don't think
that's normal.  My problem is the R/R job on my turbo is a B**ch...
about $400-500 of labor time, which the turbo warranty specifically
excluses (don't they all!).

Can I do anything else to pin the problem on the turbo before I remove
it?  

Do I have a chance of recovering the R/R money from the rebuilder?
Could I win in small claims court?

Subject: HiTorque Bolt Removal-928 Damper

  Anybody out there have any advice on how to remove the vibration
damper on a 1980 928 (in order to replace the timing belt)?  It's
held in by a *extremely* high torque bolt (something like 160
ft/lbs).  I bought & inserted the flywheel stop 9131 so the
crankshaft (which the bolt goes into) wouldn't turn.  I have a flex
head socket bar that I used with the correct socket, but I couldn't
turn it by hand.  Someone on Prodigy suggested hitting it with a
sledgehammer, which didn't work.  I then tried jacking the bar up
with a hydraulic jack from underneath, but I only succeeded in
splitting the extension (Stanley unfortunately) and damaging the
head of the bar (Craftsman fortunately).
  The manual doesn't give any advice.  I'm correct in assuming the
bolt threads turn in the "normal" direction, right?  There's what's
called a "thrust washer" behind the bolt, does this alter the
situation at all?
  I'm really at my wits' end; any help would be greatly
appreciated.
Thanx, Jeff Karandjeff, 1980 928

Hi Mike,

   A friend of mine had a very similar set of symptoms on his 74 911
after having had the air box replaced when it blew out on a backfire.
It turned out that one of the hoses had gotten plugged into the wrong
inlet, and was sucking nice clean engine oil up into the intake.

160 ft/lbs? That's "high"? I have this tool that is used to remove
Bug axle castle nuts, which routinely require 600 ft/lb to remove.
The tool (called a Ubangi) is quite a neat item - a 1/2" thick plate
with a hex cutout for the nut, and a square cutout for a breaker bar,
and two flats. You put the hex cutout on the nut, the breaker bar in
the square hole, have your assistant stand on the breaker bar, and
hit the upper flat with a sledge hammer. The nut comes right off...
I spent an evening and almost wore out an impact wrench (breaking
the socket in two in the process) with no progress at all, and using
this tool (two days later, X-mail from CA) I had the nut off in about
2 minutes.
 
> I bought & inserted the flywheel stop 9131 so the

Good move - I have one of those too, which I purchased after the
fun and games of drilling holes in a long rod and bolting the flywheel
to it... that works but the flywheel stop is much better.

At 160 ft/lb (assuming lack of any appreciable rust), you really
should be able to get the thing off in seconds using a normal impact
wrench (assuming there's room).

If you can't use (or don't have) an impact wrench, use a breaker bar
with a cheater pipe. Don't use a flex extension - you should use a
1/2" hard extension of the right length. The cheater pipe is just a
length of 1-1/2" ID pipe, about 5' long is good. You slip it over the
breaker bar and push on the end of it. This gives you about 3 or 4 times
the torque that you can get with just the breaker bar.

Subject: Electronic Ignitions


I definitely recommend this switch, especially if your distributor 
main shaft is a little worn or some other factor is affecting your
iginitions ability to maintain a consistent point gap. 

Of course, the electronic ignitions do away with point gap adjustment
by replacing the points with a magnetic or optical sensor sitting a 
a base like the one the points are on, and a triggering device that 
mounts on the distributor shaft.  More importantly, these triggers
do not limit the coil voltage as regular points do, resulting in the
ability to use stronger coils and larger spark plug gaps - note the
difference in plug gap specs from your car and the electronic ignition
motors.

I'm partial to the Alison kits myself.  They have a basic kit which 
would likely meet your needs and costs no more than $150, and they
have higher performance kits which vary 'dwell' according to RPM, and
have plug-ins for a two stage electronic rev limiter.  Also, as I
understand it, once you buy a kit, if you switch cars and keep the kit,
they will give you the necessary trigger components for the new car for 
free.

The MSD units are the other common option, which are really big on the
relatively low rpm American V8 engines, but by the time the motor is
spinning 6500 or 7000 rpm, the resulting spark output looks about the
same. However, it might stop my/your car from fouling plugs at idle!

3) remove the old studs
4) drill out the stud holes in the case
5) instal the "inserts"
6) instal new, case-alloy-compatible studs
7) re-install the cylinders

PORSCHE 944 RACE CAR

1993 Record:
7 wins and 2 seconds in SCCA club racing, North Atlantic Road Racing
	Championship (NARRC) series winner
1 win and 1 third in PCA club racing (in class C)
Track record in class at Lime Rock (1:02) and NHIS (1:17)

Suspension:
Aluminum suspension with spherical bearings or solid bushings at all pivot  
points.  All rubber mounts replaced with solid mounts.  Front strut has  
coil-over racing springs with threaded adjustable spring seat.  Front  
strut tops replaced with spherical bearings and camber plates for quick  
camber adjustability.  Package includes 325 lb/in, 400 lb/in and 450 lb/in  
Eibach racing springs for front, 27 mm and 29 mm hollow Sway-A-Way torsion  
bars for rear.  Fully-adjustable anti-roll bars front (32 mm) and rear (25  
mm), mounted in solid bushings and using teflon-lined rod ends in the  
adjustable drop links.  Koni adjustable Gas Sport shocks front and rear.

Chassis:
All carpeting, insulation, interior paneling (except for door panels and  
dash) has been removed.  A custom six-point roll cage made from 1.75" OD x  
.095" wall DOM tubing is welded into the chassis structure using heavy  
mounting plates.  Cage is fully-triangulated, with two door bars on both  
passenger and driver side, dash bar, and rear shock mount brace, and  
substantially stiffens the chassis.  The cage is SCCA and PCA legal.  The  
front spoiler has been modified to improve air-flow to the radiator and to  
mount front brake cooling ducts.

Engine:
A 2.5 liter 8-valve 944 engine is currently installed for SCCA racing.  It  
has been blueprinted and balanced, the head has been planed to increase  
compression ratio, and a free-flow exhaust has been fitted.  It produces  
approximately 180 hp.  An aluminum turbo radiator has been fitted.  An  
Accusump and external oil cooler have been installed using Aeroquip lines  
and fittings.  Further development of this engine could yield nearly 200  
hp legally under SCCA ITS rules, but so far hasn't been necessary.  Other  
engines can be easily installed into the chassis for PCA club racing.  We  
can install a 500 hp turbo engine (for Class A) or a 250 hp 16-valve 944S  
engine (for Class C).  With either engine, this car would be unbeatable in  
PCA racing.

Drivetrain:
Reworked 944 transmission with Quaife torque-sensing differential.

I got an MSD ignition system (series 6?) with their hot
coil a couple of years ago, and couldn't get it to work.
Also couldn't get much technical help to find the problem.
They replaced the coil which didn't solve the problem.

I've seen dozens of ads for 911's that use them, so I'm 
sure it was my fault. It seemed to be a problem with the
RPM sensor because the car would get up to about 1,800
RPM and totally break up, like the timing went out to
lunch. I couldn't get any local help at the time, so the
unit is still sitting in my garage. 

My car is a '73 911 with original Bosch CD ignition and
mechanical fuel injection. Anyone out there install an
MSD ignition in a similar car?

If there isn't an obvious way to solve the problem, I'd
be happy to sell the system at a _highly discounted_ 
price with a money-back guarantee.

Well said.  I like to point out that there's a difference between "design
quality" and "service quality" at the dealership.  Bad car/Good dealer is
about equal to Good car/Bad dealer, depending on if you would prefer to be
frustrated by the towtruck driver (former) or the service manager (latter).

My personal appeal for cars of German descent is that it seems that their
Engineers seemed to have gotten greater/better say in the total product
design than elsewhere.  I prefer a product that performs over one that
looks like it should perform (but probably doesn't)...a 911 is definitely
more functional than beautiful.

It's my pet peeve, but redesigns that change appearance (facelifts),
rather than to affect substance I regard as a waste.  When changes of
substance do come, many automakers error further by "throwing the baby out
with the bathwater" every N years by the "improved" product really being
a completely new design ("...a clean sheet of paper...").  From an
engineering standpoint, they run the risk of reintroducing design
problems that had been solved years earlier, but that got lost when the
old design was shelved.  The 30 year evolution of the 911 is contrary to
this.  Granted, the Carrera 4 may not share parts with a 901, but it is
very "Darwin-esque" when you look at everything in between and allows
good engineering to be enhanced rather than be thrown away every N years.

In regards to the Japanese, they have good products and this is proven by
their US market share.  However, saying "who's best" is a useless chase,
since the conclusion will be a function of who's criteria you're going to
use to define what's best.  Comparing features is easy, but even this is a
trap:  Color is a feature and (inflate ego here) **I** say that the "best"
car can't be red, because red cars get stolen more often and attract more
speeding tickets.  Hey, why can't that be a valid criteria?

Let me really understand this: you want to know what's going onso you
don't get screwed but you don't want to do the work yourself? That's
a very good and reasonable plan!

>So, have I missed anything big?  Do you have to open the case?  What
>else should really, really be done along the way?

You need to decide *why* you're fixing this: (1) it's broke an dyou
can't sell it that way, (2) it's broke and you want to spend minimum
$$$ to fix it, (3) you love the car and want to keep it/drive it/etc.

If you are a (1) or (2) type person, then your list is about right.
BTW, *not* being such a person, I have little time or patience 
with figuring out how to agriculturally engineer a cheap-screw "fix".
However, if you're a (3) I'll be more than happy to help you out...

So yeah, well, you did miss a few things. You *REALLY* need to split the
case to get the TimeSerts installed correctly, because you want them 
on *EXACTLY* the perpendicular with the case centerline, and to do that
you really need to put each case half on a mill....

So, plan on new bearings, having the crank checked, the rods checked,
maybe re-sized and balanced, having a good look at the timing chains,
cams, etc. In short, a full engine rebuild.

For the best break-out of this I've seen in print, see Bruce Anderson's
911 Performance Handbook. He has section that has a checklist and
time estimate. It's pretty complete.

>Anyone care to take a shot at an hours-of-labor estimate?  Parts cost?

R & R heads, with valve job, *ALONE* (i.e. no bottom end work) is
by the book a 40 hour job. From a headless block, doing the bottom
end is about a 35 hour job. Doing the case inserts is best sent out
to RedLine or similar, where it should be about a $200 job including 
parts.

Elmer Fohey, my engine guy, manages to save about 90% of the 
pistons and cylinder sets by careful cleaning and bead blasting.
Ditto valves, etc. You *MUST* buy new gaskets, seals, and bearings.
You *SHOULD* buy late tensioners ($350), and may need to do other
things. In general, parts cost shoudl be about $800-1200 depending
on how good a shopper you are. Make people *PROVE* that you need new
pistons and cylinders rather than just buying them ($3k or so).

Good luck. And if you'd like an extimate on having Elmer do
an engine for you, shoot me a note. (they've been running $2k
plus parts lately, on average.)

I think I know the answer to this one: ride height needs to allow
bumpers of your car to meet bumper of other car at same height; big
bumpers are for the 5 mph no damage crash tests. I believe there is
also a difference in spring stiffness: the importer thinks americans
would not buy the car unless it has a soft/cushy ride... :-)

Subject: new 911 stuff


In the UK virtually every car `porn' magazine has the new 911 on the
front cover. Autocar has a comprehensive road test. They say it is
the best 911 of recent times, and award five stars against the
four awarded to the 348, NSX, Lotus Esprit S4 and the three for the new
Toyota Supra (sorry Japanese cars fans!). A brief extract from the comparison
with the NSX follows.

" As the 911s muscle bound bannana yellow backside squatted and rocketed
hard into the distance, leaving me and the NSX momentarily numbed by 
what had just happened, you could almost hear the tinkle of the penny
dropping. I had driven through the night to compare porsche's latest 911
against the car Porsche felt most nervous about when designing it, yet in
the time it takes to drop from third to second and nail a floor mounted
accelerator to the boards, the new 911 had already made its point as clear 
the purest crystal"

Great pictures as well, this car looks like essence of 911 and
asthetically very pleasing (HUGE butt - but thats how I like them!)

Looks like good news for Porsche and bad news for other rolling 
objects.

handling as well as the practice of sports car racing.

Also it has a number of pics of all sorts of cars ( more 911 than any

Subject: A few questions



Hi everyone,

I have a few questions which I would appreciate any comments on.

Firstly, I plan to change the oil in my 88 911 coupe. I have a handy
incline on which I can park, is it worth doing the change on the
incline? my newbie theory is that this may allow the lines to the
cooler and the cooler itself to drain in addition to the crankcase
and oiltank. If the theory is correct, is it desirable to drain
out those last couple of litres? is there a possibility of an airlock
occuring in the lines or cooler as a result?

Secondly, I am taking my 911 to a track day at Silverstone on Monday,
(see you there any UK poschephiles?) Does anyone have any advice
for a total novice?

Subject: 951 misc (turbo waterpump, belt tool, injectors)


A couple of misc items for 951s.

1. A couple of weeks ago I posted a problem with the turbo waterpump. Well,
   I took it apart, I got some magnetic wire (less than $3) and I rebuilt it.
   It works fine so far. For someone that knows the basics about motors is an 
   easy job. A rebuild pump costs between $120-$150. 

2. I am about to replace the belts, and I am looking for this very 
   expensive tool that the only thing it does is to measure the tension.
   There is an older version of this tool, advertised at $389 (the newest
   electronic version much more expensive). I checked any possible source
   in Pano and I cannot find it. Does anybody knows any places that sell it?

3. While bleeding the cooling system, I noticed sparks between a spark plug
   wire and the fuel injector at #1 cylinder, as well as between the same
   injector and the engine body (where the injector contacts the body). I took
   away the spark plug wire so no sparks occur between the injector and the
   wire, but the sparks in the base of the injector still occur.
   Is it something I should worry about?

I've got a problem....

        1980 3.0l 911 Engine ( carrera tensioners). Upon de-acceleration,
I hear a metalic "ting" noise from about 5000rpm-3000 rpm. Compression is
165/per cylinder, no smoke blowing. Engine runs real nice. I've put a hose
in my hear and tried to find the source, but to no avail. It seems like
its'
somewhere on the left hand side ( drivers) towards the firewall. It was
doing it when I bought the car - it sorta sounds almost like a washers
tinging about in the exhaust system. It only happens upon de-acceleration,
not consistantly
either. I'm scratching my head over this. Any ideas where to look ? or what
this might be ? I'm wondering if it might be a loose valve, yet this would
create more of a consistant noise. I give up. :-((

Subject: 911 Dash Recover

I went through the experience of pulling and recovering a 911 dash with a
leather kit that I picked up from AGLA. The leather quality was poor - it
had a 
mark right above the center dash, and the leather seam was poorly sewn, and
unevenly at that. I ended up taking it to my trim friend, who had to re-sew
it, mess with stretching it over the dash and mucking with it to make it
look good.

In retrospect, Zims had new dashes ( not leather...) for 275.00 a while
back. Part of a special. I  think I would have been more happy going that
route. There
are some very expensive "kits" on the market, but if you want the leather,
I'd next time have it custom covered from scratch. All the kits are are
just 2 pieces of leather sewn together, and you have no say over what the
quality is.

I also purchased ALGA's leather knob/shiftboot, and wasn't that impressed
either. These are just my opinions.

Subject: Re: dash / console lights

     Ed, I don't have in-depth wiring info for an '87 but I do know my 
     first trouble-shooting step on my 928 would be... do you have +12V DC 
     at the fuse block? Check using a handheld voltmeter or similar tool. 
     That will tell you if the problem is before or after the fuses. Should 
     be +12V at one side or the other of the fuse socket for the dash 
     lights, with the negative probe of your voltmeter grounded to chassis. 
     Sorry I can't help you more but that may help. 
     
     Second step: You should have +12V on one side to ground, and 0 volts 
     on the other side (the load side) (this is with the light switch 
     turned on). Pull the fuse out and check the resistance to ground on 
     the load side of the socket using your meter. Complete short (zero 
     ohms) means wiring problem. Complete open (nearly infinite ohms) means 
     wiring problems. Somewhere in between.. maybe 1000 ohms or so... means 
     more trouble-shooting.

If you can, I would start with what the Col. suggested to if by some chance 
your fuse block may be at fault.

My vote would be the dimmer switch.  You did not mention if you have tried
to vary it and the results.    You can measure the voltage at both sides of
the switch while you vary it,  it should change between 0 - 12v on the light
side of the switch.

I learned on a dark road that my dimmer was pretty dirty when I tried to
adjust it and everything went out inside.  I did find the clean spot for 
the wiper again.

If it is a problem take some tuner/switch cleaner from Radio Shack (not a ad
just cheaper and easier to find than a TV/radio repair center)  and spray it
into the holes in the switch, vary the setting.


I would be interested in finding out what you find.

I am sorry, but not surprised, to hear this.  My experience with AGLA
has been extremely poor as well, not only because of poor quality but
also outrageous business practices.  I posted this story a few years
ago on this list, but perhaps a recounting might save others from a
mistake.

I decided to recover my 4-spoke steering wheel.  Doubting my leather
working skills, I decided to let AGLA do it for me (an advertized
service).  AGLA offered to ship me a loaner wheel (after dinging my
American Express card for a $400 security deposit) while they
recovered mine.  After a few weeks, I began calling to find out when I
could expect my wheel to be returned.  Each time I was given a Real
Soon Now response, including several claims that the wheel had been
shipped.  No wheel showed up.  Finally, after about 3 months and many
phone calls, my steering wheel finally arrived.  The tab on the back
(that automatically cancels the turn signal after a turn) was broken
off.  In addition, the workmanship was very poor, with obvious "pulls"
where the leather did not fit properly on the wheel.

When I called to complain, AGLA offered to redo the work.  Having gone
through the prior 3 months of frustration, I decided not to risk it.
I shipped back the loaner wheel and asked to have my $400 deposit
credited to my AMEX card.  To make an already-too-long story a little
shorter, AGLA did not post the credit.  I had to resort to interacting
with American Express, who ultimately posted the credit two months
later after AGLA failed to respond to AMEX's inquiries about the
matter.  This fiasco took a total of about 5 months to resolve.

I should emphasize that in all these transactions, I dealt directly
with Alan Gun, the owner of AGLA.  I am convinced that he lied to me
about the status of my order several times.  His failure to post my
credit after receiving the loaner wheel back in spite of his claims
otherwise, and the fact that he did not respond to AMEX inquiries
about the matter leave little doubt in my mind about AGLA's business
ethics.  Caviat Emptor.

Automechanika (1-800-582-2886) has been advertizing the electronic
gauge for $389 in the last several Pano issues.  This is exactly the
same price they used to charge for the mechanical version.  Did you
call them and get a different story?  I am still curious to find out
how the electronic gauge works (anyone got one?).  I have never seen a
better price than about $360 for either version.  

Another source that used to offer the gauge for an equivalent price is
Race Force (510-652-8835) in Emeryville, CA.  I haven't seen any of
their ads for a while, though, so I'm not sure if they are still in
business.

Yet another lead is Baum Tools (1-800-848-6657).  They are a good
source of specialty tools for virtually all imports, but are probably
more expensive.  My catalog is pretty old, but they periodically send
me announcements for new Porsche and Volvo tools (since I have bought
tools for each brand in the past).  Surprisingly, our beloved P9201
belt tensioning tool showed up on the most recent VOLVO list.  They
did not send a price list, unfortunately.  I wonder if it is cheaper
if you buy one to work on Volvos....  :-)

Okay,  After much hassle, headaches, and general frustration, I have
come to the following conclusions on a way to do this - it aint
perfect, but, you can benefit from my mistakes.  I may have to do this
again sometime, so if others can add to this approach
or have a better idea, I am also interested in their opinions.

1.  Clean the surface as best you can, use 3M's adhesive remover
	to get the left over "goo" off.  The cleaner the better.
	Spend way more time on this than you thought, it will help
	much more than you think!

2.  Buy 3M's Super Adhesive Trim product (best I've found), Tweeks and
	Stoddard both sell it if you cant find it locally.  Look for the
	3M product number in the Stoddard/Tweeks catalog, since 3M sells
	a variety of adhesives, you want the RIGHT one! 

3.  Go and buy a whole bunch of 1" x 3/8" wood sticks.

OKAY, here we go:

4.  Follow the instructions and apply the adhesive to both the car and
	and insulation.  I'd wait at least 30 minutes before sticking
	them together, and boy will they stick at first!

5.  Now, cut up the wood sticks and find some cardboard.  Prop up
	the cardboard with the wood sticks.  This is the way I figured
	out how to apply "constant and even pressure" for 24 hours
	of the drying period.

                         |     wood stick
	----floor--------|--------------------------


  	When you do the sides, you can cut sticks for horizontal support
 	and glue both sides at the same time and then the support/pressure
	is on both.

6.  WATCH OUT for overspray of the 3M adhesive, it EATS PAINT!  And it
	does it almost instantly, I almost died when I figured THAT out!
	Thank goodness, the paint that was removed was in a benign area
	I could fix very easily.
	

Well, this is what finally worked for me, if I were to do it again,
I wouldnt use the stuff Stoddard/Tweeks sells and would try to find
something lighter. In their defense, however, I do like the way
their "original" stuff looks not that its applied/installed.
The "original" is in quotes because I dont think its really original,
but, the best they can find to match the original insulation.


Anyway,  Good Luck and be VERY PATIENT!!

Subject: PCA Club Racing: Topeka

This is pretty long.  If you don't like racing, or track events, quit now!

I have just returned from the PCA Club Race at Heartland Park Topeka
(Kansas for those Porschephiles on the other side of the ponds), and
thought you might be interested hearing about the event.  The weekend
coincided with a meeting of the PCA National Executive Council, so all the
national board members were there.  This is the second year of PCA's Club
Racing program, a wheel-to-wheel racing series that encourages gentlemenly
racing, much like vintage racing.

The Great Plains Region put on an outstanding event, considering that it
was their first ever Club Racing event.  I have been to one of their
driver's schools at Heartland Park several years ago, and to put it mildly,
their attitude is very laid back (like they usually man 2 corner stations
on a 2.5 mile, 16 turn track).  They have run rain or shine, and have 25 or
30 minute practice sessions.  They hold 4 or 5 driver's schools per year at
this track.  If you have a chance to go, you won't regret it.

The Heartland Park Topeka facility is also increadible.  The track surface
must be about 45 or 50 feet wide all the way around the track.   The main
straight is probably 75 feet wide and 2400 feet long, and there are 3 other
straights each about 900 feet.  The asphalt is very smooth and easy on
tires.  The track can be run in may different configurations to change the
length and type of turns.  We were running the long version, 2.5 miles, 16
turns.

This event brought out some of the neatest Porsche race cars I have ever
seen.  We had a twin-turbo 935, a Martini Le Mans turbo, several very wide
911 RSR's, a 911 GTU, and even a brand new 911 3.8 RSR!  The guy who
brought the 935 also had a 962 in his trailer, but never ran it.  There
were a total of 62 drivers, and they divided us into 3 race groups.  My
914-6 is in Class B and ran with the fastest cars.  (The 935, and 3.0L+
RSR's are all Class A cars, the 911GTU, and smaller RSRs are in my class).

My car has been primarily set up for autocross and the shorter tracks found
in Colorado.  The last time I was at Heartland Park, I had a V top gear
(7:31 R/P, and 22in tires), so top speed was limited to about 110 mph at
8000 RPM in 5th.  I would hit this about half way down the main straight,
and sit on the rev limiter for nearly 1000 feet!  I vowed never to return
until I had a taller gearbox.  For this event I put together a gearbox with
AHNUY gears, and with the 23.5in tires I'm now using should be capable of
148 mph at the top end of fifth.  This was probably just a little too tall,
as I only pulled about 7200 rpm in 5th (about 137 mph), but at least I
didn't hit the rev limiter!

I also knew that I could run very soft compound tires, so I started the
weekend with the Goodyear R160 radials I use for autocrossing.  We hit cord
during my wife's qualifying session, and switched to a new set of R240
compounds for the actual race on Sunday afternoon.  The R240's felt about
the same on the track, but the stopwatch told a different story -- they
were about 2 seconds per lap slower than the R160's!  Next year - 6 R160's
will get us through the weekend.

We had a 2 practice starts and a short 5 lap practice race on Saturday
afternoon.  As we left the grid for the practice starts, I noticed my front
hood was loose, so I pulled off right behind the pace car, and missed the
first start.  After securing the hood, I was put out at the back of the 20
car field.  During the next practice start, I moved up about 10 positions
before the first turn, but I had to put the apex of the turn under the
center of my car as we went three-abreast into turn 1.  It was pretty
exciting!  

We maintained the same postions for the start of the 5 lap race, and
gridded about 6th or 8th.  When the green flag dropped, I went between the
two cars in  the row in front of me, and 944 turbo, and the 911 GTU of
Scott Holley.  I thought I was going to get scrunched, as we squezed into
turn 1, but Scott must have dropped back, and I came out about 4th or 5th. 
I was able to move up to finish 3rd behind the 935 and the turbo Martini
car.  A funny thing happened when Steve Kent ran out of fuel in his 2.8
RSR, he signaled and came into the pits, and the next five or six cars just
followed him in!  They believed that he had seen the checkered flag, and
that they had missed it!  Good leason:  the race isn't over until YOU see
the checkered flag.

Next came my wife Ellen's practice race.  She was gridded last for some
reason, and had to move from last to second during her race.  She was
really flying as she would pass about 3 or 4 cars every lap!  During the
race, I noticed a fair amount of smoke coming from beneath our car.  They
never black flagged her, and when she returned to the pits, the engine was
coated with oil.  It seems that a the pressure line for the new Carrera
tensioners had broken due to vibration, and was leaking at the banjo
fitting on the front of the timing chain cover.  No one had a spare, so we
drilled the banjo fitting, bent the line a little straighter and epoxied
the line into the fitting (JB Weld is good stuff!).  After curing
overnight, we installed it, and the leak was fixed!

During the Sunday morning practice and qualifying, I really put in some
good times.  1:56's consistently.  Ellen was turning about 2:03's or :04's.
 I qualified fourth  with a time of 1:56.4, and Scott Holley was next to me
with a 1:56.1  The 935 was second at 1:48 and the Martini RSR was on the
pole with a blazing 1:46!  My race was boring, as Scott Holley finally had
the 911 GTU running well, and moved off into the distance.  I put a lot of
distance between Steve Kent and myself, and basically drove 10 of the 12
laps without seeing another car.  I was lapped by the Martini car on the
last lap.  I had started 4th and finished 4th.

Ellen's race was much more interesting, as she qualified second with a
2:02.2  The polesitter was Dick Salem in a GT-3, 911 Targa.  He got the
jump on her at the start, but she stayed within 1 car length for the next
several laps.  They pulled about 20 seconds or more ahead of the rest of
the field.  While following, Ellen was able to turn a 1:59.5, more than 2.5
seconds faster than her qualifying time!  She passed Dick under braking
into turn 1, and pulled to a slight advantage for about a 1.5 laps.  Then
he suckered her into protecting the inside line while he took the faster
late apex, and passed her on the next straight.  At the next turn, Ellen
turned in a little too early and spun, killing the engine in the process. 
She re-fired and returned to the race still in second.  She ran a good race
although never able to catch Dick, and finished 2nd!  She and Dick were
both awarded the worker's choice awards for best demonstrating the spirit
of PCA Club Racing!

The weekend was a blast.  (Bet you couldn't tell, huh?)

  In a 2.0 'GA' powerplant, the hi-volume oil pump has in and out ports of

  My query is:  the holes in the case are smaller than the pump's...
                is this a problem?  Does the case need drilling to match?

  Also;
  When i removed the original pump (120000 miles), the camshaft gear had

Subject: Quality.

  Greetings all.

  Having read the numerous postings about the quality of German products
  and other products, and having said nothing here about it (but debating
  it fiercly amongst my colleagues) I wish to share this with the 'philes.

  I have been working with computer hardware designers (boards and boxes)
  for over 15 years and these are the conclusions we came to:

  A designer sets out to create something.
  The designer uses whatever methods to assemble the idea into reality.
  (sometimes this never happens) this is called Pie-in-the-sky.
  During the process, a raft of details go into the core subject,
  the choice of materials, manufacturability, assembly procedures,
  and hopefully, a big dose of experience (what works, what dont).

  From this maelstrom emerges the product's prototype and (maybe) the
  final design (B-model).  Before the C-models get produced, the management
  starts asking how to 'cost reduce' the design.
  This is where the quality gets clipped.
  It starts with substitution; plastic in place of steel, mild steel in place
  of stainless, plastic radiators, aluminum wiring, parts that are stamped 
  instead of forged. The point is that management dictates final quality!
  Any designer worth his salt doesnt set out to design shitty products!
  The carnage they suffer at the hands of those who dont care...

  Frinstance, the 'spacesaver spare' -the one that fits in the space the same
  as a real tire...it does'nt save space -it saves money, theirs not yours.
  Someone somewhere got a big bonus for that one -I'd lay dollars to donuts
  that person was not a designer. [if so hang yer head low you rich butt-head]
   gee, i feel better now...

  The point is:  American designers, German, French, Italian, um Polish
  dont matter.  What does is the management and the level they will stoop
  to save a buck.  And from what we have seen, Quality=Buck$.

  Its easy to stand up in a crowd of turkeys when you are a giraffe.
  
  Long live the Porsche...Engineering/Management at its finest.

Subject: 303 Protectant

A brief plug for 303 protectant:

I was introduced to it by a auto detailer
in the SF Bay Area who specializes in vintage and 
exotic cars. He was working on a beautiful mid-50's
Ferrari when I talked with him. He said that
303 was developed for the aircraft industry since
many planes sit in the sun all day long. All the rubber
and plastic degrades from the UV in the sun, which is
exactly what we Porsche owners would like to forestall
(there is no getting around the second  law of 
thermodynamics).

I've been happy with it. It goes on and makes rubber
and plastic look ``right'' as opposed to silicone based
products which make materials look oily (and feel the
same). I have never liked Armor-All and other products
similar to it. The real test of 303, of course, will come
in the long run and I have only been using it for a couple
of years so the jury is still out. At least it isn't damaging
my car. I still only use real leahter care products on the 
leather. though (Lexol, etc).

I'll throw marketing/sales in with mgmt. because they are

The stylist also impinges on the design (or the design
impinges on the style, depending on who you ask).

It's the engineer who must combine all the design/style/

time pressures, this turns into a real kluge job.

The maintainer is one guy who deserves an input, but usually
doesn't get one.  Thus, the need for asbestos octupuses

Subject: Kyle Ehler and the designers

Having spent some years in marketing and thus the de facto adversary of the
designers that KE reveres, I must reflame:
I'm sure that automotive, as well as electronics, engineers feel wronged when
compromises are forced on them.  And when they are forced to actually release
the product rather than spend another few months making it the best that ever
was.  But Porsche (for instance) is not in business to design things.  They
are in business to SELL things.  If they price them too high, or bring them to
market long after the competition, no one buys the things, and then the mar-
keting people and the engineers are laid off together.
Successful companies do these design/market compromises well.  The best com-
panies make it seem as though they are not compromising.

And besides that I LIKE space-saver spares.  With today's tires you never use
them anyway.  Why pay for, carry around, and allocate space for a full size
wheel and tire that you're just going to sell, still shiny new, to the next
owner?

Here's to Porsche (and VW): may they learn to compromise like they used to!

That is correct. It also has *one other* HIGHLY entertaining feature.
At some future date, postulate a future owner who is not so mechanically
adept as yourself. You tell them when the car changes hands "Oh, it has 
hydraulic lifters and you don't need to adjust the valves". They say 
"OK, sounds good" and promptly forget all about it. They then later take 
it to a shop and say "annual service, please". 

Any idea how badly it screws things up to "adjust" a hydraulic valve
train to mechanical valve specs? If not, you don't want to know.

>  How much machining is required?

None. With the right parts, it just drops in. You *do* have to buy
cam, lifters, pushrods, rocker arms, and valve springs to make it
work right, though. There are some highly unscrupulous vendors who
will sell you mix-and-match parts, like hydraulic lifters (obviously
the key part, right?) and solid lifter cams. *BAD* things happen if
you use this combination...

>  Any other limitations/options to be aware of?

There *used to be* some valve float problems, and problems with lifter
"pump-up" (i.e. takes all the slack out of the system) but if you use 
Crane or Sealed Power (first choice) lifters, they have some anti-pump-up 
techniques that work really well up to 6000 RPM or so. You shouldn't wind 
up a mostly stock 2.0 beyond that to begin with.

For full-race engines, I buy two sets of cam bearings, use the second
thrust bearing (so I get a full thrust bearing, not a half bearing)
and toss the rest. This is mainly a supersition held over from my Beetle
racing days. For street engines, remember, if it *needed* the full bearing, 
it would have it. 

And someone out there used to package bearings this way as a kit, so you
just had to buy their kit at 45% more than one set of bearings instead of
getting two sets of bearings... I have no idea who or where, though. If
it still exists, one of the Type IV houses (like FAT, as a  best choice)
will know.

This leads me to ask where you got the high volume pump. The diameter
mis-match won't cause significant problems, but may cause some fluid flow
inefficiences. All the pumps I've seen had same diameter plumbing, though.

That *is* significant. It means that the pump and the cam gear were
worn out. The most likely source of contact is that the shaft for the
driven gear on the oil pump "slipped" and pushed back towards the
face of the cam gear. It there bumped against the rivets on the cam, and
filled the oil with nastly little bits of metal.

Main thing here is to not use the case without *VERY COMPLETE* cleaning
and *VERY* careful inspection to make sure that you don't have more
bits of metal running around in the various oil galleys. You also need
to toss the cam gear, if not the whole cam.

Oh, and when you install an aftermarket cam and gear: about 75% of the
time, the vendor gives you *BOLTS* that are too tall and won't clear the
back of the oil pump -- causing you to recreat this *ALL OVER AGAIN*.
One vendor that does send you "pre-shortened" bolts is FAT. Remember to
ask for them, just in case. Otherwise, you have to get a die grinder and
get after the tops of the bolts to make the cam turn without hitting on
things. 

Another reason it's very important to test turn everything you put in an
engine before bolting it all up...

Hi all!

I have to have one of the hinge brackets for the rear deck lid on my 1975 914

the lid mechanism (which, apparently, the previous owner failed to read 8-).
The article says that the repair of a broken bracket is described in Upfixin
der Porsche, Vol. 4, page 70. Could someone look to see if there is anything in
there that goes beyond the information in the latest Panorama, and common
sense? I've found a shop here in the middle of the desert that will do the
welding (MIG, right?), but I'd rather do the wrench work myself -- not that I
don't trust them to not scratch the paint or anything 8-).

Unrelated subject. Lately I've noticed a fair number of out of town Porsches
parked around this little rat hole of a town. I quess tourists will try
anything. Anyway, it occurred to me that it would be really fun to have a

Porschephiles. Of course the chances of "bumping into" one of you all around
these parts is about <the number of Porsches sold>:1 but hey, ya never know.

As a person stuck in the middle (clowns to the left, jokers to the right)  
PLEASE do not honk your horn in the Republic.  California has two legal
reasons for horn honking (neither comes to mind now, and the DMV book
is probably trashed (not recycled, I'm sure)).  I distinctly remember 
the question on the written test that you take to be 'legal' out here.  

As to the out-of-state plates (they never learn), California requires that
a vehicle get registered within 20 days of crossing over the line.  I find
it incredibly amazing the number of automobiles (that cost a bunch) with
those "I'm not from California plates".  Guess it is my east coast conscience
attacking, and the $900 hurt, and at least the plates don't clash with the
color of the cars, but I want to know why all those constitutional 
amendments don't apply to everybody......

Hasta la vista,

Assuming you're talking about people other than tourists, who are there for
more than 20 days, there are several explanations:

college/grad students attending from out-of-state
employees of companies on short-term assignment (1-2 years)
military (CA has more military than any state in US, and most other
countries)
No doubt there are some others doing it illegaly as well.

As a Californian (sp?) in the military, I'll be the first to defend that
great state, and I still carry a CA driver's license, because I'm proud
of the fact that I had driver's education AND driver's training (there
IS a difference, and it really shows in places like FL!) and that I learned
to drive in close formation at 70+ mph on CA freeways.

But I doubt that I will ever have CA license plates, strictly because
of money.  Since I'm covered by the Federal Soldiers' and Sailors' Act,
which says I can live anywhere and keep my current state of legal 
residence, and since my wife is an OR resident, all our cars have OR
plates.  Here's why:

BLOOD-SUCKING FEE		CALIFORNIA	OREGON
========================	==========	======
Sales Tax on automobiles		8%	    0%
Title & Tag fees		       $$$	   $16
Annual Tag Renewal		privilege	flat rate: $15
		                tax based on
                                value of car
				(more $$$)

Plus, right now, I think OR has a better-looking tag than CA.

Military, for example, may retain their plates from their state of legal
residence.  It does not have to be the state in which they currently 
reside.  This, I would guess, is because on the average military folks 
move once every 4 years.

  Dont worry, the paint will get munged.  You have to in the process of
  making a good weld joint.  Replacing the hinge mounts is a piece of
  cake (i did both mine in ONE day..) but the mount site must be clean
  so the weld will stick.  Then afterwards spray the area thoroghly with
  zinc paint to prevent further corrosion -try to get it behind and pene-
  trate the seams.  I cut drain notches in the bottoms to keep them dry
  just in case you wash the compartment (or the rain tray is gone).
   Dont paint the zinc spray on the part before welding -despite the
  instructions...it makes for a lousy weld.
   If you're into keeping it OEM; pre-prime with Wurth rust guard followed
  by PU seam sealant (white), then prime with Glasodur, then finish.

   Another tip:  The bolts securing the deck lid to the hinge can be
  drilled/grooved to allow a zerk fitting.  With this a shot of grease
  and your hinges will never fail again.

Well - my brief fling with the porschephiles has certainly been
interesting and for the most part has been very helpful.

I want to thank those of you who responded to my "3 car" question.
Many of the responses (with the exception of a rather juvenile flame
from jim pasha) were very helpful. In particular, william kennedy had
perhaps the best response - william writes:

	Do you date them (the cars) or marry them? 

After considering this response for a while it really began to set
in - given that I am already married to my wife, conceptually married
to my house and to my daughter, mountain biking, snow skiing, tennis
and my carrer -  I find myself looking for a "fling" in a high
performance car as opposed to a marriage.

After driving porsches for the past 3 weeks, I have decided that they
are not the car I had expected.  I am looking for something I can:

	1. drive hard all year round in Oregon weather
	2. not have to spend a ton of money on maintenance
	3. Not have to spend time fixing it myself

Thanks again for all your responses -

OK, here is the problem: Designing in a vacuum.  Particularly, a
customer wants and needs vacuum.  This is the Mercedes and Porsche

of gas at the moment.  They don't know who their customers are and

Subject: 911 Cab top replacement

Anyone replaced their 911 Cab top.  Mine is overdue.  I'm trying to be frugal
but don't want to waste my money either.  Seems to be very large differences
in pricing, from $500 range(in mags) all the way to $5000 from the dealer.  
A couple of shops have quoted $2000 for "german but not factory" cloth, $1500 
for Stay-fast G, both installed, and another $1000 for all the rubber seals 
(installed).  Also I think I've seen an upgraded factory top with metal 
looking rain gutters.  But the shops don't seem to know much about them.

Any experience out there?  What to look for, what is as functional as the 
factory top, but maybe a little more frugal.  Can I upgrade an 83 911 to the
newer tops and seals? Assuming Porsche has improved the breed as they 
usually do.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: 911 Engine Compartment Insulation


Scott,

I installed new engine compartment insulation on my '67 912 about a year ago.  
Here are my experiences:

 -I got the insulation kit from Stoddard.  I like the material they provide, but 
I remember having to order two kits for my vintage of car.  The "kit" required 
lots of triming, so take your time and lay out your cuts carefully.  

 -Get a round-hole punch if you can, it makes for much cleaner holes for bolts 
(like the ones that are used to mount the voltage regulator) that go through 
the engine compartment wall and the insulation.

 -I used plain old contact cement to attach the insulation, it worked great.  I 
found that I didn't need to use make any special jigs to hold the insulation in 
place while the cement dried--just hold it in place for a couple of minutes by 
hand.

 Whoa! The racing biz Dr. Porsche fed was driven by the desire to design
(and profit), correct me if i'm wrong but did'nt Porsche's designer's
invent and license the syncromesh transmission.  Did'nt also the factory
produce minimum production runs of race models simply to 'homologate' the
design?  To me that seems more like design for excellence than for profit.
Perhaps those days are gone forever.  But this is what got us here.

Granted, you cant have a business (for long) without sales.

Well, here is a case where you daily drive less miles than an emergency
spare is intended.  But I use my Porsche for those long distance trips
and getting a tire changed on a factory mag is less than desirable at
the last chance gas station.  Not to mention that I would'nt want my

Unless times have changed, only the military excuse will
get you out of registering your car in CA. 

I went to school in Santa Barbara, and being a typical
(broke) college student, didn't register my car there until
the plates expired. They nailed me with an $80 fine for 
failure to register ("you eat pizza here for 30 days, 
you're a resident") plus I had to California-ize my "other
48" car - another $250, PLUS I still had to pay the 
registration! It's no wonder they shoot people on the
highways out there.

Let's see, $450 or so for the priviledge of driving in
California? It doesn't seem so bad now. (at least North

Hi Fellow Porschephiles,

Anyone has the experience of changing their 911 torsion bar?

I am considering upgrading my 76/911 front and rear bar 
to 21mm/26mm. I have never done this before, so any suggestion
would be helpful. I do have the Hayes repair manual, but
it is somewhat vague. Here are my immediate questions:

1) Do I need any special tools to remove and install the bars?

2) Which end of the housing do I remove and insert the bars
   (both front A-arm and rear) and do I need a drift?

3) Where is the best place to buy SwayAway torsion bars?

Amen to that! California has been losing the license plate beauty
contest badly ever since the sunset plates went away. (Although 
last I heard, you could still get them by paying a surcharge on 
vanity plates). The current plates are atrocious.

However...we are about the leap into the lead again! In just

for California plates. :-)  

(Yes, they are more expensive than normal plates. But the extra

My girlfriend has an '85 Vanagon which started clicking in the rear.
Her mechanic (who's quite good, w/ vw's anyway) recommended just
regreasing the CV joint. It worked and there has been no clicking

thought that once you heard noise in the CV joints they were no good

This is quite correct.  Not only that, but any play only accelerates the
wear, snowballing the destruction as more play allow more pounding.  The
thing to do is to pull the joint(s) apart and inspect all the parts for
wear or other nasties.  Look for divots in the cage.  Grooves, pitting, or
material transfer in the inner and outer races.  Look for discoloration or
pitting of the balls.  Really, anything other than a little polishing,
anything which you can feel a dip in or a lip to with your fingernail.

Btw, the absence of noise doesn't mean that all is well.  I would
recommend rebuilding them every 30K for a street car, once a year for
a car which does a fair amount of track dates.

I had one of mine make the tell-tale noise last week.  Sure enough,
significant wear in the cage and two smoked balls.  This was on the left
side of the car.  I replaced it, then did three days at Bridgehampton.
On return, I pulled apart the right side joints, which hadn't made any
noise at all.  Well, they were *both* much worse than that bad left-side
one.

You can purchase just the joint rather than a complete kit of joint,
boot, bolts, washers, and lube.  Much cheaper.  You should also shop
around a little, because prices really do vary pretty wildly for CV
joints; no idea why.  The work is simple enough; I can post a how-to
if you're interested.

Well, I don't have a Cab, but do have a Targa and *did* have an '89
Cab top and pan clip that I was going to install in my car before I
decided to sell them...

Getting my Targa top done was the same sort of thing. I got quotes from
about a kilobuck down to about $200, but eventually wound up going with
a guy who had *lots* of experience on Targa tops, and who had the
OEM material in stock. He also had one of the best prices.

I would *HIGHLY* recommend that you ask for references and get a good
look at work any shop did, both recent and if possible a few years old.
That way, you get a feel for the quality of work you may get. I say "may"
because the guy actually doing the work may not have done the work you
examined. 

If possible, I'd look for a smaller family owned and operated shop with
*years* of experience doing Porsche and Mercedes (very similar) tops.

There was a pan change in '86 to allow the electric tops to be installed.
I have *no idea* if the rest of the top frame was changed, but there are
significant changes in the mount point, that hinge, and a couple of other
points to allow the electric motor to pull the top up and down. Something
to think about as you look at the newer seals, etc.

Just my two cents worth. I've done it all, from being a highly constrained
design engineer working on a big team to being "the vision guy" to marketing
to eventually running companies where I had to deal with all of this stuff.
There are some parallels between the way that Porsche AG got to where it is
and some of the ventures I've been involved in.

Since "the old man" -- Prof. Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche himself -- was basicly
an engineering and design consultant his whole life, the company originally
was just that -- there was this enormous "We Rent Brainz" sign in the front
lawn or something. And eventually, the light came on: hey, if we designed this
for Customer X, we can charge Customer Y for the same design! And from there,
it's real simple to get: but you know, if X and Y both wanted the design, 
maybe they'd just buy *THE THING* from us instead -- or maybe we could sell
it to *THEIR CUSTOMERS* and bypass them and make *MORE MONEY*!!!

That's how you get from designing suspensions to making whole cars! That,
and enough success at the design and engineering work to make sure that
you can raise the money to start building cars. And, of course, you want
to make sure that you have *customers* paying the overhead on your R & D
department, so that you can keep the very best and brightest people on your
staff for when you need them for *your* projects, right?

So the whole company sort of teetered back and forth -- do enough contract
work (which is ENORMOUSLY profitable) to fund the in-house car design and
construction, until it can sort of fund itself. Then apply the R & D guys
to the racing problem, since if you solve that for European road races
(we're talking the Old Days, when you used REAL ROADS) and rallys, you
have a car that will take whatever an above average driver can give it
in non-competition settings.

And eventually, the cars become such symbols of excellence due to their
superior performance that they become status symbols (trivia: anyone 
remember why Rolex became *the* watch to have? hint: it's veerrrry similar...)
And over time, you retire enough of the old hands that remember how you
got here, and all you can see is the Gold Chain Crowd. With their soft butts
and thin skins and refined musical tastes which require leather everything
and sound deadening and climate control and hey, this isn't a SPORTS CAR
ANYMORE!!!!

>Is Porsche now designing for excellence in design, racing or profiting?
>I don't envy their balancing act.

I don't either. And now that they have *SERIOUS* competition from the
entry level Japanese cars, and for that matter, some American cars,
it's that much harder. And the real question is this: say they *could*
deliver let's say a 911SC RS equivalent, in street legal form (sort
of the car the RS America could have been, but closer to a Carerra
Cup car with twin Recaro sport seats and rubber floor mats). How many
would they sell at $50,000?  $45,000 $40,000? $35,000? Remember,
we're talking *SPECTACULAR* driving performance, but not quite up to
the daily grind -- no "real" interior, maybe a cage, no noise deadening,
etc. I might sign up for one, or I might *BUILD* one for $25k from a
good mid-80s car. I dunno. I can just about gurantee that they wouldn't
sell enough to make a business doing it. So instead, you get things
like the 928S4, which is sort of like a Barcalounger with a jet pack.
Great, you now have a couch that can corner at 2 Gs. But hey, the older
softer crowd I mentioned earlier who wants to identify with Hans Stuck
going sideways at 150 MPH at Le Mans will buy one! And hey, if maybe
you sold something that looked more like the race car, but was completely
civilized, they'd buy even more.... 

I have a friend who theorizes that Porsche and Jag both have been selling
to the same people since the late 50s. Not to the same type people, or
to people in the same demographic group -- but THE SAME PEOPLE. If you
think about the evolution of the cars and how they're marketed and priced,
you might begin to see his logic...

>I imagine this is a pain for those with one tire being wider than a stack of

Yeah, but you *CAN* carry a "real" spare. Try that on a late 911 or a
waterpumper!

Interesting you should ask. Last time it happened, it was a rear tire.
The answer wound up being putting my passenger in the back protoseat,
and the tire in the front passenger seat. Only way it would fit, honest!

Hey, I like 911s too, and I drive one on the street.  But one real nice  
thing about the "waterpumpers" is the huge amount of room they have under  
the hatch.  You can easily fit a full-size spare in the well provided for  
that purpose in the back of a 944 (I know, because I have one  
semi-permanently installed in my ITS 944 as legal ballast).

By the way, some of my friends are more impressed that Porsche provided an  
air compressor with my 911 than with anything else about the car.  Of  
course, that's usually when I'm saving their butt with it.  If we didn't  
have space-saver spares, we wouldn't have that neat little device....

On the subject of what you can and can't get in a 911 my proudest
achievments are;

1.  Four Fuchs six and seven by sixteens with the tyres on! (one six
    in the front, one seven in the passenger seat, and the others in the
    back - and before I'm accused of 911 abuse they were all wrapped
    in plastic bin bags.)

2. 125 litres of bottled Belgian beer, weekend luggage and my SO. 

3. My SOs mother (who is lets say rather `ample') on a 100MPH+ mercy dash
   to Stoke General hostpital to visit her husband who had gone
   temporarily barking mad (true story)

(These were all on seperate occasions I would just like to point out!)

On a more serious topic, is there any advice for a neophyte braking
system flush'n bleeder? My visit to Silverstone GP circuit resulted in more
travel on the Brake pedal and a degree of softness that I don't really
like. The pads are about 6000 miles old, any advice on what thickness
I should replace them at and the ease with which they might be inspected?
Is it reasonable that I should carry out the flush, bleed and possible
pad replacement myself, given my non-mechanical engineering background,
and the `mission-critical' nature of braking systems?

Given the age of your car (87 right?), some of the grease has probably
seeped out of the boots, or you may actually have boot damage. If
you've caught it early enough, you friend is right, you probably
won't have to replace any joints, just boots and grease.

Yes, this would be the preferred plan. I would remove axles, completely
clean all old grease out of joints, inspect (only replace if major
damage, some wear is normal), repack, install all new boots, and
reinstall axles. Then if your clicking still persists, you probably
will know which joint is worn enough to cause it and can replace it
at some future date when the clicking worsens (assuming you don't
track or autox the car). Oh, yeah, you will need a special star drive
(not TORX) to remove the CV joints, I don't remember the exact size.

New Jersey, which currently has "The Garden State" plates,

that part of the fee will go toward ocean environmental projects.

When I was in Wash.DC recently, I saw cars with DIPLOMAT plates
parked in front of fire hydrants, on sidewalks, and anywhere else
they pleased. I don't think they have to avoid traffic laws like
the rest of us mortals, either. Question: Do these only apply to
foreign diplomats? or do U.S. diplomats and their families get
them too? If all you have to do is contribute gobs of money to
be a diplomat, maybe we could add $25 to our PCA membership and
*buy* the diplomat seat to, say, Germany - or $50 and have a
yearly lottery for the diplomat position AND a 959 to hold

Has anyone considered (as a short term fix) swapping the complete axles over

effect of changing the loaded  surfaces by 180 deg. ie to an as yet unused

In NJ, they say you have to register after 30 days.  I understand their
intent, but I think you have to be a resident for something like 90 days
before you're eligable to register to vote, so there's no justification
for the criteria to be different.  It's definitely an unfriendly law when
it comes to college students, "snowbirds", (retirees who go to FLA every
winter), etc.  

For students, I would remind them that it will be pretty hard for the
authorities to prove that you didn't drive home to "Mom & Dad" once a
month (laundry, of course!), thus be continuously reseting the 'clock',
unless you're around 1000 miles from home.  Interpretationally, just
driving over the border and staying for more than a day should be enough.

Of course, if you're trying to establish residancy in a state to get a
tuition discount at the State College, register your car first thing.

The case holes are 10mm inlet, 8mm outlet.  The case s/n is GA 004629

The pump is cast iron and poorly finished, the i/o ports have sharp

Subject: More 911 valve clearance 

During the on-going 911 valve clearance adjustment discussion, there has 
been no mention of any tolerance on the specification.  

It is probably safe to say that extremely accurate adjustment specifications
extract a cost in time and/or measuring equipment.  

So a tolerance on the valve clearance measurement is valuable.

From the Porsche Technical Bulletin 78-06 dated December 15, 1978

*****************************************************************

"1979 Porsche 911 vehicles have an additional 
 Emission Label inside the engine compartment
 lid."

"Valve clearance is listed on this label as
 0.004 +/- .002 in."

"For maximum performance, the adjustment 
 should be 0.004 in. without the tolerance for both
 intake and exhaust valves."

*****************************************************************

So the factory supplied an "acceptable" clearance range of 0.002" to 0.006". 

But the closing paragraph, Porsche leaves the reader with a
0.004" +/- 0.0000000... for maximum performance "goal".

There is no mention of how much performance suffers vs. valve clearance.

Maybe it's time to find my .0001" dial indicator.  

To carry to the extreme, what about temperature effects and residual
oil films?

No, I'm not being serious.

The 1970-911T valves were adjusted once with a borrowed Eurometrix dial
indicator tool, but I found it awkward to use, even with the engine out of
the car.  Maybe it was my inexperience/lack of coordination.

I'll continue to use my old 0.004" feeler strip as I have since 1974.
It's worked for ~200,000 miles worth of adjustments on 4 different cars
(years 66, 69, 70, 72).

I have never lost a valve, but three valve jobs have been done.
Exhaust valve guide wear IS something to worry about.

Subject: 911 Torrsion Bars

    James-

    If you check the archives a couple or so months back you see some
    traffic from and to me re changing torsion bars (sizes, bushings,
    how to, etc.) on my 1971 911.  I am not sure about any differences
    between a 71 and a 76 but I suspect enough similarity to provide
    my insight.  I too upgraded to 21/26s and contrary to some
     people's fears, my light car is not over torsioned.  You might
    consider even stiffer, especially if you track it.

    As far as special tools, no, not really, but a good protractor
    will help to set the rear ride height (you will have to do this
    after taking out the existing bars and especially replacing
    with the heavier bars).  As I recall, for changing out the rear
    bars, the steps are something like the following:

    1- Jack up car and support under body (you have to remove the
    tires and obviously can't use the torsion bars as a jack stand
    support!).

    2- Remove rear tires and disengage spring plate from trailing arm
    (keeping in mind which ecentrics/bolts go back where in the plate-
    these are you adjusters for camber, caster, etc.- and yes, your
    alingment will be completely out and you'll have to go for a four
    wheel alingment when your done- especially if you have lowered the
    car at all).

    3- Remove the four bolts holding the plate over the torsion bars-
    (you may have to get a jack under the spring plate an lift it
    slightly to unload the bolt at the lower back corner of the
    plate).

    4- Some people then simply horse the bar out (usually while the
    cap and all is still attached to the bar- prying gently on the
    spring plate until it pulls away) and with a hammer and vice grips
    or whatever smack and grip until the bar and cap are separated to
    allow the cap/spring plate to fall off and thus allow the bar to
    be pulled through the hole in the fender.  I found it better to
    drill a small hole in the end of the cap and spray in
    with a pentrating oil.  After the oil helped lossen things up, I
    made sure the deep end of the bar was broken free (not
    out, mind you) and then started to drive the
    torsion bar into the car by using a punch through the hole I
    drilled in the cap.  Before smashing away on the end of your
    bar (depending on how "clean" your car is, you might think the bar
    is welding in there or something!), make sure that the inner end
    of the bar is loose by about a half an inch or so and place a
    board between the spring plate and body to keep the distance- this
    space will keep you from driving the bar deeper into the center of
    the car. Also, by making sure the inner end of the bar is broken
    free first, after you have removed the frozen outer end, you will
    have an easier time by just having to pull the inner end out.

    5-  Once the bars are out, thoroughly clean everything (wire
    brush, pentrating oil, etc.), especially the inside of the torsion
    tube, and cap end.

    6-  At this point, you may want to replace your bushings (some
    people recommend at least rotating the bushing wear spot), they
    usually get pretty worn and if your putting new, stiffer bars in,
    new bushings will help them work better and longer.  The three
    choices I know of are factory original, Weltmeister street, and
    Weltmeister race.  If you do replace the bushings, check the
    archives for a very helpful message to me on how to do this, if
    you can't find it, ask me and I will relay my experience.


    7- Thoroughly lubricate/grease everything, including the entire
    length of the new bars and ends and assemble in reverse order.
    If you don't have access to any of the disertations on setting
    ride height, let me know and I'll try to shed some light on this
    process for you (or at least give you references to the
    authorities).

    - BTW the hole that you drill in the end cap can be welded closed
    again if you really want, but I just packed it full of grease
    instead.  Besides, you will really be glad you have this hole when
    your setting your ride height- it helps to fine adjust the bar by
    forcing to keep the deep end in but letting you remove and adjust
    the angel on the outer splines, etc.



    The front bars are much simpler and quicker all around.

    After jacking the car up, remove the adjusting bolts/screws at the
    end of the torsion bars in the A arms.  Pry of the cap to reveal
    the end of the torsion bar.  Wobble and twist the exposed end to
    break free the front end.  Pull the bar back and straight out.
    The factory manual and Clymers recommend removing the the A arms
    and thus disconnecting all the suspension, but it was not
    necessary for me to do it that way.  Perhaps if you don't have
    room to pull the bars straight back and out (it was a tight fit
    for me but it worked just the same) you might have to
    drop the A arms.  Also, if your bars are really frozen in place
    (i.e., rusted) you might have to remove the brakets on the front
    of the A arms and drill and drive similarly to how you did it on
    the rear (presumably you will just have to drive the bar straight
    back).  After the bars are out, thoroughly clean everything and
    grease and assemble in reverse order.  When replacing the
    adjusting cap, try to remeber what position it was before you took
    it off and this will help in setting the front ride height.

    Good Luck and let us know how it goes or if you need any more
    information.

A little lube job in your rear end?  Ouch!  Repacking sometimes helps, 
but if a CV is clicking then it's probably not too far away from 
failure.  The inboard ones seem to fail first due to xmission & exhaust 
heat.  Mine lost their lubrication through time and failed.

You're right.  If the races are wearing, grease won't reverse it.  You 
can drive a little longer with new grease perhaps (especially if 
they're dry now).

Pulling the half-shafts isn't too hard.  Unless, of course, one of the 
bolts shears (this happened to me).  Major pain.

Go get someone to show you how to do this, even if you have to pay a
mechanic for the privelege of watching.  Then have him or her watch *you*
do it.  Death sucks, bodywork is expensive.

Wrt. bleeding systems, either use a friend to pump while you bleed, or
get a positive-pressure bleeder such as the Eezi-Bleed.  The negative-
pressure systems are garbage, and I've found that people who disagree
with that opinion don't know what they're doing!  (Ok, kill me.)

Wrt. pad depth, I recommend new pads at 50% depth if you drive on a track.
The big reason is that the pad material sinks heat, and less mass means
a higher temperature rise (per stop or work cycle), and that rise means
greater risk of overheating the pad and fluid.

Hope this helps.

If you feel a bit of a "clunk" when you take the throttle off-idle, and
another "clunk" when you take you foot off the gas, you may have tootsed
the rubber centre to your clutch.  When it goes, there are metal stops
in the friction disk which "back up" the rubber centre and so keep the
drive shaft from spinning completely free of the motor.

They'll get you home (or to the shop); it's happened to me.  But you
have to be *gentle* on them.  I saw a car whose owner, er, really didn't
let this clunk/clunk bother him too much.  It went away when he smoked
the stops, and his car came in on a flatbed.

The bolts are M8 with what Snap-On calls "triple square" heads.  Often

overall shape of the head rather than the socket  You can get the
right tool from Snap-On.  I got a set of Stahlwille sockets from
Performance Products with a gift certificate I won; good tools.  Get as
short a bit as you can get away with, because you will be less likely
to strip the bolt's splines.

You'll also find it really helpful to have the right snap-ring pliers
for the job.  The Snap-On tool is PR40, about $20 I think.

Unnecessary if they're not worn or damaged.  And pricey.

Haven't had a bolt shear, but it's not uncommon to strip the splines
in the bolt head.  If that happens, get a pair of Vice Grips and lock
the lips of the jaws (ie, flats at the end) as tight as you can make
them on the bolt head.  And turn.  It works.

Several people suggest swapping axles side-to-side.  This is not a bad
idea if, when you disassemble, you find no problems.  What I do is
flip an axle inner-for-outer on the same side.  However, if you do
have wear or damage, you're not going to buy much by swapping ends.

"blew the 911 away".  The 911 driver was apparently pushing it to the limit

said he had the 911 beaten to a pulp from 40 to 120.  The 911 didn't beat him

A voice of experience..

        My 86 top got real beat from daily driving, so I replaced it last year.
I used a Robbins top - seams to be the best. I got it from a friend whose cost
was 700.00 - retails like 1150.00 or so. There are some real cheap quality
ones out there, where once you see how big the job is, the material cost is
well worth spending money on. I removed the top, no big sweat, but putting
a new one on is tough. The top piece is pretty easy, although the contact
cement doesn't give you alot of flexability in moving the cloth around
alot. I got a wrinkle in
one side, lifted up the material, which caused the glue to knot, and then
had to re-clean/reglue the piece a few times. The rear section is the
hardest - you've got to get the plastic window looking good - but at the
same time it has to be zippable ( a new word...) After about a day messing
with it, and alot of other
pressing projects at the time, I gave the car back to my friend at the trim
shop. They spent almost 1 day messing with it.
        
        I don't think I would do it again. It's not a real FUN job. Also there
are tricks that you can play with heat guns and steamers that help in fitting.
Hope this helps !

Ok Steve, I have the answer here. There is no need for your friends
to worry. The truth behind this one is that the 911 owner was just
manoeuvering for a parking space. It might have appeared to your two friends
that they were involved in a race with the 911 but in fact the 911 driver
probably did not notice them as he concentrated on getting the line
into the parking space correct. So you can reassure your friends that
they were not hallucinating anymore than usual, and that its the kind
of mistake that anyone could make when the balance of the mind has
been adversly effected by driving a `rolling object' rather than a Porsche.

Hello fellow Porschephilers.

My request for Danish 356 Panel's have been heard!!!

The Company T.K.Simonsen *EXISTS*!!!  8-)

So what???

To make a long story short; no dealers around would let me have Simonsen's
address or telephone number.But they would be glad to sell to me.

But I don't believe in Shipping 356-floors twice over the Atlantic( to the
US and back to me in Norway).

I checked all the registers, traderegister, telephone register, consulted a
few Danish dealers, Danes, .....no success!

Yesterday I took the 'Europages'(yellow pages for europe) and faxed a
request to all the Danish Metal Stamping Industries I found, 16 that is.

Today, by the Fax machine at office I found it!! Simonsen's fax with all
the info one would want!!

Even better, he offered me trader's prices, and the right to sell his panels
if I was registered Dealer.Well,....I guess I have to stick to my job and
not go into trading Porsche Panels (at least not yet) but I'll shure as
h*** get his list and offer and buy the lot needed for my cars!!

To all of you 356 friend out there, I will be more than happy to mail you
T.K.Simonsen's address & tel.no.

When I get his catalog/price list I'll be happy to scan it,and mail you the
file! Or post a copy.

For the one of you that remember (thanks again Reid) a 356 floor pestoration
series that was featured in 'Excellence' back in '89, The panels Harvey
Smith used were bought from ZIM'S but made in Denmark.He choosed these
panels because of their superior quality.This is the SIMONSEN PANELS!

I am happy! 8-)

Setaside the fact that these drivers probably weren't equal skilled,but
anyway a CRX could blow off stock 911's on twisty small roads.

If you really wanna' compare cars I guess a track is the place to go.

Street racing is sometimes safe, but mostly hazardous in my opinion.

The fact we have is; Steve has a friend with a CRX which 'blew-off' another
person in a Carrera C2. We don't know nothing about whoms Granny was
driving the C2,but she sure has a good taste in Cars!

Bottom Line: CRX,C2,C4,XJS,NSX,.....it doesn't matter what initials you wear

Nah, let's not.  I see enough of that drivel on the Talon mailing
list.  

Horrible admission follows:

OK, I admit it.  I love my 914. But I do have a Japanese
sports coupe for a daily driver.  Given it's spotty reliability
and impressive depreciation though, I wish I had the cash on hand two
years ago for a 911 (I didn't and the bank will loan lots of money on
new cars).

Just to provide some pricing datapoints for you lucky souls in the States,
the cheapest '79 SC I've ever seen is $22,000.  '72-73's get down to
$12,000 or so but I've never checked out the condition up close.  I
doubt it's pretty.

Oh, and I've been involved in motorsports for 15 years, I road race
(you know, sanctioned, licensed, safety equipment, all that), and I
rarely drive at or below the speed limit.  I do not, however, "street
race", and never have; it's infantile.

Subject: 911 Love em or hate em


A Couple of lines here cribbed from `Car' magazine.

Apparently PJ O`Rourke, the American satirist is said to have refered
to then 911 as an `ass engined Nazi slot car' 

Also in the same mag is an interview with Ferry Porsche, who is now 84 years
old (lets give the man a big hand now). Anyway I will just sum up a few
of the things that he says in the interview. Firstly, the Turbo
was his favourite from the moment it came out, and he did not drive
anything else until the C2 came out, which is the model he currently
drives. He also goes on to say that he would pick a 94 model 911 over
a 959 anytime, and that he is going to trade in his C2 coupe for
the 94 model 911 Cabrio (obviously no shortage of dosh in the Porsche
family!) 

He goes on to say that the continuing appeal of the 911 is due to
"The unmistakeable shape, the incredible performance and the unique
driving pleasure - the result of an unusually unique dialog between
man and machine. That may sound lyrical, but its true. There are precious few
cars out there that can accelerate faster or brake harder than our 911"

In addition he says "One of these days the Porsche range may
consist of just two models..both of which will incorporate the
spirit, and perhaps also the style, of the 911. One of these will be
an evolution of the new 911, the othera compact entry-level sports car"

When asked if there is anything he dislikes about the 911 he says
"I'm not a great fan of the louder colours, and I detest the aftermarket
add-ons"

So there we have it people, I think the moral of this story is, don't paint
your 914 shocking pink and drop a `murrican V8 in it, because if you
do Ferry Porsche will drop by in his `94 C2 Cab and piss in your fridge.

Slight deviation from P-car discussions(like this entire thread...)

  Nurburgring for $8/lap?  Is that the F1 course or the original long one?!
I was watching the DTM race on the long course this summer, DAMN!  That was
great stuff.  I've been thinking about trying to lobby with PSN (American
Cable Channel here in the states) to get the tapes for the European Carrera
Cup series for broadcast.  Hell, if they'll show the DTM series, why not
the Carrera Cup!

Regarding street racing...
I couldn't count the number of times I've had Vette, Mustangs, Mitsu 3000's,
etc, pull along side and want to race.  I've also witnessed a strange
phenomenon while on entering a highway: people always seem to start speeding  
up.

The best one was a guy in a mini-van with what looked to be 6-8
kids rummaging about.  I was driving up to an autocross with the RS
loaded with air tank, helmut and such going "slightly" faster than
the speed limit when I came upon a mini-van in the left lane. 

He wouldn't move over so I changed lanes to pass.
As I drove by a number of the children (primarily boys) had their
faces squished against the glass looking at my car.  I read their
lips: "Look, there's a Porshhhh, cool!".  They were all giving me the
thmbs-up as I passed, so I waved back. Just as I passed, the mini-van
began to accelerate (to about 80 MPH) and passed me.  The driver was
staring straight ahead and the kids were all looking back at me
and cheering. I downshifted in to 4th and feigned an attempt to catch up 

then let them pass and stayed back, not wanting to take away their
moment of triumph.  Just like the guys in the original post, if someone
gets a charge out of beating a Porsche on the street, okay.  It makes
them happy, and as long as they don't do something stupid, no damage
is done.  Don't expect the same consideration at the track, however ;-).

Well! It's all been said then...

If a 911 can't beat a CRX on such a lovely, winding road as HWY 9, I'm trading
mine in!

Seriously, there must've been a blue-hair with his ears sticking out the 
window causing drag driving that 911. It's true the CRX has very low center
of gravity, but suspension?!? I'm not here to fan the flames of the imported
car debate. Just that if there was someone who could accelerate on corners 
driving that expensive sports car, there would've been no contest.
(A friend of mine used to take his Norton to the top in 9 min.) It could 
happen!, said in the best Judy Tanuda voice.

HWY 9 is one of the prettiest, and most coveted roads in the world. I've read
in motorcycle rags where there are tours for enthusiasts arranged on the 
continent just to travel that road and the many other curves in the Santa
Cruz mountains (Alpine, Pescadero, La Honda, etc...) These roads are celebrated
and they're in my backyard!

If those Cabs were available on a broader specrtrum, or I should say, if I were
a rich man (appropriate humming here)...

Now, onto street racing. It is fun to lead someone to their demise on curves,
and how I love to break Mach 7 on straightaways, but who can condone
wrecklessness? Let's be like that driver on HWY 9 and be above the common 
pubile driver. You know what Freud said about cars representing a certain
part of a man's anatomy. So, don't be a d**k, drive responsibly, then blow
their doors off!

for my 911 3.4.  I used 2 cherry bombs welded to flanges which bolt

They are loud, but they arew not LOUD!! unless you get up above 5K

All this talk about CRX and C2, My! My!. Well lets get some thing going
for the 2nd class citizens of this list. Lets talk about the water cool
Porsche or shall I say the  watered-down 928. Well you know what I
mean, lets talk about 944s.

For starters, I was looking through Warchyski/JC Witney (sp?) catalog
and came across those after market Power door lock kit. The special sale
price is around $50 and it offers identical features as the one advertised
in the PERFORMANCE or TWEAKS catalogs for around $159. Some of the
features included are:

 - Lock/unlocks both doors simultaneously.
 - Option to automatically lock/unlock when the Ignition key is in the
   ON/OFF position.
 - Two switch to operate from console and/or door.
 - Manual operation from inside locks/unlocks both sides.

I don't know why such a price difference but it could be just that the 
Porsche after market stores will offer the rocker switch that matches
the OEM (does the switch really cost over $100??).

I would like to install this in my 944 and am soliciting opinions and
experiences from individuals who have installed after market power 
door lock in their Porsch-mobile. 

I hope 84-year young Mr Porsche, would not come and piss in my 
refrigerator for installing such non-Porsche After Market Items. But
then again it's not a 911 Turbo or a C2.

Been there, done that!!!!!  In the rain I might add.  But not in a

It remember the cost was 5 DM in 1988.  Might be more now.

> Is that the F1 course or the original long one?!

The long one.  The Nordschleife.  A.k.a the "North Loop" or "North
Course".  14+ miles around.  Over 100 turns, including the
Karrussel (sp?).  Not to mention various jumps, sweepers,
hairpins, elevation changes and of course the castle visible in
the distance.

I forget what the lap record is, but it was hard to comprehend at
the time.  Something around 5 or 6 minutes I think.

>  I was watching the DTM race on the long course this summer,
>  DAMN!  That was great stuff.

The museum is amazing too: A 1937 MB LSR car (twin rail frame,
V-12 (inverted?), no harness, and a super-streamlined polished
aluminum body), various 917s, F1 cars, and M1s, the Maserati 250F
used to JM Fangio to defeat Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins in the
1957 German Grand Prix, and a collection of F1 models which was
incredible by itself.

Only about two hours' drive from Spa-Francorchamps.  Go there.

Subject: 944 problems (the continuing saga...)


Hi there,

I have yet experienced a *NEW* problem on my old ailing 944
('86, 68000 miles) (I can hardly wait for the next problem):

Picture this: Sicily, 1959...

Just joking, picture this:

Halfway between Montreal and New York, star-date: October 17 1993,
in a place far from civilisation as we know it in the big cities
(i.e. where no Porsche repairman/repairwoman has gone before) ...

The cruise control is ON at 65 miles/hour. The car has been 
running fine for 3 hours at this speed. Suddenly, the speed
goes down to 60 miles/hour and abruptly kicks back to 65
several times...
I disengage the cruise control. 
I press on the gas pedal. The car lags a few seconds before responding
each time I need some acceleration. We stop at a gas station.
put some fuel injection cleaner in the gas tank and 5$ worth of
gas on top of a half full tank to stir the liquid.
Under the hood, nothing is out of the ordinary except something 
that looks like a black hollow tube, as thick as a cable 
wire with one end sticking out of the engine. I don't know where
the other end goes.  
The car works fine and responds immediately to acceleration
for the rest of the trip.
Since then, I have put 500 miles on the car. The problem has
never manifested  itself since that stop at the gas station. 
Is this voodoo magic 
or is the problem waiting for my next trip to New York to reoccur????
Are all tubes in the car really necessary or are some there just for show??

Regards,
sincerely devoted to continuously repairing my 944, day & night, 
as long as I shall live, for normal maintenance or worse,

Yes, it is the original long Nurburgring track. I drove it one year
ago tomorrow. It was DM14 (~$9) when I was there. It was a blast! I
drove a BMW 525i, not the fastest thing on four wheels, but definitely
fun. I videotaped the 1 lap and it took roughly 10-12 min to complete
it. Beautiful scenery, exciting blind curves and elevation changes,
and several superfast BMW 840i prototypes to try and keep up with (ha-
ha, I wasn't even close!!). BMW had some of their test drivers out
there that day playing with new toys. The track is not always open
to the public, but if so, then all you have to do is put on your
seat belt, pay the guard, read the waiver and GO! If you ever make a
trip to Germany, this is a must do!

I'll bet a lot of drivers have gone home bragging about how they "blew
my doors off" when I entered the freeway at 80 or so and they wouldn't
let me in. Yes, I could have easily made it past, but what's the point?

Around here, CRX's are second cars for a lot of of P-Car drivers, 
valued as "good salt cars" They drive them in the winter and hop back in 
their Porsches in the Spring. CRX's are great, cheap, entertaining - and 
quick cars, but out corner a 911? Only if there's some yahoo who is so 
paranoid about trailing throttle oversteer that he's never warmed
up his tires.

As far as Tiptronic goes, I still think the concept is interesting.
The Porsche test drivers can get around the track at Weissach within
a tenth of a second or so of a conventional shifter. 

I tried to get to the Nurburgring a couple of years ago by train, with
plans of hiring a cab to drive me around as fast as he would go (those
Mercedes 190 cab drivers will go 100-110 on the Autobahn) I got stuck
in Badminster Eiffel by mistake. Next time I'll plan ahead and rent a
car, but the $8 fee is still correct, I think. They even let busses on
though (long track, 32 or so miles) so you have to watch traffic - and
those German Honda CRX's!

Andre,

Sounds like you burped some bad gas.  I wouldn't worry if the problem
does recur.

Next time you change your fuel filter, btw, you might find it interesting
to drain the old filter from its inlet (ie, fuel tank side) into a clear 
jar.  If you have a lot of debris in the tank, you'll see it settle out
of the fuel you drain.  If it's really bad, it can clog your filter and
lead to a worse and deteriorating case of the hiccup you experienced.  
(Ask Ms. Gross about this...)  Not that I think you have this problem.

Wrt the mystery cable/hose, exactly where does it come "out of the engine"?

        Reply to:   RE>CRX vs C2
Of course street racing is unsafe.  And sure, the driver makes more than
just a little difference.  Put that aside for the moment...

FACTS:
1) The CRX is a light, nimble car (I've had two).  In 1984 R&T reported
that the CRX (1.5) sped through the 600' slalom at 64.2 mph, faster than
any other production car at that time.  And this with a live rear axle and
FWD!  (Yes, the pavement was smooth.)  0-60 was 9.8 sec.
2) Later CRX's were faster (the Si at 8.2), although not as fast through the
100' cones (62+ mph).  Rear suspension changes were made around '89.
3) The C2 was never as fast through the slalom (~61mph).  0-60 was 4.9.
4) There are lots of cars out there that can handle as well as (or better
than) a 911.  I can't think of one that's as satisfying to drive, though.

I've owned a lot of 911s.  Drive them right and they're hard to beat.
Drive them wrong and it's like shooting arrows backwards.

Steve,
  I suspect your friends are either pulling your chain and/or the driver of
the C2 was in way over his head.
  I once used a GTI to push a Vette all over the place but to put it in
context - the GTI was fresh from the Playboy Series (became Escort Series)
and was a real Showroom Stock car.  It was 'registered' in GA where they are
a little more liberal about street worthy cars :->  The Vette was owned by
someone that really didn't know how to drive it and on some twisty back
roads he was all over the place.  I quit playing, at my wife's urging, after
he got it sideways and off the road.  She didn't want to be part of the
impending plastic and blood mess.  She, of course, was right.  When we got
to the main highway, he regained his pride with a mighty roar down the nice
straight road.
 I might add that as I grow older and wiser (?), I find that this stuff is
best left to the track and use PCA and SCCA to get it out of my system in a

I suspect  you're noticing normal driveline "rubber-banding".  I've 
noticed this in my 951 too, partiularly at low speeds where the car's 
trying to decelerate, and it "bounces" off the engine's higher RPM's 
through the flexible driveshaft.  The driveshaft's torquing is the 
flexible link; it causes the engine and drive wheels to react against 
one another.

No, it won't bolt on.  The fender corners are shaped differently 
between turbos/S2's and other 944s.  Automotion sells a 951 look-alike 
kit to do this, but I've seen it and it's real low-end stuff in my opinion.

If your friend REALLY wants the pretty shnoz, he'll have to do fender 
work or buy 951 fenders (hoping there's nothing else underneath that's 
different).  I do not know if the nose connects to the aluminum bumper 
in the same fashion as a 944 or not...

Thanks to all who responded to my question about the mysterious
disappearance of dash lights in my 928.

After checking the fuse block - and finding 12v there. I moved to the
dimmer switch ( seperate from light switch ) - because it was the
easiest to get to. After removing the cover from the bottom of the dash
pod - and contorting myself into a position to see / feel the dimmer
switch - I found only one wire connected to it. After searching a bit,
I found the loose wire and plugged it back in. The dash lights are
working fine again.

Thanks again to those who sent advice / suggestions.

Subject: Spark Plug Sockets


    I've been changing plugs on aircooled German stuff since (choke)
1 9 5 7!  Except for the octopus arms, it seems like it used to be
simple and straightforward.  In the last 5-10 years, it seems, the 
job has gotten much harder, due to sockets that drop the plugs into 
the cooling fins, or drop off the ratchet extension, or leave the
rubber insert on the plug I just installed.  I think I have gone 
through a good half dozen rotten plug sockets in the last decade.

    Today, after shiming a recalcitrant socket so that it would stick
to the extension, it went and left the rubber insert around a freshly
installed plug, which I then had to remove, try to glue the rubber ....

    Has anyone had personal experience with the magentic plug sockets?
Are they worth the price?

Subject: What to buy?

Well, I'm well on my way to P-car ownership, but I'm at a loss as to
what to purchase.  The constraints are that this has to be a daily
driver, and I don't want the spousal unit to complain too much when
I end up having to fix the thing.

Things I've got a line on right now:

 -	82 Euro-spec 930, 31k miles, 2nd owner.  Car is currently in Las Vegas,
	but in order to get a pre-inspection done, I'm going to have to get it
	towed, as the owner is currently carring no insurance on the car.  Saw
	the car late last week while I was out visiting the parental units.
	Asking 28k

	No idea if the DOT conversion was done, or by whom if it was.  (I
haven't
	called to ask, as the owner claims that the car was delivered in
Sweeden,
	and thus passes DOT.  (The glass and lenses all have DOT codes on them.)
	The car looks really sharp, with Gotti (?) wheels, etc.

 -	87 930, 30k miles, 1st owner.  Car is currently in San Antonio, haven't
	seen it (yet).  Asking 40k

 -  88 930  57k miles (red/black), @ local dealership asking 39k,
	but we were talking 35 really quickly.

 -  89 911 Cab (silver/white) 38k miles, @ local dealership asking
	$35k, but they'll come to $33k easily.

 -  89 911 Coupe (light blue/blue) 21k miles, @ local dealership
	Car has obviously been hit once in the right-front, as the windshield
	piller has a bit of damage down low (next to the fender), and the
	fender doesn't fit quite right by the door.  However, it can probably
	be had for low-$20s kind of money.

 -  Stans '81.  (Stan can tell you about the car.)

I haven't driven any of them (yet, pushed for time today), but a friend
who drives a 944 turbo claims that Pcars fall to dust around 80-120k,
esp turbo models.

Yeah, I know I'm stupid if I don't get a pre-inspection done by a competent
mechanic, (anyone know of a good one in Austin?), and that I need to take a
(much) closer look at anything I buy.  I'm mostly seeking response on
the daily-drivability/maintainability/enjoyability/... of my choices.

Help me justify getting rid of my 'vette.  (Yeah, I know, "Eeeewww!")

Automotion advertizes a "locking extension" in their catalog (part
number TL-7060) for $19.95 that supposedly addresses the "falling off
the ratchet" problem.  I have not yet tried one, though.

EEEEEE!!! Run away, quickly, unless you can lay hands on the DOT and EPA
paperwork on this guy. If you get caught with a grey market car that's a
little closer to black than white, *YOU* get to pay to have it (a) converted
to appropriate spec ($5-9k, depending, these days), (b) shipped back to 
Europe, (c) crushed and melted. Just FYI.

Seems a good bit pricey. I'd guess more like $30k, maybe $32K. But then, I'm
a real hard-ass when it comes to buying cars.

Doesn't sound too bad,depending.

For an '89 Cab? That's not bad at all.

If the fender doesn't fit, then the rest of the unibody is probably
bent. If you can't get a deal that says, "contingent on car checking out
at your cost if it fails", walk away. If you can get such a deal,
then go for it. Then find someone with a Hunter frame machine and a set
of factory manuals, and make all 40+ measurements. If any are off more
than a few percent (like less than 5), don't do it. Unless you can
get the price dropped further, and can get the work done to un-bend the
car done at very good price.

> -  Stans '81.  (Stan can tell you about the car.)

Less filling, tastes great. Cheaper than anything else up here, probably
faster than most as well...

Plan on a new turbo unit every 20-45k miles, depending. The rest of the
car is most likely fine at that point. The bottom end of most 3.0 and
newer 911/930 engines should go to 200k miles easy.

Try Balcones. They seem to be big with the Austin PCA crowd. Further,
I know not. Try to round up Nick Peterson in Austin, also with the PCA --
he might have some good leads.

Subject: Re: What to buy?

Jim,

You're not at a total loss as to what to purchase, as you've 
decided to lose your 'vette for a Porsche.

From your list of prospects, it appears you're leaning toward
a 911/911 Turbo.  911's will be somewhat more reliable (especially
'84+ with motronic engines).

What's your daily driving commute like?  Non-turbos will be more
amenable to stop-and-go traffic. '87+ 911's and '89+ 911 Turbo's
will be better still with the G50 transmission and hydraulic
clutch.

If this is your first P-Car, avoid fixer-uppers like the accident
victim on your list.  Spend the money now and drive the car 
(spousal unit will also demonstrate approval if new purchase
is not a hangar queen).

What's your weather like?  If your climate is tropical (FLA)
or cold/wet/snowy, a targa or cabriolet will provide little
return for the extra money/hassle.  Assuming it's a daily
driver, and must get you to work, rain or shine.

If you are a CA resident, or ever plan to be, you cannot license
a grey-market car in CA unless it already has CA plates/title 
(ie. grandfather'd).  NEVER buy a grey-market car without
the original DOT certification and EPA exemption papers in hand.

A generally-accepted rule is to buy the newest car you can afford,
to take advantage of all the updates/improvements.

These days, $40K will get you an '89 911 Turbo, '89 C4, or '90 C2.
            $30K will get you a top-notch '87-'89 911

Average miles for these cars should be ~5000 miles/year.

As for falling to dust, I've had two Euro '76 911's, each with
100k+ miles on them, and they're nowhere near dust, despite
the abuse/neglect suffered at the hands of previous owners.
If a Porsche is maintained STRICTLY in accordance with the
owner's manual (including cleaning procedures and products)
the car will last 500K miles (several examples documented by
the factory, Christopherous '86).

Good Luck and Good Hunting!

How flexible are you?  How tall are you?  The answer varies.  For a

        Reply to:   RE>What to buy?
Jim -

Unless you're a real speed freak who needs to get to 60mph in less than
6 seconds, do not consider a 930.  Maintenance is too big an issue (difficult
and costly).

Any US '87 or later 911 in good shape (never damaged, original, and with 
proof of maintenance) is your best bet.  In '87 Porsche delivered a
hydralic clutch and the improved G50 transaxle.   And all the Carreras
have a proven 3.2 liter engine that should easily go 100k-200k with
nothing more than routine maintenance.  You can use these cars as daily
drivers and you will find outstanding reliability.  I wouldn't be too
concerned with mileage as long as you got proof of regular oil changes
and periodic tune ups.  Your friend is obviously misinformed, unless he's
recalling sad stories about '74-77 models.

I've owned an 84 cab, and now have an 89 coupe and an 88 factory turbo
look.  The 88 has 106k on it and still has the original clutch, transaxle,
and engine.  No unusual work has been necessary.  This is not strange at
all.  The cab was a lot of fun but I got tired of worrying about leaving it
unattended (and exposed).  It also didn't handle as well (which I wrote off
to a weaker structural rigidity in spite of the extra sheet metal support --
I have been told suspension updates in later years were probably more
material).  The 89 is a little quicker (lighter and more aerodynamic), but
the suspension and brakes of the turbo pkg yield bigger grins.

Certainly have any car checked out.  Here in the bay area most dealers
will push hard to cut a deal before any inspection, claiming they will
take care of any serious problems found later.  Don't buy it!  Find a
competent mechanic and pay for an inspection beforehand.  And get those
records!

Lance.

(My choice of the cars you listed would be the 89 cab.)

Subject: Misc. 911 questions


I have a few questions about some quirky behaviour my 911 ('86 Carrera) 
has.  Sorry if these sound a bit paranoid.  I just don't have another 
911 to compare against, so I have very little measure of what is "normal."

1) Does the oil level indicator show anything at all?  It seems to 
range up and down the scale, with no reason I can discover.  Someone 
told me this gauge functions only above a set engine temp.  Is this true?

2) When I shut the car down. the engine compartment gets this loud 
"ticking" sound,  (I assume this is heat-expanded parts contracting) 
punctuated with the occasional louder "ting."

3) Will rechipping the DME measurably improve performance?

Thanks.

Subject: Car-eating bugs

Well, not sure it really is bugs. But ... something has been eating the cloth 
lining of my 911 cabriolet which has its top down for the last 6 months (I do 
live in the Bay area California). There are now three round holes about the 
size of a nickel in the lining of the top. Does anybody have any idea what is 
causing this, how to fix it, and how to prevent it?

On a second topic, does anybody know where I can get some Kendall Motor Oil? It 
seems the Castrol 20W50 stuff is leaking out the engine main seal at the 
transmission. This problem disappeared when Kendall was used. Did anybody have 
the same problem with Castrol. Can I use other stuff like Pennzoil or Quaker 
State??? 

Please help.

This oil level gauge is meaningful only when the engine is hot, and idling
on level ground.  Compare its reading with the dipstick and it can be a
useful gauge.  Pay no attention to it when you're driving.  (Some people
ignore this gauge altogether, and rely on the dipstick.  Not bad advice.)

You are paranoid.  Your assumption's correct.

> 3) Will rechipping the DME measurably improve performance?

Experts disagree.  I have two comparable 911's, one with (Autothority 2.0
chip) and one without.  I cannot tell the difference.

Subject: international driving licenses [was: non-CA plates]

After all the talk about diplomats' plates and their getting away with
various infractions, I'd like to digress a bit more on the theme.... :-)

I was recently talking about the following scenario with a friend:

 - My car is registered in Massachusetts in my wife's name.
 - We have different last names.
 - I'm listed on her insurance as a family member driving her car.
 - If I get pulled over for speeding, I give the police my
  international driving license from Italy (even though I have also
  one from MA).

The italian driving license may not get me out of ticket, but there
shouldn't be any way this ticket can cause our insurance premium to go
up, since there would be no s.s. number shown on the ticket. Or do
they do any extra checks through the license plate to find out more
about the holder(s) of the policy? I think I would be all set, but my
friend disagrees... Can you guys poke any holes on my line of reasoning?

 Depends on the carabinieri who does the dirty work.  If you already have
a license in MA, then it would definitely pose a looming problem if you get
pulled over in MA.  I made the mistake of showing a UK driver license to
a slime who stopped me in NJ and he did a rather thorough search of my
name and came up with the fact that I already had a valid license in NJ.
So it was child's play for him to give me the hard way to go by issuing me
a summons with that NJ information rather than the UK information.  Of
course, since I beat the summons on a technicality, everything turned out
okay but the moral of this story is: do not hold driver's licenses in those
states or countries where you drive most of the time.  I've since not
renewed either of my metro area licenses (NJ and CT).

 The problem then becomes serious if you run into a real wise guy revenue
enhancement officer as a long time friend of mine did while letting his
Red Italian Redhead breath a bit on 87 northbound (NY).  The officer
examined my friend's papers and told him to wait.  No less than 90 minutes
later, he put BOTH of us in the police car and took us to the local
Municipal Court (on a SATURDAY evening).  There, a magistrate with a dour
countenance proceeded to raise the dead (with the help of the evil-looking
henchman troll who wore a shiny badge and large gun) then extorted a
substantial cash fine for my friend's freedom.  Fortunately, he was able
to pay but now no longer exercises his red mare on or near 87.

 Drivers be forewarned:

 The Government is just a mafia with the biggest back in the world: armed

Bruce,
You've been working on these air-coolers a bunch longer than I have but
I have a suggestion you might want to try. Works for me all the time.
Ya' need to get an old spark plug wire and remove the boot that goes    .
over the plug. Some GM wires have a really long boot to keep the wires
away from the exhaust. Anyhow, the boot will hold the plug tight enough
so that you can get it started and screw it in most of the way. This way
all you need the socket for is to torque it down. Also keeps the spark
plug from falling down into the sheetmetal. Good Luck, I hope this helps

Subject: Re: Misc. 911 questions

     I find the oil level gauge useful (now), but didn't when I
first bought the car..  As you know, the level fluctuates
widely.  A couple things affect the amount of oil in the tank.
Oil expands with temperature, so you will have a greater volume
when it is hot.  This is why instructions on checking the oil in
auto transmissions always specify doing it when hot.  The other
factor is the amount of oil in the engine.  This fluctuates with
temperature and RPM, and whether the engine is rapidly
accelerating or decelerating.  If the oil is cold, it will drain
back to the sump more slowly, so there will be more in the engine
and less in the tank.  My gauge reads low when I first start up,
then comes up as the engine warms up.  I only pay attention to it
at fixed RPM, say 2-3000, with the engine at normal temperature.
I keep the level on the lower half of the gauge under these
conditions.  The car uses very little oil, so the level gauge is
just sort of a sanity check that - yeh, there is some oil in
there :)

Subject: Re: Misc. 911 questions

I have an 87 911 Carrera and played around with chips a few years ago.

After speaking to Bruce Anderson (Porsche Club 911 tech chair), he sent
me some data he had been collecting and had me do a test.  The test was
to do several timed accelerations from 3K to 6K in 3rd gear,
capturing the time to 4K and 5K as well, with and
without the new chip and record the results.

What I found with the chip (I believe is was the authority, since they were
the only ones that would accept a return if I was not satisfied) was:

1. The engine ran rougher, you could feel the increased vibration in the 
petals...not uncommon when you advance the timing...

2. The engine exhaust note was louder under acceleration.

3. No matter what I did, in 5th gear accelerating at highway speeds, the
  engine pinged (Authority replaced the chip and there was not change).

4. The engine did not have the "911 rush" at 4K and felt more responsive between 
3K to 4K.

But, (and I don't remember the exact numbers and have since lost them)
the car was about 1 second slower on about a 10 second trip from 3K to 6K in 3rd.
It was also slower from 3K to 4K, even though it felt as though there was more torque.


The chip manufacturer told me that "no one else ever had this problem" and happily
refunded my money.  I've run the stock chip ever since and never thought about it
again.

Glad to enlighten!

Cherry Bombs are generic glass pack mufflers available at places like
Pep Boys, Track Auto, NAPA, etc.  They are glass pack mufflers with a
given inlet and outlet diameter (2" fits the header outlet perfectly).

They are basically the same as supertrapps without the silencer disks.
Super trapps are also glass packs but are rebuilddable.

As for Walker mufflers, I know they are supposed to flow relativelky
good but I havn't tried them.  I do know that a freind who has a shop
uses a pair of walkers for tracjks with dB limits (likelime rock) and
supertrapps for other tracks.

As for performance, I would GUESS these are less restrictive than
supertrapps with disks and aboput the same as supertrapps used without
the disk-pack.  As I said design is nearly identical.  my plan is to buy
a supertrap disk pack (maybe)_ and atach to the cherry bombs.

As for why I chose then - they were available and cheap, with an
emphasis on the latter,  At $30 for the whole setup, I don't have muh to
lose.  COparable supertrapps would cost abvout $250 for a similar setup,
but are definately better constructed and more flexible as they are back
pressure tunable vis the duiffuser plates (rings).

As for headers - I have heard that Martin Schneider headers are of
inconsistant quality.  I purchaced bursch headers and returned them
because they were cheaply made of thin metal with poorly formed bends.

The ones I got are available from Engine Builder's supply for $465 and
are manufactuired by European Performance (or some such) and look
identical to SCRS headers used by the factory.  They are well made and
rigid.

I did run into one problem: the left header did not allow for removal of
the lower valve cover when I received it.  Some careful bending of the
individual pipes fixed that (the Bursch had the same problem only
worse).  I got 1-5/8" dia. whcih is appropriate for 3.2+ ltr motors.

If you have <=3.2ltrs you may wish to go with SSI as they are not too
expensive, have heat exchangers, and are stainless., They run just under
$800 but are very nice.

One last observation on the subject of headers:  Most headers constucted
like they factory's are about 12" shorter than the "early" heat
exchangers/SSI and come with an intermediate pipe.  This is quite
desirable in my opinion as it allows you to cut the intermidiate pipes
in half and weld the supertrapps o whatever directly to them.
Additionally it allows you to have 2 setups without fabricating
additional flanges as boith ends od the extensions use standard 2:
two0bolt connections.

Lastly, on the subject of weight, I doulbt you could fabricate anything
lighter than my setup.  The headers AND exhaust tip the scales at 26
lbs, nearly 30 lbs less than the Stock SC exhast.  Of this a scant 12 lbs are
for the mufflers and bracketry.

Hope that beat the subject to death!

Steve

They only worry about the driver, not the car.  Cars don't break laws, 
people do!

I have 3 cars registered in MA but hold a CT driver's license (oh 
shoot, I shouldn't have broadcasted that!).  On those occasions I'm 
asked about this anomaly, I tell them I'm a consultant and have 
business in both states, but with permanent residence in CT (i.e., I 
say "Connecticut" when they ask where my mail goes).  I've had no 
problems in 4 years.  And my MA insurance hasn't been affected by 
tickets on my CT license.

In your case, with different last names, you & your wife will not be 
connected - it's just as if a friend of hers was borrowing the car.  At 
least for now - those computers are really getting good these days...

This happened to me too, many years ago while driving my 944.  An 
over-anxious New York trooper nailed me just east of Albany (an 
EXTREMELY active police area).  In my case they "accepted" my Escort 
radar detector as bail pending my mailing a fine to them, whereupon 
they returned it.  All this on a Sunday night.  It was apparent the 
trooper and judge were friends.  Justice, my butex!

What's it take to cause the noise?  Offhand, I'd start by checking
the parking brake for adjustment and the lower and upper shock bolts

  Try L&M auto painting in San Jose (Winchester near San Thomas, I
  think).  They quoted me $3,500.  I only have an indirect
  recommendation for them (I didn't have my car painted), so ask for
  references.

From:  lkeigwin@synoptics.com (Lance P. Keigwin)
I had L&M replace and paint the rear valance on an 84 911 cab and the
work was perfect (though trivial?).  They are always busy on Porsches
and other fine cars so they might be a good bet.

For quality work you might try BodyStyle on Brokaw in San Jose, not
far from the airport.  They are experts at Porsches and have been
recommended by several respected mechanics I know.  They did some
fender and hood work on my wife's 911 and the results were terrific.
The other driver's insurance paid for it so I wasn't too concerned
about cost.  It's worth a visit or phone call (ask for Cecil Beach, the
owner, who's been working on 911s for 25 years).

>Subject: Steve's Low Buck Exhaust

 And if I may add;
Glass packs are fine from the standpoint of size, cost, and flexibility.
The problem is getting enough muffle using very little tailpipe.
It is amazing how much attenuation a couple feet of tube following a
muffler will yield.  But the cramped space under a Porsche is not suitable
for long runs of pipe.  The solution seems to be dual attenuators.
The Ansa system for example, uses a system of resonator/glasspack combo
to get the db's to acceptable (livable) levels.
The glasspacks are standard straight thru type, only very short < 8" and
small diameter.

I like to use 'turbo mufflers' on my american barcaloungers, since they've
got gobs of room, the oval footprint fits wherever.  The spl is low IF they
dump into a half dozen feet of tubing, MUCH louder if you're just using a
header/muffler with no tailpipe.  These mufflers offer very low flow
impedance with less noise than a glasspack -and no backrap (resonance).
Cherry bomb makes both types. $25 YMMV.

Well Eric, thanks for your comment but ....

Yes, the MR2T is a very quick car, but I'd imagine that if some
one who knew how to AX took a '73 911E or 911S Coupe to their
region or to Nationals, this car could clean their clock. (not flame
intended->).   The 0-60 of a STOCK '73 E/S is 5.9-6.0 sec., before
you put the short 205/50/15 BFG/RSII's on it. With their STOCK
Limited slip and turn in characteristics, they cold do very well in
AS & BS ( maybe just beat an SS RX7 TT).  BUT (BIG BUT
HERE), this would only occur if they are lowered- if the new rules
are initiated & require US ride height rules, then they (the 911's)
would get their butt kicked in AS/BS big time!!! (here is where the
newer, trick Toy car will excel).

As for the 924S/944 w/M030 suspension, I'd imagine that they will
still do well in CS (944S2 w/M030 runs in BS) even if they are
required to run at US SPEC ENTRY ride heights, since these cars
are allowed LARGER (read very BIG here) Torsion Bars &
SWAY bars , as well as LDS & larger Wheels (specifically, the
924S runs 15 " rims (6" front & 7" rear), while the 944 had
optional 7" F & 8" R, but they are 16"- therefore no gearing
advantage, and the BS 944S2 is able to run 16" rims that are 8" F
& 9" R (can you say SS Fire Hawk.)).

Since I no longer have my 911 (big accident), I will miss running
in AS ( Drew, I'd be willing to help share $$$ for Nationals in '94
in your 911RS America...) but I'm glad I'm in HS with my very
slow  (read old) BMW '85 318i.

Oh well,.....my $ .02.

Subject: Painting Porsches (non-expert opinion)

Stephan Chan's original post about a $7000 estimate to paint his 911
got me to think about why it costs so much for some shops to paint
these cars. Don't worry Stephan, it's a "bit" out of most people's
range also. I'd rather buy 2000 acres in Montana for that kind of
loot. I've heard of many estimates in this range btw.

I am somewhat informed about what goes into painting a car, just
enough to make me look like an ass when discussing it. But, here goes
anyway, let me know what's wrong with this logic:

Assumptions: 1. The job is done by an experienced pro who knows
Porsche cars well. 2. He has one low-skill laborer who will do things
like disassembly and taping etc. 3. He is going to use top-of-the-line
materials. 4. It is not a restoration, but a paint-job, so only minor
dissasembly is required, no engine out. 5. The color will remain the
same as original. 6. Only minor bodywork is required (dents,
scratches) no frame or major sheetmetal repair.

Step one, appraisal and disassembly. Remove all rubber and trim,
possibly windsheild. Headlights etc are removed and bumpers "hung".
Laborer takes 5 hours to do this.

Step two, Strip paint. Either chemical strip or sanding to basecoat
for proper adhesion of new primer. Laborer takes 8 hours.

Step three, Bodywork. Fix dents and dings and scratches in metal.
Apply filler and smooth. Professional takes 5 hours. I'll give him the
benefit of the doubt that the car has some dings. Also included is
final taping of detail items before primer.

Step four, primer-surfacer coat. Then wet sand so smooth. Laborer and
Pro together takes 8 hours. Everything is perfect at this point.

Step five, Spray sealer and color. Pro takes 2 hours.

Step six, reassembly, laborer takes 6 hours. New rubber where
required. 

Step seven, final touchup and polish. Pro takes 3 hours.

So we have a total of 27 hours for the laborer and 15 hours for the
pro. Let's say, including overhead, the pro bills $75/hour and the
laborer bills $30/hour, we have a total labor bill of $1935.00. Now
let's add $600 for new rubber parts (not every one but quite a few)
and $500 for urathane paint system including primer and solvents. 
That's up to $3035, profit and all.

So, that's what I think it should cost to paint a 911. So Stephan, go back
to the guy with a printout of this and tell him "Look here you, this
guy says you're charging me $4000 too much!". Maybe you won't get a
black eye... :)

These are not impossible numbers.  I got 25mpg on my '85 on a 400 mile

The author writes, "The Bosch mechanical injection systems worked very
well when new and adjusted properly, but they are expensive to repair and
hard to keep tuned well when old, and difficult to get through a a two-speed
emissions test (idle and 2500 rpm).  The T with carburetors is a desirable
choice (or a conversion of the E or S to carburetors if the buyer is not

Clarification to above: prior to 1/73 mechanical injection was used;

With my stock 2.7L 75 911 I typically get 19 mpg in town and 24.5 mpg on the 
highway.  Also, the car got an outstanding 26.2 mpg in a three hour 90+ mph
run.  Is this a valid argument for having no speedlimit for Porsches? ;-)

Hello!

I'm getting ready to make a few *bulk* purchases so...

Does anyone know a good source for the dealer-style 911 oil filter?  I'm
talking about the pretty Peru-red looking one.  I picked up one in a bind
and it wieghed in at $13.  I realize the black OC-54 is the same filter but
the Peru red matches my car so well... ;-)  If there is more than a $0.25
difference I'll just get the black ones.  I'm not *that* concerned with it!
Just curious.  Thanks.

P.S.-
Anyone know of any big sales going on at a mail order place for filters, plugs,
gasket kits, etc.?

Subject: painting and 911


In response to John C's step by step painting cost estimate:

I would guess that step 3, 5 hours of bodywork is very low and that
this is where a big portion of the time is spent.  Even on the apparently
perfect, original paint body, there are tons of tiny imperfections that
show up big time after the final paint is on.  Rarely is the body stripped 
to bare metal, and this means that even  3 millimetre round paint chip is
going to take some time to repair without creating a 'wave' where the
area was sanded...

Having said that, I also think $7000 is insane!!

Subject: 914: Waiting for the gas to squirt

Hi!

I'm still working on the problem with my 1975 914 where it starts fine, runs
fine (when warmed up), but dies/coughs/chokes with the slightest touch of the
gas pedal when cold. I (finally) got my Haynes manual yesterday, and I know
what it's not. So now I am waiting on a fuel pressure gauge to check out the
cold start valve and the fuel pressure regulator...which brings me to my
question. Can the fuel pressure regulator be installed backwards? I didn't
see any markings to indicate flow direction, so I'm asking this just in case
I find out that I have a fuel pressure problem. I'm also kind of suspicious
of the whole thing because my regulator is on the left side of the engine
compartment instead of the right side (near where the "hard" fuel lines enter
the engine compartment and where Haynes says it should be).

Thanks!

Just killing time until the delivery truck pulls up.

I got 28 mpg in my '83 SC going from SF Bay Area to L.A.. This was when
the ambient temperature was cool (~60 to 70 F). Coming back I got
26 mpg and this was during a hot day (~90 to 95 F). My average speed was
around 75 mph. I never get this kind of mpg driving around the Bay Area.

Has anyone done a conversion from generator to alternator on a 912?  Are there

generator because all the lights in my car get really dim when I'm at idle
in the evening.  Its really annoying watching my lights go from dim to bright
and back to dim when I stop.  And no my electrical system is functioning 
properly.  

Additionally, does anyone know a better spark plug to use on a 912 than the

Yes! Both in the sense of inlet connected to outlet, and in

One of the causes of death of a friend's 914 2.0 was a reversed
pressure regulator. The engine basicly overheated from running too
lean (you can't get as much adjustment if it's backwards).

Wow! I don't want to become *that* good of a mechanic just yet!
I'll check it...even if I don't have a pressure problem!

While we're on the subject, and since you finished opening the can

                            d Start valve

I don't know (yet) which "Gas" is from the fuel pump. The _drawing_
in the Haynes manual implies that it should be the one on the right.
But the _photograph_ on the same page implies that it should be the
one on the left! So which should it be?

          1. Fuel pump                  1. Fuel pump
          2. Regulator        OR        2. Injectors
          3. Injectors                  3. Regulator

And which port on the regulator should the fuel pump be connected to,
the one on the "end", or the one on the "side"?

The $7000 for the respray was shocking!I can't see how he can justify
his estimate.(unless you were going for the 24K gold mettalic :))

Two years ago I had my GTV-6 repainted from a dark to a light red color,
this involved under the hood,inside doors and luggage compartment painting +
body painting.

I took the bumpers,lights erc off the car by myself,this takes time!
To check out my car I had to cash approx $1600,and the job was
proffessional!

Even better;this was done in Norway,at one of the better paint shops around!

Remember a 911SC 82 is $30000 over here,it is expensive as is service etc.
Just across the border, in Sweden,they are available at approx 1/2 the
price.

Subject: turbocharging a 944


I am looking at building a "project car" primarily for track and fun. 
I am taking my daily driver of the last 10 years (an '80 924) and 
upgrading the (lowered) suspension and engine to that of an '83 944 
(already aquired).  The 924 is already quite light and slippery so why not..

In pursuit of this idea I have a few questions for those in the know:

    Engine Swap:  

        1. Are there any "show stopers" in slipping the 944 into the 924?
           (motor mounts, etc... are not show stopers)

    Turbocharging:

        1. Does anyone know of any (successful) attempts to turbocharge a 
           normally aspirated 944? 

        2. Does the DME get in the way?

        3. What other mods are required?
            a. lower compression
            b. cam changes (which cams work)
            c. head stud kit
            d. (?)

        4. Does anyone have any dyno results of these attempts?

        5. (?)

Thanks in advance,

Brad.
    
PS. Is anyone interested in a transaxle from an '83 944,  asking $1200

Interesting.
Anybody ever done a comparison on fuel injection mileage to carburetor 
mileage? (given no other major changes).

In a way, I have...  Originally my 73 914 2.0l 4 with fuel injection was
consistent in delivering 36 miles per gallon at 70 - 75mph and using the
a/c.  After substituting a pair of weber 40idf and '009' distributor, 
and 3/4 race cam, the mileage remained the same. In town: 20 - 24mpg.
The car was more fun to drive because of an increase in control and 'punch'.
Dunno about emissions.
Top speed remained unchanged - 137mph. (my dad was passenger/witness/repeat)
In cold weather, the weber's didnt need a choke -just pumping.

Another trial using a (holley/weber?) 32/36dgv, yielded similar results
with exception to pinging and cold start choking.  One other annoyance
was chronic run-on dieseling.  Yuk!

Subject: Misc 944 Repair questions

I recently had my 944 right side motor mount, cam belt, water pump and as 
precaution my heater control valve replaced on my 85/2 944 with 41K miles.
Since the repair job I have noticed a few things for which I seek the
net wisdom.

 1. First thing is that my engine is now idle around 950-1000 rpm, after 
    warm-up. What is wrong here, the mechanic guess is "possiblely"
    the throttle sensor contacts are bad and want to replace it. His
    reasoning is that the shop computer does the idle adjustments that
    matches the company specs. I want to know why did this started
    happening after the above repairs and that could it be something
    that he messed up (i.e. back pressure that Stan talked about,
    yesterday).

 2. Second, normal operating temperature indicated by my temperature gauge
    is above the Third line and just below the Red line. If I park the car
    and let it run, the temperature gauge needle starts to come down. Again
    the mechanic says that he has checked the temperature of the engine and
    fluid (I don't remember how?) and it all seems normal. His guess is that
    possible, the  sender unit to the gauge is malfunctioning.  I don't
    understand why is he adding the word "possible" to both this and the
    above diagnostics. My question are:

      - Isn't there a better way to test it and be confident about the
        diagnostics? 

      - What is location of the temperature gauge needle on 944 under
        normal operating conditions?
 
 3. I looked at the back of the engine to see the new location on the 
    heater control valve. One end of the hose (about 3-4inch long) is 
    connected to the engine the other end connected  to the heater control
    valve is directly above a hole in the clutch housing. It was my
    understanding that the purpose of the upgraded heater control valve
    was to avoid the hole in the clutch housing if it start leaking.

       - Could someone with the upgraded valve knowledge tell me how the 
         new valve avoid leaking over/in the clutch housing?

       - What is the upgraded part number and what is the difference 
         between the old and the upgraded version.

  4. Previously someone on the list (I think it was Pam) suggested that
     there was a recall on the 944 Motor Mounts and that their dealer 
     replaced the motor mounts free of charge. Is this true that there
     was a recall and how can I convince this dealer about the recall.
     Even though the car is an 85/2  but it only have 41K on it.

This shop (Barrington Motor Werks for those of you local) is a Porsche
dealer, and the deal with German cars (Porsche, Benz, BMW  etc.). They do
have a lot of 911 and 944 in their work shop.  Since, I don't know any good
Porsche shop in this area ( 40 miles NW of Chicago, IL), I decided to go
their.

Any comments and suggestions and Sorry for the lengthy posting.

Affie.

I agree with the basic steps, but I disagree with the times you have listed 
to complete them. I just spent 2 hours sanding the paint off the hood (the 
hood only) on my 911, and I still haven't gotten into the ledges created by 
the indentation for the fresh air vent, which needs to be done by hand. I 
was using a 5" random orbital sander to do this, so it's not like I was hand 
sanding the car.

I don't know how long it'll take to do the entire car but I would guess 
it'll be way more than 8 hours, based on the knowledge that it took a friend 
of mind and I about a total of 20 hours to take all the paint of our 
Scirocco Rally car. And this was going right down to the metal which takes 
less time IMHO, because you don't have to be careful with the sander, you 
just keep going till you hit metal!

I would guess 12-20 hours to get the exterior only of the car prepped for 
paint.

I've seen estimates for painting a 911 that were all around $4000 provided 
you got the car prepped. i.e. took all the trim off, the windows out, and 
taped the car.

<more stuff deleted>

>> Step four, primer-surfacer coat. Then wet sand so smooth. Laborer and

hmm, personally I hope they put a few coats of primer on, sanding between 
each one, so I would guess this would be more like 16 hours too.

>> Step five, Spray sealer and color. Pro takes 2 hours.

again multiple coats, plus time between to set properly and sanding. Then a 
buffing down the final coat.

Also remember that this takes up space on a shop floor for the approximately 
6-8 weeks the car is in for painting, so storage is also charged.

All in all I would think your quote was actually right on, assuming it was 
for a colour change and included getting in the door jams, under the hood, 
and in the engine bay (as much as could be done without dropping out the 
engine)


just my 2 cents worth...

If I remember right, Calloway did a 944 turbo in about 85 or so.  Check
issues of Road and Track in that time frame to see just what they did.
I think they took some material off the pistons to lower the CR.  With
the introduction of the factory 944 turbo, they probably stopped doing
the conversions.

If it's really a 944 turbo that you want, it would probably be cheaper
and simpler to get a engine out of a wrecked car rather than trying to
do a conversion.  And then if you upgrade the engine in your 924, you
should also upgrade the brakes and the suspension and the transaxle and
... Pretty quickly you'll have built yourself a 944 turbo (perhaps not
so quickly!)  at great time and effort; you're probably better off
buying a 944 turbo and getting all of the factory engineering instead of
doing it yourself.

BTW, what other kind of 944 than a normally aspirated one can be
turbocharged?  :*)

Subject: Paint Job on a Porsche

My brother used to do a little auto body
work and was telling me how difficult it
is to redo paint on Porsches and BMW's
because of the base coat composition.
His experience (with the early models he worked
on) is that the base coat was quite thick
and very tough, which made it hard to "work
in" the finish of any repaired body areas to
the existing finish.  This may have something
to do with why the price of a paint job might
be so high: it may reflect the extra time in
sanding down to the metal or the extra time in
'working in' any repaired areas to the existing
base coat.

OK, having just looked at my 2.0, and pictures of my 1.8 (taken before
I sold it), here's the deal:

Routing is: gastank -> fuel pump (with feedback loop to gastank for
overpressure situations) -> filter -> injectors -> cold start valve -> 
injectors -> pressure regulator -> back to tank.

Mounting for the fuel pressure regulator: on the 1.7 and 2.0 it is
on the driver's side, towards the back of the engine. Thus, gas under
pressure from the pump comes up the passenger side, then around the
injection plumbing, then to the regulator on the driver's side, then
back to the tank.

On the 1.8, the pressure regulator mounts almost exactly where the
manifold pressure transducer mounts on the 1.7/2.0 -- near the battery.
Thus, the plumbing is *backwards*, going first to the driver's side
FI stuff, and exiting back to the tank from the passenger side.

On both, the pressure inlet is on the side of the regulator, and the
outlet back to the tank is on the end.

I am relatively new to Porsches (graduating from years of GTI's and dreaming)
but I can tell you that European Car Magazine did an article on just such
a swap not to long ago. It did mention (foggy memory) moving some fuel
injection equipment and maybe the exhaust was custom. Other than that I 
believe it was a staight forward swap. Also, I do remember the doctor who
autocrossed the car did Whuup the '44's with the lighter ~150 hp '24.
But it still doesn't look like a 944! But that is my problem and
obviously not yours. :-) Good luck w/ the conversion.

Oh yea, I just browsed through my ANDIAL catalog and noticed that they
sell a mild performance cam for both the 944 and the 951.  So I wouldn't
think you need to change the cam when t-charging the 944.

If you are looking for something in the East Bay, you may also want to check out

you can mention this conference or my name if you like. They are located in
Alameda. As far as the hours that was posted in a earlier note - in my
opinion they are pretty low in some areas. 
Dings and small stuff do take time to get perfect - esp if you are painting
Black. Basecoat, if you do a 2 stage - will take a couple of hours assumimg
2 -3 coats with a little wet sanding in between. Remember, it's not just
the spray time, but it's the gun set-up, the mixing, taping ,spraying, wet
sand any dust/runs/clean-up etc. Buffing a car start to finish for example
is a good days job - from wet sanding, buffing,glazing,waxing,
clean-up/lunch/chit-chat. The other thing to remember is that material
costs are crazy for good stuff and personally I wouldn't want a shop to

 In response to Glenn and Eric on 911's competing in SCCA Stock Class Solo
 II.

 It is easy and sometimes fun to play what if games while looking at the
 results from the SCCA Nationals in Salina. However, unless you are there and
 participate you are missing the real fun. Be careful comparing times from
 day to day or even heat to heat as the famous Salina grip can disappear very
 fast due to the tar strips heating and oozing onto the course or the rapid
 Kansas temperature drops, etc.

 Concerning RX-7's, as a veteran SCCA SOLO II National participant of the
 past several years, including this year, I can confidently say that on the
 1993 courses there was no way a '73 911S could have won in A stock...NO
 WAY]] I was there, I saw it, I lived it, and there was absolutely no way.

 Although I didn't drive a 911 with the legendary 2.4 MFI engine, my '74
 Carrera is no slouch. True a Carrera is heavier (weighed it in Salina this
 year at 2375lbs) and yes has 15 less HP, but it benefits from better torque
 characteristics and I can legally run 7 and 8 inch wheels.  As far as
 driving ability, at the risk of sounding boisterous, I feel I am a
 competitive national driver, having trophies numerous times at Salina and I
 can even claim beating past National champions like Mike Piera and King
 Thompson (every dog has his day once in a while).

 With the preceding buildup let me go on to say that this year was almost
 embarrassing, I got creamed by the RX-7's at Salina  finishing 10th out of
 21. Everyone has good days and bad days but when you get beat by four
 seconds there is probably more to the story. Maybe if (choose one): the
 courses would have been tighter, my car would have been running better, I
 would have been driving better. I doubt if any excuse could have made up my
 deficit here, its simple, the RX-7 is faster .

 OK...enough of this babbling, my point here is that with equal drivers a
 911, probably any 911 and certainly my 911, is no match for the new RX-7 on
 99 out of 100 AX courses. Only if you could design a course which was twisty
 enough to keep the RX-7 out of the boost and yet fast enough to be in the
 sweet spot of a 911...maybe.

 Also, the new SCCA rule eliminating lowering was probably not targeted
 specifically at the 911 but never the less it killed any hope for 911's in A
 or B stock and will keep me from ever considering running in stock again. I
 have yet to hear a logical explanation for this stroke of genius. Sure all
 cars can't be legally lowered but then again all cars don't have ABS and yet
 the ones that do are allowed to keep it. I would go on and tell you what I
 really think about this rule but Stan would probably drop me from the list.

Subject: 914: The gas squirts, but...

OK! Uncle!! What's Mr. Weber's phone number!!!
No, no, no...sorry. I just lost my head there for a second. 8-)

Hmmm. Well it's the usual thing -- nothing's wrong, but nothing works.
Sorta.  It "seemed" to do better when I first started it (today -- and
all I've done is "check everything").  But then maybe the exhaust
fumes were impairing my judgement. The RPMs still drop off when you
you try to increase the speed (when cold) but it's not quite as bad as
it was.  And I still seem to have a "turbo lag" (coined by Alex
Noordergraaf when he was woking on his '74 914 in May -- ahh, those
archives!) when you step on the gas with the RPMs above idle (when
warmed up a bit).  Technically I guess that would be a "non-turbo
lag" 8-).

Anyway,

Static fuel pressure:  36psi (engine not running)
Steady state pressure: 30psi (engine running - any RPM)
Transient pressure:    34.5psi (running the engine speed up and
                                letting the vacuum "spike" the fuel
                                pressure)

All of the pressures are (real) steady and transients are smooth.

Haynes says that the first pressure should be 35 +/-1.4psi -- so
that's pretty close. But then in the front of the chapter it says that
the _operating_ pressure should be 35.7psi. Does that mean with the
engine running (if so I'm way short)? Now things with the engine do
seem to improve (idles smoother, is a bit more responsive) when I just
disconnect the vacuum line from the fuel pressure regulator and have
it maintain a constant pressure of about 35.5psi (instead of the 30
psi with the vacuum line connected). The recovery from non-turbo lag
definitely occurs when the fuel pressure begins to go up. Is the fuel
pressure regulator maybe just not responding to the vacuum change fast
enough? Should the pressure spikes be higher? But I still get the lag
with the pressure constant at 35.5psi.

Should I just try running without the regulator vacuum line connected
(for a while)?  I can't imagine that the injectors were "taken care
of" by the last owner so when I filled up (foolishly thinking that I
would actually get to spend the gas driving down the road, instead of
fumigating the garage 8-) I put in a bottle of injector cleaner. Does
that stuff work "right away"? The engine has run for a total of about
20-30 mins with the stuff in the tank. (I also put in a bottle of
octane booster. I can't get anything above 89 around these parts, and
the poor beast wants at least 92 -- a reasonable request in '75).

Way back when I said that I thought that the engine was being flooded
(running rich) when you tried to step on the gas. WRONG. Disconnecting
the head temperature sensor and running the engine...THAT makes it run
rich (the garage fills up with smoke, even with the doors open!). Now
I think it's running really lean and just being starved. How do you
adjust for that? (WEBERS! Sorry...I slipped again 8-) New air flow
sensor (but its ohms look good)? Can/should the stator flap be lubed?
That might cause the lag. New brain?

This may be way out in left field, but the control unit is mounted
standing up (wires connecting to the bottom). Every picture I've seen
has it laying down. Is there something mechanical in there that might
require it to be on its side?

So many questions, so few parts. It's really a simple system. Trouble
is it's made to have parts replaced, not adjusted.

Thanks again.

I like that quote, "the computer did it"!  The idle speed is controlled 
by a closed-loop feedback system.  If the idle control valve and DME 
are working, then the idle will self-adjust to spec.  However, if the 
"center" idle speed (the natural idle speed if not changed by the idle 
stabilizer) is outside the range of the idle stabilizer, it will not be 
correctable.  Sounds like your mechanic just goofed.  Insist that he fix it!

I'm sure they all vary a little bit, but just about mid-scale should be 
right.  It should never approach the upper white mark.    The 
fluctuation you describe is exactly what an improperly bled cooling 
system would show.  I'd bet money you've got air in the system.  In the 
meantime, you might be hot-spotting the head and causing damage.

I'm not aware of this particular fact - maybe things have changed?  My 
new valve (a couple years old now) was identical to the old one.  
Sometimes they just change internal design, etc.  Your mechanic can 
move it a few inches (away from the bell housing hole) with different hoses.

There was never a formal recall, but the engine mounts are a very well 
known problem that some dealers will help you out with.  They've been 
through several designs and the current one (for the Turbos) seems to 
work.  You might approach the dealer with a story about how everyone 
knows how crappy the part is (well, maybe only 10,000 or 20,000 
people), and that they should at *least* pick up the mount cost (around 
$175-$225 each).  Maybe cut some deal like that...

My experience has been that there seems to be this expectation that if
a 911 get's beat by whatever, the driver is solely deficient.  In my 

case, I'm sure they're at least partly correct, but the facts speak for
themselves.  It's tempting to swap cars with one of these guys to see if
it's really true...

I've had the opportunity to drive the new RX-7, and came away with the
impression that it is a hell of a lot easier to be fast in this car than
a 911 (at least at autocrossing). 

Other than that, I thought it was a piece of crap (a conclusion
agreed upon by Rod Derrick who 3rd in AS last year in an RX-7TT).  That
said, the absence of 911's in any appreciable volume at SCCA events takes
away much of the leverage to rectify this situation.  The concensus I've
been able to get thusfar, is that the classification is based partly on 

fact, and mostly on politics and $$$$'s (maybe things would change if 

Porsche would start running ads on the back of SportsCar ;-| ).

The proposed rule change has less of an effect on my RSA (coil-over's) than
torsion bar cars, but I've been able to the the RSA lower by dropping 

the threaded spring perches down by about 1".  It still looks like a 4X4  
compared to most of the local Carreras, but it did make a difference.

Well, if it's any consolation, I feel very much the same.  I'm sending a letter
to the SEB to vent my speen to see what they say.  Based upon converstations
I've had with one of the board members, I'm not expecting much simpathy.

Which leads me to a MUCH more pleasant topic.....

Anybody planning on attending the POC time trial at Willow Springs
on the 30-31st of October? (okay, it's not Silverstone, but it's not bad!).

I've finally got a weekend without other commitments and the wife's sick
of hearing me whine about the local racing season being over with so it
looks like I'll finally get a chance to try to scare the shit out of
myself in the RS =8-).  


If anyone's planning on attending, I'll be glad to host any Porschephiles at

I also got my best mileage at 90+ (sometimes ++)
with my '73 911E

I chalked it up to non-Newtonian physics. I never
quite reached the speed of light though.

As far as the price of a paint job, you generally
get what you pay for. A Porsche that obviously
looks repainted is devalued by several thousand
dollars, so it's a "pay me now or pay me later"
issue. The value and collectability of your
car is a consideration. A $7,000 paint job on
a '73 911RS might not be enough, whereas not
too many people would spend that amount on a
924.

Often times you can work with a shop and do a lot
of the labor intensive stuff like clean-up and
disassembly/reassembly yourself. That will cut
the cost by approx. 30-40% and allow you to
get an outstanding value-preserving paint job
for the cost of painting a normal car.

Hello !

I am just starting the search for an early 911,perhaps a '64 (if possible)
but I could live with a '65 too. 

Well (uhuum) into restoring my '58 A coupe,It is time look around!

Basically I'd want a '64,as it will be 30 years next year!And for all of you
that do not know,this is the only kind of cars you'd ever dream about
importing to Norway!Why?We have this special import rule for 'Classic Cars'
anything 30 years or older is *VERY* cheap to import.That's why.:)

Because of our stiff car import taxes,Porsche's are very expensive.I looked
at a 1970 model project car some time ago and boy was it messy!The messiest
above all was the price,hold your hat, $15000!!!!Basically a $3-4000 car in
America in my opinion!It was changed to 75-76 spec's too! :(

What I would like to get a feedback on is;
Should one go for a car that basically never has been touched,tatty,some
rust,ok mechanics....??If it possible to find one!

Or would you rather go for a car that has been rebuillt a few times and often
not better than the 'untouched' car when you start stripping it!??

Some rust is really no problem,otherwise I wouldn't touch my 356's! :-)
Rebuillding mechanics is expensive,and not as easy as putting together a
400HP Chevy 350 either I understand from some of the articles in the group.

I guess a 901 is outta' reach,but it would have been nice to have a fellow
'63 model!A last question;what prices could the mentioned cars go for???

cheers,

Subject: 911's in SCCA (vs RX7 TT's) & Ride Heights....

Mr W.....,

Thanks for you input into NAtionals this year.  Though I didn't go this year,
I know what you mean about the Salina 'snakes' and how traction can go
away (I ran out of gas on my last 'killer' run at the 91 Nationals... &
I rememeber your Carrera, ..).  I agree that the RX-7 TT will kill any
911 on 99/100 courses, but if that course is tighter and less grippy (sp),
then a 911 will give them a run for their $$$$. Nationals, with the wide
open (relatively) course design does not really represent many of the local
courses in the West (IMHO), except like Wendover (a truely 'special' place!

The RX's are much easier to drive than a 911, but I'll never trade the
scream of a 2.4 911S with a factory sport muffler for a rotary rice rocket,
even though it'll beat me, I'll have more fun (Porsche freak speaking here).

As far as ride heights DREW, seems that SCCA may enforce incoming DOT spec
ride heights to cars with adjustable suspensions (torsion bars, threaded
perches, or otherwise...), which will make you run you car at 'original,
US delivery ride heights' (>BIG< bummer hear, since we both know how
much a difference lowering 911's make....) Frankly, this rule will cause
P-cars to be even more un-competative in their current classes (time to
fire up the re-classification form letter....).

Hopefully, we'll get more specific data on the EXACT ride height #'s
in January, '94.  Heck, maybe they will move 911/944S2's to
C Stock, 924S/944's to D Stock, 356's to H Stock! (SCCA CLASSES)

Oh well, we can dream.....

Hi guys!

From Paul Callopy:
>...check the air sensor flap movement...

Here we go. I got brave (actually I got tired of making the bald spot
that I've scratched on my head bigger) and pulled the cover off of the
air flow sensor electronics compartment. Oooo, parts! First I checked
the movement of the flap.  It moves very freely. No scraping or
anything. Next I looked at the "poteniometer" that the wiper connected
to the flap runs across as the flap opens (it's actually 10 segments
on a printed circuit card). There were "tracks" where the wipers ran,
so I Q-tipped and alcoholed them off (there was a little dirt, but not
much). Then I figured I'd check the resistance between a couple of the
connections as I moved the flap/wiper. !!!! The readings are very
irratic. It sorta jumps all over the place as the flap opens. There is
a general upward trend. At this point you would think that a "eureka"
is in order. Ahh, but wait! I got the engine running and it was doing
its usual bit.  But if I "helped" the flap open when revving the
engine (so it was open a bit more than it wanted to be) IT DID JUST
FINE!! In fact if I helped it too much it would do worse.  I started
bawling at this point ;-(

So now the big question(s):

Should the flap be opening further? If so, how would the spring (it's
a watch spring type arrangement) that must have worked at some point
in time, all of a sudden have a tension INCREASE that keeps the flap
from opening up enough?  The watch spring tension appears to be
adjustable. Has anyone played with this?

OR

Has there been some sort of loss/decrease of bias to some transistor
in the control unit (I assume there are some in there)? This might
make the control unit think the flap is not open as far as it is
(we'll ignore the erratic resistance readings for now since I can get
the engine to perform well with it). Is it possible that this is
adjustable? I've had the cards in the control unit out of the box, but
I've never separated them from each other (so I can get at the good
stuff). Is there a schematic of the control unit in those Bosch FI
manuals? If there is I'll buy one of those.

It's GONNA work! I can feel it.
At least I know the system works...it just needs a bit of help.

Thanks!
Bob

Subject: 911/912 Struts

The infinite wisdom and counsel of the net is sought...

I have a '68 912 with a front tire that is at a -2' camber.  The strut is
mounted on the farthest point out on the shock tower and there's nowhere
else to go to set the camber any closer to spec.

The guy who works on my car told me he went to a Porsche dismantler in
Watsonville and picked up two or three used struts and tried them all
out and the camber still came out to be negative.  He then tooled over
to Automotion and had them pull out a new one and noticed that the place
where the spindle mounts to the strut was angled out more than those he'd
pulled from the junkyard.

SOOO, after that long story, my questions are...

1) Any of you 912/early-911 owners know if bent front struts are pretty common?
The guy that works on my car said they were known to be easily bent by a good
pothole encounter or a curb bump.

2) Where's the best place to pick up a new strut without breaking the bank?

3) If it's not a bent strut, how can I tell if the shock towers didn't get
tweaked around in an accident prior to my ownership of the vehicle?

Porsche friends, I need your advice in a couple of issues:

1. My 84 Carrera Targa has an anoying rattle inside the driver's door.
   What is the procedure to remove the door panel and check things out?

2. At the same time that I remove the door panel, I would like to adjust
   the stop that controls how high the window can go. I noticed that
   the top edge of the glass overshoots the rubber moulding. Is this
   easily done? How?

3. Is there a way to adjust the height of the accelerator pedal? I'm
   trying to bring it up a bit to be able to heel-and-toe. I feel that
   the acceletator pedal is too low to be able to blip it and bring the
   rpms up to match the car speed.

   I feel this will save wear and tear on the synchros and drive train.
   Can this be done without messing any of the adjustments?
   (e.g.: throttle stop, DME sensors -if any, etc)

   Are there any mechanical links that could be changed? If so, where
   are they? Has any one done this?

4. The manual says that "The center outlets provide outside air" Is this
   true? I only get air from the dashboard center vents when the A/C is running.   The lever that controls air flow (up/down) seems to work since it
   changes direction from footwells to defroster/side-vents, but nothing
   comes out of the center vents. Is this normal operation? Does the fresh
   air feature goes away with A/C?

The original clutch is a Fichtel & Sachs part.  You could put a spring-
centre clutch by using the friction disk from a 924 Turbo.  But consider
this: your rubber-centred clutch has lasted nine years.  Pretty good deal.
Moreover, the rubber centre isolates the transmission from mechanical
stress better than the spring-centred part.  In that sense, it is a little
"sacrificial," and better to sacrifice one of them every nine years than
yours transmission.

In the MY87 944S, the heater valve was moved from behind the block to
be spliced into the hose from the water pump to the heater pipe, ie, above
and next to the oil filter.  To make this change, I assume that you would
have to replace the hoses at the back of the block and these hoses at
the front, plus the vacuum hose.  Your dealer can get the p/n's off the
fiche.  I have recommended making this change a bunch of times to a bunch
of people, but as far as I know no one has done it.

Never a recall, but PCNA has replaced many under warranty or as good will

Subject: Re: RX-7TT vs 968 CS 

Yeah, a while ago I wrote something about the 968 doing fairly well in
Australia.  This was in the production car endurance races.  This series has
started getting a lot of attention in the last few years.  The races are
televised, and the advertising from oil companies and the manufacturers seem
to include the productions cars a fairly often now.

In the 6hr race it came 1st and 2nd, in front of the RX-7tt which were 3rd
and 4th, then followed I think by a Honda NSX.  The reason that the Porsche
won was that in the endurance race it was getting much more miles for a full
tank of gas, but had to put up with a heavy load early on.  Probably the main
reason it won was because of the brakes.  The RX-7s were doing a pad change
every hour.  The Porsche went through the entire race without a pad change.

In the 12 hour race they just got beaten by an RX-7.  I was in Europe at the
time so I am not so sure on the details....  Anyhow the RX-7 came first,
followed by the two Porsches.  Now here is where all the details get foggy.
The two Porsches were disqualified!!!!  It turned out that the wheels made in
Australia by Simmons to Porsche specs were a few millimetres (probably 1/16th
of an inch) too wide.  The had the Mazdas in scrutineering for 35 mins or so,
yet I heard the Porsches were in for many hours.....
So in that race Mazda ended up with 1-2.  The ARCC body which controls the
regulations does not seem to favour Porsche very much, and I hear that
Weissach are not too happy with what happened.

Next year the 968 CS turbo is supposed to be running.  Apparently it is
rumoured that if POorsche runs this car the other manufacturers are not going
to race.  BUt they said it should run rings around the RX-7.  It has 18in
wheels and apparently the vents in the brake rotors a big enough to p[ut your
small finger down.  We will just have to wait until next year. B-)

Subject: Euro pistons for 931 - good/bad?

Hi All -

I'm in need of wisdom.  I've been toying around with the idea of perking
up my 81 931 a bit by replacing the stock pistons (8.0:1) with euro-spec units
(8.5:1).  These, plus a new wastegate spring, ought to wring 170-175hp out of
the old mare, which would fun, and since I've currently got the engine
apart (to re-ring and fix a scored crankshaft), there's virtually no labor
cost involved.

Question is, though, are there any potential downsides to doing this, or is it
pretty much plug 'n play?  Head gasket should not be an issue (I'm using
Raceware head studs), but I am worried about whether or not higher
compression pistons would generally require changes to FI or timing to maintain
smooth operation, especially at low rpm's.  This car has a DITC timing setup
that I believe would be a pain to modify.  Beyond that, what other trouble
am I opening myself up to?

The original clutch is a Fichtel & Sachs part.  You could put a spring-
centre clutch by using the friction disk from a 924 Turbo.  But consider
this: your rubber-centred clutch has lasted nine years.  Pretty good deal.
Moreover, the rubber centre isolates the transmission from mechanical
stress better than the spring-centred part.  In that sense, it is a little
"sacrificial," and better to sacrifice one of them every nine years than
yours transmission.

Subject: 901 Trans Question

After installing my engine/trans into my '66 912 this weekend
I discovered the following day that there is a slight leak
in the trans!  It figures, after its installed......

My 5 speed 901 transmission appears to be leaking right by
the "shift fork" seal.  I looked in my manuals and it appears
to me that this could be one of those seals that this weekend wrencher
could screw up, so here's my question:

1.  Is there anything special or particular in the process to
	replacing the seal around where the "shift fork" plate/seal
	is on the transmisison?

2.  Now that its back in the car, is there any reason why I cant
	do it while still in the car?

3.  Do I have to shift the car into a particular gear, neutral, ??

4.  There isnt a special tool is there? I already have a impressive
	collection of use-it-once-in-your-lifetime-special-tools!

Netter's,

I've heard that 2.2 liter T's were supposed to be able to get
20-25 mpg.

The best I've ever got is 18, usually 15-17.  It's got the original Zeniths and
they have been rebuilt recently. 

What other factors besides state of ignition parts and valve adjustment
could influence mpg this dramatically?

Subject: What to watch for in buying a used 951?


It all started in a simple quest for an early 80's 911 Targa.  I was
thinking of replacing my 71 911 with a later model.  Well the fates
have spoken and I've decided to have the fun of rebuilding the engine
along with doing the minor cosmetic work needed to bring everything up
to snuff.  This is probably a good 1-2 year project given my other
commitments and of course the thought of being porsche-less kept me
looking for a replacement.   

In the mean time an 86 951 has surfaced nearby.  All records are 
there, timing belts have been retensioned and replaced and the car
has about 60K miles.  Can't see any evidence of smoke so I'm pretty
sure the turbo is still good.  Asking price is $12K down from $13.5K.

Given I've only owned 914's and 911's I could use some wisdom on weak
areas to look for.  Having all that water running around will be a
little strange, but I could get used to it ;-)


1) What mileage points do I need to worry about? (like turbos usually
   die at 60K miles.  Heads need rebuilding every 60K, bottom end every
   100-120K.  I already know about the weak water pumps and timing
   belts)

2) Are there major structural areas subject to rot?  This is the 
   pacific NW so this usually isn't a problem, but it helps to know
   where to look.

3) Given that 86 was the first year of the 951, is it much better
   to look for a later version.  Can the major problems be taken
   care of by updates?

Thanks to all!

Subject: Re: Questions

     Regarding the door portion of your questions:

     The panel comes off easily.  Remove the obvious fasteners on
the top rail, armrest, and pocket.  There are a few nylon
faseteners to be pried loose.  They become obvious when you have
the rest out.  The only hidden screws are 1) under the little
plug in the back end of the top rail, and 2) under the plastic
cap on the door lock knob.

     Adjusting the window height limit is easy.  There is an
allen head bolt holding the stop.  It is accessable through a
hole in the inner door panel.  It lines up with this hole ONLY
when the window is in a partially raised position. Locate it by
running the window up and down while watching for an allen bolt
to line up with one of the holes.  It's about 1/3rd the way back
on the door.  Loosen the bolt and slide the stop a tad.  I forget
which way, but if you get this far, you can figure it out.

     The above takes about 30 minutes.  Good luck with the
rattle.

     Your ventilation observations coincide with my own.  I leave
the top at home.

Subject: Re: Questions

I believe you cannot adjust the gas pedal but you can adjust the brake pedal.
The adjustment is a threaded rod length under the wooden cover that
is below the pedals...it takes one nut to remove.  From there you will see the
rod go from the base of the pedal up thru the floor of the trunk to the master
cylinder assy.

I would be careful adjusting the brake pedal though.  On the race track,
even with fresh fluid and a fresh bleed, the brake pedal moves down to
an appropriate position to heel and toe.  You should probably just
brake harder!  Sure would hate to see you set the pedal down for convenient
heel and toe on the street and then not have enough pedal for a panic 
stop.

Center Vents are for AC...getting outside air into a 911 is near impossible
without opening the windows or sunroof.  With the fresh air blower turned
up enough (very noisy) you can get fresh air thru the side vents, floor vents
and defroster vents with the fresh air slider in the middle position.

Hey netters,

only body blemishes were a small dent in the rear drivers side fender

Does any one have any advice on how I can repair this.  The bar is

951 Turbos seem to last forever.  The water cooling really does the 
trick.  Heads every 60K is roughly right for cars driven hard, but 
probably premature for regular street use.  Bottom ends can get into 
trouble after an estimated 40 hours of track/race usage (the #2 bearing 
has a slight oil problem).

No, none.  The body's galvanized, so even raw metal stays intact.  This 
is a good thing, because road sand (etc.) remove the paint from the 
rocker panels and fender edges at their bottoms.

Some '87's may have oil/water intercooler problems, 86's & some 87's 
have solid exhaust manifolds that fracture.  '86's came with the 
xmission cooler standard.  87's+ have negative offset wheels, so you 
have more options with using other Porsche wheels, the front rotors 
come off much more easily, and ABS was an option.

IMHO, $12K for a $35K car as nice as a 951 is a real bargain.  Check it 
out thoroughly, of course...

Hmm, sort of a short lifetime for a clutch.  I should mention, by the way,
that spring-centred clutches will often fail with a broken spring if
abused.  Just as disabling as a blown rubber centre, perhaps statistically
more so, since the springs seem to jam more than the rubber bits.  I don't

You might want to look into whether or not a 944 turbo clutch would
fit. The clutch disk uses springs instead of a rubber center.

That reminds me of when I was having a difficult time getting smooth
clutch engagement in my 944 turbo.  The Porsche dealer in Ithaca (R Wood
Motors, who has since closed/gone out of business) was adamant that the
rubber center was breaking up and that a new clutch was needed.  I
declined and decided to investigate further.  It turned out that the car
didn't even have a rubber center clutch and that the problem was a
mis-adjusted pushrod causing the helper spring to kick in at the wrong
point in the travel.  A five minute adjustment instead of a $1500
repair... that made the factory shop manuals worth the expense.

Will,

I replaced the clutch on my '89 944 last year with a spring-centered
version.  I believe it is the part for a 924 turbo.  Some minor 
machining was required to accomodate the flywheel (shaft length 
adjustment, I think).  The advantages for this setup are much 
longer clutch life (the rubber centers seem to have a 50K mile life), 
a lighter weight flywheel and smoother shifts.  The downside is more 
money but well worth it if you plan to keep the car for at least 
another 50K miles.

 If I may add to the statistics:
 My 914 blew a rubber center clutch in downtown Portland Ore.
There was NO warning during the cruise from Wichita Ks. the day before.
I do not jackrabbit start this car, nor was it raced.

Starting from Portland;  (this done in the late 70's)
Having less than $200 and no credit cards (and no local relatives), I limped
the car back east...down I80 across the rockies on a clutch with only
an occasional chunky grab.  The first day: ~575 miles non-stop, Twin Falls
Idaho.  The second day: 550 miles non-stop to total failure in east Denver.
500 miles short of destination.

Analysis of the clutch revealed the classic destruction: the center 
rubber damper had broken into bits and the bigger chunks became the
motive elements when properly jammed in the remains of the clutch 
center basket.  62000 miles original clutch.

 Anal-clenching excitement for a lone wolf 25 year old.

Guess what type clutch I buy now...and I hope it makes LOTS of noise
before impending doom, I dont HEAR as well as I used to...

oo tank of gas, but had to put up with a heavy load early on.  Probably the main
oo reason it won was because of the brakes.  The RX-7s were doing a pad change
oo every hour.  The Porsche went through the entire race without a pad change.

oo In the 12 hour race they just got beaten by an RX-7.  I was in Europe at the
oo time so I am not so sure on the details....  Anyhow the RX-7 came first,

Hmmm, I wonder if this car will be in AS with the RX7 TT's???  If only BGF/YOKO
would mfg some race tires in 18" size... I bet if someone like Bill Buetow had a

confidence that you will be back stronger htan ever..).

Could BE VERY INTERSTING...... oh, but I'm sure SCCA would put it in
SS (so as not to 'cut participation' of the MAZDA's in AS....)

Or maybe it should go into BS so the Toy's would have some comp...

Subject: Re: spark plug removal

I once had a problem removing #1 spark plug on my 79 911. Apparently, the 
valve cover was just enough in the way to prevent any of my sockets from 
engaging the plug while being straight enough to allow an extension to 
line up. After thinking about it for a couple of days, I used the spark 
plug tool from the tool kit. It won't accept a ratchet, but it did the 
trick. Even though your 912 valve covers probably aren't getting in your 
way, the tool from the kit may get it started.

I second that opinion. I even painted my black. Those german test drivers for

with the 911 for a looooong time. 

I solved the pedal-height-for-heel-and-toe on my 911sc by attaching a

Subject: Mike's Brake Bleeder(tm)

For those of you that drive your car hard at the track as a hobby, you 
know that another hobby goes hand-in-hand: bleeding your brakes. There 
are a couple of strategies you can use for this: 1) Have the dealer do 
it (easy but gutless), 2) Get your S.O. to pump the brakes while you 
jockey the bleeder valve (requires cooperation of your S.O.), or 3) 
Waste $35 on a handheld vacuum pump before going back to options #1 or 
#2 (anyone want to buy mine...used once?). Having tried all of these, 
and considered and rejected the $250 KD brake bleeder, I made it a 
project this weekend to find A Better Way. One that would do the pedal 
pumping and fluid refilling for me. So here it is:

* Go to Home Depot and buy a Chapin #2101 (1 Gallon) Pump sprayer. 
Others will work but I liked this one because it is translucent so you 
can see how much fluid is left and has the nice brass fittings and also 
a trigger you can lock on. Cost: $25.

* Go to Porsche and get an extra brake reservoir cap ($9! tho I'm sure 
there is a VW counterpart for $3) and drill a 1/2" hole in it.

* Get a female air hose quick connect fitting with female 1/4" NPT 
threads. This you'll install on the end of the pump sprayer hose 
instead of the spray nozzle. Cost: $4.

* Get a matching male quick connect with female 1/4" NPT threads. This 
you'll install in the 1/2" hole you drill in the extra brake reservoir 
cap. To hold the fitting in the cap, get something like a 1/4" x 1/8" 
pipe bushing. When you are all done, you'll have a cap with the fitting 
sticking up out of the center. Cost $3.

* Get about three feet of clear 3/8" hose (so you can see the fluid as 
it is bled) and find an empty oil bottle or something to hold the used fluid.

After you've installed the fittings as described above (teflon tape 
helps make better seals), fill the sprayer bottle with some brake fluid 
(I like Motul) and you are ready to use. Some notes:

* You'll need to plug the brake fluid reservoir hose! A 10mm bolt works 
fine, or use some vice grips.

* Screw the new cap and fitting on your brake fluid reservoir and clip 
the hose on it. Open the trigger and give the sprayer a dozen pumps or 
so...if you have done anything wrong fluid will be leaking now, so take 
a look - the stuff will dissolve your paint.

* Bleed your brakes. I attach the 3/8 hose to the bleed valve, make 
sure the other end is in a bottle, and unscrew the valve. Viola! As you 
drain old fluid, new fluid is pumped into your reservoir. I do the 
calipers in the order: farthest from the reservoir first.

* When you are all done, depressurize the spayer bottle before 
detaching it - I unscrew the sprayer bottle top to make sure. A rag is 
cheap insurance for your paint and eyes when unclipping.

* Remove the cap with the fitting and replace with the real one - if 
you forget, closing the hood will punch it right through the cap! Don't 
ask how I know....

* Unplug the overflow hose by removing the screw or vice grips.

With this system, I can bleed my brakes in about 10 minutes longer than 
it would take me to change 4 tires.

Subject: In car video & the Datacam

A few weeks back I was watching some Firehawk coverage and noticed the 
nifty in-car video some segments had. Not unlike the high-tech Ford 
telemetry you can see in the F1 coverage, this in-car had RPM, speed, 
brakes (on or off), elapsed time, and G's right to left and front to 
back. Man, I thought that would be cool to have at the track. Lo and 
behold, the next segment was a "Track Fact" about the Datacam system, 
and how IMSA teams were able to collect data for about $2k instead of 
the 50k that IndyCar teams spend. Thanks to Compuserve, I located the 
source for the Datacam through one of the IMSA drivers and I thought 
I'd pass it along to this group. Be sure you tell Tom I sent you!

The System:
Basically, the Datacam system takes an NTSC signal from any video 
camera (like the Sony GCD1 for about $400) or CamCorder, overlays on it 
the telemetry data that you have chosen, and sends that signal out on 
another NTSC plug (RCA plug) that you plug into a portable VCR (like a 
video WalkMan) or second CamCorder for taping (you can wrap this one in 
a sweatshirt and stuff it behind the seat). Separating the camera from 
the VCR also has the benefit of *greatly* reducing the picture shake 
that most in-car tapes have, since the recording heads aren't being 
bounced around by the stiff camera mount. Oh and don't bother buying a 
TR101 - SteadyShot doesn't help.

The telemetry data that gets mixed in is up to you. The basic system, 
called the Datacam Model 200,  measures and displays brake (off/on), 
throttle (off/on), RPM, Speed, and Time accurate to .1 second. It costs 
$850 and includes a wiring harness with about 7' of wire. You connect 
the system to your car by connecting the brake indicator to your brake 
light switch, speed to your cruise control, and so on.

To collect more kinds of data, you can expand the system with the 
Datacom Model 300 expansion board which costs $400 - $2000 (typical 
$1k). This adds up to 7 ports which will accept a analog signal (G's 
temperature, anything you can transduce to a voltage). For example:

*G's: The will supply you with the same transducer the g.Analyst uses 
for $170. It's accurate to 100th of a G and up to 2.5gs.
* Throttle Position: need rheostat from 1-5v $80.
* Temp, using thermocouples (brakes, rear ends, or intercoolers, even 
IR sensors to measure tire temps.)
* Boost pressure.
* In wheel wells. display in deg F
* Suspension displacement with linear transducers.

The owner and developer is Tom Henneka of Acquisition Systems who is a 
real nice guy and spent quite a while explaining the whole system to 
me. He has been selling the Datacam for 3yrs to high-end club racers 
and med/low pro racers.

You can reach Tom at 704/525-3166...say hello for me.

For the real telemetry geeks, you might get the book Data Power, by 
Buddy Fey published by Towery Publishing (901-272-0228).

I have no affiliation with either company. I just think this stuff is cool.

I, too, would like to know if yellow was an original color.  My '73 is
a really bright yellow (not the dull yellow seen on VW corrado's).  I can
tell the car used to be white, from an area under the wiper motor.  It
would be nice to know if I can get yellow paint for small areas that will

I don't know about orange, but they definitely had this awful color that
I guess you would say is halfway between red and orange.

Subject: 912 carb balancing

Steve,
I recommend using the STE Synchrometer. PMO (310) 393-5423 usually
sells it for $35. I have ordered many Weber related parts from them and
have always been happy with their service.

Since I don't have Dellortos, I am not sure of the exact procedure but
I will give you the short version of the procedure I use.

Disconnect the linkage from each side.
Check each venturi with the synchrometer.

If one pair is not balanced with the other side, adjust using the idle screw.
If one venturi is off, adjust using the air corrector screw. 
(not the same as the mixture screw).
When your done, all four should have the same reading.

Now adjust mixture screws to adjust uneven idleing.
(usually I tighten the mixture screw until it starts to cut out that
cylynder, 
then back it out 1/4 to 1/2 turn)

Now reconnect the linkage.
Check the flow again to see that all are still balanced.
If not, adjust your linkage so that the idle stops are resting on the idle
adjustment screws.

Now have someone hold the rpm at about 3000 and check all four again.
If one side is out of balance, adjust your linkage to compensate.
(usually this is not needed unless your linkage has some slack in it)

Hope this helps.

When the clutch on my '87 951 finally failed a few months back (it made
it to 90k with 2 and a half years of hardcore track use), my mechanic
recommended using a 930 disk.  He claims that it's more rugged than even
the newer 944/951 discs (apparently the springs in the '87 951 design were
notorious for early failure -- he was suprised minehad lasted to 90k).

You might want to look into whether or not a 944 turbo clutch would
fit. The clutch disk uses springs instead of a rubber center.

The difference is that the 951 clutch has a 240 mm diameter, while the
aspiro has a 225 mm diameter.  Dunno about spline, kind of doubt they're
different.

Oh, sure.  And up north here, we see problems with the spring-centred
clutches due to road salt's chemically-induced metal fatigue of the
springs.  Or is it due to the magnetic tug we get being closer to the
North Pole?

There is certainly some risk of this, in two ways.  First, the non-OEM
parts may be designed differently.  Second, they may be of the same
design but rejected by Porsche (or whomever) for some reason or another.
There are certainly lots of perfectly fine parts in the aftermarket,
but it can be hard to tell.

I believe that Derentz claims that their parts meet all OEM spec's and
tests.  Unfortunately, they do not sell to the retail market.

You've done it now:  Brought back the R Wood name from a well-deserved grave...
Legend has it that if you spoke this name 3 times in a row (or called their
service department once), your Porsche/Audi/VW would immediately self-destruct.
They've been trying to sell the building for a couple of years now, but nobody

waiting will bring.  As I understand it, for $1000 put down now, one is given
a place in the queue for future delivery of whatever the new product will be.
I guess the $1000 deposit is refundable if the product is not forthcoming or
if the person making the deposit decides not to take delivery when it does
become available.
The questions are, what kind a product is the Boxster going to be, how much
will it likely cost, and how long will one have to wait for delivery?  So 
far, I have seen and heard more rumors than facts about the Boxster.  Anyone
have any more info?

We're having a bit of a problem with oil surge in a '92 924, that I
thought that maybe some of the porschephile gang out there may have
seen. Basicly we get no pressure on the gauge when driven fairly hard
(about 100 mph, just into a drift) in long 'S' bends . The car is has
about 60k miles on it, but has had a quite life before coming into my
associates possession about 3 weeks ago. The engine was very sweet, but
sadly now sounds like it has done a big end, but possible only a
gudgeon pin. It is going to have to come down over Xmas, and is not
being driven anymore with the hope that it will get away with just a
journal polish. Anyhow the question is this problem avoided next time
round ? The temptation is to baffle the sump, but I know this can cause
more problems than it solves if done wrongly.

On TV the other night I saw an article on armoring vehicles.
There was a business that undertook the work reconstructing
the cockpit with bullet proof glass and sheets of "spectra 
shield" (sp?) in the doors, pillars, etc...

Anyone know a vendor for Spectra Shield bullet stop material?
Got any specs?
OR- got a better idea?

I was gonna side-impact (bullet) reinforce my daily beater anyway, but
the spectra might do better than 12 guage (sheet steel).

I am also looking for more information regarding the new porsche.From Road
and Track magazine, this car comes with a 4 cylinder or an optional 6 cylinder
water cooled engine. That is all I have.

Also, the production car will not be the same as the prototype.Maybe that is
why the car can be brought at < 40K.

Take away the lime green from a '71 "S" and you've stripped it of it's

their color for a generic black hurse shade, am I right?

Yeah, tell me about it.  My '73 911 is purple underneath the black.  I'm
thinking about stripping it down to metal and repainting it BRG with
acrylic urethane and a clearcoat.  It'll go nicely with the tan (used to
be brown before 20 years of UV) interior.

Has anyone ever put on a new doorskin?  Does it fit worth a damn?  I foresee
having to grind down the spot welds on the original doorskin, pry it off the
door frame, drill holes around the perimeter of the new doorskin, fit it in
to place, and mig weld on the spots where I drilled.  Any comments?

12 gauge will not stop HEAT or APFSDS armor piercing rounds. You're
only protecting yourself from small arms fire <7.62mm. You want either
Chobham armor or some sort of reative armor as per latest US Army

I must disagree!  These colors showed a little creativity.  Latest
Porsche colors are utterly boorrringg.  At least in those days there

   Date:	Wed, 27 Oct 1993 09:05:57 -0700
   From:	"James L. Fry" <JFRY@uoft02.utoledo.edu>

   A friend of mine has the opportunity to get on the "waiting list" for future
   delivery of the anticipated Porsche Boxster, but has questions about what the
   waiting will bring. As I understand it, for $1000 put down now, one is given
   a place in the queue for future delivery of whatever the new product will be.
   I guess the $1000 deposit is refundable if the product is not forthcoming or
   if the person making the deposit decides not to take delivery when it does
   become available.

I don't know anything about this, or much about the Boxster except
what I read in the papers.  However, I wouldn't count on the fact that
you can get your $1,000 back if you don't want the car when its
available.  Of course, if the car looks good and is popular you
probably won't have a problem; either Porsche will be happy to let you
off the hook and sell yours to the next guy in line, or you can sell
your place in line to someone else.

On the other hand, I vaguely remember reading a story about people
getting screwed who had purchased rights to Jaguar XJ-220's (I think)
and then didn't want the cars.  Now this situation was quite different
than a $1K holding deposit; I think that these guys had been
speculating in the "advanced reservations" when the car was hot, and
the tickets themselves were much more like a purchase than a deposit,
but still...  Does anyone else know the real story about this?

Anyway, the moral is to make sure you understand what it says IN
WRITING about your cancellation options.

        Reply to:   RE>Boxster Questions
There's been a lot in the press about the Boxster: Autoweek, R&T, and
Panorama all carried articles.  Many more publications too, I'll bet.  Lots of
speculation continues.  Porsche seems committed to staying around $40k, it
is definitely a mid engine configuration, and although I read about a water-
cooled 4 or 6 cyl version a salesman I know well insists that Porsche has
decided to use a 6 cyc air-cooled version.  Maybe that's just wishful thinking.
Has anyone else heard this?

Porsche understands that this car could save the company and it is going as
fast as it can.  Still, count on a long and painful wait.  I wouldn't mind
queuing
up with a $1k deposit if it is easily refundable.  Is this a certainty or does
it
vary from dealer to dealer?
Lance.

very 70s and very good colour for this particular beast IMHO.

subject:  914 paint codes

Greetings,
Since there have been requests for the 914 paint codes and no response,
I will provide them here.  These codes are from the factory 914 manual
book 8 body, page 22.1-1/1 USA/CAN  XII, 1973.  I am not clear if these
codes apply directly to all year models other than '73.  The nomenclature
plate containing the code is located in the left-side door jamb.
All 914's were painted by Karmann of Osnabrueck, Germany using synthetic
enamel.

These paints and tints are now manufactured by Glasurit, a BASF concern.
Beginning with 1973, front and rear panels and outer covers of the rocker
panels are painted a dull black Rinshed - Mason 681 black or equivalent.
Today the accepted equivalent is Masury 'satin black' enamel p/n 3863-6 (qt.).
Enjoy.

I never hope to see a tangerine the color of 914 "Tangerine" but I liked it
a lot on my 72.  Pretty good at obscuring rust spots while the paint job
money (for fresh Tangerine!) was accruing, too.

Subject: Brake Bleeding


Let me recommend, not for the first time on this list, the "EZ Bleed"
system.  You hook it to a spare tire w/ less than 20psi in it and it
pressurizes the hydraulic system pushing out old fluid.  I can bleed
my brakes in under 15mins not counting tire removal (which is a
standard for brake bleeding) using this system.

Users of EZ bleed should be sure to keep the particle screen in the
brake reservoir so that any particles that might be in the spare tire
don't get into your brake system, also keep the tire standing up with
the intake nozzle at the top so any condensation from the change in
pressure inside the tire doesn't go into your brake fluid.

You can also use the EZ bleed with an air compressor that has filtered
air lines.

EZBleed is sold for around $30 by someone who advertizes in Pano

this thick 1/2" steel sheet over a huge Greyhound bus and basically turned it 
into a tank. Maybe you could try the same trick. Check it out. The movie is I 
believe The Gaunlet. It's out on video I am sure. 

Or, check out what he did in the movie "A Fistful of Dollars" I think. This is 
where he wore a piece of, again, 1/2" steel over his heart and let the bad guy 
shoot him in the heart six times before he nailed the bad guy with one well 
placed shot. 

Last time I heard, Clint lives in Carmel. Maybe you should call Carmel and ask 
to speak to the old Mayor. The famous one. 

Good luck.

I read that many depositors wanted their money back was because the
V12 they thought they were buying turned into a turbo 6.  The factory
was adamant about not refunding deposits because the design was never
set in stone.  I think the matter has gone to court in at least one case
(or was it a class action?).  Of course the depostis were in the $50k
range, and the sales price was over $200k...

Not even.  7.62mm goes thru mild steel 10gage at 800m, as does 5.56mm NATO.  
Commercial claims of "Bulletproof" usually mean something closer to
"Resists low performance pistol calibers".  Test before you bother installing,
especially when it comes to Kevlar.

I guess that the people who put 50000 GBP "deposits" on the Jag XJ220
wish that they had given a refundable deposit rather than purchasing
an option. Sadly, when you buy an option (could be anthing from boxsters
to pork bellys) if you don't exercise the option nothing happens.
Except the person who sold you the option gets to keep the money.
 
Caveat emptor is the rule in any
exchange like this. Many of the XJ220 option purchasers are involved in
a court battle with Jaguar who refuse to refund them the money
they put up front and now want back due to the crash in the
market for "supercars" ruining their speculative ventures. I think that
its rather amusing to see lots of very rich speculators (ie
not real sports car enthusiasts) get burned but your mileage may vary.

I absolutely agree.  I wouldn't want a 968 in conda green, but the 914
2.0 I saw last week at Lime Rock in this colour was gorgeous.  I get
really tired of the parade of red, white, and black cars, zzzzzz.  A
tangerine 914 is a classic.

I remember seeing a few years ago footage of the original IROC series.
The cars were all 911RS in their "easter egg" colours of the time.  What
a sight!

The most hideous thing I've seen in a while was an early 70's 911 targa,
repainted in a 1993-ish blue/green metallic.  Beautiful paint job, nice
cars, but wrong wrong wrong.

Subject: 944 Clutch Bleeding


Here's a hot tech tip for all you water-cooled types trying to save a few
bucks for those unexpected vicissitudes of 944 ownership...

Having decided to bleed the clutch line while doing the brakes I discovered
an interesting design feature.  The brake fluid reservoir is subdivided into
three compartments serving the front and rear brake circuits and the clutch
line.  These compartments communicate through circuitous paths connecting
at the tops of the partitions - presumably to prevent a single leak from 
draining the remaining circuits.  The clutch chamber is the smallest one and
is completely drained by a couple of strokes of the clutch.  This means
crawling out from under the car numerous times during the procedure to
refill the reservoir.

In desperation, I cut the bottom off a plastic Castrol (1 qt) fluid bottle
and stuck it into the fluid reservoir.  A few wraps of tape (I used Teflon)
on the shoulder just below the threads on the bottle before insertion and 
the thing pops in making a nice seal.  A strip of duct tape on either side 
of this funnel to the reservoir for safety and you have a very nice, 
enlarged reservoir.  The entire job of bleeding the brakes and clutch can 
be done with a single filling.

Happy bleeding,
John

On old 911 colors...my 69 S has a VERY nice tangerine paint job.
Although it might not look as nice on other cars, I wouldnt trade it.

I agree that there are too many black, red and white porsches.  My
SC was painted prussian blue (metallic)...another color I rarely

Subject: Afternoon hack (911 heater box cables)

  Just thought I would relate my latest hack to you all.  You know the
cable guides that the early 911 heater box cables run though from the firewall
to the flapper boxes?  ...The ones that are shattered on the flapper box
end so that when you pull on the heater control lever, it just draws up the
slack in the cable and doesn't do much of anything.  Or better yet you've
shortened the adjustment on the cable, but the range isn't the same as it
was originally and you have one side on the car with the heat permanently
half way on.

  Well, instead of spending $13 a pop for these cable guides (which I have only
been able to find from Stoddard's), you can spend $3.50 at Western Auto for
a lawn mower throttle control and cable.  You'll get snide comments from
your spouse but the price is right.  Anyways, you can cut the metal lawn mower
cable guide to the appropriate length, transplant the end caps from the
original Porsche cable guides (some drilling out of the caps required), and
replace the original guides.  It's actually pretty easy to access if you
take the rear wheels off the car.

No sense letting the heat from those SSI heat exchangers go to waste...

 My friends at the P-philes group;
 Guess I ripped the lid off another can of worms...

I will say that I used a poor choice of words, and I wish it was a joke
 -but it's not.  Sorry if this unsettles some of y'all.
This started out as more query than "i'm gonna do this next".

Bullet resistant would be more correct.

Maybe you've seen on your local news -carjackings.
I'm not paranoid, nor has this happened to me.  The tv article that
started me thinking about all this quoted a statistic of (I think) 60000
carjackings in 1992.  They also mentioned that automaker's would begin
offering bullet RESISTANT options for some models soon.
To me that says: a market exists and the problem is real.

The business being interviewed (I didnt catch the name) had a warehouse
where a variety of vehicles were in various levels of retrofit.
The price quotes were enormous, on the order of equivalence to MSRP of
the vehicle!  Thick windshields and side glass costing in the tens of 
thousands, and sheets of this 'spectra shield' as the spokesman called it.
Those sheets were placed within the doors, pillars, and firewalls.
And there were plastic inserts inside the tires for driving on flats
'conte' I just read...(thanks).

It would be a damn shame to put this junk in a Porsche  -even if it was
for peace of mind, a rediculous idea.  Just what the world needs: an
armored barcalounger -with a jet pack =>.

So far no one has come forward with a source for the spectra shield and
even if I had some in my car, i couldnt do the armored glass thing so
vulnerability would still be the rule.  On the other hand, the Porsche
skins are made of pretty thin steel (between 1 and 2 millimeter) and could
easily be penetrated by a .22.  Standing behind the door (like the cops
do on tv) of a P-car during an exchange would not ensure protection.
This has got to be true of most vehicles on the road today.

Of the many scenarios, perhaps the best protection would be that provided
by your right foot -pressed heartily to the floorboards.  Err, Duck -n- Flog.
And if shooting starts -hope they's a bad shot.  Jeepers, at the price you
could just keep a handy wad of cash (one's only) to toss out as bait whilst
you motor away  -here rupiea! (well, it worked for james bond)

Well crum.  Just when you think that all you have to worry about when deciding
to drive the flivver or give it the day off is: rain or snow? (what verdict..)

My wife's 911 recently needed some front end body work.  I called several
independent Porsche shops I knew in Silicon Valley and got the same referral:
BodyStyle on Brokaw St in San Jose.  The owner, Cecil Beach, has been doing
body work on Porsches for more than 20 years and did a superb job on her 89
(and it had the 25th anniv black metallic paint that I figured would be a real
challenge to match).

I highly recommend them.  They also dealt very effectively with the insurance
company over some prior damage not repaired properly.  And it didn't cost us
a nickle to get it back in better shape than before it was hit (the 2nd time).

Subject: Re: Bullet resistant vehicles

Kyle's note on the perils of carjacking is timely and well-taken.
I personally have had two unsuccessful attempts to relieve me of
my car made in the last half year. My across the street neighbor
was much less lucky -- he was relieved of his Jag, Rolex and wallet
*in his driveway* one evening, after a night on the town.

According to local police, the guys I had a problem with are from a gang 
with a simple MO: pull up behind a target with at least three guys in a car, 
have two guys run up to the target (one per side of the car) with drawn guns, 
take the car plus whatever else they can. They count on you being not 
real alert (only do it late at night); they count on you sitting still for
the stop light you're at; they count on you not resisting.

In both of my cases, smart driving paid off. I was alert for the fact
that a car full of unlikely looking people had just pulled up behind
me in traffic, at a deserted stop light late at night.  So, when doors
opened, and these guys come trotting up towards me, I just took off.
Ran the red light, turned through cross-traffic, the whole bit. 

The first time, they just stood there and let me go. A few weeks later,
a different bunch tried the same thing, same result. Except they chased
me. Apparrently this did *NOT* amuse them -- their "leader" lost face
from a target getting away or something. OK, fine. You *CAN* chase a
competition driver in a prepared Porsche 911 with a Chevy Nova, I guess.
Just not very successfully. Particularly when driver in question is
willing to duck into the police underground garage as part of the chase...

Moral: to a lot of people out there, these look like *EXPENSIVE* cars. 
They may want yours. Be alert. Don't stop to help anyone, period.  Don't 
be taken in by "bump" robbers who will tap your rear bumper at a light
and expect you to get out of your car all upset and hence be easily taken. 
Know where the police and fire stations in all areas you drive with some 
frequency are -- nothing gets attention faster than parking cross-wise in a 
fire station driveway and laying on the horn -- firemen get *REAL* excited
about the prospect of *ANYTHING* blocking their driveways... And think
*REAL HARD* about having a cellular phone on hand at all times, too -- mine
is a hand-held that I can slip into my pocket, so that I have it even
when I'm not in the car.

At night, I won't drive my Porsches into "known bad" areas. Most of the
time anyway. If I have to, I may carry a very large caliber pistol with
which I'm slightly more proficient than I am with a car. Or I may not.
Think you're lucky, punk?

Hey Porsche "drinkers,"
   Do any of you know whether propylene glycol is okay as a

made out of.
   There is a a propylene glycol coolant out on the market now
under the name "Sierra" which claims to be far less toxic than
ethylene glycol.  More importantly for Porsche owners, it is
phosphate free and only $5 a gallon.  The alternative for me right
now is ethylene glycol Zerex 4/40 phosphate free coolant which
claims to have longer lasting additives (4 years/40,000 miles) at
$10 a gallon.
     Thanks, Jeff
PS: Could adding too much coolant (without bleeding after partial
draining) cause surges at low RPMs?

Subject: new 911's

Yesterday I had the chance to attend the London Motor Show at Earl's
Court.  Porsche had quite a large display relative to the number of cars
they produce and had an impressive lineup including a 968, 968cs, 968
cabriolet, 928GTS and several new 911's.  I was able to use my PCA
membership card to get into the inner display and was able to crawl
around inside a new 911. From the outside it's (obviously) recognizable
as a 911 but the front fenders have been softened and the headlights
slope back a fair bit more. The roof line seems to have remained the
same, the engine lid appears quite a bit longer and the rear fender
flares now start much earlier so they blend in better and don't appear as
much of an add-on as before. The car appears as though it's wider in the
rear and my first thought was that it has 'big hips'.  Don't
misunderstand me; it's a very pleasing effect and the car really looks
super.  The interior is very similar to a Carrera 2/4.  Some of the
switch gear has been placed a little more intelligently and there are no
longer three different ways to lock the doors.  The dashboard remains
very similar.  The steering wheel now has an airbag that isn't as
obstructive and it blends in better.  The dealers should have
demonstrator about December 10th and then cars to sell in late December
or early January.  Base price in the UK is 54K GBP or about 81K USD.
From all I read and saw, it looks like the targa is no more; only a coupe
and cabrio will be available.

Stan's comments should be well taken, in addition-
always leave yourself enough room from the car in from to change lanes and 
exit fast,   multi lanes (except for medians,... should have taken your 4x4) 
I like to stay in the inside so you can't be pinned against parked cars.

And like Stan said DON'T wait until they are knocking at your window to 
react, screw the traffic regs you violate.

See autocrossing is good for you!  (Tony can use that in the next ad)

And for the stupid a**hole who wants to put his body in front of my (as you 
all put it) overweight 928, .... well I hope bug and tar remover also 
removes slim.

And like Stan, yes thank God I live in Texas.

Subject: New IMSA RSR Race Team for 1994


I am proud to announce that Roger Morse Racing of East Greenbush, NY,
will be running three 3.8 RSRs in the 1994 IMSA GT Series.  The prime
sponsor will be Toyo tires, and to date Joe Danaher (IMSA Firehawk
point leader) and John Paul Jr. have agreed to be drivers.  Driving
teams for Daytona and Sebring as well as the third principle driver
are still being finalized.

Reports from Europe suggest the RSR will blow away anything that's
currenty slated for the GT class.  

Joe Danaher, whose Mazda RX7 TT has dominated the Firehawk series
(ending the reign of the 944S2), hates the RX7.  The car requires far
too much maintenance and there are always problems - it is not shipped
from the factory "ready to race" (from a mechanical perspective) as
all 911s really are.  Joe is a PCA member and is very excited about
getting back to driving Porsches, and is looking forward to far fewer
headaches. 

It should be an exciting season.

Subject: 911 Performance Summary


Let me say a few words about the Bosch MFI.

One the good side, there has never been and currently still is not a
better performing fuel delivery system.  I have driven many different
kinds of FI and the throttle response of the MFI is incredible.  It
almost accelerates before you press the throttle.  The injector
pressure in this system was 90 PSI (if I remember correclty), which is
the highest of any system and results in excellent atomization and a
very efficient burn.  Every driver I have spoken to that has driven a
car with the MFI says the same thing.  

The Caveat Emptor for this system is tuning.  The above paragraph is
only true if the system is properly tuned.  The main problem with
tuning the system is that it can only be done under load.  The factory
manual lists a procedure where you hook up a CO meter to the muffler
and tape it to the side of the car so you can take readings at
somethign liek 3kRPM under acceleration and cruising.  Then you stop
and make adjustments, get back in and try again.  The adjustment
screws also interact with each other, so finding the correct setting
is very hard.  Another tuning difficulty is that there is a barrage of
linkages which all must be set EXACTLY.  When the system is out of
tune it is often difficult to determine where the problem lies.

This was the downfall of the system - the complexity of the tuning
process compared to Kjet made many believe it was not worth the
trouble on a production car.  Porsche continued using the MFI (and
technically, the Kjet is also an MFI, but you know what I mean) in its
racing cars long after it disappeared from production cars.

Those of us who love the MFI think its well worth the time it takes to
meticulously tune it properly.  But we are certainly a vanishing
breed.  The Motronic is pretty damn good considering you just hook it
up and it works....

Alex, interesting.
What are you using for the overhead member?  Winch, huh hmmm
I use an Excell 2.5 ton shop crane (available at Sam's $250)
and a jig to lift the body.  But this body is totally stripped
and weighs less than 600 pounds (914) and also has the spot-weld
access ports removed.  I lift from the center of the bod, thru the
ports and the rotisserie/car assembly -a one-man affair, I then set 
it on a LIGHT utility trailer (750 Lb. limit) for one-man mobility.
This whole rig: $500.  Useability: Excellent.  American made.

Problems:
The crane is a roll around floor type, so getting it under the trailer in
tight quarters is challenging.
Unbalancing is always a hazard.
Storage of unused crane (some are portable/stowable and heavy).
Special jig required to lift complete car. (you need this anyway)

As for purchase of the hoist (if that's what you decide) go for the heavier
duty, the unit will be more robust and useful for any task.  Weight limits
can be a scare when doing unexpected jobs.

      Not even.  7.62mm goes thru mild steel 10gage at 800m, as does
      5.56mm NATO.  Commercial claims of "Bulletproof" usually mean
      something closer to "Resists low performance pistol calibers".  Test
      before you bother installing, especially when it comes to Kevlar.

I'm looking to install half-tracks on my 911 targa, and a bradley-type
25mm chain-gun.  I've seen the kit for the machine gun (which requires
no drilling, *whew*), but I can't find it.  Has anyone else seen it?
Also, the half-tracks were advertised in Mercenary last month, but I
threw out that issue and it's not in this month - did anyone else see
it?  The nice thing about the kit I saw was it fit under the stock
fenders (another *whew*).

Just as I was getting real tired of hearing about bullet-proofing cars
today's San Jose Mercury News carried a story on an Ohio company that
offers a "Personal Security Vehicle" to cope with car jackings and armed
robberies.  O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhart Armoring Co in Fairfield uses
lightweight composite armor around the passanger compartment and
plastic-reinforced glass windows.  Supposedly the armor will stop
bullets from .38-caliber and 9mm pistols and from machine pistols
(the avg guns street criminals use).

The basic pkg costs about $45k, with options for tires that work in spite
of bullet riddling, an explosion-proof gas tank, a dual battery system, and
tamper-proof doors, all for another $25k.

The armor adds only 227 lbs to the car.  It does not include roof or
floorpan armoring.

For about $3.5k the company will supply reinforced side-window glass;
installation is extra.  This is supposed to stop smash-and-grab robberies
by making it difficult to break through windows quickly.  Dunno if this is
also bullet-proof.

  I was the one that wrote about this and I, too, am having difficulty
finding *any* other info about the show. Again, my information was
based on a flyer included with the Monterey Historic Auto Races program 
that indicated a Nov 4th air date on Prime Ticket/the Prime Network. Prime
Ticket is one of the "premium" channels in Southern CA that covers the Los 
Angeles Lakers and Kings games, Great Western Forum boxing, and a number 
of local college sporting events; I'm in the process of contacting my L.A.
friends to track this for me. Does anyone else have any news about this?

Subject: CRX vs 911 again


Well, can't leave an old thread alone-  Lone CRX beater of 911's

Seems like if took the wind out of everyones fingers

There was so much stir about a lowly CRX which supposedly blew away a 911
that I decided to state some facts about our LSR Autocross series results 
from 7/18/93 printed in the Porschenaut September 1993.  (items reprinted 
with permission)

Class                          (sec)

X-2    90 Honda CRX Si         81.388

P2     74 Porsche 914-4        81.603

P4     86 Porsche 944          81.407

P7     83 Porsche 911 SC       86.924

P8     84 Porsche 911          77.145
P8     93 Porsche 911 RS Am    85.255
P8     84 Porsche 911          89.377

Partial listing of 1st place in the first 4 and all of P8.
Names were omitted for obvious reasons (members of Porschephiles)

Let's put it in prespective, majority of it is the driver, how hard they
want to push it and let it hang out.

I'll tag the best comment as- let someone else screem in front to find the
oncoming passing cars, gravel, road obstructions and the police.

I don't agree with street racing,  I still wouldn't put that much money on
the line just to dust a Honda.  You are still the one driving the Porsche.

Subject: Cruise Control Revisited ( or tracking down electrical gremlims...)

Dear Porsche friends:
	I thought I pass along some information regarding electrical connectors.

A few weeks ago I posted a request for help on fixing my cruise control. 
The symptoms were as follow, the speed would slowly drop from a set speed.
I received some help from the net, and finally I  got some time to do some
de-bugging. 

I was interested in getting to the guts of the CPU that controls the cruise.
Once located, I proceded to open it up. I was tring to see if there was any type
of adjustments (pots) that could be tweeked. I had a Volvo omce that had such
adjustments on it. I was trying to compensate for what I thought could be 
component aging. To my surprise, there was no way to adjust the CPU.

What I did find out was some corrosion in the actual connector between the
harness and the CPU. I proceded to use a laboratory grade degreaser/cleaner and
a tooh brush. I'm sure that contact cleaner from Radio Shack ( are they still
selling this stuff? All tuners have gone digital!) will do.

Now the cruise seems to hold a steady speed. So I figure I pass this info along
to you. I have been reading that some of you are having weird FI problems.

Perhaphs its time to check your terminals and connectors...

Hope this helps some of you

In a way, yes; but "bloodorange" is a fruit -- it's a reddish-orange
version of the standard orange.  So a "tangerine" isn't a bad trans-
lation, even though tangerines are somewhat yellower...

I do like the original lime greens and tangerines on early '70s Porsches.
However, I have to admit that my 914 is no longer quite the original
colour; the factory Light Ivory paint just wasn't very sharp-looking, so
the new coat of paint is the more recent (and appealing) Alpine White.

Subject: 944 Clutch - the verdict?

Hello

Seems like the thread on the 944 clutches has died down.  I was never able
to determine which was better; spring centered or rubber centered?
It seems that the spring centered is better for higher hp.  I've noticed
that Automotion's advice is to use the spring centered from the early 3.0
930's for late model 930's rubber ctr upon clutch replacement. The 951
uses a spring vs the 944/924S use a rubber center vs the 931/924 use a
spring.  What gives! Are the spring centers more tolerant of abuse while
the rubber ctr prevents the rest of the drive train from succumbing to
the abuse!? Why has Porsche used and continues to use rubber ctrs?

Some people on this list have suggested that a 931 spring center will work
in a 924S/944 and a 930 spring ctr disk will work in a 951.  Are these
desirable "upgrades" come clutch time or only advised for track use?
Do both of these bolt straight in or are other mods needed?

Thanks in advance!

The sump cover with no drain plug is used with the '84 and later Carrera
oil pump.  If you have this pump, you'll see that an earlier sump cover
(with a drain plug) cannot be substituted because there is no room for the
plug.  If you don't have a Carrera oil pump, then you should be able to
replace the cover plate with an earlier one.

We installed the Carrera oil pump in my 914-6 race car, and had to install
the matching sump cover plate.  I agree it will be a mess to change the
oil.  Did '84 Carrera's have a drain plug in the side of the case?  Maybe
we could install one!

Subject: Daddy, tell me another Porsche story

Sunday Morning about 2:30 AM I'm sound asleep in our quiet
little neighborhood and I hear a loud *KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
at the front door.  I put on the bathrobe and go out to
answer it and there's a SJPD officer standing there.  He
said, "Is that your car out in front of your house?"  I
look out the door and there to my surprise is my lovely
blood-orange 912 sitting on top of those good sturdy 
City of San Jose recycling bins with all of the wheels gone.

Luckily a neighbor who had come home from work at that hour
had seen two guys hanging around my car and had called 911.
The police zipped right over and caught one guy running down
a nearby street and held him for questioning.  Then I was
asked *who* would steal those definitely-Porsche "cookie-cutter"?
mags and I explained that a lot of guys who soup-up VW bugs
like to put them on their cars.

The police did a check of the cars around the neighborhood and
found one that 'didn't fit', whatever that means in police
terms.  It was a VW 'in progress' with a chromed engine,
but with basic original wheels/tires.  They looked through the
car and found 19 of the 20 lugnuts off my car and then searched
the bushes around the car and found my wheels.

I suppose the guys who tried this won't touch my car again as one
is on the lam and the other in the can, but now I am considering
locking up those wheels so those babies don't try and walk away
again.

So I went down to Automotion and they were showing me this two-
piece locking lugnut where the first piece is a metal ring screwed
down onto the stud with a uniquely pinned adapter and torqued to 50
ft-lb.  The adapter/key is then removed and a nut is placed over the
metal ring and also torqued down onto the stud at 50 ft-lb.

When they're on you can't tell them from the stock lugs without
real close inspection.

Just wanted to check if anyone out there has used this style of
locking lugnut and if they're happy with them.

BTW, now I park the zippy car in the garage.

Well, the best laid plans...

After having acquired what I had believed to be all the
necessary stuff to go time-trialing at Willow Springs
this weekend, the people at POC (Porsche Owner's Club)
called to remind me that 1st timers at Willow need to 

be rigged with 5 or 6-point harnesses for BOTH seats so
the chief instructor can go out with you for a spin (or
rather, ride) to introduce the novice to the race lines.  

Well...  

I have the 5-point harness uppers attached via the upper 

strap attach bracket built into the roll bar and am able 

to use it with the stock seats.
There are, however, no such provisions for harness attachment
of the upper straps on the passenger side.  Needless to say... 

no harness, no go :-(.  


Any ideas?  


I could purchase another harness setup and attach the uppers around 

the upper bar tube, but I don't know if this would be acceptable or 

not.

Seats:
I'm considering replacing the factory seat(s) with an aftermarket
sport version with provision for an anti-sub strap.  The Recaros
that come on the Cup cars seem to go for around $1K (Yow!).  I've
seen ads for Corbeau and Cobra, but have never seen them in a 911.
Any feedback here would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: 944 Clutch


OK Paul, here's some more rubber hub discussion.

From various discussions I have had it seems that the rubber-centered
clutch is supposed to be smoother and quieter.  However, heat eventually
cooks the rubber and it becomes hard and brittle.  As pieces fly off the 
system becomes unbalanced.  This is usually noticable at a particular 
engine speed (mine was ~3000 RPM ('89 944).  The consensus is that the 
rubber hubs seldom last more than 50,000 miles.  On inspection, the 
clutch disk itself still had 3/4 of the original material left.  I 
replaced the clutch with a spring-centered version.  It was the part 
for a 924 turbo.  Some minor machining was required to accomodate the 
flywheel (shaft length adjustment, I think).  I have been very happy 
with the replacement.  So far I have not noticed any difference with 
regard to noise or smoothness in both track and street conditions.  In 
fact, the new setup seems to shift more smoothly than the original 
(lighter flywheel?).

John

Speaking of official colors, I don't know mine because the vehical ID

the other numbers match so I wasn't too concerned about this one being
missing.)

This plate is supposed to have the paint and interior codes etc. I

Lord, stay away from these!  I bought a set and a wheel specialty
shop must have over torqued them on installation.  When I returned
to have my wheels rebalanced too much effort was required to get
them off and one lock broke (the pins that fit into the drilled holes
broke off, leaving the wheel permanently locked on!).  We had to jack
hammer them off, messing up the Fuchs pretty badly and scoring the
lug threads.

The best wheel locks I have found are "HRS".  Each lock is a lug nut
with a unique shape (for the set of four).  The key is a lug adapter
(female) that slips snugly over the unique male end, allowing
removal with standard lug wrenches.  They're steel (I think) and
come only in black.  The only complaint I have is that if polished
they don't look quite as good as the polished Fuchs (they seem to
tarnish a little).  But left black they look terrific (unnoticeable).

I was told that Porsche had bought the company or cut some sort of
deal with the manufacturer and that they were going to be using them
on new cars.  But I see the newest 911s on the lot still have those
dopey key operated ones that are so easy to defeat.  Maybe the deal
fell through or maybe it was just rumor? 

If anyone is interested I'll look up the manufacturer's address and
post it.

Subject: RE: Time trials and Sport seats...


I have a few suggestions about the seatbelts...

First you can attach the sholder harness straps to the mounting points for 
the rear lapbelts, while not ideal, this should be a great enough angle to 
the seat back to not cause spinal compression in a rollover type accident. 
(I've done this in my Integra for a few track events and it works great!) 
Otherwise you could put a bolt through the engine firewall to bolt the 
sholder straps through, I've also seen this done, but it may be difficult to 
do without removing the engine!

At all cost don't bolt the shoulder straps to the floor!!!!! This is bad the 
general rule of thumb is that the belts should make a > 90 degree angle with 
your back measured from your back counter-clock wise to the belt.

As far as the seats go, you can get Recaro SPG which look like the carerra 
cup, but they're fibreglass, instead of kevlar. They go for about $800-$900 
for the seat, bracket and sliders. Nice seat, feels great when you drive the 
car.

I had a cobra Silverstone that I was going to put in the porsche and decided 
the fit was too tight for it to be comfortable for any more than fairly 
brief drives, so it went into the Rally car for a navigators seat (it really 
holds you in!!!) I put the Recaro SPG in after sitting in one in a friends 
car and decideing it was definitely the most comfortable seat around!! I 
definitely think these are worth the money. If you can find anyone who has 
the seat you want so you can sit in it, that's probably the best policy, 
after all people are all sorts of different shapes/sizes and you may not fit 
in the seat others really like.
