Subject: 914 randomness...

    It's about that time of year again, as I still have no job it looks
like I'll be leaving Pittsburgh, at least for a while (I'll miss you
guys!) but on the bright side I'll get to spend a little quality time
with my beastie.  Where to begin...
    First of all, I need new fuel lines.  After I replaced one of the
hard plastic lines, the old rubber ones started leaking like crazy
around the fuel pump area (no big surprise to me, I was planning on
replacing them eventually anyway.  Eventually, I have found, often comes
sooner than one expects.)  Any recommends as to where to get a good
price on the braided rubber lines?
    Still need to finish the brakes, I am missing the one front hard
line, still, and am mulling over whether to buy tools or just get the
part from Stoddard.  If anyone has a cheap set of benders/flarers or can
point me to some, that would definitely influence that decision.
    The last time I was home, I was poking around the engine area, in
preparation to undo the whole exhaust system and put it back together
again, hopefully this time sans leaks.  To my dismay, I saw that one of
the tailpipe thingys had some loose from the left side muffler on my
Monza system and was just being held on by the bracket.  i have a nasty
feeling that would not pass inspection. I knew the system was shot (as
evidenced by the "sporty" tone) but like I said, eventually....  So I
need recommends on a new system.  I'm tempted to stick with the Monza as
it seems to be the closest to a true equal-length dual system (with
crossover, natch) of any I have seen... but I have also heard P-philes
speak highly of Bursch exhausts, and was wondering if there was any real
advantage for the extra money.  I have also seen a system called the
Sebring advertised very cheaply, it seems to be similar to a Bursch only
with a replaceable turbo-type muffler (for you non-american car guys,
that's a basic old baffled muffler, designed for low backpressure,
introduced on the Corvair turbo, hence the name...) which seems tempting
but I haven't heard anything at all about it.  Thoughts?
    Also, my dashboard seems to be non-fuctional... all the light
switches and gauges work OK, including the backlighting, but my heater
blower doesn't work, and neither do the backlights for the heater
control thingy.  Any ideas why?  Is there a harness connector that could
have come loose?  I took the ashtray out and sprayed some tuner cleaner
followed by WD-40 on the blower switch part, but that still doesn't
work, nor does it explain the nonfunctional lighting.  hmmm.....
    Other than that, things are going pretty smoothly... it needs a lot
of work, but nothing I can't handle (now affording it, that's something
else...)  but any advice on the above is greatly appreciated.

happy speeding,

Nate

Subject: Safety Devices...

Okay, well, I figured, y'know, we're talking about all these daytime 
running lights and such... what I figure is:
Daytime running lights... great things, if you live in northern Canada, 
or Sweden where it is dark for 6 months... otherwise, how about not 
painting your car beige, or purple-brown? What about red, and bright 
blue, and yellow cars? Those would catch your eyes... but either way, the 
gov't proably won't tell us what color of car we can have (although don't 
doubt for a second they won't consider it)
Airbags... hm... can we have an on/off switch, for those of us who would 
rather not bump the car next to us and spend $700?
Third brake lights... while they do absolutely no good (because you 
should not be so close at any speed that you can't see the regular ones) 
they are neat, in the fact that it gives the designers something to work 
into the design (note how the 993 has it accomodated into the pop-out 
wing now, vs. the old box out of the deck.)

More as I think of it... you should all look at the cartoon from 2 months 
ago in Automobile (the government safety car)

From: Jeffrey Puzas <jpuzas@astro.ge.com>
Subject: Limited Slip Differentials

A limited slip differential couples the driving wheels by controlling the 
relative angular velocity between the drive wheels, i.e., one wheel spinning
causes the other to spin also.  It does this by utilizing fluid shear 
properties.  If you took two flat plates and put oil between them, they would
be separated by the thickness of the film and not touching.  Rotating one
plate would cause the other plate to turn in the same direction at a lower
angular velocity.  The higher the relative angular velocity between the two
plates the more power that can be transmitted from one plate to the other.
This can be controlled by the viscosity of the fluid, which in the case of 
the differential is the transaxel fluid.  Although I've never actually
disassembled a L.S. Diff.,  I believe there are several plates that couple
the drive wheels.  This system allows the wheels to rotate independently
when turning, but when one wheel is spinning, i.e., high relative angular
velocity, power is applied to both wheels.

In a normal diff.  if one wheel is on ice and the other has traction, the car 
will not move because the diff. applies the same torque to both drive wheels.
If the coefficient of friction on one wheel is low - too low to move the car -
the force required to move the car will never be developed because the spinning
wheel limits the torque that can be applied to the wheel that has traction.  A
limited slip will apply torque to the wheel with traction through the plates
and oil that couple the two drive wheels.  

The advantage in racing is in hard cornering when the inside wheel is lightly
loaded the application of power would cause it to spin with a regular diff.
A L.S. Diff. allows the wheel with traction to be able to accelerate the car 
out of the corner.

without the turbo, the intercooler does ~squat. With a turbo, I've heard
numbers like +15%. Manufacturers like it because the same reduced charge
temperature (i.e. increased charge density) that gives more hp also
improves engine life. both saab and porsche introduced intercoolers (and
later turbo water cooling) a year (or two?) after the turbos came out.

I can't claim anything near Stan's extensive experience, but that's where

Wayne,
I don't know about taboos, but my cabrio only leaks fron the passenger side
seal, and I suspect it is from an improperly adjusted window (window is too

water and wind).

The biggest leak comes when the top is down though <g>.

Despite what the manual says you can remove the trans without the engine.
Here's roughly what I did (the order is somewhat memory dependant and
arbitrary; do it in the order that makes sense and remember to perform the
steps I forgot to mention :-)

  1. Drop the heat-exchangers and muffler.
  2. Disconnect the trans-to-chassis ground strap.
  3. Disconnect the backup switch wiring (I think that's what it is).
  4. Disconnect the half-shafts at the inner CV Joints and wire them 
     up out of the way.  They'll still be in the way, only less so.
  5. Position a jack under the trans, near the front (about 3/4 of the
     length of the trans should be behind the jack).
  6. Remove the starter and associated wiring.
  7. Remove rear trans-mount nuts.
  9. Support the engine with a couple of jack stands and a block of wood.
 10. Remove the nuts/bolts holding the trans to the engine.
 11. Pull back and lower transmission to ground.

I can't tell you much about putting it back, as I had to subsequently drop
the engine for a rebuild.  I ended up reassembling the engine and trans on
the ground to install them as a unit (per the book).  I suspect clutch
alignment is much trickier to accomplish with the engine up over your head.

Well, the leak can be one of three things:

1) the light body itself

2) the seal behind the light, typically the *TOP* part of the seal (so that 
   run-off from the area around the outside of the trunk lid can run
   down into the trunk)

3) the metal where the light body seats is shot

My worst nightmare car had someone *GLUE* the light bodies into the sockets
using probably some kind of RTV or epoxy. It was so old that it was hard 
to tell. I *DO NOT* recommend gluing them in using RTV.... Figure out exactly
what is leaking, and fix that specific problem.

With many floor jacks you can remove the metal cup from the lifting point
of the jack. Without this cup, the jack clearance is much lower. At least
on my Sears floor jack, the remaining fitting fits nicely under the little
dimples (about 1.5" diam) on the bottom of a 914. I don't know about other
Porsche models, but you should still be able to find something to lift by
which doesn't require the jack's original, tall cup.

The only purpose of the distributor on the Motronic engines (your 3.2) is to
direct the spark in turn to each cylinder.  The actual timing of *when* the
spark occurs is determined by the 
DME electronics which gets it's cue from the position of the timing teeth on
the flywheel.  The maps in the electronics then determine the advance curve,
based on RPM and engine load.

Without looking up where the timing should be at idle, I can't say where the
timing mark should be, but I hope this answers your question on why you can't
move the timing by rotating the distributor as you might expect.

Not a great sign, in any case.

I would keep an eye on the water pump, probably even take off the belt
covers and try to oscillate the pump pulley. If you can do that, time to do
the water pump.

        As Stephen Keller says, yes it is possible.  Two important
things that he leaves out of his procedure though:
        Disconnect (and remove???) the rear shift bar.
        Disconnect the clutch cable.

        Removing the heat exchangers may or may not be necessary--
I did both engine and tranny together, and was able to leave them on.
I think the muffler must come off, though.
        One of the bolts that holds the tranny and starter onto the
engine (the upper-left bolt) is a real bear to get to from the tranny
side.  It must be attacked from the engine compartment side.
        It actually isn't *too* bad to take the engine out at the same
time, though.

    Existing EFI is only truly "closed loop" when its on a Dyno; that     
oxygen sensor only really works at light loads and Idle. Richer mixtures
than the 14.7:1 (like around 11.5:1 at WOT) are programmed into the computer,
the ox-sensor can't really "see" those mixtures. Nor could it sense them
quickly enough for any "throttle" response.
  My other wrong notion was that the aftermarket chips "cheat" on emmissions,
but in fact the EPA doesn't test in that range (high load or WOT) so the
factory is open to do whatever they want at that range. They can program
the computer to act like a "power valve" and richen the mixture at high loads
only; kind of like being able to switch carburetors and jetting on the fly...

    If 14.7:1 ratios were always desirable, and the Ox sensor quick enough,
designing an EFI system would be easy, and you'd never have to worry about
building a big ROM. Instead, the tuners have to rely on Empirical testing
and characterization to build in their curves. The overly rich settings
the factory puts in (like 11.5:1 A/V instead of the "better" 12.5:1)
is a "safe" value put in for warranty; EPA requires 50k miles within spec,
customers demand more. As the fuel pump wears down or the regulators bump
around, the "safe" value is less likely to cause the dealer to replace an
engine.

    Some of the car magazines often feature reviews of "tuners" like Steve
Millen, etc. What I think is amusing in these car tests, depsite huge claims
of extra HP, is that the "expertly modified" cars are rarely much faster
than the factory cars, and sometimes even slower.

     What also interests me is that the aftermarket tuners basically copy the
OEM ROM then modify it a little. This would have to be copyright infringement,
however maybe the factories don't discourage the Chippers as a means of
avoiding having to honor their warranties...

That's good to know. I know for a fact that I'm running lean right now, and I
have the identical coughing start problem when it's cold (it's really a
pretty pathetic sound, isn't it?). I'm glad to hear that a proper mixture

Euuhh...is my antenna supposed to be powered or was that possibly added in
1980? It's permanently in the up position and I wasn't aware that had
up-n-down smarts. I don't recall the manual mentioning it, either; in fact I
have a little key for locking it into the down position. Is something broken
or is my car just too old for this particular nicety?

Anyhow, I'm pretty sure the sound is the fuel pump because it has a far more
burly tone then I'd expect for just raising an antenna. Although, based on
the sound of the sunroof motor, who can be sure? Sometimes I think they used
a turret motor from a defunct Panzer!

I just purchased some used door pockets for a 911.  They are in basically
good shape but the vinyl and some of the carpeting has come loose.  What
type of adhesive is best used to reattach the coverings to the cardboard
inner piece?  The local auto supply stores have an adhesive from 3M that comes
in a spray can, is this stuff any good?

Also, Al at Parts Heaven (formerly Porche Heaven) told me that the armrests
(the pieces that swing up) always came in black, regardless of the color of the
interior.  I find this a little hard to believe.  Is it true?

Not so fast. The big intercooler means that there is more delay (lag) as
throttle input from your foot becomes a pressure wave form the turbo and
works it way through the system. A small turbo on its own gets you less
overall boost. Its a question of optimization, where optimization, is
application specific. The 935 racecar made 800+ (one gazillion) hp and
binary boost: no go at all, and then you rocket down the straight like a
bat out of, (well, you know) while most production cars want more hp from
the same or smaller engine (as in the case of the volvo), with smooooooth
power curves.

For example, the new 911 turbo has twin turbo chargers, specifically to
improve throttle response.

  OFFICE MEMO         911 leaks?                            Date:  5/1/95


I've heard three generalizations about 911 leaks recently:

1) All targas leak in the rain.  Not so.  My 88 *never* leaked.  (When did
Porsche add that rubber piece at the upper front corners?  My 88 had it
and it made a lot of difference.  Can it be installed on older targas?)
2) All cabs leak in the rain.  My 84 didn't.  It had a later-style top, but
one without the newer rain gutters.  And it fit right.
3) All 911's leak oil.  Not if you maintain them.  I did return tubes on
my 88.  It didn't leak for the following few years (when I sold it).  The
84 never leaked during four years ownership.  An 89 needed a cam tower
fix to correct a leak.  It didn't leak for a year afterwards (again, then
sold).
Our 95 doesn't leak (okay, it's only got 7k on it -- it burns oil instead).
I guess it might be fair to say that there are common maintenance
areas required to repair oil leaks (at least in the later years).  But you
do not have to live with oil on the floor of your garage.

BTW, did you know that all Carrera sway bar braces eventually break?

The water cooling is only for the bearings. It saves you having to run the
engine for a few minutes to cool it down after a power run, by cooling the
bearings and ensuring the oil doesn't fry in the turbo. It adds nothing to
the "coolness" of the inlet charge.

The intercooler drops the inlet temperature and this increases the density
of the charge at a constant pressure. The density defines the mass of air
and hence the power developed, apart from the benefits of having a cooler
air mass entering the engine.

The way it works is based upon, I think, Boyles law, which states PV/T=k

From absolute zero a cooling effect from say 175 deg to 75 deg  is
effectively 175 + 273 (say 450) to 75 + 273 (say 350)  Hence the mass would
increase by 28%. There would be other complications like pressure drops etc
to reduce the efficiency.

The question of copyrights is one I find interesting. If I take a chip out
and copy it, have I broken the law?  If I put the copy in the car, only one
version of the software is being used. I think this is like having software
for your PC. As long as only one copy is in use, whether at the office, on
the train or at home, it's not illegal. You have a licence to use the
software when you buy it.

If I make a different version of that software and sell it, is it against
the law? If the buyer has to discard one set of software, to use another,
surely the same applies in that only one set can be used at one time.

I think (hope) this is why the manufacturers have left us alone.

Subject: The Details... (long)




Here's what I just bought, and here also are a few questions that 
might help me figure things out.  

1972 911T, Coupe, in very good physical condition.  Except for
some minor chips on the door edges, and quite a bit of fading on 
the two front fenders, even the paint looks great.  It's dark blue  
(I have yet to check the paint code.)  If the faded part polishes 
out OK, I may not re-paint.  No rust anywhere, except the 
beginning of some on the floor pan next to the battery box on 
the passenger side.  The boxes themselves are fine.  I couldn't 
find any other rust anywhere, even around the brake/clutch 
pedal assembly.  The interior needs new black carpet, and the 
tan lowback seats (leather) need redoing or repairing.  A new 
headliner wouldn't hurt either, but is probably not necessary if 
this one cleans up OK.

All the numbers match.  The engine has to be cranked a lot 
before it will start, but once started it runs smoothly and cleanly.  
I'm going to rebuild it anyway, so I'll figure out why starting is 
hard.  It's got lots of oil on it (what's new?), but the exchangers 
are solid and rust-free, as is the muffler.  

The only real problem is that the transmission is stuck in either 
1st or 2nd.  If it weren't for that, the car would be a good driver 
as -is.  It's not simply a matter of the linkage in the floor tunnel.  
It's stuck.  But I've never worked on a 915 transmission (The one 
in the '72 I just restored was OK.) so am looking forward to it.

I keep thinking there is some hidden flaw, like major accident 
damage, but I just can't find any.  In any event, I remember 
Bruce Anderson saying in his book that if the repair work is so 
good you can't tell it's there, what's the difference?

Some small questions (bigger ones to come, I'm sure).  

1) There is no rubber strip, or guard, running along the sides 
beneath the door.  I like the way it looks without it, but is this a 
'normal' configuration?

2) There also is no front bumper rubber strip or bumper over-
riders.  (The rear is standard with the strips and over-riders.)  
Instead, there is a fiberglass air damn, identical to the (steel) 'S' 
damn that was available as an option that year.  The entire air 
damn is painted the same color as the car, and looks real nice.  
This feature is what makes me think there may have been some 
front-end damage somewhere along the line.  Another 
suspicious item is that both headlights lack the big O ring 
around the chrome bezel, and those little 6" lengths of black 
plastic that run between each fender and the body proper up 
near the windshield are also missing.  It makes me think both 
fenders were replaced, but like I said, if there has been real 
damage, I can't see any evidence of it, and it sure drove nicely, 
albeit not more than 40 mph when I brought it home.  Did these 
cars ever come with a fiberglass dam and no front rubber 
bumper strip?

3) The front parking lights on my '72 911E (which I know are 
stock) are orange plastic.  These seem to be white, with a small 
orange portion, now faded, and the rear end of the lens.  Does 
any one else's T have white lenses?

4) There are no door pockets.  Could it have come this way?  If

5) It has the cheaper gauges.  The gas/oil level gauge has only a

6) Last question (for now).  This might seem to be a small one, 
but I'm trying to deduce what this car's been through.  The hatch 
under the front hood that gives access to the space where the 
jack and tools are stored is painted the same color as the body -- 
dark blue.  The rest
of the trunk is a much lighter blue.  In the '72 911E that I just 
restored, both were the same color.  Does this strike anyone as 
revealing anything important?  Is anyone else's T like that?

Thanks everyone again.  You may be sorry, because you're 
going to have to live through the rebuild!

At the risk of being nominated for T*d of the month/year/decade, I'd like to
continue the "ECU chips" discussion.

The second post mentions a +25 HP gain on the 993 attainable with at an  
aftermarket "chip".

I read the included first post with some interest, because it mentions the
normal distribution ("bell curve") observed in measurable characteristics of
manufactured parts.

Why is this relevant?

Let's consider why achieving an additional 25 HP in an engine might NOT be 
a good idea.

One possible answer might be in "bell curve" production tolerances, but with
respect to different tolerances of individual parts to thermal, mechanical,
vibrational stress.

For example, a given oil cooler will have a certain effective radiating area.

Some coolers may have more, some may have less.

It will depend on where a particular oil cooler falls on the normal 
distribution ("bell curve") of "radiating area" of "the population of
oil coolers".

To complicate the issue, the effective "radiating area" is not likely to be 
constant in time as dust/dirt accumulates in the oil cooler as the car is
driven.

And Porsche may factor in some extra "radiating area" for cars driven
on a hot summer day in Phoenix, AZ with the air conditioning on.

What might be an advantage, to a manufacturer, to know within a few percent,
the peak horsepower of an engine?

One answer, I propose, is the manufacturer then can factor this peak 
horsepower number into the design and specifications of the MANY various 
engine parts with MANY different failure characteristics.

The "bell curve" characteristic implies the manufacturer must design to allow
for individual part samples that fail at DIFFERENT applied stress values.

So a given connecting rod will have an certain tensile strength, others may be 
stronger and some may be weaker.  

For example, the 1972 911S, which developed 190 HP, used a "Tennifer" 
treated ( nitrided? ) forged connecting rod.

The 1972 911T, (140 HP, USA model) only had a forged connecting rod.

The engines had different specific HP outputs, RPM limits....

Could the 911S rod be used in the 911T? 

Probably, but it costs more.

Could the 911T rod be reliably used in the 911S?

Maybe some selected "T" rods, but other "T" rods might fail.

So one could argue the lower stress level of the 911T engine allowed Porsche
to use a less expensive rod.

Remember, Porsche had to achieve an acceptable warranty fail rate on
both 1972 model cars.

A less expensive part can be used, and more failures risked, if the cost, 
to Porsche, in customer satisfaction and money, is balanced by the cost savings.

So Porsche could be fully aware of the alleged +25 HP unused in the 993 
engine, but for reliability reasons they locked it out via their "chip".  

Maybe they EVEN designed an engine with parts to tolerate the 25 added HP
but later substituted less expensive parts when they went to production.

The substituted part could even LOOK the same, since possibly only the minimum
acceptable strength specification for the part would be relaxed, allowing 
more "weaker" parts from the "weaker" end of the "bell curve" population 
to be used.

Now let's take a look at the +25 HP number.

First lets convert it to Watts, a standard unit of power measurement.

25HP * 746 Watts/HP = 18.650KW.

To produce this the engine, at 30% thermal efficiency, will need to burn
gasoline at a rate equivalent to 62.16KW.

This requires the engine to radiate an additional 43.5KW to the outside world.

Restated a little differently, 43.5KW is equivalent to drawing 
181 Amps from a 240V AC line. 

To be valuable, the extra HP should occur at the engine's peak HP point,
so it is applied at an already high stress point in the engine's
operating cycle, where it is burning gasoline at the ~highest rate.

So an engine producing an additional 25HP, will have an additional load
placed on it, the cooling system and other components, which were already
stressed, are even MORE stressed.

But, a particular engine has different components that fall on many 
different "bell curves" with respect to capacity for thermal, mechanical,
vibrational stress.

Might a fraction of engine population be able to RELIABLY take the 
additional stress of producing an additional 25 HP?  

Possibly a fraction could.

But can one make the argument that a RANDOMLY selected production engine
can handle the additional 25HP?

Does the aftermarket "chip" supplier have sufficient information to make an 
informed estimate of the expected additional engine fails that MAY
be introduced for the total population "aftermarket chipped" engines?

How would the aftermarket "chip" supplier determine the excess fails
above those which would ordinarily be expected with factory "chips"?

They'd probably need Porsche company private failure data.

I'll allege that IF an aftermarket "chip" customer is able, on average,
to increase their engine's developed HP, they also increase their chances 
of an engine failure.

Unless..

There is some unique quality that ONLY those engines that can produce
the additional HP also happen to be the engines that can reliably take
the additional thermal/mechanical stress.

Is there any reason to believe this?

Let's say we somehow know there are no excess failures, over the normally 
expected failures, introduced by aftermarket "chips" installed in
a large sample of cars.

This may mean no aftermarket "chip" customers EVER access the additional HP, 
or only access the HP for very short time, or there really is no net gain of HP.

BTW, who assumes the risk of additional engine failures induced by aftermarket
"chips"?

Not Porsche, as their engine warranty is voided by the "chip" installation.

Is the aftermarket "chip" manufacturer's liability limited to the return of
purchase price or does the "chip" manufacturer agree to cover the remaining 
time on the manufacturer's warranty?

Lets assume an aftermarket "chip" customer has an engine failure.

For a customer to PROVE to THEMSELVES or OTHERS, that their SPECIFIC failure
was an "excess failure" caused by the aftermarket chip would require 
determining, somehow, that their SPECIFIC failure was one that would NOT have
ALSO occurred with a factory "Chip" installed.

I don't see how this could be proven, with any certainty, by an individual
owner.

But that doesn't mean that "aftermarket chip induced" excess failures 
don't occur.

The think the point is not whether you are using multiple copies but 
rather whether it is legal to, say to buy some software, apply a patch, then 
sell it as your own creation. I think MS and Apple were in court recently 
when Apple accused MS of copy source code from Apple's  video (mpeg?)

"also improves engine life"

Same thought. manufacturers added the intercooler as much for reliability
as performance, and most (All?) followed that with a cooling pump.

If you figure out how to get more hp from the turbo cooling pump (not
counting turning it off), I'll report you to the thermodynamics police.

Three issues here:

1) if you make a copy for backup purposes, that maybe legal under the
   fair use rules. As you note, you only have one in play at a time.
   Except for

2) you do *NOT* have any form of license to the *SOFTWARE*. Instead, you
   have an implied license to use the *WHOLE* DME unit. The unit is sealed,
   there are these "hey asshole -- don't open this" notices on it, and
   such. This is *NOT* like a program you buy (or in your case, copy)
   somewhere. Then again, maybe it is...

3) the software in question may also be patented as a "device" given that
   it is just a simplification of a mechanical process. You could do that
   in the US for sure. That would bring *DIFFERENT* laws to play

This is what is known as a "derivative work". Most licensing agreements
are pretty clear on this ("you may not modify, network, rent, lease,
loan, distribute or create derivative works based upon..." is a phrase
found explicitly in one manufacturer's license).

International copyright law is also very clear. Copyright to the derivative
works belongs to the original copyright holder. In most cases, selling
something that you do not hold copyright to is felony, and if you have
a business based on that, that would probably also fall under some
of the conspiracy laws which significantly jack up the penalties. Oh, and
then we potentially have the international aspects....

Unless, of course, you're only selling them an unmodified copy of the
software he already owns. In which case, there are probably other
statutes in the Fraud section that apply.

Hope all this helps you Have A Nice Day.

Subject: Re: Trailbraking

To: TROX???

Sorry for not remembering your name, but I need a "reverse lockout" on my
delete key, and I accidently nuked your letter, name, address etc.  In
response to your question about locking the inside front tire when you try to
trailbrake on an autocross course, I have the following suggestions:

A. Are you certain that it is the inside front, which should be heavily
loaded, and not the inside rear, which should be lightly loaded?  If it is
the rear, you may need to stiffen the front roll resistance (tighten your
front swaybar), back off on the brake bias (use harder rear pads) or run
wider rear tires.

B. You didn't say wether or not it you were only locking one inside front
(i.e. only the left or the right).  If so, it may be mechanical in nature:

1) Check your car for a brake problem.  One side may lock easier than the
other, but not exhibit any pulling under normal braking.

2) Check your car for a defective front shock.

3) Check your car for even weight balance.  This is usually the culprit; one
front wheel having more weight on it than the other.

C. If either front wheel locks it is probably what you are doing (i.e.
driving style):

1) Make sure that you do most of your braking before entering the turn.  You
want to carry enough speed to continue your braking as you turn-in, but you
should ease off the brakes somewhat once you start your turn-in.  Your tires
will not turn-in and sustain maximum braking at the same time.

2) Once the car starts to rotate, pick up the gas immediately.  This is the
general idea for trailbraking; to carry more speed into the corner, and use
the weight shift of the car under braking to start it rotating, and use the
weight shift under acceleration to stop the rotation.

3) Be smooth. Jumping on the brakes violently and turning at the same time
will upset the car, and who knows what will happen.

Let me know how you make out.

Your Targa top may have turnd its edges up for a couple of reasons:

* Age.. I think the top dries up in time and shrinks.
* Fit in the car, I have seen Targas where the edges of the top are
squeezed when in the top in locked in. This forces the edge to curl up.
However, I have seen this happen to one edge only not both like you
describe.

Tell us how your top fits in the car and may be collectively we can help
you out.
Is the top dry looking, is it too big for the opening in your roof (front
to back, not sideways).....etc.

I replaced my targa top material about a year ago. I did an ok job, but
next time will do better. Someone (Bob Spindel?) had a great article on
targa restoration if you need it (I did).

Hope this helps, Ehab.

Hi Porschephiles!
     I'm sure that this has been gone over but I'll ask anyway
Is the Throttle Cam for the 944 worth putting in?
I know it will not actually make the car faster but it's supposed to 
make it "feel" a little quicker and thats fine. The thing is only 35

The subject of copyright violation on engine control computers is an
interesting one. I build firmware-based systems to control mass storage
devices. If someone were to buy one of my boxes and reverse engineer the
firmware to make the box operate "better" for their own use, I'd say go
ahead, but don't come crying to me if and when you break the box because
you don't understand the operation of the code under all possible conditions,
or haven't and can't perform a complete parametric test of the code after
the modifications.

On the other hand, if someone buys one of my boxes, makes it "better"
by hacking the firmware and then sells the resulting firmware, I might
be upset because the firmware that they make money on holds lots of
things that cost me lots of money to build. Has this person violated
my copyright? To be sure. Have they hurt my business? That depends. If
the box that is driven by my firmware can only be obtained from me, my
primary concern will be to protect myself from the claims made by people
who buy the "better" chip and then want me to recover their data when it
barfs. So I make it hard to change the firmware without a tamper trail. A
secondary concern will be to see what "better" things have been done
to my firmware. I mean, if the stuff is really better, maybe the box
should ship with the modified firmware to begin with. Maybe I should call
over there and get real technical with the tech support guy and finally
talk to the engineer and offer him a job (any of you chip hackers get
job offers from the OEMs?).

The manufacturers have left you alone because they sell a car no matter
what you do. You're still copying their code and making money off of it.

It would be a different thing if you were reverse engineering the firmware
to determine how to interface with the hardware and then rewriting the
entire thing to incorporate a unique algorithm which makes the car run
better (and better here could be different things to different people)
and then fully testing the entire thing. But my impression from some
reading and the discussion here is that you are mostly modifying a table
of spark and FI timing as a function of RPM, temperature, etc. Will this
modified table perform for all expected operational parameters (load,
altitude, fuel, ambient temperature, etc.)? Guess we just wait for phone
calls to tech support to get the skinny on that one.

Not trying to start a fire or anything, just a different point of view.

Subject: chip thoughts

aka. "Why Porsche might not be so retentive on the chip thing" 
 
1) Porsche enjoys tremendous aftermarket support. They realize the their
cars as sold new, are neither affordable nor acceptable to a certain
percentage of Porsche owners. How many new Turbo owners butcher their cars
with adjustable boost knobs? How many 911 owners have added Turbo tie rods?
The company is used to the idea of high-quality aftermarket products. 
 
2) Chipping allows older Porsches to approximate the performance of the
current models. This convinces some owners to stick with the marque,
instead of switching to a 300Z or RX-7. 
 
3) Porsche has a rep as a high performance car. Chips only serve to
propagate that. 
 
4) Chips and cars form a complementary market. The chip does not do much
good without the car. You cannot buy a car with no chip, and then choose
between factory or aftermarket. So Porsche still makes their money. 
 
5) The existence of aftermarket chips for Porsches means that they are
consistent with all the other mass-marketed sports cars out there. If you
don't think Porsche is mass-market, then consider why the Boxter costs only
$40K. 
 
6) Most performance upgrades diminish the car in some way; ride quality,
emissions, maintenance, noise..... So if chips occasionally blow a head
gasket, that life.

Hi guys,
I've been aspiring to Porsche ownership for my entire life. But for economics
I'd have a 911SC.  A recently concocted plan is this:

Buy a 3.0 core engine.
Completely rebuild the engine.  
    I won't need too many Porsche Factory Tool$.  Will I?
When engine is complete (~1 year) find a donor car and then create motoring
memories.

My questions are these:

What should come with a 3.0 core engine?   
What should I look for in a core?   Run away from?
What is the best source for core engines?  (owner, salvage...)

I plan on doing all my own maintenance anyway so the time I invest is
irrelevant.  I am a stickler for original equipment or better, so parts cost
is the major factor.

Please feel free to konk me on the head if I'm going about this all wrong.

Hi Bob:

Well, I've pulled my engine myself several times now, and it has always been
from the bottom. I did some looking, because I had the same thought, but
came to the conclusion that you would have to remove some of the sheet metal
Housing? support? over the radiator, and then un-bolt the bell housing.
Unfortunatly, the drive shaft extends several inches into the bell housing
and clutch, and the engine has to go a good 6-8 inches forward to clear. Ypu
have to pull your radiator. I used the hanes book the first time, and it was
pretty accurate. Make sure you label all the parts and hoses so you can put
them back where they belong. Pulling a 944 engine is a pain in the
"expletive deleted", good luck.

Every 993 I see has the "hoop" spoiler (ala cabriolet) and the CHMSL is built
into that.  Granted, it's better than the 'tacked-on' look the old one had,
but having the light "cleverly designed into the trailing edge of the roof"

Greetings to all!  As a first time turbo owner, I have decided (not so

etc).  When mounting the turbo and exhaust manifold back into the car, is
there a particular alloy of bolts/studs that are better than others that
will handle the heat and stress?  I have noticed that Automobile Atlanta
sells a resealing kit for the 931, but it is VERY expensive ($398.00), and
includes gaskets that I already have, and they will not just sell me the
studs/bolts/nuts.  Although I understand that 931's are prone to exhaust
leaks, I would like to minimize the problem on re-assembly.

Also, as a side note, has anyone fitted and intercooler to one of these
cars, and, if so, how much more boost would be safe (or not so safe <g>).

Hi,

Just a quick note about this event last Sunday, organized
by our own 944 ecology George Beuselinck. It was held 
in New York state not too far from Newburg, at an airport 
with a grippy concrete surface.

George set up a GREAT 50 second course. And the work
and run assignments were excellent, with a semi-heat
system of two runs per heat, and only working one heat
(when your class does not run). I have been autocrossing
for 15 years and this was the best system I've seen yet.

There were only a few Porsches, mostly other cars (about 70?).
If you are within a few hours, I recommend these events.
They are even catered! (My daughter liked the hot dogs served
by "EAT ME HOT DOGS"). And we got done by 2:30 or so!

To the best of my knowledge, the scissors-type pre-C front latches were
painted body color. The pin and safety catch were white cad or zinc plated. I
don't know of anyplace or any bolt or hardware on a 356 that is gold cad
plated. Some later model VW stuff and 911 stuff is now gold cad.

The later C type latches were white cad or zinc plated. 

This info from a one-owner (before me) 65 C coupe, never wrecked or
repainted.

The pre-C info is from my 61 S90, painted many times but original color is
still visible, and from cars and photos I have seen. All were body color.

At the rear, the receiver bolted to the inside of the engine compartment was
swabbed with black paint. The sheet steel bracket that latched into it,
attached to the engine lid, was painted body color.

Subject: 73 911T reborn!

After 16yrs, I'm trying to bring my 73 911T Targa back to life.  After
all those years the mice and time have taken their toll.  I sold my
356B roadster, in a moment of mental lapse, but really it was getting
too hard to drive it on the street everyday and not worry about it. I
hate to leave it sit just for good days. Now I'm back to early 911s. 
My 911 has no rust and has really weathered pretty well. The paint was
gone when I put it up, ect.
So far I've done the brake, and hopefully the fuel system. My problem
right now is finding a good,CLEAN, 73 CIS fuel tank. I've redone
lines,filters, injectors,distributor,ect. I redid the tank, but it is
junk!! Three fuel pumps later,(in three weeks) I find that the clean-up
was a waste of time. I was pulling bits of rust through the system and
freezing up the pumps.  Hope the filter caught the rest!!  If possible,
I don't want to use a 74+ tank and the compact spare. Also, I'm not
sure if I can still get the rt battery in place. If anyone knows of a
good tank(no boilouts, coatings, or rust) If anyone can help me with
advice and/or info, it would be grealy appreciated.  I have been
involved with Porsche for about 25 yrs,and find it a great hobby and
way of life

return replys to me by email, my POP is down at RH and right now I'm
having to forward everything to AOL. Thanks

Subject: 1981 911SC Questions

Hi,

I finally did it, and am now the proud owner of a GP White 1981 911SC.
Picked it up on Saturday and did 600 miles over the weekend, great fun to
drive.  Thanks to those of you who mailed me during my pre-purchase process.

There are a number of small things I want to fix, and some of you may be
able to help me.

1) The thermostat adjuster dial between the front seats (no AirCon) spins
freely and causes no change to the air temperature.  Is this LIKELY to be
just a connection inside the housing which has come undone?  Should I
attempt to open this box myself, or should I take it somewhere?  OR, is it
really working, but no hot air is coming in because of rust holes(!?!) in
the heat exchangers?

2) The headers/heat exchangers need replacing in the near future.  I am
tempted to replace with standard units (I have access to some secondhand,
will check the state of them first obviously), but may consider after market
items.  Any comments or recommendations.

3) Has anyone installed a QRB/removable face stereo in the standard stereo
location in a 911?  It would appear as though the cigarette lighter, fog
light switch and rear window demister switch will all interfere with the
insertion and removal of such stereos.  Is this the case, if so, are there
any recommended alternative locations, such as in a custom centre console?

4) According to the owners manual the 1981 Targa model has standard two
level rear demister with a two position pull switch for 150w and 300w
heating.  The switch in my car however is a pull/turn type.  I can't seem to
find by trial and error the difference in operation between pulled, turned
and pulled & turned.  Any help?

6) There's an unmarked turn switch (potentiometer (sp?)) type right next to
the steering column on the left (RHD remember).  It's not mentioned in the
owners manual.  Any idea what this might be for (one possibility is some
kind of fader from a previous stereo system).

Any help is appreciated.

TIA.

     Regards, 
     Stephen.

Subject: Re: The Details... (long)

Bob,

I will try to answer some of your "small" questions from memory, as I was
selling these things at that time.  These are recollections only and
therefore are not official.

#1 The rubber strip below the door was standard, and was thin on the "T" and
"E". and thicker on the "S".  

#2 The only optional spoiler available was the "S" version in steel.  The
factory did not offer a fiberglass substitute.  The rubber strip and
overriders were also standard, although many were removed by owners.  If I
remember correctly, the overriders were chrome on the 72 and black on the 73
up to January production when they were replaced with the big black rubber
ones.   The fender welt between the cowl and the fender should also be there
as it is on your E.

#3 The front park/turn lenses should be the same as on your 72 E. 

#4 Door pockets and sill guards were also standard.

#5 The "S" gauge package was available and should be able to be added.

#6 I'm not sure on this one, but I think the trunk area was all the same
color, including the hatch area.

I think you are right, this car has had some body/paint work done, but only
you can determine the extent.  

good luck on the resto

Subject: Re: Painted Latch on 356

Pete says, "I don't know of anyplace or any bolt or hardware on a 356 that is
gold cad plated....

The later C type latches were white cad or zinc plated.... 

At the rear, the receiver bolted to the inside of the engine compartment was
swabbed with black paint. The sheet steel bracket that latched into it,
attached to the engine lid, was painted body color."


Pete, when I had the mechanicals rebuilt on my one-owner '65 356SC at
Stoddard's about 15 years ago, it was returned with gold cad valve covers,
distinctly different (to my chagrin) from the white cad ones it wore when
delivered to them.  Ostensibly, valve covers were routinely replaced on their
rebuilt engines because "they are prone to warp".  (Mine were not warped,
however.)  Whether the gold cad was Stoddard's touch or a copy of the way
some earlier valve covers left the factory I do not know.  As best I can
remember offhand, that's the only gold cad on the car.

As you point out, and as I responded privately to Allen, all the front hood
latch components on the 356SC are "galvanized", or zinc plated.

All components of the engine deck lid latch on the 356SC, however, were
painted body-color (both top and bottom pieces).

(Stephen Robb asks about some stuff amiss with his new baby, including 
 thermostat and "mystery potentiometer".)

Hi, Stephen,

   Hey, glad to hear about your purchase!  Congrats!  I can help (?) on 
only two things.  It sounds like you have the "Sport" package, which had
this thermostat.  The center thermostat knob is pretty unusual, so many 
of the list may have no idea what you are talking about (am I right?).  
Most 911's have only a red lever between the seats, which controls the hot 
air flow into the cabin (except for T*d's, which had no control over the hot
air flowing in the cabin ;-).  Our (I have one too) thermostat-thing is
merely a motor to move the lever and a control circuit.  The temperature is
read from that strange, rubber-looking device that is mounted just above
the windshield (windscreen for you NZ-ers?) between the seats.  I have 
ahem, "empirically determined" that if this sensing circuit is 
open-circuit, that it thinks it is cold and moves the lever to full hot, 
and if it is shorted, it thinks it is hot and shuts the heat off.  I 
would therefore first try removing the sensor, and disconnecting the connector
(like a little coax).  The heat lever should move up.  Otherwise, your 
problem lies elswhere.  BTW, I *think* you can just actuate the lever 
manually without harm to the system (list?).

    The potentiometer on the dash sounds like it might be the intermittent 
wiper pot.  Mine is on the right of the steering column, between the speedo 
and the clock, and above the headlight washer switch.

Subject: Problem with '82 930 brakes / vacuum system


Hi,
Having acquired my 930 in last November, I have been furiously reading and 
learning about Porsches in general and this car in particular. I even 
bought the factory manuals, and so far I have fixed lots of little 
problems. But I am very concerned that my stopping power isn't nearly as
good as it should be. All the books and articles claim that the 4-piston
brakes with "racing heritage" are amazingly wonderful. Yet my 2 Toyota
Celicas stop quickly and predictably, but the Porsche requires lots of
pedal power and even then comes more to a gentle stop rather than feeling
suddenly bolted to the ground.

Here is what I already tried:

1) Old pads were ok but got brand new genuine pads. No difference.
2) Bled the brakes many times until I got the hang of it, using all 8 
   valves. Boy the old brake fluid was dirty! Replaced it with new clear
   Castrol GTLMA Dot3/4 fluid. Pedal is slightly harder but no improved
   stopping power.
3) Replaced master cylinder. Put in brand new genuine unit. No difference.
4) Checked the booster check valve. Works fine. 
5) Took out pads, exercised all 16 pistons. When pushing on the brake
   pedal, some came out quicker than others but I selectively used the 
   brake bads to block the ones that came out first, then I cleaned the
   circumference of all pistons with fresh brake fluid and gently pressed
   them back in. Having never worked on brakes before I was surprised how
   much force was required to move the pistons back in. Yes I used
   something that wouldn't scratch the pistons.
6) Per factory manual I turned engine off, pumped brakes many times, then
   pushed on the pedal while I turned the engine on and felt that the pedal
   went in slightly. (Ever so slightly. Maybe less than half an inch). The
   factory manual doesn't say how much it is supposed to go in.
7) Going 40 I really slammed on the brakes, which left some tire marks from 
   the front tires. Nothing in the rear. 

   I ordered new brake rotors for the front, and also ordered seals, dirt
   scraper rings, and spring plates for rebuilding the front calipers, and
   so far I dropped almost $1000 but I have this nagging feeling that the 
   real problem may be the booster or relative lack of vacuum going to it.

   I bought a vacuum gauge and I found that only about 6 lb vacuum is being
   sucked out of the booster. There is a Tee in the vacuum hose which is 
   being used to purge a charcoal canister for gas tank venting, and if I
   plug this vacuum leak that the importers of the car imposed on me then
   my vacuum goes up to 14 lb, my brakes still don't work much better, and
   my engine idles very rough (because the idle mixture was tuned with this
   intentional leak in place)

   Questions, questions, desparate questions:

   1) How much vacuum does the brake booster need to work properly ? None
      of the factory manuals or spec books say this. How can I tell if
      the booster boosts as much as it is supposed to ? 

   2) If I wanted to change the fuel tank venting either to the true US
      standard, or back to the euro standard, how would I accomplish this?
      I traced a hose from the fuel tank to the genuine Porsche "expansion
      chamber" which sits in the left front wheel well above the windshield
      washer tank. Fron this black plastic expansion chamber a hose goes to
      a Purolator charcoal canister which is BMW original equipment, and
      from there the hose goes to the Tee in the brake booster vacuum line.
      Can anyone with a 930 tell me if they have a expansion chamber in
      their wheel well and where the output hose from this thing should go?

    3) Would it be wise to get the "928S4" brake caliper kits advertised by
       Windward or PowerHaus for about $1000, then rebuild the old front 
       calipers and stick them in the back ? I feel very vulnerable with
       my current lousy brake performance. New front calipers at $700 +
       per piece seem to be a significantly worse deal than the "upgraded"
       928S4 kits that are advertised. I don't want used or rebuilt
       calipers. 

	Thanks for any information you may have on the above subject or
	any brake caliper rebuilding advice you are willing to share !

Hi,

	My 914 trailing arm bushing gave out completely, and I need to
replace it ASAP. I am debating between the Weltmeister bushings, or the
stock ones. What are peoples preferences on these? There are pros and cons
to both ideas. 

Poly:	con- road noise
	pro- lateral stiffness
	con- squeaks alot
	pro- cheaper than the stock option
	con- been told that they don't fit well. (by an Automotion tech)

Stock:	con- bonded to arm, need to replace whole assembly (?)($$)
	pro- quiet
	con- not as stiff as poly
	pro- quiet

I know, I wrote quiet twice. But think about how anoying a squeak gets over
time. Yes, it's for an autocrosser, but it's also a daily driver right now.

Any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks...

Subject: Re: E-Z fix??

I think I encountered the same problem on my '75--repeatedly.  I think
the part is basically the same, except that '76 and later had a
plastic lever instead of a metal one.  When my second switch wore out,
I replaced it with a later-type one, since the mechanic thought it
could be the weight of the lever.  Then the turn signal stopped
cancelling on one side, which turned out to be a related problem.

The upshot is a fix that Bruce Anderson had told me about, but about
which the dealer's service people claimed to know nothing.  That is,
to install a relay for the lights.  Evidently it's done that way in
Europe where lights are brighter.  I had it done about eight years ago
and have had no problems since.

The turn signal-dimmer switch is all one unit and cannot be serviced.
Sticking a wad of cardboard in back of the lever is a temporary and
tacky fix.  Replacing the unit works, but if you've had the problem
once you'll have it again.  A generic relay (Bosch or Wehrle) will do
the job, spliced in line with the wiring coming from the headlights to
the fuse box.  But your switch is shot.  The aftermarket places all
carry it, since it seems to be an item that frequently needs
replacement.

> I've got 2 annoyances I'm trying to find out about on my '81 911SC....

All the Original 356's I've seen have  the front and rear hood latches
painted the same color as the car. This means, of course, that with time and
use the paint gets scratched off, looks ugly and rusts. Also the paint as it
flakes off tends to get into the latch mechanism and gum up the  works. 
    The Late, Great, Herr Dean Pfundstein (bless his soul), always thought
the latches should be Cad plated instead of painted, and I agree- the latches
DO look and  work better when plated rather than painted.
    This was one of several areas that Dean thought the Factory cheaped out.
Another was the bar that goes across the back  of the bottom  of the rear of
the seats. It's painted, but Dedan always chromed them to match the
chrome-plated side rails of the seats. Again, I agree.
KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

My manual says that pulling it turns on the rear window defroster, and
turning it turns on the *windshield* defroster. I can see heating elements
in the windshield, but I've never noticed any defrosting when the switch
is turned -- I always have to use the blower to defrost.

Subject: Porsche Targa Info


Danny, 

 3 years ago I came to the end of a 2 year search for my pefect Porsche. It
was, after exhausting research a 1972 911 "E" Targa. Both the 911 and 912
Targa's were introduced at the 1965 Frankfurt Motor Show, It was dubbed
'Targa' in memory of the Targa Floria, the famous long distance race in
Sicily. The very first models came with a zip out rear plastic window,
unlike the fixed glass models that came later. These plastic rear window
models are rare and I have never heard of one in OZ land.

I picked up my car on the Gold Coast for the amazing price of $20k. The car
only needing work because of my desire to own a most pristine example. My
biggest problem was a rust patch in the offside rear seat well, the cause
was a leaky rear window. This problem of course not restricted to Targa's.

When it comes to prices, the year of manufacture is very important. This is
because of the introduction of the impact bumper model for our friends in
the US. Pre-impact bumper models have, in my mind a more classic and
attractive look, but this I'm sure could be the subject of much debate. Yes
late 70's 911 Targas can fetch upto $50k, but for $50k my money would be on
a mid 70's Carrera Coupe. But that's my opinion only.

Hope this helps...

two, years for obvious reasons. Cambell Hausfield does make good compressors
and reliable, but if you want an alternate route.. There is a company that
sells an Aluminum pump (with cast iron cylinders) for about 199.00 (just the
pump only) that will do anything from 6CFM to 12CFM depending on how fast you
run it. But thats only a good route if you have a spare motor and tank lying 
around. (thats what i had)...
If interested I'll dig up the name of the company that sells that pump..

I posted a note a while back about my dimmly illuminated battery light, and
the potential cause.  I also mentioned that most of my concern was due to a
previously bad rebuilt alternator from Vertex and consequent damage.  At this
point, I just want to be fair.

Back in September when the original rebuilt alt was a problem, Mike at Vertex
worked with me in an expedient manner to replace the damaged parts and rush a
new voltage reg ASAP.  Last month (7 months later) when I called with concern
about the alternator core, Mike sent a replacement alternator at no cost and
with no questions.

The point:  I think I Vertex originally sold a rebuilt alternator that slipped
through QA unchecked.  (They need to slap thier suppliers around and shape them
up.)  But, they have worked with me in a very professional and courtious
manner to correct the problems, and they deserve credit for that.

At the rear, the receiver bolted to the inside of the engine compartment was

attached to the engine lid, was painted body color."


Pete, when I had the mechanicals rebuilt on my one-owner '65 356SC at
Stoddard's about 15 years ago, it was returned with gold cad valve covers,
distinctly different (to my chagrin) from the white cad ones it wore when
delivered to them.  Ostensibly, valve covers were routinely replaced on their
rebuilt engines because "they are prone to warp".  (Mine were not warped,
however.)  Whether the gold cad was Stoddard's touch or a copy of the way
some valve covers left the factory I do not know.  As best I can remember
offhand, that's the only gold cad on the car.

As I responded privately to Allen, all the front hood latch components on the
356SC are "galvanized", or zinc plated.

Also, all components of the engine deck lid latch were painted body-color
(both top and bottom pieces).

One thing you can do as a temporary fix is to remove the switch and
inspect it.  The thin pieces of wire in the switch sometimes need to be
rebent so they don't contact each other as easily - can't remember the
details but I've been able to figure it out twice and it's saved me a ton
of cash, as the switch is 70+ of those green things I once had.  Be
gentle.  As to the comment about relays being installed, this is a
physical effect from switching the high beams on and off, not an
electrical problem, although it can cause the switch to fry out
eventually.  I tend to 'signal' other Porsche drivers a lot, and that's a
prime cause.  This was documented in an article in either European Car or
Excellence a while back (Euro Car I think), FWIW.  If you want, I can look
the article up in my index of Porsche-related magazine articles.

picky, picky, picky. A thin intercooler won't give as low an exit
temperature, and eventually, the inceased inlet surface area will introduce
too much drag on the car. In the limit, you could just have finned aluminum
plumbing-no lag, and virtually no cooling. I assume what ends up in the car
is a compramise of lag, thermal efficiency, and available space.

So why are there a gazillion aftermarket 930 intercoolers, and NO
aftermarket 951 intercoolers?
Could it be the available space is already filled mit intercooler?

About your hi beam problem, I had exactly the same problem on my 83 SC.  If you take the cover off the steering column and find the little box at the end of the light stalk you will see that there are several metal reeds that control the headlights.  You have to figure out which one turns on the high beams and flex it away from the reed that activates it.  I took the entire stalk off the column (this requires a little more disassembly) and performed this procedure.  The amount you need to flex the reed is quite small.  Afterwards, the high beams came on only when I moved the lever.

I replaced mine the first time, as the original had melted its plastic by
the time I got around to it, but the replacement went bad a year later.  I

I would definitely recommend the cheap fix, as it only requires removing

I just happen to purchase a used 944 with quite a few problems.  But the

the heater keeps blowing hot air, and the rear window defogger is out 
also.  For the Air conditioner I think that it might need to be recharged 
but every time I start the car, there is a squeeking noises coming from 
the the unit.  The climate control seems to only blow hot air and won't 
shut off.  Could it be the thermostat, heater valve or something else?  
And for the rear window defogger, the do the struts need to be of plastic 
so that the positive terminal on the passenger side isn't grounded?  Oh, 
and a final question, a couple of the lights indicating the gear I'm in

Given that the hoop would be ineffective on the new turbo (I believe
that the turbo spoiler would get in the way either effectively or
aesthetically) I have read that the "trailing edge" CHMSL will be used
on the turbo.

It's only speculation, but perhaps once they tool up for it, they will

Seems we have talked about this before.  I don't remember what Bruce
Anderson told me but I do remember what the service tech at a dealership
said during the 993 overview course he went to at PCNA in Reno.  Seems
there was a problem with the "glass" mounted CHMSL on to the rear window
during production of the cars after the initial few were photographed for
advertising.  The "basket handle" was the quick fix.  I love the idea
about putting it into the trailing edge of the roof line but aren't there
ventilation holes in there already?  Maybe there is room for a few bright
lights though.  I seem to remember seeing the new Turbo with the light
again on the rear window.  Will see what happens when it hits stateside. 

Maybe Bruce can respond again if he has time?  It was good seeing some of 
the oldtimers out at the Automotion swap meet last weekend including 
Bruce.

Subject: Water Cooled Turbos

I know that the 944 Turbo has the water cooled turbine. There is also a timer
that keeps pumping coolant through the turbine for a short while after the
engine has been turned off. 

It is still a VERY good idea to let a turbocharged engine run slowly before
being turned off. This can be done as easily as just driving slowly before
the car is shut down. This has a number of benefits, including slowing the
turbine down (it runs as fast as the exhaust gas flowing through it), and
letting fresh OIL circulate through the turbine, which will help cool the
turbine. My last car was a Buick Grand National, which had 110K miles with
all original engine components. Those cars had a reputation for blowing up at
50K miles, if not properly cared for.

    The water cooling is only for the bearings. It saves you having to run
the
    engine for a few minutes to cool it down after a power run, by cooling
the
    bearings and ensuring the oil doesn't fry in the turbo. It adds nothing
to
    the "coolness" of the inlet charge.

Does anyone know on which models Porsche implemented this feature?  Is it on
the 9[24]4 series as well as the 930s?  And how come we haven't seen a 928

Hey Dudes and Dudettes:

        Have you seen the article on the '96 twin turbo C4 in Autoweek? It
is  nice reading material. BUT, have you noticed that the rim design is
(front or rear) bidirectional?  The new 18" alloys (which are of a patented
build process) have a "twist" in the spokes. This twist points to one
direction viewed from the right hand side, and it points to the apposite
direction viewed from the left hand side. I suspect that Porsche may have
made only one mold (one for rear and one for front) so rims can be used on
either side of the car. I personally like symmetry in a car and hence would
prefer if Porsche had made right and left rims. Not a big deal but a
personal taste. I would like to know for sure thu why they opted to do so!
I checked my new 993 porsche book which has the turbo in it to make sure it
is not the photos in autoweek.... the rims are as explained above.

The article teased my senses and I made a promise to get a used one in 1998
(will suffer with the rims). I am putting money aside already and starving
to death....who wants an 84 911 Targa in about two years?

Thanks to all of you who responded to my query re the subject trivia.  I

hardware, upper and lower is painted.  I've stripped my upper hardware for
the front deck lid and a small amount of factory primer still remains,
seeminly help  confirm that these part were originally painted.  Further to
Harry's point, the factory probably should have plated these parts as the
paint scapes off and in fact as Pete points out, his T-6 has plated parts.

Brents book makes no mention of this subject.  However, the 356 Registry
compilation does have a small section on fitting the latch hardware which
implies these things are painted but didn't make specific mention of years or

        As most of you know, I right now have the "opportunity" to
have my engine rebuilt.  I'd like to ensure that the rebuild lasts as
long as possible.  What kind of longevity mods can/should I make to
the engine?  If you can, please throw in a ballpark estimate on how
much it would cost to have someone do the mod for me.
        Already under consideration:  Balanced crank (if it can be made
better-balanced than stock), higher-flow oil pump (for later addition
of external oil cooler), trying to match piston and rod weights very
very closely...
        Others?

There are aftermarket "oilers" that run for several minutes, as does the
water pump for water cooled turbos. That's what the cool down lap at track
events is for: cool ALL the machinery down. Wouldn't want a driver to
spontaneously combust because he didn't have time to cool down. I hate when
that happens.

To all:

The Bad news is:  Sally and I are accepting new jobs (transfers) that will
take away from all the friends in the Houston area autocross/PCA/SCCA scene.

Good news is: These new jobs are in the San Francisco Bay Area, arguably one
of the top Porsche and autocross Mecca's in the free world!  We're looking
forward to renewing some relationships we had, making some new friends and
having some really kick-butt local competition!

Now some of you may think I have this backwards (good to get rid of us, bad
to see us return) and to you I say: Nayayayayaya...

Move date will be late June, so maybe a late entry to Parade and a switch to
Wendover Pro instead of Harrisburg??

Subject: 914 Trials and Tribulations

Well, if anyone remembers, I've got the bad left suspension console 
problem. I think I'll end up buying the used piece from Automobile 
Atlanta and getting it installed ASAP, but this had got me thinking...

My '75 is in pretty decent shape, but still needs some notable rust 
repair. I had the rockers and nearby floor replaced when I bought it, 
along with the battery tray, but it still needs the bottom of the 
firewall repaired, the metal under the sail panels fixed, and there's 
some other less-than-ideal places.

The thought currently bouncing around my addled brain is, get it back 
and working, then search in earnest for an affordable, stripped, 
RUST-FREE shell and then spend time transferring all the parts over. My 
interior is perfect, the engine is pretty good, brakes good, etc, 
etc... Basically if I could find a rolling chassis, with no rust, no 
dents (or minimal dings), no interior, and no engine, for a bit under 
$1000, I'd be very happy and able to turn it into a driver with some 
work.

Any thoughts on this? Am I dreaming on the price? (Especially since in 
I'm in upstate NY - not known for rust-free cars.) I'd probably be 
saving money in the long run, compared to what it'll cost to fix the 
rust on mine. Plus, how is interchangability between a '75 and 
earliers? I don't think I could afford to be picky when changing... 
Will the '75 1.8 w/L-Jetronic be usable in an earlier one, without TOO 
much wiring changes? (I'd prefer to get a '73 or newer...)

Any thoughts would, as always, be very welcome.

Subject: What to look for...

Hi, all...

I'm going out tomorrow to view a '73 914 2.0L, and I'd like to
gather a little wisdom as to what to watch for...

I *have* owned one before (another '73 2.0), and I think I'm aware of
major rust areas (rear fenders, battery area, etc), but that was 10
years ago and I may be a bit 'rusty' on this (heh heh).

Owner claims the motor has been rebuilt though NOT by a recognized shop
("Friend who is Porsche mechanic") - I'm a bit leery about this, though I
think if all looks and feels good I'd be prepared to risk it.

Owner also claims to have replaced the 1st gear synchro recently.

The car has the 'correct' Fuchs alloys, though only 4, not 5 - I presume
that 5 were standard on the '73 as my other one had 5. Other than this,
I'm told the car is stock.

Owner also claims the carpeting needs replacing - any guesses as to what this
might cost?

Thanks - any pointers I can get would be appreciated!

The rear lid on my 80 911SC sometimes pops open after going over a sharp

mechanism which is on the lid itself, or wear or looseness in the "female"

budge...I thought that if I tighten it in a bit, it may keep the lid closed.

I'm sure that I read -somewhere- that the CHMSL was supposed to be at the top

having something to do with the window seal.  Therefore -The "baskethandle".
Supposedly, this was to be fixed and the roof/window version (MUCH better

4WD 993s.   

I don't like the "baskethandle" myself, but it's still a lot better than the "E.T."
thing on the cabs.  

BTW has anybody seen a 4WD version yet?  Last I heard, they still hadn't
shipped any over here because they are fiddling with the F/R differential settings

Stephen,

    Regarding the unmarked "turn switch" on the 911 dashboard: Sounds like
you're describing the control knob for the intermittent wipers. They are
mentioned in the drivers manual (if you got one). If you turn it until it
just "clicks", the wipers will come on fairly frequently, turning the switch
a little more will make them come on less frequently. 
    My 911 SC is a 1980 but I am assuming that your 1981 is similar enough for
 this to be of some help.
    By the way, congrats on buying a 911. Also, as far as the rear defogger
goes, on mine, (I may be wrong, but...) I think it is strictly push pull and
there are 3 positions: off, low, and high.
    Hope I was of some help.

From: HermanHome@aol.com
Subject: Entering the Corner

In my last posting, I discussed the importance of learning how to come out of
a corner.  It is the foundation on which the rest of turn is built.  I
explained that there is a point in the corner that you pick up the throttle
and accelerate, as fast as possible, past the apex and out of the corner.
 That point, the transition point, separates the entry from the exit.  Once
you have reached that point, it is all exiting the turn.  That provides you
with 90% of your speed, and once you can accomplish this consistently, and
safely, you are ready for the next step, entering the turn.

Working on entering the turn is the first step for the intermediate driver to
master.  The reason that I urge you novice drivers to not worry about
carrying any entry speed, is that you must know exactly where the transition
point is, and how fast you want to be going at that point, and at what
attitude relative to the apex, BEFORE you can figure out how deeply (read
fast) you can stuff your car into the turn!  You may be able to get into a
groove if your instructor leads you every step of the way, and that is his
job, but I want you to learn how to do this for yourself.  That way, you will
learn it more completely, and you will be able to recognize minor errors
before they turn into big mistakes (read spins).  

Remember that almost every corner is two separate entities, decelerating into
the transition point, and accelerating out from the transition point.  Once
you know where that transition point is, and at what speed you want to be
going, you can work on shortening the time it takes you to get there.  By
this I mean waiting to brake later, and using the weight shift of the car to
improve it's grip, so that you can enter the turn carrying more speed.
 Approaching transition point, you will have the car slowed enough, and
rotated enough, that once there, you can floor the accelerator, and exit the
turn under full power.  If this technique sounds like my discourse on
trailbraking, it is.  Unless your car has terminal oversteer (and if so, fix
it because oversteer on the track is slow) you will find that to carry more
entry speed, you will have to continue your deceleration all the way up to
the transition point.  That does not mean that you will be braking heavily
all the way, it just means that the car will be slowing down until you reach
the transition point.

Some of you will be adamant about braking in a straight line.  You can
certainly brake hard in a straight line, and then ease off the brakes and
turn-in.  This will minimize the weight shift, and leave you in a stable
position to transfer to the gas.  If your car oversteers, you will have to do
this.  But it means that you will be going slower in the entry of the turn
than the "trailbraker", because the rear of your car will slide out when you
make that initial turn-in unless you are going slower.  But, as you improve
on this technique, you will find yourself "leaning on the car " harder, and
will rely more on the weight shift to get your turn-in done.  Then you will
need the transfer to the gas to keep the rear from sliding out.  Remember
that the more speed you carry into the corner, the harder it will be to get
the car to turn-in.  You will need as much of the weight of the car on the
nose as possible to get the front tires to grip.  That means that you must
still do some braking.  As soon as the car rotates, you will have to get on
the gas to give the rear tires grip.

Some final points on this.  There are always some turns that do not apply,
and there are always degrees to which you will apply this technique.  On some
very fast sweepers, I actually brake in a straight line, and step back down
on the gas *before* I turn-in.  The reason for this is that I want maximum
stability and grip on the sweeper, and I want to drive the car through the
turn.  I do not want any rotation, or slide, and I definitely do not want the
rear to get light.  Mild understeer is definitely desirable here.  Now
entering hairpin turns, I will continue braking *very* aggressively deep into
the turn.  I want to brake as late as possible because it's a slow turn, and
get maximum rotation to get through such a tight turn.  I will wait for the
rear to "come around" a little before I pin it with the gas.  This is the
method that the pros use to "slide it " through the turn.  It's the quickest
way through at a hairpin.  For the average turn, it's up to you and how your
car handles that will determine how much you will brake into it.

If anyone has any other specific driving questions for discussion, let me
know.

the finish comes up on the spokes.

Questions:

Has anyone ever had experience doing this?  Is it truly dipped or are they set
in a tub with the paint poured in around them?  It's a semigloss black but what
would be the best "type" of paint to use to match the original finish?

Any advice would be more than appreciated.

Thanks!

Mitch,
The 83 SC you wrote about is easily worth the $15k asking price if the
following info you provided is accurate.

>black on black
>original paint - no accidents

Even though SCs have fallen in price in recent times, good low mileage ones
are still great cars and worth looking at. Witness what Ted Smith sold his
'78 SC for.   I don't know what the other folks on Pfiles think, but I find
it hard to believe that an SC as described above has an asking price of
'only' $15k. If it had 59k, 79k, 99k, or greater miles, it would make more
sense.

When you melt a switch repeatedly like this, it's usually a sign you're
running too many amps through it.  Have you diddled with the bulbs in the
headlights, or  added driving lights to the same circuit without using a

Subject: What, A Great Mechanic?

     Recently my 944 needed a cam tower gasket replaced, as well as belts and
oil cooler gaskets replaced.  
    I'm currently residing in Murray, KY, a sprawling metropolis of 10,000 or
so residents, located in western KY.  When I became aware of my need for
service, I wrote off the idea that I could find a competent local mechanic.
 I assumed I would have to have it towed to Nashville (2.5 hrs away) for
service.  But then.......one day I was out and drove by a repair shop that
had two other 944's sitting outside.  I stopped and inquired, and sure
enough, the proprietor, Mike Brothers was an experienced Porsche mechanic.
 In fact he has worked at a total of 5 Porsche dealerships during his career.
 
     He was professional from the beginning and even allowed me to order my
own parts(saving myself approx $200).  He allowed me to shadow him while he
worked on it, and took the time to teach me alot about the car.  His
attention to detail was relentless, and in fact, showed me a couple of
instances of the dealership screwing up on previous service attempts.  
     I realize that a very small portion of this audience lives near Murray,
but to those who do, I highly recommend this mechanic, who is skilled, fair,
and extremely reasonable.  I could go on and on......His number is
502-762-0791.  He is located on Industrial Road in Murray KY near the Land
Between the Lakes Region(2.5 hrs from Nashville, 1 hour from Paducah, 2 hrs
from Memphis, and 3 hours from St. Louis).  Tickled pink in the Boonies,

Subject: Why all this Valve Adj: '71 2.2l E

The recent rash of valve adjustment discussions inspired me to see what
Porsche reccomended for my early 911.

I would like to quote the Service Schedule for the 1971 Type 911E (2.2l). [1]
 This table contains other maintenance items as well. My comments are in ( ).

6,000 to 6,600 mi. from new (or after rebuild) 
 Check valve clearance
 Check compression
 Check rocker arm shaft tightness (torque)
 Check ignition (points, plug gap, etc.,etc)
 Check fuel system (MFI linkage, MFI adj.)
 Change oil/filter, clean strainer, transmission oil,fuel filter
 Check brake system
 Check belt tensions (alt. and MFI pump)
         Check wheel alignment

Then, repeat every 12,000 miles except for brakes, all filters, oil and wheel
alignment which retain the 6,000 mile.

This would mean the valves should stay in adjustment for 12,000 miles for a
normal (whatever that is) 911E. Of course more intensive maintenance is at
the discretion of the owner. I chose to do all of this stuff every spring at
the minimum and I change the oil (Mobil 1) every fall before long periods of
winter (salt on the roads) inactivity.

How many of us have had our rocker arms torqued lately??

Completely wishful thinking.  Unless you completely change the major
parameters of your engine (displacement, cam, larger valves, enlarged ports,
etc.) you're not going to get more than about 5 hp.

And don't waste your time with chipping the car. Your normally aspirated,
sans knock sensor motor will find no more than about 5 hp with the best chip
available (at least that has been my experience...)

Don't do it. Keep your car original. Motronic FI, even the early 944 type,
is vastly superior to just about any carburetor setup you can devise for it,
and, btw, you'll be in mostly uncharted waters...

Bottom line, the best performance increases you can do for your 83 944 are:

1) Brakes - Carbon Fiber Brakes are best for the track. I have had good
experience with Repco Metal Masters for the street.

2) Tires - Get the best tire you can afford. For the track, a lot of people
are very happy with the BFG CompTA R1 and the Yoko A008PRSII tires.

3) Driver - Get as much education that you can afford. PCA Driver ed is just
about the cheapest seat time available.  And, that education is
portable...it doesn't disappear when you sell your old car.

Last, after you have done all of the above and are still dissatisfied with
the performance of your 83 944, sell it and buy a Turbo. It's cheaper to buy
a car with all the goodies than to try to add the goodies one at a time...

Hi Doug,

The people who make and use the huge thin intercoolers claim tremendous
efficiencies for these intercoolers when compared to the older styles. I have
to admit I haven't done any testing myself and can only go along with their
claims. 

I have some friends who have made larger intercoolers for the 951 by welding
to of the 951 cores together. If you are going to try to get a lot more power
out of one of those engines you will need more intercooler. They have also
come up with some larger more efficient radiators for the same problem. 

Yes, the 934 and the first 935s had single turbos, but they went to twins to
improve the drivability in 1977 on the factory 935 and 1978 on the customer
cars.

I know what you mean. Mine is mounted on top of brake cooling duct. its on
the lower outside part of the nose. the detector looks through the plastic
nose. The nose piece is insulating so there is no attenuation of the RF. Of
course you do suffer in sensitivity by lowering the detector closer to the
ground, but its offset by never having to worry about having the damn thing
stolen.

Note- If you do mount an inside type detector on the outside, make sure you
seal it up good, and don't use RTV. RTV contains vinegar, which will rot
your circuit board, and make the quartz crystal go poopy (that's the
technical term).

I can think of 3 things that could cause what you're describing, i.e.
pads are either too loose or too tight, given that you can move the
pad both ways with the adjuster.

1) Forgive me if this is too simple, but you know that there is an
adjustment that must be done through the trailing arm?  If you just
play with the one on the outboard side of the caliper you would get the
symptoms described.

2) The cable is adjusted such that when you pull the handle only one
of the caliper levers is being pulled.  This can happen (even though the
Y-piece behind the seat is there) because the springs on the calipers
can be different strength.  Get under the car and look at the stop pins
for the lever directly on the bottom of the calipers.  Look while the
parking brake is on and when it is off.  On my car you can feel the
difference between them.

3) Something is stuck so that the lever is always "pulled".  Again you
must look underneath at the stop pins when the brake is on and off.

If the pistons can move both ways with the adjustments, you are most
of the way there.  Also, I have found that the spec of .008" of play
on the rear pads is excessive, and makes the brake pedal and parking
brake throw longer, so I get it down to about .002" like the front
brakes.

I thought about that. Did they just seal up one inlet and one outlet, or
were the ends reshaped?
more lag is just what I need. when I'm really driving, well, on, I find I
can mash the pedal almost as soon as I'm off the brakes (at least in the
sweepers), and the turbo spools up just right.

Porsche made a big to-do about the 951's internal "cooler" for the turbo

Bob356, I didn't get the rest of your message, must have gotten mangled

melted, I think because of the reeds being in constant contact.  The other

gently solved the problem.  Others have encountered the same situation.

Subject: 3.0 Engine Needed

Hi Gang:

I have a friend who want to put a 3.0 in his 73 911.  He didn't want to get into
the computer engine management stuff... he's looking for a fairly straight
forward install.

Anybody out there have a 3.0 they want to sell???  It could be bigger if it were
carbed and didn't have all the electronics.

Let me know.

Thanks!!!

Attention 914 Porschephiles!

  I am selling my 12 year collection of 914s and parts.  Everything must go! 

Here's what I have....
   
     1976 914
     28xxx miles
      No rust
      I think I remember that it does have a console.

Here are the details.  I bought this 1976 car from the original owner. He had 
and his daughter had driven it early in its life.  Then it sat for many years. 
It needs paint ( original color is white) and the engine is stuck. If you are
interested in restoring a 914, you can't beat this for an excellent start.

       1975 914
        Many miles
        Has rust
        Ragged interior
        Excellent parts car ( or if you have ambition, it could be restored,
good floors
        Cheap!

As you can see, you really don't need much in terms of details on this car. The
above pretty much says it all.


       914 Parts

           3 trans
           2.0 engine
           2.0 engine apart

            Original dealer installed radio and speakers

            Doors
            Hoods

             911 Fuchs wheels, 15inch
             Tons of other parts
              Front and rear factory sway bars for 914


I need to sell all of this stuff. Would like to find somebody that can take it
all or a major portion. In terms of price, don't know, I guess it depends on
how big your truck and trailer is. The more you buy, the cheaper.  Call me with
your ideas.

Call me at 513 372-8376 in the evenings, it's ok to call untill 1130 EST. Oh by
the way, the cars and parts are located near Dayton Ohio.

        70 or 71.  70 has carbs, not sure about 71--either Webers or MFI.
A very cherry example was sold in the SF Bay Area for 10K about 6 months
ago.  It was probably in better shape than the one you describe.
        In the Rust Belt, values *may* be higher--early 70's 911 (and
earlier) tend to rot out easily up there.

Subject: Broken-Off Screw


Well, I finally got around to trying to change the burned out foglight bulb 
on my '83 944.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the head of one of the 
screws holding the lens on was badly corroded, so I had to resort to 
drilling the head of the screw off.

That worked fine and I was able to remove the foglight and change the bulb. 
 I even got new factory screws to replace the old ones (since they were all 
starting to look kind of ratty).  I figured it would be a simple matter of 
using a pair of vice grips to remove the remains of the one screw that I had 
drilled the head off of.

WRONG!  The screw was in there good and tight.  No wonder I wasn't able to 
successfully use a screwdriver on it in the first place!  Anyhow, I managed 
to break the screw off flush with the surface into which it was screwed.

Now what?  Any ideas on how to get it out?

Muchos gracias for any advice from the list.

You should be able to get a T in 'streetable' shape for $6K or so (YMMV)
in Southern California.  Check out the 911 FAQ 
(ftp://ftp.tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs/911.faq) for further info on
these cars and for places to check for availablility.

Subject: foamy filler

I have seen cars with some kind of expanding foam filler in places where
there are small rust repairs to be done.  I was wondering if anyone is
familiar with such a substance, what it is best suited for, and where it
can be obtained.

I will be going over my '76 from head to toe and would like to defer small
rust repairs until this winter.  I want to prepare the areas to be worked
on with a wire-brush treatment and a sealer.  I was just wondering whether
or not this foam filler would be a good short-term solution to prevent water
entry on any exposed areas.

It's been awhile since I've given an update on Project 914: 

	a) engine rebuild is balanced, beautiful, and complete,
	    (many thanks to y'all for your help)

	b) picked up a yellow '76 chassis(former racer) complete with:
		front mount oil cooler plumbing,
		sway bars front and rear,
		gas adjustable konis(all corners),
		decent(albeit homebrew) paintjob,
		and no major structural rust. :)

The '76 has full black bumpers with fog lights(rectangular).  The current
wiring is half-assed and I'm surprised it ever passed inspection.  Therefore, 
if anyone has a decent harness around they'd like to get rid of let me know.
Otherwise, I'll be making on up myself.

The reader's digest version is that I'll have her on the road this summer.
Looking forward to the first drive.

	Get something called an easy-out... you drill a small hole in the

or you can do like I did with the door lock knob in my 911- drill a

I bought some of Wurth's Matte Black Lacquer Spray paint.  It seems to be
a great match for the factory shade of black - not too flat, not too glossy.
 I
have yet to actually paint my wheels, although I did paint one of my hub
caps.  It seems to be a really good match.  The thing slowing me down at the
moment (other than laziness) is that I'm not sure what is the best way to
mask my wheels (7x15s).  Masking off the wheel at the point where the black
stops is right on a curved portion of the wheel.  I am tempted (and would 
like some opinions here - hint, hint) to paint the wheel black all the way
down to within about 10mm of the lip.  This is how my 6x15s are painted
and, if nothing else, the would "match". 

>Any advice would be more than appreciated.

Yeah, uh, me too.

Masking the wheels at the right place is not impossible if you use a
fine tape at the line.  3M makes a fine line tape that works well.

Believe it or not, Orchard Supply's Satin Black isn't bad either.  Not
as authentic as Wurth's, but it's embarrassingly cheap.  I haven't put
my Fuchs wheels to hard use since painting them, but I've used the OSH
paint on the satin black area of one of my inside doors and on a set
of hubcaps.  Still, if I were doing the wheels again I'd use the real
thing!

I am having problems adjusting the shift linkage on my 914.  I was having
trouble getting into first and reverse.  No matter how hard I pulled left I
could not get it into reverse-first it would drop into secong and third.  So
I tried to adjust the linkage by disconnecting the linkage from the shifte
and moving it around but I did not know which way to move it.  Now after I
tightened it all I get is first and reverse.

I have a side shifter trans.  When I remove the linkage bolt am I suppose to
put the shifter into a certain gear or move/rotate the link a certain way?

MHO is that it's unlikely to be 83k and more likely to be 183k miles
unless it really looks great.  OTOH if it's not driven in the winter
it could  have relatively low miles.  OTO,OH if it's only driven
in summer why does it have rust bubbles?

Interpreting the signals on an old car reads rather like a mystery novel.  Be
prepared to run away fast. Even a few rust bubbles can mean more rust work
than the car is worth, and if it has a tired engine, it could easily need
twice what it's worth to keep it viable.  A few *visible* rust bubbles probably
means more rust somewhere and it doesn't take  much to make you wish you hadn't
been born (to use Stan's phrase).

Moral of the story:  Be very suspicious and assume there is bad news
to be found until you can prove there is none.

Have fun and good luck,

Hi Doug,

They just make new header tanks for both ends of the new larger intercooler.
I think that they have done quite a few, but I only really paid attention to
the one that they did for another friend who lives in Chicago. 

There are things that you can do to make these cars spool up more quickly,
besides the lag isn't as bad as it is on a 930.

Hey,

Just to dampen yours (or your friend's) spirits a little - I looked at a real
low mileage SC a few years ago.  I think it was an '80 model with about
26k miles on it.  I didn't buy it, but did see it one day in the pcar shop I
hang out in every once and while.  Seeing this very low mileage car in the
shop, I asked what was wrong with it - the mechanic replied "Five broken
head studs!".  It seems the car sat around for so long that the head studs
corroded and ended up breaking once the car was used on a daily basis 
again.

Did the '83s have the epoxy coated studs?  Maybe this would mitigate this
problem. It is probably safe to say, though, that extremely low mileage can
have its own set of problems just like extremely high mileage.

Sorry for playing the "devil's advocate"...

Thanks Mike- I needed to hear that.  When my mechanic told me I had a 
broken head stud, I began to wonder if someone had been fiddlin' with my 
odometer (only 41,100 miles)... but she sat for 13.5 years before she was 
driven regularly once again!  Ok, puzzle solved- for a while there I was 
afraid I'd been had.  
	Anybody got any suggestions on where or how to get a 
single head stud fixed?  So far I haven't had any trouble (my mechanic 
said I should be ok for a year or so until I start to lose oil, hear a 
'popping' sound from an exhaust leak, or notice a drop in power...)
Is this safe?

If you're in CA, or any other location with CARB style emissions
restrictions, there are none. Gotta keep the stock intake and exhaust,
and anything else you can do involves serious engine mods and even
more serious bucks.

If you can do it, then going to SSI exhaust and a reasonable low
restriction muffler will add 10-15 HP, and probably not cost more
than $1500 or so. If that doesn't fall in the "reasonable" range,
best get re-calibrated on what it takes to do things with this car.

Subject: Fire in my 87 Carrera

Guys,

I own an 87 911 Carrera. It has over 100K on it. LAst week my number 2 fuse 
blew and it was for the AC, booster fan ( what is this ??? ) and the 
electric seats. I replaced the fuse (25A) and let it idle for a while and 
noticed smoke rising from the front of the car. After some research, 5-6 
seconds, I noticed that it was from a unit, in front of the fuel tank and to 
the side of the battery. Fire was put out whithout any damage.

People tell me that this is the condenser fan for the AC unit. Is this 
normal behaviour on these cars ? I thought the condenser was mounted under 
the rear spoiler. My mechanic tells me that I can drive the car safely 
without it and even maybe run the AC still ! I have taken the unit off but 
it was badly burnt inside out. 

Should I replace this myself or get an expert to do this ? It was easy to 
get off but finding the part has been a problem. Noobody seems to know what 
it is exactly, and I have been quoted $310 to $55. MAybe I can find a used one.

Any help appreciated ...

Subject: 951 3 cylinder (bad fuel injector?)

Porschephiles - I need help before the next track event!

During my last run group at the track this past Monday, my aging 951 showed
all the symptoms of being a 3 cylinder engine.  Rough idle, skipping/missing
consistently at all RPMs. I limped it the 100 miles home, with no additional
problems.  

Someone at the track suggested that it might be a bad fuel injector, so my
next step will be to check if it runs no worse when I disconnect each of the
plug wires one at a time.  Does this sound like the correct way to determine
which (if any) is the bad injector, and how difficult is replacing one?  Any
other suggestions as to what the problem might be?

Here's other information that's pertinent:
 - Plugs checked, all OK.
 - Exhaust checked, no radiator fluid smell.
 - Radiator fluid level constant, no leaks. 
 - Added Techron and filled up at the Chevron station before heading home.
 - Engine ran at normal temperature for 100 miles after problem started.
 - Engine has 129K miles (first problem at the track yet!)
Thanks.

european models, except some passing references here and 
there.  One item, for instance, is the oil pressure gauges.
The author goes into alot of detail covering all of the
different oil pressure gauges used over the years.  The one
in my car isn't listed.  Mine is labelled "DRUCK" and the
scale is from 0 - 10.  The ventilation controls in my car
don't bear much resemblance to the pictures in the book
either.  Hmmmm.

When you melt a switch repeatedly like this, it's usually a sign you're

1983 911SC, 29K miles.  Asking 15K - South Florida

Thanks for the many replies to my previous posting.

We inspected the car this afternoon, and as usual, it was not as described.  

The first thing I checked was the seats, and they certainly looked like they
had more than 29K miles on them.  But the gauges were the give away.  The
speedometer was cleaner than the other gauges, the white lettering was
obviously not as aged as on the original gauges, so obviously it was replaced
29K miles ago.  How much mileage was put on the car before?  Apparently,
those complete books and records don't go back before 29K miles!.

The car was repainted, and the painter didn't bother to remove the front
fender to windshield frame gaskets ( I guess another 20 seconds of labor
would have been too much to ask for!).

The right rear fender had a small paint bubble, and it was obvious that the
car had some body work.

The A/C didn't work, and the sunroof had its probems opening.

The good stuff:

The car drove well.  The interior is OK (other than seats), and it doesn't
appear that the car was in any major accidents.  A few small oil leaks
(probably oil return tubes).

Some paint work is in order, but probably not a complete repaint.  

Tomorrow it gets checked out by a Porsche mechanic, but since my friend has
the resources to buy something newer, he'll probably pass on this one and
look for a 87+ Carrera.

The car is an '86 Carrera with about 70K miles on it.

Subject: Is a 911 right for me?

Hi all,

I'm a new member of the list (a couple of weeks) and need some help
deciding if an early '80s Porsche 911 coupe is the right thing for me. I
saw a similar question earlier (Yes, I've read the FAQs!)...but here's my
deal -

1. I live in Cambridge, MA. (In other words, it is winter most of the year)

2. I need a dependable daily driving car, I commute to work every day
(25-30 minutes one way) half highway half city driving.

3. But I want it to be a fun sports car. I have looked at the 3 gen RX7
(realized I can't afford it), BMW 635 csi, Miata, and also the 911.

4. I was going to borrow 11k and buy a '91 Miata (poor substitue), but
realized much to my delight, I could buy an early '80s Porsche 911 instead!

5. I'm young (23) and I work for a non-profit (City Year!) so I don't have
lots of money to burn.

6. I don't know THAT much about cars, but am good w/ my hands and read
voraciously, so am willing to learn and do as much on the car myself as
possible. ie- I have taken apart parts of cars, but not put all of the
parts back all the time.

7. I love the look of the Porsche 911, have read the FAQ about it, drooled
over the ones I've ridden in, but have never driven one. Unfortunately I
don't like the styling of the 924, 928 or 944, so its gotta be a 911.

Should I buy one? (Is it a daily/summer/winter car?)

Can I afford to keep one? (I'm a little nervous after reading about
cylinders, torson chains, rust, rebuilding engines and all the other
problems/chanllenges discussed.)

What should I look (out) for (in addition to the info in the 911 FAQ)?

Any suggestions or comments would be most appreciated. Send them to me
privately or to the list if appropriate.

Thanks a bunch,
Brian

Thanks Gerry, for this opportunity!  Below, I shall reveal all (read this to
the tune of "Alfie", "What's it all about, Bartie...?"):

You 133 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-members (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

The best way to mask Fuchs weels is to use a liquid mask available at auto
body (and even R/C model) shops.
First, paint the line with the liquid mask, and let it dry.  Don't paint too
much past the paint edge, toward the center.
Then run an Exacto knife around the edge, exactly on the paint edge.
Remove the mask on the paint-side of the edge.
Use masking tape and paper to mask the rest of the wheel.
Paint - If using a spray can, warm to about 100 degrees in water.
If painting with gloss, it's probably a good idea to cut the paint at the
seam with an Exacto knife, before removing the mask.
If you have a steady hand, this will leave a factory-clean seam!

Subject: Broken Screw

Regarding small broken screws, sometimes it works to file the broken screw 
flush with the part.  Then center punch, drill and tap to the original size 
as though the broken screw were virgin metal.  If you are lucky either the 
scew will turn out after relieving the internal stress by drilling it, or 
the tap will follow the original threads.  You could also end up with a mess 
in which case you should drill it oversize, fill it with epoxy, grease the 
threads of the screw and let the epoxy set around the screw.  Because it is 
greased, you should be able to turn it out again.  Just some things that 
have worked for me if the gods looked upon me favorably and the moon and 
planets were in line at the time.

Subject: Refinishing Fuchs Wheels

Dear Mike, Steve et Al:

1. The actual match for the OEM Fuchs Alloy black is the Wurth Gloss Black
Wheel Paint, and the match for the clear coat is Wurth Gloss Clear.  If you
are repainting all four wheels this is probably the best combo to use.  The
paints are specifically formulated to withstand the high temperature environme
nt of wheels.  

2. If you are repainting only one or two wheels and if the black on the
existing wheels had faded, then Wurth Matt Black with clear coat may match.
 Try using 3M Imperial Hand Glaze on the faded wheels, you may be surprised
to find out how much you can improve their appearance. If 3M alone does not
quite do the trick, try adding a little Blue Magic to the 3M and polish out
the existing paint.    

3. A trick for masking wheels or other compound curves, is to use the thin 3M
self adhesive masking (not scotch) tape to define the line.  The thin paper
will deform relatively easily and require less trimming with a razor blade.
 Once you have the tape in place, warm (not heat)  it with a hair dryer as
you press it down.  Try overlaying the tape with another layer of tape to
make removal easier.  Leave a 1/64 " gap between the two layers of masking
tape.  Make sure that the edge of the tape that defines the paint line is
firmly in contact with the wheel. Take your time in this phase.  Cover the
rest of the wheel with paper, including the outside and inside.  Paint will
get into everyting so mask carefully.  An hour spent at this stage will pay
big dividends.  One of the tricks to spray painting is to start the spray off
of the area to be painted.  When first starting a spray of paint, there will
be spatters that will mar your work.  Start off the work surface and move the
spray onto the work and in one smooth motion, sweep across the surface and
past.  Move down for the next path (still keeping the spray going) and move
back onto the work, continue across moving in a smooth motion till you are
off the work on the other side.  Move down and continue the off - on -off
 -down off - on -off motions.  Maintain the spray at a 90 degree angle to the
surface to be painted.  Don't tilt the spray can or gun. 

4. The key to a good looking finish on a wheel or any painting project is
preparation.  You should spend 90% of your time in prep and 10% of your time
painting.  Many people reverse the percentages and wind up with dismal
results.   If the existing black paint is in good condition, other than faded
and the polished/clear coated areas are in excellent shape,  you may get away
with only repainting the black areas.  Slightly rough up the painted area
 with a 1200 grit sandpaper.  Clean down with an organic solvent such as
Wurth Citrus Degreaser and then mask.  You are ready to paint, see #6. 

5. If the wheels have areas that are chipped through the clear coat/black
coat or the polished areas are cloudy or discolored, then you may want to
consider removing all the existing paint.  The best way I have found to
remove the existing paint is plastic media  blasting.  This will remove all
of the paint and leave the surface ready for polishing.  Polish the wheels
using a cloth wheel or you may be able to hand polish them.  Clean them down
thoroughly with an organic solvent such as Wurth Citrus Degreaser and mask.  

6. Hang the wheels with a washer that is just slightly larger than the
diameter of the stud hole (large enough to not fit through the hole but small
enough to fit deep into the stud depression.  Run a wire around the washer
and place in the stud depression.  Hang the wheel at chest level.  Try to do
all four wheels at the same time.  Clean just prior to painting with a Prep
Sol type of cleaner.  Spray a coat of quality primer such as Wurth Rustop
Primer on the areas to be painted (NOT the clear coated areas), allow to dry
and then paint the black areas with several light coats.  This is important,
as the Wurth Paints don't like to be applied in one or two heavy coats.  They
will give the best results with numerous (I apply 8+) thin coats.  Allow each
coat to dry about an hour before applying the next coat.  When the black is
finished and had dried for 48 hours, remove the tape.

7.  If you have not stripped off the existing clear coat from the polished
areas, then do NOT try to repolish these areas.  See #9.

8. Carefully hand re-polish any areas that need it.  If you use a machine,
you may mar the new paint. 

9. Lightly sand the painted areas that are to be clear coated with 2000 grit
sand paper to slightly rough up the surface and allow the new paint better
adhere.   Do not sand non clear coated polished areas.  Clean all the areas
to be clear coated with a Prep Sol type of product and apply several light
coats of Wurth Clear Wheel Paint. Allow to dry for an hour between coats.

 If you have taken you time, you should be pleased with the results.

If anyone wants more information on the details of refinishing wheels, or
can't find the Wurth, 3M or Blue Magic Products locally, please give me a
shout.

Hi Hubert 

hate to say it but your probably shafted mate

all my lights have the same malaise, whenever a bulb goes I have the same 
trouble, whats worse, is the screws holding the body into the front are 
also corroded, and you can't get in to drill those screws out.

I have also got the same trouble with the trim plastic around the driving

They probably don't have this trouble in LA!!

Subject: Re: Recommend a good jack?

Hi Scott,

I'm kind of a nut on garage equipment.  I insist that you only buy it once.

On floor jacks my preference in the Walker jack 1 1/2 ton model, any year.

The Blue walker jack is now sold as a Lincoln jack through your auto 
parts store.  It's not cheap.  Originally the jack was manufactured as an 
A-Jax jack and was painted light green.  The jack line was bought by the 
Walker Muffler Co. and painted blue with a yellow handle.  I think that 
Lincoln has maintained that color scheme.  Heres the reasons:

1.  There are a lot of these jacks.  They have been a professional garage 
favorite since I can remember.

2.  Many of the parts are interchangable.  Yes if you need a cast iron 
wheel for a 1960 model a 1995 model will replace it.  Just like some 
Porsche parts.

3.  The hydraulic pump is external.  A New one can be bought from  
Lincoln and screwed into your 1970 model and the pump works like new.  
Parts are available.  I use a mid '60s model and have put brass bushings 
in a lot of the worn pivot holes and have jack that is better than new.  
If I wear out a bushing I just replace it not the jack.  The other jacks 
I have looked at have their pump made internal in the casting base.  If 
it wears out the jack is worthless.  Hein-Warner, Blackhawk, Import etc.

4.  The 1 1/2 has the largest lifting range and it goes the lowest of the 
entire jack line.

    Sure, you can just tighten them. Just pop off the dust cap on your
front rotor (well, hub, actually, if you ave a 911...)  There will be a
big nut that you just tighten up until you've taken all the play out of
the bearings (no tighter!)  A warning - it will either have an allen
setscrew (like my 914) or else a cotter pit through the bolt that must
be removed/loosened as the case may be before you can adjust this nut (I
think it's pretty obvious why...)

> 
> I intend to fix it myself but have only one project* under my belt so

    If you've done a clutch, this will be a piece of cake.  I repacked
my bearings in my 914 in about 2 hrs.
    If the thought that your bearings have loosened make you nervous (I
don't take any chances with mine) you may want to clean them out and
repack them.  Just remove the aforementioned nut, pull the hub off the
spindle, and everything will come right off.  You may have to use a
small prybar to pop the grease seal out.  Just soak the bearings in
gasoline, let them dry well, and then squish more grease in the bearing
COMPLETELY.  this is a pain to do by hand, but I don't have the litle
tool that fits on your grease gon, and I don't do bearings that often. 
Then scoop out most of the old goo from the hub and put the new stuff in
there, too.  build up a little wedge of grease in he hub behind where
each bearing will sit, to try to keep the grease in them longer.
    After this, just reassemble everything the way it was, making sure
to put  a thin film of grease on the grease seal before assembling.
    If you want new bearings, they're not that hard, either.  Just drive
out the races with a brass punch, and the new ones in the same way. 
Just keep working around the perimeter as you go to keep from cocking
the races.  Don't ever mix bearing/race sets!

No, everything is original configuration, though a couple items, like
cruise control and headlight washers, haven't worked for quite some time. 
The Weissachs came with all options, which, while it doesn't make for a

Is your chassis pre '73? If so, your outboard engine mounts may be the 
rubber pre '73 version and your side shifter engine/transmission will be 
riding too low in the car, causing the shift rod to bind, resulting in 
aforementioned problem.

When I removed mine I found the only thing that ended up working was a 
torch. I virtually burned them out. You light them on fire, let them burn 
for five or so minutes, blow them out and they should just pop out with 
vise-grips.

This method does, however, render them somewhat unuseable.

There is also a condenser under the front spoiler, which this fan blows
air over.  I just had mine replaced in my '80 SC, so I knows.  Cost me
$370 at the dealer, but I was in a hurry for a trip with my girlfriend (SO
for the new, hip & politically correct), and wanted to avoid the ensuing
battle over 'this damn Porsche' (it happened anyway).  Looked in Kempton
Bros. (don't do it, find another), and it was $200.  It's easy to replace,
bolts on and off, plug in the connector.  Unless it's really cheap, don't
go used.  I think the fan uses the same bearings as in the heater blower
motor in the engine compartment - can you say "planned obsolescence"?

Subject: 968 BRAKE NOISE

I have heard that p-cars tend to have brake noise and I have had my brakes
checked twice by the dealer who say's that my brakes are fine.  The problem is
that they squeel when the car is just rolling down the road not when I apply
or release them.  In my experience with other brakes is that they seem to
squeel only when applied or released.  Is this behavior really normal for
p-cars or should I insist that the dealer take them apart and apply brake quit
or lub to the back of the pads?  Could this be a sticking calipier or air in
the system?  The problem comes and goes as it has since new (seems to be the
right front only but I am not sure it always is) Also not as loud now as it
was.  Washing the rotors seems to help for a while which seems to say brake
dust is the problem? Also if I brake really hard for a while it tends to get
better.  Since I don't need to use the brakes to much at legal road speeds
with all that wonderful cornering ability <VBG> do I need to exercise them
more?  I want to get this resolved before my factor warrenty expires at the
end of May :-(  Will this slight squeel wear the rotors out faster?  And why
do the rotors rust so much after every car washing?  Any thoughts would be
appreciated.

more experience with 944 Ts, agreed that acceleration was not what it
should be and that the exhaust was sooty and smelled of sulpher. He
suspects the catalytic converter, one of the engine management systems or
the turbo (lack of boost, the dash indicated 1.8 bar) is at fault. The
Turbo has just been replaced under my 1 yr pre-owned Porsche warranty. The
dealer is starting to piss me off because they seem to be of the opinion
that since their instruments indicate no problems that there are none. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on this  ?

Thanks in advance.

Several years ago, GGR had a tech session conducted by Rick Bauers at
Carlson Porsche in Palo Alto, CA. He spent about an hour and a half
demonstrating, once you remove the door panel, how easy it is to adjust the
metal window frame on the door. By adjusting the screws on the portion of
the frame in the door, it can be moved in/out relative to the body of the
car and up/down - front/back relative to the Targa or Cab top. With these
adjustments, most leaks around the door can be eliminated. He also handed
out copies of the section from the shop manual that illustrated and
described these adjustments. Unfortunately, I have misplaced my copy. Good
luck on those leaks!

        The tranny end bolts to one of the studs that holds the front cover

They are probebly just a bit loose and can be tightened.
Here is something I posted a while back.

I've never had any luck with the procedure in the Haynes manual (which
I believe was taken out of the Porsche factory manual). If you leave
them slightly loose like Haynes says (able to move the washer under gentle
side force from a screwdriver), they will loosen up more and become way too
loose ("way" is a scientific term, because I am a scientist).

So I tighten them enough so that it takes some force to move the washer,
and the bearings will stay tight for years. There may still be a slight bit
of slop by shaking the top of the wheels, this is normal. But it should
not be much.

While you are in there, it's good to re-grease the outer bearing with
some nice Swepco or other high quality grease. But it's messy!

Good Luck, Mike Piera  '72 911S, '73 914/2.0 (?)

I had a wheel straightened at the wheel collision center in Bath PA (they
advertise in R&T, etc.). came back very straight, and required little or no
weights when I got the wheel/tire balanced. The ding was on the inside rim,
so refinishing was uneccessary.

In my experience, a tech inspector who's out to show his stuff may

Mike,
If there is any play at all in the the bearings, won't that cause really high
loads during transitions from left to right or vice versa turns?  I tighten
mine by hand till there is no play at all and have experienced no adverse
effects.  I do have a 944 though which may be different and may not have
enough miles since the adjustment to have experienced any ill effects.

the same Wilmington, NC dealer (University Porsche/Audi) as my '77 924 
(!) evidenced by original owners manual/service book, passes rust 
inspection (not even the battery box!).  
	It's a '76 914 2.0, made in 2/76 with 138K (high?) miles and 22K 
on totally worked over engine (w/reciepts + records for past 8 years) 
with euro pistons but all else stock.  Also had a Bursch exhaust system 
and clutch installed at that time.  Owner says engine untouched before 
that (?).  It's has ORIGINAL silver paint, a bit faded in some spots but 
no rust or accident damage.  Owner bought it with 95K and used as a 
"weekend car" for eight years.  He owns a METICULOUS '85 Mercedes 300SDL 
and a likewise '90 BMW 850i.  He is not sure if he wants to part with it 
to a couple of "young 'uns" like us (?) but we assured him we'd take good 
care of it and pointed to my well kept '77 924 as an example.  This 
satisfied him and agreed to sell it to us :^)
	The price? "$4900 and not a penny less."  My brother is going to

Heater control cable maladjusted - easy fix. Adjust the cable, be cool.
Heater control cable broken - slightly painful, replace, adjust, be cool.

Are you saying that the car is a '72 with a '74 drive train? If the VIN # 
starts with "472...." then the chassis is a '72 (BTW engine codes would 
start with "EC" or "GA" in '74). If so, it is easy to check the engine 
mounts. The '74 outboard engine mounts are solid steel ie, not flexible, and 
the flexible portion is inboard, under the engine itself, pre '73 the 
outboard mounts are rubber, ie. flexible.
Good luck.

Ah yes, nothing like a tiny, unglamorous part to cause a public,
unglamorous problem (toll collector saying "I believe your
trunk's open, sir...").  On my car this was caused by the female catch
getting worn and rounded.  Unbolt it from the body and check it out, a
few minutes at the grinder and you'll be good as new again.  The male
part screws in and out to adjust the "tightness" when latched, adjust it
so it latches reliably but the lid has no free play against its rubber
stops.

Hi all!

Last time, and the first time, that I adjusted my valves, I did not

is. The only problem was the uncomfortable clearance of the car (floor to 
underside of car)...
now, before you all start to chuckle by yourselves at the terminal

I thought about putting the car on jackstands, but this is where the problem

my floorboard or do other major damage. In fact, I don't even want to scratch
the undercoating! And of course, I don't want to be wearing an engine

I would try this first before tearing latch apart. Back out the top

may solve the prob. Also sometimes a quarter of turn will solve the 
problem as you will get different wear points.

Mine did the same thing awhile back turned out to be the cable adj as 
the latch was not closing all way. I don't know how the cable got out

Good idea.  I guess the point I was trying to make is that I don't think my

very little about the little idiosyncracies associated with the Euro stuff.

I think the book is great.  I learned alot just flipping through it once.

the factory!

>BTW, "druck" is the German word for "pressure".

Yeah, I knew this, is was just that in some of the pictures in his book
it shows the gauges with "PRESS" and "DRUCK" on the same gauge and
goes on to say that it was done this way "just like the European cars".

The windshield on my 928 is pock-marked, probably from wind-borne sand.

Generally invisible, this damage rears its head when driving into a low sun, 
severely limiting visibility.

Given the outrageous price of replacements, has anyone had experience of 
windshield repolishing?  There s a firm that offers this service here in the 
San Diego area, but I m somewhat hesitant about entrusting my baby to their

Speaking of windshield polishing. Is there some compound you can buy to 
do it yourself? And is it practical to do it by hand?
 
I don't know if this is common, but I notice fine abrasion marks or
scratches at the extreme reaches of the wipers on my 944 (where most of
the dirt is left on each sweep).  Its worst at the lower right on the
passenger side. No matter how clean I try to keep the windshield before a
rain, I notice more and more of these scratches. This really bugs me at
dawn/dusk. 
 
I recall seeing a post recently about soft Porsche windshields and how 
Bosche wipers are harsh on the glass? Is this true?

Subject: Should front brakes lock up first or rear ?

Hi all,
This weekend I'll disassemble my front calipers and will attempt to
"rebuild" them, that is to clean the pistons and reinstall with new 
original seals, dirt scraper rings, spring plates, and factory 
rubber brake hose. (I already have new factory pads, and new rotors
are on order from Vertex, who are selling "original German" 930 
rotors for $125 ea).

Hopefully this will give me the great braking performance that
Porsches are supposedly known for (but which I haven't experienced
yet). Could someone tell me what I should expect from properly 
functioning, well adjusted brakes. If I find a totally deserted 
standard asphalt road, and slam on the brakes while driving at 40 
mph, should I hear screeching tire noises ? Examining the road,
should I see tire marks front and back, front only, or rear only ?

(I have new BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires, standard size of 205 in front
and 225 in back).

I looked at the owners' manual, but it doesn't list the expected
stopping distance. I know that I am currently far from ideal, but
how do I know when my brake job is as good as it is going to get ?

I am also considering replacing my brake booster with the '85 version
which is supposed to have a better boost ratio. Any opinions on that?
According to the factory service manual it should be possible. TIA

138K on a 19-year-old car is really not much at all--slightly over 7K
per year!  22K on rebuild would tell me that the original engine had a
long life, which bodes well for the rebuild.  Original paint--that
would impress me more than anything else.

Invariably there are some components that just get tired, which given
the car's age is, well, a given.  But they can be replaced and
upgraded at the same time.  I'd grab it.

Subject: How much Vacuum should a healthy 930 engine have ?

While working on my brakes, I bought a Mityvac gauge and connected
it to the brake booster line. I was also reading the little manual
that came with the Mityvac, and it claimed that a healthy engine
should have between 16 and 22 ". Well my engine has substantially 
less vacuum at this location, and I read all the factory manuals and
spec books and haven't found any indication about how much vacuum
is expected. Should I be alarmed ? Should I look for a vacuum leak ?
(I made this measurement with the intentional vacuum leak to the
charcoal canister plugged).

Speaking of the charcoal canister, I asked several times and still
don't know: On a straight US or non-converted euro 930, where does
the fuel tank vent hose actually go ? Mine goes to a BMW charcoal 
canister which just sits in the trunk, and from there a hose connects
to the brake booster vacuum line (for continuous purging, as I learnt
from rading the Haynes Emission Control Equipment book). But I am 
very curious to know what the layout of my fuel tank vent hose was
before it got modified by the original importers. Could this be the
question that actually stumped the net wisdom ? Or is this so boring
that everyone has already proceeded to the next topic. Maybe I'll 
think of something to spark some flames or discussion, like
what do you all think of the new 911 Turbo that is on all the 
magazine covers now ? Could it be considered a worthy replacement 
for the 959 ? Ooops. Backtrack, please. Anyone know anything about
vacuum or vent hoses ? Too late. Everyone's thinking of the turbo 
already. Oh well. Ray

You didn't by any chance push the trip odometer reset buton while you were
moving?  This has been known to cause instant spedo death in 924's as well as
other non-Porsche cars.  I also take it that uou have determined tha it is
not the cable or in later models cables or EGR box.  The culprit is the small
plastic gears inside.  This can be fixed, however it requires disassembly of
the unit.  i.e. Not something you wnat to do if this frightens you.  The
easier (read CHEAPER) way is to buy a repalcement from a VDO dealer (Tweeks,
Automotion etc...) or to get a used one from a dismantler (Kempton, etc.).
 Many sources can be found in Excellence magazine and sometiome European car.
 Fixing your speedo is an option, but speedo shops are going the the way of
leaded gas.  If you are interested in fixing it yourself, email me and I will
give you a rundown on how to get the unit out and open safely.

I basically used brute force to get mine out.  I drilled a hole through a large piece of
3/8 inch thick steel plate, put one end of the trailing arm "center rod" through the hole
and bolted it down tight.  I clamped the steel plate tightly to my workbench so that
the trailing arm hung downward.  Then I grabbed the trailing arm and pulled downward
while twisting it from side to side.  It is hard work, the rod moves slowly, but it will come out.
Using the silicone pre-lube grease on the new bushings will not only prevent squeaking,
but also help them slide in much easier.

	Yup, Saratoga made a glass roof for 924/944s but I don't about  
the power sunroof models.  They were known to squeak though, the stock

The language in the Porsche house organ "Christophorus" often makes amusing
reading.  For those of you who still believe that Porsches are made by Elves
in the Black Forest, or at least  "old world" Craftsman, Porsche's CEO, Dr.
Wendelin Wiedeking apparently confirmed the extraordinary nature of the
workforce in today's climate of participative management..

In the March 95 edition reporting on his speech to the stockholder's General
Meeting in Stuttgart, he was commenting on the turnaround and anticipated
balanced result for the 94/95 business year, stating "the only recognized
constant factor is change". Furthermore: "we are not currently pursuing any
program for humanizing the workplace. We require sacrifices of ourselves and
our colleagues."

Sounds strangely like the radio broadcasts and shortwave exhortations from

Yup, there sure is!  Eastwood Co. at (800) 345-1178 offers a "Pro Glass
Polishing Kit" for $32.95 (my catalog is dated so the price my be higher)
it was item # 1917. It is designed to remove scratches that can't be caught
with your fingernail. It includes a glass polishing wheel that fits a 
drill or slow speed polisher 1500 rpm (recommended). It comes with 
enough compound (1 lb) to do 50 jobs.

They also offer a kit to clear up scratched windshields. Item # 1919,
$19.95. Kit includes polishing wheel, mandrel, glass marking pencil,
sponge, as well as 6 ounces of compound (enough for the average car).

I haven't used either method but if you do try it let me know how it goes
because I have a windshield that is in desperate need of polishing.

Hope this helps.

not have enough miles since the adjustment to have experienced any ill 
effects. 
 

you have two choises here, a small amount of pad knock off, or a sheared
stub axle
 
I believe that it is better to have them loose rather than tight - from 
experience, I have had 2 instances where the bearings were too tight, and 
this caused the outside bearing to seize.

when this happens, the stub axle shears, and the wheel falls off - well 
it attempts to, but the disk caliper stops it. In both cases this has 
bent the caliper mounting.

I am not talking about the nut being spannered down hard, I mean that 
there has still been a small amount of free play.

My advise is make sure the but can turn freely on the stub axle, tighten
down by hand, spin the wheel a few times, attempt to rock it , spin it a
few more times, take up any more free play, spin the wheel again and take 
up any more free play, then back the nut off by 32-30 degrees and tighten 
the lock screw/insert a split pin etc.

I doubt they are.  Software embedded in microcontrollers may have a copyright
sticker on the ROMs, but I've never seen it licensed, since you don't buy the
software, you buy the device.  I think licensing & reproduction issues are
pretty much up to the manufacturer of the device to determine.  And since there
are companies making aftermarket chips for everything from Porsches to Ford
Probes, I think it might be difficult for a company to start cracking down on
chip makers.  UNLESS, of course, they *do* start licensing the ROMs, and making
the original buyer sign a licensing agreement.

That's a strange size. The best wheel/tire combo for an SC or Carrera
is 7 and 8 by 15" wheels with 225/50 and 245/50/15 tires. For your
street tires, try 36 PSI front and 40 PSI rear, as they need high
pressures for autocross. The BFG autocross tires work well at about
10 PSI less than this.

Don't lift! Your car will actually understeer both under power and 
braking. Lift throttle oversteer is not a "bug" it's a "feature" ;-) 
(Sorry, I'm a s/w geek) Use LTO to your advantage.

I run my '72 911S with an empty (not quite!) fuel tank, but with the
spare in front to add a bit of weight. The extra fuel weighs too much
in my light car with low torque. But in a heavier (especially in the rear)
SC with more torque, you may want to try a full tank after taking a few
runs with a near-empty tank. If you are faster, stick with it!

  Hey P-filers,

  This is an update on Nevada State Senate bill SB-133, that proposed
  to repeal speed limits on rural highways (i.e. just about the entire
  state).

  Well, our lawmakers balked at the thought of losing $110 million in
  federal highway funds, so they removed the repeal. What remained is
  that the maximum fine for speeds over 70 mph is $100, and no insurance
  companies are notified if the fine is paid on time. Furthermore, the
  transportation committee discussed reconsidering a speed limit repeal
  if the national speed limit is repealed, which a US Senate committee just
  voted on. So, perhaps in the not too distant future, you will be able to
  drive your Porsche fast on the Silver State's 'autobahns' and save your
  greenbacks for gas and maintenance. I guess PCNA knew what they were
  doing when they located here.

  On a related note, I propose that State Senator O.C. Lee, D-Las Vegas
  be given the T*d-of-the-month award for his remarks in wanting assurance
  that the same amount of money will be raised under the new fine schedule.
  To me, there is something fundamentally wrong with a method for

Subject: '59A Restoration Report

356ers,

Some may recall that I purchased a yellow '59A coupe that Ted Smith had
reported on in pphiles about 6 months ago and I thought a update was in
order.

Recently I stripped the car of all external and interior parts and sent it on
its way for body work and painting.  I am excited to report that it is now
back in orginal Porsche silver form and looks absolutely gorgeous.

The car was remarkably rust free.  That is not to say there was no rust but
it was very minimal.  In fact, even the battery box required only a very
small repair.  The jack points were rusted out and replaced and a couple
other small areas.  The doors were very solid, especially the bottoms.  A
small amount of surface rust was repaired on the outside bottom of each door.
 Where filler was required my guys used an aluminized bondo called "Al
Metal."  More expensive and harder to work than bondo, I'm told it is as good
or better than lead.

The car was blocked out extensively and several times with most all of the
yellow repaint removed down to bare metal.

Repainted with Glasurit Silver per the original cardex, the paint is
absolutely beautiful and really highlights the special curves of the T-2
coupe.

I must admit that I didn't check the car out as thoroughly as I really should
have when I bought it but Ted had done a good job and I lucked out.  Thanks
Ted.

I will put the car back together and then have the interior redone.  I am
aiming for a street "concourse" driver.  I looking for :1 cherry shine up

Even a marginal brake system should be able to lock up all four
wheels. This won't stop you as quickly as not-quite-locking-up
all four wheels - for "normal tires" about a 5% slip ratio will
give maximum stopping performance. 4-channel ABS accomplishes a similar
(but not quite as good, in dry conditions) effect by easing off each
brake when that wheel starts to lock up. 

The problem of setting the brake bias is kinda tricky. The exact
optimal bias depends on traction, roadway camber and slope. So
you basically need a slightly different bias for every corner.
The reason for this is that weight transfer front-to-rear is
affected by braking effectiveness, and braking effectiveness is
affected by weight transfer. The more braking force available, the
more weight is transferred to the fronts, which gives the fronts more 
traction and the rears less. If you set up the bias perfectly for
a given surface, if you then try to stop on a surface with less
traction, the fronts will lock up way too soon, and on a surface
with more traction, the rears will lock up way too soon. This is
why, in classes that allow it, racers have cockpit adjustable brake
bias adjusters.

You also asked which should lock up first - the rears or the fronts.
The answer to this depends on your stability requirements. Most folks
want to be able to ease off the pedal and have things go right back
to the way it was before lockup. If you are in a turn and the fronts
lock up, you loose some front-end traction - understeer
is the usual result. Easing off the brake brings the front back
in. You may still be going too fast for the turn, but you didn't spin.
Start your braking sooner next time! If, on the other hand, your rears
lock up first, you loose rear end traction - the back is coming around!
Easing off the brakes (by itself) is unlikely to save it.
If, however, all your braking is accomplished in a straight line, having
the fronts lock up decreases the ultimate stopping force available
(due to the weight transfer, the fronts provide the most braking force),
while having the rears lock up doesn't have as much effect.

To be less equivocal about it, adjust the bias so that the fronts lock
up "just a little" before the rears for normal (dry) driving conditions. Most
of us go around corners sometimes, and you never know when you'll need
to panic stop. And if it rains, the fronts will still lock up first, so
you will still get understeer instead of oversteer.

>Ray Khorram

Ray,

With street compound brake pads (ones that will work well when cold), you
should be able to lock up all 4 wheels at 40 mph.  You will also flat spot
your tires, so don't do this unless you like a constant thumping sound 8{).
 As far as which end should lock first, you always want the front wheels to
lock first.  That way the car will continue to go straight.  I hope this is a
universally accepted fact amoungst you autophiles, but if anyone doubts it,
ask yourself why the auto maufacturers first put anti-lock brakes on the back
of cars.

The problem that I have with what you are saying is the"slamming on the
brakes" part.  You can induce rear wheel locking (on a car that normally
would not) by slamming on the brakes, and violently pitching all of the car's
weight to the front.  On all of the cars that I setup with adjustable brake
bias,  I set them so that a smooth initial press on the brakes, with
increasing pressure will lock the fronts first, and then a little more will lo
ck the backs.  This will produce the most effective use of both front and
rear brakes, and therefore the shortest stopping distances.  Depending upon
use, I may "back off on the rears a little" just to make sure they won't lock
if the brake is hit a little more quickly.

Most street cars are set so that the average driver can jump on the brakes,
and not lock the rears.  This means that under smooth track braking, the
rears will be doing very little.  That is why most trackers/racers add some
bias to the rears; to get more braking effect out of them.  Just be careful
not to go too far.

Ray-

The fronts should lock first.  Your suggested test,
drive on flat dry pavement at about 30, hit the brakes
hard, should cause a skid and you should be able to see
if the fronts have indeed locked up first by the marks on
the road.

However, I wouldn't do this with new pads.  You should break them in first, with gentle
brake applications for a bit.  I'm bot sure how much
a 'bit' is, but I'd do it for a 100 miles or so before
I slammed them on.  Also, when you do the test, you might 
want to warm the brakes a bit first by applying them a 
few times.  If you do it first thing in the morning, right
out of the garage, you may not get representative results.

Fellow Philers.

I just lucked into two tickets to Indy, and need some advice.

Is anyone aware of any hotels in Cincinnati that offer shuttle service to
and from the track at Indy?

The reason for Cincinnati is that Delta is (by far) the lowest air fare,
and their hub is Cinci. Also, due to our late scheduling, we can't get
into/out of, Indianapolis on either Saturday, Sunday or Monday. At least
not by air.

It looks like Cinci would be a piece of cake. It's only a hundred or so
miles out of Indy and even if I end up renting a car, the commute doesn't
look all that bad.

Anyone with any first hand knowledge please advise ASAP.

So YOU strongly disagree with what I have written. Lean closely to the screen
and read this:

IF you have to make a choise on which end of the car should lock-up first
(ie. no ABS) it should be the front.  That way the car will go straight.  You
can verify this with an inclined plane, and a toy car.  Try to get it to
slide down the plane with the rear wheels locked.  You'll see what
happens...it spins out.  This happens in the real world too.  So much for
your  premise about steering control.  I personally would rather lose
steering control, and go straight, than lose car control and spin off rear
end first!  THAT is why the manufacturers started with anti-lock brakes on
the rear first...so it wouldn't lock up!!  Obviously, then, the front would
ALWAYS lock first. Once they figured out how to get anti-lock on both ends,
they did.  ALSO carefully read the other two letters concerning this subject,
they say the same thing as I did.


Stick to commentary on what you know...whatever THAT may be.

Attention all porschephephilers within reasonable driving distance of Boston!

This Sunday, May 7, will be the PCA/NER's first autocross of the 1995 
season.  We are once again planning a five event series which is again 
sponsored by European Performance Engineering.  NER autocross events are 
very well organized and we almost always get 6 runs per driver.  All PCA 
members are welcome and may drive any type of car which passes tech.  
Non-members may also participate but they may only drive a Porsche.

We run up to twelve classes, class 12 being for all non-Porsche's.  If 
you're not sure what class you'd belong in, no worry, we'll let you know 
when you get there.  Trophies are awarded for each class based upon the 
number of entries in the class (based on the PCR's).  We also have a novice 
award for the fastest participant in each class who has never previously won 
a trophy.  The rules of the event are modified PCR's.

We welcome drivers of all skill level.  We have instructors for those who 
would like one.  Newcomers are especially welcome!


   When:      Sunday, May 7th, 1995

   Where:     Bayside Exposition Center
              (about 5 minutes south of Boston)

   Schedule:  Registration opens at 9AM.

I believe that the anti-lock brake arguements, either for front or rears
locking first, only confuses the issue.


Looking at either street driven or race cars without antilock brakes, I don't
believe you will find many (if any) proponents for having the rear lock first.
The issue is directional stability. If the fronts lock, the car keeps going in
basicly the direction it was going. This may not be what you wanted, but it
is at least  reasonably stable and controlable. If the back wheels lock,
especially on a low polar moment car like a 914, the car can swap ends
virtually instantaneously (don't ask me how I know-). A good reference on
the subject is Caroll Smith (sic?), in the Prepare to Win series.
Alternatively, survey some fast race drivers (like Larry, or any of many 
others in this group).

By the way, the intent is to have the fronts barely lock first under the
appropriate degree of front/rear weight transfer. Thus you need to reconsider
brake balance on different surfaces (like wet pavement), and when you make
changes that would influence weight transfer (like significant lowering).

Most street cars from the factory have substantial front brake bias (i.e.
the fronts lock way before the rears), for just this reason. The designers
want to make sure that the fronts lock first under virtually any set of
conditions. With most Porsches, you can considerably increase the brake
bias to the rear, allowing the rear brakes and tires to share a larger
fraction of the braking (but still nowhere near 1/2) relative to the
factory setting, for track use. This is particularly easy in the 914,
where there is an adjustable rear brake bias regulator. However, keep
in mind that you are dialing out margin for unusual conditions.

Hi, Frank,

I never forgot your asking about the problems I'm hearing about with the 
valve train and camshafts with the 16 valve 944S and 944S2 motors...

So, I'm starting to construct, via circumstantial evidence (kind of  like
the OJ trial) what's going on in their that could cost you a dollar or two.
I had a chat with PCNA's technical support guy (Brad), kind of questioning 
about the availability of the ramps on the camshaft chain tensioner.

Seems that the ramps are "good for the life of the engine" unless there has 
been a "prior valve-train event".

Bottom line, if you have had a cam belt failure with valve to piston contact
(!) or have over-revved the motor (!), you might see a failure with the
tensioner and/or ramps.  This will usually result in additional cost (!)

BTW, evidently, there is no similar problem with the 968 (Variocam)
valvetrain.

I would suggest checking the ramps on an annual basis, and replacing the
entire chain tensioner when you see impending failure of the ramps...

Jerry, 

Thanks for your reply.

I just came from my local dealer. He just tested for exhaust backpresure by
attaching a vacuum guage at the CO test tube by the battery. He found no
back pressure and beleives that I have no problems. I'm still not sure. I
ran a test that I found in Tech Notes from Excellence (1 or 2 years old)
that was suggested by a chip maker. It involves accelerating at full
throttle from 2500 rpm in 3rd gear. You start the clock as you reach 4000
and stop at 6000. I got repeatable readings of 6.2 seconds which is what
the regular turbo is supposed to get. I'm not sure what the Turbo S time is
supposed to be but it must be signifigantly less than that. I'm also
getting only 16 miles per US gallon driving half city half highway with no
stop and go driving. Something must be wrong but I have no idea what. Any
other thoughts ?

Funny... exactly the same thing can happen in a 914 if your throttle

This is not a matter of opinion. The front brakes must lock first, otherwise
the car will spin - physics is not a matter of opinion.

Here in Denmark, you will get the car rejected at an inspection if the 
rear brakes locks first.

Is this why Ford in Europe only put anti-lock brakes on the rear wheels on

Come on Tracy, you are being pedantic!

. Larry is absolutely right. 

While we may not wish to lock up the wheels at all, the likelihood is very
great that, on the track at least, we will; given that the objective is to
drive just within, or at, the limits of adhesion.

When and if lock up happens you will want the fronts to lock up first as
stated unanimously by the assembled multitude.

Carroll Smith claims that the scenario of perfect braking into a corner is to
see two little puffs of blue smoke from the front wheels just as the driver
releases brake pressure and turns in. ( No - don't start on at me about trail
braking- that's a whole different discussion!)

1) Found 1983SC with purported 29K miles, original everything, asking 15K 
negotiable.
2) Looked at car. Repaint (average to below average job), new spedo, bad 
A/C, not original mileage, etc.

Yesterday the car was examined by a mechanic.  The engine is ok, the car 
needs the following:

A/C compressor (rotary conversion, as long as it has to be replaced)
A couple of oil lines
Half shafts
Sunroof motor 
Tires
Tensioner update (the tensioners are ok, but the update isn's a bad idea
Miscellaneous little stuff - alignment, a few seals, etc.
Interior - Leather seats shot

About 2500-3000 estimated by mechanic, who advised not to offer more than 
$10,500 for the car (and we're still left with a bad paint job).

My friend will be buying his first Porsche (something he has always 
wanted).  He wants a perfect car, and has the resources to buy one.  His 
is the type who just wants it to work, without being bothered with this 
stuff.  His is more the typical luxury car owner, not an enthusiast as we 
might consider ourselves (but we need them to supply us with cars!).

I've advised him to pass on this car and buy a 1987+ Carrera, and he 
agrees.  They're available in South Florida starting at about 21K for 
decent condition Coupes.

This might not be a bad car for one of us, if it can be bought at $10,500 
(I doubt that the owner will accept an offer in that range, though)
 
That's all - we'll find a car for him in the next few weeks.

Thanks for your reply to "Tracy", when I saw his last post I thought of

Well a couple of weekends ago, WPIX (I think) showed National Lampoon's 
Vacation, and when Chevy goes to the sporting goods store to buy the 
pellet gun, because Wally World is closed,  there is a white 914 
parked at the curb with a surf board in the passenger seat.

Tracy,
Please rethink your premise as you are completely wrong. No ifs ands or
butts. If you lock up the back first it isn't going to make a bit of
difference what the fronts are doing because it is real hard to steer while
going backwards at a high rate of speed.
I would at least like to see what I am about to hit.
A little friendly advice- It would be nice if you weren't so sure of yourself

Subject: North East Region Autocross this Sunday

Attention all porschephephilers within reasonable driving distance of Boston!

This Sunday, May 7, will be the PCA/NER's first autocross of the 1995 season.  
We are once again planning a five event series which is again sponsored by 
European Performance Engineering.  NER autocross events are very well organized 
and we almost always get 6 runs per driver.  All PCA members are welcome and 
may drive any type of car which passes tech.  Non-members may also participate 
but they may only drive a Porsche.

We run up to twelve classes, class 12 being for all non-Porsche's.  If you're 
not sure what class you'd belong in, no worry, we'll let you know when you get 
there.  Trophies are awarded for each class based upon the number of entries in 
the class (based on the PCR's).  We also have a novice award for the fastest 
participant in each class who has never previously won a trophy.  The rules of 
the event are modified PCR's.

We welcome drivers of all skill level.  We have instructors for those who would 
like one.  Newcomers are especially welcome!


   When:      Sunday, May 7th, 1995

   Where:     Bayside Exposition Center
              (about 5 minutes south of Boston)

   Schedule:  Registration opens at 9AM.
              Tech opens at 9:30 (possibly earlier)
              Registration closes at 10:30 *SHARP*
              Tech closes at 10:45 *SHARP*
              Drivers meeting at 11:00.

   Cost:      US$15.00 for PCA members.
              US$20.00 for non-members.


Other notes:
   o We allow two drivers per car.
   o Weather is forecast to be sunny.  Bring sun protection.
   o No on site food (maybe an ice cream truck).  Bring a picnic.
   o If you're not a PCA member we can sign you up on site.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at work (617) 693-5612 or at 
home (617) 277-5295 until 10PM EST.

Hope to see you there!

OK, I did something dumb - in changing my rear shocks(914) I paid no
attention to which end was up on the springs.  I keep looking at them, and
can't see that it makes any difference, but thought I'd take advantage of the
Forum.  Is there a difference in the coil direction?  Which is proper?

By the way, a thought about spring compressors.  I've known for x years that
these damned springs are dangerous, and have done this bit before.  But, I
GOT LAX!!!!!  Wasn't cautious about releasing the compressors and guess what
 - I NEARLY LOST MY F__ING FACE. Believe what the manuals say, and never be
too cautious!  A spring bounced off my chest, hit the wall, and almost killed
the cat, who was sleeping peacefully!

Subject: Hot Targa



O wise ones, I beseech thee:

My 73 T targa (no leaks around the top, but the window seals...) runs too
warm for my ease of mind.

On a warm day in the state of Northern California, it hits 200-220 pretty
easily, and on a hot day chasing other cars of same lineage on tours I've
hit 250.

The engine is clean, oil cooler on engine is clean, new thermostat, and the
a/c stuff is out of the car.  From what I've heard, these temps aren't
unusual for this vintage, but it's still too hot.  Eventually I want the a/c 

back in and cooling requirements will be even greater.  So...

I want to add an oil cooler.  I've been thinking about using a multi-row
finned style in the rf cat throw (fender well).  The a/c was probably dealer 

added, since there's no front condenser.  I'm changing to a front S spoiler
when I repaint this summer (before Parade!) so I may mount an additional a/c 

condensor there.

Any thoughts?  Advice?  What can I expect to pay for a used cooler such as a 

Terbotrol?  What about making my own from readily available hoses/tubing and 

coolers?

I have a very happy motor and I want to squeeze as many miles out of it as I 

can.  Thanks for any input.

Subject: re: new turbo

Hi all -

Had the chance to see the new turbo up close and personal last night.  
What a beautiful new car.

Some highlights:  the wheels are not left/right as suggested (all the same
except 10" in rear vs. 8" in front x 18" dia. and the spokes are hollow; 
something about fusing the two wheel halfs together to allow for these
hollow spokes), all leather interior including the dash (just like the old
days), the new tail is about two-three inches lower to the ground to help
with top speed and the sides/ends swoop down toward the fender before
forming the traditional lip, no basket handle and with a cabrio sitting
next to it to compare to the basket handle didn't look that bad (although
the glass one looked better; don't know why they couldn't fit it into the
rear edge of the turbo tail), then new non-filament headlights are great
(something about over 10000 volts and its just a bunch of sparks creating
the light in the enclosed glass bulb, very bluish light vs. old yellow
light), sport seats with half sides up near your upper torso area (between
stomach and shoulders), it arrived with only 32 miles on it from factory
testing and twin turbos with the largest intercooler I have seen in a
street car (couldn't see much of the engine below it :-)). 

That's about it that I can remember.  The new owner was on his way to 
pick it up.  The first thirteen from this dealership are already sold and 
with delivery of only one a month if your interested you'll have to wait 
until next April!  Of course, we all know money can talk.

Oh, BTW, they are only around $120,000 for those of you interested and 
can afford it.

Subject: Stereo for 73 911 targa


In order to appease the girlfriend, I am installing a stereo in the 911 so 
as to make the trip to Parade more enjoyable.  Sigh.

I'm doing a consulting trade with a friend who owns a stereo store (which 
means no cash out, a big plus) and have tentatively decided on an Alpine 
7822 CD unit.  I may or may not put an additional amp in depending on how it 
sounds.

So the early 911s have the pocket that interferes with speaker installation 
in the door.  My pockets aren't perfect anyway, and I've been thinking about 
updating the door panels, and installing separates (mid-woof and tweeter).

1. Do the doors have a cut-out provision for speakers?  What year panels 
should I be considering?  Or aftermarket?  Custom?

2. Will 6.5" speakers fit or am I limited to 5.25"?

3. I'll probably use Alpine separates in the doors, but my dealer friend has 
  recommended Boston c700 plates for the rear shelf.  Comments?

4. I really like a fair amount of bass (I was going to say bottom end, but 
didn't want to excite Bart) but I have kids that fit nicely in the rear 
seats so I need to keep the rear seats and foot wells.  Any ideas about 
subwoofer placement?  I put Recaros in a year ago so I do have some room 
under the seats...

5. This will require doing something on the order of an antenna, obviously, 
and although I've considered doing the in-the-windshield  version with 
preamp ( I'm replacing the original windshield this summer when I repaint) 
cost makes me lean towards an electric antenna in the stock position in the 
rear of the RF fender.  I recall some posts about this a few months ago, but 
can't find them.  Any quality antennaes that will fit there?

Thanks in advance for any comments/advice.  Andy?  Other stereo pros?

From what I understand, starting in August 1975, all of the chassis
metal was galvanized, but stuff like the fenders and the top were
the last things to be galvanized (something like 1980 before this
was done).  BTW, this pertains to 911s - I'm not sure about the other

This is in response to the lack of discounts given by radar decector
companies to clubs.  

I am a k40 dealer.  K40 will pay the cost of any ticket you get within the
first year of purchse.  Even if your Porsche is clocked at 150 mph+  They
 have really good stuff.  Front and rear units that have control units that
are totally hidden.  Just 2 LEDS in the dash, one for front one for rear.
 They also have units with regular control heads for the customer that wants
a simple install.  I have mounted leds in the rear view mirrors, it makes for
a really cool effect 

I am new to this section so I don't know what the stand is commerical posts
here so I will not post prices and such but if anyone wants pricing email me.
 I can certainly offer a discount for clubs that place orders as a group.  I
also sell Bell stuff to but once you have seen a k40 hidden radar unit you

Is it possible to build the System Tester 9288 used in 911 C2/C4s (964),

From reading the manuals - it sounds like it's a standard tool that could 
be used on other makes of cars.  I was thinking that someone came up with 
a circuit that would allow you to do connect your PC or something to the 
connector with the same functionality.

Or maybe purchasing a similar model from somewhere cheap (<$200).

Maybe I'm way off.  It's just seems like a real handy thing to have 
in the garage for these CPU driven beast.

Subject: ** Looking for a pair of Black Sport Seats **

Hi all.

This is going to sound a little strange, so please don't flame me.

In my '84 944, I have Black leather (regular) seats. I would kill for a
pair of sport seats (I just really happen to like them).

In any case, I also have a Macintosh IIsi computer with monitor,video card,
keyboard & mouse (17mbram/80mbdrive). Ideally, I would like to **trade** my
regular black seats and the IIsi for a pair of black sport seats.

If anyone is even remotly interested in this deal, let me know. The current
value of a Mac IIsi in the above config. is about $700-$800.

regards,
trev.

Absolutely, and the best way to make a late inside pass, is to dive
underneath the other guy, tromp the brakes hard enough to light-up the

It's almost summer so it's nice to know I'm not the only one suffering from
the fact I can't open my damn sunroof. My 87 944 was in desprate need of
new paint so I decided to get this done before spring and dropped off the
car late march, the sunroof was working fine. After reciving the car back
(paint looks great) I noticed the roof would only open about 1/4". I was
told that for whatever reason they were not able to re-fit the sunroof
after it had been removed for painting (why I have no idea!!) and they had
to manually adjust it to get it on. Seems since this adjustment I has not
worked.

It goes up 1/4" and stops, you can then open it manually without a problem
and it closes fine. Try and open it again, 1/4". Try removing it...no
problems. Any suggestions would be helpfull as I know this is a "Pig of a

I just finished reconditioning and repainting a 1978 SC that I regrettably
had to sell due to my divorce.  Fortunately it went to
a fellow P-filer in MN named Vic Lee (Hi Vic!)  

I also re-did my '80 SC to concours condition a year ago.

My experience with Rubber is as follows:

Vertex - Cheapest reproductions but nearly *no* reproduction 
             rubber  parts fit as well as factory, and the rubber 
             compound is quite hard and seals poorly

Several Others in Pano/Excel - Higher than Vertex but same 
             story on the repro parts.

Tweeks - Had the cheapest OEM parts in nearly every case,
              but they did send me two repro parts and error and 
              exchanged them later.

Dealer - Remarkably, the Dealer (Sunset Porsche) was cheaper
            on some of the parts.  All OEM

Automo/Prof Prod/Stoddards - Higher than Tweeks, but Cheaper
            than the dealer in nearly all cases.

Bottom line - Go with OEM in any critical seal area (less leaks)
                   but ya still ''gotta shop around"

each.  Everywhere else seems to be around $115.  Is this the result of 
Unka Bart's little blue ones or has someone actually purchased these and 
for that price?

If this is a mirage, any suggestions on sources considering both price

Yes Scott,

I believe that it is possible to build a circuit tester that could employ 
say com1 or your parallel port on your PC.  I envisioned a harness for 
those early models that didn't have test plugs.  It could sample certain 
circuits for voltages and resistances and do so to a master clock so it 
could check things like warm up cycles for the FI unit.  The PC with the 
proper interface could become a great tester for these items.  It could 
check out an FI brain or a motronic unit very quickly.

Hi Bob,

Depending upon the amount of fabrication that you wish to undertake there 
are several things that you can do.
 
Some of the guys here have used a MAZDA oil cooler mounted up front with 
the tubes taken from a '75-'77S cars.  These terminate in the r-front 
fender and with Airquip Metric fittings silversoldered onto tubing or 
hose ends have seemed to solve their problems.

My '72T would run warmer with thinner wt oil in the summer.  I could vary 
the oil temperature about 10-15 degrees with the change in wt.  I would 
like 176 F degrees to run at.

Make sure that your oil tank is clean. (Yeah right especially where its 
mounted)  I looked into a '74 one day and found that there was so much 
dirt between the tank and the body of the car that it had transmitted 
enough heat to the interior panel to melt the plastic!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Well we worked out the deal on the 2.0, $4900 of which I loaned 
him $1000 so I guess that makes me part owner of yet another P-car :^)
About the exhaust system, Has Bursch header and muffler which was 
installed at engine rebuild and stainless steel heat exchangers that are 
eight years old and put out good heat.  All emission controls were removed 
very near new (my 924 was like this) as NC has VERY liberal inspections.  
The owner made the "always garaged, never in rain" claim which usually 
I would be suspicious.  But this car looks the part, has a 3 car garage 
and I looked HARD for rust and could find NONE.  I even went so far as  
to take up a lot of the carpet, even behind the seats on our test drive  
(didn't want the owner to sh*t his pants :^)
	My brother is SO happy to have found such a great car.  We pick 
it up tomorrow, can't wait to see how a stock 914's handling compares to 
my 924 and my Corvair/914.  He likes the '76 bumpers, he thinks they 
blend better with the lines of the fender, kind of extending the line on 
the end of the fenders at the parking lamps.  I'll agree with him on 
that, though I would like the integrated fog lamps and lesser weight the 
early bumpers offer.  Question, any good way of removing the "innards" of 
these bumpers to lighten them up?  How about just replacing the heavy 
back bumper with the earlier kind, are they easily interchangeable and 
will it help the front/rear balance?  
Thanks for any ideas.

Subject: 911 Valve Adjusting Blues

I just got done adjusting the valves on my 911 for the first time (I've
adjusted them on other cars before).  When I got done, the clicking of the
valves (one in particular) seems to be alot worse.  I mean it is damn
annoying and somewhat worrysome.  I didn't used to be able to really notice
the clicking that bad.  I've been around other 911's before and they were not
nearly this bad either.

Here is what I did:

1. I removed all of the spark plugs.  

2. I adjusted the valves to 0.004" using the valve adjusting tool I bought
from Automotion (little S shaped thingamajig).  I adjusted them to the point
of being fairly snug on the adjusting tool.

3. I followed the firing order (starting with #1) and rotated the engine to
TDC for each of the cylinders.

4. As I was adjusting the valves, I noticed the #2 cylinder exhaust valve
clearance was what I would call very loose.  More so than
the other valves.  Anyway, I adjusted it to the 0.004".

5. After putting everything back together (I also replaced the valve
cover gaskets) I fired the engine up.  

I immediately noticed the engine "ticked" much worse than before.  I could
tell it was coming from the drivers side, exhaust valves.  At least it was
much louder when I place my ear down near the exhaust valves (and I have a
loud exhaust).  I let the car idle for a little while then shut it off.  I'm
afraid to rev it too much.

I have a couple of questions:
*******************************

1. Will valves make more noise if they are adjusted "tight" instead of
"loose"?  Or vice versa.

2.  Would there be a reason why the previous owner would have adjusted the
valves "loose"?


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Fiberglas & Subwoofers -- 944

Since car audio seems to be a current topic...

I've been planning to mount some 8" JL subs in my 944.  They've been in the 
car for a while now, in a temporary box in the back.  But the plan is to mount
them in the spaces behind the rear wheel wells.  
At first I tried building boxes that would fit in these spaces and be just big
enough.
Worked perfectly except that my calculations were off and I couldn't quite get
the
boxes in place (luckily the prototype only took an hour to build...)
A friend who does installs for a living suggests I should use the existing sheet
metal for the enclosure walls, with an MDF top-surface (where the sub mounts)
cut to shape and bonded in place with fiberglas-type body filler.  He says they
do
this a lot and it works well.

Has anyone done such a thing?  I'm a little leery, because of (a) the rear side
signal
lights which could leak out air or have their gaskets "blown out" by the air
pressure,
and (b) the several drain tubes which go through those spaces and out through
rubber
grommets (this would all have to be sealed better).

I'm more inclined to spend a lot more time and create a fiberglas "shell" inside
each
cavity, shaped so that it could be removed.  The thought was that I would line
the
surfaces with foam or some other filler, then lay in the fiberglas and keep
layering it...

As I'm sure some of you have experience using fiberglas for various purposes,
I'd sure
love to hear any helpful hints or advice -- especially if it's obvious to you
that I'm about
to spend a lot of hours on a hopeless idea...

On the more mechanical note, I've FINALLY got my parts and P9201/9202 tools, so 
bright and early tomorrow those belts and motor mounts get swapped!  Wish me
luck!

Hi again,
     My new 911 turbo---whoops, dreaming again---my 1983 944's clock is
running a little slow.  I opened up the dash to see if there was an
adjustment for this--couldn't make much sense of it.  Any ideas--someone told
me that this clock was adjustable.(?)  While I was in there, I noticed that
one of the mechanisms holding the defrost control wire was broken.  So when I

valve doesn't move at all.  Has anyone else experienced this?  How difficult
is it to correct?

With all due respect, the 951, though fast, is still a 944, and was
not built with the same limited-production techniques as are lavished
on the 911 and 928.  The body of my 20-year-old 911 is still tight as
a vault.

There's always going to be a tradeoff between solidity and agility.
As for resale value, that is an elusive matter that has to do with
more than a car's quality or durability.  The SL and SLC were equal in
quality, but the former has always enjoyed a higher resale value.
Similarly, the 911 has held its value better than the 928.  The
Mercedes SL has always held its value exceptionally well, not only
when compared with cars of other makes, but when compared with any
other Mercedes as well.

Not to incite any flames here, but you're comparing an enhanced
version of what was meant to be an entry-level Porsche with something
near the top of the Mercedes line.  When you get past a certain point,
any standard of evaluation becomes highly personal and subjective.
It's like Harvard versus Yale.  Or whether Stanford will ever be more

> By that I mean, someone who has owned both an M-B and a Porsche?

Lots of us. As it turns out.

Here's the scoop: by your own admission, you bought the wrong car.
*NO* Porsche -- EVER! -- was made to compare with the MBZs. (Except
arguably the 928 which was *supposed* to have been a replacement for
the 450 SLC, or so the story goes)

The 911 is bone primitive, the waterpumpers lose about 50% of their
value in the first 3 years. But the last MBZ that I had, a 300E,
was so overengineered and over-refined that it was just not bearable
to own, so it Went Away. This has been a trend in MBZ for a while 
now -- they're great for a couple of years then they're crapped
out. Usually catastrophic accessory failure -- the hydraulic elbow
scratcher or the electric nosehair trimmer or something ELSE that costs 
soooo much to fix that you decide to sell instead.

Plus, you said the R-word: resale value. If that's even a consideration,
go buy some sort of bond or something, not a car. Shit, cars are for
driving, they're *NOT* an investment. If you're thinking that way, you're
really barking up the wrong tailpipe.

Now, the paradox: I drive a 356SC. Daily. As in *EVERY DAY*, rain
or shine. And this is Houston, so unless you're in Seattle, I can
certainly tell you about rain. And lots of miles a day, over 75 on
average. That's no accessories, totally primative, PURE car, nothing
added. I love it. 

Finally, you talked about MONEY and putting cars on the track at the
same time. I *ROUTINELY* used to put over a quarter million dollars
worth of 911 (ONE CAR) on the track at once, in traffic. Most of us don't 
think anything about taking a Plain Old Street Porsche and putting it on 
the track -- that's what they're made for. And if I had the 300SL
gullwing coupe that I've wanted for a few years now, I'd for DAMN SURE
put it on the track.

Now it's time for the Politically Correct part of this lecture: none of
this makes me right and you wrong. Porsche and MBZ make the cars that they
make, and that's that. We're all entitled to our preferences, but what
we're *NOT* entitled -- any of us -- to do is berate any one car for
not being like some other car. Otherwise the assholes at Consumer Reports
would have everything devolve back to being their "perennial bellweather,
the Toyota Camry". (Another OK car, but yoy won't see one in my driveway
now that you can't get the 3.0 V6 with a stick)

So chill out, and be glad that you've learned something important: you
are not cut out to own a Porsche.

Given the success of the V1, I suspect that Mr. Valentine had to skip
Sales 101 so that he could enroll in the graduate program for

high-demand product.  "Club discounts" were probably not much of a

Personally, I don't think that my ability to turn on a computer and
subscribe to a mail reflector should necessarily entitle me to
discounts on products from vendors who might also subscribe to the
list.  As long as they do not try to exploit the list, I welcome these
vendors (who might even be genuine Pcar fans like the rest of us) to
participate in discussions that ultimately improve our understanding
and knowledge of our cars and the products designed to
maintain/improve them.  Getting badgered for discounts is not likely
to contribute to such vendor participation.  In this particular
instance, Mr. Valentine responded to the request for a discount with
information about refurbished detectors.  I would not have known about
this if he were not on the list.

I have no problem with asking vendors on the list for a discount on
their products, but trying to retaliate against them by recommending
competitor's products when (for whatever BUSINESS reason they might
have) they decline to offer one (or as large a break as one might
hope) is really uncalled-for.

Subject: re: MB 500SL vs Porsche

Rich:

The two cars have entirely different characters outside of build quality and
hardware.  The 500SL is a great car with excellent structural rigidity but it
feels like a "tank" compared to the lightweight and responsive nature of a
911.  We just about bought a low-mileage 300SL 24 valve 5-speed last year but
after driving the car (and as a Mercedes owner), I felt it was "just like a S
series Sedan" compared to the unique (engine noise, responsiveness, small,
etc) nature of our 88 911.  A moderately well-driven 500 SL will "eat" most
Porsches (up through stock Carrera 2/4) on tracks with long straights at most
non-competitive "club type" driver education events.

The body, paint quality, and switchware of the new 84 944 I had and others
I've looked at including the last Turbo, S2, and 968, was mediocre by
comparison to Mercedes (latter also true for many BMWs).  SLs hold resale
value even better than a 911.   But if someone (maybe Bart??) suggested
driving into a brickwall at 50 mph, I'd choose the MB anytime over a Porsche
or the new M-3 we have.  But is that what you're buying it for ????

Rick,
        You are comparing apples and oranges. As others have said on this
list, ou have to buy what you like. My mother-in-law owned the 300SL for
about a year and couldn't live with it. She ended up with another MB, which
she likes better, but she could EASILY be swayed by another car. The SL
drives like a big heavy car and just is not the same type of car as a 993.
OTOH, I have a 993 that I wouldn't give up for anything. It is not just
enjoyable to drive everyday, it is downright fun. To illustrate this
further, when I bought my '91 911 C2 (which I traded for the 993) my wife
thought that it was not for her, for many of the same reasons you don't care
for the 911's. So, she got a 928, which was a heavier more "solid" feeling
car, which felt like it had more "quality". Both cars have been rock solid
reliable, but after about 2 years my wife stopped caring to drive drive the
928 and much prefers the 911. The only reason I traded the C2 for a 993 was
so that we could get a color that she felt we could share more (she didn't
like the silver :->), although I am glad we traded because the 993 is even
better yet. By the way, the C2 never had a problem in 4 years, not bad
reliability. And the 993, after 6 months hasn't seen the dealer since I
bought it, which speaks for initial quality - no adjustments, etc. I can't
say the same for the 300SL that my mother-in-law owns (or the 600SLC that my
father-in-law owns, although he loves it).
        Not all of us are biased and have owned Porsches all their lives. I
didn't buy my first one until I was about 40. I swore that the Porsches were
over priced especially compared to my previous favorite brand, Mazda, of
which I have owned several. I have also owned 2 "7" series BMWs, a brand I
prefer over MB for a sedan because of its great handling. Unfortunately, I
had many quality problems with the BMWs and it might be a while before I go
back to them.
        The point is, if you like the MB, go for it. Personally, and that is
what buying a car is all about, I wouldn't drive one unless I had to.
Driving my Land Cruiser is more fun than driving those numb handling
trucks///cars. My German friends tell me that the Germans think the MBs are
oversized boats, which could have something to do with why sales died when
they first came out with the new S class cars.
        Get the SL500 and come back in about a year and tell us how much you
like living with it, if you aren't too embarrassed :-).

Subject: early 911 tires!

Now that I've got my 73 911 running, it's time for the suspension. First the
tires. Right now I've got 20yr old XWXs with 1 in splits on the
sidewalls(they still hold air???), but I'm trailering it around and really nee
d to drive it around to get everything settled back in.. I'm going to use
this car as a daily-driver, with some drivers-ed events.
I've got the "S" suspension (konis, sways,6X15 Fuchs) and like using a "V"
rated tire for the construction quality and improved control.
Since I want a tire than I can readily obtain, I'm thinking of using BFG. How
about VR4s?? I know they are not the best performance tire, but the seem to
be an all round decent tire. Size wise, I'm not sure what to do. I want to
stay with the same rev/mi, which means about 920-930. My XWXs were
935(185-70). With the 6in rims, less section width will give me better
control-- while more width will inprove ride comfort.Right????? That leaves
me with 185/65,195/65,205/65. I think a 60 or 55 series would be the wrong
tire to use? I,ve been told that some people use 215/50 R-1s on 7x15s, but
you have to bring in the rear camber to get the clearance.
Does this thinking seem  OK to any of you experts??  Email any suggestions.
I've been told that some 944 Fuchs 6x16 would fit an early 911 with no
clearance problems. Anybody know??

Corbett,

I have had this same experience.  You may be right - your valves may be
making more noise than they were before you adjusted them.  On the other
hand, I think one of Murphy's Laws deals with this phenomena - "Anytime
you make an adjustment to something to make it quieter, it's going to
sound louder whether it is or not".  OK, I'm making all of this up, but now
that you've adjusted them, you are much more conscious of how loud they
are.  

As long as you feel comfortable with the adjustments you made (what you
did sounds fine), I wouldn't worry a whole lot about it.

I was told by a well-respected mechanic that, if anything, the valves should
be adjusted a little on the loose side.

Subject: Which end locks first?

Gosh, just when P'philes was getting dull, we get another flame war! All
right!!!  Larry Herman wants us to believe his cauterization of Tracy Nelson
was an accident. And Frank Kerfoot basically got it "right" (in the Political
Correctness sense of being right). And like Frank I agree that if wheels
lock, it should be the fronts. But...

One of the standard textbooks on brake systems is "Braking of Road Vehicles"
by Newcomb and Spurr. copyrighted 1967. p. 20, under "Directional Stability",
says:

"When a wheel is locked the direction of the frictional force is independent
of the orientation of the wheel and so cannot be used to control the
direction of the vehicle." (OK, we're with you so far...)

"Consider first that the rear wheels are locked and that the vehicle is
moving in a straight line. The centre of gravity of the vehicle will continue
to move in the original direction, but if for some reason a small couple
operates about a vertical line through the CG, caused for example, by uneven
braking on the two sides of the vehicle, or by the road camber, the vehicle
acquires an angular velocity about an instantaneous centre...  (you mean it
spins, Doc?)

[Newcomb goes on to describe the actual trajectory of the car; car whill spin
faster to conserve angular momentum]....until the axis of the car is
perpendicular to the direction of motion, then begins to diminish until
eventually it becomes zero and the vehicle proceeds stably with the rear
wheels leading... (Ever wonder why many spins wind up with the car going
backwards in a straight line? Because it's stable that way).

"Conversely, if the front wheels lock the front of the car tends to slide
forward in a straight line, the vehicle as a whole being restrained by the
rear wheels. There is a caster action and the vehicle is highly stable and
will not respond to the steering wheel."

"If all four wheels lock simultaneously, the vehicle will slide down the
camber out of control. If the rear wheels lock less than 0.5 sec before the
front wheels the vehicle continues to move ahead in a straight line, and if
one rear wheel locks before the other no deviation occurs until both lock."

"There is some controversy whether front or rear skids are more dangerous;
indeed the argument goes back to the time four wheel brakes were first
introduced. A good driver with a fast response time can correct a rear wheel
skid by driving out of it, but once the car has deviated 20 degrees or so
even a skilled driver can no longer regain control if the vehicle is moving
at any speed; and at high speeds a skid can build up too rapidly for the
driver to recover from it. Once the car is out of control it is a danger to
other traffic.

"A front wheel skid gives the driver a feeling of utter helplessness as he is
powerless to steer the car. He can regain control if he releases the brake,
but then might risk a collision with the object ahead. He also feels more
vulnerable in the event of a collision, for with a rear wheel skid the rear
end of the vehicle is more likely to take the impact. Front wheel skids are
much rarer than rear wheel skids. The consensus of opinion in Europe appears
to be that rear wheel skids are more dangerous, in America opinion is more div
ided. All skids are of course dangerous; the controversy probably reduces to
whether the driver prefers to leave the road head first or tail first."

Thus endeth the scripture lesson.

Does all this mean that people who think the fronts should lock up first are
Nazi Sheep [(c), TM, marca registrada, all rights reserved by Porschephiles-Na
zi Sheep Pty. Ltd. etc.) and those who think the rears should lock up are the
Uebermenschen (Supermen to those of you who aren't into Nietsche, but then,
who is...) who can recover from a skid after the tail has come around 90
degrees?

I have an '85 911 coupe.  I've had it for 4 years, been very happly with it,
with no mechanical maladies other then changing the alternator at 50,000
miles.  I've also had a 356 and a 912.

About 6 months ago, it started losing power for about a second, then back to
normal.  It didn't seem like a fuel starvation thing where an engine starves
and loses rev's gradually - this is complete off and back on.
It will go weeks at a time and then repeat this, recently dying completely,
only to easily restart on the shoulder of the road, then fine.

Just to rule out fuel as the culprit, I've changed the filter twice and
found no debris, water, etc.  The shop that I take it to says the Motoronic
doesn't have diagnostics that help, which is reasonable since all the vital
signs are fine except for when it cuts out.

Both the shop and I have checked and re-seated every wire and connection
accessable, as this seems like a wire that sometimes loses contact.

Anyone experience this sort of thing?  I'm at the point of hoping for a
complete failure so that it can be diagnosed and fixed.

Subject: Build quality

My 1983 944 is "almost new," still w/ less than 20,000 mi on its untampered
odometer.  I've crawled all over/under it, and think its build quality is
very good.  However, 13 years have elapsed since it was built, a millenium in
auto industry terms, and the standard of quality has risen tremendously since
then.  I am amazed by the quality of construction, design, and fabrication in
such modest cars as Tercels, Civics, and Neons, which bests that of very
expensive cars of 15-20 years ago.

I agree that the 951/968 lines are not built to the standards of M-B, but
then few cars are, and the price difference is, um, *noticeable.*  It seems
to me a bit of apples/oranges comparison.  If I had the bread, I'd have
driven to work today in a new 993... or better yet, the new turbo.  Whoosh!
As it is, I tossed the ole '944 around a few curves and felt quite well
entertained.

After having had the 944 for two years, I must say that owning what is almost
a custom built car almost new for under $10K is very satisfying.  If the 944
body were introduced de novo today, it would look timely and sexy.  I'm a
happy buyer who would cheerfully buy a new 968 if circumstances permitted.

I have to admit to having owned both.

My Mercedes was a solid car, to the point of being a tank. No one will ever
accuse Daimler Benz of not building a sturdy vehicle.  

Unfortunately, when they add all of that weight, they diminish the
sportiness of the vehicle. Face it, the 500SL (like the BMW 850i) is an
autobahn cruiser, not a sports car.

Porsche makes sports cars, for the most part, and that's why I own them.

Mercedes makes Sedans, and very well, but, that's not what I want.

(Of course, with 2 Audis and 3 Porsches, I always have something to do...)

Subject: Re: Speaker Box


If I got the drift:
The is nothing wrong with using the sheet metal for one or more sides of the
enclosure.  I have dont this many times also at my shop.  Make sure you use a
material that seals the wood to the metal well.  And use MDf like you said
not particle board.  With 8 inch speakers it probablly will not make much diff
erance but MDF is what you use for bigger speakers so why take the chance of
the wood vibrating.  I guess one side of the box sheet metal has the access
panel for the rear lights.  8 inch speakers will not build up enough pressure
to blow out the lights or anything like  that.   I don't know if you are
going to port the speaker box but if you do that the air pressure is reduced
even further.  I am not sure what the drain tubes go through the metal their.
 I assume that it comes in through one peice of sheet metal and out the
other.  You could put  a silicon sealer on it.  That would be more then fine.
 Just make sure you still have access to your tail lights.   Even if you have
to take the speaker out of the box to get to it..  If you have any other
questions let me know I would be glad to answer.  BTW I run a custom car
stereo business so anyone with car audio or security questions can direct

Personal Touch Audio
===================

Since car audio seems to be a current topic...

I've been planning to mount some 8" JL subs in my 944.  They've been in the 
car for a while now, in a temporary box in the back.  But the plan is to
mount
them in the spaces behind the rear wheel wells.  At first I tried building
boxes that would fit in these spaces and be just big enough.  Worked
perfectly except that my calculations were off and I couldn't quite get the
boxes in place (luckily the prototype only took an hour to build...) A friend
who does installs for a living suggests I should use the existing sheet
metal for the enclosure walls, with an MDF top-surface (where the sub mounts)
cut to shape and bonded in place with fiberglas-type body filler.  He says
they
do this a lot and it works well.

Has anyone done such a thing?  I'm a little leery, because of (a) the rear
side
signal lights which could leak out air or have their gaskets "blown out" by th
e air
pressure, and (b) the several drain tubes which go through those spaces and
out through
rubber grommets (this would all have to be sealed better).

I'm more inclined to spend a lot more time and create a fiberglas "shell"
inside
each cavity, shaped so that it could be removed.  The thought was that I
would line
the surfaces with foam or some other filler, then lay in the fiberglas and
keep
layering it...

Can someone help with my 951 radio, the Blaupunct Reno? (Factory stock item).

It doesn't work any more....When I turn it on, it "clicks" across all four
speakers, and I do get the regular tuning display, the cassette runs, etc.
BUT no sound!

Both fuses, 36 and 39, are O.K. (15A) I removed the radio, and all four
speakers are plugged in, as is the antenna and the power clip. There are
some spare  wires, that I presume are for an optional booster (are they?).

Any suggestions out there? Apart from "buy a 911 and enjoy driving without

Subject: Painting Advise (long)

This is in response the an E-mail I received from fellow 
P-filer H. Wilson Busby on questions regarding my 
experiences in restoring my two 911SC's.  Thought that 
this may be of some value to anyone else taking on this 
task.

I am by no means an expert, but I am very willing to 
share my experiences (or, lack thereof <g>)  These are 
opinions only and not based on scientific fact.

First and foremost - 
==============
Examine the quality of craftmanship on work that the 
shop has done and work that is in progress.  Some 
of the keys for me were:

* Level/extent of disassembly (take it all off!!!)
* Looking at how the painter lays down metallics is a
  good indicator of his talent.  Perfectly even, no 
  variance at all!  This is not a factor on solids, but it
  does give you an idea of someone's talent with a gun.
* Hand Color Sanding vs. using a DA (Dual-Action
  Sander)  Done both, and am convinced that Hand 
  Blocking gives a ''flatter'' more uniform gloss to the 
  finished product.

Second and nearly equally important
===========================
Issue a ''work-order'' for the project.  Detail exactly and 
specifically what is to be done.  **Do not leave anything 
out**  Get it all in writing.  I did this on my second car, 
and it save money and kept confusion to an absolute
minimum.  If you expect your car to be returned in 
a condition that is ''perfect'' state it!!  No runs, No sand
through, No over-spray, hand color sanded, paint cut and
polished to a high gloss.  Door jambs painted??? etc.

(Obvoiusly - don't leave out the $$$$)

Take it off yourself!!!
===============
The money savings are obvious here but even more 
important to me was that the level of disassembly was
guaranteed.  You should arrange with a reputable glass 
shop to remove, store and re-install the glass.

I delivered my second car as a rolling shell, no glass, 
with only the doors and trunk lid attached (and the 
shop removed them)  

The disassembly and re-assembly was done without a
manual (and no, I did not have parts left over <G>)  The 
German engineers were very logical for the most part and
this made things fairly easy to ''figure out''.

Be an active participant/inspector
========================
I visited the shop on a regular and friendly basis.  You 
can monitor progress better and if they know you're 
coming by....they seem to take better care.

Supply the parts Yourself
===================
Money Savings in a big way!  Fellow P-filers were a HUGE
help to me here!!!!  All fresh OEM rubber any place a good
seal is important.

Paint Recommendation
=================
I have used PPG and Sikkens Urethane color coats with 
clear coats over.  It is my perception that the Sikkens is 
the better product.  However, I have been told that the
PPG is more flexible and will better resist rock chips.

I have also heard good things 'bout Glasurit, but have
no experience with it.

$$$$$$$$$
========
My ''baby'' cost me 'round $8500 to re-do.  (Prep/Paint/
Parts/Everything)

The shop did most of the work and I was not very satisfied 
with the work. She took first place in class at the Portland 
Rainbonnet concours, but I can still see lots-o-things that 
'bug'' me in the paint.

I did a lot more work on the second car, and It cost me
about $4500 (for all) and the quaility of the job is 
noticably better (to me) than the show car!!!!

One last comment.... It will cost more than you have
budgeted, and It will take twice as long as originally 
anticipated.  Face this on the front end and don't be upset
on the back end.  The best paint guys are true artists, and
as such...they tend to walk to that different ''beat''...They
have also been ''sniffing'' Laquers, Enamels and 
Urethanes for years.  Ya just gotta face that fact.

Hope that this is of some value to Y'all!

Ken,

I have the same problem on my 87 911 Carrera. I have had no luck in

is warm. The power goes out ( revs fall ) and scares the hell out of me. 
Then the power comes back and I'm away agin.

This list is great and I know somebody will help both of ou out !

Hi Paul:

I just went through the Early 911 Tire thing myself.

The 6x15's work well and it is my opinion that 6x16's would be no problem given
they have the same offset.  What you want is the same total height as stock (or
close) so your speedo reads right.

I found that the 205/60x15 V rated tires are only about 3mm shy of the original
specs for that car.  They seem to tuck up in there without any problems.

Good Luck!

I'm not an expert on this modification, but it involves using a
baseball bat or something to crush the little lip on your fender,
or push the fender out a bit (or both). I would be very careful
about who did it. Ask someone in your local PCA club if there
is a Porsche body or race shop that does it. Anybody care

Actually I have a very long article about autocrossing every model of
Porsches, I should post it to the faq. It ran in several CVR PCA
magazines, and some other newsletters picked it up. It is
geared to stock class autocrossing. But I need to update it for
1995. I'll send it to you if you want, and try to post it soon.

Anyway, the 924 has not proven very good, but the later 924S 
is quite good, it's a 944 in 924 clothing. The '73 914 (either 1.7 
or 2.0) and '74 2.0 are great autocrossers. I have a '73 2.0 in 
CT that I am thinking of selling... Your 911 should be very fun,
and competitive in PCA. In SCCA it could be tough.

Subject: Cronar Paint

Eight or ten years ago, I had my bought-new '73 911-T restored - a very 
nice job they made of it, too.  I had them paint it guards red, using, at 
the suggestion of the shop, DuPont Cronar.
 
I haven't heard of anyone else using Cronar in all these years.  It's been 
wonderful for me - I wash it occasionally with cold water only, and that's 
all it needs.  The color is still eye-popping.  The car lives in the 
garage, so it hasn't been exposed to UV or extremes of heat or cold.
 
Is anyone familiar with Cronar?  How does it stand up to other paints?  
Have I just been lucky, or is it as good as it seems?

Subject: Porsche quality

Now, let me qualify my statements by saying that I have had little
experience with the 944 series and not really that much with other
Porsches simply because I don't own one right now. :(

However, I never personally thought that the 911s seemed like they were 
of poor quality. Maybe I never paid much attention to these things, I was
too busy absorbing the driving experience of the car. The thing that 
struck me the most about a 911 was that the pedals stuck out of the floor,
the windshield seemed rather upright, and the engine made the most unique,
interesting sound I've ever heard- maybe. Whenever I've driven a 911, I am
always reminded of a hopped-up VW Beetle, for some reason. I guess that's 
coming from my childhood, when my Dad drove to work in a Beetle. What a car.
You could always tell when he was coming home, 'cos you could hear him
from a block away. :-) I loved that Beetle. I guess from that time on,
I've had an innate attraction for air-cooled, flat engines in a car 
designed by a German engineer named Porsche. I hope that the 996 will retain
some of that unique engine note and character that sets the 911 apart from
other sports cars.

I've only ridden in a Mercedes, never driven one. But I think a friend's
father put it best: "I feel like an old man driving the Mercedes (it was 
a 560 SL). Especially with the automatic transmission."

If you ask me, a Mercedes is not a car for a driving enthusiast. At least 
not in the US, where you can't get a Benz with a manual transmission. For 
the most part. (I think) If I wanted a sedan, BMW is my choice. I wish I 
could get an M5, that was the sweetest driving experience I've ever had, 
except for the Porsche, which was a religious experience. :-)

Also, you shouldn't be worried about resale value with either a Porsche 
or a Mercedes. These are cars that are meant to be bought, and driven for 
the life of the car. I couldn't imagine selling a Porsche, if I bought it 
new. It's like having another child in the family.

Subject: Planning to purchase '77 911S

I'm planning to purchase a '77 911s, but when I had the vehicle inspected,
the mechanic (Eurosport - pretty reputable Porsche service center in
Vancouver) said that the engine needs to be completely overhauled.  He said
that there is power loss from the engine because the head gaskets leak on #4
and #5.


Here was the compression check:

          1) 125    2) 125    3) 130    4) 110    5) 115    6) 125

Here was the leakdown test:

          1) 10%    2) 16%    3) 12%    4) 70%    5) 40%    6) 8%


There are 155,000 miles on the engine.  I read in the 911 FAQ, that the 2.7
litre engine has an average of a 50,000 mile life-span.  Eurosport said that
it will cost me around $5,000 (Cdn), or $3,500 (US) to rebuild.  Would it be
better to rebuild this engine or find a good used 3.0 litre engine?  What
would be more expensive?

Another problem was that the rotors all had to be replaced.  The car hasn't
been in any accidents, the paint is still original and beautiful, there is
no rust and basically everything else checks out.  

I was wondering if an offer price of $10,500 (Cdn) or $7,350 (US) is
reasonable for this car.

Subject: Re: Fiberglas & Subwoofers -- 944

Hello Richard,

Your idea is not a bad one in theory.  It must, however, be properly carried 
out.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong with using the "metal" of the car 
as part of the enclosure as long as it is structurally solid.  It is 
imperative, however, that the resulting enclosure is *completely* air tight 
for maximum efficiency.  There must be no leaks or gaps anywhere in the box 
that can allow air to escape (regardless of whether you intend to build an 
acoustic-suspension or a bass-reflex enclosure).  I suspect that this goal 
might be difficult to achieve with respect to the lenses and drain tubes 
present in that area of the car.  With that in mind I would recommend the 
fiberglass enclosure or "shell" route you suggested to build a custom formed 
enclosure to specifically conform to that mounting location.  You must 
design it so as not to prevent access to the rear light bulbs in the event 
that they may need replacing.  It sounds as though you are well on your way 
to improved bass, and some basic fiberglass work should bring your project 
to proper completion.  Fiberglass is not the *only* option, but it is 
usually the easiest medium to use when dealing with many complex curves, 
shapes, etc.  Follow the instructions very carefully on the fiberglass 
products you use.  To avoid a very lengthy discussion of fiberglass working 
I will recommend that you check out a book about fiberglass boat repair at 
your library for some of the basic info regarding fiberglass work.  

In case you don't have the necessary information, here are the enclosure 
volumes recommended by JL Audio for their 8" subs. 
                                                                             
Sealed Enclosure Volume:      8W1-4or8   0.25 - 0.375 cubic feet
                                             8W6          0.25 - 0.5    
cubic feet

Ported Enclosure Volume       8W1-4or8    0.375 -0.875 cubic feet
                                            8W6           0.5 - 0.875

Subject: Re: Radio Help!

Jonathan, 

The fact that your speakers "click" at power up most likely indicates that 
your problem lies within the head unit (assuming that there is no type of 
external amplifier powering the speakers).  Obvioulsy, the unit is getting 
proper power if all other functions work properly.  If it were a problem 
with the head-to-speaker wiring then you would not hear that power-on 
clicking.  If you want to check for yourself, disconnect the speaker clip 
and turn the unit on and off listening for the clicking.  There should be no 
sounds what-so-ever.  If the unit has a "knob" style volume control then 
that *may* be your culprit as the wire-wound potentiometers often wear and 
become dirty (although that doesn't necessarily explain the total lack of 
sound).  I recommend that you take the unit in to a repair shop to diagnose 
and repair the problem.  If the cost is excessive I strongly recommend that 
you do *not* have it repaired.  New units are not that expensive, and now 
may be a good time to upgrade to CD if you wish.

Hope this helps.  More questions?

Who knows, maybe you will  like some extra tunes once in a while as well.  I

tune-age on the long trips is nice sometimes.

IMO, the Alpine is a very good, high-performance unit.  You should be very 
pleased with your choice.  You will want to add a basic small to mid-sized 
amplifier if you experience problems with excessive road noise and/or 
top-off listening.  An external amp will allow your system to play louder 
and *cleaner* with far less distortion at medium to high listening levels 
than the head-supplied power.  If you find it unbearable to listen due to 
road/engine/wind noise, then go for an external amp.  An amp not only makes 
a system potentially louder, but it *also* will improve the overall sound 
quality and dynamic range in most cases.

I can't tell you what lies behind the stock door panels of your '73, as I 
have never personally opened them up.  Perhaps somebody else on the list can 
help you there, or just pull the panels and check it out for yourself.  If 
you want to go to the expense of aftermarket specialty door pods that will 
handle separates, then take a look at the SOUND QUEST "Audioforms" line of 
equipment.  They are specially designed speaker pods created for a 
particular model of car, and are designed to blend and flow with the lines 
of the interior as much as possible.  They are *not* cheap, but they do 
usually turn out well.  Also, USD Audio by Speaker Works sells 
raw-fiberglass kick-panel enclosures for the 911 that will accomodate 
separates.  Using kick panel enclosures you elimiate the need to do any work 
with the door panels.   Alternatively, a good installer (or a highly 
competent DIY'er) should have no problem custom fabricating new door panels 
or speaker pods of your preference.  The experienced professional will use 
various materials (MDF, fiberglass, bondo, etc.) to custom build any style 
of door panel/pods that your tastes desire suited to accomodate any size 
driver you wish.  Obvioulsy this service is, likewise,  *not* inexpensive, 
but it can yield some of the most attractive aftermarket looks possible.

>2. Will 6.5" speakers fit or am I limited to 5.25"?

Once again, that depends upon whether you want to maintain the factory look 
or opt for a custom installation.  If you prefer to mount directly to the 
factory door panel, you will be limited by the maximum cut-out diameter in 
the door, as well as the max mounting depth available in the door.  If you 
go custom, on the other hand, you will be able to accomodate nearly any size 
driver(s) you want.

>3. I'll probably use Alpine separates in the doors, but my dealer friend has 
>  recommended Boston c700 plates for the rear shelf.  Comments?

I have privately commented several times to others on the list regarding 
rear speakers.  Without going into excessive detail, basically, some people 
like a bit of "rear-fill" to add ambience and "realism" to the sound while 
others prefer no rear speakers at all.  I myself do not prefer any rear-fill 
based around the idea that stereo reproduction demands *two* channels, but 
the debate is highly controversial.  The choice to add rear speakers is 
yours.  I *do not* recommend that you spend excessive amounts of money on 
very hi-fi rear speakers, as it is simply unnecessary and over-kill.  A good 
plan is to add the fronts, listen, and then decide if you want to add the 
rears based on your *own* preferences.  If you do opt to add rears the 
plates should give you good results, and if the Boston's sound good to *you* 
then go for 'em.

>4. I really like a fair amount of bass (I was going to say bottom end, but

If you want good bass, you need a sub(s) and a corresponding amp to drive 
them.  Sub placement is not easy in a 911.  As before, most options involve 
some degree of custom work.  Determine what you want, what you are willing 
to spend, and then consult your local installer.  Recoton also makes a line 
of pre-fab enclosures under the name of "Z-Box" designed for different cars. 
 One model is designed to fit the area below the rear seat of a 911, and 
another is designed to fit the "rear-deck" area above the back of the rear 
seat.  They are not inexpensive, but are a good alternative.  A good 
installer should be able to design small enclosures for under the front 
seats, space permitting.  Lastly, a pro could do a custom installation 
involving a front-trunk mounted enclosure.

If anyone is interested, just let me know what size you are looking for
(single, double etc.) and the style of switch plate:

REGULAR:  has small rectangular switch in the middle and is considered the
most common.

DECORA:  has large rocker style switch and can be found mainly in newer homes.

WALL OUTLETS:  Single: has 2 outlets
               Double: has 4 outlets

If I recall, the track is supposed to be at Philip Island,

   Ummm, I have a slight quibble with your paraphrashing.  Now, I must admit,
I have never read this Newcomb fellow, but I have read some other guy with
a very similar name... gosh what was it? ... Ahh, Newton!  That's it, Newton.
Angular momentum is not conserved in this situation (obviously!).  We are not
talking about an ice skater pulling her arms in while spinning.  The car
spins faster as the axis of the car nears the direction perpindicular to the 
direction of travel because that is where the torque on the car is greatest.
The force is applied to the car by the road through the front tires.  The
(projected) distance of the tires to the CG (i.e., the lever arm) goes as 
the sine of the angle of rotation, hence, maximum at 90 deg.

  Just clarifying the obvious!

Yep, you can get it out...

1) Disconnect the battery.
2) Remove that relay that is keeping it from pivoting.
3) You may have to use a bit of force (prybar) to move the fusebox, there's
   just too much wiring attached for it to move easily...

Joe:

IMHO, I have found that the bias in most 911/930s to be acceptable for the
track.  My car (911 Carrera) wears out rear pads 1/2 as fast as the fronts,
and I can definately feel a difference (poorer braking) when the rear pads
have worn out.  Unless you are RACING and looking for a couple of tenths of a
second per lap, don't worry about trying to add more rear bias on your 930.
 Just make sure that everything is working properly.

However, as a point of information, there are three typical ways to do so.
 If the rules allow, the best way is a dual master cylinder setup (one
cylinder for the front, and one for the rear), with an adjustable balance
bar.  This will allow you to "balance" the pressure to the fronts and rears,
and it will keep that balance all the way through the braking range.  The
more typical way is to install an adjustable proportioning valve; replacing
the existing fixed one.  This will set an upper limit to the pressure that
the rear brakes will see, and will prevent them from getting enough pressure
to lock.  I am not an expert on exactly how these valves work, so that is a
question best left to others.  The final way to adjust brake bias is through
brake pad selection.  This is what most racers have to do if the rules
prohibit any of the above modifications.  By selecting rear pads that produce
more braking effect (at the same pedal pressure) than the fronts, you will
have effectively added more rear brake bias.  This is also an easy way to
"tune" your car for the track, and then set back for the street.  It's best
to discuss this with some of the brake pad reps, and stay with the same brand
of pad, for uniformity.  Some of the more knowlegeable ones should know
exactly what you want to do.

I agree with you, but I also question the reliability.  I own an "87" 944
and personally have had very good luck with the car.  I have put 55,000 miles
on the car, it has 63,000 total miles, and have never been stranded, but I
drive the car in anticipation of something breaking.  What will it be?  The 
water pump, the heater control valve, the ring and pinion, a motor mount,  the
cruise control, a C-V joint,  oil in the antifreeze, ball joints,
 and on and on.  The main quality 
thing that bothers me is the laughable chip guard.  Why did they even bother?
I drove the car in the snow twice and it looks like somebody sandblasted the 
rocker panels and the tuner on the Blaupunkt Reno is the worst I have ever had
the displeasure of listening to.

The funny thing is when I consider what else I would own for what the car
cost me, I go right back to the 944.  The low resale value is to my advantage
because I'll never be able to buy a new one.  In 91 I paid $14,700 for the 
car that was about $30,000 new in "87".  You can't even buy a Honda Accord
for that amount of money.  Maybe a Dodge Neon, but consider that you'll then
be driving a Dodge Neon and I'll take the 944 everytime.  The closest thing
in terms of performance is an Integra VTEC or a Probe GT.  The Integra has
a terrific engine that is not much faster than the 944,  but the handling or
brakes aren't even in the same league.  The Probe rides like a truck has
a better engine and no appeal.  Both are over $20,000, the extra $5000 would
go a long way towards maintaining the 944.
In light of the choices, I'd take the questionable reliability 
and quality everytime.

Between my father and I, we owned a 76 300D for 17 years. It leaked water
into the interior, and the floor boards rusted out. It made 76 HP. The
fenders around the headlights rusted out. The rubber seal around the trunk
disintegrated. The vaccum pump that supplied the power assist to the brakes
died regularly. the pnuematic plumbing leaked, requiring the car to be shut
off manually with a switch under the hood. The A/C pump siezed, and since
the entire system had been added after the car was designed, it required
$700 in labor to remove. The stuffing fell out of the drivers seat. The
clock died. the blower fan siezed. The cruise fried. The lectric antenna
froze. The MANUAL pump for the windshield washer died.

The porsche had a bad clutch from day 1, that eventually failed after 30K
mi, and even though the problem had been reported in writing during the
warranty period (no fault found, duh). I only managed to get "good will"
donation of parts, $900 in labor. The header cracked because some fool
engineer didn't realize that a stainless steel piece bolted to an aluminum
alloy piece would experience differential thermal contraction abd expansion
on every heat cycle and fail. (ok, so it WAS covered)

It seems to me that these cars depreciate enough to buy a new honda
everytime the old one breaks. Of course, if you don't WANT a Honda, you
should shut up and drive. If you're not still smiling when you get there,
you got the wrong car.

Tracy and I discussed this a bit more by email. BTW, dispite Tracy's
attempts at a "T*d of the month" award, he seems like a reasonable guy
by email, and I would expect him to be a bit more circumspect in the way
he offers opinions to the group in the future.

In any case, I think that a very relevant point in the "rear locks first"
scenario under maximum braking conditions is that with something on the
order of a large fraction of 1G applied at the front wheels, several
feet in front of the CG, very substantial torques about the
CG are generated for small angular errors (i.e. if the CG isn't directly
behind the point where the braking force is applied). As the car starts
to rotate, the torque generated by the braking force continues to
increase rapidly as the angle between the force on the CG from braking
and the line to the point where the force is applied increases. In
effect you can transfer a large part of the braking force into rotational
force. Thus you get a VERY fast spin, until the car reaches the stable
position with the CG in front of the wheels applying the braking (i.e
the car is going straight backward).  While stable, this is usually not
what the driver had in mind.

Tracy suggested he doesn't find this to be the case on ice, which is
true, because you can't generate enough braking force on ice to create a
very strong rotational force. It is also different than the trail
braking disucssions, with partial braking and simultaneous turning.

galvanized, I believe that the earliest 912's were "left over" non galvanized
911 bodies from the 75' model year. I have seen no examples of 911 non

Hi All,

On the '67 911S, it came with a wood steering wheel (I dont

There is a black "stripe" on the front/back of the steering wheel.
The "stripe" is centered in the middle of the wood in a
circle.

Does anyone have experience restoring steering wheels and what is
that black circle/stripe?  Is it a stained portion of
the wood - or steel from the supporting infrastructure of
the wheel?  How do you strip/restore the steering wheel
and preserve the black stripe?

I dont want to find out the hard way and just apply some
stripper until I know I can fully restore it.  Its gonna go on
my '66 912 along with the Fuchs I got off the same car.

Thanks,

Reno has pre-amp outs, if so maybe you could borrow another amp and see if
any signals are coming from the preamp.

Mine (on my 944) was easy, there was a small bracket that had to be mounted,

You're in luck. There's somebody on the list advertising Porsche light

Now, what size bra do you take, and do you want the same car laminated into

Subject: Re: Tree sap on my paint! Best way to remove?

Hey Marc,

I'm sure you'll get a great explanation from Larry at Car Care Specialties, 
but here's a little primer until then.  Your only salvation here is the fact 
that the cars are well waxed.  As long as the sap hasn't become rock hard 
and solidified from heat/age on the car then you shouldn't have too much 
difficulty getting it off.  Some careful scrubbing (to avoid scratching) 
with a good amount of dish detergent (Ivory, Dawn, Palmolive, etc.) should 
do the job.  Like Larry says, these are designed to remove amimal fat and 
vegetable oils from dishes, but they should do similar duty to tree sap on 
sheet metal.  The catch is, however, that you *must* re-wax (at least the 
washed area) the car after using such a soap because it will strip the wax 
along with the sap.

If the sap is too stubborn to come off with hefty dish soap, step up to an 
automotive bug and tar remover.  I have also used a 3M product available at 
body shop suppliers called "General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner" with good 
rusults.  This is a rather powerful cleaner that should remove most any 
tar/sap/adhesive/bug deposits from your cars.  Just for extra precaution I 
recommend that you test it with a soft rag on a hidden portion of paint on 
each car to be sure that it is compatible.  Once again, any bug/tar remover 
product will strip wax along with the contaminant.  I recommend that you 
wash the area where the cleaner was used with car-wash solution or dish-soap 
and immediately re-wax the area(s). 

The moral of the story is *don't* park your car(s) under tree sap.  It just 
isn't good for the finish to have the above cycles constantly repeated (not 
to mention a lot of work).

I hope this helps.  Good luck.

Beg to quibble - you can't switch off conservation of momentum.
Angular momentum undeniably IS conserved, like it or not. The
change in angular momentum of the vehicle is equal to the
angular impulse applied (couple integrated over time), which
of course is also applied inversely to the surface the vehicle
is on. So as the car spins up, the earth (or whatever body your
vehicle happens to be spinning on) will spin (much more slowly)
in the opposite direction...

However, this has, as I think you were trying to point out,
nothing whatever to do with the way that the applied couple
on the vehicle varies with angular displacement.

This part is quite correct, although it is possible that the
monent of inertia of the driver is reduced a bit as every sphincter
muscle available get clinched up really hard, this won't have a noticeable
effect on the trajectory.
And to elaborate a bit more, although the bass-ackwards position is
stable when the rears are locked and the fronts are not, it isn't
as if the vehicle will suddenly stop spinning once it gets backwards.
Although the couple between the front wheels and the CG will have
gone to zero, it will have been positive throughout the spin except
at the 90 degree point, where the front wheels operate in 100% slide.
This assumes that the driver has kept the fronts pointed straight ahead,
since your analysis also seems to have so assumed. So as the vehicle
approaches 90 degrees, the couple goes to zero, the rises again
and goes to zero again at 180 degrees. This effect explains why many spins
only go 90 degrees, and many only go 180 degrees. The thing is, though,
that if you make it as far as 180 degrees, you are very likely to
keep going - there was a positive couple applied to the car except for
an instant at 90 degrees, and another instant at 180 degrees. The spin
will only stop at the 90 degree point or the 180 degree point if the
damping in the system dissipates the rotational energy as the stability
point is reached. With big sticky tires, this happens a lot. And if the
driver takes corrective (or defensive) action, it becomes more likely:
once you start spinning in an uncontrolled manner, lock 'em up!
Then you don't get this see-saw rising and falling applied couple, 
and the effect is primarily dissipative.

By the way, it's the conservation of rotational momentum that leads
to the classic "button hook" spin as well - the vehicle begins to
rotate, the driver corrects (accurately, inaccurately, it hardly
matters) and the vehicle comes back into line, and keeps right on
going, resulting in a spin in the other direction. This is because
the driver did not "recover" correctly. The correction stops the
spin and starts the vehicle back towards the proper orientation,
the recovery makes the vehicle stop rotating as it reaches the
proper orientation.

Hi, David,

The arm that holds the mirror has a bracket that slides into the support on
the windshield from above.

The support on the windshield has a couple of prongs that keep the mirror
arm under tension, thus keeping it from wobbling.  Those tend to get bent out
and let the mirror wobble.

To remove the mirror, rock the arm gently, with a twisting motion and a
slight amount of force to lift it up.  The operative word is gently, because,
if you put too much pressure on it, you will break the windshield.

After you remove the mirror, you can see the prongs I'm talking about. You
can then, very gently, with a pair of needlenose pliers, move the prongs
slightly to the front of the car (about .005 inches) to restore the tension 
and tighten your mirror.

If you break the windshield, don't blame me, but it can be done.  You may
want to take a copy of these instructions to your local glass installer and
ask him to do it for you...

Subject: Locking Brakes


As the owner of a 944 and a couple of 924s, I can tell you that these
4 wheel disc brake cars are quite capable of locking ALL four wheels
at once. Especially when being autocrossed or track driven. I have a 
stack of flat spotted Yokohamas to prove this point. 

The problem, as Pete Albrecht touched on, is that locking is an uneven
process. That is, road surface, tire inflation, wheel bearings, tread 
condition, etc. all contribute to the equation. 

Front locking is correctable. Rear locking, especially when the left 
rear locks before the right (the most normal situation) turns the car
with no appeciable method of correction: when it occurs, you are toast,
locked into the direction unless you correct the situation.

This is more critical on the race track, if the unloaded inside tire 
tends to lock, you either slow or risk losing control. Larry Wilson
stated that you brake to the point of minimal lockup. This is true
when racing. You have to understand what the car does. If it locks the 
front brakes, you can predict how deep into a corner you go. If the 
rears lock, then you don't have any confidence in where you're going, 
hence, go slower. On my Shelby GT-350, I set the adjustment on the rear 
brakes to allow the fronts to lock: this was worth 2 seconds at Laguna 
Seca because the car became a more stable platform under braking, I 
could carry more speed in and exit faster as I could take a more 
aggresive line.

The reason we are seeing more ABS is because it tends to correct some of 
the braking problems that occur because of the excessive front weight 
bias of the modern front-wheel drive sedans. It also covers up the use
 of sh*t brake pad material that is being used in place of asbestos
materials. Considering the poor road surfacing in this country and the
poor quality of driver training, ABS is a good thing.

There is a fact to be considered here; most people drive in the same
manner they have sex. They will never approach the limits that will
thrill them driving. I'm glad I don't see them having sex.

If you want a car that locks the rear brakes, buy a 1980 Chevy Citation.

Sounds like you would be a good candidate for the quantity discount on 
Car Covers...

First, don't let the sap sit for any length of time. It will eventually get
so hard that it will remove the paint when you try to remove it...

You can use kerosene, or a bit of gasoline on a soft rag to soften the tar 
and it will come off with a bit of rubbing. Rewax that area immediately 
and find another place to park it...

Subject: question about fender lip texturing and windshield replacement on 911s

Hello everyone,
 I am using Bruce's 911 Performance Handbook, and the info found in this
group to get knowledgeable about 911s before I buy one. 
 While looking at an '86 Carrera this weekend (and trying to appear
knowledgeable to the seller), I noticed that the LF & RF fender lips have 
noticeable texturing, but the LR & RR fender lips (which are much thinner 
than the width of front fender lips) have hardly any texturing. 
 My question to the owners of 84-86 Carreras is this: does your car have less 
than obvious texturing on the rear fender lips than on the front fender lips? 
Or does this car probably have replacement fenders? Its a really clean car 
(inside and out) with low mileage, incomplete documentation, and only one
owner.
 My second question is about windshield replacement: if the seller still has  
the car insured, couldn't he have his insurance company replace the windshield 
(with a 4-6" crack in the lower right corner) for just the cost of his
deductible? Or does a crack have to be in the drivers immediate line of sight
for the insurance company to replace it? I am assuming windshield replacement
on a 911 is probably a couple thousand dollars. I also feel that the bank will
not be happy about loaning me money on a car with a cracked windshield.
Could those of you with recent windshield replacements/estimates verify this 
cost for me? 
                                     thanks in advance,

I theory, all you'd have to do is drill 2 holes on each side of the rear
part of the car in order to bolt up the early bumper.....BUT....

the '75 and '76 have a slightly modified rear trunk floor to accomodate
the bumper shocks.  This new raised area is directly in line with the top
hole you'd have to drill.

I'm going to do this swap anyway, since my car is sitting 3" off the
ground and I don't need any more weight back there.  So I'm going to
weld a stud to my car where the top hole should be drilled and
remove the welded nuts from the top holes on the bumper.  These
welded nuts can be easily removed with a center punch.

Hello all fellow P-philes,

The time is very near that I must log off.  As finals come to a close, and 
move out time approaches, my Internet access will soon be terminated.  I 
have greatly enjoyed the time I have spent on this wonderful list.  There is 
not another group that I can think of that is quite like this one.  I have 
greatly enjoyed answering all the stereo questions that have come my way 
over the months.  I would also like to personally thank each one of you for 
the huge array of public and private knowledge and experiences that you have 
passed on to me.  I feel *much* better armed to make that all important 
Porsche purchase decision.  I hope to be the **proud** new owner of a shiny 
944 at some point in the coming summer months.  So sadly I must go for now, 
but fear not!  I will be back!

Now  a question for you computer types.  I may (time permitting) try to 
rejoin P-philes over the summer.  I have heard good things about AOL, and 
will likely choose their service for Internet access.  Comments, 
Suggestions?  Also, I will need to pick up a modem because our campus-wide 
digital phone system does not require that I have one at present time.  I 
have an IBM PS/Valuepoint 486 computer. I have been seriously considering 
the US Robotics 14.4 Sportster internal modem that I saw for approx. $100.  
Is this a good choice?  Should I look for something different, 
bigger/smaller, better?  I don't want to break the bank for a modem.  Is 
this the best all around choice or would something else suit my needs 
better/cheaper?  This modem will be used at home this summer, as well as 
back here at school come next fall.  Thanks in advance for any help/comments.

Sadly, I say GOODBYE for now......  *THANKYOU* everyone.

i have the following that i need to get rid of:

ANSA rear muffler for early 928. was on a '79, probably fits all
early 928's. used 4 years, no rust, but it is pretty loud and 'rumbly'.

928 exhaust system, headers to final muffler, somewhat modified :-)
this unit is one piece, i simply had the pieces joined when the flange
at the rear of the cat broke. also, the cat has been cut open and
emptied. (by PO).

i'd guess these two mods, plus re-adjusting the CIS, probably adds back
most of the 15hp that the early 928's lost when crossing the atlantic. 
i removed
them, and went back to stock, because i wanted the more civilized sound of
the stock exhaust.

i'd like to get $50 for the whole mess, plus shipping. shipping the muffler
won't be too bad, but the other piece will be a hassle/expensive, as it is
one piece, about 9 feet long.

anybody interested?

P.S. disclaimer: you should only use this 'test pipe' in off-road conditions.

Well, since the most technical info I can provide to the list 
involves the topping off of windshield wiper fluid in a 928, I 
thought the following non-technical anecdotal info would be of 
some value to the list...

This past week, I was finally able to find two days to let the stereo 
installers drop the stock system out of the 928 and put in a good 
one :-).

When I picked the car up, the manager informed me, to my 
surprise, that they had not changed out the front door speakers. 
He indicated that he simply didn't have a better speaker to sell me 
to put in either location. He muttered something about "soft dome 
tweeters" etc, and told me that all they did with the front speakers 
was to assure that they were properly crossed over.

The speakers to the rear of the front seats were replaced with 6.5" 
Canton component speakers; 6.5" woofer and 1" high dome 
tweeter. The 4" speakers in the rear were replaced with Infinity 
RS's. Head unit was replaced with a removeable-faced Sony 
XR-C210, controlling a Sony CDx-51 10 disc changer which is 
mounted in the passenger side rear footwell. All of the speakers 
are being driven from a Mosfet powered, 4 channel  Sony 
XM-2545 amplifier mounted in the stock location (under the 
passenger seat). 

I emphasized fidelity over volume when asking for the system, 
and got it. The system will get loud, no doubt, but is crisp and 
clear. The newly crossed over front speakers sound incredible! I 
had thought that at least one of those front tweeters was trashed; 
indeed it was not, just being muddied up with all the nonessential 
lower frequencies.

The sound is fantastic, the install quality superb, stock finish and 
look totally preserved. Mozart, Clapton, INXS, Stones, etc. have 
all gained new life in my car. Now, if there was room to have sex 
in the car, I could live there.... :-)

I still have the original amp and head unit from the stock system. 
Anyone in need of these? I'm not attached to them and would let 
them go to a fellow enthusiast for shipping plus a beer.

Onward! Now to plan some nice long trips to enjoy the sound 
*and* the car!

Good advice, but I think it would be overkill for me at this point.  I 
realize that the 28.8 will halve access fees when compared to the 14.4, but 
I can't really handle the 2 to 4 times cost of the 28.8.  I will only have 
to *pay* for access for the next three and a half summer months.  After that 
I will regain free access via my university.  Grated, the slower modems are 
more of a pain to use, but I am willing to accept a bit of inconvenience in 
order to save a few *hundred* bucks.  Remember, I'm a poor college student!  
I assume that when I need a faster modem in a couple years when I have to 
pay for all access, that the 28.8 will be obsolete as well.  Is that a valid 
assumption?  BTW, I'm a little behind on my computer acronyms, so what is an 
ISDN connection?  Is that where comm connections is going in the future?

Thanks again.

Subject: MagBra

DH993@aol.com recommends the MagBra and I heartily agree with this 
recommendation, with one caveat.  I have a black magbra on a black car 
and on two occasions it has clouded the paint.  The two occasions were 
during extended driving on a very hot day, 95F+.  At least that's my 
theory.  After removing the magbra i noticed that the paint was cloudy.  
It turned out to not be the wax and required extensive buffing out with 
a very light polishing compound.

Otherwise, I am very pleased with my magbra.  It goes on and off very 
easily so one isn't tempted to just leave it on; and I never get any 
abrasion from flapping as sometimes happens with cloth bras.

Is it the paint on my car?  I dunno, but the car was repainted by 
previous owner and maybe a poor quality paint was used.  Maybe somebody 
else can explain, I went to a couple of body shops and asked them about 
the phenomena and didnt' get any reliable information.  Can I solve the 
problem by painting the MagBra silver or white?  I don't know but plan to 
try before the hot weather arrives this summer.  Too bad, because the 
black color matches fairly well with my car and so the bra is not so 
noticeable.

Note: the MagBra vendor warns owners that using the MagBra after a rain 
can cause clouding of the wax, but I don't think that was my problem 
since corrections required extensive buffing.

Hi Jason,

Maybe I'm reading more into this than I should, but it sounds to me like
two bad things here:

1)  You haven't had this car inspected by a pro (cost $200-300).  I hope I'm 
wrong, but if I'm right, I'd advise doing that at once.  The report, with a 
cost of the necessary repairs, becomes a negotiating tool.

2)  This car hasn't received the kind of care you want the previous owner of
a 911 to exercise.

If that's the case, I'd take a walk.  There's lots of 86 Carreras out there,
and if you think you're getting this car at a price that's too good to be
true, it probably is...

     My experience with valve adjustment (Porsche and VW 4 cyl) has been 
     that it is the valve that is loose relative to the others that you

Subject: Rolling fender lips

I replied to AnalogMike privately, and he thought I should share this
item, so here goes:

Rolling the rim of the fender, to prevent the inside edge from
catching on the tire, is recommended if your car has been lowered
and/or if you're using wider than stock tires (as most people with
older cars are now doing).  It's a touchy process, but a good shop can
do it without requiring repaint.  I had it done to my '75 in '88
(paint was original) with no problem.  They sealed it with clearcoat
just to make sure.

IMO, it's worth it to seek out a shop that has experience doing this,
and I'd definitely not try it at home.  A suspension shop with Porsche
experience probably has a regular place where they send their cars.
When Dwight Mitchell was in Sacramento he used Fabrication
Specialties, and that's who did mine.

Subject: 912 broken crank?

Just as I was getting my 912 running strong again... on the way home last
Friday night (~45 mph, 3rd gear, light throttle), I heard/felt a loud knock.
Then, the gearshift popped into neutral and the engine stopped.  Hmmm.

I coasted to the side of the road, rolled to a stop, and assessed the matter.
I got out and looked underneath, and noticed a few ounces of oil on the
ground from around the bell housing.  Hmmm.

With the clutch pedal depressed (gee, less resistance than usual), I turned 
the starter... it engaged the flywheel and _sounded_ like it was turning
the flywheel, but it was NOT turning the engine.  Hmmm.

My neighbor tow-roped me home (1/2 mi).  The car rolled free, and I could
still work through the gears (tranny okay?).  Hmmm.

I put a big wrench on the crank pulley and tried to turn it.  Crank frozen
solid.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

With the gearshift in 1st and clutch pedal OUT, starter tries to roll the
car along.  Driveline seems okay.

My trusted mechanic replaced the clutch disc a few months ago.

Ideas?

My first thought was that the flywheel is sheared from the crankshaft.  Yuck.

I stopped in to see my mechanic this morning, and he thinks the crankshaft is
broken.  "$5k-6k" to put it back together (I need new P+B's, too).

I called another trusted mechanic (Denny Akers, Seattle).  He thinks my
mechanic didn't tighten the gland nut and that it came out and caused this
all to occur.  (???)  He further said that the crank can probably be machined 
(where the dowel pins go?).  Sounds like my mechanic would be liable for 
this?  Yes, no, and why?

If this is NOT warranty work, I'm looking at having to sell the car as is
and trade up to a late 70s/early 80s 911SC.

Thanks for your help.

  OFFICE MEMO         73.5 911T coupe                       Date:  5/8/95

I'm very closing to buying a 73.5 911T coupe and I have a few
questions.  Sorry if these have been covered recently.

1) What can be done to quiet the common creaks and groans due to
the hard (silicone?) bushings?  The car is very tight and free of
strange noises except for this.  E.g., are grease fittings possible?

2) Window cranks are a pretty stiff.  Anyone had good success
with this?

3) Rubber recommendations and sizes?  The car has the original
Fuchs and new Riken 185/70-15's (OEM tire).  Front lips have
been rolled.

4) How hot is hot?  (I've forgotten Bruce's rule and I gave my
Performance Handbook to my brother.)  I saw 200 on a 70 degree
day with some hard driving.  No front fender oil cooler.  What's
the advisable upgrade?  Cost?

For those interested, I'm considering paying more than the going
price given it's condition.  The owner has spent $20k over the last
three years, rebuilding the tranny and engine (a 2.7 upgrade with
the right rebuild including proper studs, inserts, chain tensioners,
etc.), replacing the clutch, restoring the interior and all seals and
rubber, and striping and repainting.  No thermal reactor (it passes
smog for a '73 w/o it).  No A/C.  The inspection went well, only 8%
leakdown on all cylinders, very minimal oil seepage, no signs at
all of rust or body damage, and some really nice improvements
like stainless steel SSI heat exchangers, adjustable Weltmeister
suspension, new shocks, front pan, torsion bars, sealed battery,
and straight original Fuchs with new tires.

Is $11k too much?  My instincts tell me I could get there fast with
a lesser car for $8k or so.

Thanks for any input.

Yes, an EXHAUST leak in a heat exchanger can cause a huge power loss
in an early MFI 911. It can also cause a huge loss of life if you breathe the
fumes through your heater. 

Try hard to get it repaired BEFORE you buy it or it could be a huge 
headache. It's easy to brake exhaust studs/bolts, or the lack
of power may not go away due to other problems. A '73 T should not 
be sluggish.

>Any ideas on probable cause?

You noticed the exhaust leak in sound only, or visually? Probably rust.

>Also: what should compression be? 

Probably 120 or so, within 10 pounds cylinder to cylinder would be OK.

Subject: 914 bushing removal -done!

Hi all,

	Well, I finally accomplished the threatening task of removing my
trailing arm bushings. I couldn't find all the parts I needed to make my
nifty puller, so I wound up dragging my trailing arms over to a machine
shop and used their press to remove the shafts. EASY! And clean too, the
bushings came right out with the arms. Definately worth the hassle of
loading them into the stand-by car and spending the paltry $30 for the shop
time.

	I havn't installed the new bushings yet, so I can't say it's all
been fun and games so far. 

	On an unrelated note. While I have the engine out to replace my
flywheel seal and epoxy my galley plugs, I've decided to upgrade my oil
pump and relief pistons. For those of you who are thinking of doing this
and have only the haynes manual to guide you, IT LIES! The book says that
the second releif piston is located on the driver side just under the oil
breather. WRONG! It's actually located inbetween the pushrod tubes near the
back of the engine. It's also a huge 12pt socket head bolt. As it turns out
, it's a 3/8" triple square, and a 3/8" extension fits very nicely :).

Hmmm...what year is the subject car? (Assuming it is a 944...)

Anyhow, there is no oil cooler update per se.

If you are wondering whether or not your car is susceptible to oil cooler
seal failures, if the car is a 1987 or newer 944, then you might have the
problem...

If there is no oil in the water, and no water in the oil, then you don't
have the problem.

If you just have an oil leak near the oil cooler housing, then it is
probably some other source (e.g. cam tower, oil pressure gauge sender, head
gasket, etc.)

Clean the area around the oil leaks and see if you can isolate the problem.

Of course, I could be totally wrong...

You want the car to corner flat enough to maintain optimal tire position
through the turn. I thought I could just get monster sway bars too. I got
the 30/24mm bars from Andial. With the big tires, I still rubbed on the
inside (rear) fenderwell, i.e. too much body roll. Now I'm getting the
turbo cup suspension, which has 80 # rear springs, where the original was
just torsion bars (no springs). I'm afraid the conclusion is that stiff
sway bars are not enough. Bummer, man.

(ATTENTION CITIZENS: This is not a flame job. Had this been an actual flame
job, you would have been directed to tune in a radio station in your area.
Once again, this is not a flame job. We now return to your regularly
scheduled programming.)

I was pretty amazed by the stuff in Newcomb's book too. But it makes sense.
You have to consider the instantaneous center of rotation, something I
haven't done since I passed the final exam in the freshman statics and
dynamics course. 

The instantanous center of rotation is located way off in the weeds
somewhere, maybe many yards from the car itself. A car going straight down
the road with no rotating force has its instantaneous center at infinity.
Once it sets up a yaw angle (either spinning or cornering normally, you have
a yaw angle) the center moves inward. The instantaneous center in this case
is determined by the intersection of the perpendicular to the car's path and
a line through the front axle. Newcomb says angular momentum is conserved
around this center, not the CG of the car. The couple operates around the CG,
but momentum is conserved around the instantaneious center, As the car comes
to 90 degrees, that center moves in and the car has to spin faster to
conserve momentum. 

Or so he says. 

I tend to believe him because he has written many papers on brake system
design. Anytime anybody uses armloads of differential equations to describe
anything two things happen: 1) I tend to believe them and 2) I leave the room
and look for a simpler solution in a handbook somewhere. His credentials are
(were) D. Sc, F. Inst. P., C. Eng., A.M.I. Mech. E., principal research
officer, Ferodo Ltd.

He says the locus of the center of rotation describes "approximately a cusped
tractrix." (No, I don't know either. I thought tractrix was someting like
Danny Sullivan doing two of these in succession and going on to win Indy.)
Looks like a parabola to me.

My scanner is not scanning or I would scan the nifty diagram in the book and
upload it. I could fax it to you.

BTW I have never accepted money for flame jobs. I do this on my own time. I

bit firm but the perofrmance compared to older tires (Michelins circa 1986)
was quite noticable.  Perhaps the 15" versions would work nicely for you as
well.

Not familiar with your set-up, but it seems to me that with an EZBleed
your quart of brake fluid might now be resting in your trunk or
footwell...  I too have some frustrations with the mity-vac (see
post last month), but I've decided that any method that makes every air
bubble in the system swell to 5 times its normal size, thus rendering it
that much more likely to be bled out of the system, is the method that I
want to use.  I realize this viewpoint is not shared by knowledgeable
pros... but hey, that's why I'm an amateur at this!

Subject: 911-Front Strut Replacement Question

Hey,

I'm in the middle of replacing the 19-year old Boges on
the front of my 911.  Fellow pfile John Goodman suggested
I get a big set of Channel-Locks to get the nut that holds
the insert into the housing loose.  Of course I decided to
try it anyway (without the Channel-Locks).  Before I go
buy them, does anyone have a neat trick for getting this
nut loose?  BTW, I'm doing this with the strut in the car,
so please, no advice that begins "put the strut in your 
vise...".  :>)

Also, BTW, I am replacing my Boges with Konis (red) - you
folks would have gotten a kick out of seeing me trying to
compress the rear ones with one hand and getting the bottom
bolt started with the other (while laying on my side under
the car).  My wife had to keep reminding me that there were 
young children around...

Man, this is fun!!

Subject: Updated Alloy Listing

Hi Gang:

Well, Royce got the BBS's so I've had to update my "Alloys" listing.  Turbos...
don't worry, we've got an extra set of track wheels for you.  While I was over
looking at the BBS's I came across another pair of Fuchs for the Turbo crowd.
Here's what I've got:

(2) 7x16 Fuchs
(2) 9x16 Fuchs

Both with the Turbo Offset.  These were off a stock turbo.  Now's your chance to
get the real thing for the price of Replicas.  Sold as a set only these wheels
will go for $1,200

I also found a set of 928 wheels.  These are "Chromed" flat face 928 wheels.
They were chromed about a year ago and they look great.  They'll come with
Pirelli's for $1,300 for the set of 4.

I still have (4) 6x15 Fuchs.  I've gotten a few commitments but no firm answer
back yet.  These wheels are in great shape with 185/70 VR P6's.  The Pirelli's
have a ton of tread left.  The first $600 gets the entire set of 4.

Comfort Group 14's are going for $75.00 each.  I've got 2 complete sets of 5
which include the spare.  Let me know if you're interested.  These would be
great for the 914 owners that might want to drill their rotors.

Give me a buzz if you have any questions.

Hmmmm, the bad news is, that's not tree sap, it's aphid pee!  At least
in my experience with your basic broadleaf deciduous tree in warm
weather.  You'll probably prefer to keep thinking of it as tree sap :-).
The good news is, it is about as water soluble as maple syrup, i.e.
very.  Try lukewarm water before you try any of the more agressive
solvents already suggested.   Used to work like a charm on my '64
Fairlane when I had to park under the ol' tuliptree.

Now if you're parked under a pine or other conifer and you've got big
globs of pine resin coming down, well then, NOW you've got trouble.  An
equal mix of turpentine and elbow grease WILL take it off... but your
paint will look so bad you'll wish it hadn't.  Time for a car cover!

Subject: 914 Rear Springs - Revisited

Thanks to all who responded re the direction of installation of 914 rear
springs (I foolishly took mine off without noticing direction).  It looked as
though there could be no UP or DOWN to them, but my paranoia always gets the
best of me.  My VERY lucky experience with spring compressors will not happen
again, since my good friend Jon Lowe reminded me that a spare tire/wheel does
a much safer job, and works just as well.

One item should be brought to the attention of other 914 owners.  I was
changing from Konis to Boge.  The front was complete, and the shocks were a
gift 2 years ago, so I don;t remember where they came from(i.e - couldn't
send them back).  Guess what?  You can't fit Boges without having a BOGE
lower spring retainer ring - the Koni ring is way too big!  OK, some may say
 - Why change to Boge from Koni?  Easy, I'm tired of having my kidneys turned
to puree after a 150 mile trip!  This is a concours car, not an autocrosser.

I checked several sources for the Boge retainers - all said they did not
stock, and would have to get them from Reno.  BEST price was $95 - EACH!
 Well, I got lucky, and found some used ones nearby, refinished them, and
saved myself $175!  Shop around, shop around, sho.....

Anyway, thanks again to all who helped.  Hope I can do the same someday.
Anyone need some beautifully refinished Koni/Bilstein lower spring retainers?

	Now the questions:

	Do the wires that plug in by the fuel injectors go on a certain way?
The male end seems to have only one way to go in, but the female end (on the

I had a dying problem on my old SC...turned out to be a loose fuel pump relay. 
 Pushing it in firmly solved the problem. (just an idea)

RE: brake locking.  You definitely want the fronts to lock first!  When I had 
my 914-6, I adjusted the brake bias (garretson adjustable) until the fronts 
locked before the rears.  Never had a problem on the street or track. (Guy 
Allen now has the car. I think it has been fine for him too.)

If the rears lock first, you will spin unless you are on dead level ground and 
perfectly straight and the car is real well balanced.

My A/c Blower motor is on its way out.  I remember reading about repairing

to pay the big bucks & buy a new motor for the inside blower.  Any info
would be appreciated.

Symptoms:
 sometimes a/c doesn't blow on low.  High pitch sound when I apply the
brakes,  this causes the fan to push foward (sounds like bearing or bushing
in motor).   Motor blows fast & then slows down intermittently.

Well, the Club race at Mid-Ohio is history.  Two great days with great
weather, with EXCELLENT racing.   Amazing how the series has matured over the
past three years.

Fastest car in the field was Dave Finch's 944S GT-2 SCCA car.  It currently
holds the lap record at Mid-Ohio for SCCA in GT-2, and he was running at
record pace.  He was in Class C1 with a normally aspirated car, but he was
faster than ANY of the B or A class cars, including John Paul Jrs. old 935!
He turned a 1:33.9 in qualifying and 1:35's in the race. 

For those of you wondering how the 13/13 rule is working out:  It works well.
Most of the weekends incidents were from cars dropping oil either through
leaking oil coolers or blown engines, not from car to car hits.  People who
hit someone else (two that I know of) and were at fault were sent packing for
the weekend.

Several cars, already prepped, were for sale; if you are thinking about
racing, go to a race and see what is available for reasonable prices.

Apparently, PCA had a great idea, as BMW CCA and the Ferrari Club are both
emulating what PCA has done. SCCA missed a LARGE untapped market in this
case.

Got to get busy and get that trailer and tow vehicle so Nancy and I can

I was at my local VW AUDI dealer today to pick up some parts and couldn't 
help noticing a very shiny black 356A on the showroom floor.  I asked the 
dealer about the car and was told the following:  (I am not an expert on 
356's so bear with me if the information appears to be incorrect)

The VIN is 106817 
The car is black with red interior.
The car has coachwork by Reutter and is in very good condition.  It was 
originally purchased locally by a local doctor (Edmonton, Alberta) and 
serviced by the dealer with full records until sold to a second owner.  It 
was repainted about 20 years ago and was never driven in winter.  Aside from 
some minor imperfections it does not show it's age.  The chrome work is in 
excellent shape including the hubcaps (not a ding or scratch).  The interior 
is in similar (good) shape.  The engine compartment looks extremely clean. 
The asking price is $32000 CDN ($22400 US).  Mileage is 80000+ miles.  I am 
posting this for the information of the list and have no idea if the price 
asked is reasonable or outrageous.  Those of you who may be interested in 
the car can Email me directly and I will put you in touch with the dealer.

  OFFICE MEMO         73.5 911T coupe                       Date:  5/8/95

I'm very closing to buying a 73.5 911T coupe and I have a few
questions.  Sorry if these have been covered recently.

1) What can be done to quiet the common creaks and groans due to
the hard (silicone?) bushings?  The car is very tight and free of
strange noises except for this.  E.g., are grease fittings possible?

2) Window cranks are a pretty stiff.  Anyone had good success
with this?

3) Rubber recommendations and sizes?  The car has the original
Fuchs and new Riken 185/70-15's (OEM tire).  Front lips have
been rolled.

4) How hot is hot?  (I've forgotten Bruce's rule and I gave my
Performance Handbook to my brother.)  I saw 200 on a 70 degree
day with some hard driving.  No front fender oil cooler.  What's
the advisable upgrade?  Cost?

For those interested, I'm considering paying more than the going
price given it's condition.  The owner has spent $20k over the last
three years, rebuilding the tranny and engine (a 2.7 upgrade with
the right rebuild including proper studs, inserts, chain tensioners,
etc.), replacing the clutch, restoring the interior and all seals and
rubber, and striping and repainting.  No thermal reactor (it passes
smog for a '73 w/o it).  No A/C.  The inspection went well, only 8%
leakdown on all cylinders, very minimal oil seepage, no signs at
all of rust or body damage, and some really nice improvements
like stainless steel SSI heat exchangers, adjustable Weltmeister
suspension, new shocks, front pan, torsion bars, sealed battery,
and straight original Fuchs with new tires.

Is $11k too much?  My instincts tell me I could get there fast with
a lesser car for $8k or so.

Thanks for any input.

with this?

3) Rubber recommendations and sizes?  The car has the original
Fuchs and new Riken 185/70-15's (OEM tire).  Front lips have
been rolled.

4) How hot is hot?  (I've forgotten Bruce's rule and I gave my
Performance Handbook to my brother.)  I saw 200 on a 70 degree
day with some hard driving.  No front fender oil cooler.  What's
the advisable upgrade?  Cost?

For those interested, I'm considering paying more than the going
price given it's condition.  The owner has spent $20k over the last
three years, rebuilding the tranny and engine (a 2.7 upgrade with
the right rebuild including proper studs, inserts, chain tensioners,
etc.), replacing the clutch, restoring the interior and all seals and
rubber, and striping and repainting.  No thermal reactor (it passes
smog for a '73 w/o it).  No A/C.  The inspection went well, only 8%
leakdown on all cylinders, very minimal oil seepage, no signs at
all of rust or body damage, and some really nice improvements
like stainless steel SSI heat exchangers, adjustable Weltmeister
suspension, new shocks, front pan, torsion bars, sealed battery,
and straight original Fuchs with new tires.

Is $11k too much?  My instincts tell me I could get there fast with
a lesser car for $8k or so.

Thanks for any input.

Subject: Cronar Paint

Yepper, Cronar is great stuff.  It is currently available as a DuPont product
called Chromabase.  Slightly reformulated to reduce the VOC's.  Color match
is exceptional and metallic striping is almost non-existant.  I like to use it
over the DuPont Uro primer.  The build is excellent and it sticks so hard that
your hands won't be clean for a week.  If you have any corrosion at all,
consider DuPont's Variprime as a first coat.  

I shoot everything out of my old DeVilbiss JGA-502 with an 80 head except
for the clearcoat.  I use a 30 head for that since the stuff seems to squirt
like water.  I'll often shoot it a little below recommended pressure to help
save paint (this suff is expensive!).  Of course, if I had an HVLP gun it 
wouldn't even be an issue (saving).

Hope this doesn't sound like a DuPont ad.  I don't have any interest with
them except for using products that work (and believe me, I've tried them
all).

I know all the folks in California are green with envy 'cause here in Missouri
we can still shoot our own paint.  (Big ol <G>).

Hi everyone,     
     On page 127 of European Car's June 1995 issue is a conception of the
next 911 (dubbed 996).  It has a much cleaner line across the top (which I'm
not sure I like), and a much more modern appearance.  Looks like some of that
"cab forward thinking" made it across the Atlantic.  Anyone else seen it?
 What do you think?  I'm not so sure....It sort'a reminds me of a Mitsubishi.

Subject: Re: Porsche Quality--Low


On the subject of the Porsche 993 vs MB SL. This is a real
chalk and cheese debate. It would be better to compare the
SL with other contenders in the same bracket, like Aston, 
Bentley or similar marques because they have a common configuration 
and mission ie huge, heavy, powerful, luxury trucks!

I don't want to get Lucinda, her `cello, two sets of golf clubs, 
and a weeks worth of luggage in my car, and out cool the other 
people on the `bahn to boot, for me the thrill factor in this
scenario is rather low.

No, I want to go and scratch down empty country roads,
spattering bugs, snapping the back out on the bends and locking it 
down with the power, playing tunes on the flat six. I want the 
excellent roaring music of an air-cooled boxer, as it cycles up to
maximum torque, I want to hear the hot tires chattering as I fight
for maximum deceleration, I want the smell of hot metal and oil,
I want the heavy thump, thump as my low 911 surfs over the irreglarities
with all the forgiving and comfortable ride of a skateboard, I want
the quite "tick, tick" sound of the hot exhaust and metal contracting
after power off. 

People who don't want these should purchase an MB, or a Lexus or
and Aston or a similar fine motor car. Low thrill factor, high
component of luxury, fast on the autobahn, high status, and not
for me.

For the airheads out there, I saw the Bf109 "Black Six" flying at
Duxford yesterday. "Black Six" is the only original German manufactured
Bf109 I understand. It is complete with the supercharged Damiler-Benz 
engine and it took twenty years to get it flying again, and I feel very 
lucky to have seen it. Yesterday they had it flying formation with "Black 
Two", a Spanish license built Bf 109 and also the P51 and Spitfire IX from 
The Fighter Collection, magic stuff. The sight and sound were truly 
sensational.

So the trade-off is that the stiffer the anti-roll bar the more you are
moving away from an independent suspension.  From this I would have to say
the proper compromise would be track dependent?  Stiffer springs for bumpy
tracks and stiffer roll bars for smooth tracks?

I've been reading this list for a couple of weeks and it sure looks

I've got a problem to add to the bandwidth maybe somebody out there
has solved before...

I'm trying to get the right side window on a '76 911S Targa to seal
completely.  I've done all the adjusting and the window angle now
matches the rear side seal very nicely.  The problem is that the
window is sitting about 1/4 inch too far forward in the door.  The
door is already adjusted perfectly, the window must have been replaced
at some time in the past and not set properly.

Has anyone moved the side window position?  I'm hoping the thing isn't
glued in place...  I wanted to ask for tips and tricks before I tackle this.

Thanks for any help!

Subject: Cheap rubbers, the sequel...

Hi all,

Since I am about to pop for a complete set of rubber for my 73'911 Targa
($$$$), I was very interested in the latest thread on rubbers.

Currently, I am considering buying the rubbers from International
Mercantile of Del Mar, CA. They have been a long advertiser in Pano and
Excellence so I am not too concerned with their request for cash up
front... (no credit cards)

They sell OEM rubbers and reproductions made out of DuPont E.P.D.M.
(Nordel) or DuPont neoprene.

Their price was reasonable (cheap?) being below Tweeks. But I am worried
that in the recent thread, nobody mentioned them as an option?

Is this because of a lack of knowledge or problems in the past????

Any comments appreciated.

Mike,
   I did the same on my 66. Here's a quick tip. After you are ready to turn
the nut with the channel locks (I used a pipe wrench!) place the top of the
strut insert back into the top of the fender and secure it with the old nut.
This assumes that you have removed the dust cover. I have found this to be 
the best way to secure the strut assembly and put torque on the nut. BTW if
you go with Bilsteins most I have done come with the proper wrench. I am
satisfied with my Konis.

    I'm in the middle of replacing the 19-year old Boges on
    the front of my 911.  Fellow pfile John Goodman suggested
    I get a big set of Channel-Locks to get the nut that holds
    the insert into the housing loose.  Of course I decided to
    try it anyway (without the Channel-Locks).  Before I go
    buy them, does anyone have a neat trick for getting this
    nut loose?  BTW, I'm doing this with the strut in the car,
    so please, no advice that begins "put the strut in your 
    vise...".  :>)

The last time I replaced strut inserts I just used a big pipe wrench (I had
one, and didn't have a pair of Channel-locks big enough).  One thing to try
is wrapping a piece of inner tube or an old rubber glove or something around
the nut.  Mine were pretty badly crusted, so I really had a time getting them
off, and I really scratched them both up.  A rubber glove or something in there
can save your finish and give you a better grip.

Good luck!

    My own preference is PPG's DP-90 epoxy primer. Variprime will stick to
 anything but it won't hold back moisture. DP-90 is excellent as both a
 base primer and a sealer. Maybe the best stuff on the market.

    Is this true (about California ?) Is it impractical/illegal for anyone to
 spray in their garage ? I didn't realize that the VOCs are such a big issue,
 til I tried to buy Deltron yesterday and was told its been discontinued 
 because of this.  The red Concept urethane I got instead will cost $80 a  
 quart once catalyzed ! Even more expensive than Glasurit !

    Not to say that I -should- have a right to fog up the neighborhood with
 isocyanates...but if Water-based paints are the future (which dry slowly and
 require a class 100 clean room...) then it looks like the days of painting
 at home are certainly numbered...

Subject: 911SC's and CB's and Windshield Wipers

Folks,

I remember way back that a few individuals had the same problem that I had.  
You owned a 911SC, had a CB radio that was powered through the cigarette 
lighter, and your windshield wipers went on every time you keyed the mic.  
Finally tired of those annoying wipers and REAL tired of getting little 
scratches in the glass (from dry wiper action) I decided to solve this.

First, you may be aware that in a 911SC the cigarette lighter is on the same 
fuse circuit as the windshield wipers.  So my first guess was that this was 
somehow related to the problem.  So, I rewired the CB through the radio power 
circuit and voila!  No more wipers.  Not sure of the actual reason why the 
wiper relay was getting tripped.  Actually don't really care anymore.

If you're still interested in having a removable radio and don't want to 
"hardwire" your to the car do what I did.  Pick up a set of "banana" connectors 
at your local electrical supply.  Solder a pair (I chose the male ones for the 
CB side) to the CB wires and solder the receiving pair to the other half of the 
connection.  This gives you a quick disconnect / reconnect.

We can shoot our own here in California too. All the usual brands are

a dozen paint suppliers who specialize in restorers and the hot rod industry
within a half hour of my house. 

I can do anythinng I want in my driveway or garage, and until now there
hasn't been any problem getting the stuff.

What you can't do (easily) is open up a commercial repaint facility. Then the
Air Nazis come in and make you do all sorts of stupid shop tricks. I think
there would be a great market possibility for opening a shop in San Diego
that just takes in laundry, as it were, loads it on a flatbed and trucks it
across the border to Tijuana where you can do anything you want to it. (Oh,
oh, here come the AirNetNazis, telling me that if it's bad for the air in
California, it is just as bad in Tijuana and what if the winds are from the
south... go stick it.)

I know of too many firms that have just given up on California's
anti-industry attitude and gone away. Just last week I was shopping for quotes
 for some aluminum forging. One shop in squeaky-clean Irvine said they don't
do Al anymore because the process develops lots of smoke, and the city would
want them to install treatment. So they just do titanium which doesn't
produce smoke. Another firm I know of turned out automatic screw machine
products. The machines (basically automatic lathes) inevitably had some small
oil leaks (not spills, just the sort of thing you find under your 911). The
Dirt Nazis wanted the shop to dig up all of the floor of the plant and haul
it off to a dump. The shop said "stick it" (it was leased space) and
relocated to Colorado.

Depends on what you mean.  My drivers side window winder used to sort
of bind halfway up.  I think they tend to get bent over time,
especially if you crank it hard against the stop.  I got in, took the
hardware out, and bent it back straight, and it's been OK since.  You 
can also lube it some while you're there...

Subject:      Finally bought a porsche

Hi all,

Well a couple of months ago I was about to buy a 1974 porsche 
911 with a sportomatic transmission or a 1971 911T .  Thanks to this 
list I reevaluated my choices and yesterday bought a 1981 911SC 
Targa with 123,000 miles on it for $7,600.  I had the car, as advised on 
this list, checked out by a respected Porsche mechanic for -yep as the 
you all suggested $100.  The mechanic -Ralph of Ralph's in 
Reisterstown MD, spent two hours going over the car.  Leak down test, 
compression test, rust inspection etc passed within better than usual 
limits.

I was debating between a 928S and a 911, but after driving both cars 
and listening to advice from this list I decided I really wanted the 911.

Anyway the car I purchased does have a few problems:

* The paint is really stone chipped on the hood and front fenders and is 
scratched and has two minor dents

* The leather seats and dash are really scuffed up, and the drivers side 
seat is ripping at one corner and on the left edge.  The leather steering 
wheel is rather scuffed.

* The radio barely works.

* The oil return tubes are leaking and it's going to cost $600 to replace 
them.  Is this a job to be done at home?

* The oil pressure swith is leakin oil 

* There is some sort of leak from the pipes (rer end of car) going to the 
oil cooler

* The car does not leave any oil on the ground but it is visible all 
around the bottom of the engine. 

* Needs smile

* Speedo only goes to 85mph -yuk!

The owner didn't even bother to clean the car so it looks really scruffy 
especially with the dark blue interior and metallic pacific blue exterior.  
Is this color paint available at porsche dealer for touch up?

All records are there -The clutch has been replaced twice.  Last at 
97,000mi with new throwout bearings.  The blower box blew at 28,000 
and a new one with a popper valve was installed.  There has been 
some body work on the right door and left rear fender all done by 
porsche dealers.  Both heat exchangers have been replaced.  


The chain tensioner has not been updated and the mechanic didn't 
think I should change it.  Should I?


Did I get a good deal?  The owner was asking $9700 initially when he 
first advertised and then $8700.

you should remember that like every thing else porsche you have to work 
lying on your back.

You have my sympathy, I had the same problem about 6 months ago mine 
being rhd was slightly easier, however I still managed to trap a nerve in 
my shoulder lying head under dash feet sticking out the window, I have 
found that the the fuse panel once dropped then needs your head up the 
right way, or the wires are too close for my eyes to focus down 

PS suggest you take off the battery earth strap before you start playing, 
or you can start an expensive wire fire!!

Tangent to the subject at hand, I do not know the identifying features of
various shocks and struts, and am in need of a little education.  The '76
chassis I picked up has yellow shocks in the rear and green shocks and
green struts up front.  I was told all four were konis.

I used PPG DP-90 last fall when reconditioning my chassis.  I agree that it
is excellent stuff - dries fast.  When I asked at the paint shop about its
sealant properties, I was told you could slap a coat on a car and leave it
in the rain without worry.  Really easy to work with.

I asked the same question a month or so ago, no problem.  I
used a large pipewrench and it worked just fine.  Just use
some penetrant (Liquid Wrench or ??) to make sure they'll
come loose and "Just Do It."  It helps to have a friend
holding the bottom of the housing steady - but, otherwise the
steering stuff will eventually stop the rotating.

I used my floor jack to compress the new shocks in the rear whilst
I got the bolt/nut started - a little easier.  My claim to fame
came when I applied 120 ft lbs to a brake caliper to get a piston
out and now have a significant hole in the garage's drywall - those suckers
can really fly!  Now I clamp 'em to a piece of 2x4 so they dont
go very far.

  OFFICE MEMO         Inspection shops in the Bay Area      Date:  5/9/95


Trond,
I've been to most of the better garages out here, including all the
dealers, Garretson's (when it was around), Carrera Tech, T&D
Performance, and Ken's SportTech, all in Campbell.  I think any of
the above will do a decent job, including Tom Heyer's shop (Heyer
Performance?) in Mtn View (whom Stan likes).  But when I am the
one paying for the inspection (instead of the other way around)
there's only one shop I trust: RMG Enterprises.  This is a one man
operation, run by Bob Grigsby.  Bob has been working on air-cooled
Porsches for over twenty years and is clearly one of the best in
California.  Every shop I've been to knows him, many consult with
him regularly, and everyone has great things to say about him.  He
spent several years with dealers and Garretson's, but has been on
his own for 10 years or so.  I've taken all my cars to him for the
last seven years and I've never been disappointed.  The only
negative I can imagine is that he's a bit more expensive than most
places.  But then Bob does *all* the work himself.  No grunts ever
touch your car.

Bob can be reached at (408)-738-2060.  He's off El Camino Real
and Mary in Sunnyvale.  He'll charge about $100 for a thorough
checkout, including the leakdown.

Incidentally, Bob's wife, Linda Grigsby (aka, Linda Piccone) is
some sort of Porsche parts celebrity.  She works at Carlsens, a
Porsche dealer in Palo Alto, and is well known as one of the best
parts experts around.

And if you or anyone else is looking for a great 63 Super 90 ask
him about the one he just finished restoring.  Looks brand new
everywhere.  Upgraded to 4 wheel discs, 12 v., and intermittent
wipers (so no concours but a great street car).  Cream lacquer.
3000 hours.  Awesome car.  $22k.

I had a pin shear in mine, had to take the window and regulator out
to replace it. You might be able to free things up by spraying the
window felt tracks with silicone spray. If that doesn't work, remove
the door panels and lube the horizontal metal track with WD-40
or something similar. There is a nylon slipper foot that rides in
it and mine was clogged with old hardened grease.

11K sounds a bit steep considering what I've seen in the paper,
but you are right, you would easily spend that much trying to
get a lesser car into shape.

Clearly this group has if nothing else the distinction of some cleverly 
humorous members whose commentaries I've enjoyed reading.  I thought 
perhaps I would provide a little light passage myself, excerpted from an 
official Japanese guide for English-speaking drivers from 1936.  No racial 
or cultural insult is intended here.  And those of you who like to 
accelerate around the corners, pay extra close attention to number 5! 
     
1.  At the rise of the hand of the policeman, stop rapidly.  Do not pass 
him or otherwise disrespect him.
2.  If a pedestrian obstacle your path, tootle horn melodiously.  If he 
continue to obstacle, tootle horn vigorously and utter vocal woraning 
such as "Hi, Hi."
3.  If wandering horse by roadside obstacle you path, beware that he not 
take fright as you pass him.  Go soothingly by, or stop by roadside till 
he pass away.
4.  If road mope obstacle your path, refrain from pass on hill or round 
curve.  Follow patiently till road arrive at straight level stretch.  
Then tootle horn melodiously and step on, passing at left and waving hand 
courteously to honorable road mope in passing. 
5.  Beware of greasy corner where lurk skid demon.  Cease step on, 
approach slowly, round cautiously, resume step on gradually. 
			Happy driving!  -Rick

Assuming you have allowed the pin and lock nut to soak in penetrating oil,
without ruining the rubber around it...

1) Holding the pin with either a screwdriver (if you have a slot) or a
vise-grips (like the one that Ken Schrader used as a shift knob at Sears
Point last Sunday), loosen the lock nut.

2) Adjust the pin length by turning it.

3) Tighten the locknut somewhat.

4) Check the adjustment.

5) Repeat steps 2,3, and 4 until the hatch closes easily and has no looseness
when closed.

6) Tighten the locknut.

Posting for a friend, who has an '83 911SC.
     
  My sled has recently developed a rather irritating tendency to stall out 
at idle.  Here are the symptoms.  Cold start is fine, idle is fine when 
engine is cold.  As soon as engine reaches a certain temp (something less 
than normal operating temp, oil temp gauge just starting to rise) the idle 
begins to fluctuate wildly between 0 and 2000 rpm.  Eventually it will fail 
to "pull out" of one of its rpm-valleys and stall.  Runs fine at speed, but 
even when up to normal operating temp, the idle problem persists.

Subject: Person selling 930 80's->90's bumper upgrades?.

Hello,

Someone on this list a while back was offering to sell a 
bumper update kit for a 930, from the older bellow style
bumpers to the newer one-piece wrap-around style.  Are they
still available?  I think they were local to the Boston
area - in Natick somehwhere.

I believe there is a light kit needed for this conversion too?  
Does this light kit include light lenses which will be on a slight 
angle backwards (the older style rear tail/side lights and PORSCHE 
reflector are pretty much at a 90 degree angle to the ground, 
but the updated newer look puts them at a slant to mold smoothly with 
the slope of the one piece bumper).  Do the bumper kits and lights
just simply bolt in place after painting, or is there modifications
to the body panels (fenders, trunk lid, etc.) that are needed?  Are
all the screw and bolt locations the same from the old bumpers to
the newer style one-piece.

What about the side skirts that complete the newer look?  Do these 
somehow fit into the channels that the 80's style rubber stripping 
along the base of the rocker panel ataches to?

Subject: Re: 944 hatch adjustment

This is fresh in my mind as I just did it to get rid of some
squeeks that came with the warmer weather. There are actually
two parts to this: (1) the latches and (2) the lock and remote
release mechanism.

First off, clean and lube the latches. There are plastic "keepers"
on the rods running from the lock mechanism to the latches. Do not
lubricate these or they will bind and you'll have a fun time
taking the whole thing out and cleaning it off. If the car hasn't
been in an accident there should be no reason to remove / adjust
either the female or male components (we haven't gotten PC yet here
in TN). If the backlight latches but is loose, you'll want to loosen
the lock nut on the male component and turn the latch post in,
maybe a full turn at a time. Try closing the backlight. It should
latch with firm steady pressure but should not require a "slam"
like the doors on Dad's LTD. Iterate this process until one or
both of the latches fails to catch. When this happens loosen the
failing latch post about 1/4 to 1/2 turn. The latch should then
catch. While you're looking at the latches make sure that the
drain tubes are clear.

Lubricate the bellcrank assembly behind the lock. Again, keep the
lubricant off of the plastic component there. Lubricate the cable
assembly from the remote release motor.

When you're done the latch should release easily with either the key
or the remote release and should shut easily and consistently and
should not rattle.

Note that if the latches are not lubricated once in a while the effort
on the key to unlock the latches will increase to the point where the
bellcrank mechanism will become very loose. In this case you'll have
to disassemble that and tighten it up. But that is a differnt thing.

Good Luck!

Hopefully, through PCA (or maybe the paper?) I can find someone willing to

Treed square in the back. Insurance quote to fix was $140,000.00. The turbo

To 951/944 owners:

I was visiting Kahlers in Dublin, California this morning. Denny Kahler
has a package deal on the M474 Koni shocks, with springs, spring mounts 
and shock boots.

Here's what you get for $399.00:

	2 Koni Adjustable gas front struts (not inserts)
	2 Koni Adjustable gas rear shocks
	2 Eibach 250 lb coil springs (fit the new struts)
	2 Upper spring mounts
	2 Front shock boots.

This will fit all 85.5 and later 944, 924S, 951 and 968 with no 
modifications. 

If you have an earlier 924, 924 turbo (four wheel disc brake only) or 
944, the front struts can be modified. Rear shocks for the steel rear 
trailing arms require the rubber center from your present shock to be 
pressed in.

Call Denny Kahler at (510) 829-2050 for info and details.

Hi group,

I'm having a battery problem and looking for some advise. 

I jumped in the C2 this morning and...nothing, well enough for the idiot lights
but not much more just a couple of clicks from the starter solenoid.

I couldn't find anything left on so I jump started the car and drove for about a
1/2 hour. Stopped for 5 minutes then started the car again. Enough to get it
started but sounds very weak. Stopped again for 20 minutes. That's it, not
enough juice to start up again.

When I got home I put my VOA meter in line to test the amp draw. I get a reading
of -.09. I then started pulling fuses to isolate the culprit. No luck, still a
steady -.09 after pulling all fuses and relays in the fuse box. (I did remove
the interior light fuse so the open boot light wouldn't be a factor.)

Is the -.09 normal? It sounds excessive.

Is there anyway to tell if I just plain have a bad battery? Or is it time for a
visit to Sears?

Thanks,

Color code 325 is Albert Blue and is marked as a color only available
for the US market. From what I can tell 9 is the coach builder and the

Subject: 914 Thermostat Flaps

        I got to thinking about the "accordion" thermostat and the
flaps in the fan shroud/engine tin that it controls.  How do they
work?
        The flaps are controlled by a rod that is twisted against
the pressure of a spring.  When you let the spring relax, the flap
over the oil cooler closes, and the flap above the LHS cylinder bank
opens up.  When you twist the rod against the spring tension, the
flap over the oil cooler opens and the other flap closes off the fan
shroud from the LHS cylinder bank.
        (Am I backwards here?)
        The thermostat is a given length when cold.  When warm, it
expands.  (Am I backwards here, too?)  It is held at one end, and
has a wire attached to the free end.  The wire goes under a pulley,
and comes up through a hole in the engine tin to connect to the rod
near the spring.  If the wire pulls, the rod twists against the
spring tension.  If the wire relaxes, it lets the spring relax.
        Therefore, a warm thermostat is longer, so it relaxes the
pull on the wire, which relaxes the spring pressure which closes off
the oil cooler!?!?  This seems backwards!
        Please help me to understand--I'll have to put this all back
together in the (not-so distant?) future!  And no, I don't want to
leave it disconnected.  I believe that it serves a purpose, even in
California where it dosen't get that cold.

 Before I start (messing) with this car I would like a little advice on 
where to look. The problem is with a 77 911 cpe that after it's run for a 
while and shut down, it's unable to start. The car belongs to a friend of 
mine and I have only seen it happen once. I am told that after a long run it 
is a given that the car will need to cool down before restarting. The time 
it happened here we put a new permatune box inline and that didn't solve the 
problem. So, before I dig out CIS book and get and education, can some one 
point me in
a direction? Who's seen this problkem before and how did you solve it?

Turbocharging and supercharging are both ways to beat the volumetric
efficiency problems of the Otto Cycle engine in other than it's peak
band of operating efficiency. You want the static pressure in the cylinder
at BDC on the intake stroke to be low enough that the compression effect
will leave you below 180 psi at full compression unless this is a full
race engine that you are seeking to blow up in search of more power.
That means that you can diddle two items: 1) static compression ratio,
(2) base boost pressure. Do the math here, and you see that if you're
looking at say a 930 where the static compression is 7:1, that you can
run up to a 1.75-1.8 bar boost OK. If on the other hand you're running
say a 9.5:1 engine (just guessing, all my waterpumper stuff is in storage
since I never really use it) then you only get a 1.3 bar boost, and 
since we're already at 1 bar static, that's a .3 bar boost or about
4 psi on a 1.5 liter steady state push. You'd do better hooking a big
hose and having your passenger blow hard when you punch the gas.

You also have to *COMPLETELY* re-do the engine management software. On a
dyno. With a four-gas analyser.You will also almost certainly need larger 
injectors, and possibly a higher capacity fuel system. All that can be 
calculated from the additional air flow, and is reasonably well understood.

And of course if you want to do this at HIGHER RPM, there are more things
you gotta consider...

There is no cheap answer in the search for power, just cheap ways
to blow your engine up.

Subject: Early 911 Drivers Side Door Pull

Hi Gang:

I spoke with Howard Adams today regarding our RHD door pulls and a possible part
number.  Here's the answer from PCNA:

They do not exist.

Howard has done some research on these as late as 1990.  The total (T, E and S)
number of RHD 911's (early models) is under 1000.  All of the parts have been
salvaged... period.  The only alternative would be to fly to the UK, search out
a pre 73 owner, slam into him at high velocity with your rental car and,
profusely apologizing, offer to purchase his door pull from his now totalled RHD
911... just a thought.  (The previous thought is in no way sanctioned by PCNA,
nor was it part of their illustrious advice)

There is light at the end of the tunnel:

There is someone rumored to be working on a aftermarket piece.  I spoke with him
today but... but he's not quite ready so he didn't want me giving out his name.
(Don't you hate this secret stuff??)  I told him that I'd take a head count and
get back with him.  He has the last original OEM NOS piece from Porsche.  They
(Porsche) do not have any more of these pieces and they WILL NOT sell them in
the US because it would be illegal.  These parts are not originally manufactured
for American cars.  They do bolt right in however.  The door is machined to
accept this part.

So... here's the head count part.  Let me know if you're interested in a real
drivers door pull for a 68-73 911.

have I had to rush to clean brake fluid off of bodywork? - there is no

deflated to 20psi so as not to blow anything, as per the instructions.

The wonder of it is that you do not need a helper, and even the dual cicuit 
brakes on the 928 - eight bleed screws - can be properly bled in a few 
minutes.  Also, the container holds a large quantity of fluid, so you're not

I use NAPA heavy duty DOT4 brake fluid which references 'QSC Corporation' as

Subject: Re: 944 Supercharger?????

Hello FiewVinder (could you add your real name to the post?)

Of course it could be possible to add a supercharger to an 8v 944. I have
heard of 305ci small block Chevy powered 944s! Anything is possible, but why
one would do such a thing is beyond me. Why not just buy a 944 Turbo? This
way you have a car that is designed to handle the additional power. 

Since the supercharger just forces more fuel-air mixture into the cylinder,
the engine management computer should be able to adjust enough to make the
car run ok. I have doubts about how long the engine would stay together. The
944 Turbo has a much lower compression ratio then the non turbo. A
supercharger could easily blow the head. I think that at low enough boost
levels to allow the engine to not blow up would probably give less than 50hp
gain. The Turbo has 217hp vs 147 from the non-turbo for a HP gain of 70HP,
and this was optimized by Porsche. Any aftermarket supercharger would yield
less than this.

Or I could be completely wrong on everything!

Subject: Re: Welding

Jerry Brady asked about somebody taking a day to show him how to weld. 

You can't learn it in a day. You can do some things after a day of futzing
around with a torch and gas bottles, but if you attack your car with that
level of knowledge you'll cause more damage than you can repair. Not to scare
you about welding, but it takes a little while to learn, to pick up some
tricks, to learn how to think about what the heat is doing, and most of all
it takes practice. Good welders do this every day. If you knock off for a few
weeks you have to get back in practice. I learned how to do my own welding.
It takes me so long to do the quality of work I want on my own cars that I
know I could never make a living at it. I just got done welding a tail clip
to a freind's '58 coupe and it is better than all but the most professional
top-dollar resto jobs I've seen. I'm now touching up the lead on one side to
get the engine lid gap absolutely perfect.

Perhaps a better way for you to learn, better than asking somebody to show
you more tricks than you can absorb in one day, is to take a course at the
local community college, if such are offered. That's what I did. Eventually I
got so frustrated with half-wrecked school equipment that I bought my own
tanks, a Henrob torch, and a Lincoln SP-100 MIG and now I do it all at home.

If you have a torch and a set of tanks, get some CLEAN scrap sheet metal, 22
gauge, cut it into little squares about 3 inches on a side, and after you can
draw a bead without welding rod, and make lap welds, practice making butt weld
s. You will probably blow a lot of holes in the material at first. Now think
of blowing these into the car you want to fix. Figure on at least a week of
this practice, an hour or two a day, before you can trust yourself on a car. 

If you have a MIG welder, it's a bit easier but you still need to be careful
not to blow holes. MIG has many advantages, including less heat buildup, but
it can't do everything and the best setup is still to have both MIG and
oxy-acetylene.

You need to learn tricks like cutting out rotted sections, making a GOOD
patch (fits tightly, not with big gaps; a gap as wide as the metal is thick
is about the most you want), clamping patches, using special clamping methods
to position the patches, using products and techniques to minimize heat
buildup (anything from wet rags to "heat fence" clay around the area, as
needed). The keys to good patches are precise fitting patches, precise
location and unhurried, carefully considered welding.

Yup, basic problem. Just about all the bookstores and libraries in the
country buy from two big distributors, Baker & Taylor and Ingram. They don't
carry any of Johnson's books. They are most definitely still in print. For
automotive books, a lot of bookstores use Motorbooks in Wisconsin as their
single-source distributor as B&T and Ingram don't carry a comprehensive line
of car books. 

I have seen Johnson books at Borders. Rizzoli has been known to carry the
Conradt 356 book, depending on the store and the store's buyer. Rizzoli buys
from Motorbooks.

Absolutely. Variprime is not supposed to be used without a top coat to hold

Otherwise, little brown spots appear right through the primer. I think Varipri

If you send your VIN and $20 to PCNA, they'll send you a

The downside is that you can't necessarily trust the info they give

of the sort.  I got a Certificate for my car and the color
code is only one of several things that don't match the

Hi,

I have a couple of questions regarding the sealing of my targa top.  The
front corners of the top don't want to line up with the windshield frame.  I
tried regluing one of the corners thinking that the rubber seal was
preventing the top from being clamped down completely, but that didn't help.
Does anybody have any ideas what might be wrong? The latches work properly,
so if it's not the top, is it possible that my car has a bad aftermarket
seal?

Since my top doesn't align well, I'm going to raise my vent windows 1/4 inch
so that is meets the top. Somebody mentioned last week that it was possible.
Besides the 2 bolts at the front of the door, what other bolts do I need to
loosen before I can raise it properly?

Lastly, does anybody have 8-10" of old 911 door weatherstripping that they
can send me? I need to replace the lower 4 inches of my front targa top seal
where it meets the door seal. For some reason, that part on both sides is in
real bad shape...leading me to believe that I might have an aftermarket part.
I'd be more than willing to pay for shipping. I'd buy a new seal, but it
doesn't seem worthwhile yet to buy a new one, when mine still has a couple of
years left.

Absolutely not. You can usually cook meat in the cabin of a 914 with a
correctly working heater. You may need anything from just a simple adjustment
of some cables to a whole pile of niddly little parts under the car. Consult
a shop that understands this stuff for an evaluation of what you need, or
better, a nearby list member that understands this stuff and has a 914 
you can look at...

Don't pull it with the top on!!! Just kidding -- it's the heater control
lever.

P.S. Please go buy an owner's manual. You'll be a lot happier if you actually
understand your car...

April Lambert asked about original color of her 912. 

Try sanding through the color in a small spot in the trunk. It's unlikely
anybody stripped that to bare metal (that would be a really thorough
repaint). 

Somewhere there should be a sticker or plate with option codes and color
codes. Look inside the front trunk and under the lid. Somebody else said
inside the driver's door. Given those codes, you should be able to look up
the color. I don't have Brett Johnson's book covering the early 911s but in
1974, for example, silver coupes had a color code Z2 Z2, while silver Targas
were Z2 V9.

Jeff,

Simple question, but the answer is a little more difficult to form.  A sway
bar gives you springing only in side-to-side, while coil or torsion bar
springs give independent springing at each corner.  So, for example, a
sway bar does absolutely nothing for anti-dive.

The received wisdom is that it is best to set basic springing in a car
with coil and torsion springs, then to use sway bars to tune.

With 944-series cars, most people update sway bars because it is real
easy to do.  Changing the torsion bars is a pain, like six hours of
shop time not counting corner weighting and alignment.  I just did mine,
and while the results are terrific, it was truly a pain in the rump.
911's have a hole in their rockers; a certain 944 may get a pair next
time its owner feels like re-springing it!

People on the list and at the track often speak of updating their
suspensions to Escort or Passport spec.  Ditto for Carrera Cup 911's.
I would caution that those suspensions are often laid out by Porsche
because of series rules and not because they are necessarily the best
clean-sheet-of-paper solution.  For example, the Firehawk 944's ran
rear coil-overs because series rules did not permit torsion bar
changes (this according to a friend who drove in the series).

Soft shocks are not the answer, but setting them is very difficult
and is something that the Indy and F1 mechanics, for example, spend
quite a bit of time trying to get right at each circuit.  For one
thing, a shock acts as a transient spring during weight transfer,
eg, during turn-in.  As such, the wrong setting can induce turn-in
understeer or oversteer.

Yes, but the other drive train components would fail prematurely due to the

Depends what you consider major.  One thing that might be a pain is the drive
belt.  Off of what pully would you take power to drive the supercharger.

Lots more horsepower that depends on how much more air and fuel you stuff
into the combustion chamber, i.e., how big the supercharger is.

Depends on whether the supercharger is up or downstream of the air flow 
meter.  In either case some new software would probably be necessary.

Subject: 1979 911SC


Hello -   I'm a new member of your group.  I don't currently own a Porsche,
I've been taking my time looking for a nice 911.

On Sunday, I followed an ad in the newspaper.  The subject is a 1979 911SC.
The paint and body are in very good condition (dark Graphite). A Porsche 
whale tail has been added and the windows are tinted.  The car is a real
looker!!!.  The leather shows signs of wear with cracks and some rips in 
the rear seats.  Needs new carpet also.  Power windows roll up real slow.
The A/C is not functional.  No horn. 

Now for the good stuff - test drive.   The car drove extremely strong. 2nd
gear really set me back.  The car has 52+k miles on a 6 digit odo. The 
clutch was replaced last month.

I have some questions for the experts however.

When the car first started, I saw a little black smoke.  But after idling,
if I stepped into the gas, no smoke.  When driving the car, I heard a lite
ticking sound that almost sounded like a value (I'm a systems person, not
a mechanic).  The ticking seemed to be proportional to RPMs.  I only drove
the car for about ten minutes and not sure if it was warmed up.  Finally,
the rotors appeared to have scores.  The car stopped quite well, however.
Should I be concerned about these items???????.  What is a fair price ???  

Thank you.

Speaking of superchargers, I've been toying around with that idea for my 924
..   My car is a '79 924 with the newer series 5 speed. ( not the audi 4 spd)
But I'm not sure if the engine is original.... I though on most engines that 
the pistons come up to zero deck, meaning all the way up to the top of the
block?  Mine don't that get up to about 1/8th of an inch away at TDC.  Is this
a turbo motor?? or stock??  If its a turbo, it seems to me to be a prime 
canidate for supercharging due to the low compression ratio (7.5:1) If anyone
whos of info, pleas reply....

   True, but this sort of just semantics.  Angular momentum is conserved about
ANY axis for which there are no forces acting at a distance from, or, more
generally, any axis about which there is no net torque applied.  The center 
of the front axle qualifies in this case because the forces applied by 
the front tires result in equal and opposite torques with respect to the 
center of the axle.  So, yes, the angular momentum about *this* axis must be
conserved.  Newcomb chose this point as the origin of his reference frame, 
I suppose it was easier to keep track of stuff about this axis.

   It is equally valid, (and easier for *me* to visualize) to consider the
CG as the origin, and then the forces applied by the tires DO result in a net
torque with respect to the axis running through the CG.  Angular momentum is
not conserved about this axis, as a torque changes the angular momentum 
(by definition, I guess).  This reference frame is generally the one I care
about, as in "Oh my god, my car is spinning!"

P.S., I sent in a reply to John Lupien the other day, graciously handing over

Hey,

The wife and I went to Atlanta yesterday to look at a used '88

somewhat mis-represented, but is still decent.

Couple of questions:  (and forgive me if these are in the FAQ -
I'm at work right now)
1.  The temp gauge was just below the highest white line during
      our test drive.  This seemed a little warm.  Is this normal?
2.  My wife was coasting with the car in 1st gear at about 10 mph
     and I heard a quite loud racheting sound from the transaxle
     area.  CV joints?  Bigger problem?
3.  Anyone in the Atlanta area heard of a mechanic named Rick
     Bowers (sp? - maybe Bauer?).  Anyway this dealership (German
     Auto Werks on Roswell Road) is going to take the car to him
     and have it checked out.  Has anybody heard of this guy?  What
     about the dealership itself?

BTW, the car has 67k miles, black/tan leather (with sport seats). loaded,
etc. for $9900.

Any comments would be appreciated.

Subject: 86 Carrera Euro


Howdy all,

	I have an 86 Carrera that the original owner brought over from 
Argentina (sp?).  Anyway the importer had the EPA modifications done so 
(I have a stack of paperwork) it is supposedly up to spec.  My question is, 
how will this car differ from other 86 Carrera's that had the EPA stuff 
done at the factory?  If I wanted to put a speed chip in it would this be 
a problem?  Is the Euro DME module different than the US one?

Will the actual HP be less than an "Americanized" 86?

And while were on the subject does anyone know if what the 0-60 and 1/4 mile
specs for my car are?  And HP, as I've read everything from 200-227HP....

Thanks in advance!!!

Armand.

Subject: Re: 911 (ant-) sway bar and mounts 

I was surprised to find that one (right side) of the (anti-) sway bar mounts
on my 88' 911 was severed. The only "extreme" maneuver that I performed was a
quick and decisive head-on collision avoidance (tell the war story another
time). Last night I dismantled the sharp-edged bracket (from the stabilizer bar) 
to avoid possible perforation of the AC-line -near-by. It is made from a very
flimsy (thin) material. 

I now remember that many of the 1987 Carrera's that I looked at had one
or both mounts sheared-off. Is this a bad engineering design or is the 
rear made to "stiff" with the 21mm stabilizer bar. It was increased from 
18 mm to 21 mm in 1886 (?). Is this "stiff" rear-end telling the suspension 
dynamics that it wants to be released (aka: self-regulating system wisdom ?) 

Now to the fix:  Should I release the other side -to make the car more 
"neutral" (symmetric) until the welding can be done? 

Is this a common problem among the post 86' 911? Did Porsche modify this
bracket design? I assume that it should be MIG welded by a Pro: protecting
the near-by components..

TIA for the help!

Amen to that. What nobody has figured out yet is that if you double the
number of people on the planet (and all of them want to live like Americans,
specifically the Americans they see on TV, i.e. Californians) and you make a
big effort to reduce pollution by 10 or 20 percent or whatever, you still
find yourself slipping downhill. 

Absolutely nobody except the Red Chinese have addressed the problem of too
much birthing going on. There is no tax disincentive to make more than 2
babies; if anything there is an incentive (deductions). And that's not even
getting into the welfare thing, where more babies = more $$$.

It's all just basic thermodynamics, First Law of. You have basically a closed
system (the whole planet), nobody is making a serious effort to get off the
planet, and everybody on the planet wants to consume more  (and by implication
 pollute more). I'm as guilty as anybody else and freely admit to being a
hypocrite on this.

Somebody once pointed out to me that anybody who has studied astronomy
(including self) thinks there are too many people on the planet. Probably has
something to do with light pollution. I'm told that on a clear day, from the
catwalk around the 200 inch telescope dome on Mt. Palomar, you can see the
brake lights of evening rush hour traffic on California 60 in Corona, 90

Subject: Advice on European '80 911SC

I am considering buying a 1980 911SC that was imported to the U. S. in '86.
The car has 200,000km (124,278 miles) on it and I would be the fourth
owner. It has almost no luxuries/options (no A/C, sunroof, etc. just
P/W)and no updates (chain tensioners, etc.). It's in very good shape (no
wrecks or repaint) and very well documented. Overall, it appears to be just
well looked after and not driven hard. The owner is asking $11,500. I have
three questions:
        1.) The conventional wisdom seems to be to avoid the European
models at all costs because they may have been
driven harder than the American 911s and may need emissions updates. Is
this more myth than fact?
        2.) Is the price about right or on the high or low side considering
the mileage?
        3.) Are there any particular troubles areas I should look for with
this model? The owner says it uses one quart of oil between  changes. When
I drove it I thought the transmission shifts were very clunky but didn't
notice any grinding, etc.

Any information/advice that is provided would be appreciated. Thanks.

Well, it would be, except that it won't happen that way in practice.
Suppose you happen to be sliding downtrack at a 45 degree inclination
to the direction of motion (kids, these are trained drivers, don't
try it at home, etc.). The friction from the slide will effect a
weight transfer to the downtrack direction, so the downtrack front
will have more normal force and hence more traction than the uptrack front.
More normal force implies more traction than the uptrack front wheel,
which implies an unbalanced couple about the center of the front axle.
This is why the center of rotation follows a strange path during the spin.

And visualization isn't all there is to it, either. The motion of the CG is 
what you are usually focussed on in terms of car control. Trying to
pick a desired center of rotation and effect control changes on that basis
is hopelessly complex. I have great difficulty doing offset-polar-to-cartesian
coordinate transforms while sitting in a stationary armchair - the driver's
seat of a spinning car is much less conducive to such cogitations.

I thank you for your confidence in my geekishness. To be fair, though,
I only mentioned the earth-porsche part of the system, and I am of the
opinion that any non-terrestrial bodies have no impact on the condition.
However, on further consideration of my statement regarding the effect on
the Earth's rotation of spinning a car, the only time it is as direct as
"Earth spins slowly the other way" is if you spin your car while passing
directly over the north or south pole. In any other location, there will
instead be a gyroscopic precession effect.

What's the prize for GOTW? Any way I can avoid winning it at this point?

A/C units are readily available.  Don't know if it was a factory

If it sounds to good to be true it probably is.

The 86 928 was red, not burgandy.
Mechanically it looked good. 
No leaks, strong, auto transmission shifted as it should.

It had mismatched tires.
Minimal tread.
The front clip had been replaced. 
The crossmember over the engine hadn't because the frame was too 
crooked to get it back on. Instead the bent one was left there :-(

It drove nice and straight and cornered evenly and felt tight so I
guess the suspension was reasonable straight.

The brakes worked great.  The owner? (I'll get back to this)  didn't
have his seat belt on ;)
110 to 0 in very few feet.

Well we got down to business.

I asked to see the title. It was new and the mileage on the title
of 103k didn't match the odometer 69k.

I copied down the VIN number, the title number and the
previous title number and asked him to meet me at the mechanics
the following day.
I called Ga DMV. No record of the title.
I called SC DMV. No record of the previous title and no record of

Needless to say, the seller didn't keep his appointment and is now

Oops, forgot to offer a hint on targa top sealing in my original post.
Actually my hint is on stopping leaks which plague some targas. I was getting
some water on the floor behind the front seats which I traced it to a leak in
the rear window seal. When I went to seal it with silicon, I noticed a lot of
dirt coming up when I shoved the silicon applicator between the window and
the seal. I then got a small flathead screwdriver and cleaned up as much dirt
as possible, it was a surpising amount. I then continued resealing with
silicon.  Hopefully it will work. Just did it last night.

So in short, before you try using silicon to seal the  wondows, make sure
that there is no dirt between the seal and the glass. It might be obvious to
the rest of you, but I was really surprized at the amount of dirt that came
out.

do I have to prime it?  Should I use my mitivac (which I officially HATE)
to suck gas up the gas lines and then reconnect the fule line  (rubber)
to the fuel pump on the engine?  I guess the mitivac solution seems
best thus far - unless I dont even need to do that.  Does any of this
even really matter?

Ideas?

    I forget how to identify these, but I thought the turbo motor used 
 a true Porsche head with the intake on the passenger side. I'm probably wrong
 there. I also forget what you call the 924 type of head (where there is no
 volume in the head for the combustion chamber, but instead dish). Starts
 with an "H"....(give me a letter...).

    The rule of thumb that I've heard is that 3.8pounds of boost is equal
 to a point in static compression. The 924 was a low compression motor,
 theoretically you could go from 8.5:1 to 10.5:1 at about 7 pounds boost
 which should (more thumbs; 15psi=double horsepower) give you around
 150 hp.
     Or, you could just get a stock 944 and probably you'll be happier...
 Or a 928 and have a blast... :)  That poor little 2 liter motor just
 doesn't want to give up "real power," but in stock, well-running form
 I think its a dandy car...

Buddy, you're way out in front for Geek Of The Year.  Normal forces 
and spin couples, coordinate transforms (it'd take me a week to 
remember polar to cartesian...), and fergodsake the gyroscopic 
precession effect in the car/earth action/reaction system.

Let's stick to a frame of reference that keeps the calculations down 
to the merely unmanageable, as opposed to the totally unnecessary.

I think we need to add to our pile of P-philes memorabilia the GOTW

During my recent rebuild I learned the following.  First, the flaps when
installed correctly will be spring loaded to stay open(on both sides).  

The termostat cable holds them fully closed with the engine cold.  As the
engine warms, the termostat coil expands, thus permitting more air to 
enter the engine shrouds.  If your thermostat breaks or is streched, you
should not worry about cooking the engine, but you may have a hard time
reaching operating temperatures in cold weather.

Subject: Re: Antiroll bars or stiffer ...

Antiroll bars and springs perform different though seemingly similar
functions.

Springs, along with shocks, keep the wheels on the ground to provide  maximum
traction and grip. They also help to limit roll and they affect the RATE of
weight transfer. If you change your springs you may have to change shocks to
match them.

Antiroll bars control roll couple distribution, ie the relationship between
the tendency of the two end of the vehicle to roll ( they may do so at
different rates). This means you can adjust oversteer/understeer
characteristics with antiroll bars.

It is not that simple to just "stiffen the bars" or "stiffen the springs"
beacause all these things interact on each other.

I am not qualified to give you advice on your car setup but I would recommend
that you read Carroll Smith's "Tune to Win". It is very readable, has great
diagrams and explanations and will most likely teach you enough to figure it
out for yourself.

All he said is that some of the parts on a 951 are not good quality -he's
right, if it is anything like my 944.

 Many of the electrical components (switches etc) are VW parts and are of
average quality and were designed for (cheap) mass production and not for use
in a high dollar sports car.

That doesn't mean he (or I ) don't like our cars or don't love to drive them.

If the cable breaks, which they do, the flaps fail safe. If your engine is
getting that hot there are a few possible culprits. One, you have many
broken fan blades and/or holes in your fan shroud. Two, you have a large
obstruction of air flow inside the engine cowling. Three your temp readback
is busted. In cases one and two, fix it now. The longer you run it like
this, the more damage you can do. To repair the fan? Replace it. To clear
out the air passages? Drop the engine and pull off the sheet metal and
clean the sucker out. This is a time consuming and potentially costly
venture. I say costly because you never know what you might notice needs
replacing or fixing once you get in there. When I did this to my very hot
running 914, I discovered both one and two. I had -NINE- misssing blades on
the fan and tons of glop and stuff blocking airflow thru the cylinders.

Good luck in any case.

You might be able to check out your fan with an inspection mirror and a
double jointed elbow :).

I believe so.  Check out "The 911 and 912 Porsche, a Restorer's Guide

Yeah, you can get aftermarket stuff in the neighborhood of $1.5K (I
think -- my price may be way off).

Check out the 911 FAQ -- a lot of this stuff is mentioned there.  Also,
check out "Guide to Purchase & DIY Restoration of the Porsche 911", 
by Porter and Morgan, Haynes Publishing, 1988 or "Porsche 911

Porsche Supercup Returns to U.S. Television in 1995

RENO, NEVADA, May 10, 1995 --- Porsche Cars North America today announced
the 1995 Porsche Supercup Championship will be televised in the U.S. over
the ESPN cable sports television network. It marks the second-straight year
ESPN has telecast the Porsche Supercup to U.S. households.

Lingner Group Productions of Indianapolis will again produce each of the
nine race broadcasts plus a season wrap-up program. All of these half-hour
telecasts will be seen once on ESPN and at least twice on ESPN 2. Veteran
motor sports announcer Marty Reid returns as the Championship host.

Now in its third year, the Porsche Supercup Championship is run in
conjunction with nine European World Championship Formula One Grand Prixs
- -- San Marino, Spain, Monaco, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary,
Belgium and Europe (Nurburgring). Drivers from seven European countries
will contest the entire 1995 series in cars fielded by some of that
continent's top sports car racing teams. In addition, several well-known
North American drivers are expected to compete in individual races at the
controls of Porsche factory "guest" cars.

All cars entered in the Supercup Championship are identically equipped and
based on the highly popular 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera. Changes in the
race-prepared Carreras for the 1995 Championship include the addition of a
huge fixed rear wing and new front spoiler, enhanced suspension and a
shortened sixth gear for added performance at very high speeds. These
modifications have resulted in a car that is faster yet easier to drive
than last year's version.

Funny - the Greasy Skid Demons that I've seen have looked like mobile,

    Well, there is a kit, I believe that Eastwood sells it, to polish
your windshield at home... I think it was absically designed to fix
windshields on really old cars (like my Chevy) that can no longer be
replaced, but I see no reason why you couldn't give it a try on a
"well-loved" p-car..
    If you need the address, just write back, I'll dig it out for you..

If it isn't broadcasting on radar frequencies (microwave), then it can't "jam"
the signal, and if it is broadcasting in those frequencies, then it is illegal
without a permit, and they probably do not issue permits to allow you to use
it.

A point on the curve of a recent thread.  I received in the

an auto insurance quote, saying that as a State employee
(I work for the Univ. of Washington.) I was eligible for certain

giving them information, like my wife's name, because they
just couldn't give me a quote without it, and when we got
down to the kind of cars I had, and I mentioned my Porsche's,
they informed me they do not insure Porsche's.

Aren't insurance companies regulated in some way?  Aren't they
given the right to provide insurance in a given state by a
state commission of some sort?  Don't they have to provide
roughly equal services?  What's the point of the regulatory
business if it doesn't regulate?  Aw...forget it.  It's too

To my knowledge the all N/A 924 engines have valve/piston clearance even   
though (some) has higher compression ratio than turbo. 924 Turbo engines
have no clearance. Just wondering, how do you plan to turbocharge your
7.5:1 N/A engine? Doesn't seem easy to me. Although the 80' 931 (924 T) 
have that 7.5:1 C-Ratio. Do you have the Audi 5 spd? (thats the one on early
944's) or the Porsche 5spd? (the one that grinds) Supercharge it? not worth
it. cuz the low rev torque needed to spin up that supercharger itsn't there
for the stock motor. BTW: I doubt its a turbo motor.

I wouldn't call a stock 10.5:1 ratio low compression! I think the 80'-83' 
924s had that. 81'-82' 931s had 8.0:1 C-ratio. That's probably optimum for 
street use and pump gas.

Or, get a 80' 931 motor and just slap it in your 79'! (there over 10,000
units around vs under 5500 for 81'-83') "Poor little 2 liter"?!
hardly! What was the hp output of the 1980 and 1981 LeMann's 924? 600 hps
I think. Ok for pratical street purpose, my stock 81' 924 turbo (931) puts 
out an easy 150-160 ponies (and I have a Calif. model!) With a little tweekin

Subject: 914  Ignition

Afetr much consideration and reflection, I have think I have determined my 
new plan for ignition and would like to hear any comments anybody may have.

After geting feed back from P-Philes, I spoke with a tech guy at MSD and 
asked about the MSD distributor. "Yes,"he said, "it fits a 914, yuh just 
gotta bang out the sheet metal a bit.." "Cool", thought I,"but is it worth 
it?" I asked if the MSD distributor was any better than, say a 050 or an 009 
. "Well", he answered, "I guess it depends on which you prefer.." "But", 
said I,"your's is four times the money...and I'll get it if it's better..." 
"Well," he said, "I dunno if it's better, it's different..." 

It seems that if you use an MSD-6 with the crankfire option, the distributor 
really does sweet FA, so you can use anything virtually, such as an 009, but 
you may wish to allow some retard (it's a street engine after all) so you 
just buy the 8981 programmable timing computer (only computer I ever saw in 
a 3 inch square box..oh, well, guess it's a euphemism)and you're off to the 
races (metaphorically).

The question I have is will this actually work? and if so, has anyone got a 
good idea as to where the crank trigger should go? Does it restrict the 
airflow unduly if it's on the fan? 

TIA, Chris Paine

Subject: Re: Porsche 911E

Comments from the '69 911E value/questions.  Comments to the
effect of $5K to $6K for a streetable car seem low, depends of
what streetable is.  I believe that real nice examples should
and could bring $10K or more.  

People seem to buy the earlier 911's for two reasons.  Some like
the style, pureness, whatever of the early cars (same for 912's,
too).  Won't be too much longer before a '69-73 911 is near the
same value as an '78-83.

Some people can't believe that you can buy a Porsche 911 for less
than $10K!  You get a lot of the looks of the later cars at a
fraction of the cost.  Some people buy $2500 911's as project cars
and know what it will cost to ultimately get the car "right".
Others buy them and the dissapointment begins on the drive
home, reality sets in the first time they're in the shop.  I'd
personally be careful of any car under $7K unless the price is
discounted and agreed on  because of known problems.

I also believe that if folks ultimate goal is to have a very 
nice/mechanically sound early 911, that the more money they 
spend up front will save money in the future.  If your goal is 
just to get into a 911 without spending a bunch of money, my 
guess is that you'll start spending money or get rid of the
car (then maybe some dummy like me who should know better
will buy it.....).

I'm a happy driver in my '70T, and close to getting the car the
way I want it (you'll know you've reached that point when you
quit apologizing for the car...."I'm going to_________someday,
just haven't gotten around to it".  Insert repaint, fix upholstry,
rebuild motor, fix rust, etc, etc).  And I'm certain that if I
ever decide to sell and replace my current car, the next one like
it will cost over $10K and likely more.  You just can't beat the
value of a properly restored or excellent original car.

Oh, on early AC.  I looked at a '68 911L (yes, it really was
an L) that had a/c-non functioning of course.  This was a funny
car.  It was an L so I expected good options.  It had a/c, but
the simple 3 gauge dash, and painted steel wheels.  Complete,
older rebuild, sound body and mechanicals, needed paint and
interior work for my tastes for $4k obo.  I think $3k could
have had it, anyone want me to see if it's still around?  Anyone
still reading this?!

Hi Folks - 

The recent thread on 914 engine air thermostat flaps prompts me to ask:
why doesn't my 911 have one of these clever devices?

When I got my first 911 and was poking around I was pretty suprised to
find that there's no thermostatic control of the cooling air flow.  This
seems either pretty crude (can you say Briggs & Stratton), or else
really advanced (look Ma! matching expansion coefficients!  no
thermostat!).  Regardless, the valves and pistons must
operate over a pretty wide temperature range.

So, does anyone know why the 911 doesn't have this, uh, feature?   (all
you 914, 356, 944, 928 etc folks, let's keep the smirking to a dull roar, at

I tried the Eastwood kit.  Comes with some special abrasive (zirconium
oxide?) and a felt wheel you chuck in your hand drill to do the
polishing.  The instructions featured photos of the felt wheel
splattering abrasive all over the front half of the car.  Desiring to 
avoid this, I tried a test patch by hand.  Couldn't see *any*
difference in the area I did, no matter how hard or long I rubbed... so I
put the kit away "for another day" and haven't touched it since.

Don't take this as a slam of the kit, after all I *did not* follow
directions... but I offer it as a point on the curve.

DOT5 does not absorb moisture unlike the other grades (as it is silicone 
based instead of whatever-else-based), so any water in your brake lines 
will collect at the lowest point and rust it out quicker than if it had 
been absorbed. So it's good if you regularly flush your brake fluid or if 
you can keep water out of your lines. At least this is what I've picked 
up when this issue is rehashed on the motorcycle list every month.

with an adhesive patch sold by Automotion.  No mess, no fuss, and
no mirror ricochet-ing around the interior after attempting to use the
Locktite product.

Subject: Dave J Andruczyk 924 Supercharged

Dave,
 As the mostly proud owner of a 1980 931 (924 Turbo), I can tell you
factually that the turbo pistons have a deep dish in them for lower
compression, and that they do indeed come up flush with the block.  I don't
believe that Porsche mad a 931 in 79, although the oddball 5 speed was
installed in some 79 standard, and all 80 turbo's (I think its a 016Z
trans).  This trans ROTS to buy parts for, cause they only produced the
thing 1 year or so.  Not that they aren't available, but that they are
terrible expensive (like 1500.00 for second gear).  However, I love the
shift pattern (like a 914, as I recall).  From what I can gather, the
standard 924 only has a CR of about 8.0 or 8.5 to 1, so LOW boost could
probably be tolorated well.  The bottom end of these audi motors is strong,
pretty much a hot-rodders delight.  The weak link is the cylinder head,
which if overheated, will warp.  Raceware makes an excellent stud kit for
the head, which helps hold things together better than the stock bolts. 
Since you have to replace the bolts upon removal anyway, it only makes
sense to replace with a superior fastener.

Hope this info is useful to you.

Since I have an old car I tend to look closely at the old ones I see. The most
visible and common rust spots are in the outer door skins.  Next is around the
nose area. Rock chips mostly.  Third is the rear part of the front fenders
between the wheel arch and the door, down low. You can see rust bubbles there.
Definately bad news.

Also, the whole front suspension pan is a typical spot for rust. If it's
really bad you can see it from below the car.  Check jacking points. And,
for laughs you may want to remove a headlight ring to inspect for rust in the
headlight buckets.

Good Luck,

Subject: Re: the rear view  adhesive thread

Is there an adhesive patch for the later-style mirrors?  There was a
change phased in with the introduction of the 928 that eventually went
to the whole Porsche line, of an American-style round bracket mounted
with metal-to-glass (like Loctite) adhesive, with an easily detachable
mirror.  Earlier cars had a black adhesive patch set in a rectangular
base that was hard to detach (I never was able to do it).  Many cars
with replacement windshields and/or mirrors have the bases of these
mirrors sanded down and mounted with the Loctite adhesive.  I know,
because that is what a glass shop did with mine.  To be correct, I
have a spare mirror and patch just in case the mirror comes off again
and/or I need a new windshield (wouldn't hurt, but it's just pitted,
not cracked).

In short, I think the adhesive patch is for the older-type mirrors.

Hope you don't mind the enigmatic subject.  The two birds:

1.  A low price for a carbureted 914 in California (but $400?!?) is
understandable, since putting the fuel injection back in is, so I'm
told, very expensive, and it won't pass smog with carbs.  But for a
track car, that's another story.

2.  I'm not asking what I should charge, necessarily, but I have 20+
years of PANORAMA including some multiple copies from when I was a
region president, and would not be averse to parting with all or some
of them.  If anyone has any interest, any knowledge of what traffic

Subject: 914 cold start/shifting action/backfires (unrelated)


Hi folks.

Nothing has broken in a few weeks on either p-cars. :)

A few quirks on the 914, nothing major, but in the "just wondering"
category.

Cold starts.  It dies.  Usually once or twice.  On the second or
third time, I can modulate the pedal (aka frantically pumping the
peddle random amounts in and out) and keep it going.  Once I drive
a block or so (hardly any significant distance) it idles fine.  Starting
a few hours later is no problem.  Starting 8 hours later it will repeat
it's cold start symptoms.

I also notice small backfires occasionally on deceleration.  Nothing
major, just a little putting.  I'm assuming this is normal?  I've heard
it on every 914 I've driven (not exactly a whole lot.  3 or 4).

Now for a quirky one (to me).  The shift action on the whole, is good
(for a 914).  I can downshift from any gear while moving with no problems
(with no double clutching, which I haven't mastered in the 914 yet anyways).
Including first.  No grinding, etc.  However, from a complete stop,
it is nearly impossible to get the car to go into gear.  If I don't go into
first *before* I completely stop, I'm stuck frantically doing the 
5-4-3-2-1 3-4-2-5-1 random shifting in an attempt to get into gear 
before the honking begins.  If I let the car roll a bit with the clutch 
out, and then try again, it'll grind if I go straight for first, but if 
I go to 2nd or 3rd first (which it now goes into with little difficulty) 
and then first, I'm fine.

Confused?  I am.  I have no problem leaving it in 1st with the clutch
in at a light, it just seems so Wrong. :)

Thanks for any information.

I have heard about v-8 swaps, talked to a guy who did a v-6 and said it wrecked

7000 rpm stock, 175 hp is supposed to be K&N, Weber, and exhaust.  I'm 
wondering about a Subaru swap.  They have the thump, thump exhaust sound,
without the annoying VW thrash.  Newer 2.2L make 135 hp stock, and there are
turbo versions from the factory (Japan only, unfortunately) making near 
300 hp.  Rally versions are rumored to crank out over 350 hp.  This is all
completely unnecessary.  135-150 would be more than enough.  Do you know if
a Subaru swap has been tried?  It would be nice to use the Subaru tranny as 
well, to get rid of the 914's expensive Achilles' heel.

Hi, Triet,

Well, sounds like you have some good merchandise to sell..

First of all, spend the $25 and buy a space.  The proceeds go to charity and
you'll get 10 times the traffic that you would otherwise.  In addition, if
you don't, I'll have Unka Bart make you wear that hair shirt he has
available for such events...

Swap meet prices are kind of interesting.  They tend to be low at the
beginning, due to the desire of sellers to get off to a good start, then
they flatten out, while sellers strive to maximize their return, then,
towards the end of the day, they dive again, in a flurry of panic selling.

(Strangely enough, the swap meet works by the same economic rules that
govern Wall Street or your local singles bar - fear and greed...)

So, mark your prices on the wheels, display them, and be prepared to deal...

(P.S. I'll be there to swap on Saturday and score the concours on
Sunday...Look me up, if you have a chance...John and Donna should know where
I am...)

     I currently don't have the money for a 944 or the 928...   But i do

blower a GMC 3-71 (brand new out of the box).  I though of using an inter-
cooler to cool of the intake charge to  a reasonable temp, but am wondering 2
things..  1. When you use an intercooler i was told that you can theoretically
increase the boost without detonation (because of the colder charge)  Is that
entirely true in practice??  Cause for the specs for the 924 Carrera GTR which
has a turbo with an intercooler, it puts out more that 300HP!! but the GTS 
which i believe doesn't use an intercooler only puts out HP in the 200's..
    2. Since the blower seems way oversized for this motor, ie 121 cu inch 
moor vs. 210 cu inch blower. Can this still be used underdriven???

Subject: Price of 87 944

I am going to look at a1987 944 today, and am
curious as to what fair value for the car might be.
What I know about it so far:
35 K miles.
Red w/black leather.
5 spd, ac, sunroof, all options.
2 owner car, although now owned by a wholesaler.
Claim is it has always been garaged, and interior
and exterior are supposed to be very clean.
Asking price of $9800.

If it looks good to me, I have a repuatable mechanic that
will look at it for me as well.

Any advice as to particulars for this year or value will be
appreciated, and thanks.

That's pretty interesting.  They must have some sort of discretion based on
state or office.  I'm currently in Houston and Nationwide gave me a very
competitive quote of approx. $700/6 mo. full comprehensive.  That's almost
identical to what I pay Statefarm (I'm 31, single, male).  These are the
lowest rates I've been able to find.

Close enough. Heron head (one R). Used on Audi, Alfasud, British designs
including Kent 4-cylinder (Cortina, Pinto, therefore Formula Ford). High
resistance to knock, little tendency to build up combustion deposits and
therefore octane requirement tends not to increase as much during the life of
the engine. Disadvantage: higher exhaust emissions. 

This may be named, but I'm not sure, for one S.D. Heron, also credited with
inventing the internally-cooled valve, filled with sodium.

Subject: Back on line

Please put me back on Porschephiles. I went off line eight months ago 
when my wife and I took off for Mexico and Central America via Aerostar 
Van with two dogs. Went across Canada and down the West Coast to the tip of 
Baja where we stayed for two months. Then off via car ferry to Mazatlan and 
down the West Coast of Mexico to Tapachula, crossed the border into 
Guatemala, then, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to Costa Rica where 
we stayed for two months in San Jose and then back via Tikal in 
Guatemala, Belize, Mexico and home. 23,800 miles in all. Roads varied 
from unlimited speed to a stretch of 100 miles that took seven hours on 
the way to Tikal in Guatemala. Driving in all these countries would 
delight any Porsche driver. I suspect that either a 911 or a 356 would 
make the journey except for the Tikal stretch which the 356 might make. No 
one pays attention to speed limits and double lines and police ignore traffic 
violations. If you didn't ignore double lines in the mountains, you would 
not be able to get by the heavy truck traffic that is nose to tail with 
no room to squeeze between. It is all or nothing. Mexico is the land of 
the Vdub beetle. They still manufacture them. There are interesting 
variations that are developed in Baja California. The top is chopped off 
to the back of the rear seats with a section left just aft of the driver 
and passenger compartment. Rear seats are left open to the sun, but the 
driver/passenger have the option of buttoning on a cloth top as a sun 
shade. Not a car for New England. Saw only one Porsche after we crossed 
out of the States. That was a 911 Carrera in Costa Rica. It was a 94 or 
95 and must have cost around $200,000. They have a 100% duty on new cars.

Subject: Re: 73 911 2.4 S converted into 2.7 RS lightweight

Michael,

A real RS lightweight is a very special car and it would take several pages
to describe the differences between it and a 2.4S.

A 2.4S engine can easily be converted to a 2.7 911.83 engine that the RS's
had and properly done is a great engine.  If the engine has been completely
gone through correctly and with detail you are looking at $10,000 for the
coversion of the engine alone.

As for the chassis, it would be virtually impossible to convert the chassis
to a "real" lightweight as the lightweight was made of special, thinner steel
and used lightweight glass.
It could be made to look like a lightweight.

As to the value of such a car, that is hard to estimate without actually
seeing the car.  Improperly done, it is a 2.4S conversion worth less than a
proper example-this is only my opinion but try and sell such a car and you
will see the problems.

Properly done (a rare find), it is probably worth somewhat more, maybe a
little more, than a 2.4S. $24,000 US might be in the ball park for a really
nice conversion.

If you are really interested in this car I would:1. Buy "The RS 
Book" and learn about RS's.  It is advertised in most Porsche magazines but
is expensive, around $250 US and 2. have the car inspected by a reputable
Porche shop.

My Porsches are insured with Nationwide. In fact my 914 has been with

The carrera was put on the policy when I got the car a few years back 
with no problem. Their rates are by far the best I have access to for 
the porsches. 

I have now moved the Carrera over the Porsche Club insurance with 
Leland West. They adv in pano. 

There are many restrictions with this policy and it is not for the 
"daily driver". But if you do not use your Porsche for other than 
pleasure and have other cars for daily drivers you can save a bunch of 
money with this insurance. The Carrera costs $250.00 for the year with 
stated value-this is a true stated value backed up by an appraisal. All 
drivers must be over 25 and have clean driving record. They do ck BTW.

For the record insurance is in Calif and I am definately over 31.

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Well we worked out the deal on the 2.0, $4900 of which I loaned 
him $1000 so I guess that makes me part owner of yet another P-car :^)
About the exhaust system, Has Bursch header and muffler which was 
installed at engine rebuild and stainless steel heat exchangers that are 
eight years old and put out good heat.  All emission controls were removed 
very near new (my 924 was like this) as NC has VERY liberal inspections.  
The owner made the "always garaged, never in rain" claim which usually 
I would be suspicious.  But this car looks the part, has a 3 car garage 
and I looked HARD for rust and could find NONE.  I even went so far as  
to take up a lot of the carpet, even behind the seats on our test drive  
(didn't want the owner to sh*t his pants :^)
	My brother is SO happy to have found such a great car.  We pick 
it up tomorrow, can't wait to see how a stock 914's handling compares to 
my 924 and my Corvair/914.  He likes the '76 bumpers, he thinks they 
blend better with the lines of the fender, kind of extending the line on 
the end of the fenders at the parking lamps.  I'll agree with him on 
that, though I would like the integrated fog lamps and lesser weight the 
early bumpers offer.  Question, any good way of removing the "innards" of 
these bumpers to lighten them up?  How about just replacing the heavy 
back bumper with the earlier kind, are they easily interchangeable and 
will it help the front/rear balance?  
Thanks for any ideas.

Subject: 924 Compression and Superchargers


Okay folks, here's the hot info you've been waiting for. No yawns,
please. The Compression ratios for the 924 are:

Normal:
	Euro, ROW: 9.3:1, all years 1976-84 or so

	USA, Canada, Japan: 8.1:1, 1976-77.5
                            8.5:1, 1977.5-80.5
			    9.1:1, 1980.5-82

Turbo:  Euro, ROW: 8.5:1, All years
	
	USA, Canada, Japan: 8.0:1, 1979-80
			    8.5:1, 1981-82


The head is different between the normal and turbo. The pistons will
hit on a turbo, but not on a normal.

John Butera, of hot rod fame as a manufacturer of billet accessories for
Chevy and Ford hot rods, had a 924 which he installed a small vane-type
supercharger. He used a small 4-barrel carb to feed it. It ran pretty
well, but the turbo 924 happened along and it was much neater.

The head design is different between the two, they are not interchange-
able for use. True, the roadracers use the turbo head because it flows 
better, but that use requires special pistons because of the combustion 
chamber design to get any sort of decent compression.

There are three different heads for the normal, 1976-77.5, 1977.5 -80.5
and 1980.5-84. All work well, the latter two being the best (Larger 
valves, improved ports).

     The 911 motors have an oil thermostat, which the 914s don't.  I think 
     that a flap scheme like the 914 or for that matter VW type 1 motors 
     would not work with the 911 fan/shroud setup.  I think the oil 
     thermosat accomplishes a similar purpose.  Remember that any flap 
     scheme when fully open still adds restrictions which reduces air flow. 
     The 911 motor was originally designed for a race car environment and 
     the cooling requirements at full load/temperature where more 
     important.

Subject: 911 Purchase Questions



     Hello All,

          After getting my first Issue of the Porsche Market Letter and
     checking out the various asking prices, I've narrowed down my car
     selection to a 1989 911 Cabriolet.

     A few questions:

     I understand that for older un-galvanized Porsches, that getting a
     California or Arizona (or anywhere without snow) car is preferred due 
to
     the salt making the vehicle rust.  Is this still a concern for the 
modern
     galvanized cars. If so what part of them suffers from the salt?

     Does anyone know the number of 1989 911 cabriolets that were built?
     And what colors were they available in. I personally would like a color 
other
     than red, white or black, but it seems that is the most common
     color from the ads that I have seen. Is this info in Brett's new book?

     The car I'm looking for would be totally stock, low mileage, preferable 
blue
     or grey. If you've seen (or have) this car for sale let me know. 
Preferably on
     the best (west) coast, as I live in Vancouver, B.C. Canada.

     Thanks

I had my Paris Rhone rebuilt at a local alternator and starter shop, cost
was $165cdn,(about $120US), and I had it back in two days. It may have
helped that the shop owner has a 944 turbo but this is considerably cheaper
and quicker than anything I've seen advertised in Excellence and gave
business to a fellow enthusiast.

Stan is giving off those negative vibes again!

I read in the new European Car that the latest Audi T4 has a 9.5:1
compression ratio and a turbo. According to Stans calculations, either it
runs 0.0001 bar or it won't last last five minutes because it's not a race
engine! Maybe it's only Porsches that can't run high compression ratios and
turbos.

Lighten up Stan, you can get more power out of a Porsche!

speed in proportion to engine speed.  This would also permit the amount of
boost to be backed off at high RPMs (we don't need no steenking wastegates!).

No, YOU lighten up.  I don't agree with Stan everytime, but in this case
he patiently outlined the applicable numbers in response to a (naive

I believe that a factory race version of the 944 turbo engine 
had 16 valves and produced 450 hp.  My understanding is that 
the performance gains for going with 4 valves/cylinder on a turbo
engine are minimal.  Both items are trying to accomplish the 
same thing - flow more air.  This little bit of power gain can
be crucial in a race engine.  When traded off with the added 
complexity and maintenance the factory apparently didn't feel
like it was worth it for a street engine.

The reason for seeing no 4 valve/cylinder 911 engines is different.
The heads can't be kept cool enough in the air cooled engine to use
4 valves/cylinder.  As far as I know, all of the 911 based race 
engines that used 4 valves/cylinder had water cooled heads.

The 1979 Lemans car was a turbo/4-valve. The boys at andial tell me they
have two conversions running around with 2.8 l-4 valve turbos. Porsche must
figure the street cars aren't worth the longevity risk. Of course they felt
fine about the clutch lasting 30 k mi.

I have been unable to get the complete text of Senate 440, but here's what
I've been able to find out. Repeal of the national speed limit has been
attached to the bill as an amendment, is not in the original bill. If/when
you contact your senator, it's important to emphasize that you are in favor
of this part of the bill. Otherwise they may cross it off, thinking you
approve of whatever else is in there and don't care about the speed limit.

The bill was introduced by John Warner, Republican, of Virginia, in February.
I know California's Democratic senator Barbara Boxer voted yes in committe.
Some info I got says it has 17 Democratic and 13 Republican cosponsors so
far, but that can't be entirely right, because one of the cosponsors listed
is Lautenberg, who is against repeal of the limit. Maybe he was in favor
until that amendment was added.

Sen. Boxer's office promised to send me a copy of the bill as it left
committee.

Again, we need to take action NOW to tell our senators that we favor repeal
of the national speed limit.

Kevin, I'm in Vancouver too, and am keeping my eyes open for a 911.  I'm 
thinking of making the purchase towards the end of the summer or in the 
early autumn though.  Keep me posted on your search.  I would be very 
interested in what you find whilst you are on your quest, as it will 
probably be very useful for me when the time comes.

P-folks,

I'm heading over to Jerry's (jrb@one.com) house this p.m. to cut the passenger-
side fender off the 914 chassis he's putting to rest this weekend.  I just 
bought my first P this past weekend.  Only major damage to the body was a 
parking lot tag to the passenger-side front fender.  While it's certainly 
driveable (boy, is it ever!), I'm hoping to pull his fender so I have a 
replacement for later in the summer (once he and I learn to weld).

Any advice on how much extra/where to cut?  TIA.

I wouldn't be surprised if there were no difference in emission standards. A
well tuned 49-state car will be well under Ca emission standards. I've heard
that the distinguishing factor between 49-state and Ca cars is whether or not
the smog tax has been paid to the state. I brought a '92 Sable into Ca from
out of state and it was significantly below all standards. That didn't free me
from paying the extra smog tax on the car.

I have a full set of 916 glass that I'll get to one of these years.  First
and foremost, I want to get my 914 on the road.  I've seen many different
914 kits(including, IMHO, the ridiculous 9014 kit from AA).  

Most, if not all, require professional installation, and significant outlay
of money.  I feel that the only flattering things to be done to a 914 are
the GT/916 flares(steel over fiberglass) and the 916 bumpers.

Neither of the bumpers of any 914 I know of are welded on.  You can drop them
off the car in 10 minutes.   Personally, I would avoid any body kit that
requires major panel replacement.

There's an interesting Chalon kit in one of the aftermarket catelogs.  Sort
of a slant-nose, make the rear more like a 911-type job.  Thanks but no
thanks.

I like the 914 the way it is:  Sure they're boxy, but the engines in the 
middle.

Up to serial number 1028 (if my memory serves correctly) the body and

  None of that will matter if the body isn't absolutely rust-free as well.

  $8,000 seems to be an extreme price for a 914 that is *NOT* an pure

Someone could have gone to the trouble, I suppose, to install a soft
rear window that looks factory, but it's IMO unlikely.  Virtually any
combination of existing options could be ordered.  For example, I knew
someone who had a '69 912 ordered with 911S instruments.  Why?
Because it looked nice.  The 912, so I understand, sold much better in
the US, where most of the time one can only fantasize about going
fast.  In Chermany they hated it--it blew up on the Autobahn.

Sounds like a nice collector car if everything else is nice.

I have a few questions.
      What kind of costs are invloved for the equipment.  I have access to a
compressor and I can most likely borrow a spray gun.  But what else do I need
as far as equipment(other then the stuff needed to do bodywork)

   What kind of costs are invvolved in the paint.  I am sure you can buy
paint for a $1-1000+ but I am looking for a general idea of what it will cost
to cover a 914.  The paint does not have to on original Porsche color or
anythig like that.  A color that I really like is the BMW Iguana Green and
the Deep Metalic Purple that are on the Vetts.
    Is metalic pants or any one type of paint harder for the do it
yourselfer?  More importantly is one type of paint easier then any other.

I have recently purchased an 86 Carrera that was originally imported from
Argentenia (sp?), I do have paperwork that the importer had it bot DOT and
EPA certified. This mostly included installing a lamda sensor.  

What kind of difference can I expect when comparing this car to one that 
was built for distrubution in America?  For example, would I still be 
able to use an aftermarket chip or are these only programed for the 
"americanized" 911? 

Does anyone know what the factory specs are for 0-60, 1/4 mile 
and HP ratings? 

Everything I've read seems to conflict and I'm not sure if being a Euro
motor makes any difference... (The manual that the dealer supplied was 
for an 87-anyone wanna trade?)

Also what is the going rate for this car?  I traded two other porsches in 
for this one (and 87 924s C- and a 82 911SC B-) so I it hard to say what 
I acutally paid for this, probably about 19K, it is in A-/B+ condition, 
has 70Kmiles and 17" RUF Wheels.  Also has the Carrera tail, but I am 
assuming that this was standard as the leather interior is...

I did just have the 60K service done and the car has a pretty clean bill 
of health, except a syncro gear (1st) is starting to go, but the extended 
warranty is goning to pick that up....

        Several schools of thought on this:
On the 993 Turbo--Porsche has never figured out a way to four-valve an
air-cooled motor with a reasonable lifetime.  Some of the motorcycle
companies have, but they're working under a different set of constraints.
My guess is that it's (at least partly) a heat problem--and a boosted
engine (turbo- or super-charged) would aggravate that.
        On why they never made a 4-valve 951--speculation is that they
didn't want to blow the doors off their "flagship", the 930...  If you
look at the 924 GTP/GTS/GTR (whichever was the right one), you see what
can be done when you do the 4-valve turbo properly...  Ether that or
there is some technical reason why--maybe engine lifespan, again; or
possibly expense...

I believe that a factory race version of the 944 turbo engine 
had 16 valves and produced 450 hp.  My understanding is that 
the performance gains for going with 4 valves/cylinder on a turbo
engine are minimal.  Both items are trying to accomplish the 
same thing - flow more air.  This little bit of power gain can
be crucial in a race engine.  When traded off with the added 
complexity and maintenance the factory apparently didn't feel
like it was worth it for a street engine.

The reason for seeing no 4 valve/cylinder 911 engines is different.
The heads can't be kept cool enough in the air cooled engine to use
4 valves/cylinder.  As far as I know, all of the 911 based race 
engines that used 4 valves/cylinder had water cooled heads.

I wound up trying the 3M spray "super" adhesive to reattach the coverings
on the door panels for my 911.  It took a little practice to get the
coverage right since it comes squirting out of the can pretty hard.  It
gives just about the right amout of time to get things positioned and
taught before setting up, and seems to hold well once cured (so far).
Thanks to those who sent suggestions and recommendations.

Greetings P-files:

At the recent Automotion Swap I came upon (and purchased) a factory add-on 
cruise control system.  NOS, still in the box with the Porsche/VW label etc. 
 There is a date on the box of 1978, so I suspect it will 74-83?

Does anyone have any experience with this unit?  Does anyone have a need for 
it?  I doubt it will fit my 73 but it was such a good deal... you know.

The 1979 Lemans car was a turbo/4-valve. The boys at andial tell me they
have two conversions running around with 2.8 l-4 valve turbos. Porsche must
figure the street cars aren't worth the longevity risk. Of course they felt
fine about the clutch lasting 30 k mi.

Subject: Re: #More on speed limit law

I have been unable to get the complete text of Senate 440, but here's what
I've been able to find out. Repeal of the national speed limit has been
attached to the bill as an amendment, is not in the original bill. If/when
you contact your senator, it's important to emphasize that you are in favor
of this part of the bill. Otherwise they may cross it off, thinking you
approve of whatever else is in there and don't care about the speed limit.

The bill was introduced by John Warner, Republican, of Virginia, in February.
I know California's Democratic senator Barbara Boxer voted yes in committe.
Some info I got says it has 17 Democratic and 13 Republican cosponsors so
far, but that can't be entirely right, because one of the cosponsors listed
is Lautenberg, who is against repeal of the limit. Maybe he was in favor
until that amendment was added.

Sen. Boxer's office promised to send me a copy of the bill as it left
committee.

Again, we need to take action NOW to tell our senators that we favor repeal
of the national speed limit.

I wouldn't be surprised if there were no difference in emission standards. A
well tuned 49-state car will be well under Ca emission standards. I've heard
that the distinguishing factor between 49-state and Ca cars is whether or not
the smog tax has been paid to the state. I brought a '92 Sable into Ca from
out of state and it was significantly below all standards. That didn't free me
from paying the extra smog tax on the car.

I have a full set of 916 glass that I'll get to one of these years.  First
and foremost, I want to get my 914 on the road.  I've seen many different
914 kits(including, IMHO, the ridiculous 9014 kit from AA).  

Most, if not all, require professional installation, and significant outlay
of money.  I feel that the only flattering things to be done to a 914 are
the GT/916 flares(steel over fiberglass) and the 916 bumpers.

Neither of the bumpers of any 914 I know of are welded on.  You can drop them
off the car in 10 minutes.   Personally, I would avoid any body kit that
requires major panel replacement.

There's an interesting Chalon kit in one of the aftermarket catelogs.  Sort
of a slant-nose, make the rear more like a 911-type job.  Thanks but no
thanks.

I like the 914 the way it is:  Sure they're boxy, but the engines in the 
middle.

Up to serial number 1028 (if my memory serves correctly) the body and

  None of that will matter if the body isn't absolutely rust-free as well.

  $8,000 seems to be an extreme price for a 914 that is *NOT* an pure

Someone could have gone to the trouble, I suppose, to install a soft
rear window that looks factory, but it's IMO unlikely.  Virtually any
combination of existing options could be ordered.  For example, I knew
someone who had a '69 912 ordered with 911S instruments.  Why?
Because it looked nice.  The 912, so I understand, sold much better in
the US, where most of the time one can only fantasize about going
fast.  In Chermany they hated it--it blew up on the Autobahn.

Sounds like a nice collector car if everything else is nice.

paint for a $1-1000+ but I am looking for a general idea of what it will cost
to cover a 914.  The paint does not have to on original Porsche color or
anythig like that.  A color that I really like is the BMW Iguana Green and
the Deep Metalic Purple that are on the Vetts.
    Is metalic pants or any one type of paint harder for the do it
yourselfer?  More importantly is one type of paint easier then any other.  

I bought a couple of books on painting so I have a lot of reading but I
always like to hear real  peoples input.

Subject: 914 cold starting

I have the same cold start problem with my '70 914.I solved 
the problem by putting a variable resistor in the wire from 
the head temperature sensor. I used a 0 to 1000 ohm unit. By 
adding resistance the brain thinks it is colder than it
really is and makes the injection pulses longer. Can anyone 
tell me what changed in the brain to make this added
resistance necessary? It seems obvious that with the added
resistance the engine is going to be running too rich when
it gets hot, but it seems to be O.K.

Subject: 86 Carrera

I have recently purchased an 86 Carrera that was originally imported from
Argentenia (sp?), I do have paperwork that the importer had it bot DOT and
EPA certified. This mostly included installing a lamda sensor.  

What kind of difference can I expect when comparing this car to one that 
was built for distrubution in America?  For example, would I still be 
able to use an aftermarket chip or are these only programed for the 
"americanized" 911? 

Does anyone know what the factory specs are for 0-60, 1/4 mile 
and HP ratings? 

Everything I've read seems to conflict and I'm not sure if being a Euro
motor makes any difference... (The manual that the dealer supplied was 
for an 87-anyone wanna trade?)

Also what is the going rate for this car?  I traded two other porsches in 
for this one (and 87 924s C- and a 82 911SC B-) so I it hard to say what 
I acutally paid for this, probably about 19K, it is in A-/B+ condition, 
has 70Kmiles and 17" RUF Wheels.  Also has the Carrera tail, but I am 
assuming that this was standard as the leather interior is...

I did just have the 60K service done and the car has a pretty clean bill 
of health, except a syncro gear (1st) is starting to go, but the extended 
warranty is goning to pick that up....

Thanks for any information provided!

        Several schools of thought on this:
On the 993 Turbo--Porsche has never figured out a way to four-valve an
air-cooled motor with a reasonable lifetime.  Some of the motorcycle
companies have, but they're working under a different set of constraints.
My guess is that it's (at least partly) a heat problem--and a boosted
engine (turbo- or super-charged) would aggravate that.
        On why they never made a 4-valve 951--speculation is that they
didn't want to blow the doors off their "flagship", the 930...  If you
look at the 924 GTP/GTS/GTR (whichever was the right one), you see what
can be done when you do the 4-valve turbo properly...  Ether that or

Prior to that point, the logo only consisted of the 'Porsche' script.

Subject: Remove: 944 Stone Guards

Tim,
I have removed them from an 83 and an 86 944.  We removed them because 
the plastic was cracked and looked worse than what I thought it would 
look like after I removed them.  In both cases - I was right.

I used a heat gun to heat the plastic - but you could probably use a hot 
hair dryer.  You'll visibly see the plastic change when it gets hot.  
Then I used a plastic Bondo spatula to scrap off as much plastic as I 
could.  You can use your hand to find those areas that still have a lot 
of plastic.  You want to remove as much plastic as you can, b/c step 2 is 
harder and the less you have left to remove - the better.

After the majority of the plastic is off - you'll want to use an adhesive 
remover to remove the remaining stuff.  I would try 3M's Adhesive 
Remover.  But when I did the two cars - I wasn't aware of that product 
and I used Gumout.  I would spray it on - wait about a minute and scrap.  
I would repeat this until the surface was just paint - no adhesive.

I then would clean the painted area and apply wax.

It took me about 45min to 1hr per rear stone guard.  I have never removed 
the front guards.

The results look great.  It looks so much better without them.

Tim,
  I just happened to have replaced my stone guards this weekend
  (actually my kids did most of it).  The yellowed guards, with the dirt
  that traps around the edges, were the worst looking part of the car,
  and replacing them helped greatly.  The job was fairly easy - I don't
  know about others' reports of it being difficult, but maybe factors
  such as film type or age complicates matters.

  We didn't have much trouble getting the old guards off.
  The guards themselves all peeled right off within a few minutes,
  without using any heat.  We used alcohol and gasoline to remove
  the adhesive, because that's what was handy, and spent a few minutes
  cleaning the car after removing each guard.  It got the job done,
  but I suppose a real adhesive remover would've worked better.

  For the new guards, I bought a 6' x 1' (or so) roll of the
  3M Scotchcal film (product 051141-84911) at the body shop supplier,
  for $40.  I was a walk-in, so better pricing must be available
  with some effort or with connections.  This stuff is non-yellowing,
  and hopefully better than the original.  I used about half of the roll,
  so if you can split a roll with someone, that gets it down to $20
  for one car.  Just make sure you cut the patterns sensibly from the roll,
  to avoid waste.  Sure, the pre-cut guards I've seen for about
  $90-$200 a set would have made life easier, but not enough
  to get my money.  Some of the pre-cuts apparently use the same 3M film.

  Having to cut the guards was a slight disadvantage, but my daughter
  is good at that kind of thing and it wasn't a big deal.  For a pattern,
  we used the removed guard.  Keep in mind that the guard may stretch
  somewhat when removing.  Alternatively, you could make a pattern
  by holding paper over the existing guard before removing, and running
  a piece of chalk flat-wise over the guard edges.
  
  The 3M film simply requires wetting down the film back and the car
  with an alcohol solution, and then squeegeeing the film onto the car.
  This was trivial for the 4 thin guards, and a little more difficult
  for the 2 middle wide ones.  But, with a little patience
  it's completely manageable.

  The final result was well worth it.  It's a relatively easy
  and inexpensive do-it-yourself project, and one where my kids
  were able (yes - willingly) to contribute.

    To paint, a minimum 2hp compressor is needed. I believe you can paint
 with a cheap paint gun -if- you are experienced enough to set it up right,
 but I've used a Binks Model 7 for about 15 years (they are over $200 now).
 Lastly, you will need a water trap and regulator located by the gun (another
 $40).  Other than that, just good lighting and an open bench to mix paint on.
   Oh, don't forget the safety aspect. Always wear gloves, I wear disposable
 latex with urethanes and heavy rubber gloves when using lacquer thinner. And
 you'll need a good air mask, NOT A DUST MASK, for about $40.

>   What kind of costs are involved in the paint...

   Say $30 a gallon for cheaper acrylic enamel up to $75 a quart for better
urethanes. I would only use the cheaper acrylic enamel on a cheap car as
practice anymore... the urethanes are expensive but worth it.
    As far as color, red pigments are the most expensive.
 The last car I just did, I spent about $120 on primers alone and about
$260 on the color/clear hardener. Good paint is expensive. Using cheap paint 
in the long run is very expensive....

>   Is metalic pants or any one type of paint harder for the do it
>   yourselfer? More importantly is one type of paint easier than another...

   Metallics are -evil-, just hard as dickens to spray well. I keep a clean
 pair of bolts in the can (constantly shake the can, the bolts help stir (i
 suppose). Use thin coats at every angle. Going too heavy will kill you
 ("mottling") making the car look splotchy.
   Lacquers are famous for being easy to work, easy to repair. But they have
 just don't last and a 5-year old laquer job will crack right off the car...
 The urethanes can be buffed quite nicely, which is critical because of the
 dust issues in the garage and the orange peel amateur painters just get....

     A good paint job relies on several things;
  1. Great preparation thru the primer. This is where all the time goes.
      Strip the car completely of every piece of trim--try not to use any
      masking tape when you paint.  You'll be sick and tired of your car after
      you've done this right...
  2. A good paint booth; I've gone to a lot of work installing filters,
     plastic sheathing, etc. I line about 8 box fans under the garage door
     when I paint; it evacuates both dust and fumes. I hang the hood and
     trunk deck vertically for lower dust. All this helps, but it is nowhere
     near a real paint booth.
       Bob Spindel has told me about a DXF-7 "supercharger" that quickens dry
     time of the PPG urethanes, getting a quicker time "out of dust" when
     painting in the garage.  And his '72E is a beauty...
  3. Practice, practice, practice....you'll paint a lot of ugly cars before
     you paint a beauty. There are so many things to watch out for, and your
     friends are not going to be impressed with the first car you paint.
     "Spray day" is the most intense hour that you'll spend, when you get
     there you really have to know what you are doing and GO !

    Keep in mind, the best you can be is a good amateur. Treat the paints and
  solvents as the toxic chemicals they are and go have fun....

Subject: Nate's driveway paint jobs

References: 
 

    I saw another happy p-filer asking about cheap DIY paint jobs, which
happens to be right up my alley...

    First of all, don't skimp on bodywork.  If there is any rust, cut it
out and weld in a patch.  If you don't, you will be sorry.  I like to
use an electric 4" grinder, with a grinding wheel for removing surface
rust and a cutoff wheel for removing rotted areas.  I suppose a die
grinder would work better if you had the money to invest in two tools.
    Don't be afraid of body filler... it's OK if used PROPERLY. Don't
use it to fill holes (you can get away with bondo and fiberglass screen,
but why take chances when you're spending all that $ for paint?)  Never
use it to fill dents, if you have dents, pop them back out and then use
the bondo for a skim coat to level the surface.  Don't be afraid to
cover a whole panel in bondo and then sand most of it back off... that's
how you get a smooth finish.
    Sanding... don't get too fancy here.  ALWAYS use some kind of block,
but other than that all you need some kind of elbow grease.  I like a
long 2x4, with some of those sheets designed for an air sander stapled
to it (80 grit) and also a 2x6, shorter, with regular 80-grit stapled to
it.  Run the sandpaper over the edge of a door to flex the backing,
it'll last longer.  I have one of those straight-line air sanders, but
frankly, I prefer a piece of wood.  After this, you need to go to finer
paper, I use wet-or-dry 120, wet, followed by 320 wet (the recommended
surface finish for most paints.)  If you get bare metal at any step,
spray primer over a large area around the spot before continuing.  At
this point, the car should look and feel perfectly sommth with a nice
matte finish.  Use your hands... run them over the whole car to detect
any irregularities.
    On the wet-or-dry papers, I use a hard rubber block, like the ones
3M sells at Kmart, etc.  Over areas that I have repaired and sanded with
80-grit, I often use a skim coat of glazing putty to fill in the sanding
scratches before using the wet-or-dry.  Saves a lot of time, and if I am
having a good day, I can go straight from 80-grit to 320.  This also
lessens your chance of sanding throught to bare metal, which actually
would be a good thing, were it not for the fact that your underlying
sheetmetal is probably not perfectly straight (if it IS, then go ahead
and take it down.... but make sure before you start, or you're going to
have to use about 20 coats of sanding primer to get it flat again!) I
cannot say enough about the importance of using a block... old paint,
bondo, and glazing putty all have different resistances to being sanded
away... if you don't use a block, it will show.  Every repair you have
done to your car will be painfully obvious.
    If you have any body filler on areas where the filler is exposed on
the backside, you MUST paint it.  I use rust-oleum rusty metal primer
coated with rust-oleum semigloss black on any exposed filler that does
not get painted when I spray the car.  If you don't do this, the filler
WILL get soaked with water and it WILL rust, and you'll have to go back
and do it all over again.  You may want to spend the extra money and get
special water-resistant filler, I would still paint it anyway.  Paint
the backside of all your welded patches, too.
    Next... priming and painting.  Always use a water trap on your
compressor... I use a big permanent one at the compressor, with one of
those little disposable ones right before the spray gun.  I go through
about 2 disposable ones for every paint job.  Most people will recommend
that you prime the whole car before going any farther, and I would agree
that that is a good idea.  However, the last car I painted was a '78
Impala, and we just sprayed the paint right over the old stuff.  It
still looks good 2 yrs. later, no flaking anywhere.  That's what happens
when you sand the whole car properly!  If you do prime, use a lot, and
then sand the whole car again.  It's the only way.
    When you spray the car, make sure your gun is adjusted for a proper
pattern.  Make nice, even strokes.  I'ts prob. a good idea to practice
on some scrap beforehand.  Metallics are evil, the Impala I did was
metallic blue and it has a very faint orange peel finish because if I
laid the paint on thick enough to get a smooth surface, the metallic
would "run" inside the paint.  Very bad.   Also make sure that you use
the correct reducer for the temperature conditions, and if you paint in
your driveway, do it in the morning as soon as the fog has lifted.  A
cloudy but warm day would be ideal, as you don't want to be painting in
the direct sun.
    For paint, I would recommend a urethane enamel, with hardener.  It
will look much better than any other paint, and using PPG stuff on the
Impala still cost us under $200 for everything.  I'm sure others on the
list can point you to the higher end stuff they recommend, I have heard
good things about Sikkens, for example.
    So there it is... a job a hell of a lot better than Maaco and a lot
cheaper, too.  If anyone has any questions and/or comments, fell free...
and if you are shocked that I would attempt to do a car so cheaply, all
I have to say is, it was a cheap car, and I think I have probably
doubled its value.  (Well, the back of the frame rotted away about 1
month after I painted it, and had to be welded... then a big rock fell
on the hood - very scary - but I digress...)  If you think I skimped,
you're right... and you can bet I will spend a whole lot more when I do
my p-car!

later,

Nate

    I think I got most of the stuff covered in the thing I posted to the
list... one thing I did forget is ALWAYS USE A TACK RAG before you spray
on any color coats.  Also, if you use either lacquer or urethane enamel,
you can color-sand and buff the car to a perfectly mirror-like gloss,
which looks pretty cool.  You have the important stuff, just use a water
trap and you're set.  If you want to paint your car inside, I would
recommend covering the inside of your garage with plastic and hosing the
whole thing down, including the floor.  Dust can be a real problem
indoors.  Also, make sure you have some kind of ventilation, and
especially if you are working inside, invest in some kind of breathing
protection.  If you can think of anything I didn't cover, feel free to
drop me a line...

later,

Nate

PS - I seem to remember that you wanted to change the color of your
914.... I would almost say that's a bda idea, as you would have to
disassemble the whole car to get it right.  Instead why don't you trade
me your black one for my red one ;)

- --Boundary-8863412-0-0

There's an excellent chance that you are looking at a factory 69 softback.  I 
have a 68 and for some time was under the impression that 68 was the last year 
for the softback. 68's were availabe from the factory with glass beginning 
abut halfway thru the production run. 69's are rare but apparently they could 
be ordered.  I've seen one or two.  Many softbacks were converted to glass 
windows. This was a much better and cheaper fix than replacing the vinyl in 
the 70's.  For convenience sake, the glass is better but IMHO lacks the 
character of the top down roll bar look.  Commonly, when it was time to 
repaint the car, the owner would buy the glass and have the fastener holes 
brazed up or filled and pop it in.  The vinyl back has it drawbacks.  Unless 
it's really warm outside the  window is a bear to zip and unzip, they will 
crack in very cold temps, and they wear out faster than the glass.  A new 
factory back will cost you up to $2K.  After market ones can be had for $500 
but the materials can't compare.  Check for release handles under the targa 
bar.  They should be there.  I saw one 69 with a softback and no release 
mechanism, probably not factory. Also check that there is a boot for the 
window when down.  I don't think these are available from the aftermarket.  If 
there is one try to gage whether it is original, pull up German snap 
fasteners, etc.  It's more likely that a Targa would have been a softback, and 
converted to glass than the other way around. 
Hope this helps.

Subject: Tire Sizes

I have a 1968 912 with 6" Fuchs, and went down to the tire shop
to look for new rubber.

Decided I don't want the stock 165/70R15's and wanted to do something
wider but with a high enough profile where the speedo is still accurate
and I can cruise along with my 4-speed box without winding out the engine.

So I saw some nice 205/65x15's that have about the same height profile but
I don't think there's any way those will fit on a '68 as the fenders aren't
flared on a 912 until '69.  Next best guess: 195/70x15, but I would have to
special order them.  Anybody know what I can fit without scraping on the
struts/fenders but still keep the right profile?

I think scraping on turns is something you can prevent with adjusting a turning
stop somewhere up front.  Anyone know about that?

Subject: Drawing for 69 912.

Hello Everyone,
I am sure this will either generate interest or flames.

I am in pursuit of getting a 911...
In lieu of this, I need to capitalize on my 912.
I am going to hold a drawing to give away my 69 912. The car is not
absoulutly perfect but is in very good to excellent condition. 120k
miles. There is one small rust bubble on the lower left front fender.
The battery area is missing some paint but there is still plenty of
steel there and is very solid. It was looked over at D&M in Palo Alto, CA
and was given a clean bill of health.."best I've seen in a while".
Grey w/black interior, CA original car and here ever since. The
engine was rebuilt by the previous owner's mechanic about 20k ago and is
very strong. I have some recent compression #'s but not right in front
of me. It has been repainted (original color), The interior is excellent
except for the typical crack in the dash near the speaker. It has: Flofit
sport seats,weber carbs(w/velocity stacks & K&N air cleaners), 050 
distributor w/Perlux ignitor, Bursch exhaust, cookie cutters(15x6) w/new
BFG tires, recent alignment, bronze phosphor pedal bushings, euro tail
lenses, retractable seat belts, new ball joints, new trans mounts, rear 
"amco" bar, etc.. It has an A/C system partially installed, blower motor,
interior ducting. The compressor, condensor, and hoses from the rear are not
installed and I think I have all those parts. It is turn key and ready to 
be driven away by the winner.

I want to sell 200 entries at $50 US each for a total of $10,000. $1000
of which will be given to the Porschephiles Fund. All entries MUST(sorry)
be sold by the closing date or all monies will be refunded and the car and 
donation will NOT be given away. All rules, terms, conditions will be 
stated on the entry form. If you are interested, please e-mail me directly
and I will e-mail you an entry form. sean@scifi.ucsf.edu. This will give
me an early idea if there is an interest.

Dates: All entries to be sold by August 1, 1995. The drawing (pending the
sale of all entries) will be on August 11, 1995. This will allow all checks
moneyorders to be cleared prior to the drawing.

Hope to hear from you.

Hi P-philes,
I've lurked on this list long enough, I've been dying to ask this question.
I have a 72 914 which has a blown engine. I think a valve guide went bad 
and got swallowed. From my VW's which I overhauled, I think I want to put 
Hydralics with associated cam and lifters, and convert it to electronic 
spark. It has 81k on the engine, so I probably need to put in new 
bearings and oil pump. Would you guys do anything else? How would you 
update a 1.7 engine. Lots of power in unecessary, reliablity is important.

I'm interested, provided you do some research.  Specifically, what 
will it cost me if I win: registration, title transfer, TAXES, 
obscure fees levied by the state, smog, all of that?  How much of 
this BS are you going to pay out of the take, and how much will the 
winner be responsible for? How are you going to guarantee this 
shtick--lawyer, escrow, whatever, who holds the money, how do you 
avoid losing yer shirt, how do we know you won't skip off to mexico 
in your 912 with $10K in a briefcase?

If you can demonstrate that you've really thought this through and
made the correct preparations, and will absorb some/most of the
hidden costs for the winner, I think it'll be great fun.

You will probably end up with about $8K when all is said and done,
for a great deal more trouble than you would have had selling the
car (though I don't know what you could get for it on the market).

The car sounds nice, and I sure wouldn't mind a 912 to play with 
(though I'd probably sell it after a few months to support my 911 
habit).  Count me in (provisionally).

Subject: 944 clutch woe?

My recently arrived  86 944 is turning out to be a problem car.
Latest worry is the clutch, and I am hoping for a diagnosis. When
the car is cold it is very difficult to select a gear and it
has to crunch to go in to either first or reverse. The first few
changes are rather notchy, and after that a trace of notchiness
remains on some changes. This problem seems to have gotten worse
in the week that the car has been on the road, the first 10 days
of my ownership having been spent at the workshop!

Does this sound like a hydraulic problem or of a more mechanical
and presumably therefore more expensive nature.

I would go with the 195/60-15 size tires.  A 6" rim will be perfect for

You should have no trouble finding a decent tire in that size.

Subject: 944 : Helmets, Seat Height, Foot Rest Position

I ran in my first autocross a couple of weeks ago. I had a great time, but
was surprised to find that I could fit in my car ('89 944 S2) with a helmet
on. It seemed like I was an inch or so short of fitting.

I have the full power seats on the driver's side. One suggestion was to
remove the padding (don't like the idea of mangling the seat). Another
suggestion was to get a replacement seat. I called Recaro, and they said
that their seats would not provide any additional head room. Are there
other brands that might?

Another question is whether all helmets add the same dimension to the top
of your head. I assume they do.

To run, I removed the sunroof. This is OK, but it means I can't race on
rainy days. Could a thinner replacement panel be made that I could install
for the race (e.g. remove the inner linner)?

One other question - The foot rest for the left foot seems too low to me.
It is about where the clutch is when pushed in. I would think it would be
better placed to be even with the clutch when the clutch is let out. This
would make for less leg movement when going to engage the clutch. It seems
like they put the rest to be even with the accelerator (which is even with
the brake (when pushed in) for heel-toe). The clutch and the brake are even
when let out. Is this the best arrangement? Can/Should the clutch pedal be
adjusted? Can/Should the foot rest be built up.

                                                Thanks for any suggestions!

Interesting problem.  I've run into this fit problem on my (or should
that be in my) 944.  I move the seat a notch closer to reach the wheel,
and then adjust the rake of the seat so that I fit in with the sunroof
inplace, but "tilted".  There was some problem at the '91 Parade in 
Boston, because they insisted at the autocross that the roof must be
closed.  So, I drove with my head tilted sideways.  For the '92 Parade
here in San Diego, I did some research and got a ruling before the
Parade.  According to the litterature from the factory, the 944 has
a "removable roof pannel" similar to that of a targa.  So, according 
to the PCRs, the removable roof pannel must be in place and attached,
and even with the rear tilted, it was.  So, I got to look at the track
a little nicer in '92.  8-) 

As for a solution that will allow closing the roof, I've been told that
the earlier, non-power seats, sit about 1" lower than the power seats.

I have never heard of a Turbo RS before. Any answers? If anyone does know

Be careful here -- I know that in some organizations, replacing the seat will

Yes, I inquired about this a month or so ago.  Apparently a fairly common
solution is to acquire a used sunroof and just remove the inner liner entirely.
I haven't actually done this yet, so I don't know how much headroom can actually
be gained.

Phellow Philes,

   Next week I am going to visit my SO, who is in the middle of a looong

the trip in Austria, with a brief stop on the way back in Stuttgart :-) 
While I got her to concede me the visit to the Porsche factory/museum, she
doesn't know about the Austrian Porsche sights yet!

    As I understand it, there is a Porsche museum in Gmund (Gmu:nd for the

Furthermore, the Porsche family home is in Zell am See, near Salzburg, and 
is apparently open to visitors.  Has anyone visited either of these sights, 
and could advise me if either one warrants a pilgrimage?  (At possible 
risk of domestic bliss?)

  In return, since questions arise this time of year about the Stuttgart 
sights, I will post the PCNA contact: call Karen at 702-348-3244 a few 
weeks in advance to arrange a tour.  (Although, as has been discussed

this summer for retooling for the Boxster production.)

Never mind obscure fees, this is a lottery and the state will likely
get all upset about it. CA is one of the more enlightened states in that
they allow actual gambling, under highly regulated conditions, but
the idea of a private citizen operating a lottery is not likely to
go down well without greasing the right palms and paying the usual
vig. to the crooks in charge.

You would probably do much better to carry out the business in Nevada.

You are correct on th e924 Carrera and 924 GTS having 2 valves/cylinder.
The 924 GTR also had 2 valves per cylinder except for the prototypes 
using the 944 experimental engine.

The Paul Miller car was a spec car that was hindered by a looseleaf rule
book that penalized it each time it wen5t faster than the junk it had

a 2 valve head.

producing 305hp on a 2-valve 3.0 engine. (Torque: 500 newtons @3000 rpm).

0-100 kph (62mph) 5.0 secs topspeed 280kph (~175mph).
The article said they would build a max. of 100 for GT-racing. I suppose
anybody with enough $ could buy one (the price was not quoted).

This is the kind of power the 968 needs. In my opinion, the 968CS needs
more power - the engine just doesn't feel up to the body... (_NOW_ I'm
gonna get flamed :-) ). My guess is, that the Turbo S would be too much of a 
threat to the 911 Carrera to be put on the street as a normal production
model. (The car in the pictures _does_ have plates)

Hi Again,

Since most of us are apparently driving cars that we bought used,

what is the best way to determine if the shocks need to be replaced?

Obviously, if they're leaking or the car is floating on rough surfaces,
they needed to be replaced yesterday. And I'm sure that if I buy a new
set today and sweat to put them on, they'll sure feel better to me,
even if they aren't.

OK, I admit, it got my attention (again :) ).

You don't mention why you have a preference for the MSD billet unit - I
presume it's because you want their triggering, coupled with their ignition
"computer."

You may want to review the past couple of months where I gave an account of
using the Pertronix Ignitor in my '74 914 2.0, w/stock FI. It works very
well, and can be hooked up to the MSD units (it's mentioned by name in my
MSD 6AL manual -- no, I haven't done the hookup - I'm going to use the 6AL
on my BMW).

Any crankfire ignition can obviate the need for a distributor. That's part
of what it does. A distributorless ignition setup like the Compu-Fire DIS IX 
(about $150 at most of the popular VW parts places) or the Electomotive 
system (used a lot of them on 911s over the years) is required. Once you do
that, though, you really don't need the MSD setup. See below on "how the
MSD works".

Which is why, of course, MSD sells their own version. About which, as it
turns out, I know nothing.

> >The question I have is will this actually work? and if so, has anyone got a 
> good idea as to where the crank trigger should go? Does it restrict the 
> airflow unduly if it's on the fan? 

I've mounted triggers as separate notched disks bolted to the front crank
pully on 911s and VW Type Is, and embedded them in the rim of the fly
wheel on 911, but have never installed such a system on a 914. The rules
under which I have competed just wouldn't allow use of such systems.

Things to watch for:

1) balance. don't upset the balance of the  thing you're mounting on. ALWAYS
   have it rebalanced as part of the process

2) getting flung off. It's best not to stick a sensor *on* a rotating part
   lest they part company at high velocity. 

3) access. You'll need to get to it, so take that into account when deciding
   where that it should go.

BTW, one final word here: let's answer the "what is MSD good for" question.
IF you have an engine with high compression and that is cam'ed for high
RPM operation and has the FI tweaked to match, complete with fairly cold
plugs to keep the heat down under load, odds are that you'll foul
your plugs at putting-around-town engine speeds and when you really
stand on it, nothing pleasant will happen.

MSD fixes that by sending multiple spark discharges (wanna guess where
the acronym came from?) per "firing signal" at low-medium RPM operation.
In other words, when the plug would *normally* get the signal to fire at
say 1200 RPM, it'll get one, then as soon as the CD unit recharges, another
and another and another. This helps keep the plugs clean. At anything over
about 3000 RPM, it shuts off since then in theory you have a decreased 
relaxation time between the originating signals and also you should be at
operating temp for the plugs so they won't foul.

What makes it work is two things: 1) it gets that "firing signal" from the
points or whatever passes for points on your car, so having the right
"programming" on the distributor or the crank fire computer or whatever
is VITAL. 2) distributor and coil. This setup won't work without it. They
(MSD) may have a distributorless version, or be able to recommend one that
is compatible. Believe them and use whatever they say to use.

Final note: I have a spare 6AL sitting around. It has zero hours on a factory
refurbishing job. Included are "programming pack" resistors for rev limting
in the 7-8k range, documentation, wiring harness, etc. $150 gets it.

Stan

Good luck.

This does get covered a lot. Hydraulic lifters are evil. Plan on new
pistons and cylinders, and for that matter clutch. Odds are good you 
need full valve jobs and maybe some head work. Replace the oil cooler as
it's full of blown engine bits.

For max reliability, use a high-grade counterweighted balanced crank and
BALANCE EVERYTHING. Make sure everything is *SUPER* clean going back
together. Consider using PolyDyne coating on the bearings.

Good luck.

Hey guys,
  You know things are allways more expensive when you are buying them than
when you are selling them. Remember, no one solicted the purchase of your
wheels, you asked to sell them (see distressed sales paragraph 27). In so 
far as what fair markup is, it is what the market will bear. Now as far as 
Robert Woods is concerned, I have found them to me very knowedgable and 
willing to share that knowledge with anyone that calls them to talk (at lest 
for me). And basicaly when you buy most items you are paying for the service 
along with the product. Hey, if ya don't like the price, buy elsewhere. 
There is absoultly no reason to bash a professional because you have a 
personal problem with them like this.

on the 911 are self adjusting. Where is the adjustment for the emergency

Subject: once again-73 911 2.4 S converted into 2.7 RS lightweight

Well guys those answers were definitly a bit poor, but maybe I need to get a
little 
bit more concrete.The car that I am thinking about to buy is in a good
condition and is supposed to cost 10% more than the original list price for
the 2.4S (in UK).

My question about the thinner metal of the body was not really answered, is
it just 
the fenders that are more thin or is it the whole car. I guess what PORSCHE
did in 73 is 
just to strip the car down to 975 kilos and that`s it, but they did not
built a total 
new body just for a series of about 1580 cars.
So what I was able to find out of the difference from the UK PORSCHE Club
are the follwing points:
 -Wider Rearwings ( If I would not know this by myself I should not buy a
PORSCHE)
 -Ducktail
 -Rear wheels
 -Bilstein shocks
FRONT-Double wishbones 
     -torsion bar springing 
     -anti-roll bar
 -Rear Wheels
 -Recaro Sport Seats 
 -Back windows do not pop out
 -only a "Sunshade" on the drivers side 
 -5th gear is different
ENGINE-Cylinders
      -Pistons
      -Fuel injection pump
      -Fueling cam
      
And that`s all Folks.But as I expect this large crowd of PORSCHE
enthusiastics to know
much more about the materia I hope to get some more answers than before.
Here they are again:

I am interested in buying a 73 911 2.4 S which was converted into a 2.7 RS
lightweight,
my questions are :

 - What are the differences between the two cars excpecially the engine?(I
really need   some very specified information with ALL the differences)

 - Is the converted car worth more than the original 2.4 s or maybe even less?
 - If all the parts are from the RS is there still a difference in driving?
 - Are there any differences in the body work ?
 - The car I am looking forward to buy is in condition b- to c+ (in a range
from (top)a    to f) is a price of 15.000 pounds to much?
 - Is it legitimate to buy a replica or would a real Porsche fan say that it
is a sin?
 - Is the metal of the basic Body of the car more thin than that of a normal 911?
Sorry for the lack of English but as I German I hope you don`t mind

Chuck;

   You did not say how tall you are but I have found (measuring 6' 1") that
if I move the seat forward one position from the rear then tilt the rear of
the seat back that this puts my head, with the helmet, in an area of the
sunroof panel with  more room. (Take a look above your head) The other
alternative, if you rules permit, is to use a glass roof such as the Saratoga
roof which is much thinner than the stock roof.

Keith,

This may indeed be only a hydraulic problem.  Have your clutch
thouroughly bled and have the travel of the slave cylinder piston
checked at the clutch bell housing.  The engage/disengage travel
should be not less than .5 inches nor greater than .75 inches.  Too
short a distance indicates a lack of disengagement and would result
in the type of problems you are having.

I've never heard of this happenning, but perhaps the tongs of the 
pressure plate have grown weak, allowing for travel w/o disengagement.
Anyone heard of this?

Doug,

I don't have a definitive answer, absent an available shock dyno near
to you.  To my experience, the failure or deterioration mode is generally
a loosening of the piston.  It could be that damping changes over time
too, but it's hard to tell.

When the piston loosens up, you can feel it by rocking the wheel, like
you are checking wheel bearing play.  In fact, a lot of people mistake
a loose strut for misadjusted wheel bearings.  If you pull off the wheel
and place one hand on the shock body, while you shake the rotor with
the other, you can then tell whether the looseness is in the strut vs.
wheel bearings.

The practical effect of this loosening is significant and unwelcome 
camber changes.  The strut has to be replaced -- there is not a separate
insert which can be swapped out.

No, there is no source for just the seals, which sucks.  The US Brembo

You may not need to replace all four pistons and seal sets.  I would
disassemble, clean up, and reassemble the calliper with the existing
seals if they look OK.  It may be that you have a single seal or piston
which is bad and can get away with replacing just that piston and its
seals.

Mark,

If you have a number of the lamps on, and they all started coming on
together, you may have an electrical gremlin.  Start by going over
(locating, cleaning, snugging) all your ground points.  Make sure the sensor
connectors are clean and snug.

Slow oil pressure build-up in a 944 is usually a problem with the oil
pressure relief valve.  Solution is to remove and clean it, replace the
o-ring at its end, and reinstall with a fresh seal ring.  If that doesn't
solve the problem, the factory recommends removing and resealing the oil pump.

And if that doesn't help, drop the oil pan and check the oil pick-up for
overall health and esp. its seal to the bottom of the block.  The pick-up in
944's has been known to suffer if the car is run a long time with bad engine
mounts.

Absolutely!  I thought my front wheel bearings were a little loose on the
passenger's side of the car until, when pulling my worn Boge inserts
out of the housing, I noticed some play in the piston/cylinder interface.
When I put my new Konis in, I made a point to check to see if the same
slight movement was present (grabbing the top and bottom of the tire) -
GONE! 

I had checked the adjustment of my bearings when I first found this
play in the front suspension.  When I found the adjustment to be OK,
I was a little concerned that the problem was something bigger$$.

What a pleasant surprise - new shocks and my "looseness" went
away!!

Don't worry about legality and registration stuff - consider

Here's an idea to make sure it's legit :

Give out "numbers" from 001 to 200. These can be posted
on PFILES before the drawing. Take the last three (or 4 if 
000) digits of the Dow Jones industrial average (001 to 1000)
from the Wall Street Journal (or some other nationally
published random number) and divide by 5. Round it UP if 
not an exact multiple of 5. The winner has this number.

This may not be exactly correct (it's late) but you get the idea.
People can even choose their numbers if you want to let them,
by "First come first served".

Enough!

The world's most densely populated country, Bangladesh, has 2130 people per
square mile. Fremont, CA has a population density of 2.250 people per
square mile. And lots of Porsches.

There are about 5.3 billion peole out there, roughly 101 per square mile if
we exclude Antarctica. There are 118 people per square mile in Tennessee,
home of that renowned pessimist, Wooden Al. And many Porsches.

If all the population of the earth lived as densely as the folks of
sprawling Fremont, California we would use up all of western Europe (gasp).
At the density of San Francisco (still plenty of room for Porsches) all 5.3
billion could fit in Texas and Oklahoma. IF we lived as densely as folks do
in Manhattan, everyone can live in Yugoslavia! Weissach, Nurburgring and Le
Mans would be deep country.

Subject: 944 Seats and Sunroofs

Hi, Charles...

First about the seats...you may have a bit of a problem about using early
style seats with the later style chassis.  You may have already noticed that
the later style seats have the seat belt receiver attached to the seat, not
to the chassis.  In the early style cars, the seat belt attaches to the
chassis. Were you to put early seats in a later car, you would have to come
up with some method of using seat belts.  Probably 5 point harness, etc.,
which may not be suitable for street driving...

I would not recommend pursuing it for that reason.

As far as replacement sunroofs go, yes, there are used sunroofs available (I
know of several that I could put my hands on in short order... I might even
have one in red... )  It is not too hard to remove the paneling, after which
you are left with about an extra inch of headroom, but, for most people,
this is a one-way road.

I have sold several sunroofs to trackies who want/need the extra room, and
have done just what you are proposing...

As far as the Saratoga roofs go, bottom line, I don't like them.  1) They
are glass, not plastic; 2) The glare from above is irritating and fatiguing;
3) They are not currently being manufactured and are difficult to locate.

Good luck, and let me know if I can be of any help to you...

Subject: Re:73 911 2.4 S converted into 2.7 RS lightweight

Michael Hecken had some specific questions on the 2.7 liter Carrera RS.

The history of the RS is thoroughly covered in a very well produced (but
hyper-expensive) book entitled "Carrera RS" by Drs. Thomas Gruber and Georg
Konradsheim. The English language version is ISBN 3-9500179-1-7. This book
gives all the details, and has a listing at the end of EVERY genuine RS, with
its color, engine number, and options. 

The English language edition was translated by a friend of mine who works at
Porsche. If you are German, though, you will probably want to get it in the
original language. I don't have the German ISBN number handy but you could
contact T.A.G. Verlag GmbH, Cottagegasse 94, A-1190 Wien.

On p. 78 it says that the RS used 0.8 mm sheet metal instead of 0.88 mm sheet
for the exterior roof and door skins, front lid skin, trunk floor, door
sills, rear seat panel, upper and lower dashboard sections, front fenders and
rear side panels (fenders). 

It says the thinner metal was only necessary until the 1000 units required
for Group 3 homologation were built, after which normal production sheet metal
 was used throughout. As you might guess, there was no definite chassis
number at which the change occurred. "The last supplies of special materials
were then used up, and series-production parts used instead. The vehicles
from this transitional phase could sometimes be a strange mixture of thin and
normal sheet metal. But even before, holdups in parts deliveries sometimes
made it necessary to use series parts -- especially rear fenders -- in a few
cars. For organizational reasons, spare parts of thin sheet metal could not
be reordered."

Sheet aluminum was used only for the engine lid. There were 2 variations:
without rear spoiler, the entire rear lid was aluminum. WIth rear spoiler,
the engine lid frame was aluminum, carrying the fiberglass skin and spoiler.
"Once the homologation series was complete, the aluminum frame was replaced
by a steel one."

Also in your listing (which I haven't gone through all that carefully) I
noticed that you say front double wishbones. No, the street 911 did not have
double wishbones. Just struts, torsion bars, and a lower A-shaped arm for
location. Recently, they got away from the torsion bars and installed true
struts ("Federbeine" for you), with coil springs over the shocks, but still
use a lower A-arm.

For me, as a former Bosch (and later Porsche) engineer, the key element of
the RS is the injection pump. A true RS has a Bosch assembly number reading 0
408 126 019. Major difference is the space cam.

For those who are interested, here are the other applications:

for a color sanded/buffed finish.  Even the steadiest hand at the spray
gun cannot produce such a beautiful, perfectly flat finish.  One caveat:
 here's another place where metallics are a pain in the butt.  (i.e.
weird patterns surfacing once you sand off the top layer of paint,
etc...)  Don't get me wrong, though, the better you are at spraying, the
less paint you'll have to sand back off again.
    Can anyone help this guy?  I'd be interested in responses from
anyone who has done this, as well.

    One last thing... I realized that I forgot one of the most important
steps in my summary of my "cheap driveway paint job..."
    Please, please, whatever you do, right after finishing the bodywork
and before using athe tack rag (before spraying anything - paint or
primer) PLEASE wipe down the surface with reducer or lacquer thinner. 
Don't skimp, and don't be alarmed if it dissolves your primer a little. 
A clean surface is absolutely essential for proper paint adhesion.  In
fact, lacquer thinner is handy stuff to clean things at almost any stage
of paint prep. How could I forget something so basic... sheesh...  Um,
Bart, what do you have for me (cringing...)
    I apologize profusely if anyone ran out and followed my instructions
and got a really crappy paint job....  I really should start putting
disclaimers at the end of my posts...

later,

Nate

My understanding is that there is no point to using a 16V head with

more "stuff" into the combustion chamber.

So rather than add all of the moving parts for the extra valves,
just up the boost a tad.

Subject: Laser jammers

	A couple months ago Car & Driver did a test of laser detectors
and the various ways to overcome them. I can't remember the exact specifics
or when it came out But I do remember the following:
1.Laser detectors are not very useful since by the time they pick the
stuff up you are dead.
2.The diffuser licence plate covers do give you more time before the gun
will lock on thereby giving you a chance if you have a laser detector and
the guy actually hits your plate.
3.The best thing to use is very powerful halogen lamps on the front and
rear (if your dedicatet) which throw out enougH IR energy to confuse the
gun once again so your detector has a chance. There is a company which
sells lenses for the lights so that only the IR and not the visible
wavelengths pass so you don't have 150Watt halogen lamps "on" throughout
the day since if you also use them on the rear your are breaking the law,etc.
5.I have not personally tried any of this since where I live the lasers
aren't in use.
6.I haven't investigated this further but there are sources of IR energy
which are much more efficient than off-road halogen lamps and should prove
more effective if one is dedicated and $$$$.
7.The radar jammers are illegal if you don't have an FCC licence and are
probably still ellegal if you use them against police radar. I once got 
some plans to build one but the money involved in buying the klystrom was
prohibitive.
8.There is presently no law against sources of IR transmission and therefore
these people are open for countermeasures such as described above.
9.My memory is a little fuzzy about the details of the above post so don't 
flame me over the details. Get the C&D article to begin your quest for
countermeasures.

Incidentally got a ticket last week from good old fashioned radar, detector
broken, anybody have any experience at beating these things in court?

Good Luck and happy research. Jonathan

If you mean the rear sunroof lifters, disassemble the lifter mechanism and

If you mean the front sunroof hinges, they break often.  Replace them with

Subject: Re: Car Waxing with Bare Hand

Mike,
Larry's suggestion of using your bare hand was a good one.

After doing my roof with my finger tips (and wearing out my knuckle 
joints) I found that I should use the palm of the hand instead of the 
fingers.  It allows you to use the shoulder and elbow to move the hand 
instead of using the wrist when you just use the finger tips.

I ran this by Larry and that is what he does too.  He also remarked that 
using your finger tips causes finger tip lines - where using your palm 
gives a much more consistent coverage.

For those of you who still haven't tried this - DO!.  You'll have a lot 
more control than using a rag or powered buffer; you'll feel any grit 
that may be between your hand and the paint surface so you can STOP and 
not scratch it; it doesn't take that long - you get faster at it; and it 
gives you the feeling that you are massaging your P-car - ooohh!!!

By the way - using pure Carnuba doesn't seem to cause your skin to get 
raw or dishpanish (?).

          Help!

               While cruising at super-highway speed to a "Free
          Service Clinic" at a nearby P-Car dealer my '84 911 simply
          started dropping revs and power.  Finally, it died at the
          side of the Interstate (very embarrassing to have to wave at
          those cars I had passed earlier as I walked to the exit!)

               Seemed like an electrical problem so I replaced the
          battery of unknown vintage (probably '89) and everything
          seems fine.  This happened a couple of months ago after
          parking with the power antenna stuck halfway up.  Next time
          tried to start no juice, dead as a doornail.  Charged the
          battery and snipped leads to "formerly" power antenna.  No
          problems until today.

               When home, checked old battery with meter--11.85 v (3
          hours later 12.39).  New battery 12.51 (installed in car).
          Voltage stays at 12.24 when at idle, 2k, 3k, and 4k.  I am
          familiar with 6v systems from my 356 days, but don't feel
          confident testing around Motronic, etc.

               What tests can I perform to isolate any remaining
          problem--alternator, voltage regulator, etc.?  I have a
          Fluke multi-meter, but only enough knowledge of electrons to
          be dangerous.

               If this is addressed in the FAQ's I apologize, but if
          not, I seek the inestimible wisdom of my Phellow Philers.

Gary,

I think you are wrong. The Japanese cars commonly use 16v and Turbochargers
to achieve high horsepower engines. The Nisson 300ZX Twin Turbo, Mitsubishi
Eclipse GS Turbo and 3000 GT, and the Toyota Supra Turbo are all 4V engines
with turbochargers. They all get around 300Hp from 3 litres engines. I'm sure
Porsche could if they wanted too, but I think that they don't want too. I
agree with some earlier postings who mentioned that Porsche probably didn't
want to embarrass the flagship 911 by producing a "lesser" car with more
performance. 

I think that's why the 944 Turbo was discontinued. It easily surpassed the
performance of the 911 for the same amount of money. However, the 944 Turbo
(88 Turbo S and 89 Turbo) is now selling for about 16-20K and the 911 (88-89)
is selling for 25K, so what do I know?

This subject reminds me of an experience perhaps 35 years ago when

home after a date, there was smoke from under the dashboard, the
lights went dim and the car stopped.  I got the battery lead off,
but the wiring was fried. A ignition coil (one of three) had rotated
and the hot lead grounded against the nearby sheet metal.

It took four long nights to totally rewire the car from the dashboard
forward and much longer than that to live down the reputation for
having her feet get entangled in the wiring  :-)

I've still got the Berkeley, but it's been a while since it ran.  It

Hi,

relative to the comment about using the O2 tester in the tail pipe, it's
important to point out that this will give valid results in the tail pipe if
there is no catalytic convertor ahead of the sensor.  If the engine has a
catalytic convertor, the O2 sensor should be installed ahead of the catalytic
convertor in the exhaust stream.

Just an observation.

Subject: 914 short shifter/driver's side door pockets/carpet kits


I read quite a bit about 911 short shifters in the 1994 archives.  The 
consensous
seemed to be that the factory kit was best, and that reports of "missed shifts"
were more than likely caused by track usage more than the short shifters
themselves.  The major trade off was one of increased lever pressure.

So, what about for 914's?  As I'm slowly mastering stirring the 914 and
driving reasonably quickly, I notice two things.  When going from 2nd to
1st and cornering fairly hard, my knee gets in the way of the shifter (no
harness to hold me down so I prop my leg against the center console) and 
when going from 3rd to 4th, my arm is at nearly full extension (aka the 
bus driver effect).

So, will a short shift kit help either of these?  I understand it will
not alleviate the vagueness or make the shifting more crisp.  I also have
a problem with my knee getting in the way of my knuckles on the steering wheel,
but that's fairly easy to fix with a smaller wheel.

What about the general "feel" of a short shift on a side shifter 914?
Liked it? didn't like it?  am I going to be posting a "914 short
shifter for sale, hardly used" message in a month if I buy one?

Is there a factory kit available for the 914?  Or a favorite after
market kit?

As for door pockets:

My driver's side door pocket is pretty nasty.  It's been recovered
once in the past, and it's pretty warped.  I just pulled the thing
off entirely for now.

Ideally I'd like a factory style replacement for a semi-reasonable
price ($200ish at the most).  The used pockets I saw at the
automotion swap meet didn't impress me, so whatever replacement
I choose will probably have to be new or refurbished.

However, I don't really like the driver's side pocket (too large,
makes me feel claustrophobic).  So, if there is no reasonable
factory style replacement, I wouldn't mind going with something
else.

First choice would be an arm rest like the passenger side, except
it would have to be for the driver's door.  I don't suppose the passenger
side arm rest is out of some VW and there is a driver's side available?

Other than that, I have no ideas.  The only thing to keep in mind is
that I do have 6 1/2" speakers in the door panels.  Any other
pocket alternatives?  Hell, even a pull handle that looked semi
decent would be ok.

Carpet kits:

Anyone dealt with "Original Fit"?  They advertise in Pano.  Their
914 carpet kit is significantly cheaper than Automotion/Performance
Products ($125 vs $250ish).  Just wondering if there is a major
difference among domestic knock off carpet kits.

The driver's door pocket & the carpet are the only really ratty interior 
bits I want to take care of.

Thanks much.

I've never quite understood this.  If you read Puhn's book on brakes, he
shows how a proportioning valve with a cut-over pressure effects an
approximation to an ideal front/rear curve with two straight lines.  A
balance-bar system gives you just one line, no?  So how come it's better
than a proportioning valve with cut-over?

Subject: 1987 944S Lack of power

I  posted a recent request for help on the same subject and received some 
very good responses from the list, for which I would like to thank you.  The 
marjority of the responses attributed the "lack of power to a slipping 
clutch", which even my mechanic thought was the cause given the observed 
symptoms.  I decided however to take the car to another Porsche mechanic for 
a second opinion before I embarked on the major and expensive work of 
replacing the clutch.  I will reiterate the symptoms and also the new 
diagnosis by the second mechanic.
(1) Car seems to run out of steam at approx 3750-4000 rpm.
(2) Especially noticeable in 1st and 2nd gears.
(3) At higher rpm's in the lower gears there is no corresponding forward 
motion (thus the slipping clutch diagnosis).

The latest checks confirm the following systems to be OK:
ignition, camshaft and cam timing, vacuum leaks, exhaust system and clutch.

The mechanic found the following exceptions:
The CO fluctuates (cycles) through the entire range, from 0.2 to 1.3.  He 
says it should be within a narrower range.  The hydrocarbons are fairly 
steady at 350-430 ppm.

The burn times on cylinders 3 and 4 are longer than the rest, 2.2 
milliseconds as compared to 1 and 2 which are at 1.7 to 1.8 milliseconds. 
(checked by spark plug voltage fluctuation)

He believes that the DME is at fault because everything else checks out.

I am hoping that the engine management gurus on the list can pinpoint the 
specific area of the DME that is acting up, or suggest further tests to 
determine where the problem might be. If the DME is in fact at fault can an 
aftermarket chip be substituted to confirm the diagnosis before the whole 
DME is replaced?  I am a firm believer in keeping everything stock but may 
be forced to use an aftermarket chip until a suitable donor DME becomes 
available.
Thanks for the bandwidth.

The axle bolts are not Torx bolts.  They are standard metric 12 point,
triple-square bolts.  I believe the size is 6 or 8 mm.  

May I suggest that you use your vise grips to remove one of the bolts and
take it to your local auto parts store and use it to determine which of the
sockets is the right size.

Subject: RE: 951 Question


Doug,

	I'll give you a snap shot of the mechanical differences.
First, the Turbo S is based on the Turbo engine M44/51 (217hp). The 
Turbo S (M44/52) is equipped with a modified turbo, the vanes were redesigned, 
but the turbo is not "bigger". The DME control unit has different 
look-up tables for fuel and ignition maps. The knock and charge pressure 
were also modified. The Turbo S will give higher full boost over the 
entire rev range, where as the turbo's boost is slightly lower and 
reduces even more above 3,500 rpm. Turbo S exhaust valves were 
increased in diameter by 1/100th mm in the area of the valve guide for 
better running behavior at full load. Water hose/pipe and mounts were 
changed including turbo charger water pump due to reinforcements of 
the front end.
	Other than engine: Clutch 240 WTD changes in springs and 
friction liner is cemented and riveted. Front and rear shocks are 
adjustable and stiffer. The brakes are of 928-S4 type, 
larger stabilizer and torsion bars. Transmission is limited slip w/oil 
cooling and 1st and 2nd gears are hardness blasted for increased 
strength. "S" coil springs are harder and tampered for wheel 
clearance. Larger wheels 225/50 ZR16 frt, 245/45 ZR16 rear, Club Sport 
wheel rims. Also harder rubber suspension bushings.
 

Hope that's what you were looking for.

Going out on a limb, I'd bet race cars generally don't use 
proportioning valve systems because they are inherently difficult to
manage from the driver's seat.  If there is an ideal ratio where near 
simultaneous front/rear lock-up occurs, and this is the objective, a 
driver would want to keep it once it has been found with his adjustable 
balancer.  A proportioning valve, which he has no control over, ends up
continually adjusting bias making it closer to a box of chocolates.  
This is because the bias becomes dependant upon what the proportioning 
valve does when it sees different breaking pressures (above the 
cut-over) from corner to corner. 

Jerry, who owns a 951, just did the popular proportioning valve swap
and we went over what they do.  I'm reposting the math below: 


I think numbers say it best, but basicly with either the 5/33 
or the 5/18 you have a device that maintains your existing brake
bias only to a certain point.  So, at intersections, in street
driving etc. you get a well balanced braking situation.  On the 
track, or during emergency stops however, things begin to change.
If the pressure in your brake system reaches the designated
points 18 or 33 barr as the case may be, for what some, including
myself think are litigeous reasons, Porsche doesn't want any 
consequential rear lock-up and what usually follows.  So, brake
pressure starts biasing foward as a result of these regulators.

The numbers:
	-5 is a lame way of describing the number .46 (as per the 
	 factory manual).  I guess it could be seen as a reciprocal
	 in their eyes, whatever.
	-18 or 33 are numbers describing the magnitude of pressure
	 (in barr) where the regulator begins to function.
	 
	I don't know what the exact bias on our '44s is but lets say
	for example we have 70 percent front and 30 percent rear.
	At a normal slow down which never sees a barr pressure above
	18 or 33 everything is peaches and stays 70/30.  But say your
	on a track and braking for a turn where you send 50 barr to
	your brake master cylinder before turn-in, hopefully:)......

	using the 5/18:
	Barr to the front is  50(.7)=35
	Barr to the rear is 18(.3) + *32(.3)(.46)=5.4 + 4.416=9.816
	bias ratio = 35/9.816 or 78%/22%
	
	using the 5/33:
	Barr to the front is 50(.7)=35
	Barr to the rear is 33(.3) + *17(.3)(.46)=9.9 + 2.346=12.246
	bias ratio = 35/12.246 or 74%/26%
	
	* 32=50-18			* 17=50-33


You can see from these equations how a proportioning system operates
to affect bias and how the 5/33 is a little better than the 5/18.  
Using different barr pressures in the equations will illustrate how
front bias goes up with brake pressure when we brake hard enough to
activate these valves. I don't know what barr we reach at the track, 
but I'd be curious to find out.

Hope this helps,
PS Jerry, what difference did the 5/33 make at Pocono?

Well, measured in terms of "will it get me what I've always wanted"
the answer is "maybe". If measured in pure dollars and sense, the
answer is *CLEARLY* "no".

To do this right involves using steel parts, a moderate amount of cutting
welding and fitting, then a complete ground up repaint. In Houston, there
are about three shops I'd trust this to, none can just "do it" -- it'll
take about 3-5 months, and I'd expect the end result to cost at least
$12-15k if a halfway decent job were done. Plus another $2-3k for the
wheels and tires to fill out those wider flares that you'll add as part
of the job, assuming that you really go for the 930S look.

There is no measureable increase in resale value; to get anything more than
what you'd get for a vanilla '87 911, the car would have to be essentially
*PERFECT*, low miles, and you'd have to find someone that really wanted what
you have.

If you're interested, shoot me a note and I'll pass the contact info for the
shops along. Note that with some looking you can actually find a 930S for
something in the mid-40s, and that if you take the value of your car plus
the $15-20K you'd be into it with a conversion, you *MIGHT* want to re-think
whether or not you might not want to own the real thing.

It seems ridiculous to buy 16 rebuild kits (at a horrendous expense) to just
get dust shields but this is apparently what must be done. I could get no
help from Brembo. They told me that Porsche owns the rights to the calipers
involved and therefore they couldn't sell anything to me. They can only sell
the complete kits to a Porsche dealer. End of story.
Seems like Porsche does this once in a while. Pistons and cylinders come to
mind. 
If you could be any help in this situation I am sure many of us would be very
gratefull.
Interestingly enough the dust covers have part numbers on them so it seems to
me that they should be cross referenced with other Brembo calipers. 
I have pursued this with a number of people and have gotten nowhere.

While this sounds suspicious, the use of anodes, or dc voltages to
minimize corosion in industry is tried and true. All you have to do
is induce a small voltage that is high enough to overcome the
galvanic reaction that forms rust. While this sounds easy, there
are corosion engineers who make a living out of it, so it also

Subject: Re: Gastester(schon wieder!)

I whiled away 1.5 afternoons this weekend doing the O2-sensor-as-mixture-
tester trick.  Paid $45 for generic three-wire O2 sensor, $25 for cheapest
Radio Shack DVM.  Wired so I could power the heater leads from the cigarette
lighter, and see the voltage display as I drove.

As I had read posts about the idea, I had pictured sticking the sensor into
the tailpipe (eg on a copper pipe to protect the wiring) but with sensor in
hand I realized this won't work:  pigtail end of sensor must be in outside
air for it to work.  I tapped the sensor into a pipe that is a press fit
into my tailpipe.  

Very educational to watch the display.  "Sweet spot" setting of mixture
(on 77 CIS engine) is very narrow and has nothing to do with best (ie
stoichiometric) setting at idle.  I can't imagine pulling the plugs often
enough to get it right without a tester that can go on the road.  Does this
match the experience of others -- that CIS system is rich at idle in order
to be neither rich nor lean at speed?  Or do I need to install clean plugs
and try again?

Subject: 914 wheels/suspension

Yo:

Slowly, but surely I am preparing my '76 for acceptance of the freshly
rebuilt engine, new clutch, and rebuilt transaxle.  Although it is still
about a month away yet, I wanted to get the opinion of the list on options
for front shocks and/or struts replacement.   It's also time to start
thinking about wheels.

First, the car came with bilsteins on the rear which seem to be in pretty
good shape(the PO raced the car).  The front, however, is a different story.
The driver side currently sits about 1" lower than the passenger side and
I found that the shock on that side is the culprit.  The front is mounted
with green struts and shocks(the original boge, I assume).  Apparently, the
PO must of replaced the front shocks with parts from the back of the 
garage before getting rid of the car.  

When is it necessary to replace the struts *and* the shocks, or can I get 
away with just new shocks?  Recommendations on possible replacements?  If
I get bilsteins for the front, will they fit in the boge struts?

Second, I am in the market for some nice looking aftermarket alloys.  What
are your opinions on what looks nice?  I am also curious as to how much 
tire I can stuff under the fenders with 5.5" rims.  What about the possibility
of 6" rims?

Thanks in advance. (I'd also ask about engine break-in procedures but don't
want to get carried away!)

One who's looking forward to *finally* driving my first porsche this 
summer...

Subject: Re: painting your Porsche

This is in response to the question about rubbing out paint and is from 
experience gained while managing a Chevy garage detailing department and  
from painting my own cars.  This works well on non-metalic paints.  Metalic 
paints are a pain in the ass and is best to have 2 or 3 coats of clear over 
the metalic so you are not
sanding into metalic layer.  You had better not get drips with metalic, 
because they are a
bitch to remove, not impossible, but a bitch.

For rubbing out paint have the following materials:
3M wet or dry sandpaper 300, 400, 600 grits.
Rubbing compound
water
squeeze bottle (kechup) 
lambs wool buffing wheel
grinder or drill motor
clean rags (old t-shirts or diapers are best)
water proof sanding block  (3M makes a good one)
HAND RUBBING:  Use the compound directly out of the tin on a wet rag.  Rub in a
circular motion until the paste dries out.  Continue rubbing until a shine 
appears.  Don't
rub too long or too hard when the paste is dry, because this is when you 
tend to rub
through. If it is a new paint job and there is enough paint, you will hardly 
ever rub
through.  Older, oxidized paint jobs are much thinner and you can rub 
through them
easily.  If you do, that means you probably need a new paint job anyway.

MACHINE RUBBING:  Mix a slurry of 1/2 tsp. rubbing compound per 2 to 4 cups of
water.  The more experience you have at buffing the less water you can use.  
Be sure the
paint job is really clean and has no grit that will put scratches into it.  
Apply some of the
slurry to the paint and squirt some on the buffing wheel.  Start the wheel 
going and cut
the power.  While the wheel is still spinning (no power) touch it to the 
rubbing compound
puddle on the painted surface.  The wheel will start cutting the paint and 
form a paste. 
You can keep the power on, but it will spray all over the place until the 
paste is formed. 
When the paste forms, turn the power on and continue buffing until the paste 
starts to dry
out.  Keep it wet with the squeeze bottle.  You will see the shine appear.  
After repeating
this procedure to your satisafaction, wash the area with clean water, and 
wax it well.    If
you are really anal retentive about your paint job, there is a product made 
by 3M called
Mirror Glaze that comes in a squeeze bottle and is pink in color.  This can 
be applied
after the rubbing compound and before the wax to remove fine swirl marks 
from the
rubbing compound.  Use the wheel just like you did with the rubbing 
compound, but use
a different wheel or thoroughly clean the rubbing compound wheel.

Orange peel has to be sanded first with either 400, or 600 wet or dry paper 
depending
how bad the orange peel is.  Always finish with the 600 paper.  Holding the 
paper in a
3M rubber sanding block, sand lightly using plenty of clean water until the 
orange peel is
gone.  For compound curves, the heel of your hand is best.  Avoid using 
fingertips.   Then
proceed with the rubbing compound.

Drips can be sanded out with a block and 220 or 300 paper.  Keep the block 
parallel to
the paint surface.  When the drip is almost gone, start switching to finer 
grits.  By the
time the drip is gone, you should be using 600 grit paper.  Follow with the 
rubbing
compound.

I hope this helps.  While I don't claim to be an expert,  I do have a hand 
rubbed model A
Ford that gets plenty of compliments at meets.  I know what to do and would 
be happy to
help anyone if there are more questions.

Subject: What's it all about, Bartie...? (fwd)

Our gratitude to Robin Hanson, for the perfect opening...

> What is this about? I have been off-line for some months, Thanx
> robin

Thanks Robin,, for this opportunity!  Below, I shall reveal all (read this to
the tune of "Alfie", "What's it all about, Bartie...?"):

You 141 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-members (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute:  The bank folks would
rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

My question is: what finish? My '84 has flat disk aluminum wheels, with no
apparent finish. Is what's coming off yours a coat of something clear?
Maybe put on by a previous owner? If so, the easiest/best/most original

stick with the aluminum. That expanse of chrome would be pretty much

Subject:  '86 944; Need some advise

I've been lurking on the list for awhile and all I can think to
say is WOW - - the generosity of knowledge sharing is overwhelming.

As the subject line reflects I need some advise on my 1986 944.
The windshield washer reservoir has developed a leak (I think it is
on a seam near the bottom).  I'm not a mechanical person - though
I try hard to be at times.  Is there a way to fix the crack without
removing the old reservoir and inserting a new one?  I was thinking 
that maybe a product like "Stop Leak" would work (please stop
laughing) but don't want to make more problems for myself by using
something that will create other problems.  The reason I don't want
to remove the old one is that it "looks" real complicated to do.
Does anyone have a suggestion or recomendation?

Thanks,

Subject: 924 purchase help

   Since I have just started to dismantle my 914 for what will be a long
restoration period, I find myself without a Porsche to "drive".  I have
found a 924 that I would consider for a (summer) daily driver. I could
really use some tips on what to look for (common problems, optional 
equiptment, etc.).
   I have only looked at the car from the outside, and would be armed with
some information before I drive it.  It is a 1980 non-turbo, but is has 15"
mag wheels that I have seen on turbos in photos.  It does not have rear
disc brakes, and I forgot to look for sway bars.  The body is in very good
shape as is what I could see of the undercarriage.  The odometer, as far
as I could see, reads 17,000 so I have to assume that's 117,000.
   If anyone can tell me what to look for and especially a price range 
depending on condition, it would be a great help before I actually drive
this car.

Subject:       Re: Interested in 928 (s)

Leonard,

I went through this same dilemma just a few weeks a go.  I looked at a 
porsche 928s, 1985 which was a really fast and nice car.  I then went 
asking on this list for advice and it was suggested that I try out 
some 928's and 911's.  Both are excellent race cars and both have 
there advantages and disadvantages.  I ended up buying a 911 that was 
both older and had more miles on it.  My reasons were:

The 911 shape is so distinctive and beautiful to me that I wasn't 
going to give that up for anything.  The 928 is nice but other cars 
such as the Nissan 300ZX turbo are just as good in many respects and 
the shape is just not like a 911 -timeless and unique.

It seems that parts are more readily available for the 911, 
especially used 911 parts.

The 911 is more of a sports car than a 928 in the sense that it is 
lighter and has less comfort creatures.

I really wanted the Targa or convertible and ended up with a Targa.  
This was also a very important criteria for me.

I think I got a good deal on my 911 and I think that it will hold it's 
value or even go up.  928's in my area don't seem to hold their 
value, not because they are not good cars, but because people around 
here just don't recognize them.  

The drug dealers in Baltimore prefer luxury sedans or luxury sports 
cars with all the amenities. As such the thieves who want to mimic 
the 'dealers' tend not to bother with 911's.  A 928 would be a better 
target for them.  I'd worry about my 911 in NY, but in Baltimore, I 
feel its safer -much safer than a Mazda 323.

 
Go drive a few cars.  I did and it was worth it.

1.What is involved in retrofitting my A/C with the R134a substance.
Is it expensive to do this?

2.  My leather dash and some other parts of the interior are scuffed 
in many places, although the dash is the worst.  Luckily it's right 
behind the steering wheel, so it is not really visible.  The color is 
a medium/dark blue.  Are there any kits available to 'repaint' or 
restore small patches of leather.  I know that there are dash kits 
available for black leather/vinyl ($$$) in automation but even those 
won't match the blue of the rest of the interior.

So far, so good. The trick is this: can you do this in a CAR, which affords
a very poor true ground path? If so, why are there no studies saying so?
If not, can something be done to improve the process?

I'm saying this is an open question, not a clear case of something being
snake oil. If there's more info out there, I'd like to see it. Otherwise,
my natural skepticism rises to the surface...

BTW, most natural gas pipelines employ something similar, though the
intent is differenc (maintain potential difference low enough not to 
blow it up, basicly). So do the larger old-style copper telephone plants.
You can see the signs that say "cathodic protection point" if you look close,
particularly close to rail road crossings. Of course, the first time she 
noticed this, my wife read these as "Catholic protection point" and proceeded 
to get real excited about things... 8{)

Subject: '80 924 purchasing advice given

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Nice to see more interest in 924s lately on the list, and "dabredum"
(forgot his real name) askes about what to look for on an '80 924.  There is a
bit of difference in '80 and '80.5 924s.  The later model has a better FI system
and, according to Jim Pasha who has done dyno work on them, 14 more real HP at
the rear wheels.  Look and see if it has an early or late build date (shown on
driver's door jamb).  A better way to tell, again according to Jim Pasha, is the
presence of steel tubes to the injectors, instead of the earlier more flexible
ones.  Maybe you should post a note for him to go into more detail for you.  An
early '80 would be a fine car, but like I said will have less power.
	Things to look for?  Rust wasn't really a problem on 924s, the only place
on my '77 is in the battery box located above the passenger's footwell.  It
loves to pee on people's legs on rainy days.  Brakes, especially on mine, aren't
that great.  Otherwise they (at least mine) don't seem to have many problems.
Check the FAQ also, it has a lot of info.  Prices?  Around here (Charlotte, NC)
924s go anywhere from $2000 for ratty ones up to $4000 for nice, later models.
I paid $3700 for my '77 five years ago, but its one of the nicest, well kept
924s I came across, and IMHO its better to "overpay" for a nice car than to
spend the same or more fixing up an abused one.  
	924s are really under-appreciated, mine is extremely reliable and I've
had no problems in the past two years.  I have a 914 too, and the 924 makes an
excellent companion.  Hope this helps :^)

The nice folks at I.C.E. (see their ads in most of the Usual Places)
have update kits for most P-cars. You gotta replace just about everything.
Different operating pressure, different thermal rate of expansion, and
best of all, it leaks through conventional old-style rubber A/C hose!

Plan on at least a kilobuck in parts unless you have a car from the
very last few years where they actually started using R134A compatible
hoses...

Probably, but you'll be a lot happier if you have someone that knows what

You asked, thusly,

And since you did ask...
I got mine in Aug 1991 with 77k on it and in excellent shape. Buying it was 
sheer, blind luck.  I knew next to nothing about the car. I saw it, drove it 
once and bought it.  It has turned out to be as excellent a car as I could
have wanted. I now have 122K on it and still smile whenever I drive it! 

As with any "commitment" there are trials. I have replaced the battery (normal),
the water pump (it's second according to the original owner), the clutch, the
radiator and hoses. The radiator went one day after getting it back after
having the oil cooler replaced. Yes, replaced. Usually it's the o-rings that
go and allow water and oil to mix. Not mine. No, mine had to develop a pin-sized
hole that allowed the oil to blow out into the water and go through two quarts
in fifty miles. No harm to the bearings because no water got into the oil. Mucho 
harm to my wallet though.  The original owner said he had had the motor mounts
replaced eary on along with the water pump.

The car is my daily driver, and I confess there are times I wish it didn't have to be.
But, even though it was blessed with minimum power accessories (just pwr windows,
mirrors, and A/C) and it's a "puny" 8 valver I can't wait to get back in it every
time I drive some other brand.  Is it the best car in the world, no, but it's very
pleasing to me.

Subject: Re: It's electricity, but is it snake oil?

I picked this up late, but the problem with differential metal corrosion is
the local potential. The voltage is defined locally, say between the
exposed steel and the surrounding zinc, resulting in zinc plating onto the
exposed steel through the water on the surface. 
Applying a voltage to a steel structure (car) relative to ground, where the
process is actually oxidation sounds like bad medicine. If you immerse the
car into a plating bath, and use a yugo as an electrode...

Note that even the zinc plating trick only works on small "wounds" where
the zinc can get at the steel. I've seen badly worn porsche front ends
where the zinc couldn't save the underlyng steel. This, even though the
holes were only ~1/2".

The fronts have inserts which can be replaced by themselves unless the

back. RD Enterprises has the lowest prices in the known universe. They

You can run up to 8" rims. But you can't run wider than 205 series tires.
In my opinion, the absolute best setup is 15x7s, with 205/50s. Lots of
places have rims that fit, but one of the sharpest setups is the "true"
Minilites which are now available again through Brett Johnson's TPR
outfit. I have no idea how much, but I'd bet "a lot". You can get
ATS or similar for about $180 a wheel in that size several places.

> Thanks in advance. (I'd also ask about engine break-in procedures but don't
> want to get carried away!)

Make *SURE* that everything is installed correctly. Check and double check.
Fill with SAE-40 oil, pre-fill the oil filter, disconnect the coil wire,
crank for about a minute after the oil pressure light has gone out. Re-connect 
coil and start it up (you may have to screw around with lots of things at
this point 8{) ), bring it up to about 2500 RPM and let it run there for about 
half an hour. Bring idle down to about 800 RPM, adjust timing. Stop engine.
Let sit overnight. Change oil and filter (still SAE 40). Adjust valves. Check 
torque on the exposed fasteners (including head studs). Drive car for
about 30 miles, running through a wide range of RPM (accelerate from say 20 
to say 70, back all the way off the throttle, repeat, etc). DRIVE NORMALLY
otherwise. Return to home base, change oil and filter. Drive normal for 300 
miles (another 270), again being sure to run through a wide range of RPM
(please stay under 5000). Let sit overnight, change oil and filter, adjust
valves and check fastener torque. Next oil change/valve adjust is 3000
miles, then oil every 3000 and valves every 6000 after that.

And stick with SAE-40 oil. I like Valvoline, even though I no longer
have a sponsorship deal with them... *AND* do *NOT* use Fram or AC or K-Mart
or any oil filter other than the OEM filters. Mann. Mahle. Nothing else.
You can get these  at good prices from Zims, etc.

 Oh great masters of the 914 (and I know there are quite a few here), please 
 give me advice....
 
 Details:
 Rebuilding 1975 2.0 L motor
 Installing into 1974 (used to be 1.8 L)
 
 Current Status: Engine is out, heads off, cylinders in trash, will take to FAT 
 performance for machining, hopefully this week.
 
 Questions:  What sort of machine work is suggested for this motor? Stuff I had 
 planned on was--
 
 -Machine cylinder deck on case  ($35)
 -Drill and tap oil galleys ($50)
 -crackcheck crank ($12)
 -polish crank ($20)
 -Balance crank ($20)
 -Rebuild rods ($40)
 -Balance Rods ($20)
 -Surface flywheel ($25)
 -Balance Flywheel ($15)
 -Surface Heads ($35)
 -Repair spark plug hole- one ($15)
 -Balance pistons ($25)
 -Install valve guides ($32)
 -Competition valve grind ($70)
 
 Is this sufficient / not excessive?  In the VW type I motors I pretty much 
 Align Bored every motor, but I heard this isn't usually needed in the Type IV. 
 Also, I assume I'll have to wait to see if I need a crank regrind....
 
 After looking at the engine and the previous records, I think this is the first 
 rebuild -- can I reuse the sodium-filled exhaust valves like some of the books 
 say? (If so I can save $300!)
 
 Almost done -- Stan mentioned it is good to replace the oil cooler.... Is there 
 a way to inspect the ones I have (from various cars) to find ones clean of 
 engine metal? Perhaps have them cleaned? 
 I was told that counterweighted cranks are not needed, but Stan just suggested 
 to use one -- what am I trading off with $$$ if I get a counter weighted crank?
 Finally, Stan... what is this bearing coating you mentioned a few digests ago?
 
 Many thanks to all...
 
 (BTW, engine will use FAT 440HP cam (mild FI capable cam), solid lifters and 
 euro 2.0 L pistons.)

I took the plunge this weekend and bought my seventh 911
(actually one was a 912).  The 73.5 911T is just like the old
911's I remember and it really is a blast to drive.  But I digress...

The 77 seats that the prior owner installed really suck.
There's no thigh support at all, the edge of the seat sits very
low (barely rises at all), and the slippery leather keeps
sliding me forward.

I'd like to replace these.  I'm looking for pointers on where to
pick up a pair of black high-back seats, new or used, cloth,
velour, leather, vinyl, whatever.  It would be nice if they had a
little more length to the seat portion (I'm 6'2") and lateral
support is obviously a must.  I'd prefer a manual seat with an
adjustable rake (for the back portion).  Other features are not
critical.  The mounting brackets for later-911's are obviously
installed.  I don't want to spend more than $1k.

Any ideas?  I've checked the "for sale" listings in Excellence
and Pano.  No match.

Subject: one last question...

    As you may know by now, it's going to be the wrenching season for me
soon... I was planning on replacing all the vacuum hoses for my 914 ('71
1.7) to cure a high (1500-1700 RPM) warm idle problem.  However, I can't
seem to make much sense of the diagram in the Haynes manual, as it shows
all the components but not really where they are located in the engine
bay.  I have a nasty suspicion that the decel. valve on my car has been
removed, but I would still like to run the hoses to it in the proper
locations, so if I can find on I can reinstall it.  Can anyone help me
out here?  Also, who's the cheapest source for vacuum hoses?  I'm not
looking for pre-cut anythihng or anything fancy here, just something to
get the job done...
    Finally, the manual shows a lot of connections on the air cleaner
that just aren't there.  What's the deal?  Could some PO have switched
the air cleaner for a bug unit?

later,

Nate

    Back to the topic of Supercharging.....  I was in Carlisle PA over this

blower for my motor.. Originally had a GMC 3-71  but it was WAY too big for
this little 2.0..  The Blower i got is designed for a 1.9 liter so it should
work... But what i need to know is the type of it (the blower) and its

a blower on it.  Are parts readily available, what about lit??  Is it a piece-

The system i plan on installing will also be intercooled via an interesting

higher boost w.o./detonation.. (hopefully, at least it works on paper)

As a boater, I had to fix a significant crack in my foul-water
holding tank (a.k.a. sewer tank) rather quickly and could not drain
it first - without getting significantly fined.  I used MarineTex,
its a two part epoxy and works GREAT!  You do not need to drain
anything, will even dry under water.  Just wipe the surface as
clean as you can (if you can, sand a little to get a good surface),
mix the stuff up, one last wipe and apply it.

Will dry almost instantly and after several years of use on
my 32' Bayliner, it never cracked/leaked.  Its amazing stuff, all
experienced boaters carry it on board.  Any decent local marina should
have it.  I think its $5.00US and well spent.

Dont know about taking the reservoir out/apart since I dont
have a 944 (maybe someday).  Good Luck,

Having run the gauntlet of I-5 through Oregon for the last
26 years, I can attest to the "proactive" attitude of the
Oregon Highway Patrol. Especially around a place called
Cottage Grove. They will use an airplane and about 8-10
cars in their revenue collecting efforts. They line up
on the on ramp like taxis at an airport. It's really
quite a sight!

As for cost, a 1981 ticket for 125mph cost $230. A 1992
ticket for 65mph cost $80. 

If anyone is looking for an alternative for I-5, I HIGHLY
recommend Hiway 395 north out of Reno all the way to the
Columbia River, then west on the freeway. It's quite
incredible, especially through southern Oregon where
it's basically a desert. Or, go north on 395 from Reno,
and cut over towards Mt. Shasta. Another incredible journey.

Todd- 

My 87 944 had the same problem (rattle under front belt shroud that
goes away after engine warms up).  It turned out to be the timing/cam 
belt slapping the shroud just below the cam sprocket(!).  The timing belt 
had been replaced about five months earlier, and it apparently 
"slackened" up.  If you take the front shroud off, you'll probably 
see a smooth dust-free spot on the inside of the shroud where the 
belt was hitting.  It didn't appear to damage the belt.

After re-tensioning the belt (the 87 has the "self-tensioner")
the problem went away.

Mike,

I had (sniff) an 86.5 928S with the same wheels...chromed.  They are 
absolutely gorgeous and make a BIG difference.  Caveat:  Tire mounter types 
have to be somewhat careful mounting rubber.

After 9 years, the chrome still looks great with only minor flaking where 
the tire guys biffed it.  $500 is probably an OK price.  Prepping the wheels 
is pretty important.

Chris,

	There is a two fold purpose to having an adjustable proportioning
valve. First, to set up the car cold with an ideal balance between front
and rear brake bias. This can change on a day-to-day or track-to-track
basis. Depending on surface, tire choice, temperature etc. Secondly, is
the desire to have an easilly adjustable valve for the driver. As the car
is driven harder and the longer a race continues, the front brakes, which
are doing the majority of the work, begin to fade. As the fronts begin to
fade, the rears will have more braking authority, if the brakes have been
finely balanced, the rears will start to lock first. This, we can all agree
(I hope), is bad. So as the fronts start to fade the driver needs to re-
adjust the brake bias so as to not swap ends when they get to the braking
zone.

	For a street car, there is no need to have a driver adjustable
valve. But for a track car, that can see very hot teps on the brakes, this
can be a very handy item indeed.

	If you ever get a chance, take a look inside the cockpit of a
formula atlantic/Indy etc. There are adjustable everythings. Sway bars
front and rear can be adjusted from the cockpit, as can the brake bias.

You gotta do something *FIRST* that makes it *NEED* more air. Otherwise,
you slow down the air velocity and low-speed performance just sucks...

Good choice. FAT actually understands this stuff.

All of the "balance" stuff should be together. You balance *ALL* of the 
rotating parts, including the clutch pressure plate. Some you also balance
staticly, like the rods, pistons, wrist pins, etc.

>  -Rebuild rods ($40)

Be *DAMN* careful on this -- do NOT let them "resize" the big ends. If the
big end is out of round, then find another good used rod instead. Re-bushing
the little end is fine, though.

I'd also add CC heads, and ...

Actually, I'd send that to H.G. Bieker. Doing it right is more expensive that
$15, particularly if it's cracked. Rush service for fixing three cracks, 
surfacing the sealing surface and lower flat surface, and cc'ing the heads
was about $150.

Have Bieker do this, and NOT a competition valve grind, but a "venturi
valve job". He'll know what it is.

You should NEVER bore a Type IV. If its' that bad, toss it. You *CAN* find
0.020 over bearings, rarely, but it's hard.

And yes on the crank. It should be checked for straightness and cracks. Either
being a problem and it's toast. There's a guy in Houston that can grind new
2.0 cranks from 1.7/1.8 cranks, and counterweight,and balance them, all for
under $200 should it come to that.

MAYBE. In the Spec Book there is a tolerance for neck wear. I personally
would not bet my new engine on being able to re-use the valves. I just about
always replace the valves if I'm pretty sure that they're original.

I guess you could use an endoscope if you can find someone what wants to
do that.... You can hook it up to something that pushes a high grade of
solvent through it under 60 PSI or so for a couple of hours. I mean, there
are all sorts of things you *COULD* do, but none are as cost effective as
just replacing it.

Counterweighted cranks put less stress on the case at higher RPMs. They're
NOT really needed. But they do help if you flog the engine pretty hard.
The coating is PolyDyne, and it's from Polymer Dynamics in Houston, TX.
A full set of main bearings is like $40 to coat, mains, rods and cams is
like $75. It's a high-pressure Teflon coating, applied properly AT THE
RIGHT TEMP, so you do actually get some benefit from it, unlike say Slick50...

>As for cost, a 1981 ticket for 125mph cost $230. A 1992
>ticket for 65mph cost $80. 

These figures are wildly out of date -- even the 1992. I drive between
Seattle and Newberg (south of Portland) fairly often and am now pretty
careful in Oregon because they recently DOUBLED the price of tickets! I
haven't had one, so can't say what the exact amounts are, but I believe that
20 or 30 mph over the I-5 limit can now cost you several hundred dollars.

I-205 around Portland seems to be pretty heavily patrolled, and there are
numerous sweet spots for speed traps, especially for those of us who like
high speed sweeping curves. I've been nailed in that situation.

Washington ticket prices are doubled if the ticket is issued in a work zone.
Oregon does something similar, but I don't know if it's 2x exactly.

Just returned yesterday from my first Seattle->Newberg->Seattle run in the
911. Great weather both ways, and it was a blast! My favorite moment was
being passed on a slight downhill by some rattly Honda boltbucket. I was
doing about 90 when this thing came roaring past on my left. About 7 seconds
later the BEL shrieked twice and I hit the brakes hard to drop to about 65.
At almost exactly the same time, a Washington patrol car came smoking off the
left shoulder just ahead of me, where it had been hiding behind some bridge
struts. I thought he was going to nab me, but he accelerated like a bat out
of hell and the next time I saw him was on the right shoulder where he was
looking with extreme displeasure at a certain Honda driver. Wahoo!

I had a thought (first one this year). Would it be possible to get the
blessing of PCNA to put a copy of each factory manual online (like on
a CD ROM drive) for access by Porschephile members. A special fee could
be charged (for the people who want this additional feature) for access
to pay the cost of buying the manuals, getting them on a CD, and buying
CD ROM drives. A lot of people complain about microfische, but access to
the info through the WWW server could be in color and Mosaic will let
you save a document in Postscript format for printing on a laser printer.

I am not a WWW expert, but I have seen a number of sites that require a
membership to get past a security wall and into a special section of
information. Maybe PCNA would like to make a donation to Porschephiles
for the loyality that this list has shown to Porsche.

If a am nuts, just tell me I am nuts. This is just a thought, and I do not
want to start a war about Porschephile access rights, etc... If the idea has
already been presented, please forgive my waste of bandwith.

Ok, I need a sanity check.  First, you can't put a traditional fuel pressure
gauge in the cockpit because there is fuel going to it.  So, you need to isolate
the gauge from the fuel with use of a sender.  

Now here's the question:  Is it acceptable to use an oil pressure gauge and 
sender (with the proper fittings, of course) for a fuel pressure gauge that
is isolated from the fuel?  I've got a spare guage (oil pressure gauges cover
the correct pressure for the injected cars) but I hesitate to actually use
this arrangement.

If memory serves, the Porsche Family Estate is in Zell Am Se in Austria not

two hotels, owned by the Porsche family.  These were covered in Excellence

In Gemund (check the map carefully as there are several Gemunds-this one is

Also in Austria, I think I remember, is a small musuem owned by Otto Mathe

Subject: 911 Hot Brakes

Hi Folks -

I just completed a track weekend at Laguna Seca and for the first time
ever was troubled by overheating brakes on my 911SC.  This was 
disappointing, since I overhauled the brakes a month ago in preparation
for this event.  The overhaul included new pads (Textar asbestos free),
rotors (Zimmermann), caliper seals (ATE), fluid (Castrol LMA), and
a bed-in period (several hundred miles).  Things were initially fine at
the track but about halfway thru each half-hour run I'd begin to get
pedal pulsations and steering wheel shimmy under braking, which would
steadily worsen until the end of the session.  After each cooldown lap,
and today on the way to work, the pulsations were gone and the brakes
were back to normal.  As far as I could tell I didn't have any brake
fade at any time, and only very minor pedal mushiness after the car was
parked between sessions.  

Seems to me like my rotors are warping when hot.  No big suprise... but
most 911 people I've talked to have had their brakes go mushy or fade
before their rotors have warped.  I'm curious what experience other 911
track junkies here have had.  How do YOU know when your brakes are cooking?
What have you done about it?  Some of you may remember my post last

Subject: Full-Flow Oil Filter on 914

        One of the mods I am considering making to my 914 motor (now
in the shop) is installing a full-flow oil filter.  To those of you
who have done that:
        How did you put it on the car?  Did you use the spin-on one
or the remote one?  Where on the car did it go?  Where did you put
the intake and outlet in the oil circuit?
        I am considering using a spin-on unit in the stock location.
This will require disabling the pressure relief piston inside the
filter-mounting flange.  IS THIS A BAD IDEA?  The filter is supposed
to be able to handle the pressure of cold oil--can the seal between
the filter and the flange?  Can the flange itself?
        Another option would be tapping the inlet and outlet holes in
the case (where the flange mounts to) and intalling AN-whatever fit-
tings to use a remote filter.  On an engine without external cooler,
does anyone have suggestions as to where to put the filter?  "Up front"
is not a good idea at the moment--I don't want to run the lines that
far until I've got a cooler.  And that won't be for a while.

        I don't know if the 71's had them.  If it's there, it should
be located down by the manifold pressure sensor below the battery.
Two hoses (one large, one small) would run from the plenum (where the
throttle goes into) and one would run from the air cleaner.

        Astoundingly enough, Auto Atlanta seems to have decent deals, even
on their pre-cut stuff.  Plus, you get a diagram of where which goes...  I
tried buying by-the-foot from two local suppliers (Economy Imports and
Kohlweiss--they've got more-or-less the right hoses) and wound up with about
$50 of hoses that way, too...

        They swiped the diagram from the VW 411 manual.  The key of the

hi there,

	i just had my water pump, thermostat, timing belt, etc done by an 
independent shop that i've been quite happy with.  my problem is that my 
temp gauge now climbs to the middle line (83 944) and stays there during 
normal highway driving.  in stop and go traffic it will rise to the 3/4 
mark, fans turn on, drops to 1/2, fans turn off.  before the water pump 
replacement, the guage would only climb to the 1/4 mark (or lower) during 
highway driving.  i just asked the mechanic about this and he said that 
the 944 engines like to run at the 1/2 mark and that my previous thermostat 
was probably opening too soon or was just staying open.  any advice?

I find knowing instantaneous fuel pressure to be about as useful as knowing
instantaneous ambient temperature. That is, not at all.

For a car with carbs, I can see *POSSIBLY* having a mechanical
gauge mounted in the engine compartment as it  may prove
instructive in debugging some idle and off-idle problems, but
full time? If you are on the high side of the pressure regulator, 
you should see whatever the dialed-in pressure is. If you ever
see it below that, you'll know it. No gas, no go.

For a car with EFI, (you did say 914, right?) the 1.7 and 2.0 should
be rock stead at about 35 PSI, and the 1.8 will be all over the damn
place from about 30 to about 70. Again, not instructive.

Why are you doing this? Why not do something at least marginally useful
like dual head temp sensors or exhaust gas temp sensor or even Lambda?

You *HAVE* a full-flow oil filter. For counter point, see your average
VW Beetle which as NOT oil filter or 356/912 which has but a lowly
bypass oil filter.

I'll assume that you are talking about something like the Canton/Meca
unit, or the System One, or Oberg or some such that's a high-flow
fine filtration unit instead of your usually medium-flow with a built
in bypass unit that just spins onto the car...

Well, as has been discussed, I put mine up front along with the
Accusump, the oil cooler, the fuel pump and the HG41 fuel filter.
Using a regular spin-on adapter.

Why exactly will this require disabling the pressure releive piston?
And yes, doing so is a VERY bad idea. I'd be really interested in knowing
who is going around giving advice like that so I can add them to The List.
(Yes. "that" List...)

I've never had a problem. What I *HAVE* had a problem with is wrong
oil line. The ugly black 'murikan "oil line" that you get a Pep Boys
is only rated for 100 PSI and 200 degrees. That's *NOT* what you need
for an air cooled engine with a Melling oil pump. You need this blue
fabric covered stuff from Aeroquip that's *ONLY* about $1.50 a foot
but is rated to over 200 PSI and I think either 350 or 400 degrees.
See the archives from summer '93 for details as that's when I had the
catastrophic oil line failure and had to figure it out...

No. Don't do that. Please.  You have no idea what you'd get into with
that... Went down that road as part of a "gee, I guess we'll through
THIS case away" attempt at a different kind of dry sump setup...

Just use the spin-on adapter. You can hang the oil filter just about
anyplace you can run a line to -- you can even use a remote filter mount
adapter, and get a spin-on canister filter (System One and C/M both have
one). If space is a big deal, consider the Oberg, as it's also a 5 micron
filter but takes up less space that your average 5-pack of floppy disks.

Under the car, in the passenger side wheel well, whereever. I know of
at least one 914 with a 2 quart Accusump and a C/M filter hung in the
wheelwell, under the assumption that no one would see it there...

Again, use either high-temp rubber hose, and good Wurth hose clamps on
the barbed fittings, or better, use "made-up" fittings (see the Yellow 
Pages under "Hydraulic Fittings and Hoses"), or best, use the AQ
steel braided stuff. Of course, if you fuck up making the fittings for
that, you'd have been as well off using soda straws...

Dave,  The supercharger you have obtained came off a G-60 Corrado, so named
because of the way the supercharger is designed.  It is a pretty neat
little unit, and would probably work very well, if your engine is built to
take it.  However, the A/C intercooler would probably not work to much
benefit, as even fantastic A/C units produce more heat than cool.  It takes
horsepower to run the compressor, so the added drag from the compressor
would kill any real advantage you obtained from added boost or timing.

Best regards,

I had to do this on a 1984 944 and found that I had to remove the reservoir 
because the leak was from an inaccessible part of the reservoir.  You first 
have to remove the large fender mount sheet steel screws at the hood/fender 
gutter and I believe two more fasteners from below.  I also found that I had 
to have the lights up and the car jacked up on that side, in order to remove 
the reservoir from below.  There is not enough clearance below the car to 
wiggle it out. I cleaned the area of the leak and used nothing more 
sophisticated than clear silicone bathtub sealant. It was almost invisible 
on the plastic and  lasted 3 years at least (I sold the car so I dont know 
if it held longer).

Can anyone tell me the pressure rating of the cooling system

The instruction manual for the pressure tester mentions several 
"standard" pressure ratings, and it says that you shouldn't ever 
exceed the rating marked on the cap.  The cap is marked with a 
"100" (which I guess is some sort of metric rating) but I have
no idea how to convert this over to psi.

There are plastic welding tools sold, for example, by Eastwood.  You have

Subject: Re: Gauge question

Pat,

We've never been able to get a straight answer from VDO on whether the oil
pressure transducers are OK for fuel.

What we put in the race car is a gauge which has, I guess you'd call it, a 
transducer or isolator.  You run a fuel line (like -3) to the isolator, which
is really just a diaphragm which translates the fuel pressure to anti-freeze
pressure.  The "out" line is filled with anti-freeze and runs to the gauge
in the cockpit.

I think the part is from Autometer.  It comes with some really crappy plastic
lines plus compression fittings for the isolator-to-cockpit run.  We replaced
them with -3 Aeroquip and a couple of NPT-to-AN adapters.  You have to
air-bleed the coolant side, which is a pain.  But once installed the set-up 
works very well.

Subject: "New" 914, Is it Worth It?

Hello All,
  Thanks for responses to my "914 Wanted Inquiry".  One car I've found sounds
almost too nice for my purposes.  A '72 with '73 Blueprinted 2.0 Liter
upgrade (113 HP).  Bought by Porsche mechanic new, maintained wonderfully, from
discription sounds like the closest thing to a "new" 914.  Asking price is $10K
which does not sound unreasonable considering the price of any new econobox
today, and the state of 914's I've been looking at (Rust gods been busy).
  I believe that the car was meticulously cared for but these are my concerns:
1) I want daily transportation, I am careful, but the car will have the snot
   driven out of it, I guarantee! (I loved my hot-rod bugs with cheap power)
2) I like to keep the mechanicals and maintainence up for reliability and looks
  but I've never owned a show car. I like the idea of the near-new condition,
  but is the car too sacred to be subjected to normal-use wear and tear?

3) 914-6's (one with 80K orig mi/owner) are for Sale in S.F. bay Area for
   $10.5K, this seems to have a hands-down advantage on holding value (not to
   mention the added thrills in driving the snot out of a torque monster).
  I'm not buying an investment that I plan to retire on, but I don't have a
  big enough market sample in S.F. Bay Area to judge whether the $10K 4 cyl.
  is reasonably priced when compared against other "perfect" cars or complete
  restorations.
I appreciate the costs in restoring old European Toys ('76 Moto Guzzi Lemans I)
and I know that my motorcycle fully restored is marketable at roughly my costs
in parts and powdercoating. Is this 914 worth it? thanks brian

In the 9/81 Pano, there's a "Le Mans 1981" article which mentions a

Qassim,

If you suspect the DME, you should be able to test its operation by
looking at the injector pulses with an oscilloscope, and the spark
plug signals with a Sun analyser.

I've never heard of "burn time."  Are you measuring spark duration?
It really isn't an issue, esp. at the durations you quote.  CD ignitions
runs much shorter pulses and work OK.

When you measure the CO, are you testing pre-cat and open loop?

Have you monitored fuel rail pressure, esp. at the higher RPM's where
the car's power drops?  Replaced the fuel filter?

If the clutch is slipping, you can feel it and here it.  The engine note
and RPM's are per the higher RPM it is turning, but you sense the drop off
in speed or acceleration.

What service, if any, did you have done to the car in the time leading
up to your problem?  Clutch replaced?  Have you checked the speed and
reference mark sender for gap?  Checked its signal with a 'scope?

Subject: "Notchy" shifting, transaxle oil?

Dear Transaxle Gurus:

I am experiencing notchy shifting in my 89 944 Turbo. This only occurs when
the car is hot, ie after I have been driving for more than 15 minutes. Second
gear is the worst, and it is really only bad when I try to take it out of
second. The other gears are OK, but more effort is required to shift the trans
mission after the car is hot, as opposed to when the car is just warm.

I plan on changing the transaxle fluid, as the car has 45K miles, and it has
not been changed since 30K. Should this solve the problem? I plan on using
"Sweptco" fluid. Is this OK, or are there better things to use? Do I need an
additive because the transaxle is a limited slip (last car I owned with
limited slip required it)? I drive the car on (at least I plan to) the track
about 4-6 times per year, so I need a fluid than can stand up to track
driving.

Are you taking it to 4000rpm and stomping it or slowly applying throttle?
If you are slowly applying throttle, I don't believe it's the clutch.  
Otherwise I believe the clutch is a possible diagnosis. 

Is this something
that came on all of a sudden or over time.  If it is over time, I believe
it could be the clutch.  

Did you check the intake system for possible 
blockages?  Maybe the airflow meter is getting hung up or the throttle is
not opening all the way?  

If it was the clutch, it seems to me that the 
motor would spin up real quick and the car would not follow.  From what you 
describe I can't really tell.  I don't know why the clutch would fail to slip
at a low rpm and not at a high rpm.  That engine makes a fair amount of torque
at 2500 rpm which is what causes the clutch to slip if you are applying full
throttle.  If it was the clutch, it seems to me that the slipping would start
where the torque curve had a large slope.  As I remember, that engine's torque
curve starts to flatten out at 2500 or 3000 rpm.

Are you noticing any coolant around the clutch housing?  Maybe
you have a real slow leak in the heater control valve which would drip 
coolant on the clutch, just enough to cause 
slippage.  But this is not consistent with it being better when cold and 
getting worse when hot(just throwing out ideas).

My gut is telling me that the problem is related to not enough air/fuel 
running through the motor.

sounds to me like your rotors are warping (getting too hot). can happen before

On early 944 cars (1983-1985/1) the 100 indicates 14 psi (1.00 bar). On

        Why?  So that cold oil does not bypass the filter, of course!

        I had figured that the adaptor was for people who weren't going

when you had gone through the trouble...
        Okay, now I'm leaning to C/M's spin-on type.  It'll go where the
stock filter goes, and hopefully isn't much longer or fatter.  I should
be getting the C/M catalog soon, so I can see what the difference is.
Other than (probably) being larger with more filter element area, do you
know if the remote filter is better than the spin-on version?

pfiles,

Oregon is highly proactive in their revenue collection activities as
has been mentioned here:  Aircraft, radar, unmarked cars, etc.  Do
be carefull.

OTOH, Southern Oregon between Roseburg and Grant's Pass (~100-150 miles)
has some truly great driving on I-5 in low traffic conditions:  There is
a series of minor "mountain" passes around 1000-1500' ft.... ABout 4 or 5
of them.  Makes for some great winding uphill runs.  There are always two
lanes and if there are not too many big rigs, rv's and country squire wagons
on the road, it can be a wild ride.

For a serious excursion not-for-the-weak-of-stomach, take 199 between
Grant's Pass and Crescent City.  It's one of the connectors between I-5
and the coast highway (101).  Serious mountains.  Very remote.

If you take 101 and follow the coast (highly recommended on week days
for light traffic) do be carefull as it is not an interstate and is 55
the whole way :^(    The scenery is *intense* from the California border
to Port Orford.....

I have made these runs many times.  If anyone is interested in route

Rather than machining or grinding up a perfectly good set of new turbo valve

You might also want to visit Zeltweg (southwest of Leoben) and the
Osterreichring: last time I was there, you could buy laps at a very
reasonable rate.  I spent a pleasant hour or so chasing Alfasuds (practicing
for an upcoming race on the weekend) in my rental Golf.  There's also a nice
small hotel on the hill overlooking the back-straight, with balconies
commanding a view of the entire track and the valley below.

Austria is a beautiful country, certainly one of the most scenic in Europe,
with very friendly people.  It was also interesting on my first visit there
many years ago to find they speak German with a southern accent, much the
same way that we speak English in our own South.

It was pointed out to me by a lady friend that the only place that 
safe sex can occur is in the back seat of a Volvo, parked in the garage

I have to say that I am truly disgusted by the overtly sexist attitudes 
pervading this thread.  Think now:

1) Which is truly more reliable, your Porsche or your devoted S.O.? (OK, 
I'll give you this one, but only because it is a superior design)

2) From which do you consistantly derive more pleasure? (Damn, that's 
two...)

3) Which do we tend to have longer relationships with? (Uh oh.)

4) Which causes you the least grief? (Shit.  This isn't working, is it)

5) Which tends to be there when you really need it? (Well, I guess you just 
turn the key...)

6) Forget it.  I'm afraid I have to fall on the sword on this whole 
thing....

Seriously, though, isn't it rather odd that we compare the two?  My ex-wife 
had a REAL problem with my Porsche.  NEVER understood.  But she was one of 
those who just considers cars a mode of transport, you know.  My present 
S.O. on the other hand, likes P-cars, can DRIVE, and is going to Parade with 
me.  My daughter LOVES Porsches.  Pity the poor young suitor who pronounces 
the holy word as one syllable.  She will surely emasculate him on the spot.

I'd feel better of some of the female Porschephiles would relate some 
similar stories.  That way this wouldn't appear to be a Y chromosome thing.

To add a bit of X chromosome flavour to this thread, I'd like to make mention
that there are a lot of women out there like Bob's S.O. who like Porsches, can

I've always had a love for cars especially the Porsche 911, and am now the
proud owner of a 1987 911 Targa.  Most guys I meet are just as enthusiastic

My hinges are ok, but last month my leather pad cracked in several
places. I gave treatments of 303 Protectant prior to the cracking
but not often enough. The rest of the dash is ok. I attribute the
cracking to my resting my arm on it. Maybe something in my skin
attacks leather.  If yours hasn't started cracking yet, you might
want to treat it often with the product of your choice (not Armor-All).

I've been running an oil pressure sender in the Control Pressure circuit
of my CIS injection since, um, early '89, and have had no problems with
it yet.  It reads out on the dash oil pressure gauge when selected by
a switch.  Oil and gas seemed of similar enough origins that I didn't think
about the materials compatibility issue for too long before I did this.
The sender's dead volume and compliance didn't have any noticeable
effect on the CIS operation.

Don't know what your application is, see Stan's comments regarding
usefulness (NOT) of fuel pressure readout in some applications.  On my
CIS car it was fairly useful in getting the warmup regulator set up
and shimmed for proper operation... since then I've hardly used it,
except for that one time that it confirmed I'd been dumb enough to run
out of gas...

I went through the same exercise about two years ago. The covers were

where the interference problem exists. The remaining material, approximately
3/16" webs, is more than enough to prevent the warping and the subsequent
leakage like the original magnesium covers. For those that don't understand
the problem - if the turbo-type exhaust valve covers are not machined you
can't remove same to adjust the valves with the engine in the car!

     a five bolt pattern rather than four.

In traffic, my gauge will rise to the 3/4 mark, the fans will turn on, but

I have to agree here, I was starting to wonder what type of group we have
got here - You know how to pick the right car, how come you can't figure out
how to pick the right S.O.?
My Man and I BOTH love porsches and since we recently sold 2 912's we had

gets to drive it. (Fortunantly he needs the truck for work, I often win!)

Never done it on a porsche, but will be doing it this Friday.  I 
changed the M/C on my old 1984 BMW 318i the first and last time.  It 
was very easy to do.  Too easy.  The only hard part for me was makimg 
sure I got all the air out of the M/C before I put it in the car and 
then bleeding the brakes with a helper.  That actually was the hard 
part.  We had to pump the pedal and then tighten the bleeder valve 40 
times on each of the rear brakes before we got the pedals hard.  At 
first we thought we really messed up but we did it in the end.

Mine has this same problem. Bleeding it fixes the problem for about

open the coolant tank except to bleed the system. Could this be due
to agressive driving or extreme parking attitudes exposing the

You can get the remote with a special top plate that makes hooking up

Dear P'philes:
     There have been a couple threads, most recently Jerry et al's query
about Bremo brake parts. In other circumstances in the past, parts not
available in the US of A *were* available in Europe. For instance, when 914s
first came out, Porsche sent rear caliper rebuild kits in the dealer parts
stock. About three months later (I think) they recalled all these kits. The
Service Reps mumbled something about 'product liability' with improperly
rebuilt calipers. I'm pretty sure that Porsche GB offered rebuilt A-arms for
the 911s with non-replacable bushings. Is it possible that P'philes in Europe
could check out the part numbers at their end? I can't believe that the Royal
Mail (for instance) would charge more than $4.00 Air Post to get a rebuilt
kit (if available) to the US.

Subject: Faster cornering by no skidding?

Here is the quick question:
We have concluded that with ABS we can stop faster BECAUSE ABS PREVENTS
SKIDDING. Some also keep talking about going faster around a corner BY SLIDING
THE CAR AROUND. Is there an inconsistency here? Would we corner faster by
obtaining the maximum centripetal (opposite to centrifugal) acceleration by 
being AT THE VERGE of sliding sideways, instead of actually sliding?

1. Fact: The maximum coefficient of static friction (just before it slides) 
is greater than the dynamic coefficient of friction (while it slides). 
Note that in dynamic friction the microscopic surface irregularities result in 
some material being scraped off. But what if there is A LOT of material scraped
off? (Like when locking the brakes and flat-spotting the tires?)
Things being NON LINEAR, one must do the individual tests to derive
further conclusions.

2. Some conclude: Therefore maximum braking is obtained just before the tires
lock. By extrapolation we also  ASSUME that ABS permit the driver to slam the
brakes, the computers do the  of/off thing at several cycles per second (kHz)
at the limit of static friction, and thus one obtains maximum braking. Locking
them is not as good, despite the extra material scraped off in the
flat-spotting action. I agree, but only because of item 3 below.

3. Experiment: People on the list have indicated that experienced drivers
driving  non ABS cars were not able to stop as fast as inexperienced drivers
stomping on their ABS. Ok, I will accept this experimental evidence. Maximum
friction from the tires is NOT WHEN SLIDING AND SCRAPING MATERIAL OFF in the
slide, it is obtained at the limit of static friction. At least with usual road
materials on usual tires. If I search hard I may find unusual tire/road
material combinations for which the opposite is true, but given where I buy
tires and where I drive, non-skid braking is the fastest. 

4. The more the centrifugal g (a measure of centripetal acceleration in
cornering) the faster the car will go around the bend. It's the basics of
circular motion.  So, if the car was a particle, it would go faster around the
corner by obtaining the maximum centripetal acceleration, ie at the limit of
sliding sideways, but without sliding. 

5. But the car is not a particle; at the cornering limit a 911 has 3 wheels on
the ground (front inside is up).  If the rear is sliding out (oversteer), all
four wheels are on the ground. So why do people imply that they will go around
the corner faster by sliding the rear end out? Why, because it will  turn the
car in the desired direction of travel, of course. But hey, if the rear is
sliding, then one can put less power on the SKIDDING rear wheels than if they
were at the verge of static friction (same logic as in items 1,2,3 above). Less
power  because of less friction between the wheels and the road means slower!

Differences may appear depending on: front vs. rear wheel drive; 2WD vs. 4WD;
limited slip differentials etc. So let's limit the discussion to 78-83 911 SCs 
and 84-89 Carreras, strictly rear wheel drives, heavy at the back, without 
limited slip differentials. What's the net wisdom? Fastest cornering by being: 
a) at the verge of sliding; or b) actually sliding? 
IF THE LATTER, WHY THE APPARENT DISCREPANCY WITH BRAKING?
What am I missing here?

If I am not satisfied with your answers I will instrument my '87 911 and
promptly go for some "experiments" in our parking lot. Do you think that the
Dept. of Transportation, or any other organization, may fund this "experimental
research project"? And can you imagine the face of the chief of campus police
when my assistants rope off the parking lot and I strap on the helmet?
This summer looks promising already!

just one day.

To get an application, call (408) 374-1298. After gaining access, punch
"34" to put your request in for an application. You can also have 
the technical info sent while in "34".

No open exhausts, but we are allowed 103dB.

Both questions have gotten a range of replies from "it's broken" to "it's
normal."

Kevin suggests it may be a trapped-air problem, to which I have a
question below.

However, I want to throw out something that I have been thinking about.
Could the temperature difference be due to a different concentration of
anti-freeze before and after the repairs? I know that my car probably
had very little anti-freeze before the system flush. It was refilled with a
50-50 mix of Autobahn (genuine Por$che) anti-freeze and distilled
water (plus some RedLine water wetter). Now doesn't anti-freeze
not conduct heat as well as pure water? Couldn't a higher
concentration of anti-freeze make the car run hotter than otherwise?

The somewhat higher operating temperatures don't seem to be a
problem for my car which has recently included some drivers' ed
events at relatively high speeds. I have been thinking about draining
some of the coolant and replacing with just water to bring it
closer to a 1/3-2/3 anti-freeze to water ratio (since it doesn't get that
cold here in Seattle) to improve the cooling.

Now to the cooling system bleeding question: can it be done with the
engine cold or do you have to wait until the thermostat opens? I did
the latter and it was difficult to tell when the air had been bled since
there was so much steam and splattering. BTW, hot anti-freeze sure
makes a mess of your engine; stains the intake manifold and the
cam tower. Good thing I thought to cover the fenders to protect
the paint.

Theo, this is your problem right here.
This is a "fact" only for very simple
frictional interactions, and the tire/asphalt
interaction is far from simple.

As it happens, the static coefficient of friction
for tires on asphalt is lower than the coefficient
at about 5% slip, and depending on the tire compound
and construction and the surface, can go on increasing
to about 15% slip for serious race tires on grippy stuff.

Under braking, if you lock up the tires, they are now
at 100% slip, and the effective coefficient of friction
is lots less than even the static value. ABS helps by
keeping the wheels from locking up. A really good driver
on dry consistent pavement can out-perform ABS by keeping
the slip rate right at the optimal value - ABS doesn't
even try to do this, it just eases off the brake whenever
lockup starts to occur.

> Note that in dynamic friction the microscopic surface irregularities result in
> some material being scraped off. 

You hit the nail right on the thumb here.
The reason that the effective coefficient
of friction goes up as the tire starts to
slip is that the material being scraped off
is initially quite firmly connected to the tire -
scraping it off requires work, which requires
force - more force than you get when there is
no slip at all. Once the slip rate passes
the optimal value, there isn't enough material
getting scraped off to compensate for the more
intense dynamic effects that are the dominant
factor in the "simple case" - in short, the
road irregularities are not in contact with
a given bit of rubber long enough to rip it
loose, at least not often enough to increase
the force sufficiently.

Well, it would be a mistake to think that
I can tell you how hard you can corner while
sitting here in front of the computer. But
I can tell you how to find out - get on track!
Run the corners - inch up on it. If your butt
is insensitive, get a G-analyst and use it.
But you'll most likely be able to tell where
the "edge" is - go just a bit past it, and
the traction falls off very quickly.

In the wet, under changeable conditions. Real test drivers on dry,
consistent pavement can do so, but they have to try very hard.
In race driving, the ABS is better because you don't have to
concentrate so hard - you can think more about your tactical
and strategic situation instead of having to worry about squeezing
that last 2% out of the brakes. Or maybe 1% - it really isn't much
of a margin.

This is just nonsense. If the car was a particle, it wouldn't matter if it
was sliding or not - the centripetal acceleration would be omega^2 * r, 
exactly. So what? In fact, the slip rate has to be non-zero to get the
best cornering force.

No, that effect is not related. You want the slip rate (ratio of side slip to
forward travel, or tangent of slip angle) to be the optimal value for you
tire and the surface you are on. Use of rotation to position the car for
the upcoming track features is an entirely different subject.

> But hey, if the rear is

You are confusing sliding, slipping, and skidding. They are different.

> Less
> power  because of less friction between the wheels and the road means slower!

This is another problem - you are taking a fairly simple picture and
making it even more complicated. There are two possible sources of slip:
the tire isn't going quite the direction it's pointed, and the wheel isn't
turning quite at the speed of the car. These two sources of slip sum up,
and the (vector) sum has to be at the optimal value. So if you want
to apply more power, you have to give up some cornering force. But your
total traction didn't change, just how you are trying to use it.

By the way, T*D had some interesting theories about this same subject...


> a) at the verge of sliding; or b) actually sliding? 

Neither - maximal turning force occurs at the optimal slip rate.

> IF THE LATTER, WHY THE APPARENT DISCREPANCY WITH BRAKING?

There isn't any. Maximal braking force also occurs at the optimal
slip rate. And maximal acceleration force occurs at the optimal
slip rate.

Use a race track. Get some track time under your belt. That's what you
really need to learn this stuff, and besides it's about the most fun

Actually, tires provide their best traction with a slight amount of slip.
In turn this would mean a slight slip angle. When breaking this would mean
the wheel is turning and the tire is slipping slightly. When accelerating
this would mean the tire is slightly slipping but not spinning faster than
the car is actually moving.

No. Maximum breaking is reached when there is some slippage with the wheel
still rotating.

This may be true in some tests. The advantage of ABS is that you do not have
to worry about locking up your brakes so you can just stand on them. A great
driver that knows his car and brakes well should be able to stop faster than
the same car with ABS.

with a slight amount of slip angle.

A properly balanced 911 will have all four tires on the ground when at the
"cornering limit". A 911 that lifts the inside front tire in a turn is too
roll stiff in the front. Of course, the inside front tire will be lightly
load as compared to the outside front tire. Again, when in a turn, tires
provide their best traction with a slight amount of slip angle.

However, this does not mean that you want the back end of you 911 hanging
out with a major slip angle. This may look spectacular, but it is not very
fast. The lift throttle oversteer characteristic can be very good for
getting around tight turns but don't confuse this with power on oversteer.

I did read somewhere about some [professional] driver that was "hanging 
the rear end out" a lot and when asked if that technique wasn't actually
slower
than going around the corner in the conventional manner he replied:

"When making love, you are not always trying to make babies."

In other words, this wasn't trying to win a race, he was having fun.
I'm guessing now, but I think it may have been Ruf's driver giving

Subject: 915 transmissions

Porchephiles-
This last weekend fellow Porschephile Bill Simer and I had the pleasure 
of replacing the input shaft seal in a early style (06) 915 transmission. 
According to the manual one has to almost completely dissassemble the 
transmission to do this.  (not one of the good Doctor's best designs, as
evidenced by it's correction in later models)  After the successful 
(so-far) completion of this task, I have a couple of questions.

1.) Has anyone ever tried forcibly removing the throwout bearing support
tube, in order to replace the seal without such a radical dissassembly of
the transmission. Yes it will come out, and no you probably don't want to 
know the details.

2.) Since the location of the raised area on the input shaft where the seal
rides, and the area in the tube that has a slightly lesser diameter than 
the rest of the tube and where the seal is held do not match very well, I 
was wondering if the seal is different in the earlier transmissions.  
When I put the seal in the necked down area of the tube, both lips of the
seal did not properly contact the raised area of the shaft,  this lead to 
pretty blue $40.00 per gallon puddles under the car.  If this last 
statement leads your mind to form questions, please don't ask them.  If 
anyone has a parts catalog, would you please let me know if perhaps the
915/06 /15 uses a different seal than does a 915/08 /12 or /63.  Since 
we  had the gasket & seal kit listed for 915 transmissions in general, we 
do not know  if there might be a slight difference in seal outside diameter
on the 915/06.

3.) I may be confused as to what year and type number the 915 transmission 
was changed so that the input shaft seal could be changed from the

Well, I chose my S.O. before I got (any) Porsches. Now that I have two

From: "Byron D. Short / AFS Inc." <bshort@usa.net>
Subject: Slip Angles/Max G Loads

The current thread on tire slip angles is very interesting.  Let me add 2 
cents worth, and ask a question about ABS related thereto.

Some time ago BFG published a chart showing the maximum lateral load 
generated by their R1s as slip angle increases.  The R1 at that time was 
the 206 series (this was about '91 if memory serves).  At any rate, the 
maximum lateral force was available at about 12% slip angle, but was very 
near the maximum levels beginning around 8%.  After about 13% or so, the 
lateral force dropped dramatically.  This is what we all feel as the car 
"comes around".  

So the idea is to stay in the "fat" part of the slip angle, but not go 
past that optimum limit.  Some tires give a tell-tale slight loss of g's 
as you go over the peak before the big drop in g's that represent an all 
out slide.  This is what you'll hear referred to as a "forgiving" tire.  
Some don't telegragh this so well, and are referred to as "peaky".

The following explanation refers to autocrossing speeds; I'm not 
qualified to talk about higher speeds and could only guess about what you 
feel in a 100 mph corner--I haven't done then enough to be calm at those 
speeds yet!  ;-)

Typically you hit the max slip angle with one end or the other, that is, 
either you approach it by pushing the front, or by slipping the rear.  
I liken the difference to "carving" versus "pitching".  

Carving is best when you can run flat out (or nearly so) through a turn,
and is characterized by increasing loads on the front causing slight
understeer at the limit.  In this scenario, the car is generally making an
ever larger arc, due to the ever increasing speed.  Picture a skier
carving a turn with minimal slip. 

If a turn can't be negotiated full-on, then some pitching is often the
best approach.  On some cars, (most Porsches, by my experience), you can
begin a rotation with drop power oversteer.  This rotation "snaps"  the
car up the the maximum slip angle (and maximum g load) very quickly, much
more quickly than carving your way up.  This also serves to "point"  the
car down the next straight.  "Catch the slide" by applying power, and you
find yourself rocketing towards the next turn.  The trade offs are speed
and risk.  Speed: remember, you got there by lifting (and sometimes
braking simultaneously) so obviously you've slowed down.  Couple that with
the effects of "scrub" and you can see that this only works when you need
to slow down for the turn anyway.  Risk: if you go too far, you can lose
serious time or even spin.  Picture a skier doing "step turns", sliding 
the rear or his skis around to point him in his new direction.

My wife and I often identify an autocross course by a series of 
"pitches".  We consider that since a carve is simply trying to negotiate 
the turn as smoothly as possible, and usually at full throttle, there's 
not much to remember there.  But the turns that require a "pitch" are the 
ones that determine the winner since they are harder to execute well.

Either carving or pitching can produce maximum g's, at least in theory. 
(Yes, I know, I'm ignoring the possibility of using all four tires equally
well...) Which is better?  A few years ago when the G-Analyst came out there
was an article wherein the author used the G-Analyst to determine max g's
on his RX7 Turbo on a skid-pad at MIS.  When he was satisfied he had it
all, he offered the car to Little Al, who happened to be testing at MIS
that day. Little Al "carved" his way up to the limit, which was later 
confirmed to be substantially the same limit the author had reached.  
Then Al "pitched" the car, and drove around the skid pad under heavy 
throttle with the tail slightly out (maybe 12%??).  The G-Analyst showed 
nearly a 10% increase in G's!

Now my question on ABS.  Several have stated that a great driver can beat 
the ABS in a controlled situation.  I've found that my 914 (no ABS of 
course) would typically only pull about .4 braking g's and rarely go 
beyond .6 when on the autocross course.  (Obviously more is available in 
straights, but autox courses have no straights...)  In my 944 (with ABS) 
I was amazed to find that I'm braking at .8 g's almost as a matter of 
course!  I assumed that this was because in a real world application like 
autocross, you're always pulling some significant lateral g's and the 
non-abs car tends to lock the light tire(s) first, whereupon I modulate 
back, thereby not getting all that I can from the loaded tires.  
Conversely, the ABS car, being 4 channel, permits maximum braking on the 
loaded tire without locking the "light" tire.  If my guess is right, then 
wouldn't it be impossible for a driver to beat the ABS in these 
conditions unless, of course, he had a brake pedal for each wheel and 
four feet?  Or do you learn to live with the flat spots on the "light" 
tire and modulate the loaded tire?

What I'm about to relate isn't a modification to the brake system, but a
modification
to the driver.  

I had my brakes fade big-time at a PCA driver's ed last year.  Eye opening
experience -
can you say "Jesus H. Christ on a popsickle stick"?  This happened relatively
early
in the day, and, not wanting to quit early I went back out (the next time my
run group
was up) and was fine.  I had heard that if your brakes are overheating, the
problem
may be that you are using them *too* much.  I found that if I did all of my
braking
as hard and fast as I could, my brakes were fine (my brakes are totally
stock).
To this day, I accomplish my braking the in this same manner.  As hard as I
can
for as short a time as I can.  I'm going alot faster than I used to and have
had
no fading as a result, so I'm inclined to believe that there may be something
to
the advice.

Any experts care to comment?

From: wilson@ns.net (Larry Wilson)
Subject: Re: Faster cornering by no skidding?

What an entertaining thread! I had no idea that going fast depended on
understanding terms like: maximum centripetal (opposite to centrifugal)
acceleration; maximum coefficient of static friction; limit of static
friction; and, centrifugal g (a measure of centripetal acceleration in
cornering). I thought I knew slip angle, but am not sure now since much of
the context baffles me.

One thing I do know -- the principles of "cornering fast" in a parking lot
are quite different than on a race track (speed makes a world of
difference). Generalizations about "faster cornering" are not very useful
to people on the list who may be searching for ways to improve their
performance in vastly different environments, some in a parking lot and
others on a race track. For me, the "perfect autocross car" was just plain
dangerous at speed on a race track (the instant oversteer would almost
cause me heart failure in the first fast turn). Conversely, a well-set-up
race car was a pig in a parking lot event (would understeer right off the
first turn). And, I think the driving technique for faster cornering is
likewise different (and in some ways, opposite), because of the differences
of speed allowed by the course.

These theoretical terms of "fast cornering" may make for delightful
discussion, but are not very helpful in practical application. You learn to
drive faster (and in some instances by slower cornering) by instruction,
experience, and by comparing methods at the track with faster drivers who
probably couldn't begin to explain their superior performance with these
terms. They might say, however, "Yup, I pitched it, got back on the gas,
and fed a little opposite lock without scrubbing off too much speed."
That's the language I suggest you learn.

- ---------------------

I did that few months ago on my 76/911S.  I am not sure how differ it is from
a 78. The general procedure is not too bad. You need to jack up the front of
the car and remove the pan which protects against the steering rack, the
swaybars and the brake cylinder.

Also remove the front tires/wheels so that you can drain the brake fluid.
Remove all three small diamenter brass brake lines from the MC. They are left
front, right front, and the rear. Take care not to bend these lines.
Remove the two plastic hoses with brass ends that come down from the top
(from the brake fluid resevior). They are just held down by couple of rubber
grumets. Be prepare to catch any brake fluid left in the system.

Next remove the two bolts that holds the MC against the firewall.

The installation is the reverse of above procedure. :-)

Ahhh, not exactly. The problem for me was putting the two plastic hoses back
in. The new rubber grumets were so tough and the space was so cramp that I
ended up loosen up the other end of the hoses (right at the resevior). I put
the hoses down enough, lubricate the rubber with some brake fluid, heat the
rubber a bit with a heat gun, then insert the plastic hoses in.

Now bolt the MC back against the firewall. You may need another person to
assist you in guiding the brake peddle push rod into the MC from the inside
of the car.

Install the rest of the lines tightly. And don't forget to bleed the entire
brake system (all four corners). You will need at least on big bottle (maybe
equal to 4 little ones) brake fluids to flush the entire system.

These were the steps I went through. I am not sure if your 78/911 is similar
or not, so take it as reference ONLY.

Subject: For Sale, 84 911 Targa Euro, Wanted Turb look 911..Long!

Sorry for the wide distribution, I wish we had a California only (or USA)
for specific "for sale" emails .

Anyway, I am going to put my beloved '84 911 on the market for sale in an
effort to buy a factory Turbo body Targa, Cab or coupe.
 Car is located in San Jose, Ca.

1984 Targa Carrera
3rd owner (2nd owner had it for 3 months then lost job)
Euro with DOT approval and passes all Ca emissions (been in Ca since 1989)

owners drive it and have had very positive feedback. As you know, it is a
Euro spec enigine which has higher compression ratio, and according to
Bruce Anderson's article about chips (thanks a lot mr Tom Craney for fax)
it can have about 10 more hp than a US model with the same intake/exhaust
and chip mods.

Love to keep car, but ex-wife takes out too much money thx to Ca court system!

Asking price at $19.8k OBO, be brave and make an offer...I can take it!
(I got over $4k of mods in it)

It needs the following:

Gbox as above
O2 sensor
Good home

        I am looking for a 84+ Factory Turbo look Targa, Cab or Coupe in
that order. Most colors considered (not red, love it but cops love it
more!).

Subject: 944 Cam Sprocket Bolt Removal Advice?

Greetings all,

Want to replace the front cam seal (O-ring) on my '83 944 but am having
difficulty removing the internal wrenching bolt holding the cam sprocket on.
  I've tried heating with a propane torch for ~5 minutes followed by electric
impact wrench to no avail but with slight deformation of the bolt head.

Since the bolt is shrouded by the cam sprocket and the thought of stripping
it out makes me very nervous,  it may be that I'm just not being rough enough
with it.  

Anyone have experience with this bolt and know any TRICK? 

Do I need to get it hotter with say an Oxy-Acetylene torch instead of
propane?

Should I go at it with the impact wrench while still hot or wait until cool?

Any response is greatly appreciated.

I need to do this same operation, and after dealing with the cam bolt I
have decided that I will take the cam housing off before I take the cam
sproket off (I have to replace the cam housing gasket anyways since it also
is leaking a bit). I was **very** nervous about applying a lot of force to
the cam sprocket bolt (perhaps my fear of slipping, turning the cam shaft,
and manually mashing my valves into my pistons).

The cam sprocket bolt is very shallow and it seems to be very hard to get
the socket well seated in there while holding the cam sproket still with a
wrench. I think (hope!) this is much easier with the cam housing off of the
motor and on the bench.

Just my $.02 worth. Please correct me if I'm way off base here !!!

I did read somewhere about some [professional] driver that was "hanging

slower
than going around the corner in the conventional manner he replied:

Subject: 915 transmissions

Porchephiles-
This last weekend fellow Porschephile Bill Simer and I had the pleasure 
of replacing the input shaft seal in a early style (06) 915 transmission. 
According to the manual one has to almost completely dissassemble the 
transmission to do this.  (not one of the good Doctor's best designs, as
evidenced by it's correction in later models)  After the successful 
(so-far) completion of this task, I have a couple of questions.

1.) Has anyone ever tried forcibly removing the throwout bearing support
tube, in order to replace the seal without such a radical dissassembly of
the transmission. Yes it will come out, and no you probably don't want to 
know the details.

2.) Since the location of the raised area on the input shaft where the seal
rides, and the area in the tube that has a slightly lesser diameter than 
the rest of the tube and where the seal is held do not match very well, I 
was wondering if the seal is different in the earlier transmissions.  
When I put the seal in the necked down area of the tube, both lips of the
seal did not properly contact the raised area of the shaft,  this lead to 
pretty blue $40.00 per gallon puddles under the car.  If this last 
statement leads your mind to form questions, please don't ask them.  If 
anyone has a parts catalog, would you please let me know if perhaps the
915/06 /15 uses a different seal than does a 915/08 /12 or /63.  Since 
we  had the gasket & seal kit listed for 915 transmissions in general, we 
do not know  if there might be a slight difference in seal outside diameter
on the 915/06.

3.) I may be confused as to what year and type number the 915 transmission 
was changed so that the input shaft seal could be changed from the 
bellhousing side by using tool number P 386.  Can anyone shed any light
on this, the manual is not too clear, it just says units 915/02 /08 /12
are of this type.  Not that it would make much difference, since we
did not have a "P 386".

Disclaimer:  We know for certain that this transmission has been opened 
before, since some parts, mainly the fifth speed gearset have been  
replaced.  So it may be some sort of mix and match situation.

If anyone really wants to know the grizzly details of this whole debacle
I would be happy to tell you the finer points that I have omitted here.
Suffice it to say for now that I am a lot more familiar with Porsche  
transmissions than I intended to be.  Oh well, it was sort of fun, and 
as my wife says, it keeps me out of the bars.

Thanks in advance

    Just my data point... crutchfield had an antenna for my 914 for $10.
 plus three-something shipping (their standard charge for everything.) 
Can't vouch for the quality, as I haven't been home yet, but for that,
I'll at least have something until I can afford a Hirschmann...

Well, I chose my S.O. before I got (any) Porsches. Now that I have two

trashed two other cars earlier). I try to convince her that it wouldn't

But other than that, she _loves_ Porsches and _hates_ all japanese

I think my S.O. would be offended if I called her "classical" - she'd think

From: "Byron D. Short / AFS Inc." <bshort@usa.net>
Subject: Slip Angles/Max G Loads

The current thread on tire slip angles is very interesting.  Let me add 2 
cents worth, and ask a question about ABS related thereto.

Some time ago BFG published a chart showing the maximum lateral load 
generated by their R1s as slip angle increases.  The R1 at that time was 
the 206 series (this was about '91 if memory serves).  At any rate, the 
maximum lateral force was available at about 12% slip angle, but was very 
near the maximum levels beginning around 8%.  After about 13% or so, the 
lateral force dropped dramatically.  This is what we all feel as the car 
"comes around".  

So the idea is to stay in the "fat" part of the slip angle, but not go 
past that optimum limit.  Some tires give a tell-tale slight loss of g's 
as you go over the peak before the big drop in g's that represent an all 
out slide.  This is what you'll hear referred to as a "forgiving" tire.  
Some don't telegragh this so well, and are referred to as "peaky".

The following explanation refers to autocrossing speeds; I'm not 
qualified to talk about higher speeds and could only guess about what you 
feel in a 100 mph corner--I haven't done then enough to be calm at those 
speeds yet!  ;-)

Typically you hit the max slip angle with one end or the other, that is, 
either you approach it by pushing the front, or by slipping the rear.  
I liken the difference to "carving" versus "pitching".  

Carving is best when you can run flat out (or nearly so) through a turn,
and is characterized by increasing loads on the front causing slight
understeer at the limit.  In this scenario, the car is generally making an
ever larger arc, due to the ever increasing speed.  Picture a skier
carving a turn with minimal slip. 

If a turn can't be negotiated full-on, then some pitching is often the
best approach.  On some cars, (most Porsches, by my experience), you can
begin a rotation with drop power oversteer.  This rotation "snaps"  the
car up the the maximum slip angle (and maximum g load) very quickly, much
more quickly than carving your way up.  This also serves to "point"  the
car down the next straight.  "Catch the slide" by applying power, and you
find yourself rocketing towards the next turn.  The trade offs are speed
and risk.  Speed: remember, you got there by lifting (and sometimes
braking simultaneously) so obviously you've slowed down.  Couple that with
the effects of "scrub" and you can see that this only works when you need
to slow down for the turn anyway.  Risk: if you go too far, you can lose
serious time or even spin.  Picture a skier doing "step turns", sliding 
the rear or his skis around to point him in his new direction.

My wife and I often identify an autocross course by a series of 
"pitches".  We consider that since a carve is simply trying to negotiate 
the turn as smoothly as possible, and usually at full throttle, there's 
not much to remember there.  But the turns that require a "pitch" are the 
ones that determine the winner since they are harder to execute well.

Either carving or pitching can produce maximum g's, at least in theory. 
(Yes, I know, I'm ignoring the possibility of using all four tires equally
well...) Which is better?  A few years ago when the G-Analyst came out there
was an article wherein the author used the G-Analyst to determine max g's
on his RX7 Turbo on a skid-pad at MIS.  When he was satisfied he had it
all, he offered the car to Little Al, who happened to be testing at MIS
that day. Little Al "carved" his way up to the limit, which was later 
confirmed to be substantially the same limit the author had reached.  
Then Al "pitched" the car, and drove around the skid pad under heavy 
throttle with the tail slightly out (maybe 12%??).  The G-Analyst showed 
nearly a 10% increase in G's!

Now my question on ABS.  Several have stated that a great driver can beat 
the ABS in a controlled situation.  I've found that my 914 (no ABS of 
course) would typically only pull about .4 braking g's and rarely go 
beyond .6 when on the autocross course.  (Obviously more is available in 
straights, but autox courses have no straights...)  In my 944 (with ABS) 
I was amazed to find that I'm braking at .8 g's almost as a matter of 
course!  I assumed that this was because in a real world application like 
autocross, you're always pulling some significant lateral g's and the 
non-abs car tends to lock the light tire(s) first, whereupon I modulate 
back, thereby not getting all that I can from the loaded tires.  
Conversely, the ABS car, being 4 channel, permits maximum braking on the 
loaded tire without locking the "light" tire.  If my guess is right, then 
wouldn't it be impossible for a driver to beat the ABS in these 
conditions unless, of course, he had a brake pedal for each wheel and 
four feet?  Or do you learn to live with the flat spots on the "light" 
tire and modulate the loaded tire?

What I'm about to relate isn't a modification to the brake system, but a
modification
to the driver.  

I had my brakes fade big-time at a PCA driver's ed last year.  Eye opening
experience -
can you say "Jesus H. Christ on a popsickle stick"?  This happened relatively
early
in the day, and, not wanting to quit early I went back out (the next time my
run group
was up) and was fine.  I had heard that if your brakes are overheating, the
problem
may be that you are using them *too* much.  I found that if I did all of my
braking
as hard and fast as I could, my brakes were fine (my brakes are totally
stock).
To this day, I accomplish my braking the in this same manner.  As hard as I
can
for as short a time as I can.  I'm going alot faster than I used to and have
had
no fading as a result, so I'm inclined to believe that there may be something
to
the advice.

Any experts care to comment?

Subject: Re: Faster cornering by no skidding?

What an entertaining thread! I had no idea that going fast depended on
understanding terms like: maximum centripetal (opposite to centrifugal)
acceleration; maximum coefficient of static friction; limit of static
friction; and, centrifugal g (a measure of centripetal acceleration in
cornering). I thought I knew slip angle, but am not sure now since much of
the context baffles me.

One thing I do know -- the principles of "cornering fast" in a parking lot
are quite different than on a race track (speed makes a world of
difference). Generalizations about "faster cornering" are not very useful
to people on the list who may be searching for ways to improve their
performance in vastly different environments, some in a parking lot and
others on a race track. For me, the "perfect autocross car" was just plain
dangerous at speed on a race track (the instant oversteer would almost
cause me heart failure in the first fast turn). Conversely, a well-set-up
race car was a pig in a parking lot event (would understeer right off the
first turn). And, I think the driving technique for faster cornering is
likewise different (and in some ways, opposite), because of the differences
of speed allowed by the course.

These theoretical terms of "fast cornering" may make for delightful
discussion, but are not very helpful in practical application. You learn to
drive faster (and in some instances by slower cornering) by instruction,
experience, and by comparing methods at the track with faster drivers who
probably couldn't begin to explain their superior performance with these
terms. They might say, however, "Yup, I pitched it, got back on the gas,
and fed a little opposite lock without scrubbing off too much speed."
That's the language I suggest you learn.

- ---------------------

I did that few months ago on my 76/911S.  I am not sure how differ it is from
a 78. The general procedure is not too bad. You need to jack up the front of
the car and remove the pan which protects against the steering rack, the
swaybars and the brake cylinder.

Also remove the front tires/wheels so that you can drain the brake fluid.
Remove all three small diamenter brass brake lines from the MC. They are left
front, right front, and the rear. Take care not to bend these lines.
Remove the two plastic hoses with brass ends that come down from the top
(from the brake fluid resevior). They are just held down by couple of rubber
grumets. Be prepare to catch any brake fluid left in the system.

Next remove the two bolts that holds the MC against the firewall.

The installation is the reverse of above procedure. :-)

Ahhh, not exactly. The problem for me was putting the two plastic hoses back
in. The new rubber grumets were so tough and the space was so cramp that I
ended up loosen up the other end of the hoses (right at the resevior). I put
the hoses down enough, lubricate the rubber with some brake fluid, heat the
rubber a bit with a heat gun, then insert the plastic hoses in.

Now bolt the MC back against the firewall. You may need another person to
assist you in guiding the brake peddle push rod into the MC from the inside
of the car.

Install the rest of the lines tightly. And don't forget to bleed the entire
brake system (all four corners). You will need at least on big bottle (maybe
equal to 4 little ones) brake fluids to flush the entire system.

These were the steps I went through. I am not sure if your 78/911 is similar
or not, so take it as reference ONLY.

New fuel filter and air filter
Tri tipped Bosch plugs a year ago
Momo 12.6" steering wheel with 1/2 extension (brings it closer to you)

Car looks very sharp and is in excellent shape in and out but is not
perfect. It drives very well and handles excellent due to tires and
suspension mods. It is not harsh at all. I have had a couple of porsche
owners drive it and have had very positive feedback. As you know, it is a
Euro spec enigine which has higher compression ratio, and according to
Bruce Anderson's article about chips (thanks a lot mr Tom Craney for fax)
it can have about 10 more hp than a US model with the same intake/exhaust
and chip mods.

Love to keep car, but ex-wife takes out too much money thx to Ca court system!

Asking price at $19.8k OBO, be brave and make an offer...I can take it!
(I got over $4k of mods in it)

It needs the following:

Gbox as above
O2 sensor
Good home

        I am looking for a 84+ Factory Turbo look Targa, Cab or Coupe in
that order. Most colors considered (not red, love it but cops love it
more!).

Subject: 944 Cam Sprocket Bolt Removal Advice?

Greetings all,

Want to replace the front cam seal (O-ring) on my '83 944 but am having
difficulty removing the internal wrenching bolt holding the cam sprocket on.
  I've tried heating with a propane torch for ~5 minutes followed by electric
impact wrench to no avail but with slight deformation of the bolt head.

Since the bolt is shrouded by the cam sprocket and the thought of stripping
it out makes me very nervous,  it may be that I'm just not being rough enough
with it.  

Anyone have experience with this bolt and know any TRICK? 

Do I need to get it hotter with say an Oxy-Acetylene torch instead of
propane?

Should I go at it with the impact wrench while still hot or wait until cool?

Any response is greatly appreciated.

I need to do this same operation, and after dealing with the cam bolt I
have decided that I will take the cam housing off before I take the cam
sproket off (I have to replace the cam housing gasket anyways since it also
is leaking a bit). I was **very** nervous about applying a lot of force to
the cam sprocket bolt (perhaps my fear of slipping, turning the cam shaft,
and manually mashing my valves into my pistons).

The cam sprocket bolt is very shallow and it seems to be very hard to get
the socket well seated in there while holding the cam sproket still with a
wrench. I think (hope!) this is much easier with the cam housing off of the
motor and on the bench.

Just my $.02 worth. Please correct me if I'm way off base here !!!

Gentlemen

I am looking for a track car, because I can not bring myself to driving my
'88 Targa (that has only 7,000 miles) to drivers ed or pca events.
So, my brother who knows very little about P cars found a car for $4,500 that
he thought might interest me. The car is 2 1/2 hours  from here. I didn't
want to take the trip for nothing, so I asked him to get the vin #. The vin #
is 9115100543. Can anyone tell me anything about this car from this number?
Thank you very much in anticipation of your help.

Subject: 914 wheel decision


Ladies and Gentlemen,

Having looked through the various catalogs at hand, my current decision is
to go with the 7" ATS cast wheels for my 914.  I like the look and feel
comfortable in the knowledge that the company makes/made OE wheels for 
other P-cars.

Automobile Atlanta has them for $300 a piece(includes the ever-so-expensive
lugs and center caps).  Does anyone know of other sources such that I could
compare prices?  Are the ATS wheels a good choice?

Aside:  My 914 is coming along nicely.  Just finished up rewiring the front
end and putting the cleaned up mechanicals in place.  Although heavy, I do
like the style of the late rubber bumper(with the driving lights).  I had
to patch a couple holes in the front pan where the oil cooler was installed.

The next step is to patch a hole under the gas tank and install the heater
control vents, windshield wiper motor, et. al.  Then on to the interior and
the installation of the pristine dash I swiped out of a '73.  

Brad Mayeur should be shipping my rebuilt transaxle at months end; I can't
wait to install my beautifully rebuilt engine. (Thanks for the break-in
information Stan).

Could someone forward me Wurth's number?  I want to order some fuel injection
hose and clamps.  

I couldn't have gotten this far in my P-car endeavors without the support of 
everyone who contributes to this list.

Y'all will be the first to know it when I hit the road this summer!

This was the format for 911 serial numbers in the 70s.  "5" means '75,
"1" means regular 911, which did not exist as a US model.  "2" in
fourth place would be an S, "3" (I think) would be a Carrera.  The
fifth digit is "0" for coupe, "1" for targa, so it's a coupe.  The
last four digits refer to the order of manufacture.

Subject: My trip at Porsche (long)



Hye everyone !


It has been a marvellous holliday week.  Weather was sunny.  Usually at this
season, it's pouring in the east of France and sunny in Texas/Louisiana !

One of the best day of this week was the one a couple of friends, my wife
and I spent in Zuffenhausen (Stuttgart suburbs) in the Porsche factory.

It's easy to find the factory.  If you're coming from the highway (autobahn)
A81, you simply have to follow the direction `Porsche Museum'.  There's a
Porsche logo to help you.

For more precise informations, have a look on tta.com in
/pub/porschephiles/Images/zuff.jpg and in /pub/porschephiles/Images/zuffen.txt .

To park is not so difficult, but take care that there's no room in the factory
for visitors' cars.  But you will find a place to park at less than a 5 minutes
walk.

Last but not least: DO NOT FORGET TO BOOK !  Plan your trip as soon as you can
cause there's only arround 25 visitors a day.  This is not a big figure, but it
allows the guide to answer to everyone's question.  Our guide spoke German,
English and a few words of French.  Those few words helped us.  I wish everyone
to have the same friendly guide we had.

You first can spend half an hour in the Porsche Museum.  It's a small room, but
it contains some great stuff as the Boss' 356.  The tour starts at the Museum
meeting point.

Our visit was shorter than expected because of the coming of the new Boxster
986.  Many places were strictly forbidden to public eyes.

The first thing that you'll notice is the cleaness of the factory !  Ok, I
admit, the factory is mainly composed of assembly lines.  That helps but it's
too help for meeting higher quality.

There's around 4500 people in Zuffenhausen and the actual production per day is
arround 85 993 (over 35% of convertible, this figure includes every kind of 993)
between 1 and 3 928 and no more 968.

We saw first the motor assembly line.  Each worker is able to built an all
motor and they swap every 3 months their job on the line.  BTW, they will not
have any problem to find a job in a private Porsche mecanic garage.

Crankcases, crankshaft, con-rods, exhaust and other stuff come from other
non-Porsches factories.  But every parts is controlled and Porsche is involed
in the design of the production lines of thoses factories.

We were lucky.  We saw some GT2 motors.  Their are huge !  It also means that
Porsche have sold all the homologation dedicated cars and is building others.

Each motor pass a power test.  Every motor is over the required power, but
Porsche don't publish those tests for every motor (it's to prevent the jealousy
of owners).

We didn't saw the motor-testing room because they were testing the first
dozen 986 motors.  The only thing the guide told us was not new: the forth-
coming Mercedes SLK is a kind of sister-ship of the 986 (concerning the chassis
and the breaks).

I forget to mention that Porsche only build on demand.  At this point the
customer (yes, you !) can go to the factory and follow the production of his
very own motor and his very own car.

Then we went to the leather work-shop.  Every thing is built form scratch: they
simply buy tainted leather and cut it, glue it and sew it (this is real
hand-sew stuff) !  This is the place where they built the convertible top and
can repair yours.

We directly went to the final assembly line where motors and assembled with the
rest of cars (the rest of the factory was closed for our eyes due to the 986).

They can assemble on the same line all 993 versions, 928, and Audi RS2 and Mer-
cedes E500 (but nowdays the E500 is fully produced by Mercedes).

At the end of the production, each car have a full 30km road test.  That is why
there's so many Porsche hanging around the factory !

It was really great !


Hope it was not too long to read,

Pierre F-F.

Phyl - you have a real dillema there, your leaky seal will be a 
non-existant seal if you get it much hotter.

my favorite method of undoing stubborn bolts is to use an L piece into a 
socket, and then as many half inch extenders as I can get hold of, its 
amazing how many bolts/nuts will move given a couple of hundred pounds/feet.

Subject: going around corners faster

Theo (sorry for abbrev.)

My understanding is that the important thing is not how fast you go around
the corner, but how quickly you can accelerate out of it.  If the car
is sliding, the direction the car is pointing is several degrees ahead
of it's actual direction of travel.  So....that means compared to the
car that doesn't slide the one that does is pointing down the straight
that follows the curve sooner, which in turn means that car can accelerate
out of the turn exiting faster and pointing in the right direction.

Subject: Re: 944 Cam Sprocket Bolt Removal...

Phil,

I'm not sure heating the bolt is the right thing to do.  I would think that
heating would expand the bolt and make it even tighter.  I removed mine
with the aid of a simple jig to support the end of a crescent wrench
holding the cam shaft so I could use two hands on the wrench on the
infamous cam bolt.  Here is what I did:

1.  Spray penetrating oil on the bolt.

2.  The jig is a foot-long piece of 2x4 with a bolt sticking up at about
the mid point.  The jig is laid fore and aft just to the right (facing
forward) of the cam housing.  The jig slopes downward in the forward
direction and buts against the nose piece.  The crescent (large size)
was placed on the cam shaft and the handle rests on the jig with the
bolt keeping it from sliding downward.

3.  I wrapped a bit of Al foil on the triple square socket as discussed
in a previous posting to get a snug fit in the bolt head.  The triple
square was used with a breaker bar.  One hand supporst the socket end
to keep the socket parallel with the bolt axis and the other hand
applies the torque.

4.  After a couple of good grunts the bolt loosened.

5.  I noticed that some of the coating on the bolt had peeled off.  I
replaced the bolt on reassembly (both because of the peeled coating
and because I wanted to have 'virgin' [see previous postings on
Porsches and s*x...] socket seating area for the next removal.

By the way, a mechanic friend once remarked that since Porsches are
assembled by hand by real people they can be dissembled by had by
real people as well.  This has become a mantra on more than one 
occasion as I struggled with such things as engine mount removal,
cam bolt removal, etc.

Good luck,

Adam,
You do not want anything Blaupunkt!  That Reno in particular has the worst
tuner section god ever created and is just a piece of junk.  By the way I 
have the one I took out of my 944 in perfect working order if you are a 
glutten for punishment.  

If you like a good tuner, buy a Sony.  It is superior to the Alpine, via
testing in the car for 2 months.  I sent the Alpine back but it sounded 
better due to better amps and CD.

If you like a good CD player buy an Alpine.

The best combination is a Sony with a good amplifier.  

Any DIN mount head unit will go right into the existing cut out.

All the removable sheet metal (no jokes, please) on my 914 is powder-coated
- -- rocker panels, front and rear bumpers, front and rear valences, engine
grille, instrument panel, horn "button", engine sheet metal, valve covers,
intake manifold, front and rear suspension, brake splash shields, etc.  The
type of powder is called "Vulcan Black", a semi-gloss black.  It holds up
_very well_ to the elements, and can easily be spiffed up with some
Meguilar's.

Subject: A boy, his 914 and his 1st Pano

 Greetings all,
 
 I just got my first ever issue of Panorama and after looking through it I have 
 mixed feelings which have generated a question.
 
 One of the neat things about this list is that there is a good cross section of 
 all cars here -- and especially lots of people who own, say, a 911 and a 944, 
 and perhaps a 914 for autocrossing.   Accordingly, I had begun to feel part of 
 the Porsche family, me and my 914s, and decided to join PCA and 914OA.  Well, 
 after anxiously waiting for my first Pano, I am a bit disappointed. Sort of 
 reminded me of Excellence, lots of neat articles and ads for 911s, 944s, etc, 
 but almost no 914 content.
 
 I am in no way complaining -- I minored in economics and I understand all that 
 supply/demand stuff, so I know that there would be a natural focus on the cars 
 owned by the most PCA members and also that the ads would definitely be for 
 those cars with the most owners and the most $$$.  But in general, is this 
 latest issue of Panorama representative of all issues with regards to it's low 
 914 content?
 
 I do have to admit, Pano has increased my interest in the other cars and there 
 was an ad for a 914-6 for $7500.  Hmmmmm....
 
 BTW, please don't use this as a kernel for a 914s are inferior/914s rule/my car 
 is better than your car sort of thing -- all 17 year old aol'ers take note ;~)

I went looking for stereos just the other day and ended up with 
Kenwood over the Sony.  I've had a sony stereo system at home for  
yrs and it is still great.  However for the price and features,
the sound of the Kenwood was just as good as the Sony.  Alpine 
seemed much more expensive.  In any case, I settled for a Cassete 
rather than a CD player.  My reason was that I didn't want to have 
half my CD's lying in the car and half at home so I just tape my CD's 
and use the tapes in the car.  This way if I lose a few tapes its no 
big deal, plus in a porsche you'll never get the fidelity that you 
get in a LEXUS.  A porsche is a race car period.

impressive 0-3% figures for a car this age.  Here is my problem, which 
has become predictable but worsening of late.  I'll be as specific as 
possible.  It may be relevent to note that the SC is not my daily 
driver, but I do commute in it 60 miles round trip 3-4 days per week.

In the morning it starts fine and is idling in traffic at the desired 
900 RPM after a couple minutes.  However, once it warms up, there is a 
rhythmic "cough" or hesitation in the idle that varies between about 
750 and the normal 900 RPM.  Other than that, the car runs fine.

Now, at the end of the day, the car will start fine, but for the first 
10 minutes of city driving the slowing or hesitating idle problem 
worsens significantly.  When I depress the clutch, the car's idle will 
drop from 900 RPM to 250-500 RPM --and lately the car has been 
stalling.  This requires that I start the car again, try to keep the 
RPM's high, and hope that it doesn't stall at the next intersection.  
After about 5 minutes of this, for the next 5 minutes the car idles at 
a weak 500 RPM.  Finally, after about 10-15 minutes the car's idle 
warms up to normal levels.  But the repeating hesitation or variance 
from 750-900 RPM continues.

This low idle and stalling phenomenon is frustrating and disconcerting. 
 Any suggestions from the tech experts on this group?  Thanks in advance,

 -Rich

Guys, 
You have this all wrong.  One woman won't do it.  Just as many of you have
several cars for different purposes....  Here's the way I see it.  You need
a combination Polish, Korean, and Italian for sex.  Dumb enough to talk her
into anything, brought up to take a subordinate role in a relationship(keeps
quiet when the triple digits appear on the speedo), Italian for the passion
and fire under the skirt and the hips and legs.  You need a Princeton grad
for the intellectual conversations and fancy dinners.  Then you need to 
train an alternate.  You keep blowing her off until one of the others
blows you off and then bring her up to the major leagues.  They love the 
chase.  When they think they
have got you the sex goes away.

Subject: Belt anchor position

I'm getting around to fininishing the mounting the new 5-point harnessses in
my '84 944.  I'm going to be drilling holes forward of the seat to anchor
the submarine belts.  Are there any significant restrictions or preferences
to these locations?  I can figure out a position based on the comfort and
efficiency of the harness setup but are there any specific car-structure
concerns I should be aware of?  Any places I shouldn't put the bolt, any
places I should put the bolt?  I plan to seal all with silicone to prevent
any rusting etc.  My problem (at this point, I'm sure others will follow,
they always do) at this point is LOCATION.

Subject: Re: Belt anchor position

Actually, the sub belt should go straight down, through the cut out (which
you probably don't have) in the seat. On my recaro SRD there is both a
cutout and a steel cross bar to attach the belt in the seat. On the
passenger side I've used the cross bar which connects the two sides of the
adjusting mechanism on the factory sport seat. This isn't optimal, but
there is already a lot of slop intorduced by routing the belt over the
front of the seat. My instructors don't seem to mind; even the other four
belts are a step up from the narrow 3-pt.

conversation.

Rules To Be A Man (100 ways to keep your Testosterone flowing)

 
1 Don't call, ever.
2 If you don't like a girl, don't tell her. It's more fun to let her figure
it out by herself.
3 Lie.
4 Name your penis. Be sure it is something narcissistic and unoriginal,
such as "spike"
5 If you lose something that belongs to someone else, tell them you 
mailed it to them.
6 Here's a good pickup line, "My girlfiend's pregant, will you go out with
me?
7 Drink Vernors.
8 Play with yourself. Talk about it.
9 Be as ambiguous as possible. If you don't want to answer, a nice grunt
will  do.
10 Always remember: You are a man. Therefore, no matter what, it isn't your
  fault.
11 Lie
12 Girls find it attractive if a man has had more women than baths.
13 Never ask for help.  Even if you really, really need help- don't ask.
People  will think you have no penis.
14 Women like it when you ignore them.  It arouses them.
15 Vanity is the most important trait for a man to have.  Whenever you pass
a  reflective surface, check you hair, clothing, etc.
16 If you don't like a girl, but can't think of a good enough reason why,
just come up with trite, meaningless explanations like, "I don't know. I 
just don't like her personality."
17 If, GOD FORBID, you have to talk to a girl on the phone, use only
  monosyllabic words and noises. Bodily noises are permissible.
18 TWO WORDS:  Hack and spit.
19 Everyone finds a man more attractive if he can write his name in urine.
20 One sure way to make a girl like you is to go after her best friend.
 She will then see what she's missing and love you for not giving up on her.
21 Tell her you will call. Then, refer back to rule #1.
22 Say things like "Wha...?"
23 Don't wear matching clothes. People will think your girlfriend picked it
 out, and it will cramp your style on picking up chicks.
24 Lie.
25 Deny everthing. Everything.
26 Good break up line, "It's not you, it's me."
27 If you like a girl, tell all your female friends about her.  Because if
any of your female friends like you, they'll really want to know.
28 Don't have a clue.
29 If you get a clue, pretend you didn't and disregard it.
30 No means yes.
31 Yes means no.
32 If you don't get sex whenever you want, your balls will shrivel. Enforce
 this rule at all times.
33 If anyone asks, you have had sex in all possible positions and
locations.  Improvise.
34 Much like an orgasm signifies the end of a sexual peak, sex often
signifies the end of a relationship.
35 Feelings?  What feelings?
36 Tell this to your girl before you have sex, "Don't worry.  If you don't
 have an orgasm, you won't get pregnant."
37 Life is one big competition.  If someone is better than you at anything,
either pretend it's not true or kick some ass.
38 Gays?
39 DO NOT make decisions about relationships.  If you are backed into a
corner and must make a decision, stall.  If you still must come up with an
answer, leave yourself a loophole for escape.  Example:
        Question:  "Honey, will you take me out for a romantic dinner?"
        Answer:  "Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce each day."
40 Every sentence that anyone says can be contorted to have sexual meaning.
 Do so.
 41 At any given opportunity, point out how things look like various
genitalia.  If, by chance, you have Play-Doh, make sure you make an exact 
replica of your penis.  Measure to make sure it's right.
42 Lie.
43 "Love" is not in your vocabulary. don't even think about saying it.
44 A general rule: If whatever you're doing does not satisfy you completely
in 5 minutes, it's really not worth it.
45 Diss your girlfirend. Beg and plead until you get her back. Diss her
again.
   Repeat cycle.
46 Lie.
47 ALWAYS apologize. NEVER mean it.
48 If you hurt someone, pretend you care. Don't.
49 Try to have a good memory, but it's OK if you forget trivial things. You
   know, like your girlfriend's b-day and eye color.
50 Ignorance solves problems. If you can't see them, they can't see you.
51 It is never your duty to take responsibility for your actions.
52 Create new words and phrases to describe genetalia, sex, semen, etc.
53 Complain about not getting any mail.  When people FINALLY feel sorry for
you and send you mail, ignore it and continue complaining.
54 Lie.
55 Play with your food only if you are in a public place with people you
don't know.
56 Play with your penis only if you are in a public place with people you
don't know.
57 If people express extreme disgust at whatever you are doing, DON'T STOP!
   This is the desired reaction.
58 You are NOT a virgin.  Ever.  Males are born without virginity.
59 You are male, therefore you are superior.
60 Agenda for a boring evening:  Get beer.  Drink beer.  Play with
yourself. Have sex.  Drink more beer.  Pass out.
61 Females do not care what you do to them as long as they get to please
you.
62 Don't ever notice anything.
63 If you're going out with someone but you love someone else, don't say
   anything.  Wait until the girl you are going out with falls in love with
   YOU, and then tell her.
64 Basic fundamental rule of dating: Quantity, not quality.
65 Basic fundamental rule of sex: Quantity IS quality.
66 Lie.
67 If you cheat on a girl, but no one finds out, then technically you've
done nothing wrong.
68 Crying is not manly. Then again, if you are a man, what do you have to
cry about, anyway?
69 If the question begins with "why," the answer is "I don't know."
70 Women are your napkins. Use them, and throw them away.
71 Remember, Every virgin girl is saving herself for YOU.
72 If you ever find yourself in a position where you have been proven
wrong, blame others.  Come up with creative and believable excuses why they are
at fault- not you.
73 Don't ever let anyone say "I told you so."  If you hear this phrase and
it didn't come out of your mouth, go ballistic.
74 If your woman makes you go shopping with her, drive around until a
parking spot right near the door opens up.  If this takes hours, so be it. You
will have the coveted "door spot" and others will worship your skills.
75 Keep track of how many seconds in your life you have thought about sex.
 Compare with others.
76 Other peoples' pain is strictly for your amusement.  Laugh long and
loud.
77 Lie.
78 General Rule:  Different is BAD.
79 If anyone asks you for a favor-  a) make a big deal about how hard it is
   for you to do it,  b) remind them of this huge favor you've done for them
   at least every 5 minutes for the rest of their life.
80 Each penny you save will be worth at least a dollar in the long run.
81 If you do something really mean to a girl, and she doesn't want to 
talk to you, pretend nothing happened. If she still doesn't talk to you,
casuall ask, "is something wrong?"
82 Three words: Let's be friends. Translation: I never want to speak to you
   again, but it's bad for my nice-guy image if you are mad at me, so I'll
   pretend I want to be your friend.
83 Lie.
84 If you're on a date, and there is a lull in the conversation, tell the
gir how many different dorms you've been laid in.
85 When you tell a girl about your past, it's good to say, "God, I was such
a pimp back then."
86 Here's a good trick. Tell a girl that you're going to leave and when you
   come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed.  Leave,and go into
her dad's room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive
like hell. (true story.)
87 If a girl breaks up with you because you're in love with someone else,
she has no right to be upset. Because, you know, SHE's the one who wanted to
end the relationship.
88 The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty girls on top.
89 Practice your blank stare.
90 Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass.
Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass.
91 If you ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage
and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times.  You
won't be asked to do it again.
92 If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON'T want to do, first try
your manly best to get out of it.  If that doesn't work, go ahead and do what
you were asked to do, but complain that you don't know how to do it and
 continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one
rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you
possibly can and then say, "SEE??  I TOLD you I couldn't do it." Eventually,
people will stop asking you to do things.
93 Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it
already is.  When people ask if you've been working out, say things like, "No,
Baby, I was BORN like this!"
94 Do not listen to "pussy music" such as Erasure, Color Me Badd, or
Oldies.
95 Beer.  Then more beer.
96 Scratch your balls.  See if you can embarrass people.
97 One word:  FOOTBALL!
98 Real men beat up others who are inferior.  I mean, we don't want the
  inferior of the species to get to reproduce ever, do we???
99 Diss your girl friends for an occasional night or 5 out with "The Gang".
100  LIE.

My favorite method is to pop a universal fitting and the appropriate socket

are so satisfying.

"loosen" and "tighten".  I was using it to remove the steering rack cover

Subject: Re: 911SC- Pedal bushings


[Text item: Text_1]
     I just changed these bushings last night on my 73 911.  Really not 
     rocket science, but there are quite a few parts.  I recommend getting 
     an exploded-view drawing of the assembly- I used the parts manual, 
     which worked fine.  
     
     The basic steps are: 
     
     1. Remove the brake master cylinder nuts (the pedal assembly has the 
     studs that hold the m/c).  You obviously need to get under the car for 
     this step.
     
     2. remove the board around the pedals and remove the accelerator pedal
     
     3. disconnect the accelerator and clutch cable linkages (one is a ball 
     socket, one is a fitting like the removable top of Bic pen)
     
     4. remove and re-bush the pedal assembly, and reinstall.
     
     I bought the individual parts from a dealer, although the shop I 
     normally use indicated that the available kits are fine.  My mechanic 
     asked 'did you get the plastic bushings?'  I replied that I had and he 
     said 'good'.  I didn't pursue the topic, but obviously there is some 
     disagreement on what's better.
     
     BTW, remember to spread bushing lube liberally on each set of 
     bushings.  Should keep the squeaks down for many years.  Hope this 
     helps, and hope I did it right!

Hmmm...my Blaupunkt CD works great as a tuner and as a CD player. The CD
has skipped *once* in 40K miles of driving, including the streets of D.C.

Compare the receiver sensitivity and separation specs with some of the
others. You'll find it as good or better than all but one of the popular
Japanese models.

True, the Reno tuner was junk but I gave the thing away and it's still
working.

Don't discount all Blaupunkt units just because the Reno tuner is a poor
one by today's standards. The new units are very good and IMO the styling
is a great match for the Porsche.

Standard disclaimer applies. I don't work for Blaupunkt, I just love mine.

It certainly can be done.  The question, of course, is how much will it cost?

I wouldn't know the costs for converson but now of one gentleman in
Austrialia who is going to just what you describe on several 911's.  There
may be added complexities and costs for the 928 since the prime mover is in
the front.

You probably would have to buy the parts second hand to make it work
financially, that's a pretty safe bet.  But even then, you will need to crank
the numbers to see if it will really work.  The devil is in the details.

I did the pedal bushings on a 73 about 4 mo ago. We opted to go with the

and you have a master cyc leak, you will know it. Probably be replacing 
booth! Then you won't feel it with the bronze bushings, and you won't

the OEM bushings start to bind when they heat up, do when the car I did was

This is a relative question. The job in it's self is not a hard one to 
accomplish. You take the whole pedal assembly out of the car. On the one
I did, I seem to remember banging with a hammer (no press available) for
quite a while. After it was dissasembeled, reassembly was a snap. Also we
soaked the bronze bushings in oil overnight. 

Would I do it again? You bet! It's your car and you will find (at least I 
do) great satisfaction in compleating this type of repair yourself. You will
also renew your satisfaction of the enginering necessary to build a vehicle
of it's class.

Ehab,
You may remember that I owned a factory turbo-look 88 targa for several
years.  Beautiful car in diamond blue (lavender/silver) in near perfect
condition, in spite of the 120k miles it had.  Original clutch, engine,
paint, interior, etc.  12 disk CD, polished wheels, painted crests.  Great 
car.

A couple of things to keep in mind:
1 - These cars are heavier than non T-looks.  My wife's 89 coupe was a bit
faster (acceleration and high speed).  Aerodynamics are not as good (though
it was very stable at speed because of the wheels/tires, spoilers, etc.).
2 - The T-look option was $13.7k extra!  I advertised for a few weeks at
$28k.  Had very few nibbles.  One guy bit, and we settled at $26.5k.  I
figure the T-look added about $4k to the price.  You shouldn't pay more.
3 - Obviously these are harder to find.  Although the targa is rarer, I don't
like it as much.  Usual targa problems with noise and maintenance.  Nothing
beats a coupe for rigidity and a solid feel.  And this should be a high
priority for a T-look.
4 - The early factory T-looks (84 and 85, I believe -- check Bruce's
Performance Handbook) had welded on flares.  Porsche didn't make one piece
flares until 86.  Don't know if this matters to you (it probably shouldn't). 
I don't know if the pre-86's had smaller sway bars, like the regular
Carreras.  You might check this out.  I found the difference significant,
comparing my 84 to my wife's 89.
5 - The best thing about the T-look, short of its outrageous appearance, are
the brakes.  Only the 993 can compare.  Expect some squeal, maybe a lot (I
was lucky but I hear it is very common with drilled rotors).
6 - Do not settle for a conversion.  These usually have no more than flares
and miss out on the brakes and suspension upgrades.  They're also frequently
damaged (making the conversion a good option).  Conversions should sell for
less than a stock 911.  Stating the obvious, I guess.
7 - They don't have turbo tie-rods.  Strange.  Porsche must have saved about
$20.  I'd put them on if you're not concerned about SCCA class.

There are a couple advertised in today's San Jose paper.  One looks very
good.

*love* women!  They are my very *favorite* other gender!  Nothing, (watch my

Divorce?  BTDT.  I got engaged to my first wife as a junior in High School,

9 months later.   Went to Dear old Deutschland, (Verliebt, Verlopt, Verheiratet,

married and divorced 9 months later.  (Is there an echo in here...?)

My conclusion, upon reviewing this stuff at the tender age of 24 with two
divorces under my belt, was that I had a bug in my judgement algorithm,
not that there was anything wrong with ladies as a species, so I vowed to stay
single for the next 10 years to see if that would help.  Hoo boy!  Talk

Thank you Soren....I did not know that this all mattered so much to you!!
I do believe that you understood what was intended to be said based on
the context.

Back in my younger, less wise, days I used to let things like this bother
me as well. Then I realized all that mattered was that I understood what
was being communicated. As long as this goal is reached I am content.
Of course, if this was intended as some professional form of communication
I would proof my writing a little more closely.

I will endeavor to spell every word correctly from this point on.
However, I pity you should you misspell or misuse a word; someone will
catch it and make you aware of it!

Or is this your way of getting back at me for blowing your doors off

Subject: Chocking on Gas Vapors in my 944

After two trips to the dealer, and my mechanic, my '84 944 is trying to kill
me.

I have had all of the fuel lines checked for leaks, and I still get an
overwhealming gas odor in the cabin of my car.  The problem usually occurs
after refueling the car.  As the temperature of the gas changes (problem
seems to go away when the weather cools, now that it's spring....), and the
fuel system is charged, I get some real positive air presure in the tank
(removing the gas cap creates a strong "woosh" of air).  On the occassion
that the odor appears after refueling, it will stay until the tank is about
1/2 empty.  I'm trying not to end up as a speeding molitov (sp??) cocktail.

Any thoughts?

critical- if you scrub off excessive amounts of speed in sliding round a
corner you  will likely have a speed deficit versus another car that you
cannot overcome by earlier acceleration; ie by being at a point that you can
feed in power, say,  0.3  of a second sooner, but 15mph slower,  may do you
no good if you cannot make up the 15mph in 0.3 seconds. obviously there is a

       I was indulging my fantasies over lunch today, I printed out the
price list and options for a new 911 ('95).  The leather options just kept
coming out, to the point of silliness ("leather glove box lock rosette
"$67INVOICE / $83MSRP". If one gets a 911 with ALL the leather options how
much weight does it add to the car?) Two things really caught my interest.
(I'm not in the market for a NEW one, but someone buying new now is
hopefully picking the options I'm going to get when I buy "pre-owned," so I
should understand what those options are!)

1) AERO KIT I - SPOILER W/FRONT DUCT $3910/$4880
    AERO KIT II - SPOILERS/ROCKERS  $4682/$5843

Are these performance options or simply for appearances?  Just glancing at
Pano suggests that OEM stuff is just a trifle over priced!

2) REAR STORAGE COMPARTMENT IN PLACE OF REAR SEATS   $525/$656

I've never seen this option and I suppose it would be obvious.  Anyone care
to describe it?

Obviously, you haven't found all of the fuel lines.

Have you checked the lines in the c pillar of the passenger side???

Have you replaced the gasket in the fuel gauge sender?

Have you pressurized the system (via compressed air) and listened for air
leaks?

If not, make an effort to do so.  I hate to buy cars that have been burned

You should get a whoosh from your tank -the fuel system is pressurised. 

Your problem may be the overflow pipe that runs from the filler neck. It is
directed  down into the cavity behind the right rear wheel arch and out
through the bottom of the bodywork. If that tube is missing, damaged or
dislodged, you could be pouring gas into the cavity. check it out, carefully
pour some liquid down the overflow  hole and trace where it comes out.

Now being as I rather like the car and I don't want to rebuild the front end in

strenghtens the unibody. You will want to move a little bit to the side
to avoid this.

Subject: I'm off to Germany!

 Greetings all,
 
 Not a whole lot of Porsche content, but...
 
 I just received a tentative job offer from the Fraunhofer Institute for 
 Chemical Technology in Karlsruhe, Germany (about 80km west of Stuttgart)!  I've 
 been working an exchange scientist assignment with the US Air Force and the job 
 offer is the biggest of hurdles to leap -- hopefully everything else will go as 
 well....
 
 Unfortunately I would not get there for another year, but anytime is better 
 than never -- maybe my 914 will be fixed by then!
 
 BTW, does anyone have any comments regarding US spec cars driven in Germany?  I 
 don't want to modify it too much  or have the car rust away, but I think it 
 would like to take a trip back to its hometown (yeah...I know... Wolfsburg.... 
 but some of the parts were made perhaps in Zuffenhausen)

Isn't this like what they had in the Club Sport or some such, kind of like

Subject: How much rust is too much?

I know that any rust on a 911 is bad, but I've had some trouble finding
cars that are COMPLETELY rust free.  So, I'd like to know the hierarchy
of rust damage.  I'd guess it to be something like (on an invented scale 
from 100 to -100):

	No Rust                                      100 pts
	A little under the doors (drain holes)        50 pts
	Edges of doors, hood, trunk, fuel filler      40 pts
	Some rust showing around the windshield       30 pts
	A bubble on one or more fenders               20 pts

	A bubble around the headlights                 0 pts

	Rust around the battery box(es)              -10 pts
	Rust under floor mats (interior or trunk)    -25 pts
	Jack Receiver, tortion bar tubes             -50 pts
	Pan                                          -75 pts
	Suspension pickups                          -100 pts

Any key areas that I forgot?  What does it cost to repair rust damage
like the things listed above?  

FWIW, I put some things lower because, for example, doors are easier to
replace than fenders and that rust around the jack receiver implies
structural rust.

Thanks!

are very good in the wet, but their dry traction seems to be lacking.  I took

I say, `you bet'!

Though it'll probably affect MB prices more than Porsche, because the
typical Porsche buyer is not the typical Lexus/Infiniti/Acura one.

If the Japanese luxo's double in price, NOBODY is going to buy them!
These people will shop elsewhere: MB, BMW, Volvo, and Saab are
probably going to be the main winners.

And of course, whenever new cars get more expensive, the corresponding
used ones also.

If you thought of trading in your x-year old whatever for a new MB,
say, but now it's more expensive, you'll postpone that trade-in (many
people will). As a result, there is one less used car in the market
for me to buy. So, less supply, (and more demand, because others who
may have planned on buying a new car, won't be able to afford one, and
might go for a used one), yields higher prices.

So, if you are in the market, and you believe that tariffs will be
imposed, go for it now (though an Infiniti dealer in today's Boston
Globe said ``this isn't the right way to sell a high end automobile''
but since I'm not selling any, .....)

Subject: 944/924 stereo setups


Since we're on the subject of CD players for 944s, I was curious to know
what types of stereo setups have worked well in 944/924s.  If people send
me enough responses, I'll provide a summary.

In my 84 944, I put in a Sony EXCD-60 CD player, Polk MM series 4x6 plates
in the front doors, Polk EX series 4x6 drivers in the rear side panels,
and a 10" Blau subwoofer in a vented bandpass enclosure sitting in the
hatch. A Blau amp with 20w x 4 plus one 50w sub output drives the system.

The midbass is lacking because the Polks only go down to about 120hz, but
they sound great otherwise.  I did have to snip away parts of the plastic
mounting plate to install them in the front and I couldn't get the stock
grilles to cover them.  I'm still looking for something to cover them up.
I found that the sub works best when the port is firing at the driver's 
side wall about 6" away from it; in any other position there's virtually 
no bass output.

My car a turbo/s has 928 front brakes with 4 pistons. there are two different

that the rear calipers use 36mm pistons all around as do the front calipers
on all other 944 turbo's except for the 88 S model and of course the 89's.
Boy if you could buy these without having to buy the whole kit you could

Subject: of Amps, tweeters, Subwoofers and 911s

Hi Everyone from the new home of the America's Cup!

I've just finished putting my stereo equipment in my new (to me) 1981 911SC
Targa. Alpine QRB CD player in the dash, 6" speakers in the doors and amp
under the passenger's seat (the alarm is under driver's seat).  It sounds
OK, but that's not really good enough.

The amp is just resting there at the moment but I want to mount it more
securely.  Can I drill some holes in the floorpan under the passenger seat,
or will I damage something important if I do?  Alternatively, is there a
less drastic way which will work just as well.

The sound has good mid range and bass from the 2-way Alpine speakers
(reference series 6663s for those of you to whom that means something).  I
want to put some tweeters on the dash.  Any recommendations for some that
will work well and match the 6" speakers and amp (an Alpine 3521, 50watts
RMS)?  Should I bother with a passive crossover (at extra expense) to
control the frequencies to both the tweeters and the 6" speakers, or should
I just use some resistors to filter low frequencies from the tweeters?  Is
the sound quality difference noticable?

Finally, it strikes me that the passenger's footwell (behind the wood kick
board at the front) would be an ideal place for a subwoofer (when I decide
to do this).  ANy comments.

TIA.

(ps. see you all in New Zealand for the Cup defence in 1999!)

Subject: 944 Gas Fumes

The '84 944 has a fuel overflow drain at the bottom of the gas filler
pocket, just below the filler opening.  Fuel overflow is drained to the
ground by a tube which seats into the bottom of the pocket with a grommet.
It's easy to dislodge the grommet when you're drying the car.  This lets
any fuel overflow enter the interior of the car.  It stinks for a while,
then evaporates.

The fix is to replace the grommet.  This can be done by removing the
plastic vent grille in the lock post and using a coathanger (or whatever),
manipulating the tube/grommet until you can snag it from above and pull it
back where it belongs.  Not easy, but do-able.

If this is too much for you, simply plug the hole with something and be
careful not to dribble fuel when you gas up.

Well, I usually don't flame, because I've found that if you argue with an
idiot, you may as well be looking in a mirror, but I just had to let go a
little on this one....

Crawl out from under your rock, and look around a little before flaming
someone about the years cars were made or not made!

As a metter of fact, the 924S was made in 87 and 88, essentially it was the
944 suspension, drivetrain and engine, with a 924 body.

So why don't you apologize to Mr. Midkiff, and we'll consider this issue closed.

Ouch! I just got a freebie rebuilt Reno from work (the Porsche dealership), that we

inventory for years. Still works fine. Considering that Porsche gets $380 for them, 
I figured I did great!

I have a lesser Blaupunkt in the 914 now and was considering putting the Reno in 
there and putting the first one into the Sundance that I'll be purchasing soon 
(parents gonna buy a new car, and it doesn't have a tape deck), but I may keep the 
one where it is - the old one (don't remember the name) has the four-digit coding 
protection, plus the flashing light when it's off. It's theoretically good for 
theft protection, though everyone always says "hey, there's a light blinking on

>Anyone think the lockout of Japanese luxo cars will affect Porsche or Mercedes 
>prices. (New or used) ??

Well, speaking as the employee of a Porsche/Mercedes/BMW/Audi/Rover dealership (parts 
dep't), we were discussing it a little today...

First off, there is no lockout. There IS a "proposed" 100% tariff on thirteen 
Japanese luxury cars - no more, no less. Obviously, that means double the prices. 
>From what I've heard around the grapevine (we have affiliated Acura, Honda, and Mazda 
dealerships), sales of Acuras have been very brisk since the news story, and I'd 
assume it's the same for the other dealerships.

Infiniti is hurting bad anyways - they air-freight all parts for all customers, which 
is not cheap. They had Infiniti loaners - which means that they have old loaners with 
10-15K miles on 'em that are difficult to sell. They have nice cars, but somehow 
they've never caught on. (I've always like Infiniti more than Lexus - probably 
because I have an irrational dislike of Toyota.)

It probably would mean destruction for Infiniti, possibly for Lexus, and maybe even 
for Acura. However, it'd probably be GREAT for dealerships like ours - why buy an 
enormously expensive Japanese sedan, when you can buy a quality German sedan or coupe 
(the "real thing") for much less? I don't have numbers to back it up, but I'm going 
to guess that a Mercedes customer is going to be a lot more loyal than an Acura 
customer. Few people say "only an Acura will do!"

I doubt it'll affect Porsche at all - I don't think it'll affect anyone else's 
pricing, but it's certainly potentially good news for German cars.

Frankly, I'd be stunned if it ever went through, though - I'm sure it's just a scare 
to try to get Japan to "play ball", and if they do tariff them, it'll be a LOT less 
than 100%. Time will tell...

This posting has been handled ably by a couple others, but I want to comment
anyway.

As someone that used to sell auto parts over the counter, one touchy situation
was when a customer wanted to sell the store a NOS spare part they had
lying around.

Invariably, the customer paid retail, bought it a long time ago, and had no 
receipt or bought it from a competitor.

They didn't seem to appreciate that the retailer, if he WANTS the part at all,
will certainly pay no more than wholesale for the part.

And wholesale is probably considerably less than the customer paid, if the 
business is being run for profit.

In fact, there is no reason to pay wholesale price to an "off the street
supplier" since industry wholesalers will usually accept returned parts, honor 
warrantees, provide credit and possibly give quantity discounts for larger 
orders. 

So, a "business" reasonable offering price might be customer viewed as 
"insulting".

So as a rule, the store I worked in NEVER bought NOS/used parts from a customer.

It wasn't worth the trouble and possible customer bad will.

But, at the right price, the transaction MIGHT have left both customer and 
store better off.

Businesses dealing in used parts are operating under the same constraints,
except they also will usually buy parts, AT WHOLESALE, from retail customers.

I'd guess that Robert Wood's offer of $125 for your wheel is what he
has learned over the years is a reasonable, for him, wholesale price.

Someone else might pay more, but this price attracts an adequate inventory for
him.

It's nothing personal, and judging from the years Wood has been in business,
he makes sound pricing decisions at both the wholesale and retail end.

I've bought wheels from him and had no complaints.

>p.s. I was quoted 2 different prices for BOTH wheels on 2 different calling 
>occassions.

This is not unexpected.  

There is no "correct" or "fair" price, only an estimated current market price.

Subject: Antennas


Since there's a discussion of the Reno stereo, here's a question on 
antennas.  MY automatic antenna is stuck part way up.  Works ok, but 
would like to replace it with one that retracts fully.  Question:

Does anyone have any experience with the Imparts "Harada" antenna which 
the ad seems to indicate is the Hirschmann sans label/middleman?  Does it 
work?  Is it an easy replacement?  If so, then the $49 is a WHOLE LOT 
cheaper than the $349 I see the Hirschmann advertised for elsewhere.  
What concerns me is they advertise the Hirschmann for only $86.  So - 
anyone know about these apparent deals?  What's the catch?

Yea, it's easy.

	If your sunroof is lifting up and down the motor is OK. Your 
problem is the microswitch back at the motor cam. Check to see if it's 
closed when the sunroof is closed, if the switch is open you'll have 
to adjust it until it closes. Then the sunroof lifters will retract so 
you can remove the sunroof. Warning, if your slip clutch on the 
sunroof motor is not adjusted to SLIP, the motor is strong enough to 
break the plastic teeth right off the gear lifters at the lifting 
bars. A couple hundred $ -no way- do it your self. I realize the older 
944's have a different set-up back at the motor, but I saved myself 
$250 -dealer quote, almost enough to pay for my factory manuals!!!

I have installed Imparts Harada antennas in both my '81 911SCs with 
no problem. However, an owner of a car stereo store once mentioned
to me that the factory antenna was superior because the factory
antenna had a waterproof body while the Harada was not as waterproof.  
However, I have had no problem with my Harada antennas yet.

In addition, I found the Harada antenna to have a smaller body than the 
factory antenna.

Paint is easy, tires are harder...

Use the Wurth silver lacquer, or there's some Corvette paint from a
recent vintage that also works well. I also have with some success used
powder coating, although not on 356s.

For the concours  tire look, there is always the "new" CN36s that you
can get from Eurotire in NJ. They're built on P6 carcasses, so they're
not completely the same as the old tires....

For better street performance, I dunno... I'm looking hard at AVS Intermediates
for my next set of tires (which I need now thanks to a failed front trailing
arm bushing). The A-509s are also attractive, as are AVS U+4s.

You get the subscription automatically when you join the Porsche Club of

Yes, Paul I too have had this problem.  In a nutshell, the sunroof is 
operated by a motor over the driver side rear wheel.  A flexible cable 
runs to two small boxes in the roof of the car.  These boxes each have 
a plastic gear that translates motion of the cable to motion of the 
curved "prongs" that raise the roof.

It is very common for these plastic gears to strip.  Most Porsche 
parts places keep a healthy supply of those gears (thanks to their 
demand).

I will let someone else describe the repair procedure.  Yes, I did fix 
mine when they broke, but there has to be an easier way than the way I 
did it or the way the shop manual suggests that it be done.  If you 
really want, contact me directly and I will attempt a description of 
my procedure.

the 944 underpinnings, including drivetrain, in a body more aerodynamic than
the the 944.  It came standard with a nice group of equipment including
sunroof, a/c, power windows, etc.  It proved to be slightly faster than the
944 because it was lighter and more aerodynamic.

I was really interested in comments from this group regarding overall
reliability and things to watch for.  Since then I have received the 924/944
FAQ which proved to be very informative.  Thanks for all the quick replies.

I wouldn't consider the $36/year membership expensive at all.
Especially after you consider what you get for it.  The membership
cost pays for more than just Pano.  A significant portion (can't

Subject: 911 vs. 914 tie rods

Pedal-philes,

What're the benefits of putting in 911 instead of 914 tie rods?

The existing rods on my 73 914 have been crushed/rusted to the point where they 
cannot be adjusted.  Thankfully, my pop has been replacing every damn piece (it 
seems) of his 914 autox machine, so I've been inheriting parts off that and his 
(now traded for a 930) 911SC.  He's mailed me two sets of tie rods (new MasterC 
in the mail too!).  If both sets are in good shape, I'll probably put in the 
911's this weekend and finally get rid of the obnoxious squeal up front (which 
I can now hear after fixing up the heretofore unconnected exhaust system!).

TIA, (and if there's something on this in the FAQ, forgive my use of bandwith 
and lack of a real-time connection to WWW).

Subject:  914 Distributor & Electrical question 

I have 2 questions regarding my stock 1974 914 1.8L as I am reassembling it
after rustoration:

1) First of all when installing my distributor gear/shaft the Haynes manual
   says that some engine models have a spacing washer, but doesn't say which
   ones or how to tell.  I don't remember seeing one when disassembling the
   engine, but I could've missed it if it fell.  Is there anyway to tell?


2) What is the wiring for the relays under the passenger seat?  The previous
   owner had ripped out various parts to defeat the seatbelt warning mechanism.
   I wanted to re-connect everything up, but I am unclear on some wiring.
   Beneath is a crude ascii drawing of what remained.  Could someone please
   fill in the ?s and/or correct any errors.

Funny you should ask about the A-509. Seem to work quite well, wet or dry. One
nice point, they ride better than the AVS over expansion joints. 

Anyway, I am using 205/55 VR 16 on my 924 and they have excellent grip. The 
market the tires are intended for is a notch below gonzo street. SO these work 
as intended for non-track and autocross tires. I have maybe 2500 miles on them,

Subject: marelli distributor on 71 T

   I have a 71T with a marelli distributor. One of the centrifigal advance
weights is held close to the distributor shaft by its spring. I assume this
weight is responsible for advancing the spark at higher rpms. The other
weight, however, isn't held back by the spring until it spins fairly far out
from the shaft. The spring is loose against the weight and exerts no
pressure until the weight has spun out a ways. Is this normal?  It seems
strange to me that one of the weights in the distributor is spinning loose.

In response to the below question:

        I bought the "Harada imitation Hirschman" from Imparts last year.
Upon receipt, I peeled off the Harada sticker, and it said something else,
made in Korea underneath the Harada sticker :(  Turns out it's an imimtation
Harada!  So I go to install it anyway.  It doesn't work.  I tried it with
clip leads to the battery and it still didn't work.  So I returned it to
Imparts for a refund, no questions asked (I've always had good service from
Imparts).

        I bought a Hirschman at a local shop, and it works great.  The relay
in the fender is identical.  It was easier to use the old relay with the new
antenna, so I have a spare relay.

        Having done this, I ripped apart (disassembled) the old Hirschman.
I was able to clean it up (terrible crud inside) and now it works also (a
spare).

        All Hirschmanns are not equal.  M-Bs have the top-of-the-line
Hirschmann, which is much nicer (and heavier) than the one from the Porsche.
BTW, I found no Japanese, Korean, Chineese, Malaysian, Taiwanese,
Yugoslavian, Mongolian, or whatever markings on any of the Hirschmanns.

Since there's a discussion of the Reno stereo, here's a question on 
antennas.  MY automatic antenna is stuck part way up.  Works ok, but 
would like to replace it with one that retracts fully.  Question:

Does anyone have any experience with the Imparts "Harada" antenna which 
the ad seems to indicate is the Hirschmann sans label/middleman?  Does it 
work?  Is it an easy replacement?  If so, then the $49 is a WHOLE LOT 
cheaper than the $349 I see the Hirschmann advertised for elsewhere.  
What concerns me is they advertise the Hirschmann for only $86.  So - 
anyone know about these apparent deals?  What's the catch?

Thanks!

Consider the following:

1. The 914 has been out of production for nearly 20 years.
2. The 914 was not heavily campaigned as a race car by the factory.
3. The 914 does not have many "special" cars associated with it.

Due to these facts, there is not going to be as much content as you will
find for models currently in production or famous race cars. Nor are there
a lot of historically significant versions of the 914.

Sure, there is the 914-6 GT that did quite well at Le Mans one year. Yes,
there are a few 916's and two 914-8's. But this about it.

The 914 is special for many other reasons but none of these reasons make
for great articles. Unless of course they're articles that discuss how
to make them great autocross or time trial cars. Often faster than their
911 counterparts for a lot less money.

While driven the other night in my 84 944 it started making a whipping
sound when the cluch was enaged.  Disenage it and the sound stops.
After a few minutes it stop.  Anyone know that would have cause this?

Many of the 356Cs were delivered with Dunlop SPCB57s, a fabric-belted radial
(and a great tire) that is no longer available.  I have found the Dunlop SP4
to be close in appearance and a reasonable approximation of the CB57's
handling characteristics.  The correct size is 165-15 (if memory serves me
correctly, that's a 75 or 80 aspect ratio).

If correct appearance is important to you, stick to 165-15s.  If improved
performance is more important, look at tires with lower aspect ratios
(they'll be of more modern design).

BTW, this is one of the few instances in Porschedom where being correct is
less expensive than being incorrect!

        To Tim (T.J.) Murphy:  My mail to you bounces.  Sorry for the
bandwidth, everyone else.

        Tim:  I would suggest you leave the seatbelt warning mechanism
disconnected.  Not only is the buzzer annoying, but the system will not
let you start the car without the seatbelts fastened!  Talk about annoy-
ing!
        I also suggest you check the Haynes book, p. 174.  This is a
wiring diagram for the 1974 US-spec cars.  It is actually incorrect for
both of my 74's as well as yours--it indicates a warning relay with in-
tegrated buzzer, and no external buzzer.  Ours have that.  The buzzer
fits in the smaller socket on the right.  So we start guessing.  Also
check the 73 diagram on p. 164.
        The socket, or at least the relay itself, should have raised/
printed numbers & letters on it.  These numbers/letters correspond to
the labels on the connections on the diagram.

        There are two YW/WH wires listed on the diagram.  They go to and
from the right seat belt switch.  (Like the GR/WH wires go to the left
seat belt switch.)  Should be a 2-connector, I think.  One of the wires
is hooked to the relay socket at the same place as the yellow wire that
comes from the right seat pressure switch.  This should be labeled "SB".
The other one should be labeled "GB".

> - black & black/red twisted together (connector cut off)

        The BK and BK/RD wires connect together at the socket.  The BK/
RD wire goes to the interior light, the black one to the clock in the
console, if you have any.  The connector should be labeled "30".

> - 2*brown/yellow (small connector)

        One of the BR/YW lines goes to the parking brake switch.  The
other goes to the brake warning switch and the warning light.  These
two wires are directly connected to each other at the relay socket, so
so it doesn't matter which goes where.  (I think.)  Label should be "A".


        I don't think I want to speculate what goes on the unknown tabs.
I can guess that the black wire at #4 goes eventually to fuse 9, but if
I'm wrong, you could fry your relay or worse.
        If you can't puzzle out what's happening from this and the Haynes
diagram, I'll try ckecking through the spaghetti under my 1.8's seat--
but it may not help much, as the interlock/etc. has been disabled on it
as well.

        Good luck!

Subject: Alternator Light


Peter,

Porsche alternators have a failure mode where one diode goes bad, thereby
lowering the true output potential below the minimum requred for adequate
charging. Do have your battery checked to ensure that all cells are good and 
the specific gravity of the electrolyte is correct.

The one diode drops the voltage enough so the battery discharges, but is not 
catestrophic enough to make the light come on at full intensity.

I had one fail on my '73 911S when the car was only 6 months old.

Guys, 

We have some items in the works for 914s. I have an article or two in

not my decision. Excellence DOES recognize the 914 as an important part of 
the Porsche model lineup.

Write the editor and tell him what you want to see. We have been able to answer a lot of questions on the 924/944/968, the 914 and 914/6 can also have the 
same treatment.

Jim,

What I'm still waiting for are the articles on the interchangability
between the 914 and the 924/944/968 series.  Specifically, can I fit
the suspension and brakes from a 944 (possibly with the M030) to an
early 914?  Is it possible to swap over the ABS system to the stock
914 brakes from, say, an S2?  And, is it possible to replace the 
water cooled 4 in the 944 with a six out of a 911 (similar to the
914-6 conversion) to boost horsepower and eliminate the risk of
intermix problems (and where is a good place to mount the oil tank)?

Jim,

Will this problem show up if I had the alt tested? I had the alt tested this
winter when I had the motor out of the car and the shop cliamed that there
was nothing wrong with it. The light does not come on strong, like you say,
however, it increases in brightness as the RPM's increase.....

Can a person just purchase diodes to correct this problem or do they have to
have the alt rebuilt?

As you can tell, I know nothing about alternators......

I guarantee that Porsche prices will not be affected, and will bet that

selling cars. Remember the "truck" surcharge - then all Japanese trucks

I would think that in good faith, if Clinton were to impose this tarif to 'open

Subject: 911 lid shocks

Last night I installed new lid shocks, front and back, in my 73.  I'm used to
having to do this every couple of years but it's always an adventure.  The
front driver's side is where the excitement lies, unless you're fingers are
10 penny skinny and hot dog long.

The engine lid strut seems to be too strong.  Not only does the lid, when
closed, sit too high on the driver's side (and too low on the left) but when
I release the lid it springs open fully with a jolt!   These are not the
double strut shocks and the lid is stock (not fiberglass) without a tail. 
The shock is new (it has an Automotion rec'd date of 5-15-95) and looks
normal in every way.

Any thoughts on why this is?  Maybe I ought to look into those rachet-type
mechanical ones advertised in Excellence.  Are they available for the rear? 
I liked the front one I used on another car.

Well, some interesting responses to my Harada inquiry.  Suffice it to 
say, some folks appear to have had better luck than others.  Just for the 
heck of it I looked at my current Hirschmann and I see a stamped "Made in 
W. Germany" on the outside, so I don't know where Imparts got their "made 
in Japan" info.  On the off chance I don't need to replace the whole 
thing (thanks for all the diagnostics guys), here's the scoop.  Mast is 
about half way up.  Does not move at all when radio/power turned on/off.  
Getting down close to the wheel well, when my wife clicks the key over to 
where the radio comes on, I hear a "click" in the wheel well and that's 
it.  Same thing when she powers off.  Am I correct that this means the 
motor is burned out and the entire unit must be replaced?  (BTW, I tried 
some WD-40 to see if it was just a lubricant problem.  Someone asked what 
can"t WD-40 do?  Well, it didn't repair the burned out motor! :-) )  
Thanks for your continued input.

Subject: 914 Rocker Panels

        I was forcibly reminded the other day of one important part
of cleaning and/or maintenance for all 914 owners:  The rocker panels.
        All 914 owners should remove the three screws or bolts (stock
is 8mm with a slot as well) that hold the bottom of the outer rocker
panel onto the car.  Pull the bottom of it out a bit.  Be astounded
at the quantity of crap that falls out.  Then take a small-ish blunt
instrument, and lightly scrape along the inner rocker all around the
jack-point.  You'll be even more amazed at even more crap falling out.
        Dirt and such (don't ask what!) gets picked up by the tires,
tossed around in the wheel well, and then gets funneled forward to the
rockers.  The jack point stops most of it, but not all.  Some goes
further forward until it hits a rib on the inner rocker.
        The dirt itself isn't too much of a problem--it's that the
dirt gets wet, and then doesn't dry out.  That holds water against the
inner rockers.  Which leads to rust, which leads to the good ol' flexy
flier syndrome.
        Do your 914 a favor *today*!  Open up and clean out those
rockers!

I've seen several comments about this so here's my .02 cents.  89 951 with
34k miles, about 45-50 drivers schools.  Last school was Easter weekend 95 no
problems.  After got home with car cold tranny locked up ie would not go into
any gear.  Finally got into second and limped to shop.  Guess what, worked
fine!  Brought home and drove without problem several days then locked up
again!  Mechanic questioned driver!  Slave new 1 yr ago and master looked
good.  Clutch pressure felt ok.  Bottom line-small springs near center of
clutch were disintegrating and intermittantly jamming clutch and disc.Also,
non turbo 944s use different clutch with rubber center and will give same
symptoms due to the rubber breaking up.  Hope this helps although its
painful.  Appreciate any other input.

The Hirschmann antenna on my 944 was only extending 3 of the 4 sections,
so I took it apart to see what could be done. In the process, I discovered that
there is a small circuit board that controls the motor. Most likely a current
limiting switch to turn the motor off at the end of its travel. So, it could be
this circuit board rather than the motor that is bad. The circuit board
might be repairable by someone who knew some electronics.

In my case, I lubed everything with graphite and it now works fine. I don't
think that WD-40 is a good idea here; dirt will stick to the oily areas and
then things will get gummed up.

        Do the names Nurburgring, LeMans, Sebring, Bridgehampton, Summit

        All 914s are special in that they are the only mid-engined

Subject: Early 911 Battery Boxes(long)

Nick asked about ways to remediate damage from battery spills. 

The best thing to do is rinse the area liberally. This will take a lot of
patientce. If the problem battery is on the passenger side you will be much
better off as you are further from the multitude of electrical connectors and
components located in the vicinity of the driver's side battery.

I do not think using baking soda or some other base (as in acid-base
chemistry) to neutralize the acid is a good idea. Base reacts with acid to
make salts. In the case of car batteries you make sufates. Salts are known to
catalyze rust. So, if you neutralize the residual spilled acid with base then
you just have to rinse the salt residual off anway. The white stuff you see
is likely to be lead sufate and iron sulfate.

I'm not taken with the idea of using a wire brush. It seems to me this would
just spread corrosive dust around everywhere.

I would tape plastic bags (newer dry cleaning bags should do fine) in
position to protect any electrical connetors/components. Then I would rinse,
rinse .... and when I  was completely out of patience I would rinse some
more. You can not over do the rinsing.

You could use several sponges or just old wet rags. Whatever you use will be
completely worthless when you are done. You should wear disposable clothes
(the kind your wife likes to toss behind the washing mahine when you aren't
looking) and safety glases.  Perhaps you can figure out how to spray a
moderate stream of water in the area and let it drain out the pan. Warm water
will dissolve the salts quicker but this may not be worth the trouble.
Whatever you can think of to dilute and dissolve the acid/salts will work.
Don't forget to rinse off the undercarridge as well before you quit. This is
quite a bit easier because the garden hose will do the job.

Let things dry overnight and see of any white residue reappears. If it does
repeat the process. When the white residue does not comeback after a week.
The spray the area with a heavy dose of WD-40. I would not paint yet.

I would reexamine this area every few months and look for new signs of
corrosion (white powder). Then I would rinse and reapply WD-40. Sooner or
later you will have rinsed away all of the acid and salt. Then you can paint
as you see fit. I think it would cause trouble to paint before you were sure
the area was acid/salt free. 

I liberally spray my 71E's battery boxes with WD-40 at least twice a year
after a good cleaning/rinsing. When I got the car the battery box areas were
in excellent shape and I aim to keep them this way.

I know this sounds like an ordeal. I guess the only thing worse would be to
have to install a new trunk floor pan. 

Let us know what you decide to do and how it comes out.

Dear Mike,

Definitely don't leave it in pieces.  These can get in your air intake
where they'll certainly do no good.  You might put some plastic
sheeting on the engine and do what you can to get the old pad off.  If
it's in pieces, it will just crumble off.  Then you can clean the area
with an oil-based solvent.  A new pad costs about $50, and IMHO is
worth installing.  It certainly will make the passenger compartment
quieter and somewhat cooler.  It's just foam with a hard surface and
doesn't weigh much.

I waited until mine needed a new clutch disc.  It's hard to do it
right with the engine in the car.

Greets,

My 84 928S seems to have a stuck heater.  No matter where I position the

I could use hot and cold air but it was either very hot or very cold, no

the hot air from a heat exchanger is stuck so that only the hot air 
passage is open.  Does anyone have a clue as to what could be wrong?

Well, it depends on how you count "first ones". The original prototype
of the 356 was a mid-engine car. And it *IS* a damned shame that the
production run switched to rear-engine. (The *production* 356s were
all rear-engined.) The "really neat" prototype racers -- the 550s, the 90x, 
for all positive even x < 10, the 917, 956, 962, etc -- were mid engined.

Suffice it to say I've got three non-event related Porsche T-shirts
hanging in my closet:

* "Sure they made Porsches after 1965 but who the hell cares?"
   caption under a collection of 356 pictures

* "Sure they made Porches that weren't mid-engined but who the hell cares?"
   caption under a prominent 914, with 917, 904, 550 in the background

* "Porsches should only have water in them when it rains"
  caption under picture of 550, Speedster, 914, 911 Cab

That doesn't mean I don't like the rest -- I just have my preferences.
As, I'm sure, do we all. What I can't wait for is Winders -- who's really

US-Japan 
Lexus and Infiniti sold their products at below cost when they first opened
dealerships in the US in order to gain market share. The cars were much
more expensive in Japan. What makes anybody think that they want to lose
this market share? I would guess that they will reduce the wholesale price
(that's what the 100% tariff will apply to) so that the dealers can
continue to sell the cars at the same price. So long as they can keep their
dealers in business and keep their customers happpy and keep the assembly
lines rolling, they will do so. The money can be partially recouped from
the dealers in other ways which are not directly linked to new car imports.
Of course there are always unscrupulous dealers and there are suckers born
every minute.....

Wiping your extended antenna down with WD40 or something similar (graphite,

There are lots of things to go wrong, unfortunately. Mine has had
problems with the contacts in the control box (the thing in the dash
with the levers) and the fan behind the interior temperature sensor
(behind the peculiar opening next to the glove box). Repaired the
control box, replaced the fan, and now it works quite nicely. There
is a diagnostic procedure, which might help, in the shop manual, as
well as various information on the whole system. 

If you have access to a microfiche reader (like in a library) you can
buy the shop manual for about $15. The fiche is very inconvenient, but
the paper manuals cost close to $300. You will have a very hard time
puzzling out the operation of the heating/ventilating system without
help from the manual. There are lots of solenoids, vacuum-operated
flaps, sensors, control boxes, voodoo incantations, and other
unexplainable things in there.

I just had this same problem.  In my case I replaced the alternator with a

Hello,

I had the exact same problem as you!

Before you go _any_ further, go have (or, do it yourself if you are so
inclined)
the outside tempature sensor replaced. It is located above the drivers front
wheel rim. It should be about $75.00-$100.00 if you have it done. The part
itself
is about $50.00.  I replaced _every_ dam part you can think of on My 928 from
the control head, to the inside temp. sensor  to the heater core and more.!
Alas it _was_
tha outside temp sensor, and not anything else.

Hope this helps.

Subject: other alternator problem (944S)


With the new toy (914), I've been feeling guilty about neglecting the 944.

Specificly, the alternator has been making a bearing noise for the
past few months.  A couple of p-car mechanics I've talked to swear it's
not drastic as long as the noise doesn't change.  Including the story
of someone driving a hundred thousand miles with the noise and not
having it fail entirely.

However, it is incredibly annoying (I can only really hear it at idle,
but it's embarassing to sit at a stop light and hear it whine).

But I don't think that it is $400 of incredibly annoying (the price of
a rebuilt alternator).

Can the bearings be replaced on these guys at an alternator shop?  Anyone
know of a place that does this (location preference: south san francisco bay,
greater bay area, or any where else that will FedEx and has a quick turn
around)?  Roughly how much would it cost (assuming it's possible)?

Thanks much.

Subject: Re: More antennas

Well, this is not directly related to the Hirschman (sp?) antenna but I
believe it merits mentioning.  The first owner of my Mazda had to replace
the power antenna and the jokers at the repair shop left out one of the
bolts that held the motor in place(actually there might be only one bolt
holding it in place) .  Well, this bolt was also the ground lead!  Thus,
when I first bought the Mazda, many times I would hear, just like the
fellow Porschephile mentioned, a click from the antenna direction and that
would be the end it.  This only got worse as time went by.  What was
happening is the motor would get power, torque itself out of position as
it tried to extend the antenna and stop as the ground lead would
essentially get disconnected.  Then, while going around a fast curve the
connection would be reestablished and the antenna would go up. 

To sum it up, check the antenna mounting and the connections, the motor 
may be fine. (And yes, do use graphite as a lubricant).

Subject: Power Antennas


Jerry-

The power antenna unit is probably one of the simpler
devices on your car, and it's one that you can fool with
all you want without really doing any harm.  The car will
still run even if you totally ruin it.  

I'd suggest that you just take the darn thing out and
take off the cover plate (the round sort of cup-like thing,
about 4" in diameter) and see what's going on inside.  Most
of the time the failure is a simple wire break or other
obvious thing that can be fixed for a nickel.  If the 
springy coil-like gizmo that pushes the antenna up and down
is broken, you can buy replacements that include the mast
for about ten bucks.

I'm sure someone is going to jump all over me for saying this,
but all the power antenna units I've seen are basically the
same, no matter what the price.  There's a little motor, and a
plastic coiled up springy gizmo that pushes the mast up and down.
That's it.  The quality of the $150 units may (I say may) be
a bit better than the $50 ones, but jeepers, we're talking about 
a cheap accessory, not important stuff like bearings or pistons,
where quality really counts.

As it is said...my $0.02 worth.

I think the pad simply serves to keep the

that if the factory thought it worthwhile to
include, then it must do some good.  

I got the old glue off by scraping.  Didn't
take long, but I had the engine out so I could
crawl around inside the engine bay, and I didn't
have to worry about where the little pieces fell.

I actually replaced it not with the $60 OEM pad,
but with a piece of engine insulation material from
JC Whitney.  The latter costs 4 times less.  You get
twice as much material for half the price.  Doing
this was suggested by another P-philer (forgive me,

Subject: More on O2 Sensor Fuel/Air Testing


Jim wrote a few days ago that if a car had a catalytic
converter, then an O2 sensor inserted into the exhaust
stream in order to monitor fuel/air mixture should be
inserted before (upstream from) the converter.  I'm not
sure this is true.  My reasoning:

The O-2 sensor just indicates
whether it is seeing lots of oxygen in which case
it reads near 0v, or lots of fuel, in which case
it reads near 1v.  When there is neither oxygen nor
fuel, it reads 0.45v..  (This is simplified, but I
think it's substantially correct.) 

I can't see how the catalytic converter affects
air/fuel ratios.

Am I screwed up?

leaks. The problem is with cylinder heads not properly seating against the
cylinders. The factory feels the later-style cylinders solve the problem.
If your Carrerra 2/4 engine has a compression loss that sound like an exhaust leak,
or you not oil puddles under your engine, contact your local Porsche dealer.
Most dealers, under Technical Bulletin 9202, March 13, 1992, are dissassembling
the engines and sending the heads and cylinders to the Porsche distributor
to correct the problem"

I have no oil leaks, but over 4000 rpm i have something that sounds like an exhaust
leak, it can only be heard when the windows are open.


If this is my problem, will it get worse(runs fine)?
Has Porsche fixed it for you/ ask you to pay for it, $$$$$$$$$.
What is the best way to check this, a compression test, leak down?

I'd be grateful to anyone that can shed some light on this topic?

This could be a couple of things.  When you say hot air, I assume you mean 
heated and not just warm ambient air.

Does the A/C compressor come on?  (You can hear the clutch 'click')  If not, 
there's a very small relay in the control unit that can repaired rather than 
replacing the whole control unit ($$$!)

Also, check for loose vacuum hoses, and check the function of the vacuum 
check valve near the brake booster.  Measure vacuum with a guage at various 
locations.  You should get a reading of about 15.  10 will cause wierd 
things to happen, like some valves/doors open and some don't.

Not to put it too strongly here, so-called "police" who spend their time
munching donuts behind bridge abuttments while waiting for their radar
to sound off deserve a lot less respect than they get already. They
are wasting their time and taxpayer dollars with no other end in view
than giving out high$ speeding tickets. The system is set up to encourage
speeders, not to discourage them - the pigs-in-the-grass wouldn't be
able to give out as many speeding tickets if there were less speeders.
There is exactly one thing that these "police" could do that would 
earn any respect from me. Get their lazy butts on the road and patrol!
Give out tickets for actual bad driving. I've gone by speed traps,
"manned" by these slugs, just as a bonehead in a Chevy van cuts across
four lanes of heavy traffic (forcing all four lanes to slam on the brakes).
What did the "cops" do? Well, I guess he wasn't "speeding", so they didn't
do anything! So no respect. Tough.

Subject: More 914 rust


The following may be of interest to 914 owners -

                     The Rust Demon Lurks

A recent post by Dave Darling inspires me to relate some 914 rust info.
There are many problem areas on these old cars and most 914 owners know
about the common problems such as the rockers, the dreaded battery acid
effects (too many cars are junk due to this one!) and the rear trunk
floor. However, there are other often overlooked areas that any 914
owner should check. Here's afew I've just finished dealing with on my recently
purchased '73, as close to "rust free" as I've seen. Check these areas
and deal with them now and your 914 will love ya for it!

1) One (well two really) lurkers are in the engine compartment. There
is a perfect water/dirt trap at the front part of the engine shelfs.
This is the part that fits next to the engine under the battery tray
and under the relay board. The problem starts because the rubber drain plugs
(one at each side) inevitably get plugged with dirt and now you have
a water/dirt trap. It's amazing how much crap can get in even if you still
have the rain tray installed on the engine compartment cover!
Reach under here and pull out any accumulated material. I removed the
rubber plug on my cars by reaching up from underneath. Flush out the area
and inspect carefully, if you're lucky there will only be some surface
rust. Replacement panels are available.

2) Have you checked your seat hinge reinforcements recently? This is easily
done and often overlooked.  Pull the seats out and notice that the
area around the seat mounting rails is a perfect water trap due to the
sound deading material that was so thoughtfully installed. This of
course is not a problem if no water ever gets into your car. Dig around
abit with a large screwdriver or similar implement. Hello, big chunks
break loose and you see surface rust underneath, I thought so...
It's time to do a little test. With the floors now exposed flush the
outside of the rear window and fire wall with lots of water, do it
for a few minutes. Now look at you floor. See water? Many of you
probably will. The first likely culprit is the rear window seal. If
it's leaking, change it. Please don't goop it up with silicon, pull
the window and install a new seal ( you need to remove the rollbar
trim first). If your window seal is OK, the problem may be the fire-
wall. If you have a later car with an pad on the firewall in the engine
compartment, this is a potential water trap, my car had a rust spot
behind the drivers seat, I found it by removing the pad behind the seats
and pulling of the sound deadening material. To repair it I also removed
the engine comparment pad (and heaved the sucker in the trash, bye, bye)
and cut out the bad spot and welded in a flat piece of sheet metal.
     OK, we've stopped the leaks. Now, lets remove any rust that has 
started (hopefully as in my case, it's just surface rust) and be sure to
strip of any of the "sound" stuff that has rust under it. Wire brush
and paint with "rust to primer" paint. Now, doesn't that feel good, you've
saved yourself an expensive floor replacement in the future!

3) Head light buckets get filled with leaves, etc. over the years.
Disconnect your battery, crank up you headlights by turning the knobs
on the back of you headlight motors, and remove the headlight surrounds
and peek into the buckets (under you headlights). Most likely there's
some crud in there. Reach in with your skinny hands or use a vacuum with
appropriate attachment to remove this junk. Flush with water and make
sure the drains are not plugged. 

May you have many more years of happy 914 motoring!

Subject: 914 Magazine Coverage

The thread regarding the 914 not receiving enough press has been going on for
several days now. I would recommend that any new PCA member who wants a 914
history lesson contact Ruth Harte at PCA's Executive office and see if you
can purchase a back issue of the November 94 *Panorama*, in which Allen
Caldwell devoted several pages to the 25th Anniversary of the car. Even the
factory's magazine *Christophorus* recalled the Anniversary in the 4/94
issue. There also are frequent articles about significant 914's, particularly
6's, that appear in *Excellence* as well as Pano. (See Jim Pasha's 18 May
note on the subject, Digest #1413). 

BTW, My own 914/6 is going to be *Significant* one of these days! I'm the
original owner of a late '71 (#389 of 435). Three weeks after I bought it, in
August '71, I found out that *Six's* were already out of production and I
made a commitment to keep mine as original as possible. The car now has over
100K miles on it and has been maintained very well (not restored) and was
repainted once, in 1977, in the original Bahia Red. However, the 914's (4 or
6) are such an excellent platform to build a hot rod from it is so tempting
to swap up to bigger engines, etc. that truly stock ones are rare these days.
(I myself would like to create a 914/6 GT if the right donor chassis, the GT
Kit pieces, and a 901/25 motor, all came together.) I've been to 16 Porsche
Parades and there are so few *Original* 914/6's left that the 914/6
Production autocross class has only had two cars (including mine) entered at
the recent Parades! 

My car has been used for every type of event PCA conducts, including Drivers
Ed.  In '71, at the Boston Parade, the car won the Full Concours 914/6 Class,
the 914 Division and was judged for top honors, but lost out to much more
spectacular cars. Since then I put on new front rotors, a new clutch and
Koni's and mounted some A008's on 6x15 rims and it became my wife's track
car. The car still has a charmed life - never damaged bodywise and
engine/gearbox never torn down. (KOW) 
I currently own four Porsches but the SIX will be the last one I'll ever part
with! 

If any P-philers out there are trying to put a 914/6 back together and need a
reference to what one was like originally, drop me a note - I've got as good
an example as you'll probably be able to find, plus all the factory manuals
and the parts book.

Subject: PCA Membership & VIN #'s

I need to thank the following for their inspiration for this note: Joe Brown,
Derek Cahill, Darrin Lucas, Ross Stites, Taka Mizutani, Alex Rozenberg,
Dennis Deeds, and anyone else I missed in the thread. 

PCA membership is unique among car clubs in that the criteria to become an
Active Member includes ownership of a Porsche. This is apparent when you see
a membership application and there is a blank to fill in the VIN. I know for
a fact that "speculation in VIN's" for acquiring membership in PCA is not
new. We have a, local, 35-year member who admits his original membership was
based on a 10% share in a car! Innovation I have witnessed includes "loaning"
a VIN number to a friend who wants to join so he can do his first Porsche
shopping. Using a VIN from a car acquired by a PCA member who joined with
another, earlier car's VIN, (and I'm sure some people have just made up a
number!) Also, once you have joined PCA, and are in between Porsches, you can
remain an Associate Member, as long as you continue paying the $36 dues each
year. Application for Associate Membership can also be made by "...any
person, employed by a Porsche-oriented business, interested in the Club and
its objectives having paid Club dues and fees as required." Associate Members
cannot, however, vote in National PCA Elections or hold National Office.
Requests for Associate Membership must be done through a local Region's
Membership chairperson, to verify their relationship to a business. 
If you need to be put in contact with your local Region's Membership
Chairperson, send me a note including your ZIP code. 

The $36 annual dues (Active or Associate) not only includes your monthly
subscription to *Panorama*, but an annual payment of $12 per member to your
local Region. Other subsidy payments to the Regions may also be voted by the
National organization.

Sorry for the non-Porsche related content to follow... (though this
is pfile-related)

I don't know Bob at all, but scanning through his messages I see the
fateful header line 'X-Mailer: Microsoft Mail V3.0'. I can understand
Bob's frustration, as we deal with exchanging email between the MSMail
world and the UNIX world quite a bit, and one thing we've found is that
the gateway between MSMail and UNIX mail does NOT properly handle return
addresses for messages coming from mailing lists. It's a known problem
at Mickeysoft, and they're not willing to fix it.

Suggestion... Can a list of the members of pfiles (including email addresses)
be put online (ftp, www, etc) and kept reasonably up-to-date, so that
poor unfortunates like Bob can get the info they need to respond to
messages? I'm sure he's not alone with this problem, and it'd be hard
to get everyone to include a signature with email address all the time
(though that's probably automatic for 80% of us...)

Just a thought...

Oh come on...

The cop behind the radar gun has been assigned to this task for the day
by his superiors. Don't blame him personally. They're not told "Go out
and look for people breaking laws and bring 'em in", but instead they're
told "Go out and sit behind a radar gun all day and stop speeders". They
*may* have enough leeway to pick their spot, they may not.

If you want to blame someone, blame the system, or blame yourself if
you get stopped while breaking the law.

Subject: 914 battery issues

It's me again...

Over the weekend I will be testing the electrical circuits in my 914 before
reinstalling the dash.  To that end, I need to pick up a battery for my 
screaming yellow daemon and wanted to elicit your opinions before I go
out and get one.

Fortunately, I still have a battery tray and support.  I do however want
to avoid any damage from leakage/boil over in that area of the car.  Are
sealed batteries good enough?   

A friend's 914 (without battery tray) has the battery mounted in the trunk.
It's enclosed in a black plastic box - this seemed like good and inexpensive
security.  Opinions?

Hopefully, nothing will melt when I test the electricals ;)

I don't think people mean to belittle the officer specifically ...
it's the whole system of traffic enforcement, and how much
of the enforcement has ZERO to do with traffic safety, and
EVERYTHING to do with collecting $$$, and meeting quotas, which
the State of California finally admitted does exist.

Regardless of how we feel about all that, there is no point
to name calling, or being a general jerk to an officer who
is doing his job. He may enjoy handing out 100 tickets a day,
but so what? We elected the politicians that give him the
authority to do it, and pass the traffic laws we don't like
and the officer enforces. I've only had a couple of tickets
in the last 4 years, and both times without exception,
the conversation started like this: "I like your license

Has anyone attempted to replace the shift boot -- the leather cover -- of your 
shifter?  The one for my car was stained when I brought the car and I am 
thinking about replacing it.  How much of the center console do I have to take 
apart to to this?  Also, a few places quoted me prices ranging from $250 - 
$350 for a replacement, which seems expensive.  They all said that it is so 
expensive because the later models are a one piece unit, i.e. the boot and the 
knob form one unit.  In the older models, the shift boot and the knob were 
separate.  TIA

Dennis,

You have taken my statements that were in no way derogatory to the 914
and made it sound like I hate the car. If you would sit back and look
at my statements objectively, you would see every thing I said was accurate.
Here are my statements again with additional comments:

    1. The 914 has been out of production for nearly 20 years.

This statement is accurate and is the major reason you do not see many
articles on the 914.

    2. The 914 was not heavily campaigned as a race car by the factory.

Notice that I said "campaigned as a race car by the factory". This is
significantly different than saying "campaigned as a race car". Even so,
the 914 race history is not very rich when compared to the 911-based cars.
Porsche put very little effort and hardly any emphasis on the 914 as a race
car. Customers raced the care quite successfully in class but the 914 never
really proved itself as a car capable of taking overall wins. The bottom
line here is that I was not making a judgment on the cars ability; rather I
was saying the factory did not campaign the 914 and that is one of the
reasons you do not see a lot of articles about the car today.

    3. The 914 does not have many "special" cars associated with it.

Sure, the 914 in general is a special car. I said as much in my final
paragraph. When I said "special" I was referring to cars that stand out in
history. I can't think of any special race 914s except for the 914-6GT that
did so well at Le Mans one year. Maybe Peter Gregg's 914-6 race car would
qualify as well. The other "special" 914's I mentioned already. They
include all the 916's and the two 914-8's.

I was not, nor am I having now, a bad day. Your statement suggesting some
dweeb was writing flaming messages does not sound all that friendly to me.
I think you need to lighten up a little and stop being so defensive.

As a side note, I would like to point out that the 914 was marketed as a
Volkswagen-Porsche in Germany. I find it hard to believe that you
confidently say that 914s are the only *real* Porsches. I am certainly not
willing to say that 911's are the only real Porsches. This would be quite
immature on my part or any ones part.

Like I said, the 914 is special for many other reasons but none of these
reasons make for great articles. Unless of course they're articles that
discuss how to make them great autocross or time trial cars. Often faster
than their 911 counterparts for a lot less money.

I have been beaten by "underpowered" 914's enough times when autocrossing to
know not to discount their prowess at racing!!

Subject: Adhesive for Engine Pad


For those who asked what I used to affix the
engine pad, it's a 3M product that comes in
a can, not an aerosol or a tube, but a regular
quart can, called something like Vinyl Top 
Adhesive.  (I'm at work and don't have the can
in front of me.)  It's applied with a brush,
and I think it is much better than the spray
adhesive.  It's used by professionals to glue
on vinyl tops (as you would suspect) and also for
carpeting and so on.  Seems to be holding
my pad yp very well...so far...but I only have 1000
miles on the rebuild.  

I do know that I've used this stuff before for
difficult vinyl trim gluing where neither the
spray or the tube stuff held up.  This did.

Also, a can will last a lifetime.

I have no question that they have been directed by their "management"
to behave in this useless, counterproductive manner. This in no way
makes them less culpable. They have a union, if they all decided they
didn't want to do this nonsense anymore they could damned well engage
in labor action to stop it. They haven't, so they can just take the
lack of respect and live with it. Or they can get a real job.

Hey waitaminit, this is porschephiles. I'm sorry, I thought I was posting
to a different list, where this kind of discussion is relevant. Sorry
for getting out of line, folks.

Here's my suggestion for how to make speed enforcement more respectable:
give the cops real driving lessons, and put them in Porsche 930's, have
'em drive at about 90 mph, and if they get passed in any kind of dangerous
manner, THEN pull the dangerous driver over.

Hi, A '76 2.0 914 I'm buying flunked the smog test.  The Percentage of Carbon

lean it out, smog it, then return it to its present state of tune.  Since this
is a constant pressure F.I. system, either I can shorten the interval the in-je

I beg to differ ... in Orlando, summer temperatures can reach 90 degrees or
more. If your car sits in the sun for more than an hour, temperatures inside
can reach 140 degrees! Imagine getting into your P-Car after work and
feel like you're in an oven!

As a side note, I think tinted windows offer *me* a bit of protection. I don't
want a casual passerby on foot to look inside my car and decide that he deserves
to have my audio equipment or cellular phone more than I do.

It may indeed be annoying, and I sympathize with those that don't like cars with
tinted glass -- but since I can legally drive my cars with tinted glass I 
will continue
to do so.

The reason that the "get the factory manuals" is such a standard answer is 
that they do tend to have the most accurate collection of pertinent 
information about the cars.

You wouldn't ask a surgeon to take your appendix out if that was the 
only thing that he knew how to do, would you?

My personal experience is that the manuals pay for themselves each and every
time I don't have to take my car to the robber barons who appoint 
themselves mechanics (at $75 per hour) and still don't get it right
the first time.

I learned my lesson the hard way?  How are you going to learn yours, 
$100 at a time to a mechanic, or $100 at a time by buying an unnecessary
part that doesn't solve the problem, or simply an hour or two at a time
of not having the right information on how to diagnose and fix that 
problem. 

The first things I buy for each of the cars that I own and care about are
an oil filter, an air filter, a fuel filter, and a set of factory manuals.

Sorry to ramble, but some of the pennywise, poundfoolish attitudes of Porsche
owners really get to me (e.g. the porschephile who called to buy a used

        The easy tweak is on the FI "brain".  There's a knob/screw on the top
side, by the corner poking out into the engine compartment.  I beleive that
CCW is lean and CW is rich.
        If you need to tweak the fuel pressure as well, the fuel pressure
regulator is on the LHS of the engine compartment, toward the rear.  It's an
odd-shaped metal can that has one end poked through a bracket sticking up from
the engine tin on that side.  A fuel line connects to the part that sticks
through, and (I think!) there's another fuel line that hooks to the side.
There's a hex-nut on one end or the other that you turn to increase or de-
crease the fuel pressure.  It is *highly* recommended to use a fuel pressure
gauge when you do this.  The tap point is on the RHS fuel rail.  Get a gauge
that can measure 50+ PSI, because the system runs as 45-50.
        I believe that the 3.5% is the state-specified limit--the actual
number before the cat should be about 3%, and after the cat should be < 1%.
Your numbers may or may not indicate additional modifications and/or problems.
They may also reflect an out-of-calibration smog tester--I've seen that very
frequently, even on machines with "X00 to go until calibration" where X was
a large-ish number...

Hi Fellow Porsche Shoppers,

In my continuing quest for a 944, I picked up a copy on the NEW YORK POST

Most were 944s, 928s, and a few 911s. There was 1 914, 1 912 (great 
price: $6500, I think), and 1 924.

If you're in the market for a P-car, contact me with your desired model and

Hey, Thomas-

Consider the cop that has to walk up to a car with
75% black windows at 2AM - not knowing if there's a psycho 
with a 9mm behind the glass...  Sometimes cops _are_ doing more
than collecting revenue for the state.

This "right" vs. "privilege" crapolla burns me up! I know the state
governments LOVE to hold that bit of propoganda over our heads,
but in fact, driving is a right. If a person is of age and can
demonstrate a limited amount of competance, the state MUST grant
the individual a driving license. Only when a person demonstrates
total irresponsibility or incompetance does the person no longer
have the right to drive. You may as well say owning a gun is a
privilege too. Ask any felon!

Hence granting them the *priviledge* of driving on public roads - which
can be revoked if you don't play by the rules.

I'm sure you can build your own roads on your own property, if you have
sufficient funds, and bypass the need to have a driving license issued.
It's *then* your right to drive on those roads (you own 'em, you can
drive on 'em!). Just like you can drive all you want in your own
driveway without a license.

Hi Scott,
sorry to offend you, I'guess my facetious tone didn't translate to the little
screen. 

Since taking my 911 to a  season of AutoX, and track events I have come to be
a much more reserved street driver.

In fact, I'm thinking about selling the old Targa and replacing it with a
 race car.
When I realized that the street offers NOTHING near the potential of a
Porsche experience I have developed a new attitude towards "posing" which is
what you do on the street with a 911. (Like using a computer to do addition)

I figure a CRX would be a better use of $$$$. 
Of course, I'll need one of those damnned 4X4s to tow the Porsche to the
track, and I'll tint the windows too.

Apex late, much better fate

Hi gang,

Sorry for the Porsche content of this e-mail, but I have nothing
to add about cops, speeding, window tinting, trucks, etc.

My 915 tranny was recently rebuilt and shifting is really tough.
I was told that it'll be stiff and tight for a while, but it's
bordering on annoying at the moment.  I recall something
about not using the best oil on a freshly rebuilt engine because
if there isn't enough friction, the rings, etc may not seat correctly.

Does this apply to a 915 tranny?  At first I thought it might so
I'm using Pennzoil lube at the moment, with plans to switch
to Swepco 201 when things are "broken in".  If this doesn't apply
to the tranny, then I'll grab some Swepco next week.

Bob,

The catalytic converter is designed to reduce emissions: NOx
CO (?), and unburned hydrocarbons.  It does this by using a 
chemical catalyst that supports the reaction of these pollutants
with the exhaust gases.

So, if the O2 sensor were after the converter and the unburned 
HC were reduced, it would be a lot more difficult to accurately 
determine the amount of HC coming from the engine exhaust, and
subsequently report this to the fuel injection computer so it
can adjust the amount of fuel it is injecting.

Ok, perhaps the "privilege" part is a bit extreme.
But where is this "MUST" written?  Doesn't West Virginia 
prevent teenagers from getting licenses if their grades are
too low?

And you actually like that state of affairs?  I would much rather
have more difficult training/licensing requirements AND extended
privileges, e.g. higher speed limits, unrestricted areas out west, etc.,
than have to put up with blind, handicapped 80+ year olds, and 
multplie-offense drunk drivers on the roads.  In other words, I'd 
like to see more prevention, and a greater emphasis on and
appreciation for driving discipline.  (Of course, I live in South
Florida, where the concept of "driving discipline" is unheard of.)

Where do we draw the line between "freedom" and "regulation" ?
This is not and easy question, especially when it comes to legislating
out things like window-tinting because it "might be dangerous to someone."

Henrik,

I believe this is a pretty well known problem.  I have read that Porsche has
been very open-minded about goodwill fixes.  This is probably essential,
since the repair work requires disassembly, replacement of pistons and
cylinders, and the cylinder heads must be resurfaced to accommodate the new
cylinder design and new head gasket.  Figure $7-8k.  If I were you I'd take
to Porsche now and have them look it over.  BTW, I think the production fix
was implemented in mid 1991.  So check your build date first.

The other problem to watch out for is the clutch and flywheel.  If your pedal
action is very stiff I'd look into this too.

I'd push hard to get both these updates.  It may not be a problem today but
could be tomorrow when Porsche is less goodwill minded.

but NOT for sale.

I do, however, take pride in knowing that the car is sought after, for either
purpose (and, by the way - I would sell it to a racer FIRST!).  I also sleep
well at night knowing that I sold my water Porsche before it turned me upside
down.  Don't get me wrong - I loved it for what it was.... but I was one of
the few. I also lived through the period when 911 and 356 owners would not
flash their lights at a LOWLY 914.

Subject: Re: More 914 Rust

Great tips, guys - let me ad another.

The Infamous Sail Panels!
  If you are the rare person who has an untouched sail panel, be ready for
action - it will go bad.

Let's examine the design.  A hollow, thin box, with drains on the top, and
underneath the rear quarters. Filled inside with dense composite foam.  Wash
it, drive it - water's going to get inside it.  Where does the water go -
NOWHERE!  It it absorbed by the foam, and rest against marginally protected
metal.  Poor design? You bet!

When your sail panels rust(and the will, if they haven't) make certain that
you remove all that foam crap before repairing - it doesn't do any good at
absorbing sound anyway.  Then, be certain you drill access holes underneath
the trim strips.  You can inspect and flush through these on a periodic
basis.  Fill the cavity with rustproofing (use Wurth's), and forget.  I did
this with mine in '79 - still perfect and will pass any concours judging,
since the plugs are underneath the trim!

Hi.

Anyone besides me that have read Automotion Tech Tip on page 152?

"Some early 911 Carrera 2/4 engines are experiencing compression loss and oil
leaks. The problem is with cylinder heads not properly seating against the
cylinders. The factory feels the later-style cylinders solve the problem.
If your Carrerra 2/4 engine has a compression loss that sound like an exhaust 
leak,
or you not oil puddles under your engine, contact your local Porsche dealer.
Most dealers, under Technical Bulletin 9202, March 13, 1992, are 
dissassembling
the engines and sending the heads and cylinders to the Porsche distributor
to correct the problem"

I have no oil leaks, but over 4000 rpm i have something that sounds like an 
exhaust
leak, it can only be heard when the windows are open.


If this is my problem, will it get worse(runs fine)?
Has Porsche fixed it for you/ ask you to pay for it, $$$$$$$$$.
What is the best way to check this, a compression test, leak down?

I'd be grateful to anyone that can shed some light on this topic?

Thanks

Henrik

I had a similar problem.  At 8000 miles my 89' Carrera 4 developed excessive 
valve chatter.  Initally, my mechanic felt the car needed an early valve 
adjustment, but after adjustment the valve noise in the right bank actually 
increased.  After the engine was dissembled, it turned out that there was 
significant premature valve guide wear.

Porsche paid for all parts in the repair (guides, pistons, cylinders, cylinder 
head resurfacing etc.).  I was happy Porsche picked up the tab for parts, but 
I had to pay for all labor which ended up costing around $6k.  Ouch!!!

Anyway, the car is running beautifully now, and the engine purrrrrrs!!!!

Good luck!!

On June 11th , 1947, Dr. Porsche began to design the first car to carry 
the Porsche name.  It was the Type 356 and the engine was in the *middle*. 
 The story goes that in 1948 the car was sold and work began on the Type 
356/2.  It had its engine in the *rear*.  In due time, it too was sold.  
One day, shortly thereafter, the owner of Porsche #1 happened to be 
driving  down a Bavarian back road with his wife and came upon Porsche #2 
which was parked by the side of the road in a beautiful setting.  The 
owner of Porsche #1 stopped, examined the car, noted the engine location, 
got back in his car, and drove away.  After a few miles, his wife asked 
him what he thought of the 356/2.   He replied, Its a nice car, but its 
not a *real* Porsche.  And so, the legend begins...

     Detlev Pohle -- phone 904 725-9155.
     
     If anyone in the Jacksoville vicinity has 1/2 hour to look over this 
     car, and give me his findings, I would REALLY appreciate it.
     
     I am interested in the following:
     
                        Any accidents
                        Anything repainted - check fender lips and trim,

                        Tires - condition
                        Maintenance records - are they "clean" & sequential 
                        Books -- all there?
                        Any gaping holes in the dates/mileage maintenance? 
                        Nicks, dents, scratches -- front, side, top and     
                                underside.
                        Trunk -- conditions of spare and battery 
                        Engine -- clean? oil drips?
                        Any extras in car - CD, Radar .....?? 
                        Date of Mfg.  check door sill plate
     
     If you have a video camera, and have a tape, and have the time, shoot 
     me 10-15 min. of details -- go very slowly over each car section.  If 
     you do not, ask Detlev if he can do it -- he is sending me photos, but 
     you know how photos are.  I will reimburse you for any expense.

Dennis,

Are you trying to start a flame war here?  What is the point of telling
this bit of folklore (that is probably not even true)? And who really
cares what the guy thought anyway? The original 356 had more VW parts in
it than any other Porsche ever produced. What does that prove? Nothing.

I strongly suggest you sit back and see what this list is all about
before you go causing problems.

A 914 is not any less a Porsche than a 944 is or any less a Porsche
than the 911. The fact is that people have preferences when it comes
to Porsches. Some people like the water pumpers best. Others the 914.
Some like the 356 the best. Still others prefer the 911. This is what
makes the world go around. But to say that the 914 is is more a Porsche
than the 911 because it is mid-engined is assanine and immature. So
please, go spout this stupidity someplace else!!

I couldn't imagine driving a well sorted Porsche in the USA with

in GB 8yrs I am truly liberated to drive as I please within comon sense.
This means 85-90mph on the Freeway and whatever suits on the beautiful
A and B roads across the countryside.  The only real radar enforcement is 
in the Cities with GATSO detectors (flashes the plate and sends the bill).
Although the official Highway speed is 70mph the Police always drive in
the slow lane and as long as you are driving sensibly, they don't bother you.
Because GB is relatively small there are 5 race tracks within 3hrs drive of 
London to really blow it out if necessary.

I don't think people mean to belittle the officer specifically ...
it's the whole system of traffic enforcement, and how much
of the enforcement has ZERO to do with traffic safety, and
EVERYTHING to do with collecting $$$, and meeting quotas, which
the State of California finally admitted does exist.

Regardless of how we feel about all that, there is no point
to name calling, or being a general jerk to an officer who
is doing his job. He may enjoy handing out 100 tickets a day,
but so what? We elected the politicians that give him the
authority to do it, and pass the traffic laws we don't like
and the officer enforces. I've only had a couple of tickets
in the last 4 years, and both times without exception,
the conversation started like this: "I like your license
plate. GETA911. Looks like I GOTA911! May I see your license

Well, OK, you didn't flame anyone, but, I say, *BUT* you did hit Yer Kindly

> I'm tired of seeing belittling, derogatory references and attitude to the

I, for one, am tired of police that *earn* these little sobriquets.  There
are many policemen who are noble public servants.  Alas, they tend to turn
a blind eye at the scum in uniform who foul the waters for them all.  Other
wise, things would be markedly different than they are today, and they wouldn't
be called such names by mature adults (or even by Porschephiles).
 
> These guys need to be respected. 

They need to *earn* that respect!  And for the good ones to turn a blind eye
on the scum, loses them the respect that they would otherwise have earned, and
earns them, instead, *contempt*.

When a policeman stops me, I will deal with him respectfully.  He's armed,
and frequently a hostile, paranoid bully, looking for an excuse to exercise
*control* through the use of physical force.  Do you think I would want to
give him any excuse to "do his thing?"

An officer who is polite and respectful to me, will get my respect.  Do you
see any of the terms you find so distasteful, in any of *my* text?  Does that
imply that I agree with you?

> When they pull someone over, they're doing their job.

I disagree.  It is their duty to uphold the law, but they are given (or take)
certain lattitude as whether they ticket or warn offenders.  Thus giving a 
ticket becomes a prerogrative of their job and when they ticket, they are 
exercising the *Prerogatives* of their job. 

The police are as contemptuous of the speed laws as you or I.  They do not 
apply the prerogatives equally, but as the spirit moves them.  Their *job* is 
(first to *Obey* the law, and then) to enforce the law impartially.  They 
universally ignore the speedlimits themselves, fail to cite each other, and 
are quite accurately and correctly scorned as "revenoors."

> And as they walk up to the window of whoever they pulled over, 
> they're risking their lives. Cops have been shot in situations like that.

This is true, and very unfortunate.  It's a hazardous line of work.  That
fact excuses exactly *zero* percent of the type of behavior that has earned
them the widely percieved image that they currently bear.

> I don't care if the police man is a rookie enforcing stupid traffic laws, or

> Lets cut out the 'revenue-collector', 'pig', etc b*llsh*t.

Neither do I.  Lets demand that the police treat the public with respect, and 
cut out the powertrip bullsh*t that has so well earned them the names you
object to.

Gotta question for the group.

My Dad was an 85ish 928 that was in for general maintainence and a look-see
and the mechanic dicovered a loose wheel bearing on the right rear wheel

It (the bearing) was taken apart cleaned and repacked.  After getting
the car back, it makes a loud whirring shound begining around 40 mph
and proceeds to get louder at higher speeds.

Question:  Is the bearing shot and he needs to get a new one?  I've talked to
some of the more highly recommed 928 sources on this list and the tech
rep seems to to think it may not be the bearing.

Oh, my Dad lives in mid-east and only gets to go shopping for parts once a
year when he comes home.  Should he look for the bearing?

One company told me that if they had to pick only part on the planet that
was over-engineered, it would be the 928 rar wheel bearing  :^)

Any ideas?

Right on, Unka Bart,

The riot by NYC cops this week in Washington,DC, is typical: they caused
$30,000 in damage to the hotel inwhich they were staying, and the DC police
arrested NONE of them. Professional curtesy, I guess...:(

Your best bet with any policeman is not to give him (or her) a reason to pull
you over.  Failing that, a witness in your car never hurt.

I have on tape something which was on A&E (arts and entertainment network)
between 5 and 10 years ago, which had the stories of various sports car
histories.  In there, they have Porsche number 1, and sort of walk around
it with the camera.  A very beautiful car.  It is indeed a mid-engine
sort-of 356, silver, cabrio.  I think it's in the museum still.

Subject: Heater and Clutch Help

I'd like to thank all the 'philes who offered help with my
stuck-on-hot heater and my not-disengaging-when-cold clutch on
my '86 944. I couldn't face getting dirty and took it to the
repair shop. They got the heater to 'work' by replacing a control
tap. They said that this was leaking water over the bellhousing
and that this may have been causing the clutch to stick since they
cannot find enything else wrong. Has anyone else had this clutch
problem solved in this way?

I now have a small residual problem in that the heater is either
full on or blowing cold air only with nothing in between. I assume
that I need further attention to whatever controls the water or air
mixing. Can anyone tell me what 'the whatever' is and what needs to
be done.

It is a basic heater, not A/C and the temperature goes from cold
to hot with a slight clockwise turn of the temperature control
dial. I assume that this dial should give a gradual increase in
temperature over its full arc. 

In the meantime I'll look on the bright side since HOT or COLD
is a better choice than HOT or HOT. :-)

Subject: 930 front lights wiring mess

I could use the "net's" help in figuring out the correct wiring for my front
lights.

Some backround on the problem:
To help your understanding of the story; I bought this 1984 930 (my first
Porsche) about a month ago from somebody in San Jose, CA. As I give attention
to various areas of the car I have been making some interesting little
discoveries. What follows is one of them for which I could use your help
figuring out:   
It started routinely enough with my trying to adjust the front lights so I
could see the road a little better.

The first discovery of the day was that underneath the car's color matching
(anthracite) headlight rim was another headlight rim with adjusting screws
showing. The color of this second rim is black and the texture is somewhat
rough. It looks pretty sporty and I am wondering if this was the showroom
look. Does anyone now?

The second discovery has less to do with cosmetics and more with electrical
puzzlement. As I removed the front light assembly I noticed that the nylon
where the positive wire (brown) connects on the main bulb tri-plug was brown
from having overheated.I also observed that from that connection another
brown wire was providing the positive lead for the front parking lights (next
to the turn signal).

Looking further (I had never taken a Porsche headlight apart before), I
noticed that a second smaller bulb just below the main one not connected.
Left and right headlights have the same setup. 

 
The car was repainted and the shop did a nice job but my suspicion is that
wiring was not their forte.


Here are my questions:

1. Where should the power come from for the parking lights? Obviously the
current setup is causing the nylon to melt and that leads me to believe that
it is wrong.

2. What is the purpose of the second smaller light bulb and how should it be
connected?

Thanks for any advice.

It's merely a matter of personal choice. Just like any controversial

subjects, emotion gets in the way of reason.

I will defend anyone's right to regard tinted windows with contempt as long 
as they will defend my right to keep my belongings safe and upholstery

A hearty thankyou to everyone who responded to my inquiries recently.

Update:  Turns out the Tri Flow on my analog clock worked after all.  It's

I purchased the set of VR Falkens yesterday.  Thanks for the advice,
everyone.  Though they seem to *float* a bit more than the gatorbacks that
were on previously, they seem to  hold the road much better--very sticky.  I
suspect the *floating* is due to the wealth of tread (compared to the nearly
depleted goodyears).  The Goodyears had more *snap* but were very
unforgiving.  When they decided to realease, there was no warning. The
Falkens are much more progressive.  Anyway, I'm very impressed so
far--especially with price--turns out I received a discount I wasn't
expecting, and got them for less than $70/tire!  Not bad.

I feel compelled to ask: so what? I spent much of my youth training to be 
a cop (Explorers, summer courses, etc.) but once I started driving and 
DEALING with cops in the real world, I came to my senses. But believe me, 
being a cop isn't rocket science - nearly anyone with the will to do so 
can become a police officer. (if that ain't the truth...)

I grew up in Flint, Michigan. Lots of factories and automotive plants; 
nothing much but, actually. Plenty of good people get injured and killed 
working in factories. Lots of decent people die doing their jobs; an 
aircraft carrier never returns to port with the same number of people it 
left with, for example. Why is a dead cop worth more respect than a kid 
who got sucked into a jet intake?!? WHY?!? It is a **JOB** like any 
other, and if they didn't LIKE it - and believe me, most LOVE it - they 
wouldn't DO it.

They earn my respect like everyone else - by treating me decently and 
fairly. Guess what? Plenty of them haven't, and I have NEVER been 
anything but polite with them, and I have NEVER committed any crime more 
serious than exceeding the speed limit on a deserted highway - and not by 
much, I might add; I drive a 924!  :-)  (note P-car content)

Hence - "revenue collectors" and "pigs." 'Nuff said. Sorry about the 
wasted bandwidth, fellers, but, boy, that feels good to say.

Subject: no porsche content-just spewing

Solutions 
 
Tinted windows-Tinting is legal. Certain percentages of tint are not. If
you want to protect your interior and stay legal, let the shop doing the
tint know that. For obvious reasons, it is illegal to drive with an
obstructed view. Regulations on tinting stem from that. I personally find
tint a pain in the ass for night driving. 
 
Pigs-If you have a problem with cops, don't get pulled over. I have found
that if you are not the fastest or most reckless driver on the road, and
try not to run lights or stop signs, you will rarely get pulled over. Of
course there are lots of Porsches where I live. 
 
Cops are bad-I only know 2 NYC cops. One broke his leg playing football,
and made a effort to make it appear to be a job-related injury (fraud). He
smokes pot, but not much else. Ironic, as he is a narc. The other is an
old, married guy now, but used to be in a Chinese gang when he was a kid.
Basically, in JHS and HS, he shot at people and they shot at him. Both
these guys are perfectly good cops, and I would be very happy to have them
around if I ever needed a cop. They deal with scum every day, and develop a
different sort of attitude towards people than those who have more
white-collar jobs. If they do OT, they might make $70K a year. For that,
and having to deal with hostile people everyday, and being placed into a
possible life-threatening situation every time I stopped a speeder,
especially one with the "drug dealer look" (tinted windows, gold package,
bra and tough looking passengers), I would be looking for a different job.
Gives cops credit for doing the job you wouldn't want on your worst day. 
 
Scam-It has been said that being a cop is like being a member of a big
gang. If you want favored treatment, join the gang. If you have a local
business, make it easier for local cops to use your services. Get to know
them. Ask for some id that shows you know cops. Anything from a PBA card to
a small wallet shield to a shield for the back of your car. If you get
pulled over, do so quickly and safely, be polite, show the id with your
valid DL/insurance card/registration/inspection and ask if it helps. Tell
the cop that you are related to the guy that you got the id from. Be
prepared to state the name, precinct number and badge number. You WILL be
treated with respect. This is not kissing ass any more than telling your
manager's manager that his kids are smart or mowing your girlfriend's
father's lawn when you would rather be watching TV and it pays off better. 
 
Common sense-Like it or not, that is the system. Learn it, and hack it to
your advantage like you would anything else. Live stupid and expect the
consequences.

Subject: Rebuilding alternators? (2nd attempt?)


Since everyone is so busy imitating rec.autos.driving, perhaps my original
message about rebuilding alternators was lost in the muck.

Briefly, my 944S' alternator is making an annoying whining noise.  For
the past 6 months or so.  Several mechanics I talked to say "No big deal."
as long as the noise doesn't change, the alternator will remain functional.

However, it is annoying.

After posting here asking about alternator rebuilds I proceeded to call
a few local alternator shops.

After giving them the year and model of my car and the Bosch alternator
p/n they all quoted roughly the same price:  $60 for the bearings, $120 
for a complete rebuild.

No warranty for the bearings, 90 day warranty for the rebuild.

This sounds... cheap.  Downsides to this?  Obviously I, or someone, will
have to pluck the alternator out and bring it to them, but that's no
big deal.

Wondering if this is too good to be true..

It doesn't, but it does affect the exhaust gas content.  One thing it
does is free up oxygen from NOx molecules, which is then combined with
CO to produce carbon dioxide.  Depending on the amount of NOx going into
the cat, there may remain excess O2 in the post-cat gasses, which is not
helpful to the lambda loop.

Bottom line is that the lambda sensor is there to monitor the output of
the engine, not the engine+cat combination.  I know that race engine
developers who use lambda try to locate the sender as close to the
engine (in terms of runner length) as possible to get as true a reading,
because there are chemical changes going on after gasses leave the
engine.

The rear wheel bearings on my '83 928 were not the type that could be taken
apart and cleaned. They are (large) sealed dual race ball bearing
assemblies. Needless to say there is nothing to adjust. The large casting
the bearing fits into has to be heated to install/relace the bearing.
Bearings cost somewhere between $50 and $100 each, (I've been trying to
forget how much I've spent.)

Maybe the '85 model is different but I doubt it.

Hi p-philers!

I am about to be in the market for a "pre-owned" p-car.  I have read the FAQ's and many of the archived 
posts but, I do have a question and I hope I can prevail on some of you to give me some insight!

I have noticed many admonitions to be sure the car you are considering purchasing has "books and records" 
also some of the ads I have seen say that the seller has them.

My question is, what are books and records?  I assume that they include owners manuals and service records, 
anything else?

Additionally, what should the records include, how far back, covering what and, mainly, how do you tell that 
they are authentic?

Lastly, is there any area of the country (USA) that has better deals?  I have read one post that said Texas had 
lower prices.

Either e-mail or posts would be appreciated and, if there is interest, I would be happy to compile responses 
and post to the list or email.

TIA for any help!

I have had some difficuly running a front plate
on my 66 912.  This car was produced with no
provision for a front plate (guess they didn't
need such things back then, he waxed nostaglgic).
Unfortunately, the law in Missouri says I *have*
to have a front plate.  I've had no luck so far
getting an exemption from the Department of
(Revenuers?).  Thinking about writing my State
Rep (no, I didn't vote for him but, apparently,
enough assholes did).

Don't tell me to try the aftermarket mounts.
I've done that a couple of time (anyone in the
market for some good abused mounts?).  And there
is NO WAY I'm going to drill into my trim.  The
car is slightly lowered, about 60mm ride height
on the front.  The problem seems to be that,
no matter how rationally mounted, the license
plate is the lowest thing on the car.  I don't
like that.  Number one, everytime the plate
goes South, there goes my front valence plate
too.  Number two, I DON'T LIKE IT!  It looks
shitty.  Especially with the obscene color plates
that MO makes me wear (I also hate the color of
my inspection sticker).

I paid my money.  Why do I have to put their
stupid tags all over my mover?  To separate me
from all the *other* green 66's running around?
(Cause you don't want to get pulled over, dumbass)

Gotta give my soapbox a new coat of varnish.

Me:  What's the problem officer?

Officer:  Did you know that in Illinois we require you to have a front

Me:  Yes, officer.  You see, the front bracket was damaged and I have ordered
a new one from my dealer.

on your car if it's registered in this state.

Me:  Yes, officer, I'm sorry, but my dealer won't have the part I need to

trunk if you need to see it.

Officer:  No- I don't want to see your plate.  There must be other dealers
around that have the part you need.

Me:  I checked, and so did my dealer.  That's why he had to back order it for

Officer:  Here is your ticket, payable within 10 days,  $15.00. If you do not

Subject: 911 Headroom and 5pt Harness

A couple of months ago I mailed in about headroom in 911's.  I
couldn't fit into my 911 with a helmet on for racing.

Well, I solved the problem, sort of.  I guess I should say I improved
the situation.  I bought a Sparco Supersport, Sparco seat rails, and
a Corbeau seat mount adapter.  After the installation, I gained 
about 1.5 inches of additional headroom.  It is enough to make
a BIG difference.

I didn't really want to spend the money, but the seat I had was
not modifiable.  I gained 1.5 inches of headroom and a much
more supportive seat.  The Sparco Supersport is a nice seat,
but I'm not convinced it is as nice as a Recaro.  It is less expensive
though.

Now, I have a question about the mounting points for the right-
hand side lap belt of the 5pt harness.  The options are: 1)
drill a hole through floor board slightly behind the seat and
mounting an eye bolt, 2) putting an eye bolt into the side of the
seat where the factory belt mounts.  Any other options or opinions?

If anyone has any questions about the seat installation, just
let me know.  I can give you all the info.

Subject: Re: replacing a shift boot on...

Bill,
It is relatively easy to replace the shift boot on late model (after 85 1/2)
944 series cars which are the only ones I have attempted. First order a new
boot in the appropriate color. I forget exactly who sells them but they are
advertised in Pano and Excellence. 
Next carefully pry off the plastic shift pattern plate from the shifter
handle. This needs care because the little fingers that hold them are
somewhat fragile.
Then remove the old cover by pulling the sides together at the base. This
will allow it to be freed from the console. It is not necessary to take off
the console.
Reassembly is the reverse.
I have made this sound somewhat easier than it is because the replacement
kits have much more detailed explanations. The bottom line is it can be done
with no major disassembly and the end result is very satisfying. You are
going to need a bit of patience.

From: HermanHome@aol.com
Subject: Slip Angles, Fast Cornering, Etc

I have been following the recent thread on tire slip angles, fast cornering,
etc, with obvious interest.  Everyone has well though out positions, and alot
of good information has been discussed.  I would like to try and pull all of
the arguments together to form cohesive statements about the subject:

1) A tire responds differently to braking and cornering forces.  This is due
to the construction of the tire, and the dynamics of the forces that are at
work.  Braking tends to mash the tire into the road, and increase it's
contact patch.  Cornering tends to distort the tire, and it's contact patch,
as it tries to alter the course of the vehicle.  You cannot make inferences
from braking and relate them to cornering.

2) The relationship of the tire to the road under braking would be more
straightforward with respect to static and sliding co-efficients of friction.
 Therefore, in most conditions, braking with the tire at the verge of lockup,
the point of maximum static friction, should result in the shortest stopping
distances.  Once the tire starts to slide, on most surfaces, it has a lower
co-efficient of sliding friction, and stopping distances will get longer.

3) A tire generates cornering force through slip angles. In order to get a
vehicle to change direction, you must turn the front tires away from straight
ahead.  At slow speeds and low cornering forces, the tire (and the vehicle)
will follow the arc that you have steered exactly.  As cornering forces rise,
the tire will begin to "slip", and it will follow an arc that is somewhat
greater than the arc that the wheels are turned.  The angle between the
"steered arc", and the "actual arc" is the slip angle.  As was stated by
Byron Short, BF Goodrich suggests a slip angle "window" of between 8% to 12%
for maximum cornering using their R1s.  This means that the tires will be
sliding a small amount to generate maximum cornering force.

So how does this all relate to faster cornering?  In order to corner at the
maximum G force, you must utilize all of the tire's slip angle at both ends
of the car.  This means that the front tires must be understeering slightly
to get maximum loading.  As stated, the slip angle must be between 8% and
12%.  In order for the back of the car to generate slip angle, it must be
oversteering.  The back of the car must be sliding as well!  That is how it
develops slip angle.  The rear tires slide in a wider arc than the car is
pointed at.  

So the front is understeering and the rear is oversteering??? (Herman's
really lost it now, out of control, spinning off of the logic track, crash
and burn, fire up the flame throwers, let's finish him off!).  No, this is
REALLY what happens, it's called a 4 wheel drift, and both the front end, and
the back end are sliding, and the car is developing maximum cornering power.
 If only the front end were sliding, the car would be understeering, and not
using the rear to full potential.  And if only the rear were sliding, it
would be oversteering, and not using the front to full potential.  In an
extreme case of oversteer, where the driver has to countersteer to keep up
with the slide, the front develops no slip angle at all, and like it or not,
this is slow.  It may feel neat, but....

A few final thoughts to convey here:

4) Tires have a slip angle range that they work with-in.  If you are
cornering with a 12% front slip angle, and an 8% rear slip angle, the car
will feel like it has slight understeer.  If you are cornering with an 8%
front slip angle, and a 12% rear slip angle, the car will feel like it has
slight oversteer.  So a car can have understeer or oversteer tendencies, even
while generating maximum cornering.

5) On slower corners, it is most important to get the car pointed around the
turn right away, and so "pitching the car"  will help to quickly setup a
slight oversteering drift.  This will allow you to get into the power as soon
as the car starts to come around.

6) On higher speed corners, keeping up maximum speed and stability through
the corner is most important, and so "carving" up to an understeering drift
will allow you to get through the corner the quickest.

I hope that this has helped to clear things up a little.  One thing that I
have always believed  is that you must think about driving in order to drive
better.  Keep up the driving threads!

Subject: 924/944 steering column ground connection??



	I have a 1980 924 with a horn problem.  I have traced this to 
be a flakey ground connection between the steering wheel hub contacts
and the chassis ground.  It seems that the column is isolated from the
chassis at the column suspension points, is there a single ground 
lead somewhere from column unit to chassis that may be insecure?  Any
hints on where to look for this would be helpful! I have made a decent
inspection underneath the instrument area with not much success.

	More detail on symptom: there is continuity between the steering
wheel's horn ground contact points and the steering column through to the
engine bay area, but not from the contacts to a metal point on the chasis.
If I ground the horn lead that comes out the middle of the column (originating
at the relay) I get a nice clean toot, as expected.


Thanks,

PS this is a rush job as the car has to go through inspection before the

Subject: 911 SC electric / oil leak problems.


Hello,

Since law school ended last week, I have been driving my 1981 911SC
quite a bit lately.  I have come upon a few problems.  

First, I changed the oil, and oil plug which is under the engine block
(the one almost in the center of the car) now leaks very very slightly.
I think this bolt used to have a washer along with it, but I no longer
have the washer.  It may have fallen off in my driveway somewhere, but I
cannot find it.  Is there a washer that takes up some space with this 
center oil drain bolt?  The bolt seems almost stripped now when I tighten
it in place, and therefore is leaking about 20-20 drips after the car is
shut off.  Then it stops, I assume since the oil has cooled at this point
and then thickens slightly.  Is there a washer with this bolt?  If not,
and its slightly stripped, what may help fix it?  Teflon Tape?

My second, and probably more serious problem is with my electrical system.
When I step on the brakes sometimes, or other time it seems while the car
is just idleing, there is some sort of surge in the slectrical system and
the tachometor fluters quickly up and down, up to about the 6000 RPM
line.  The engine idle does not change, only the tach needle moves.  Also,
the hand brake light flickers on.  All this only last for a second or two,
and then the elctraonics seem normal again.  This also makes my Sony CD
changer system Which I installed in the car about 2 years ago turn off, and 
on again.  This is powered off of the radio.  This surge seems to happen
as I am slowing to a stop for an intersection, while the car is in neutral,
or coasting.  I have not seen it while accelerating.  And if I tap the
gas, it seems to stop immediately.  The other gauges seem fine, and the
green alternator light does not come on.  Does this sound like a loose
wire somewhere, a short, or is there some fuse that my be blown.   How 
should I diagnose this?

Thanks.

I had the same problem (and still do, but alas! I have found the 
solution! Put NO plates on the car at all and REALLY screw 'em up! :) ) 
Either way, I called DMV of NJ, and the car, never having been out of 
Indiana for more than 2 days, with never a front tag, and no holes, 
regardless of what Porsche says, still HAS to have front plates... no 
exemptions for us, they told us in not so kind words... But, it doesn't 
seem to matter, as we can't get insurance for it anyways... but if you 
really miss driving it, do what we do, have a friend follow CLOSE behind 
and hide the rear plate, such that the police don't see your expired out 
of state plate... :)
Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any good solution for this 
situation, although, my neighbor suggested something somewhat useful... 
You know how dealers have those dealer tags with magnets that they just 
slap on the car? Do the same... Unfortunately, I had to tell him that I 
didn't believe that those magnets would hold on to a rippled surface 
(like the underside of a Porsche front) at 60 mph on bumpy roads...
Hmph... just my 2 cents.

$15?! Where live you? Here in scenic NJ, a ticket doesn't just stop there 
when you pay (like $35-50), they (insurance) must also surcharge you $500 
over the next two years! So, apparently, we can't afford to drive these 
so easily afterall in NJ (which explains part of why many Porsches are 
garage queens in NJ, and a much lower than normal percent are actually 
driven)

On your oil leak problem:

There is a brass (?)(maybe copper) ring which should go on the oil plug.  
Amazingly, these are fairly cheap (.59).  I was advised to change this 
ring and the one on the oil pan plug every time I change the oil.  This 
of course is on a Carrera engine, but I doubt its any different on the

I have a 1972 911S transmission with a 3.2 Carerra engine. The shifter is
very tall.
I am thinking about installing a Short Shifter, but have questions:
1. Are they good to have- Do they really accomplish anything?
2. Does having a shorter shift pattern make it harder to find the right
gears in a hurry, like in track events and racing? (Don't want to misshift
into the wrong gear, which is quite common on the track)
3. Can a novice install one himself like the ads say?
Would appreciate hearing from those with experience in 72 911 who have used
short shifters.

I'm one of those people who you would expect to have joined up, I
love my 912 and would enjoy talking to more people like me
face-to-face in addition to the porschephiles.  I'm sure Panorama
is worth getting.  But,  I called to join the Chicago region using
the 800 number, nope, cant do it.  Chicago region "doesnt work that way." 

Then, got the name/number of local person - no call backs.  I go to
the local p-car dealership - idiots at the parts counter.  No luck
with anything "PCA official" except Stoddards, who I think is great
(the local PCA region in Ohio also puts on one great swap meet
at Stoddards - which I attend every year).

I guess I've run out of patience and so for lack of ease, I havent
joined.  I'm sure there are great regions out there, nice people,
fun to be had,  and my experience is a statistical blip.    I do 
realize that the PCA folk are probably non-paid volunteers and
extra patience/understanding is needed since they're doing this
on their time.

So please dont flame me - its just *my* reason for why I havent joined

sometime and have better luck.

california desert car-absolutely no rust except for one very tiny bubbling in
one area front of windshield.  A couple of areas had been patched and painted
from fender benders (from previous owners...)  I'd honestly say the car is in
overall "good" condition.  Car & owner are located in Ridgecrest CA. (about 4

What a shame.  I always do.  FWIW, lot's of newer 911's won't wave at me
in my LOWLY 71T.

Last week I pulling out of a parking lot and saw a guy getting into his

20 seconds later I was at an intersection 50 feet away. He was still standing

Both made my day and made me sad at the same time...

Stripped how?  At the head or at the thread?  If your case is aluminum(like
the 914s) then over-torqueing the drain plug will cause the threads in 
the case to fail.  If this is the case, you should install a Helicoil 
so the original bolt can be used(and do get another washer). 

Sometimes, tighter isn't better, so always be sure to follow the torque
recommendations in the manuals.

Nope, one is a scum-bag, and the other is a Police officer.  The fact that 
the Police Officer was a gang-banger before he was a cop merely reflects the
circumstances that he grew up in.  He went straight and became a valuable
citizen when he grew up.

The other is a criminal in uniform.  Your description, not my judgement.

Well, I've got friends that are Mafiosi, and I'd be happy to have them
around if I needed help.  So what?

> towards people than those who have more white-collar jobs. 

Yes.  One of your acquaintences is scum.  He steals and smokes pot, while 
arresting other thieves and pot-smokers.  I personally think that pot-smoking
should not be against the law, but it is.  A cop that breaks the law and yet
has no compunction about ruining the life of another who breaks that same
law (and no question, the otherwise harmless activity of pot smoking becomes 
life-destroying when one is arrested for it), is *worse*.

The attitude you describe is one that must be rooted out and eliminated.  It 
is at the root of the problem between the people and the police.  It is 
contempt for the law, and for the people.  Even worse, is the attitude that
you show in your cynical message.  It is the same attitude the German people
showed during the reign of the Nazis (my apologies to our Deutsche Volk on
the list, I mean no disrespect to any Germans today).  If the people do not
demand that the agents of the government respect the the Laws they are charged
with enforcing, and the rights of the people, then the people will soon have
*no* rights, liberty or freedom, and they will have acquiesced to their
plight.

Triet, you have described an unfortunate, all too frequently encountered,
fact of life.  You miss the fact that the existence of corruption is not a
valid reason to contribute to it, or foster its continued existence. 

I really don't want to flame you, but I confess to being astonished

Subject: $20 to smooth shifting

If you have a pre-87 911 with a 915 transmission, then you have probably gone
through various procedures to make the the clutch, trans, gear linkage
situation more friendly. I wrote about my problems a few months back, and was
told to basically "change the fluid and learn to love it". I had already
replaced snychros and "dog teeth" just to return to the status quo. One
mechanic suggested that I replace the "bushings". 

This last suggestion could have saved me thousands in cost, miles of bad
shifting, and quite a measure of frustration. There are two plastic pieces in
the shift linkage that can be replaced with about $20 in cost and about an
hour of labor.

The parts needed are a "ball socket" [#91142413900] and a "shift
ring"[#91442422400]. I believe that these are year and model specific. After
removing the console, and unbolting the gear shift housing and the rear
coupling to the transmission, it is a simple matter of pressing out the old
parts and pressing in the new ones [hand pressure suffices].

Be sure to grease the connections liberally, and to spend some time fine
tuning the connection at the rear coupling. I found minute changes had a
large effect on smoothness of shifting and driveability.

This procedure is not detailed in the shop manuals [except the rear
adjustment], but exploded views are available. I found the hardest part was
freeing up corroded hex head bolts [thank you Louisiana].

Although I didn't get to put many miles on the new set up [thanks again
Louisiana], I noticed improvement in ease and consistency of shifting
immediately.

Good Luck.

Well, the VIN indicates that it is a 76 model.  To discover which engine, 
check the engine block (main case) on the passenger side where the 
trannie mounts up.  If the engine number is visible stamped onto a 
diag stripe to the rear of the airbox, it's a 1.8.  If your number is in 
from of the oil filler/vent (front part of the compartment) on the 
driver's side of the split, it's a 2.0.

If the car is true and doesn't smoke, you could pull an easy $3,500 for 
the vehicle in the Phoenix area.  In Florida, you could probably get 
$4,000.  In Texas or California, it'll probably net $2,500-$2700.

These numbers come from ads that I've seen followed by checks on what the 
car sold for (after I'd missed out!).

Subject: Slipping/sliding/turning/"quick ones"


As Stan keeps saying, DIVERSITY IS A FEATURE.

Thanks to all who contributed constructively (with physical explanations and/or
with hand waving) that BEST TRACTION BETWEEN TIRES AND ROAD IS USUALLY AT A
SMALL SLIP, and that tire friction may be anisotropic. Most of your
explanations agreed with my personal observations, until Larry Herman's post on
slipping and sliding. Larry, I was hoping you were going to write something on
my questions. With your answers all is now crystal clear. Thank you very much. 

I have experienced the fun factor of sliding more than you need for the fun of
it (but it isn't faster). I agree the best way to learn to drive faster is by
practicing. But I never said that the only purpose of the question was to drive
faster. I wanted to understand the physical mechanisms better. That's a
prerequisite (for me); now I can try to learn to drive faster through practice.
(Thanks again, Larry).
       
I do not agree that I should not try to understand the physical principles
that govern my car's behavior, or that I should not try to explain "carve",
"pitch", and other hand waving terms with correct physics. Notice, I am willing
to learn this "language" and relate it to something I understand. Also notice,
I do not demand that everyone else learns my terms. If you can not follow my
terms,  do what I do when I am bored with your hand waving: move on to the next
message. 


Now some minor non-important excursions for the "quick ones":

1. At the end of the original post I said I was going to strap my helmet on and
go for some experiments. Read again, I have a helmet. It is not a desk
ornament. Over and out on this one. 

2. I have not been to as many track events as some of the people  who replied
to the post.  Unlike some on the list, I can not go to all of these events
offered around here (I chose to spend some of my time on other interests).     
I also make part of my living by asking questions others don't usually think
about, then using theory and experiments to give correct answers to them. 
Unlike my training, in the auto-X and drivers ed events I relied on "seat of
the pants measurements", because  I am not serious enough about these events to
buy a g analyst.  That's my choice. But I still wanted to understand the
answers to the questions I posted. That's also MY choice. Thanks to your
replies, I now have some of the answers. Isn't that one of the main goals of
this list? 

3. I think I now know my car's limit, and the only way to go faster around
corners with the present suspension setup is to improve my line and to learn to
keep the car at the limit longer and at the right times/locations through the
curves. But I can assure you, if  I ever chose to accomplish this, it will not
be the biggest accomplishment of my life. My Porsche (or driving it or racing
it) is not my main reason for living. It is an interesting and fun, but SMALL
part of my life that I LOVE,  no more and no less. I think it's the same for
many members of the list. 

4. In circular motion: 
Centripetal acceleration = omega**2 X r = (car velocity)**2 / r 
(because car velocity = omega X r). 
That means that the higher the centripetal acceleration the higher the car
velocity with which one exits a turn of radius r. That's what! Usually  one
wants to exit the turn pointing in the "right" direction for the next turn 
(that determines the *instantaneous* radius) with maximum possible velocity, ie
maximum centripetal acceleration, while still able to put traction down to
accelerate/decelerate/turn as needed. Same is true with vectors (accounting for
the slip angles etc). Your mileage may vary depending on car, track etc, but
when all the hand waving is done, and all is accounted for, the physical
explanation  will always be the same. Correct application of F=ma and  of 
Torque= Inertia X angular acceleration, in vector form.

There is no way to tell from the chassis vin. what is the leading alpha on
the engine serial number. For a 2.0 should be a GC Also easy way to tell are
the sparks plugs coming out of the top of the heads, then it is a 1.8. If
plugs are coming out of the side toward the outside of the car then it is a 2.0.

Never buy any porsche until you have a p-car mechanic ck it out. These cars
are expensive to repair.

Subject: 914 collection for sale

I'm selling my fathers complete 914 collection. Here's what I
have...this is all from memory, but If there is enough interest I could
spend a couple hours/days and make a complete list.=20
The big stuff:=20
'71 914 1.7 Silver/brown interior. This car is not running.  The engine
is good, all original.  I believe the trans is bad.  The car is
partially dissasembled...all chrome and most interior is out.  The
windshield is busted and the car is rustred in the usual
places...rockers..trunk. Also there is a little damage to the FT RT
fender...I think it's from light contact with a snow plow....very
minor!  It has the Fuchs alloys...I think...the have a sort of four
star effect to them. '75 or=20
'76 914 1.8 Orange/Black interior.  I'm not sure of the year, but is
one of the two because of the bumper style. This cars is in running
condition...but, not roadworthy. It is very rusty in the rockers, but
that's it.  It would make for a good restoration project...if you like
to weld...like my dad!  Most everything is there!=20
'73 914 2.0....Primer. OK, I know this one will generate the bulk of
the interest. It can we say has been slightly modified.  916 flares
(glass), 916 read, IMSA Front dam, wide rockers.  This has potential to
be a very nice custom conversion.  No expense was spared.  All custom
work was done by my dad...Oh, I forgot to mention we owned a body
shop...so this was not some "back yard project."  The engine has been
reworked, but I don't have the details...and, it has been sitting for a
while (5-6 years) so I would say "open it up!"  I know that it is 2.4
liters now...so use your imagination.  I have new Dellorto 45's and
other misc STUFF to finish the engine. The car is sitting on 8X15
reproduction Porsche alloys..chrome/black & painted center caps..with
Goodyear Gatorbacks in 225/50ZR15. This is a BIG project and I have a
lot of Misc parts to complete it.=20

The Little stuff:
'73 2.0 engine...intact.  It had Weber 44 carbs on it
2.0 Bus engine
Extra side shift tranny...maybe two
Other assorted stuff....half of it...I don't know what it is!=20

All of this is in Milwaukee, WI=20

Here is what I'm looking to do.=20
=A5 Sell all....best offer
=A5 Sell the cars and include the rest for free....best offer
=A5 Trade...I give you all...you give me ONE running/driving 914 2.0
  in good mechanical shape...no rust...but, I don't care much about
  cosmetics
=A5 Trade...I give you all...you complete the mechanical work on the '73
  that I have.  Complete and install engine...make it run and drive.
  I'll finish the rest.  I simply don't have the time/place/tools/knowlege=
=20
  of the engine work required.

I don't have any pictures right now....but I'll make some in the
next week. I can scan them and post or e-mail if anyone is interested.

I'm not sure how many negatives to stack up while parsing this, but
I think that you and I are in agreement on this point. If you understand
the theory behind the vehicle dynamics of interest, then you have the
opportunity to become a better driver without having to actually drive!
Of course, practice is the only thing that makes "perfect" - actually
it's making the doing of the right thing "automatic" that makes practice
so essential. That, and, of course, the opportunity to verify or debunk
the theory.

This is one of those unavoidable subjects. Like, why haven't I been on
track for two years? The answer is clear - I have no life. I traded it
for a house three years back. I tried to pretend I had a life the first
year, and actually improved my lap times by 4% over the year before.
But reality came flooding in, and I can no longer deny it. I have no life,
and I will be painting walls this weekend.

This rather sounds like a response to my question of "so what?" - the
fact is that the centripetal acceleration is the same for given r & v
whether you are "carving", "slipping", "skidding", spinning, dancing,
or whatever. That's not the point: the point is, how high can you make
the v given the r? That comes from an entirely different set of equations.

> Usually  one

Hardly ever, except in autox. Normally, one wants to think about the
next turn, but the exit of this one is more important in terms of
the speed with which you enter the straight. 

For a concrete (well asphalt anyway) example, Big Bend at Lime Rock is taken
in such a way that you track out all the way driver's left onto the short
chute. However, the next turn is a left-hander (the only one that counts).
So you have to crab back over to the right to set up for it. But you don't
care about that much, because if you come out of Big Bend on driver's right,
you have no speed. Those who track out and then crab over will eat your
lunch.

Otherwise real sharp. Options: 16 wheels, front & rear spoiler.
Asking price $23,000 (seems firm). Would like to stay around $21,000
but don't think I can get it that low.

Appreciate any input on from group.

Was a limited slip differential a factory option and is there any

Hi Triet, here in the USA we are expected to aim a little higher.  The
concept has the quaint name of "equal justice under law", and is highly
enough thought of to be chiseled into the marble outside of the Supreme
Court.  Through our history there are obviously MANY examples of falling
short of this ideal... and nobody could pretend we're anywhere close to
it even now.  The important thing (the thing that made the U.S. absolutely
unique in 1776, and relatively unique today) is that we KEEP AIMING FOR
THIS IDEAL.  It's part of the social contract here.  That contract is
sadly weakened each time someone advocates playing a more opportunistic
game, as you have done above.  

No ethnic comparison intended, I'd respond the same if your sig said "Joe
Bob".  EVERYONE has a role to play in keeping the ideal alive. 

Now let's get back to Porsches.

Just wanted to thank Jim Pasha for the post on the M474
suspention from Denny Kahler.

I just put these KONI's on my '87 944S and it made an 
amazing difference in the handeling.  If you own a 944
with standard suspension you should really look into the
M474 parts.  

When I ordered the parts from Denny he still had quite a
few sets left.

(from Jim's original post):
Here's what you get for $399.00:

        2 Koni Adjustable gas front struts (not inserts)
        2 Koni Adjustable gas rear shocks
        2 Eibach 250 lb coil springs (fit the new struts)
        2 Upper spring mounts
        2 Front shock boots.

This will fit all 85.5 and later 944, 924S, 951 and 968 with no 
modifications. 

If you have an earlier 924, 924 turbo (four wheel disc brake only) or 
944, the front struts can be modified. Rear shocks for the steel rear 
trailing arms require the rubber center from your present shock to be 
pressed in.

Call Denny Kahler at (510) 829-2050 for info and details.

Same comments I give to everyone NEVER buy any porsche without having a
porsche mech ck it out. Since these cars are really expensive to fix,
repair, rebuild, it is worth your $200 to have them cked out. Front tires
wornout in 52,000 not sure if this a problem or not. Fronts don't normally
wear on a 911.

Limited slips are an option but not sure what years. easy way to tell if
there is one is jack up the back and turn one of the wheels if the other
turns in the same direction should have a limited slip.

I can top that...

I'll add my bit to this thread. Here in New York City, KEEP THOSE FRONT 
PLATES ON!. I recently got a $75, (yes, $75) ticket for not having my 
front license plate attached to my front bumper.
However, it was on the dashboard and CLEARLY visible from the front of
the vehicle. I was on the entrance ramp to the Manhattan Bridge when the
*pig* signaled me to pull over. I was scared sh*tless (first time pulled over)
but was very polite to the officer. As is typical of NYC he was an power
obsessed Nazi type. (complete a**hole)

 (see what the did in DC, hey, they visited, we live with them!)

Needless to say I'm fighting the ticket like any other respectable 
pre-law student would do. The fine is so high because it is counted as a 
moving violation, the vehicle being in motion brings the fine to $75 as 
opposed to $25 had it been parked. The ticket doesn't carry any points on 
the license (thankfully, 18year old, single male... need I say more) Even 
the clerk at the DMV was shocked at the ticket being issued in the first 
place as well as the astronomical fine.

In closing, * keep those front license plates on * because it only gives 
the *pigs* one more reason to hastle you.

I have a "novice" observation to make on this subject.  I am familiar
with the above discourse on slip angles (I have the worn out tires
to prove it :>0).  My car noticably "drifts" at speed on the track.  OK.
Watching alot of F1 races, though, I never seem to notice those cars'
tires developing large slip angles.  The car seems to follow the 
tires really closely (seemingly very small slip angles).  Of course,
they go through tires faster than I do, so there must be some decent
slip going on there.  

Is this an optical illusion, or are race cars in general not "drifting"
as much as the rest of us?

Just curious...

The key here is the warranty that AA supplies.  You are getting a

These are both good prices, but I'd wager that they are from 
wrecked/junked cars and are of dubious heritage.  If you were planning to 
rebuild it yourself, the cheaper plants would be a good deal.  If you're 
looking for something that can just be bolted in, then the AA engine is 
the way to go.

     A friend asked me to fix his DME unit-it seems the idle was 
     jumping around and the cruise control no longer held a 
     steady speed.
     
     Before probing into the electronics i had him crank it up in 
     order to observe the symptoms and check for obvious stuff 
     like loose ground wires.  During the exam i found a cracked 
     vacuum hose coming off the back side of the throttle.  There 
     is a brass tube out the back of the rubber boot that runs to 
     the left side of the engine toward the cruise control 
     'motor'.  At the end of the 12" long brass tube is a 2" long 
     piece of molded rubber hose, and this hose was cracked and 
     leaking air.  Its easy to find and fix.  Just replace the 
     rubber with hose from autoshack--Very cheap$$$.
     
     Just for fun i checked my own and about 8 other 911s--and to 
     my surprise they were all cracked in the same place!  It 
     looks like a case where the rubber has gotten hard and

Subject: 944 Clutch Story

     This Spring i bought and repaired an '86 944 that suffered 
     the worst case of a lack of maintenance blues.
     
     The owner called and asked me to go down to the repair shop 
     where he had towed the car.  They had told him the repairs 
     would cost about $8k and he had nearly shat on himself. 
     
     "For want of a nail the shoe was lost."
     
     This 944 needed everything replaced from the flywheel back-- 
     the clutch,pp,t.o. bearing, Torque Tube and drive shaft, and 
     transaxle.  And the reason--his brake/clutch  reservoir got 
     low and he didn't know, and he didn't replace the flywheel 
     pilot bearing when he had the clutch replaced.
     
     But it wasn't entirely his fault.  He had help.
     
     Open up your Haynes Manuals to p142.   (Congregation is 
     flipping pages)  to Figure 8.3,  where they show the vise 
     grip pliers used to clamp the fluid line to the clutch 
     master cylinder.  Yes someone used vise grips to clamp the 
     line and yes it cut little slices into the line which leaked 
     fluid and allowed air into the system.  
     
     i don't know how he could have driven without a full throw 
     of the clutch, but he did.  i asked him if he didn't notice 
     any noises and grinding, grumbling etc., but he had a killer 
     radio and said he never heard a thing.  
     
     The splines on the end of the driveshaft were wallowed out 
     to nubs, and big chunks of ringinpinion gears washed out of 
     the transaxle drain.
     
     So pay attention to those noises, keep your fluid levels up, 
     and don't skimp on pilot bearings (i know the clutches are 
     expensive).
     
     And one final note to those that need to know--yes a 944 
     turbo transaxle will fit perfectly in a non-turbo 944, and 
     the limited slip differential is really nice too.

Mike,

I would say that your observations are quite correct.  F1 cars, as well as
Indy cars and other lightweight, ground-effected, winged cars do corner with
a minimum of slide.  Don't forget that they have hundreds of pounds of
aerodynamic downforce to give the tires extra grip, and according to a Penske
Race Engineer/Crew Chief that I know, the tires that they run are designed to
work with less slip angle than typical tires.  Even with the lack of sliding,
they are really leaning on the tires to develop the 2.5+ G forces that they
do under hard cornering.  Larger sedans without wings do corner more like
what we are driving.  BTW, if you want to see some real slip angles, just
watch a NASCAR race 8{).

Subject: 944 stub axle bolts-warning

I had a dangerous experience this weekend at the Brain Redman Jefferson 500
which, BTW is an event that no one should miss if they are on the right
coast. Millions of $$ of exotic machinery. Where else can you watch a guy
totally destroy a GT40 Ford, but that's another story.
Anyway while traveling down the main straight I suddenly became aware that
the car started to steer itself. Though a tire was going down so I pitted and
did the usual walk around. Nothing obvious until I wiggled all the wheels. To
my horror the left rear wheel could be moved easily in any direction. Seems
that the stub axle nut had come loose. In later model 944's there is no
castellated nut and cotter pin that is familiar to 911 drivers. The nut is
totally dependent on torque and allot of it (over 360 ft lbs I believe). The
scary part is that as part of my teching for the weekend I had checked that
nut and it was tight.
Because of the direction of rotation the left side is prone to this loosening
while the right side will stay snug. 
Bottom line is that if you run a 944 based car please check that nut. It
could be catastrophic. People who do Tech at drivers Ed please take note and
add this to you check list

Subject: Re: Slip Angles, Fast Cornering, Etc

By golly, Larry, I think you've almost got it!

Larry Herman says: "So the front is understeering and the rear is
oversteering??? (Herman's really lost it now, out of control, spinning off
of the logic track, crash and burn, fire up the flame throwers, let's
finish him off!). No, this is REALLY what happens, it's called a 4 wheel
drift, and both the front end, and the back end are sliding, and the car is
developing maximum cornering power. If only the front end were sliding, the
car would be understeering, and not using the rear to full potential.  And
if only the rear were sliding, it would be oversteering, and not using the
front to full potential. In an extreme case of oversteer, where the driver
has to countersteer to keep up with the slide, the front develops no slip
angle at all, and like it or not, this is slow. It may feel neat, but...."

The old 4-wheel drift -- funny, no one mentioned it before -- but that's
where it at! Higher speed is a prerequisite to a 4-wheel drift, and it's a
very unnatural act because it doesn't come naturally by itself. Unlike
understeer or oversteer, or a frightening sequence of one and then suddenly
the other when entering a high speed turn, the car will not conveniently
take a 4-wheel drift without help. I think you've got to create it -- like,
by pitching the car (I don't know "carving," maybe in this situation it
means the same thing). By "pitching the car" to achieve a 4-wheel drift, I
don't mean you yank on the steering wheel to send the car into a gross
slip-angle and then try to correct with gobs of opposite-lock steering
correction. An early turn-in combined with cracking the throttle to cause
over-steer followed by immediate opposite-lock throttle steering will begin
a 4-wheel drift. Once a drift is begun, skilled car-control with constant
and subtle steering change (sawing) is required to maintain it through the
turn onto the next straight.

The really good drivers can provoke a drift well in advance of the normal
turn-in point so that, once they reach the turn, they can take a late apex
while maintaining the drift. I didn't really understand "drift" until I saw
Jody Scheckter in a Formula 5000 at Laguna Seca going through Turn 2 (the
old course) at very high speed. It was the most awesome, blazing 4-wheel
drift I'd ever seen. At first I thought he'd lost it, but he did it lap
after lap without losing the tires. Among contemporary drivers, Hans Stuck
comes to mind as a great "drifter."

If you want to see drifting up close and personal, go to a kart race on a
fast track and watch the 80-shifters. The winner will be a "pitch 'n catch"
artist. But I doubt he (or she) can tell you the percentage of slip angle,
or even cares, for that matter.

Sigh. If you're *REALLY* starving, then $50 a tire is not a bad price, 
but don't expect any more performance out of the tires. Believe me,
putting that much rubber in one place for $50 all the performanance *THAT*
vendor can manage...

Have you looked at mail order tires? Discount Direct and The Tire Rack
routinely have the best prices in the known universe. Also, your choice
of size is *SEVERELY* limiting your choices and inflating the price. Try
looking in 185/70x15 or even 195/65x15. You should be able to buy *GREAT*
tires in the $68-80 range...

Yup, that'll do it.  Found that out by accident one day when I left the driver's

sitting in the puddle, and didn't plug the seat cushion switch in.  Lo, and

Subject: 69 912 Starting Problems

A friend of mine recently brought a 1969 912 out of storage. The car
belonged to his father-in-law and had been in the garage for about 5-6
years. As best as I can tell the car was not preped for such a long idle
stint. (His father-in-law died enexpectedly with the car in the garage).
When the car was brought out of storage it was taken for a full tune up,
oil change, draining of the old gas, ect. After a week the petrol take had
to be taken off and resealed as well. The problem with the car now is cold
starting. My friend claims it takes almost 10 minutes of cranking to get
the car started. Once warm the car runs great and it starts without a
hitch. The mechanic told him just to drive the car for a while to let some
of the build-up burn out.....Does this make sense given the car runs great
once started and starts fine at operating temp????? any ideas? Thanks.

Subject: Stub Axle Nuts

Jerry's warning re stub axle nuts loosening on 944s actually applies to any
Porsche using an "upset" (i.e., non-castellated) rear stub axle nut.  I'm
safety chair for our PCA region and do about 90% of the pre-event tech
inspections.  Last year, our region began having an epidemic of rear axle
nuts loosening on 911s of '84 and newer vintage. Upon investigation, it
turned out these had all happened on cars which had needed rear wheel
bearings replaced (including my '88 911).  I bit the bullet and purchased
Arnie, my 600 lb/ft yard-long torque wrench, properly torqued the nuts and
the problem disappeared.  Apparently the shops (including our local dealer)
which had done the wheel bearing replacements hadn't properly torqued the
nuts when they were done.

If you have a car using non-castellated stub axle nuts and have had a rear
wheel bearing replaced, be sure to find someone with the proper tool and
have the torque checked.  The proper torque is 330 lb/ft on the 3.2 Carrera
series cars.

I own a Porsche repair shop in Fl. and encounter 944's loosing oil all of the
time it is usually either those oil cooler seals, which an updated part has
been manufactured for made out of viton and should last forever, or it can be
valve guides and seals but only usually on high mileage cars, or last it can
be the cam tower to head gasket, which will leak down on to the exhaust and
you will usually smell it, but not see it in the ddrivway because it burns

Subject: Re: Help:rear wheel bearing 951

I do the all the time, and dont use a press. First take the new bearing over
to your freezer, and drop it in your ice box, then dissassemble the rear
t-arm hammer out the hub with a large driver, if you dont have one that big
use a piece of 1.5 in o.d. bar stock. next remove the bearing retaining
bolts, and hammer out the bearing and its races, one of the races may have
come off with the hub, maybe if you were lucky the entire bearing came off
with the hub. next with some 220 emry cloth lightly polish out the inside of
the t-arm. next heat up the t-arm where the bearing will go back in, heat it
quite a bit dont be afraid to heat it this will temporareily expand the id of
the arm and remember the bearing is doing the opp. in the frig. when the arm
is good and hot go grab the bearing with pliers, not your hands or they will
warm it up, and have a brass hammer and a block of wood ready.  if you got
the t-arm hot enough, the bearing will slide right in, then give it time to
cool before you do anything else.  if it only slides half way or so grab the
bolck and hammer and bang it in the rest of the way. then reassemble and use
red locktite on those bearing ret. screws, and the stub nut.  ps dont hit the
center of the bearing under any circ. while driving it in, thats why you need
the block so it hammers on the outer edge of the bearing.  and use the stub
axel and nut to pull the hub back in.

good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi everyone,

I'm slowly fixing the little things that need attending to on my recent
purchase.

The next step is to replace the heat exchangers.  I have been offered a set
from a 3.2 Carrera, and also a pair of pre '74 units.  I understand that the
later, while being a louder, also provide a hp advantage.  Is this
significant?  Will either of these options require other tuning alterations
to the engine.  While I want to do some 'relaxed' club level racing, I don't
want to turn it into a race car.  Note that the car is what you would call a
euro model (no cat convertors etc, and none required by law either).

Any comments on these, or any other, options would be most appreciated.
Particularly from anyone who has done it.

TIA

Subject: 911: Warped rotor

Your advice please,
 My '86 Carrera with 70K miles has a slightly warped front rotor (warped 
when I bought it).  The car looks to have been driven very gently - very 
old tires with lots of tread and the transmission shifts very easily. I have
a couple of questions:

1. Is it likely that one rotor would warp and not the other ?  Basically,
I'm concerned that the warping may have been caused by some problem
that would just cause a new rotor to warp (like a dragging brake pad).

2. Should I change both front rotors at the same time, or is it OK
to just change the "bad" one ?  (I'm on a fiscal austerity program.)

Subject: Don't Feed The Bears

Just thought I'd share this -- it's a compilation of several of the P'phile
posts that went to PCA regional newsletter editors.

Going To The '95 Parade? Don't Feed The Bears!
by various Porschephiles

Planning your trip to the 1995 Porsche Parade in Portland? If so, no matter
which route you take, you'll see wonderful country once you reach Oregon, a
state also famous for its bear population. The four-legged variety have
long, shaggy fur and a five-toed foot. The two-legged variety also have a
five-toed foot, wear a flat-brimmed hat, and are terribly skilled at using
devices like radar, airplanes, and unmarked cars. In either case, please do
not feed the bears!

Recently on Porschephiles, an Internet mail list, we had a "discussion"
about the consequences of exceeding the posted speed limits in Oregon. The
consensus was, Don't Exceed The Posted Speed Limit! Save your extra cash
for the Parade Goodie Store. Here's some of the contributed tidbits.

Jim Bauman: "Having run the gauntlet of I-5 through Oregon for the last 26
years, I can attest to the proactive attitude of the Oregon Highway Patrol.
Especially around a place called Cottage Grove. They will use an airplane
and about 8 to 10 cars in their revenue collecting efforts. They line up on
the on ramp like taxis at an airport. It's really quite a sight!"

Jim goes on to say, "If anyone is looking for an alternative for I-5, I
highly recommend Highway 395 north out of Reno, Nevada, all the way to the
Columbia River, then west on the freeway. It's quite incredible, especially
through southern Oregon where it's basically a desert. Or, go north on
Highway 395 from Reno and cut over towards Mt. Shasta, California. Another
incredible journey."

Mike Lommatzsch added to the discussion, "And to those driving through the
state of Oregon to get to the Parade, be especially aware of your speed. I
understand tickets for only 65 mph can cost in the two hundred dollar range
and out of state plates are a magnetic for the officers. In March, my
mother (who lives in Oregon) sent me a clipping from a local newspaper
about this poor guy from Idaho Falls who was doing 85 mph when he was
stopped near Baker (eastern Oregon). The actual bail amount printed on his
ticket was $334. Elsewhere in the article it states that the new, steep
fines for doing between 11 to 20 mph over the speed limit are $329."

Bob Pentecost reported, "I was in Oregon a couple of weeks ago during the
Inland Northwest Region/Pacific Northwest Region Yakima Valley Winery Tour
and saw a billboard that showed the fines for speeding. I recall something
like: 1-10 mph over the limit is $180; 11-20 over is $350. I think there
were four lines of figures. This was on I-84 in the eastern part of the
state."

Local Steve Poole gave this advice: "I drive between Seattle and Newberg
(south of Portland) fairly often and am now pretty careful in Oregon
because they recently DOUBLED the price of tickets! I haven't had one, so
can't say what the exact amounts are, but I believe that 20 or 30 mph over
the I-5 limit can now cost you several hundred dollars. I-205 around
Portland seems to be pretty heavily patrolled, and there are numerous sweet
spots for speed traps, especially for those of us who like high speed
sweeping curves. Washington ticket prices are doubled if the ticket is
issued in a work zone. Oregon does something similar."

Steve also gave his first-hand report: "I just returned yesterday from my
first Seattle-Newberg-Seattle run in the 911. Great weather both ways, and
it was a blast! My favorite moment was being passed on a slight downhill by
some ratty Honda boltbucket. About seven seconds later the BEL shrieked
twice and I hit the brakes hard to drop to about 65. At almost exactly the
same time, a Washington patrol car came smoking off the left shoulder just
ahead of me, where it had been hiding behind some bridge struts. I thought
he was going to nab me, but he accelerated past and the next time I saw him
was on the right shoulder where he was looking with extreme displeasure at
a certain Honda driver. Wahoo!"

And, finally, Volney Spalding had this to share: "Oregon is highly
proactive in their revenue collection activities as has been mentioned here
- -- aircraft, radar, and unmarked cars. On the other hand, much of the state
is rural and 65 mph is in effect a healthy percentage of the time. Watch
out for the temporary 55 mph zones when you approach populated areas.
Southern Oregon between Roseburg and Grant's Pass (about 100 miles) has
some fun driving (for an Interstate) on I-5 in low traffic conditions.
There is a series of minor 'mountain' passes around 1000 to 1500' -- about
4 or 5 of them. Makes for some great winding uphill runs. There are always
two lanes in your direction and it can be a fun ride if not too many big
rigs, RV's and country squire wagons are on the road."

Volney continues, "I-5 from Redding California to the Oregon Border is also
a lot of fun and is also 65 mph. The Northern CA CHP in this region can be
quite attentive and will line up several Mustang pursuit cars. You'll have
at least two lanes each way and the scenery is great all through the
Siskiyou Mountains with Mt. Shasta, Lake Shasta, and Castle Crags all in
easy view from the Interstate. Just north of the Oregon border on I-5, be
careful going past Medford. It's one of those temporary 55 mph zones and it
seems the State Police are always around."

Volney has this advice for coffee fans: "Take note that you are never far
away from excellent coffee! The Northwest has come to take their coffee
seriously in the last ten years, and you can find espresso even in remote,
small towns. Stores with names like, 'Dave's Bait, Tackle and Espresso,'
(I'm not making this up) are not uncommon. You can get great coffee almost
anywhere to help you stay awake and watchful for speed traps."

Volney also has a favorite alternate route. "For a serious excursion,
not-for-the-weak-of-stomach, take Highway 199 between Grant's Pass, Oregon,
and the California Coast. It's one of the connectors between I-5 and the
coast highway (Highway 101). It's actually backtracking as you have to go
way south to go north, but we're talking serious mountains -- very remote.
No matter what route you take to get to 101, you won't be disappointed as
the southern Oregon coast is stunning, particularly between the California
border and Port Orford, Oregon. Be aware that 101 is not an interstate and
is 55 mph the whole way."

So, there you have it. Go to the Parade -- don't speed -- and don't feed
the bears.

tta.com.  Comments are welcome, as are more questions!

914 FAQ v. 2.1
5/9/95          Dave Darling (darling@simlab.arc.nasa.gov)
                With help from George Hussey (Dr914@aol.com) and
                much of the Pfiles mailing list

1) What the Heck is a 914, anyway?
        914 is the designation given to several types of production cars
made by Karmann, VW, and Porsche in the early- and mid-70's.  All had mid-
mounted engines, for good weight distribution and low polar moment.  Most
were roadsters, with a detachable Targa top.  All have excellent cornering
ability.  Many people have called it "the square Porsche," since it
departs from the traditional (Porsche) curved look of the 356es and 911s.
I have also received some ribbing about not being able to tell the back
of the car from the front.

2) So what is this "-4" or "1.8" or "/6" designation, then?
        When it was introduced in 1969 (1970?), there were two types
available.  The 914/4 used a fuel-injected 1.7 liter "pancake" four-
cylinder engine derived from that used in the VW 411.  The 914/6 came
with a de-tuned carbeurated 2.0 liter engine derived from that used by
the 1969 911T.  The /6 did not sell very well, and was dropped after
the 1972 model year.  The 1972 914/6 is somewhat rare--only about 240
were made--and was never exported to the US.
        In 1973, Porsche introduced a 2.0 liter four-cylinder model.
Early information labeled it as the "914 S", but this was dropped
shortly before or shortly after the model became available in the US.
The two versions were labeled by their displacement--the 914/1.7 and the
914/2.0.
        For 1974, the 1.7 was replaced by a 1.8, which used a different
type of fuel injection system in the US, and carbeurators elsewhere.
Power was lower than the earlier 1.7s, due primarily to emissions con-
trols.

3) Didn't I hear about a 914/8 somewhere?
        Yes, you probably did.  There were two very special 914s made by
the factory, using air-cooled eight-cylinder engines from the 908 race
car.  You can sometimes see one of them at the Porsche factory museum.
        The other type of 914/8 is a "regular" 914 which has had a water-
cooled V-8 engine, usually a Chevy, wedged into it.  We don't talk about
these cars because we're snobs.   8)   The V8 question has been debated a
number of times on Porschephiles.  The "official" consensus is that it
may be possible to do the conversion "right", but it is difficult and
there are many, many bad ones out there.  Also, a number of people object
to the generally inelegant way of dealing with the (water) radiator.

4) Okay, smart guy, what's a 916?
        In 1972, the Porsche factory made a number of cars that were
intended to be a prototype for a "super-car" 914.  These were the 916s.
They had the mechanically-injected 2.4 liter engine used in the 72-73
911 S, the large, boxy flared fenders from the 914/6 GT race car, fixed
steel roofs, and modified front and rear styling.  Some mounted front-
located oil coolers and a version of the 915 gearbox converted to run in
a mid-engined car.  They had super-plush interiors (leather or leather and
op-art fabric!) and some had power windows.  They were intended to be as
luxurious and top-of-the-line as possible.  One even had air conditioning
with the compressor behind the drivers seat!  There is some disagreement
over the exact number built, but the most authoritative source says that
there were 11 of them.

5) How hard is it to work on the engine?  That space looks awfully small!
        It is possible to perform all regular maintenance on a 914/4 with
the engine in the car.  The Sixes are supposed to be about twice as time
consuming as the Fours.  [Anyone want to loan me one for a year so I can
verify this?  8) ]  Spark plugs, timing, adding oil, and changing the air
filter are all straight-forward to do from the top.  Replacing plug wires
may require removing the air filter box, but that is either one bolt and a
hose clamp, or a couple of wire clips and a hose clamp.
        Transmission, oil filter, oil drain plug, sump screen, all are
easily acessed from underneath the car.  It is awkward to fit a standard
oil filter wrench on the 914's filter, but a BIG ol' pair of Channel-
Locks works just fine!
        Adjusting the valves is a chore.  At times, it seems as if *every-
thing* is in the way of getting to the valve covers!  However, it  is
possible to reach around everything and get to the adjusters.  Use a long
feeler gauge to check and set the clearance.  Have patience, and try sev-
eral different angles.  Removing the roadwheel on the side you are working
on can help.
        There are some things you just can't do with the engine in the
car.  Fortunately, it is not a difficult operation.  It only took me
about five hours my first time, and I'm a *complete* idiot!  An experienced
914 mechanic should be able to do it in as little as 30 minutes.  Most of
the time is spent "getting things out of the way."  Then remove four big
bolts, and carefully lower the engine and tranny down and out of the car.
(They come out as a unit--it's possible to do them separately, but just
about as easy to do both.)
        I'll let you know about putting it all back together when I've
actually done it myself.

6) What sort of options came on the 914 originally?
        Aah--I'll let someone with more experience than myself, George
Hussey of Automobile Atlanta (Dr914@aol.com), answer that in is own
words.

>Much confusion has occurred over the so-called appearance group offered
>as a 914 option. Packages were as follows:
>
>  1. Appearance group package '70-'72 and '73 1.7 models:  side vinyl,
>loop carpeting, chrome bumpers, leather wrapped wheel and shift knob,
>center deposit box, dual horns, driving lights and pedrinni alloy wheels
>  2. Appearance group '73 914 2.0 "S":  center console with gauges,
>armrest, storage box, loop carpeting, dual horns, chrome bumpers, fuchs
>alloy wheels, driving lights, front and rear sway bars, leather wrapped
>wheel and shift boot
>  3. Appearance group '74-'76 models:  center console with gauges,
>leather wrapped wheel and shift boot, side vinyl, dual horns, loop
>carpeting, armrest and storage box
>
>To keep the price lower in the later years, most equipment became
>optional.

        The 70-72 optional equipment was standard on the 914/6.
        Other information that I have indicates that the Factory split up
the 73 group into two separate groups for 74 and later.  One was the
"Sport Group" and comprised of alloy wheels, Bilstein shock absorbers,
and front and rear sway bars.  The other was the "Appearance Group" and
included all the rest of the 73 "S" stuff.
        In 1974, Porsche created a "Special Edition" or "Can-Am" version of
the 2.0L 914.  This car had all of the "regular" options, above, with one or
two differences.  There were three choices of paint scheme--white with orange
trim, white with green trim, or black with yellow trim.  A different front
spoiler was added below the front bumper.  Specially painted alloy wheels
were used, with accents matched to the trim color of the car.  They had
bumpers painted the trim color instead of chrome or black, as on the other
74 914s.  They did not have the vinyl rollbar trim, but did come with the
center console, leather shift boot, leather steering wheel, dual horns, and
the swaybars and Bilstein shocks which were optional on the other 914s.
These cars  are less common than other 914/4s, and are somewhat more valua-
ble as a result.

7) Can you compare the various 914/4's for me?

        A quick run-down of the US models:
Year  Displ  HP   F.I.   Comments
70,71 1.7L  80HP  D-Jet  Spartan interior, non-adjustable passenger
                         seat, non-retracting seat-belts, sloppy
                         shift linkage, cranky window winders . . .
72    1.7L  80HP  D-Jet  Some interior improvements.  Adjustable seat.
                         Late 72 first gets retractable seat belts.
                         Fuel pump moved lower in engine compartment
                         for less chance of vapor lock.
73    1.7L  80HP  D-Jet  "Late 914" introduced.  Side-shift transmission
                         shortens linkage, less sloppy.  Improved window
                         winders, better interior.
73    1.7L  72HP  D-Jet  Ditto, but with California emissions crap.
                         Lower HP from lower compression--to deal with
                         lower-octane gas.
73    2.0L  95HP  D-Jet  "914S" in some early ads.  Improved performance
                         from 2.0L engine.  All the optional goodies
                         were standard.  This is the one everyone wants.
74    1.8L  76HP  L-Jet  1.8 engine replaces 1.7.  Lower HP from lower
                         compression.  L-jetronic FI, viewed by many
                         as less reliable than 1.7 or 2.0 D-jet FI.
74    2.0L  95HP  D-Jet  Same as 73 2.0, but options weren't standard.
75    1.8L  76HP  L-Jet  Catalytic converter added for California.  5MPH
                         bumpers add weight, distributed toward ends.  EGR
                         on some  cars.  Fuel pump relocated to front of
                         car to reduce chance of vapor lock.
75-76 2.0L  90HP  D-Jet  Re-worked exhaust and heat exchangers lose power
                         and possibly engine longevity.  California models
                         get catalytic converter, 49-state get an air pump.
                         EGR may be on some cars.  Adds 5MPH bumpers as in
                         75 1.8L.  Fuel pump in front as in 75 1.8L.


8) What should I watch out for when looking to buy one?
        I'll try to run down the problem areas--my 1.8 pretty much has
all of them.  (Anyone wanna buy a 914, *cheap*?)
        Rust.  George Hussey has said, "There's no such thing as a rust-
free 914."  There might be one or two in the world, but they've probably
just gotten back from the body shop.  Particularly prone are the battery
box, on the right hand (passenger, in US) side of the engine compartment,
everything below that--which includes the right-rear suspension!  The
firewall in front of the battery, the jack points on the sides of the car,
the longitudinal members of the frame (the inner rockers), the rear of
the rear trunk floor, and just in front of the windscreen.
        Rust is the most common cause of body flex.  You can check for
flex with the "Dave's Big Butt Test."  Take the roof off the car.  Then,
get someone of Dave's size (230 lbs) or larger to sit in the passenger's
seat (the side with the battery!).  With the door closed, roll the window
up.  Then try to open the door.  If the window sticks at the top, the body
is flexing.  Also try the driver's seat.  Body flex is fairly bad news.
It can be cured, but it is generally time-consuming and expensive.
        Oil leaks are relatively common.  Some of the cures are cheap in
parts, but expensive in labor--e.g., oil galley plugs.  The oil pressure
idiot light sender, on top near the distributor, can leak.  Push rod tube
seals commonly leak--but can be replaced with the engine in the car!  Oil
cooler seals, the galley plugs, and the front or rear main seals are also
not uncommon.  The engine may need to be removed to fix these.
        The 914 is quasi-legendary for transmission woes.  Sloppy shifting
is part of the car's character, especially on the pre-73 cars.  Replacing
shift linkage bushings can help.  Short shift kits are also supposed to
help with this problem.  Many cars will crunch going into first gear.  Some
will also crunch going into second.  This may mean a rebuild is in the near
future.
        Tops leak--where the top seals join together.  Not always, but
frequently.  Check for signs of previous flooding.

9) How about carbeurators for a 914/4?  After all, the Sixes came
with 'em!
        Not if you live in California!  Other places are now following
the Left Coast's lead in emissions testing, so carb'ed 914s may soon
become illegal for street use in many places.
        A well-designed, properly-maintained FI system will give you
better performance, better start-up behavior, and better fuel economy.
Always.  The problems are in the "well-designed" (if you make changes to
your engine) and in the "properly-maintained" parts of that sentance.
        However, if you have modified your engine--for example with
higher displacement and compression, a wild cam, and killer exhaust--
the stock FI may not be able to keep up anymore.  Tweaking the FI is
difficult and time-consuming, and is illegal in many racing venues.
Therefore, carbs are the quick and easy answer.  After all, there are a lot
of people out there who know how to tweak carbs.
        A question you should ask yourself if you are thinking about
buying a carbed 914, even when it's street-legal, is "Why'd they do
that?"  Most frequently the answer is that the car had an FI problem
that the owner did not feel like dealing with, so he/she replaced the
whole induction system.  This sort of attitude *may* be indicative of
sloppy maintenance in general, and frequently these cars are in much
rougher shape overall than cars with operational FI.

10) So, which one should I buy?
        The 73 2.0, obviously.  But since it is so obvious, the price
is higher for these cars.  The 74 2.0, if it has the optional equipment,
is essentially identical.  Parts prices for the items unique to the
earlier 2.0, such as heads, exhaust and some FI parts, are more expensive
as well.
        Second choice would be either a later (75-76) 2.0 or a 49-state
73 1.7.  The former have more power and the front-mounted fuel pump, but
more weight and, higher polar moment, and seem to wear engines out
faster because the factory made them run hotter to pollute less.  The 76
2.0 is the very last of the 914s, and is fairly rare--only 4200 or so were
built.  These factors may drive the price up relative to the 75 models.
        Bringing up the rear are the rest.  This is mostly a matter of
taste.  The CA-emissions 1.7 is the weakling of the lot, but it does
have the interior improvements and the better transmission.  The 1.8 is
next in power, with all the refinements of the 1.7, but with a fuel
system that is less fault-tolerant.  In some ways, the L-Jetronic system
is superior to the D-Jet, but careful attention must be paid to avoid vac-
cuum leaks, backfires, and corroded relays.  The early 1.7 has more power,
but is less civilized and has the vague tail-shifter transmission.

11) What's this about Side-shifters?
        Up until the 73 model year, the shift forks on the 914 transmis-
sions were on the end of the tranny case, all the way at the back of the
car.  This meant that the linkage had to go from about 2/3 of the length
of the car and through numerous interconnected parts.  This is the so-
called "tail-shifter" transmission.
        In 73, the shift forks were moved to the side of the tranny case.
The linkage only had to travel about 1/2 the length of the car, and didn't
have as many angles to reach around.  It also had far fewer interconnected
parts to break or go out of adjustment.  This improved the shifting
dramatically.  This is called the "side-shifter" transmission.

Subject: Re: slip angles

In a bit different context of rally racing one can see rather  
spectacular 4-wheel drift. Indeed seems that the way to drive an  
all-wheel drive car really fast on unpaved roads is what they call  
something like "leaning on the door". This means that the car heads  
to where the front right corner points (the co-pilots may not  
necessarily like this so they are just encouraged to watch the  
map...) The drivers practice this on straight pieces of road as  
well. As the traction isn't great i.e. there is some slip anyway by  
enforcing it the driver keeps the revs at the best part of the  
torque/power curve.

Subject: Bleeding ABS equipped 951 brakes

Hello Fellow Porschephiles;

This message did not make it through last time so hewre it goes again.  I 
promise I will send in my $50 this week.

During my last Driver's Ed event in April I noticed increasing brake pedal 
effort was required as the event progressed.  I assumed this was due to some 
brake fade and normal pad wear.  I have stock pads.

After the event I bought a Mity-Vac brake bleeding tool because my SO got tired 
of pumping the brake pedal when I needed to bleed the brakes.  I assumed I could 
get back the normal hard pedal feel by bleeding the brakes and adding new fluid.  
After using my new tool, the brake pedal is still not as firm as it was before 
the track event.

Is there a secret to bleeding an ABS equipped 951 that I might have missed, or 
is increased pedal effort a fact of life as pads wear?  I bled out several 
ounces of fluid and bled both valves on each caliper.  I did not bleed the 
clutch.  Is there another way to get back the firm brake pedal feeling?  Any 
pointers would be appreciated.  TIA.

Subject: 914 parts questions

	This is a three parter:
1. Does anyone have a pair of the solid outer engine mounts for the
late model ('73+) 914 engine bar which they would be willing to part
with?(I'm talking about the smallish metal plates which the engine
bar bolts to and then it bolts to the chassis) My initial inqueries
to the usual comercial sources have come up short, although I haven't
exausted all of them yet.

2. Does anyone know which model 911 front brake calipers bolt to the
914 struts?(I know we went through the pros and cons earlier, but we
never went into application specifics) I've heard 911T, but this
doesn't completely clarify things for me as I'm not that familiar
with 911 parts and there are several different year dependant 911
calipers. A part number(or pair of) would be the most help.

3. Along the same lines as the previous question, will early model
(year?) 911 front sway bars bolt up to a 914? I've seen that the
aftermarket bars apply to both 914 and 911, but I don't know if the
factory design is the same.

If anyone has attempted either of these 911 to 914 parts swaps, I'd
appreciate your input so that I don't attempt to re invent the wheel.
Yes, a complete front end swap would be the most desireable route,
but I don't want to do the 5 lug conversion right now.
(FYI, I know someone who has these parts collecting dust and is
willing to give them to me for a handshake and a sincere "thanks",
but I don't have time to tear the front end of my 914 apart for a
pipe dream)

Subject: Re: Help:rear wheel bearing 951

Hi Jerry,

Lou's posting pretty much sums it up.  I would heat the trailing arm
before pushing out the old bearing, though, and not just for the new
one.

The factory would have you take the arm off the car and use a press
to remove and replace.  This is fine but is a lot of extra labor.

Regarding the stub axle nut, this is sort of a known problem and seems
to particularly affect turbos -- no idea why.  My technique, for want
of a better description, for checking has been to jump up and down a
little bit on a breaker bar.  I also mark my nut/stub with a slash of
paint, making it pretty clear when/if the nut has loosened.

Porsche's lock nuts seem to be good for only a couple of uses, then they
no longer lock and will back off.  This is true, for example, of the
M14's they use at the top of the front strut.  It is certainly true of
the M12's used on the front strut camber bolts.  My advice would be to
always replace them, rather than reuse.  They're cheap enough.

This may be a feature of the type of lock nut Porsche uses, which gets
an interference fit by virtue of an oval distortion of the far end.
Carroll Smith claims that Nylocks, on the other hand, can be reused
indefinitely.

I don't know too many people with torque wrenches that will read 330
ft lbs.  I think everyone pretty much eyeballs it with an airgun.  We
picked up such a torque wrench last week, though.  The 944GTR now under
our care has titanium 90 mm centre-lock nuts that want to be torqued
to 440 ft lbs, thank you.

Two plates stories.
I also live in NYC and last year during one of the big storms my car was 
embalmed in snow. When the snow/ice melted, the resulting glacier drift slid 
off the hood of the car taking the front plate with it. The plate was 
clearly lying on the ground in front of the car and I received a $25 ticket 
anyway. Fought it and won.

On another occasion several years ago when NY changed from yellow and blue 
plates to the red, white and blue plates, I changed my rear plate and 
decided to keep the front plate the old series (vanity plates so both were 
the same). While waiting to cross and turn left at the busy intersection, a 
cop spotted the old plate and flagged me to make the turn (ending up in 
front of him). He promptly pulled me over and after a pleasant conversation 
I went home and changed the other plate.

Subject: Nuts


The mechanical distortion lock nuts, as used on the late 944 and 911
stub axles, are ONE-USE nuts. DO NOT re-use. Buy new, throw the old ones 
in the trash.

Kevin Gross makes a good point by marking the location and inspecting to 
see if the nut is backing off on a regular basis.

Nylocks may be reused if the nylon insert is not distorted or damaged. For
mission critical components, always use new locking fasteners (nuts and
wavy washers). Wavy washersa are good for two uses, then toss them. 

If the original fastener had Loctite or similar compound, find out what it
was, but it and use it. This is where Haynes manuals fall on their butts,
they don't tell what it was used nor do they put it in the procedure.

I will repost this in my next installment in Excellence.

Hi Porsche addicts,
   The cost of the rebuild is going to hurt, maybe a lot. A couple of
questions. First I have never rebuilt an engine but have done all the work on
the 914 that doesn't include welding. Is it possible to rebuild as a DIY or
are specialzed tool purchases going to make that prohibitive as well as
specialized knowlege. 
Second a coupe of places have suggested a mild cam and a combo of euro pistons
and decking to make compresion 9:1 is this a good idea and do I need more oil
cooling for this?

I have decided to go with a Clifford alarm for my 911 targa.  After speaking
with many of you, and alarm shops, it seems that Clifford is the one to go
with.  

I am planning on getting the starter kill.  I was told not to go with the fuel
pump kill in the event of a malfunction with the circuit while I was driving.
(what I can't believe that there is such a thing as malfunctioning electronics
in a car-- sorry, combination of bitter customer and electrical engineer)

Also, I am getting the dual zone radar.  Anyone with any comments?
Should I keep my existing factory installed car alarm active in the porsche?

I have a little play in my front wheels which I (and NNJR tech inspectors) 
diagnosed as loose wheel bearings.  I tightened but still had slight play.
The car drove fine on the track until my last event at Bridgehampton when I
started getting camber changes when cornering aggressively.  Kevin G. 
suggested bad struts but I did not want to break out the credit card since the
struts passed the rebound test.  At last Sunday's autox, I heard/felt a 
distinct loud thunk from the front end on hard right turns through slaloms.
I'm hoping changing struts will cure this.

I just ordered a set from Denny and waiting for it to arrive.  If you did the 
job yourself, how tough are the struts/springs to install?  Any 
gotchas/special tools other than spring compressors? How stiff did you set 
front/rear?  What is the difference in ride height before/after?  

Any other recommendations from the list for stiffness for an '87 951 with 
17" wheels?  I've heard 75% stiff front, 50% stiff rear is a good set-up for 
a street-driven car which also does autox/track duty.  Note, these are
NOT externally-adjustable, you set them when you install so I'd like to avoid
experimenting with different settings.

BTW, the M474 was the stock sport suspension on '87 951.

Hello all,

I installed a new Master Cylinder on my 1980 911SC.  What a pain.  The 
Haynes manual never mentioned the heater vent cable and other 
cardboard hoses etc had to be removed as well.  In any case I finally 
got the new M/C installed and bled the brakes twice but the brakes 
are still very spongey and don't stop the car as well.  I have 
checked for leaks etc but can't find any.  The Haynes manual does say 
that the inner and outer bleeder valve on the rear brakes should be 
bled.  I found the outer ones and bled through those, but I haven't 
found the inner ones.  Do they exist on  '80 911SC?  If so where are 
they?  I can't find them and the manual doesn't have any pictures.  
Maybe this might be why the brakes are still spongey.

Subject: 993 ABD & ABS Problem

While driving yesterday we suddenly smelled something burning  and heard a
"clacking" type noise from the rear of the car. Within a few seconds both ABD
warning lights, the ABS warning light, and the alternator warning light came
on. After pulling over and consulting the manual (which stated that all
"normal" brake functions would still operate), it seemed "OK" to drive, and
we took it home without incident. 

Obviously the car is under warranty and we will take it to the dealer
(tomorrow), but I would like to know a little more going in.

My questions:

1) While it seems obvious that there is a malfunction in the ABD/ABS system,
why would the alternator warning light come on?

2) What would cause such a malfunction?

3) What are the implications, if any?

Thanks for the help,

Tracy,
 
I purchased a Mity-Vac vacuum bleeding kit and was dissatisfied with the
results.  From what I understand, when you pull the brake fluid out of the
bleed nipples, using vacuum, air comes in around the threads.  I
understand alot of people have the same problem with this tool.  I even
tried to wrap teflon plumbing tape around the threads to maybe fix the
problem, and this did not help.
 
I ended up going back to my old standby.  A $10 plastic tube with a oneway
valve on the end to prevent air from entering.  This allows me to bleed my
brakes by myself.  I understand that the Ezebleed (sp) system works great,
and fast.  I wish I had put the $25 that the Mity-Vac cost, toward the
cost of the $35 Ezebleed system.

Hi Arthur,

You must be nuts, or rich (I'd go with nuts and rich :) You parked your 
Porsche on the streets of New York City!!!

Not to mention, under piles of snow it sat on the street. I felt sorry 
for my non P-cars last winter being constantly covered by snow.

Presently, we own a townhouse, therefore the cars live on the street. One 
of the reasons I'm waiting until we move to buy my Porsche is because I 
wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing it was on the street.

Kevin,

You wrote that

<snip>

Sorry I didn't respond sooner, but I've been away for a few days.

I had the same problem on my '84 928S.  Porsche has a service 
bulletin that details how to trouble shoot this particular problem.
Your Porsche dealer ought to be able to provide you with a copy
if you ask them for it.

The most obvious possibility is the outside air temperature sensor
in the left front wheelwell.  On my car, a wire had broken and I
had to splice it back together.  That fixed the problem for about 
four months and then it occured again.  This time it was the servo
mechanism under the dash to the right of the steering column.  

I took the servo out and found that a circuit board inside had a 
burned out resistor.  I replaced the resistor and things worked OK
for a week or two and then the servo went belly up again.  Same 
test/fault isolation procedures as before (by now I'm pretty good
at this!) and I decided to scrap the servo.  I bought a *NEW* one 
from 928 International (just under $400 if I remember correctly) and
everythings been fine since.  Notice I stressed that it should be 
new:   they gave me a used one (you could tell by the marks on
the circuit edge connectors and the outside of the servo case), but
promptly changed it for a brand new unit when I pointed out the
problem.  

The Porsche diagnostics are absolutely critical.  They lead you 
through the fault isolation process to the point where you can
do a repair yourself or know what part you need to buy.  Get this
bulletin!  It will save you a lot of repair costs!

Let me know if you need any help.  I've worked on the frapping 
heater/cooling controls so many times I sometimes dream about
them!

Subject: Porsche Autocross information - part1

Hi all,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the first of nine columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

Three Wheeling, By Mike Piera, CT valley region PCA. #1 of 9
	
This series of articles is specifically about Porsche car selection
and preparation for autocrossing. I will stress that car
preparation can be done at minimal cost with minimal modifications
(mods). I believe that most people should not modify their cars much.
Mods do little to improve times and can often make your car slower if
they are not thought out correctly. Mods are a very poor investment,
and will actually lower the value of many Porsches. Also mods will not
make you a better driver. You cannot improve your driving if your
mind is set on buying speed. 

Most Porsches are designed quite well and can be made competitive with
minor mods and adjustments. We see so many "Project cars" in
magazines, and ads and catalogs for great new parts, that many of us
are "romanced" into purchases that we may later regret. I am not
trying to damage the business of the many Porsche shops and parts
dealers. I do recommend several mods and upgraded parts that are
needed to be competitive, and I recommend that those without the
needed mechanical skills or tools take their cars to someone who can
do the job right.

I will concentrate on "SCCA Stock class" Porsches, with much fewer
mods than allowed even in the lowest of the Porsche Club rules (PCRs).
The PCR's are a chinese menu of allowable mods with
random points given to different mods. I think these rules were
created by someone from the federal government on acid. Setting up
a car to SCCA stock specs will allow you to run in the "stock" classes
in almost any car club, without being terribly outclassed. For example,
in SCCA the next step up from stock is Street Prepared. Someone from
the PCA with only larger springs or other small modifications would
be forced to compete against cars modified to the limits of SP (engine
swap, big wheels, flares, suspension updates, etc). Unless you
are willing to go all the way to the limits of the class you intend
to compete in, you are best off in a nearly Stock Porsche. 

I will try to outline the Porsches which have high autocross
potential with small modifications. Even if you have no plans on
trading or buying a car, it should help you see the potential of
your current car. These suggestions should also apply to track events,
but will be geared specifically for winning autocross.

To introduce myself, I have been autocrossing in Porsches seriously
for over twelve years, the last ten years in a Stock class 1972 911S
Targa. I am a two time SCCA Solo-II A-Stock National Champion ('85
and '90). In my two Porsche Club of America "Porsche Parades"
('91 and '94) I was the fastest of any of the stock "P"roduction
classes. 

More to come!

Many thanks to Keith Roberts and Tim Krone for your research and responses to
my questions.

Tim, I definitely have an H4 bulb (2 screws; bulb wattage unknown, I have to
verify at home. I am writing this from work).

I am not sure I understand what purpose would be served by installing a
relay. It seems to me that the amount of current drained through the wire is
causing the copper female connector in the nylon housing to overheat. I
thought I could cure the problem by either reducing the current drain (eg.
power the parking lights from another source) or more likely increase the
gauge of the connectors in the nylon plug (especially if the bulb is high
wattage). What do you think?

Keith, glad to know that you have the same model car I have. I'd be
interested in learning about your upgrades to the car/maintenance tricks and
what worked best for you. Personally, I am too much of a rookie to have any
meaningful input, but if I can return the favor in anyway I'll try my best.

Many thanks again. Philippe.

Yes, it is in the head and it measures the temperature of the water in the
head. The sender is just to the left (driver's left) of the radiator hose
nozzle at the top of the head.

Ideal temp is probably close to straight up (between the first and

200 degrees Fahrenheit. I believe that the air cooled motors can
have the oil safely go up to about 220 degrees.

Asad,
   It seems to me that you need to bleed more than twice. What I have had to
do to get good pedal is to bleed it at least 10 times. Accualy what we do
is to install pads that are almost shot, bleed the brakes then reinstall the 
new pads. Some reason this has allways worked. Getting good pedal is not 
easy with out many cycles of bleeding.

          I tried to buy a new sump plate, but found out they are NLA.
          I ended up buying a nice used plate from Foreign Intrigue in
          Berwick, Maine for $10 plus shipping.  Most of the
          other typical used parts sources wanted $25 to $30.

          If you go this route, you'll also need two new sump cover
          gaskets and new spring washers under each nut holding the
          plate on.

Subject: Re: 911 Tach Repair


          This is a response to the question regarding the sticking
          tach needle.  My 911SC has this problem when it's really
          warm out and the car's been in the sun.  Even when I shut
          off the engine, the needle sticks between 3,000 and 4,000.

          I asked about this at a tech session at last year's Parade.
          Apparently, hot weather can distort the plastic window on
          the tach so that it bows in and touches the needle.  When
          the car cools, the window pops back out and the tach works
          fine.  Next time your tach sticks, try using a small suction
          cup to pull out the window and see if this cures the
          problem.

I'm looking for the range of prices people are paying for a 993 coupe; ltd slip,

Hi Everyone,

O.K., I'm going to finally take the plunge and buy my first Porsche.  I'd like
some advice and get a sanity check.  First off, I've read every back issue of
EXCELLENCE and PANO...FIX'N Up...on and on.....I've bugged my poor Porsche
owning friends to death.  But I still have questions.  I know Brian Yee asked
for advice on this topic not long before I got on the list and I'd like to
read a digest of the responses to his questions if anyone could pass that
along....

I think I'm looking for a stock '84 911 coupe w/sunroof and maybe the factory
spoilers or turbo look if I can afford it.  Please read the items below and
tell me, am I on the right track?(pun intended)...

Here are the facts/requirements/constraints:
Budget of about 20K(25K if the S.O. is in a good humor) plus 1k per year for
Maintenance.
I'm 6'4" 210, will I fit?! The RX-7 we have now is a torture device on trips!
Nearest (decent) Porsche Shop is two hours, I'm in the middle of the desert!
I'm mechanically inclined and willing to do minor work, lube, oil, filters,
etc.
This car will be a Daily Driver for my S.O. and a Weekend Trip/Fun Car for me.
Reliability is more important than absolute performance.( As Ferrari found out
at Daytona! :-))
Need aComfortable Trip car-> good seats, A/C, quiet(except for the purr of 3.2
liters)
What is Rotary A/C and why is it good? 
Maybe driven in Driver's Ed, but no autocross or racing for now, what tire and
wheel combo should I look for?  What's "Stock" on '84 911's?
What's the difference between a car with "factory tubo look" and car's with
only "factory spoilers".
Are the spoilers worth having? One nice thing about the desert is, there are
places to let the car "stretch it's legs" do the spoilers really help?
Is engine cooling going to be a problem in the desert?....it can get hot, damn
hot, Tarzan couldn't take this kind'a hot here in Ridgecrest.
Is the oil cooler in the Tail onTurbo LOOK cars? Would this help cooling? 
I seem to be reading a lot lately about relatively low mile 3.2's in need of
top ends because the intake valve guides are worn, is this a problem with this
engine?  Another 3k for a top end shortly after getting the car would not be
fun.
Is the Porsche Market Letter worth the money?
I'm looking in the LA., SanJose, Reno  areas... if I find a car in San Jose I
thought I'd take it to Bruce Anderson's for inspection, but *who* can I trust
in LA and Reno?
How much should the inspection cost?
I've tring to convice the S.O. that a well cared for 911 will be a good,
reliable car for a long time to come, Am I telling the truth? (blatant ploy
for testimonials to show the S.O.)

Well that's enough for now, thanks for the bandwidth.

Subject: ?911 C2/C4 Sunroof Removal & Headliner Question

The leather head-liner in my 90 C4 (coupe - obviously) is needing a 
little work.  The headliner normaly wraps around the hole where the 
sunroof goes - and towards the rear of the car there is a little sheet 
metal bar with teeth.  The head-liner is supposed to be under this 
gripper bar.  There is also supposed to be adhesive all the way around to 
hold everything in place - especially in the corners.

The problem is that the drivers side half of the head liner has come out 
of the gripper bar.  When the sunroof is being shut - the headliner rolls 
forward.

So I need to 1) get the headliner back under the gripper bar and 2) re 
glue the whole thing.

I tried to do it tonight without removing the sunroof - but found it too 
confining.

Can I remove the sunroof in a couple of hours?  I have the Haynes manual 
but it is for older type sunroofs - (I think b/c the instructions didn't 
really line up with what I see).  I even bought the C2/C4 manuals - but 
found that many chapters (like Body Section 60: Sunroof) is not present.  
I have inquired to PCNA and they sent me a postcard saying that I also 
needed Supplement WKD482520.22 - whatever that is.

Thanks guys/gals!

Subject: Got ticket in The Bast*rd-Too Loud!

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	I was cruising two weekends ago in The Bastard (my '75 Corvair
powered 914) having a nice drive.  It was on its first outing back from 
my brother's body shop, where it had its flares and 916 bumpers installed
and gorgeous fly yellow paint applied.  Really looks like the "Sunoco" 
914 in an old Panorama of mine.  I let my brother "work off" the $1000
he borrowed for his 914.  He did a show quaility paint job that took 
hours of prep.  He's also going to respray my mist green 924, which is
starting to look faded.
	Anyway, I was descending a small incline when The Bastard starts
ripping backfires loud enough to make people draw their Ak-47s.  Of 
course a revenue collector was nearby, and he pulls me over.  He says
"Gee son, thats quite a car you got there, you got this thing registered
for the road?"  Uh, yes. "Well you sure ain't got much mufflin' on it, 
I'm goin to hafta write chew up for makin two much noiz, What year is 
this vee-dubya?"  Uh, sir, it's a '75 and it's actually a Porsche.  
"Same difference" he chuckles.  Funny.  He finishes writing the ticket
and tells me to "hav a good wun".  
	He wrote me a ticket for a city offense (Charlotte, NC) for
"excessive noise in a residential area"  I hate to just pay the fine,
$100(!), even though I know I'm guilty.  What can I say in my defense?
One idea is to say I was on my way to get a muffler installed.  Any 
better ideas?  Oh yeah, I've really got to quiet down The Bastard, its
basically a straight pipe now.  Any suggestions as to mufflers?  Thanks
for any suggestions.

Kevin,
I would love to go to the Bridge since it's one of my favorite places and
especially since it looks like it's history.
I think it will be a last minute decision since I just got back from the
Brian Redman Jefferson 500 at Summit Point. That was 3 days of VERY intense
racing. There were 200 very expensive race cars and then there was me.
Porsche was the honored Marque this year so they invited PCA racers (it's a
vintage event) and there was everything from Carerra 4 cams to 962. And then
there was me. Seriously it was very impressive. I raced against 904's, 906's,
910's, 935's, 917's, etc. Not only that but the drivers read like a
professional racers seniors tour with Redman, Buzzetta, Elford, White, Akin,
Akin Jr, Bill Adams, Jennings,Thompson. you get the picture. 
I watched someone absolutely destroy a GT40 Ford when he went off turn 10 and
deep into the woods, cutting a swath thru the trees. There was literally
nothing intact on that car but the driver was fine.
Anyway it was far more aggressively competitive then PCA racing and I'm a
little burned out. I will be at the Summit and Pocono PCA races this year so
I'll probably see you in the pits

Steve,

I *highly* recommend that you replace the camber bolts and all associated
hardware.  That is,

 - the eccentric camber bolt,
 - the other bolt, M12 x 55
 - their lock nuts
 - the eccentric washer.

I also recommend that you add thick washers under the head and nut
of the plain bolt.  All this hardware gets real tired and tends to
gall.  The result is that it can be very hard to adjust the alignment,
and it can be impossible to make the camber stay put.

If you have a Cool Brake kit, be sure to put the bolt heads on the back
of the strut, so that they can be replace in future without pulling off
the hub.  (Yep, I fluffed this on my own car a few weeks ago.  Grr.)

Not real hard to do.  You do need a spring compressor, and a big wrench
or airgun to get the M14 nut off the top.  Of course, you do need to
realign the car afterwards.

Asad,

Chris Musante and I popped a new MC in Steve Curland's SC at the
Lime Rock club race.  So the knuckles are still scraped and the memory
fresh...  Steve had the courtesy afterwards to go out and win his
class, which is all that I ask.

Yep, it's a real pain to get to.  With all that room in the front,
you have to wonder why the factory chose to leave zero clearance between
the sheet metal and the MC.  What worked was to remove the two Bowden
cables from the heater valve, then unfasten the paper hose.  I could
then turn the valve out of the way enough to remove the MC.

All the callipers on Steve's car had single bleed valves on the inboard
side.  I borrowed someone's SO to pump the pedal, and she and I purged
the system the old-fashioned way without any difficulty.

Check the rubber hoses and make sure that they are not swollen and are
otherwise OK.  If they swell, or are clogged/constricted, you can get
a spongey pedal.  If this is the case, replace them with new OE rubber
hoses.

Well, you *CAN* do this yourself....

Couple of places to start: there's a book called something like 
"Rebuild Your Air Cooled VW Engine" that has a very, very good first
time step-by-step for building the 914 engine, including getting the
damn thing out of the car.

There's ALSO this thing called the "Spec Book". You gotta have one. It
has all of the critical measurements for wear tolerances, torques, etc.

Tools wise, you gotta have a good -- and I mean *GOOD* torque wrench,
basic hand tools, and some very fine measuring tools. It's also very 
handy to have a bench, a big bench vise, a parts washer, an air compressor,
and about three cases of spray carb cleaner... If you have the "hard stuff"
done at a machine shop -- which you need to do anyway, typically -- then
you don't really have to have anything special. 

As to experience, all of us remember staring at that First Engine with a
wrench in one hand going "Now What?". All of us.

I routinely use the Euro 2.0 pistons, with a zero deck height, and have
the combustion chambers CC'd to give me 9.5:1 --- FOR RACING PURPOSES. For
a street car, I dunno, 9:1 is fine. In your part of the world it's not
that much of a need for added cooling. Down here in Texas, though, it would
be a requirement.

I also use a FAT cam, their "mild performance for fuel injection" part,
on a regular basis.

Subject: 944 Ring & Pinions

 
    Yes, I have got a set of these babies that have to be 
replaced. My fears were correct, half of the pinions teeth
on my 85/2 944 ( 51K ) are missing and the ring has a few
but noticeable scars. 
 
I know I can buy a used transaxle, but right now I am only 
interest in replacing the ring & pinions on the current one
( this way I can still have matching number, I don't know
what that is worth ). So let me take some time to  pose 
the following questions:
 
    Is the amount of efforts required in replacing the  R & P is
    the same as rebuilding the trans, completely?
    
    Is there a alternative i.e. replace R & P with absolute minimum
    amount of transaxle disassembly.
 
    Who sells better ( strong, light weight??? ) Ring & Pinions?
    Are these R & P interchangeable between later models of 944.
    i.e. can I buy a stock 89-951 R & P and through that into my
    existing unit.

    Haynes Manual is very vague about rebuilding the Transaxle. Does
    the shop manual cover this subject in more detail.
    
Looking forward for the follow-ups, More questions later!

Thanks,

The following modification to the pins, if done properly, will
not be visible.  And, the pins will stay snug in their clips.

Remove the pins.  Note about where the tightening screws should
squeeze the pins.  Remove plastic from the pins such that they
taper from the inner end to just beyond the place where they are
squeezed by the screws.  The pins should not come to a point
but should still be somewhat narrower at their inner ends.
A resultant diameter at the inner ends of about one half of
original should be OK.

Be sure to preserve a circular cross section along the pin so
that the visor can still turn on the pin.

This taper will tend to cause the pins to be squeezed outward
instead of creeping inward as before.  This should keep the pins
snug in their clips.


One way to remove the necessary plastic from the pins is to use
a low speed drill.  Chuck a pin in the drill and spin the pin's
inner end against an abrasive surface at an appropriate angle.
Don't apply enough force to break the pin.

While I believe you can buy a short shifter kit for the '72, you might want
to consider replacing your '72 linkage with the improved shifter from a '73

shifter was inherently a better design and may give you the improvemnt you

Subject: 911SC Alternator/Elec. problems/Parts Pricing


Hi,

I posted a few days ago about electrical problems with my tachometer
fluttering around and the seatbelt light coming on.   Well while
driving last night, I noticed the red generator light glowing slightly
while driving normally.  When I come to a stop (idliing) it stops
glowing and goes black.  The tach needle still has the problems of
fluttering up to 6000 RPM's intermittenly, and the seat belt light
comes on when this happens.  

A few people responded back saying it may be the ground strap, the
alternator, the voltage regulator, and possibly a bad brake light bulb.
But now since IU notice the generator light glowing ever so slightly
I think it may be the ground strap or alternator.  I do not know where
the voltage regulator is.  Tonight I have time off to look into this
problem.  How should I start to diagnose it?  I have a set of ramps I
can put the car on.  I would like to this repair myself.  How expensive
is an alternator (if that needs replacing), and are the rebuilt ones
ok to use?  (This is a 1981 911SC).   More importantly, how difficult
is it to replace the alternator?  Does it require dropping the engine
or any serious, serious dismanteling of the car?  Any hints thankful.

What about the voltage regulators?
Where is that thing and how can I check its workablility?

On another note: (This is about pricing of parts:)
Since it is national 911 repair week for me, I had a crack in a pipe
in the muffler system.  It was called the connecting pipe and runs
from the heat exchanger on one side, to the heat exchanger on the
other.  Running parralel to the axle of the car, and under the bell
housing.  It is about 1.5 feet long, has a triangular flange on each
end with 3 bolts for each flange.  It has a slight S-curvature to it
to fit under the housing and over another pipe.  Well after much effort 
wrestling with the 3 16-year old corroded bolts on either end, I managed 
to get the old pipe loose.  A used one is coming in the mail on Friday 
from PartsHeaven for $50, with gaskets and bolts.   

Now when I went mail order shopping from parts suppliers in the back of 
Panaorama and Excellence I got an EXTREME range of prices for this  
pipe.  Two places: Partsheaven and Kempton Brothers wanted $50 used, 
this was my lowest.  A dealer wanted $580 for a new one.  Vertex wanted 
$180 for a new one, but after I told them all this pricing bullshit 
they said they would give me the new one for $140.  Another place wanted 
$100 used, and $320 new.  What the hell is going on here with parts 
prices?????  I find the same thing to be true every time I want to buy 
a part.  I have to call 6-10 places and get ranges that vary by 300 
percent.  I usually find German Parts and Restoration to have the 
lowest prices - they were out of this part.

My point is (I think most people get my point), where do the people that
buy parts regularly get them from?  The people like Pete Albrecht - don't
you build porsches from parts daily (or you must know people that do?)?
I cannot imagine people that regularly buy parts call 6-10 places each time
they want something!  I realize that it IS a Porsche, but screw that
mentality, I am on a shoestring budget, and it pisses me off there is such 
a markup or mark down in the marketplace.  I am going to have a great time
finding an alternator!

Also, I fixed the oil leak I had by getting some new washers for the bolt, 
thanks to all who replied.  

Any advice with the electrical stuff is greatly appriciated.

Afsar-

You would not be happy with a 951 R&P in your 944. It is a taller ratio...(less
torque). If you were going to change it you may want to look into the R&P from
a 944S - it had a shorter gear ratio (what 944 turbo guys often put in for more
torque, until Porsche issued a statement advising against it).

I would go for a rebuilt transaxle, IMHO.

good luck.

Subject: Two questions

I think they has been plenty of discussion about alarm systems for 
the 911, but unfortunately missed them. I just purchased a '86 930 
that has a stock alarm. I am looking for a system that gives me 
remote entry and either uses the porsche alarm, or its own. Does 
anyone have a recommendation?
Second question, does this model year have a hydraulic clutch? I feel 
like I am going to have to start working out at the gym to strengthen 
my left leg.

I don't know if this is the appropriate address, but I found your "home page"
on INTERNET and am very interested on getting more information on your service.

My reasons for interest are twofold:

  1) I own a 1978 924 which needs work, but I am NOT what you would call an
     experienced mechanic.  I have done some minor repairs (e.g. replaced
     clutches (64 MGB-GT), alternators, waterpumps (Ford), etc.), but doubt I
     could do a credible job setting timing belts, etc.  So with my 924 I am
     forever seeking advice, articles, parts, etc. in Excellence, Panorama,
     and European Car.

  2) I have recently been asked to serve a Newsletter Editor for the Green
     Mountain Region of the PCA.  So I will constantly seeking input to pass
     along to our members.
So if this is not the right place to try to get on the circulation list please
let me know.  You will have my return e@mail address with this message, and I
will send you a home station address when I get my home PC back on line.  I
am interest in receiving condensed messages if possible as I am a full-time
Systems Analyst (with lots of work to do) and an Adjunct college professor
to pay for my "german metal" and other so called addictions (family, etc.)

Thanks for you help, and I found your FAQ section on 924's already answered
some of my questions.  Thanks again.

Subject: alternator pulling for morons (LONG :)

I apologize in advance for the spelling, grammar, etc- but this is LONG, 
and is written by and for the weekend mechanic who doesn't know much proper 
terminology (so please excuse my use of: thingy, do-dad, etc...)  but, it 
works- and if anyone knows an easier way to pull an alternator. please 
tell me :)

Barry, my man- today is your lucky day!
Sitting on my desk is an alternator from my '81 SC targa- just pulled it 
last nite (second time I've done the job!)  It'll take less time to do 
than you might think, after I give you some hints- took me about 5 hours 
the first time since I only had a hanes manual, and nuthin else :(.
(relax! I pulled it in less than an hour last nite with poor lighting!!)
Ok, look at the engine- i'm calling the fan side the back- and get a 
ratchet to fit the nut on the alternator.  oops! first disconnect that 
(-) battery lead- heck, put a charger on it while it sits there :)
If you have something you can 
stick in the holes on the alternator pulley to keep it from turning while 
you loosen the nut, more power to ya', but i didn't, so i just a soft 
piece of wood in the fan (to bind between the fan and the fan housing- 
just stick it in the left side of the fan, and it should bind against one 
of the fixed vanes...) the nut only has 28lbs of torque on it so it 
shouldn't be too tight.  loosen it, and be careful to get all the 
washers, and note how many are on which side of the pulley.  that's how 
you adjust the belt tension, and it's probably best to leave the washers 
in the same way you found 'em... unless your belt's a lil' loose.  the 
more washers on the outside of the pulley-half, the tighter the belt.  
ok, now make sure you've done the battery- then loosen the two nuts on the 
coil (the round cylinder thingy on the fan housing- not that i don't 
think you know what it is :)  and push it outta the way, and then loosen 
one of the clamps from the heater blower to get the hose loose.  remove 
the other bolt holding the heater hose to the fan housing and just push 
it up and outta the way- it bends real easy like & doesn't mind as long 
as you're gentle and don't try to put 90 degree bends in it...
ok, look down near the distributor and pull that last bolt, it's in a 
funny place, but it's easy to see.  ok, now to get that ac belt and that 
alternator belt outta your way.  look at the lower left corner of your 
compressor.  you'll see a bolt with a nut on it pointing out sideways- 
this is used to tighten the compressor belt- loosen this nut so it's 
about to fall off- no need to take it off, ya' might lose it :)  look at 
the side of the compressor facing you, and beneath the clutch/wheel 
thingy, you'll see two bolts facing you.  loosen these just enough to 
make 'em loose on their slides.  look behind the compressor (twds the 
front of the car) and you'll see the head of a bolt (near the right 
corner of the comprsr) loosen it.  if all these are loose enuff, she'll 
slide easily to the left.  she'll be smushing against the heater hose a 
lil', but she won't hurt it.  you may hafta force her against the hose a 
lil, putting a "dent" in the hose (don't worry, just don't ram it, gently 
force it)  the belt on the a/c comprsr will be a lil' tight to get off, i 
usu. start at the to, pull it off with my hands and then use a 
screwdriver to GENTLY pry the rest of the belt off- just be sure not to 
cut or pull any threads off the belt- or you'll be on your way to a belt 
failure... i'm not saying you gotta be a surgeon while doing all this, 
but just don't get pissed and start banging things around=- they'll break 
(i know :) ok, now just push the belt down into it's lil' well and after 
a lil' wiggling and tugging it should come off, same for alt. belt... just 
an aside, if you do any autocross, etc, i hear that pulling your a/c 
belt gives ya' an extra 5hp...
anyway- on to the real nasty stuff.........
loosen the allen wrench bolt with a 7/32 allen wrench- watch out! that 
clamp thingy may spring out and getcha (mine did-ouch!!)  ok, GENTLY 
slide the whole housing out (fan, big round housing, etc)  be careful, 
since there are wires attached to that baby and we don't wanna break 'em.
it won't come out too far, just enough for you to see the the nuts going 
around a funny cone shaped piece with two fins on it.  be careful- those 
damn fins will break off (again, I KNOW :)  ok, gently remove each nut 
turning the whole thing to get to them.  you can get most of them by 
turning to the left, but you've got  get the last two by turning to the 
right (this is where i broke my fin off) it won't go too far b/c of the 
left fin, DO NOT FORCE IT- let your hand get a few scrapes and bend in a 
funny way, it beats the hell outta reattaching one of those fins :)
oh yeah- don't forget those washers- keep 'em all!  slide that plastic 
thingy back and you should be staring at "five" wires- actually five sets 
of wires-  three red, two brown, one blue, and one BIG red wire, and the 
one small black wire.  draw a 
picture of this thing so you know what goes where when ya' put in the new 
one.  (whew- long ain't it folks :)
loosen all them bad boys, and viola! (or something like that)- and you've 
got an alternator assembly sitting in your lap! 
ok- now the fun part.  turn that baby over, get a rubber mallet, and 
GENTLY get that thing knocked out (it should slide out the front, fan and 
all- unless you could already get the fan off, i couldn't...)  the fan is 
also a lil' snug- just have LOTS of patience and take some time to get 
those things tapped out.  just remember-you're dealing with cast 
aluminum- not too hard to break or damage, and since it's to pretty close 
tolerances (not to mention balance) just take some time- these things are 
in tight and will eventually come loose.  the installation is just like 
the removal- and about as tricky.  I'm a 22 yr. old computer scientist 
getting ready to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy- and if I can do 
the following in a parking lot... anybody can :)
The voltage regulator- look behind that piece of black plastic held on 
with two wing nuts- you'll see fuses, relays, etc.  it's the big thingy, 
towards the front, it'll be black plastic, mounted by itself to the 
firewall, and will probably have some kinda figure on top- it'll say 
"14v" and then 'made in france'- the 14v part is a lil' artsy looking. 
but you'll know it when you see it- it's about 2" x 2" x 2.5", with a 
singe, 3 pronged plug coming from it.
if you get a new alternator, it'll probably have a built in voltage 
regulator- so all you do is pull the old regulator out and ditch it.  as 
for the alternator wires, just clip and tape up the small black wire 
(there won't be anywhre to attach it on the new one...)- that's it!
as for what to get, i recommend going thru Europroducts (1-800-962-0911).
you could get a rebuilt for about $180, but the guys at euro can get you 
a new one for $239- and all the mechanics I've talked to say it's worth 
the money to get new- since rebuilts sometimes have problems (as well as 
a shorter life- and once you've pulled the damn thing, you won't want to 
do it again anytime soon!!)  as for europroducts credentials- they supply 
automotion with alot of their stuff- and they've told me anything in 
automotion, they can get you the same exact part for LESS :)
so, happy tooling- and remember, if you see some young punk driving a 
white 911, no his daddy didn't buy it- and he does his own work too :)
(sorry Barry- couldn't resist :)
call me at my # and leave a message if you have any questions, and I'll 
get ahold of you ASAP.
good luck- you'll need it,
buZZ

I'll look or the original. The TACH is only held in by the rubber gromet in the
dash. It's a push fit! Ease it out and disconnect the wires. To remove the
bezel you have to bend the bezel up using a small screwdriver. Ease it a little
at a time, going round more than once if necessary and changing to a larger
screw driver. This piece is against the gromet so it doesn't show afterwards if
you are careful. Bend the bezel back using two pieces of wood so it doesn't
mark the bezel face.

Hi p-philers,

Well, I guess I am finally ready to start seriously looking for a p-car.  What

Any comments from past or present owners of Cabriolets, I am especially

and any drawbacks.
 
Since I would like to get a factory Turbo-look cab(want to keep under 30k so I guess
a real 87+ Turbo cab is out <sniff>) could any one tell me what to check to 
distinguish between a factory and aftermarket Turbo-look car?  

Any other tips appreciated.
 
Thanks for any comments!

months for an 87 911 Cab, bringing my total bill to $1426/6 months for 3 cars...

If you have a connector melting it is because you have a poor connection 
at that point - you only need to be dropping 2 volts accross the 
connector to develop a couple of watts of heat, this will be sufficient 
to melt plastic connectors, because they are good insulators and keep the 
heat in.
	clean the contacts, and for spade type connections you can give 
them a gentle squeeze in a pair of pliers.

Subject: Misc 356 woes....

I've had a very, very hard to diagnose front end problem on my '64 SC.
Finally, I have an answer: the bearings that support the upper right
trailing arm are shot.

OK, fine. I look in the Stoddard catalog, yup, they're there. And there's
a supercession part number. OK, I can deal with that...

I call Zim's. They tell me these little guys are NLA. Plus, if they
*ARE* available, they're hand-hammered from the gold of the gods by
Bavarian virgins only on nights with a full moon and as a result cost
the earth. I'm wished luck in my search, but don't get much help...

So I call Stoddard. I cringe, knowing that if they have them, and if
Zim's is right... well, if you've done business with them, you know
the rest. OK, it's not TOO bad -- the whole deal is like $110 per
trailing arm, but of course there ARE four trailing arms...

So, before I send the order to scenic Willoughby, OH, I figured that this
would be the perfect forum in which to seek help/advise/commentary. Anyone
out there have any OTHER suggestions? I hear rumor that at least on 
pre-A and A cars you can use some late VW Beetle part instead. How about
on the Cs? And given that this is going to require removal of the whole
front end, who does a good job reinforcing the trailing arms and C-link,
and what should I expect to pay for that?

On the other hand, this is refreshing -- it's a part of the car I haven't
taken apart yet... Oh joy...

need the side mirrors.
I don't know how I went all this time with one of those dinky little center

 Porsche 914 : need various parts
 Triumph GT6 : also need various parts
 '89 Honda Civic:  My GF wants cruise control, tach and a clock.
 
 The yards don't necessarily need to specialize in any type of car, but if you 
 knew of some that did that would be good.
 
 And sorry about the H*nda content.  But then again, the girlfriend's car is the

Just a word of warning - I lived in Jackson for two years and the winters are 
vicious, the amount of sand and salt on the roads in the spring and early summer 
is incredible.  Most of the backroads around town are in terrible shape (dirt). 
 I would recommend to anyone to go to Jackson Hole - It is a beautiful place to 
ski, hike, camp and hunt, but to buy an older porsche?  I would look in S. Cal. 
or Arizona.  Hey but if you need an excuse to go on vacation go for it.  Just be 
prepared to fly back once you see the car!  If you want any recommendations on 
where to go let me know!

 Greetings,
 
 914 case is going to FAT Performance tomorrow.  Recent suggestions have been to 
 machine the case for zero deck height and then to set the compression by ccing 
 the comb. chambers.  OK, sounds good.  Does this require me to get the euro 
 pistons and liners first or can I just go down to FAT and say "Here's some $$$, 
 make it so!" ?  (i.e. will they know how much to take off to get the deck 
 height to be zero -- I suspect not!)
 
 Also,  recent suggestions have pointed toward a 9.0 compression ratio.  The 
 engine is for "spirited" street driving and 9.0 tells me that I may not be able 
 to run on pump gas... certainly not 87 octane.  Anyone have any comments as too 
 a good compression ratio for stock gas (87 or 92 octane options?)  I was 
 thinking that an 8.5 CR would be a pretty good compromise.  Any comments?
 
 Engine will be run with D-Jet FI, FAT 440HP cam, remote mounted Accusump and 
 Canton/Meca filter, euro 2.0 cylinders, etc.
 
 Thanks!

any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted, and I would like
a copy of the publication with my material in it.


Three Wheeling, By Mike Piera, CT valley region PCA  #2 of 9

This article will discuss the selection of Porsches based on their
competitiveness in autocrossing with minimal modifications. I will
start with the 911 models. I don't mean to leave out the 356's, but
I have not seen too many 356s autocross on the East Coast lately.

The models that I do not recommend can usually be updated to the
better performing models, but it is better (and usually cheaper) 
to start out with the right car. And updating a car will often 
move you to another class unless the rules are followed closely.

The very early 911s ('65-'68) are good for collecting but are not well
suited for competition. They have short wheelbases with too much rear
overhang, narrow wheels, and low torque engines which fouled up too
easily. Notice that I mentioned torque rather than horsepower. There
have been numerous battles between people who claim that horsepower is
more important than torque and vice-versa. I will not get into this
argument, but I think what you should look for is "highest torque at
useable autocross RPM". A high horsepower road racing-type engine with
hot cams will not be able to accelerate well out of a low speed
autocross turn without using first gear. You need to have good torque
at about 3000 RPM to have a good autocross car. But it is still nice 
to have high RPM horsepower for the longer straights, and be able 
to avoid upshifts which require downshifting a few seconds later.

Starting in '69 the 911 wheelbase was increased, wheels and fenders were
widened, brakes improved, and engines improved somewhat. The chassis
on a '69 with the S options (sway bars, 6" wide 15" wheels, etc) is
adequate if it is not structurally weakened by rust.
But these 2.0 Liter engines were still a bit low on useable torque.
The E and S engines had "mechanical" fuel injection, which is
better than the original weber carbs when it is working correctly.
Unfortunately it is expensive to maintain and many cars have
carburetor replacements. It is hard to believe that people are still
putting carbs on 911 engines, as no Porsche since 1971 has used 
them. As usual, I recommend stock Fuel Injection (FI), but if you
must modify the fuel system for a special engine, there are several
excellent computer-controlled fuel injection systems now available.
Haltech is the most successful and seems perfect for any modified
engine since it can be custom programmed with a Personal Computer.
But figure the total cost of several times your initial estimate
to get a programmable FI running correctly.

In '70 and '71 the engines were "bored" to 2.2 liter displacement for
better power. These are slightly better than the previous 2.0 engines.
About this time the CD ignition was added to help the fouling problems.
The 911S was available with lighweight aluminum engine cover
and other options to give it an excellent power to weight ratio.
But the S engine was still somewhat weak on low-RPM torque. These
are really the oldest 911s that have been competitive in stock classes.
The T was still carbureted, but with Zenith carbs which work fine for
autocrossing. Some people prefer the Zeniths to Webers, but they are
not as tuneable to different engine configurations.

For '72 and '73 the engines were "stroked" to 2.4 liters and
compression was lowered to meet pollution standards without 
sacrificing performance. Now FI was standard even on the T engine.
The 2.4 T is about as fast as than the original 2.0 S, with much 
improved driveability. Some people believe the 2.4 E engine is better
suited to autocross than the 2.4 S, but after plotting the torque
curves I have determined that the S engine is better due to a much
stronger top end, higher redline, and only slightly less torque at 
lower speeds. Only the T engine would show any real low RPM benefits,
but only at very low RPM where you should not be driving anyway.

The '72 model was the only year that had the oil tank moved forward
with an external oil filler like the 959, offering marginally better
weight distribution. Starting in '73 "crash bars" were welded in the
doors.  The other big change in '72 was that the transmission changed
from a 901 to a 915. It was beefed-up, and the shift pattern changed 
to a normal pattern with first gear easier to find. Also the '72 S
was the first Porsche offered with a spoiler (front only, by '73 most
911 models had them). In '73 the shift linkage was improved slightly,
but the '72 is not bad with good bushings. I may be biased, but I think
a 2.4S (or E) is one of the best cars Porsche ever built. About 2300 
pounds and 190 HP make for lots of fun, with a light feeling that is 
missing from the late model cars. 

The biggest visual change in the 911 came in 1974 when the larger
bumpers were added. Engines were bored out again, this time to 2.7.
Unfortunately, in the USA smog laws were getting tougher so the
fuel injection was changed to CIS, which meant a change to very
mild cams. But the power was still very good (especially on the S)
and the torque was even better than before. Also the weight in '74
was not much more than the '73, due to aluminum bumpers which lasted
only one year. Also lasting only one more year was the early style
tuned-exhaust. 

The US models continued to diverge from their European brothers, which
started with the '73 Carrera RS which was not legal in the USA. A 
special '74-'75 911 was sold in the USA as the Carrera model. This
was similar to European models, except for the standard CIS S engine.
But it did include the famous "duck tail" rear spoiler, front spoiler,
rear fender flares, and bigger wheels and sway bars. This was the
first 911 offered in America with bigger wheels standard :
6" front and 7" rear originally, followed in late '74 by 7" and 8"
wheels, all of 15" diameter. In autocross, wide wheels are one of
the most important features a car can have. This makes the '74 
Carrera a killer car in stock class. Few of these were made, but 
they are often for sale at reasonable prices. Also it is easy (and 
sometimes cheaper) to make one from a normal '74 S. A problem with 
the 2.7 engines was that they tended to pull themselves apart. This 
can be prevented with a modern rebuild with updated studs and 
timeserts to keep them together. But beware of an old 2.7 engine 
with noise!

In 1975 the 911 really went downhill (yet it was still the fastest
car you could buy in America at the time!). Thermal reactors were
added to the exhaust system for pollution control. Power went down,
and problems went up. Also the bumpers grew heavier. These '75 -'77
cars are not desireable in stock form. Rust was no longer a big
problem starting in '76 when most sheet metal was galvanized. But
partial galvanization had actually started much earlier, and early
seventies models that were not exposed to salt can hold up well.
Be sure to check the front suspension pans, rocker panels, and
rear torsion tube area on any older 911.

Finally in '78 things improved with the SC model, which received
a big 3.0 liter aluminum engine with 180 HP and good
torque. Also the rear fenders were flared to accept 8" rims in the 
back like the earlier Carrera models. But the 3.0 engine was 
heavier than the earlier magnesium case engines, and the cars were
gaining heavy standard features like AC, sunroofs, and power
assists. 16" diameter rims were introduced, but for autocrossing the
15" rims are actually better, lowering the car and allowing wider
tires without clearance problems. The 7 and 8x15" is the hot setup,
and was available as a factory option so they are legal in stock
classes. 
	
The 911 carrera replaced the SC in 1984. These had an improved
DME computer controlled fuel injection, and larger stroke 3.2 liter
engine with about 210 HP and good torque. The turbo-look option was
available, which used 911 turbo wide fender flares front and rear, 
turbo wheel sizes, and other turbo parts. They had most of the 
benefits of the turbo without the troublesome and expensive turbo 
engine. These can be very fast autocrossers, except on very narrow 
courses. The '89 speedster has similar potential. The suspension 
was stiffened on all 911s in '86 to make the now even heavier car 
handle better, with bigger sway bars and torsion bars. The '87-'89 
models were even better, with a new G50 transmission which shifts 
much better than the notchy 915. The engine specs also claimed a tad
more power in '87. The very rare '88 "Club Sport" model is a great 
autocrosser, with a higher redline, more power, and a bit lighter.

In '89 the carrera 4 arrived, with a totally new chassis with
coil-spring suspension and a powerful 250 HP 3.6 liter engine, but
hundreds of pounds more weight. These cars also have "off-road-
look suspension" with a very high ride height, even though
Porsche insists the 4 wheel drive is for normal roads. These
cars have great power and acceleration, but have not proven to be well
suited to autocrossing. In '90 the carrera 2 replaced the original
911 for good. It is basically a carrera 4 without all wheel drive.
This car should be a good autocrosser, but unfortunately is still
overweight by a few hundred pounds. The best carrera 2 is the RS
America model which comes standard with all the performance options
(sport suspension, huge wheels, etc). This RS model is a bit lighter
(less heavy?) and actually costed less. And finally you could order a
Porsche without air conditioning! An RS is not meant to be a luxury
car. Have I offended anyone yet?
	
The 993 was introduced for the 1995 model year, with the first
major change to the 911 shape. The 3.6 engine was further refined
to produce about 270 HP and more torque. But the biggest
advantage to autocrossers (except the lower price!) is the rear
suspension. It is now mounted in a subframe with modern links which
keep the suspension pointed in the right direction. This allowed
Porsche to make a much better balanced car, which does not understeer
as much as the previous 911. The 993 will prove to be the fastest 
Porsche ever on the autocross course, and should be able to keep up
with any other production car.

I have not mentioned the different body configurations. Theoretically,
the best body for autocrossing is a coupe without a sunroof (sunroofs
add weight in exactly the wrong place). But for a basically stock
Porsche, the body style does not matter much. A Targa or Cabriolet
with stock springs (torsion bars) will handle fine, although they are
slightly heavier. It seems that the fastest stock 911s are often open
cars. That about wraps it up for the 911 line. Next I will cover
the other Porsche models.

Subject: 914 1.8 liter FI: broken air box temp sensor

I've got a '74 1.8 liter 914 that I'm trying to get into tune, and
found a (possible) problem *within* my intake air sensor.

Do any 1.8 liter FI wizards out there have any advice on this?

My intake air Temperature Sensor is broken.  This is a very small
device made from a couple of pieces of metal and a spring; it's
*inside* the air box, sticking out into the airflow just before the
sensor flap.  Two leads from this device stick up into compartment
with the PC board and potentiometer, and plug into the connector going
to the FI wiring harness.

I found my temp sensor was physically broken; the metal parts are
dangling loose, I can't tell what the spring was supposed to do, and
there may even be some missing plastic pieces.

The Previous Owner shorted the leads from the sensor together,
probably thinking that a temp sensor resistance of zero was "normal".
This seems to work *somewhat* well; the car runs okay (but not great)
like this, and won't run at all if the temp sensor resistance is
infinity!

Does anyone know how this sensor really works?  What are the metal
contacts and that tiny spring supposed to do as the temperature
changes?  And most important: anyone know the nominal "cold" and
"warm" resistance values that this device is supposed to report?

Thanks very much for any advice or suggestions...

|
| I know I can buy a used transaxle, but right now I am only

| ( this way I can still have matching number, I don't know

| the following questions:
|
|     Is the amount of efforts required in replacing the  R & P is
|     the same as rebuilding the trans, completely?

Caveat #1: I've never rebuilt a tranxaxle. The following is what
I have gleaned from the factory service manual plus talking to
others.

That said, my understanding is that the R&P is the hardest
part of the trans to do, with several precise adjustments/shims
to be made (pinion gear lash).

|     Is there a alternative i.e. replace R & P with absolute minimum
|     amount of transaxle disassembly.

Hmm, if your R&P is shredded, the tranny probably has metal
fragments throughout. You would want to completely disassemble
just to clean and inspect everything. You might have bearings that
are scored from metal particles.

|     Who sells better ( strong, light weight??? ) Ring & Pinions?
|     Are these R & P interchangeable between later models of 944.
|     i.e. can I buy a stock 89-951 R & P and through that into my
|     existing unit.

Special purpose R&P will most likely cost more than stock, but I've
never priced them.

|     Haynes Manual is very vague about rebuilding the Transaxle. Does
|     the shop manual cover this subject in more detail.

The shop manual is an absolute pre-requisite. It devotes a full volume
to the transaxle and has the entire proceedure detailed. Some special
tools are required and access to a hydraulic press is probably a good
idea. Some of the special tools are press mandrels and some are
measuring gauges. I'd buy, beg, or borrow a shop manual and take a
look to see if this is something that you want to attempt. I know folks
who have done 901/915 transaxles who say that it is not really all that
hard. Perhaps this also applies to 944 transaxles.

Hi,

If you are going to get an alarm installed in a 911,  make sure you have the
installer show you where the brain is installed. My parents had a Clifford
installed in their '87 911 targa about 5 years ago. Only now after having had
the A/C checked (never really needed it in the Bay Area, Miami is a different
story), did we find out that the brain was installed behind the floor boards
covering the A/C air intake giving us less cold air output.  I didn't want to
fool around with the wiring so I just screwed to the back of the floor board.


In my '73 911 targa, the alarm was installed in the trunk which is great
because the trunk can be locked and there is no easy way for a thief to get
to it.

Subject: 911 A/C and rotary compressors

Hi,

I wrote about Porsche alarms in an earlier post and mentioned that we had the
A/C checked out. The A/C mechanic told us that we had a leaking evaporator
and wanted to replace it for $1275  (including dryer and freon). He said that
he could see it dripping it oil, which he didn't point out to me and I
couldn't see, and the whole unit looked like it had not been taken out to be
examined- still had dust all over it.  Furthermore, he wanted to charge me
around $1000 for an evaporator that Linda at Carleson Porsche can sell me for
$420. I know that he make money off parts, but that was really ridiculous.
Needless to say, we went to an even more disreputable place and had the car
recharged w/o a leak test for $60. 

Anyway, I see advertisements for rotary changeover kits at varying prices.
Which compressor is good and which one should be avoided at all costs
 (Nippondenso, Sanden, etc) ?  Will a bracket from a late model 911  fit a
'73 911 2.4 engine?  Also, if I take out my piston compressor and put in a
rotary, which reciever/dryer do I need to buy- i.e. an '83 or before or an
'84 and after? I don't want to mix and match stuff and come out with a
mismatched A/C system that doesn't run well. 

Lastly, does anybody know the lengths of the different A/C hoses that run all
over the car? I would like to have some made and install them myself, but I
would prefer not to have to take out the old ones until I'm ready to put the
new ones in. That way I know where everything belongs and am less likely to
lose any hose brackets.

Had a similar problem with my first car, an old Plymouth.
Turned out to be bad rings.  Really bad.  When the engine

When it's hot, things expand, the compression gets a bit

Porsche manuals are cumulative. Any info that is covered in a previous

manual for a prior years model, but I am not sure which. Perhaps what
you need is in the '84-'89 manual. Ask the dealer if they have that manual

fine, but I will be replacing them anyways sometime this summer.
  Anyways, to make a long story short, the timing belt is tensioned

balance shaft belt seems quite loose.......I don't have the 9201 
tool, but someone else on P-files once said that he set the tension 
on this balance shaft belt with the proper tool and after he was done 
it could be twisted 180 degrees.  If that is the case, mine is fine.  
  Any words of wisdom?  Is it normal for this belt to seem much

p.s. Lessons learned:

1.  Think twice about working in a public storage facility.  Thieves may
roam the premises looking for people who work there, and once they know
that you have a shop set up there, they figure that you must have tools.
What apparently happened in my case was that the thief (or thieves) were
following legitimate tenants into the facility (thus getting through
the security gate) then waiting until after everyone left, then going to
work cutting locks and loading up their truck (or trucks).

2. Get comprehensive insurance on your project car, even if you're not
driving it. If parts of the car are ripped off, your homeowner's or
renter's insurance probably won't cover it.

3. Inventory your tools. Probably the easiest way is with a video camera.
Save and annotate all your receipts, even if they aren't tax deductible.

No.. They machine the CASE for and *EVEN* deck (i.e. all of the cylinder spigots
the same distance from the case centerline). *THEN* you build the short
block, and measure the deck height of the installed pistons. You *MAY* have to
machine the pistons or shim the cylinders to get the deck height you want.

I run all my air cooled cars at between 8.5:1 and 12:1. I run pump
super unleaded (92 or 93) in everything until I get to 10:1, then
run between 101 and 110 octane unleaded race gas in anything higher. You'll
be just fine at 9:1 on super unleaded. *IF* it's really 9:1 (MEASURE
EVERYTHING TWICE!!!)

Subject: Bleeding Brakes

I have replaced several master cylinders in various brands of automobile,
and without exception, the only way to get a good pedal when replacing the
master is to bench bleed the unit.  So far I have not heard anyone mention
this procedure being done, so I guess I'll add my 2 cents worth.  Attach
some sort of reseviour to the master cylinder, and buy a couple of lengths
of brake line that fit the ports on the master.  Attach the said brake
lines to the master cylinder, and bend them so that they end up in the
reseviour (spelling doesn't look right<g>).  After you have the lines in
both places, put the whole unit on a vise or some similar holding fixture,
and figure out some way of pushing the piston in on the master.  I
typically use a phillips screwdriver with a vaccuum line cap over the end. 
Then do several full strokes of the master cylinder, and several small
strokes, near the beginning, middle, and end of the pistons travel, then do
the full strokes again.  You will be amazed at how much air you get out of
the unit in those little strokes.  Don't stroke too fast or brake fluid
will squirt out and get you.  If you can, cap the ends of the brake lines
going into the reseviour.  This way you won't get any air back into the
piston chambers.  On cars with an integral reseviour, you can leave the
whole setup together, and bolt the unit into the car.  If you have a
separate res., just do your best to keep the fluid inlets from draining. 
After you have the unit bolted in the car, with whatever reseviour you have
filled and attached, then remove the bent brake lines, attach the car's
brake lines, letting a little fluid run between the threads of the master
and car brake lines.  Unless you have air in your car's brake system, you
should already have a firm pedal, and will just have to flush the old fluid
from the rest of the system.  Be sure to rinse any brake fluid you spilled
thouroghly, and double check all fittings for tightness, observing
reccomended torque specs.

Standard disclaimer:  These are proceedures taken from various
manufacture's brake systems manuals, and may not be applicable to every
car, particularly with ABS brake systems.  Always consult your service
manual to check if your car has different steps for master cylinder bench
bleeding.

Maybe this will all help someone, or if I am sounding silly or such, flame
me and I'll stop<g>.

 Yes, un fortunatly, replacing the ring and pinion on ANY transaxle is a
major job, with special tools up the you-know-what required.  The pinion is
one of the main shafts on these things, and will require complete
dismatling.  Setting up a ring and pinion is a real b*tch without ALL the
right tools (and can be a real pain even with the tools).  As to brands,

Subject: 911 brakes, bearings and wheel painting

Hey,

I had intended to re-pack my front wheel bearings today after
work, but when I loosened the brake line connection at the 
caliper, the hard line was turning along with the nut.  My
incredible deductive powers enabled me to decide that twisting 
the hard line in half falls into the category of "bad things".  I
coated the thing with Liquid Wrench and gently worked it
back and forth, but no go.  Has anyone run into this problem
before?  Is this a problem?  Should I attack the other end of
the hard line that attaches to the strut?

Since my bearing packing was a bust, I went ahead and replaced
my squeaky brake pads with MetalMasters.  No more squeaks.

I also painted the black centers of my 7x15 Fuchs.  I use the
Wurth "Matte Black" wheel paint.  Contrary to public opinion,
I think matte black is the correct color to replicate the factory
shade of black.  It turned out great.  The centers of my wheels
look like new, the aluminum outer rims looks 20 years old (because
they are). 

I've wasted enough bandwidth...

  Just wanted to throw in my 2 cents on some of the confusion on what 
the m474 option code was on 944 or 951 models.  I have an entire list 
of option codes and m474 is the sport shock option.  This is NOT the 
sport suspension kit.  The sport suspension option was 030 or "club 
sport package."  The m474 option was indeed standard on the 951, 
according to my list.  There was also a 637 code which was 
"Performance handling package" for 944/944s/951.  Again according to 
my list this code had to be ordered with the 030 code.
  Also, according to my fiche, the turbo S spec  Koni shocks are 
stiffer on their softest setting(they are externally adjustable) than 
the m474 sport shocks..........
  Anyone know what the spring rates were (ft/pds) on the turbo S 951?

I've gotta thank a lot of you for telling me where I went wrong in
assuming that the catalytic converter didn't affect the "measured"
air/fuel ratio.  It's a lesson I've been taught a thousand times,
but still haven't learned (apparently).  Think before you speak.

Everyone's right.  The measured O2/fuel ratio downstream from the cat
is different from upstream.  So...if you're using an O2 sensor to adjust
your FI or carbs, which is what this was all about, if you have a late
model car you need to insert it upstream of the cat.  On the other hand,
if you have a good old fashioned car that was produced before all the
exotic emission control paraphenalia was hung all over perfectly good
engines, like all my cars, then you don't have a cat, and you can stick
the O2 sensor right up the tailpipe and measure the fuel/air ration
with abandon and accuracy.

It really is a good way of seeing what your engine is doing.

Try the Century Breverra booster seat.  It looks like a mini

The seat I've got has been discontinued and replaced with a model
that has a revamped internal seatbelt system and a clip to hold
an external shoulder belt in place.  I don't know if the new model
has a different name.  The old one is a good deal as local stores are
closing them out at $21.  I think the new one goes for $55.

          I noticed that Vic Lee is also looking for rear belts.  My
          1979 911 also came without belts, and since I didn't want
          retractables I went and bought a pair from Automotion.
          They're OK, but I wish I had also tried Professionally
          Engineered Products (800-593-8787).  They are on page 38 of
          the May Pano.

          I had assumed that the bolts needed to fit the threads in
          the stock rear seat belt anchors were metric.  Stoddard
          wanted something like $15 each.  It was the folks at the
          above company that told me the threads were Standard, either
          7/16 or 9/16 (I can't remember).  Anyway, Grade 8 bolts from
          my local hardware store cost me about $1 each.  I just had
          to cut off about 1/2 inch with a Dremel tool and they fit
          fine.  BTW, the parts manual also shows a number of spacers
          and washers between the body, the belt, and the bolt.  These
          I did buy from Stoddards.

Oh good, a chance for me to contribute to entropy by adding more confusion.

My '87 951's sticker (yes, I still have it) indicates $260 extra for "Sport
Shock Absorbers". These were yellow Boge shocks, non-adjustable (at least
as far as I ever knew).  FWIW, I replaced them with the yellow Koni gas
adjustables, and the Konis (at softest setting) are definitely _not_
stiffer in jounce than the Boges were. Although, since the Konis are
gas-pressurized, it may be just a difference in the subjective feel of the
gas shock.

In any event, the Konis (and perhaps any gas-filled shock) are a definite
improvement over non-gas pressurized shocks. On or off the track, IMHO.

Mike,

That always seems to happen as the lines get older.  The steel lines corrode
and freeze to the brake line nuts.  My advice is to get new lines (they're
cheap) and just turn the old ones out, even if they break.  Then lightly coat
the outside of the new line that is covered by the nut with antiseize.  Don't
get any on the flare, or into the line itself, I'm not to sure that brake
fluid and antiseize "get along".  This will prevent future corrosion, and the
nuts will spin freely the next time you disassemble them.  Don't waste your
time taking the old lines off and freeing up the old nuts.  Once the cad
plating is gone, they'll freeze up again no matter what you do; I know...once
burned, twice learned!

Since there's a lot of brake discussions about, and I'm a newbie, I'll throw
my questions into the mix ....

Car: 72 914 ( with 73 2.0 and tranny / weber carb ).

#1) Rear left caliper is leaking fluid through the threaded hole that goes
    against the trailing arm.  Can't seem to see any bleed valves / adjusters
    in that hole.  What's it for ?  Brakes are bled from an outer valve.
    Should there be a bolt through the trailing arm into the caliper?
    (but the right one doesn't leak, just the left).

#2) If I need to rebuild, I might consider getting the 911 Master Cylinder
    and 911 calipers from Automobile Atlanta.  But their catalog doesn't
    say if these calipers are for the front or the rear.  Anyone out there
    with any knowledge on this ?  Also - would MOST appreciate any advice
    or tips on this setup.  (Thanks to Dave Darling, Too !!!!).

I wouldn't worry about the age of the car so much. The SC's really do have a
tremendous reputation for longevity. I personally would prefer a good

A good idea. The 928, while a great automobile, is not really a sports car.
It's too big and heavy. Since it was not made in the same numbers as the 944

FI is Fuel Injection. All 911's since the early 70's have had FI. Almost all
cars today have it (FI replaces carburators, and are now computer
controlled).

In 1984 the 911 was changed from the SC to the 911 Carerra. The engine was
increased in size from 3.0l to 3.2l. The FI system was changed to DME
(Digital Motronic Engection [Injection in German], a Bosche system).
Horsepower went from 180 to 200. Other things on the car were changed as
well. There is no doubt that the 84+ cars are better than the SC, it's just
that they are more expensive. The 84-89 cars have the same excellent
reliability of the 78-83 911 SC cars.

This sounds like an excellent deal. One very important fact that you  will
hear again and again it to have the car checked by a Porsche mechanic prior
to  purchase. These cars are complicated, and a problem that would escape an
average mechanic can cost big $$$ to correct. An exam should cost around
$100, and can save you many $$$ more than that. It can also give you
negotiation room.

I have always liked the 944. I bought an 86 944 last year. After driving it
for a year, I was very happy with the car, but I wanted more performance. I
thought about buying an 84+ 911, or a 944 Turbo. I drove one SC, and one
Carerra. I was very disappointed in the 911. After driving the 944, the 911
felt very primitive. It had a very heavy clutch, and a very loose
transmission. Finding the right gear was very difficult. I also didn't like
the interior layout, I couldn't see the gauges through the steering wheel.
The car was quick, but not a rocket.  I then drove a 944 Turbo. What a blast!
The car was amazingly fast, noticable faster than the 911. It also shifted
muich easier. The car was just much more comfortable. After that I decided
against the 911, and concentrated on the 944.
I eventually found an 89 944 TurboS. The last year of the 944 Turbo. I spent
$17K for a car with 43K miles, in excellent condition. This car has 250HP,
and is much faster than the 84-89 Carerra's.

I am not against the 911, they certainly have their advantages. When people
think of Porsche, they think 911. The 911 also has a tremendous resale value.
If you really want a 911, then by all means buy one. They are great cars,
just not for me.

Reasons why I like the 944 over the 911:

The 944 is an easier car to drive fast than a 911. The 944 has 50/50 weight
distribution. The 944 has 60% of the wight behind the rear wheels. This makes
that car very tail happy, and difficult to drive at the limit. 

I like to drive on the track. As a member of the Porsche Club of America, you
can take part in Driver Education days, which take place on a race track.
This is where you get to drive your car as it was meant to be driven. You
will have an instructor, but there are no police, speed limits, etc. This is
the most fun part about owning a Porsche. The 944 is perfectly set for the
track, while the 911 will make you work much harder.

Then there's the price factor. For a normally aspirated, mint condition 944,
you can expect to pay less than $10K. For $15-18K you should be able to find
a 1989+ 944S2 or TurboS model. These cars have ABS and dual airbags. The
TurboS model has 250HP. The 944 S2 has 210HP. Both have more HP than the
911SC (180) or the Carerra (200). The 911 will not have ABS or airbags. 

You might be able to find a 944S2 Cabriolet for less than $20K. If you really
want a Cab, this might be the car for you. All 944s come with removable
sunroofs, but there was no Targa model.

Anyway, good luck in your search. If you want/need any more information just
let me know. As you can see (or read) I love Porsches, and could go on and on
about them (I think I just did). If you REALLY want info on Porsches, there
is an internet mailing list that generates about 100 posts a day. Let me know
if you are interested, and I'll tell you how to join. I can also find a
mechanic in your area for you through the list.

Subject: 914: Questions from a Potential Buyer

I went and looked at a '75 914 over the weekend on a whim.  After taking 
a ride, I decided that I gotta have one (but not the one I looked at).  
I've looked at the FAQ and have decided to restrict my search to a '73 
or later 2.0.  Other than the well documented rust problems, can the 914 
be a reliable, reasonably low maintenance car?  

My plans for the car are for occasional street and Auto-X use.  I'm not 
looking for a project or for this car's maintenance to become my hobby.  
My initial thoughts are to restrict myself to <$5K.  I'm hoping I can 
get a well maintained, low (no) rust, low maintenance vehicle for that 
price.  Any advise on what to look for, whether my quest is even 
feasible, what upgrades are desirable and what upgrades are not...  
Thanks,

Don't know the spring rates off hand (a good question for the spec
book - if I could only find that one...) but I know I've got the
highest rate springs listed on my car. 8-)

As for the Konis.  Remember that the sport yellow units for the M030
package for the turbo S is a special unit.  These units are set up to
handle a threaded sleave so that the spring pearch is adjustable.  The
soft setting is really quite comfortable, but a little too much so for
agressive driving.  For rallies I turn them up to pretty much full
stiff - the rear shocks are set just down from full stiff.

My turn.:)

These are from the 1987 944 options list that was posted some time back:

030     Club Sport Package                      1,982
220     Limited Slip Differential                 741

                                     (944 Turbo)  677
Option 637 must be ordered with option 030.
*Standard Equipment 944 Turbo.

Maybe this list is in error.  The shocks that my car has
are black and I assume they are the originals.  According to
the shop manuals the standard shocks for '87 951s are black
F&S with the Boges and Konis being options.  So, the shocks
in the M474 package that started this whole discusion are
definitely not the standard base level shock offered for
951s.  I assume they are better for performance purposes,
and assuming my shocks are original it's about time to 
replace them at 85k miles...

Hey;

Had the exact same problem with my 84 911. You can try the other end of the
line and loosen it. Chances are you will get the same results.. no go! I
recommend replacing these lines anyway. They are about $10 each. Use anti
seize on the new lines and bleed the brakes as usual. A chancy way is to
leave it alone (if you have not damaged the lines) and very gently and
carefully (while praying) move the caliper with the line connected away
from the disk. Then you can remove the disk and replace the caliper back on
the strut using one screw to hold it in place till done. I really do not
recommend this last note since it can weaken the lines (which have already
been tweaked by your masterful hands).

        Hope this helps, Ehab :))

Hey,

I had intended to re-pack my front wheel bearings today after
work, but when I loosened the brake line connection at the
caliper, the hard line was turning along with the nut.  My
incredible deductive powers enabled me to decide that twisting
the hard line in half falls into the category of "bad things".  I
coated the thing with Liquid Wrench and gently worked it
back and forth, but no go.  Has anyone run into this problem
before?  Is this a problem?  Should I attack the other end of
the hard line that attaches to the strut?

Since my bearing packing was a bust, I went ahead and replaced
my squeaky brake pads with MetalMasters.  No more squeaks.

I also painted the black centers of my 7x15 Fuchs.  I use the
Wurth "Matte Black" wheel paint.  Contrary to public opinion,
I think matte black is the correct color to replicate the factory
shade of black.  It turned out great.  The centers of my wheels
look like new, the aluminum outer rims looks 20 years old (because
they are).

I've wasted enough bandwidth...

Thwen and Rick,

My earlier response was garbled, so here's what it should have said:

I have a '74 1.8 with Riviera's and have put 195/60 15 Yokohama 388's on 
with no problems.  I have over 8,500 miles with no evidence of wear.  
They stick a lot better than my old P6's.  I've had no problems with the 
fit under the stock fenders.  I got the set with road hazard, mounting, 
balancing, new stems and lifetime rotations for $285 at Price Club.  
Granted, these aren't A008's, but they are doing very well for my daily 
driving (and my wife doesn't complain about the stiffness).

Vic Lee writes about a Century Breverra booster seat that fits the 911
rear seat.  After reading his post this morning, and since I am looking
for a better child seat myself.  I when over to Toy-R-Us to see what they
had.
 
The seat that Vic has, is two generations old.  Toy-R-Us had two
Breverra's.  One (last one they had of that model, for $59) has the
built-in shoulder and lap belt.  The seat is strapped to the car by using
the lap belt threaded through the backside of the seat.  So, if it fits in
the back seat of a 911, then it would work.
 
The newer seat that they have uses the car's 3 point seat belt to strap
the child to the seat (with a shoulder clip to make sure the shoulder
strap is placed properly on the child), and therefore the seat to the car.
So, this seat would not work in most 911 with only a lap belt.  And the
instructions state that the seat should only be used with a 3 point seat
belt.

Hi gang,

While riding to work this morning in my car-pool, and wishing I was driving
my '86 Carrera Cabriolet (thus providing Porsche content to this otherwise
nonsensical message), I saw two things that gave me a grin or three...

First was a vanity plate DV DT on the back of a new Rx7 (the guy was 
wishing it was a 911, os I could add a bit more Pcar content)

(hint, the first derivative of velocity, with respect to time...)

Times up.  (You knew it meant accelleration, all along...)  ummm hummmm...

The other was a bumper sticker "If Clinton's the answer, the question was
a stupid one!"

Ok, Ok, I admit, I'm pretty easily amused, at that...

Have a Great Weekend, I'm off for some Zuffenhausen therapy as we speak...

Cheers

A new symptom has been cropping up randomly.
When I turn the headlight switch off on my

as normal, but then extends the headlights
and retracts, with the lights off, a small
number of times before quitting.  I suspect
a relay problem.  Does anyone have a

Subject: RE: 944 Cooling Fan

After more observation and thinking, I see a way for the variation in fan
startup temps. There are two different temperature sending units. The
fan temperature sensor is on the radiator. The temp gauge sending unit
is in the head. There is a thermostat between the two. So, a sticking
thermostat could be one explanation of the water in the head getting
much hotter than the radiator. This could also be caused by coming
to an idle after running at speed for a while. The rate at which water
flows from the engine to the radiator is RPM dependent (the water
pump is driven by the engine), so at idle, the head could rise in
temparature much more quickly than the radiator. Since I have
a new thermostat, I am attibuting the variations in fan startup
"observed" temperature to the different rates at which water
circulates through the engine. In fact, the fans may always be
starting at the same temperature; the same radiator temperature
that is. The car seems to be runnign fine, so I am going to stop
worrying about it!

I bought mine from the Price Club (Costco). Most I've seen in the $30-$40 
CDN range are made in China (which is not to say there is anything wrong 
with that). When I bought mine (actually my second one as the first seem 
weak),I considered :

1. The minimum height the cup will go. I've found that on my '86 944, I have
   to drive up on a board just to give it the extra 0.5 cm clearance to slide
   the jack in. Also, I'm using the 'jack-plate' from Automotion,
   designed to protect the bottom of the car. In all the work I've done on
   the car, I've only jacked it up using the jack-point at the center of the
   rocker panel (Is this ok for the car?). There is usually no problem
   sliding the jack out after you lower the car as the suspension hasn't
   been loaded yet.

2. The thickness of the steel used for the jack. Of course the thicker the
   better. My first jack was made of thinner steel and I didn't want to take
   a chance.

I am certainly no expert, but I have experience. I bought a "restored 
356B cabrio in 1991 for $24k and spent the next year and $10k in 
restoring it, plus another 4k for an engine rebuild. It is a good driver 
but some distance below concours. I could probably get maybe $25k to $30k 
and it is a good-looking car. $40k should get you a really good cabrio. 
Before you decide on any 356, spend the money (do as I say not as I did) 
and get a 356 restorer to look at it from top to bottom. Don't  use any 
restorer, but one who has done 356s. There are things that a non-356 
restorer will not catch. If you intend to drive it be sure that the 
suspension, steering, and brakes are ok. You can get good advice from MI 
Ron Roland, 28140 26 Mile Road in Chesterfield and Vic Skirmants at 27244 
Ryan Road, Warren (at that address you can join the 356 Registry which 
you should do even before you own a 356. Pay no attention to mileage or 
what anyone tells you about the engine rebuild. As the Maestro (Harry 
Pellow) maestro@aol.com says "There are a lot of turkeys out there and 
most of them are rebuilding 356 engines" . IMHO there is no reason other 
than driving a 356 frequently for buying one. By the way, you are in the 
middle of a minefield and need all the help you can get and not just from 
anyone who volunteers to look at the LA car for you.

Hi again,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the third of nine columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

There have been several requests for permission to use this material
in PCA newsletters, etc. Please ask before using it, but basically
any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted. If not too
difficult, I would like a copy of the publication with my material.

Three Wheeling By Mike Piera, CT valley region PCA, #3 of 9

The last chapters covered the 911 models. All of these non-turbo
911 models are in the same SCCA class - A stock. That is why it is
very important to pick a good year and model. The other cars in A
Stock include the Lotus Elans (originals are incredibly light and fast),
BMW M3 (better balanced than a 911, can win on a flowing course)
and the Toyota MR-2 turbo. In '92 - '94 the Porsches were destroyed
by the RX-7 twin-turbo, but the RX-7 is now in Super Stock with the 
Corvettes.
	
Your best bet in an A-Stock 911 would be the 993 (maybe for
'95 : in '96 it will probably move to Super Stock). Other
contenders would be the ever popular '72-'73 911S. These have
won AS as often as any other car, and since they were fairly new!
John Fergus, noted IMSA racer, won from '77 to '79 in one, and
I added wins in '85 and '90. E. Paul Dickinson won from '73 to '76
in a 911T (2.4?), so they seem competitive too. A 2.4 E should be
faster than the 2.4T, and the '74 Carrera could also win.
A Carrera-2 RS America could be a wildcard with the new BFG tires
which will work great on the stock 17" rims.

SCCA classes are used by almost every sports car
club in America, not just SCCA regions. In the Northeast there are
several smaller clubs which all use these rules. One of the best
small sports car clubs for autocrossing in the northeast is the
Fairfield County Sports car club in Connecticut. In the
Porsche Club there are seven classes for 911s, so many more
models are competitive. In P11, I would choose the 2.4 liter 911T, it
should be much faster than the 2.0 (T and E) and 2.2 T cars. In
P12, the 911E 2.4 or 911S 2.2 should be faster than the E 2.2, S 2.0,
or normal 2.7. In P13, the 911S 2.4, or '74 Carrera are the best bets,
and should also be able to beat the cars in P14 (easily) and
P15! In P14, there is only the 911SC, but the later models should be
slightly better unless you can find an early one without sunroof
and A/C. In P15, the Carrera 3.2 class, I would choose an '87 or 
newer car. In P16, the Carrera 2 should beat the Carrera 4 
(unless it rains or snows!) with the RS America the best bet.
The 993 competes in P17, and should be faster than any other stock 
Porsche. Seems like there are some neat options available on the
993 (no rear seats, no sunroof, etc).

I will continue covering Porsche models and their
potential for autocross competition with minimal modifications. 
No matter which Porsche you have, you should get the
factory shop manual and spec books for it. This is the only
documentation acceptable to SCCA for proving a car's legality.
This will also show you the best options available for your car.
In SCCA Stock class, any option available from the Porsche FACTORY
for your year and model may be used. This does not include dealer
installed options. If a limited slip differential was available
for your car, you can use it with no penalty. In the Porsche Club 
Rules (PCR's) you are usually penalized for a LSD or optional
wider wheels even if they were factory options.

The 911 Turbo or 930 variants should be covered now, here they are 
in a  nutshell. The first "Turbo Carrera" was offered in 1976, 
replacing the '75 Carrera 2.7. It had 245 HP and an aluminum 3.0 
engine. In '78 the "930" was improved with a bigger 3.3 liter 
intercooled engine producing 265 Horsepower, and with large 917
brakes. The 930 was discontinued in the USA after '79 until it was 
re-introduced in '86 (although these were the peak years of the 
"gray market" cars). The '86-'89 turbo had about 280 HP, with the 
'89 finally offering a 5-speed transmission. In '91 the Carrera 2
turbo was introduced, with the new chassis. It used the old engine,
but re-tuned to 315 HP. From '93 to '95 this car was available with 
the new version of the 3.6 engine, with about 355 HP. The latest 
993-based 911 twin-turbo has about 400HP and all wheel drive.
What can I say about this car, except "let me drive one"!

In SCCA all these 911 turbos compete in "Super Stock" against the 
very fast Corvette, RX-7 twin turbo, and 928 S4. So basically the 
newer the turbo model, the faster it will be. But these cars are not 
easy to autocross, so I would not advise them for a novice. Also, 
the Corvettes and Mazdas are hard to beat (but I would love to 
see someone finally do it!).

Getting back to our chronology, the 912 model was only built
for a few years ('65 to '69) aside the 911 as a more
affordable Porsche, until the 914 was released in 1970.
The best 912 was the last year, the '69. As with the 911, the '69
had a longer wheelbase and fenders flared for 6" rims. I believe
sway bars were also available (check those manuals!). A rust-free
'69 912 would be an interesting autocross car, but they are hard to
find with the original Solex carbs and original pistons and cylinders.
The 912 used the later 356 engine, not a VW based engine like the
914, so parts and rebuilds are not cheap (especially the fragile
crankshafts). Check the same areas as 911s for rust, as 912 rust
repair is very expensive compared to the value of the car.

In '76, the 912 was brought back for a year to fill the gap
as an affordable Porsche before the 924 was ready. The 912E was
a 911 with a 914/2.0 VW type engine, providing less than spectacular
acceleration. The 2.0 used was the worst of the 2.0 engines, with
low power and thermal reactors (which were often removed by owners).
These can be competitive in their class. But they are quite heavy
for their power, and clean ones are selling for about the price 
of a similar year 911. All 912s run in SCCA E-Stock
class, which is mostly small-size medium-powered FWD cars like GTIs,
Jettas, Saturns, etc. (also the 356 and 924). The FWD econoboxes can
out-accelerate a 912 but a 912 can put power down better (no wheelspin)
and handle better in most corners. Also the FDW cars can slalom better.
The 912 runs against the small-engined 914 in the PCA, which should
be hard to beat.

The 914 was the first mass-produced mid-engined sports car. It was
introduced as a 1970 model as the 914/4 1.7 liter and 914/6 2.0 liter.
914s used thinner sheet metal than 911s and are very light, about 2000
pounds for the early models. The front suspension is basically the
same as a 911. Several VW components were used to hold down costs,
such as the 4 cylinder engine. These have always been very popular and
competitive autocross cars, and are now approaching cult-car status.

The early 1.7 cars had no sway bars and a transmission with a terrible
shift linkage. But the worst feature was the 4 1/2" wide wheels.
In 1973, there were great improvements with the "side-shifter"
transmission, and optional sway bars and 5 1/2" by 15" alloy wheels.
The '73 is the best small-engine (1.7 or 1.8) 914. The '74 1.8 model
may be good also, but they used a different fuel injection
which was only used in that model. These small engine 914s are in
SCCA D-Stock class, which is mostly higher powered small cars like
the Dodge Neon, CRX-Si, etc. (also the 924 Turbo). 

The 914/2.0 four-cylinder offered in '73 was what the 914 should have
been all along. The engine was very torquey with about 95 horsepower.
It came with appearance group, 5 1/2" mags, sway bars, etc. The '74
model could be ordered without some options (appearance group) to make
it lighter. In '75-'76 the 914 1.8 and 2.0 went downhill with heavy
bumpers, low power engines with thermal reactors, etc (just like the
911). These should be avoided for competition even in PCA classes. The
'73-'74 914/2.0 are great autocross cars, and were SCCA
C-Stock champions for a few years. The competition in CS
includes Mazda RX-7 non-turbo, Miata, Fiero formula, and 944 8-valve
models. This is a fun class for small rear-wheel drive sports cars.

The 914/6 was only available for a few years ('70-'72) and never sold
in high volumes. These have been very competitive in autocross, even
though they compete against the more powerful 911 in A-Stock. They
are lighter than the 911 and handle better in most situations. The
engines are very torquey but have low power and a low redline. The
engine used was from the '69 911T, the weakest 911 engine ever.
They also have the poor early shifter. The 914/6 was only available
with 5 1/2" wide rims, in either 14" or 15" diameter. No sways bars
or other performance options were available. The 914-6 GT is not
legal in Stock class because it was not imported from the factory,
it was a dealer installed kit. A good clean rust-free 'sixer' with
original mechanics is hard to find, and tend to be expensive. Most
have been updated due to the ease of upgrading to 911 parts and the
great performance potential. If you don't mind fiddling with Weber
carbs, a 914/6 can be a fun autocrosser.

All 914's tend to rust very badly. Check for rust in the rear
suspension mounts near the engine, the rocker panels, and under
the rear trunk mat. Be careful of poorly repaired rust, as the 914
can fold in half when the doors are opened with the top off! Check
door fitment for signs of sagging, and take the car to a good Porsche
repair shop for a professional opinion.

More to come!

Trond,
Not to raise red flags, but I shipped my car to the UK without doing my
homework first.  This resulted in the car being lost (read stolen, but 
without proof).  After seven months, two lawyers (I SHOULD have hired
the guy with the baseball bat and a penchant for swinging at knees...)
I finally found the car with the help of the State Police.

Ther is a LOT more to the story, but in the end, I finally shipped with a 
LARGE MAJOR carrier who had good references, GOOD INSURANCE, and obviously
cost more.  To me it was worth it.

I urge you to stay away from any small freight forwarders who will just 
subcontract the transport, and deal directly with a shipping company.  I also
recommend putting it in a container.  This is how I shipped mine back to the
US.  No problems with the container method (still with a reputable carrier).

Be VERY clear on the valuation and insurance, and if possible insure it through
anyone but the carrier.  Taking the carrier's insurance is not a bad idea, but
for me, the (first) carrier just ignored my efforts to file a claim.  A third
party insurance company would certainly launch a full investigation prior to
paying a claim, and that is exactly what I needed to have done.

Good luck.

Subject: New Porsche Color?

The May Pano has an article on the new 911 "Bi"-Turbo, and the two color
pictures show the car in an arresting shade of yellow-orange.  

Does anyone have the details on this color, e.g. name, paint codes, paint
supplier, etc? I'm assuming it's one of the "unique-to-the-turbo" colors.

TIA,

Hi All,
  I've located and purchased a '76 2.0.  This car is RUST FREE! I can't believe
it, but then again, it is/was a San Francisco Bay Area Car. First Sold to San
Mateo resident, then Redwood City, then Saratoga, and now Millbrae resident. I
looked at four cars and talked to about 9 prospects via telephone & E-Mail (tha
nks Porschephiles).  ALL had holes in body, or areas ready to become holes. I
am overwhelmed with this one 'cause I assumed (and was informed by some "expert
s") that I wouldn't find a Rust Free Car, even if it was Californian.  Well, I
just thought I'd pass it along to keep the hope up.  The rest of the vitals are
as follows:
Rebuilt top end and new Pistons/Cylinder aprox. 20K ago
Meticulous maintenance (all receipts from 2nd, and 3rd owners)
[ by the way, the second owner bought the car in 1977 for $8000 purchase
 price at %15.4 financing, Jimmy Carter in office?? (I was 12 years old, couldn
't vote)]
One small dent in rt, rear fender, rest of body straight like arrow.
EVERYTHING WORKS!!!!! (you must realize, I've owned a '72 Wisconsin Car..bad
news)
Rebuilt tranny aprox 40K ago (156K on odom)
No appearance group, but killer black BBS-Style Enkei Mags w/ polished rims.
"Spank Me" Yellow paint over Yellow original.
Tan Interior, Good Shape and again EVERYTHING WORKS!!!
Ok Ok Ok, I'll shut up.  Thanks for all replies, keep this People-Base the
excellent source of information it is, and please quit hacking each other!

They are not the same; they are different.  They may be close, but they
are not the same.

Ditto to the person who bought an almost-right hardware store 7/16"
bolt.  Yes, the threads of seatbelt bolts are 7/16 x 20, just like an
airframe bolt.  But the grip (unthreaded section) is different.  With
the hardware store bolt, instead of tightening down against the oversize
grip, allowing the belt anchor to pivot, you have probably tightened
against the anchor tab, which will lead to the bolt's backing out over
time.  Not to mention hardware stores' ability to stock counterfeit
junk bolts.

This is a *safety* item.  Someone's life may well depend on the quality
of the part you install.  Get the right part, please.  If I can help
by looking up the p/n on a fiche, happy to do so.  Just let me know

Subject: 022 dist. rebuild questions

I just bought a used 022 distributor for my 66 912.  (the car had a 009)  The 
drive gear on the 022 is somewhat loose and it looks like I could pull the one 
off of my 009 and put it on the 022.  The problem is I can't get the pin that 
holds the drive gear onto the distributor shaft out!  It looks like it should 
just press out.  I have pressed as hard as I dare but she won't budge.  Am I 
doing the right thing?  I put the distributor in my 912 and set static timing 
for 3 degrees BTDC.  I then checked the amount of advance at 1000 through 3500 
rpm with my friends big buck Snap-On timing light.  The amount of advance was 
low at the low end and about 38 degrees BTDC at 3500 rpm.  The reading were  
nice and stable.  I was not overly surprised to see the curve off on such an old 
distributor.  I know I can get rebuild parts from Stoddard and was planning on 
buying the shim kit, new springs, and the teflon sliding plate.  Has anyone else 
out there done this and if so did using these three things bring your advance 
curve back into spec?  The distributor shaft has no "noticeable" play, but the 
drive gear does wobble and the shaft can move up and down about a 1/16 of an 
inch.  The thread on distributors about a month or so ago convinced me to go for 
the 022 instead of the 050.  Don't let me down now!  TIA

Subject: Adding an Oil Cooler - 911T

I need some advice about adding an external oil cooler to a '72 911T.
I have been offered an aftermarket oil cooler.  Are there any pros
or cons to using particular oil coolers?  The oil cooler has AN12
fittings, and will be mounted in the normal right front fender
location.  Oil lines and fittings are available from a local shop.

Does the '72T oil filter housing contain a pressure relief valve and
thermostat?  This is mentioned in Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance
Handbook, but it isn't clear if these are items are physically in
place, or only an allowance for them to be added.  This car has never
had an external front oil cooler.

Also, how do I make the connections to the housing, tank, and cooler?
Any information would be appreciated.

You can put an amp on the driveline shelf behind the tuner (though the
heater makes this space hot), or under a seat.  If the amp is really
big, it can go in the rear well.

By cutting some sheet metal, you can fit some good 6" round speakers
in the stock spots, though the interior panels deaden it a bit.  Door
speakers will work too but they have to be thin if they're flush
mounted.  Otherwise, you can use 6x9s in boxes behind the back seat,
if you can stand the bite out of your cargo space.

And the stock front center speaker works well for the ham radio...

Removal of cam towers from '79 928 with engine still in car

1. Tools needed:
17mm box-end wrench
15mm box-end wrench
13mm box-end wrench
12mm box-end wrench
11mm box-end wrench
10mm box-end wrench
3/8 inch drive rachet
3/8 inch drive extensions, short
3/8 inch drive extensions, long
3/8 inch drive universal
3/8 inch drive metric sockets
6mm long handle Allen wrench
6mm short handle Allen wrench
6mm Allen wrench socket
screwdrivers, slotted and Phillips
3-inch gear puller
wrench to fit puller
oil catch pan
coolant catch pan

Gaskets needed:
- ---------------


step one 
- --------
driver side (The Easy Side) This should take about 3 hours 

remove cool air distributor from top of radiator (10mm wrench and 2 bolts.
remove airbox (13mm wrench is needed) and cool air intakes.
remove distributor from cam tower with 15mm wrench.  Plug up the hole with a 
	rag.  
remove cam drive gear with 17mm wrench and use puller to remove cam drive gear.
remove woodruff key from cam.
remove coil and let hang.
remove 3 10mm bolts that hold on the end cam bearing.  Use puller to carefully
	remove bearing carrier.
remove the 6 rubber oil plugs in cam tower top (don't loose them; they're $5 
	a piece). 
disconnect brake booster vacuum line and assorted vacuum lines in the area and 
	remember where they go.
remove the power steering line to the PS pump.  Use the oil catch pan to get 
	most of the mess.
*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************
Now pay close attention hear; the 6 allen bolts are inside the cam tower.  If
you drop one into the cam tower and are very lucky, you MIGHT be able to get it
out with a magnet.  However, if you're like everone else, you won't.  This 
means that the cam or followers and cups will have to come out to get these
bolts.  I'll remind you of this again when it is time to put the cam towers
back on.  Since I had to take the cams out anyway, I let them fall inside the
cam tower.
****************************************************************************
****************************************************************************

remove the bolts holding on the cam tower; 6 on top and 12 (?) on the bottom.
	Do the bottom bolts first so if the tower flexes and binds (it does)
	it won't make it too difficult to get the bolts out.  All the bolts
	(top and bottom) are 6 mm allen bolts, and you'll need an assortment
	of 6mm allen wrenches, L's and socket types to get all of them out.
	Space below the cam tower is the real pain.
Remove the top of the power steering resevoir.
Remove the cam tower.  Pay very close attention here because the followers
	will head south to the floor.  If you need to, remove the followers
	from the tower as you pull the tower out through the front of the
	engine.  Just remember which one went where.  Also, the assembly is
	HEAVY.  Be careful not to drop it on your $1200 radiator.
Remove the gasket and cover the area with clean towels.  It is off!  Have 
	many beers and apologize to whatever critters you kicked or swore
	at (including S.O.'s).

***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************

Step Two
- --------
Passenger Side (The Hard Side) This should take about 4 hours

remove the 3-inch water hose to the radiator.
remove the 1/2-inch water line from the resevoir to the thermostat back.
remove the 1-inch water hose from the resevoir collector to the engine front.
Try and catch most of the water with the pans.
remove the smog pump air delivery tube on the cam tower (2-10mm bolts).
disconnect the hoses to said tube and move out of the way.
remove vacuum lines that are in the way.
remove the 10mm bolt that holds the electrical wire harness to the tower.
disconnect the distributor lead near computer module and move out of the way.
tie the wiring harness to the strut brace so the cam tower can be moved out
	under the wires.
remove the rubber plugs (6).
remove the bottom bolts first (12(?) really hard ones to get to).
remove the upper bolts (6) after ALL of the bolts have been removed.
remove the cam tower with out pinching the A/C lines on the side of the engine
	bay by tilting the top out just a little.  This also helps keep the
	cups from falling earth-ward.  Maneuver under the wires and out the
	front without hitting your radiator again.
Both are out.  Drink heavily and clean your wrenches.

****************************************************************************
****************************************************************************
****************************************************************************
Again, if you drop one of the upper bolts into the cam tower, you are basically
screwed, and will have to remove the cups and followers to get the bolt(s) and
washer(s) out.  I used stainless steel clamps from a medical supply store to
grab onto and push the bolt into its hole before I started tightening them
up.  Are they called suitures?  They're the things all the Stoners used to
hold their roaches.  Anyhow, they work great and are thin enough and strong
enough to grab the bolt and maneuver blindly in the tower looking for their 
respective hole.
************************************************************************
************************************************************************
************************************************************************

If you are going to replace the cams, remove all cups and followers, and the
rear seal cup (3-10mm bolts and a cork gasket) and remove the cam.  When the
cam is out, clean thoroughly.  Don't forget to buy lots of gaskets.


Installation is basically the reverse of removal, except for the gaskets.
Use new ones, and make sure that the oil gallyies (sp?) that supply the lifters
are both open.

What I found wrong on my engine:
1. 1 bolt inside left and right cam tower was loose
2. Both cam tower gaskets were covering my lifter supply holes on both sides

I would say that if you do not know who fixed your car/engine, take it apart
yourself and VERIFY that it was done right.  The schmuck who worked on your
car last probably doesn't love it like you do.

Any questions, please call or write.

The 924 hot start problem was solved by updating the 20 cc fuel

The CD player is not the problem - its the CD changer. On the C2/C4s, it
is possible to mount a 6-disc changer in the glovebox, but I was told that
the pre '89 car dash internals makes that pretty tricky, so it goes in the
trunk. Sony have a mini-size 6-disc changer (CDX T60) that doesnt take so
much of a bite out of that already tiny space - get it side-mounted at the
front-right, screwed onto a board installed vertically under the carpet
as far towards the back as possible. Get a dash unit with a CD slot (the
Sony CDX900 is great) so you can bring more CDs to use after you get
through the 6 upfront.

I just got it done... 3 Carver amps under the seats, two fibreglass
enclosures replacing the rear-seat side panels that hold the subs, sounds
great! the factory Atlanta was lousy.

Re: Original .022 Distributor-
       Let's see, your nice, Original .022 Distributor has too much timing
advance, a wobbly shaft and a worn drive unit. How surprising! It sounds like
one of the hundred or so I've been keeping around for spare parts when the
time comes. As you have found, replacing the drive portion of the distributor
is not a trivial task. Failure to remove the drive locking pin properly wll
result, of course, in a ruined drive and/or shaft and/or  distributor. It is
best done using a press with proper support by  someone  who's done it
(successfully) before.
     Should you be fortunate enough to remove it successfully (or have it
removed successfully) and continue  with the rebuild, once done there is
still a high probability that it won't work right. (.022's  are fiendishly
clever like that.)
     It is for these reasons (and more) that a new .050, with smooooth
advance up and down, stable spark timing, decent high speed advance,
reasonable cost, and ease of installation (as long as your distributor drive
has been installed correctly, the .050 will fit in and its capacitor will
clear the oil return line from the oil  filter can), is a better deal..
    You oughta give the .050 a second thought. And I'd be curious how your
.022 distributor rebuild turns out.

The last time I drove through Oregon (from Eureka, CA to Eugene

The sucker took a shit on me about halfway through the drive
(brake vacuum booster & power steering unit went South).  Avis 
was nice enough (after arguing for an hour that there was NOTHING
wrong with the car) to give me a cab ride to the fair and back.
I specified that I wanted either a Caddy or a Lincoln with
Oregon plates.  When I went back to pick up the car I asked them
where my Lincoln was.  Girl said, "We couldn't get you a Lincoln
but you'll like this so much better".  It was a Lebaron drop top,
arrest me red, with California plates.  Might as well painted a
bullseye on my head.  Took about half an hour in the airport
parking lot to figure out the top (you can just imagine my condition-
dark night, no owners manual, and me, well... enhanced)
Need I say I drove to Grant's Pass in a perfectly straight
line at or under the speed limit?

The fun came in after I hit CA.  Redwood forest with the top down
on a vert is cool (remind me to buy a vert one of these days).
What really pissed me off is the fact that sucker wouldn't curl
the speedo (140 mph) with the top down.  And I really tried.

Well, I am about to tackle the front suspension on the 911, I have already
installed new Koni struts and shocks.  Now, I plan to replace the ball
joints, upgrade to the Turbo Tie-rods, and install the steering rack spacer
kit.  Are there any items that I need to look out for while doing this, or
anything to make the job easier.
 
A friend with a 1971 911T, who has been through all this, said that the
tie-rods can be difficult to remove.  He was talking about one of two bolts,
the bolt that goes though the rubber bushing by the rack, or maybe the
threaded part of the tie-rod that is screwed in to the rack.
 
After replacing these parts, I plan to lower the front ride height.  The car
with the original torsion bars, sits with the rear lower than the front (I
measured ~27 1/2" front, ~25 1/4" rear to the top of the fender lip).  I
know that I should replace all the torsion bars and set the ride height of
the front and rear of the car.  But, should it be OK to just adjust the
front and then replace the bars and reset the the ride height later?  And
yes, I read the factory manual about corner balancing and the fact that
changing the ride height will affect the opposite corner.
 
When I do set the ride height, should the instructions in the factory manual
be followed to the letter, or are there other ways to get the same result.
Should the car be loaded how I plan to Autox or Track the car, like 1/2 tank
of gas, spare tire installed or not, and the weight of the driver in the
drivers seat?

(ahem) Quite (cough, cough...) <damn smoke> a respectable body of opinion holds

Subject: Re: Why Dry Sump???

Hi Mike,

In a message dated 95-05-26 03:20:35 EDT, you write:

>What is the advantage of a dry sump lubrication system as implemented
>on the 911??  I know that it is used in racing, but I know of no other

>

A dry sump oil system means that the oil is stored in a tank, not in pan, or
sump at the bottom of the engine. The dry sump oil system sucks the oil up
from a pick up at the bottom of the engine, and pumps it to a tank. The tank
is used to provide oil to the engine.

The benefits of a dry sump oil system is that oil is always available for
lubrication, regardless of what the car is doing. In other words, during high
G turns, there is no chance of oil sloshing to one side of the oil pan and
exposing the oil pump pickup, and leaving the car without any oil for a short
time.

The 944 model has a wet sump oil system, and there have been reports of
engine failures on cars that have has suspension modifications that allowed
higher G turns then the designers intended. This allowed the oil to slosh
away from the oil pickup in the oil pan, resulting in oil starvation, and
"bad things" to the engine. The 944 TurboS, and 89 Turbo solved this problem
by adding special baffles in the pan to prevent the oil from sloshing away.

The BMW M3 model uses a wet sump oil system, and this caused ALL of the M3's
racing in the 24 hours of Daytona to break down, and not complete the race.
The M3 (at least the race engine) has since been modified to use a dry sump
oil system.

I guess a dry sump system is not normally used because it is not required for
street driving, and because it is more complex (additional oil lines, tank,
etc).

I have been looking at a 1970 911T.  As I understand this was a rust bucket
that was completely restored by the seller.  Many new and rebuilt items.
 Looks like new as he has driven it very little since completion of this
project.  When I drove it I notice a lot of rear end sway.  He says it needs
a anti-sway bar.  I thought that would be extreme for everyday casual
driving.  I wonder if there is some problem with the torsion bar in the rear.
 What do I need to look for?  The car is located in a small town making it
difficult to have anyone with Posche expertise to look at it.

I tend to agree with Unka Bart on this one.  Fine driving pleasure was wasted 
this morning on my way into work.  A beautiful red 911 turbo in front of me on a 
long winding 2 lane road.  The driver crusing at about 5 -10- MPH BELOW the

head.  This was nearly unbearable for the 12 miles of no passing that I was

When You Wish Upon A Star - Part VI


A wave of calm passed over me as I accepted the imminence of death.  I
rolled over to gaze the reaper straight in the eyes.  Much to my
surprise, Karl was actually talking to Carlos, and they were walking
over to the car.  As far as I could tell, there had been no deaths up
to this point.  John was giving me a puzzled look. 

"I...errrr...lost my pocketknife.  I thought maybe it was under the
seat," I said.  Knowing how much my pocketknife meant to me, John
accepted this explanation without comment. 

I exited the car and went with John to observe the situation.  While
John didn't seem to recognize Carlos for who he was, it was clear that
he was at least mildly sympathetic to my slightly more intense
suspicion.  Karl had just finished a quick inspection of the outside
of the car, and had opened the trunk.  The three of us moved to the
back of the car, and John opened the deck lid.  We gasped in unison.
There, on top of the engine, was one of the creatures from "Alien."
I'm referring here to the "first stage" Alien that attaches itself to
your face and deposits its offspring in your stomach.  I backed away
slowly, remembering the acid in the blood. 

Karl and John looked confused, their eyes tracing every shiny metallic
tentacle of the creature's body, which had wrapped itself around the
poor boxer engine.  "Is this thing turbocharged?" John asked. 

Carlos lit up like a flame, his smile revealing a really bad dental
plan.  "Tweeen Torbo!  Tweeen Torbo!" he exclaimed. 

"That's an aftermarket job if I've ever seen one," John said.  Karl
nodded.  I ducked down under the car and found an active oil rig, in
full production. 

"You're leaking a little oil," I noted.

"All these cars leak oil," the owner scoffed.

Karl looked skeptical.  "Well, can I drive it?" 

"Sure, sure."  Carlos grinned again, and handed Karl the keys.  The
two got in and Karl started the car.  I think an F-16 passed overhead
at that moment, because I wasn't able to really make out the sound of
a car starting.  They backed out of the parking spot, and blasted
away. 

I looked at John, and he shook his head.  "Is this the most suspicious
situation you've ever been in?" he asked. 

"What if he doesn't come back?" I responded.

"What I find strange is that he is listing the car as a 79 SC, and
that he made no mention of the turbo until we noticed it.  You know,
the factory only uses a four-speed transmission on the turbos, they
find the horsepower eats up the 915." 

"What I find strange is that he looks like..."  I stopped talking as
two of Carlos' buddies emerged from the building.  We smiled and
nodded a greeting, as they approached. 

"You are testing driving car?" one asked.

"Well, our friend is, yes.  We are waiting for them."  They seemed
docile enough, so I thought I'd try to do some digging.  Perhaps I
could gather some information that would be useful for InterPol.  "How
come he's selling the car?" 

"He is leaving for Iraq this week, and he can't take it with him," he
responded. 

Now, don't panic here.  At this time, Iraq was a little known country
somewhere in the middle east.  It did fit in with our terrorist
picture, and John and I managed to exchange nervous glances.  The two
went back inside, and only moments later the car returned.  Karl was,
to our relief, still alive and at the helm.   

When he emerged, however, we realized that something was very wrong.
His eyes were completely glazed over, and he had a Joker-like grin on
his face.  I had always believed brainwashing took a few more
minutes. 

Karl suddenly exploded.  "That was incRRRREDible!  It had so much
POWER!!!!!!  I've never driven anything like it!  I just put my foot
to the floor and I have to shift before it gets there!  We took off
from a red light and we were over a hundred before I could realize
it!" 

Brainwashing, hell.  I was to learn later on in the course of my
relationship with Karl that his most intense emotions involved
horsepower.  People came and went in his life, but cars...for Karl
cars were more than a mere obsession, more than a religion.  True,
every morning and evening at eleven minutes after nine he would kneel
down and face Stuttgart, but it didn't end there.  

"Karl, Karl, calm down," I said.

"It was fanTAStic!"  he was gushing.

"OK. OK.  Karl, get a hold of yourself," said John.  "You can't buy
this car.  It's about to fall apart.  That engine was never meant to
take this kind of horsepower." 

Karl deflated a bit.  "Ja.  You think so?"

"Karl," I said.  "We have to drive the cars we get across the entire
country.  Do you honestly think that one will make it?" 

"But it is so FAST!"

Carlos approached.  Somehow he maneuvered himself between Karl and us.
"What do you think?" he asked. 

"How much are you asking?" Karl said, shakily.

The assassin turned used car salesman shrugged.  "Make me an offer."
(You know, to put it in racing terms, the "turn" from assassin to used
car salesman can be taken at full throttle). 

Karl paused a moment, he eyed me over Carlos' shoulder.  "Twelve
thousand?"  The car had been listed for fourteen. 

Without hesitation, and in a voice so sinister a chill went up my
spine, he responded, "Are you paying cash?"  The last word hung in the
air like the mist of your breath on a cold northeastern morning. 

Like an idiot, like a total moron, like a brainless zombie that had
just emerged from the crypt, Karl said, "Of course." 

"It's a deal."

I looked in horror at John.  "NO NO NO!" we screamed soundlessly at
Karl from behind Carlos' back.  Karl was smiling, and in a deep
trance.  In his eyes I could see him reliving the acceleration.  His
mouth began forming "OK." All seemed lost.   

Suddenly a ray of light streamed down from overhead onto Karl's face,
and he woke up.  Seeing John and me gesticulating frantically at him
for the first time, he said, "I will have to think about it.  I
... errr ... don't have the money here anyway." 

We reflected on our narrow escape later on while ingesting
carbohydrates, saturated fat, and cholesterol at a fine diner.  I
decided not to mention either the true identity of our previous host
nor the miraculous ray of light that had awakened Karl.  The former
because I figured it would be better for the two of them not to know
in case we were captured and tortured by some rival terrorist group,
and the latter because I was now becoming actively aware that
something or someone was helping us, and I needed to consider it
more. 

Day and night are discrete events in L.A.  It's either one or the
other, there is no "dusk" or "dawn"  (There had once been a dawn in
L.A., but then Tony Orlando had some kind of problems and they all
went their separate ways).  Someone on the Santa Monica pier throws a
switch every night and the sky just shuts off.  I must have been in
the bathroom when the switch was thrown because I never noticed it
happen.   

John was busy further convincing Karl that purchasing this butchered
aftermarket turbo was not a good idea.  I could hear their
conversation, but I was lost in thought, and their voices began to
merge with the background noise of the restaurant.  I gazed out the
window into the night.  Overhead I could see the stars glimmering and
I began to orient myself in order to identify them.  I was momentarily
blinded by headlights as a car pulled into the restaurant parking lot
 - it was a 911.  I surprised myself by recognizing it as an 84 or 85
Carrera.  Smiling, I returned my gaze to the sky, and picked out the
three corners of a triangle formed by the stars Altair, Deneb, and
Vega.  With recognition came recollection, and I could now hear my own
voice echoing back across the span of time, "I wish I had a Porsche."

Attention all you porsche-parts packrats!
I don't suppose anyone has a radio cover plate for the dash of an early

I am hard of hearing so I don't have much use for a radio anyway...so, now
that I have "surgically removed" the cheap jap radio that came with the car, I
would like one of those black plastic covers that say "Porsche" on it.  My
project isn't concours level (but the piece really oughta be clean anyway.) 
Can anyone help? where can I look for one of these things? I live out in the
Mojave Desert (in case any of you refer me to a b-yard...) 
While I'm begging & groveling for parts, I also am looking for a pair of early

Subject: 911 Electrical problems continue...


Hello again,

I was driving my 1981 911SC home from work last night and my alternator
light was glowing ever so slightly (as it has been all week).  When I 
rounded the last coner of my street, 300 yards from my driveway, the
car completely cut out.  The engine stopped, and all the electrical
devices stop.  I pulled over and had to have my buddy pull me into the
driveway with his Jeep.

Nothing works now.  Not the hazards, no lights, no ignition, no nothing.
Turning the key in the ignition does not do anything.  It is as if I
removed the battery from the car.  10 minutes before hand, the car
started normally.

For the past week or so, I had been having eratci electrical problems.
The Tachomter would flutter around, and the seat belt light would come
on.  Many people suggested a bad alternator or ground strap, and since
the alternator (red) light would come on, I suspected such.  

My question I guess is how to start to diagnose this problem.  What would
make the car, while driving down the road just fine, all of a sudden
just stop running?  Does the cable from the battery + terminal run to
the alternator or the starter?  If the alternator failed completely,
would the car stall out like this - maybe if finally shorted out?  
If the voltage regulator failed completely, would this also cause the
symtoms?   It is startnge since none of any of the electrical things
work in the car now.

If it was just the alternator, would this also make the hazards lights
or the headlights not work.  I will attempt this weekend to trace the
problem down, but since nothing in the car works, and thus I cannot
start the car, I will have trouble checking to see if the alternator 
puts out juice.  My battery is brand new by the way, and I check the
negative cable and it is fine.  I also checked the fuse box and there
are no blown fuses.  I have yet to see if the battery positive cable 
came unattached somehow from wherever it leads to.  I thought the battery
cable runs to the starter motr first?  Maybe this is corodded?
Any suggestions???

Thanks in advance.

Last year, I installed a new setup in my '83 944.  I was more or less forced 
to buy a new stereo system because the old stereo (which had crappy sound to 
begin with) gave up the ghost.  Since the car was over a decade old, I was 
neither surprised nor particularly disappointed.

I left the speakers alone, since they were fine (though I'm sure modern 
replacements would be noticeably better).  I replaced the head unit with a 
Sony XRU-660, which is an AM/FM cassette deck with controls for multiple CD 
changers, a television, and a VCR.  Of course, there's no room in my car for 
a television and VCR, nor do I have the need.  As for the CD changers, I 
only have one, which is installed at the rear of the car in the spare tire 
compartment.  It would be kind of neat to daisy-chain a bunch of changer 
units and have my entire CD collection on-line at once, but I figured a 
single 10-disc changer would be sufficient.  8-)  I think the model number 
is the CDX-303, though I could be mistaken.  It was over a year ago that I 
bought all this stuff.

The neat thing about the system that I really like is that I can assign 
names to CDs.  The system has enough memory to memorize about a 100 CDs, 
associating the name with the unique digital identifier on each disc.  When 
you put a new magazine of CDs into the changer and then leave it alone for a 
few moments, it will actually load each disc sequentially to read the 
identifiers so that later you can just scroll through the list of loaded CDs 
by name without having to wait for the delay of loading and unloading each 
disc.

The system also has the ability to name radio stations, which I find 
invaluable since I can never remember which stations are on which 
frequencies.

The sound quality is so vastly improved over what was there before (even 
when it was working) that I wish I hadn't waited until the old system had 
given up the ghost before replacing it.  One of the big improvements is the 
increase in power from 0.7 Watts to about 4 Watts.  It used to be that even 
at low listening levels, the system would break up with low drumbeats due to 
insufficient power.  Having seen the major improvement in sound quality 
attributable to more power, I would go with an external amplifier the next 
time around and get real power -- like at least 20 Watts.

I haven't looked much at the electrical system in a 911, as mine hasn't
given any problems, but I've done way too much electrical work on other
cars...  The big cable from the battery will go just to the starter, so
it isn't really a suspect (unless it shorted to the chassis somewhere,
which you would probably know because it would have welded itself there
and probably created a pretty strong odor as everything in the vicinity
burned).  There will be a smaller wire going to the fusebox, probably
with a fusible link in it.  That link is the most likely problem when
everything electrical fails (including the starter motor, as the starter
solenoid runs off that too).  The next would be the connections between
it and the battery on one side and the fuse box on the other.  This
would not explain the erratic electrical problems you had before this
though - perhaps whatever the problem was finally failed shorted (thereby
burning out that link).  Assuming the link is blown, definitely
check to see if there's a short before just replacing it...

Linda Grigsby (at Carlsen's Porsche-Audi in Palo Alto, CA) does not
have internet access.  But she thinks it's a great idea and is taking it to
the boss today.

She offers "internet guys" cost+20% on parts.  On big ticket items this
is a substantial discount.  If you're "just" a PCA member she offers
10% off list officially, but usually makes it 15%.

She can be reached at 415-856-0611, 8-4:30 PST.  She's a great source
for parts trivia.  BTW, it's her 63 Super90 husband Bob restored recently.
Incredible job and only $22k.  (I need a bigger garage.)  She doesn't
mind losing it.  She's got a 300E for her lazy moments and a nice old
Speedster when she feels frisky.

hi folks,
there's been a thread on 928 heaters, how bout a 928 ac query?

apparently the power is not getting to the compressor &
the shoppe says it's a wiring harness problem & says 
the cost could get nebulous while they trace the harness. 
he has the dealer diagnostic chart mentioned in a recent 
pfile digest & is porsche certified.   in fact, the mechanic 
just came back from a factory tour/etc this month.

my hope is to solicit any advice/suggestions to save $$
on resolving this ac problem.

the other problem is passing inspection.  apparently the
hydrocarbons need to be 450 but he said they were 1700.
he talked me into cleaning the injectors, (they tuned it
themselves only 6 weeks ago) & now the levels are 500 so
it still won't pass.   i saw a commercial last nite for
an additive '104 emission control' but that is only
supposed to clean the injectors which has already been
done the hard/expensive way :)   

any ideas/suggestions on how to remedy this problem? 
thanx!

Despite the fact that Carlsen offers some of the best prices around, I 
have to question how genuine this 'internet' deal really is. On more than 
one occasion I was told that the quoted price WAS the internet discount 
AFTER I asked what additional discount I could get as an 'internet guy'. 
How could she know to quote me the internet price if I hadn't identified 
myself as such? Either this deal isn't as exclusive as we're led to 
believe or there is really no discount on top of what the regular 
mail-order guy gets.

Subject: 993 Turbo Rims


Browsing through the latest auto magazines, containing the new 911 Turbo, I
noticed the hollow rims Porsche is using on it. I like the twisted spoke
design of the wheel. Anyway, Porsche being a company of function over form,
I remember reading something about the old Turbo indicating that the design
of the wheel aided brake cooling. True/False who am I to say.

This being the case, I would assume the same considerations were given to the
new wheels. Now, the driver's side rims have a sort of swept back look to them.
The passenger's side rims (using the exact same rims) have a swept forward look
much like a boomerang. Question: Would there be any braking/performance 
consequences, resulting from this "opposition", as great as the aesthetic ones?

It just seems a little strange, that's all. Personally, I like the look of the
passenger's side. Maybe there were cost considerations that limited the 
production of separate left and right side rims. (shrug)

   Date: Thu, 25 May 1995 09:04:42 -0500
   From: Pete Klager <pete.klager@medtronic.com>

Wow!  Thanks for the great detailed info!

   I looked at my '75 1.8L last night.  Looking in towards the flap from the air cleaner
   end, I see a short (1/2 inch or so), slightly tapered, tan colored cone about the
   same diameter as a pencil.  I can't tell what might be inside it.  Does it look as
   if the metal parts you see would fit into something this size?  My guess is that the
   spring is a temperature sensitive wire resistor.

Ok, this makes sense.  I guess the whole plastic "housing" must have
broken off from mine (uh oh, I wonder where it went :-(  ).  Yup, it's
officially called Temp Sensor I, although there's really no point in
giving it a separate name since you can't test it by itself!

   The sensor is connected to pins 6 and 27 on the airflow sensor.  I took some
   rough measurements for you:
       At about 40 degrees I measured 4500 ohms
       At about 70 degrees I measured  2300 ohms
       At about 100 degrees I measured 1300 ohms

Wow!  Thanks for doing all this testing!  How did you do the different
temperature measurements?  (with a heat gun?  putting the air box in
the fridge??)

However it seems we have slightly different air boxes ('74 versus
'75?)...  In my air box, the terminals on the connector to the FI
harness are labeled: [ 39 36 6 9 8 7 ]

Only ONE of the 2 leads from the temperature sensor is brought
directly out to a terminal ("9").  The other lead connects to the PC
board (through a contact right *near* the FI harness connector),
connecting the temperature sensor to a series resistor (one of those
resistors applied right to the surface of the PC board).  The other
side of the resistor is brought out to terminal 8 of the FI connector.

In fact, here's the rough block diagram of my air box:

     36
     o        
     |     +--/\/\/\/--+--/\/\/\--[***]--+    
    \      |     ^     |                 |          
     |     |     |     |                 |            
     o     o     o     o                 o            
     39    6     7     8                 9            
                                                   
Terminal 7 is the wiper of the potentiometer.  Between 8 and 9 are the
temp sensor ([***]) and its series resistor.  Between 36 and 39 is the
switch that closes when the air flap first moves.

So does your air box have a series resistor for the temp sensor also?
Or were those 1300 to 4500 ohm values really *direct* readings from
the sensor itself?

   Perhaps you can put a 5000 or 10000 ohm potentiometer in the circuit and adjust
   it to see if you can get the engine to run better.

This is a great suggestion.  Even if our air boxes are different (and
I can't use your values exactly) it's worth experimenting a bit while
the car's running.  I'll try to check it out this weekend.

Linda Grigsby (at Carlsen's Porsche-Audi in Palo Alto, CA) does not
have internet access.  But she thinks it's a great idea and is taking it to
the boss today.

She offers "internet guys" cost+20% on parts.  On big ticket items this
is a substantial discount.  If you're "just" a PCA member she offers
10% off list officially, but usually makes it 15%.

She can be reached at 415-856-0611, 8-4:30 PST.  She's a great source
for parts trivia.  BTW, it's her 63 Super90 husband Bob restored recently.
Incredible job and only $22k.  (I need a bigger garage.)  She doesn't
mind losing it.  She's got a 300E for her lazy moments and a nice old
Speedster when she feels frisky.

hi folks,
there's been a thread on 928 heaters, how bout a 928 ac query?

apparently the power is not getting to the compressor &
the shoppe says it's a wiring harness problem & says 
the cost could get nebulous while they trace the harness. 
he has the dealer diagnostic chart mentioned in a recent 
pfile digest & is porsche certified.   in fact, the mechanic 
just came back from a factory tour/etc this month.

my hope is to solicit any advice/suggestions to save $$
on resolving this ac problem.

the other problem is passing inspection.  apparently the
hydrocarbons need to be 450 but he said they were 1700.
he talked me into cleaning the injectors, (they tuned it
themselves only 6 weeks ago) & now the levels are 500 so
it still won't pass.   i saw a commercial last nite for
an additive '104 emission control' but that is only
supposed to clean the injectors which has already been
done the hard/expensive way :)   

any ideas/suggestions on how to remedy this problem? 
thanx!

Despite the fact that Carlsen offers some of the best prices around, I 
have to question how genuine this 'internet' deal really is. On more than 
one occasion I was told that the quoted price WAS the internet discount 
AFTER I asked what additional discount I could get as an 'internet guy'. 
How could she know to quote me the internet price if I hadn't identified 
myself as such? Either this deal isn't as exclusive as we're led to 
believe or there is really no discount on top of what the regular 
mail-order guy gets.

Subject: 993 Turbo Rims


Browsing through the latest auto magazines, containing the new 911 Turbo, I
noticed the hollow rims Porsche is using on it. I like the twisted spoke
design of the wheel. Anyway, Porsche being a company of function over form,
I remember reading something about the old Turbo indicating that the design
of the wheel aided brake cooling. True/False who am I to say.

This being the case, I would assume the same considerations were given to the
new wheels. Now, the driver's side rims have a sort of swept back look to them.
The passenger's side rims (using the exact same rims) have a swept forward look
much like a boomerang. Question: Would there be any braking/performance 
consequences, resulting from this "opposition", as great as the aesthetic ones?

It just seems a little strange, that's all. Personally, I like the look of the
passenger's side. Maybe there were cost considerations that limited the 
production of separate left and right side rims. (shrug)

Neil,
If the difference between a 73 and 87 is "rather large", it is night and day
between a 73 and 95.  Other than the outward appearance and basic interior
layout (among the best features of a 911!) there is almost no similarity. 
Okay, that stretches the truth a little, but if you ever get a chance to
drive a 993 you'll agree immediately.  The 73 is hard drivin'.  It is loud,
steering is heavy (but tight), creature comforts are nil (like fresh air
vents, modern comfortable but supportive seats), shifting builds muscles (as
does braking), gauges can't be read at night, radios are almost useless, AC
is either missing or ineffective, engines run very warm, tires/wheels are
prehistoric and contribute to quirky handling, you feel every flaw in the
pavement, it is not especially fast by modern stds, etc..  Everything is
exactly the opposite on a 993.  You can whisper to a passanger and be heard,
road sounds are muffled, the 10-speaker stereo rivals the best sounds of any
factory unit, the steering is precise *and* easy, brakes are outrageously
good (even better than the 930), it's hard to lose control (even if you are a
bit careless), acceleration is neck snapping (God...I wonder what the 96
turbo is like!), the seats are great (they've even been lengthened for more
thigh support), and it's perfect in all kinds of weather (no more defrost
woes, foggy or dark gauges, inadequate wipers, marginal headlights, etc.). 
Basically Porsche did its homework to build at a car that is every bit a 911
in its configuration and performance, but a wonderfully comfortable luxury
car as well.  I've cruised quite comfortably at 135mph.  Scary how easy it is
to do.  And its track capabilities are pretty clear.

Still, everything everyone says about the pre-74 911's is true.  They *do*
feel more nimble.  When I drive the 73 I feel like I'm driving a race car
(duh).  I get absorbed by it.  My mind doesn't wonder.  I'm thinking about
the next turn, or the next gear, or the next set of tires I'll mount.  I
don't mind the hard ride; I *like* it.  This really is the 911 experience. 
In the 993 I feel like I'm driving the best damned sports car the world ever
produced.  Sure compromises were made.  But I can't find a single one to
argue about. There's so much torque across the band that it's easy to get
lazy about gear selection.  And I spend more time thinking about issues other
than the car. 8^(

My wife, who's owned her own Carreras, doesn't especially like the 73.  She
finds the 993 just too good to turn away from.  She likes that I like it,
probably because it gives her more time in the 993.  But she'll drive our 3rd
car before she'll reach for the 73 keys.

As far as those lid shocks are concerned, I swapped the rear for a somewhat
more used one and the problem is not as bad.  Do you have AC in your 73S?  I
don't, so there's not even a condensor to add to the lid weight.  Stand
back...lid's about to blow!  I'm learning to live with it.  I've adjusted the
rubber stops so at least the lid sits straight now.

I had an 88 turbo look but it was a targa.  The new owner lives in Capitola
(near Santa Cruz) and commutes north to Freemont (east bay) every day.  I've
talked with him.  First 911.  He's addicted.  Another convert.

Let's see, you have a CD changer in your car, but recommend that this guy
should not get one because he should instead focus his attention on 
driving?  I guess I'm confused.  I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and
assume that he can operate a CD player and drive his car competently
at the same time.  Heck, I don't care if he wants to put Gumbo Monster
Mudders on his car.  It's his car (if he buys it, that is).  I love to drive,
but even my car has a radio in it (it's a European radio that barely works,
but it is a radio).

I assume you are talking about "H" rated tires?  I've been leaning
towards getting at least a "V" rated tire because I'm under the 
impression that the higher speed ratings have a stiffer sidewall. 
How do the A509s compare to their more expensive AVS Inter-
mediate brethren?  Due to the fact that I can't really afford to
buy an extra set of wheels/tires for the track, I am embroiled
in confusion as to what to get to serve both street and track
functions.  A guy at the TireRack told me that the AVSs would be
the best tire to alleviate the "chunking" problems I have been
having at the track, but I am hesitant to spend $450 only to trash
my rear tires at the first track event I go to.

Pete Albrecht's analogy between tires and religions keeps coming
to mind, but I would appreciate any comments regarding tires
that might serve my dual street/track purpose.  Bear in mind, too,
that I am constrained to nothing larger than a 205/60-15 in the
rear.

I would adjust the front first and recheck the rears a few days after
you adjust the fronts.  When I raised the rear of my '76, I noticed that
my previously high front end came down a little (and right into spec
for a Euro model - 108mm) so I left it alone.

Subject: Carseats for 911 - Search and Report


Well, I tried the Century Braverra booster seat tonite in the back of the 
911.  The base is about .5 to .75" too wide to fit all the way back 
flush against the back of the seat.  Also, because the rear seat belts 
are set forward, i.e. they do not come from behind you like most cars, 
there is no way to keep the seat from lurching forward and backward the 
distance the seat belt is set forward from the back of the seat.  (The 
seat belt slips through two slots on the back of the car seat).  This 
seat belt configuratiopn problem also eliminated the car seat that is 
just a back with should harnesses and a sub-belt attached because the 
seat belt anchoring position was in the back of the seat.  I can't 
believe no one has designed a carseat to fit the rear seats of the 911 
(and, I think the 944 - aren't they the same dimensions?)  Perhaps I will 
put my artistic hand to work and come up with a design upon which my 
early retirement will be built! :-)

Until then, I remain in search of the rear 911 carseat.

steering rack has a lot of grease all over the outside.  I know some of it
is steering grease, but some of it could be the "Texaco" type undercoating a
previous owner sprayed all over the underside.  Also it seems that the Turbo
rods are longer than the original.  I thought that I could install the new

Dear Karl,

I recently replaced a spray bar.  It was pretty simple.  I drilled and 
tapped the plug in the cam tower and pulled the plug with the appropriate 
sized bolt. I slid the bent tube out and replaced it.  In this case I 
would spray or pour car cleaner through the spray bar first.  Then pull 
the plug and use a wire to probe it.   You could carefully remove it and 
then clean it with a rifle bore cleaning brush.  The plugs and spray bar 
have part numbers.

Hello Hubert,

I posted a medium sized treaste on the "Walker" Floor Jack.  There are 
several advantages to this jack that you wont find with other floor 
jacks.  Among them:

1.  They have resale value because they can be rebuilt.
2.  Parts can be bought from dealers and jack rebuilders.
3.  They are pricey however there are a lot of used ones out there.
4.  They are sold used in the newspaper classifieds, pawn shops, auctions etc
5.  No other imported jacks nor very few american made jacks are as 
    universialy used by most professional mechanics or garages.
6.  This jack uses an external pump.  When it is worn out you simply buy 
    another pump and screw it into the base of the casting.  The rest of 
    the jacks I am familiar with have the pump as an intregal portion of 
    the casting.  When the casting is worn out the jack is virtually 
    nothing but a large wheel chock.

Good luck with all of your projects.

If it's the valve at the back of the engine which controls coolant flow

If on the other hand you're talking about whatever controls the air mixer

Are you trying to say that this fellow should re-consider putting a CD

Let's see, you have a CD changer in your car, but recommend that this guy
should not get one because he should instead focus his attention on 
driving?  I guess I'm confused.  I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and
assume that he can operate a CD player and drive his car competently
at the same time.  Heck, I don't care if he wants to put Gumbo Monster
Mudders on his car.  It's his car (if he buys it, that is).  I love to drive,
but even my car has a radio in it (it's a European radio that barely works,
but it is a radio).

I assume you are talking about "H" rated tires?  I've been leaning
towards getting at least a "V" rated tire because I'm under the 
impression that the higher speed ratings have a stiffer sidewall. 
How do the A509s compare to their more expensive AVS Inter-
mediate brethren?  Due to the fact that I can't really afford to
buy an extra set of wheels/tires for the track, I am embroiled
in confusion as to what to get to serve both street and track
functions.  A guy at the TireRack told me that the AVSs would be
the best tire to alleviate the "chunking" problems I have been
having at the track, but I am hesitant to spend $450 only to trash
my rear tires at the first track event I go to.

Pete Albrecht's analogy between tires and religions keeps coming
to mind, but I would appreciate any comments regarding tires
that might serve my dual street/track purpose.  Bear in mind, too,
that I am constrained to nothing larger than a 205/60-15 in the
rear.

I would adjust the front first and recheck the rears a few days after
you adjust the fronts.  When I raised the rear of my '76, I noticed that
my previously high front end came down a little (and right into spec

Subject: Carseats for 911 - Search and Report


Well, I tried the Century Braverra booster seat tonite in the back of the 
911.  The base is about .5 to .75" too wide to fit all the way back 
flush against the back of the seat.  Also, because the rear seat belts 
are set forward, i.e. they do not come from behind you like most cars, 
there is no way to keep the seat from lurching forward and backward the 
distance the seat belt is set forward from the back of the seat.  (The 
seat belt slips through two slots on the back of the car seat).  This 
seat belt configuratiopn problem also eliminated the car seat that is 
just a back with should harnesses and a sub-belt attached because the 
seat belt anchoring position was in the back of the seat.  I can't 
believe no one has designed a carseat to fit the rear seats of the 911 
(and, I think the 944 - aren't they the same dimensions?)  Perhaps I will 
put my artistic hand to work and come up with a design upon which my 
early retirement will be built! :-)

Until then, I remain in search of the rear 911 carseat.

Dear Karl,

I recently replaced a spray bar.  It was pretty simple.  I drilled and 
tapped the plug in the cam tower and pulled the plug with the appropriate 
sized bolt. I slid the bent tube out and replaced it.  In this case I 
would spray or pour car cleaner through the spray bar first.  Then pull 
the plug and use a wire to probe it.   You could carefully remove it and 
then clean it with a rifle bore cleaning brush.  The plugs and spray bar 
have part numbers.

Hello Hubert,

I posted a medium sized treaste on the "Walker" Floor Jack.  There are 
several advantages to this jack that you wont find with other floor 
jacks.  Among them:

1.  They have resale value because they can be rebuilt.
2.  Parts can be bought from dealers and jack rebuilders.
3.  They are pricey however there are a lot of used ones out there.
4.  They are sold used in the newspaper classifieds, pawn shops, auctions etc
5.  No other imported jacks nor very few american made jacks are as 
    universialy used by most professional mechanics or garages.
6.  This jack uses an external pump.  When it is worn out you simply buy 
    another pump and screw it into the base of the casting.  The rest of 
    the jacks I am familiar with have the pump as an intregal portion of 
    the casting.  When the casting is worn out the jack is virtually 
    nothing but a large wheel chock.

Good luck with all of your projects.

If it's the valve at the back of the engine which controls coolant flow

If on the other hand you're talking about whatever controls the air mixer

Barry,

Two other reasons for dry sump spring to mind.  The first is that, in
any race car, you want to get the engine and everything else as low as
possible.  Eliminate a wet sump, and you pick up a couple of inches.

The second reason is that a dry sump keeps the crank from ever sitting
in oil.  If it sits in oil, that costs you a bit of horsepower.

Subject: re: Re: Best Hydraulic Jack

Hey Scott,

Thank you for the endorsement of purchasing that jack from my advice.

Here's some more advice thats universally applicable to floor jacks. 
1.  Depress them when rolling the jack across unpaved or graveled areas.
When you do this the outer seal/wiper cleans off the jack ram which is on 
the bottom of the jack.
2.  Turn the jack on its side after raising the pad to its fullest 
extension.  Then inspect the ram and the seal.  Inspect the seal/wiper 
for gravel that would scar the ram and lead to early seal failure.  Early 
jacks used a felt wiper here.  If equipped clean and re-oil it.
3.  Use real hydraulic jack oil.  I have found brake fluid in jacks!
4.  Since you have the luxury of replaceable wheels and casters with real 
bearings, grease them.

I love my 1950's model.  It's only 40 years old and it works every day.  
Its smooth as silk as you say.  I would like to add that I think that the 
one you bought has the widest lifting range of any floor jacks and is 
definately the strongest for its size.  I forgot that it was rerated to 
two tons.

Good luck with your projects.

> that utilizes this system...

Kevin and others pretty well hit the "why use dry sump", but I'll recap
before moving to Part Two...

1) insure that you never, ever try to pump air to the main bearings instead
   of oil

2) reduce pumping losses due to sloshing the crank through the oil (BTW, in
   certain 'merikun engines over the years, this was seen as a *FEATURE*
   as the splashing helped lower-end lubrication)

3) added oil cooling as the oil is only really *IN* the engine while it's
   "doing something", and is sitting in a nice (relatively) cool tank or
   the to/from lines the rest of the time.

Now, why *NOT* do it in regular production cars:

First off, there *ARE* cars that have dry sump systems. Most of them are
the other exotics, like Ferraris and such. I can't think of any  mass-market
car that has a dry sump off the top of my head though... 

Second, the 911 is *NOT* a mass-production car. Note that there are what?
about 200,000 911s made, *EVER*??? Shit, GM does that in *ONE DAY* if you 
look at world-wide production. Think about it.

Now that we have that part of the equation straight: to add a dry sump system
for racing purposes is hellishly expensive. You have to change the internal
oil pump and some of the oil galley routing, the pan, and then you add an
external pump, lots of oil line, and a tank. When I dry-sumped a Toyota
4A engine (C Sports Racer application), it cost about $2800 using parts
from TRD. If you look at the cost for a dry sump for a Pinto engine for use
in a Formula Ford, you'll see similar numbers. If you look at a dry sump
for a Winston Cup type application, it's a LOT higher.

Let's assume we can apply normal "more is cheaper" economics, and can get
the *PARTS COST* down to kilobuck, and the per-car labor charge at initial
assembly down to only $500 per car in extra labor. That would push the
retail consumer price up by close to $6k. And move your oil change costs
from $20 at Jiffy Lube to close to $100 at a slightly more sophisictated
place. *THAT'S* why no one uses this stuff for mass production cars.

I said that I would go to Toys-R-Us and see if the Century Breverra booster
seat would fit into my 1972 911.  Well it DOES NOT.  The rear seat belts
that I purchased from Performance Engineered Products has the push-button
buckle on too short of a length of webbing.  I have never measured the belts
from a later model 911 so I do not know if it is any different.  But anyway,
the buckle part of the belt binds against the slot in the back of the child
seat, and the child seat will not sit flush against the back of the seat.
If the belt buckle was on a longer length of webbing then it may work.  I
believe Vic may have a later model 911 than I do, so his seat works.
 
As for the model of the seats, I was wrong.  I said that the store had only
one left of the style of seat with the built in harness.  When I got to the
store that night they had refilled the shelves.  So it seems there are two
models available, one with the harness that has slots in the back to thread
the cars belt through.  And one without a harness that uses the cars 3-point
belt to hold the seat and child to the car (which can only be used with
3-point belts).
 
I plan to keep looking around town and see what I can find.  My daughter is
3 1/2 years old and the child seat that I use in the 911 is becoming too
small for her.  Hopefully I can find something to use.

Lotus Elan has not been sold to Kia           Date: 19 May 1995
Contact: Patrick G. Peal                      Embargo: Immediate

Only 200 of the limited-production Lotus Elan S2 remain to be
completed at the Hethel plant of Lotus Cars Ltd. - and Lotus dealers
world-wide, reacting to customer demand, have placed orders for
every one.

At the recent Seoul Motor Show, Kia presented their new high-
technology L96 sports car which is the first fruit of the technology
transfer agreement signed between Lotus and Kia last March.  Lotus
is supplying expertise, as well as some components and tooling for
prototypes and initial production.

While there are broad similarities in the external appearance of the
Kia L96 show car and the Lotus Elan S2, there will be no mistaking
the production L96 for the Lotus Elan in appearance, character,
performance, or image.

Well over 80% (by value) of the parts of the L96 will be either unique
or respecified for local sourcing.  Kia will supply the 130 bhp
normally aspirated engine, transmission, brakes, suspension, as well
as interior and exterior hard and soft trim items.

The L96 will go into production for the 1997 model year, specified and
homologated for the Korean home market only.  Senior management at Kia
confirm that they have no export plans at present, nor has a price for
the L96 been set, pending completion of the engineering development
programme.

Subject: re: 911 engine control units

Someone asked about the blue (sometimes black) switch on the back of a 
European 911 control unit.  This is an eight position switch which gives 
the control unit some small range of adjustment to timing and fuel.  
Typically on 911's the fully counterclockwise position is the standard 
baseline position. The next click clockwise adds a small amount to the 
pulsewidth, maybe a few percent.  I don't remember which is which on the 
next two; one takes out a little fuel, one adds more fuel. 

Position five (four "clicks" from fully counterclockwise, return fuel to 
the baseline, but takes out about 2 degrees of ignition timing. It varied 
from chip to chip, but was usually only kicked in over 1500. the final 
three positions duplicated the fuel changes of the first, but included 
the retarded timing.

The box the person asked about was a 911.618.111.09.  I don't remember 
this being the correct number for an '84 Euro 911; these came with .00 
DME units.

Another item to look for is the "country code" jumper in the wiring 
harness going to the DME.  Each chip had several sets of maps, and these 
jumpers told the DME which set to look at.  There are three choices: 
open, no jumper, a shorted jumper, or one with a resistor. 

Hope this is of some help.

Hi, Marc,

Sounds like the pressure plate, or release arm, or slave cylinder.

Probably the quickest way to check would be to remove the starter to take a
look at the flywheel/pressure plate area. See if you get any motion while
someone else is depressing the clutch pedal.

New parts for a clutch job are roughly $450 (disk, pp, to bearing) and the
labor is about 8-10 hours for a rookie, 5-8 hours for a pro.  It is
definitely a job you can do yourself, without too many special tools.

Good luck,

Replacing those rear pads is a piece of cake.

The method of removal and replacement should become obvious when you remove

Some aftermarket belts have a noticeable tendency to whine or whistle.

If that bothers you (it's not going to hurt the motor), get thee to the
dealer and buy the Porsche original belts...

Subject: EDITORS: PMNA Statement on 944 Aluminum Control Arms

The following is a statement released by Porsche Motorsports North America
concerning the 944 Aluminum Control Arms:

To all Porsche 944 & 968 Competitors
Re: 944 & 958 Control Arm Usage In Racing Applications

The following A arms should be installed in 944 and 968 Series
vehicles according to the conditions noted:


944 341 027 02 L/S Production version arm
           (round groove 360  degrees on ball joint)
944 341 028 02 R/S Production version arm
These parts are good for moderate competition. (Time trials etc.)

951 341 027 32 L/S Competition version arm
                  (slotted groove on side of ball joint)
951 341 028 32 R/S Competition version arm
These parts are recommended for long distance races or heavy competition.


Neither set of arms noted above pose a problem, as long as 1)
the ride height is not lowered beyond the point which causes
binding of the ball joint when the suspension reaches full
travel, 2) the front sway bar is not greater than the M030
package sway bar in either 0.D. or wall thickness, 3) the lower
bore in the strut is not worn out and 4) the parts are
assembled following the steps outlined in the Porsche Service
Manual. (Despite the fact that this may be slightly contrary to
the Service Manual, it is imperative that the bolt and nut
(original Porsche Parts) be replaced each time they are
removed.

As always in racing, it is important to inspect the arms for
nicks or cuts from road debris after each event to avoid
development of any cracks. Please note that the leading cause
of failure we have seen on both the Production and Competition
version arms, in racing applications, is the failure to follow
the instructions I have listed above. Please call PMNA with any
racing preparation issues.

Hmm. Well, the clutch slave cylinder could by dying (easy to replace,
relatively cheap, thus, check it first). The pedal would (normally) lose all
its "feel" that way.

Replacing the clutch components, etc. is a major pain-in-the-ass job in a
944 (compared to "normal" RWD (or rear-engined) cars), though I've done it
in my driveway. Figure on a much higher-than-usual number of hours if you
get a mechanic to do it (which is why I ended up doing it in my driveway).

One thing to do: check the pilot bearing and make sure it is properly
lubricated. I just had what seemed to be a pressure plate failure in my
"other" car, which turned out to be a siezed pilot bearing. *Very* annoying.

I think this is what is referred to as "Temperature Sensor I" in the Bosch L-Jetronic
and Haynes manuals.

I looked at my '75 1.8L last night.  Looking in towards the flap from the air cleaner
end, I see a short (1/2 inch or so), slightly tapered, tan colored cone about the
same diameter as a pencil.  I can't tell what might be inside it.  Does it look as
if the metal parts you see would fit into something this size?  My guess is that the
spring is a temperature sensitive wire resistor.

The sensor is connected to pins 6 and 27 on the airflow sensor.  I took some
rough measurements for you:
    At about 40 degrees I measured 4500 ohms
    At about 70 degrees I measured  2300 ohms
    At about 100 degrees I measured 1300 ohms

Perhaps you can put a 5000 or 10000 ohm potentiometer in the circuit and adjust
it to see if you can get the engine to run better.

Hope this helps,

I have heard that the wheels are hollow spoked, the spokes are made
separately from the rims, and they are joined using a counter-rotating
friction process. Whether this is new and patentable is beyond my
expertise, but I also do not like the angled design being different on both
sides of the car. I prefer the slanted-backwards look of the driver's side,
and wish Porsche had made 4 different wheels. (or 8, so one could choose
forwards or backwards!)

Hi,

I am in the market for a used or rebuild 944 transaxle. The price quotes
varies from $600 ( with 80K miles) to $1500 (with 32k miles). I
am interested in finding a method to determine, that the trans I 
receive is the one that I paid for i.e. whether the transmission is
from 944, S, S2 or a 951. 

Second thing is the amount of miles the unit have. Do I just take
their word on this or is there any thing I can do to confirm
it.

Oh Yeah! If rebuilding a transaxle is as hard as they tell me, then
why should I buy a rebuild unit.

Thanks,

Thanks to all the folks that responded to my transaxle dilemma. I 
will be looking for a used/rebuild unit. So far I have come
across a few good trans ranging from a 944, /S, /S2, 951 and 968. 
So I need opinions from the above choices of transaxle:

  1. Which one should I go with? I like the current transaxle but would
     like to have a little more punch at the end the second gear most of
     way in the third gear?

  2. When do I need a higher or a lower gear ratio?

  3. What additional modification are needed for installation into
     my 85/2 944. i.e. 

         Trans Cooler installation for 951 Transaxle.

         Some Modification for 944/S, don't know which one.
 
         968: this I really like but have no clue what is
              involved here?

  4. Why is it better to buy a rebuild unit instead of having the 
     existing one rebuild?

  5. Any Experience or opinion about the Quaife differential?

  6. Would this modification elevate me to the next class at the track.

If you are really seeing a threaded hole, then you have lost the threaded cap
that is supposed to fit in there.  Behind the cap is supposed to be a piston
clearance adjuster.  Looking in throught the hole in the trailing arm you should
see the cap.  If the cap is gone, you should see the end of a threaded shaft into
which an allen wrench should fit.  If you lost the cap, then you may have lost the
adjuster as well, since I think that the cap is the only thing that holds it in place.
For a comparison, see what the right side looks like.

If you're talking about the kit on page 25 of AA's latest catalog (6 cars in the
gravel pit on the cover), then these calipers are for the front.  It's the front brakes
that do most of the work would benefit the most from an upgrade.

If you have in fact lost the cap and adjusting mechanism, you might see if you can
find a used one somewhere (AA or some other parts house).

Hello again,

I purchased an '87 944 S last week and noticed the car idles pretty rough,
the rpm fluctuates between 800 and 900 and the car vibrates.  The noise
and vibration goes away when I press on gas pedal.  While reading through
the 944 faq, I notice the problem could be either Idle Stabilizer or
Motor Mounts or both...  The car just had a major tune-up/service a few
months back, it accelerates and drives smoothly.  I want like to have the
idle problem checked out but I'm not mechanically competent.  So I would 
like to hear recommendations on Porsche mechanics in northern New Jersey 
area.  I live in Jersey City, NJ.

One of the lockable wheel nuts is missing.  I probably need to buy a new
set of 4 nuts with lock sleeves, don't think I can just get one.  Any idea
how much this will cost me?

Also, the lock for alarm system behind door lock is stuck.  It seems that
I can not turn it without bending or damaging the key.  Do I need to take

The best method (short of tearing the thing apart) is to check the
transmission code (stamped on the top front of the transmission) and date
code. The service manuals and the specification books translate the codes
for you.

You have to take their word for it.  It helps if you deal with a reputable

I had this problem with my 911 some years ago. I had to resort to a rather
uncoventional product to reduce the stickiness. Dow Bathroom Cleaner. Uh Huh,
it cuts greasy films like you wuldn't believe. The stickiness could be from
built up "stuff" from your hands. Over time this builds up and depending on
the weather conditions in your area, becomes a sticky yucky film on your
steering wheel.

But before you have to resort to this, try a leather hide cleaner or food. I
have used this on my Jaguar (sorry, but yes I have one of "those") with
fantastic results. Your results will probably depend on the product but give
that a try. 

What ever you try -the Dow bathroom cleaner, soap & water, or any other
grease cutting product - MAKE SURE YOU TREAT THE LEATHER. I cannot stress
this enough. The leather is a natural product that needs to have upkeep. The
position of the steering wheel is such that it bakes in the sun more than you
do and will dry out. 

Good luck, try the Dow if the other sugesstions do not work. It worked on
mine and now I treat it with leather conditioner frequently.

It seems that as a new owner I have a lot more questions than answers, but
perhaps that will change over time.  Anyway, here's a question for you 911
experts :-)

About 7 months ago bought an 86 Carrera w/ 117,000 Miles.  Had it checked
out on purchase and all appeared to be OK (according to the owner of The
Stable in SF.  Yesterday I stopped to chat w/the neighbor, and while
sitting therer at idle noticed a *modest* amount of bluish smoke rolling
out of the tailpipe.  Hadn't noticed this before, but I wasn't looking for
it either.  It does not *smoke* when driving.

It does use some oil (I check it when I fuel up), but not an excessive
amount, although I not exactly sure what that would be.  A friend suggested
that this was possibly a fuel mixture thing the EFI system controlled.

1)  Should I be concerned about this?

2)  If so how, how concerned?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

A 944 transaxle is a bear to take apart and repair.  You MUST have a
hydraulic press to do it, and you need the factory manuals to tell you how.
 This constrasts with 901/914 gear boxes where you can literally rebuild them
with special tools such as an old clutch disk, a bent nail, and a rubber
mallet. I know, I've rebuilt both successfully.

Since the 944 transaxle is a modified Audi unit, you might be able to find a
mechanic familiar with them who could help you.

Personally, I'd just ignore these people.  We all know that they're
suffering Porsche envy, and that their remarks are merely an attempt to
assuage their self-inflicted feelings of inadequacy.

I have a friend who has a '95 Mustang GT.  He's always pointing out the
virtues of his 'stang over my 911.  But in the end, he's the one who wants
to trade cars for a day!

The 911 need no defense.  It stands alone.  As the ad men used to say...

Generally speaking, at every driver's school that I have participated

BTW, there are some *BRAND NEW* Porsche *FACTORY REBUILT* transaxles
available for 944's. Contact Jon Diederle at Johnston Motorsport
(610) 436-8575. Seems that when Porsche had to go thru certication
and testing for various government compliances, that they could
not sell the cars as new (since motors and transaxles were used). The
cars then got new motors and transaxles. The removed transaxles were
rebuilt by Porsche. Apparently some wholesaler bought up all of these
transaxles (were about 40 of them they were saying). Cost is
slightly more than a rebuild but would be the way to go. Certainly
worth paying a little bit more for, IMHO.

Subject: 951 Stuck On Hot

I've read several posts on this with interest because recently my 951 began
to sometimes pump out hot air at start-up in warm temperatures even though
climate control was set to have it on air conditioning. Other times it
would behave correctly.

I had my genius son, the mechanic, look at it today. He found the problem
in less than one minute. Of course he knew what he was looking for which
was a tiny broken piece of white plastic and a brass clip laying on the the
driver's-side floor mat which fell from underneath the dash. He says this
is a common problem with 944s. The pieces formerly attached to a now
free-hanging rod which hooked to a motor which inturn would open and close
a hot-cold duct door.

The replacement white plastic piece will cost about 85 cents, and when he
brings it over will take about 5 minutes to install. The brass clip will be
re-used.

It sure pays to have kids.

Subject: re: 911 engine control units (fwd)



Someone asked about the blue (sometimes black) switch on the back of a 
European 911 control unit.  This is an eight position switch which gives 
the control unit some small range of adjustment to timing and fuel.  
Typically on 911's the fully counterclockwise position is the standard 
baseline position. The next click clockwise adds a small amount to the 
pulsewidth, maybe a few percent.  I don't remember which is which on the 
next two; one takes out a little fuel, one adds more fuel. 

Position five (four "clicks" from fully counterclockwise, return fuel to 
the baseline, but takes out about 2 degrees of ignition timing. It varied 
from chip to chip, but was usually only kicked in over 1500. the final 
three positions duplicated the fuel changes of the first, but included 
the retarded timing.

The box the person asked about was a 911.618.111.09.  I don't remember 
this being the correct number for an '84 Euro 911; these came with .00 
DME units.

Another item to look for is the "country code" jumper in the wiring 
harness going to the DME.  Each chip had several sets of maps, and these 
jumpers told the DME which set to look at.  There are three choices: 
open, no jumper, a shorted jumper, or one with a resistor. 

Hope this is of some help.

race cars, with balance going to "special" road cars.  One of the 914/8's was 
there, a '73 Carrera RS, the 550 Spyder from the 1954 Carrera Panamericana, 
a 1951 356 Aluminum racing coupe, the "Studie" for the next 911, etc.  Perhaps 
my favorite (okay, besides the 550!) was the 993 C4 drivetrain that you could
get up-close-and-personal with.  It was interesting to see the multilink 
suspension laid bare.  There was a group of German high school kids touring
the works, too, and I had to laugh when one of the pubescent girls swooned
at the picture above the 550: "Das ist JAMES DEAN!!!"

  The "unwashed" (those of us who were NOT picking up our new 993's) then went 
upstairs to join up with those who were, and from there to the main assembly
plant.  I was amazed at how much they let us get in the way of things!!  We
were poking about right at the assembly line.  Our guide told us that Porsche
had brought consultants in from an unnamed Japanese auto firm to streamline
the process.  Things have apparently changed almost yearly as a result.  One
major departure was the creation of a rack for each car, that holds all the
necessary parts, and moves along with the engine being assembled; it bears a
flag of the destination country, mostly stars-and-bars and German flags.  The
guide said the third largest destination was Japan.  Another change was the
tactic of requiring employees come up with suggestions for improvements.  Each
employee must contribute 6 suggestions this year, and next year the ante is
raised to 12 suggestions.  For each implemented suggestion, the employee gets
DM100, plus is eligible for a drawing worth DM28,000!  The bean counters say
that this program has saved the company DM 4M, and they have paid back DM 1.3M
to the employees. Production times are down from about 124 hrs/car to about 
82 hrs/car.  There were all kinds of inspirational-type signs hanging up
about improving quaility, which, between my SO and the guide, got translated 
into rather Orwellian-sounding messages urging employees to improve.  Perhaps 
it sounds better in the mutter tongue.

   For some reason, they bragged (?) to the German kids about how much of their 
parts came from outside suppliers, but not to us! Nevertheless, it was 
really neat to see large BINS of various expensive parts shuttling around.  
Most were easy to spot: con rods, cranks, spark plugs by the gross, twin 
ignitions, cams by the bushel, fans.  The large box marked "kolben (sp?) 
and zylinders" gave me some insight as to the origin of the name of 
Kolbenschmidt (sp?).  I was stumped for a moment, however, as a trolley 
of something that looked like squirrel-cage fan blowers came by: large 
hollow disks, maybe 12" diameter, couple of inches thick, with vanes 
around the circumference.  "I dunno, honey, maybe they are some sort of 
fan... Holy Sh*t, they are BRAKE ROTORS!!!"  Turbo and Carrera RS brakes 
are huge!  

   The old-model wasserpumpers are assembled by hand in a separate area.  
They are down to 2 to 3 928's per day, and one to 2 968's.  I knew the 
end was near, but I was surprised to learn that no new 968 parts are being 
made/ordered.  Cars for pending orders were being assembled from existing 
parts stocks.

  Unfortunately, the dyno room was off-limits due to testing of the Boxster
engine!!  (They are getting serious!)  As has been discussed here before, 
each engine is dynoed to be within 2% of the quoted HP; about 3% of the engines
fail and must be reworked.

  Final assembly, mating the drivetrain and body, was a neat sight.  Time after
mesmerizing time, a gorgeous, naked drivetrain was raised up into an empty
body shell, and a 993 resulted.  It looked too easy and organic.

   We happened across a pile of thick, square radiators, each being mated to a 
cooling fan.  Puzzled, I ventured to guess that they were for the air 
conditioning??  No, the guide pointed to the internal part number -- these 
were for the Boxster!!  He went on to tell us that, although the body shape
has not been finalized, 5,000 blind orders have been placed from the US alone.
At an employee bulletin board, near the Bavarian workers on break drinking beer,
someone had tacked up a picture of the Revell model of the Boxster, along 
with some Auto Motor und Sport artist's renderings.  The guide seemed 
optimistic, but worried about the competeition from BMW and MB.
 
   About this time, the four couples on the tour together began to open up.
One of the two lucky ones (buying 993's) told me the last 911 he owned was
a '72 -- since then they had "never changed."  But he had owned about 40 
356's through the years!  The 993 reminded him of the 356 => instant sale.
He asked what color I bought, saying I must be young and successful.  Had to 
admit that I was neither that young nor that successful!!  After I asked, 
he said he would have bought a Turbo, but they will not accept orders for
Tourist Delivery for 6 months, and he didn't want to wait.  Might trade in
on one later.  Must be nice... 

   The paint shop is now off-limits, due to the amount of dirt tracked in
by customers.  I guess we customers have been responsible for that orange 
peel all these years? <g>  Seriously, I didn't look too carefully, but I 
don't think they have orange peel problems anymore.

   We went to the upholstery shop (yawn).  It turns out that there is the 
equivalent of 6 cows in your average 993 leather interior! We were told 
that the arm rests took 4 hours apiece for a master upholsterer to cover 
in leather!!  I can't say that I think that is justified, but they did 
look nice.  We passed a pile of Targa tops being covered.  One of the 
993 owners-to-be asked "What are those?"  I answered "Targa tops, of 
course" (I have a Targa.)  He said "I know, but they don't MAKE them 
anymore."  Oh, right.  The guide asked the guy assembling them, and, 
of course, they were old ones being recovered.  Damn tempting to try 
and steal a Targa skin from the 2-foot-thick pile!  

   Perhaps the most amazing thing was seeing all these beasts zipping about 
the grounds getting tested.  "Oh, look, a yellow C4 cabriolet.  Wow, a Turbo.
Hey, there goes either a GTS or a Carrera RS!!  There is one of those 315 HP
Audi wagons.  Oh, darn, that one is 'only' a new C2...."  One gets easily 
jaded!  I frantically took a picture of a GTS, only to find out it was "only"
a Carrera RS.

   Weissach is off limits.  Apparently, one of a group of Swedish tourists took
a photo of a Volvo under development there, and sold it to the press.  Volvo
was not pleased.

   All in all, it was very titillating.  Call Karen Evans at PCNA at 
702-348-3244 for arrangements (before they shut down for Boxster retooling).  
Pete Albrecht's new what-to-do-in-germany.FAQ was very useful (thanks Pete),
check it out.  (Tried the choucroute -- it was decadent!)

Subject: 944 Puzzler

This is a little mystery I encountered this weekend.  My mild-mannered, yet
very well qualified mechanic is on the job and should have a solution soon.
 But I though I might pose this mystery to all.

Driving home this Friday night, my 1983 944 suddenly began bucking.  With
seemingly no regular pattern, the car would feel like you were slamming on
the brakes for a split second, then jammimg on the gas peddle - two or two
times a second.  No backfire occurred,  but just a random series of quick
surges (and anti-surges).

I pulled over, and left the car running as I decided to peek under the
hood.  The car idled perfectly, but a new "groan" was coming from the rear
underside of the 944.  Since the car was idling, and not in gear, I
suspected that the groan may be coming from the fuel pump, but it was
uncertain.

Although tough to drive, I managed to continue on my journey by keeping the
RPM low.  The car seemed to surge less when the RPM was low.

I parked the car at my destination and came back later to start 'er up. 
The car would barely start would barely run.  After a few minutes of smoke,
the car ran smoothly again.  Next, under the advice of my mechanic, I
removed the throttle control valve sensor.  It's apparently common for this
sensor to go bad and cut out the gas supply to the engine at about 3000
rpm.  Removing it temporarily makes the engine rev higher, but should solve
the problem if you have a bad sensor.  This had almost no effect on the
surging, however.

Finally, a quick wipe in the tailpipe indicated that the engine was running
rich.

The current hypothesis is:

A) Bad fuel pump (ouch!)
B) Fuel line blockage
C) Throttle control valve sensor
D) Other

I have ordered parts and plan to change the water pump in my '88 944 next   
weekend. In looking at the shop manuals, I have a question I would like   
answered for planning purposes.

In order to remove the rear part of the timing belt cover to get at the   
water pump, do you need to remove the pulleys on the balance shafts,   
crankshaft, camshaft, etc? If so, are special tools required? The factory   
manuals don't say much about this part of the process.

Little resale value--True.  The one you are considering is priced about
right, although you might get them to knock off 1k to 1.5k.

Not built well--Not true at all.  They are built like a tank, have many
features that were state of the art at the time, and feel fantastic.

I would have an experienced mechanic look at this one.  The water damage
is something to worry about.  928's can start to have wiring trouble at
about 10 to 15 years, and water damage can only accelerate the process.

One word of warning.  I think the low resale value may have a lot to do
with the high cost of repair and maintenance.

Do not consider this car an investment.  Buy it only if you enjoy it,
and plan on keeping it for a while.  I personally love mine, and would
never sell it.  However, if it turned out after a year or two that I
didn't like it, I would have no hope of recuperating the money spent
on repairs and maintenance.

Drive it, go home and think about it, then drive it again.  Then, if
you love it, have a mechanic look at it.  Then buy it.

First of all, I just bought a 1987 944 Turbo about a month ago.  It's 
dark blue with a beige interior...it's an absolutely gorgeous car.

It's my very first Porsche...and certainly not my last!  I've already 
told the wife that we WILL have a 911 (or hybrid) some day.

Corvette?  I saw two dead on the side of the road between Phoenix and 
Tucson last week.  Toyota Supra?  Well, that spoiler looks stupid and 
the car is over-priced when all things are considered...$52,000 ?...I'm 
sorry, but I'm not about to pay that much for a Toyota. 

Somebody else mentioned Mustangs, but those cars have such an up-and-down 
history that it's a crap shoot from one year to the next.  Frankly, my 
wife's '94 Corolla handles MUCH better than the Mustang one 
'intellectually challenged' salesperson attempted to dump on us.

Your car needs no defense...it's a Porsche, and everybody who puts it 
down probably wishes they could drive it.

From: Wade Guthrie <wade@realm2.realm.net>
Subject: Paradise Lost

I had found the one.  It had been fifteen months (!) of pouring through
the Porsche Market Letter, Hemmings, Pano, the Autotrader, various
newspapers, and scads of other documentation.  Then, finally, the
elusive 1973 911S Targa appeared -- waiting for me in Jackson Wyoming.

I knew what I wanted.  If the finger of God had seen fit to produce for
me the perfect Porsche, it would have been a straight, all-original
(including the MFI everyone keeps swapping-out for webers) '73S Targa
with AC and sport seats.  Who was I to quibble over venue?

Since I'd been searching for so long, I had assembled all the correct
questions from all the right books (hey, I even built a FAQ from what
I'd learned).  My fingers fumbled for the buttons on the phone.  The
owner told me that the car had receipts, a recent (in mileage, if not
months) overhaul, Carrera tensioners, the works.  I was ready for the
next step so I asked for Xeroxed receipts, photos, and a videotape.

The package took three torturous days to come but when it did, it was
all there.  And it was all tremendous!  My co-workers, including
several bona-fide car buffs, extended their premature congratulations
based upon the marvel they saw in the photos.  The video covered all
the areas that I had asked; I ran and re-ran it looking for the
slightest imperfection.  Time for stage three: the mechanic.

Finding a wrench prooved to be an arduous process.  Phoning a local
dealer netted me the unpleasant information that no Porsche dealers
existed in the entire state of Wyoming.  Probing the net yielded the
name of the head of the local PCA region with whom I *still* haven't
been able to communicate.  My local mechanic told me that he had
contacts in nearly every state in the Union. . .except Wyoming.  The
only possible name was given to me by the owner of the car itself.  But
that was okay, I guess, since PCNA told me that he had been trained at
Porsche and his previous employer (Porsche a dealer) told me that he
was a good mechanic.

So I gave the guy my list of questions.  You know, the standard stuff:
what's the compression, is there any structural rust, do the numbers
match, that sort of thing.  He was going to go over the car pretty
well, he was to devote four hours to the car.

The chit came back with the usual laundry list of problems.  There were
assorted oil leaks, parts that needed rework, a sway bar needed some
refitting, and a few other things of a similar nature.  The compression
was a bit low but, more importantly, it was even across all the
cylindars.  Finally, pre-eminently, there was no structural rust.  I
asked a second time and got the same glorious answer: the only rust was
found on three small spots on the surface skin of the car.

Again, I dialed the phone.  I wanted the car, only I needed the
following list of things fixed (blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda).
The owner agreed and, actually, included a couple of things for which I
had not asked.  Everything was going well.  I was experiencing a few
disappointments, but none with which I couldn't cope.

I was actually going to get my car.  My wife made plane, rental car,
and hotel reservations.  It was Memorial Day weekend and I made
arrangements to get an extra day off.  I was taking my family and a
cashier's check (only one of which I planned to hand-over to the car's
current owner) to the great state of Wyoming.

So, let's fast-forward a little.  There was a plane trip through San
Francisco to Salt Lake City.  The rental car took us six hours up to
our wonderful hotel in Alpine Wyoming.  A new day and a short drive to
Jackson to meet the wonderful man who owns the car that Wade buys.  The
owner and my family caravan to the mechanic's shop where the car is
waiting, beckoning, to me.

I explain that I'm just going to give the car a once-over.  Check it
out to make sure I'm not making a mistake.  I whip-out my tiny
flashlight and a pocket knife and walk to the driver's side door.  I
drop to the floor to start the examination from the ground-up.  And
there it is, staring me right in the face.  A thousand miles and
countless phone calls only to see ribbons of rust running over the
rocker panel accompanied by two giant cracks on either side of the jack
point.

It's Saturday; there's no way I can check to see what fixing this would
cost, though, I *knew* it would be expensive.  Besides, the mechanic
had just told me that there was NO STRUCTURAL RUST.  Everything else he
said must also be suspect.

Devastated, I retreat with my family from the scene.  Still searching
for that perfect, all-original 2.4 911S Targa.

Hiall,

Since I am about to become 911 owner, I'm starting to get the
'hydraulic-tensioner-failure-fobia'. This is a decease that primarily
hit pre -84 non-pressure-fed 911 owners I understand.

This will of course not happen!! We want to be at least a couple of
steps ahead of total failure,..want we?

I have seen and read about various solutions for the 2.0 litre
engines. I understand that these are impossible to update with the
pressure feed system, and wonder wether HP tensioners (non
collapsible), or these small 'tensioner-clamps' (go around the
'piston' to avoid total collapse) will be better than mechanichal
tensioners?

Another question is where to find K&N air filters for the Zenith (Solex?)
carburatored 2.0 litres?

Thanks,

I think the first part has been answered already however for part 2,
about any post mid 70's Ferrari you care to think of. Not the 308GT4 I

Interestingly enough I gather if you stand on the outside of a tight

Subject: 911 Electrical  new alternator questions.



Hello once more, 911 elctrical questions continue...

Thanks to all who responded about my 1981 911SC electrical problems.
I ordered and put in a new alternator this Mem. Day weekend.  A few
qeustions remain.

First, before I reconnect the battery cables and try to start the
car, can someone please read the following few paragraphs and make
sure I wired the new alternator correctly.  Thanks a million.

My old original alternator had 5 connectoins coming off of the back
of it.  The new alternator only has bolts stemming from it for 
connecting 3 sets of wires.  

The old one had 2 brown wires coming from a B+ terminal, one small blue wire
coming from a terminal labeled 61, one big red wire from D- terminal,
3 red wires from another D- terminal, and a small black wire going
to a slot type connector at the bottom of the old alternator.

The new alternator only has a B+ terminal, a D- terminal, and a terminal
labeled 61.  I took the 2 browns from the old B+ and connected them to the 
B+ terminal of the new alternator.  Then I took the small blue wire and
connected it to the new 61 terminal.  Next, I took the BIG red wire AND
the 3 smaller (but all connected) brown wires, and put all 4 on the new
terminal labeld D-.  Thus I have wires on all 3 new terminals.  I am
assuming this is correct.  Is it ok to pair the big red wire with the
3 brown wires?  THIS IS MY KEY QESTION.  Are the two terminals labeled
D- from the old alternator the same so that I can pair the 3 smaller red
wires and the big red wire all onto the same terminal?  Why did the old
alternator have 2 seperate terminals, both labeld D-, one for the big red,
and the other for the 3 wires together???  Before I reconnect the battery,
Is this ok to do what I have done, the pairing of the D- wires?

The new alternator does have another bolt on the back, but it is screwed
all the way in, and is a screw, not really a terminal bolt.  It is on the
same metal back plate as the B+ terminal bolt, and is not labeld in any
way.  Is this used for something?  The reason I am a little confused is
that someone sent me email saying that the new alternator would have
a place for all the wires except the small black volt. reg. wire.  Well
this is true ONLY if I pair up the wire from the old D- terminals onto
the new single D- terminal.  Is this what he meant?

Also, I taped up the small black wire, as I was told this goes to the 
voltage reg., and the new alternator has a volt. reg. built in.  I then
unpluged the 3 prong plug from underneath the old voltage regultor which
is mounted to the left rear sidewall of the engine compartment.  I could
not find out how to get the old regulator out of the car, so I left it
mounted, but unplugged.

Also, as a side issue, the shaft of the new alternator was about .5mm
larger in diameter than the old alternator.  Thus the thick washer that
holds the fan belt pulley in place would not slide over this new alternator
shaft.  This really pissed me off, I spent 1/2 hours with a small drill
bit in a drill filling the indie hole to make it larger so it would fit
on the new shaft.

I have another issue related to the muffler connecting pipe installation
which I will put in another message.  Thanks again.

I feel ashamed that I have to ask this question.  I consider myself a button

On a similar subject, is there any strange wiring necessary to use a power

Subject: Buying a 911

Folks,

I have just joined this mailing list. I have been a porsche fan for a long
time. I have owned an 82 vette happily for
8 years (one dream satisfied). I am now selling the vette and looking 
to buy a 911.

I recently found a 1985 911 turbo-look that I am very interested in.
It has 32,000 miles, being sold by a dealer in Eastchester, New York.
It has an after market exhaust, and appears to have been lowered.
I am not sure if the wheels are small (Yokohama 205/55ZR15 on the front) 
or if the suspension has been adjusted.

They are offering a limited warranty (I don't have the details yet).

I have some questions, any help would be appreciated:

 - Should I take the car to another garage to look at it?
 - Any suggestions for garages in Eastchester/New Rochelle NY area?
 - Can I tell from the VIN# WPOABO913F5121838?
      - if it is factory turbo-look
      - any history on the car (service, owners)
 - the rear tires look a little warn, how much to replace?
 - how much to "raise" the car back to original height?
 - What does a vale adjustment cost? (just curious about maintenance costs)
 - Anything that I can check out on the car myself before buying.

Thanks in advance,
Darryl

Subject: 911 crossover muffler pipe installation.


Hi again, 

Not only do I have electrical problems, I have a muffler pipe
installation problem as well.  I love old cars.

I am replacing my crossover pipe on my 1981 Euro-911SC, mine rusted. The
crossover pipe is an exhaust system pipe which runs from the right
hand side heat exchanger, across the under side of the car (parrallel
to the axles), over the other heat exchanger, and connects to 
the muffler part that runs to the rear of the car.  This crossover
pipe has a 3-bolt flange on each end and has a slight S-type curvature
to it.  It goes under the motor bell housing, and curves up to run over
the top of the left heat exchanger, where it then connects to the
part of the muffler that runs to the rear of the car (is this rear
running fat pipe the cat. converter?).  When installed, it runs neatly
in between the motor/transmission/engineblock/bell housing (whatever) and
the left heat exchanger.  The original (1981) version is actually two
pipes, which connect via a clamp above the left hand heat exchanger.
Thus each original side, has its corresponding 3-bolt flange, and a
stub of pipe at the other end.  When joined with the clamp, one piece
fits inside the other.  

I ordered a used one from PartsHeaven.  Nice shape, not corrosion or
rust.  But it is a new style of crossover pipe.  Instead of two seperate
interconnecting pipes, is is one contiguous pipe.  The end which connects
above the left heat exchanger has accordian like folds in the pipe to
allow for some adjustment when attaching it.  My problem is that since
it is all one piece, with large flanges on either end, I cannot fit either
end of this new pipe through the opening or space that this pipe runs. This
space I need to run this pipe through is the space which exists between the
heat exchanger and the bell housing.   The flange one each end makes it
too big to fit through the gap which would accomodate just the pipe
alone.  (Does anyone have a clue as to what I am writing about now, or am
I just babbaling? :-))  This is my problem.

Well you may say, just remove the left heat exchanger, then install the
pipe, and put the heat exchanger back on.  Well this is easier said than
done.  I attempted this, but the bolts connecting the heat exchanger to
the cylinder head exhaust ports are very frozen and corroded.  I sprayed
WD-40 on them, and waited a few hours, then attempted to loosen the nuts.
They would not move.  Then I heated them somewhat with a torch, and tried
again on only the nuts (using a rachet and universal joint to allow a bend 
around the edge of the heat exchanger).  Well this was a BIG mistake and
I ended up snapping off one nut along with its bolt head which attached
to the cylinder head.  Ouch!  After this little incident I said F--- this.
I did not even get to the problem of how to lossen the hex head bolts on
the other side of these 3 exhaust flanges (I guess there is a special 
tool that you buy, that goes up through the holes on the under side of
the heat exchnager, and fits into the hex head bolts.)  

A few questions:
1.  How bad is it to leave the snapped off exhaust port cylinder head bolt 
in place, and hope that the exhaust gasket from the cylider head remains in 
place?  Only the hex head bolt remains holding this tube in place below the
head.  Is head replacement now eminent, or can this be retapped in place?

2. Next, Someone told me that heating the nuts will make them come off
easily.  I tried this.  But how much do you heat them?  I left my propane
torch on them for about 10-15 seconds.  Do I have to get stuck bolts red
hot before they come loose, or should it only take heating just somewhat?
Is it bad to heat these to a red hot condition - this probably would take
a minute or two from the torch - would the heat from the torch going up
through the heat fins on the cylinder head effect other engine parts in
a bad way?  Heating the nut expands it (I was a Physics major), so you
would think it would be bigger than the bolt and thus looser.  But would'nt
the bolt heat almost the same amount and exapnd as well, thus keeping the
force to release the nut about the same?

3. Finally, how do you get the damn crossover pipe installed?  I think I
may have to resort to cutting it in half with a hacksaw, installing each 
end, and then joining the cut pieces with some sort of clamp (I prefer this
over snapping all the heat exchanger cylinder head bolts.)  Should I
attach the cut pieces of this new crossover pipe, and take the car to a
welding shop and have them weld the pipe together, or would a clamp
work as well?  I am thinking of buying a short 2 inch extension pipe
from a local lauto parts store.  The kind of pipe segment which is fater
on one end, and tapers to a thinner diameter on the opther end.  This
could join the two ends of cut crossover pipe, and a few muffler clamps 
wold keep them secure.  Am I the only person in the world with these
problems?

Subject: 944 Production Run

     
     Hello All,
     
     I have heard recently from Stan in a thread a day or two ago that only 
     approx.. 200,000 911s have been produced. I also read in European Car 
     that the total is just over 350,000, and they had a break down of 
     exactly how many cars of each discipline were produced on every year. 
     17,000 being the most for any one year. If I remember correctly, that 
     was one of the years some where between '72-'76. By the way they are 
     trying to break that record with a production run of over 20,000 with 
     the 993 in FY96. That's why you now see a barrage of 993 ad's and 
     commercials. The thing is all you find are stats on the 911. 
     
     My question is what are the runs for the 944. Does anyone here know?
     I realize it would be tough to figure since they used the Audi 
     physicality during heavy production. But maybe someone has found the 
     stats in a magazine or book out there.
     
     If someone has a quality ballpark figure, I would like to know.
     Thanks in advance.

You don't have to justify your Porsche to anyone. If they don't get it,

I tell people that my 911 is not a luxury car nor is it a sports car. 
It's a race car pure and simple.  I bought it for racing period.

Anything -- *ANYTHING* -- (including mice with toothpicks, or small
rubber bands, or whatever) is better than the purely mechanical
tensioners you see advertised. They are *ONLY* useful in racing applications
where (1) the engine comes apart every few hours and (2) the range of
operating temperatures is very, very narrow (i.e. no stop-and-go).

I have no knowlege of the HP tensioners (something I suppose I should
correct) but the tensioner clamps are usually a very adequate solution.

Why were you trying to do that? I usually just take the CVs off from the
back, and don't screw with that nut unless trying to replace/repack the
wheel bearings... And, BTW, the real answer is an Ingersol-Rand double

After spending the (memorial day) weekend claining up the engine I

So I figured nect oil change, I will change the hose.

Of course I come out to the car Monday morning and there is a nicely

hose.

So I better get it fixed ASAP.  I call all the local dealers and none of them
have the hose in stock - s**t !

The car is still leaking and I am wondering what people think about :-

1.  Just driving as is and topping up the oil (for a few days 'til I can get
a hose).

Or,

2.  Wrapping a goodly amount of tape around the hose and driving as little
as possible for a few days.

Or should I take no chances and not drive the car at all until I can get
the hose and get the car fixed ?  Some opinions please.  I no this could
be catastrophic if it bursts while I am driving (hopefully these hoses
don't burst, but I don't really want to rely on luck !).

Thanks for any quick responses.

This post is for a good friend of mine, and hopefully without getting flamed, 
may I
say that there was some overlap between VW and PCars in the past, so maybe
one of us might want to be of some help to Dave.
- -------
Need help finding a couple of '70s Volkswagon wiring diagrams (seeing as many
Porschefiles have VWs as the daily driver):

Trying to help a neighbor who's idea is to keep his 16 year old son from
wanting (too badly) to drive the Porsche.  Here's the situation:

Kid has a '77 VW bus with no engine.  Got an engine out of a "73 (?) 411
Station Wagon (not sure it's a '73, but the VIN is 4622031327 for those who
know how to tell).  Trouble is getting the wiring correct for the Fuel
Injection Control Unit.  The unit in the '77 bus may not even be the original
(since the engine was removed), but is Bosch 02800015.  The unit from the '73
is with the engine, but the wiring harness has been cut.

So there is a choice (perhaps).
1) Wire the Bosch 02800015 unit to the engine (would need a diagram of which
leads go where, based on the pinout), or
2) Wire the original '73 fuel injection unit back to the engine it came with
(would need a wiring diagram, based on the pinout).

As you can imagine, any help, direction, advise or council would be greatly
appreciated.

And yes, the first vote might be to abandon the project, but heh, we were all
16 once trying to get some old heap running!

The stuff you heard about was probably a "dye-like" spray-on product. 
Eastwood offers the stuff in single spray cans as well as by the case. 
The price was somewhere around $6 a can. I was looking for my Eastwood
catalog last night but couldn't find it. Maybe someone on the list has
Eastwood's phone number? 

I don't have any experience with the stuff but like you, I've heard 
favorable experiences.


Good luck,

 I went with 930 tensioners on my 2.0 and used the "tensioner-clamps"
for saftey. I have read that the arm was the weak part in that setup.
If you go with the newer style tensioners you need spacers. If you update 
the arm the spacers are unnecessary. 

  Will someone explain about the diffrence in using  solid tensioners verses
what is used on street cars?

Wade, 

I have to reply to this post, as I really feel for you.
Fifteen months is a long time to look for a car... what
a bummer.

The "mechanic" who checked out the car should be
laid on the ground under a badly rusted 911 targa with
its top off, and the doors opened, while a pair of Sumo
wrestlers hop in the seats.

>Still searching for that perfect, all-original 2.4 911S Targa

Don't give up hope, there's one out there with your name
on it! A nice S targa should be easier to find than a coupe,
as many S coupes were made into race cars. I wanted a
coupe, but found a nice '72S Targa (original paint!) in several
months (11 years ago).

Subject: 2.4L cooling (factory mod) and A/C questions

Greetings P Philers:

I own a stock 73.5 911T and live in southern California with original (dealer
installed) air conditioning.  I have problems with overheating (more than 230-
240 is too hot) during the summer months.  This happens when I am in slow
traffic or if I am "cruising" about 3.6 K to 5.0 K revs through the hills.

FACTORY MOD rumor

I understand that Porsche offers a kit that includes a larger crank pulley,
longer fan belt and different rear engine mounts (so pulley will clear sheet
metal).  I am told this mod will increase fan rpm by about 30%

Any confirmation out there?

I have an 11 blade fan
The engine (top & bottom) is clean.... R&R'd alternator to clean top of case and
polish fan.  Oil tank is clean (at least outside)
Outside of Oil cooler has been routinly cleaned with carb cleaner of simple
green.
Car is in tune, spark and a/f mix

Oil?... lets not start that again!

Air Conditioning 2.4L engines in HOT climates......What Works for U?

I have seen several threads on A/C in places like here and Arizona but I have
not heard of any results (closure) on resolving the cool car / hot day problem.

Do you need a remote fender-mounted oil cooler to use the a/c during hot days?
I undertand the a/c heat exhanger is mounted under the rear deck lid opening
thus heating the air used to cool the motor.

P.S drove from L.A to Idaho (fishing) last week never ran hotter than 215 but
outside temp was under 75 or so
         no tickets but the Oregon patrol has some nice white Cameros
         took two days to get all the bugs off

Subject: 914-4 and 914-6 dash instruments?

Hi all,

	A question for all you 914 gurus. I have just recently discovered
that most of the instrumentation in my '74 914 2.0 is -NOT- as it came from
the factory. The car has been thru at least three other owners in the past.
And the service records only go back about 10 years. First off, my spedo is
not the same vintage as my tach. The spedo needle has a silver cone on the
hub, and the tach does not. The parking light on the speedo is on the
bottom, not the top as other '74 2.0s have. Secondly, the oil temp/fuel
gauge is not as other '74 2.0s have. Appearance group or sport group don't
seem to have a bearing on this. -my- guage resembles a 911 oil temp/pres
gauge that's rotated 90 degrees. It has a temp gauge on top, fuel on the
bottom, and four idiot light across the center. Brake, Gen, -blank-, and
Oil. Is this a 914-6 gauge? Or is it some wierd hybrid/custom unit? What 
 -should- my gauges look like if they were/are original for a '74 2.0?

many thanks,

	Josh

P.S. my trailing arm bushing are finally done, and this last weekend I had
two particularly awsome autocrosses. The car felt GREAT! Then again, any
bushing is better than no bushing at all. =8-)

Subject: 914: GA-Series '73 2.0L CO Level

One more question about my 914's '73 2.0L engine...

My mechanic told me that the CO needs to be quite high to achieve good
idle and running performance. The Porsche workshp manual says to set the 
idle CO to 1.5%, but my engine is currently set to about 4.5%. Idling is
good (see my eariler message), performance is smooth to redline and the
engine runs quite cool (as you might expect). Note that the car has 
European pistons and slightly milled heads (I think my mechanic said the 
compression test he did showed a consistant 150 psi on all cylinders). 

Is this similar to other 914 2.0L owner's experiences? Are there owners
out there who are able to run at 1.5% CO without problems?

Subject: 914: Clutch, Shifting, and Idling Help Needed


This is my first message to the list, please bear with me and steer me
to some sources of information.

I have a 1970 914 with a '73 GA-series 2.0 L engine, and a '73 side-shifter
transmission. The engine is a recent rebuild, with about 30K miles on it. 
The engine has European pistons, slightly milled heads, and a high-output
oil pump. The clutch pressure plate is stock, but the car has a lightened
flywheel.

Here are my questions/problems:

What can I do to get the best clutch operation? I'm looking for suggestions
all the way from the pedal back to the clutch assembly. What is the best
cable? What is the best pressure plate available? Are there any tricks I
can do with the pulley to get better action? Can someone give me a suggestion
on the best way to adjust the free play? I know it will probably never be 
like the clutch on my G20, but some improvement would be great.

What can I do to get the best shift operation? Again, I'm looking for full-
system suggestions. The car has been converted over to the side shifter, 
and has the stock shift lever and mount. Are the short-shift kits worth it?
BTW, the tranny was rebuilt about 40-50K miles ago, and seems to be in 
fine condition. 

I recently found a <great> mechanic who was able to go through my engine and
work wonders with regard to idle stability and smoothness. We both believe
that the lightened flywheel has got to go at the next clutch job, as it is
probably the cause of some of the idle roughness and instability. I still have
one problem remaining that I'd like some suggestions on. The idle drops about
300-350 rpm when I turn on the headlights (H4 halogen lamps, 100W I think). 
Are there any suggestions on how to decrease this idle drop? 

One more thing my mechanic suggested was to remove the ballast resistor
that is in series with the head temperature sensor to improve my cold start
performance. He believes that the mixture is too rich for the first 15-20 
seconds and removing the resistor may help. Also, he has suggested that I
replace the auxillary air regulator, as he thinks it is not fully open when
cold (it does pass some air by). Any comments on these suggestions?

Again, thanks for any help here....

Subject: Porsche Autocross information - part4

Hi,

I have been asked to submit my columns on autocrossing Porsches
to the archives. Here is the fourth of nine (?) columns. Please let
me know if there are any mistakes or omissions, or other questions
that I should answer. I am editing and submitting them one at a time,
and will upload the whole thing after final editing.

There have been several requests for permission to use this material
in PCA newsletters, etc. Please ask before using it, but basically
any PCA use will be granted if the author is noted. If not too
difficult, I would like a copy of the publication with my material.

"Three Wheeling" by Mike Piera #4 of 9

This chapter will finally cover the water-cooled Porsches.
I do not have as much first-hand knowledge in these cars
as the 911's and 914's, so this information has been
combined from several different sources.

   In 1976 the 924 was offered as an entry level Porsche.
It used many off-the-shelf VW and Audi parts to keep the
price down : Rabbit A-arms, Beetle rear suspension, Audi engine
and 4-speed transmission, etc. This compromised the performance.
In '79 a 5-Speed Porsche transmission was available, but the
'80 and later 5-Speed with normal shift pattern is the best. The
original 924S model (not to be confused with the late '80s 944-
engined 924S) was introduced about 1980, and could be ordered with
4-wheel disk brakes, 15" alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler. This
"Sport Package" made it much like a 924 turbo. Also a limited slip
differential was available, which is needed for serious autocrossing
on all water-cooled Porsches. Without a LSD, much time will be lost
exiting corners with the inside-rear wheel spinning. These '80-'82
924s are the best years for autocrossing, and run in the same class
as the earlier 924 in both PCA and SCCA. In SCCA they are classed
in E-Stock against the 912, 356, and small medium-powered front
wheel drive cars such as the Neon sedan, Saturn, VW GTI, Integra,
etc. A 924 with the right options could have fun in this class.

    The 924 Turbo was a method of giving some much-needed power
to the 924. Although not a bad car, I recommend staying away from this
model for autocrossing. Maintenance costs are very high (Turbo, exhaust,
etc) and autocross potential is only fair. In PCA classes it should be
beaten by a 944 or 944-engined 924S, and in SCCA it is in DS against
some very quick little cars like the Neon ACR and Honda CRX-Si.

   In '83 the introduction of the 944 signalled the end of the
original 924 line in America. The 944 was a big improvement to the 924
platform. The 944 had a true Porsche designed 2.5 liter engine rather
than the VW/Audi/AMC engine of the 924. These had about the same
performance as the 924 Turbo without the turbo lag or other turbo
drawbacks. The handling and steering were highly praised at the time,
and power and torque were adequate. They have never been extremely
competitive in SCCA autocrossing, maybe due to being in tough classes.
The running changes over the years generally improved performance.
As I mentioned above, a limited slip differential is mandatory. Try
to find a car that already has one, otherwise it is very expensive
to add. The 'mid-85 and newer 944 is considered better than the early
ones, with the same 150 HP engine until about '86. The '87-'88 engine
was a little stronger (160 HP), and the final engine in '89 was slightly
larger (2.7 liters). Anti-Lock brakes (ABS) were available since '87, and
standard in '89. In PCA the '83 to '88 944 models are classed together, 
with the '89 running against the 944S. The '88 would seem the best bet, 
and could be ordered with an M030 sport package which deleted accessories
and added better suspension. But the earlier models with 15" x 7" rims
have an advantage in gearing by using 50 series tires (225/50/15).

   In SCCA, all 8-valve 944 models ('83-'89) run in C-Stock against the
914-4 2.0 and various Mazdas. The '88 or '89 is probably best for
SCCA also. Remember that in SCCA you can use any options that were
available from the factory for that year and model, while in PCA you
must check the rules for option points. I should also cover the '87-'88
924S here, which is basically a 944 with the pre-85 interior and 924
non-flared body (with narrower 6" wheels). This could be an autocross
"sleeper", since it has the same performance as a 944 but is lighter.
In '88 a special "M030" option package was available with no options
(wind-up windows, etc), wider 7x15" rear wheels and stiffer adjustable
suspension. In PCA the 924S should beat the 924 Turbo. In SCCA, the
924S has been quite competitive in C-Stock against the 944, 914-2.0
and non-turbo Mazdas.

    The 16-valve 944S was available starting in '87, at 188 HP. It
had Anti-Lock brakes, and could be ordered with the Sport Package.
In '89 it also got a bigger 2.7 engine. These are competitive in PCA,
where the only other car is the '89 944. But in SCCA they are in
B-Stock against the faster 944 S2, and 944 Turbo. The 944 S2 was
available from '89 to '91, with a huge 3.0 liter, 208 HP version of
the 944 4-cylinder engine. The S2 is very well suited to autocrossing,
with a wonderful engine which is stronger than the Turbo at the low
end (coming out of slow turns). The S2 competes in PCA against the 968
and late model 944 Turbos. The 968 is the latest and greatest version
of the original 924 platform. The 3.0 liter engine was tweeked
to 236 HP, and new bodywork was featured. All of the improvements
in performance, safety, and comfort over the years have added hundreds
of pounds to the 924/944/968 line. But hopefully the weight has been
more than offset by the improved engines, brakes, and suspension.
Unfortunately, the 968 competes in SCCA A-stock against the 911. But
in the PCA it could win it's class.

    The 944 turbo was added to the line in '86, and production stopped
after the '89 models. There were many improvements over the standard
944 in addition to the 217 HP engine. These can now be purchased at
very reasonable prices in the depressed used sports car market.
They seem to be worth more than the "blue book" values. There are
plenty of good ones available so you should be able to find one
with the right options (Sport package, cloth sport seats, largest
available wheels, Limited Slip) at a good price. These are even
better cars for track events. The '88 944 Turbo S and all '89
models have powerful 247 HP engines, stiffer suspension, huge ABS
brakes, and stronger transmissions with Limited slip standard. They
could be ordered with Sport options and huge 8" and 9"x16 wheels.
This gives true supercar performance for about the price of an average
new car. The SCCA has re-re-classed the '88S and '89 out of the earlier
944 Turbo's class (B-Stock) into A-Stock, where they have very little
chance of winning. The older 944 Turbos have had some success
in SCCA autocrossing, but the 944S2 seems faster. In PCA, the '86-'88
turbos run in their own class, while the '88S and '89 run with the
944 S2 and 968. The turbo should have an advantage on a course with
long straights, but the S2 or 968 could win on tighter courses.
	
    Most people do not think of the 928 as an autocross car,
but it can be! They may be big and heavy, but so are Corvettes,
which are about the fastest stock autocross car. And used 928s
are a bargain. Bruce Domeck, an excellent Porsche mechanic
from the Kentucky (?) area, autocrossed his early 928 "Land
Shark" successfully and later used it as a tow-car for his
Formula race car! That is a true dual-purpose vehicle. I have also
seen an '84 928S with stock height-adjustable suspension autocrossed
competitively. The 928 was first offered in '78 with a 4.5 Liter, 230
HP V8 engine. The 928S came to the USA in '83, with the 4.7 liter
engine giving 242 HP. For '85 and '86, the 928S had a 5.0 liter engine
with 290 HP. Finally the 928S4 twin-cam engine arrived in '87 
with 320 HP, and was continued in the 928GT and GTS. Competition
packages were available around '81. The earlier cars are lighter
but have narrower wheels and less power. The automatic transmission
option should not be overlooked! Auto transmissions are very popular
in V8 Corvettes and Camaros, with many of the fastest cars in the
country going shiftless. Auto transmissions are especially good
for Pro-Solo starts, where the car is launched by a series of timed
starting lights. As with all front-engined rear-wheel drive
cars, a limited slip differential is a must. 

The PCA puts all 928 models before the S4 ('86 and earlier) together, 
and the S4/GT/GTS together in their own class. It seems the later models
of both groups would be the best. The SCCA classes the 928 and 928S in 
B-Stock against the 944 S2 and Turbo. The 928S4, GT, and GTS go to the 
SCCA A-Stock class against the 911, Toyota MR-2 turbo, etc. Either SCCA
class  would be tough to win, but it would be interesting to see a 
928 GTS up against an early 911 - Massive torque mismatch!

   That about wraps up all Porsche models and their potential
for autocrossing success. By now you know how your current Porsche
fits in the various classes, and what it competes against. You may
also have your eye on another model that seems like it would be
better suited and more enjoyable to compete in. Whichever car you
choose, be sure to get all the necessary rule books, owners manuals,
etc. before proceeding with any modifications. The next articles will
deal with preparing your car for Stock class competition.

More to come!

Subject: 911 tranny

Hey all,

I want to install a set of those air shocks in my 911 so I can make it
jump up and down at stop lights....anybody have any ideas for me ?

Ok, Ok I'm just kidding....

Actually I'm soliciting input on a "rebuild" of the 915 tranny ('82 SC).
I have considerable trouble going into 1st, in fact it's basically impossible
unless the car is at rest or I double clutch (once tranny is warm).  Down
shifting into second is a little rough too, upshifting to second and third
is also getting worse.  Basically I think that 1st, 2nd and 3rd gear
synchros and probably dog teeth are worn and need replacing.  I'm
also considering (still) the rack-pinion swap out to 7:31.

I was originally thinking of doing this myself, but my projected travel
schedule and projected inclination to do the job indicate I'd better
have someone else do it.  I'm willing to drop the tranny out, ship it and
bolt the new one back in.

Does anyone have any info/experience on the folks that advertise in pano
et al on $1k tranny rebuilds...what gets replaced for example ?  What
*SHOULD* be replaced ?  What to look out for ?  

Also, I've got some roughness in the rear pulling from rest.  It's sort
of a groaning that I feel in my butt (no rude comments thank you!).  It
seems like it might be worse pulling away turning (either side) than
straight....diff ?  CV's ?  No clicking from the CV's.

Hello all,

Is there a secret to changing from 1st to second gear on a 911SC? 
When I change gears from 1st to second, I hear this horrible grinding 
and clashing noise.  Doesn't happen in the other gears.  It seems to 
happen every time when I accelerate at high rpm's.  It is 
easier to change from 1st to 2nd when the car is moving at slower 
speeds and the grinding noise doesn't seem to be there.

I've tried a few SC's and I always get the same problem.  Other 
people driving the same cars don't seem to experience it.

Do I need a tranny rebuild or driving lessons?

Hi there,

this afternoon I wanted to let some fresh air in and when the sunroof

Is this regulated by microswitches ? And if so, where can i find

they seem to be used to regulate the closing/unlocking position. 
Suggestions are appreciated.

On the '78 through '89 911's you can do the following:

Front: 8x16 Fuchs (944 Turbo (951) part number with 225/45ZR16 tires.
Rear: 9x16 Fuchs (from 911 Turbo) with 245/45ZR16 tires.

Fuchs are by far and away the best wheels you can put on your '88 911.
8x16 944 Turbo offset Fuchs will cost you around $600 for a pair in
excellent condition. The 9x16 fuchs will cost you about $1200 for the
pair.

The only drawback to this setup is that there are not many tires made in
the 225/45ZR16 size. Dunlop SP 8000s, Pirelli P-Zero, P-700, and Yoko AVS
Intermediate come to mind.

Depending on the particular car, you may want to roll the front fender
lips. My car did not require this until I tried using and 8x15 wheels
with 225/50ZR15 tires for autocross.

The 9x16 setup on the rear is not a problem.

Hi, Arthur,

You might try some compressed air (start at about 10 psi) for the sunroof

The engine cowl, yep, I would use a stream of water. (Of course, if you

      You are right in that none of the GT4s had dry sump from the factory,
 but I think only the Euro model GTB and GTS had dry sumps, and probably
 not any of the Mondials. Trap doors and baffles notwithstanding, Non-dry
 sumped cars will starve on right turns. Luckily for carbureted cars (until
 1980) fuel bowl starvation will save the engine. Injected cars will continue
 to power up thru corners and cause damage. When piston rings are $75 a
 piston and bearings are $500 a set, this becomes inconvenient...
      The article I've got in front of me says the 308 at 8000 rpm will pump
 400 gallons per hour, or a quart every 2-3 seconds (the oil pump is driven
 at 0.9 times engine speed, unlike most other cars which are 0.5 times).
      Adding dry sump to just about any car is $$$, just one of those lucky
  side benefits of a 911.....

When I change gears from 1st to second, I hear this horrible grinding .

I'm not sure what the technical explanation is, but I've always noticed that
the 1-2 upshift requires a little patience compared to all the others. Kind
of a "breath" between the two gears instead of just slamming it.

Ummmm. Yes.

If you're built like me, just pull *REAL HARD* and it will only make
that noise a few more times... 8{)

If you're not, try "bumping" the shifter into the 3rd gear detent
before heading into 2nd. Works every time.

915s wear out their 2nd synchros at about 10k miles. You can either
keep replacing them, or learn to drive in the new mode. Most of us just
deal with it...

hi Sean,

I bought the my turbo tie rods from Vertex and had no problems with them. The
kit includes the boot and spacers as well. Just make sure you buy a pickle
fork from your local auto parts store (under $10- performance products sells
a non destructive remover for $90, but you are going to put new ones on

assorted tools to get my first tie rod end off, the second one took 2
minutes. 

The parts from Vertex were German and had Porsche type part numbers. They
seemed to be of good quality.

I was just wondering, my mechanic calls places like Vertex, bandits or some
weird name like that implying that they sell inferior parts. If I were to buy
a Sachs clutch package from Vertex and one from Porsche, besides the price,
 would there be a difference. I know about economics, but are there different
specs between a Porsche clutch and an oem clutch to lead to such a price
difference or is it all pricing?

Subject: Baby seat idea for early 911s

Hi,

With all this talk about baby seats, I thought I would tell you about the
"integrated baby seat" that came with my car- a '73 targa.  One of the PO had
a child and made a seatbelt out of vinyl and seatbelt material and attached
it using the rear seatbelt and the metal loops* above and below the seats.

*(In my car, which I assume is similar to everyone elses, there are metal
loops above and below each seat. These metal loops are screwed into special
plates not just sheet metal and seem rather strong.) 

I don't have a kid, so I don't know the regulations regarding child seats,
but this "seat" seems pretty good and strong, perhaps not legal. However
there is no upper body restraint but that could probably be incorporated into
the seat. I tried making a diagram of the seat, but it might not be clear. If
anybody has any questions, feel free to e-mail me

Can be summed up in four words: Thermal Rate Of Expansion.

Why do you need tensioners in the first place? Because the centerline of
the cam is NOT a constant distance from the centerline of the crank.
Given that, how can a solid *ANYTHING* be able to take up that slack
for a cold engine *AND* a hot engine??

The solid tensioner is *POSSIBLY* useful in endurance racing, where the
engine comes up to temp and stays there roughly forever (well, at
least in terms of the net engine life). You do have to pre-calculate
the size of the tensioner give the specific engine configuration and
anticiapted heat range, and the material from which the tensioner is
made. Leading to that old question of "WHY?". What you'd really do is
use a *NEW* late 930 tensioner with a guard, or use pressure-fed units
instead. Then throw them away at the end of the race, and rebuild next
time. 

Like I said, we do things different when you're racing for keeps...

Hey all,

I want to install a set of those air shocks in my 911 so I can make it
jump up and down at stop lights....anybody have any ideas for me ?

Ok, Ok I'm just kidding....

Actually I'm soliciting input on a "rebuild" of the 915 tranny ('82 SC).
I have considerable trouble going into 1st, in fact it's basically impossible
unless the car is at rest or I double clutch (once tranny is warm).  Down
shifting into second is a little rough too, upshifting to second and third
is also getting worse.  Basically I think that 1st, 2nd and 3rd gear
synchros and probably dog teeth are worn and need replacing.  I'm
also considering (still) the rack-pinion swap out to 7:31.

I was originally thinking of doing this myself, but my projected travel
schedule and projected inclination to do the job indicate I'd better
have someone else do it.  I'm willing to drop the tranny out, ship it and
bolt the new one back in.

Does anyone have any info/experience on the folks that advertise in pano
et al on $1k tranny rebuilds...what gets replaced for example ?  What
*SHOULD* be replaced ?  What to look out for ?  

Also, I've got some roughness in the rear pulling from rest.  It's sort
of a groaning that I feel in my butt (no rude comments thank you!).  It
seems like it might be worse pulling away turning (either side) than
straight....diff ?  CV's ?  No clicking from the CV's.

Greetings again all. I've been quite for a couple weeks, but now I've got
914 problems again...
(In case anyone remembers, I had the rusted left suspension console - my
restoration guy managed to bend up some thick-thick metal to repair what was
already in the car - looks good and seems to work fine, if not the 100%
"proper" solution.)

Anyways, I was driving home a few days ago, and suddenly it seemed that the
car was running on three cylinders - bucking, backfiring, etc. It didn't
stall, or exhibit any other problems, except rough and less-power running.

Next time I tried it, it still ran poor, and it seemed to have electrical
problems - when I stepped on the brake, the generator light came on, and the
tach dipped sharply (just the tach, not the actual rpms.) Ditto for the turn
signals...

Now the generator isn't lighting up, but it's running very poorly still -
constant backfiring at all rpms, but more so under load. Light blue smoke is
coming out the exhaust - the warmer the car, the more smoke. The inside of
the tailpipe is wet with raw gas, and there's a small amount of gas that
sprays onto the ground from where the heat exchangers and muffler meet (I
guess I've got a leak!). *sigh*  My first thought was valve problems, but
could it just be running exceptionally rich for some reason?

Waahh... I just want my 914 to stay running right all summer, I PROMISE I'll
do serious work all around her this winter... :(

Oh well. Such are the joys of owning a sports car. :)

I would look for balance shafts that are not timed quite right.

If they are severely out of time, this kind of vibration will start
at about 2000 rpm and not get any better.

I have also heard of a case or two in which failure to fix this
problem quickly resulted in oil pickup breakage, and more
recently, broken exhaust manifolds.

Well, that's a good question....

I remember back in the mid-80s, when as a Sun OEM I asked what the difference
was between the Fujitsu disk drives that I sold and the Fujitsu disk drives
that they sold. I was taken to a place with some thermal cycle chambers and
other misc electronic gear and told that each drive sold by Sun had some
large number of hours running a complex surface failure analysis pattern
while being heat cycled through the entire operating range on a continual
basis, while I just sold the drives the way the came off the boat. OK, that
explained the *huge* price difference.

Later we got into it about memory (I'd paid someone to engineer my own
private-label Sun-2 memory boards and it was STILL cheaper.) Roughly the
same thing happened, except this time I didn't see the testing -- it was
all done at the chip level by the manufacturer "to a certain level of 
specification". Whereas I used off-the-shelf memory chips. Implying that
maybe I had a higher per-chip failure rate (which was actually true).

How does this apply? Well, maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. Maybe
Porsche has very, very high standards and statistical QA techniques that
insure that the parts are essentially perfect and defect free, and
that the "OEM parts" that you buy on the open market are the *same* parts
that haven't been "qualified.". And maybe the new EuroSelect line is 
a collection of "partially qualified" parts that are good enough for them
to feel OK about selling, but not good enough to put the Porsche name on.
Or maybe there *IS* no difference, and they're just profiteering bastards.

I have a pretty good idea what the party line is, and know why I tend
to buy lots of the "important" stuff via dealer channels... On the other
hand, I tend to qualify my own parts a lot, and will shop price on those.

I don't claim to posess any Revealed Knowledge, but with my SC, you have
to stop thinking about selecting gears based on stick position, and
start thinking in terms of stick force.  *Gentle* stick force. 
(If it makes you feel any better, F-16 control sticks also work on
force input rather than position input.  Okay, okay, I'm
reaching...)  On your first-second shift for example, pop the stick from
first to neutral, then pull steadily and gently until the stick slides
into second... may take from a half to a full second, which as I
understand it is basically the time it takes your tired synchronizer to
do its thing... shouldn't take much force at all, maybe a few pounds at
most.   This is hard to do consistently, especially in the heat of
combat, but it works 95-98% of the time for me, and it sure costs less
than a tranny rebuild.

Speaking of tranny rebuilds, hasn't anyone done this recently?  I'm
still waiting for some Voices of Experience to answer Martin Walker's
recent query re: 915 box rebuild shops!

mike; a few corrections on your superb overview of the various porsche models
in scca and pca autocrossing;
  
  1. I believe cis injection was standard on '73 911t's while mechanical
injection came on the e and s, then 74 saw cis become the standard injection
on all 911s.

   2.  914's especially 2 liters were exceptionally competitive in the 70's
as new england drivers Ed and Pam Sanborn and Lowell Peabody all took
national championships in C stock.  In fact Pam's win in the '76 Nationals in
Columbus Ohio, set a time in the women's class which beat all the men in c
stock, a feat not repeated for many years.

  3. The 944S had abs optional not standard, the S2 which came out in 89 had
standard abs.

   4.  There was no 89 944S it was a 2 year car both years at 2.5 liter.

        Keep up the good work

Subject: The 928

Dave Snell inquired about the desirability of purchasing a 1985 
928S(55K miles) for $14K.  As an owner of such a beast, I am 
willing to contribute my $0.02.

Dave, 

Let me first say that I know of no Porsche model, regardless
of what the initial purchase price is, that is not expensive to
properly maintain.  Furthermore, unless you have a good deal of
disposable income AND a lot of time to research the (constantly
changing) market, I do not feel that one should purchase a P-car
for any reason other than personal enjoyment [gratification :-)].
Hence, if you can get through to the bottom line, my advice to you
is to drive the car, consider what you have experienced, then, if
you decide to continue, pay a reputable PORSCHE mechanic to give
you a complete status report on the car (this will cost you at
least $100).  Following this, if you are still interested, drive
the car again and be prepared to negotiate the best price you can
from a position of knowledge.

Last year I bought a car very similar to the one you have
described.  Mine is a 1986 928S that spend most of its life stored
in a garage in Florida when it was not being driven by its
original female owner.  Except for the normal small paint chips,
etc., it was in nearly perfect visual condition.  All important
records, including the original sales receipts, etc., were
available.  It passed inspection by a (trusted) P-car mechanic
with only a few minor items being noted (needed front brake pads).
The car had 41K miles on it.  The asking price was $21K.  I got it
for $17K.

Within a couple of thousand miles, the dreaded water
pump failure had struck.  (This should be no surprise.  They are
as well known as the early chain tensioned failures in the air-
cooled engines).  I decided to do a major preventative mainten-
nance at this point and replaced ALL of the belts, hoses,
thermostat, etc. at the same time the water pump was replaced.  It
cost me about $1500.

Was it all worth it for me?  Absolutely!  I love this car.  It has
essentially the same 4-cam, 32-valve engine as the 87 928 S4 and
following models do and with about as much performance, except at
the top end (who needs 165 mph?  152 is enough for me!)  The 1985
928S is virtually the same as the 1986 with the exception of the
big (huge!) S4 brakes that went on the 1986.5  It is not super
quick off the line for the first 100 feet or so, but it is
ferocious after that.  It has really incredible acceleration
between 50 mph and way beyond 100 mph.  It is not simply a "luxo
cruiser" as some (very likely not very familiar with it) have
described.  Take it into some challenging turns and you have no
question about its P-car heritage.  Brakes are superb!  A blast!

Would it be worth it for you?  I dont know.  The 928 is probably
the most misunderstood of all the modern P-cars.  Keep in mind
that only a very few 928 models of any kind have ever been
produced.  No more than a couple of thousand a year have ever
made it into this country.  They had very high initial costs and
did not sustain their value.  Hence, in my simple way of 
thinking, you can get an awful lot of car now for a relatively
small amount of money, IF you really want one and can afford
to keep it maintained.  Dont even think of getting it if you
cant afford to keep it running properly!

I will mention in passing that my only regret in buying the
928 was that I then had to part with my dearly beloved (and 
also frequently misunderstood) 1982 931 (AKA 924 turbo) which I
had owned for 5 years.  The two cars were as different as night
and day, but they were both Porsches, without a doubt.

So, good luck in making your decision!

Allow me to muddy the waters further with another data point:

I have the 474 'option' code listed in my spare wheelwell which is standard 
equipment for '87 951.  BTW, the option list in the FAQ was sent to me from 
Mark Sundt who said it was scanned it in from an 1987 Porsche sales brochure
so I believe this is correct.  I have the original shocks on the car which
are yellow Konis and are labelled 'adjustable' with a 951.xxx.xxx part no.
So we've got 1 set of yellow Boge, yellow Koni and black F&S.  Sounds like 
Porsche, 'er.. Audi, put in whatever was available at the time.   

Anyone else with an '87 951 want to help us settle this burning question: 
what was the stock struts/shocks supplied on your car and do you have the 474 
'option' code?

Subject: happy 914 shifting & rocker/valance resto ?'s

Hi folks.  A few weeks back I posted a question about how to get my
silly 914 into 1st gear at a stop light.  When I tried to get it into
first - no go.  If I put it into any other gear first, I'd get a grind
and then it still wouldn't go into first.  Several others replied back
with "Well, me too.".  Gary Pighetti had the answer.  I've included
his original message (by permission) at the end of my post.  But briefly:

While at stop light, in neutral.  Nudge the shifter toward second until
you feel things happening, then go for first.  Goes right in!  a-mazing!
Takes a bit of practice, but once you get it going it works every time.

Other questions:

What do I do about my rocker panels?  They were originally orange.
Painted black.  Then had decals applied to them.  They look awful. :(

Should I buy new ones (metal, of course) and have them painted?  powder
coated? or should I have the old ones redone (what am I asking for if
I call a shop? do they sand blast them or what?)  If anyone has northern
california (bay area) shop recommendations, fire 'em my way.  The rockers
themselves aren't dented/rusted (well, a few dots of rust, but nothing
much), they're just really ugly.

Similarly, does any place sell metal rear valances?  Automotion,
Performance Products and Automobile Atlanta don't seem to carry them?
Mine is dented and bashed up pretty nasty.  All I see are fiberglass
repro's.

I'm not "restoring" the car, but I do want to keep it in as near
original condition as possible.

Thanks much.

Sorry for to delay, Jeff - I've been away for a few days....

It does have autoreverse cassette (the head needs to be cleaned as the tapes 
play a bit lower than the radio portion does.  It does have 4 bands AM/FM/ 
Longwave and Shortwave.  I would assume that it would fit a 928 but I cannot 
be sure.  It was the stock radio from my '86 Euro 911.  As for the value 
maybe someone on P-Files could conjure up a fair price, I'm open to offers....

Hello All Again,  Thanks for very helpful comments for previous messages.
  The 2.0 (newly acquired) and I are beginning to get aquainted.  I hope to
become old friends, much like my '69 Bug and I were.  The Bug and I had a very
strong trust bond between us, I understood what made it go, and vice versa, in
fact, it was love.  I had a troubling relationship with a seductive but rotten
'72 914, and she up and died on me (permanent-like).  Since the '72 and I parte
d, I went out and got me a shiny new Mechanical Engineering Degree, and more
importantly, 10 years of car/street-smarts.  I now am a confident-kind of guy
in that no car scares me any more, However in order to trust this new '76 2.0,
I want that old Bug trust relationship.  I want to go through every part of the
F.I. system and understand how/why it works?  I want to be cockey once again as
with the old bug, where I could fix any problem on the road, in the dark, with
bubble gum and my trusty 10 and 13mm wrenches.  This is alot to ask?  To all of
the 914 F.I. (Bosch-D) veterans, I would appreciate a list of your horrors/joys
where to look first, when to cry, when to rejoice, etc.
  I'm planning to order the Manuals and Tips books from Auto. Atlanta. If there
is a better source, please sing out.  My only regret is that John Muir had not
continued his VW series and expanded into Porsches....sometimes these Porsche-T
ypes are just a bit too uptight...everyone can use a giggle now and then.

  Stainless Steel Brakelines...Auto Atlanta and Tweeks sell them, can anyone
out there beat the $79 price?
I appreciate and respect this People-Base

Sorry if this is a repeat!!!!!  I sent it last two days, but it did 
not show up in my digests, and I would like to get feedback sooner 
rather than later on this!  Inspection due today!!  (oops, now yesterday!)


Philes,

   A hopefully-not-inflammatory tire question.  My '82 SC presently is
sooo stock that it has P7's on it!  That is about to change, as it needs 
new fronts.  However, the rears are only ~ 1 year old. (*Please* no flames!
I was naive a year ago!  I thought P7's were the best thing since the 
Chia Pet! :-)  At the time, I figured the rears would wear quickly enough that 
I would have to buy 4 tires next go 'round, but the rears are still in quite 
good shape (guess I am not getting the rear end out enough, huh?).

   The question:  Can I put decent tires on the front without creating a
mismatched, oversteering monster that you-know-who would be proud of?  Are 
some combos better than others?  Application is street driving only, daily
driver (so wet performance is a consideration).

   <Warning: Religious issue approaching> I am leaning towards Yoko A509's.
I may still pop for AVS-I's, but the differential seems a little too
$teep.  (I guess that, in Stan's accurate categorization of Quality-oriented,
Value-oriented, and Price-oriented people, this makes me a "V-type 
personality.")  Other tires in the 509 price range include BFG Comp T/A3, 
Dunlop D40's, and (stretching a bit) Conti CZ 91's.  Any 
thoughts/recommendations?  Private e-mail is welcome if the which-tire-is-best

Subject: Re: 924S/944 engine vibration.


Sorry, This is a related question, not an answer.

I have a similar symptom, but with my 3.2 911 engine. There is a deep
low frequency vibration that peaks at 3400-ish, and is most noticeable
when the throttle is completely closed - off the gas, engine braking,
in gear, as the rev needle passes slowly down through the mid 3000s,
the vibration (and distant rumble) rises to max at ~3400 and then falls
to nothing by 2800 - and I can feel it through the gearbox.
It doesnt seem to be getting worse, and its not related
to the gear I am in. It seems odd that it feels worse when the engine is
being driven by the wheels rather than when on the gas, I would have
thought it would feel the same either way.
Is this the same problem (balancing) and is it expensive/difficult 
to fix?

Subject: ABS & racing/ Personal experience

Earlier this year there was a thread going about the advantages/disadvantages
of ABS on race cars. Since my track car (89 951) has ABS, and since I
recently left a race course at a high rate of speed, I have a bit of input
into this matter.
While attending the Brian Redman Jefferson 500 at Summit Point I was tooling
down the main straight at 140MPH trying to figure out how to pass a worthy
opponent. I followed for 2 laps, noting his braking point, and figured that I
could out brake him going into turn 1. Several factors played into the
failure of my plan. The first problem was that it had rained and the track
was still damp. Secondly for some inexplicable reason my friend decided to
brake earlier than he had done on the previous laps, and thirdly and
certainly not least a 917 closed on me with a considerable discrepancy in
speed. By the time I processed all this information I was just about into the
trunk of the 911 in front of me with no chance of avoiding a mishap.
So I stood on my brakes and steered left, off the course and into the wet mud
and Virginia red water soaked clay. I did pass the 911 but in a way that I
hadn't planned. Anyway here I was with both a lateral and forward vector. The
car car really wanted to rotate and I'm sure that if it had I would have
rolled many times but with my foot firmly planted on the brakes I was able to
correct the yawing and keep the car straight, all the time sliding forwards
and sideways towards a dirt bank that keeps you in that particular county.
The car lost it's lateral velocity about 5 feet from the bank and finally
came to a stop about 200 feet beyond the first turn. After driving around in
the mud I located the escape road and made my way back to the course where a
SCCA worker directed me back onto the circuit. I told him I'd rather think
about what happened for a second or two if he didn't mind. He then told me he
saw the whole incident and for the life of him he couldn't figure out why the
car didn't spin, flip and crash. 
Of course I was delighted that it didn't and had a great time the rest of the
weekend. I would like to attribute the happy ending to my superior driving
skills but I don't think I'll get away with that.
 What I'm really thinking is that the ABS saved my ass in this particular
instance and any thoughts of disabling it for racing have vanished. I'm also
thinking that you should always expect the unexpected in a racing situation
but of course I should have learned that lesson a long time ago.
Glad to be here to tell the tale!!

Hi Trond,

The 2.0 litre engines can indeed use the pressure-fed tensioners, unless
I am very much mistaken.  We replaced a broken feed line on a '69 911T
last year, somewhere along the New York State Turnpike, as we drove out
to the Watkins Glen race track.

It may be that the first series of engines cannot use the pressurized
tensioners.  That is, the first 3,000 or so engines which had centre-
lubricated camshafts rather than the spray bar.  I am not sure.

Excellent suggestion!! And, in case you missed it (I had to go back and
check myself) the *late* editions of the Muir book *DO* have the D-jet
EFI stuff documented. See the '81 edition or later, p. 135 talks about
"Electronic Fuel Injection" and *differentiates it from AFC*. This is nothing
but the good ol' D-jet system you're trying to know and love. Honest.

See also "Bad Idea, Part 2".

This gets asked a lot; I try to speak up every time. The braided lines are 
designed as a less-than-one-year "consumable" item for road racing. They're
good for probably less than 2000 *TRACK MILES*. They do *NOT* appreciably
improve the performance except for those odd situations where mean fluid
pressure is enormous (like dual 2" I.D. master cylinders driving stock
two-piston "M" front calipers -- and yes, I *HAVE* seen that one!). And I
can just about guarantee that you won't replace them every 2000 miles. Hell,
that could be once a month!!! And track miles are a lot easier on the car
than street miles, too... So maybe you should just plan on replacing them
once a month...

What they *DO* is cause accidents. You think "cool racing part -- this will
REALLY work well" and then you don't think about it again. Three years
later, the inner teflon line has abraded a hole or a weak spot by rubbing
on the *inside* of the outer steel braid, and when you grab the brakes,
there's nothing there. Then we get to the real fun part. They're NOT rated
as "OK to use on the street" by the DOT. Your insurance company finds out. 
They don't pay off because it's *YOUR* fault from gross negligence due to
installed parts not rated for street use.

Instead, try replacing the lines with nice stock rubber lines. Do it every
five years or so if it makes you happier. I've even started using them for
racing cars, particularly the IMSA endurance cars, and I think I'm not
alone on that one...

The gearbox was rebuilt last August and the car seems to be in good order.

Subject: Leather/Vinyl Care/Refinishing

The care and feeding of the leather and the vinyl components of your
automotive interior are two very different processes.  If you are using one
product on both, that is somewhat like using gasoline as a lubricant. It will
work, but not for long.  I will cover the care and feeding of leather and
vinyl separately.

Leather having once been used to keep the insides of a cow from falling out
was designed to pass moisture through tiny pores.  These tiny pores absorb
human perspiration and as the water evaporates, salts contained therein
remain to absorb the essential oils in the leather.  This accumulation of
salts and other grunge should be cleaned from the leather about twice a year
(more often if the seats get more than their fair share of your leftover
sweat).  The loss of oils within the leather is the first step to hardening,
cracking and shrinkage.  Leather dashes are very prone to hardening and
shrinking.  Your dash is subjected to the destructive UV rays and heat
concentrated by the windshield.  The leather (or vinyl) of your dash rests
upon a metal backing that acts like a frying pan.  This "frying" drives the
essential oils from the leather causing premature shrinkage, cracking and
hardening.  Thus a dash should be treated more often than the seats or door
panels.

Cleaning leather may be accomplished by using a mild soap and water, or a
specifically designed leather cleaner.  Of all the products I have tried, I
still like Lexol pH Cleaner.  It is pH balanced, and gentle. All cleaners
will rehydrate the leftover salts and grime and wash them from the leather
fibers.  Use only leather products on leather, do not use vinyl cleaners as
these products tend to be much harsher and may not be that beneficial to the
leather.  Any cleaner should be rinsed thoroughly from the leather.  I have
tried spraying off with a hose, but that just seemed to fill the car with
soapy water (a hole drilled in the floor was needed to drain it out - just
kidding).  I went back to using a damp cloth and repeatedly wiping down the
leather.  Once the leather is clean, a conditioner should be used to restore
lost oils and emollients.  There are several conditioners on the market.  Two
of my favorites over the years are Lexol Conditioner and Tony Nancy Leather
Conditioner.  These two seem to be the most easily absorbed into the leather
fibers and tend to leave a relatively less "greasy" finish than any of the
other products I have tried.  Another good product is Connoly Hide Food.
 This product is made from rendered animal parts and will turn rancid in
about two years.  This and the distinctive "cow" smell removes it from my top
two list (I spent too much time milking the south end of a north pointing
cow, so am not a fan of cow smells).  Zymol makes a product called "Leather
Treat".  It does not,  in my humble opinion,  do any better job than the much
less expensive Lexol or Tony Nancy products.  Again, do not use a vinyl
product as a conditioner on leather and above all try to avoid silicone based
products.  The silicone oil will dissolve out the leather's natural oils and
tend make the leather sticky.  Silicone has a very high electrostatic
attraction, so will invite every dust particle within miles to set up camp in
your interior.  Apply the conditioner to a soft cloth and work into the
leather, allow to be absorbed into the fibers and then buff off the excess.
 You may condition the leather as often as you wish.  The leather will tell
you if you apply too much or apply to often.  The leather fibers will just
not absorb the excess.

If your leather has hardened or needs some intensive softening, there is a
really nifty product called "Surflex Leather Soffener".  This product is made
from natural and synthetic oils that restore the natural softness to
neglected leather.  Clean the leather and then apply a liberal coat of
Soffener.  Allow to penetrate the leather for about 24 hours.  Wipe off the
excess.  If it needs an additional application, repeat the above.  For really
bad areas, cover with plastic and allow to sit for a few days.  Once the
leather is sufficiently softened, allow to "cure" for another 24 hours and
buff off any excess. You are done.  I jokingly say this product will turn a
dog's rawhide chew into a kid glove.  I have had some luck with leather
dashes with this method.  Once the leather has softened, I have been able to
gently tuck it back under the edges of the trim and windshield clips.  This
is a lot cheaper than a new dash and may be worth a try before spending a ton
of money.

If your leather or vinyl has scuff marks, scratches or areas that the surface
color had been removed, you may refinish it yourself  The key is another
Suflex product.  The Suflex Colorant & Finish for Flexible Surfaces may be
matched to the exact color required.  Any interior leather or vinyl surface
may be refinished.  It is not recommended to spot finish any area.  If your
seat bolsters have belt loop scuff marks, you should refinish the entire
front of the seat.  I usually do from welting to welting.  This provides a
visual break that does not make the non refinished areas appear quite as
shabby.  But then why not do the whole seat, dash, or door panel?  Start by
cleaning the area(s) to be refinished with a suitable Organic Solvent.  I
prefer Wurth Citrus Degreaser or P21S Total Auto Wash.  Prior to usage, test
all solvents on an area that does not show.  I use the excess on the
underside of the seat to test colorfastness of the finish.  Spray the solvent
on a soft lint free cloth, and then wipe down the surface(s).  Repeat after a
few minutes.  Rinse with a damp cloth and allow to dry thoroughly (at least
24 hours).  The manufacturer of Surflex says to strip the old finish off
using lacquer thinner, commercial paint remover or C-P Stripper.  I don't,
because most interiors are not in that bad a shape and I have never found it
necessary (They also recommend lightly sanding the area prior to usage, I
don't do that either - no guts).  Mix the Surflex completely and use it like
a wood stain.  I use a small piece of lint free cloth and work the Surflex
into the leather or vinyl just as if I were staining wood.  Once the desired
color of finish is achieved,  allow to dry undisturbed for at least 24 hours.
 I allow the surface to "harden off" for about 2 weeks before applying any
conditioners to leather or vinyl protectants to vinyl parts. I have not had a
lot of luck refinishing a dark leather or vinyl a lighter color.  The old
color tends to show through in small "cracks" and the whole panel seems to be
"muddy".  Maybe if you strip off all the old finish, it would look better.
 Someday, I will get an old seat and give it a try.              

The Surflex Black Colorant works great on black bumpers, black spoilers or
black rubber/vinyl trim that has been scratched or scuffed. Clean the entire
part thoroughly with Wurth Citrus Degreaser, rinse and dry thoroughly.  Stain
the area with the Colorant and allow to dry.  It will look like new.  After
about 3 weeks hardening off, coat with a protective coating of Mequiar #42
Rubber Treatment or Black Again.

Small cuts, cracks or holes in leather may be partially repaired using
another Surflex product called Flex-Fill.  This is a semi-flexible cosmetic
filling material.  You use it like a spackle compound.  It will take the
Surflex colorant similar to leather or vinyl.  I have been able to repair
several damaged areas and hide them so they are not visible to the casual
observer.  Will it make a three inch crack in your dash look like new?  No,
but it may help hide it so that it isn't quite so obvious.  I have found that
forcing Flex-Fill under the repaired area and forming an inverted T patch
works best.  Once the patch is dry, sand lightly to blend in with the leather
or vinyl.  Clean the area thoroughly and refinish with the Surflex Colorant.
 This is a learned skill, so you should practice on a test piece of leather
or vinyl.  Perfect your techniques before you tackle your expensive interior.

Vinyl is the carefully prepared hydes of virgin pampered Arctic Naugas.  Many
Naugas must die to furnish enough material for just one interior panel. 

The dash, door panels, seat backs, and numerous other
interior/exterior trim pieces are usually vinyl.  Vinyl may be viewed as raw
semi-liquid vinyls that are held in place by a solid vinyl "skin" (this
description is for illustration only and not a PhD chemical dissertation ).
The dash and other vinyl parts of your car are constantly bombarded by UV
that breaks down the molecules of the skin, allowing the raw vinyls to escape
(off-gassing).  These free vinyls then may deposit themselves on the glass,
forming a haze that is difficult to remove.  If you have such a haze, it is
probably your dash that has decided to pick up stakes and migrate.  Silicone
based vinyl dressing products do not usually contain UV protectants,
and the silicone may act as a magnifying glass, intensifying the UV
degradation.  Silicone oil may also dissolve the essential oils in the vinyl
skin, hastening the premature formation of cracks in the vinyl skin.  A
quality vinyl protectant will contain a UV protectant and essential oils to
replace lost oils from the vinyl.  These protectants are expensive, so the
K-Mart specials may do more harm than good. Silicone also has very strong
electrostatic attraction which may be considered beneficial in that it will
tend to stay where it is placed, but will also attract every dust particle in
the surrounding three counties.

Any vinyl protectant should be applied to a soft cloth and worked into the
surface.  After a few moments of allowing it to work into the surface, buff
off the excess.  The dash should be treated more often than any other area,
as it is subject to the most severe attack by UV and heat
. 
My personal favorite vinyl protectant is Lexol Vinyex Spray.  This in my
humble opinion has it all.  A very strong UV protectant, essential oils,
anti-static (helps keep dust off) and a soft patina finish.   Harly Polyguard
 - This used to be my favorite, till I lost my heart to Vinylex. Leaves a
touch more shine to the finish than Vinylex.  Somethin' Else - This is the
sister to Black Again.  Has all the right ingredients and people who love it
are died in the wool.  I prefer the Vinylex, but that only a subjective
opinion.  It leaves a "new car" smell.  I think that is why it is not my
favorite.  I am not a fan of artificial smells.  Harly Interior Magic - An
old standby that leaves a lemon scent.  Some people love it.  I don't think a
car should smell like lemons, but that's my opinion and I could be wrong.
 Zymol Vinyl - Another tropical oil product.  Leaves a pina colada smell.
 Diehards will defend this product to the death.  I just think it is to much
$. Meguiar #40 - A great product that cleans and protects.  Does not leave a
slippery finish.  Meguiar #39 - A very strong cleaner.  This should be used
carefully and very infrequently.  It will clean just about anything out of
vinyl.  Must be followed by #40 or other vinyl protectant.  A great cleaner
for plastic Targa tops.  Tony Nancy Rubber/Vinyl Cleaner- I don't recommend
use on the inside.  The smell is a bit much for me (reminds me of dead rats).
 Some people do and swear by it.  Sonax Cockpit Spray - This is a German
product that is designed for German vinyl.  Does a great job, but leaves a
little more shine to the surface than I care for.  There are a gaggle of
users who love it.  Wurth Cockpit Spray - ditto above. Wurth people don't
like Sonax and vice versa.  Formula 303 - This leaves an Armour All type of
high gloss shine to the vinyl.  I personally don't like this type of finish.
 Some people do, so feel comfortable using it.  All of the above products do
not contain silicone.

I hope that the above has shed some light on the subject leather and vinyl
care.  If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to call or write.
 If you can't find the products locally, I stock all of them except the
Formula 303 and would be glad to send a product description/price package by
mail.

Hey Steve,

        I had almost the exact same problem on my '84 944. My problem was
that it would only start to surge for about 10 minutes every 3 months, so
it was hard to track down until it got worse. It turns out the airflow
meter was not reading correctly, and that was causing the problems. A
couple suggestions:

1) if the car was still surging when you disconnected the throttle control
valve sensor, I would count that out.

2) I would check the fuel pressure, but I doubt the pump or a fuel line
blockage is your problem.

3) Carefully check all hoses connecting to the air intake after the airflow
meter (particularly the rings which hold the large black boot that connects
the airflow meter to the throttle body). If these rings are lose they will
let excess air into the engine.

I found that when the car was surging (and anti-surging) that it was
closely related to **change** in the throttle. If I kept my foot on the
accelerator very still at a constant rpm, the engine would run fine. As
soon as I moved my foot (or hit a bump, which would cause my foot to shift
a tiny bit) the engine would surge (a change in throttle = a change in
position on the airflow meter). So, I figured that there was a problem with
the meter because of this. A variable resistor (which is what the airflow
meter seems to be) will wear after a period of time, and the readings from
it will get more sporadic and will jump around instead of having a smooth
progession. Following some very good advice from Kevin Gross (and my own
ideas) I took the black cover off of my airflow meter and bent the little
"wiper" a bit so that it followed a fresh path across the resistive pad.
The car has run fine ever since. I would not recommend doing this unless
you are familliar dealing with electronic devices. I did it beacuse I
wasn't into spending several hundred dollars for a new/rebuilt airflow
meter.

The barn door in the meter could also be hanging up on something, causing
false readings. You will want to look at this by pressing the barn door
back with your fingers (remember though that what may seem like smooth
travel to your fingers may not be for the air collum that has to keep the
meter open).

In any case, I hope this helps.

Subject: Beware of HRE Wheels!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fellow Porschephiles:

I recently had a disasterous mail-order experience with HRE Performance Wheels 
of Vista California.  I liked the look of their wheels from an ad in 
Excellence and ordered a set at over $3000.  That's where the nightmare 
begins:

(1)  I was initially promised delivery within three weeks.  I didn't receive 
the wheels for over 2 months.  They were then sent to my home, instead of to 
the address of my mechanic, where I asked that they be sent.

(2)  The wheels were sent with the wrong center caps (chrome instead of GPX 
white), and the center caps protruded from the wheel as opposed to the way 
they appeared in pictures they sent me in which they were machined flush with 
the wheel.  When I discussed this with HRE, they told me that "different 
center caps have a different fit" and that if I wanted them to look like they 
did in the picture, I would have to send the 4 wheels back to California for 
lathe machining.

(3)  After a couple of months on my car, the valve stems in 2 of the 4 wheels 
began to leak leading to flat tires, and requiring that I send the wheels back 
to HRE.

(4)  Since I had to send the wheels back to HRE for the valve stem repair, I 
asked that they fix the faulty center caps so they would appear as they did in 
the literature they had sent me. They told me I would have to pay for this.  
They didn't even offer to pay the shipping to get the valve stems repaired 
even though the wheels were still under warranty and less than 3 months old.

(5)  I didn't get the wheels back for 2 months.  Then they sent back the 
wheels, but didn't send back the tires.  I still haven't gotten my tires 
back!!!!!

(6)  The people at HRE have been rude, discourteous and obnoxious.  I had to 
threaten to reverse credit card charges to get any service at all.

In summary,  this has been the worst mail order experience of my life.  I've 
ordered Porsche parts and equipment from numerous companies and have never had 
problems like this.  If I could turn back the clock.......needless to 
say.....I'd order from elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!

A big thanks to;

Let's see if I got it right,.....

Mechanichal Tensioners; ...unless you're racing your car, or have a 
super-mint pre hydraulic tensioner show car seeing about 0 (ZERO) miles a 
year, you better think twice......(...at *least* twice, actually keep on 
thinking 'till mechanichal tensioners are as hard (and expensive) to find as

Hydraulic Tensioners; ...in contrary to good wine their usefulness is the 
inverted of their fabrication date (relative that is). If you got to have 
them, you should get the '80-'84 model (maybe 930 models too) tensioners, 
and do use the chain tensioner clamps that are sold aftermarket.

Pressure Fed system;...this is the way to go, pre '84 stuff, fits all and 
every 911 engine after approx. '68, they will also fit the engines back to 
'65 with some more modifications to the oil lines/covers.

That's about it,.....thanks.

Subject: Beware of HRE Wheels? Opposite Experience!


We here in Delaware have had the opposite experience.

Gene at HRE has been extreemly flexible with regard to fittments.  3 of
us ordfered three sets of 9, 9.5 and 10.5, 11, and 11.5 x 17" wheels
for our turbo bodied 911 cars.

The first set I ordered had the wrong offset in the rear.  I called and
asked, and asked that while they were at it they widen the fronts by
1/2" (to 9.5") on my set only, and they the offset on the rear be
changed by 1", with 1/2" added to the inside half.  They did this and
paid return shipping, plus shipped the second and third sets within a
week. 

They also sent the first set along for fitment, and made changes to the
two other orders to accomodate differences in suspension and flare
width (amazing how much differenc between an early car fited with
pre-89 flares and a late car fitted with 89 on flares).

The entire transaction took about 4 weeks, from order to final
delivery of all sets.

We all paid "a lot" less (sworn to secrecy on the racer program), and
all skipped the center caps to save money.

They were good on the phone, and returned calls promptly.  I plan to
order another set for the street, now that I've sold almost all of my
original 6 sets of wheels.

Maybe the Carrera 4 sss needs a special fitment.  My RSR 3.4 was pretty
close off the rack.

Subject: Re:HRE Wheels- Counterpoint

Sorry to hear about your experience with HRE. I, also, bought some wheels
from them and found them cooperative and prompt. They also did some research
for me so that I could fit oversize wheels on my car. When I received the
wheels, with custom offset, they fit perfectly.
I also think that they were reasonably priced, compared to all other wheels
that I shopped. It's hard to imagine how you spent $3000 on 4 wheels when I
spent about $730 for two 10 x 17 forged wheels. Of course this was with a
racer's discount. (HINT) They will give you a huge discount if you let them
know that you are using them on the track and that you are willing to wear
their decal.
I certainly hope that you resolve your problems and that for some reason your
experience is an isolated one.

Yes, my clutch has been replaced.  Once during a prior life, and once
last spring shortly after I purchased the car.  I replaced with a
complete F&S package (TO bearing, p-plate, clutch plate, flywheel
w/all new bolts and hardware plus a new cable).  I adjusted it
carefully according to the Haynes manual (in chap 11 I think for
later models) at the time, checked it again just before and just
after my track session last month (about 8k on the clutch by then).
It appeared perfect.

Whats the story on these bushings I keep hearing about ?

There is a new place opening up in Redmond, WA called Speed Ware

have a catalog yet, so you may not get better service if you called right

I had a 1986 928 with pearlescent leather interior - which became 
YELLOWescent in a year, and snowflakes a year after that.  I used 
Color Plus products to restore the interior.  They matched the color ( not 
the pearl finish, though), and I used the leather conditioner first before 
dying the leather.  It worked great.  I initially made the mistake of 
using an airbrush to apply the finish, until I realized that it is a dye,

6 each Bosch electric radio antennas. Self erecting as it were.
They are unused but a bit grimey from 10 years in the basement.

It looks like all the mounting hardware is there with 4 of them

Also, I found an Engelhard catalytic converter. It has 2" inlet and outlet.
It looks like it came of a stationary engine with a vertical stack as it
has one of those hinged rain sheilds on one end. The element is replaceable
although the one in place looks O.K. It is approximately 7" OD by 14" long
including end pieces. Center piece holding the element is approx. 6"x6"dia.

I don't suppose I could argue with that (did I say that, crusty of fart that

Subject: 928 belt tension

Hi all,

	I recently purchased a 87 928s4 (my dream car) with 61 K miles
	on it.  I had it checked out initially by a mechanic - there were
	a few small things, but it looked to be in really good shape.

	A problem came up the first time I really tried to accellerate 
	quickly: the belt tension light came on.  I immediately pulled over, 
	shut off the car and when I put it back on, it was out.  I've been 
	driving it for the past few days, but it's obviously concerning.
	I have no record of the belt being done and I know it's generally 
	done at around 60 K miles.  The records of maintenance are incomplete 
	for the last 20K miles.

	Has this happened to anyone out there?  Is it safe to be driving
	it before I replace it?  I'm trying to get a feel for whether it's
	something that happens to 928s or if it's a dangerous thing.  I
	know the consequences are severe for a broken belt so I don't want
	to take any chances - I plan to fix it in the next week or so.

	Also, I was planning on doing this myself, just not so soon as I won't
	have the manuals for a few weeks.  I've done timing belts on other 
 	cars, so I'm not a total novice to it.  Having read the Chilton's 
	manual, two of the four cams are driven by the belt and two by a 
	chain in the back, so alignment shouldn't be too bad.

	Is there a way to check the condition of the belt without removing the
	cover (via a hole or something)?  

	Are there special tools required to do it?  

	Is it recommended to replace the water pump at the same time?


TIA for any help or advice,

Chuck Olson

Subject: ?911 C4 1990 Brake&Diff Light Stay On

If my 1990 911 C4 sits for more than, say, 8 hours - when it is first 
started the "Brake" and "Differential/Drive Train" warning lights stay on 
for about a minute or until the car is moved 10 feet or so.

Figured it was low brake fluid (b/c I think both the brakes & diffs use 
the same reservoir) but it seems Ok.  I figure it is probably just 
needing to build up pressure.  Any thoughts?

Could there be water/air in a line somewhere?

Will the hex head bolts on the other side of the heat exchanger
cylinder flanges give me as much trouble?  I am considering ordering
that special hex tool which extends through the heat exchanger and
into the hex head bolt for ease of removal.  Does anyone have experience
or hints in how to unstick these nuts and bolts?  I tried some torch

Subject: Rubbing tire on 911SC

My (relatively new to me) 1979 911SC has an annoying problem. The right
(passenger) front tire, when sharply turned to the right or left, rubs
slightly against a vertically oriented cylindrical object mounted on the rear
of the wheel well, making a groaning noise. I'm guessing that this thing is
some kind of pump. I can see that two hoses run to it, but without getting it
off the ground it's hard to see where they go, and I can't figure out from my
Haynes manual what it could be. Is it something to do with the air
conditioning? 

The front wheels are 7x16 Fuchs. Is this the stock size? The tires are
Pirelli Cinturato P7s, which I was given to understand is a popular choice.
What's goofy here? Do I need lower profile tires? Should the wheels be
smaller? Or is something else out of whack?

Folks,

In fairness to Linda and Carlsens, from whom I have not had the opportunity 
to purchase anything, I should point out that the margin varies with the 
type of part,  i.e., rotors will have bigger margins and a bigger discount 
can be had, if the dealer is willing.  On other parts, ANY discount will put 
it at what the dealer might consider basement margin for operations and PCA 
discount = Internet discount = Joe Beer Can Off the Street discount.

I did call Linda looking for a dash, and although she couldn't provide me 
with the part, she gave me the name/phone of the person who bought the last 
one available from PCNA.

FWIW.

Trond,
  I beleive that in order to use a pressure fed system in the 2.0ltr motors
(at least mine). I would need to change the cam tower and the covers. No 
problem with my 66 as far as oil sprayer is concerned, the lines are there.
The problem lies in the fact that the cover is diffrent from the later 
motors. Not super sure that the cam tower is up-datable, but would be 
necessary in order to fit new style covers. Even the lower valve covers are 
diffrent in the older cars (no 930 cover upgrade available;-).

I didn't mention this before, but my car does not list the 474 option

It's starting to sound like that.  It probably has to do with what time of the
year the car was built.  I know of a couple of '87 951s without airbags,
but all of the literature I've read says that all '87+ 951s came with 
airbags standard...

Subject: 914 2nd gear synchro going or is it op error?

Porsche-pholks,

When the PO had my 1.7 engine rebuilt, he/she apparently swapped in a '72 
transmission.  Ugh.  Questions follow re: what to do now, and what to do for 
the future.

1]  Downshifting from 3 to 2 is grind city, unless I'm going < 30mph.  Anything 
over 30, no dice.  From what I can tell, 2nd takes me up to at least 33+ mph 
before I upshift to 3.  So why can't I downshift at 33 mph or so?  This makes 
coming into a turn a crapshoot.  More often than not, I end up riding through 
it in neutral.  Is this a double-clutch or bring the rpms up before going for 
it thing?  No problems at all downshifting 3 to 2 under 30 mph.

2]  Is it a really bad idea to downshift 4 to 2 sometimes?  (not that I can, 
currently)  I've always been under the impression that (when street driving) 
slowing down with your brake pads is cheaper than with your transmission.

3]  Someone mentioned a few days ago that the front engine mount was modified 
between 72 and 73 for the side shifter set up.  Mine needs welding, currently, 
but given that I now have (supposedly) a 72, and won't be able to upgrade back 
to a '73 for a year or so, can I fix it such that it will work for now but 
won't require rework for the side shifter trans?

Well, that's it for now.
TIA for advice.  Thwen.

overnight.  Water wouldn't clean it up and I didn't want to scratch - but 
this stuff worked pretty well.  It will remove wax also according to the can.
I just used a clean rag dipped in it and wiped it slightly - no problem -
came right off without damaging the car paint.

Of course, you'll have to rewax the area you removed the wax from.

From: "RADSICKT" <radsickt@lablink.ple.af.mil>
Subject: 914 Axle Nut + VW Engine Rebuild Book Comment

 Greeting,
 
 Regarding the recent question on the 914 Axle Nut, I present my experiences....
 
 I decided to pull entire half-shaft while doing engine rebuild.  Why?  Hmmm... 
 As Stan hinted, perhaps I shouldn't have done so, but my intention is to 
 install new rear wheel bearings in an attempt to make the old car new again.  
 The whole process is a little more complicated than I had hoped.  Anyway, first 
 attempt was with an average, everyday Craftsman 1/2" breaker bar. Stood on it 
 and sort of jumped. No dice.  P-Phile suggestion #1 said use big-*ss pipe 
 wrench on a short 1/2" extention supported by a jackstand.  I liked the 
 innovative, Rube-Goldberg solution but my big-*ss pipe wrench would never bite 
 onto the extention.  P-Phile suggestion #2 said to get a Ubangi: a piece of 
 black iron with a 30mm six-sided closed end wrench-like hole for the nut, a 
 1/2" square hole for a breaker bar and a large hammer pad for a hammer.  
 Process is to put steady pressure on the nut with th ebreaker bar and then 
 hammer on the pad to add some impact force.  Ubangis are available form all the 
 local VW folks, most likely, and I bet these things work really well, but I 
 never did find a local guy.  P-Phile suggestion #3 was to use an impact wrench. 
  I bought one for use on the rusty triumph GT6, so I figured I'd give it a 
 shot.  Nope -- not enought guts.  Then again, not a double impact IR.  
 Penultimate P-Phile suggestion: Use a really long cheater pipe on the Craftsman 
 breaker bar.  With the extra 3' of pipe, I was able to dind out more about the 
 grain structure of the Craftman tool steel than I would have liked.  In other 
 words -- neato catastrophic Fast Fracture! Final P-Phile Suggestion:  Get a 
 better breaker bar.  SO I went and plunked down the $50 required to get a 1/2" 
 breaker bar made by Armstrong and combined with the cheater pipe and gradual, 
 steady force application the nuts came loose!  Of course only one stub axle 
 decide to come free despite lots of hammering....
 
 
 Now, regarding the VW engine rebuild book by Tom Wilson (?):  I have it and I 
 agree that for the most part it is good.  On the other hand, I was warned about 
 a few possible suggestions by Mr. Wilson that uh...how should I put this... 
 well, they aren't universally accepted as being correct.  They are:
 
 Ease of removing engine and tranny vs removing them separately:  I believe he 
 states somewhere that it is easier to remove each separately but then also 
 shows how to remove as a unit.  I'm pretty sure it was in this book....
 
 Use of sealant on pushrod tube O-rings:  I believe that he suggests using 
 Permatex 3H or equiv. on the O-rings -- I have always heard that it is better 
 to install them dry, allowing more movement to ease thermal expansion mismatch 
 problems.
 
 Start-Up procedure:  He suggests using the spin-the-engine-over- with-the- 
 starter-until-the-oil-pressure- comes-up-and-then-hook-up- 
 the-coil-wire-so-that- it-runs method.  Stan (correct me if I am wrong) also 
 suggests this, so it may be a good idea but I have heard that it is not a good 
 one.  On the other hand, the only option presented to me was to presurize the 
 system with an extermal oiler.
 
 
 Now a couple of questions:
 
 Case sealant: What Kind?  Curil K2 (my old favorite)?  Permatex Orange (I guess 
 that's what Porsche uses)?
 
 O-Ring Seals:  Regular or Viton?
 
 Start-Up procedure:  When spinning with the starter to build oil pressure, 
 should the plugs also be removed?

Yes, at least on the '86 there is a peep hole under the drivers side

visible damage, etc, but I doubt you will see any stretch marks.

I've had to deal with many rusty bolts in the past and very tight 
ones as well.  What I have found to work well is this:

Use a 1/2" socket wrench with 1/2" sockets.  From your local plumbers 
shop or Home depot purchase one of those long black steel pipes that 
fit snuggly over the handle of your 1/2" socket wrench.   The pipe I 
have is about 2' long but you can try longer or shorter ones.  Mine 
cost $4.00.  I now have an air compressor but I still use my pipe 
method 'cause is quicker than setting up the compressor.  I found 
this method with even pressure will open almost any nut. 


BTW any porschephile who wants to borrow my air compressor in the 
Baltimore area is welcome to do so.  It's a 5hp 220V Sears.

Dear Michael:
The 944S2 is probably a 1987, and the 911C2 is a 1990.  I think that the 
condition of the car that you are looking for, and personal preference, 
are most important, because the cars are probably equally reliable.  The 
911 will certainly be more expensive to maintain.  My guess is that a 
mechanic who has no familiarity with Porsche will probably have an easier 
time with the 944 than the 911, but I think that getting the car repaired 
will be difficult either way.  

Do they still drive around those plastic cars in Israel?  And Mercedes Taxis
with wind-up windows?

Subject: Queer Ride Height 


P-philes,

As my 914 saga continues(fast approaching powertrain installation - yes!), I
am concerned about the current ride height.  The ride height is significantly 
lower on the drivers side front than it is on the rest of the car.  As a 
result, by visual inspection, it seems to "tilt" toward the drivers side.

I made some actual measurements and the driver's side front sits about 1"
lower than the left.  Although there may be a similiar problem in the rear, 
it is not as pronouced as in the front of the car.

Since getting the car, I've been in it, on it, under it, etc. and have not
noticed anything glaringly obvious.  The longitudinals are in fine shape
(re-enforced by PO) and rust damage is confined to non-structural areas.

Someone suggested to me that it may be the torsion bar up front that is the
culprit.  If so, how do I go about inspecting it?  Is it somehow located
under the A-arm?  I didn't notice it visually, but I didn't hunt for it 
extensively either.

The car has adjustible perch shocks in the rear, original boge struts up front
with indeterminate inserts.  In general, what controls ride height on most
P-cars?

Thanks in advance for any information y'all may have in your heads...

} Curious, my 89 951 serial number is 151269 -
} this seems to indicate it was the #1269th built.

The list above counts the number imported into the states. The
worldwide count is much greater. I am assuming that there is
just one count for all destinations in the VIN.

} I also thought there were a lot fewer 88 Turbo S's built.
} I heard there were 700 and 399 imported to the USA.

There were also non-S turbos made in '88, I believe, so
the above count most likely includes all varieties.

Tried-and-true worn syncromesh problems[and I've been with you in the car 
watching you "hunt" for 1st and 2nd].  Time to have the transmission 
rebuilt.  Most probably new 1st gear, maybe 2nd, new syncros.  Just hope
that your ring and pinion is in good shape; I hear its a good 10 hours
of labor for ring and pinion work since alignment is crucial and tolerances
are so tight.

New pads are cheaper than transaxle repair.  It may be tough on your clutch
to use the transaxle as a brake, especially if you get the RPM jump, body
slam into seat-belt effect.

The physical mounts(part of the chassis) remained the same for the 914.  The
insert engine and transimission mounts changed design(went to solid in 
later years - less expensive to replace).  The only issue of concern in your
case(I believe) is the engine mounting bar itself.  When the 914 changed over
to the side-shift transaxle, the mounting bar was redesigned to permit the
shifter linkage to pass through.  This wasn't a problem on the earlier 
914s since the shifter linkage passed under the bar and attached to the 
bottom end of the transaxle.

Fabrication to shore up rust damaged engine mounts(on chassis) will not 
affect your options as far as motor mounts, engines or transaxle selection
is concern.  That is, if it is done properly.

As did the E's.  The T's had 140 hp, the E's 160 (170?) and the S's 190,

Subject: RE: Unsticking stuck heat exchanger bolts.


Bummer.  I, unfortunately, had the not-so-pleasant experience of pulling 
heat exchangers off of my 73 when I bought it.  It had been parked for 10 
years.  I broke 6, even after soaking the sh*t out of them.

I used a torch, and it helped get the others out.  Get it really hot, but 
try not to heat the stud.

Use the hex tool, which can be had from Snap-On or Mac as well.  Actually, I 
think the Snap-On tool was a bit short, which must be why I bought the Mac.

You may break more.  That's just life, I guess.  Pendergrass Tools USED to 
sell a very cool jig (I got the last one!)for drilling out the old studs and 
and threading for Time-Serts, which you will be using as an insert for your 
new studs now.  Great product.

Wurth makes an anti-sieze product called CU-200, or something like that (I'm 
at work so I don't have access to it presently) and it's copper-based. 
 Works really well.  I've pulled the exchangers off after using this and 
experienced no problems.  Wish the last guy had used it.

If you need more specific info, email me directly.

Steve,

I suspect that object is the receiver/dryer for your A/C.  If there's room, 
you could move it slightly.

My 73 had the same problem, except it rubbed one of the hoses.  The former 
owner had a great story about what happened when it finally abraded through!

Subject:      Head gasket?...


Recently I turned my 1980 928 over to a kind mechanic to do a pre-track
inspection.  To my surprise he told me that the car had no major
problems, only a slightly leaky head gasket.  He said that it would be
fine for a while and only $150 to fix it when I wanted to.  Not having
$150 to spare, I told him I'd do it later.  This weekend I went to the
track and had a great time- I am amazed at the 928's performance (I
can't believe it's 15 years old!).  However, I had one very scary
experience:  On the straight I was passing another car and had the tach.
needle just up into the red before I was going to shift.  I looked into
the rear view mirror to see if it was clear to get back over and saw a
BIG cloud of smoke!  It was coming from my tailpipe!  I have seen this
in my rear view mirror before, but not smoke this dense and abundant.
As I let offthe gas it slowly tapered off and,to make a long story
short, was fine for the rest of the day (I did not take it to red ever
again!)  My instructor said that it was the leak in the head gasket
letting a little bit of oil into the combustion chamber.  He said that
when oil ignites it creates a big cloud like my car did.  Does this
sound right?  If I fix the head gasket should that take care of the
puffs of smoke I see in the rear view mirror when accelerating hard?  Or
does this have nothing to do with a leaking head gasket?  This is
probably the most important post I have ever put to the list(for me!),
so could I get more than a 2 replies even though I'm a 928?  :)
Thanks in advance, Sean

Porschephiles,

This last Friday I found myself sitting behind a pickup pulling a
trailor while waiting at the west bound ticket booth for I-70 at 
Kansas City.  On the trailor was a VW race car.  In bright yellow
letters across the hatch it said, "Wabbit Wacing".  I found it
fairly humorous.  I assumed he was headed to Heartland Park, but
I don't know for sure.
