Hella recently have their H4 conversion kit DOT-approved - probably 
just by sticking on the three teats that are on the US headlights. 
Nowhere does the box say H4, it calls them HB2s. The kit is called Hella 
Vision Plus, and it's in a yellow and purple box. The bulbs ARE H4s... 
Philips, to be exact. It comes with 55/60s, which I assume are the max 
allowed by law.

I wouldn't be surprised to see them available in the parts store designed 
for the "unwashed masses", ie Nat'l Auto and Pep Boys. ;)

I just put a set in my 914, haven't really driven it at night yet, but they 
seem super-bright. (I plan on putting in some 55/100 watters soon.)

Most spedometer repair shops that specialize in VDO will recalibrate your

roll the car for a small but exact number of tire revolutions and carefully
count the cable shaft revolutions. Armed ith this data they change the gears

Subject: Suspension travel

Hello

        Anybody know how to measure suspension travel on a 911?  After
removing wheels, shocks, and disconnecting anti-roll bars, it's easy to
measure full droop (=max rebound); the trick is to get an accurate (and
precise) measure of rebound (=max compression).  I have the car on jack
stands and started jacking up the front suspension until I started lifting
the car off the stands.  Seemed like the right thing to do until I realized
that I couldn't get the same reading twice and my measurements varied 3-5
cm from side-to-side (should be within a couple mm!).  Same results with
the rear suspension.  The problem is the subjective call on when all of the
suspension travel is used up and you start lifting the car.  Short of
putting the tub on the garage floor, I haven't a clue what to do next.  Any
suggestions?

Much thanks in advance

I just bought a 914 that was just painted and has no polish or wax on it.
What should I put on it? I don't know what kind of paint or clearcoat was
used, but I can find out from the previous owner. I've got One Grand polish
and wax (carnauba). Should I use that? Is there something you're supposed to
do differently with a fresh paint job? I'd like as glossy a finish as
possible. As you can probably tell, I know next to nothing about paint,
polish and wax, so please don't hesitate to mention anything that may seem

sure your local alignment shop has the knowhow to properly set up your car.
If you ever plan to take your 911/930 to top speed, you better have some

Considering that the fuel weighed about 150 lbs. ( much like having anouther

the car low on feul and take on a passenger to see if you get the same
result.

Ahhh, but the large size parts fiche does not fit in the viewers at my
public library. Doesn't even fit in the local microfiche shop's viewers.
None the less they managed to print the 928 parts fiche for only $43. 
The quality sucks, its barely readable. But at least its not on the curly 
paper the library uses.

Maybe its not readable as I purchased a 1985 reverse gear set for my 1983 
by mistake. Found out too late for refund. Nice $500 paper weights.
Anyone interested in a new set of reverse gears for a 928 5-speed? Exact
part number available on request.

My 928 manual set (8 volumes) cost $250 and is easily my best purchase
to-date.

Have you checked out the Euroselect catalog? Its got exploded diagrams of 
probably at least 95% of all the parts you would ever want to replace on 
a 944/928 up to '88 model year. Its also got all the factory part numbers

I now have reservations about removing the sprocket. I guess my question 
now is what are the drawbacks if I don't get this leak fixed? Will 
anything be starved of lube or is it simply a case of a little harmless 
oil leak (as long as it doesn't fall on hot or rubber parts).
 
Right now, I've wrapped a rag around the leak and this seems to control 
it fine. I don't  have to replace the rag more than once a year after it 
becomes soaked. I'd like to continue this practice if there's no harm to 
the engine.

Thanks for the tip. I've been a bit out of touch with my Porsche lately
and haven't bought any parts in a couple of years. Pre-Euroselect days.

When I had my transmission apart I went thru at least 2 sets of manual
copies, and 3 sets of copies of the transmission section of the parts
fiche. Plenty of dayglow yellow highlighter. And a 2 page Excel 
spreadsheet for locating the parts.

well, I was out picking up chinese and my top broke.

At first the top came back unevenly (meaning the right side was halfway
back before the left side started). I tried to stop there and put it back
up but it won't go so I decided I might as well put it all the way down and
deal with it at home easier then the resturant. The top never went all the
way down and I'm sure something broke in there because I put a little
pressure (like I mean a little) and the top just fell down the rest of the
way.

My concern is not how to fix it (I'll have the shop do it.) I just need to

If paint is less than 3 months old do not use any on it yet. And only 
was with clean cool water. I use zymol on all my cars. More exp to start 
with but not in the long run as wax goes farther. You use a lot less.

Subject: Porsche life in Salt Lake City

George Shea asked about Life After Chicago re: proposed move to Salt Lake
City.  I'm considered a newbie, having moved here in Nov. '90 (to be
considered rooted here, your ancestors have to have arrived by oxcart in 1847
with Brigham Young).  My comments, FWTW:

1. After 17 years in Minnesota, winter here is a cakewalk, and it's actually
warm enough to permit skiing at the 8 or 9 major downhill ski areas near the
city.

2. While there is less auto rust here than in MN, they do put *prodigious*
amounts of salt on the streets, sidewalks, parking lots, barrom floors, cats,
etc.

3. THEREFORE if you drive your car in the winter, it needs meticulous
attention to prevent cancer.

4. The combination of winter freeze/thaw cycles and blazing summer desert sun
beats the asphalt to S--T, so watch your alloys.  My 944 has cost me a few
fillings, but fortunately no wheels yet.

5. The mountain and high valley roads east of SLC are heavenly for the
Porsche driver (and the Porsche)-- highly recommended.  And in the southern
part of the state are some of the most highly-rated driving and sightseeing
roads on the planet, less than 4-5 hrs away.

6. The straight desert roads west of the city cry out for license-lifting
pedal-pushing.  In Nevada, not too far off, is the biannual open (legal)
high-speed solo race-- classes up to 140 mph or more, I read.

7. The PCA is very active in the unsalted months, with several slaloms,
tours, and parties.  I've only been to a few things, but folks seem friendly
and accepting.  As usual, I think the more you invest w/ them, the more
you'll get back.

8. Come take a look, and you won't leave the land of Saints (and Sinners,
possibly the more interesting inhabitants).

Subject: Help for my mechanic

Greetings:

One of the first things I try to do with  new 944 owners is educate them in
the importance of belt maintenance.  I do this with a display of previously
removed valves.  (The "S" shaped ones have the best impact.)  Along with
these I have a cllection of belts.  Some with missing teeth, some oil soaked,
some broken.  Also have a variety of pulleys in varying stages of failure.
 With this and the mention of "$1500 to $2000"  the point is usually made.

The customer brought the car in for oil leak repair and when they were
repaired, felt he had been ripped off?  The cost of the cam belt is so
insignificant in the context of the repairs made it's laughable.  If the
customer maintained this attitude after a careful, detailed explanation of
the potential repurcussions of not replacing a belt in this condition,  your
mechanic would probably be better off without him.  I wonder what the
customers response would have been if your mechanic had *not* replaced the
oil soaked belt and it had failed.

A *good* customer, one who's truly interested in the health and well being of
his p-car, would have been grateful the mechanic saved him from a much more
serious problem.  Of course if he hadn't spent that $15.00 or $20.00 on the
belt he probably could have bought a set of curb feelers or perhaps something
really important like a couple of new 8-track tapes.

On a more serious note, no repair shop owner likes to think a customer is
unsalvagable, but it seems this one might take a bit of work.  Perhaps your
mechanic should put this customer in touch with a previous victim of "belt
neglect".  Usually conversation with someone who's "been there, done that"
get's the point across.

A friend gave me an old set of 914 fiches that he "liberated" from a
dealer. I don't have a reader and don't plan to get one so here's what I did:

	-the fiche is printed in columns. If you cut it into strips 2
columns wide, can read them on a standard microfiche strip reader.

	-our local college has the latest type of microfiche reader which 
rotate the image and zoom in/out.

	-I set up the pages the way I wanted, which was 2 diagrams/2 parts
list per letter sized page and printed them at 10 cents a copy. The result
was quite readable, except for the scratches on the fiche itself. If you
have new fiche, this wouldn't be a problem.

As far as cutting up the fiche goes, I sure wasn't going to use it as is,
and they are hardly collectible (although I could be wrong here...) so I
didn't feel too bad cutting them up.

My question concerns too low idle of my '83 944. When the car is
cold the idle is around 400 rpms and the motor dies quite 
frequently. When the motor gets to it operating temperature the
idle raises to about 600 but is still very rough. I have new
plugs, air and fuel filter, and I have inspected the wires,
rotor and distribitor cup, but these seem to be OK (or have I
missed something). I know there is a idle controller somewhere
there, but how could I inspect if its defective? Also other

Subject: Re: Polishes/Waxes

OK, though my mechanical expertise is limited, (but expanding every
week........for 25 years! When do I become knowledgeable?) I do know
something about maintaining a paint finish - any paint finish.  My 914 has
won over 35 concours 1st places, including 2 Parades, primarily because of
its finish and luster.  There is not a treatment I haven't tried over the
years, unless it's under 6 months old.

My experience indicates that (get this), usually, the easiest is the best!  I
have a preference for Meguiars products, but others work just as well- if,
you wash you're car frequently.  No wax stands up to frequent washing (notice
the word WAX).  So, wax it frequently with a reputable wax.  Never, ever,
POLISH your car unless you have dead paint.  If,you'd like to discuss dead
paint, e-mail me.  In fact, if you can avoid it, never POLISH your car.
 Treat it properly when washing, wax it frequently, remove dead wax every
couple of years, and your finish will last 20 years or more!

Moreover, I never touch my concours car with a power buffer!  I do use one on
my other car, but my 914 gets waxed with bare hands (i.e., wax applicator is
my bare hand - no rags).  I'm an Aaccountant, so my hand are soft; my 911
keeps them dirty! I do not waste money on expensive trade names - they wash
off as quickly as J-Wax.  The key is taking care of your Porsche when you
wash it ( another topic).

Please, do not waste your $$$ on Zymole(sp intentional) or other cash crows
(sp intentional).  Not necessary - wash your Porsche properly, WAX it
frequently, polish it infrequently, and drive it.  Don't let it become the
museum pice that I have!

Palo Alto Speedometer asked that cars be rolled for a distance of 52 feet 9
1/2 inches or so, which is 1/100 mile (5280/100 = 52.8 ft = 52 ft 9.6 in).
 
I suppose you could estimate fractions of a turn well enough, but I did mine
a different way. I have test equipment that measures true road speed. I can
also clip an inductive pickup to the coil wire to get engine rpm. From the
engine rpm and known gear ratios, I can get tire revs per minute in top
gear. From the observed speed, I can get miles per minute. Dividing
one by the other gives tire revs per mile. I programmed the equipment to
calculate this internally and print it out every time a button was pushed. So
I just went out onto the freeway, drove along for a few miles, pushing the
button maybe half a dozen times at 60, 70, 80 indicated, and averaged the
results. They were all surprisingly close to each other, +/- 1 rev
per mile. I reported that back to Palo Alto Speedometer, they redid my
speedo, I checked it on the road and it's within 1 mph all across the range.
 
Doing this by rolling the car would have required me to be able to read
tenths of a turn of the speedo cable. I suppose that's doable. Maybe make a
round card marked off in degrees or 1/10 turn (36 degree) segments, tape it
to the speedo cable housing, make a pointer out of a paper clip or such, and
roll the car 1/100 mile.

Sounds like a vacuum leak.  The idle controller on a 1983 944 is merely 
an auxiliary air valve, similar to those used on Bosch CIS cars.  Probably
not the problem.

The rag isn't as bad as it sounds. It is tightly wound around the 
junction between the rear sprocket cover and cylinder head. It is made of 
surgical gauze and there are no loose ends.
 
BTW, I insulated my manifold by wrapping fiberglass insulation sandwiched 
by aluminum foil around each pipe. This has REALLY reduced the heat in 
that area and so far I haven't noticed any ill effects. The manifold is 
the steel-pipe header type, not cast. Any reson why this might be bad for 
the car?

Subject: Re: repost: questions re polish & wax (urgent)

David,

Mike Willis is correct in his precaution to NOT wax your car.  Wait at least 
three months (sometimes more) before using any product called WAX on your 
car (unless you know *specifically* that your car has a laquer job which is 
unlikely).  Although a new paint job feels "dry" to the touch it takes many 
weeks for the finish to "cure" and fully complete the chemical reaction 
which causes the paint to "harden".  You can use polish (those not 
containing any wax or "space age" polymers) and/or rubbing compounds on the 
finish during this curing period without harming the finish, but you should 
not need to as long as the car was properly painted (once again, assuming it 
is not laquer).  I strongly caution anyone using a machine buffer (on any 
car)  who does not have adequate experience.   When the time comes to wax 
your car, stick with a good quality carnauba wax and avoid the "space age" 
products.  I like Meguire's, but there are many high-quality brands.

Good Luck
Andy

Hi,
	Well although I didn't qualify on your list, I have done a lot of work on 
all types of cars.  Your mechanic's customer should sell his Porsche and by a 
bicycle.  I would state categorically that anyone who is too cheap to replace his 
timing belt (a less than $20 item) when the belt is removed for repair work 
anyway, does not deserve a Porsche.
	Oil impregnation will affect the belt, and your mechanic was absolutely 
right to replace it even if it had been renewed a week before the repair.
	Regarding the seals, They come in the form of kits usually, so Tim would 
have another problem if he had not replaced all the seals that came in the kit - 
undoubtedly another reason for cries of "rip-off" from the customer.  Sounds like 
this customer will never be pleased, no matter what Tim does...
	Suggest that Tim could have replaced one seal at a time until the leaks 
stop, but made sure the labor is charged every time, AND make the customer pick 
the seals that he wants replaced. THAT should shut him up.  On the other hand... 
Maybe not.  A total waste of time, this customer sounds like a complete **&hole.  
Hope this will help Tim, show it to the customer if you like, and give him my 
email address if he wants a follow up discussion.  Having been in this situation 
myself, it really winds me up.  Guess what would have happened if Tim hadn't 
changed the belt and it snapped in 5000 miles?
Good luck,   Jan

Ummmm. You gotta define "performance" here. The car will accelerate and

This will make *EXACTLY* **ZERO** more horsepower. It will just *feel*

The car becomes significantly more difficult to drive in traffic. It won't
"maintain" as well, since when you let off the gas, the revs just drop
straight to low idle, no waiting. You have to adopt a very different
driving style as a result.

You can also get it too light, and have the flywheel go "boom", which can
be simply catastrophic. Remember, it's storing a huge amount of 
rotational energy...

The *BEST* thing to do is get all of the "moving parts" that go on 
the crankshaft balanced at one time. Everything gets staticly and
dynamically balanced then. Final test is assembly as a unit and dynamic
balnance as a unit.

No clue. Look in the Yellow Pages under "machine shops". It's helpful if
they've done this before. It's *VERY* helpful if they've done this for
either air-cooled VWs or Porsches -- a lot.

Subject: Roadside Help

Many years ago,  when I joined the 356 Registry (which I have since left), a
movement was made to gather a listing of similarly-bent members from around
the country for area assistance when trouble reared its ugly head.  It was a
good idea, since these folks were diehards and would help anyone.

Just a thought - why not create such a group within P-philes?  It doesn't
matter what type of Porsche one drives, it's still the Marque.  Gather a list
of those who are willing to lend moral, technical, or directional support to
those who have problems while traveling in the repective area(s) with a
Porsche.  Publish the list each month, with the rest of the FAQ's and such.

I'm willing to head up the list, and upload each month.  The last thing I
want is to be stranded with a '73 911 or '72 914 in some area where Porsches
are unique, at best.  Would be nice to be able to call a friend, even if 100
miles away, for assisatnce in finding the right shop or tools to make an
emergency fix.

What about it - any takers?  Stan, Bart, etc., what do you guys think?

Subject: Belt rollers for 944


Well, today I took all the belts off the car and removed the rollers. All 
roll smoothly and can easily be spun with a flick of the finger (not good 
according to my parts guy). The new one he showed me seemed tight when 
you tried to turn it.
 
All 4 rollers (cam, balance idlers and tensioners) seem to exhibit a tiny 
bit of play when rocked sideways. Is any sideways play acceptable?
 
Since I'm most likely gonna have to buy new rollers, I wondering 
whether there are bad ones (poorer quality) vs better ones or is there 
only one supplier?

BTW, these are original rollers with 83K km or 52K mi. Is this about the 
lifetime?

Subject: Using P9201 tool on 944 timing belt


I found that there was no way of fitting the paddle of the P9201 between
the belt and the plastic rear belt cover without deflecting the belt
downwards thus causing an inaccurate reading. 

However, after I removed the timing belt idler and the chrome guard rail, 
I was able to position the tool farther down the belt for a better 
reading so nothing else was touching the tool and belt. The sliding 
paddle was directly above the water pump pulley.

Is this the correct procedure? In all the pictures I've seen of the tool 
in use, it was positioned higher. But there's no way of inserting the 
paddle without affecting the belt tension at this position.

Count me in.   Let us know if you decide to do it and I'll let you know
where I can be reached.  There are some pretty desolate areas here in WV
that I would hate to be stranded in.  I'm sure that Nate would agree that
the same goes for some areas in his neck of the woods.  It sounds like a

With the problem as described, the mechanic clearly made the correct
call in replacing the oil-soaked belt. Also, considering the amount of
labor required to get to the engine seals, replacing all of them if
only one failed is certainly justifiable.  If it were me, I would have
definitely resealed the whole front of a 96 Kmile 944 engine.

However, what we really have here is a failure to communicate.  Here is
how I think the mechanic/customer interaction should go:

1) Customer brings car in with report of a problem.  

2) Mechanic diagnoses problem and formulates proper repair
recommendation.

3) Mechanic calls customer on the telephone to inform him/her of
problem cause.  Mechanic recommends proper repair procedure, which, if
accepted and authorized by customer, is warranted for some period of
time (at least 6 months).

4) If customer declines the mechanic's recommended repair procedure,
the car is returned as closely as possible to its original condition.
The problem and recommended repair procedure are written on the work
order, together with the fact that the customer declined the
recommended repair.  The customer signs the work order, pays for the
time spent diagnosing the problem, and is handed his/her keys, free
to get a second opinion elsewhere or grenade his/her engine with an
oil-soaked timing belt.

It shouldn't be any more complicated than this, should it?.

Subject:       3.2 L Twin Plug Conversion Question

I have converted my 3.2 L ,87 enging to twin plugs and am using a 
distributor from the 3.6 L engine to distribute the spark to all the 
plugs (yes I am aware of the mod to the distributor to prevent 
premature belt failure)

My question has to do with how to set this system up with only one 
signal from the brain to fire the coil.
I am aware of the hybrid that Andial offers, but think that it is 
entirely out of my budget and want to explore alternatives. 

One of the concepts that we are exploring is to have the brain signal 
go to the stock 3.2 coil (as it does normally) and then take a 1 meg 
ohm resistor from that signal on the coil and send it to a CD box 
(already have one) to fire tanother coil. The theory is that the resistor 
will help to isolate the second coil from the first. 

I'm not sure that this is the best solution because of the number of 
parts involved (more prone to failures). What I would prefer is a 
single CD box or coiless system that can accept a single signal from 
the brain and send spark to both distributors. Does anyone know of 
such a beast or have any suggestions??

The renewed quest for a water-pumper for the wife

owner (guy who owns it is a dealer for those little
"Legends" race cars) claims it is an '89.  Was the "S"
available in '89?  I've seen lots of '87s and '88s, but no 
'89s.  He's asking $9900, so I'm midly interested.
The car is extremely clean, has about 70k miles, but I 
have not verified maintenance records, etc.

So, was there an '89 S?  Is $9900 reasonable?

I have enclosed a nicely written discussion. While the focus is upon the
products made by Meguiar's, some of the text is generalizable. Other quality
products are made by Eagle-One, Mother's, Malm's, Liquid Glass. Basic choices
are glaze versus "wax," and synthetic versus carnauba within "wax." When
evaluating carnauba products, keep in mind that 100% FDA Pure carnauba retails
for about $21.00 per kilogram. If you see a car care product with prices out
of line with this -- such as the hype from Connecticut sold for $100 to
$2000 per pound -- don't be a sucker for marketing BS.

                           [References to photos deleted]


                Five years have passed since I last wrote the definitive
          tome on using Meguiar's products to keep your car looking, well,
          as nice as mine. In that half-decade, some products and techni-
          ques have changed. Add to that certain production problems with
          the last publishing on this subject, membership turnover, and the
          recycling of old Zundfolges as kindling and parakeet cage liners;
          the time for a rewrite is upon us.

                Credit for this rewrite must be shared with Dennis Noland
          of Exeter Garage of Seattle, one of the few detail shops which
          follows the processes outlined below; and with Terry Richards,
          the area representative of Meguiar's, who was kind enough to
          bring me up to date on new product details. I have personally ob-
          served or tried every operation described in this article, and
          routinely use the appropriate procedures on my own rolling stock.
          So, departing from my usual practice, I will take the blame for
          any errors the editors have not installed for me.

                How to keeping new paint looking new always baffled me.
          Wash it, and I got scratches. Wax it, I got more scratches. It
          seems like the cleaner I tried to keep it, the more scratched it
          got. I'm not talking about gouges, just light scratching. Take
          the car to a detail shop (at least to judge from cars I've seen),
          and you can add swirls to the list of horrors. And I know I have
          a lot of company.

                One solution (to which I used to plead guilty) is only to
          wash and wax once a year. Assuming the car is garaged, this does
          minimize paint damage, at the expense of appearance and oxida-
          tion. It is not really a solution at all, any more than a hat is
          a solution to baldness. Fortunately, there is a real remedy to
          the dilemma, and it is Meguiar's.

                There are more companies making car care products than
          there are rust pockets in a Karmann-bodied coupe, and I cannot
          say that Meguiar's is the best. I have not tried them all (I have
          tried dozens, however). I have found only one line that seems to
          consistently work, with emphasis on consistent. In addition,
          Meguiar's has done more to see that its products are used proper-
          ly (read, "successfully"), than any other manufacturer I know of
          (at least through its reps -- its printed literature is a bit
          confusing). I am not a Meguiar's salesman, and I feel that if you
          already have a system which works for you, stick with it. For ex-
          ample, I can suggest no Meguiar's compound which will do a better
          job on chrome than Simichrome. But if you have had decades of
          frustration, as I have, with $6.00 waxes wasting $3,000.00 paint
          jobs, read on.

                Mr. Achilles takes a stand. Meguiar's has expanded its pro-
          duct numbers since the original publication of this monograph,
          continuing its entropic tradition. Unfortunately, there remains
          no choice but to learn which numbered product does what. Since
          you are not running a detail shop and are (presumably) concerned
          with only one or two cars, probably an half-dozen products will
          do it for you. Don't let the numbers intimidate you, you only
          need to learn a few.

                Another bit of lameness is Meguiar's' naming of products --
          "Professional" this, "Hi-Tech" that. To its credit, the "No. 11
          Professional Hi-Tech Finesse Quick-Step" no longer appears in the
          catalog, but what is the difference between "No. 00 Hi-Tech Wash"
          and "No. 62 Carwash Shampoo & Conditioner"? Especially if your
          car is not endowed with a full bonnet of hair? Such monikers will
          not be honored by further repetition in these pages.

                Theory. The theory behind Meguiar's products is simple. A
          system is needed to care for the car's finish, not just one or
          two `universal' products. First, take out scratching and don't
          put any in. Second, put oils back into the paint instead of tak-
          ing them out. Third, avoid wax buildups or anything which will
          dull the natural gloss of the paint.

                This theory is expressed in Meguiar's products in a number
          of ways. Solvents and detergents are avoided. Abrasives which
          will not break down are not used. Nearly every Meguiar's liquid
          has feeder oils, which replenish the natural oils in paint. Al-
          most no carnauba wax is included, as solvents are needed to make
          it flow and it leads to wax buildup. Silicones are avoided in
          nearly every material except the waxes, where they are used as
          carrying agents. And the foam pads for machine use are about the
          best product to come down the pike for polishing without inducing
          swirling.

                Typical case. The following is a typical treatment by a BMW
          owner new to the Meguiar's regime. It is based on about a dozen
          real-world applications by the author. This will help establish a
          baseline of products you can expect to use. We can then consider
          the exceptions to the rules, and the techniques involved.

                First, wash with 00 or 62. Next, remove things that can be
          removed (e.g. windshield wipers) and mask vents, grills, or any-
          thing else that will be hard to clean spatter off of. Clean with
          No. 2. Polish with No. 7. Wax with No. 26 (one coat) or Medallion
          (two or three coats).

                Whew, that's a lot of work! Fortunately, if you keep up
          with the car you won't need to do all the steps next time.
          Maintenance with No. 7 or No. 9 and wax is usually sufficient; if
          the car is kept polished and waxed, the cleaning is an annual
          event at most.

                Now, on to more theory, technique and special cases.

                Hand vs. machine application. We have been taught that the
          only way to clean and wax a car is by hand. This teaching, how-
          ever, must be relegated to the same dustbin where the teachings
          of the Flat Earth Society now repose. Proper use of the right
          power tools and products will not only yield better results than
          hand application, but is less likely to damage the paint in the
          process. I was surprised by this too, but I cannot dispute that
          which I have witnessed. Unless you are preparing for a body-
          builders' convention, use machines. Virtually all Meguiar's pro-
          ducts can now be applied by hand or machine.

                Hand application is necessary in certain areas that ma-
          chines can't (or in the exercise of prudence should not be called
          upon) to reach. Examples would be around wiper blades, radio
          aerials and sharp body contours. And some people may not want to
          invest in machines. So because of this (and for those who won't
          use machines out of penury or atavism), hand application will be
          discussed, though it is not generally recommended.

                Buffer swirls. Buffer swirls are the result of (1) the
          fibers which comprise wool pads, (2) compounds which don't break
          down, and (3) dirt being ground into the paint. Swirls are quite
          common when wool pads are used (and many detail shops still use
          wool pads). (A few years ago I attended a Porsche club event at
          the dealer in Tacoma, and saw three brand-new cars have their
          paint systematically destroyed while being "prepped" with wool
          pads).

                Swirls are also induced by rubbing with compounds made of
          silicate, sand or aluminum oxide. These materials are not used in
          Meguiar's products, which use materials (e.g. diatomaceous clay)
          which break down as they are used instead of scratching up the
          paint. Improper cleaning of the car before waxing, or failing to
          clean the dirt out of the foam pads, will also result in swirl-
          ing. Wax conceals buffer swirls, but does not remove them. Swirls
          will reappear as the wax wears or is washed off. Go to a car wash
          and take a look at the cars as they emerge -- otherwise im-
          peccable cars come out with grotesque swirling in the paint, now
          visible as a result of the wax being stripped off. (Not to men-
          tion that most car washes introduce scratching.) Swirls can be
          usually be removed, but it is best not to install them in the
          first place.

                The impossible. There are two things which no car care pro-
          duct can do. Totally oxidized paint, checked paint (thousands of
          tiny cracks), and peeling or flaking paint, cannot be restored.
          Paint this far gone (regardless of its age) should be stripped
          and new paint applied. No compound or wax can save that which has
          been destroyed. In addition, deep scratches (i.e. near or into
          the primer) cannot be completely removed, as obviously all the
          paint will be removed with them. They can be minimized, but not
          eliminated. So don't expect miracles, even if you find waxing
          cars a religious experience.

                Do not be completely discouraged, however. Partially
          oxidized paint can be restored, and light-to-moderate scratching
          can be removed. If you aren't sure whether or not you are at-
          tempting a miracle, give it a shot -- no harm can come from
          trying.

                Type of paint. The products and techniques you use will
          vary somewhat depending on the type of paint your car has. So you
          must determine the type of paint you are dealing with. Meguiar's
          divides paints into two categories, conventional and "high tech",
          which I will call "plastic paints" because I can't stand the
          hype. Conventional paints are enamels (acrylics and otherwise)
          and lacquers (ditto). Plastic paints include the ever-expanding
          family of urethanes.

                This matters because the urethanes are very hard, and when
          they scratch (or swirl) you have to be more aggressive to get the
          flaws out. Conventional paints are softer, scratching and repair-
          ing more easily. Conventional paints will tolerate more heat than
          will plastic paints, so buffers can be run at faster speeds
          (within reason); if plastic paints are overheated, they will
          cloud.

                Determining which paint you are dealing with can be quite
          challenging. Manufacturers have been inconsistent in what type of
          paint they use, and aren't very good about telling you. To make
          matters worse, a different type of paint may have been used on a
          repaired area than on the rest of the car. So if in doubt, ask a
          reputable body shop what type of paint you have. And if your car
          is repaired or repainted, make a note of the type of paint used.

                Generally speaking, solid-color BMW's used to come with
          conventional paints, but now come with a single-stage urethane.
          Metallic painted BMW's always have a clear coat. The clear coat
          was of uncertain parentage (some would say it was a son of a
          bachelor) until about the late seventies, when urethane clear
          coats appeared. As many of us know, paint failure on metallic
          BMW's was a certainty until this change was made. Any clear-
          coated BMW may be treated as having plastic paint. Solid-colored
          BMW's of other than recent vintage will require some detective
          work.

                To check if you car has a conventional or plastic paint,
          rub a small area with a terry cloth towel and some cleaner (No.
          2). If color comes off the car onto the towel, you have conven-
          tional paint. If no color appears, you have plastic paint (proba-
          bly a clear coat).

                Condition of paint. The condition of the paint will
          determine how aggressive you need to be in restoring it. New cars
          should need very little work (unless butchered when being
          "prepped"), but a five-year-old car which has been parked outside
          will probably need two or three additional steps. The differences
          will be dealt with in the text.

                Equipment. In an effort to avoid inducing sticker shock,
          let me warn you that a one-time investment of $300 - $400 may be
          required to properly care for you car's paint. This could be
          lowered considerably by a club group purchase, or if your club
          purchases a buffer and DA and rents/loans them out.

                What you need is:

                - A variable speed rotary buffer for cleaning. I am
                  satisfied with my Makita 9207SPC, which sells for about
                  $200 discounted. Also recommended is the Black & Decker
                  No. 6138 (ca. $280)  Whatever you use, it should work at
                  well under 2000 rpm (like 1000-1400 rpm). Some people use
                  a variable speed drill with a $5 adaptor, but this quick-
                  ly gets tiring; not recommended.

                - A dual action (DA), orbital or "hutch" (Hutchins) buffer
                  for polishing and waxing. Polishing and waxing can be
                  done with the rotary buffer, but a DA is a better choice
                  for a number of reasons. It is smaller and lighter than a
                  buffer, thus a lot easier on your back. Because of its
                  low speeds, it splatters less material. And the low
                  speeds and eccentric motions make it much less capable of
                  harming a car than a rotary buffer. However, a DA is not
                  good for cleaning. A recommended orbital is the Porter-
                  Cable 7335; it sells for about $125. Air-driven Hutchins
                  sanders also work well for buffing. The theory behind
                  DAs, orbitals and hutches is to simulate hand applica-
                  tion, but at a higher speed and with less effort.

                - Meguiar's foam application pads. About $50.00. Do not use
                  wool pads. Get two yellow polishing pads (W-1000 in 8"
                  and W-5500 in 5-1/2") and one or two 8" finishing pads
                  (W-9000). The finishing pad has velcro backing, so you
                  will need a backing plate (No. W-65) if you don't have
                  one. (A new backing plate with an alignment pin for the
                  pads is imminent). The 5-1/2" finishing pads presently
                  only come with a backing plate permanently affixed; 8"
                  finishing pads come with permanent backing plate or with
                  velcro (W-1000L). If you are using a DA, get a couple of
                  6" yellow polishing pads for it (W-6000); these are
                  presently the only foam pads available for DAs. If you
                  are attaching serious scratches, get a burgundy cutting
                  pad (W-7000).

                - A supply of terry cloth towels (all cotton). Thick looped
                  toweling is best; the theory is that dirt goes down into
                  the loops, where it cannot damage the paint. Save your
                  marriage, and get some nice, soft towels for your car at
                  a department store sale.

                - Folded and stitched terry cloth pads, about 3" square.
                  Not absolutely necessary, but very nice for hand work.

                - A small, stiff nylon brush. Like a toothbrush with a
                  gland condition. Figure a dollar.

                - A small wire brush (Snap-On sells a nice one with stain-
                  less steel bristles for under three dollars).

                - Some dense, closed-cell foam application pads for apply-
                  ing polish (about 3" square). Cadge these. I use foam
                  from the thermal barrier you put under your sleeping bag
                  when camping.

                - Meguiar's materials appropriate to the job.  Plan on
                  $80.00.

                - Apron or coveralls, free of any scratch-inducing metal on
                  the front. Some enterprising sort should market terry
                  cloth aprons!

          To help you accept this, consider that the total cost is less
          than two trips to a detail shop, and the results should be sub-
          stantially better in most cases. If you share, borrow or rent a
          buffer from your club, you're probably dollars ahead the first
          time around.

                The yellow polishing pads for rotary buffers come in large
          (8") and small (5-1/2") sizes.  The 8" pad covers a lot of area
          in less time, but the 5.5" pad is good for getting into smaller
          spaces. My counsel is to start with a set of the 8" pads, and
          pick up smaller ones when you feel the need.

                As to where to get this stuff locally, I bought my Makita
          at Tool Town on 15th Ave. West. The Meguiar's products are
          carried by Exeter Garage and Autosport Seattle. Look for depart-
          ment store or linen store sales for the towels. The orbital can
          be bought at Home Depot.

                Technique. Technique is, of course, more important than
          size (850i owners take note). The following practices should be
          observed, as a general rule.

                First, never wash, polish or wax the car in the sun. Do it
          in the shade, indoors or not at all.

                If you are applying materials by hand, squirt the material
          onto the terry cloth pad, instead of onto the car as you usually
          would do with machine application.

                With buffing wheels, use different pads for cleaners,
          polishes and waxes, and frequently clean or change the pad, as
          any dirt trapped in it will scratch the paint. Frequently refresh
          the pad with material, using modest quantities. When rubbing, do
          not use a circular motion. Always use straight strokes. This will
          avoid swirls and minimize the number of angles at which light is
          refracted by any scratches you induce. It is recommended that
          your strokes be back and forth, in the direction which the car
          travels.

                Whether by machine or by hand, use light pressure. If light
          pressure does not do the job, try a more aggressive product (ex-
          cept on urethanes) and/or a higher machine speed, depending on
          the experience of the operator and the type of paint. Keep rotary
          buffers well under 2000 rpm; if working on urethane 1200 to 1400
          rpm is better). Under no circumstances should you be "grinding"
          on the finish.

                Sometimes the rotary buffing wheel will start to oscillate,
          jittering like an orbital sander. This is usually the result of
          the pressure not being on the center of the pad (plus the pads
          are not the best-balanced objects to pass through my shop). The
          oscillating motion can do your paint no good, and may well harm
          it. If you feel an oscillation building, ease up the pressure and
          try to center the pressure on the middle of the pad. Otherwise,
          lift the buffer off the surface and reapply it after the oscilla-
          tion subsides.

                With an air-driven hutch or DA, don't turn the tool on be-
          fore the wheel is on the car. Without contact, the wheel spins up
          to a very high speed, slinging material and tearing up the pad.
          The slight friction contact with the car provides should slow the
          tool down to a fairly slow speed (adjust the air pressure if it
          doesn't).

                Resist the temptation to hold the buffer with one hand
          while stretching to reach those hard-to-get spots, like the cen-
          ter of the roof. This is an invitation to disaster.

                When applying liquids with buffing wheels, a number of
          practices should be observed. The foam pad must be kept clear of
          dirt and dead foam. Before reusing the pad and periodically
          thereafter, scrape it (while rotating) with the plastic brush un-
          til stuff stops coming off. If there is any suspicion of dirt
          caught in the foam, you may also apply terry cloth to the rotat-
          ing pad to clean it. The foam wheel may be trimmed using a wire
          brush. The wheel should be kept in flat trim, and periodic trim-
          ming can greatly extend the life of this fairly expensive pro-
          duct. Application of liquids may be in a column on the painted
          area being worked on, or to the foam pad directly. Which is ap-
          propriate depends on which product you are using (see text below
          and read the labels), but generally you will be happier applying
          the liquid to the car, as the wheel slings off quite a bit in all
          directions as it spins up. If the liquid has been applied direct-
          ly to the car, approach the liquid with the pad at a slight
          angle, so the liquid is thrown back onto the pad and not onto
          everything else. With the Makita, which rotates clockwise (when
          observed from above), the edge farthest from you will be the con-
          tact edge if you are right-handed. Once the liquid has been dis-
          tributed, keep the pad flat on the panel (with the weight on the
          pad's center) to avoid swirl marks. Do not apply cleaner to the
          car and then leave it sitting.

                Guide the machine in long, straight, overlapping strokes,
          letting the machine do the work. Every novice moves the machine
          in a circular pattern on the panel being worked -- don't do it.
          On the other hand, keep the machine moving; if you rest it in one
          place, the paint may overheat from friction and be damaged. I
          have found that the trunk and hood are more easily approached
          from their ends than from the sides, and that the roof is most
          easily buffed without the use of a ladder. Avoid using the ma-
          chine on high points (the body creases), because it will wear
          through the paint. Do these by hand. And avoid objects which may
          catch the pad (e.g. the air vents on the hood, antenna, etc.),
          because the pad is too expensive to rip up and you may have the
          machine power itself onto the hood (or whatever), ruining your
          whole day. In the same vein, some system is necessary to avoid
          scratching the finish with a power cord or air hose. Encasing the
          cord in socks is one suggestion.

                Also, avoid the plastic beading set in the rubber around
          windshields (2002, 320i). I found that the buffer can permanently
          disfigure these.

                All Meguiar's materials have an indefinite shelf life (if
          not allowed to freeze), but they should be well shaken before use
          to evenly distribute the solids, which may settle out.

                If applying a liquid directly to the car, squirt it in a
          15" - 24" long bead. After it is worked in, lay down another bead
          on the feather edge of the area you just worked. Columns will be
          about 12" apart except the wax, which works better with more but
          thinner columns, so expect columns 8" on center for wax. The
          other exception is the No. 1 cleaner, which is best applied
          directly to the pad. When applying materials onto the pad instead
          onto the car, put it on the center of the pad to minimize splat-
          ter.

                Although you can continue buffing until the liquid is most-
          ly dry, this is not a good idea on dark or clear-coated finishes.
          In general, you should stop buffing after the material begins to
          break down but before it becomes dry (you can tell when it is dry
          because it will leave a glossy finish without further wiping);
          stop when a thin film of material remains. At this point you can
          (and should) remove the film with terry cloths, rather than with
          more buffing.

                Discrete foam pads should be used with cleaners, polishers
          and waxes. This is because their chemical and abrasive composi-
          tions differ, and mixing them up undoes what you are trying to
          do. So plan on having three pads, and identify the use of each
          with an indelible marker. Use your best pads for polishing and
          waxing; when they become tatty, demote them to permanent cleaning
          duty.

                Be somewhat stingy with liquids. Most people use way more
          than is necessary, at least while they are learning.

                Use the softest terry cloths you can. They often get softer
          with repeated washings, by the way. Remember, cloth is an
          abrasive! Any dirt caught in the cloth will undo your work, so
          clean the cloth frequently with a brush or another cloth, and
          don't be bashful about chucking it into the laundry and grabbing
          another, clean cloth. When washing, do not use liquid fabric
          softeners. Fabric stores carry terry cloth by the yard, but it
          will generate lots of lint before it is washed. Also, when you
          cut it the unbound edges will chuck off yet more fabric. So I
          prefer towels to terry-by-the-yard.

                Finally, it is much easier on you and the car to maintain
          the paint (with regular washing and waxing) than it is to restore
          it and wax it, say, annually. (This is true of every aspect of
          any mechanical object, just in case you hadn't contemplated the
          subj. It is also true that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Such
          is the yin and yang of automobiles.) The idea of an annual wax
          (as with Meguiar's No. 20, a polymer) will not work out if the
          car is used outdoors. If you just drive it around your garage,
          though, it's probably ok.

                Splatter. It is inevitable that, using machines, slop will
          get all over the car. Especially until you learn just how much
          liquid to use and how to apply it. The car will look like a muddy
          dog shook itself off nearby. For this reason, you should plan on
          doing each step to the entire car (or as much of it as is ap-
          propriate) before moving on to the next step, so you only have to
          wipe up once after each step. You could cover areas not being
          worked with soft (e.g. terry) cloths, but it's probably easier
          just to wipe up slung liquids with terry cloths.

                Other suggestions: Wear an apron or coveralls, for some of
          the splatter will be tossed onto you, particularly your chest and
          gut. And start at the top of the car and work down, because
          splatter obeys the law of gravity.

                Another characteristic of splatter is that it gets into
          cracks, such as between the hood and fenders, the door jambs, and
          so forth. You will find a thin line of splatter behind the edge
          you just worked. I suggest that after each step, you open the ap-
          propriate panel and remove the splatter before it dries out. Use
          a terry cloth. It may take a couple of wipes, as a thin residue
          will be left after the first pass. Dry or hard-to-remove splatter
          can be addressed with No. 34 spray and terry towels.

                Wash the car. Never wash in direct sunlight. When washing
          the car, do use plenty of water and never, ever use a detergent
          (like dish soap). Prepare a five-gallon bucket of suds, so when
          you wring out your wash mitt the dirt can settle out. Wet the car
          thoroughly before soaping. Do one panel at a time (so the soap
          doesn't dry before it is rinsed), starting at the top. As I apply
          the soapy water to an area, I flush it with the hose at the same
          time.

                Synthetic wash mitts work well -- this is the only place
          for synthetics (other than the buffing pads). Terry cloth can
          also be used. Frequent turning and rinsing of the mitt or terry
          is necessary, because dirt trapped in it will scratch the finish.
          Car washing is where scratching problems start; after all, that's
          when the most grit is present to cause scratching. Don't let it
          happen to you.

                Meguiar's recommends its No. 00 wash, which I have used for
          years. A more recent product is No. 62, which is available in the
          large quantities No. 00 used to come in and which is a good deal
          less expensive (though about the same as No. 00 was before No. 62
          came along). Though I am resistant to change, I can find no fault
          with No. 62 and for reasons of economy will adopt it. The
          Meguiar's products really enhance the shine of Meguiar's-finished
          cars, without silicones and without stripping off the waxes and
          oils.

                However, most any quality car shampoo will do fine. A qual-
          ity product will have no detergents and no silicones.

                Meguiar's also makes a waterless spray-on wash, No. 34,
          which you wipe off with a terry cloth. This product, now called
          "Final Inspection", replaces, is much less expensive and is
          entirely reformulated from, the former No. 34 "Trigger Wash." The
          notion of wiping off a dirty emulsion scares the hell out of me,
          because how can you avoid abrading the surface as you wipe? The
          theory is that No. 34 puts a lubricant (not silicone) between the
          paint and the dirt, floating the dirt off. It seems to work, but
          I remain uncomfortable with it in heavy grime situations.

                Dry the washed car with The Absorber or clean terry cloths,
          again turning them frequently to avoid scoring the finish with
          dirt particles. Leather chamois is not recommended for drying (or
          anything else, for that matter, except patching elbows).

                Removing scratches. The technique for removing scratches
          depends on the severity of the scratch.

                Very light scratching and light oxidation can be addressed
          with No. 9 ("Swirl Remover").

                Light scratching is addressed with the standard cleaning
          routine, using No. 2.

                Moderate scratching can be more challenging, and may re-
          quire a few trips to the arsenal. Try less aggressive products
          first, then more aggressive ones if needed. This is true both for
          the cleaners and the pads. So depending on how bad the scratching
          (or oxidation) is, first try No. 2, No. 1, then No. 4 (in that
          order); and start with an unaggressive pad (a finishing pad),
          moving to a moderately aggressive pad (the yellow polishing pad,
          Nos. W-1000 and W-5500 depending on size), then a cutting pad if
          that doesn't work (W-7000). Use your judgment and experience as
          you acquire it, though. Paints are different, and you may find it
          best to go right to a polishing or cutting pad. You may want to
          try a more aggressive pad with a less aggressive cleaner before
          going to a more aggressive cleaner. Note that the aggressive
          cleaners and pads will induce some light scratching while reduc-
          ing the moderate scratch; you will need to progressively rework
          the area with decreasingly aggressive products to polish it
          mirror-smooth.

                Deep scratching is handled with Unigrit sandpaper (de-
          scribed below); 2000 grit is a good starting point. Follow this
          by No. 1, No. 2 and then either No. 3 or No. 7 in that order.

                Severe scratching is present if you can run your fingernail
          over the scratch and it gets caught. This generally cannot be
          sanded. Likewise, if the flaw has penetrated near or to the
          primer or metal, sanding is not the answer. You have no choice
          but to use touch-up paint, let it dry thoroughly, then block sand
          and polish. Scratching underneath the paint, of course, requires
          stripping the paint and refinishing the metal.

                Sanding and blocking. Sometimes a scratch will need to be
          sanded out, or touch-up paint will need to be blocked down so it
          blends with the rest of the paint. (And sometimes whole cars need
          to be wet-sanded, but that is beyond the scope of this article).
          Sanding is done with Meguiar's Unigrit (formerly Nikken) sand-
          paper. This has a very even distribution of grit which is closely
          controlled in size. It comes in grades from 80 to 2000 grit --
          you will mostly be concerned with the 2000. It should be soaked
          overnight before use, and used with dilute No. 00 as a lubricant.
          The E-7200 backing pad is an excellent backing. Two sheets of
          sandpaper and a new backing pad run about three dollars. In sand-
          ing, you will simply feather the scratch out.

                Sanding blocks are used to work out defects above the paint
          surface. Meguiar's blocks (which are fairly small) come from 400
          to 3000 grade, and last almost forever. They should also be kept
          soaking before use.

                After any sanding, expect to clean with No. 2 or stronger,
          followed by polishing.

                Clean the car - theory.

                "Cleaning" the car is not the same as "washing" the car. A
          "clean" car is free of oxidized paint, road tars and salts, acids
          found in the rain, and so forth. The car is chemically clean, and
          the pores of the paint are free of contaminants. Thus, a wax-
          based material is not used for cleaning. Meguiar's cleaners are
          No. 1 (medium) and No. 2 (fine) and No. 4 (heavy).

                A nearly new finish will need no cleaning at all -- the
          step can be skipped, and you can go straight to polishing. No. 2
          has feeding oils, cleaning chemicals and a buffered earth
          abrasive. I have found it to be gentle and effective. No. 1 is
          used for finishes with moderate oxidation or swirling. If you use
          No. 1, plan on following up with No. 2 before moving on to
          polishing. No. 4 is used only to removed heavy oxidation or rela-
          tively deep scratching; in practice, you will rarely employ it.
          Experience will teach you that the proper amount of cleaner is
          more sparing than you think -- it does not need to be slopped all
          over.

                The key is to start with the least aggressive treatment,
          and only if that proves insufficient do you move on to a more ag-
          gressive product. If in doubt, use the less aggressive. And re-
          member, it sometimes takes more than one pass to get the job
          done. Again, you are better off with two passes of No. 2 than one
          pass of No. 1, but I would draw the line there. You will quickly
          develop a sense of just what the two different cleaners do. If in
          doubt, experiment on test patches, as experimenting on whole
          panels is very time consuming, not to mention risky.

                Clean the car - by machine.

                For conventional paints, try a finishing pad first, using
          No. 2, especially if this is maintenance cleaning; if this
          doesn't get the car clean (you will know after working on one
          panel) move to a polishing pad. Bear in mind that not all panels
          are the same; frequently, the roof, hood and trunk will need more
          aggressive treatment than the sides, due to more exposure to the
          elements.

                For plastic paints, follow the same procedure, bearing this
          in mind: plastic paints are harder than conventional paints. Much
          harder. That means that you treat them less aggressively. Why?
          The harder the paint, the milder you treat it, as harsh treatment
          will induce scratching you can't easily polish out (induced
          scratching is relatively easy to polish out of the softer conven-
          tional paints). Thus, you will want to avoid No. 1 (use only No.
          2 cleaner or No.9 cleaner/polish) and you will run your rotary
          buffer at its lower speeds. Also, you will probably use a finish-
          ing pad instead of a cleaning pad.

                Clean the car - by hand. In the Meguiar's world, use No. 2
          for most cleaning by hand, applying the liquid directly to the
          pad. Expect a moderately needy finish to require thirty to forty
          strokes to be clean.

                Polish the paint - theory. By polishing the paint, we mean
          nourishing it and hiding hairline scratches. Meguiar's polishes
          also restore the oils which washing, age, sun, rain and air
          (smog) have leached out of the paint. (This is not to be confused
          with the "seal jobs" done by car dealerships, which involves put-
          ting a polymer over the paint, rather than oils into it, together
          with an adjustment to the customer's bank balance.) The immediate
          difference this step makes, especially for dark-colored cars, is
          so impressive that you would use polish even if it didn't
          renourish the paint. Meguiar's claims the benefits of its polish
          accrete with each application; and indeed, if maintained, very
          little polish is needed to replenish the paint.

                The Meguiar's family of polishes includes Nos. 3, 7, and 9
          (No. 5 has been removed from the line-up since last publication).
          Unlike cleaners, pure polishes are not abrasive. Meguiar's No. 7
          is pure polish. No. 3 is a little more aggressive; it can pull a
          little haze off the paint, or a very light oxidation. No. 9 is a
          polish with a cleaner, and thus has some light abrasives in it;
          it is the most aggressive of the polishes. No. 9 is good for
          removing light swirling, or if you really don't need a cleaning
          step. Use it with a rotary buffer and a finishing pad, if avail-
          able.

                Polishing by machine - in general. Polishing is not an
          abrasive process (except with No. 9, see above), and in fact the
          polish acts as a lubricant between the pad and the paint. For ma-
          chine application, the polish may be squirted directly onto the
          panels, doing one panel at a time. The polish may be buffed until
          the material breaks down, stop buffing before the polish dries
          into a powder. If one application and buffing is insufficient,
          try another. Be sure to observe precautions (under "Polishing by
          hand", below) about not letting the polish dry. Especially with
          No. 7, the polish will get gummy, making it unnecessarily dif-
          ficult to remove the excess. By the way, I have had a problem
          with blockages in the dispenser nozzles of No. 3; a bent paper-
          clip or coat hanger clears it nicely.

                Polishing with buffers. If using a buffer (a rotary ma-
          chine) for polishing, use a finishing pad (W-9000). For polishing
          conventional paints, use No. 3; No. 9 is recommended for plastic
          paints. In addition to including mild cleaners, No. 9 is designed
          for the tighter molecular structure which plastic paints present.
          It is also the easiest of the polishes to use, if you need fur-
          ther incentive.

               Polishing with DA. For polishing with a DA, orbital or
           hutch, yellow polishing pads are all that is available (and will
           work fine). Whether polishing conventional or plastic paints, use
           No. 7. Use No. 7 sparingly, and clean the foam pad often, to pre-
           vent the pad from gumming up.

                 Polishing by hand. For hand application on conventional
           paint, use No. 7. This polish can be applied with a rigid foam
           pad, a soft sponge or a terry cloth. Apply the polish directly to
           the car, and spread it out evenly with the pad. The pad will
           literally glide over the polish. The idea is to coat the panel
           (start by doing one panel at a time, until you gain experience
           with curing times) with as thin a coat as will completely cover
          it. The polish can be further worked into the paint using a terry
          cloth. The more which is infused into the paint, the better; how-
          ever, it should be used sparingly to avoid gumming and excessive
          wiping. The paint can only absorb so much; beyond that, the
          polish is wasted and just creates extra work.

                The polish will not fully dry (nor would you want it to);
          hence, it can and should be wiped off with terry toweling. This
          can be done one panel at a time. If the weather is not too warm,
          removing the excess polish can be done after the whole car has
          been coated; however, warm weather will cause the polish to dry,
          and you will regret not having wiped it off earlier, so keep an
          eye on it.

                Using the terry cloth towel, wipe gently using straight
          strokes. A residue will be left, which can be wiped up with a
          fresh terry cloth. Continue until all the polish is removed.
                  For hand application on plastic paints, use No. 7 or No.
          9. If No. 9 is used by hand, apply it as you would a cleaner and
          not as you would apply the No. 7 polish.

                Wax the paint - in general. Whether by hand or by machine,
          and whether the paint is conventional or plastic, use either No.
          26 liquid wax or Medallion. It is hard to describe the dif-
          ferences; the No. 26 is one of the few Meguiar's materials with
          silicone, and it has some (not a lot) of carnauba (you don't need
          or want much carnauba, by the way). Meguiar's does not disclose
          the contents of Medallion (it probably has some silicone in it
          too), but Meguiar's claims that it ionically bonds to the car's
          finish, resulting is freedom from dust-attracting static. This is
          a difficult claim to verify, but it does seem to yield superior
          results, last longer and be even less effort to apply than No.
          26. Considering how little is needed to coat the car and its
          greater durability, Medallion's additional cost is more than off-
          set. Plus, it smells a lot better than No. 26. My unconditional
          endorsement goes to Medallion.

                Apply the wax - by machine. I have found machine applica-
          tion consistently yields results superior to hand application
          here, especially with Medallion. Use thin coats, two if No. 26,
          two or three if Medallion), instead of one thick one. Both of
          these materials are so slippery that very little is needed.
                If waxing with a rotary buffer, use a finishing pad; if
          waxing with a DA, you must use the yellow polishing pad (the only
          pad available for DAs), which will carry more of the wax in its
          larger cells than will a finishing pad.

                For machine application, apply the wax directly to the car
          and buff in 8" columns. Buff using light pressure and overlapping
          strokes, leaving a film to dry; do not buff until the material
          begins to break down! Use the slowest buffer speed possible; this
          is the great advantage of the DA.

                Apply the wax - by hand. If waxing by hand, use the same
          procedure as with No. 7 polish. By hand, rub the wax thoroughly
          into the paint so that it fully penetrates. Wipe with clean terry
          cloths, which will take several passes a few minutes apart.

                 Meguiar's does make paste waxes (No. 16 and No. 26), and
          someday I hope to meet the fellow who buys them (five gets you
          eight he owns a Porsche). Paste waxes may not be used with a
          rotary buffer, but can be used with an orbital. If applied by
          hand, they are maybe six times more work to apply than No. 26
          liquid or Medallion, with an inferior result. If you wax cars for
          exercise, though, hand application of paste wax might be for you.

                Finishing waxing. How long you let the wax dry (cure) is
          critical. It should dry to a hazy white. If you drag your finger
          across it, it should ball up and not smear. This will take five
          or more minutes (remember, you are not in direct sunlight). If
          wiped off as a liquid it does no good, and it is difficult to
          remove and you risk damaging the finish if it is left to dry to a
          powder. Of course, the warmer the day the faster the dry time.
          Keep an eye on it, and experience will quickly teach the optimum.

                After the excess is wiped off with terry clothes, there may
          be oils from the No. 7 or No. 9 left on top of the wax, which
          looks like streaking. This is best ignored for a day, after which
          the oil may have been absorbed by the paint and a quick pass with
          a clean terry cloth will solve the problem. Otherwise, wash the
          car down with No. 00 or No. 62. Many have found that after the
          full Meguiar's treatment, a No. 00 or No. 62 wash further im-
          proves the car's appearance!

                Maintenance. They best way to maintain the finish on your
          car is to keep it garaged when not in use. It is almost im-
          possible to keep a car looking nice if it's parked outside, espe-
          cially if you have a life.

                To maintain the Meguiar's finish, wash with 00 or 62,
          polish with No. 7 or No. 9, then wax with No. 26 or Medallion. If
          this is done as needed, the car will seldom need the cleaning
          step. Since cleaning is the most time consuming, laborious and
          wearing on the paint, routine maintenance is a sensible (if self-
          disciplined) alternative to an annual or semi-annual detailing.

                Clean the glass. The glass may be cleaned, again preferably
          by machine, using No. 1 or No. 4 (which may also be used by hand)
          (and don't try to do the inside of the glass by machine). I am
          amazed how already-"clean" glass can be made to just sparkle with
          this treatment; it also removes water spots. And you should do it
          before polishing and waxing, as there will be cleaner splattered
          all over the glass from when you cleaned the paint, and cleaner
          will be splattered over the paint when you clean the glass.

                Glass can be finished with Rain X if you wish (outside
          only). For those who haven't tried it (and it has been around for
          quite a while), Rain X seals the pores in the glass, which causes
          rain to bead and fly off, and also gives your windshield wipers a
          smoother ride. The down side is complaints about hazing, espe-
          cially in difficult lighting conditions (dusk and dawn). I have
          used the stuff intermittently for about a dozen years, and I
          think it's a good product if used correctly (the residue must be
          wiped completely off, and you can't tell if it's completely off
          in certain lighting conditions). Give it a try; it's around $5
          per bottle, which will last years.

                Clean the rubber. While the wax is curing is a good time to
          get started on the rubber and vinyl. Cleaning is done with No. 39
          and a nylon-bristled brush. On the exterior, hose off the
          cleaner. For protection and appearance, No. 42 works well with
          rubber bumpers, tires, plastic and semi-gloss painted areas. It
          soaks in, and may take multiple coats. It does not leave a shiny
          coat like Armorall, and seems to have less of a tendency to wash
          off in the rain (the streaks Armorall leaves as it washes off are
          one of many reasons to avoid the stuff).

                Clean the plastic. Interior plastic parts may be cleaned
          with No. 40, which can be wiped on or (if the filth requires it)
          brushed with a brush of stiff plastic bristles. (For real grunge,
          No. 39 is a more aggressive cleaner.) It is an Armorall sub-
          stitute, except that it leaves matte finishes matte. (I dislike
          Armorall's making everything shiny. I also dislike the way it
          evaporates and deposits itself on the windshield as a haze, some-
          thing No. 40 also does not seem to do.)

                High-impact plastics, such as turn signal lenses, can have
          scratches removed by machine with No. 1 and No. 3 cleaners; No.
          10 can be used for cleaning thereafter. I have restored lenses I
          was ready to scrap with these materials. No. 10 is the industry
          standard for cleaning plastic airplane windshields, by the way
          (they are restored with a product called Micro Mesh).

                Protection/maintenance of clear high-impact plastic pieces
          can be accomplished with No. 18, which is a cleaner/polish. It
          can also be used on window tints and compact disks.

                Clean the wheels. Everybody has a favorite wheel cleaner,
          from Mothers to Eagle One. Meguiar's sells No. 36, which is used
          with a household paint brush and elbow grease. The No. 36 is non-
          acidic and is not corrosive -- it will not damage wheels.
          Meguiar's makes a big deal out of No. 36 being the only cleaner
          blessed by BBS. But because No. 36 is not aggressive, you have to
          put in a lot of your own effort. So try them all, and use what
          you like best, but don't wait until after you have damaged your
          wheels with another product to try the Meguiar's.

                Summary of applications.  By machine: Conventional paints:
          Wash with 00 or No. 62. Clean with a buffer, using No. 2 unless
          severely oxidized or deeply scratched, in which case use No. 1.
          Polish with No. 3 if using a buffer, or with No. 7 if using a DA
          or hutch. Wax with No. 26 or Medallion, preferably using a DA or
          hutch. Plastic paints: same as above, only polish using a DA or
          hutch with No. 7 or with No. 9 with a rotary buffer and a finish-
          ing pad.

                By hand: Conventional and plastic paints: Wash with 00 or
          No. 62.  Clean with No. 4 or 2, polish with No. 7 wax with No. 26
          paste or liquid, or Medallion.

                Summary of products.  A summary of relevant Meguiar's pro-

Subject: 914 brake pedal, aftermarket wheels

A couple questions today. Now that Katarina is well and alive 
for the summer (though the week before she went on the road 
it was 70 degrees, now it's topping out in the mid-forties), a 
couple questions.

The brakes are a bit annoying - I can stop OK with one press, 
but if I press the brakes twice quickly, the pedal is much 
higher, and much harder - the way it should be. It has 
brand-new brake pads (the old ones were shot), and the rotors 
are good, 19mm master cylinder, and the fronts have SS 
brake hoses (the rears never got installed because it'd involve 
replacing some back lines, which I didn't have the money for 
at the time.) I know the 914 is legendary for spongy brakes, 
but this is ridiculous! Any clues?

Also, has anyone experimented with modern aftermarket 
alloy wheels for 4-bolt 914s? I know Automobile Atlanta sells 
16x7 wheels that supposedly fit under stock fenders, so I'd 
think you could get a modern 15x6 wheel (since 15x5.5 is 
virtually unobtainable) to work...? Anyone tried this?

You probably need to bleed  your proportioning valve. See the archives
for details. No, I don't remember which month.

You can use 15x7s with not too much difficulty, and I've heard of 15x8s
being used. 16s? I dunno. Never been legal in any class I've put
a 914 into... For the bigger wheels, Panosport makes some, ATE makes
some, you can get BBS to make them. There are probably others. Look
to pay about $250 a wheel for these puppies...

Subject: 914 Negative cam and Valve Adjustment

Hi, all:
  Have read the thread on 914 valve adjustment re: firing order. It was over
twenty years ago, but I remember mechanics at the P-A dealership at which I
worked using a long lead on a continuity tester hooked up to the distributer
points. They would be working under a lift, of course. Anyway, they'd spin
the engine and wait for the light to go on, then they'd adjust the valves.
Didn't have to raise and lower the lift. The part that I'm *really* fuzzy on
is I seem to remember one guy spinning the rear wheel to spin the engine. Too
many brain cells gone by the wayside?
Regards,
GP

Subject: Re: NOT Removing 944 camshaft sprocket


Well I removed my camshaft sprocket today , and manged to get the bolt out.

It was very,very tight. Looking at it after removal indicated quite a bit
of corrosion had taken place in the threads.

I tried initialy with the allen headed tool just to get a feel for how
tight it was. 

The problem really is that no matter how expensive and perfecly machined
your tools are, the bolt may not have been manufactured to the same exacting
degree. 

My allen key was a tiny bit loose in the bolt head. I simply made up a
small 'cone' of alluminiun (I dont know the exact thickness, somewhere
inbetween tin-foil and a Coke can), placed this in the bolt a VERY 
gently tapped the tool into the bolt head.

If the tool is an exact match for the bolt it's very hard to strip the
head.

All said and done, it's definately worth having a go at getting the bolt
out. What have you got to loose ?

The two choices are :

	Leave it alone this time you have the opportunity, and reschedule
	the seal replacement for a future date when you will have an 
	experienced shop do the work.

	Have a careful go at it now. Either it will come out and you can
	change the seals (don't forget to change the metal 'spacer' at the
	same time), or you may round off the head in which case you can
	(to quote the above) let an "experienced shop do the work" at a 
	later date. 

 
I would be very interested in replies  to the other questions posed about
'look and feel' for the tensioner and idle pulley bearings.

Keep those spanners moving,


Regards,

Chris.

Speaking of trailing throttle oversteer, I just saw the Motor Week video road
test of the 95 Carrera 4.  They include a great clip of the driver's view of
a 911 doing a 360, to emphasize the improvements in the newer chassis.  It
was on a track, and no contact was made, so I guess the silly smile would
remain intact.  I once managed to do something similar in a 90 300ZX that
resulted in severe contact (concrete divider) and a chronic head and neck

I'm not so much interested in bigger, just something different. I'm 
trying to figure if a more commonly available, late-market 15x6 alloy 
wheel will fit the 914, where I can run decent-sized (205/55) tires 
without rubbing...

I'd love to get some Panasport Minilite-replicas on it, but I just don't 
have the kinda cash to lay out $1000 in wheels... :)

The 2.5L 944S (190hp) was available in '87 and '88.

The 3.0L 944S2 (208hp) was available starting in '89.

If the car checks out with a mechanic and it truely is an
'89 944S2 this seems like a good price.  If it's a 944S
it seems like a fair, but not great, price.

The 944s I've driven with Dunlops have been OK. I do not like Dunlops
on 911s, though.

I like Yokos on just about anything, A509s or AVS Intermediates being
good choices for combo street/autox/track cars.

Hi,

I was there in 1971.  It was sunny (northern coast of the Med) and warm.  
Short sleeve weather.  We camped north of Monte Carlo and drove in every 
day.  We (4 USAF SGTS) drove from Germany over to France and south on the 
4-lane to Cannes.  Well it wasn't cruising around the Med but it wasn't 
that bad either.  We were listening to the local rock station which 
announced between records alternately in French then Italian.

You will like seeing the local residents watching the race from their

Hi, Herb.
 
OK, so you found me out. No, I couldn't wait until that evening, when I
figured the cans at the Gasthaus Krone or the Adler were safe to use (no
obvious pipeline running back up the hill to the Research Center.) During the
day, if I really HAD to go, I used to sneak into the parking lot with the
waterpumpers and, uh, smuggle vital bodily fluids out that way. Blends right
in with the dayglo green coolant.
 
Actually one of my drinking buddies at the time never did figure out how
it's done. In the winter, he used to try to freeze the door locks on my beater
Wabbit GTI shut with innovative and highly directional application of vital
bodily fluids. He's still working there, in the emissions department,
appropriately enough.

Subject: RE: Too low idle of 944?


Jarkko,
The auxiliary air valve is what controls the idle with input from the com
puter.  It allows air to bypass the throttle (butterfly valve that opens
when you depress the accelerator) allowing more air into the engine.  The 
air goes through the air flow meter which gets fooled into thinking 
your depressing the accelerator and raises the idle.  

There are several items in that control loop.  It could be that the air valve
can't flow enough air due to a blockage, the engine speed input to the 
computer is confused, dirty injectors (try a bottle of Chevron Techron).
That's all I can think of since you've done a complete tune up.  The AAV
is located near the back of the engine compartment on the intake side hidden
under some wires and hoses.  It looks like a small fuel filter with some wires
going to it and rubber hose into and out of it.

Subject: 951 coolant system overflow

Hello All;

I had a little trouble with the cooling system on my car this weekend and I am 
looking for help.  After bleeding the brakes and adding new fluid in preparation 
for an upcoming track event at Summit Point, I took my '89 951 out to check the 
quality of my work.  After about 10 minutes of spirited driving and braking I 
returned to my driveway and let the car idle for about 10 minutes to cool down.  
Everything seemed OK.  The fans were running and the Turbo water pump did its 
thing for about 30 seconds.  When I turned the car off, however, the cooling 
system proceeded to vent about 1 gallon of coolant all over the driveway.  At 
first I thought a hose broke, but further investigation showed that the coolant 
was vented from the reservior and overflow hose.

What could cause this to happen?  The car had been sitting at a body shop for 
about a month without being driven.  This was the first time the car had been 
pushed hard since getting it back last week.  None of the repairs involved 
opening up the coolant system.  After replacing the vented coolant last night 
and driving to work today everything seems normal.  I had good heat and the temp 
gauge read between the lower and first mark like normal.  Any theories on what 
might have happened?  Also, where is the bleeder valve for the cooling system?  
I will try bleeding the system at lunch-time today.  Thanks in advance.  Please 
respond directly to me to save bandwidth.

Subject: 944 Camshaft Seal & Gasket Replacement

Gentlemen,

This discussion on leaking 944 camshaft seals is most timely.  My camshaft
housing has begun leaking from both ends.  I have several questions:

1.  In addition to the two O-rings on the front end there appears to be a
shaft seal (part # 999 113 349 40).  I assume this gets replaced also.

2.  Can the seal replacement be done in situ or must the camshaft housing
be removed?  How about for the rear gasket?

3.  Does the triple-square bolt take the same size wrench as the CV bolts?
(this is probably a bit much to ask)

I would appreciate any other tips or guidance from those who have been
there before.  The Haynes manual is no help ("Don't try this at home,
kids...") and the factory manual provides only slightly more info.

Many thanks,
John

Hi, Jan,

Yep, you have to remove the crankshaft pulley to remove the rear belt covers.
Of course, the front belt covers come off after removing only the
alternator/AC belt and the PS pump belt, if any...

     Terry, I have not familiar with exactly this setup...your idea may
   work but my concerns would be;
     1. IF the 3.2 coil is a "CD" type, then the primary is at 300-450
        volts, not 12 (I think they are, as my brothers 84 928 would throw
        a 3" spark across the distributor cap with a plug wire removed).
        Your 1 meg resistor might lower the voltage, but...
     2. ...a 1 megohm resistor and whatever stray capacitance is around could
        give you an "RC" time constant that is pretty slow, and would throw
        off your accuracy (the second spark would be late). This combined
        with the serial delay of the CD box itself -may- be a problem.
     3.  You have to change the DME prom to lower your advance, otherwise
        I don't see much benefit in twin-plugs and very possibly you'll
        reduce your power by combusting too soon.

     For the electricals, what might work is to;
      a. Find the "logic" signal that makes the spark (between the computer
         and the CD circuitry (if Motronic is CD-type).
      b. Go to 2, parallel ignition boxes (don't do the serial route). The
          GM/HEI module, Ford Duraspark or Chrysler box are cheap and good
          (though not CD).
      c. Find some way to modify your PROM for lower overall advance.

    The aftermarket Electromotive (HPV-3b) ignition does what you want, and
   is user configurable, but will cost about $1200 (they gouge on the price
   of the extra coils/drivers for a twin plug) and truly isn't as 
   sophisticated or refined as Motronic.

Subject: Tire Info

I read in the recent issue of Panorama that Porsche makes annual 
recommendations for tires on older Porsches.  The article even mentioned 
that Porsche currently recommends 195/65ZR15 for 15 in wheels.  This is 
just the size of wheel I'm interested in, but the article didn't provide 
suggestion for rear nor specify if this is for American market or Euro.

Can anyboy tell me what Porsche currently recommends for 15 in wheels on 
911SC for Euro and American spec's (if there is a difference)?

Thanks for the help,

Subject: Re: 951 coolant system overflow

Tracy-

The same thing happened to me on my car. We replaced the secondary water pump
on the car (check this), bled the air out of the coolant system (definitely do
this) and the probelm persisted. We decided to pull the head and what it was
was the initial system of head gasket failure. Although this is not good news
to hear, there is a bright side--> it may be in the early stages of going bad
(mine was slightly starting to leak, only if "pushed", ie higher rpms) instead
of blowing out in a big way, dumping coolant all over the track and leaving you
to hitch hike home.

Brace yourself for a new head gasket (have it O ringed when you get the new one
put on) and cross your fingers that it one of the simple problems. If you
haven't had a head gasket blow yet, and if you have done a lot of drivers
schools and spirited driving, you may just want to save the "guesswork" expense
and just go for a new head gasket.

good luck

Subject: 89 C4 Oil Leaks Revisited

Yes - again with the oil leaks.  Hopefully Stan H. and Kevin G. and 
everyone else can provide some helpful insight.

Previously I wrote that I was getting an 89 C4 w/ 20k miles checked out 
when my mechanic (who hasn't seen many 89-newer cars) noticed oil leaking
from the cylinder-to-cylinder head joint.  He also noticed leaks from the 
cam towers (or cam covers - don't remember which).

The current owner was mad that his perfect car had these leaks so he 
called PCNA and had a Porsche Rep (Tim Quinn) look at the car.

This morning Tim, the current owner, and the car met at Jim Ellis 
(Atlanta Porscher Dealer).  Here's what the owner said Tim said:

1. The will fix the problem with the cam towers (covers?).
2. The say another leak in power steering and will fix that.
3. But that the cylinder leak is considered "normal" and they recommend 
NOT fixing it - even if you got a million bucks.  Tim says that the leak 
is caused by oil leaking through the gap when the engine cools.

Help !!!

Who do I believe?  Why is oil (that much) above the cylinder and 
"available" to squeeze through the crack left when the engine cools?  
Porsche Rep says it will not get worse - will it?

My plan is to digest whatever you guys say and if I feel still Ok with 
the car - get Franz Blam (Atlanta mechanic who's seen more newer cars) 
check the thing out.  The owner says he is going to get Tim's stuff in 
writing - even though I don't think it will carry much weight down the road.

Let me know what you think.

Subject: 911 Suspension Tuning Perspectives

I understand that the best investment of my Porsche $'s is in making me a better
driver.  I have taken steps (primarily driver training schools and autocross
events) to hone these skills.  Having stated that, I would appreciate some
perspective from the masters on the appropriate steps to set-up my 1988 911
coupe up for better handling.  I have already invested in great tires with Fuch
7's on the front and 8's on the back.

My approach is in three phases, (naturally, driven by the ever dwindling balance
in my checking account).  The phases are shocks, followed by sway bars, followed
by torsion bars.  My questions are as follows:

1)  Is this the right order for suspension upgrades?  Does is matter if I
upgrade one sub-system prior to another?

2) Shocks - My understanding is that the 1988 911's use Bilstien's in the front.
I am unsure of the proper shock selection.  Bilstein's, Koni - Red, or Koni -
Yellow's?  My driving style and application is aggressive street driving and
autocross/time trials.

3) Sway Bars - I am considering Weltmeister 22mm front and 22mm rear.  Is this a
proper application?  I've heard of "Charlie Bars", is there any difference?
What is the stock sway bar setting on an 88 Carrera Coupe?

4) Torsion Bars - I am considering 23mm front and 28mm rear.  Is this an
appropriate application?  What are the stock torsion bar settings?

5) Am I completely nuts for wanting to do this?  Can anyone out there recommend
a shrink who would cure me of this insaitable obsession to pour all my money
into a peice of steel?

Carlin,

There is a way to manually raise the top.  This should be detailed in you
owner's manual.  I believe it involves removing the two round trim covers
behind your rear speakers and then manually turning the crank with your lug
nut wrench (I hesitate to call it a tire iron because it is a two piece

Subject: stripped spark plug hole in my 914...

Arrgghh!

I spend most of yesterday cursing at anything that was
in sight.  Generally in a real crappy mood.  

I haven't done anything yet since I've acquired the 914
about a month ago.  I've been spending all my time fixing up 
our pickup truck so we can take our dog along with us wherever
we go.  

So yesterday, feeling a bit guilty, went out and bought a 
set of Bosch Platinum plugs (should I use something else?).  

Anyway, the old plugs were Bosch Super.  The first plug
exchanged normally.  When I removed the 2nd, it didn't 
come out nicely.  I inspected the thread on the plug 
and it showed some shavings.  Then I spent the next
2 hours trying to thread the new plug in.  It wouldn't
no matter what.  It would go in 1/2 way and then get
REALLY stuck.  Every time I removed it, I found more
shavings so after a while, I just put it in and
left it there.  The car starts but all I did was drove
it up the driveway into the garage.  I was afraid to
even take it out for a test drive.

Please help, what should I do?  I'm afraid to take out
the other 2 plugs.  Should I "work" it in and out until
it seats all the way in?  I don't think it'll come flying
out since it takes some effort to get it in...

I've forgotten how much fun it is to do little things
on a 914 with that tiny engine lid...:-)

Hi,
        We are on the verge of buying a used 1988 924s with about 68,000 miles.
We haven't found any reviews of the car in the used car books, so we are desperate
for information. Can anyone tell us about the reliability/maintenance cost and what
would be a reasonable price for such a car (in good shape)? Also, what should we
look for when checking the car out, test driving it? And does anyone have any
recommendations for mechanics to check it out (in the Albuquerque area) or even
general suggestions, like whether we should have it checked out by a mechanic at
a Porsche dealer? Thanks!!

=======================================================================

What is Porschephiles?

     Porschephiles is an Internet mailing list centering on the Porsche
automobile in all of its incarnations.

=======================================================================

How does Porschephiles work?

     This list is being run as a mail reflector, which sends incoming 
mail to the whole list at once.  The participants include people with a 
variety of backgrounds, some technical, some race/autocross/performance 
drivers, some owners, some just admirers.  To send a message to the 
whole list, mail to

                porschephiles@tta.com

     To send mail regarding distribution problems, or other 
administrative issues, send mail to

                porschephiles-request@tta.com

     If you have a friend who would like to get on this list, or if you
feel moved to tell other people about it, ONLY GIVE OUT THE "-request"
address.  The list is also available as a digest, where you get a
compilation of the day's messages once per day, rather than getting all
of the individual messages. This seems to be a win for people with slow
mail links or who are just too busy to stay current. If you want to
convert to (or from) the digest, send mail to the "porschephiles-
request" address above.

=======================================================================

Who is the Moderator of the Porschephiles list?

     The moderator is:
          Stanley P. Hanks
          Principal, 
          Technology Tranfer Associates
          P.O. Box 2087
          Bellaire TX 77402-2087

          e-mail: stan@tta.com, 
          voice:  (713) 661-2084 

     His Porsches currently include:  
          '64 356 SC (daily driver)

=======================================================================

What kinds of questions can be asked on the list?

     There are a lot of members on the list.  It's small enough to be 
effective, and large enough to have a number of diverse opinions and
sets of experience.  You ought to be able to ask any question you like,
although it's probably a good idea to look it up yourself if you can and
save the net bandwidth.  Keep the diversity of the list in mind before 
you decide to not ask a question, or if you get flamed for asking an 
"obvious" question.  Diversity -- it's a *feature*...

=======================================================================

Are there any suggestions on how I should submit to the list?

     Beyond using normal good sense and discretion, you can submit
whatever you like that is relevant to Porsches.  You might want to use
descriptive "Subject" lines, including the model number when it is
relevant (e.g., "944 S2 Fuel leak query").  Your submissions would be 
easier for others to read if you make sure that your mailer wraps 
lines of text at 80 characters or less.

=======================================================================

How do I submit administrative requests?

     Send them, and ONLY them, to the "porschephiles-request" address 
(porschephiles-request@tta.com), or to Stan directly.  

=======================================================================

Are archives of the list available?  If so, how can they be obtained?

     Archives are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/archives.
Archives in six subdirectories (90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95) each of which 
has the archives for that year, in UNIX compress format.  There are no
older archives available.  While it might seem like a good idea when
you're first starting out on the list to know what has gone on before,
there are OVER 13 MEG of archives.  DO NOT TRY TO FTP THEM ALL AT ONE
TIME.  And PLEASE DO NOT FTP between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, or Stan
may have to take access away.  Also, DO NOT ask Stan to mail you
archives.  To FTP the compressed archives, you will have to use BINARY
mode in FTP.  On receipt you need to use the UNIX "uncompress" program,
or equivalent, to restore to textual format.  Mac and Windows versions
of "uncompress" are available via FTP from /pub/porschephiles/programs.

=======================================================================

What else is available in the tta.com archives?

     FAQs: In the FAQs directory there is this FAQ and there are FAQs 
for specific Porsche models (so far there's one for 914s and one for 
the Carrera models -- feel free to contribute one on YOUR favorite 
Porsche).  These are available at ftp://tta.com/pub/porschephiles/FAQs.
 
     Images: All sorts of Porsche images for your viewing pleasure,
mostly in .gif format.  There's also a directory called "UPLOAD" where 
you can deposit your own images for inclusion in the collection.  If 
you add any images, please include a file called "from.<username>", 
where <username> is your login ID, that describes the files if possible.

     PCA racing info: The PCA Club Racing Newsletter is now on-line,
thanks to the tireless efforts of the editor.  This is available by FTP 
in the directory tta.com:/pub/porschephiles/PCA/ClubRacing.  The 
newsletters are available both in PostScript and in Windows Write 
format.  If this is useful to you, send your thanks to the editor, Tom,
at "tt911@ibm.net".
 
     MiscInfo: Various other interesting bits of information potentially
useful to Porschephiles.
 
     Survey: The questionaire and results (when compiled) of the 
membership survey.

     Logo contest: Several Porschephiles logos have been submitted;
check them out and choose one you like, or develop your own candidate.
Someday maybe we'll decide on a winner, and then we can have T-shirts,
coffee mugs, stationery, etc., made up.

     And as usual, Monthly-Update, RULES, and Whos-Who, which get 
updated on a monthly basis.

=======================================================================
 
Is there WWW access to the Porschephiles archives?
 
     Yes, WWW access is through http://tta.com/Porschephiles/home.html.
The FTP restriction above applies to major downloading of stuff from the
archives, not WWW access.  Suggestions for improving the WWW pages
would be welcomed, as well as experienced help in doing so.

=======================================================================

What about other Porsche-related WWW links?

     There are several WWW home pages related to Porsches, and more will
undoubtedly appear (if you know of any others, please submit them):

     page

=======================================================================

What about splitting the list? 

     Various proposals surface now and then about splitting the list 
into components based on car model, activity types, or other divisions?  
Stan's reply to these suggestions is as follows:  

     "I just want all you Faithful Readers to understand: there are only 
two votes that count. Mine, and anyone who's willing to pay me to change 
my mind or operation or whatever.
 
     "Posted rates around here are $75/hr for automotive engineering 
projects, $125/hr for information technology consulting, and $2k/day for 
expert witness engagements.  Just so you know where the bidding starts..."

     In other words, the list *WILL* **NOT** be split.

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Who's Who?

     The Who's Who is a listing of those who receive Porschephiles and 
who have responded to the offer to be listed.  It lists the owners, 
their state/country of residence, their car's year and model, and
their net address.  The list is updated when people send Stan the
information, and when he has time to update the list.  He sends it out
on a monthly basis to the list.  Only Porsches are listed, so don't
send your Alfa Zagato or your Buick GN in to be included.  Send
submissions or changes to "porschephiles-request@tta.com."

=======================================================================

What is the Porschephiles Fund?

     From Bart Chambers, the custodian of the fund: "Here, gentle 
reader and Porschephile, is *The Problem*!  Porschephiles has over 1200
members and generates so much traffic and creates such a demand for
computer and bandwidth resources, that its future is in jeopardy if it
remains dependent upon the *ability* and willingness of any individual
to *donate* them.  In order to ensure the continued survival of
'Philes, we, like PBS, are asking members to donate to a non-profit
fund to be used to acquire the required resources, to be *owned* by
Porschephiles.  This will reduce the load on our beloved Listmeister to

Chambers, 1270 Lavall Drive, Davidsonville, MD 21035.  We suggest $50

     Several different clubs are available, depending on your interests
and location:

=======================================================================

I want to join the Porsche Club of America; what do I have to do?

     The Club affiliates you with a local region based on where your
ZIP code falls on their territory map.  You *CAN* request to join a
specific region, and you can specify an affilate region or dual
membership in another region.  The local regions put on many different
events, some social, some educational, some driving or compeition
oriented.  The annual gathering of the whole membership, the Porsche
Parade, features competition for the national championships in many
events, seminars, a GREAT goodie store, and one of the most fun weeks
you'll experience.

     To join, you need to have a Porsche VIN number and be able to claim 
you're an owner, a co-owner, or hold a lease on a Porsche.  That may
seem restrictive, particularly if you want to join the club to get
access to Panorama, the club magazine, for purposes of FINDING a car...
In such case, it's suggested that you purchase a modest fraction of a
friend's car for say $5 or so, hence becoming a co-owner.  Just don't
tell them you did that or where you got the idea...

     Once you have a VIN number, there are four ways to join:

     1) Send a letter to the national office saying that you want to 
join, with your name, address, car info and a check for $36 to:

	Porsche Club of Americia.
	P.O. Box 10402
	Alexandria VA 22310

     2) Call them up at +1 703 922-9300, roughly between 9:00 to 5:00
EST (GMT - 6).  If you have your Visa/MC number *AND* your VIN number
handy, you can do it over the phone.  (Otherwise, they'll send you an
application which you can mail in with your check.)  This is the FASTEST
way, and if you need to be a member *RIGHT NOW* to go to an event that
is members only, this is your best bet.  Don't count on using this
method the week of or before Parade...

     3) find someone active in your local region.  *MANY* of the regions
are represented on the Porschephiles list, so that's a good place to
start.  Once you have found someone, get them to put you in touch with
the local region membership chair, they can give you the form, and off 
you go.

     4) National membership chair Nann Weissenberger is also on the
list, and is reachable via e-mail at "nannw@aol.com".  She'd be more 
than happy to help you out.

=======================================================================

How can I find out more about the car I own?

     If you own a North American Porsche, Porsche Cars North America 
will, for a fee of $20, research the original bill of sale for your car
and give you a Certificate of Authenticity stating the facts and 
figures for the car as it was delivered to the dealer.  If you're 
interested, contact: 
          Howard Adams
          PCNA
          P.O. Box 30911
          Reno Nevada 89520-3911
Include a copy of your title or registration as proof of ownership.
It takes 2-3 weeks depending on backlog.  A similar service is
available in Great Britain from Porsche Cars Great Britain, for about
30 pounds Sterling.  Porsche AG can also perform a similar search.

     It's also possible to get dealers to run a search for warranty and
other repairs for your car.  Some authorized dealers will search PCNA 
files for warranty and other maintenance records on specific cars.  
This data base apparently only goes back to sometime in the mid-1980s.  
It's not known how widespread this practice is among dealers; some will 
search only for warranty work done, while others also provide 
information about routine maintenance and repairs.  Ask your dealer.

What are the model numbers of cars related to the Porsche name?

     The following list was extracted from _Illustrated_Porsche_Buyers_
Guide_, _Porsche_Specials_, _Cars_Are_My_Life_, _We_At_Porsche_, and
the article "Project Porsche, The Early Years" in the June '83 issue of
_Thoroughbred_&_Classic_Car_.  It includes only more or less complete 
automobiles designed by Ferdinand Porsche or by the Porsche factory.  
Components (engines, transmissions, etc.) have not been included.  
The list is incomplete, in part because there has apparently been 
imperfect record keeping at the factory.  In addition, the nature of the
list has changed over the years from an in-house listing of project 
numbers to a market-driven listing.  Additions and corrections are 
welcomed:

What Porsche model/year/variant should I buy?
 
     General answer:  Buy the latest one you can afford of the model you
like.  Within models, there are certain years that are generally thought
of as more reliable or otherwise desirable, and others that have proved
troublesome over the years.  If you have questions about a particular
model, ask the list.  (We are looking for contributors to write about 
specific models.  Contributions, which may be too lengthy to include 
here, will be stored at tta.com and available via FTP.  Dave Darling has
gotten the ball rolling with a summary for the 914.  Feel free to 
contribute regarding your favorite model.)

=======================================================================

What kinds of racing events can I run my car in?

     There are several kinds of events organized and run by Porsche
clubs and organizations:

     Autocrosses.  These normally occur in a large parking lot or other 
relatively flat, open area.  The lot is filled with traffic cones that 
define a course.  Only 2 or 3 cars are on the course at the same time, 
and never at the same location on the course.  You race against the 
clock, and your times are compared to others in your class.  Classes 
are organized so that you compete against similarly-configured cars of 
about equal capability, ranging from box-stock to extensively modified.
Autocrossing is probably the safest and cheapest way to go fast in your 
Porsche (or any other car for that matter).  In some parts of the 
country, autocrosses are called slaloms.

     Time Trials.  These are also timed events, but they usually take
place on an actual race course.  They are often held in conjunction
with Track Events.  The time trial, like the autocross, is not against
other cars at the same time but against a clock.

     Driver's Education.  These events are held at a race track (but not
during a formal race meeting).  Multiple cars are on the track at the 
same time.  Instructors ride with the students, who are taught to drive 
at speed safely.  The US PCA has a basic set of rules and various PCA 
regions have their own rules which don't differ much from each other.  
Usually, the only modification to the car is a fire extinguisher that is
mounted metal to metal.  Students and instructors must wear an approved 
helmet.  

     PCA Club Racing.  This is racing in the traditional sense, in that
there's a full complement of cars, a definite start and finish, and
head-to-head racing.  The concept is similar to the various vintage
racing events that are becoming so popular; the idea is to preserve your
car and those of others while racing against each other.  If you don't 
race responsibly, you are not allowed to race.  There's a policy
governing this that is referred to as the 13/13 rule.  Under this rule,
if a driver is judged to be at fault in an incident that results in
damage to his car or another (no matter how small), he's out of that
particular event  and on probation for the next 13 months.  If in that
probation period that driver is again determined to be at fault in
another incident with damage, he's out of club racing for the next 13
months.  Equipment requirements include the fire extinguisher, a cut
off switch, an approved roll bar, and a five point seat belt harness.
There are several of these around the country.  You should have 
experience with autocross and driver's education events under your 
belt before you jump into this kind of racing.  Contact your local
club racing officials to get copies of rules, needed equipment, etc.

What are some of the major Porsche aftermarket suppliers?

     Be aware when buying a part in the aftermarket that it may or may
not be the same part you would get from Porsche.  This holds true even
when the part carries the "correct" Porsche part number, and when it
carries Porsche's parts trademark.  The following suppliers, listed

What references are available for information about Porsches?

     There are many books and manuals available, and the right one for 
you depends a lot on your interests and your particular car.  Porsche
publishes a Workshop Manual for all late model cars, as well as
various Technical Specification booklets.  Your local dealership's
parts manager can show you a catalog of technical literature
available from PCNA.

     The Porsche Club of America periodically assembles all of the 
technical articles which have appeared in Panorama into a new volume of 
their Upfixin der Porsche series.  These are available from PCA's 
executive office.

     What follows is a list of some of the more popular and often-cited
books.  This list is not exhaustive, but provides a starting point.  If 
you want information about other books, ask the list.  (Note: there's 
not much information about water-cooled cars; those with favorites 
should submit them to the name at the end of this FAQ.)

Should I use an oil additive in my Porsche engine?

     This is Stan's response:  "Duralube, Slick-50, and *EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ISN'T JUST PLAIN OIL* is, to be blunt, snake oil.  Or as Bruce 
Anderson commented about something else, "a cash flow device."  Slick-50
is *evil* if you have an engine with an aluminium case.  Guess what we 
all have, eh?  There is a bit of info on it via anonymous FTP in tta.com
in /pub/porschephiles/MiscInfo.  Additionally, many of these additives 
use teflon.  DuPont (the inventors of Teflon) have stated categorically 
that teflon is useless in such applications."
 
=======================================================================

Can I reach Bruce Anderson (or other renowned Porsche people) here?
 
     Yes. There are many luminaries in the Porsche world on this list.
If something is relevant to them, they'll typically respond to you
privately.  Their participation is greatly valued, so respect their
privacy and don't try to draw them out in the open.  If they want to
say something to the list as a whole, they'll do so.

=======================================================================

Where can I get a copy of the latest version of this FAQ?

     The FAQ is stored on tta.com in the /pub/porschephiles/FAQs 
directory, filename general-FAQ.  The version stored there will be 
the same one sent out monthly.  (There's also a FAQ that's specific to
the 914; other specific FAQs are welcomed, if anyone wants to contribute
to the archives.)

=======================================================================

Who maintains this FAQ?

     The FAQ is maintained by Walt Thode (thode@nprdc.navy.mil).  I have
a 1972 911T as my daily driver.  Anyone who wants to contribute should 
do so.  Contributions, revisions, and suggestions for new items are 
always welcomed.  I peruse the list for potential additions, but I don't
promise to find everything you might want in the FAQ.  Don't be shy 
about sending suggestions directly to me.

Subject: Re: Good Bye friends....

I just want to comment on the situation Lou Nicotra describes, as it's
always sad to lose someone from the list:  

Lou wrote:"Well, the bean counters are after me.... Just been notified that
there
are going to start charging for mail that comes over the Internet. I have
been asked to remove my name from the list. I'm sure most of you know that
live in a corporate world know how it is."

I guess a lot of people on the list have Internet access through work, and
feel that they couldn't possibly afford it if they had to pay for it
themselves.  Depending on your situation, this may be way off the mark, so
long as you know where to look. I'm not an Intenet expert (see Stan for
that), but I can shed some light on the home Internet setup:

What you need:

1) a phone line
2) a computer
3) a modem
4) a (good) piece of software
5) an Internet provider
6) discipline to avoid spending all your time on the net

What it costs:

1: you already have one, I presume
2: if you already have one, great! O/wise $1-2k
3: no more than $150 for 9600/14.4k
4: $0-$100
5: As little as $18/month (unlimited use)
6: $0

Admittedly, if you  don't have a computer at home it's hard to justify
getting set up.  But if you do, or you've been thinking of buying one, the
prices are really quite reasonable, especially if you live in a large
metroploitan area where your Internet access provider is only a local phone
call away.

As an example, I use a Mac, a high-speed modem, Eudora (great software!)
and I pay $17.50/month for unlimited Internet access in the SF Bay Area. 
Plus, it isn't a distraction at work. It sure beats cable! :)

So for those of you who may be losing their list access through work due to
corporate purse-string tightening, or those who might like to use that
computer that's lying around idly at home, consult your nearest computer /
Internet guru (not me, please!) and enjoy the list from the comfort of your
home!

Subject: Re: Antifreeze and racing (long)

David asks:

>Is it suggested to use the Red Line *only* for racing, or is it *better* than
>'regular' anti-freeze for every day driver?

Let me answer with some personal experience.

WaterWetter improves the ability of your engine's cooling system to shed
heat.  It's a rather complicated subject (a recent issue of MBCA's STAR
magazine had good coverage), and I won't go in to how it works. Just think
of it as something that helps transfer more heat from the combustion
chambers to the coolant. It also (now, in liquid form, NOT the "salmon
eggs" of yore) has corrosion inhibitors.

As an example of how good this stuff is, consider my experience with a 3.6
liter "big-block" BMW motor putting out (dyno'd) 275hp:

I used to run very high concentrations of anti-freeze (I know, I know) in
my motors because of my fear of corrosion (I've since stuck to 50-50 mix).
Anyway, at the time this motor was running about 90% anti-freeze
(Shellzone) and 10% distilled water, and it was running a wee bit hotter
than I liked (let's say at 5/8 of full-scale; sorry, I don't have a
calibrated gauge).  So I put a dose of WatterWetter in it, and went for a
test drive.  The engine overheated almost at once! The effect was dramatic
and unambiguous.

I wondered what was going on, as I limped home.  After some conversations
with RedLine I was able to confirm the (in hindsight) obvious - since
Antifreeze is a poor heat conductor (much worse than water), the
WatterWetter in the coolant was enabling more heat to get out of the
combustion chamber walls than the antifreeze could carry to the radiator
and get rid of.

The solution was to dump the whole mixture and start over, this time with
100% distilled water.  That gave a running temp of 1/2 of full-scale.
Adding WaterWetter brought it down to 1/4 (!). Then getting back up to
50-50 mix Antifreeze and distilled water keeps it at 5/16.

For about 5 years I've used a mix of 50% Shellzone, 50% distilled water,
plus a bottle of WaterWetter on all my water-cooled motors. Some are
all-aluminum (Alfa, Jag), and the others are iron-block, aluminum-head
(BMW, Mercedes).  In 150,000 miles I have seen absolutely no evidence of
corrosion - just the lightest white film on some water passageways.  I
don't see how the phosphate-free stuff would be better, but I may switch to
it for environmental reasons.  The WaterWetter definitely works for me, and
if I didn't have to worry at all about freezing temperatures I would run
just distilled  water and WaterWetter.

When I start racing (getting closer) my race car (an Alfa, sorry!) will run
distilled water and WaterWetter.

Subject: picking tires for 82 911 - need quick input

While prepping my car for drivers ed this weekend I determined
that my current tires are not up to snuff.

I have to order this afternoon to get the tires to the shop by
thurs am since that is the only time I can get in the shop
before the event.

I'm trying to pick between (listed in current preferential order)
yoko AVS-I, Dunflop SP8000, yoko A008P

I have an '82 911 targa which will see 2 track events and 2 autox's
a year *TOPS*.  I want a good high performance street tire which
will give me a good agressive but smooth ride and stick well, I'm
not interested in shaving off 1/10ths of a second off my lap time
(another 911 is on the boards for that maybe), and I don't want
to have to buy two sets of tires and year.

soliting input on my picks - esp diffs between the two yoko's

I have eagle-gt's right now which I hate.  they're a real "hard"
feeling tire but I don't feel they stick too well esp when the
road is a little bumpy (all roads are bumpy in cinti.).

    Sounds like you get to have the fun job of fixing a 914....  I
personally would try to get a helicoil or something in there.  Hopefully
it's one of those plugs where you can actually reach the hole through
the sheetmetal (not one of those ones that's angled like a bitch..)  I
have heard several tricks for trying to get a helicoil in without
disassembling the negine... the one I liked the best was filling up the
cylinder with shaving cream through the spark plug hole - the idea is
that you crank the engine over before you put the new plug in and all
the shavings come back out.
    Never had to do this, though, so I can't give a full Nate's
TechReport.  I think this experience of yours is a pretty good
advertisement for that aluminum anti-seize stuff... that was one of the
first things I did when I got my car (remove plugs and put on goo.)  I
may sound like I'm selling the stuff, but I'm not.. just after too much
engine work and too many brake jobs I have realized that the stuff is
indispensible.

Martin,

I have had the Dunlop SP 8000s and Yoko A008P on my car and I like
the Dunlops much better. They are quiet and stick better than the
Yokos in the dry. In the wet they are much. much better than the
Yokos.

I friend of mine that has had the Dunlops and the Yoko AVS says the
Dunlop is better in the wet and much better in the dry.

The Dunlops wear at about the same rate as the Yoko A008P and a
little faster than the Yoko AVS.

Unfortunately, that recommendation is at odds with Porsche's that spark
plug threads should be clean and dry when installed. Using a lubricant
means that more of the tightening torque goes toward stressing the
threads, less toward overcoming friction. The obvious answer is to use
less torque, but then you have the problem of plugs loosening if a lower
number is used without lubricant, etc, etc.

Liked the shaving cream idea, though.

What kind of brake pads do you currently have?  If they
are metalic they will tend to squeal on the street.
Several dealers advertised specials on Euroselect brake
pads in the latest Excellence.  You may want to try
some of these.  Officially, you can't get Euroselect parts
for your car, but your brakes are identical to the '88 951S.
I've had decent luck with the Repco pads for street use.

Yes, the anti-squeal goes on the back of the pad between it
and the caliper.  Never put anything between the front of the
pad and the rotor!

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Champlain Region

When You Wish Upon A Star - Part IV

Perhaps it was the sounds of Steve's rather psychotic girlfriend
(Jeez, I hope he isn't reading this) checking if the stove had
caught fire, perhaps it was Steve's foot in the small of my back, or
perhaps it was this magical force which had been trailing us, but
whatever the cause, John, Karl, and I were awake unusually early.
After showering and regaining full conciousness, I realized that a
nights sleep had wiped away our apprehension, and we were once again
filled with excitement.  We were not, however, filled with food.
After an initial look of horror from Steve's girlfriend at the
suggestion of breakfast, I ran around the corner to the police station
for some donuts. 

We spent much of the morning calling numbers on the lists we'd made
the previous evening, and making appointments.  Since Steve had left,
and his girlfriend had retreated to the bedroom to watch game shows
(after almost losing her hand reaching for a donut amidst the feeding
frenzy), we decided to make a few calls to Japan and Taiwan,
too. Actually, practical jokes were far from our minds at the time, we
were all focused most intently on the task before us. 

We each had our price range, and were naturally looking a little
beyond them as well.  Karl was hoping for a 78 or later SC, and I was
looking for a 73 or earlier S or T.  I didn't think I'd be able to
afford an S, and I was right.  Still, it didn't hurt to try.  By about
10AM, we had tried every number on both our lists, and headed out to
the now open used car lots.  These places were, almost without
exception, stereotype used car dealerships.  Counselor Troi from Star
Trek would have been screaming, "I sense deception!!" and
clutching her head in pain if she'd been with us.  In most cases, when
we politely pointed out falsehoods in such statements as, "never
been hit," and "totally original," the salesmen would back down.
One place, right out on Santa Monica, had such a high pressure sales
technique that we had to laugh in the guy's face.  He insisted that
Karl leave a deposit on a car, and we'd never seen it, in fact,
neither had the salesman.  We should have guessed this guy was a loser
after our exchange over an 80 SC in the lot. 

"How much for this car?" asked Karl.

"Eighteen thousand, but there may be some flexiblity in that.  The
car is, as you can see, mint." 

The three of us drew our breath in shock.  "Eighteen thousand?
Mint? It's been hit!" Karl said in amazement.  

"Hit?  Never.  Where do you think it's been hit?" said the
salesman with annoyance. 

"Right front and rear fender," muttered John.

"And what makes you say that?" the tone had turned condescending,
which for you novice salesmen out there is a real good sales
technique. 

"This is an aftermarket front fender, the paint isn't rippled
properly - there is no orange peel," said Karl, running his fingers
under the wheel well. I tried not to looked as confused as I was, it
seemed to me that if the paint wasn't peeling that should be good. 

"And there is a weld line right here where the rear fender was put
on," said John. Weld line, sure, I knew what that was, but I moved
over to check and make sure I could see it, too.   

The salesman inspected the weld and riposted, "It comes that way
from the factory."   

Now it seemed to me, as an outside observer, that if two guys were to
know enough to point out weld lines and paint rippling, that they
probably can't be bluffed.  At this point, a simple, "I never
realized it had been hit," or other clever lie could have easily
covered up the initial attempt at dishonesty, and make it seem as if
the dealer himself had been duped.  This had been the pervasive
strategy we encountered.  Sometimes the salesman would carry it as far
as thanking us for pointing these things out.  But here we had a
rather pathetic attempt at a bluff, which resulted in amused gapes
from the three of us.  Well, two of us, I was still trying to find the
peeling paint. 

"Well," he huffed.  "If you don't want this one, tell me what you want
and I'll find it for you." 

It was downhill from there.  After actually requesting a deposit on
this phantom car he promised to "find" (we later conjectured that
in dealer-speak this is slang for "steal"), he became so insistant
that we give him money that my ninja-type sixth sense began to tingle,
as it was getting pretty close to a stickup.  Our outright laughter at
his preposterous proposal finally wore him down, however, and he threw
up his hands in frustration and walked away - as if WE were at fault.

I shook my head and remarked, "What an idiot.  He probably didn't even
know what orange peel was!"  John and Karl nodded in dumbfounded
agreement.  It took us a few deep breaths to recompose ourselves
before we proceeded on. 

The excitement was now building again, and I was changing my pants at
almost hourly intervals.  After spending a disappointing morning in
the dealerships, we were on the road for our first appointment.  To
our surprise it turned out to be another used-car dealership.  In this
case we had expected it to be a private individual, and in fact the
guy Karl had spoken to on the phone had given this impression.  In
response to my rather accusatory tone, I was politely explained the
process of "consignments."  I learned a lot on this trip. 

The car we looked at was nice, it was an SC but there were numerous
mysteries about it.  John was quick to point out the lack of a true
Porsche VIN.  I was overjoyed at this moment, because I felt I was
starting to understand the process. The format of the Porsche VIN had
been the subject of one of the things I had read on the plane, and I
immediately recognized and corroborated John's analysis.  I was
quickly lost again when Karl pointed out the lack of a gamma device or
something that was supposed to come on an 1980 911.  I was still
trying to get the firing order straight (162435 had become my mantra.
I figured I needed some sort of mantra while I was in LA) and this guy
is noticing missing parts in the engine.  Finally we were able to
determine that it was a 2.7 litre engine that had been installed in
this 80 chassis. 

"Ah yes," I said, still completely mystified as to how anyone could
know an engine was 2.7 and not 3 litres.  "The 2.7 engines have a
tendency to overheat and warp. 162435"  

The dealer eyed me suspiciously, but John was nodding and I was
floating once again in the realm of the knowledgeable.  We drove away
from this lot proud that we were still on top of these bozos trying to
sell cars for what they weren't.   

Our next stop was our first dealing with a human being.  It was too
bad, though, because we had dismissed the car before we even met him.
We got out of the car, and I went to the door while John and Karl
attacked the car.  It was a red 911T, a 73, parked on the street.  It
was one of my prospects.  By the time the owner and I arrived at the
scene, Karl was sliding his head out from under the car, and giving me
the secret signal for a bad car (our secret signal was a complex
combination of semaphore and verbal signals which involved violent
shaking of the head, a disappointed clucking, and the words, "No
way"). 

Our host, clearly some cryptography expert for the NSA, cracked our
code in no time.  He was taken aback.  "What's wrong?  This car is
great!  Is there something wrong with it?  Tell me." 

Karl pointed at a round hole in the underside of the car. "The torsion
bar caps have somehow come off.  Your torsion bars could just slide
right out, not to mention rust.  I've never seen anything like it."

The owner looked confused and I saw my chance at showing off some of
my newfound knowledge.  "The 911, unlike most cars, uses torsion bars
instead of coilover springs.  162435." 

The owner glared at me like I was some sort of idiot, but he
coudln't bring me down.  We moved on. 

We finally found Orange county, which had been the location of many of
the appointments we had for the later afternoon and early evening.  We
had been having a lot of trouble finding it, but it turned out to be
the same color as the rest of LA, and this is what had been throwing
us off. 

We found a nice sized mall, which proved to us once and for all that
we weren't in another country.  The mall was centrally located to
all our appointments, not to mention an abundance teenagers.  These
kids were at that obnoxious age where they think that everything in
the world is sooooooo stupid except for their pathetic little social
circles.  We had fun laughing at their trivial little lives, after
all, we were buying Porsches;  Clearly everything else was stupid.
So, like, nya, nya, or whateverrrrr. 

The mall had everything we needed: payphones, fast food, and tables on
which we could spread out our maps and notes.   We established a base
of operations here, made a few more phone calls, and planned an
optimal travel schedule.  With luck we would see many cars that
afternoon.  I sank my teeth into a Big Mac and envisioned my new car.
I felt sure I would see it today.  Faint strains of music were
drifting over from a "film your own music video" shop.  Listening
carefully I realized it was Suzanne Vega.

This can become a serious problem. You need to timesert or helicoil the
head, and the only way you can get access to do that is to drop the engine
and usually you also have to take off the sheet metal. If you do that,
this is also a great oportunity to clean the engine up a bit, replace
the oil cooler seals ($0.75 parts with $300 labor charge attached if you
have to pay someone to do them with the engine still in the car), etc.

Also be very careful on this. The tiny metal shavings can stick to the pistons
and cause hot spots which can cause preignition or possibly burn the 
pistons. Not to mention the trouble you can get into if they stick 
between the valve and valve seat... Be *VERY* careful with this proceedure.

That's a good start.

This is approximately correct. You'll get a synergistic effect if you do it
in this order, i.e. better shocks are needd for the better sway bars to 
matter, etc. Doing it out-of-order is not recommended.

Well, this is where it's time to insert the "so what do you *REALLY* want to
do" message. If you're going to drive the car on the track and at autocrosses,
there is the concept of "classification". Certain changes move you from one
class to another. Before you make *ANY* changes, be **CERTAIN** that you
understand the classification impact of the change, and that you can live
with it. For instance, you'd run in A Stock in SCCA. IF you change the
sway bars, you'll pop to A Street Prepared where you'll pretty much look 
like meat to the Scott Jessen's of the world. In PCA, your classification
varies by region. Most places, that would at least bump you up into Improved
and a few more points would have you running with the purpose-built cars...

Shocks are typically "free". You can use whatever you like. I personally
like Bilstein or Koni Yellow for full race cars, Koni Red for most
street applications, and (oddly enough) KYBs for 914s that are mainly
street with some autox. For grins, I ran KYBs on my 911 autox car for
a while. They're OK, but you need a new set once a year...

You might be. Here's the deal: it sounds like you've been reading too
many of the slick aftermarket catalogs and the slick magazines. You really
don't have to do all this stuff to be FAST; you don't even have to be
FAST to have fun. There's *NO WAY* that Joe Average can "buy" his way
into the winner's circle. I've watched some of the old timers lap the
field in race cars that I wouldn't have bought as parts cars. The main
thing is SEAT TIME. I'd spend every nickle I could on two things: make
sure the car is safe and mechanically sound to or exceeding factory spec;
then go to every event in driving distance. You ought to be able to hit
at least 3 autox events a month between PCA and SCCA unless you live like
in Pandale, TX, or something (look it up on a map and you'll see what I
mean...).

This "ruling" is contrary to what I had been led to believe (i.e., PCNA
is very good about fixing problems and they are aware of this problem
and will fix it if it occurs, blah, blah, blah...)

What's the deal here? Not *ENOUGH* oil leaking? OK, they recommend not
fixing it, but *WILL* PCNA fix it? That is the question.

Is the once-proud owner happy with this decision?

I'm having an inspection done on my future C2 this week and I'm holding
my breath 'til I find out about any oil leaks.

Hey guys, should I have a leak-down test done on a car as new as a '90 C2?

Contrary to what agents might say, the policy actually says what it covers.
Failure to pay valid claims is actionable, in much the same way that
attempts to file fraudulent claims is actionable, but you should realize
that the insurance company has lawyers (and perhaps judges) on retainer.
You would be far better off dealing with an insurance company that is 
familiar with the actual meaning of the language in their policies - these 
can be hard to find, but it's better than having to depend on a court 
to understand and correctly interpret the policy... Good luck!

Subject: Rent a Porsche for the track!

Hi,

I do not have any connection to this business (except friendship)
and am providing this info as a public service.

    Lots of people would like to drive a Porsche at a race track, or
actually run in PCA or SCCA racing, but do not want to use their own
Porsche because of several reasons (paint chips, tires, wrong model, race
preparation, etc). There is an alternative to driving your own car - you
can rent a Porsche!

    Customer Driven Motorsports in Connecticut has a 911 Carrera
which can be driven at PCA driver's education, and a 944 Turbo which
is race-prepared and can be driven in any event including PCA club
racing and SCCA road racing (and the 944 Turbo is really fast this year!).
Both of these cars are safe and well prepared.

    Any of the Northeast tracks are available. Ralph has a new HUGE
motorhome which you have full access to, and will instruct you himself if
you desire. He has an SCCA and PCA racing license and is a PCA instructor.

   You can call Ralph evenings (before 9:00PM eastern time) at (203)
828-5930.
I think this is a relatively inexpensive way to find out if you really want
to get into track driving, or to do more serious driving if you are already
experienced. EMAIL me your snail mail address and Ralph will mail you
more information.

Sure did.   May have paid a bit too much for it (not sure) and
I screwed up the deal for some "extras" but I think I did well
otherwise.

The main thing in my mind is that the guy's at Robson gave it
a clean bill of health (i.e. good compression and other 
stuff).

Why do you ask?   Are you in this area?

Know much about the PCA Rennsport Region?   I don't, have heard

Well, I can't compare, per se, since I have nothing to compare against, but they 
do quite a job lighting up the roadway. The lowbeams have a noticable gradient - 
bright light down low, and a very distinct, narrow lighter beam above it. The 
high-beams seem to be pure light. The faces of the lenses are almost flat, very 
unlike the standard sealed-beam curvature.

The box does have pictures showing the light patterns, but I'm not sure if I have 
anything showing the euro pattern. I'll have to check.

	German, unlike English, doesn't have silent trailing "e"s.  Thus, 
the ending "e" in "Porsche" is pronounced--the "ah" sound.

The use of rear tail without an appropriate front spoiler will cause the 
front wheels to get light. This happens at over 120 as with my carrera. 
Turbo tail no front lip type spoiler.

You also need addtional downforce in front.

Roger,

I took my car once to Automotive Pit Stop in Sherman Oaks. Hans and

priced. Their number is 818-784-5197.

Since you will be driving a Carrera, it won't take you too long to
get to LA anyway. :-) I've asked about recommened mechanics in LA a 
while back, here is the kind responses from the group:

(note: info referenced/copied without permission)

	"I don't know if this is close enough to you or not, but I have used

	(LaCienega & Airdome) 310-652-6178, ask for Bob, it's his place.  
	I frequently stop by with any little problem that comes up and he 
	will take the time to check it out, sometimes even putting it up 
	on the rack just to take a look.  If you love your car this is 
	the place. Good luck!"


	"Have had previous experience with PorscheShop (or is it Factory?) 
	in Marina Del Rey area - it has been a few years tho'.  Now using 
	Scientifc Automotive in Pasadena with no complaints."


	"The garage I take my car to is Lomita 911 Services.  Owned by 
	Dieter Shoepflin in Harbor City 310-534-3631.  Dieter is excellent 
	technically and he is the MOST honost business man I've delt with.  
	I've used him for the past 8 years.  Some other friends I know have 
	been using him for the past 20 years."

So, my question for the wisdom of the porschephiles is this:

Should any 944 owners be thinking about changing these seals as a

Subject: Re: Drivers' Ed & Insurance P...

John, in MA all ins. co. have to play by the exact same rules, so with this
in mind let me tell you what happen to me last year and how I handled my
mishap.
     While driving in a drivers ed event I got a little loose and as the car
came around the car behind me clip the rear bumper and exhaust pipe.  The
force was enough to cause the left rear qt to buckle, plus the damage to my
muffler and rear bumper.  The damage to the car that clip me was a lot worse.
 Starting at the drivers door and back including his left rear wheel and
quarter.  (Note:  At the same event a 944 went into the wall broadside)  I
made a point of getting all the event papers including insurance papers from
the organizers that detail this event as a Drivers Ed. Event and submitted
them along with my accident report.  Apox. 10 days later I call the Ins.
Co.(Arbella) to see when they are going to send a check.  The claims adjuster
tells me that they have to look into this in more detail since I was on a
race track they fell that I may have been racing.  I tell her that this is
fine and I will check back with her in 2 days.  When I call back I am told
that the claim is being denied because this type of accident is not covered.
 When I ask her to what exclusion she is refering to, she tells me that the
policy does not cover racing. When I asked her how she came to the conclusion
that I was racing she said that since I was wearing a safety belt and a
helmet that it was racing.  I asked her if she had read the mat'l that I had
supplied, and she said that she had but because it said that the word racing
was not to be used then I must have been racing.  After some debate I told
her that I knew of a claim that they had paid under the exact same
cirumstance last year and that if she would review that claim then maybe she
would reverse her decision.  The alterative would be a 93A law suit filed by
me. (93A in MA allows you to collect 3 times your damages plus atty fees.)
 She said she would look up the claim and for me to call her back in a couple
of days.  I should note here that the claim I am referring to did require a 93
A action to resolve.       When I did get back to her, expecting her to now
reverse her decision she told me that she was still rejecting my claim
because that were not the same.  When I asked her what was different about the
 2 claims she said that in the other claim the driver was alone.  I told her
that he was not alone (Bridgehampton) and that the circumstances were exactly
the same, she claims that had they know that they never would have paid the
claim.  I asked her what other drivers on the course had to do with it, and
she said that since it was suppose to be a drivers ed event there should not
have been any other car on the course.  I asked her if she had gone to
drivers school when she was getting her license and she repled yes.  I then
ask her if they had closed down the local roads and highways while she was
being taught, she said no, but she still didn't get the point.
     I told her that if she didn't reverse herself that once I filed the
court action that I would not accept just the face value of the claim.  She
said that she had already talked to the company atty. and that she was holding
 her ground.  I filed the claim and the day after they recieved notice they
settled saying that I still wasn't covered but that they were making a
business decision.  I settled for double the claim without going to court. 
This whole action took from Sept. 94 to Feb. 95.  There were a lot of
conversions that I left out, but would be glad to relay if anyone would like
to call me.

P.S. Remember that 944 that went into the wall at the same event that I had
my mishap at.  The same Ins. Co. insured him. He had his check within 15 days
without any hassle.

Hi,
        We are on the verge of buying a used 1988 924s with about 68,000 miles.
We haven't found any reviews of the car in the used car books, so we are desperate
for information. Can anyone tell us about the reliability/maintenance cost and what
would be a reasonable price for such a car (in good shape)? Also, what should we
look for when checking the car out, test driving it? And does anyone have any
recommendations for mechanics to check it out (in the Albuquerque area) or even
general suggestions, like whether we should have it checked out by a mechanic at
a Porsche dealer? Thanks!!

Funny you should suggest this...since my water pump seized at last year's
Parade on the way from the hotel to the Autocross site....sounds good in
theory. I wished at the time the courteous NY state policeman was radio-ing
for a flatbed that I had just changed my water pump!

(Hot tip...if you do not have a "towing eye" for you pride and joy, get
thee to a Porsche dealer and order one to keep in your tool kit in the car
when travelling (just in case). Plus, I find I almost never need the piece
of emergency equipment I have, and always need the one I don't have! They
are the ONLY way to safely tow a p-car onto a flatbed).

Also reminds me of a (serious) proposal I read about: during WWII there
were a few imprompty appendectomies on US submarines performed by
pharmacist mates (read people trained in basic first aid--not surgeons!)
because of appendicitis striking during a war patrol (usually about 60 days
long). So the proposal was to remove all submarine force crews' appendixes
to eliminate the chance of appendicitis! Needless to say, this was never
implemented...

My sense is that the cooler seal failures are not predictable, and you
might as well wait until the failure to replace them. I have not heard of
anyone replacing them as a prophylactic measure, but it is a novel
idea...any other opinions among our more mechanically experienced 'philes?

Hope to see you at the Parade..

Subject: Should I sell ?


Hello from snow country fellow Porsche fans,

It is with a great deal of indecision that I ask the experts out there 
for advice.

A few years back I bought my first car, a 1970 911t.  Since that day I 
eat, breath, and well you know, Porsche.  However, I am only 22 years old 
and it has come time for me to go back to school ( Queen's Arts '94, Cha Gheil 
fellow alumnus ).  I think that I can survive the upcoming financial 
crunch and still keep my precious.  But my monetary situation would be 
eased with an extra several K in my pocket.

For a 70 911t my car is in really good shape and all original.  Obviously 
I have many years to make my mark and plan to drive only 911s until the 
day I die.

My question is, should I go for the financial security now and get 
another 911 later, or should I live in squalor and keep the 70 ?

p.s. I've been eyeing a 83 911sc as a possible replacement.

Any help would be very much appreciated.

Hi Clint,

I concur with what the others have written regaring oil on the timing belt. 
 I
would add, in case no one else has already, that it is very common for
the cam and balance shaft radial oil seals to leak, and that when they do
so, they really ought to be replaced.

I remove the idler pulley, for exactly the reason you describe.  I
have not found it necessary to remove the pump rail though.  Are you
working from above (by removing the air filter box and air flow
meter), or trying to do it from underneath?  The former approach is
much easier, at least on the turbos.

I was able to replace the rear cam housing gasket on my '951 without
pulling the entire housing.  It is basically just a matter of removing
the three bolts (probably 10mm) that hold the cap (and engine
transport hook) on.  The clearance is pretty tight, but patience and
lots of wrench repositioning will do the trick.

Although it was a few years ago that I made this repair, I still
remember being thrilled by the fact the replacement gasket only cost 87
cents, which was the least expensive part I had ever purchased for the
car.

Have you thought about a personal account with one of the service providers.
It is nice to have access to the net that isn't available to the snooping
of any employer. Imagine only being able to send/receive paper mail through
your workplace. Netcom costs me $17.50 a month. Have used it to find jobs,
as well as get info about bikes and cars. I think it's cost effective.

Just a thought.

It's not quite like that everywhere... Companies I knew of in the UK
particularly made oil for a certain vendor totally dependent on price, additive
pack, viscosity additives etc. Agreed they probably used the same base but 
the characteristics of the oil were not the same as their standard product. 

On the other hand, Halfords (major chain of parts/accessories shops) is owned by 
Castrol and they certainly use GTX and re-package it under the Halfords name.

So what's the conclusion, there is none IMO. Generally, you pays yer money!

Cool pictures of a 904 and a also a 917 coming down the "esses" 
at Laguna.   _Lots_ of 911s.   Kewel!

If anyone cares about such things it is well worth the $20 or so 
that they are asking for it.

Couldn't get the chessy Win16 binaries to install on NT properly 
but the images are in .PCD format anyway so it doesn't matter 
what OS your running provided you can read .PCD files.   The CD 
is also usable with Mac (w/ binaries?), at least the manual says 
so.

These are not pro quality .pcd files, it's only consumer grade

Subject: 944 balance shaft seals - How?


I'd like clarification on what is meant by 'replacing the balance shaft 
seals'. Correct me if I'm wrong but here is my understanding of how the 
seals work:

          ----'' 
           A       B      C       D
 
A = Bal. shaft sprocket   B = shaft seal    C = spacer   D = polyester seal
 
1. To replace the seals, is it just a matter of replacing B, C, and D?
  
2. The manual mentions using a speacial tool (P9202) to drive in seal B? Is
   it really necessary? Is it easy to remove the seals once the sprocket is
   off?
 
3. Are there any special procedures for assembly? Haynes mentions putting
   assembly lube on the spacer and the manual mentions putting special oil
   on before inserting the sprocket. It also recommends the use of Loctite
   574 for the bolt. Are these all really necessary?
 
4. Can the seals and spacer be bought separately? I choked when I heard 
   the price of the seal kit was $150 - $190 cdn. I believe the kit 
   includes seals for cam, 2 balance shafts, crank, plus 3 metal spaces, 
   and 1 infamous camshaft bolt (I guess they expect you to strip the old 
   one). Can anyone confirm?

Any help would be appreciated.
 
BTW, I'll probably document all my experiences when this is all done.
 
Thanks.

    The statistic I remember is that a tail adds about 400 pounds of
  downforce at 150mph (that was for the early turbo tail, not for the
  3.3 "tray" tail). A tail probably looks better than 7 sacks of mortar
  mix on the rear end...

     Probably for most speeds, the tail is purely cosmetic. IMO on a targa
  they look bad (with the wraparound glass, a tail makes the back look
  awkward) but on a coupe they look good. I also prefer the early turbo or
  carrera tail over a the tray type on a non-flared car...but I like Yellow
  too (and beauty -is- in the eye of the beerholder....).

Subject: Advice on buying '86 944T


- --- I have not been able to find a 944 FAQ - I apologize if these
questions are answered somewhere else...

I am going to look at an '86 944T tonight.  The information I have
about it so far is:
	Black (repainted once due to stone chips - a "nice job"
		according to seller)
	pearl leather interior
	137K miles
	well serviced, has all records.
	new turbo (how often do the turbos need to be replaced?)
	updated motor mounts
	4 16" BFG tires (don't know what version)
	stock (no chips/upgrades/etc)
	asking $7900.


I want to use the car as a second, "fun" car - not a daily driver.
Not for racing, but maybe some drivers ed courses on the track (I
have done some of this in a quattro).  I would like to have someone
cheaper than the dealer maintain it, but don't know who yet - is there
a FAQ or a recommendation for a mechanic in the
Baltimore/Annapolis/Columbia, MD area?

So:
	Is there anything in particular that I should look for in this
model/year car?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Is this a
reasonable price?  Is there a recommendation for a mechanic to do a
pre-purchase inspection in this area? (Baltimore/Annapolis/Columbia,
MD)

	I am on the digest, so a direct reply to jensen@mml.mmc.com
would be better.  In fact, if you send me the replies, I will put them
together in a list (a sort of rough FAQ) and make it available to
Stan, or post the summary to the list, as appropriate.

Subject:      914-4 Normal Operating Temp

I recently put an oil temp gauge in my '72 914-4.  The temp gauge reads from
about 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock with the red portion of the dial at the 2
o'clock position.  I have taken the 914 out for drives in the country and
at about 60 mph, it takes about 15 miles for the oil temp gauge to reach
a stabilized position with the needle pointing at approximately 1:00 on the
gauge face.

Questions please:
  1.  Is it normal to take this many miles at this speed to reach normal
      operating temperature?
  2.  Is the (approximately) 1:00 position correct for normal operating
      temperature on a 914-4 using oem gauges from a 1974 914?

This is something that you'll have to decide for yourself in the
end.  But, I can tell you what I'm doing in a similar situation.
I'm quiting my job at the end of the summer and heading off to 
school to pursue my final graduate degree.  I managed to pay of
my Porsche a couple of weeks ago.  At one time I thought it would
be best to sell the car when I head off to school, but now I've
decided I'd rather not live without it.  

The logical arguement for keeping your Porsche is that your Porsche 
shouldn't loose value over the next few years, assuming you keep 
it in good shape.  If things get tight enough you should be able 
to sell it fairly quickly, though you may have to take less than you
think it's worth.  The biggest question in this case is can you afford 
to maintain it.  (This is what student loans are for, right:)

>p.s. I've been eyeing a 83 911sc as a possible replacement.

If you can use the SC as a daily driver this isn't a bad plan, but 
I would think it would take a bit of $$$ along with the value of
your 911T to get a decent SC.

>Any help would be very much appreciated.

Like I said above, in the end only you know your financial ability.

Good luck,

Subject: 944 CV Joint FAQ Entry (Preliminary)

Greetings fellow Porschephiles

Finished cleaning, repacking, and swapping my 944's CV joints last weekend, a project 
that I had started the weekend before but ran out of time.

In response to several requests I have written up a FAQ entry on CV joints, and
hereby submit it for consideration.  Criticism, suggestions, and erratta would be 
appreciated.

Ed Gibbs
gibbs@avionics.itt.com
'84 944, Guards Red, All Mine, nice clean, greasy CV joints

Preliminary 944 Constant (CV) Velocity Joint Maintenance FAQ Entry

Q:	What are CV joints and where are they located?

A:	CV Joints are similar to the universal joints used on some cars.  
	They connect the transaxle to the axles and the axles to the drive 
	wheels, transferring power while allowing for up and down motion
	of the suspension.  If you look under the rear of your 944 you will
	see black rubber boots on the either end of both axles.  These boots 
	enclose the CV joints, and keep the grease that lubricates them from
	running out.

Q:	What maintenace do CV joints require?

	The rubber boots protecting the CV joints should be inspected at each oil 
	change, and replaced if any cuts, tears, or damage is noted.  A leaking boot
	will allow the grease to run out, resulting in very rapid failure of the CV 
	joint.  Replacement of the boot requires removal of the boot, but is well 
	worth the effort.

	The joints should be periodically removed, cleaned, inspected, repacked
	with grease, and reinstalled.  In addition, some people recommend switching
	the joints from left to right and vice versa on a periodic basis.  This is
	due to the fact that wear on the joints tends to be directional, based upon
	the loading imposed during forward travel.  By swapping the joints to even 
	the wear their life can be extended.  Since new CV joints from Porsche cost
	approx. $150 each and there are four CV joints this seems like a worthwhile 
	idea.

A:	How do I know if my CV joints are bad?

	The most common sympthom is a clicking noise heard from the rear of the car,
	especially during cornering.  The noise will usually come from one side only,
	usually the side opposite the direction of the turn.  If you have any doubt, 
	take them apart and check them out yourself.

Q:	How long does it take to remove, clean, repack, and reinstall all four joints?

A:	First time, budget 7-8 hours, barring too many problems.  Will take considerably
	less time with practice.  The process is not difficult, provided the proper tools 
	are available (see below) but patience is required, especially in the cleaning 
	stage.

Q:	What is the CV Joint Removal/Cleaning/Inspection/Replacement procedure

A:	The Haynes 944 book has a very good description of the process, and it should be 
	consulted first.  If you don't have it, get it!  

	Tools required:

	8mm 12 point Allen head socket
		Note:	This tool is available from Performance Products, Automotion 
			and other sources for about $20.  Your local auto parts store 
			may carry a cheaper version for about $6.50.  The cheap 
			version requires you to use your own 8 mm socket, but is nice
			because it is about three inches long, to help clear the 
			rubber boot when removing the CV joint bolts.
	Breaker bar
	Torque wrench capable of measuring 30 ft/lbs
	Slip joint pliers or large vise grips
	Various sized sockets
	Hammer
	Punch or screwdriver
	Scribe (carbide-tipped)
	Parts cleaning tray
	Parts cleaning brushes
	External snap ring pliers (Snap-On part number PR-40, $22.95 or equivalent).  
		NOTE:  	External Circlip pliers (for clips with holes) may work, but 
			only with extreme difficulty and much cussing.  The correct type
			of pliers has two undercut metal tabs facing outward that hook
			under the ends of the ring and expand it like this:

				 *		 *
				  **	       **
				   **         **    <-----Tabs - rectangular   
				   ***       ***		 cross-section, not round! 
				********* *********
				********* ********* <-----Plier jaws
				********* *********
				********* *********

	Consumables:

	Solvent (mineral spirits)
	Spray brake cleaner
	Rags/paper towels (lots!)
	CV Joint grease (moly based grease, available at auto parts stores)

Procedure:

1.	Raise the rear of the car and support it securely with jack stands or ramps.
	Disconnect the battery and chock the front wheels.  

2.	Put car in neutral with	parking brake off.

3.	Clean all dirt, oil, and mung from center recesses on the 12 point allen head
	bolts holding the CV joints to the transaxle and wheels on one side of vehicle
	using spray brake cleaner and a pick or nail.  Mark axle with scribe to indicate 
	which end is inboard.

4.	Hold wheel from rotating with foot while using 8mm 12 point allen head socket 
	and breaker bar to just loosen all six bolts holding CV joint to transaxle, 
	rotating wheel as necessary to bring each bolt into position.
		NOTE:	If bolts are very tight, apply parking brake or put car in gear
			to hold wheel, loosen bolt, then release brake and put in neutral 
			to rotate wheel for each bolt.

5.	Repeat step 4 for bolts holding CV joint to wheel hub.

6.	Back 5 of six bolts on each CV joint out completely.  While supporting CV joints
	back out remaining bolts and carefully remove CV joints/axle assembly from 
	vehicle.

7.	Place assembly on newspapers on a clean, flat surface.

8.	Work around metal collars holding boots to joints with hammer and punch or 
	screwdriver to gently separate collars from joints.

9.	Wipe grease from ends of joints, and mark across axle, inner, and outer races
	with scribe to mark orientation of parts (IMPORTANT!)  Make one mark on inner
	joint, two on outer, to identify parts if they become separated.

10.	Use snap ring pliers to remove snap ring on end of axle.  Or, use circlip pliers
	to spread ring, small screwdriver to pry ring up, mouth to curse, and eyes to
	watch where ring lands if you are lucky enough to get it off.

11.	Push axle out of joint with thumbs, or if necessary drive out using a hammer
	and a small socket.

12.	Work concave washer off axle using slip joint pliers or vise grips (see illus.
	in Haynes book).

13.	Carefully pull boot off axle.

14.	Disassemble joint by tilting inner race until inner race, ball bearings, and 
	retaining ring come out.  Keep parts together and label inner or outer and pass.
	or driver side.

15.	Clean all parts with solvent and brushes, including boots (if being resued) and 
	axles.  Take your time and do a good job.  Some greases are incompatible.  Unless
	you KNOW that you are using the same formulation of grease as was in your joint
	previously, try to get rid of ALL the old grease.  Save solvent for proper 
	disposal.

16.	Dry all parts thoroughly, removing ALL traces of solvent.  Inspect carefully
	for wear, burned areas, scoring, etc.  If in doubt, replace joint.  Inspect
	boots carefully for cracking, cut, rips, etc.  If in doubt, replace.

17.	Apply a small amount of CV joint grease to the inside of the boots.  Work into 
	the folds of the boots with your fingers.

18	Apply a small amount of CV joint grease to the ends of the axles, and carefully
	work the boots down over the axles.  The boots should go over the ribs machined
	into the axle to hold them in place.

19.	Reinstall the concave washers, using a deep socket to drive them on.  Or, use a 
	pair of vise grips, opened enough to sit on the washer without touching the axle,
	and hammer on the vise grips.  Washer must go all the way to the bottom of the 
	splined area.
		NOTE:	Washer goes on like this: \|AXLE|/, not like this: /|AXLE|\.

20.	Reassemble joints by putting inner races inside retaining rings, and snapping
	ball bearings into slots on retaining ring.  Insert inner race assembly into
	outer race by tilting in, ensuring that marks made during disassembly line up.

21.	Test operation:  Inner race should freely rock back and forth, while retaining
	ring remains locked to outer race.  If inner race is locked to outer race and
	retaining ring tilts freely, then joint is assembled improperly.  Correct before
	use!

22.	Lightly grease splines on axle and center holes on joints.  Reassemble joints

Subject: What's this Fund business

You 112 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-subscribers (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute:  The bank folks would
rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

Since I have *NO* idea what this "grey hose" stuff is, let me just tell
you what you *should* have.

You should have four kinds of fuel line in the car. I'll describe the
2.0 version. 1.7 is almost the same, 1.8 is similar but the exact fuel
line plumbing is a bit different...

1) hard plastic lines, two each. Run from the front of the car near
   the tank to the rear of the car under the battery, roughly. If
   they're in bad shape, you'll get gas in the center tunnel, and
   other Bad Things may happen... You *CAN* buy replacements for these
   things from Porsche, or you can run -06 or -08 Aeroquip...

2) metal fuel distribution lines, two each. These are the things attached
   directly to the injectors, with two connections and a center tap. One
   connection is "in", one is "out". On the battery side, the front is
   "in", the middle tap goes to the cold start, and the rear connection
   is "out", which goes to the rear connection on the relay board side,
   which is "in", and its forward connection goes to the fuel pressure 
   regulator.

3) 7mm hose. Black rubber, some kind of braided covering. From Wurth. 
   *ONLY* -- no "smooth rubber" hose, no substitutes. Can get it at any 
   VW,Porsche,Audi,etc. dealer, most Bosch distributors, most of the 
   aftermarket suppliers, and of course, Wurth direct. *MOST* of the 
   fuel line in the car is 7mm.

4) 9mm hose. See above for specs. This is used only in going from the 
   fuel pump to the tank, with the fuel filter acting as a "diameter
   converter". If I recall, it's used from the tank to the hard line
   on the supply side, with 7mm on the return. And it's used again
   from the hard line to the fuel filter, then everything else is 7mm.
   Could be wrong, though -- it's been a while since I've replaced 
   hoses on a stock 2.0...

Anyway, that's it. Key feature is that you *MUST* use lines rated for
fuel injection pressures, and gasline. *LOTS* of the stuff labled
"gas line" for American cars is very low pressure only, and will fail
in most entertaining ways....

Subject: Driver's Ed/Insurance

The Northern New Jersey Region of PCA was involved in litigation against an
insurance company that refused to pay on a claim.  The member was a
participant in an NNJR Driver Ed Event and was involved in a single car incide
nt.  He submitted a claim to his insurance company who promply claimed it was
"racing" and refused to honor the claim.  

This person then sued the insurance company.  The Driver's Ed Chairman,
President and Event Chief Instructor from NNJR testified on behalf of the
driver and also presented all the NNJR literature concerning Driver's Ed.
 The result was the court forced the insurance company to pay all claims.

The key areas of the defense were:

1. NNJR Drivers Ed is a non-timed event.  All timing devices of any kind,
either in or outside the car are strictly prohibited.

2. The sole purpose is to educate the entrant as to proper driving techniques
and improve driving ability.  We do not teach "speed" but teach "proper
driving techniques" at speed.

3. All entrants are grouped into "run groups" that are of similar skill level
and experience.  Thus novices are on the track with other novices, etc.

4. Passing is allowed only in designated areas of the track and the passee
informs the passer where and when to pass through the use of clearly defined
hand signals.  Any pass without a signal results in a black flag and
reprimand from the chief instructor.  Two such incidents in one event results
in ejection from the event.

5. An instructor must be with the novice driver at all times.  Only when a
driver has sufficient seat time (at this and previous events) and  has
demonstrated to the instructor an adequate skill level, is the student
"signed off" and allowed to solo. This "sign off" is only for the duration of
this particular event.

6. All entrants in the intermediate run groups are strongly urged (sometimes
forced) to utilize an instructor to hone their driving skills. 

7. Safety is the primary concern from rigid automobile pre-event and daily
safety inspections, required SA rated helmets, required on board fire
extinguishers,  to a strictly enforced "two spin rule" ( A spin is defined as
breaking a 90 degree angle to the direction of travel or dropping two wheels
off the track surface- Do this twice and you go home - even instructors)

8. All instructors must meet rigid training and skill level requirements. 

These were the main points of the defense.  Thus there is a precedent in New
Jersey. (This and $1.50 will buy you a cup of coffee.)  

Many insurance companies will not cover "off road" activities.  Driver's 
Ed may be considered such and thus fall into the crack.  I would suggest that
all entrants in driver education programs check with their insurance agent
prior to participating in any such event. 

There is a rumor that an insurance company is offering "single event"
coverage for either Drivers Education or PCA Racing.  I am trying to get more
information on the costs and extent of such coverage.  I will post my
findings.

If anyone has any additional questions, or I may of further service, please
give me a shout.

Thank you,

Hi All,

I designed my first auto-x course last weekend (actually I 
designed it 2 weeks ago, it just got run last weekend).

It was *really fun* (designing the course that is, *I* drove like
shit... - I now believe the theory that one never does well on a 
course one designs).

The Redwood Region is splitting up the workload this year and our
auto-x chairman has recruited people to each run one event.

I had some hesitation about running the event at first and agreed 
mostly because I felt "that I should."

I'm posting this because if anyone else is ever in this situation, 
just run the event!  You'll love it.

All you really need you to know you learned in kindergarten:

1)   Loud voice is good at recess (and driver's meeting!)

2)   Aimless crayon drawings (i) impress parents *and* (ii) make 
      killer auto-x courses.

3)   Share with your friends; some of them are closet course designers:
      "This cone's in the wrong place" (really means "I can't possibly make 
      this turn").  Okay, okay, the course was safer after I moved the cone.

4)  Don't forget your nap the night before - I was *beat* by the end of the
     day.

Subject: Re: Advice on buying '86 944T

james-

Some things to quickly qualify the car as a good prospect:

	1. When was the last water pump installed (they go bad ~2-3 years)
	2. Does it have the new style exhaust manifolds (willhave an obvious
	    bellows type shape in the manifold)
	3. When was the clutch last replaced (944T clutch life is ~30,000
miles)
	4. Have both motor mounts been replaced, when?
	   (they dry out, lose all their fluid and need replaced periodically)
	5. When was the last set of timing & balance shaft belts replaced?

		(should be done every two years or 30,000 miles whichever comes
		 first)
	6. WHen was the timing belts & balance shaft belts last adjusted?
	(should be annually or every 15,000 miles whichever is sooner)
	7. Turbos DO wear out. Depends on how they are taken care of.
	8. What type of oil was used & how frequently was it changed?
		(right answer: synthetic oil, every 2500-3000 miles )
	9. Have the wheel bearings been replaced yet (especially the rears-
	   they can get to be expensive)
	10. When were the rod bearings last replaced? (tend to last for about
	    50 hours of track use, suffer oil starvation problems, I do mine
	    every two years)
	11. CHeck ball joints (are integral part of lower control arms-- cost
	     about $1600 just for the parts)
	12. Transaxle- any problems shifting? Has the transaxle ever been
	    rebuilt?
	13. Head gaskets-- known weakness. Look for it in the records, maybe
have a leakdown test run on the car.


Maintenance records are worth a LOT. Proof of maintenance activity is worth
paying a premium for vs. a car with an unknown history. Check with the service
shop that did the work on the car-- they will know best what is right and wrong
about the car. A little effort and expense before you buy the car can save you
thousands after you have bought it. SPend a $100 or $200 and have a porsche
repair center you trust check the car out for you. Maintenance for these cars
can get painful.

good luck-

Subject: 993/New Turbo for TALL GUYS?

We of the headroom challenged sort (6'4") find the thought of new Porsches a
sore subject on our pointy little heads.   All the hair is gone off the top
of my head because I own a '90 C4 with a sunroof and the standard
semi-electric seats.  I tried to hunch down in the seat with my helmet on for
track events but gave that up as I have now reached middle-age and value
pain-free days.  I absolutely love driving various P-cars and have many racy
types in the garage that require less contortions with a helmet on than the
sunroof C4 in civilian clothes.  Of course none of the racy cars have
sunroofs.  They're also old and you have to truck them to intermediate or
distant track events.  A combo track/cruising setup that could be driven, to
say Mid-Ohio or Watkins Glen, tracked around, then driven home would be the
point of the exercise.

Somebody famous (can't remeber who) told me that sunroof-delete on newer
P-cars didn't buy much headroom since the sunroof tracks/framework had been
engineered within an inch of its life for improved roll-over protection and
was installed as an integral part of the roof on ALL 911s, sunroof or not.
 Is this essentially true?

I would dearly love to find a pleasing solution to the headroom dilemma so's
that I can realistically lust after a 993/C4 or a new Turbo.  I was able to
get a sunroof-delete on a '92 Audi S4 that converted it from undrivable in
any position to plenty of room for a helmet in one box on the order blank, so
maybe there is a way with Porsches too.  Maybe as a "special wish" for tall
guys.

Any and all tips would be appreciated.  The PAG-PCNA-Dealer chain is not
helpfully informative so far.  And since I am not in daily conversation with
the factory, you all are my only hope.

1969 912 Grey with Black interior, repainted with original color/paint
by previous owner. very good to excellent condition in/out. Originally 
purchased in CA and here ever since. I am the Third owner and have some
previous work reports prior to my ownership. Engine rebuilt(by previous
owner) around 20k ago. Runs very well/strong. Was compression tested about
1 year ago and I have the numbers and can get them to you tommorrow (If you
have an interest.) I have only put maybe 1k miles on since this test. 
More specifics: weber carbs (CA smoged also), Perlux ignitor, bursch exhaust,
(I have the original as well), K&N air cleaners, Flofit sport seats with
retractable belts, no tears but a small crack in the dash, AM/FM cass, 
Later model exterior rear view mirror, bronze phosphor pedal bushings,,etc,
etc. Everything works! Was originally delivered with A/C but compressor,
condensor, hoses have been removed. Dash a/c ducts are still installed, as is
the blower in the trunk area. Cookie cutters with new BFG tires, just 4
wheel aligned. This car is turn key and needs nothing. Any Interest?

alternate between straight and flat and then across a small hill
full of neat twisty corners (about 1100 ft elevation change).

Subject: 914 tail to side shift Xmission conversion

	Hey everyone! I've been just kind of hanging in the shadows
since I joined the list about a year ago, playing the part of an
informational sponge while I worked over my '71 914. I have my
transmission apart for a rebuild (new syncro bands and a new 1st gear
hub) and I am contemplating converting it to a side shift model while
it's out and apart. I've done some pricing and it looks like it will
cost around $250 for a functional conversion (using old tail shifter
rear cover) and around $450 for a complete change over. Can anyone
testify to the value of this conversion either way? I've never used a
side shift model, but I rarely ever had trouble finding the gears in
its previous worn out state. Will this be a worthwhile conversion for
the purely street driving I do, because I can think of several other
mods I can make for the money.If it is worthy of the $, do you also
have to replace the three shift rods inside the xmission which the
shift fork interacts with? The part #'s are different but they look
very similar (I know looks can be deceiving though). Did the dealers
replace these on "factory" conversions? Thanks in advance for reading
this and for any input you may have.

I think they're still quite good for the track and have lots of track mileage

Mike,
I too am sufficiently tall  at 6'3" to give up on my 911. My solution was to
but an 89 944 turbo. The car is large enough for us even with a sunroof and
has all the performance and performance potential that you will ever need.
Much easier to drive fast than a 911 based car. They are also an incredible
bargain.
If you insist on a 911 I know a good orthopedic surgeon.....

John,
Don't worry about the drive. I routinely drive my R1's to and from the track
or race events. I went from Philadelphia to Mid Ohio two years ago (500miles)
and the tires still had the mold feathers on them when I reached the track.
The only thing is make sure they are inflated to factory pressures and be set
for a bumpy ride.They certainly are not as smooth as the P700's I use for the
street. BTW they are great in the rain as I had that experience a few times.
(Look out for large standing puddles however).
The ride home is usually less pleasant because you will sometimes get the
tires a bit lumpy from track rubber that you pick up. Also there is always
the chance of a flat spot. You can think of all the fun you had on the way
home and that really helps the time fly.
Have fun, don't worry!!

Hi,

Last week I asked whether or not '73 911S have factory fender mounted oil
coolers.  Several people said that I should have one which puzzeld me since
my car showed no trace of ever having one.  Then I thougtht to ask Steve
Watson, who also has a '73 911S targa if he had one. He didn't. So it seems
as if the targas didn't get oil coolers whereas the coupes did.  I would like
to get a definitive answer. Could you please e-mail me with the following
info. I will compile the info and give my result by Friday

Model: coupe or targa
oil cooler: yes or no
and while we are at it: oil consumption
+ any other information you feel is relevant

Thank you very much.

Hi, Darren,

There are a couple of things that hold the mirror parts in place (on all
cars with electric mirrors).

1) The base of the mirror is attached to the door with a single bolt that
can be accessed by rotating the stem of the mirror towards the front. It may
be hidden by a small plastic plug.

2) The stem of the mirror is attached to the base by a hollow bolt in the
stem itself. It is accessed from the bottom of the base and requires a large
(12mm?) triple square 12-point internal wrench.  Of course, there are a few
wires running through this bolt, so you may have to remove the wires first.

3) The mirror motor is attached to the stem by three small bolts. To access
these bolts, you have to remove the mirror glass.

4) The mirror glass is attached to the mirror motor in one of two ways:

a) On older mirrors, there are three spring-loaded pins that simply friction
fit into corresponding holes on the motor.

b) On newer mirrors (for 944, 1985/2 and newer), there is a ring that locks
the mirror glass into place. The ring has a couple of notches at the bottom
of the glass. To release the mirror glass, tilt the glass up as high as it
will go without breaking, then use a small screwdriver to rotate the locking
ring from the bottom. 

That's all that I know about, based on my exhaustive analysis of 944
electric mirrors.

Good luck

I managed to toast one tire on my 915 at a recent track event

have another several days left on them and I'd like to avoid buying 1 or

Subject: What's this Fund business

You 112 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-subscribers (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute:  The bank folks would
rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

james-

Some things to quickly qualify the car as a good prospect:

        1. When was the last water pump installed (they go bad ~2-3 years)
        2. Does it have the new style exhaust manifolds (willhave an obvious
            bellows type shape in the manifold)
        3. When was the clutch last replaced (944T clutch life is ~30,000
miles)
        4. Have both motor mounts been replaced, when?
           (they dry out, lose all their fluid and need replaced periodically)
        5. When was the last set of timing & balance shaft belts replaced?

                (should be done every two years or 30,000 miles whichever comes
                 first)
        6. WHen was the timing belts & balance shaft belts last adjusted?
        (should be annually or every 15,000 miles whichever is sooner)
        7. Turbos DO wear out. Depends on how they are taken care of.
        8. What type of oil was used & how frequently was it changed?
                (right answer: synthetic oil, every 2500-3000 miles )
        9. Have the wheel bearings been replaced yet (especially the rears-
           they can get to be expensive)
        10. When were the rod bearings last replaced? (tend to last for about
            50 hours of track use, suffer oil starvation problems, I do mine
            every two years)
        11. CHeck ball joints (are integral part of lower control arms-- cost
             about $1600 just for the parts)
        12. Transaxle- any problems shifting? Has the transaxle ever been
            rebuilt?
        13. Head gaskets-- known weakness. Look for it in the records, maybe
have a leakdown test run on the car.


Maintenance records are worth a LOT. Proof of maintenance activity is worth
paying a premium for vs. a car with an unknown history. Check with the service
shop that did the work on the car-- they will know best what is right and wrong
about the car. A little effort and expense before you buy the car can save you
thousands after you have bought it. SPend a $100 or $200 and have a porsche
repair center you trust check the car out for you. Maintenance for these cars
can get painful.

good luck-

Subject: 944 S2 Various Items

I just purchased this car less than a week ago.  Everything is absolutely
perfect except for this one small problem.  After driving for more than
fifteen minutes, when down to idle, the low oil light comes on (even though
the oil pressure seems to be pegged on 1) and the "!" light comes on.  At
first the light flickers but then, after a few more minutes, it comes on
pretty strong and stays on while at idle.  Depressing the accelerator just a
tad turns it off.  The strange thing is, even though this is my first Porsche
and I have only owned it for less than a week, my gut tells me that it is
idling OK.   No stalling, at least.  So, what gives? 

This problem didn't show itself during the "test drive" and the owner didn't
say anything about it.  He probably didn't know the problem existed because
he wasn't driving it very frequently or for extended periods of time.  I have
all of the records as well and there is no indication of this problem.

Thanks in advance for any responses!

BTW, thanks to everyone who responded to my earlier queries in searching for
this car.  It took six months, but I held out for the most perfect specimen
at the best price.  Other than my *very silly grin*, I have no driving
impressions other than last weekend being perfect topdown weather and people
staring at a very red convertible Porsche with my 18 month old son in the
front passenger seat (in his car seat).  This actually leads me to another
question.  Anyone out there with any luck fitting a child seat into the back
seat of a 944?  Seems almost impossible as the back seats are half as long as
the bottom of a child's seat.  Maybe there is a particular brand of seat that
will fit?  We have a Renolux.

Also, BTW, I seem to be without or in need of the following items (not in any
particular order):

Porsche Electric Air Pump (for spare tire and ?)
Boot Case (did Porsche provide these with the car or is this an extra?)
Locking lug nuts (Every other one I looked at had these)
Heavy rubber backed carpet mats, front & back, black

If anyone has any of these items for sale (new or used) or knows where to
find them, please let me know, directly if you prefer.  I am planning on
going to Don McGill sometime this week to check prices.

Subject: 901 Questions


Hello Everyone,

	I had spent a good portion trying to get the 914 in good tune over
the spring break. I have had the car parked over the snowy months and when
I got under the car to adjust the valves, I noticed a rather large pool of
yellowy-green oil on the concrete. If you guessed gear oil, you win a
cigar. (This is a side-shifter, BTW) I removed the shift-shaft cover and
another cup or two of oil dumped on the floor. After examining the
shift-assembly, I noticed a rather large large amount of lateral "play" 
in the shift shaft, as if it wobbles in the support.

Given the lack of a seal on the shift-shaft, and the seeming lack of 
precision in the bushings, I would like to remove and rebuild this 
portion of the transmission, as the rest of the unit works 
beautifully(No clashing downshifting into 1st, even). I have looked at 
the Haynes manual about removing this portion of the transmission, but it 
is unclear if this piece can be removed separately without further 
disassembly of the transmission. Has anyone done this? Any advice? Or do 
I just live with the leak until graduation? How difficult is this piece 
to rebuild?

Which brings me to my next question:

Upon discovering the leak, I attempted to remove the fill plug to top it 
off. It seemed rather resistant to moving. Before I get nuts with a 
breaker bar, is there anything that I can do to minimize the chances of 
stripping out the case. I know someone else has had this very trouble 
lately, what were your experiences? I tried to find something of this in 
the archives but I must not have looked hard enough as I have not found 
anything specific to the transmission on seized? hardware.



Thank you very much in advance

I have a sears die-hard in my 911.

I do not recommend this battery.  It works great but leaks slightly.  I assume

that if I did not auto-x, the battery would be okay.

By the by, this sucker is 5 years old and will still crank the engine for 
at least 30 seconds w/o slowing down.

Next time I think I'll try one of the Optima batteies.  No leaking...

As far as size goes, sears does (did 5 years ago) make a group 24 battery.
This is the correct size for a 1980 911.

My girlfriend bought a different non-factory battery for her 1981 911.  It's 
not a group 24; it's shorter.  The 1981 911 has a second bolt hole for this 
size battery.  I did have to fab a bracket out of a piece of aluminum 
angle.  It took about 10 minutes.

This is a *great* book for the beginning auto-x / time-trial driver.
It is required reading for the Zone 7 auto-x school.

Subject: 911 Cold Start Problem

I just had the 2.7 engine in my '76 911 replaced with a 3.0 from an '81 
SC.  The following components were also upgraded during the swap:
Fuel pump, CD, Fuel accumulator, distributor, tach, brain box installed 
under passenger seat.

The PROBLEM:  Car will not run right for about the first minute when 
cold.  It sputters, coughs and backfires through the airbox (thankfully 
it has a pop valve).  The engine will not go above 1,000 RPM.  After 
about 1 minute it is fine.  It runs much better than the 2.7 ever did.

I am looking for suggestions.

Thanks,

Hi ya'Jeff,

I do not claim to be an expert in automotive vinyl repairs, but I have 
worked in a auto interior and trim shop for a talented craftsman.  Here 
is my 2 cents worth, I would never advise attempting vinyl repair.  When 
we had vinyl to be repaired, we called in the experts.  Guys who 
specialize in vinyl and leather repair can cover a rather large hole that 
is hard to see with the naked eye, while non-experts usually turn out less 
than adequate work.

In regard to recovering the entire top, here is the name, #, and address
of a company in Kansas City that can fix you up.  They will give you prices 
on German Vinyl and Lavant Vinyl, of course the "CHERMAN" version is more 
expensive.  The german vinyl is "hand rolled", 	I know that will make you 
feel better ! :-)

Here is your info: J.R. Veteran Company

Unbolt the pump and gear drive.  You get a cam tower plug for the hole (same

I mostly agree with Mike Dayton in his assesment of the book and totally with

My lasting impression of the book overall, was that it was a continuing

To: JOHNM@icac.org

John, in MA all ins. co. have to play by the exact same rules, so with this
in mind let me tell you what happen to me last year and how I handled my
mishap.
     While driving in a drivers ed event I got a little loose and as the car
came around the car behind me clip the rear bumper and exhaust pipe.  The
force was enough to cause the left rear qt to buckle, plus the damage to my
muffler and rear bumper.  The damage to the car that clip me was a lot worse.
 Starting at the drivers door and back including his left rear wheel and
quarter.  (Note:  At the same event a 944 went into the wall broadside)  I
made a point of getting all the event papers including insurance papers from
the organizers that detail this event as a Drivers Ed. Event and submitted
them along with my accident report.  Apox. 10 days later I call the Ins.
Co.(Arbella) to see when they are going to send a check.  The claims adjuster
tells me that they have to look into this in more detail since I was on a
race track they fell that I may have been racing.  I tell her that this is
fine and I will check back with her in 2 days.  When I call back I am told
that the claim is being denied because this type of accident is not covered.
 When I ask her to what exclusion she is refering to, she tells me that the
policy does not cover racing. When I asked her how she came to the conclusion
that I was racing she said that since I was wearing a safety belt and a
helmet that it was racing.  I asked her if she had read the mat'l that I had
supplied, and she said that she had but because it said that the word racing
was not to be used then I must have been racing.  After some debate I told
her that I knew of a claim that they had paid under the exact same
cirumstance last year and that if she would review that claim then maybe she
would reverse her decision.  The alterative would be a 93A law suit filed by
me. (93A in MA allows you to collect 3 times your damages plus atty fees.)
 She said she would look up the claim and for me to call her back in a couple
of days.  I should note here that the claim I am referring to did require a 93
A action to resolve.       When I did get back to her, expecting her to now
reverse her decision she told me that she was still rejecting my claim
because that were not the same.  When I asked her what was different about the
 2 claims she said that in the other claim the driver was alone.  I told her
that he was not alone (Bridgehampton) and that the circumstances were exactly
the same, she claims that had they know that they never would have paid the
claim.  I asked her what other drivers on the course had to do with it, and
she said that since it was suppose to be a drivers ed event there should not
have been any other car on the course.  I asked her if she had gone to
drivers school when she was getting her license and she repled yes.  I then
ask her if they had closed down the local roads and highways while she was
being taught, she said no, but she still didn't get the point.
     I told her that if she didn't reverse herself that once I filed the
court action that I would not accept just the face value of the claim.  She
said that she had already talked to the company atty. and that she was holding
 her ground.  I filed the claim and the day after they recieved notice they
settled saying that I still wasn't covered but that they were making a
business decision.  I settled for double the claim without going to court. 
This whole action took from Sept. 94 to Feb. 95.  There were a lot of
conversions that I left out, but would be glad to relay if anyone would like
to call me.

P.S. Remember that 944 that went into the wall at the same event that I had
my mishap at.  The same Ins. Co. insured him. He had his check within 15 days
without any hassle.

Subject: early 911 fuel level sender

My gas gauge needle started jumping rapidly between full and empty and I'd
been relying on the reserve warning light for a few weeks.

So I replaced my 69T fuel tank sender. 

It's an easy job.

But I made the job longer by taking the opportunity to pull apart the old 
sender.

Here's a description:

The sender is a long vertical aluminum tube containing a float that is free 
to move in a vertical direction only.

One small nut + lock washer at the bottom of the sending unit holds the 
assembly together.

Here is a rough picture of what you see with the aluminum tube off.

             ! = bare resistance wire  

   |--ccccc--| = sliding contact short on the float.

    __wwwww__  = brass washer on the bottom of the float.
       

The float has two spring loaded sliding contacts that short the 
resistance wire at the point of the float level.

The resistance is lowest when the float is at the full tank position.

On a new sender it measured 2.3 ohms with the float at the top. 

At the bottom it measured 67 ohms.

When the float bottoms out on the __^  ^___ (contacts), the brass washer shorts
the two contacts together and the "reserve" light comes on.

So the gauge and reserve lights are two independent circuits.

The sender failed when one of the float's two spring loaded sliding brass
contacts fatigued and broke off.  

I won't be making a warranty claim on this part.

It had a datecode 11 68 so it was likely original on my 1969 911T.

And this, folks, is one of the reasons why Bart is soliciting contributions.
It would be a real convenience for the archives to be uncompressed and

lifted. But these and other enhancements take disk, processor, and net
resources that Stan cannot spare. So, if you haven't already, send your

This car has not been run for a couple of years. I test drove it, and it

The following is a description of the 912 for sale at $8700 US.
1969 912 Grey with Black interior, repainted with original color/paint
by previous owner. very good to excellent condition in/out. Originally 
purchased in CA and here ever since. I am the Third owner and have some
previous work reports prior to my ownership. Engine rebuilt(by previous
owner) around 20k ago. Runs very well/strong. Was compression tested about
1 year ago and I have the numbers and can get them to you tommorrow (If you
have an interest.) I have only put maybe 1k miles on since this test. 
More specifics: weber carbs (CA smoged also), Perlux ignitor, bursch exhaust,
(I have the original as well), K&N air cleaners, Flofit sport seats with
retractable belts, no tears but a small crack in the dash, AM/FM cass, 
Later model exterior rear view mirror, bronze phosphor pedal bushings,,etc,
etc. Everything works! Was originally delivered with A/C but compressor,
condensor, hoses have been removed. Dash a/c ducts are still installed, as is
the blower in the trunk area. Cookie cutters with new BFG tires, just 4
wheel aligned. This car is turn key and needs nothing. Any Interest?

Help me please!!!!

I need a kind soul with a 911 SC to do me a huge
favor.....I need to identify the pair of wires running
from your distributor to the Bosch CD box.

Open your engine lid and look at the distributor.
You will see a black wire running from the side
of it for a couple of inches then there will be a
plug connector.  The other side of the connector
runs to the CD box.  This plug should have a raised
black #7 and #31 on it - and I need to know which
side they are on.

Separate the plug and hold the CD side towards
your face so you can see the socket and that the
square groove (to ensure a one-way connection)
is facing up to the sky.  Is #7 on the left or right?

Thank you VERY much!!!!

Not sure about this but if you listen to a group of Germans talking

Porsch(ee)

to

Porsch()    -  pretty close to Porsch(a) but not quite.

Maybe due to regional dialects?

According to Figure 15.5 on pp 498 of "Race Car Vehicle Dynamics" by 
Milliken and Milliken (SAE Press - available through ewa), the rear 
spoiler reduces rear axle lift by approx. 125 lbs while the front chin 
spoiler reduces front axle lift by approx 70 lbs (at 100 mi/h for both 
figures).

You definately want both devices.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Odds & sods..

After getting the batteries charged, and finally breathing some life into
my hibernating '73 911 I have a few questions/problems...

1) With the twin battery setup does everybody have a problem getting the $%^&*
left side battery out - mine's an real bugger to get out (and especially get back in!)
because of the proximity of the fuel tank. It almost makes me want to go to a one
battery setup! What was the capacity of the Gates/Optima (or whatever) single battery
they used to replace the twin setup? 

Talking about the weight changes, changes in polar moment etc by going from 2 to 1 
battery setup - has anybody noticed the weight of the space saver wheel/tyre - grief!

2) Some water has been dripping onto the front of the car and has left a nice
white calcium mark which I can't shift very easily - normally for household stuff
(taps (whoops - faucets!) etc.) we'd use Putzessig, errrm, de-calcing vinegar, but 
would this harm the paint on the car? I'd hate to do that...., any ideas?

3) Was there a toolkit supplied with the car, are they still obtainable?

4) The tyre inflator for the space saver wheel is also missing, were they any
good anyway?

Thanks

Kevin.

Subject: What's this Fund business

You 112 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-subscribers (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1200 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  Last week's InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  By 3/18/95, we must apply to the IRS
for Non-Profit Organization status. (tick...tick...tick) I'm the guy in
the barrel here.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion we will
be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

Finally, for you good souls who want to contribute:  The bank folks would
rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

Hi, Darren,

There are a couple of things that hold the mirror parts in place (on all
cars with electric mirrors).

1) The base of the mirror is attached to the door with a single bolt that
can be accessed by rotating the stem of the mirror towards the front. It may
be hidden by a small plastic plug.

2) The stem of the mirror is attached to the base by a hollow bolt in the
stem itself. It is accessed from the bottom of the base and requires a large
(12mm?) triple square 12-point internal wrench.  Of course, there are a few
wires running through this bolt, so you may have to remove the wires first.

3) The mirror motor is attached to the stem by three small bolts. To access
these bolts, you have to remove the mirror glass.

4) The mirror glass is attached to the mirror motor in one of two ways:

a) On older mirrors, there are three spring-loaded pins that simply friction
fit into corresponding holes on the motor.

b) On newer mirrors (for 944, 1985/2 and newer), there is a ring that locks
the mirror glass into place. The ring has a couple of notches at the bottom
of the glass. To release the mirror glass, tilt the glass up as high as it
will go without breaking, then use a small screwdriver to rotate the locking
ring from the bottom. 

That's all that I know about, based on my exhaustive analysis of 944
electric mirrors.

Good luck

Subject: Re: Advice on buying '86 944T

james-

Some things to quickly qualify the car as a good prospect:

        1. When was the last water pump installed (they go bad ~2-3 years)
        2. Does it have the new style exhaust manifolds (willhave an obvious
            bellows type shape in the manifold)
        3. When was the clutch last replaced (944T clutch life is ~30,000
miles)
        4. Have both motor mounts been replaced, when?
           (they dry out, lose all their fluid and need replaced periodically)
        5. When was the last set of timing & balance shaft belts replaced?

                (should be done every two years or 30,000 miles whichever comes
                 first)
        6. WHen was the timing belts & balance shaft belts last adjusted?
        (should be annually or every 15,000 miles whichever is sooner)
        7. Turbos DO wear out. Depends on how they are taken care of.
        8. What type of oil was used & how frequently was it changed?
                (right answer: synthetic oil, every 2500-3000 miles )
        9. Have the wheel bearings been replaced yet (especially the rears-
           they can get to be expensive)
        10. When were the rod bearings last replaced? (tend to last for about
            50 hours of track use, suffer oil starvation problems, I do mine
            every two years)
        11. CHeck ball joints (are integral part of lower control arms-- cost
             about $1600 just for the parts)
        12. Transaxle- any problems shifting? Has the transaxle ever been
            rebuilt?
        13. Head gaskets-- known weakness. Look for it in the records, maybe
have a leakdown test run on the car.


Maintenance records are worth a LOT. Proof of maintenance activity is worth
paying a premium for vs. a car with an unknown history. Check with the service
shop that did the work on the car-- they will know best what is right and wrong
about the car. A little effort and expense before you buy the car can save you
thousands after you have bought it. SPend a $100 or $200 and have a porsche
repair center you trust check the car out for you. Maintenance for these cars
can get painful.

good luck-

Interesting -

If the rear spoiler provides 125 Lb of down force, presumably the rear 
spoiler must be capable of accepting a load of 125 lb evenly distributed 
 - or the weight of the average 22 year old woman I cannot imagine that 
the lifting 993 style spoilers can take this sort of punishment.

like wise if the chin spoiler imparts a down force of 70, when it's 
centre of pressure is perhaps only 6 inches below the centre of gravity 
and 2 feet in front of the front axle, I quickly calculate that the force 
on the chin spoiler must be around 280 lb evenly distributed. All this 
force is carried by some trivial bolts and self tappers

Chris I am not flaming you, I wonder about these Milliken figures though

I admit I know very little about aero-dynamics, but I do know about 
something for nothing theories, none of them work

As a matter of interest do M&M make plastic bolt ons

But reducing lift is not really the same as providing downforce. You
can reduce lift by making airflow turbulent, or by redirecting it, using
a device which doesn't have to take very much pressure itself. The
weight on the tires isn't greater at speed than when stationary; it
just isn't reduced by as much with the spoilers in place.

Of course the numbers may still be totally bogus, but I don't think
you can judge that by the strength of the spoilers themselves.

I'm going to be running in some Autocrosses and drivers schools

the age of the car, would it not be cheap insurance to rebuild
the calipers?  The calipers are not leaking right now, but I would
hate to have one blow out at 100+mph because of their age.

I'm also going to change the brake fluid and put new pads in.  I'll

Subject: Re: Efficiency of Tails

Peter Diffey questioned whether the Millikens had their data right about
front and rear "de-lift" figures in their new book.

I can personally attest that the Millikens are REAL smart guys when it comes
to anything regarding vehicle dynamics and aerodynamics.  Bill told me about
making and test flying his own airplane as a much younger man.  His son Doug
is an architect as well as a smart car guy.  I would trust anything they say
implicitly.

The stress analysis you perform might not take into account the way in which
the "de-lifting" acts on the car.  The front chin spoiler, IMHO, would not
take all the loads (70#) on its own structure.  It causes a low pressure area
under the front of the car which acts on the underside spread out across the
entire area of maybe the front quarter of the chassis.  This only requires a
few pounds per square foot of force to make happen.  The strength to resist
100 mph wind is found from about 40 pounds per square foot wind pressure as
applied to the 6 inch lever arm of the spoiler.  Since the spoiler can be
driven in excess of 150 mph without failure, it must be strong enough to keep
itself intact  at 100 and let the negative pressure differential across the
hood to bottomside separation do the tough stuff.

I assume the tail must work in a similar fashion by acting on pressure balance
 top of car to bottom of car for "de-lifting".

Think about it.  We are not trying to "push" down on the car with air, we are
trying to queer the lift that the body shape produces.  The car is a huge
airfoil, an upside-down version of ground effects.  These "spoiling" devices
try to cancel out the mechanisms of  the  shape induced lift.    The 962
generates a minus 1500 kg of lift at top speed.  Hans Stuck reports that it
was physically impossible for him to apply enough pedal pressure to test some
race car ABS (lock the wheels) at Nardo until the car slowed down enough to
undo the downforce induced traction.  I can tell you that 962 bodywork is so
flimsy that a girl friend's backside can crack a door panel (mine is cracked
from same at a "concours", not my girl friend, mine was home with the kids).
 Yet the aerodynamic effect  causes the car to "weigh" 2.5 times its normal
self at speed.

Outside of a visual inspection for the ignition wires (ie cracking, peeling rubber from
the heat), is there a resistance check to determine if the wires are good or not?
Replacement wires are very expensive and I can not find any information on when to replace
 them. My wires are original (140,000 miles) and still look good. Should I replace them?

Subject: track/auto-x/street tires

I am planning on doing about 10 auto-xes and perhaps 6 track events in
my 944 this year. I am trying to decide what type of tires to get. I have a
second set of wheels but am wondering if I can get just one set of tires
and use them for everything, including commuting to work.

First I should state that I am just learning how to drive in these types of
events, so I am not really interested in shaving the last few tenths of a
second off of my times through tire choice. Rather, I want a tire that is
predictable at the limit. I am considering R compound tires because I
do want to push the limit a little farther than what I have already
experienced (I have attended 4 auto-xes and 1 track event using my
Dunlop D60 tires).

I am considering the BFG R1 and the Yokohama A008RS II. I understand
that the R1 is probably a faster tire, but that it won't last as long for daily
driving, it won't be as predictable at the limit, nor will it be much fun to
drive on the street. The latter is due to its stiff, asymmetrical sidewall
construction which causes serious wander problems. On the other hand,
I have been told that the RS II, while being an auto-x compound, works
fine at the track and is more predictable at the limit than either the R1 or
the track RS. The only drawback to the RS II for my purposes is a greater
tendency to harden from track heat cycling. I do know of quite a few guys
who put RS IIs on their cars at the beginning of the season and just leave
them on until the end (at which point they are pretty well worn). However,
since the RS and RS II tires are not asymmetrical, they can be turned
around on the wheel and a few more events can be coaxed out of them.

So, I am, at this point, leaning towards the Yoko RS IIs.

Anyone have any comments?

Subject: Targa Top vinyl suppliers / Rebuild

Hi,

Here are some hints on Targa Top Vinyl and restoration:

I just completed a total rebuild of my targa top myself.  A total
rebuild meant tearing all the old vinyl off, and the foam topped
canvas, and the webbing that keep the plates together.  I bought
the new German vinyl, not for $100, but for something like $65 from
a place in CA, mail order, that advertises in the back of excellence
magazine called World Upholstery and Trim.  They have an 800 number.
It is 1-800-222-9577.  The vinyl they sent me was perfect, looks
exactly like the original, and is identical to the factory piece in
shape, size, and quality.  I looked around at a bunch of adds and
catalogs from places like tweeks, performance products, etc.  These
places do not deal in Upholstery, so anything they sell they got
via some supopolier, and tacked on a nice profit to it.  To pay
more than $100 for a piece of vinyl is stupid.  Try calling the 2
or 3 adds in the back of excellence for the various shops that just
do upholstery work, and you will be getting a much better price for
the identical product.  They even gave me some advice on how to go
about repairing the top, and sent me diagrams and samples of all of
the types of vinyl, foam, and headliner material that they sell.
They also told me that they supply dealers, and shops, and stores
with their product.  

The headliner was something like $35 or so, I can`t remember.  
I got both items (vinyl, and headlinder) for well under $100.  And
the vinyl does have the beading that runs along the front and back 
edge already sewn in place.  And the headliner is perfect too.  So
if you are going to buy these things, go to one of these upholstery
shop places, not a parts supplier house.

The other materials I used to recover it were some very think and
heavy canvas - which I bought at a large artist supply house.  They
sell it to poaint on - I bought the thick stuff that was last 
a long time - it was $6 for the piece.  I also bought 1/4 inch foam
to put between the canvas, and the vinyl, to simulate the factory
foam backed canvas that porsche uses.  But I ended up not using
it becuase it made the fit to tight of the vinyl, so I just used the
canvas alone.  I used nylon webbing - 2 inch wide - across both long
sides of the top, to hold the aluminum plates in place.  I bought
Marine Goop adhesive (comes in a tube), and 1/8 inch rivets, and 
gludes and riveted this band of nylon across the top of these plates,
running along the edge of the long sides of the top.  When this dried,
the next day, I bought a quart of contact cement to glue the canvas
in place onto the plates, over the webbing, and wrapped it around the
edges of the top, with an overhang of about 4inches on the ong ends, 
and 2 inches on the short sides of the top.  The contact cement worked
well to secure the canvas in place.  When this was all done, I used
the contact cement again to secure the vinyl in place on the canvas.
Note that you do not glue the entire vinyl to the entire canvas, 
just the edges that wrap under the top get glued.  The whole process
took quite a while - maybe 12 hours of labor.

See the post a while back for more defined details about this whole
process - such as duct taping the nuts in place that are used for 
the hook-like attachements, etc.  

A warning though - When you have the top totally apart, and all 
the aluminun plates (3 free floating plates) are unattached, take
the frame to your car, put it on the car, and aling the plates on
top of the frame - as if the top were attached to the car while
driving.  Lay the plates in placeaaaaaaa (this is without any vinyl 
on the frame.  Then lay the webbing in place along the edges near the
windsheidl frame, and the targa bar.  Carefuly note the position of
the front and rear edges of each floating plate in relation to the 
2 side plates - which do not float.  Then while the webbing is laying
in place, as if it were glued and riveted down, use a marker to mark
the position of the plates.  

Why do I say this above - becuase I reconstructed my entire top without
ever going back to the car after each step to make sure it still fit
into place smoothly and correctly. This is a BIG MISTAKE.  After each
major step in the Targa Top rebuild process: #1 install webbing, #2
install canvas, and #3 install vinyl - go back to the car each time
and make sure the plates are centered between the top edge of the 
windsheild frame, and the top edge of the targa bar.  Not centered
left to right - this matters too, but less so.  What matters is that they 
are centered from to back.  The most important thing is that the gap, maybe
3/8 inch, between the alluminiun plate, and each edge (targa bar, 
windshiled) is the SAME!!.  I did not do this, and when I put the top 
on the car, after the plates were glued to the canvas, I found that
they were about 1/8 inch to far forward.  So when my top was on the
car, I had the porblem of a little tiny gap bnetween the vinyl beaded
edge and the rear targa bar.  Result: it can leak.  I fixed this, but
I was lucky I could, since it was a small error.  It was a pain in
the ass to fix.  I had to adjust the hooks on the plates so that when
the rear frame bar was snapped tight, it would engaged these hooks
and pull the 3 plates towards the rear targa bar, thus closing the gap.
It would have been much much easier to get it right the first time.

Other hints - Drill out the old rivets for the webbing, use the same
factory holes.  Buy rivet heads for the rivets - these are washers
that go over the end of the rivet that gets smushed, and get pulled
against the opposing rivet head, thus sandwiching the material you
are riveting.  Also, wrap the nylon material over the edge of the
aluminum, and rivet both parts of the same piece of webbing, the 
top section, and the part wrapped under.  Use lots of marine goop
on the webbing, all around the rivets, and along the top and 
underside edge.  When this stuff is fianlly dry, that webbing will 
go nowhere.  Get marine goop since it is resistant to moisture.

I also need now to replace the plastic cones that cover the pins
which extend into the windsheild frame and the targa bar.  Mine
are old, borken, worn, and let the top rattle and squeek.  Where
can I get these?

Sorry for such a long post, and the typos, but I followed the other
post and came into the snags mentioned above - not the posters
fault - but clarifications will help the next person.  All in all,
I would do it again if I had to - some places wanted $500-600 to
rebuild it!  Chaaa - as if!  I enjoyed the satisfaction of staying
up until 4am, 2 nights in a row, working away at it.  And my
roomates enjoyed the satisfaction of the fumes from the contact
cement filling the entire house.  Now if my engine was just as
mechanically simple as this top...

Eric,

I have used both the Yoko RS II and the BFG R1 230 for autox on my 911
within the last 6 months.

First of all, the RS II has a tread pattern similar to the BFG R1 and
has the same "this side out" requirements of the R1. So there is no
advantage here. The tire has to be mounted on the wheel in a particular
way.

Since you have an extra set of wheels, I would use them instead of
trying to us the R compound tires all the time. Since you are going
to do track events, you will want to order the BFG R1's shaved or
have the Yoko RS II shaved once you get them. This will actually
extend tire life and improve performance. Whichever tire you choose
will last a lot longer if you do not drive it on the street.

I don' about track events, but the BFG R1 is just as predictable at
the limit as the Yoko RS II. The key is that tire feels different
than the Yoko and takes a while to get in tune with the tire. After
switching from the Yoko RS II to the BFG R1 it took me about 5 runs
to get comfortable with the tires.

The BFG R1 is a great tire and I heartily recommend it over the
Yoko RS II. It is a fster tire for both autox and time trial
useage.

To: JOHNM@icac.org

John, in MA all ins. co. have to play by the exact same rules, so with this
in mind let me tell you what happen to me last year and how I handled my
mishap.
     While driving in a drivers ed event I got a little loose and as the car
came around the car behind me clip the rear bumper and exhaust pipe.  The
force was enough to cause the left rear qt to buckle, plus the damage to my
muffler and rear bumper.  The damage to the car that clip me was a lot worse.
 Starting at the drivers door and back including his left rear wheel and
quarter.  (Note:  At the same event a 944 went into the wall broadside)  I
made a point of getting all the event papers including insurance papers from
the organizers that detail this event as a Drivers Ed. Event and submitted
them along with my accident report.  Apox. 10 days later I call the Ins.
Co.(Arbella) to see when they are going to send a check.  The claims adjuster
tells me that they have to look into this in more detail since I was on a
race track they fell that I may have been racing.  I tell her that this is
fine and I will check back with her in 2 days.  When I call back I am told
that the claim is being denied because this type of accident is not covered.
 When I ask her to what exclusion she is refering to, she tells me that the
policy does not cover racing. When I asked her how she came to the conclusion
that I was racing she said that since I was wearing a safety belt and a
helmet that it was racing.  I asked her if she had read the mat'l that I had
supplied, and she said that she had but because it said that the word racing
was not to be used then I must have been racing.  After some debate I told
her that I knew of a claim that they had paid under the exact same
cirumstance last year and that if she would review that claim then maybe she
would reverse her decision.  The alterative would be a 93A law suit filed by
me. (93A in MA allows you to collect 3 times your damages plus atty fees.)
 She said she would look up the claim and for me to call her back in a couple
of days.  I should note here that the claim I am referring to did require a 93
A action to resolve.       When I did get back to her, expecting her to now
reverse her decision she told me that she was still rejecting my claim
because that were not the same.  When I asked her what was different about the
 2 claims she said that in the other claim the driver was alone.  I told her
that he was not alone (Bridgehampton) and that the circumstances were exactly
the same, she claims that had they know that they never would have paid the
claim.  I asked her what other drivers on the course had to do with it, and
she said that since it was suppose to be a drivers ed event there should not
have been any other car on the course.  I asked her if she had gone to
drivers school when she was getting her license and she repled yes.  I then
ask her if they had closed down the local roads and highways while she was
being taught, she said no, but she still didn't get the point.
     I told her that if she didn't reverse herself that once I filed the
court action that I would not accept just the face value of the claim.  She
said that she had already talked to the company atty. and that she was holding
 her ground.  I filed the claim and the day after they recieved notice they
settled saying that I still wasn't covered but that they were making a
business decision.  I settled for double the claim without going to court. 
This whole action took from Sept. 94 to Feb. 95.  There were a lot of
conversions that I left out, but would be glad to relay if anyone would like
to call me.

Subject: Weird Sparkplug Story (long)

I own a '92 Audi S4 (4-valves x 5 zyl) turbo sedan and had a weird thing
happen one cold morning.   The car is kept in a heated garage.  I know this
because the outside-temp reading on the instrument cluster said 65 F when I
staterd up.  The Cincinnati outdoor temperature was about 2 or maybe 3 F when
I backed out of the garage.  After snaking my way to the interstate and
boosting up the rush-hour raceway for 10 minutes the temp guage read 7 F.
 Car is running fine.  I get off the interstate at my exit and after a few
stop lights, I attempt to suck the head-lights out of a Mustang by using alot
of boost.  This proves difficult since the Mustang says "5.0" on the fender
where I hadn't seen it.  OK, we'll use alot of boost for more time.  Not a
good move, now I have to trail-brake to make the next turn-off.  Oh well, no
harm no foul, it was a 4-lane boulevard anyway.  I pull in to an intermediate
destination (no, not a bathroom) and turn off the motor.  After I come back
and re-start, I pull back out onto the street and I immediatly think there is
something wrong with wheel balance or maybe I have "D"-shaped tires.  Lots of
wubba-wubba-wubba related to car speed.  I push in the clutch and it quits.
 Oh-oh, engine!

I limp it to the office and call the dealer (warranty still going) and then
drive it over to them.  They say givem a day or so and they'll call.  They
drive me back to the office.  They call a day later and say that the fault
code in the engine computer says the injector on the front cylinder is bad
and they have put in a whole new set of injectors.  This seems to have helped
and they will drop off the car.
I get it back and the driver says he doen't think that it is completly right,
but I should drive it over the weekend and see.  I drive it home and it is
still bad but different.  It doesn't idle smoothly and it misses at full
boost ( 1.7+ bar), but it runs great at part throttle and low boost ( 0.8 to
1.3 bar ).  I take it back and relay all this to the service manager and he
assembles a coven of mechanics, the service advisor, the owner, and me.  The
spark coil trough comes off and everything seems OK except the insulator tube
for the front cylinder seems dirty with a faint chalky film.  I look down the
sparkplug well and its ID is coated with a sooty film.  I announce to the
throng that I want to see the sparkplug real bad.  

When the mechanic pulls out the plug, it looks weird.  Normally, one would
expect to see a hooked ground electrode, a conical insulator ceramic, and a
coaxially located center electrode.  Not on this one!  It had the hook ground
electrode like normal, but seemed to have a roller shaped thing in the
center.  It was the insulator cone.... busted off and replaced sideways,
jammed in the threaded housing like it had been made that way (it hadn't been
made that way).   They leaked it down and finding nothing out of the ordinary,
 put in a new set of plugs and the car has been perfect ever since.

I can only speculate that the high boost maneuver followed by a frigid-air
restart stressed the insulator ceramic and it, at some point, broke off,
bounced around the chamber a million times, and stuffed itself back in the
hole.  The tip electrode was never found.
The one-coil per cylinder high-energy ignition could fire past the bum plug
elements at modest pressure and non-lean (idle) mixtures.

Weird, huh?

Don't do either. There are plenty of perfectly good 022s and 031s out there,
not to mention the VJ4 BR9's, and the parts to put them back in perfect 
working order are readily available at Stoddard. 

If you don't believe me, ask Vic Skirmants, Brett Johnson or most of the
other Registry tech crowd. Harry Pellow will say sure, use the 050 because
it's *almost* the same but it's really not even close. You have to have
too much initial advance to make it work well to make good power at
low RPMs. It *IS* however significantly cheaper than a new 031, but if
cheap is what motivates you, you've got the wrong car to begin with...

I've wondered if there might not be an aftermarket for taking 050s or 009s
and re-curving them to be *EXACTLY* right. But after doing that on my
Sun distributor machine, I figure that if you have to pay yourself
*ANYTHING* for your time, that there's no way you can compete with the
price of rebuilding a cheap used VJ4...

I asked the list a question about insurance & drivers ed on behalf of a friend 
a few days ago. Bill Peterson asked for the exact wording of his contract & 
here is my friends reply.

My friend is with a company called AMICA, & I hope that the following 
restrictions don't start appearing in other companies policies!

By the way, my friend is still looking for a company that will cover his car 
for individual drivers ed events. Does anyone know of a company that would 
consider this?

Sorry for the long message...

- ---------------------------------------------
John (and, I hope, Bill),
 
Thanks for your help. I am trying to send this message both to you and to Bill 
Petersen, the person who responded to your message and asked for the exact 
wording of the clause that was added to my policy. I hope I got the correct 
address of the message you forwarded to me. Anyway, here goes. The exact 
wording is:
 
"We do not provide liability coverage for ownership, maintenance, or use of 
any vehicle, located inside a facility designed for racing, for the purpose 
of:
 
(a) competing in; or
(b) practicing or preparing for;
 
any prearranged or organized racing or speed contest."
 
The clause also appears elsewhere in the policy, as follows:
 
"We do not provide medical payments coverage for any insured for bodily injury 
sustained while occupying any vehicle, located inside... (etc., same as 
above)"
 
"We will not pay for loss to your covered auto or any non-owned auto, located 
inside... (etc., same as above)"
 
The underwriters insist that Drivers' Ed is not covered because of the speeds 
involved. They say that it doesn't matter that it is not a race, that it is a 
"contest with myself" to go faster, not to improve general driving skills. I 
have not received their response in writing, so I am just paraphrasing the 
discussions. The definitions section of the policy DOES NOT define any of the 
terms used in the clause (i.e., "facility designed for racing", "competing 
in", "practicing or preparing", "prearranged", "organized", "racing", or  
"speed contest").
 
By the way, I still have the problem of an uncertain insurance situation 
regarding the next event. In case this issue cannot be resolved favorably in 
time, I would still like to know if anyone knows of event insurance that can 
be purchased for an individual event to cover the above exclusions.
 
I would also be interested in any experiences with drivers insured in Maryland 
and whether there have been any favorable decisions under the state insurance 
regulations.
 
Thanks, 
 
Paul

$3600 for a 1976 914 2.0 that is rust-free except for some battery area rust
is a bargain to the point of being too good to be true.

Good '76 models easily sell for $8,500 and up with pristine examples worth
$14,000. Since the '76 model was the last year for the 914 and the second
rarest production year to the '70 914-6 (only about 4200 1976 models were
manufactured), the '76 models fetch a premium price.

All 914 transmissions shift the same with first over to the left and back.
Transmission rebuilds are fairly costly because of parts prices ($895 parts
and labor with warranty) and one cannot trust used gear boxes because of the
first gear problem due to the gizmo 914 clutch cable roller assembly and
constant adjustment problem.

Accelerator linkage problems are caused by several things:
     1. bad pedal cluster accelerator pivot bushings
     2. a stiff or wobbly pedal
     3. an old non-greased cable or one being used as an electrical ground
due to a poorly connected transmission ground strap
     4. An improperly connected throttle return spring or the wrong spring
     5. a sticking throttel body (especially on 1.8 models!)

The conclusion is that if you can find a rust free '76 914 (and they were all
2.0 models) for $3600, buy it!

Hi Scott,

If I remember correctly, the tech bulletin describes PCNA's criterion

Subject: RE: 944T Coil-overs


Hi Doug,

Sorry for not replying sooner.  I am not sure how good an answer I
can give you.  I don't know anyone running 10" rears.

If you're happy with the springing and just want the tires and wheels
to clear, I'd try to modify the bodywork.  I don't know whether the inner
rear fender wells can be moved in, but I would find out and try to make
that change.

I think you have  too little springing in the car, too much of it in the 
sway
bars, and should, at a minimum, upgrade to later factory specs.  Your
front springs are about 130# and you can drop in 210# or 250# springs
with a minimum of fuss.  For higher rates, I do not know of a source of
springs in Porsche's ID (like about 3.75").  Call Eibach or Truechoice.
The rest of the world uses 2-1/4" or 2-1/2" springs for competition, and
they are cheap and plentiful.  Converting your suspension to use then
is not cheap, though, per the quotes you got from VCI.

The rears are more of a problem, if that weren't enough.  You ought to
upgrade to larger later torsion bars.  However, labor exclusive of
alignment is at least six hours.  Torsion bar springing goes as the
fourth power of their diameter, and a change of a few mm. will have a
big effect.

Your problem is going to be knowing beforehand exactly what you
need.  If you know how much rear travel you have today, and can
set a goal for how much you can get away with, then you know roughly
what change in wheel rate you need.  You also have to build in some
head room on the assumption that you'll eventually push harder and
faster...

Sorry to be so vague.  I guess that's why they call it "suspension
tuning."  Doug Arnao at VCI is very knowledgeable when it comes to
suspension design -- chat with him.

No, leave well enough alone.  They will not "blow out," the seals

(Snip...much deleted)
I hope your experience with AMICA wasn't one that would sour you on the
company forever. My familry has been insuring vehicles and businesses with
AMICA and its predecessor company (Factory Mutual) for over 50 years, and I
can say without reservation that they have been the best business dealings I
have had. Extremely reasonable, willing to listen to  your side, and claims
paid in a timely manner. When I lost a car in the California fires in October
1993, I had a check in the bank the day following my claim. My vehicles
aren't exactly ordinary, either; AMICA  has never refused coverage on any of
my four-wheeled vehicles, and that includes Porsches (both new and vintage)
and a Lamborghini. 
I must also say that I'm surprised that you want an insurance company to bail
you out of a track event's damage. As a person who has spent a great deal of
time on the track, I can't imagine  expecting an insurance company to pay for
a mistake I made at speed. Isn't there a point where responsibility for your
actions becomes your own? Of course, insurance is there for a reason--to
cover the costs of repair when mistakes are made.  However, even at PCA
events some groups approach the intensity seen at races, and it doesn't take
a great leap of faith to see that the pitfalls of racing, such as oil on the
track, mechanical failure, tire failure, etc. can have a much greater impact
(so to speak) on potential damage a car is likely to incur. I'm a big
believer in racing, and also strongly believe that PCA driver's events are
beneficial to most Porsche drivers, but I have a hard time thinking that
someone should bail me out if I make a mistake.

I would recommend the Yokos in this situation.  If you were

choice.  The Yokos will give good wear and will not harden up
to the point of being unpleasantly slow.  Dwight Mitchell gave
me a set of Yokos once that he had used and discarded.  They had
sat in the sun next to his house for over a year (Sacarmento, CA).
I used them for practice tires for almost a year before I finally
corded one of them.  The felt good up to the end.

I would recommend getting an extra set of wheels.  The 7" cookie
cutters can be had at reasonable prices at a swap meet and will
work fine.  Make sure you go with 15" wheels and use the 225/50
tires.  Reason for the extra wheels is that the chances that
you will end up flat spotting the tires is pretty good.  Makes
street driving unpleasant.

There may be a cure for part of the oil pickup problem for 944s used

The 1989 944 Turbo and 944S2 has an additional pan baffle which is 
to counteract the high-G oil travel problem. It works with normal 
944 pans. The part number is: 944.107.389.03, Oil Pan Baffle,

Not a complete cure, but I am advised that it helps a great deal.

How does it extend life?  I don't think someone with 10 days at the track

(6/32") depth tire.  Nor do I think he will chunk them.

Depends on a lot of things.  I think street driving takes away very little
if any tread depth by comparison with the wear tires see at the track.
Say, for example, you get 1,000 track-only miles vs. 15,000 street-only
miles from a set of RSII's or R1's -- is it really worth all the pain of 
constantly
swapping them?  I put mine on in April and take them (well, the current

There is an impedence stamped onto the plug ends.  Each wire should

Inspect the wires in the dark, with the engine running.  Look for blue

        My first reaction was to blurt out, "Oh, no way!"  Upon reconsider-
ing that, I think I'll just say that it depends on a lot of factors.  Here
in the Bay Area, it is not at all uncommon to find good 73-74 2.0's for
$3K-$4K.  76'es are about the same (depends on the buyer and seller, may be
a bit less), and 75s are also a bit less.  Not too many around here seem to
be interested in the rarity of the 76.
        One of the racers, Bert Del Villano (sp?) bought his 73 2.0 for $6K.
It was pretty much perfect, slightly non-original, and everybody thinks he
paid too much.  $5K for a great one seems to be the asking rate.
        You know, maybe I should truck my rusty 1.8 out to Atlanta!  It
sounds as if I could make a decent profit from it out there!   ;)

Subject: US "legal" 959, Porsche pronunciation

Hi,

I went over to my mechanics' shop today and for the first time noticed that
he had a picture of a red 959 near one of his tool boxes. I asked him if that
was a real one and he answered Yes. The next queston was " Hey, I thought
they were illegal here?" to which he replied "Not if you got a lot of money."
I guess that doesn't apply to Bill Gates. To make a long story short he says
that there are two in Florida. One is owned by some Austrian/African- don't
know which country- guy who has diplomatic plates (i.e. immunity) and the
other is owned by a dealer who puts his dealer plates whenever he wants to
drive it around. I imagine that the dealer must be Champion Porsche.  I have
yet to see them.

On another note, does it really matter how one pronounces "Porsche"? I know
that it should be pronounced "Porscha", but I think it sounds a little
pretentious to pronounce it the German way when speaking English. You
wouldn't say "After picking up my "Porscha" in Stuttgart, I went to Koeln and
Paree (Paris)," would you?

     Paul, the last thing you need is an air pressure regulator. These are

  50-60psi. Mount it a couple feet from the gun, don't rely on a pressure
  regulator separated from the gun (i.e., at the compressor).

     The 2 knobs on the gun are for Air mixture and Fan size.  You have to
  adjust these to taste....Most glossy painting goes on heavy, it takes

Subject: 050 vs 031 ditributors

Stan pointed out the differences between the advance curves of the 
various distributors that an owner might choose between for their 356. 

Stan - I have seen the differences on paper, and on the bench, but 
experimenting with a street motor and an assortment of used distributors 
one day I could not detect any difference. Can you feel it in the seat of 
your pants? It seemed to me that the advance curve came on so quick, that 
if you set the timing at the point of full advance, the distributors 
behaved just the same. I suppose the response to different curves could vary 
with the engine recipe.

BTW, I have offered remanufactured distributors for some time, at a very 
reasonable price, with no real luck. They were re-curved by Nelson of 
Nelson's specialties (AKA Captain Lightning Bolt in NASCAR circles), yet 
people felt more comfortable with new, less precise units. Oh well. Don't 
stock 'em any more

Kevin,

Jim Fogarty, one of the designers of BFG R1, told me that if you are
going to run the R1's on the track, you should shave them. He said
the tires will last longer and will run cooler (more likely to stay
in the optimum temp. range). This prevents excessive tire wear.

Now, maybe you know more about the tires than Jim does, but I think
not. He also said that if you are autocrossing only, you probably do not
need to shave the tires because they will not get too hot in all
likelyhood. I did not make the recommendation just for the performance
improvement, but for tire life as well.

Of course tires wear faster at the race track tha on the street. Let's
not state the obvious. I don't get 15,000 street miles from street tires.
Why would I expect to get that for Yoko RS II's or BFG R1's. I've
heard 5000 miles is about right for BFG R1's on the rear of a 911.

If you are using your daily driver as a autocross and track car I
think it is a very good idea to go through the "pain" of swapping
them! Especially if you are hitting the track every weekend.

An anecdote:

I bought a 1992 911 TurboS2 in Feburary from Brumos Porsche with the factory
one year warranty. Two days ago the bracket that holds the air conditioner
wheel sheared off, trashing the fan belt.

Porsche roadside assistance conveyed the vehicle to the dealership for free,
although they had no record of my purchase in their database. The dealer
called and said that the repairs would cost $690, and were not covered by the
used car warranty.

I called Porsche Customer service, and told them that I was a bit
disappointed at having to shell out so soon after purchasing the car. They
were extremely nice, and said that they would "look into the matter, but
could not promise anything". Today the regional manager called to say that
Porsche will cover the cost of repairs, because I shouldn't be stung with
such a large bill so soon after buying the car.

I was amazed at the cordiality and consideration shown by Porsche customer
service. This stands in stark contrast to other car companies that I've had
to deal with in the past (especially Chrysler).

Thought some of you might be interested.

From: Jerry944T@aol.com
Subject: Re: track/auto-x/street tires

Scot,
FYI the criteria for shaving, and this is according to Jim Fogerty, is the
temps at which you run the tires. They are designed for max grip at about
210-225 degrees. If you are developing greater than that then there is too
much heat due to squirming and you need them shaved.
I ran my new BFG R1's at Sebring  and never got above 160 degrees, according
to my pyrometer. 
This is not to say that on a mid-summer day at an asphalt track such as
Summit Point they won't get hotter. I am sure they will but by that time I
will have worn enough off so that it doesn't matter.
BTW the guys in the BFG support truck at Sebring gave me the same advice.
One other point is that it is fine to run these tires on the street. I agree
with Kevin. The amount you scrub off and one track event is of a far greater
magnitude then you will loose by street driving. I routinely drive 500 miles
to a track event with no discernable wear.

Subject: Re: Drivers' Ed & Insurance Problems...

Thanks for your reply. I understand that others may disagree with the
track/insurance issue, and I suspect a lot of that originates from the
different goals that track participants have. If some are there to learn the
"proper" techniques of approaching what a Porsche can do for one re:
capabilities, I can understand those individuals wanting to retain coverage.
On the other hand, other folks at track events are consistently closer to the
edge of their personal performance envelopes than they realize. This
group--not PCA racers but at drivers ed. events--is the bunch that creates
headaches for insurance agents.  At any rate, I'm not advocating any position
other than my own personal view, which is--if you're at the track and you
break it, you fix it. If others have a different view, well that's what makes
the world go 'round. Everybody's entitled to their own opinion.

Can you elaborate on "because of the first gear problem due to the gizmo

This statement on the 914's 1st gear problem is one I haven't heard before,
and I still haven't obtained a decent explanation on my car's frequent
refusal to get into 1st gear from a stop (works great at all non-zero
speeds, though).

I just bought Ate Super Blue Racing at Automotion last week and it's most
definitely blue. I used it in my Alfa at Sears Point on Sunday and I had no

it wasn't a methodical or scientific experiment. 

I don't like the fact that it's blue, as it makes it harder to tell if your
seals are breaking down.

Subject: Softening 944 ride?

Hi everybody,

I have an 85.5 944 which I bought about 5 months ago. 
I drive the car almost daily, commuting from No. VA to DC.
Those of you who also have to drive in DC know that most
parts of DC roads are not admirable. 

The previous owner had all shocks/struts replaced with KYB's.
I have a feeling that the car rides rather harsher (though I
do not have experience with any other Porsche!). Every time I
drive through even a small hole/bump, the car shakes/rattles
and I feel like a piece of my heart gets ripped off.

Is this kind of ride typical for 944s? How do the KYBs compare
with stock shocks/struts? Is it possible to soften the ride,
I am willing to compromise the handling with comfort (a bit),
since I do not race/track?

Any feedback, opinions, suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks a lot.
Armagan.

944 folks,

What do you recommend for replacing ball joints?
        - using expensive OEM control arms
        - using remanufactured control arms
        - or something else.

My car has 100k miles and the ball joints are a little
loose.  This is a hard driven street car.       
 
There are several places listed in Panorama for remanufactured
control arms.  Does anyone have any experience with them?
 
I have a limited budget and if I use remanufactured control 
arms I could also get some new shocks, since they are about 
$300 less per arm than new OEM arms.  My car seems to be a
little under dampened, it gets a little floaty over about 60 mph.
 
Thanks for any recomendations.

The black inlay is very durable.  I put on 6 coats of varnish, high gloss. If 
you don't want a very shiny effect get semi gloss.  It's three years old and 
shows no sign of wear or deterioation.  Had the chrome ring around the padded 
horn button rechromed.  The effect is great and the wood on the wheel bears 
some scars from the years so it looks very original rather than like an add on. 
 
Good luck,

I have a wood steering wheel on my 66 912 that needs to be redone.  I think if 
try to sand it down I will sand out the black inlay that is in the wheel.  
Anyone out there done this before?  Are there any nasty chemicals that take off 
all the old crud?  Any info would be appreciated!

Congrats on your "new car"!  A water pump at 44k is not that unusual.  I'm
told that the labor is about 8 hours book rate and a pump can  be had in the
$200 range.  Because of the labor already involved, it makes sense to go
ahead and replace the belts at the same time.  Clutches depend on how  you
 drive but most I know will go 60-70k.  Head gaskets-I'm no expert there but
if the car is chipped(how many aren't?) that puts more stress on it
especially if you do a lot of track events.  Also if you do a lot of track
events ie. sustained high rpms it is recommeended to change rod bearings
aboout every 50 hours-now we're talking real money!  I'd try to get the car's
maintenance history and also use a synthetic oil.  Enjoy!

If the amber stuff meets these specs (it'll say on the can), I'd use it.

This is a very frequently asked question. Please don't take this as a personal
attack. It's just the truth. Here are the answers:

1) NO. Period. No splits until I figure out how to deal with certain 
   issues of making sure that messages are dropped, mis-"filed", or otherwise
   don't go where they need to go. Period. If by "help" you mean
   "come to work for me full time at no pay to read and redistribute
   all of the messages where each meassage goes out within 15 minutes of
   coming in" then *THAT* might work.

2) Less unwanted mail is in fact a good thing. To better manage your
   mail load, select a service provider that allows you to run a 
   POP based mail program that lets you see the subjects and authors
   before downloading the mail. That way, if you're like me, you can 
   *VERY* quickly divide your incoming mail into "not interesting" -- 
   for me, anything about a water pumper that did not come from someone
   on a very short list of names, "interesting" -- for me, anything about
   racing issues, 356/914/911s, fuel injection issues, and general tech
   like tires and oil, "not sure" -- where the subject isn't sufficiently
   informative and the author is not someone that I already know I want
   to read whatever it is they've written. Everything that's in the 
   "not interesting" camp, I don't even bother. I just delete it. If
   I discover that I missed something, I can always fish it out of the
   archives later.

3) you can *JUST* use the archives. FTP over the previous month's mail near
   the first of the month. Read it at your leisure.

4) Read Uncle Bart's missive on the hows and whys of the list. This is a
   *SIDELINE*. It *COSTS* me money. Lots of it, as it turns out, over
   the five years the list has been on-line. So, as it turns out, I *do*
   get to make the rules...

   By the way -- my "real job" is about 85% done via e-mail. I get over
   150 messages a day *PLUS* the 100-150 from this list. *PLUS* another
   roughly 4500 failed mail/admin/etc messages to the "porschephiles-request"
   address. *PLUS* whatever sort of notes my friends around the world send
   me (btw, guys -- don't take this as me saying I'm too busy for you to send
   me mail!!!) So I don't care how strapped for time you think you are, or
   how much of a hardship you think it is to read all this crap. I've got
   *YOUR* mail load covered by at least 100% if not more.

5) if you *REALLY* want a lower traffic list, I'm sure that someone can
   provide you with the T*d's 911 list address. Low volume, and I'm told
   low content as well. Just the thing...

Subject: Dead 944S

Hi,
   I needed some help on a wierd problem.  I was driving my 944S to a
client's office, excited the highway and slowed down to about 40 mph when
the car died.  (It had to do it on one of the busiest streets downtown with
no place to pull over for a mile).  I tried to restart it.  The starter was
engaging....but didn't seem to have any effect (didn't sound like it was
cranking the engine correctly..but hard to tell in the heat of traffic). 
Paranoia set in because the timing belt is due to be replaced within the
next 5,000 miles....so I didn't crank it much.  Had it towed (by the way if
y'all get stuck in Austin...Southwest Towing did a marvelous job).  To
reassure myself spent the evening taking the cover of the timing belt..whew!
they're in good shape...(they were supposed to get replaced this weekend). 
The battery is new (about 2 weeks old), the starter recently rebuilt (about
3 months ago).  There seems to be power (radio, lights, etc. work).  Any
clues what I should go after next?

I'll be there Friday and Saturday.  Running a Red 84 944 with STREET tires,
this should set me apart from the crowd.  Don't know what CVR will assign me
for a number, but NNJR has me as 985 - YOU pick the Zone 1 event, and if it
is on a weekend, you should be able to find me (junkie in the making)

>How did your car handle?

Can't say much about *how* it handled.  Spent too much time trying to figure
out the tracke, figure out what turn was next, figure out where I should be
for next one, and this "heal-toe" thing..  Car did a fine job, I think it
will serve as an *excelent* learning car, but I do have my eye set on a an
air cooled jobber....

>Did you feel like the tires were sticky enough? 

NO.  The light bulb (second 180 degree turn) went in hot, went out hot, went
in slow, came out slow.  BUT, will learn on street tires to be smooth as
silk, and worry about speed next season!

>What speeds did you reach at the end of the front straight?

Well, let's see, told all my NON P-Car friends 180mph, but that won't fly
here, hit 120 once - got real good at putting my left hand out the window to

>Finally. how many miles are on your car, and how come you have gone through

81,000.  Lost my first one to the "pre-modified" version.  Lost my second one
at 40K to a rock burried in a washed out road up in Vermont that drove my
engine *through* my hood.  Can you say $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$?.  The third one

Subject: RE: '88 944 options

| From: "Glen P. Pilvre"  <GLEN@microlnk.ml.ee>
|
| Does anybody happen to know the engine options of an '88 944?
| If I'm not sure of the year, is there anything the car could be
| identified by? (excl. docs) The problem is I'm trying to buy one, but
| I've got  serious doubts about the year-number...
| Also, what should be the first things to check on this model?

In 88 there was a normal 944 (8 valve), an S (16 valve), a turbo,
and a limited edition turbo S (both 8 valve).

If it is not a turbo, the easiest way to tell if it is a 16 valve car is to
look at the engine. The 8 valve has the plugs between the intake
runners off to one side of the head. The 16 valve has a wide head
(to accommodate both cams) with the spark plugs running down
the middle.

The easiest way to identify the year is with the VIN number.
For an '88 8-valve, non-turbo US car, the VIN numbers ranged from
WPO ABO 94 - JN4 70001-79999
or with ABS
WPO ABS 94 - JN4 80001-89999
This is from the 944 spec book. I don't have the VIN ranges
for the S or the turbo. A dealer could provide that info.

BTW, the first thing to check is the service records. If there are
none, it is worth far less as there are a number of things that need
periodic maintenance (motor mounts, water pump, clutch, and
especially timing belts). If you don't have proof of these things
being serviced recently, then you could be faced with doing them
soon after you buy it. The presence of records also attests to the
care given by the prior owner. If there are no records, then a
pre-purchase inspection by a reputable mechanic is highly
recommended.

Well, the simple answer is "yes". It's a question of balance. The original
distributors have a total advance of about 27 degrees, and you start off
with a 3-5 degrees of initial static advance. That works pretty well. The
low initial advance improves power *SIGNIFICANTLY* at low RPM, but as
the R's go up, the advance comes on *quickly* in a manner that facilitates
rapid accelleration, until it's "all in" at a total of about 30 degrees
advance. 

The 031 has 30 degrees of advance, so if you start at 3 degrees, you'll
get to 33 degrees total, which is still OK (factory says that 35 degrees
total advance is about as far as you want to push it. They're right. You
can melt pistons, and break other stuff, if you have too much advance)

The 009 has 20 degrees of advance, so to get that 30-35 total advance,
you have to set the initial advance *WAY* up. That will not be good
for the engine and you can actually feel the poor response off-idle and
at low RPMs. Plus, the 009 has a slight offset in the #3 lobe, to
compensate for the overheating problems in the Type Is without doghouse
coolers. Well, guess what: that's *JUST*  exactly the same case as the
356s!! Problem is, the rest of the curve is just *SO* wrong...

The 050 has about 30 degrees, just like the original VJ4s and 022s, and
the later 031s, *but the curve is different*. As a result, acceleration
is somewhat impeded. You want more advance as you accellerate, and the
curve of the 050 is relatively flat compared to the 031, etc. You get
the same total advance, but you don't get it as quickly.

Bottom line: best bet is the original cast iron distributor, or an 031.
I've also started using the Crane breakerless in a friend's car that
I'm sort of acting as chief engineer for. It's very nice. Next stop, the
Permatune 6V CD system. If it all works well for him, I'll have to
consider it for myself. Of course, I *COULD* design a 6v crankfire
system....

Re: .050 vs. .009

     Yes, Stan, I like (and use) the .050's. Testing them on my Sun
Distributor Testing Machine, I've found the .050 to have 27-28 deg total
advance. With 3-5 degrees static advance, one can get 30-33 degrees  Total
high speed advance out of them, which with the gas these days is just fine,
thank you. (The .050's were used with alcohol-running VW's which could
tolerate more advance than gasoline-running VW's. That's why the .050's work
on Porsche 356/912's, which need more advance than the "normal" VW
distributors can provide. The ".009", ".010" and ".019" VW Distributors test
out at 20 degrees mechanical advance which is not  enough for Porsches.
      Original distributors have, from my experience and the  Sun's testing
results, only a 1 in 3 chance of being "usable". Some have 35+ degrees
advance, some have 15 degrees advance, and  some have NO advance! Even if
they do have the 30 degrees, the average original has a lot of "slop" in the
timing at steady-state- much more so than a new .050. Originals are also
"sticky" sometimes, coming down from 30 degrees many will "stick" at 15
degrees (or  so), and then sloooowly come down to 0. All this  while you're
adjusting the carbs and think that you're affecting the engine, but in fact
it's the distributor, not you! 
    Frankly, for my money I'd much rather put in  a new distributor that has
a  known, smooooth, continuous  27 degree advance than gamble on a sticky,
sloppy "original".
    Just MHO.

Bill,

There are a number of excellent facilities in the area.  I have
experience with two and have dealt with the other two in club
region affairs.  All have a long history of P-car service and
training.  If you need parts, they can get you about the same
price or maybe a bit less than the dealership - with the added
benefit of better service.  They can also supply track needs such
as engine and suspension work, brakes, dynoing, etc.
Feel free to e-mail me directly for more specific info.

If you have model specific questions, there are contacts within
the local region who field calls.  E-mail for details.

I'd start with that rebuilt starter.  Also check that you got your battery cables

I removed the housing which holds the seal "B" and then removed the
seal on the bench.  I replaced it (carefully) using the socket and hammer
technique.  The seals are different for the upper and lower balance shaft.

I used engine oil on the inside surfaces and no loctite.
I think the Haynes manual is useless for serious work.
Spring for the factory manuals.  You will learn more than the
$300 (or less if you have microfiche) worth.
I think Jim Pasha did an article for Excellence last year which
covered balance shafts.  I don't remember the issue. (Jim?).

I recall you might need to remove the plastic cover to access these parts.
If that is true, you will need to remove the crank sprockets for the
belts.  You will need the flywheel holder to do that and you will
need a pin spanner wrench to remove the balance shaft sprockets.
You will need the belt tensioning tool to reinstall the belts.
If you need to remove the cam sprocket (Can't recall if you need to
right now)  You will need the 12pt triple square tool for the cam bolt.
I know it hurts - but my experience is that using the wrong tool
will lead to an even more expensive repair.

You may be able to replace seal "B" without pulling the plastic
cover by removing the spacer and pulling the seal.

I bought the parts separately.

I want to confirm the recent postings about a part to replace the hinge
on the 944 console (aka cassette holder.)

You NO LONGER must buy the entire unit for approx $150.

You can buy only the 'hinge'; PN 944 552 553 01 010. It now costs $19.
(When introduced about 6 months ago the cost was $13.)

The reason I keep calling it the 'hinge' is that this part is actually the
entire plastic bottom and hingable top frame. It lacks only the upper padded
leatherette top, which you re-use from your existing broken console.

Tools needed for installation: 1 phillips head screwdriver.
Time for installation: about 10 minutes.

Sanjay

If your car suddenly slows ie dead engine, then it is unlikely to be 
because of your starter.

If it slowed without making a horrible crunching sound, then don't worry 
about cam belts

You have lost your ignition or your fuel pump or your fuel supply

If you loose the ignition you will also loose the fuel pump, because the 
fuel pump will not run unless the engine is turning.

So check for a spark - by placing a sparc plug on top of the engine, 
connecting it to no 1 wire and turning the engine over

If you have a spark, then it must be fuel related if you don't, then 
climb under the dash and waggle the wires in the fues box area - it is a 
birds nest of red wires - my car had a problem like yours and it was a 
loose wire feeding the electronic control box

good luck

Subject: B&B muffler for 993

     P-folk:
        Are any of you with stout heart, fat wallet, and excellent hearing 
     interested in B&B stainless-steel track mufflers for your 993? I 
     realize there are about 5 people on the planet who would be, but if 
     you're one of them, read on...
        The unit in question is brand new; just came off the dyno at B&B. I 
     had it installed a couple of days ago. It's gorgeous, with welded-in 
     4" end pipes.
        I bought the mufflers for dual street/track use. But they're a bit 
     loud for the former application. There's a pronounced boom between 
     2-3,000 rpm (a range you hotshoes never drive in, I'm sure). After 
     that, things gets quieter, resonance-wise, building to a nice snarly 
     shriek. The mufflers totally eliminate exhaust back-pressure, and you 
     find yourself revving very freely, with more bottom-end torque. The 
     change is quite dramatic. But then, so is the expression on my 
     neighbors' faces as I go rumpa-rumpa up the street.
        I'm going to run the units at an upcoming Driver's Ed, then they 
     come off and either go back to the factory or get sold to another 
     P-phreak. Price: $500. If anybody wants 'em, holler. (Holler extra 
     loudly, so I can hear you over the din...).

Agreed. If that were the only choice. However, an hour with basic hand

My boss is a new Porsche C4 owner still familiarizing himself with his new

1.He continues to have the "rotten egg" odor that was mentioned in a
previous message. So far Porsche hasn't satisfied him, although he has
another appointment to investigate this further; 
 2. He left the car unused in his garage for about one month while away on
vacation. When he returned his battery was dead. The car has about 3K on
its clock and is only about 4 months old. He says he's quite sure he didn't
leave his interior light or anything else on while away; 
3. What is the rationale for having to punch in or set or whatever a secret
code in order to make his radio work following the dead battery incident.
True, without the code the radio would be useless to a thief. But do all or
most thieves know this? He found it inconvenient to have to find the code
in order to reactivate his radio and wonders if this security feature is
worth the trouble. 
I told him about the porschephiles mailing list and said I'd post his
concerns and solicit comments from knowledgeable porschephiles. 
Any help or comments would be most welcome.

An atuox (autocross)  is a timed  event like  race usually run on a 
large parking lot. The "course" is usually outlined with traffic cones.

Classes are arranged by car type model. The porsche club, Sport Car Club 
of America sponser these events. 

These events are a perfect place and safe place to learn how to dirve 
the porsche at speed. The courses are designed for safety and for the 
challenge of getting through the corners quickly and smoothly.

Autox and salom are used interchangeably both are pretty much the same.

For additional informaiton take a look at the Sacramento VAlley Porsche 
club web page at: http://www.vpm.com/pca-svr/

There is an article on Autoxing as one of the pages.

The CD unit could be fried, but it could be some other things to.  Check 
out the fuses on the relay panel right behind the CD unit and check out 
the relays.  Like all electrical problems, it probably will take a while 
to chase down.  The early 911s with the dual batteries are 
particularly finicky.  The Bosch CD units ain't cheap.  Performance 
Products sells reconditioned units for about $700.  A lot of people 
replace the CD units with Permatunes when they go bad (undeer $200).  
I've used both Bosch and Permatunes on my '72 911T and couldn't tell the 
difference between the two.

The '76 914 should be able to hande the reformulated crap better than 
most because of its FI, but that doesn't change the fact that the gas 
is crap and doesn't help any engines.  It's the early models in the days 
before oxygen sensors and electronic systems that have the real problem.

Hi Folks -

Anyone have experience with Zimmermann brake rotors on their P-car?  For
an upcoming brake overhaul on my '83 SC, I ordered "OEM" rotors from a
usually-reliable aftermarket supplier (of p-philes FAQ fame).  They're
here, and they look like brake rotors... but some of the details are,
um, less than inspiring.  Let's just say that I hope that the guys doing
the casting and heat treating were paying more attention than the guys
doing the countersinking and number-stamping.  I see this brand
advertised elsewhere as well... has anyone else here tried them?  I only
ask because I recall a thread last winter where the 951 folks had to be
real careful of the pedigree of their rotors since many "OEM Quality"
parts warped...

You guys, Get some life and stop beating all these threads to death. If
you really want to know how to pronounce Porsche then please pay more 
attention to their commercials on TV or get on of there free promotion
video.

Oh! By the way how come nobody has responded to the question about splitfire

Subject: Corvair/914 update + Bought another 914!

Hello fellow Porschephiliacs,
	Just worked out a deal on yet another car!  I found the perfect 
914 to swap my corvair/914 parts into.  Its a yellow '75 914 with the 
engine and tranny out.  The guy was going to do a 914-6 conversion, but 
died before getting to it.  His widow sold the parts for the conversion 
to someone else, and wanted this car out of her garage.  It appears to be
rust free-I went over the body w/magnet and found only a small patch of 
filler, and the battery box was rusty-no surprise.  It needs new seats 
and carpet which I have.  All for $650 (she was asking $800).
	How much difference is there in the '70 and '75 models?  Will 
parts made to fit a '70 work in my '75?  I hope so, otherwise I'll have 
to dig out my drill...  :^)
	By the way, the corvair/914 still runs strong! Oh yeah, it has a 
fiberglass rear deck lid, is this rare?  Thanks for any advice!

Mike's right.  The point is, Porsche is the surname of a man that designed a
car and built a company around it, that is still owned to a great extent by
that family.  His name was Porsche (a soft "ah" at the end please).

It's really not pretentious, I just would want my name to be pronounced

that Americans are often accused of having very little of when traveling in

I feel I'm uniquely qualified to consult you on this.  I purchased my first
Porsche, a 1970 911T with S guages, Chrome Steel wheels, Silver with Black
interior, for $5000 in 1980, as a senior in high school.  I can tell you that
I worked my ass off for that car, and loved it more than life at the time
(witnessed by my intense driving and loss of license for 6 mos back then).  I
also did everything myself (replaced chain tensioners with mech ones, shocks,
paint, rust repair,etc.)

One year into college I parked my 911.  THe cost to replace the heat
exchangers conflicted with other trivial costs such as food, heat, etc (this
while going to a State College in NY that was relatively inexpensive at the
time).

I didn't have the heart to sell and kept the car garaged at my folk's house
while I drove a clapped out 1971 Toyota Corona that I purchased for $20 (NO
LIE!!) - the floorboards were held together by plywood!  In the end run, I
sold the car after I graduated to pay off student loans after correcting the
inevitable problems that surfaced with storage (frozen brake calipers, etc.)

When you're young you vote with your heart, and I don't want to take that
right from anyone.  But if you want advice - sell the car now, cut your
potential losses and disconnect yourself emotionally for a little while.  A
911 car is not a practical college driver, unless your folks can support your
habit - mine couldn't.  Get a nice VW 16V GTI if your folks can insure it, or
find the newest, low insurance, 4 door sedan that offers some driving
pleasure.

All us Pphiles, be here waiting for you when you get out, to give you lots of
advice on how to spend you Porsche money!!

A simple question for you technical adepts:
 While removing the lower valve covers on my '86
Carrera, several of the studs screwed out.  
When I put them back, should I put them back "plain" or
with some Blue Loctite ?  
 In the meantime, I cleaned the rusty ends of the studs
with a hand held wire brush and left them to soak in 
"Liquid Wrench".

Bonus question:  How do you tell what side is "out" on the

I realize this subject is a couple weeks old, but I have just got around to

The notion that the 911 is "goofy" and outdated is totally absurd. My wife
and I both consider our 993 to be the best looking car made. Period!
(Apparently many others agree, as  people constantly stop us to say how
gorgeous they think the car is.)

While some other "newer" styles (e.g. Supra-bleh, Acura) may be more eye
catching, they tend to look worse each time I see them, while the Porsche
just keeps looking better and better.

Subject: 911SC tire question

I sent the following questions to Bruce Anderson for possible inclusion in 
the Tech Q&A section of Panorama.  Bruce very kindly answered the 
question very promptly, which I take to mean that it wasn't of enough 
general interest to include in Panorama.  I'm passing the question on to 
the net since Bruce's answer left me with some outstanding questions.

March's article on tires like all good articles enabled me to ask more 
questions than I could have before.  In particular toward the end the 
article mentions yearly recommendations by Porsche for tire sizes on 
older cars.  The article even mentioned 195/65-15 for the older 15 inch 
wheels  Would you be able to publish Porsche's current recommendations for 
older cars?

Also, I am particularly interested in recommendations for 911SC's with 15 
inch wheels.  Stock for my year was 185/70-15 and 215/60-15.  Your (Bruce 
Anderson) book recommends 205/60-15 and 215/60-15 and Porsche's customer 
service recommends 195/60-15 and 225/60-15.  I thought that the 
difference in width was important for the over/under steer problems with the 
911, reasoning which suggests the 195 and 225 widths would leave the car 
closer to the factory configuration than your recommendation.  However, I 
believe that when Porsche went to 16 inch wheels they moved to 205/55-16 and 
225/50-16.  Also, I note that all Porsche stock specifications produce tire 
with the same un-loaded diameter front and back.

This reasoning has led me to think in terms of 205/60-15 and 225/55-15 
(yes, they make such a V or Z rated tire) for my car as a way to slightly 
improve performance but still retain factory compromises on handling and 
comfort.  These tires generate the same 24.7 inch diameter front and back; 
and match the width choices for 911SC's with 16 in wheels.

Finally, do you think the 225/60-15 tires will fit inside my 911SC rear 
fenders?

Can you clarify any of these issues for me?  Thanks in advance.


Bruce's answer helped me a little but didn't answer the crucial question 
of whether the 225/60x15 tires will fit inside the rear of my 911SC.

Also, Mr. Anderson mentioned that the only Fuchs wheels that worked 
well in the front are the 7x15" wheels for the 911R.  My wheels are 
7x15 in the front and 8x15 in the rear, while I believ stock was 6x15 and 
7x15 in 1980.  I suppose the reason for my 7's and 8's is that the 911 I 
bought is a "Weissach Edition".

Any advice on any questions raised above would be appreciated.

Interesting point. The worst case of "correct pronunciation" I ever heard
was from a Bjorn that I went to college with, quite the BMW geek.
He would say "le ma" in French for Le Mans, etc. But he would
pronounce Lime Rock as "lime ROHK", with a heavy 
accent on Rock. I was born and raised in Connecticut and 
never heared it pronounced like that!

What also bugs me is the pronounciation of Hyundai as "Hunday". But this
is the way the company wants it! It should actually be pronounced "Shit Box"
with the accent on the "shit".

I just got a control arm from Dynamic European Technologies in Houston,

Well, from what I have learnt from both experience, and from digging
through the archives I would say that 'C' should be replaced also. If
you take the 'spacer' out and clean it up, you will probably notice that
it has a wear line from the seal. This is why it was manufactured as
a separate replaceable item. It only costs a few $$'s , it's just not
worth not replacing

I think it's fairly safe to gently tap the seal into place with a socket and
soft hammer. All the seals  I recently replaced pushed in with hard finger
pressure (with a tap on a socket for good feeling/luck ).

I'm glad someone responed to the original poster . I was kind of waiting

first time I've 'sorted' the front of a {{second class porsche a.k.a

area. 

By the way, I would also recommend pulling the front housing off the camshaft
if you are doing the camshaft seals, and replacing the o-ring that seals this
to the housing. It's well worth the five minutes spent to eliminate another
potential source of 944-oil-leak.

Yep, any of those...of course, the hot ticket is the "7Jx15ET52.3" which

day for top off crusing in a car which now handles like a dream !

I decided to go for the Dunlop SP8000's (205/55ZR16 and 225/50ZR16) rather
than the Yoko's because I wanted rain performance and longevity for
these street tires.

Compared to the Eagle GT's on before it's night and day.  I also had the
positive 2 deg camber taken out of the rear and one front (the other front
was about vertical) and went to -1.75 and -.75 on the rear and front
(I think - I left the damn paper in the car).  Wow - I'd thought that
the discomfort and noise were all part of owning a handling car.  The
car is now smooth, quiet, and turns like *NOW* !  I'm gonna have to
learn to drive it again before I do something stupid !  It's like my
brain is connected directly to the wheels !!

With apologies to Queen:

ooooooo I'm in love with my car...

Told my wife I'd have to forget her,
Rather buy me a new set of rubber,
So she made tracks saying
"This is the end now!"
Cars don't talk back,
They're just four wheeled friends now.

(She didn't really leave because of the Porsche - but it's poetic license)

Subject: 944 clutch work reply

A late response to some discussion about how much work it is to do a 944
clutch (sorry this is so long):

Agreeing with the previous responses, it takes awhile--mostly because the
Haynes manual skips important points. Is the factory manual really not that
much better? I've been thinking about breaking down and buying one. I haven't
read it yet, but I think a huge thanks should go out to Michael Kehr for
writing the procedure on the porschephiles server. What would it take to get
Bentley to do a manual? If PCNA would license the factory manual for a
small(!) fee maybe it could be edited and slightly enhanced at a reasonable
cost. Or has someone out there done enough already that they want to publish
it?

Anyway, when I finally completed the job I earned a new level of respect from
my wife that I haven't lost yet. (And I saved around $800.)

If you think the rubber center is breaking up, replace it ASAP. Mine went out
in the middle of an LA freeway in heavy traffic and I had to force it out of
gear. I was able to get over to the side before I lost all speed; after 
about 10 minutes it dislodged itself and didn't give me further problems until
I replaced it.

I advise replacing the crankshaft pilot bearing and rear main seal at the same
time. Maybe this is common knowledge. The only hassle is the seal: it's only
$20, but the tool is $120. Does anyone make a cheaper one? I just used a large-
diameter plastic pipe, but I ruined one seal in the process.

I've only done it once, but feel free to call me anytime. I don't want to see
people go through what I went through. 805-447-2579 days

        Sounds like an Update the FAQ item--Walt, are ya there?
        Upfixen' der Porsche is not a title available at most bookstores.
It is a collection of all the Technical Q&A articles from Panorama.  The
articles are gathered together (once per year?  every two or three years?)
and put in a book.  There are at least seven volumes right now.
        Upfixen's are available through PCA or your local region.  You
can buy all of 'em, or just selected volumes.  BTW, if you want to get
all the volumes including 914 info, the cost is just a *little* bit less
than the "buy 'em all" price.

Well, she's out.  After a long, lonely winter in the OmniBag (if you

splendidly "goofy" as she went in last December 8.  Remember that post a 
bit ago about the "silly grin" - well, it's back and firmly in place for 
another eight months or so!

Some info some may be interested in from the storage results:

1.  No "flat spots" on the Dunlops (overinflated by 10 - 15 lbs before 
stored; rolled a foot or two twice during storage).

2.  Not a DROP - not even a HINT of any fluids whatsoever in the bag when 
she came out.  Four months of gravity at work and perfection.  No oil, no 
tranny fluid - nothing.  Clean as a whistle!  I love Carrera engines!

3.  Stored the battery in the basement on wood blocks.  Never got around 
to buying a charger.  First crank with the battery hooked up and the 
sweet purr filled the garage again!  No prob!

4.  Car was stored in second bay of a two car garage beside the daily 
driven (in salt, slush etc., much of which was brought into the garage) 
mini-van (now "track support vehicle").  However, it was stored in the 
OmniBag (sold locally, but I know they ship around the country (world?).  
Brake rotors, rubber seals you name it - clean and sweet as I left them 
when I stored the car.  Not a speck of rust or dust.  The outside of the 
Bag showed me what it saved me from - dust, lint, some salt marks 
(evidently from evaporation and condensation in the garage).  But the Bag 
kept it beautiful!  I'm a believer!

And finally, as we head into our first full season together, she has a 
name - Katarina.  Yes, German for my daughter's name - Catherine.  Is she 
goofy looking?  Not half as goofy as this grin I have on my face!  Let 
the Summer begin!

Subject: Track/street tires

In reference to your choices on tires for your 944, let me relate my
experiences with BFG's over a 5 year span on an '84 and '90 944. First the
R1's are tremendous autocross and track tires, the life is about 6-8000 miles
of combined street and competition driving, they work extremely well in wet
weather, even with minimal tread, provided it is warm outside.  Cold weather
performance is simply terrible, this is by design.  The only drawback other
than short tire life is a tendency to "nibble" on the road, in other words
follow any imperfections in the surface like cracks, trolley tracks or even
depressions in the highway caused by heavy trucks, this is easily
controllable but may be disconcerting at first. For advice on Yoko's you will
have to speak to someone else, sorry.

We're stuck with that junk here in Ky, too!  My daily drivers mileage was
reduced almost 15% - both cars on fresh tunes.  Have terrible cold starting
problems, as in 30 seconds of cranking prior to 3 minutes of sputtering(I
know, they sound like Porsches, don't they - but not).  I will say that I've
not notice any change in performance once the cars are plenty warmed up, but
they stuff is really obnoxious smelling - doesn't smell like gasoline at all.
 My neighbor told me last week that, while he was pumping gas, the lady next
to him complained loudly of its smell - a proceeded to puke all over the lot!

I'm like you - scared sh__less to pull the P-cars out of hibernation and try
to feed this stuff to them.  My 911's cranky enough on real gas.

Stan,
Thanks for all the information you provided it will be very helpful in my 
selection of a replacement for the 050 in my 69-912.  My question is this: I 
had acquired a new 'Mallory' distributor, should I install it?  The unit has 
an *adjustable* total crancase advance of between 16 and 32 degrees.  Before 
I install the unit I would like to know if anyone has already done this and 
if the advance curve is what I need to optimize my 4 cyl boxer. Also if set 
to 30 advance then should I set the timming at 950 rpm 3BTC or only consider 
the total advance ?

Ummm. You said some telling things in here: like "'69 912"...

Here's what I know: I have zero experience with this particular Mallory, but
used to use their high-RPM dual point setup on big-block Ford sprint cars
Back When. In general they make good products. I *HAVE* experimented with
the MSD "VW Billet Distributor" that also has an adjustable advance. I
find it to be a very useful item indeed for racing applications, but 
find it to be just another useless way to spend money for the street.
I'm a *REAL* big opponent of the "if it's good for racing, it's good for
the street" school of thought. There are very few things that are as
COMPLETELY false as that....

Anyway, your car came with originally with a Bosch 061 distributor that 
has a mechanical *AND* a "vaccuum advance". This "vaccuum advance" was
really a high-pressure vaccuum retard that pulled the advance "in" (i.e.
lower numerically) at idle. This let those particular cars pass emissions
tests. The "vaccuum advance" had no impact on the performance of the
mechanical advance part of the distributor once the car went off idle.
I forget the absolute pressure that it cut off at, but it wasn't too high;
just enough to get you in the 1-1.2K RPM range.

Now, if you live in an area under EPA interdiction, or an area that has
adopted CARB regulations on emissions testing, or for that matter, the
People's Republic of California, you *NEED TO FIND AN 061*. If you don't
you should consider it for completeness anyway. It's just the right
thing to do.

Since there's a significantly high probability that you'll ignore that,
I'll also tell you about the advance curve on the 022/031/061 series.
With the 022, there's zero advance until about 450 RPM, then a sharp slope 
up to about 15 degrees at about 650 RPM, then another linear slope up
from there to about 1600 RPM where the advance is "all in" at about 27
degrees. With the 031, the advance starts up from zero at about 650 RPM,
with the knee at about 15 degrees at about 900 RPM, then it's all in
at 27 degrees at about 1600 RPM. For those of you that care about these
things, this is crank degrees, "uninstalled"; the installed values are 
a little higher (same curve, shifted "up" for 3-5 degrees more advance 
at the same...

Anyway, bottom line is that if you can duplicate the curve, you can use
the distributor. It's just that I hate to see the elegance of the original
destroyed by aftermarket stuff that serves no purpose except to make you
feel good because you "had to" spend all this extra money on the car...

Subject: Rotten Eggs



According to my wizard son, if your Porsche smells like rotten eggs, it's
running too fat dumping raw fuel containing sulphur through the exhaust
system which burns up in the cat creating the rotten egg smell. This
condition is quite common in Japanese cars, especially brand new
econo-boxes. The Porsche fuel management system is supposed to prevent that.
Have it fixed before attempting a smog check.

Not that I know of. It's not seen as being so critical, with nearly
50 years of 356 "market development" and nearly 30 years of 911 "market
development" people have found or created sources for the parts that make
them affordable.

Sell it. As much as you (and I) love Porsches you're going to college
for something that will, hopefully, set you up for a life of Porsche
buying experiences  and you need as few distractions as possible - working
at some burger place or something just to keep the Porsche going is
not a sensible choice, IMO. 

Whilst not in the same league as a 911, I had a small collection of cars when I was 
at college (errm, 2 spitfires, 2 mini's, a Vauxhall Chevette, Chrysler Avenger) and 
it was the biggest waste of time and money! I ended up working on weekends and an 
evening or two at a supermarket just to survive and the amount of sweating & lost 
nights I did coming up to exams (and assignments) just wasn't worth it!! Doncha
love hindsight... :-)

That '70 will always be around in the future if you want to get another, and you
could get an 'S' next time.

This is in responce to the articles:

"US "legal" 959, Porsche pronunciation

One article stated that it does not matter how we pronunciate the name of 
the car we drive.
	
Okay, so I was born in America and not Germany. I speek a language that 
Americans believes to  be the language of world commerce. I feel it 
"aint" a problem to go around makin' fun of people I don't know. And as an 
American I obviously take a lot for granted.

Come on... 

I, and many people like me drive a "Porsch(a)" all day. Other people own a 
house and sit on our "porch" at night.

On weekends we enjoy autocrossing our "Porsch(a)s" Other people get to sit 
on their "porch."

Every now and then I like to clean my "Porsch(a)" Other people get to 
hose down their "porch."

Ya get the picture?

When I was in Europe I was smacked in the face with the reality that 
other people speek other languages and pronunciations vary. In England, to 
my surprise, they love to drive their "Jag-you-ares." In Italy there is 
nothing finer than blasting along the countryside in a finnely tuned 
"Ferrari." Nothing decent ever came out of France so who cares how you 
pronounce "Pairs"... (just joking...) Parie! Oh la la....

If you want to remain a stuck up American, go for it. Keep buying those 
"Christlr" "Vipprs" (as the Europeans would say) and quit buying 
the front end of everyones house and expecting it to take you anywhere.

Just a though from the peanut galery...

Welcome to the world of owning a 944. Depending on the model, you
could have gotten a quote between about $1600 and about $4000.
These are *REAL* numbers. It really does take that kind of time
to do the job. If you're expecting $300-500 like a "normal" clutch,

Jesus, you guys are really uptight on the "proper" way to pronounce Porsche.
 What I meant was that in some languages you pronounce proper names
differently from the original languages, e.g.  Muenchen, Deutschland, la Tour
Eiffel, and Kuempers.  My last name is German and when I'm in Germany it's
pronounced with the umlaut, in France it is prounced slightly differently and
lastly in English the U is pronounced without the Umlaut.  Do I care? No, if
it is easier for others to pronounce it that way and they pronounce the way
it is written then that's fine. As long as we don't pronounce Porsche like
Porch.  BTW, the French also pronounce Porsche without the e.  

Now can we all just forget about it. I'm sorry I got this started and have
wasted everybody's time. If somebody has a problem, then for the sake of
others, address me personally.

Subject: '73 911S oil cooler update

Hi,

I'd like to thank Jeff Shorey, Jim Calzia, Mike Piera and Steve Watson as
well as those who answered my question last week for their help. Here is a
quote that answers my original question:

Bruce Anderson (911 Performance Handbook, p. 56-57) and Porsche
workshop manual (V.III, sec. 1, model 72 on) indicate that an external
radiator-type oil cooler in RF fender was standard equipment on '69-72
911S.  Anderson adds that "the '73 S had optional loop-type oil cooler in
RF fender unless ordered with air conditioner". 

So '73 S with A/C couldn't get the loop oil cooler, which is nice to know. I
thought that mine was missing and was worried that I needed to get one.
Afterall, the owners manual did say that I should have one. 

Thanks again for your help,

I would not park in downtown Stuttgart and take the subway/commuter train
(unless you want to shop downtown). It's a hassle and quite expensive.
Instead you can park easily and cheaply at one of the suburb train stations
and go from there.

I think the following still applies, but don't know absolutely:
On Friday afternoon parts of the factory close a couple hours early. You can
then often park right outside the gates. Even during regular hours I never
had trouble parking, though sometimes it's a little bit of a walk.

Subject: 944 Turbo head gasket questions

Hello Phellow Philes

Earlier in the week I asked about a problem I had with my 89 951 venting about a 
gallon of coolant when I turned my car off after some spirited driving.  The 
answer from a fellow porschephile (thanks Jim) was possible head gasket failure 
(oh, no $$$).  After refilling and bleeding the system there have been no 
further incidents of displaced coolant.  No water in the oil or vice versa.  No 
overheating.

My question is...Is it possible for a head gaasket to leak 'just a little' and 
only under high stress applications?  Or is it usually a catastrophic failure?  
Will a leak down or compression test help diagnos the problem?  I am trying to 
determine if I am chasing a red herring before spending  many $$$ to fix a 
problem which may not exist.  Any comments greatly appreciated.  I have driver's 
Ed at Summit Point on the 4/14 and 4/15.  I do not want to go there with a leaky 
head gasket.  TIA.

Um, George, will 7J's fit on a '87+ 924S? I was under the impression that they

Please correct me if I'm wrong...

The wheel wells are mighty narrow, I doubt 7's would fit.  Besides, the
only tires that would fit would be fine on 6's, imho.
The ones i have are nice.  The ones I want for winter would have possibly
narrower tires.  Thanks to George or anyone who would have 4 6x15's.

There have been a few notes on this subject this week already.  Cruise the 
archives.  

Meanwhile, here is a brief summary of what I know:

Depends on your system, mailer, etc.  I use a unix OS, so have access to
LOTS of goodies.  With the elm mail reader, you can set up a .forward file
to send all incoming mail to the filter program.  The filter program has
easy to understand syntax, and I do things like:

if (subject contains "subscribe") then save /dev/null
if (to contains "porsche" and subject contains "924") then save "Mail/924"
if (sender contains "porsche" and subject contains "924") then save "Mail/924"
if (from contains "porsche" and subject contains "924") then save "Mail/924"
.
.
.

anything falling through ALL the rules gets dropped into my mail box.  I have
94 rules currently, so I get about 10 messages a day into my general mail, and
everything else gets filed by subject matter.

You run the risk of not noticing something if it has a filtered word in the
wrong place, but you also get to view messages by subject without plowing
through them when you don't want to.

Another program called procmail does something very similar, with harder to
understand syntax.  It will allow you to search the entire body of a message,
not just from, sender, to, etc. header records.  It is more robust in that
respect, but does require a lot more effort to install and set up.

Outside of unix I know NOTHING, so don't ask <g>.

If shaving Comp TA R1 tires improve handling and in fact prolong the life of
the tires (less rubber lasts longer), why does'nt BFG just sell those tires
at the correct depth or pre-shaved?  Why do we have to pay extra to get them
shaved to get better wear?  All this seems contradictory, but I am sure that
there must be some scientific explanation to do with heat cycles and
dissipation, and surely, the government must have had a say about tread
depth.

I just bought replacement R1's and they are yet to be shaved.  If I shave
them, there would be no gooves left on the outside surface and I will be

Can I shave seconds off by shaving the tires?  I did not shave my last set

a big deal out of the pronunciation of Porsche is being silly. He even
pronounces it Porsch in the USA. I find that I pronounce it Porscha when I am
talking to Germans or owners who know how to pronounce it and Porsch when I talk
to owners of Cadillacs and others who have no idea what a sports car is. BTW,
when I am in Germany they all pronounce my last name Kanopp, and it certainly

Subject:   Hey , easy on the oil buddy!

Now that I have your attention...      :)

How much oil should a 1988 911 with 70000km be burning?

Both the dash indicator and the dipstick indicate that I've
burned close to a full tank in about 4 tanks of gas (2500 km).

Wow, both indicators show the same thing!   Isn't 
technology grand?

Also noticed some blue smoke when starting after being 
parked for 5 days.   Seemed to go away once the car settled
into a regular idle.   Never seen this with the "rice-burners"
I've run in the past (the blue smoke part, not the regular
idle).

Consumption seems _high_ but what do I know?   This is my
first Porsche.   At this rate I don't have to worry about 
oil changes.   :)

Does being in storage over the winter have any bearing on
this?

If this is the reality of owning a 911 I'll deal with it but
if it's not I need to do something about it.

Dave, you're absolutely correct.  That's what most cheap
spray guns do.  That's why they're not worth it.  And
that's why I alerted the group to an inexpensive gun
that didn't do these things
It's a genuine bargain.

Subject: 924 wheel sizes



For the 924 with 5-bolt wheels and four-wheel disc brakes the following 
wheel sizes will work:

	Front:			Rear:
	6J x 15			6J X 15  Spider-web OEM wheels 1979-82

	6J x 16			6J x 16  OEM 928-style wheels
					 used in 1980-82 and 1986-88
					 optional

	6J X 15			6J x 15  Phone dials, 928 offset
					 OEM on 1986-88 924S


Here's what else fits:

				7J x 16  928 wheels, requires a 1"
					 spacer at rear for inside 
					 clearance
				7J x 15  phone dial, 928 offset or 1987
					 or later 944 std. wheel

If you play with the spacing on the front, you can use a 7 x 16 on the 
front with a 205/50 x 16 tire. Watch for strut interference. 

I have stuffed 7" x 16 fronts and 8" x 16 rears with 205/50 and 225/50
tires under my own car with custom, three piece wheels. They do clear.

Subject: Re: Parking at the Factory

Pierre asked about parking at the factory:

You should have no problem parking if you don't mind a modest 5-10 minute
walk.  When you follow the Porsche signs to Werk II in Zuffenhausen, turn
left (Museum sign) on what I believe is called (cleverly) Porschestrasse.
 You'll see an entry gate and museum as the street makes a sharp turn to the
right.  Keep going until you find a space (I've always found one at least up
by the Opel dealer, about 1 1/2 blocks straight on).

When you walk back, try the employee office building entrance rather than
going through the guard gate.  (It's on the right just before you make the
sharp turn with the guard gate straight ahead).  If you can get in (sometimes
it's locked), take a quick left down the hall and you'll be in the customer
delivery lounge.  Good place to get some coffee or orange juice and a armful
of the latest quality brochures.  They can also give you a "besucher"
(visitor)  sticker badge or you can get one at the gate if you go in that way.
  After the museum, try (they'll tell you that you can't if you ask!) and
walk up to the upper level where the new cars awaiting delivery or shipment
are located.  The color array of 200 or so new 911s is gorgeous.  

Enjoy yourself!

Subject: Model age or Mileage

Ok, I'm the toyota guy (hopefully I can live down this monicker).

Anyway, as most of you know I am in the middle of a search for the 
perfect (for me) 911SC.  Firstly, I want to ask a general question.  What 
is more important on the SC, the age of the car or the mileage.  For 
example, if there was a 1979 911SC with 100,000 miles and a 1983 911SC 
with 127,000 miles, what would be the better choice, all things being 
prety much equal?  

Specifically, I have a quasi problem.  I have a really good friend, whose 
friend is an owner of a very respected Porsche garage here in San Diego.  
They also run a small dealership.  Yesterday in the auto-trader there was 
listed a 1983 911SC Targa with 127,000 miles.  I called the dealer and as 
it turns out, it was my friends' buddy's shop.  The car was serviced 
there and he said it was in great shape.

If I were to look at any other cars, I would without hesitation take it 
to this guy.  But when he is selling a car, there is a conflict of 
interest, that gives me pause.  Once I get a SC I will take it to this 
guy for any work on it.  I think I can trust him, but...

Thanks for your time,

Tim

OK. About $500 for the clutch plus another $100 for overnight shipping and
$100 for pure profit on the part. Don't assume that your mechanic spends
much time shopping around. It's tough to bill for that time. I normally
double the lowest price that I can find, so that the sticker shock doesn't
kill me when I finally see the bill. Think about things like $25 window
wipers and $5 quarts (liters?) of oil. You've probably paid those prices.
Why sweat it now. Your mechanic could just hit you on labor instead. If
he's a good mechanic who spots the cheap fixes early in the game, it
probably worth it. 
 
Porsche's are expensive toys. In the last 14 months, I have spent far more
than the original cost of the car on parking (NYC, where having a reserved
parking space runs $500/month), insurance, paintwork and service for my
$7500 944 Turbo. Really makes no financial sense. In that context, $700 for
clutch parts shouldn't make you flinch. 
 
BTW, the 29 year old mechanic owns an Aston Martin POW-spec Vantage, Range
Rover, 911 street car, 911 track car, etc. and collects Rolex Daytonas. I
believe that he is currently shopping Ferraris (he is starting to service
them, so it makes sense to have one for the track). Makes me wonder how the
guys with the full page Pano ads do.

|
| Earlier in the week I asked about a problem I had with my 89 951 
venting about a
| gallon of coolant when I turned my car off after some spirited driving.  The
| answer from a fellow porschephile (thanks Jim) was possible head 
gasket failure
| (oh, no $$$).  After refilling and bleeding the system there have been no
| further incidents of displaced coolant.  No water in the oil or vice 
versa.  No
| overheating.
|
| My question is...Is it possible for a head gaasket to leak 'just a 
little' and
| only under high stress applications?  Or is it usually a catastrophic 
failure?
| Will a leak down or compression test help diagnos the problem?

The head gasket on my '84 944 failed gradually over about a 3 month period.
The first symptom was a small burp of water out ot the expansion tank overflow.
This happened a couple of times over a several week period. Then it started
overheating and losing water. I never did get any water in the oil 
(luckily, didn't
have to change the rod bearings) or vice versa. On teardown, the failure was
clearly in just one small area between the #1 cylinder and a water passage.
I put a straight edge accros the head which appeared slighly warped in the
vicinity of the leak, so I had the head milled. I also had a valve job 
done while
the head was in the machine shop (130K miles on the car).

I didn't run any track events or otherwise stress the engine during 
this period.
Also this is a normally aspirated car. A turbo will have much higher combustion
chamber pressures and the gasket would probably fail faster.

It only showed about a 10 pound loss of compression just before the repair.
A month earlier there was no noticable loss of compression from that cylinder.
I don't know if a leakdown would have shown more.

I understand that there is a dye that you can put into the water system 
that will
change color if exposed to combustion products. That sounds like the best
test to try. Perhaps someone else knows the details of it.

I suppose it is also possible that your thermostat had stuck closed. I 
don't know
if this is very likely or not.

Good Luck!

I stopped to get gas in my 924 one fine day in 1989, and when I got back
up to speed on the interstate I noticed the temp gauge climbing.  I backed off
the speed, pulled over to the side of the road, shut down the engine, and
poked around.  I couldn't find anything obviously wrong, so I re-started the
car and drove a couple of miles to the next exit where I got off and headed for
a service station with a phone to call for a tow.  I gathered after the fact
that the engine overheated badly during this process.  I thought maybe I just
had a bad temp sensor driving the gauge.  After I got it hauled home and 
started tearing in became clear that the thermostat had failed closed.  I 
swapped it out, and was able with some difficulty to get the car started again.

There had clearly been some head gasket failure and/or warpage as a result of
the overheating, as I averaged about 1-2qt/day of coolant loss on a cross-
country trip a week or so later.  Nothing in the oil, and water on at
least one plug when the engine was cold.  Made it a real bear to start, but
it ran fine once I got it going.  Seemed pretty obvious to me that I
was leaking coolant into at least two cylinders, before the end.  I had 
scheduled a teardown to get it fixed, but a young lady "solved the problem" 
for me before I could get it done by running a light and totalling the 924 
on my way to work...

So, a thermostat *can* fail closed, and the resulting overheating if not
noticed and understood fairly quickly can cause real damage.

Subject: Porsche shrunk 944 Repair Manual Fiche to 4"x6"

I decided to go ahead and get the 944 Repair Manual on fiche,
figuring I could pick up a large format viewer pretty cheap.
So, I ordered the fiche (PNA 000 127) from the local dealer.

When it came in, I was surprised that it was a 10 fiche set
in the more convenient 4"x6" size, not the larger 8"x10" size

The wheel wells are mighty narrow, I doubt 7's would fit.  Besides, the
only tires that would fit would be fine on 6's, imho.
The ones i have are nice.  The ones I want for winter would have possibly
narrower tires.  Thanks to George or anyone who would have 4 6x15's.

Hey Dudes,
	So that's what the subject has to read in order to avoid trashbins which 
are strategically placed to catch any unwanted messages?  We can help ourselves 
here.  Who gives a shit about how the word is pronounced, as long as we all enjoy 
the cars.  I can understand why people want to set op mail filters; there is too 
much unnecessary stuff being plastered.
	When I joined the philes I saved a bundle of time and cut short a 
continuing headache because a solution was offered to my problem within 1 day by 
one of the best on-line diagnostics on the net: Yes you George.  It is people like 
you, and Peter, and even Stan can be tempted into replying to water pumper 
questions when they appear sensibly.  
	Being a what I would call poor Porsche owner (which is why I have a 944 
and not a 911) this list is proving invaluable for questions relating to specific 
problems and or parts availabilities.  I am a 'home mechanic' and work on German 
cars for fun (sometimes) but with prices for parts and service in the 'States' the 
fun can be short-lived; this list makes the fun last longer.  I am of the opinion 
that you *can* maintain these cars yourself, the technicalities in these motors is 
nothing special (yet).  You do make stupid mistakes when you start; that's where 
this list is proving invaluable; there are lots of us, some of us have been there.  
The days of the home mechanic are numbered with the advent of new engine 
management systems and more complex sensors, we can extend our own days by keeping 
up with some of this development on the net and by sharing our 
experiences/solutions.  Volney Spalding (proud patron) has contributed in a way 
that he can (and selling SG equipment at the prices they charge he should be able 
to!  Sorry Vol...)  I hope to be able to give unka Bart some dough after my next 
paycheck, and have been saying the same thing for the last two months. Now I need 
to save that same dough for a knee operation coming up. So in order to feel that I 
am contributing something I have been trying to respond to questions on technical 
issues whenever possible (but George usually beats me to it).  Just wait George, 
as I'm having to repair more things on this 944 I'll get quicker on the draw...

Hello allrad mavens!  I am about to re-tire the '90 C4 for the summer and
have the following technical question:

Will dissimilar tire diameter cause any bad or maybe even good effects as far
as the differential-locking computer is concerned?

It seems like if one uses front tires that are larger diameter than the rears
(as in 205/55-16F on 7" and 245/45-16R on 9"), the rear will be turning
slightly faster and maybe cause the front to be given more torque or some
such.

How does this work in practice?  What would be good tire sizes for 7x16 front
rims and 9x16 rears (this is what I have from factory race department in
1991)?

My sap is rising here in sunny Ohio.

The effect on the computer will not be noticeable, as long as the
differential in circumference front to rear is negligible. 

Your ABS may give you an indication that it is not working properly, but
check your owner's manual for specifics.

My guess is that Porsche will have similar restrictions to those that Audi
has for their Quattro cars...

Of course, I could be dead wrong. :-)

Subject: 356 carb problem

Could be several things. Dirt in the carbs. Carbs are fairly easy to clean,
just get a good manual with a good exploded view so all the jets go back in
the right place. If you don't have compressed air, one of those little
bottles used to clean lenses and cameras and such, available at the art
store, will work fine. Use carb cleaner, wear safety glasses to keep from
getting carb cleaner in your face (you never know which opening it will come
out of when you put air through it).

Second possibility, needle valve for admitting fuel to the float bowl is
hanging up. If you are sure that this problem is confined to one carburetor,
maybe try swapping the valve between carbs to see if the problem moves with
it.

Here's a way to check that needle and seat assembly once you have it out of
the car: suck on it (pretend you are the float bowl.) It should hold a
vacuum, that is, stick to your tongue. Also try tapping the assembly on a
surface like a piece of wood (to avoid damage) to dislodge and dirt that may
keep it from seating properly.

Is your fuel filter ahead of (tank side) or behind (between pump and carbs)?
It should be ahead of the pump (I know, most people put it downstream, I
plead guilty). The pump should be pulling through the filter. It is possible
that there is some dirt jamming the pump outlet or filter inlet, and floating
around in there causing intermittent blockage. Pull to pump cover and check
for dirt on the screen.

(Later) Alan Henderson correctly pointed out that you should also check the
filter below the gas tank. Easy to do. Close the valve (inside cabin, below
center of dash), get underneath, unscrew wingnut on filter bowl, take out
screen, check and clean.

Other possibility, but very remote, is that you have some sort of vapor lock
problem. But that wouldn't explain why only one side seems to have this
problem, unless you have somehow misdiagnosed it as being confined to one
carb.

One last word -- don't install Webers to fix this problem.

Was very surprised. It was a great lecture and I learned at least as much

cleaning the car. Like hard Bosch wipers will wear out soft Porsche
windshields, like Armorall leaches plastic and vinyl, like Larry sells the
original Porsche touchup paints which are unobtainable from dealers, etc.
Also was convinced that cleaning the two dirtiest spots on my car, engine
and wheel wells, was safe and easy, with the right materials. 
 
Larry sells most of the Wurth, Sonax, P21, etc. cleaning and conditioning
products. Hundreds of them. And he details the uses of each one. I don't
know of another one stop source for this type of thing. Definitely hit him

Howdy P-Philers!
  I've got a question for those of you with intimate knowledge of the door
handle.  The problem is that the outside handle does not travel far
enough to unlatch the door.  The interior handle works perfectly.

  I took off the interior panel and 'played' with the mechanism for
a while and came to the following conclusion.  The problem is that the
metal part connecting the door handle latch to the lever that releases
the door latch doesn't travel far enough.  Where the bototm of the
metal part there are threads that could be unscrewed to "elongate" the
travel enough for the handle to work.  
  I looked in the haynes manual, and it vaguley says to spread apart
the connector and unatach..  It is a small plastic piece, and I don't
want to break it..   Is this the only method?  If so, how hard should
I pry at it?  Could I adjust this metal pieces postion at the top?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!

anyone seen this before? Does anyone know who might be able to recognise
this? Should I even be worried? 'cause I am right now. I plan on autoxing
it tomorow and a co-driver is also likely. Should I subject the car to an

Corbett,

I cannot disagree more with anyone who says "not to rebuild" your brake
calipers.  It would be an excellent time to do this!  After ten years the
brake seals can become quite brittle and can easily be broken.  What can
happen is that a seal will crack, and let fluid leak past, resulting in no
braking pressure.  Chances are that it will happen at a very inopportune
moment, with unhappy results.  I rebuild my calipers every other season (or
after about 10 events).  Even after this short a time, the boots become
brittle, and the seals are much "stiffer" than new ones.  Remember that you
are taking your car onto the track, and components that would last many years
on the street will "age" very quickly under the heat and stress of track
driving.

Ok, this is reassuring.   It is quite different from my previous

like this occur and it was driven with the same frequency as
my Porsche.   Probably have to make some allowances for the
Porsche being an older design?

After paying closer attention to the oil level guage, it seems
that the dash guage indicates about 3/4 full once the engine
is at operating temp.   Also noticed that it can vary some
with both longitudinal & lateral G loading and engine load.
Of course this makes sense.

All of my previous cars haven't had anything like this 
so it is quite a novelty still, maybe that's why I'm
hyper-sensitive to its needle position.   My first air-cooled
engine as well so this just compounds it...

Either way, you lose.
      Other possible problems include a weak/bad fuel pump. a dead bug in

Subject: Need Info on 911 Turbo S2

Fellow porsche enthusiasts:

I would like to find out more information about my car. The model is a 1992
Turbo (3.3L engine), with the 'S2' designation, which means the addition (I
believe) of the K27 compressor wheel, larger intercooler (what size- is it
the same as the factory 3.6 turbo intercooler?), and some other
modifications. I know that Brumos Motorcars/Porsche Racing NA raced these
cars in '92-'93- I bought the car from Brumos and received some additional
racing parts with it.
I believe this modification debuted in the US after the 911 'Turbo S' car was
introduced in Europe, but that model included a duct in the rear fender and
other body changes. 
Someone mentioned that Car and Driver raced the S2 against the 3.6, and it

Subject: pronunciations--into the fray

Pronunciations are culture specific.  Once they migrate, all bets are off.

My sister-in-law once asked about my porch and I replied "I need to replace
some rotton boards this spring."  In Siam, Porsche is pronounced (or known
as) "Paw-che" the "P" is unaspirated and the frist syllable is middle tone,
"che" is pronounced as in "Che Guevara" but with a falling tone.

My own name is pronounced anyway you'd like in American English (most people
give up after the first name), but in its original cultural context, it is
pronounced "Tuck" in which the "T" is aspirated, the word is high tone and
ends with a glottal stop.  I can give a lesson on the last name, but I doubt
whether many will remember.  When asked by a store clerk once, I made the
mistake to tell him that (he should not bother writing it down because) it
was "long, very."  The next thing I heard that he had called my office
looking for a "Mr. Long"!

I continue to enjoy driving my "Paw-che" (plural).

Subject: Mystery 914 air filter

	Well I went home and tried to solve the bucking problem with my 
914 1.7. The pressure sensor seemed fine and disconnecting the throttle 
switch seemed to make the problem go away. So I removed the throttle 
switch, cleaned the contacts and put it back in. Everything seems pretty 
good now, but it still idles rough until warm.
	 When I removed the airbox I realized there didn't seem to be an air 
filter. So I went to a shop to get one and the one they had for a 914 
1.7 didn't fit. What's going on? Do I have a non-stock air filter housing? 
Looking at the drawings in the Automobile Atlanta catalog (haven't 
gotten a manual yet) externally it looks similar and it seems to fit 
right in, and the airfilter I tried to put in looks a lot like the one 
they've got in the catalog but it didn't fit. 
	There seems to be some sort of oiled-foam filter encased in a metal 
housing that fills most of the airbox which didn't seem to be removable (I 
didn't try to force it, though) and a baffle or something that the 
apparently stock airfilter seemed to just fit inside. Could this strange 
setup be causing my rough running problems (different vacuum signal due 
to non-stock intake parts)?

Hi Marc,

basically, you are doing the right thing to remove the 
sunroof but your ignition key is not set 
at the proper position...

To remove the sunroof:

1/ Make sure it is closed:
While the car is on, press the sunroof button 
until it tilts down and it is completely closed.

2/Turn off the car.

3/ The ignition key has 3 levels. Turn the ignition key 
                                  ---------------------
only *ONE* notch to reach the first level.
- -----------------------------------------
At this point, press the sunroof key. You should
hear a faint unwinding noise. Keep pressing until the noise stops.
The hook is now off.

4/ Unhook the front manually. Press upward the back of 
the sunroof. At this point, you should be able to 
slide it out.

Regards,
Andre Roctchel.

Subject: 914 CV Joints and other stuff

          Just dropped the burnt-out 1.8 from my '74 914.  Replacing
          it with 2.0 from a '75.  Gonna rebuild it before installing.

          Anywho, I need to rebuild/replace the CV joints.  Original
          plan was to:
          (1) Remove entire half-axles (incl stub axles)
          (2) Replace rear wheel bearings
          (3) Clean CVs, install new boots and pack with Sta-Lube
              CV grease
          (4) Replace the one that was clunking

          Some of you may remember my question last month about how
          to get off the axle nut.  I have long cheater pipe but I
          have been rethinking.  Is it worthwhile to go to the trouble
          of removing stub axle to get to bearings?  Someone said that
          I will need a slide hammer to get out the stub axles --
          where do you attach the slide hammer?  DO you need to remove
          the outer CVs first or can I pull the whole thing as a unit?

          Also, I noticed while replacing the rear rotors that the
          left rear training arm can be moved laterally a few mm.  The
          other one is rock solid.  Is this an adjustment problem or
          does it mean that the trailing arm mount is shot?  From what
          I can tell, the trailing arms mount with a big piece of
          threaded rod that is encased in rubber in the trailing arm.
          Then the trailing arm is mounted to the body.  I have never
          seen where I would need to install bearings or bushings yet
          the catalogs offer urethane bushings for the rear trailing
          arm.  I apologize for being ignorant on this area, but I
          have never seen a 914 rear suspension completely
          disassembled.  I don't want to screw anything up like I did
          when I started hacking away at my Triumph.

          Thanks, Tim Radsick

          P.S: When I removed the engine, I noticed that the front
          engine mounts had both sheared off through the rubber.  Is
          this common?  And one more thing... Is there a better CV
          grease to use than the Sta-Lube.  Perhaps a moly-synthetic?

Subject: checking for chipping?

While looking at a couple of '87 944 cars for sale, I was told that
one of them is noticably faster than most such cars. It also has
16 inch wheels and I wonder if this means that the car may have
been chipped. Is this likely, or is there sufficient variation
in performance for such differences to be normal.

Here in the UK, chipping would possibly invalidate insurance cover
if not declared. How could I find out as the car is at a dealer
who may himself not know if the car had been chipped. 

Any comments would be welcome.

Subject: Transaxle Noise, NOW WHAT?!!!

Well I am hoping for the worst but that's because I don't have
a CLUE. I would like to hear the diagnostic from the list 944
Experts specially ( but not the least) from those members on 
the Cc list. 

Yesterday, I took my 85/2 944 with 51,000 mile, for a cruise.
Soon after exiting the highway (about 1/2 mile ), while
making a right turn, a loud clunking noise started to come from
the rear axle. I pulled the car to a side street and couldn't
find any thing visible wrong with the transaxle. The clunk
appears to sync with each revolution of the wheel. However, the
clunking noise seems to disappear in the reverse. 

So, I drove the car at a snail speed ( < 2 mph ) to the nearest
phone (1/4 of a mile).  After having it towed to my house following
are the existing symptoms.

1. Loud cluttering/clunking noise in the forward direction.
   ( in gear ). Seems to be comming from inside the transaxle.

2. Slight noise in the reverse. It was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth.

3. Slight noise in neutral. It also, was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth.

4. When rolling the car in the forward direction there is a point
   where the wheels appeared lock and would not turn. However, a 
   slight push in the reverse direction will unlock the wheels to 
   move forward, for a couple of wheel revolutions.

5. The gears seems to shift normally. A little hard shifting into
   reverse ( again, All together now; "It was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth" ).

6. After raising the car and turning the wheel, the noise seems to
   be coming from the transaxle.

The CV joint boots does not show any grease leakage and appears
normal. Since there is some noise when the car is in neutral
so can I assume that it is not the linkage? 
Rear wheel bearing? I thought that it was a problem in the early
944's.

Beside this I don't have any clue as to what is wrong. All I can
tell you is that I replaced the transaxle oil last year with
Redline MTL(80-90??).

Jim Pasha and Kevin Gross I would greatly appreciate your opinion
and comments. Jim , sometime ago, I remember reading your transaxle
article in Excellence. Would you happen to know, what month
was that issue for?

Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

I have a 1972 914 with a rear shift 901 trans.  I owuld like to replace it

parts difference is the rear case and the shift assembly.

The side shift mechanism enters the post '73 case at the point there is a
cover on the 1972 rear shift case.  Is it possible to convert these
transmissions?  Is it worth it?  My '72 is fresh.  If I happen to get a

Subject: distributors and such

Lately, there has been some discussion about distributors for the 356. Stan
called it right: unless the engine has been significantly modified from stock,
anything but the factory advance curve falls under the heading of "cash
generating device."
 
Stan points out that:
>The original
>distributors have a total advance of about 27 degrees, and you start off
>with a 3-5 degrees of initial static advance. That works pretty well. The
>low initial advance improves power *SIGNIFICANTLY* at low RPM, but as
>the R's go up, the advance comes on *quickly* in a manner that facilitates
>rapid accelleration, until it's "all in" at a total of about 30 degrees
>advance.
>The 031 has 30 degrees of advance, so if you start at 3 degrees, you'll
>get to 33 degrees total, which is still OK (factory says that 35 degrees
>total advance is about as far as you want to push it. They're right. You
>can melt pistons, and break other stuff, if you have too much advance)
>The 009 has 20 degrees of advance, so to get that 30-35 total advance,
>you have to set the initial advance *WAY* up. That will not be good
>for the engine and you can actually feel the poor response off-idle and
>at low RPMs. Plus, the 009 has a slight offset in the #3 lobe, to
>compensate for the overheating problems in the Type Is without doghouse
>coolers. Well, guess what: that's *JUST*  exactly the same case as the
>356s!! Problem is, the rest of the curve is just *SO* wrong...
 
[Right on, Stan!!!]
 
>The 050 has about 30 degrees, just like the original VJ4s and 022s, and
>the later 031s, *but the curve is different*. As a result, acceleration
>is somewhat impeded. You want more advance as you accellerate, and the
>curve of the 050 is relatively flat compared to the 031, etc. You get

>Bottom line: best bet is the original cast iron distributor, or an 031.
 
To which Pellow replies
>Original distributors have, from my experience and the  Sun's testing

Sounds like Monty Python, the little old ladies who can't tell the difference
between Whizzo Butter and a dead crab. Comparing correctly functioning
original distributors (which aren't already junk or sorely in need of a
rebuild) with new units would be more appropriate.
 
And Stan comes back with
>Ah.... So *THAT'S* why they have rebuild parts available! 8{)
>an hour with basic hand
>tools and an NLA.602.101.50 (shim and washer kit), NLA.602.650.04 (advance

Pellow:
>Yes, Stan, I like (and use) the .050's. Testing them on my Sun

>advance. With 3-5 degrees static advance, one can get 30-33 degrees  Total
>high speed advance out of them, which with the gas these days is just fine,
>thank you.
Pellow still doesn't get it, the curves are WRONG! And they will stay wrong
even if you set the same total advance as the stock distributors. He just
doesn't grasp the concept that total advance isn't the total story. Midrange
matters too, in terms of advance curve slope and begin/end, as already
described so well by Stan.
 
                                  .....
 
Self-appointed experts, with personal agendas (read: increased sales of
whatever dreck they have sitting on the shelves) notwithstanding, there is a
reason the factory chose a given advance curve. There is a right curve, and
then there are all sorts of wrong curves, for all the wrong reasons, for any
given engine configuration. If you change the configuration, maybe, MAYBE
you need a different advance curve. Maybe you only need to vary the static
timing to allow for different cams/compression/etc. Whatever, the only way
you are ever going to find out for sure what that optimum curve should be is
by spending time and money on a dyno. Most people who recommend some
different-from-stock advance curve for a different-from-stock engine have
never actually gone out and spent the money to determine the optimum curve.
They may recommend a certain distributor and a certain maximum advance using
knowledge (presumably gained at the cost of detonated-to-death engines) that
it won't cause any particular harm, but they don't know (although they may
even believe their own PR) that it's any improvement on stock. Once
you know how a carmaker arrives at a particular advance curve, you can see
why there is ONE correct advance curve for that engine. This is basically the
same argument as the current craze for "chips" to "improve" the factory's
tuning of the Motronic box. (See Hanks, Stan, "Cash Generating Device." Many
previous posts.)
 
While I was at Porsche, we had the following procedure for determining the
curve for an engine with non-adaptive ignition. The engine is mounted on a
dyno and run with individual cylinder knock sensors, a knock sensor on the worst
cylinder, or just the trained human ear. For laboratory purposes, you can use
special water-jacketed spark plug adapters, made by Kistler, AVL, and others,
that permit piggybacking a piezoelectric pressure transducer on any standard
spark plug port. Or machine a laboratory head with ports for piezo pressure
transducers on each combustion chamber. Or use a standard production knock
sensor if the optimum location for that engine has been determined (you can't
just stick them on the block like one of those toilet deodorizer things.)
 
For any given rpm a curve is plotted for horsepower vs. ignition
advance, up to the knock limit. This is done at several different rpms.
We called these "Zuendhaken" ("ignition hooks") due to the shape of the
curve. They might look something like this: (a purely hypothetical curve; if
this doesn't look right on your reader try a Courier font and 80 column page):

                           Timing (crank degrees)
 
 
In this simple example, we would want a distributor advance curve that gives
us the following:
 
rpm               2000      3000      4000       5000      6000
 
advance            10 deg    20       30-34     34-39     35-37
 
If you look at the "ignition hooks" you will see that if you don't run near
the top of each curve, the peak of each hook, you are giving up power. In
other words, there is ONE CORRECT ADVANCE CURVE that will give you maximum
power throughout the rpm range. There are other curves that will allow the
engine to run, work, and avoid detonation in the midrange if the distributor
is installed to give the same total advance as stock, but they will give up
power in the midrange. That means your car will accelerate slower through
the gears.
 
Furthermore, if in your laboratory testing you hit the knock limit before
the curve drops back down, you may want to specify higher octane fuel or
change the mechanical design of the engine. This sort of fine tuning is what
development in the prototype stage is
all about. If I remember correctly, the rule of thumb for laying out non-
adaptive ignition systems was to maintain a 3 degree, or better 5 degree
(crank angle) safety margin from the knock limit. As engines age, they tend to
get progressively lower knock limits, although this is no longer quite as
severe with modern detergent fuels. See farther down, discussion of fuels.
 
So the curve we finally build into the distributor might look like this:

This is a very simple curve. You can design in breaks in the slope of
the curve by using more than one set of springs. Centrifugal advance
systems can not give a downward slope at higher rpms; the curve can only
be flat or slope up.
 
Vacuum advance (or even vac retard) are added to some (more modern than 356)
distributors to give different ignition timing at part load for economy or
emissions reasons. Vacuum devices can be used to give a downward slope.
For reference, see "Bosch Technical Instruction, Battery Ignition Systems,"
VDT-UBE 120/3B, or "Bosch Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems."
 
I hope this clarifies any misconceptions about finding a "better than stock"
advance curve for stock engines. It ain't gonna happen.
 
As for rebuilding original 356 distributors, Stoddard offers this service at
a nominal cost. No more bearing slop, no erratic timing, no sticking springs,
etc.
 
There has been an associated urban legend about modern gasoline not being as
good as the stuff we used to get 35 years ago. Pure uncut Bullshit. This has
been perpetrated by the same people who have something to sell you, like
distributors which have been magically recurved for "today's reformulated
gasolines" or engines built to have lower compression ratio than stock because
they allegedly won't run on what the perpetrator calls "today's panther piss."
As far as detonation is concerned, the only thing the engine cares
about is octane number. It only takes a moment to glance at the factory recom-
mendations for fuel, as stated in the owner's handbooks, to blow this claim out
of the water. 356 C recommended 94 Research Octane No. (about the same as our
present-day "midgrade" at 89 pump octane, which is typically 4-5 points lower
than a fuel's RON.) The SC called for 96 RON, adequately met by our present
unleaded premium. The 356 Carreras called for 96 RON in their last
versions, while earlier Carreras didn't even call for that high a grade.
(Reference: appendix to "Porsche 356: Driving in its purest Form" by Conradt.)
You have to remember that in the 1950s and early 1960s, when these cars were
designed, we didn't have the rocket fuel leaded Sunoco 260 and the like
which was developed for big high-output American engines of the late 1960s. And
Germans didn't have any sort of monopoly on high grade fuel, if anything their
early postwar economy didn't allow or require high grade fuel. That whole trend
started with the big overhead valve American V8 and the resulting horsepower
race. Bottom line, 356s will run fine on modern fuel. If anything, they will
run better, due to the detergent properties of modern fuel and resulting
avoidance of combustion chamber deposits which in the old days could
eventually lead to detonation.
 
It is true that modern gasoline is different. Its heat value is lower. This
means that unless you rejet the carbs or recalibrate older injection systems
accordingly, the engine will run leaner. Modern systems with oxygen sensors
don't care, they set the correct mixture automatically. But it would
be a mistake to misdiagnose detonation caused by a lean mixture as detonation
caused by lower octane fuel, and fix the non-problem by dialing back the total
advance or installing some magic distributor from a different application. Yes,
modern fuel will give ever so slightly less power, because the little bit of
extra fuel you need to get in the chamber will displace a very small amount of
combustion air, but you would never feel this and you would need to measure it
under controlled conditions or on a dyno to tell for sure. Atmospheric effects
would more than cover up this slight power difference. Also some fuel, such
as the gasohol available or mandated in some parts of the country, plays
holy hell with some older fuel systems. But that's not an octane problem and
a different distributor won't keep your fuel lines from rotting or aluminum
parts from corroding. I run oxygenated fuel here in California (added
ethanol? MTBE?) and have no problems.

Subject: 3.0 liter 911 engine mods

OK guys, help me spend some money that I probably don't have!

In pursuit of absolute power, I have conceded to making some minor mods in an
otherwise stock rebuild of a 1977 3.0 liter 911 euro motor (same case, heads,
pistons as a 911SC, but a 2.7 crank).

I am replacing the stock 8.5:1 pistons with 9.3:1s and plan to run the stock
CIS which I believe is the same as other 1977 units (no O2 sensor), only
modified for the added displacement.  Please don't try to talk me into
induction mods, I'm on a budget, the CIS works and I'm gonna keep it!

My question has to do with cam modifications.  This engine uses the same cams
as the SC and Carrera, only with more aggressive timing that sacrifices
torque for horsepower.  Under advice of my most trusted machine shop, I'm cons
idering having the stock cams reground with C2 profiles (cost of $285).  I'm
told that this mod alone should yield a 10-15% power increase.

Can anybody validate the power increase claims from these cam mods? Seems
like a good investment.  The motor is rated 200 HP DIN in stock form and with
SSI heat exchangers, Bursch exhaust, 9.3:1s and the cams, I'd hope for a
minimum 30 HP gain over stock, without any sacrifice in drivability.

Any other low buck improvement suggestions for this project are welcome.

Subject: How to clean 911 engine cases?

I'm in the midst of a full rebuild on my 77' 3.0 liter (euro motor).  The
heads, crank and rods are being shipped back to me from the machine shop and
I need advice on cleaning the grime off the aluminum cases before I start to
bolt the thing together.

The previous owner really neglected the car and the motor had more oil leaks
than an early Triumph Bonneville when I got it (not to mention a broken
compression ring in cylinder #6), so the cases are a mess of baked on oil and
grease. My spare time is precious, so I'm thinking of having them hot tanked.
 I could spend a long time getting into the nooks and crannies with Simple
Green or Gunk and a brush.

What do I have to look out for? I understand that aluminum has to be cleaned
in a special tank.  I plan to reuse the #8 main bearings since they
supposedly don't wear out and look perfect, so I'd remove these before
tanking the case.  Also, the head studs have never cracked and the bottom row
is Dilivar (from the factory), so I plan to leave these in place.  Will the
tanking damage these studs in any way?

Lastly, what can I expect to pay for this service?

Thanking the experts out there in advance for their advice!

I was very interested in Jerry's positive experience with the Omnibag.  Earlier
this spring, it was very damp and humid here.  The cold garage floor caused
moisture to condense on the underside of my Porsche.  It was literally dripping
wet for a week or more.  A loose tire that was standing vertically had about
1/2 inch of water condensed in the bottom of it.  Any steel not painted or well
greased now has surface rust on it.  I wish I had put my car in a sealed bag.
I'll be looking into it for next winter.

I was driving my 87 944S down the road at about 30-35 mph when it suddenly
died.  It didn't make any noise, didn't vibrate, just died quietly.  Since
then, I have checked a number of things including:

1.  Timing Belt, and Balance Shaft Belt.  Both are on and rotating when I
    crank it.
2.  There seems to be pressure @ the fuel rail.  I don't know if it is the
    specified pressure since my meter pegs @ 10 psi (anyone know of a good
    fuel pressure gauge with a range of 29 to 58 psi?  Anyway, there is
    definately fuel there, and the fuel pump is delivering it there.
3.  There is power getting to the injector's solenoids.
4.  I swapped out the relays into a friend's 944S.  His care kept working
    so...
5.  There is a spark on the spark plugs.
6.  The battery voltage is within specs (under load).  

I'm stumped for where else to look.  Any suggestions...before I swallow my

Subject: 944: Question for timing belt DIYourselfers


After installing my new timing belt, setting the tightness to 4.0 with the
gauge, and installing the balance shaft belt, I now realize that it will
practically require removal of the bal. belt just to check the timing belt
again at 3000 km. It doesn't seem right, but it's impossible to use the
gauge with the balance belt in the way. Therefore, I'm curious as to what
the timing belt usually reads at the end of the first 3000 km. Is it
usually pretty close to the prescribed 2.7 +/- 0.3? 

Also, the 944 Spec. booklet (p.41) specifies for the balance belt:
 
for roller without oblong hole: 4.3 +/- 0.3 (new belt)
for roller with oblong hole:    2.7 +/- 0.3 (new belt) 

 - Jim Pasha's Excellence article specifies 2.7 (no mention of oblong hole)
 - Factory manual mentions nothing of 'oblong hole' and specifies 2.7
 - All balance belt tensioners I've seen have a round hole. Therefore 4.3?
 - Maybe they're referring to the bal. idler roller, and therefore 2.7?
 - My instincts tell me to go with 2.7

Can anyone clear up the confusion?

Subject: Re: Original vs.050 Distributors

Dear Peter:
           Once again let me state  again that GOOD Original Distributors
with 30 degrees advance in them that  are NOT sticky or jerky are Good
Distributors. However, despite what you say about the ease  of rebuilding a
bad original, the  success rate is not 100% but some number well below that
figure. Likewise, how many Originals have been touched by the hands of
Turkeys and butchered beyond reasonable repair? Like when the drive mechanism
and locking pin have been "disassembled" with a sledge hammer? 
    Let us take, for example,  Jerry Seinfeld's '58 Speedster that came into
the Maestro's  shop last week. It had what Stan and you would call a Good
Original distributor- 30 degrees advance with little variation of the timing
at constant speed. However, it had a problem all too typical of old
Originals- the "sticky" one wherein, when coming down from high RPM, the
timing would "stick" at 15 degrees advance and take a while  to return to 0.
Meanwhile if you're trying to adjust the carbs you  think what you're doing
with the carbs is affecting the engine  when in fact you're not affecting the
engine- the distributor is! 
     The LA-LA land Porsche Dealer who worked on the car previously had
retarded the timing to three degrees  AFTER  Top Dead Center in an attempt to
overcome this problem. As a result, the  engine idled at near stalling speed,
and any attempt at proper carb adjustment was made difficult since
sensitivity was lost.
     Resetting the timing to proper high speed advance made the carb
adjustment possible (it was way off), and made  the car run much better-
except for the lag in returning to idle.
     A new .050 eliminated the lag in returning to idle, made possible  the
proper carb adjustment and if anything, made  the car run BETTER than  with
the "good" original. 
    The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
    (Oh, and in case you're curious, the engine itself had the main case
halves of a later '58 with the third piece from a mid-1957. Looking up these
components in the Maestro's Data Base of 4000+ engines showed that the Third
Piece is the type that used the  External Oil Booster Line (which was
missing), while the Main Case Halves used the Cast Internal Oil Booster Line
(which didn't  exist in the third piece that was on it!).
    Maybe that's the reason the engine had all of 16 psi at 3000 RPM.
Boy, that Data Base sure has important information!
    And, Peter, despite what you say about how the gas has remained just as
good now as it was years ago- I don't think a lot of people will agree with
you. Yes, the "92" octane gas is the average of RON and MON (Research Octane
Number and Motor Octane Number), and maybe 92 now (RON+MON)/2 is about 96
then, but don't forget there were many gasolines (Sunoco comes to mind), that
had octane ratings over 100!
     These octane ratings allowed one to build engines with significantly
higher compression ratios then (and, correspondingly, more power, higher
Thermal Efficiency and all those goodies), without premature failure from
detonation damage. (And  without MTBE either!)
    These days, I think 9:1 is about  the limit for a street 356/912
(water-cooled engines can be higher since they operate at a much more
constant temperature), and I set most all the street engines to between
8.6-8.9:1. They produce good power, get good gas mileage and go over 100,000
miles. That's not a bad compromise, and part of the reason I like to:
    
KEEP THE 356 FAITH!

I was working on my belts this weekend, and I agree- there 
really isn't much room to get the gauge in there.  Mine
is an `87 with the self-tensioner and some other hardware

As for the balance belt tension- the fiche manual indicates

Yes, removing axle nut is easiest way.  Once you have the pipe (and a
quality wrench that won't break) use a 1 inch extender and do it with the
wheel still on, but chocked, for safety.  If you choose not to remove the
axle nut, then you have the problem of getting at the outer CV bolts
through the arm, then there's no way to separate from splined end,
then trying to get the silly thing back on later.  Once the axle nut is
off, the whole thing slides right out.  Do yourself a favor and also
remove the starter, it gets in the way.

I can't see anyone needing a slide hammer.  Remove the nut, undo the
inner CV bolts and separate from trans flange (carefully if you don't
have new gaskets), and then it comes right out.

Sounds like the ring and pinion.  A friend had the same problem in a "88"
944.  A couple of teeth broke off of the pinion gear and were laying at
the bottom of the transaxle housing.  Here's something you can do to diagnose
it:

Jack the rear of the car up and put in neutral:

	-Turn one rear wheel and the other should turn in the opposite directi
	and make no noise.  This is because only the spider gears in the
	 diff are turning at this point which is what the diff is
	 supposed to do.

	-Get some help and turn both wheels at once.  This will turn the ring
	gear and pinion and you should hear the clunking.

	-If you don't hear anything at this point I don't know what is wrong.

I once had a similar problem on a Honda.  It was getting spark and fuel but
not starting.  The problem turned out that the spark was intermittent and 
weak.  Look at the spark closely to see if it is firing everytime it is 
supposed to and a nice blue spark.  If not, check the obvious in the 
ignition system:    
 
	-Coil resistence
	-Plug wires
	-Etc.

The computer could also be the culprit so try swapping computers.

Good luck!

Subject: 944 Timing Belt Self-Tensioner - HELP!


From discussions here on P-files, MY87 and later 944's should
have a spring loaded self-tensioner that should allow
correct tensioning without the P9201 tool($$$).

The microfiche manuals make no mention of the self tensioner
and procedures specific to it.  The consensus on P-files
seemed to be: 1. loosen the lock-nut on the tensioner, the
tensioner will "self-adujst", and then, 2. tighten the lock-nut.

My car does seem to have the self tensioner- there is a 
metal plate that covers a portion of the tensioner sprocket
where the eccentric shaft would be on the older cars.  The lock-nut is 
on top (in front?) of the plate which is held down by two bolts on the 
right side (looking at the engine from the front).

Here's the problem:  When I went to loosen the lock-nut it was
very difficult to turn.  After adding more leverage (with a 
1/2 drive socket wrench) the nut would turn, but it never 
seemed to loosen up, like the other lock-nuts do.  After closer 
inspection, and putting a dot of paint on the end of the bolt, 
I determined that the bolt is turning as well(!).  It seems
the nut is siezed on the bolt, and that whatever is holding the
bolt from behind is slipping.

And the belt is even looser now.

Here are my questions:

1.  Is this a BIG problem?  Is the head of the bolt
    supposed to be imbedded in the engine block somehow, and
    it sheared?  Or is the bolt simply holding the
    tensioner sprocket against the metal plate?  If that's
    the case then it's just a matter of loosening the 
    nut from the bolt.

2.  Should I attempt to remove the self-tensioner assembly
    and loosen everything up on the work bench?  Or will the
    tensioning spring pop out and be impossible to get back
    in correctly?

3.  What is the exact procedure for adjusting tension
    with the self-tensioner?  After the lock-nut is loosened
    should you turn the crank once or twice and back off as 
    for making measurements for the manual tensioner?  Or
    do you just loosen and re-tighten the lock-nut?
    Does anyone have a copy of a factory bulletin on the
    self-tensioner?

4.  Am I doomed to go to a mechanic/dealer?  Argghhh....


Thanks for any advice....

Subject: 911 alignment

Well folks, despite my skepticism, I went and got Ray Scruggs' book on home
alignment. Amazing! It works. My twitchy, foul-handling beast (untouched for
25 years!) now handles wonderfully (quiet too). I have a few questions: 1) I
changed the camber on the car to negative one degree. Scruggs recommended .5
degrees. I can't adjust it any more. I've got the ride height set at 25.5
inches to the top of the wheel wells and the top of the strut all the way
over to the outside of the car. There just doesn't seem to be any adjustment
left to get to .5 degrees. Any ideas? 2) Any ideas on how to four-corner
balance the car? Scruggs outlined a procedure involving driving around and
tinkering with torsion bar adjustments without using a weight scale. Anybody
found any other cheap do-it-yourself ways of weight balancing the car?
Thanks. Ashley.

Subject: 911: "Panting" Engine noise

Another question for you motorheads:

The problem:
My '86 Carrera is idling weird, it sounds like this: rrrump rrump rrump.
The tach indicates the engine speed is dropping to say 800 RPM then
it "catches" itself and gives it some throttle and idle goes up to a little
over
1000 RPM. Once in a while it will idle fine.

The clues:
It started dong this after I put the engine back in the car. In the process
of removing the engine I disconnected a bazillion lines and cables and
while the engine was out I:
 - Replaced clutch, resurfaced flywheel.  I mention this because there
  are sensors in this area.
 - Replaced the head temperature sensor and oil pressure switch.
 - Adjusted valves.
 - To replaced the left cam tensioner oil line I removed the distributor to
  gain access (in case that make a difference).
 - I cleaned the contacts on the rotor  and distributor cap.

This was my 2nd mechanical project _ever_; the 1st was just replacing
some brake pads on my GTI. Don't be afraid to mention stuff that
should be obvious - it probably isn't obvious to me. :-)

While I found the philological debate (over the pronunciation of "Porsche")
of interest only in that it reinforces the notion that truth is in the mind

exactly what Porsche "means".  For example, it is widely acknowledged that
Corvette means "10 foot penis" (apologies to the '63 Stingray),  Trans am is

The manual for my '87 944 Turbo says:

- -----------------------------
Clean the roof prior to removal to avoid scratches and soiling your clothes.

1. Turn the ignition switch to position 1 (see ingition/starter switch section).
[i.e. one click to the right of off--Lou]
 Depress rear half of rocker switch until the prop-up linkage mechanism
unlocks the roof [i.e. the "forks" retract down into the fixed roof--Lou].

2. Loosen front holding clamps.

3. Lift up and remove roof.

4. Store roof in the pouch provided in luggage compartment.
- ------------------------------

Seriously, these are somewhat "particular" cars about how they are treated,
and how they work. If you don't have the factory manual (I assume you
don't) the I strongly recommend that you order one from the dealer and read
it cover to cover. Since you subscribe to this list, I infer that you are
an enthusiast, and want to maintain your pride and joy properly. The manual
is an essential part this.

The manual will explain the procedure for re-installing the roof  ;-)

Best of luck,

John Wright's excellent post on the construction of the
fuel gauge sender mechanism reminds me of the problem I
have, and haven't gotten around to fixing yet.

The float in my sender (and others have told me they
have the same problem) gets stuck every now and then.
Examination of the resistance wire reveals little nicks
or kinks at certain spots, apparently due to having had
the float sit at those spots for extended periods, perhaps
during storage.  It's almost impossible to smooth the
wire enough to allow the float to ride freely without
hanging up.  One needs to replace the wire, which brings
me to the point...

Does anyone know where to get resistance wire?  The stuff
in the sender is about 36 ohms/foot, and you only need
two feet.

Asfar,

The problem, I am 99% sure, lies in the Constant Velocity (CV) joints
in one of your half-shafts (drive axles).

The cost ro repair can be about $250 per side if you replace both CV 
joints. Each axle has two. 

There most like is no damage to the transaxle. If it hasn't been done, 
has the gear oil in the trans axle replaced at the same time the CV
joints are repaired. If only one side is bad, have the other side 
removed and lubricated.

Well I am hoping for the worst but that's because I don't have
a CLUE. I would like to hear the diagnostic from the list 944
Experts specially ( but not the least) from those members on 
the Cc list. 

Yesterday, I took my 85/2 944 with 51,000 mile, for a cruise.
Soon after exiting the highway (about 1/2 mile ), while
making a right turn, a loud clunking noise started to come from
the rear axle. I pulled the car to a side street and couldn't
find any thing visible wrong with the transaxle. The clunk
appears to sync with each revolution of the wheel. However, the
clunking noise seems to disappear in the reverse. 

So, I drove the car at a snail speed ( < 2 mph ) to the nearest
phone (1/4 of a mile).  After having it towed to my house following
are the existing symptoms.

1. Loud cluttering/clunking noise in the forward direction.
   ( in gear ). Seems to be comming from inside the transaxle.

2. Slight noise in the reverse. It was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth.

3. Slight noise in neutral. It also, was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth.

4. When rolling the car in the forward direction there is a point
   where the wheels appeared lock and would not turn. However, a 
   slight push in the reverse direction will unlock the wheels to 
   move forward, for a couple of wheel revolutions.

5. The gears seems to shift normally. A little hard shifting into
   reverse ( again, All together now; "It was not there before I
   drove looking for a phone booth" ).

6. After raising the car and turning the wheel, the noise seems to
   be coming from the transaxle.

The CV joint boots does not show any grease leakage and appears
normal. Since there is some noise when the car is in neutral
so can I assume that it is not the linkage? 
Rear wheel bearing? I thought that it was a problem in the early
944's.

Beside this I don't have any clue as to what is wrong. All I can
tell you is that I replaced the transaxle oil last year with
Redline MTL(80-90??).

Jim Pasha and Kevin Gross I would greatly appreciate your opinion
and comments. Jim , sometime ago, I remember reading your transaxle
article in Excellence. Would you happen to know, what month
was that issue for?

Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

I know every failure mode is different, but you could try this.

Ensure that the plugs are dry, and the engine isn't flooded (turn
it over a bit wth the plugs out and the fuel injectors disconnected.
(standard warnings about diconnecting the coil included :-) ).

Then try to start the car normally for a few seconds. Disconnect the
injectors ( power leads),and try again. If the engine fires at all then
you are getting too rich a mixture, by a long way. 

In fact you should get a good idea about fuel delivery by the state of
the plugs ..

The reason I suggect this is that this is my 944's failure mode (albeit
intermittent). If these are your symptoms, and you find a fix, let me know,
as mine has a habit of coming back to life as soon as I get serious with
the diagnostics.

Good luck,

Chris.

Thanks George. I'll take a harder look. The problem is that:

 - the bal. belt is in the way
 - I cannot insert the P9201 paddle at certain places along the belt without
  binding btween the belt and belt cover and seriously affecting the reading.
  Therefore, I'm quite limited as to where on the belt I can use the gauge.
  Maybe the belt covers allowed for different clearance on different years?

As for the tech bulletin on removing the vent hose connecting the belt cover
to the air box, I can see some pros/cons leaving it in:

pros: sucks up loose belt material, cools down belt area
cons: sucks in sand and grit into the belt assembly accelerating wear on 
      belts and rollers.

I haven't decided either way yet, but I'm curious as to Porsche's reasons
for removing it. I suspect many 944s still have the hose connected.

James,

I needed a blower moter also for my 79 911SC and was shocked at the price
for both new and rebuilt, so I thought I'd try and fix mine.  It turned out
to be a very simple problem of the small braided wire that is soldered to 
the brushes breaking at the solder joint.  You probably have already opened
it up, but if not, take a look there.  It was the cheapest and simplest thing
I've ever fixed on my car.

1 quart/ 1000 miles 
 
This is what I get for my chipped 89k miles '86 944 Turbo car in normal
street use, and that is the same as what other drivers that I have spoken
to get. It was more like 1 quart/1500-2000 miles before the chip. If you
drive harder, faster, and stay on the boost longer, expect gas and oil
consumption to increase in multiples, not fractions. 
 
The car occasionally blows a puff of smoke at startup. It emits enough
pollution to discolor the back of the car and the parking spot after a
time. Of course it has a cat pipe. Again, all typical stuff. I have been
told that Porsches are built looser, for racing durability. Probably
another myth. It certainly consumes more oil than my old RX-7's, which
actually are designed to consume oil like a 2-stroke. 
 
I use Mobil 1. Seem to remember that consumption was less on dino-juice.
Sometimes even the brand can make a big difference. 
 
The wisdom is to use an extra .5-1 quart in the engine to cover that
fragile #2 rod bearing, if you run the car hard. Also, keep the coolant
tank at Max when cold.

Subject: Re: 930 vs 911SC?


- --Boundary-8041464-0-0

Jonathan:  Interesting timing on your query.  I've owned both 911SC's(2) and a 
78 930.  I'm looking for another 911 and am considering an 86 930 or an 83 
911Cab.  I will probably get the 911 over the 930 and I've had to keep 
reminding myself why I sold the 930 in the first place.  The 930 is a 
fantastic car but doesn't make a lot of sense for me as a regular driver.  
Here's why: 
 
The 930's are four speeds.  This is a great tranny, very durable, smooth 
shifting etc.  The problem is that the car is very hard to drive within the 
speed limits on a highway.  By speed limits I don't mean 55, rather 62-65 
where you're up with the flow of traffic.  The 930 is bareley breathing in 4th 
gear at 60-62mph.  They are so quiet and smooth that unless you're staring at 
the speedo you notice little difference between 62 and 82mph.  It's very easy 
to unintentionally creep up to ticket levels. Got several tickets like this. 
Also noticed that my right foot was heavier in the 930 than in the 911  90mph 
in second gear impressed almost any passenger. 
 
 Also, the police here in California are very aggressive about ticketing these 
cars.  They are easy to spot and the cops seem to view them as major quarry.  
Next is the cost of maintenance. I would spend 2x the amount on 930 
maintenance as 911.  In todays market, a 930 is probably going to cost you 2x 
the amount to buy as a comparable 911.  Insurance will also double on the 930. 
 
The 930 is a very civilized car to drive until you get into the boost.  This 
factor makes race tracks and winding roads real interesting.  The 911 then is 
the car of choice for me.  If you do have an itch to scratch on the 930 side, 
however, scratch it.  You can always sell it and get a 911. Thinking about 
getting another 930 makes my eyes glaze over and induces a trance like state 
for very short periods.  Then I come back to  reality.   Most of my friends 
who bought them came to the same conclusions.    
 
Good luck,  
Ted Smith

I presently have a 1987 951 that I use frquently and on the track for
Drivers Ed. I am in interested in either a '77 or '78 930 or an 83 or 84 911
SC, to replace the 951.

Does anyone have any comments on the relative merits of these cars, I don't
do my own servicing, and servicing costs would be an important factor. 

Which one is nicer to drive? What would the differences be? Which one is
faster on the track? Which one is more fun on the track? Which would you
take on a 1,000 mile trip?

I am hoping to hear from someone who has owned both.....

FWIW When my rotor arm broke up (not uncommon 944 experience), I found
the remains of the rotor arm, and the plastic 'dust shield' in the
air cleaner box. Now perhaps if there were not reduced pressure in the
cam enclosure they would have stayed in the distributor cap, perhaps
not, but I'm sure glad all those bits weren't flying around the belt
enclosure for too long ..

Subject: 930 vs. 911

One thing to consider:
If you're buying a '77 930, the parts are different from the later models 
because of the engine differences. The '77 930 Turbo Carrera has a 
turbocharged engine based on the European Carrera engine- correct me if 
I'm wrong. I've been told parts costs for a '77 are much higher than the 
newer models.

The '77 930 isn't intercooled either, right?

But, if you can afford it, the Turbo is a blast, and IMHO it looks nicer 
than the standard Carrera or SC.
Then again, if you're into looks, you could always get a turbo-look.

Depends on the application. You got the "special sized" cylinders already?
What do you mean "special size"?

There's Arias and Venolia for the *REAL* "special" pistons, then you can
get Mahle, TRW, and Cosworth in applications that *fit*, but you may
have to do other things like use different rods, or even have some rods
made up special. Or you can have special cranks made that let you
use off the shelf "unusual" rods -- like some Chevy parts -- with those
"other applications" pistons.

So I guess it gets down to this: what the hell are you trying to DO?

I've got the same problem, but at a very low ride height (24") I can get
no less than 1.8 degrees. I want 1 deg ft and 1.5 rear. I'm going to try to
jack up the front, remove the three strut adjusting bolts, and lower
the strut mount away from the body. Then I'm going to try to remove the
hard black gook that was smeared on the adjusting plate 23 years ago.
This might give us some extra adjustment. And with no weight on the strut,
it should be easier to move. Anyone every try this?

I really don't think this is possible without some sort of scales.
I had my car really screwed up last year (80 pounds off on each corner)
because I tried it without scales. I've got a set of scales in Danbury, CT
that I'm borrowing. If you want to come up we can see how far off you are.
If you can get it close enough with only the front adjustments, it is easy.
But if the rears need re-indexing you're out of luck as I've been fiddling
with rear adjustments about 20 times in the last year and am sick of it!
Wish my adjustable spring plates were legal in SCCA stock...

Subject: '88 911 Carrera - starting problems

Hello Porschephiles,

I'm in need of some help in diagnosing a starting problem I am having w/my '88 Carrera.

Sometimes (it has happened twice), the car won't start when cold. The motor
cranks but it won't start, the behavior is similar to that of a cis f.i. system
with a bad control pressure regulator; it seemed like if there was no gas in the
tank or like if the fuel pump was not working.

This never happened before; the first time it happened was on Saturday pm.
When I tried to start the engine, it won't start. it would crank but it won't start.
I ran the starter five or six times, for about 4 seconds each try and about 30-45
seconds between each attempt, and... nothing. I could not believe this, the thing
was just fine the night before. So of course I could not resist trying again.
About 20-30 minutes later, I tried the same sequece, and ... the engine just
started! I let the engine idle for about 5 minutes, stopped the engine, and 
re-started it, it started immediately. Good. 

On Sunday morning, the same thing just happened again; the engine won't start.
Followed the same sequence, and it started. What is going on?

This morning the car started just fine. 

Do you people have any ideas about how to diagnose/resolve this problem?

TIA,

Javier.

Response to my earlier posting has been underwhelming.

I'll take them to the dump later this week if I get no interest, but that
would be a shame.  These are VERY GOOD TRACK TIRES.

+++++++ Previous posting +++++++++++++++

I just removed 4 Yoko A008P 225/50 ZR 16 from my 944S2. I loved them dearly
for both road & track, but after 20K miles there is too little tread left
for the street, I [feel|fear]. I replaced them (it's only a street car now)
with A-509.

I think they're still quite good for the track and have lots of track mileage
left on them.

Any takers? I'm not looking for much $$, only a reasonable amount. (btw, UPS
ships tires for little cost. I can arrange for the shipping to you, but you
pay the freight.)

Try MWS Wire Industries (MWS = Magnet Wire Specialties, their old name I

Most likely it is ball joints.  Get someone over to move the 
tire while you check the ball joint since these aren't cheap 
for newer 944s.  You get to change the whole control arm, not
just the ball joint.  There are a couple of companies around that

on how budget-minded you are.

        Depends on what was used to bring it up to 115 octane.  If
it's leaded avgas (do they make that anymore?) then it would be bad
for your catalytic converter.  I'm not sure if other additives will
have bad effects on the FI/emissions equipment.
        That said:  Higher octane *NEVER* hurts.  Unless your car
has a knock sensor or is already pinging, it will not help.  However,
some cars with knock sensors will keep advancing the ignition timing
until the sensor kicks in.  Higher octane can help those cars make
more power.  Someone said on the list a while back that a ride in a
Euro-spec 3.2 with 100-octane gas was a religious experience.  The
US-spec version may not have a high enough compression ratio to make
a big difference, though.

Do not hot tank it. Hot tanking is for cast iron blocks. I've never

but I have rebuilt several VWs. VW machine shops have tanks filled with carb

I forget what I had to pay. It was reasonable enough, though. (Well, these days

Jim,

For an 86 911 Carrera, anything above 87 (or maybe 89) octane is a waste of
money. In 1987, the DME program was changed to assume premium unleaded fuel.
Unless an engine requires high-octane fuel to avoid pre-detonation, there is
no benefit to running high-octane fuel. Check out the gas FAQ on the WWW

Two things: 

1) tax issues - you're not supposed to use plane gas in cars, if you
   get caught, it's Bad News for both you and whoever sold it to you.

2) octane is *NOT* octane; the Reid vapor pressure of AvGas is *WAY*
   different from that of Car Gas.  You can, by all means, use racing
   gas. I use Phillips, Sunoco, and Cam2 in octane from 101 to 125,
   mostly in unleaded. Certainly, you can get this stuff in leaded too...

    I would say that if you have no problems with detonation then stick
with whatever you're using.  Going to a higher octane will only cost you
power (very little, but hey...) because of the slower burning
characteristics.  If you do need more octane, I would still be wary of
using avgas because it may contain lead because that is the cheapest way
to boost octane.  This will f**k up your catalytic converter in a big
way.  I don't know if no-lead avgas is available or not, not having
enough money to futz around with airplanes... but be sure to check.  I
personally would try an octane booster that is labeled as not containing
lead, along with whatever gas you're using now.

later,

Subject: 930 vs 911sc

Jonathan Ross inquires on the merits of 930's vs a 911sc as it seems he
is wanting to replace his ('87) 951.  he mentions looking for a "'77 or 
'78 930"
and wonders which is better (specifically: maintenance, road trips and
speed on track).

Summary:

1) avoid pre '78 930's if you will ever want to go fast or stop fast 
(consistently).
2) bad news: you will hate the four speed.  good news: it can be fixed.
3) 911's are loud road-trip machines.  either you can take it or you can't.
4) maintenance will be merely *ok* if you avoid turning up the boost
   and don't make "improvements".   But if you wanted a safe life you'd
   probably stay in bed (alone).

i've never owned a normally aspirated 911 (i do routinely drive with
(err "against"?) 'em at the track though) so i'll leave experience based
comparisons to others but on the subject of '77 vs '78 930's i think 
you'll find
the following:

pre '78 930's did not have an intercooler.  nor did they have the 
big-time suspension
and brakes that most people associate with 930's.  These cars are not 
concidered
(as) desirable for track use.  Having an intercooler is a very good 
thing for engine
life expectancy and wallet thickness (although, thick wallets and 
owning 930's don't
usually go hand-in-hand :)).  You will want those bigger brakes when 
you enter your
first corner :)  That having been said, i *have* seen pre '78's at the track in
Portland so i know it happens.

my recommendation would be for any track-aware type to get a '78 or later 930.
'78 and '79 are good choices for track types due to their availability and low
emissions requirements (ie: you can modify the hell out of 'em and get away
with it (easier)).  My track'd car is a beautiful '78 Gold-Metalic example that
goes like stink.  but then, i've done a few of those "improvements" to it...

you're primary impression of a pre '89 930 will be frustration with the 
4-speed.
they suck.  they are Evil Incarnate.  the short answer is that you will want to
change the ring-&-pinion or get a five speed.

on the track you will find that the normally aspirated 911's have that annoying
low-end torque stuff (never experienced it myself but i've heard about 
it :):) that
provides certain advantages at the apex and exit of corners (ahem).  Throttle
stearing is more difficult with a 930 due to the added complexities of the
God's Annointed Torque Curve Syndrome (ie: turbo-lag).

You will also find out how irritating those damned 944 turbos are.  too damned
quick...  too easy to drive (neutral in corners, etc.).  can't imagine 
where the
challenge is in that ;):)  However, i note that you have seen the light and are
*upgrading* (now, where is that nomex anti-flame suit) to a challenging car
<big grin>.

Daryl's secret to 930 driving on the track is to DRIVE THE CAR EVERY DAY.
only by logging lots of hours behind the wheel of 930 can you become one with
the torque curve.  else you'll just get into trouble on the track.

Urban legend has it that boost "comes on unexpectedly" in a 930.  this 
is hogwash.
if you get caught with your panties down when the boost comes on then 
you just havn't
driven your car enough.  Boost comes on when it can (ie: when you'v got 
your foot
into it and the rpm's are up, etc.)  not by magic (ask me about the time my
rear-distributor jump forward a tooth though)...

930's are typically heavier and have more weight bias toward the rear.  
expect a
930 to be harder to drive then a normally aspirated 911.  If you're coming from
a 944, though, you's gots a different experiece ahead 'o you anyway :):)

i think road tripping any 911 is gonna be the same.  Either you can take
the noise or you can't.  additional irritations come from lowering the car
and running bigger tires (bump steer and "seeking") which you're gonna
do if you love your 930 and drive it at the track.  Again, the four-speed
is not pleasant for long drives although its better then 'round the city kinda
driving.

i spent a month on the road in my 930 in late '92.  5500 miles.   took it down
to phoenix to have a g50 installed but got lost in the southwest :):).  Yes i
have an awsome sterio in the car (sorry Stan).   Yes it helped.  Yes
there were times when all i wanted to do was listen to the engine...
but there were times when my ears hurt so much i wanted to leave
the car on the side of the road and hitchhike home :):)

Maintenance will be merely *ok* on a 930 if you don't turn the boost

    I personally want a boxter more than any other new car on the
market.  You are absolutely right, it is a logical continuation of the
ideas brought out in the 914, with a good bit of the style of a 356. 
I'm tempted to shove one in the face of one of those types that buys a
slant-nose 930 with all the fancy gadgets (not that I'd turn my nose up
at one, mind you) and say "THIS is a REAL Porsche!"

Yes! This is, however, true of any of the Porsches. You'll do a lot better

True, true, all true.... The boost comes on a a specific point (varies with
engine and the rest of your modifications) that's fairly consistent. If
it "surprises" you, you're just not paying attention or you don't have 
enough seat time. Plus, as noted above, your REAL objective is to never
ever get off the boost. That way you don't have to worry about this stuff.
You do however learn little tricks like left foot braking so you can keep

I don't know about 15x7s, since I'd just buy those. I do know about
15x8s, since you have to have them made.

For 15x8", 5.5" backspacing, 4x130mm pattern, and 66mm center hole -- but 
that's the size for the early front rotors.  The later ones are 78mm, 
I think, but you'd be better of measuring that. These wheels center on
the hub (rotor, actually) by use of the hole so it's important to
get that right.

BTW -- Panosport and ATS already make 15x7s for the 914 that work
great.

cars when someone can make money on their testing & repair? So I have an
extremely hard time believing the statement in your post above. Once
not-exempt, never exempt seems to be the current thinking.  Also, "exempt"

very different interpretations in the real world of older cars.

I measured the distance between the flat side of the belt and the rear 
belt cover. At the top near the cam sprocket cover, 4 mm. Further on down
just before the belt cover makes a slight curve, 6 mm.

The paddles on the gauge are 10 mm. If I force the paddle into the gap, 
it deflects the belt down and makes the gauge read higher.

The only available space (where the gap is big enough) is further down the 
belt with the idler roller removed and the balance belt out of the way.

More on the oil.... The dash gauge measures level in the tank, the higher the
revs the more oil goes to the engine and the level shows low. Back to idle
for a minute then the gauge is correct again.  From "full" to "empty" on the
gauge is only 1-1.5 liters, so small changes appear  radical. If you have no

Subject: 911 Vs. 951

Jonathan Ross asked (paraphrased):  Does anyone have comments on the
relative merits of these cars?

I've owned an '89 944 Turbo S, sold after it broke the second ball joint
and currently own an '88 Carrera coupe.  I'm a reasonably serious track
junkie and instruct for PCA and other groups.

My 944 Turbo was catastrophically unreliable, so my perspective may be a
little distorted, but I have the strong sense that a well-cared-for 911 SC
or later will be far more reliable than an equivalent 951.  Routine
maintenance will be somewhat more expensive on 911s, primarily due to the
fact you replace 11 quarts of oil at each change.  You also will need a
valve adjustment every 15K miles.  On the other hand, you won't need timing
belt adjustments or routine replacements, so the net cost may actually be less.

Nicer to drive?  The 944 is hands down the better cruiser.  911 HVAC and
ergonomics are stone-age, they are noisier and harsher riding.  The 911,
however, is much better endowed with that elusive quality called
"character".  There are few things in this world more pleasurable than
taking a Porsche flat six to the redline, even with the stock exhaust.

Faster on the track?  Depends on the track.  At Mosport, I'd pick a 951
with no hesitation.  At twisty tracks (such as Mid-Ohio) it's a wash.
Stock 951s (are there any left?) are about as fast in a straight line as a
Carrera, somewhat faster than an SC.  More fun on the track?  The 911 is
MUCH more demanding to drive fast on a road course than the 951, but (I
think) more satisfying when you get it figured out.  Proper chassis setup
is MUCH more important on the 911 because of its inherent design problem
(rear engine).  I now have several thousand buck worth of chassis stuff
done to my 911 and it's a nice car to drive fast, though still not as
benign as my Turbo S was.

See you at Mosport 6/10??

Subject: Aviation gas in Carrera

Jim Bauman asks if it's OK to put Avgas in a Carrera.

Yes, depending. Higher octane will do absolutely no harm to the engine. It
may not do any good except to the gas station's account either, but it will
NOT damage pistons, valves, etc. 

It COULD damage a catalytic converter if car is fitted with same and the
Avgas contains lead, but I think leaded Avgas is a thing of the past just
like leaded mogas.

Higher octane provides added protection against knock, if you have some
reason to think that is a problem. Also some cars (such as some Euro spec
cars) which have adaptive engine management systems will dial back spark or
boost (if turbo) to compensate for poor gas. If your 86 Carrera is supposed
to run fine on 92 octane, anything above that is probably wasted money.

Higher octane fuel does NOT contain more energy, or burn any differently.

(Later) Dave Darling summed it up about the same.

Only one thing, the Euro 86 Carrera called for 98 Research Octane, about
93-94 pump octane. If you read my previous explanation of how carmakers
select ignition timing, then you'll see that a system does not necessarily
have to be advanced to the knock limit to get optimum power. I don't know if
that's the logic employed by the factory Motronic (advance it til it knocks,
then dial it back a bit) but if max power (regardless of octane rating of the
fuel) is achieved at some specific timing, it could be that that timing is
the one the Motronic prefers to use, and using even higher octane fuel won't
help (it will want to run at that optimum timing unless it detects knock). It
would not make sense to design an engine that is knock limited and then
relies on a knock sensor to prevent disaster, because if the sensor fails or
such, the manufacturer is looking at a warranty claim.

Subject: Avgas: a pilot's view


Thanks for all your replies on the avgas. Here's
a response from a pilot friend who was following this
with me...

======
The Avgas that was suggested, 100-130 octane (usually abbreviated
115) contains plenty of lead and is a pre-EPA fuel.  It has been
replaced for most high-performance aircraft engines with 100LL
(low lead).  100LL was mandated by the EPA way back to make aviation
conform to requirements for a specific lead content fuel that would
theoretically serve the needs of all aviation internal combustion 
engines. It replaced 80-octane and 100-130 octane aviation fuels
even though 80 octane actually has less lead in it.
 
The experiment did not work, as 80-octane engines could not handle the
additional lead content of 100 LL, and 115 octane engines -- well
shucks ya gotta have octane!  North American Mustangs with V-1650
Packard-built Rolls Royce engines run fine on 100LL, but lowly T-craft
F-19s with 200 CID engines producing 100 HP have to have TCP added
to the mixture to prevent valve fouling.  
 
The result is that 115 octane fuel would undoubtedly cause damage to 
the catalytic converter on your car, due to the high lead content,
but it certainly will not damage your engine.
 
80-octane fuel is available in the western US but is scarce in the
the US east of the Rockie Mountains. 100LL is available everywhere,
and I have never seen 115 east of the Rockies (then again, I don't
fly anything that uses it).  I believe it is used for airplane racing
as they need the additional knock resistance when running at 
a manifold pressure of 115 inches... ;-)

I guess I'll try the real racing gas just for fun....

Near as I can tell, Speedsters fall into two categories at this point:

1) need everything, including lots of rust repair

2) restored, if that word may be used, at some point in the past and
   range from need everthing to be RIGHT on up to 100 point
   concours cars.

There are no cars that fit into the "original, needs restoration, no rust"
category. When you start stripping paint and undercoating and removing
the interior bits, it's there. It's *ALWAYS* there.

Sure doesn't sound like a CV joint... more likely a ring and pinion 
getting ready to lock bigtime.

Best way to check is:

1) drain the transaxle fluid. Look for signs of metal in the fluid.

2) drop the passenger side halfshaft.

3) remove the passenger side flange (on the trans).

4) remove the passenger side cover.

You can now look inside at the ring and pinion.  If it is broken, your
options are few:

1) rebuild the trans.

2) buy a used or rebuilt trans.

Sorry, there are no cheap options...

Good luck

Not a problem. You just have to find the spot where you can slip the gauge
in. about halfway between the cam pulley and the crank pulley.
You must not be trying hard enough. I do it all the time...

I have used 2.7 on my 83 for several years. And yes, they are referring to

Hi, Marc,

If you look at the wiring diagram for the power windows, you will discover
that there is very little except 3 switches and two motors.

I would look for a wire that has had the insulation stripped off or chaged
by a chunk of body (read: ground)...

Disconnect all the switches and ring out the circuits with an ohmmeter. Look
for a dead short..... .You can also check the motors for dead shorts, but
probably won't find that to be the case...

good luck

Make sure that you are placing the flat paddles on the outside (flat part)
of the timing belt and the round roller on the inside of the belt. I have
never found this to be difficult or to affect the reading...

Also, make sure that you set the engine to TDC on #1 and then back up one
and a half teeth to take the tension off the upper part of the belt...

After looking at several different years, there is no difference in the
clearance of the covers...

good luck,

My cousin wants to buy a 944.
I want a newer 944.

I would not normally sell a car to a relative but with some 
unbiased help maybe we can figure out what it's worth.

85 955/2
124k miles.
clutch at 110k, water pump, seals, and right ball joint within last
14k miles (belts too) also has new shocks.
black/black, factory alarm, leather.

some cracks in dash.
time for tires
nice fuchs
plastic for stone guards and door ding trim needs replacing.
Body is in better shape than most. with this many miles.

If I kept it I would expect in the next 10k miles
tires, brake pads, repack wheel bearings, and tie rod ends.

Only other work required is new electric clutch for airconditioning 
compressor and probably a dryer as it's been a while since I used it. 
AC comp has new bearing.
Also, rear window needs resealing.

I've owned since 1988 and 53k miles.

As for newer car, anybody got a 89 S2?
Any color but red or white.

Subject: 911 Rookie

Dear Porsche Experts:
I've just begun to look for a 911 Targa recently. I'd like to have one to
tool around Penna. this summer.  Been lurking around the list for awhile.
Figured I might learn a little without appearing like too much of a schmo by
posting a naive message. Well, I learned a little. But I guess there's just
no getting around looking like a schmo when your a rookie. So here goes.
Here's what maybe I learned:
1. New owner's should probably stay away from turbos for a variety of
reasons. They are great once you have some experience driving and maintaining
but giving one to a newbie is like giving a baby dynamite.
2. Pre 79 911's with the 2.7 liter engine probably should be avoided if
possible.
3. 3/4 of all Porsche's are in California and all of them (no matter the
geography) need a lot of attention.
4. All Targa tops leak
5. There is no real "correct" way to pronounce the name, but Porsha is
probably the best choice(this discussion sure went on longer than
anticipated) 
Anyway, here's my questions:
1. As a general rule are the '79 to '83 sc's the best cars for durability or
is a better rule "the newer the better". I'm refering to both durability and
drivability here.
2. Is the swap meet coming up in the Carlisle, Pa. area a good place to see
cars or potentially make a deal to buy one? I noticed it's refered to as a
"Swap Meet" so maybe it's mostly parts and whatnot. Much as I'd like to have
a car, I don't think I'm ready to build one from parts.
Thanks for your patience

He also has a pamphlet on home alignment of the 914. 944 and C2, C4 is
coming soon!
I heartily recommend his pamphlet. All the adjustment on the front
(toe,caster, camber, hieght) can be done by any fool (hey I did it, although
my wife was embarassed to see the lines of string around my car in the
driveway). One sugestion: instead of measuring the distance between strings
to make sure they are parallel, just get two long pieces of wood or rod and
mark the distance on them and tie string to the mark. A lot easier and you
don't have to get another person to help you measure. Rear adjustment gets a
little trickier, but is doable. The only area that seems weak is the corner
balancing part.

The swap meet at Ski Roundtop in pennsylvania has a lot for Porsche Parking

Subject: Kicks on Route 66


  Hey P-filers,

  This past (long) weekend I spent back where I got my P-car, in
  Oklahoma City. Circumstances forced me to drive in something
  other than my 911T, but it was an enjoyable drive, nonetheless.
  I thought I might share a few observations that might be helpful/
  interesting/of no value whatsoever to folks travelling to Parade
  by this route this summer, or just on I-40 ("todays route 66")
   in general.

  1. First of all, the road itself was in pretty good shape, and had
  very few work zones. Gendarmes did not seem to be excessively
  zealous, but the Texas panhandle and all Arizona bear (no pun
  intended) due care in forays above 70 MPH.

  2. If you need a  P-car shop in Oklahoma City, call Bob Dumont's. They
  have
  moved from their I-40 downtown location, but I believe it is still close
  to where it used to be. First rate independent shop.

  3. The Owl Cafe in Albuquerque (Owlbuquerque ??!) at Eubank and I-40
  serves up great green-chile cheeseburgers and has a huevos
  rancheros that is will knock your socks off. A mandatory stop for me.

  4. Lots of great sights along the way. Everything from the Grand Canyon
  to the Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo. Plus the traffic on the highway has
  its own
  interesting sights. ( Yesterday, all the Indycar tractor-trailers were
  heading east
  after Long Beach.  Bitchin' rigs...) Plan some extra time to take in what
  you
  can (be like the Porsche engineers in the ad and get some "really neat
  stuff",
  like stuffed armadillos or jackalopes...)

  These are just a couple of things that came to mind. If you have any
  further questions about this route, go ahead and ask as I am reasonably
  well travelled on this stretch of highway.

In a recent letter to the list at large, OneGRed930@aol.com said:
    In a recent Autoweek there was a full page ad for Formula Motorsports Park.
     They describe it as a "performance driving country club" with a 3 mile road
    course, autocross park, go-kart track and more.  They describe it as near
    Philadelphia (off Exit 22 of the PA turnpike)  They have a coupon to send in
    with $5 to just get information.  Before I waste $5 and a stamp, does anyone
    on the list know anything about this?

There was a representative from the FMP organization at a recent tech session I
attended.  Basically, they are building a racetrack, skidpad/autocross area and
a clubhouse.  The racetrack will have garages, parking areas for transport
trailers, electronic timers, it will be usable as either one large (2.8 mile?)
track or two smaller tracks.  The clubhouse area will have basketball, tennis,
soccer and baseball facilities, a "pro shop" for racing goodies, a sauna and
swimming pool.  Right now they're just trying to get the track, skidpad and
clubhouse built.  Future plans include a shopping mall with free bus service to
and from the park.  Right now the track is going to be built into a bowl, which
means that the entire track is visible from any one spot.  In the future, the
organization may build bleachers to handle large crowds for F1 or IMSA racing.
Also, they have just signed A. J. Foyt (or was it Mario Andretti?) to the board
of directors, so they've got some good credibility.  If you're serious about
racing, send in your five bucks, as they've got some charter memberships for
sale for about $500 (held in escrow until the park opens, fully refundable at
any time before then).  Once the park opens, memberships jump to something like
US$5K.  Oh, and if you're not a member, I believe the cost is supposed to be
something like $65/day to play there.

More information (with better accurancy ;) will cost you $5....

Stan's right about distillation curves being different etc. I don't know how
much that would affect operation.

If you put in any kind of octane booster yourself, it is a good idea to wear
serious rubber gloves (not the disposable AIDS thingies). Tetraethyl lead is
toxic, so are some of the substitutes like aniline. I suspect that over the

	The radio's memory plus the alarm/immobiliser which I assume the car
has are sufficient to drain the battery on most P-cars. Also, if the 
car does very
few miles, it's possible that the battery was far from fully charged 
when it was

This is a stab in the dark - have you checked the air flow sensor, that 
is the quarter circle piece of cake shaped dubery between the air filter 
and the intake manifold.

These are known to stick from time to time

this make the DME think the throttle is wide open and consequently you 
get a rich mixture.

I am told that a sharp tap on the top with your open hand normally

Thank you Dave.....

I for one am real tired of hearing about how 911's have this design
flaw that makes them a bear to drive and how 951's are so much
better.

If this is God's truth, why has the 911 been such a successful race
car? It's competition does not have the design flaw of the 911.
Why does the 911 continue to do well at every level of competition if
it has an "inherent design problem"?

Why, by the same token, has the alleged superior 951 (944) not been as
successful?

Price Cobb in a recent Pano interview noted that he and Mauro Baldi
had never raced a 911 before. After their first time out in the 911
3.6 Turbo they both looked at each other and wondered what the big
deal was. They had anticipated this ill-handling car and did not
experience that at all.

Now, I am no Price Cobb, but I have been asking this same question
since I got my 911 several years ago. I don't see the big deal. Sure,
the handling is different, but not so abnormal that the car is
difficult to drive. It is just different.

I have yet to have any 944 come within 1 second of my time at an
autocross. I drive a '78 911 Targa with a stock '88 3.2 Carrera
motor with headers and a chip. Sure, I have trick suspension and
a 7:31 ring & pinion. But I autocross in the San Francisco area, one
of the autox hotbeds. If the 944 S2 or 951 or 968 are so great,
how come they are not cleaning my and every other 911's clock?

I am not trying to say the 911 is superior to the 944 series. That
is an issue best taken up with one's self. I am just saying that
the 911 "inherent design problem" is not a problem at all!!

I had the same set of problems with my CIS '80 SC, and after much

had burned up.  I kicked myself for not checking it before the garage

It affects heat and rate of combustion, flame front propogation and

        Basically the MFI *will* give you more power if you have not
majorly modified your engine.  And if it's in good working condition
and properly adjusted.  Those last two can be a royal pain in the
***.  The carbs are a well-understood quantity that pretty much any
mechanic can deal with.  Not so with MFI.
        MFI *may* also have better cold-start/etc. behavior, probably
better fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and all those other Good
Things that result from fuel-injection systems.  At least the fuel
tends to burn better by being better atomized.

Subject: Re: 911 vs 951

Scott Winders wonders why his 911 isn't getting beat by 944s, 951, 968s.

The tail happy behavior that makes 911s treacherous road cars makes them 
fun autox cars.  The opposite is true for the waterpumpers.  
Waterpumpers are safe and easy to drive fast on the street, but on an 
autox course, their concentrated front weight means they don't like 
tight corners.  951s are really fun on race tracks, but are a pain at an 
autox.  I have yet to find a turbocharged car of any stripe that is easy 
to autox.  968s and 951s also suffer from an autobaun final drive at 
autoxes.  Normal 944s don't have anything like the weight/HP (18:1 vs 13 
to 15:1) common in later 911s.  The greater weight is supported on tires 
the same (or smaller) size as the later 911s.  I think you can say that 
911s and waterpumpers are different kinds of cars.  Comparing the two on 
the basis of autox times doesn't tell you much.

In Golden Gate region, I have the most highly prepared waterpumper that 
autoxes.  I have tires, Koni shocks and an aftermarket front swaybar on 
a 924Turbo ($931).  Needless to say, Scott's well-prepared 911 (His 
wheels are worth more than my car :-) ) cleans me up.  It would be fun 
to see Byron Short show up in his S2, although the prep level (for SCCA 
Solo II) is about the same as my $931.  An S2 has Weight/HP similar to 
an SC or Carrera, and doesn't suffer from a turbocharger.

Despite my whining, waterpumpers are fun and challenging to drive. I 
lament the fact that there are not many waterpumpers autoxing.  At this 
point in Porsche's progress, they represent a very reasonable entry 
level for newcomers.  We need them to show and play and be part of us.

Hi,

I've had my 911 for about 8 months and have been enjoying Excellence and
Panorama magazines for about a year. The ads in those magazines are about as
interesting to me as the articles. I was looking at the Engine Builders
Supply ad and had a question. 

What is the difference between a top-end rebuild kit and an engine re-ring
kit. Rings only cost $120 for a 2.4 911 engine, what else comes with the
re-ring kit?   

Also, why do 911 performance rebuild kits cost 3-4 times as much as 914 kits
when they only have 2 more cylinders. Is 911 engineering really that much
more complex than a 914, or is it more price gouging? Do these kits include
everything? 

To many of you these questions might seems stupid, but I have never rebuilt
an engine. Please enlighten me.

One last question, Automotion sent me a $50 rebate on performance chips. I'm
interested in getting one, but where do they go in a '73 911S? Just kidding

This section of highway (from OKC west to Bakersfield) has to be my absolute 
favorite road.  Especially going through Arizona, New Mexico, and the California 
high dessert.  Incredible country, beautiful vistas, and mile after mile of flat, 
straight, concrete ribbon just begging to be eaten up!

I've done the trip several times, but only once in a P-car.  That was back in '89,
when I drove my '944 from its old home in California to its new one in NJ.  That trip
ranks as the very best road trip I have ever made.

Of course, you've got to watch out for the snow, and particuarly the ice, going
over Flagstaff.  There's a giant whirligig windmill somewhere in West Texas that
always makes me smile, and a solar furnace in the California dessert that's
kinda cool.  My favorite roadside sight has to be the airfield at North Edwards
(or is it Mojave?).  You come out of the barren dessert, into a two stoplight
town with tumbleweed blowing down the main street.  But there, on the outskirts, 
is what looks like Atlanta International Airport.  Hundreds of giant jets - 747s, 
727s, even 707s, all parked in rows on the tarmac.  Of course, they're all just 
being stored there, in the land where nothing rusts, until such time as the 
economics of the airline industry make it profitable to fly them again, but what 
a sight!

By the way - if there is such a thing as a rust free, unrestored 356, this is
where it is hiding.  Keep those eyes open, and peer into every tumbledown shed
that you pass - you never know!

I've rambled long enough and wasted enough bandwidth, but your post brought back
some very good memories.  Maybe someday soon I'll take "baby' back for a visit to

Subject: Re: 911 vs. 951 (long)


At the risk of not restating the theme, I am going to put in my $.02 worth!
 I enthusiastically agree with Scott Winders and Dave Darling on the
DRIVABILITY of the 911 platform.  It is stable, predictable, and fast!  I
spent three days at Sebring battling with the 951's and I know where I was
faster than they were...in the turns!  And as far as the dreaded TTO
(trailing throttle oversteer), a properly set up 911 has VERY LITTLE.  Turn 17
 is a huge decreasing radius sweeper, that you enter off of a 1/2 mile
straight.  I go in at about 150, stand on the brakes, and then TURN IN, while
still hard on the brakes!  Once the car slows down to about 80, approaching
the first apex, I lift off the brakes, grab 3rd gear, and set off like a bat
out of h*ll, towards the 2nd apex, and down the pit straight.  The quicker
951's used the exact same technique.  So much for the wicked 911 handling.

I will agree that the 944/951 platform (high polar moment & 50/50 weight
distribution) is easier to drive at speed, and much more neutral and
forgiving than a front biased or rear biased car.  The car will resist the ini
tial urge to understeer or oversteer.  What people do not understand is that
this DOES NOT make the car inherently faster at the limit, only easier to
drive at the limit.  Because the average person will feel more comfortable
with it, they can get closer to the limit of the car.  A 911 is much harder
to drive, but well driven it is easily a match for the equivalent HP 944/951.

One final point is that a 911 demands to be driven properly; i.e. obeying all
of the laws of physics, using the weight shift of the car to generate more
cornering power, proper apexing, etc.  It rewards poor technique with
off-road excursions.  A 944, on the other hand will get around quite nicely
(that high polar moment again!) whilst driven all wrong.  I know...I've spent
alot of time trying to re-teach 944 drivers that have picked up bad habits.
 If they drove a 911, they would not have been able to get away with such
behavior.

Sorry for the long-winded discourse, but driving is my favorite subject.

I know all about it since one of my friends, Bob Russo, is a VP of the organiz

That's the good news. The bad news is that it isn't built yet, with ground
breaking scheduled for later this year. Hopefully at least the track will be
open in late 96.

>

I was at a driver ed event in Talladega, AL last month and noticed
my temp climbing at the end of the back straight.  By the time I
entered the pits and shut the engine down, the temp gauge had just
popped into the hot region and the warning light came on.  We noticed
that I didnt have 1 drop of coolant left!  So after letting the engine
cool, we filled with water and started the engine. Temp started to
climb again, we shut it down. Finally figured out what happened.
While running at 6K+ rpm on the back stretch, my thermostat failed
in the closed position.  The sudden closure increased the pressure
so much that it split the input heater hose spewing all my coolant
all over the track.  We temporarily fixed my car by duct taping
the heater hose and ripping the innards out of the thermostat.
We didnt have the magic snap ring pliers.  As long as I kept the
heat off and the engine running to supply vacuum to the heater valve,
the hose didnt leak and I was able to limp home (2 hr drive).

I had been noticing my car running warmer than usual, especially on
cool days.  While sitting at a traffic light, the temp would climb
to the top of the normal range. When the car moved or the fans kicked
on, the temp dropped back to the bottom of the normal range.  This
happened for awhile until eventually my fan switch failed.  I replaced
the switch and noticed the fans came on much earlier than before. But
still the car ran warmer that I thought it should.  What I suspect was
happening, was that my thermostat was never completely opening and
then it failed completely.  So, if you notice your temps running
hotter on days that arent the hot, replace your thermostat and/or
fan switch.  My car now consistently stays on the bottom line of
the normal range, even on 85F degree days in city traffic.

While I was at it, I replaced my coolant with Zerex Extreme 450.
It is phosphate-free and approved by Porsche. (See Panorama March 95)
It's also 1/2 the price of the gray bottle Prestone.

Also, if your car is overheating and you have A/C, with your engine
shut off, turn your key to the ON position and mash (southern term)
the A/C button.  It'll make your fans run.  Mine didn't run because
the coolant was all over the track instead of being in contact with
the fan switch.

I think its quite puzzling too that everyone always focuses on the 
drawbacks of this layout without seeing the benefits.  A rear-engined 
layout offers the following benefits:

1) Superior traction under acceleration

2) Effecient packaging (just like FWD that everyboby else seems to have 
embraced)

3) Excellent balance while braking

4) Very responsive steering

I'm sure there are many others.  I'm not sure why, but the press is 
always trying to point out the problems with this layout for the nth time, 
but rarely do they write about its inherent advantages.

Dag!  That's exactly what my car's doing!  I figured it was some reaction to
cool weather.  How much trouble is it to change the thermostat?  The last one
I replaced was in a Buick, and it was too easy -- pop the radiator cap and
there it was!  Pull it out (literally -- no tools required!), stick in a new
one, all done.  I assume on a P-car it'll take an hour and some Appropriate
Tools.  I'm not going to have to pull the water pump or something, am I?  I
was planning on flushing and filling the radiator before going to Pocono next
weekend, this'll fit right in with that...

Subject: Mystery plastic in oil screen (912)

This weekend I decided I should attend to the 6000 mile maintenance early 
and as such took out the oil screen and magnet that surrounds the oil pickup 
line. This was the first time I've done this since having the engine rebuilt 
about 5000 miles ago. (More years ago than I'd like to admit).

To my dismay there were small bits of soft blue plastic (looks like gasket 
sealer) all around the wire mesh protecting the oil intake. What did this 
guy do when he rebuilt my engine ? I was not happy with the independent 
shops attitude at the time but got warm fuzzies from the fact that the chief 
mechanic *claimed* to have worked for a local Porsche dealership previously 
(for all I know they may have fired him).

Now to the core of the mystery. I tested the 'oil booster line' by holding 
the 'by-pass valve' in place manually. I got oil flow after cranking for a 
few seconds. Since the car has been running very hot I was afraid of a 
clogged booster line causing oil flow to bypass the oil cooler.

Last weekend I aborted a trip when the oil temp gauge crawled close to the 
red line while driving normally at highway speeds in 80 degree weather. I've 
never seen the car run so hot before. I suspected the guage and sender but 
after stopping I touched the bypass oil filter and could not believe how hot 
it was. (Not very scientific I know.)

When one of the oil cooler 'O' rings failed in cold weather (years before 
the engine rebuild) I had the chance to clean the oil cooler and inspect it. 
I also cleaned the cooling impeller. Yes my weber carburettors need 
rebuilding and tuning. Ignition was checked with a timing light about three 
months ago so I *think* thats OK but I'll check it this weekend. 

I'm going to be very reluctant to drive this car until I can have an idea of 
what is going on inside my engine. Does anyone have any idea what this blue 
plactic (gasket sealer?) is from. Did a seal fail somewhere in my engine ? 
Do I need to tear it apart to find the cause ?

I have an 82 911SC and recently experienced almost exactly what you have

pump relay (it's on the fuse panel in the trunk).  The car started fine for a
few weeks, and then the problem reappeared.  I took it to my Porsche mechanic
who immediately recognized it as a bad/worn/corroded fuse.  He replaced the
fuse and it has been fine ever since. 

The Porsche mechanic initially believed that the entire fuse panel had begun
to disintegrate and, therefore, connections were not being made.  That was
not the problem with mine (yet!), but it be another possible explanation for
your problem.

Hmmm. Well, that's a lot better than what I'd guessed. You don't use
RTV there, you use 3M #8001 "gorilla snot" weatherstrip and trim
adhesive to hold the gaskets to the covers. On the 914's too, for

Get a turkey baster. No, you *can't* use the one that your wife has. She'll
notice. Trust me. Pop the filter out, suction the oil, wipe it out with a
clean rag/paper shop towel/etc, drop in the new filter (or the old filter
if you're one of those "oil at 3k, filter at 6k" types), fill with oil,
replace the gasket, top, and don't forget to torque down that bolt! Then
proceed with the rest of the engine.

Possibly a clogged cooler. What I'd recommend is this: buy a case of filters,
a couple of cases of 40 wt. oil. Change the oil with *GREAT* frequency 
(not quite daily, but at least every 1k miles, maybe weekly if you're
not driving it a lot) [sidebar: my SC is seeing about 1500 miles a week
right now, so I have a skewed view on "a lot" of miles...]

If it improves, then you're fine. If it doesn't, then you'll need to think
about dropping the engine, pulling the shroud and cooler for look-see.
I'd also be real tempted to pop off the strainer, and use compressed air
to blow down the pushrod tubes to see if anything interesting pops out
of that big hole in the bottom of the engine.

Good luck!

Top-end kits *typically* have just enough to take the heads on and off;
re-ring kits have enough to take the pistons out. That usually includes
rings, and for waterpumpers, rod bearings (you don't have to take the
rods off the crank to get to the pistons on air cooled engines).

In part, due to the limited market. Lots of Type IV engines out there.
*LOTS*. Count the total number of late model VW Buses, 914s (there's about
120k alone), etc. vs. the total number number of 911s of a particular
engine configuration... It's not even close.

Second, the 911 stuff is of *MUCH* higher quality. 

Couple the two, and you get significantly higher prices.

The stock clutch in a 914 lasts about 100K miles.  Everybody I've
talked to has gotten the same results.

If you replace it with a heavier duty clutch, you may get a few more
miles out of it.

But if you do use a heavier clutch, you run the risk of breaking off
the clutch cable tube.  And they aren't cheap to weld back in.

I had no problem inserting the cam belt into the gap between the balance 
gear on the crank and the rear belt cover. Slide one edge in upwards at a 
diagonal in the centre and gradually push the belt in as you work away 
from the centre. But then again, I have an '86 944 so it might be different.

The auxiliary oil filter is located in the bodywork just in front of the
right rear wheel and its purpose is to provide extra protection for the new
hydraulic valve lash adjusters against contaminants in the oil. The oil
passes through this secondary filter after it leaves the oil tank and
passes through the oil pump, and just before it enters the engine. The oil
passes through the primary filter just after it is scavenged from the
engine and before it goes to the cooler and oil tank. Oil changes are every
15,000 miles and both oil filters are to be changed at 30,000 miles. I
think the engineers felt that the time between filter changes was so great
that they didn't have to worry about convenience.

Subject: Re: Mystery Plastic in 912 Sump

Dear Chris:

      Hummh, blue plastic in the 912 sump screen? Was it hard or soft blue
plastic? If hard, it could be  from the blue-green Flywheel Seal that comes
in Reinz Lower End Kits. (These seals aren't nearly as good as the White
Silicone seals which, unfortunately, you can't get anymore.)
    If it's a soft blue plastic, that could be from the blue "O" rings used
under the case Acorn Nut washers. Sometimes a bit of these seals is sheared
off when torquing the case and ends up in the sump.
    Since the Flywheel Seal is some 60mm (2.4") while the Acorn Nut  "O" ring
is about 1/4" diameter, any curvature of the pieces could tell you where it
came from. If it's just blobs or gobs of blue stuff without any definite
curvature  (or round cross section), then it's probably excess Blue RTV.
Unfortunately, Blue RTV is a Trademark of a Turkey. Especially excess RTV of
any color.
     As  to the overheating- check your High Speed Timing just for funsies.
If it's 40 degrees advanced  (or 20 degrees), that's the problem. Check fan
belt for proper tension (not way loose). Check (with engine OFF!) for
rag/paper towel in fan. And check to see if heater boxes flaps are open
rather than shut. 
     New engines tend to run hot, but should be broken in at 6000 miles,
unless your "normal highway speed" was 90+. THEN they do run pretty warm!

KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!
The Maestro
P.S. The hand on the oil filter is a pretty good indicator. If you can hold
your hand on it, its NOT running too hot. If the thermal radiation from the
can tess you it would  be stupid to touch it, it probably IS running too hot.
The  dip stick works the same way.

Subject: Re: Porschephiles #1315 Mon Apr 10 17:03:42 CDT 1995

A while ago I did some automotive reserch i.e. top speed runs on  
Autobahn with my 944 using regular motoring gas available in Germany  
but varying the octane rating. There is a distinct improvement in  
top speed (about 210 -> 245 kph) when the octane rating goes from  
91(2) to 95. The engine runs fine with both. Basic physics seems to  
say that at high speed wind resistance is the main opponent and it  
is top horsepower that counts. So what is it in the higher octane  
gas that makes this happen? Some people in recent discussion on   
Avgas said that higher octane (above the minimum) doesn't really  
contribute to power.

Chris,

Dont know much about this BUT recent threads on the network would indicate
its one of those cash flow devices.


  An interesting article in the UK owners club magazine gave details of a
complete replacement ECU system for the 911 developed by Bob Watson Racing.
Sounds very interesting and apparently suitable for retrofit onto 930s with
K-Jetronic.
  They are charging 5500 UK POUNDS for it fully fitted. The tuning is/will be 
done on a dyno and there is/will be an interface to a lap top for tweeking.
Think its realy aimed at racing but probably very good for street. One claim
they have is that they got 25bhp more after converting their RACE RSR on
mechanical injection system. It also gave them a better lap time round Oulton
Park by 1.5 secs.

I stand corrected.

Looking at the brocure that Haltec sends out, it kinda
implies that anyone with a laptop and about $2k can do
this.

Perhaps this is the bait to get started with a system

Subject: RE: Porschephiles #1315 Mon Apr 10 17:03......


The only time I got my "87" 944 to 140mph was with a slight down hill and 
a strong tailwind.  I suspect you're seeing speedometer error as these cars
are not capable of 147mph as you stated (I used 0.6 as the conversion).  I 
have read that a car tuned properly to take advantage of increased octane
can see a performance increase of 1.5% from 87 to 93 octane.  I suspect
your observed variations are due to day to day changes in humidity and 
ambient air temperature which affect an engine's performance.  

It has to do with the rate at which the fuel burns and at what point the 
flame front is initiated.  The key is to develop the flame front so the 
cylinder pressure is peaking when the piston begins the power stroke.  The 
higher octane gases will keep burning as the piston travels to bottom dead
center.  That will keep the pressure in the cylinder higher through more of
the power stroke and more power will result.  This may not be *exactly* corr-
ect but the gist is correct.  

So if the engine is not tuned for high octane gas, the flame front will not
be initated soon enough, take too much time to develop, and the fuel
 will still be burning when the exhaust valves open.  This happened when 
a friend of mine used 110 octane gas in a motorcycle with chrome exhausts.
At the cylinder interface the chrome got discolored from heat and I assumed
it was because the gas was still burning.

A high octane gas burns slower than low octane gas and resists pre-ignition.

Any critiques or additional info is welcome

Ok- I think we've sorted out my tensioner problems.
I was working on the wrong nut- the 17mm one that looks like
the locknuts for other tensioners- and not the 13mm one 
that locks down the mechanical "self" tensioner.

I checked again, and yes the fiche manuals DO have the 
information, at the end of section 15 under the title
"Cam Belt Mechanical Tensioner."

Thanks to everyone for the good advice...

When the engine is hot, take off the oil cap and smell.  If the smell

I'd check your distributor to see if the advance is working properly.  
Adjusting the air correction screws should work.  The fact that they 
aren't affecting idle speed indicates something else if wrong.

Rough idle, lean throttle surge at about 2500-3000 rpm, hesitation, 
"wandering" idle speed and a rich mixture that adjusting the pump won't 
correct are the usual warning signs.  A 911S is a little rough at the 
low end by nature (particularly the pre-'72s).

The Webers don't have fuel enrichment and MFI responds better under

Subject: '85 911 Vacuum Leak

Based on reading the archives, I suspected a vacuum leak was causing the 
rough and surging idle.  I sealed off the air flow sensor and pressurized 
the intake system with smoky air at 3 PSI.  A small leak was found at a 
rubber boot which was easily fixed.  A larger source of smoky and hissing 
was coming from behind the cooling fan.  After digging around a little, I 
found the leak.  It seems to be coming from the point where the left 
camshaft endplate mates to the cam housing.  It can be seen by removing 
the #1 spark plug connector.  There is also oil seepage below that point 
on the under side of the engine.  Now some questions for the engine 
experts.

Is there some easy fix for this problem?

Can I fix this without removing the engine?

If I use the same sprocket shims, will I have to check the sprocket 
alignment?

If I am careful to set the engine at TDC and mark which hole the cam 
timing pin is in, do I have to check the cam timing when everything is 
back together?



BTW, the smoky air trick worked great.  Much easier to see than a hissing 
sound.  If anyone is interested, I will tell you how I did it.

Subject: Re: Autothority Mass Flow for 3.2 Carrera

> How about just the chip?

That's tougher. In general, it's the same sort of deal. Two data points:

1) I used to spend about 65 hours of dyno time developing programming for
   a race engine. That's *TYPICALLY* 3 engines, for a total investment
   on the part of the team owner of about $100k. And we didn't have to
   deal with problems like shitty gas, idling in traffic in the summer
   with the A/C on high, etc. So anyone that says they can just "whup out
   a new chip" is completely full of shit. At least AutoThority *has*
   a dyno...

2) see Pete Albrecht's note about how you build an advance curve for 
   a distributor and multiply that by about 100 for a degree of difficulty.
   The factory has the advantage of they already know *everything* about 
   the engine, so it's easy for them to do, relative speaking. To do on
   the outside, first you either have to "reverse engineer" the factory
   stuff, which strictly speaking is not illegal, but the way most people
   do it (disassembly the microcode in the chip) *IS* illegal. Or you have 
   to reverse engineer everything they know that made it possible for them to 
   write their code. Yeah. right.

The use of "special chips" was made popular originally by two things:

* initial shipment of chips that significantly mis-guessed about the 
  prevailing quality of US gas, so a chip with different assumptions
  performed better

* turning up the boost on 944 Turbos. FOr details, see the archives under
  "Head Gasket, Blown"

Porsche in general doesn't give up anything to anyone. Once it is established
that there is a better way to do something with their cars, it becomes
further researched, documented and part of The Way. Typically with more
improvements, BTW.

Everything I've read indicates that it's not just a "concept" car, but
a fully functional prototype.  It is designed by Porsche with the intent
that it will be manufactured in China, by the Chinese, for sale in the
Chinese market.  Design variations allow for different powerplants,
body styles, and the eventual export of the cars to other countries...

Hmmm, sounds a lot like the Beetle story doesn't it...

What split-up?  What old system?  Porsche is, and has always been, an
independent company.  The only association with VW-Audi (other than
design/engineering work which they also do for many other companies)
was the marketing agreement for a shared Porsche+Audi dealer network
here in the U.S.

Porsche (the car manufacturing "division") anticipates breaking even
next fiscal year, with a small profit to be turned the year after.  It's
products include the 911, 928, and soon the Boxster.

Porsche (the engineering consulting "division") turns a tidy profit
every year...  It's "products" include the *design and engineering
services* for the C-88, along with all the other engineering/design/
development *services* they provide to (probably) hundreds of other
companies.

	Does anyone have any experience with either the Ignitor or

I've heard from others is to use the Bosch blue coil. Is this a good

aggressive street driving (see previous qualifier). I know Jacobs has
one rated for a steady 28kV, and an "Omni-Pak" which has some

Subject: 911 Transmission Problem.

I own a `77 911S that has a transmission problem.
While I was having the 2.7 RE-rebuilt (under warranty, thank God !), I gave the
transmission to a local PCA`er, who does extensive motor & transmission work,
to repair.  First gear was extremely elusive and 2nd was very notchy and would
grind at higher rpm shifts.  He said he replaced 5 syncro`s, 2nd & 3rd dog
teath, 2nd gear operating sleeve, gaskets and seals.  Parts & Labor $1200.
Now with a totally rebuilt motor and a supposedly rebuilt tranny, I`m ready for
some `next to new` performance.  NO  WAY.  The motor is runs great but the
transmission is EXACTLY the same.  The clutch is new and a new short shifter.
AND, to make a bad situation worse, now I can`t find this guy.
Is there something else in the transmission that could cause the problems or
does it sound like this guy stiffed me and really did nothing but take my money
?

My experience with the Jacobs on My Bronco was that it ate the plugs under load. 
Every time I pulled the trailer the plugs would go away. Sent the CRAP (whoops not
the list) back to jacobs and had th EAT the $35 restocking FEE. Watch out for 
the fine print.

hi there,
	i recently noticed that my expansion tank was looking as if it 
was in need of replacement (it had expanded enough to rub some paint off 
of the inside of the hood near the fender at one point).  my question is 
that there seem to be two expansion tank caps, one for pre 85.5 944s and 
another for the later cars--why is this?  is it because the later 
radiator had a slightly larger core and therefore a different pressure 
rating was required?  i had recently changed the radiator on my '83 to 
the larger core variety (i did not replace the cap with the later type 
though), could this have caused the expansion tank to be put under too 
much pressure?  i think i'll change the tank anyhow (after 145K miles i 
think it has served me well!), but should i use the newer cap also?

Subject: Aviation Gas



You all may have already discussed this stuff but I felt it was pertinent.

I have read that a car tuned properly to take advantage of increased octane
can see a performance increase of 1.5% from 87 to 93 octane.  

It has to do with the rate at which the fuel burns and at what point the 
flame front is initiated. The goal is to tune the engine for the specific
octane gas being used to hit Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) for a specific
engine speed and load condition.  The key is to develop the flame front so the 
cylinder pressure is peaking when the piston begins the power stroke.  The 
higher octane gases will keep burning as the piston travels to bottom dead
center.  That will keep the pressure in the cylinder higher through more of
the power stroke and more power will result.


So if the engine is not tuned for high octane gas, the flame front will not
be initated soon enough, take too much time to develop, and the fuel
will still be burning when the exhaust valves open.  This happened when 
a friend of mine used 110 octane gas in a motorcycle with chrome exhausts.
At the cylinder interface the chrome got discolored from heat and I assumed
it was because the gas was still burning.

A high octane gas burns slower than low octane gas and resists pre-ignition.

Any critiques or additional info is welcome

I don't know about which cap to run, but the expansion tank probably
simply wore out.  I replaced mine a few years back after it simply
started to expand during long drives.  Change the tank before it
springs a leak and causes a problem.

Remember to bleed the cooling system when you're done, just to be

Hi,

Thanks for the info on engine rebuilds. I hate to ask so many questions
without being able to contribute much myself, but I have yet another
question.

My mother has an '87 911 with the standard  3.2L engine. She was away for
about 10 days and when she started her car when she got back, she noticed
that the car would idle/stumble at around 500-700 rpm,  otherwise it runs
fine. I realize that there are many things that could affect the idle, but is
there anything I could check before I bring it to the mechanic.  I did put in
a bottle of Techron, hoping that the fuel injectors were the problem, but the
car hasn't been driven enough to have had an effect yet.

Well, yes. I looks it would be described as 'blobs' of stuff. I took a

Good ideas there. The rag/paper towel lodged in impeller would work nicely

What you just said was "if you use higher octane gas, you can advance
the spark further because it is less likely to knock; if you've built
the rest of the engine to take advantage of that then you can make
more power".

Hi,

Thanks for the advice. I think I'll survive with my neg 1 degree. It seems
like the best solution of all is simply to rebuild the front suspension if
is all that important. The only parts that seem to be involved are the ball
joints at the end of the strut, the strut themselves, and the a-arm
bushings. I'll probably get around to it  in the next decade or so...
- --------

Don't forget the A-Arms themselves. The bushings can't really
be replaced. The best way to do this job is to get a whole
front suspension from a late model car and bolt it in.
This is also cheaper. You will only need to modify the
sway bar mount by cutting off the late model one and
welding on a tab for the old (good) style one.

Advancing the timing to the point of knock and backing off does not maximize
brake torque.  My point was:  to do it correctly, you need a dyno and a lot

worth the aggravation.  Furthermore, the chances of getting it right are slim.

Subject: Finding Vacuum Leaks

Many people have expressed interest in the smoke method I used to find a 
vacuum leak, so here goes.



Equipment needed:

Compressed air source regulated down to 3 PSI

Canister with hose connection (I used a disposable medical type vacuum 
canister that is used to suck out and contain body fluids.)

A few cigarettes.



Seal off the intake system as early in the air flow stream as possible.  
I removed the air flow sensor and put a 3 inch diameter cup in it's 
place.  This isolated everything downstream of the airflow sensor.

Connect one hose connection on the canister to the 3 PSI air source.

Connect the other hose connection on the canister to one of the vacuum 
hoses connections on the throttle body.

Verify that the intake system is pressurized by loosening a boot or 
something else connected to the intake system.  All vacuum connections 
are not connected directly to the intake system.  The oil fill cap works 
fine on a 911.

Now that everything is connected and ready,  take the canister lid off 
and insert a lit cigarette (filter end first) into the canister outlet 
hose connection from the bottom side of the lid.  Replace the lid.  The 
cigarette is now inside the canister and all the airflow is passing thru 
the lit cigarette then into the intake system.  It may take a minute for 
the clean air to be purged before the smoke will appear.  You may have to 
use a mirror to pinpoint the leak if smoke appears from the back side of 
the engine (911 problem only).

It worked for me.



I am still hoping that one of the engine experts will give me some 
advice.  Here are my original questions:

I have a leak at the point where the left camshaft endplate mates to the 
cam housing.  It can be seen by removing the #1 spark plug connector.  
There is also oil seepage below that point on the under side of the 
engine.

Is there some easy fix for this problem?

Can I fix this without removing the engine?

If I use the same sprocket shims, will I have to check the sprocket 
alignment?

If I am careful to set the engine at TDC and mark which hole the cam 
timing pin is in, do I have to check the cam timing when everything is 
back together?

I don't have sway bars on my car (comfort group 71). What year suspension
will fit in my 71 with no modification? What is the difference between old
and new suspensions? Thanks. Ashley.


>Don't forget the A-Arms themselves. The bushings can't really
be replaced. The best way to do this job is to get a whole
front suspension from a late model car and bolt it in.
This is also cheaper. You will only need to modify the
sway bar mount by cutting off the late model one and
welding on a tab for the old (good) style one.

Oh let me TELL you about that Snap Ring!  It don't come out easy
without the proper tool!  If you don't have the proper tool, don't
even try. It took me 4 days working 3 hours each day to get that
thing out. I had bought two different SRPs. The problem was that
the pins were too small.  Working from below, I rotated the snap
ring until the holes were at the top of the water pump. This can
be done with a small phillips screwdriver.  I could manage to
compress the snap ring, but when I tried to pull out, the pliers
would slip off.  Finally after 4 days, I got one edge of the snap
ring out of the groove. I used a screwdriver to slowly work around
the ring and ease it out.  I had trouble catching up to the Snap-On
salesman. He drives around in a van. That's the only way to get
Snap-On tools in this town, track him down.

Make sure you use a thermostat from Porsche!  I bought one at an
auto parts store. It was only $6 and didnt look too robust. So, I
went to Porsche and got one ($35). The gasket is pre-installed on
the Porsche thermostat and it looks MUCH meatier.

Tracy, I would definitely get this fixed before going on the track.
I was fortunate enough to have had the temp select on heat and that
hose rupture.  I feel the damage would have been worse (head gasket)
if that hose didn't rupture.

I also had no problem sliding the new belt in. I did practice several
times with the old belt to get my technique down. I removed the
tensioner too as I replaced that roller along with the others.
THAT was very difficult to get back on.

By the way, my service manual says to just loosen the nut and the bolt
and then retighten. It says nothing about about moving the tensioner
while the nut/bolt is loosened.  Is this procedure something new?

I believe that there were either 3 or 4 'dimples' where the spots for holes
to be drilled were clearly marked for different countries (the tall thinly
spaced ones being for US models, the short, but wide for German, etc.)
The dealer generally would use a drill or self-tapping screw (ack!) to put
the hole for the license plate in for the first customer. If your car came
from another country, the holes may be there from that country.

parts to him and he didn;t beef about taking them back.  Also, to

I rode in one a few weeks ago....and found it to be completely
disgusting.  Fast, yes.....very fast - and not that expensive.

End of pros....now the cons:

You lose the front trunk to a radiator and fans.

You will eventually be like this owner and the only reason
I met him was because he brought his car to my mechanic
friend's place (where I'm working on my 914-6 project),
because his transmission was screwed.  The engine
tore it apart.

CV joints break.

He had also installed the ugly (IMHO) body kit that
Renegade will package with their V8 conversions.  This
body kit involves removing so much of the structural
parts of the 914 that the body creaks and cracks all
the time.  Water leaks into the passenger compartment
and the bodywork is coming away from the remaining
metal bits on the car.

Slightly impaired handling due to engine weight and
placement in the car.

Guys (& Gals):
	I agree with Joe, the cam belt can be put on with the dreaded crankshaft 
pulley in place, however great care must be taken not to kink the belt as you try 
to feed it gently around the pulley into its place.  When fitting the new belt 
start here!
	Also to help upon removing the old belt, pull it out of this confinement 
last, so that you can remember the reverse procedure.  I would recommend fitting 
the old belt a few times as practice...and remember the old belt is more flexible!

Subject: Re: Update on dead 944S

Sanjay,
	Yes there is a test you can do to see if the valves are not bent; it 
involves putting on a new timing belt and doing a compression test.  There is no 
easy way to check if the valves are straight or not, however what you can do is 
remove the camshaft housing and do a visual on the height of the valve stems.  
Since the engine is at that point pretty well down to the head, depending on the 
mileage it would be false economy not to lap the valves in and replace the valve 
stem seals anyway.  The whole job is quite straightforward, and if you have done a 
clutch on one of these I'd have thought you will have no major setbacks.
	The replacing belt idea may not be that bad, but make sure you get the 
valve timing correct.
Cheers,  Jan

Well, after staying free and clear for 5 years, smokey
got me.  $330.00 for doing 82 in a 65 zone.  Ouch!
Hopefully the insurance co doesn't kick me out or raise 
the rate. What really pissed me off was that I was
on the right lane, and there were other car (on the left
lane) going faster than I was. Smokey was pretty well hidden, 
I didn't see him until my car passed right in front of him. 
That's when the Valentine-1 screammed, but it was too late.
Never thought a little sign with 2 digits has so
much impact on me.;-) I have to be careful now, another
ticket and I'll be in deep du-du.

On to another subject, whenever I shift from 1st to 2nd
or 2nd to 3rd, as I release the clutch, there's a noticeable
clunk noise originates from the rear of the car, and the
car lurches noticeably.  If I don't back-off from the
throttle when the clutch is released, that noise and the
lurch reduce significantly.  So is it OK to shift without
letting off on the gas? BTW, the beast is a 85-911.

Thanks a bunch, see ya at the Parade.

but not as much fun.  Maintence costs will be higher for the 930,  but IMHO
well worth it.  I wouldn't hesitate if I were you.  Another downside is that

So Stan, how about using the latest Porsche chip and/or engine computer 
in your car? Would that make a difference?

On a related note, I've noticed that many cars have been losing power 
recently due to the tighter emissions standards, e.g. M-B 500E going from 
322hp to 315hp (I think). Has Porsche had a really clean engine to begin 
with, or have they somehow tweaked their engines to perform cleaner _and_ 
better each year? The 911 hp numbers haven't changed from year to year, 
in the 964 and 993 generations.

Sure. If you updated the rest of the engine too... It's not like you
walk into the dealer and see "Turbo 95" software release that's coming Real
Soon Now.... they work where it does them the most good and that's the
current platform. On a related note, there *HAVE* been mechanical 
changes in the 3.2 -> 3.6 -> 3.8 progression that are a direct result
of things noted in programming the EFI.

Two things there, first, Porsche has done an EXCEPTIONAL job of meeting
tighter emissions standards *and* getting more HP. Second, note that 
there is a 0.2 liter increase in the 993 ffrom the 964...

Finally, Porsche claimed HP is usually *WAY* low from actually measured
if you pop the engine out of a new car and put it on a calibrated dyno.
Specmanship, most likely. Avoiding liability issues by claiming more
performance than the engine delivers, also possible.

LG, old kumquat, if I may be so bold as to observe, the '63 Stingray is

<Unka Bart thinks...heavy clouds of black smoke appear...>

(OK, Let's try this again...)

<ahem...> Publicly coveting the '63 Stingray (as opposed to the '65-'67)
is a demonstration of automotive naivete similar to that of the naif who
lusts for a Farleigh Davidson..., er, Harley Dickerson, (ummmm, oh hell,
whatever) in lieu of a real motorcycle.

Both evidence the tragic triumph of stylistic fluff and marketing hype
over functional substance. "But unka Bart," one protests, "sure the '63
Stingray had a back window that was absurdly and dangerously
disfunctional as a result of that stupid split window, and we all know
that it had drum brakes that were seriously deficient given the enormous
power available, but man! you gotta admit that the fake air intakes on
the hood and the totally cool look of the split window compensated for
all that!" "And," one would doubtless add, "while the '65-'67 models all
had awesome disk brakes to match their awesome power, they didn't have
any of that fake crap, nor did they have that *neat* rear window that you
couldn't *see* anything through!"

Good Point, I gotta give you, er..."one" that.

"And as for motorscooters, Unka Bart, you clearly don't know *squat!*"
(True, however I *do* know Jack Shitt, but that's another story...)  "Oh
yeah," one'd probably continue, "if you all want is a scooter that will

warned me there'd be days like this, but *nooooo*, I never listen.  Now
where did I put those little green numbers that Herb said I should

So then, LG, old rutabega, pray elucidate,  what *does* "Porsche" mean?

Subject: more on tyres

I agree more scientific testing of these tyres may disagree with my
views in which case I bow to science. However if enough other people
express similar views on a tyre then maybe the experts are wrong.

I do no rotation and have only needed tracking once in the last five
years. I have also not needed balancing accept when new tyres are fitted.
Tread depth (visual) and pressures checked every fortnight. Tyre depth 
measured and recorded every couple of months unless visual checks found
anything noticeable. I have stuck to factory recommended pressures within
+ 1psi, never below. All tyres have worn across very evenly for both cars.

Porsche 944 Lux  1985  Tyres 215/60 all round, wheels 7J and 8J forged.

1) Pirelli P600s. Despite Pirelli's reputation a very ordinary
tyre with ok grip in dry, less in wet verging on inadequate.
Average breakaway characteristics. Wear rate was good at approx
30,000 a set. Neither noisy or quiet, same comment for ride.

2) Yokohoma A-008Ps. Much better tyre with fabulous grip in the
dry and reduced but still very good in the wet. Gentle on the
limit allowing panic free drifts (usually all four wheels). Front's
capable of 18,000 miles, rears 11,500. Noise and ride average as 
with the P600s.

3) Dunlop 8000s. Not so much grip as Yoko's in dry but even so
more than adequate. Grip little reduced by the wet and probably
better than the Yokos. However breakaway was a little sudden.
Car sold but it looked like a mileage of 25-30,000 was possible.
Noise was slightly better than the A-008Ps or P600s, ride average
again.

Porsche 944 2.7    1989  205/55 ZR 16 (f) and 225/50 ZR 16 (r)
			   Wheels 7J and 8J, forged "flat" alloys.

1) Dunlop D40-M2s. Good grip in dry, gentle on the limit. Grip
also good in the wet even if a little lower. However these tyres
were skittish in the wet even if they didn't actually misbehave,
i.e. no hairy moments. Robbed me of confidence however. Mileage
was close to 35,000 as a guess as they were part worn when bought.
So so ride and fairly noisy.

2) Pirelli P-Zero Systems. Excellent grip in the wet and dry, too
early to say about on the limit handling. Slightly better than
average noise (so the exhaust note is now clearer!) and slightly
better than average ride. Too early for mileage estimates.
Considering the high UK price neither better or worse than expected.

	I had a similar problem with an 85/2 944.

	Cleaning the connections to the Auxiliary Air Valve seemed to do the

Subject: Aviation Gas

The optimization pf fuels is done to meet operating conditions.  Aviation
gas is optimized so that it won't boil at high altitude.  It works in
a cold engine becuase the dual magneto ignition has a very hot spark
at starting.

Automotive gas contains highly volatile compounds (varied by season)
that help cold starting.  The FAA worries a lot about whether this
might boil at altitude and has generally not allowed it to be used
for aviation even where it has high enough octane.

Yes, higher octane has a slower flame front.  That is basically what
octane does.  This can cause problems if it gets too slow.

Recommendation forget running avgas in your car.  Forget jet fuel as
well unless you have a deisel.

I just traded in my 82 911SC for a 86 911 Carerra.  Sometimes (happens 
more when the engine is cold) after starting the engine idle "bounces" 
between 1500 and 6000 rpm, up and down for about 5 seconds till it smoots 
outs.  After it smooths to 950 or so it's usually fine, although 
sometimes this happens once or twice more before the idle stays where it

        It's something like a long, long-handled Allen wrench.  Sorta.
Has a T- or loop-shaped handle at the top.  Available at AutoMashin',
for the usual rates, and other places.  Locally, Bugformance in Sunny-

large chain auto-parts stores would as well.

Subject: The Smoking Method + 914 stub axle

          Regarding the smoking method offered as a way to find vacuum
          leaks:

          I have used the method for several years now and have had
          great success.  I got hooked on the method when a bunch of
          the members of my car club showed me what a cool method it
          was, and hey, I really wanted to fit in with these guys! 
          The only problems I have had are minor:  the engine vacuum
          hoses can get a rather unpleasant smell and a coating of tar
          and nicotine, so I use menthol lights; I also occasionally
          get a slight engine cough, but I'm sure it is related to
          some other fuel injection problem, not the smokes.  I have
          heard from some folks that this smoke method can lead to
          serious problems down the road, but I have a pretty new car
          (so why worry) and also my Grandpa has used this method all
          his life and had no problems... well, except for needing a
          head replacement and a rebuilt carb. 

          BTW, the article didn't discuss how to seal the leaks once
          they are found -- the obvious choice to me is to use a
          nicotine patch.  Seals it right up and even seems to make
          the engine a bit peppier!
          (Sorry gang... someone had to do it....)

          Now, P-phile stuff.  I still can't get the stub axle out. 
          Someone must have a magic method (involving no smoke). 
          Please help!

Subject: "87" 944 handling & sway bars


My 944 came stock with 21.5 mm bar up front and none in the rear.  I added
a 14mm to the rear.  After playing around with the tire pressures 34psi front
and rear with A008P's it still understeers just a tad but I am satisfied.

My dad and I switched cars this week.  He has an "87" 928.  It really corners
flat and feels like it can generate more grip with Dunlop SP 4000's a Z rated
all season.  Although I've yet to slide the 928 to see exactly where the limit
is, it feels better.  I'm guessing it has to do with stiffer roll bars?
I'm thinking that I might like to go to stiffer bars front and rear on mine
but don't know if it will be a waste of money.  I've always heard "loose is
fast" and I know that the stiffer the rolls bars get, you move further 
away from a true independent supension and you don't do as well around
a bumpy turn.  My car has a lot of body roll compared to the 928.

Has anyone put the 25.4 mm hollow bar up front and 18 in the rear on an 
otherwise stock supension "87" 944?  

What are the trade-offs?

George do you have a set and how much?

Subject: F.A. Porsche-signature Boat

In the June/July, 1989, issue of Boating Product News, there is an article by
Mindy Leaf describing a soon-to-be-introduced Porsche Design speedboat.  It
is a 27-footer, powered by a marine version of the 302 c.i.d 928 S4 engine
with U.S. Marine Jet's Dominator water-jet drive.  Kineo, U.S.A., Ltd.
planned to produce the boat at Tempest Yachts on North Miami Beach's famed
powerboat row.  Testing of the prototype was apparently underway at the time
the article was written, and was being conducted at U.S. Marine Jet's
Dominator plant in Hugo, Oklahoma.

Performance figures included 0-50 in about 10 seconds, planing speed attained
in less than 3 seconds, and a top speed of 60 mph.  The water-jet drive
(unusual on a boat this size) supposedly allowed "sports-car-type handling
ease," while the engine "boasts half the weight and twice the fuel efficiency
of standard cast-iron engines".  The hull was a deep-vee, hand-laid
fiberglass. with a windshield that swept around the cockpit.  Seating was for
four (with flip-up seats for standing).  There was a set-in transom door and
retractable swim platform.  Below decks, a double lounge finished in leather
covered the portable head.  Introduced in silver with bright yellow
upholstery, a variety of colors to match Porsche cars was to follow.

The boat was to be furnished with a "super-sleek Porsche Design trailer
having built-in spare tire and tool box".  The combination - boat and trailer
 - was to be offered only through select Porsche dealers (required to purchase
a minimum of five boats), with special deals to be offered on
car-boat-trailer packages. It was to debut in early fall, 1989.

A photograph accompanied the article.

Anyone ever actually see this interesting new venture by Porsche Design?

"Hunting" between 800 and 1200 RPM on a 3.2 Carrera
on cold start is normal. There seems to be a direct
relationship between the ambient temp and the period
of hunting. The DME is fiddling with the mixture
but cuts back the full rich in a not very progressive manner
I suppose. The 1500 to 6000 RPM hunting Armand reported is 
grossly abnormal and needs fixing. In fact 6000 RPM on 
a stone cold engine is not a Good Thing at all
and may result in accelerated wear.

  What type of plate in Germany was used on a 66? I would like one on the

Which one is correct for aforementioned year? Where can I get one? Oh yea,

Subject: PCR's

        Just got the Parade packet yesterday.  Spent most of the evening
reading it (instead of working on my engine--oops!).
        So, is anyone from the Parade Rules Committee (whatever) online
here so's I can bitch and moan about the Parade Competition Rules (PCR's)?
        Three levels of "preparedness": Production, Improved, Modified.
Free in Production are:  Springs/torsion bars, sway bars, spring plates,
exhaust after the head (no open exhaust), any DOT tire, wet-sump oil traps
and deep sumps, oil coolers, etc.  Okay, I figured I wasn't going to be
competitive--my car is box-stock (except that oil trap).  However, a tire
with a circumference of less than 74.25" bumps me up into Improved, where
LSD's, up to 120 cc displacement, flares, extra-wide tires, etc, etc, etc,
are allowed!
        Sanity and Math check, please:
74.25" circumference / pi = 23.635" diameter - 15" rim = 8.635" sidewall
(total) / 2 sidewalls per diameter = 4.317" sidewall * 25.4 mm/in =
109.658 mm sidewall.  110 mm sidewall is a 205/55-15, a 195/60-15, a
175/60-15, a 175/65-15, etc...  Ouch.  You mean I gotta go back to the
60-series?  That's depressing!  Oh well, maybe I'll just be the slowest
car in I1.  Only 1 point in the C column--tires 2" too small.  Sigh.
        Piss and moan, bitch and whine.
        Oh, the tire sizes are pretty similar for most of you pre-SC 911
folks as well!  And maybe even 356'es...
        So, does anyone have a set of four 205/55-15 BFG R1's or 008 RS's
+ rims (4-bolt) they want to lend/rent me for Parade?  Even 195/60's!
        Class, schmass!  I'll just get out there and RUN!

I think G.'s got it right -- it was the 318, which later went on to become a
rover engine and became the powerplant of the TR-8 (nasty little car).  A

        I doubt that.  I now know that I can bench-press a 914/4 engine
(without induction, flywheel, fan, etc.) if I have a spotter!  I don't
think I could lift *any* V8.  Remember, most of the 914 engine is made

Subject: 356 Wanted- Assistance Needed

I've been searching for an original very nice to Mint condition 356 . I would
like to end up with a T-6 body  coupe( sunroof preferred) or a cab.
Matching numbers are important to me.

 I would appreciate any leads on an original or restored to original 356 on a
rust and accident free body, maybe with some history.

I know that searching for such a car requires lots of patience mixed in with
the luck of being at the right place at the right time. I have had numerous
fellow porschphilers contact me with suggestions and some leads, for this I
am very appreciative. However, as you can tell, I haven't found a car as yet.

Thanks in advance.

Think again.  Nate is correct, the engine started in 1962 with the Buick
Wildcat, and continued with GM until 1964 where is was turbocharged in some
models.  GM then sold the design and equipment to Rover Group, who used it 
first in the 3500 sedan (from the displacement of 3.5 litres) then in the
TR-8, and finally in a series of supercar like TVR's and the Range Rover.

Today it is still available in 3.9l, 4.2l and 4.5l versions.

It started out as that all aluminum 215 inch however.  There is a 318 cu in
V8 out there, but it is made by Chrysler, this is the venerable 5.2l iron
block that has been around for almost as long as there have been Dodge
Powerwagons.

rick old chum lotsa airplanes use auto fuel legally.  in fact,

        73 was the first year for the sideshifter.  But a number of people
have upgraded earlier cars.  Also for some interior improvements--window
winders, for one.
        73 or 74 2.0 are the "best" ones.  But, of course, everyone knows
that so they're more expensive.  75 and 76 had extra smog crap on them
which reduced power and (possibly) engine life.  They also have the 5 MPH
bumpers which add a pretty fair amount of weight out at the ends of the
car, which is kinda where you don't want it.  It won't turn quite as nice-
ly, but it will tend to be a bit more stable, so....
        A non-California-emissions 73 1.7L could be nice as well.  A little
less power than the 75-76 2.0, but lighter.  Has the side-shifter and the
other interior impovements.  Avoid the CA edition 1.7, low compression
really robs it of power--it's weaker than the 1.8s...
        72 has the adjustable passenger seat (no more footrest!) and some
other interior improvements, with the tail-shifter and 1.7L motor.
        If you can find one with a front through-the-body swaybar, that's
good for handling.  The factory bar usually came with the rear bar and the
forged Fuchs wheels.  Alloy wheels are light and look nice.  Center con-
sole, vynil rollbar trim and chrome bumpers are (mostly) for looks.
        Here in the Bay Area, you can generally find *very* nice early
2.0s for $5K or less.  $3500 is not uncommon for good examples, but you
do have to look pretty hard.  Generally less for other 914s, except of
course for Sixes.  Up to $10K (asking) for total concours queens.

Subject: Buicks of many alloys


ALright! Now we have a thread on Pubic Roadbastards. 

FYI, the Buick aluminum V-8 weighs in at 320 pounds, a lot more than a 
type IV 4-cylinder. But almost the same for a 911 6. 

The Buick can be enlarged to 4.5 liters in the aluminum form. In Iron
form, it can be had up to 340 cu in. (5.51l) with 300 inches being the 
most common size. 

Rover bought the Buick variation for use in 1965. The Olds version 
weighs more, but Brabham used a variant to win the first year of the 
3.0l F-1 championship (1966).

Kennedy Engineering makes all the parts for a sano conversion using 
either the alloy Buick V-8 or the devilish V-6 presently still being 
made. Think of a Grand National Buick Turbo V-6 in your 914. 

I prefer the 6 cylinders built at Porsche AG myself. (BIG Grin)

Subject: Early 911 license plates

Fred Hess asked about German license plate dimensions.

There are basically three dimensions: 200 x 340 mm, and 110 x 520 mm,
depending on whether you get two or one line of text. There is also a third
size, made just to fit American cars which are licensed in Germany (GIs
abandoning their Camaros etc.) Motorcycles and such obviously use a different
size standard.

Oval plates are not German license plates. They are export plates, intended
for cars bought for temporary use in Europe only before being exported. Oval
plates cannot legally be used by German nationals living in Germany, as this
is effectively (road) tax evasion. Oval plates are good for one year only, 6
months per country max, and cannot be renewed. Other German plates are good
as long as the car remains in the registration area. If it is sold and
re-registered in another town, it gets new plates. The first two letters
indicate what town. S is Stuttgart, LB is Ludwigsburg, M is Munich, GG is
Gross-Gerau, HB is Heilbronn, BB is Boeblingen, etc.

The new export plates are no longer oval, they are the long single-text-line
rectangular size with a red area on the left side.

    Oh really?  I always thought a 215 was a 215 was a 215... well,
scratch what I said about the motor in junkyard, it was in an old f-85
Convertible, so obviously it's not a buick motor.  I would have bought
the whole car, had it not been stored outside for far to many years

My brother's got a TR-8.  You're right, it's an "amazing" car.  He's the one who

Interesting sidelight - TR-7s are considered "sports cars" by his insurance company.
TR-8s (same car, bigger engine) are not.  Go figger.

ObPorsche:  All this talk about 944 temperatures going up in traffic, then the fan
come on, the temperature drops, and the fan go off has me confused.  Isn't that how 
it's supposed to work?  Mine always has.  Driving at speed, the temp stays in the lower 
1/3 of the gauge, but in traffic on a hot day it will climb, and the fan will come on.  
That's why it's there.  As long as the fan can bring the temp down, I don't see
the problem.  Am I missing something here?

By the way, that's a rhetorical question.  I'll be gone until tuesday, so If anyone

Tweeks in Indiana has 'um (or at least they did a few weeks ago when I bought

Along those same lines, I need a left rear lens . . . the real NOS deep red 
one, not the cheap, orange-red imitation everyone seems to have these days. 
 
By the way, I found out yesterday that Lukes & Shoreman still has some of the

They're asking $60 per set.

Subject: Alternative tire choices

Many of us have been caught spending big money for name-brand tires, only 
to find out that they are less than satisfactory.  They may handle like 
rails at first, but after a few hundred miles, they get loose.  Then 
10,000 miles later, they are as bald as Kojak.  Well, here are some tires 
that could change that.  I have no steak in this company, I have just had 
good luck with their tires, and would hope that you would too, if you try 
them.  

	COOPER Tires

1. COOPER Cobra VR50

	-V rated for speeds up to 149 mph.
	-Directional tread expels water effectively for excellent wet traction
	-Black serrated lettering style compliments today's sleek performance
	 cars.

2. COOPER Cobra GTV

	-V speed rated for up to 149 mph.
	-Non-directional tread
	-Designed and built to meet the challenge of performance tire demands.
	 Uniquely constructed to deliver excellent vehicle braking and
	 cornering control.  Strong traction during acceleration.
	-2+2+2 Construction : High-strength nylon overwraps under the tread
	 to provide additional support for the steel belts for excellent
	 tire handling.

3. COOPER Cobra GTH

	-H speed rated for speeds up to 130 mph.
	-Computerized block tread design channels water quickly to help
	 prevent traction loss.
	-Raised black letters enhance the appearance of the stylish
	 black performance sidewall.

4. COOPER Cobra GTS

	-S speed rated for speeds up to 112 mph.
	-Aggressive block tread offers excellent traction and low noise
	 levels for a smooth quiet ride.
	-Raised white-letter sidewalls match today's excitement cars.


I have used the Cobra GTH tires myself, and they beat the hell out of the 
Pirelli P6's I had before.  They handled better in wet and dry, they ran 
quieter, and they lasted longer.


                           
                                       Good Luck!

The tool you require is a 3mm allen wrench. If you are intending to adjust a 911
the long tools seen in the catalogues are probably too long. My T handle wrench 
was too long for both my 930 and an 83 sc as it fouled the bodywork on trying to
insert it but the regular L shape worked fine.

DO NOT FORGET to remove the tool from the CIS before revving the engine as I am 
told that could be quite an expensive mistake!

I have an '81 Rabbit and went to Sears and bought a T-handle allen wrench

Just remember to take the tool out before you rev the engine to settle the

Subject: 944T Compression?

Hello out there,
 I've been reading the list for a few days now, and REALLY wish I had
discovered it prior to my most recent Porsche purchase. I've learned a
lot and I think my '88 944Turbo has a blown head gasket and I would
like comfermation before undertaking a repair. The symtoms are as
follows.
1. Slow coolant leak, .5 gal/1000 miles
2. Commpression #1-135, #2-113, #3-136, #4-141
3. yellowish gunk on the inside of the oil filler cap

The car is driven daily and gets to full operating temp. It has 56k
miles and has seen some track work.
What is the expected commpression? The #2 appears low.


How do you turn the motor over to TDC, I would like to do a leak down
test. Ever other car I've had you had easy access to the crank pully

bolt, not in this guy.
Speaking of leak down testing, I saw a message that that said his 944
had 6-8%, is this real? I've done a few checks and never seen any this
low, more like 25-35% for street and 10-12% on my ITC care.
TIA,

AVOID the '75 and '76? The common factor I've heard is, when buying a 
Porsche, always buy as new as you can afford.

The obvious differences...
A '70s has a non-movable passenger seat...
Fuel pump right by the motor (hello, vapor lock!)...
IMHO ugly, stubby bumpers.
4.5" wide wheels!

And plenty of other stuff. The later ones are much nicer, have the 
side-shift tranny, better FI (L-jetronic vs D-jetronic), the best-looking 
bumpers (again, IMHO, though it DOES weigh more - but then again, it's 
safer, too), fuel pump in the front trunk, where it belongs... IMHO, nicer 
interior vinyls... And so on.

Oh, BTW, side-shift came in at '73, as I recall - the fuel pump in front 
trunk came into being in '75.

   I was surprised to find out that the EPA does NOT test wide-open throttle
  operation; this is why even aftermarket Superchargers or Nitrous Oxide
  injection are able to get CARB certification and be fully street legal !

   Restrictions that hurt top horsepower may be in the catalytic converters,
  but most the direction there has been to get quicker operation (eg., by
  pre-heating the cat). Emmissions controls work best now at warm, light
  cruise and idle; cold operation and startup are targets of better control,
  but top end performance isn't restricted by the EPA at all, and the factory
  tunes the system for best reliable performance.

   In thge 70's smog requirements could be blamed for a bunch of ills. But
  because of the EFI technology forced by the smog laws, we've also benefited
  with much better driving, more powerful cars than we ever got from big
  carbs and lots of cubic inches.

Only the California cars had the smog stuff!!!

The 914s for the rest of the country had a straight pass-through where the 
cat would go, and my 914 carries the '73-'74 style exhaust. (Someone before 
had done it - I ended up replacing my exhaust bit at a time (muffler, THEN 
heat exchangers) so it's still that style. Works fine, though I had to pull 
back the rear valence a tiny bit - it was rubbing against the Bursch 
muffler, which was making a damn annoying squeaking noise.

Richard:

Sorry, no seats that I can part with.

The Factory Spec Book says that 914's weigh 2139 # (curb), but it doesn't
specify which model.  Early sales brochures rate the car at 1982#, but I
assume that's dry.

Whatever, your car will weigh differently, depending on optional equipment
(air cond?).  It probably has 22 years worth of crud built up on the belly,
plus any rustproofing that may have been applied in the US.

951 cat pipe - used ones tend to be rusty, the heat seems to wear them

long time, I just don't know where to get them - cat pipes don't really
make a seat of the pants difference in power; just spools up the turbo a
little faster; neat time to create power-sapping exhaust leaks too; of
course it's good to remove the cat if you are tracking a chipped car and
want to avoid melting down the $1200 original.

Subject: 911 Driving (long again)

Thanks for all the positive E-mail on my explanation of driving a 911 at
Sebring.

One question asked was how I could go into a corner while under braking
without the rear spinning around.  Exactamundo!  I went into the corner WHILE
under braking.  Remember that we are working with the laws of physics.  In
the following example I am ignoring the front end of the car, but suffice to
say that it will respond opposite to the rear.

When you step on the brakes, the rear of the car will rise and after one
oscillation (thank G*D for sport shocks) settle at a new level.  It will stay
at this new level until you do something different....like lift off of the
brakes.  While the rear is rising, it will unload the tires, and make the car
very unstable.  If you should turn in while the rear is rising, you will most
assuredly spin.  Once the rear has risen to it's new level, it will once again
 place SOME weight, on the rear tires.  It is at this point that you can
GENTLY turn in to the corner.  The car will be stable, but the limiting
factor to your cornering power in the turn will definately be the grip of the
rear tires.  The more you slow down, the tighter the arc your car can take,
the more you can turn in.  Sounds perfect for that decreasing radius turn,
doesn't it.

Now you can shift to the gas.  As you lift off the brakes, the rear will
drop, increasing the weight on the rear tires, correspondingly increasing
their grip.  If the rear of the car is getting loose at all, once you lift
off the brakes, it will immediately hook up.  Now is the time to get on the
gas and accelerate out of the turn.  Now, even under full throttle, the rear
tires will be heavily loaded and develop all kinds of grip to handle all that
horsepower.  The rear will stay planted, unless you do something to disturb
all that grip, like LIFT, or tighten the steering!  Once again, it will be
spin city.  This is why you want to drive the proper line, so that you can
accelerate all of the way out of the corner.

I have found this technique to work well in large decreasing radius turns,
like turn 17 at Sebring, and Big Bend at Lime Rock.  The line that you
choose, either single apex or double apex, is up to you and your car.  Every
car will be different.  I like to set up mine with some understeer, so that I
can do more trailbraking.  Cars that are setup to oversteer will be much more
sensitive, and difficult, to drive in this fashion.

If any of you out there are finding this helpful, let me know and I will
continue.  See you on the track!

Subject: experimental brakes and ABS

Need some net wisdom;
I am doing some R&D for a brake company that is just getting into racing
brake pads. I used these pads for the first time at Sebring with good but not
great success. They stopped great with poor durability. I just got the pads
back to the engineer in charge of this project and the results are that I was
"frying" the front brakes and getting virtually no wear in the rears. This in
itself is not unusual for my car (an 89 944Turbo). What is unusual is it
seemed to be worse with these pads than any others I had used.
We discussed it for awhile before I mentioned that my rear tires were
different this year, being 275 x 40 x 17's. I have 245 x 45 x 16 in the
front. The rears are now taller than the front so obviously the rears are
doing less revolutions per mile than the fronts.
The engineer thought that I was screwing up the ABS by having this
arrangement since the ABS expects all tires to be going the same RPM's. He
suspects that the ABS was feeding more braking force to the fronts since they
were going faster than the rears.
I am at a loss as to how the ABS would compensate for this and even whether
this is a plausible explanation for the brake wear. BTW at the time of
Sebring the stock proportioning valve was in place.
I would appreciate any input.

either go for larger torsion bars or an adjustable rear bar from a 968

everything drives just perfectly!  BTW, I haven't lowered the suspension,

Since I have a 75 I can speak with authority.  Don't buy one, especially if you
live in CA.  The smog stuff on a 75 is a real nightmare.  The air-injector 
nozzles strip out, the one-way valve on the air pump manifold goes out and the 
air pumps die from moisture.  The cars won't pass smog tests without a fully
functional air pump system.  I have owned my 75 since 78, and to be honest, its
just my road warrior.  With the exception of an immaculate concours 75/76 or
a special model (1st or last car!) it is best to stick with the 73/74 for best
overall features and value.  The earlier models can be fun, especially if you 
can get a 914/6 (project car).

Hi Mark,

I've bought H4's from J.C. Whitney and pretty much found that you got 
what you paid for.  The first time I received raydots (French Mfg).  The 
second time it was Carillo's (Italian Mfg)  They were essentially 
replacement shells that held H4 bulbs.  They worked fine.  There has been 
a thread on here about DOT approved H4's.  I think that they were 
approved because the shell was a vacuum sealed unit that held H4 bulbs 
that are replaceable. I personally don't think much of the DOT approval 
because the spec was written in 1939 when some cars still used silver 
plated headlight reflectors.  They needed to be sealed to keep from 
tarnishing and not reflecting the light.

Subject: PCR's

Dave;

    This must be your first Parade, as you seem astonished by the PCR's as it
relates to tire size.  Unfortuneately these circumferance rules were written
back when tires were hard as stones and a lower profile tire gave a
tremendous advantage, nowadays lower profile is not the "big" advantage it
used to be.. To show you how absurd this rule is, at a Parade a number of
years ago, 6 cars were successfully protested for having undersized "front"
tires. If you keep reading the rules you will find some other strange
requirements, but if you are building a car for Parade autocrossing,  working
with the PCR's is the way to go  to gain an advantage.

Yes, this is the engine now used in the Range Rover, Morgan, TVR etc. bored
out to 3.9 and 4.2 litres, and now high pressure die cast, not low pressure
as built by GM. Apparently GM has several time tried to re-purchase the
rights to this engine, which has been a great success since 1968 in Britain.
Now that BMW owns it, perhaps we will see a new 215 ci V8 sports car (Z1?)

As a new owner of a 1990 911 C4, I am seeking out the cheapest shop

Automotion sells them for $330 (their salesman said they have to buy them

Is their a cheaper set available?  Anyone have a used set they want to

Subject: 944 thermostat, what failure?

Hi,

Sorry to bring up a recent subject again, but I did not quite
understand what failure some of you pphiles were mentioning about.

My 85.5 944 engine runs with the temp gauge in the lower part of the 
scale at highway speeds. In city traffic, temp gauge regularly passes
the line that seperates middle and upper parts of it just a bit. At this
point, the fan comes on which brings the temp back to the middle part.
The owner manual says the middle part of the scale is where the engine
is supposed to run.

I think a few of you mentioned the same behaviour previously.
So, where is the failure or is there any failure?

Thanks.

Armagan.

Just thought I'd let everyone know that the mechanic found that the guide
that holds the chain between the two cam's under the valve covers
broke...therefore the chain slipped..therefore the timing belt stripped. 
He's never heard of that happening before.  Has anyone else?  This is not
supposed to be a normal maintenance item.  

Also, it was pointed out to me that I should've attributed where I got the
info I posted in the summary message.  Sorry about that.  Next time I'll do
a bit better job of tracking which people the info came from.

Subject: What does Porsche *mean*?

LG asks, what does Porsche *mean* to people?  I agree with the meaning of
Corvettes of any vintage.  Based on the reaction of people to my
deceptively-new-looking 1983 944, to most folks it seems to be like this:

"Porsche is God's way of saying you have too much money."

Actually, I have found that owning one helps alleviate any problems of too
much money!

My next question is, what does Camaro mean?

Subject: Dealership Visit


Lacking any real (billable, that is) work to do late last week, I was in transit to a golf course when I realized that I 
was in the neighborhood of the friendly dealership (Town North Porsche in Dallas; no relation other than 
the one detailed herein) which sold me my 911+17 (my pronunciation <g>).

I stopped in and chatted at length with John, the Assistant Sales Manager. We talked about and he provided me 
with the new little 911 book, which includes specs for the '96 Turbo... For those of you who don't yet have this 
little book, get one... 400hp, 0-60 in 4.4 seconds. Very nice pictures of the whole 928-17 line.

We also discussed, in hushed and reverent tones, the end of 928 production. My dream of someday buying a new 
928 has now ended. In his words, "all the cars that are going to be built, are built". What's on the showroom floor 
is all she wrote. A moment of silence, please. (I apologize if the rest of the list has known this for years now, but I 
just learned it and I'm still not right. Come to think of it, I wasn't right before...).

We also discussed 986's. The dealership is essentially taking $928+$72 deposits to get your name on a list. When 
the final specs and prices are available, you can either put the grand torward the car or take it back. Costs a 
kilobuck to play the Boxter game. He indicated they had not yet thought about ordering one for showroom stock 
so that I could drive it.

Having just recently divested myself of my only weekend warrior car (Shelby GLHS), I told John that I was 
interested in a late 80's 911. He's given me a lead to follow on a trade-in he sold to a gent who has just now 
realized that he has a family and can't fit them in the car he bought. If I don't decide to take this one and it looks 
good, I'll pass the info on to the list.

That's my .02 worth for this week. Have a good one... I do! (My Porsche, you sickos!)

From: qmoolla@gpu3.srv.ualberta.ca (Qassim Moolla)
Subject: Lack of power/1987 944 S

SYMPTOMS:
My 1987 944 S appears to drive better on some days than others.  Overall it 
does not respond as quickly to accelerator input as my 1984 944.  The car 
seems to run out of steam at about 3750-4000 RPM.  The power output after 
this RPM range feels like it is somehow restricted.  This is especially 
noticeable in the lower gears (first & second).  Lots of RPM drama but not 
much corresponding forward motion. My impression, which is subjective at 
best, is that on not so good days there is slightly more vibration at this 
RPM level at the gearshift.  Another subjective impression is that there is 
a lack of air going through the system - I can't tell whether it's at the 
exhaust or somewhere before this point. There is also a slight but 
discernable miss at idle (more so on bad days) which I have been unable to 
cure thus far.
CHECKS & FIXES THUS FAR:
1) Tune-up with new WR7DC plugs (pulled the WR7DP plugs since I was told 
that they are prone to miss at higher RPMs).
2) Checked compression which is 164 lbs with no deviation between cylinders.
3) Replaced all plug wires with OEM Beru set, complete with connectors.
4) Replaced distributor cap and rotor.
5) Replaced cam/timing and balance shaft belts, complete with all rollers 
and tensioner which appeared to have been tampered with by previous 
owner/mechanic.
6) Checked coil according to Haynes-  secondary resistance checks out.
7) Had exhaust system checked out- cats out and muffler's clear, so no 
restrictions.
8) Tried to check the airflow meter but could only measure the resistance 
between the two outer terminals (1500 ohms approx).  The sensor check 
involves measuring the voltage across terminals 7 and ground (should be 
150-250 millivolts) I don't know which is terminal 7 since the connector 
says 4 3 2 1 from front of car to back.  Similarly, I cant tell which is 
terminal 9 (to measure voltage between it and ground with ignition in "on" 
position)  to check operation of sensor. Sensor however does not bind 
anwhere along it's travel from pushing it back and forth through the airbox.
9) My mechanic checked out the injectors and "O" rings, they check out fine. 
(I was told they fire OK) The fuel pressure is also OK. I also used ventil 
sauber over three tanks of gas to help clean out the valves and techron 
between fills to help clean the injectors. 
10) The fuel filter was replaced as well as the air filter.
11) I have not been able to find any leaks in the vacuum system but that 
does not mean I have looked in all the correct places.
12) I have not checked the throttle switch or speed sensor cause I don't 
know how.
DIAGNOSIS
I am no closer to solving this problem now, then when I started, so I am 
willing to listen to any suggestions from the list. (including the obvious)
Thanks.

Hi, Sanjay,

Sorry to say, this is a fairly common problem.

I get a lot of calls from around the country looking for used heads and cams
for 944S cars, due to this very thing happening.

And, no, I don't have anything to help you...

Sorry about your misfortune. Good luck with your mechanic...

Connecticut.  This event is unique in that there is a limit of 60
cars, allowing each driver at least two hours of track time during the
day, and has been a favorite among serious track junkies in the
Northeast.

The fee is $75. Your Porsche, PCA membership, a pre-track tech
inspection, a Snell 85 helmet, and a desire for safe, serious fun are
all that is required.

If you would like an application for the event, please email me your
snail-mail address and I will forward one to you.

Subject: Tires for a 993

Greeting Fellow P-philes,

Apparently, I've gotten "on it" a few times and my rear tires need replacement
 (the fronts look new!).  They're Dunlop SP-8000 255/40ZR17 (Porsche "NO"
spec).  Dunlop says they have none in the US and won't have any for about
another month. This has been going on since late February. Anybody else had
this kind of problem? Anbody got any ideas. I'm down to about an 1/8 of an
inch at 9500 miles...

They're great tires. Superb in both dry AND wet roads. I'd like to stick with
them. Shame you can't buy 'em without a new 993 attached to them <g>.

Thanks for your suggestions

I understand, what I meant was would there be an improvement if, say you 
used a 1994 engine computer for a 964 Carrera 2 in a 1990 964 Carrera 2.

I know about the increase in displacement, but I meant within the generation
from model year to model year, e.g. compare 1990 964 Carrera 2 with 1994 
964 Carrera 2.

I see. That's what they did with the 911 Turbo 3.6, I believe. I wonder 
if the upcoming 993 twin turbo actually produces "only" 408 hp. More?

Subject: Porsche HP Question


Hiya!

I think we've all heard that Porsche's claimed HP rating on any vechicle 
is always underrated.  Some people say that it is way under (10-20%) the 
actual amount while others only claim they drop 5-7HP of the rated 
amount.

Does anyone have a rule of tumb or acutal % that porsche trims off the 
actual output?

Do they do this with FT/LBS. as well?

 -How many HP's did my 86 911 pump out when new? (Grey Market)

 -Was it 217 as the manual states or really 217.1?

 -Was is Professor Plub in the garage with the rubber centered clutch disc?  

Seriously, I'd really be interested if anyone had any real data on true 
HP ratings.

Thanks!

Just a note that Dan is talking about 2.0L engines here.  The 1.8's do not have
all the air injection stuff.  They do have an EGR valve.  On the negative side,
the 1.8's have about 20 less horsepower than the 2.0's.

I've had H-4's that I ordered from Whitney about 5 years ago in my '72 T,
and they work fine.  Some off-brand (Bigie, I think -- cute, huh?).  If

Subject: Re: Patching track tires

OK
Now you'll hear a horror story. I too tried to patch a track tire. It was a
virtually brand new BFG R1. It also had a screw in the tread, nowhere near
the sidewall. I first plugged it and then filled of the plug flush with the
inside. We then patched the area, obviously from the inside. It was fine for
one run group. The second time out I was doing about 130 at Pocono around one
of the banked corners. The car became suddenly "uncomfortable" and then
downright squirmy. I gently got out of the throttle and started to coast down
when the rear started oscillating all over the place (it was a rear tire). I
limped back to the pits where the tire was just about flat.
The moral is don't do it. You're life and maybe others is at stake. Bite the
bullet and replace the tire. Maybe use it for the street or autoX. If you
sell it you have an obvious moral obligation.
Just say NO to patched tires.
Take it from someone who will NEVER do that again!

Subject: How to get P-car's history?

I have just purchased a 1990 Porsche and I am interested in the "history" 
of the car.  I've read other messages posted to p-phils that seemed to 
indicate you can get PCNA to do a (?free?) history check.  Is this true?

In particular, I'm interested in previous owners, recall work done on the 
car, etc?

I have a pretty good idea from the records and talking with previous 
owner - but I was just wondering what is out there.

I'm also a Porsche Club of America member. Do they have any such service?

I agree with Jerry - patch only for autox and street.  I have patched
a number of BFG's for autox use and never had a problem with either
the patch or the tire failing.

As always, YMMV.

Subject: Re: What's the best year for a 914?

> better FI (L-jetronic vs D-jetronic),

        BZZT!  Thank you for playing.  Only the US-spec 1.8L cars
had the L-jetronic FI.  74 and 75.  Both were low-compression cars,
the 75 had cat and/or EGR, neither one had much power.  And whether
or not the L-jet *on the 914* is better than the D-jet is *entirely*
a matter of personal opinion.  I got tired of not finding the vac-
cuum leak in my 1.8 which is/was making the engine burn itself up.
L-jet is also inferior at high RPMs (above about 4,000) because it
is not designed to effectively measure loads up there.
        I am not sure I believe that 49-state 75 & 76 cars had no
cat, but even if they didn't they still had the more restrictive
exhaust system which robs them of power and heats up the engines
more, this robbing them of lifespan.

> fuel pump in the front trunk, where it belongs...

        My apologies for forgetting the fuel pump.  That really,
*really* is important.  (this is *NOT* sarcasm)  Vapor lock is one
of the more annoying traits the 914s have.
        The wheels were only an issue on the earliest cars, and not
all of them.  I have personally not yet run across a car with the
skinny wheels.  The 73 2.0 came with 5.5" Fuchs alloys, and in 74+
(or earlier?) all the wheels were 5.5", even the steelies.
        All the other stuff is opinion.  And, of course, you can
make any 914 into any other, given money and effort.  You can back-
date/update the exhaust, the seats, the fuel pump...  Of the three,
the exhaust (for a 2.0) is by far the most expensive.  (Does it re-
quire 73-74 heads???  Dunno.)  I hope that Jay's brother can tell
whether or not he likes the chrome/painted bumper or the big plastic
one, whether or not he can live with the non-adjustable seat, and
most of the other "opinion" stuff.

Subject: Early 911 MFI

I am a big fan of the early 911 MFI.  

If you fancy (or own)  a MFI car, and you do not know the history of the
system, then you had better start to budget for a MFI rebuild ($1,200 US
tops).

If the MFI pump works properly, a 911 will start easily and quickly every
time. The procedure in the owner's mannual should be followed. This ritual
has also been documented in the sports car press (Dennis Jenkins - Motor
Sport Feb,1970 - may have written the best contemporary account of how to
start a MFI 911). If this procedure must be modified, then you can bet the
system has a problem. Most of the time starting is very easy with a tired
unit because the mixture is getting richer and richer.  Foulded plugs that
clean up right way  after a bit of time above 5,000 rpm could be a sign of
trouble in  cars with electronic ignitions systems.

When it works well, the MFI does have all the advantages claimed in the
recent discussion. It is better than carburation. 

This type of unit was once state-of-the-art technology for German racing cars
in the 1960s.  A similar unit is found on the  BMW 2002ti for instance.

When the pumps get old and tired they get impossibly rich. This condition
does not enhance the lubrication of your engine.  

When they are poorly maintained (misadjucted or miscalibrated, worn out or
just broken) they are very unpleasant.

There are skilled technicians (uh... make that skilled mechanics... this is a
1970-72 car after all!!) who can make a MFI 911 run really well. This happens
to be expensive because the the people who really know how to maintain these
fuel systems are worth every penny they charge.

My car starts the same way on a hot August morning as it does on a chilly
November morning. This winter it sat in a dry garage for six weeks and
started right up. The batteries were a tad flat, but it fired right up. 

The accerleration in a MFI car seems to be instantaneous regards less of the
conditions. After about 3500 rpm the engine really takes off with a steady
and strong pull until at least 6,300 rpm. The noise is wonderful (and very
loud!).

I understand the cost of a proper carb set up and a MFI fuel system rebuild
is about the same. Your car's Federal Emission Certification remains intact
if the fuel system is original. While many carb conversions have been done
and done well, I cannot recommend it.

Many P-files have excess to the proper equiptment to mantain these units
themselves. They are very well documented. This is much less expensive and a
great deal of fun for some lucky people. Others, like myself  :<(  , have to
rely on professionals who care about these cars.

Flame away!!! and
Enjoy

Bill,

Well explained and written, Bill.  Like most questions of this nature, these
things come down to ORGINALITY versus COST and in some case PRACTICALLITY.
 If you want to go faster in an older car there are any number of bastardized
things you can do to it-some will actually improve performance, others may or
may not.  

It really is also a matter of values and one's goal.  Being a originality
freak, I wouldn't even consider modifying a street car Porsche while a
dedicated race car is entirely another thing.
If you own an essentially valueless car, it really doesn't matter what you do
to it.  On the other hand the MFI cars, for example, are more collectable and
I, for one, would think really hard before I mucked on up.  Just compare the
actual selling prices of stock S's versus a converted turbo-look S with
webbers and dice hanging from the mirror.

Subject: 944 Thermostat & Electrical

		
Re: Thermostat. I am new the "PPhiles" and by no means an expert on the 944 
cooling system but I have just completed reconditioning my 87 944S cooling 
system and am passing along what I have learned. My understanding of how the 
system works is that; as the temp.increases to beyond normal operating temp. 
two things happen 1) the thermostat opens and 2) the cooling fans come on. 
Both of these events work to reduce temp. When the temp. gauge indicator 
registers in the higher range, approaching the "high normal" temp. mark, the 
thermostat will open and the fans will come on and the indicator needle will 
drop to, or close to the "low normal" mark. This cycle will continue until 
something occurs to interupt the cycle. If you do not get "gauge confirmation" 
that the system is cycling then there may be a problem with the gauge.

Re: Electrical. I was going through the electrical system, cleaning 
connections and noticed broken a connection. The connection is located at the 
front of the engine compartment between the power steering reservoir and the 
engine block directly above the heater valve. One wire "appears" to come out 
of the distributer and the connecting wire goes off to god knows where. The 
car is operating fine but I can't figure out what these wires do. Anyone with 
a suggestion?

Subject: 944 - Leak Repairs

Fellow 944ers,
During my mandatory CA smog check yesterday, my mechanic found a number of
leaks/repairs that need to be taken care of.  I would like your help in
determining which of these I can tackle myself and if possible, describe the
procedure or identify a good reference for me to use.  Any general
thoughts/advice on the repairs are welcome.  I normally change my own oil and
have replaced the coolant temp. switch.  BTW, I own a '87 944 with 68K on it.

Here's the list:
Cam housing leak - Apparently the gasket to the cam housing is leaking.  I've
looked at my Haynes manual and it seems like this one is out of my league
because of tools/experience/nerve.  What do you think?

Oil pressure sender leak - I wouldn't think this is a difficult one to handle.
 Any thoughts?

Power steering resevoir leak - The connection to the power steering resevoir
is leaking.  My mechanic suggested that he doesn't normally replace the hose
but cuts off the end and reconnects it to the resevoir.  I recall seeing posts
regarding this problem.  Can anyone direct me to the appropriate archive or
summarize the procedure (if it's more complicated than it appears)?

Cracked exhaust manifold - Apparently the pipes for cyl's 1 & 4 are cracked. 
My mechanic said that they normally remove the manifold and repair by welding
the cracks.  How difficult would it be to remove the manifold myself and take
it to him for the welding?  Does that sound reasonable?  Other solutions?

Balance shaft seals leak - My mechanic suggested that this one could wait
until I have the timing belts done.  Unfortunately, they were just done 5K ago
so I have a while to wait for that one.  I don't know the extent of the leak
but is it reasonable to wait 25K to repair this?  This seems like another
problem that is out of my league?  What do you think?

Sounds like a sieve, doesn't it?  Anyhow, the estimate was $965 to do all but
the balance shaft seals.  Needless to say, I'd love to shave as much from that
as I can by doing the work myself.  I'd also like the satisfaction of learning
more about my car and doing the work myself.  I'd appreciate any help you can
give and as always, direct responses are encouraged.  If anyone else would
like to hear the responses, let me know and I'll either forward them to you or
summarize them and post a message to the list.

        I think the 0-60 times are underrated, but I believe that the hp is 
very accurate. When I toured the factory they were testing engines on the

Just one nit to pick, then I'll agree with you.  The injected Other
German Car was the 2002tii ("Touring International Injected").  This nit
is only important 'cause there WAS also a 2002ti, which was also a
factory hot rod but came with big Weber (I think) carbs.   The "tii"
used a Kugelfischer injection system that differs from the Bosch/911
principally in how the engine speed is sensed.

But overall I strongly second your opinion... these MFI units are nifty
little gadgets that work great for hundreds of thousands of miles.  The
technology (kind of a mechanical analog computer with a 3-D space-cam
"PROM") is unlikely to ever re-appear on passenger cars now that the
microprocessor reigns supreme.  Hang on to it, or sell it to someone who
will!

Yes. You are correct, that's how it's supposed to work, HOWEVER...

On a cool day (high of 65-70F), then temp aint supposed to climb
all the way to the top of the normal range! Once the fans came on,
yes, the temp came down to the bottom of normal range. But what if
the outside temp was 95F? The car would overheat before the fans
could get the engine cool quick enough.

Mine was a combination problem, bad fan switch (fan not coming on
at proper temp), and bad thermostat (not open completely, I suspect).

Since I've replaced both, on 85F days in traffic, the highest my
gauge has been to was slightly above mid normal range.

Subject: Starting Targa Top Restoration

Well, after a few excellent postings on targa top restoration, I think Bob
Spindel generated the first one, I decided to buy the skin and headliner
and restore my top myself.  So far Ive removed the old headliner.  Im studying
the top presently and foresee that one challenge not mentioned in any of
the postings is to ensure that the vinyl skin is properly tight when the
top is unfolded.

Am I correct that this was a challenge during the restoration of a targa
top?  Im thinking that I should install the raingutters and side rubbers
when the top is almost unfolded and then with that little extra stretch 
required to unfold it all the way, the vinyl lay good and tight along the
outside of the frame (ie NO SAGGING).


any opinions from the resident restorers

If you have the tools, you can do it yourself. If not, have your mechanic do
it.  Of course, you have to take the belts loose to do this, so, hmmmm, why
is your mechanic wanting you to wait for the balance shaft seals???

Problem with welding a manifold out of the car is that you may weld it at an
angle that will not fit your head. Does the mechanic have a jig to hold it
properly? If not, you may want to ask him how he is going to ensure that the
manifold mating surfaces (to the head) are going to be in exactly the right
place.

Other than that, the exhaust manifolds can be removed with the engine in the
car, and require a couple of 12 or 13 mm wrenches and sockets. I use 3/8
inch drive sockets to get to the bolts at the downpipe. They can be a
(insert commonly used term for female dog) to get loose.

You can wait, but keep an eye on the amount of oil dripping out the front of
the belt covers. If there is too much, you may end up soaking the belts and
spending real money...

One last comment, what kind of a boat does your mechanic have? Or is he just
planning to go Porsche racing and needs some new go-fast parts. $965 is just
way too much for this kind of work.

Send me a first class airline ticket, put me up at your finest hotel, feed
me till I'm stuffed, and I guarantee I can do all this work and still save
your $300.

:-)

GOOD LUCK!

I believe the thermostat opens at 180F and stays open while engine is
running at operating temperature.  The low speed fans come on at 198F
and the high speed fans come on at 216F.  The fan switch is stamped
92C and 102C.  So I assume that's what that means.

The connector on mine is broken. I've wondered what that wire is too.
The car idles fine with it disconnected. (I forgot to reconnect while
working on the engine one day before I noticed it.)

I guess you have gotten on it more than a few times!

With that kind of wear you should try a set of BFG Comp TA-R1 race
tires. They should last almost the same, and you can go fast on the
track without changing tires! The BFG's are available in 235/40/17
for the front (stock size is wimpy) and 255/40/17 for the rear.
Your car will pull WELL over 1g with these tires.

An added advantage is that the BFG's are WAY CHEAPER than normal street
tires! (about $130). I'll even pay for two of your tires if you would be
interested in a co-driver for an SCCA Pro-Solo or National autocross.

Porsche has finally made a car better than a 2.4S!)

This is interesting ... I've heard from a BMW dealer that the BMW
Lightweight M3's to be made this summer have engines that have the best hp
rating of those coming off the "standard" M3 line.  This jives with several
people claiming that their M3s have substantially more hp (as tested on
their dynos) than the factory suggests.  The factory spec is 240hp, and
said M3 owners were claiming up to 280 dyno'd hp.  Of course, this is all
second-hand.

Now for some more factual data: When BMW made the M1 all M1 motors (type
M88) were run on a dyno for SEVEN HOURS* (!) to verify that they met the
minimum of 277 hp (DIN).  This, it turned out, was pretty important, as the
early motors (still in development) would self-destruct in short order.
It's also one reason why BMW lost so much money on each M1. In the end, BMW
(through BMW Motorsport) ended up with a pretty good motor, capable of
470hp normally aspirated in Group 4 and around 800hp turbo-charged in Group
5.  This motor and its variants showed up in the M635CSi, the M6 and the
M5, and 4 cylinders of it showed up in the first-generation M3. But the M1
was too heavy to ever have a chance as a serious race car. As a
street/touring car, its handling is quite impressive.

Those of you who can read German may enjoy "Autos die Geschichte machten -
BMW M1", by Lothar Boschen, Motorbuch Verlag, ISBN 3-613-01265-0.

I wrote up a little "M1 Histoy Text" for one of the rec.autos.xxx groups a
while back and will e-mail it to whomever would like a copy.

*Seven hours at high rpm will destroy just about any engine, so obviously
this wasn't at full power.  Unfortunately, I don't know what the M88 "dyno
schedule" was.

Some additional MFI data points for the history buffs:

All US Alfa-Romeos from 69 to 81 had MFI (mfg by SPICA, main business was
diesel injection pumps). Autodelta (Alfa's quasi-official racing arm)
switched to MFI and a sliding-plate throttle assembly on the early-70's
GTAm to gain an extra 20hp over the Weber 45DCOE-carburated versions of the
famous GTA. The V8 Alfa Montreal used an 8-cylinder SPICA pump in all
markets.

Also, the '77-'80 BMW M1 has a 6-cylinder Kugelfischer pump. When tuned
properly, the throttle response is fast and smooth, and the noise is great!
:)

Lastly, lots and lots of Mercedes gasoline models (starting with the
mid-50's 300SL gullwing, 240hp out of 3.0l, same as the new BMW M3 today)
used Bosch MFI pumps - some 2-piston, some 6-piston.  I don't know if there
were any 4-piston units.

#1	ANY 914-6

Subject: 911 1990: Hot starting problem?

I'm the new owner of a 1990 911 C4 w/ 45k miles.  Everything about the 
car seems to be Ok, except if I drive the car, stop it, and try to 
recrank it - it doesn't start immediately.  It is almost as if the car is 
flooded or something.  I'll try to crank it and it want "catch".  I'll 
try again - keeping the starter engaged longer - still no crank.  Third 
try - cranks up with slight hesitation.  It's Ok after that (unless I 
stop it and try to recrank).

If the car is parked more than - say - 50 minutes - no problem.

I'm new to the car (and to 911s) and would appreciate any advice on what 
the problem could possible be.  Maybe a bad sensor some where?  Maybe a 
clogged fuel filter that needs time to unclog?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Re: lateral > 1.0g ?

Hi Bill!  Several years ago, I did alot of measuring at Mid-Ohio on various
P-cars of mine and others.  At that time, the old version CompT/A-R1's were
capable of 1.07 to 1.13 g on various 911 and 944T serious setups.  These were
measurements in a slightly banked corner coming on to the start/finish
straight.  These loads were at a speed of 45 - 50 mph, I would guess, with a
certain amount of bumps and control margin left to counteract the slight
banking.

Slicks can give 1.25 to 1.40 if alignment and such are really right on
stiffly sprung cars.

As a slight g-Analyst fun story, at Daytona, Hans Stuck was qualifying the
red #5 Coca-Cola 962 and generated 2.4 g's of braking coming into the infield
turn-off on the front straight.  In the infield u-turn, in second gear, the
962 (I believe in 2.8 liter trim) generated 0.8 g of gas pedal ooomph coming
off the exit of the turn.  Woweeee!

place to find one; if you don't care about 356s, read on...)

"...Ludvigsen reports 0.81 and 0.83g skip pad figures for the 356C at
Weissach, depending on the pad diamter. Of the 77 cars listed in the
January Road and Track road test summary, only four cars had better
numbers than the 356: the BMW M1, the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer, the
Lamborghini Countach, and the Lamborghini Jalpa. The 356 equalled
the 930 Turbo and was better than the 911SC, the 944 and the 928."

Remove the caliper and rotor, and use a gear puller on the hub.  I think
I remember there is an indent in the axle for the puller to push against.
But I really can't see what would be holding it in.

Thanks for your thoughts on the K&N air filter.  I removed it after only

Turbocharging per se is old hat, dating to 1905. It's been common in
racing circles for a long time, being just about required on the
Offenhauser powered Indy cars of the 60's. For Porsche, they started
with racing cars and moved it to the street. Naturally, the first Porsche
turbo was on the 917, a car which already had too much of everything
else...

There are a couple of places to start looking.  "Porsche Turbo
Racing Cars" by Ian Bamsey is a nice coffeetable book that claims to be
definitive, but I've noted some holes in. Still, nice pics...

Ludvigsen's "Excellence was Expected" is also full of tasty tidbits on
the turbo program, and something that should be on your bookshelf.

Finally, Bruce Anderson pretty well covers all the 911 variants in "The
911 Performance Handbook", which has a developmental history as well. If
you only care about the 930 family, this is the one you want to have.

> What's the going price for a replacement Turbocharger?

That's like asking "How high is UP?"  Which one, why do you need it, are
you doing any "modifications" to the system, etc. In general figure about
a kilobuck for a replacement unit for what you have, and all the ads
remind you that you can "uprgrade" for "ONLY a few hudred dollars more".

What they don't tell you is that bigger (i.e. pushed more air) is typically
also heavier, which means spins up slower, which means (you guessed it)
more turbo lag... There is no free lunch here. To get significant power
increases, and have the car still be "drivable" on the street, you need
to *re-engineer* the induction, not just bolt crap onto it. You may also
need to re-engineer the rest of the car too, depending on how much more
power you want -- power equals heat, and you gotta do something about that; 
acceleration equals energy and you gotta be able to disapate that when
stopping, etc.

This thread has been going on since I joined the 'list' - maybe this will be

A friend prepared the 3 cars used to portray 1 drab dark green 911 Targa in
Patriot Games.  The color was chosen by Hollywood types so that the car would
NOT divert attention(ie. become the star of the show) from the film itself.
 The 3 cars used were a very low mileage 84 3.2 Targa(about 20k miles), an
average miles 3.2 Carrera Targa, and a high miles SC Targa. If I remember
correctly, none of the cars started life Green, all had to be repainted for
the movie.
The low mileage car is now a Red slant nose turbo look Cab.
The average miles car was wrecked during filming and parted out.
The SC was WRECKED during filming and was parted out... providing, among
other things, an oil cooler system for my 66 911 Vintage racecar(recently

I am just getting done w/ my conversion. After starting my swap I found that
to use the stock trans, breaks, and CVs was not the way to go. That cluch on
the 901 is way, way to small. I have ended up welding a lot of tubing, and
sheet metal to reinforce the body and suspension. I boxed every thing. For
the trans I use a "two year" '77 930, the gears are huge. Every thing on this
thing is made for killer duty. The cluch, CVs, and gear ratios for the 930
are more up to the task than that little 901. By the way, converting that
trans and making it shift out the side was quite an interesting and fun

Over 1 g?  Heck yeah!

BFG R1's will get you over a G on any well set-up P-Car.  My National 
Championship winning 914 1.7 would pull as much as 1.2 momentary and 1.15 
sustained g's running on BFG stickeys.  The new 944 S2 produced some 
beautiful G-Analayzer traces at the Little Rock Pro Solo with peaks at 
1.16 and sustained at 1.10.  Even my lowly Mazda Miata (last year's 
effort) would go over 1.15 pretty easily.  

These measurements are from Valentine's G-Analyst.  Margin of error, if 
set to the proper roll angles is, they say, less than 1%.  The roll 
angles should be close enough to keep the total error to within about 
2-3%, again according to the company's literature.  Concrete surfaces, 
like Salina or Little Rock routinely produce from .05 - .1 more g's than 
asphault, but a banked track will raise g's considerably.  A bigger 
surprise to me was how LOW my braking G's are in a normal autocross.  
Rarely do I get past .4 braking g's!

  my '75 914 (2.0) has some electrical gremlin(s) inside.  Looking for any
  suggestions as to what to look for.  Here are the clues:
  car starts/turns over and catches, and immediately dies/cuts out.  Starts
  if push-started, but no go with the ignition.
  This happened late Friday night.  Got a friend to push-start me and
  parked it in a safe place overnight.  When I turned it off and pulled the
  key, the driver side (front and back) parking lights came on.  Hmm, seems
  electrical (well, duh!).  Put the key in and turn one notch... lights
  off.  Weird.  Not wanting to deal at 1:00 a.m., I pulled the fuse for the
  parking lights and went to bed.

Subject: 911 Carrera

Hoping to buy a 911 Carreara before June. Considering years 87 to 89. In the
past I have owned 944's and a 928.
We are a two car family now and would like to sell one of the cars when I buy
the Porsche. Figuring I can save money by having only two autos, and the fact
I'm buying a Porsche 911 to drive and not park in the garage. From the cars I
have seen In the Milwaukee area I figure I will have to spend in the area of
 $25,00 to $30,000 for a great low milage car.  Here are my questions.

1)  Is the hydraulic clutch that much diferent from the clutch in the 84 to
86 911 carreras.

2) In Milwaukee we get Snow and Ice on occasion. How is a 911 in such  conditi
ons. I had Goodyears GT/4's on my 944 and they performed well in winter
driving. What about the 911's tail hapiness  in winter conditions. And
finally is the heater that much slower to heat up in colder climates.
Is it stupid to even consider driving a 911 in winter? Is a  third car a
better option?

3) What can a person expect to pay yearly for regular Maintenance on a 911.
Not counting insurance or gas.
Is $1000 to low of a figure. In the past I have always purchased service
contracts and have paided less for the contract than the future repairs the
contract covered. So I really believe in the use of service contracts.

Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated.

Key off, both parking lights on on one side, switch in steering column......

You've left your turn signals on.  To make the French (?) happy, the 914
will turn on its parking lights on one side if you park with the signals
left on.  Seems there's a law that requires "parking" lights to be left
on on the street side.

As for your other gremlin(s).  Make sure that all of your fuses are
pretty and clean, and not corroded and bent like mine were.  Another
excellent cause of electrical distress is the relay panel inside the
engine compartment.

I don't know if it's there on the '75, but the relay group under the
passenger seat (it's there on '74s; help me out here group!) can fill
up with crumbs.  The starter and seatbelt interlock go through there.

I would start my search by looking at the stuff that's "different"
during starting.  Like ignition ballast cut-outs, and the like.

Happy hunting!

Help, I purchased a 85 911 Carerra a few months ago.  Before I purchased it,
the seller told me he would replace the radio with the original Blaupunkt,
Monterey series (SRQ23).  Which at the time was no problem.  The radio works
fine, but when they installed the other radio & then reinstalled the
Blaupunkt they disconnected the fader switch that is in the center console
by the shifter.  This was done because the other radio had the fader built
into the radio.  I pulled apart the console & found that the female portion
of the connector jack is gone.  Does anyone out in Porschefile land know how
the wiring is suposed to go.  There is 6 wires coming out of the male jack
from the fader switch, red, brown, blue, green, white, and black.  Any help

Subject: For Sale : cheap '81 930

Howdy,

While putting the first '95 gas in my '73 914/2.0, I saw a
930 Turbo at a garage, and of course asked if it was for sale.

It is a Euro (of course) car with a recent engine rebuild (do
any 930's still have original engines?). It is kind of rough,
but would make a great track car or a "beater Turbo" :-).
It could use paint and rubber stuff, and interior is only fair.

The price should be well under $20,000 (asking price).
The paperwork may be a hassle, because it was registered
in Maine (no title) but has all EPA/DOT (I think). Not currently
registered - I hate this kind of deal - MVD makes you get
releases from anyone remotely connected to the car.

Anyway, it's at Hilario's gas/repair/etc in Newtown, CT. and 
is not currently advertised, and owner seems anxious...

not enough spare $ or garage space for a beater 930 :-( .

Subject: Oil Change Interval; possible leak


I just changed the oil in Katarina and (for the first time in her life) 
put Mobil 1 15W 50 in (instead of the Castrol 20W 50 the Porsche shop 
puts in).  I'll be doing a couple of track events in May, an autocross at 
the end of April and driving about 2000 miles to and from Myrtle Beach 
next week (ah, sunshine, golf and my 911 . . . as the beer commercial 
says, "It don't get no better than this!")

Anyway (sorry for the digression),the change interval was 3000 miles for 
the Castrol.  What is the interval for the Mobil 1 (if any different) 
given the anticipated usage?

Question 2:  I've noticed a small drip at the engine end of the  oil line 
that connects to the oil reservoir.  I can't tell if the connection 
(which was redone this week after the oil line was taken off and put back 
on - a story for another time)(grimace)) is leaking or if the return tube is 
leaking or if it is simply oil dripping down from above (this is right 
under the oil filter, which we all know dumps some oil when you remove it 
for an oil change).  The car does not drip when it has been sitting.  I 
notice about 1 drip when I return from driving within about 15 minutes of 
parking the car.  Then nothing more.  Any ideas?

One of our region's members has a similar color 914...the color not only
looks good on the car (to my eyes) but it has won at least one "peoples'

Subject: Filling up valve covers with oil in 914's

    Greetings Gang,
    
    I'm not on the mailing list anymore, but I need the collected wisdom of 
    the group. So Jim is posting this message for me...
    
    I club race a 914 2.0 in class J.  In long high G-force corners, the 
    914's tend to load up their valve covers with oil .  The stock set-up 
    sends the oil that doesn't drain back into the crankcase up into the 
    air filter via hoses that come together at a "flashback valve" and then 
    into the air filter.
    
    Since loading up the air filter with oil isn't such a great idea, I 
    thought I'd re-route the single hose coming off the flashback valve up 
    into the oil fill cap.  So now, the cap is tapped and excess oil is 
    routed directly back to the crankcase through the oil fill cap.  To 
    ensure crankcase ventilation, I ran the hose that inputs into the base 
    of the oil filler mouth (it's metal box that mounts to the engine 
    block) to the air filter box.
    
    So now the question...  Is what I've done a good idea?  Typically, I do 
    these things thinking they are a good idea, but sometimes they fall 
    apart after I understand what the engineers were originally trying to 
    do. It seems to me that what I've done is avoid the use of an oil catch 
    bottle, but if it were so easy, why doesn't everyone do it?  
    
    Please respond directly to me at JON.KIES@AST.COM.  As always, your 
    responses are greatly appreciated.
    
    Thanks,

Subject: Questions-911S wheel/tire sizes

Situation - I have 1972 911S rebuilt track car with 1989 3.2 Ltr Carerra
engine ( ie 255 hp, maybe 300 ft lbs torque using 50 series tires) ), 901
transmission, and stiff suspension (23 & 29 mm torsion bars). 
Right now I have 7x15 inch front wheels and 8x15 rears, and tires 205x50x15
front and 225x50x15 rear Goodrich R1. 
Two problems: 
(1) rear tries are scrapping outer edge of rear tires, 
(2) the 50 series tires on 15 inch wheels using my 901 transmission are
giving me too much low end torque ( ie, I am in 5th gear when Carreras are
in 4th, and I may run out of top end speed on some race tracks).

Questions-  What should I do about wheel and tires sizes at least cost?
Cheapest alternative may be (a) to buy two 7x15 rear wheels, and sell the
8x15. Then, next tire set I could buy 205x60x15 front and 225x60x15 rear.
Question: would taller 60 series tires fit in 72 911 fenders on 7 inch
wheels?? (Would be somewhat softer ride).
Another, more expensive, alternative (b) is to sell (or trade) 15 inch
wheels and buy four 7x16 inch wheels all around and keep with 50 series
tires I have now. These have wider tread width and different tire pattern
than Goodrich RI 60 series tires. Would the tires w/ 16 " tires fit in a 72
911 fenders with the 1 inch higher wheels?
The last alternative (c) is to spend another $1,000 to flare rear fenders,
but I would still have the problem #2 of tires too small?.
 
Would really appreciate your advice and help.

>Two problems:
>(1)  rear tires are scraping outer edge of rear tires,

I assume you mean the tires are making contact with the fender opening.  This
does not surprise me.  I have run 7" rear wheels with 205/60-15 A008rs
Yokahama on a 70 911 with the same torsion bars and had rubbing under hard
corning.  (Track conditions)  going from an 8 inch wheel with 225/50-15 to a
7 inch wheel with 225/60-15 will probably not solve your rubbing problem.
 More than likely the only thing you are going to be able to do to get enough
tire under the rear of the car is flare the rear fenders.  (Just what you
wanted to hear, right?)  The early body just wasn,t made for wide wheels.

>(2)  the 50 series tires on 15 inch wheels using my 901 >transmission are
giving me too much low end torque (ie, I am in 5th >gear when Carreras are in
4th, and I may run out of top end speed >on some race tracks).

This is a little confusing as the 72 911 came with a 915  transmission which
with stock gearing  and normal diameter (say about 24"  or so) tires should
be turning about 2600 rpm @ 60 mph in 5th gear.  with a theoritical red line
of 6500 you should be able to pull 150 mph @ redline in 5th gear.  This would
be true even with a late (69-71) 901 gearbox if it has stock gears.  Has your
gearbox been regeared?  It sure sounds like it.  If this is the case, this
may be the foundation of your problem.  Normally rear tire size is selected
for handling balance not gearing, although it will effect gearing to some
degree it may not effect it to the degree you are looking for.  If the car is
oversteering or spinning the rear tires coming off corners and you can't
correct for this with suspension adjustments you may need larger rear tires
and/or a limited slip, but if your only problem is one of top speed vs engine
rpm you are probably going to have to regear the transmission.

Hope this helps

Subject: re:re: Autothority Mass Flow for 3.2 Carrera (rambling)

Sorry don't know anything about this and don't even have a Carrera. 
 
However.... 
At the NYC Car Show yesterday, I ran into my mechanic, Tom of AutoSport
Design in Mineola, LI. He was working the Ultrasmith booth. Ultrasmith does
the $$$$$$ chi-chi boy-toy conversions on  MB, Porsche, Ferrari, etc. You
know, ostrich interiors, powered license plate switcher, etc. Being based
in Manhattan, they have the clientele. Apparently, Autosport does much of
the actual work (performance upgrades and ground effects, not audio) for
Ultrasmith. I was surprised, but Tom always surprises me. 
 
Anyway, I asked him why he had the Autothority 330RS #001 (pumped up BMW
325is, reviewed in all the big mags, M3 beater) for sale. It was at the
Ultrasmith booth, Tom has been advertising it in the NY Times lately, and
it seemed to have nothing to do with either. He told me that he built the
car, and that he has does much of the engineering for Autothority. 
 
Autothority..Autosport..Autothority..Autosport..who knows... 
 
He also designed the some of the chips for Autothority, and in fact burns
them at the Autosport shop. 
 
THE POINT: He also told me that the 3.2 Mass Flow was designed by him and
prototyped on his own '87 Carrera. Seems like he might know why and how it
works. Or doesn't. 
 
His '87 car BTW, has received the RUF Yellowbird treatment, albeit, in
white, is turbocharged now and produces 428hp, and performance similar to
that of the two '96 993 turbos PCNA had upstairs. It is a sleeper without
wheel flares. It's also for sale. See it in the Ultrasmith booth too. 
 
Check them out, they advertise in Pano. 
 
The most interesting part of the show for me was not PCNA's announcement
that the 928 and 968 are out of production, that the new '96 993 Turbos
(looks more similar to the normally aspirated versions than in the past)
are only $100,000 (lot of bang for the buck), or the Ultrasmith booth.
Nope, I loved that MBNA (not MB) gave me a 1:24 Revell Cobra for applying
for a credit card and Marlboro gave me a watch (cool watch too!) for
playing their Marlboro Grand Prix video game. 
 
Biggest disappointment: Sitting in a Land Rover Discovery and Defender.
Jeep and even low-buck Suzuki are a lot nicer. 
 
Happy Holiday.

been toward the 356 model( I have been looking for a really nice example for
a while )
Anyone close by that would like to take the cover off there's and doing a
little showing off or just taking 356 would be really welcomed.
My phone number here is 407-498-5569
or EMail be be nice
Look forward to Porsche conversation

  I recommend C4 or latest(the latter half of '92 and '93)C2 rear calipers
  because they are 4 pot calipers (may be the same as 928`s)and perhaps 
  your brother doesn't need to switch parts any more.

and it works.
  I put the key in the first position and the roof unlocks fine and can 
be removed, I replace the roof and cant get it to lock again but if I 
leave it unlocked and drive away it will lock itself. Am I totally

Subject: Factory Alarm

To anyone who can help:

I have an '83 928S and the alarm is very finicky.  I can't find it in the 
manual anywhere but I'm pretty sure it's a factory alarm because when it goes 
off, the horn starts blaring like crazy.  After much trial and error I have 
figured out that (generally) to turn the alarm on all I have to do is lock the 
door (the lock is motorized).  To turn it off, however, is the real trick.  
Usually I just turn the key until the lock raises and hold it in that position 
with the key in the lock for five seconds.  Obviously, lots of trial and error 
to find this little technique.  It usually works but -- not always.  When it 
goes off people from miles around get an earful and I have to wait for it to 
finish blasting (about 30 seconds) and then I try again.

1.  What is the real technique for turning off the alarm?
2.  If I accidentally set if off, is there a way to shut it off quickly or do I
have to wait until it goes off (very loudly) for 30 seconds?

Thanks a lot...

There are *LOTS* of them. See the FAQ for suggestions.

Only to the people that *SELL* carburetors. 

You get generally improved operation for a stock or mostly stock engine
using EFI, and even for race engines, can modify the EFI to provide
better performance than carbs. 

The only applications for which I ever recommend carbs are certain classes
of racing sanctioned by the SCCA which *require* the use of carbs to be
legal.

Oil leaks from the pushrods should not have effected the clutch. Make sure
that you have that leak under control before you replace the clutch, or
you'll either waste money or get to do the work again, or both.

Increasing horsepower is a very different operation. There are no worthwhile
horsepower increases for that engine that do not involve rebuilding at least
part of the engine.

They're not factory (unless part of some wierd Canadian option pack).
You'll have to chase down the wiring yourself.

While this was pretty well covered, I figure I'll add my $0.02 here...

All fuel metering devices are approximate. That means all have some deficiency
somewhere, which means for some application, one will be better than another.

Carbs are simple, easy to build, easy to repair completely mechanical devices.
They don't approximate the fuel-air mix very well, as they work on a simple
method of approximating air flow by the suction presented on an orifice.
Many things can hose this up, and there are wide ranges of operating speed
where the air flow is too low or too high for this to be accurate, thus
requiring the addition of additional correction mechanisms. "Really good"
carbs have lots of them; that  means under most conditions they do the
right thing. Problem is that while this works well for certain engine
configurations where a single carb with a common intake plenum can even out
a lot of things, a flat engine with a throat per cylinder magifies the 
problems.

Mechanical Fuel Injection uses a 3-d space cam to approximate the fuel flow 
required for a given engine configuration at a given RPM under a given 
approximate load and delta V. This is a LOT better -- given that all the 
Rube Goldberg assortment of tiny moving parts is actually working right,
the cam isn't worn, the injectors are firing as advertised, and the engine
is not modified.

In general, carbs are easier for Joe Shadetree to get working so that
the car at least runs. I've *NEVER* in 20+ years seen a carb so bad out
of the box that the car bolted underneath didn't run for at least
a while. Carbs are also *CHEAP*. That means that if you're looking at
a $1500 repair on your MFI pump, that Weber conversion for $1000 might look
pretty good. And it will actually run. And the Hawethorne Effect will
*TELL* you that it's "better" even if it's not (look it up  -- it's
good to know about).

I'm a purist.  If I'm racing, I'm in it purely to win and use the very 
best technology I'm allowed to use to win. If I'm restoring  an older
car, I want it to be a nearly perfect (mechanically, anyway) version
of what it was when it was new. There are no MFI Porsches out there
that aren't relics. Hence, for me this is easy: fix the MFI, run the
engine in nearly stock form, and be amazed at how well all this stuff works...

For absolute BEST power, performance, whatever, you'd want a modern
programmable EFI which uses a shit-pile of sensors to allow a software
version of that 3-d space cam to fire the injectors Just So. And it's
still not very good because you have to program it and that's where the
mistakes come from..

Carbs? I use them on 356s, 914/6s, and early 911s. They're too much
trouble on anything I have to deal with regularly.

where we bitch and moan about how hard it is and how ungrateful all
you subscribers are... 8{) Anyway, this offers a view of the process.
I think Porschephiles sort of transcends this, since we have a high
turn over but a solid, solid core of multi-year subscribers. Anyway,
another "worthless non-Porsche topic" to mull over.

THE NATURAL LIFE CYCLE OF MAILING LISTS

Every list seems to go through the same cycle:

1.  Initial enthusiasm (people introduce themselves, and gush alot about
    how wonderful it is to find kindred souls).

2.  Evangelism (people moan about how few folks are posting to the list,
    and brainstorm recruitment strategies).

3.  Growth (more and more people join, more and more lengthy threads
    develop, occasional off-topic threads pop up).

4.  Community (lots of threads, some more relevant than others; lots of
    information and advice is exchanged; experts help other experts as
    well as less experienced colleagues; friendships develop; people tease
    each other; newcomers are welcomed with generosity and patience;
    everyone -- newbie and expert alike -- feels comfortable asking
    questions, suggesting answers, and sharing opinions).

5.  Discomfort with diversity (the number of messages increases
    dramatically; not every thread is fascinating to every reader; people
    start complaining about the signal-to-noise ratio; person 1 threatens
    to quit if *other* people don't limit discussion to person 1's pet
    topic; person 2 agrees with person 1; person 3 tells 1 & 2 to lighten
    up; more bandwidth is wasted complaining about off-topic threads than
    is used for the threads themselves; everyone gets annoyed).

6a. Smug complacency and stagnation (the purists flame everyone who asks
    an 'old' question or responds with humor to a serious post; newbies
    are rebuffed; traffic drops to a doze-producing level of a few minor
    issues; all interesting discussions happen by private email and are
    limited to a few participants; the purists spend lots of time
    self-righteously congratulating each other on keeping off-topic
    threads off the list).
OR

6b. Maturity (a few people quit in a huff; the rest of the participants
    stay near stage 4, with stage 5 popping up briefly every few weeks;
    many people wear out their second or third 'delete' key, but the list
    lives contentedly ever after).

Sounds like a sticky switch or relay.  The owner is probably not a twit.

You might try swapping the relays at the motor (they are identical) to see
if the symptom changes.

The switch can be checked with an ohmmeter.

There is also a switch at the front of the sunroof, in the center of the
headliner (of the roof itself).

Good luck

Subject: What's it all about, Bartie...?

You 124 payed-up Patrons and Members can delete this...

To you Old and New Porschephile-subscribers (who are wondering
what all this talk of money for a *free* list is all about...)
Greetings!

Porschephiles has steadily grown to a membership of *OVER* 1500 members,
generating traffic of more than 68,000 messages per *day*, which is more
traffic than MCI handles!

This volume of traffic is eating a significant chunk of Stan's T-1
service.  In addition, it now requires that a machine be dedicated to
handle this traffic.  This machine is old, nearing the end of its service
life, and should be replaced.

Not to put too fine a point of this, this eats into the Listmeister's
livelihood, and, amigos, that ain't right.  We owe Stan an inestimable
debt of gratitude for freely providing this service at no cost for the
past 5.5 years.  The very least we can do to show our gratitude is to
take as much of the capital burden upon ourselves as possible.

We have established a Not-for-profit bank account with my bank in
Crofton, Maryland, to accumulate the funds, and are asking that each
member who is concerned for the survival of Porschephiles, to contribute
what they can.  I have suggest appropriate donations would be $15 for
Students, $50 for Employed people, and $100 for those who wish to be
considered Patrons.

*Nobody* has to contribute anything.  We are trying to acquire the funds
to build the infastructure to ensure the survival of Porschephiles
independent of any member.

I don't have firm figures for the costs we are facing, and that doesn't
bother me a bit. I do know that Stan has made the service available to
the group, using the capital resources that he depends upon to earn his
daily bread, and is begining to feel the strain.

So where do the suggested contribution numbers come from?  Can you say
"Rectal Data?"  It is my sense that a Student should be able to afford
$15.  If a poor starving Stoont can cough up $15, it isn't far out of
line for a Working person, who can afford both a love of Porsches and
access to the 'net, to be able to pony up $50.  If you want to do more,
then $100 seemed like a nice, tidy round number.

I don't think it's anal-retentive to recognize those who dig deeper.  I
have assured all that no one's name or contribution level will be
published *unless* they instruct me to do so.  NOBODY *HAS* TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING!

I also know (I've been investigating the costs of becoming a Service
provider on the 'net, and) it's not cheap.  A recent InfoWorld has a
comparison of two package servers, one from BBN, and the other a Sun
Netra.  We're looking at $7-10K just for the box and software.  I don't
believe that Mailing list Software was in those figures, but I do know
that they do *not* include T-1 service.  As we determine what the blivid
(5 lbs in a 3 lb bag) of stuff totals out to be, you will be advised.

So what If you don't send anything?  You're *still* a Porschephile, with
all the privilidges and rights pertaining thereto.  As long as the
service survives...

If you want to ensure the survival of this organization, and I sure as
hell do, then send what you can.  Many folks have asked what would be
appropriate to send, and I've tried to offer guidelines.

So What do you get out of this?  How about a nice shiny *Number*,
reflecting the order in which I receive your check?  Whatever
organization we form to shelter the funding under, this number will be
your membership number.  You get to be a *charter* member of whatever it
becomes.  Impress your Friends!  Be *attractive* to Members of your
favorite Gender!  Be known as a *True* Porschephile...

And, how about *Satisfaction* that you've been part of one of the *great*
happenings on the 'net?

Finally, the "membership" issue.  We need to decide what kind of an organiztion 
we will be.  Here, again, you can be a PORSCHEPHILE and not join any more
organizations.  Many of us would like to be the Electronic Frontier
Region of PCA, but this is not universal. Most of the Non-US folks are
not interested in affiliating with PCA, and that's no problem either.

Everyone *Can* send a donation; *NOBODY* has to!  Everybody can Join
(whatever orgainzation we decide); again, *NOBODY* has to...there is
enough interest in the EFR business that we *can* go that route if
required to keep my butt out of the [deleted] grasp of the IRS.

rather that you send the checks to me, made out to

"nuts" are actually a strip of (guess) 3/6" steel about 1" by 5/8".
These are glued in place so you, like me, may not need to replace them
since they still may be there.  If you do need to replace them, just get
a few odds 'n' ends of scrap metal and run a tap through it.

If you don't have any metric taps, and the original nut plates are
still there you'll probably need them to clean the threads out
anyway.  A set of taps and dies is a fantastic tool to have, probably
the best investment in tools I've made barring maybe a torque wrench.

Nate,
If you would be so kind as my mail continues to bounce away.

Hi everyone,
Some of you probably rember the FI problems I have been having with my 73
914 2.0. Well I thought I'd give you all another shot now that the car
always does the same thing all the time instead of different symtoms at
different temps. The car burns too much gas and it now will not run more
than 1 min without totally fouling it plugs. The ignition system is all new
(rotor and distributer cap spark plugs and wirers). The FI system has new
cylinder head temp sensor injectors and brain. So what could make the car
run this rich? Wich sensors could be bad and how do I check them.
Thanks again for your help
Nick
PS could the old injectors been flowing so poorly that they didn't
completely foul the plugs before the new ones went in?

PPS When I removed the injectors three matched and one was much smaller and
a different colour. Big ones green small one black. Whats up with this?

I had the same problem in my 951. What you do is remove the "trapezoid" 
at the front of the roof, above the interior light. Take the black 
plastic cover off, then check the electrical switch.There's a sponge 
underneath it; chances are this sponge has compressed or worn away, thus 
the roof doesn't work. I recommend using silicone in place of the sponge...

In Bad Boys, Will Smith's character owns the car. He's a cop with a large

Subject: Re:  Factory Alarm

The alarm on my '84 is turned on by turning the key to the lock position
in either door or the hatch, in theory. It is turned off by turning the
jey to the unlock position in any of those, also in theory - no five-second
delay. In practice, the alarm is not actually turned on or off by the
driver's side door lock - I imagine a switch in there has failed.

In the wiring from the door to the body of the car, the alarm circuit is
a separate three-wire cable, with an easy-to-reach connector. You
could check there to see if reasonable circuits are being made/broken
when you turn the key in the lock.

You should be able to shut the alarm off immediately, if you set it off,
by turning the key to the unlock position in any of the three locks.
If it doesn't shut off, that seems to indicate bad contacts in the
lock you tried.

I had this sort of problem when I bought my car.  I didn't even cut

local hardware store and replaced the crappy hose clamps that came
on the car.  This took care of my power steering leak until my

Question- if you have 1972 911S without flares, with a 7 inch Carrera wheel

the oil lines on the right inside rear??
I measured a 7 inch wheel with a 205x50x15 tire and it had about 30 to 40 mm
clearance inside between the oil line and tire wall. Assuming that one half
of increased tire width of a 225 is inside, ( ie 10mm) then that would be
about 20mm clearance left inside for the oil lines. Is that  a correct
calculation? Is that enough for high speed track and flexing?

Subject: 911: SCCA Stock Class

A few questions for someone who does Solo II with a 911:
I'm interested in slight modifications to my '86 Carrera but
I don't want to do something that would make my car non-stock
for purposes of SCCA Solo II.  (I belong to car clubs but
not SCCA.)

1. Is there an SCCA rulebook for the 911, Porsches, or
just a big one with everything in it ?  What's it called ?

2.  My car has standard seats (non-sport).  What are my options
for keeping my butt more stationary ?  I figured that aftermarket
seats would be "non-stock" and also figured that factory "sport
seats" from the same year might be OK. How about later factory
sport seats though (like from an RS America) ?

3. Turbo tie rods - do they make a difference and are they
legal in stock class ?

4. Here's what I think I know <g> please correct me:  
 - stiffer sway bars (Not Legal), 
 - adjustable spring plates (N.L.), 
 - slight lowering with rack spacers (Legal?),  
 - racing harness (N.L.), 
 - 7&8 x15 with nonstock profile tires (N.L.)
 - new rubber suspension bushings (L), non-rubber (N.L.)


The tie rod question may seem out of place but I'm replacing the
front shocks [already did the rear while I had the engine out]
and doing the rack spacer thing. I figured I'll be getting the
ride height and alignment done anyway so if I'm going to
do the tie rods someday, now would be a good time.

 Yes, I feel guilty about asking these questions instead of doing
all the research you folks already did but take it easy on the
flames OK ?

Subject: Spacers/Graphite oil/911 alarm


My brother-in-law just visited me from Belgium. He mentioned that he uses 
a type of "graphite oil (Black Cobra?)" in his 911SC and swears that it 
runs smoother now than when he first bought the car. He also mentioned 
that his mecanic over there squirts a tube of graphite in the oil of my 
brother's daily MB turbo diesel. Is this the belgian equivalent of 
automotive shamanism, such as "ketok?" Or, is there a real benefit to this? Any 
insights are appreciated.

Next, I am wondering if the use of spacers has any danger linked to it. 
I am thinking of 1" spacers for the rear wheels of my 84 911, equiped 
with 16"/7" Fuchs. The fronts are 16"/6"...do they need to be spaced also?
What is a good brand to use? I did read in this month's Pano that one has 
to keep in mind the tire patch/steering arm ratio, length, or something 
along those lines...I'm obviously not very technical...just like to go 
fast!

Finally, I read a thread on factory alarm systems for the 928. This leads 
me to the following question/problem: When I turn on the factory alarm in 
my 84 911 located on the side of the driver's door, I invariably get one 
or two beeps upon opening the door again, and before I can subsequently 
disarm the alarm. Is there some type of relay that can be adjusted...or do 
you just have to play Mister Slicky Fingers without trying to scratch 
the paint on your car?

          that was in Doc Hollywood  last night? NBC maybe?


          Does anyone have ANY information on a DP935,
          I heard that one of my friends neighbors in Longwood FL is
          selling one of his DP track cars.  The car is putting out
          a measly 650 HP, and he is selling it without the
          turbos, does anyone have any additional information on any
          of the DP935's that were made, and how much they would
          go for?

          BTW the person selling the car is named Don Flanagan and his
          950 bhp twin turbo dp935 was on the cover of European Car
          July 1994, I think the car is set up similiar.

          Thanks for any info.

        Unfortunately, the spy photos are rather depressing.  The cap-

so!  It looks MUCH better down on the bottom they way it looked in the
show car.  The apparent lines of the prototype are very...  Miata-

been done!  (Too many times.  There are a ZILLION of the pesky little
things out there!)
        I wish they'd left the HUGE wheels and wheel openings on it.
Those gave an "apparent reason" for the shape of the fenders.  Now it
just looks like a slightly-sculptured blob.  Yuck.
        I know, they disguise the prototypes--I just hope that the
final product is a *LOT* nicer than the photos would indicate!

Subject: Oregon Region Track Day Report (long)

The Oregon Region had a track day at PIR on Friday.  The forecast
was for occasional rain which is just what we got.  I was looking
forward using up a full tank of gas driving in the rain with a
slippery track.  I wanted to practice car control in my 81 911.
Boy, did I get to practice. :-)  I hadn't had the Porsche on the
track in over 2 years.  I have been driving and racing VW's which
are much more forgiving cars and knew I had developed bad habits.
A stock 911 *demands* to be driving smoothly (properly).

The chicane (Festival Curves) was being used.  I would normally say
this is a bad thing for non-race days.  Since racers have problems
with spinning out or getting stuck in the sand trap I would think
club day'ers would have even worse problems with it.  It worked well
though because people already had to pay more attention than usual
since the track was wet.

The Oregon Region chose to run the track day as one long open
session from 2pm to 7pm.  There was a break in the middle of the
session for the SCCA turn workers.  The open session is intended
to allow people to go on and off the track when they would like to.
At the start of the session most of the cars lined up and went out.
I didn't go out right away with the crowd.

Fellow p'philer Miq Millman was out at the track visiting but didn't
bring his Porsche.  I took him for a ride.  (There is a double
meaning there :-).  My lack of track time in the 911 was showing and
it took about half an hour to get used to it again.  The track started
fairly dry then sprinkles began and the track started getting
slippery.  I moved to the rain line.  Crossing over the line,
especially the exit of 1 and the entrance of 9, would always cause
the car to slip sideways a bit.  I only looped the car once while
Miq was a passenger.  It happened exiting 3 which opens up.  I crossed
onto the line with too much power and lost the backend.  Pushed
both feet in and did a lazy 360 off into the grass (and mud).  After
a bit Miq had to get back to work.  I dropped him off and went back
out since there was a little more rain.

I noticed during the day that most people would exit the track when
the rain started and enter again when it stopped.  I was doing the
opposite. :-)  My second time out I stayed out for 45 minutes in the
rain.  I just kept going because I was having so much fun (I was
giggling a couple of times :-) and I was learning so much.  I have
never had the opportunity to be on a racetrack before where the car
would either twitch or slide so much.  Once while braking for the
chicane the car twitched left towards the wall.  Crossing the line
after the apex of 1 the car would slide every time.  Exiting 3 crossing
the line the car would be loose.  At the apex of 5 the car would be
loose.  Once I wasn't paying attention and did my upshift at the apex
of 6 instead of before or after.  Turn 6 (turns right) is innocent
looking but it has a slight dip at the apex.  When it is wet it is
very dangerous and has collected *many* cars.  I found out it makes
the car twitch to the right where the wall is.  I didn't lift so it
was fine.  Later in the day someone hit the same spot and did lift.
His 911 went into the wall on the right and then slid off the track
to the left and hit the guardrail.  He's not the first one and won't
be the last. :-(  Once I had the car twitch to the right towards the
wall in the middle of the back straight.  The back straight is actually
a *long* right sweeper.  The conditions were slippery enough that
I couldn't even take the back straight at full throttle.  Several
times the front wheels locked up while braking for 9 as I would cross
over the line entering 9.  Even exiting 9 onto the front straight
the rear would brake loose a little under hard acceleration.

I thought it was a great track day.  Of course, everyone kept looking
at me funny when I would say I was having so much fun.

Subject: '73 914 2.0L CV Joints

Well folks:

Weather was nice (finally!) this weekend, so I got back to work on the 914
powerplant install.  I was getting ready to button the axles back up to the
transaxle when I decided (because they were 95% out anyway) to drop the
axles and repack the CV joints.  To my dismay, the inner right-hand CV joint
has a broken race.  Assuming the other joints pass inspection, can I replace
just the one broken CV joint on that axle or do I need to do both ends of an
axle at the same time?  Beyond cracks and such, is there anything to check
on a CV to determine its roadworthiness?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Porsche suing porsche.org owner.


Hello,

Some poeple may find this very interesting.  I hope I don't provoke
another escapade into the old stories we all once followed.

As an intellectual property/patent law student, I was reading one 
of my favorite newsgroups this morning, misc.int-property.  It
turns out I came upon a recent post fro this past Friday (4/14/95) 
and some relies from our old friend T!d M.

Believe it or not, he is being sued by Porsche for trademark 
infringement (probably for the domain name porsche.org), and they 
are also trying to sue his employer becuase Porsche thought he was
running the list from that location.  It turns out that he 
admits in the posting that he was running this from his home via an
internet service provider and had the Porsche.org domainname registered
with the internet domain name service so that the "whois porsche.org"
command on an internet host gave his name and home address.

He is looking for an attorney apparently, and writes that he can't
afford the full cost of a lawsuit, but can afford some up-front adivce.
 
He goes on to say that Porsche has been harassing his employer and
he wishes them to stop doing so.  

Anyways, though this may bring joy to many on this list, I would not
wish it on anyone.  I personally never had a problem with the guy,
and thought the battle on the list was sort of funny.

It also raises an issue that is hot in the legal arena now.  That
issue is the idea of copyright infringment on the internet, and 
trademarking domainnames, etc.  

I would have copied the note he posted, and I am sure he would
want me to, so that he could try and sue me for copyright infringment.
Sorry T, I'm one step ahead of you.  Good luck against Porsche.
Maybe if you just gave them your 911 with 4 different sized wheels
and agreed to be honest about your auto-x times, they would settle out 
of court. :-)

Subject: Deals On 968's??????


My two cents on the 968 question.  I talked to Fred Schwab from PCA at the 
NY Auto Show and he said that they are only making two 968 a day.  (NOTE: 
the only 968 at the show was stuck off to the side of the Porsche info booth 
by the Lexus display.) He said, "We'll keep making them as long as people 
want them".  If they're only making two a day, I doubt that there will be 
many around to "blow out."  However, if you find one around on a dealer's 
lot that has the goodies you want, remember not too many shoppers pay retail 
on new Porsches.  I recently heard from a normally reliable source that with 
the air cooled cars, a discount of 8% is not considered unusual (I did the 
math, it's big number in my tax bracket).   So if you know about a good car 
for sale, make an offer and see what happens.

Another idea, you could make friends with the used car or lease manager at a 
dealership and ask him/her to keep an eye out for a good car coming off 
lease.  The discount off new would be substantial.  Anyway, if you really 
like the 968, keep looking, it's a great car to drive.

You'll probably get a few responses to your post, here's mine:

1995 Solo 1& 2 Rulebook (SCCA).  Call 303-779-6622.  You may have to join to
get a copy and then it's $8 (I think, Sally bought this year's).

I think you have this one already.  Generally the rule is: if it's a factory
option for your EXACT model that was generally offered through US
dealerships, then you could put that option on.  The catch is, that if it's
one piece of an option set, you have to install the entire option set and
delete anything that optioned model *wouldn't* have had.  Other general rule
is: if the rulebook doesn't say you can do it you CAN'T...

>3. Turbo tie rods - do they make a difference and are they
>legal in stock class ?

Nope and Nope

>4. Here's what I think I know <g> please correct me:
 >- stiffer sway bars (Not Legal),

you can change the front one to whatever you want (including remove it) but
not the rear.

> - adjustable spring plates (N.L.),

Correct, it's not legal.

 - slight lowering with rack spacers (Legal?),

Nope, and not in Street Prepared either.  Superfast BSP driver Eric Messley
got caught at last year's nationals with rack spacers and it cost him the
Solo II and Pro Solo placings (and all his 1994 Pro Solo points). Lowering
by adjustment of factory suspension components is legal

> - racing harness (N.L.),

No, these are ok for the driver's side.  I believe you have to keep the
stock belts as well (this part of the rule is changing for Street Prepared,
though)

> - 7&8 x15 with nonstock profile tires (N.L.)

This is legal as long as the offset of the 7s and 8s are within 1/4" offset
of stock ones (since 7&8x 15s were an option by themselves), tires are free.

> - new rubber suspension bushings (L), non-rubber (N.L.)

Yup.  New OEM is ok, different is not.

I took mine *out* and used Carrera tie rods -- at AX speeds you won't tell a
difference, at track speeds you might, but I drove mine both ways before and
after Turbo Tie Rods and it's not a big deal....

Don't feel guilty -- it's far easier to keep on the right side of the rules
by asking questions before you start making wholesale changes.  I had
prepared our car to PCA rules and had to undo scads of stuff when we started
SCCA AXing...

Subject: Track day at Lime Rock (long)

This is a description of my recent track day at Lime Rock with the
Connecticut Valley Region of the Porsche Club of America.

I recently purchased an 89 944 Turbo, and I was looking forward to a Driver
Ed event so that I could explore the car's (and my) performance in the proper
environment (no police, speed limits, idiots behind the wheel, etc). A
driver's ed event is the perfect place. The CVR had an event, and I was ready
to go.

First of all, getting there was very interesting. I live on Long Island, NY,
and I was meeting one of my friends at his mothers' house, which is only 45
minutes from the track. Since his wife was taking her own car there, my wife
and 8 month old daugher were going with me. My wife would go to the track
with his wife in a separate car. That led to one VERY packed 944. I remember
someone asked it is was possible to fit a baby seat in a 944 - it is. I also
had a stroller, play pen, and my track equipment. There was not room for
anything else. Of course it rained the entire trip to Kingston, but at least
the track day was dry.

This was my first track day of the year, and fourth total. I did three days
last year in an 86 normally aspirated 944, but I was looking for a car with
more performance, so I sold the 86, and bought an 89 turbo. For those of you
who are not aware, the 89 Turbo is the same as the 88 Turbo S, and includes a
247HP engine, really BIG brakes, and a stiffer suspension. 

The day started with a nice drive to the track, with my friend John in his
85.5 944 following me to the track on some nice winding backroads. A very
nice way to warm up your mind and car for the track day. At the track, it was
time to check in, and go through tech inspection.

Since I am still a novice, I had an instructor with me on the track, and we
met before the first run, to find out how much experience I had. When he
found out that I had car for only two weeks, and that I had 3 days track
experience, he got a little nervous, and starting mumbling something about
high performance cars, and the importance of being smooth. After a few laps
where he could see that I knew at least a little about what to do, he
relaxed, and the fun began.

There is only one word to describe the performance of the car - 
AWESOME. 
There is just so much power and brakes available at all times. ABS really
comes in handy. It makes finding the braking limits very easy. I was a little
worried about turbo lag, and the sharp power delivery of a turbocharged
engine, but it turns out there was nothing to worry about. At track speeds,
you are always turning such high RPMs that there is zero lag.

My instructor drives a 911 SC, and he was very impressed with my car. There
were more than a few instances where I made mistakes that he said would have
put his car off the track, but the 944's balance, brakes, and suspension
saved me. Since my instructor didn't know about 944s, I got a ride with
another instructor, who races 944 Turbos in PCA club racing. This way I go to
learn the 944 Turbo line around Lime Rock. I discovered a few turns that I
was taking wrong, and I even changed one shift point. That dropped my lap
times about 2 -3 seconds.

Some other things I noticed: Catching and passing other cars was a breeze. In
my 86 944, I really had to work to catch and then pass other cars. Unless I
was right behind going tinto the straight, the higher performance cars were
able to walk away from me down the straights. Even though I would be faster
in the turns, I could not pass very easily. With the Turbo, I could catch
anyone, and passing was just a matter of waiting for the passing signal, and
putting my foot to the floor. The only cars I could not just fly by were a
new 911 (993), and a 928 S4. The car ran great all day, and I did about 80
miles of track driving.

Now I have one very dirty car and I can't wait until my next track day. Due
to my schedule, that won't be until the end of May. At least my car will be
clean by then.

I've had the same problem with my '84 928S.

The motorized release retracts a little plastic edge
that is wedged over the hatch "catch" and the spring
inside the release mechanism then pushes the hatch
up a little to disengage the catch.

On my car I was able to get it working again by adjusting
the position of the catch on the hatchback.  There are two
allen head bolts holding the catch to the hatch.  Loosen
them slightly and then try different variations -- there is
enough adjustment available that you should be able to 
get it to work.  

I finally took a 2x4 and gently tapped the catch slightly 
on one side (the passenger, I think), tightened the bolts, 
and it worked again.

Before doing all of the above, it's probably a good idea to
see if the motorized release mechanism is really working,
not just making noises.  Take out the tool kit in the rear
of the deck; the release mechanism is visible if you lean
in and look under the rear lip. Get your significant other 
to sit in the car and trigger the release while you observe
the mechanism.  

Good Luck!

Subject: strange people/drivers

Do any of you get strange/aggressive responses from other drivers while 
in your Porsches?  For example, people cutting you off, trying to race in 
front of your, etc.  I decided to compare notes with ya'll on this list 
after 3 occurences of this kind of thing recently.  

Two of such occurences for me were rather harmless, nevertheless stupid.  
On the Milwaukee freeways twice in the past two weeks, I've had people 
pass me on the shoulder in *bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic*.  I'm 
sure they felt better being one car ahead of me for the next 20 minutes.  

Another incident was slightly more disturbing.  A guy in a crappy old 
Chevette came up behind me very close screaming, using various hand 
gestures, etc. 
to display his feelings for my speed of driving (I guess).  The funny 
thing was that I was in the far right lane driving at exactly the 
speed limit.  A similar thing happened to me in Minneapolis a few years 
ago when I had a 924, except this individual wanted me to pull over so he 
could "kick my #$%&*."  His screaming at me for no apparent reason was 
bone chilling (obviously he was a little nuts).  

So, is this type of thing 'par for the course' when one owns a nice car?  
I'm starting to think that a car such as mine attracts extreme 
responses--both postive and negative.
I highly doubt it is something I'm doing wrong, like being some horrible 
misfit driver.  I've never been in an accident and this type of thing has 
never happend to me in any car I've owned except Porsches.

    sport seats though (like from an RS America) ?

Any seats that were not available from the factory on an '86
are not legal. So get the stock '86 cloth sport seats.

3. Turbo tie rods - do they make a difference and are they
   legal in stock class ?

Not legal in Stock class. If yours are OK they are good enough anyway.

4. Here's what I think I know <g> please correct me:  
    - stiffer sway bars (Not Legal), 

Front bar would be legal, but an '86 uses the underbody style
bar, and the '86 already has the biggest front bar of this type
that Porsche offered. So there is not much you can do with this car.

 - adjustable spring plates (N.L.), 
 - slight lowering with rack spacers (Legal?),  

Yes, Not Legal. But lowering WITHOUT rack spacers is totally legal.

 - racing harness (N.L.), 

These are legal if you keep the original belts in the car.

 - 7&8 x15 with nonstock profile tires (N.L.)

Any size tire is legal on 7 and 8 x 15 rims on an '86 Carrera.
These wheels were a factory option. 225 and 245 50 series BFG tires
are the hot ticket for this car.

 - new rubber suspension bushings (L), non-rubber (N.L.)

Correct. Your '86 bushings are probably OK if your car does not have
very high mileage. My '72 bushings lasted about 100,000 miles, until
about '92. Then they died. An '86 has the best suspension of the
Carreras (same as later ones) so it is pretty good in Stock class.

Subject: What would you do? (my mech. and I)

  I don't do the "outraged consumer" very well, so I'm looking for some
  other opinions.  Here's the situation...

  Dropped my 914 off at my mechanics on Sunday afternoon, March 19 (have
  done this once before).  I was not expected, but had no where else to go.
  Turns out they were in the middle of moving their shop to some other
  locale.  I could've driven it out there, but his wife (he wasn't there)
  assured me that it was no problem, leave the keys and a description of
  the problem, he'd call me.  No sweat.  Felt bad abandoning it there for
  them to deal with, but...

  He called on Tuesday.  Seemed a bit harried, with the move and all.  I
  stressed that I was not in a hurry, I understood the situation he was in,
  and since I commute by bicycle, my need was not great.  After 2 weeks, I
  called to see what was up.  Got a message back (voicemail) the next day
  or so.  Then, on Monday April 10 said he was going to try to have me on
  the road by Tuesday.  Didn't hear from him, so I called on Wednesday.
  Said I needed the car by Friday, was leaving for my folks house for
  Easter.  Later got a message (last Friday) that the part took 1 1/2 weeks
  to get here, and it was the wrong one, so he was driving [somewhere] to
  look for another (a switch in the steering column), would call me later
  on Friday.  He called and left a msg. on Friday at 7:00, was going to get
  the switch in Sat. morning.  Called Saturday at 1:00 pm, said he had the
  switch in but there appeared to be more electrical problems, and he
  wasn't going to be able to get it to me until Monday.

  Today is Monday and I have yet to hear from him.  My options are:  to
  bitch and complain; insist that he get it fixed this week, hell or high
  water; when it is fixed, expect the bill to have some $$ subtracted;
  charge him rent for having my car there for 1 month now; expect to be
  charged for parking; (add your own here).

  I like the guy, I want to appreciate his position and all, it's probably
  not all his fault, but... do I have just cause here?

  PS-I guess this is all justification for learning this stuff and becoming
  your own mechanic.  Easier to complain that way, but probably no better
  results.

Subject: "Standox" paint

All,

        After 9 mos of learning and procrastination, I'm about to have the
356 painted.  It needs a little body work, and repair of some poorly done
previous work.  I'm going to strip all trim and glass and take it to the
shop.  During the car's stay at the shop, I'll be dealing with chrome shops
and rubber suppliers.  The real fun starts in a month when I get to
reassemble everything, and match up the baggies of screws, etc., with the
pieces, and make them fit.

        One question for the painters in the group - The shop I selected
likes Standox Paint.  I've never heard of it.  He says it's German, and used
by Porsche, VW, Audi, etc., and is top quality.  It's a urethane top-coat
system, of course.  (I guess that's the paint of choice when stripping and
starting over.)  So, anyone heard of Standox paint, good or bad?

Roger,

So, I got a question.  My '87 911 has a slow A/C leak somewhere.  I've had it
charged and over the course of about 2 months, it eventually stops blowing
cold and manages to produce a mere cool.  I had the UV dye inserted, and so
far (after 2 weeks) we have been unable to spot anything.  So, where might
this leak be occurring.  I mean how is it that I can't find the leak with the
black light.  I've heard that the long rubber hoses leading along the rocker
panels are a trouble spot.  Also, could it be leaking internally to the
compressor?  Will this dye eventually show up?  Should I just wait a
while longer?  What are the most common trouble sources?  Anyway, your wisdom
would be appreciated.

Hi Nathan:  So, you've discovered that the juices that flow for you when you 
see a Porsche are different than the juices that flow for others when they see 
the beast. 
 
Grin and bear it and realize that whether it's jealousy, envy, tree hugging 
sympathies or whatever else that incites these folks, the bottom line is that 
you're having fun driving and they are probably driving some average piece of 
s**t and having little fun if any. 
 
I had a red Ferrari 308 GTS and that car caused multitudes of seemingly normal 
people to display a very interesting range of emotions and responses to their 
emotional ebbs and flows. The GT350 Shelby Mustang I drive makes some people 
nuts, especially the younger set with street racing fantasies. 
 
The 930 I used to have was pretty intimidating to lots of folks.  One look at 
the Porsche in their rear view mirror and they either couldn't seem to move 
over fast enough or they'd slow down intentionally and struggled with their 
insecurities by blocking me or tapping their brakes.  I wasn't on their butt 
or going excessively fast, just there, with something they didn't have that 
made them realize how boring and unsuccessful their little lives were. 
 
The 356's seem to inspire different reactions.  Most people smile and seem to 
enjoy them.  I guess they aren't viewed as being as fast for their era as the 
later cars.  
 
So, rejoice in the reality that you're ok but some others should have their 
dosages adjusted.

Do any of you get strange/aggressive responses from other drivers while 
in your Porsches?  For example, people cutting you off, trying to race in 
front of your, etc.  I decided to compare notes with ya'll on this list 
after 3 occurences of this kind of thing recently.  

Two of such occurences for me were rather harmless, nevertheless stupid.  
On the Milwaukee freeways twice in the past two weeks, I've had people 
pass me on the shoulder in *bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic*.  I'm 
sure they felt better being one car ahead of me for the next 20 minutes.  

Another incident was slightly more disturbing.  A guy in a crappy old 
Chevette came up behind me very close screaming, using various hand 
gestures, etc. 
to display his feelings for my speed of driving (I guess).  The funny 
thing was that I was in the far right lane driving at exactly the 
speed limit.  A similar thing happened to me in Minneapolis a few years 
ago when I had a 924, except this individual wanted me to pull over so he 
could "kick my #$%&*."  His screaming at me for no apparent reason was 
bone chilling (obviously he was a little nuts).  

So, is this type of thing 'par for the course' when one owns a nice car?  
I'm starting to think that a car such as mine attracts extreme 
responses--both postive and negative.
I highly doubt it is something I'm doing wrong, like being some horrible 
misfit driver.  I've never been in an accident and this type of thing has 
never happend to me in any car I've owned except Porsches.

    I seem to remember a discussion about car covers a few months back, so
please pardon the rehash, but what's the scoop on waterproof car covers?

I live in south Florida where the sun is quite brutal and it rains almost
every afternoon in the summer, so a cover MUST be waterproof (ever fold up
a wet cover and store it overnight in a warm humid climate?) and it must
be able to stand up to the sun. Plus, I don't want a real bulky tarp kinda
cover.  Suggestions?

Floor mats. Any recommendations for replacements? My local Porsche dealer
sells the same Lloyd floor mats that I can get thru mail order. Are Lloyd
mats the best I can buy? Any recommendations would be appreciated!

From: Don Rubin <rubin@moe.setinc.com>
Subject: 89 951 oil leak

I have scanned the messages for the last few months and haven't found this
problem addressed directly so sorry in advance if this is old news.

My 89 951 has 27K miles, I am not the original owner but I know him and
this car has had a small but annoying oil leak since it was new. When
I bought the car at 20K miles, I had the pan gasket replaced because that
was the most likely (according to my mechanic) source of the leak. No change.
When the clutch went (those pesky little springs on the OE clutch) I had
the dealer replace the rear crank seal while he was doing the clutch. It 
kept leaking perhaps worse. When I brought the car back in and complained 
he had the same mechanic replace the seal assuming it was defective. Well 
within 100 miles it was leaking again. I 
talked to the dealer and PCNA tech and was told "well your problem is the
engine is developing too much crackcase pressure and it is blowing oil
by the seal", they said a leakdown test indicated bad readings on several
cylinders. Time out, I went to my mechanic who in my presence did a leakdown
which was marginal in three cylinders BUT the problem was not the rings
which might have explained the high crankcase pressure but the exhaust 
valves. I assumed that it must have been carbon build up (the car is mostly
driven only to/from/at track events) and had been on short trips and had
been sitting since fall. Last weekend I went to Summit Point for a track
event, on the way home after the 1st day, when I stopped at a light smoke
poured from the hood. As best as I can tell the leak got slightly worse
and the oil burns when it falls on the hot exhaust system. The car uses
very little oil and there is no puddle on the driveway. Anyone have
any ideas? I plan to complain to Porsche because in my opinion there has
always been this problem and they should fix it. I just wish I had the
solution. Also today I talked with someone who said to check the
crankcase breather system, there may be a leak in one of the hoses or the
oil fill system but its hard to get to (you have to remove the maniford).
Sorry for the long saga.

  Hey Greg,

  If your car was fixed to your satisfaction, you like the
  mechanic and plan to use him again, I would say to
  suck it up and not bitch about it vociferously or expect
  a lot back (i.e. discounts for inconvenience), unless
  you know that he is trying to take advantage of you.
  From your description of the situation, I would guess
  that you will gain much more in future service (again,
  assuming that the mechanic is straight with you) if you
  let him know that you needed it sooner but keep a
  level head about it.

  Also, in the future, whether or not you need it soon, agree
  on a tentative timetable (" I need it no later than X date")
  that you both agree to.

  These are, of course, opinions, so YMMV

  Good luck,

Lance, 

I couldn't agree with you more in your assessment of the 993.  I, too,
haven't "topped out" the car. I have seen 175 on the speedo but had to back
off. This was, of course, in a most special location away from innocent
bistanders.  The car was rock steady at that speed (the outside,rearview
mirrors were vibrating a bit, however).  This was with a passenger (she
noticed the mirror vibration).  Here in Florida you have to remember to shut
down the AC somewhere north of 150!

And you talk about addictive, I have put more miles on the 993 in 8 months
than I did my  last car in two years!

A few years ago I went through the process of replacing the inner CV

my daily-driver BMW.  It doesn't seem to have suffered. It took me a while
to figure out the CV joint assembly "trick" - now I keep one on my desk as

However, when it came time to do my 914 I just bought all-new axles and

same price (Lobro does both BMW and Porsche).

  I don't seem to have these problems but I live in New Hampshire
with a generally pretty civilized populace.  However, I did break down a 
few years ago in my 944 Turbo and people did scream bad things at
me as they drove by though couldn't tell what they were saying.
  I pretty much figure these obnoxious people must have some good
qualities and give them the benefit of the doubt. Just smile and wave.
  vrooom,

Subject: Those *#$&@ 914 sunvisors!

Has anyone figured out a way to keep the 914 sunvisors tight and well 
in their slots in the retaining clips? What with the constant up and 
down whenever you take the top off/put it on, the pins that come out 
from the sides of the visors always seem to pull in, and then I have to 
unscrew them, pull them out, and screw them tight again... Plus 
sometimes they don't rotate in the retaining clips like they should, 
they just pull themselves loose... It's ARGHHHHH annoying!!!

Not a huge problem, just a bothersome one. :)

sigh. porsche prejudice rears its ugly head again.  I really don't know 
what it is about these cars. case in point:  I frequently drive from 
detroit to binghamton NY.. the quickest and most entertaining way to go 
is across canada (no cops, no people, no kidding.)  Unfortunately, this 
necessitates the dreaded "border stop"... These are usually very trivial, 
they ask you where you're from, where you're going, and what you've got 
in the car.  In my subaru, this is no problem. takes 15 seconds & you're 
across. In the 944.. ohboy.  I get these strange looks. "hey boy, how can 
a student afford one of them jobbies"... (i feel like saying "hey buddy, 
that camry you just let fly thru is worth three times as much".. but i 
hold my tongue.)  I've also had to pull over and had my car SEARCHED more 
than once... said they were looking for "drugs and guns" (!) ok, i guess 
my florida plates don't help...
Interestingly, the women at the border have never given me a hard time. 
they are always more curious about the picture of a manatee on the 
plate.  they don't seem to care.

The address is included. Whilst I was scamming a copy of "Are You
Listening" (the 993 sales video) at the NY Auto Show (damn, couldn't get a
press kit),I asked the PCNA rep why there wasn't a 928GTS at the show. She
said that it was discontinued and there were less than 50 new ones left in
the country. Of course, I believe that is about a year's supply at the
typical sales rate for 928's these days. She also said that production had
ended on the 968, and that Boxters (the new entry-level Porsche) would be
available in early '96 as a '97 model. Things could change. I understand
that Porsche's assembly line is very flexible. But for now the supplies of
968's is finite. Since I still see the occasional '93 and '94 leftover
968's sold new, I don't think that you will find it hard to get a new 968
for the next 1-2 years. There was a silver 968 at the show, BTW.

that went out that year or not?  It has the central console, mahle

The Stuff:
153K, 60K on bottom end rebuild, less than 1000 miles on top end.
New transmission, clutch, injectors, tires, some interior bits
Compression 140ish on all cylinders.

A bit of rust in the rear trunk where water had settled.  Pretty
much surface rust so hopefully I'll take care of it this weekend with
the ol' wire brush, rust neutralizer and rustoleum paint.

The interior is fairly beat, but I didn't buy this car because it was
beautiful.  No accidents, some minor dents and dings.

Will need brakes and struts some time in the near future.  My mechanic
also mentioned that the rotors have gone "off".  Basicly they're all
black.  He says that turning them wouldn't help, etc.  I've never
heard of this one before.  Can someone explain how rotors go "bad"?

Of course, I spent more than I intended to.  $4500.  I personally

Hi Nathan:  So, you've discovered that the juices that flow for you when you 
see a Porsche are different than the juices that flow for others when they see 
the beast.

Grin and bear it and realize that whether it's jealousy, envy, tree hugging 
sympathies or whatever else that incites these folks, the bottom line is that 
you're having fun driving and they are probably driving some average piece of 
s**t and having little fun if any.

I had a red Ferrari 308 GTS and that car caused multitudes of seemingly normal 
people to display a very interesting range of emotions and responses to their 
emotional ebbs and flows. The GT350 Shelby Mustang I drive makes some people 
nuts, especially the younger set with street racing fantasies.

The 930 I used to have was pretty intimidating to lots of folks.  One look at 
the Porsche in their rear view mirror and they either couldn't seem to move 
over fast enough or they'd slow down intentionally and struggled with their 
insecurities by blocking me or tapping their brakes.  I wasn't on their butt 
or going excessively fast, just there, with something they didn't have that 
made them realize how boring and unsuccessful their little lives were.

The 356's seem to inspire different reactions.  Most people smile and seem to 
enjoy them.  I guess they aren't viewed as being as fast for their era as the 
later cars.

So, rejoice in the reality that you're ok but some others should have their 
dosages adjusted.

Do any of you get strange/aggressive responses from other drivers while 
in your Porsches?  For example, people cutting you off, trying to race in 
front of your, etc.  I decided to compare notes with ya'll on this list 
after 3 occurences of this kind of thing recently.

Two of such occurences for me were rather harmless, nevertheless stupid. 
On the Milwaukee freeways twice in the past two weeks, I've had people 
pass me on the shoulder in *bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic*.  I'm 
sure they felt better being one car ahead of me for the next 20 minutes.

Another incident was slightly more disturbing.  A guy in a crappy old 
Chevette came up behind me very close screaming, using various hand 
gestures, etc.
to display his feelings for my speed of driving (I guess).  The funny 
thing was that I was in the far right lane driving at exactly the
speed limit.  A similar thing happened to me in Minneapolis a few years 
ago when I had a 924, except this individual wanted me to pull over so he 
could "kick my #$%&*."  His screaming at me for no apparent reason was 
bone chilling (obviously he was a little nuts).

So, is this type of thing 'par for the course' when one owns a nice car? 
I'm starting to think that a car such as mine attracts extreme 
responses--both postive and negative.
I highly doubt it is something I'm doing wrong, like being some horrible 
misfit driver.  I've never been in an accident and this type of thing has 
never happend to me in any car I've owned except Porsches.

Two weeks ago (SF Bay Area) I was driving my nice-looking '72 Alfa GTV
(Alfa red) coupe in the far right lane, at the speed limit, totally
non-aggressive, and the next thing I knew psycho delivery-van driver from
hell was trying to run me down, honking, gesticulating, getting way too
close, etc. I moved away from him (a couple hundred yards), and took the
next (intended) exit.  As I did I watched him in my rear-view mirror, and I
saw him abort his intended delivery, zoom across traffic to take the exit,
and continue to hound me (I'd change lane, he'd change lane, etc.). This
was getting serious, as it seemed he had every intention of smashing into
me.  So I had to cut left (he followed), and then go way right across three
lanes (it was clear, thankfully - there was some planning involved :) ) to
take the right-turn-on-red. He followed, but I lost him in an area I know
well.  

If it hadn't been for that exit opportunity (the light for all four lanes
was red and traffic was backed up) I'm quite sure he would have either hit
me on purpose or caused an equally unpleasant altercation.  What on earth
was bothering him I'll never know.

Subject: 911 CIS injector insulators?

Hey,

While rooting around in my engine compartment tonight (I have a bad
habit of just kinda getting in there and looking at stuff), I decided to
pull one of my injectors and see how hard it is to replace the seal.
Unlike every other job I undertake that starts out this way, replacing
the seal was easy.  I even put the injector in a glass and turned on the
ignition and lifted up the sensor beam.  Voila!  Fuel!  The injector itself
seemed to be fine - nice conical spray pattern and it didn't leak when
I let the sensor beam back down (not bad for 19 year old injectors).

Now to the point of this rambling.  Replacing the seal did not reduce the
injector's relative motion in the intake runner.  I think the play is in the
insulator (?).  I heard that these are a b*tch to replace?  I don't have
any evidence of air leaking past the seals/insulators, so this isn't a big
deal, but I'm curious to know what's involved in replacing the insulators.

Thanks,

 However, I have always been enamored with the early duck tail spoiler, and

think the downforce could help.

The primary questions are:  (1) Is the factory original part ($$$$)
significantly better than a good fiberglass house can produce today? (2) Will
the thing support the air conditioning condensor?  

I'm not concerned about making the thing fit - I'm patient these days! I'll

So, I'm ready now for assistance, or flames - suit yourself.  But I would

From: HermanHome@aol.com
Subject: Trail Braking

After my letter on braking and turning in, several people asked me to go
deeper (all puns intended) into the concept of trail braking.  The idea of
trail braking is quite simple, you just continue your braking into the turn,
much as I described in the last letter.  Most people actually do some trail
braking naturally.  Where trail braking becomes complex is in it's
application; i.e. which corners should you trail brake in, and how much?  To
further examine this, we have to explain what car rotation is.

Rotation, for those of you unfamiliar with the term, is where the back of the
car starts to purposefully oversteer at the entrance to a corner, in order to
help the car turn in.  When you turn in on the brakes, the front will turn
immediately because it is heavily weighted.  The rear will start to generate
cornering force, and if those forces are great enough, it will start to slide
(oversteer).  The instant that it starts to slide is when you would get back
on the gas.  This will load the rear, and stop the slide.  You will also have
turned (rotated) the car more than if you just turned the steering wheel.
 This can help if your car does not turn in well (understeer).  That is what
rotation is, and I could write a letter on just that subject as well.

Now let's take the three types of corners separately.  They are the
increasing radius, the constant radius, and the decreasing radius.  I have
listed these in order of growing importance with respect to trail braking.
 Finally I am assuming that your car will be neutral or have understeer.  We
can discuss the merits to oversteer vs. understeer at a later date.

In a typical increasing radius corner, of about 90 to 100 degrees, the need
for trail braking is minor.  If your car turns in to the apex well, you probab
ly will lift off of the brakes as you start to turn into the corner, and you
can pick up the gas rightaway.  If your car has a little understeer, you may
need to hold the brakes until the car starts to rotate, and then make the
transition to the gas.  If the corner is high speed, you probably do not want
any rotation, as this will affect car stability, and reduce the entrance
speed more than it will help you to "get around" the corner.

In a constant radius corner, you will want to trail brake past the turn in
point.  You will need to get some car rotation in order to be pointed at the
apex, so that you can pickup the gas and accelerate across the apex, and out
of the turn.  The reason for this is that the apex is located further around
the turn than in an increasing radius corner, and you have to get more of the
turn accomplished in the beginning.  In order to continue braking past the
turn in point, you must go deeper before you start braking, and therefore
carry more speed into the corner, because you will still be doing some more
braking in the corner.  This is why people who trail brake can "outbrake"
those who don't.  They are giving themselves more room to brake.

In a decreasing radius corner, you must trail brake.  You have to go very far
into the corner before you can even see the apex, so you must carry speed
through the beginning of the corner.  Some fast, long decreasing radius
corners (Big Bend at Lime Rock, Turn 17 at Sebring) give you the room to
double apex, and some people actually make two corners out of one (brake - tur
n in and accelerate past apex #1 - brake again - turn in again - accelerate
past apex #2 and out of the turn).  That is fine, but they still must do some
trail braking at the beginning of the corner.  Tighter turns require
aggressive trail braking where you literally stuff the car into the corner
hard on the brakes, and wait for the rear to "come around".  When it does,
you "catch it" with the gas and accelerate past the apex.  This is the only
way to get the car to point itself towards the apex (other than to go slow!).

So that's the basics of trail braking.  I feel that a car should be set up
for slight understeer, to get a stable platform, and then driven, using
techniques like trail braking, to get through the turns under full power.
 Let me know which topic you want me to cover next.

Subject: Re: Fire Extinguishers

Dear Bill:

The best place to mount a 2 1/2 lb fire extinguisher in a 911 is on top of
the transmission hump where it meets the rear seat.  There is an inspection
cover under the carpets.  The bracket will screw into this cover with no
chance of hitting anything (like brake/fuel lines).  Mounting the fire
extinguisher here will allow access with the driver strapped in the seat.

Place the extinguisher and bracket on the hump to position the bracket.
 Remove the extinguisher and mark 3-4 holes using a grease pencil.  Remove
the bracket.  Spread the carpet apart on the marks and put a drop of clear
nail polish on the jute carpet backing.  Allow to dry and then drill through
the nail polish with the proper size drill.  The jute backing will not walk
up the drill bit when you stabilize it with the nail polish.  I recommend
using pan head #8 sheet metal screws 1" to 1 1/8" long.  Remove the
extinguisher from the bracket and screw the bracket down.  Replace the
extinguisher and you are ready to go.  If you remove the bracket, fluff up
the carpet and you won't see the holes.

If possible, I would strongly suggest getting a Halon fire extinguisher with
a double bracket.  Dry chemical extinguishers are a lot cheaper but will ruin
little things like the electrical system, engines and any other aluminum
parts.  If you can't find a Halon extinguisher locally, I stock them and your
cost would be $65.00 less 10% with shipping included.

If you have any other question, please give me a shout.

Thank you,

Steve-

I didn't find getting a tight top a real challenge.  I put
the top on with the frame completely unfolded, starting my
glueing (gluing?) from the center and working towards the
sides.  It had a few 'lumps' when done, but they disappeared
after a day or two in the sun.

I think you have to be careful about getting it too tight.  I
actually recall a posting where someone said they had to do it
twice because the first time was too tight.

Your idea of installing the top with the unit almost,
but not quite unfolded, is a good one, though.  Let us
know how it turns out.

Bob Spindel

P.S.  The bottom line, I think, is that you will have a
brand new top for about $100, instead of $500.  You can spend
the difference on useful stuff like Slick 50, or spitfire plugs...

An 86 944 is a excellent Porsche. Had many improvements over cars only a
year older. Some people with the green and the 911 to boot, pick up a 944
for the track or for fun. I ran into a fellow at a PCA event recently who
was looking at getting a 944 for his son who was just learning to drive.
Lucky kid:) I guess dad didn't want him learning stick on the Carrera.

Subject: Help on buying tires

I posted a note last week about my 944S2 tires and got some good
recommendations from some of you.  Thanks a lot.  I decided to get Dunlop
SP8000's (better wet traction than Yoko's and it rains plenty here in south Lo
uisiana).

Anyhow, I tried to get my tires from the Tire Rack (800-428-8355) and the guy
whom I spoke with was really terrific (John Wompler? x388).  Unfortunately
the Dunlops were out of stock.  I called Dunlop and asked if there were any
dealers in my area.  They asked if I was interested in mail order.  I told
them I had already contacted the Tire Rack but they said there is another
mail order company, Discount Tire Direct (800-831-3456).

I had never heard of them but they had the tires I wanted in stock at about
the same price as the Tire Rack.  They weren't much on the technical support
but they are definately a good second choice to the Tire Rack.

Well, I'm waiting until Friday for my tires.  Then off to Florida for a few
days with the wife.

Subject: Re: Trail Braking

Hi Larry:

I'm enjoying reading your posts on getting around the racetrack more
quickly.  I'm just getting into racing, and I have a (perhaps subtle)
question. If it's not too much trouble, can you give me/us your thoughts on
the matter? Thanks.

My question is pretty simple, I hope. When taking corners, is there any
time when it's advantageous to set the car up so that it's stronly
unbalanced? Moreso than the relatively simple case of waiting to get on the
power once the rear comes 'round?

I ask this because I've always driven a line that comes very naturally for
me - one where I'm acutely aware of the car's balance, and where
(correctable) drifts are the obvious and natural way to go faster. I'm
generally a late braker, too. But after reading Vic Elford's book and his
example of the fastest way to get around an icy 180-degree turn (spin the
car till you're going nearly backwards into the turn, then come straight
out) I wonder if there aren't some instances (on a racetrack) where my
approach & attitude prevent me from picking up on some quite radical
manouvers.

Thanks again,

Subject: Update on 912 RTV & Overheat problem

Fellow P-philes,

First let me thank all of you that responded to my plea for help regarding 
two problems (at least) on my 912's engine rebuild: Blue RTV Form-A-Gasket 
in the sump and a serious overheating problem.

The blue junk was traced to the valve covers. Nice huh ?

The overheating was more difficult:

1) I checked the timing. Not too bad but I will need to rebuild my 050  
distributor (or find an original replacement)) as information provided by 
Stan pointed to an irregular/erratic advance curve.

2) I rebuilt the Webers. It took longer than I thought, but I did not want 
to make any mistakes. I may be slow but I'm not good yet |-)

3) Checked the valve clearances. (That's how I found the source of the RTV).

4) Checked the fan impeller (as per Harry's suggestion) and did not find any 
paper towels lodged in there as I had sheepishly hoped.

5) Then I thought. Ahem. I wish there was a way to check if the oil cooler 
was operating without dropping the engine. Hey, why not pull the 
generator/impeller assembly and inspect the cooler through the hole in the 
fan housing ?

Well the final test was the one that revealed an oil cooler absolutely 
encrusted with what I can only describe as tar. I mean this baby could not 
possibly hope to get even a single breath of cool air!

Then I had mixed feelings. I remember pulling the oil cooler out and 
inspecting it maybe less than 8 years ago. It was as clean as a whistle. 
This was before I had the engine rebuilt after finding an exhaust leak and 
burnt valve. 

Has anyone ever encountered a similar situation. Could the exhaust leak have 
resulted in a buildup of oil deposits on the oil cooler ?

I can't understand how the oil cooler became clogged after such a relatively 
short period (few miles and 2 years in cosmetic restoration). 

Well I'm going to inspect the engine further and will keep you posted on 
further developments. Thanks again for your help ! Special thanks to Stan 
and Harry!

Subject: 944 Vibration

Shortly after buying a 1988 944 Turbo S I noticed a disturbing vibration in
the shift lever and to a lesser extent in the clutch pedal between 3000 and
3100 RPM. My local dealer thinks it is either a warped flywheel or bad
clutch. The clutch is shows some sign of wear (engaging near the end of
pedal travel) but engages smoothly most of the time with no slippage. I
have the dealer bought 1 year warranty that covers most repairs but not the
clutch. Before I initiate major repairs I would like to here from others
who may be familiar with the problem. 

Also, since it appears that I might have to drop the transmission for the
above reason or due to another problem (also have a worn second gear
syncro), I am wondering how much the lower ring and pinion (same as 944S)
costs and how much extra labour is involved ?

My 914 makes a high pitched noise very similar to the noise a teapot makes
when it's boiling. The noise also has a high and low that I believe is
brought about through a rotational movement. I believe the noise is coming
from the drivers side rear but, there is too much engine noise to confirm
this. I have recently changed tires but, the noise was present before the
change. I have also taken it out of gear and cut the engine off at 60 miles
per hr, changed lanes and taken sharp corners in this mode and the sound did
not stop. The sound does not change its tone at all. At all 30 miles per hr
it starts and makes the exact same sound at 80. When I slow down to 25 miles
per hour it disappears. Could someone please list all the possibilities and
remedies to solve this problem. P.S. I have jacked the back wheels up and
spun them by hand and no noise was detected. Thanks, Doug Franks 1974   914

town, when a Highway Patrol officer pulled up next to him.  This road, 
let me tell you, is very seldom traveled and very straight and flat.
Both of them pull off the line together and travel the speed limit for a 
block or two, them come across anohter stoplight.  Both wait..the light 
turns green, once again, both parties travel at the speed limit for a 
couple of blocks, until they reach a third stoplight.   The highway 
patrol office then rolls down his window, motions for my friend to do the

    Now that gave me a good laugh... last summer I was the official
delivery beast over at the local Pizza Slut... nobody could deliver a
pizza faster!  Well, I usually drove my mom's old VW Golf (we had an
agreement - my parents didn't want me to have to pay insurance for a car
of my own...) but the clutch went out about halfway through the summer
(NOT MY FAULT!!! I knew it was going bad so I never used the damn thing
except at stoplights) so I was sans wheels for about two weeks.
    Now my Regular Fans (yeah right) may remember my description of my
dad's Tow Pickup From Hell.,.. a '73 Chevy stepside, lowered, forest
green (almost black) blacked out chrome, lowered, 8" rims, headers, dual
pipes, etc....  Anyhoo, you get the idea. Handled like a sports car,
accelerated faster.  Looked evil.  I don't know how many people said
"oh, yeah, I saw you looking for my house, but I didn't think you were
the pizza guy..."  I was, however, very popular with the gearhead set at
the store, especially since nobody could really believe that a skinny,
bespectacled CMU type would have actually done most of the work on such
a badass machine.  Goes to show...
    As for the tips... kinda sad, but the best tippers are the people
who just moved up a rung on the ol' job ladder from pizza dude... but I
digress.

Nathan,

You wrote that you experience testy drivers who "harrass" you when you're 
out in your Porsche.

I don't think that this is an uncommon occurance.  Strangely enough, I 
have the most trouble with people in Minivans (?).  P-cars seem to send a 
signal to people that " Hey, let's see what this rich-guy (gal) can do ! 
".  Although in defense of those people, I will admit that when I'm out 
in my other car and I see a P-car go by, I sub-conciously find myself 
speeding up.  I don't think this is a decidedly aggressive response, but 
rather the brain telling me that I'd rather be driving my P. too.

Unfortunately, this problem gets even worse with the local boys-in-blue 
who see me ( 22 years old ) driving my 911 and naturally assume it's either 
stolen or I sell drugs.  In one month alone I was pulled over six times 
to explain the situation, thankfully Smoky saw my way and thankfully I 
have yet to get ticketed.

The point is that when you have this type of car, others naturally assume 
two things;
		1 : you have lotsa money
		2 : you like to go fast

It can certainly be a pain at times but no matter what happens, you're 
still the one in the Porsche and they're not.

Enough of my drible,

Conversion of the early model ('70-'72) tail shifting 914 transaxle to the

to replace the rear cover if you don't have one. Simply 3 shift forks and the
shift console complete the job.

These days, the parts are readily available and the conversion is very
rewarding. However, with the conversion, the additional shifting and engine
mounting parts must also be used. They are as follows and are all taken from
the 73-76 model 914s:
     Front shifter assembly
     Front tunnel shift rod
     Special large to small shift firewall bushing
     Rear shift rod and coupler with coupler bushings

Steve-

FYI, I believe that to replace a synchro, the entire transaxle needs to be
disassembled. (May want to learn how to double clutch for a while instead). Be
careful about putting the 944S ring & pinion in, Porsche had strongly
recommended NOT doing this since it is not strong enough to handle the power of
the 944 turbo. (had two friends who blew up the ring & pinions this way, I had
mine removed ). The lower gearing is really sweet, but I'm not aware of a lower
gearing that is strong enough to accomodate the 944 turbos. If there is one, I
would *REALLY* like to know about it!

Subject: 911: Bad Rear Bearing (novice questions)

In the past few weeks I have occasionally heard a whirring sound coming
from the back of my '87 911.  So I finally got the chance to jack the
car up and spin the wheels.

Findings:  Right Rear wheel spins freely, no brake rubbing or noise.  No play
when I pull/push on top/bottom of wheel.

Left Rear wheel spins, but I hear a clicking sound (not very loud) every
half second or so.  There is no play when I pull/push on the wheel.

So I suspect a bad bearing, although as a novice, I have no idea whether I am
right.  The books I have read indicate that a symptom of a bad bearing is
some play when pulling/pushing on the wheel.

Anyway now to the questions.  (Just FYI the car has just under 50,000 miles).

Does this sound like a bad bearing ?
If not, what ?

Is 50,000 miles usual for a rear bearing to go bad ?

Assuming it is a bad bearing, what is involved in replacing it ?  I am
particulalrly  interested in getting some idea of what is involved and the
cost since I am only a novice and I don't want the dealer to know :-).
I looked in the catalogs and the price for a bearing seems to be around $60.
But some years seemed to need an inner and an outer bearing and for an '87
the catalog did not list inner and outer bearings.  Is there only one, or
two of the same part ?

I tried to figure out what is involved.  After fixing the bearing I assume
an alignment will be in order.  Also, I believe the brakes have to be removed.
Is it worthwhile having the dealer do the brakes at the same time.  This
would hurt because I just bought a new set of pads and was planning on
doing this myself.

I am kind of tight for money right now (dam IRS).  I do want to get it
fixed though.  If only the one side is bad, do I just get the dealer to fix
the one side, or should I do both sides at the same time ?

So, my novice view :-

Parts cost = depends on whether there are 2 bearings and whether I should
do both sides at the same time.
Labor cost = no idea
Brake work = not sure what is needed.  Flush ($60).
Alignment = I am pretty sure I will need this ($150).

As you can see I am just a novice, so your help would be much appreciated.

Subject: RE : 911 Duck Tails

Pat Garvey (PORSCHEFAN@aol.com) asked about the aftermarket vs 
original 911 duck tails.

Last year I put an aftermarket duck tail on my car. It takes a lot
of work not only to get it to fit, but just for drilling and
attaching parts. A plastic grille must be obtained (the early metal
one I had was much too curved to fit). The holes to mount the grille
must be drilled. Also two screw-in rubber stop-bumpers must be
obtained, and holes drilled to screw them into. I also had to
drill a hole for the clasp mechanism (and put a small ding in the
tail by going through and hitting the outer layer of fiberglass).

After all this, the tail fit poorly- the center was curved and stuck
up a bit. But after a few days of engine heat and sun, the tail seemed
to form to the car and now fits OK. 

I weighed the fiberglass tail and my stock engine cover, and the
weight saving is negligible, maybe 4 pounds. But the reduced lift
is well worth the installation, especially on the track.

The factory tail has a metal frame so it will fit much better and
survive more abuse. I think they run about $1500 used.
But the metal frame can rust.

I removed my duck tail to go back to SCCA Solo-II A stock, so if
anyone wants a pre-fit tail ready to bolt on, let me know. Also it's
still unpainted, so you can make it match your car. And the grille
and bumpers are included!

The thread about other drivers' responses to P-cars seems
to be mostly stories of encounters of the negative kind, but
my experiences have all been positive (except for last 
weekend's speeding ticket that would have been 
written up at a lower speed if I had been in my Datsun!).

Just as an example ... early in my ownership of my 928
I drove up Malibu Canyon Road here in LA.  For
those who aren't from this area, it's a neat two lane
canyon road that's just fun to drive,  providing you don't
have a slowpoke in front of you (no safe passing areas).  I 
entered the road just behind a slow, fat stakebed truck
and was convinced I'd have a miserable ride.  Then the
truck driver saw me, saw that I'd probably like to drive 
faster than he would be going, and he let me get by.  Now
this took some planning; he had to find a shoulder to 
pull up on, he had to come to almost a complete stop, etc.
This isn't the only time I've had this experience.  If I'm on
the freeway in the left lane and the car in front is not 
going quite as fast as I'd like, most drivers move over as
soon as they see the P-car.  (when I had my Datsun, I 
could sit behind people all day long and they wouldn't 
move over).

I know there's lots of crazies out there, but so far my 
experiences have been pretty good!  I guess there are
also a lot of nice people on the road, we just happen to 
notice the idiots more than the good guys.

Hi gang,
To those of you with dirty fingernails and wrenches next to your PCs:
While pulling my motor over the weekend I had a problem with the return oil
line that was seized to the fitting going into the oil console (filter
housing).  Bottom line was that I loosened the fitting that goes into the
console and broke it's oil-tight seal.  I need a recommendation for the
sealant/locking adhesive that I need to make the fitting part of the console
again.  To further clarify: the fitting is a male/male threaded nipple that
creates a mechanical seal with the hose on one side and is "glued" in to the
filter housing on the other.  Whatever the sealant ("glue") that was
originally used wasn't up to the torque I had to use to break the hose-end
fitting free...

Oh, and If there is a generic substitute for the original sealant that might
be more available and work as well or better, I'd appreciate that info as
well (e.g.: Locktite 4xx is the right stuff but 3M 323 works fine)

95 BMW M3 just yet, but IF I were to buy a 928, this would be the

luge me with "don't get a 928, it's not a REAL Porsche."  I believe 
that it IS a real Porsche; it  is the most misunderstood, unloved car 
in the world, and will someday be very popular on the collector's 
market.   Drive one sometime, and I think that you will be amazed at 
how much grunt they have, and how well they handle for such a huge 
luxury car.  Whatsmore, an 85 to 89 can be had for peanuts, and can't 
drop too much more in value.  This is the ONLY sports car that I 
would reccomend with an automatic.  Its just too heavy for a clutch, 
and when you punch it down from 4th to 2nd at 80, it will blow you

Response To Craig,

I don't think that any of us would deny that 914, 911, or 959; it doesn't 
matter, being part of the family is what counts.

Actually, I think that the problem exist with folks like you who fail 
to take something with a grain of salt and a twist of humour.  I don't 
know who YOU think YOU are preacher boy, but lighten up buddy. 

Being flamed is all part of the game, but try to avoid 
making it personal.

    I used to have a bra for the car some years ago but ended up selling it.
    Now I just came back from a trip to LA on Hwy 5 and it was bug city.  So,
    does anyone out there have a bra that they want to unload?  I don't
    particularly care if it's used, but as long as it keeps the bugs from being
    splattered on the front of the car.  I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, so

One handy thing I "discovered" while on my honeymoon in Florida is to smear a

I looked at an 89 928 S4 yesterday, which bears sharing with you guys 
and gals.  I decided not to buy it, as I'm not ready to part with my 
95 BMW M3 just yet, but IF I were to buy a 928, this would be the 
one.  It is red/beige,auto,40kmiles,3 piece BBS, new Dunlops, and is 
in MINT condition.  The guy wants $25,500, which is a bit below
the going price.  Call him directly for more imfo  (Ron  at 486-3561, 
or 553-8601)
By the way, I am familiar with all the 928 vs 911 arguments, and have 
owned everything from a 911s to an SC, to a 930, so please don't de- 
luge me with "don't get a 928, it's not a REAL Porsche."  I believe 
that it IS a real Porsche; it  is the most misunderstood, unloved car 
in the world, and will someday be very popular on the collector's 
market.   Drive one sometime, and I think that you will be amazed at 
how much grunt they have, and how well they handle for such a huge 
luxury car.  Whatsmore, an 85 to 89 can be had for peanuts, and can't 
drop too much more in value.  This is the ONLY sports car that I 
would reccomend with an automatic.  Its just too heavy for a clutch, 
and when you punch it down from 4th to 2nd at 80, it will blow you 
into the back seat(such as it is).

On second thought, the 928 vs 911 argument hasn't been had for 
awhile, so maybe we should have it.........

ps  I LOVE my M3, but will be getting out of it pretty soon to step

Hmm. Halon is illegal here... just *murders* the ozone. <shrug>

However, if you don't want to drill in your floor, one can get your
friendly neighbourhood metal-worker to make a bracket that uses the
seat-bolts. It is basically a strip of metal that is bolted to the fire
extinguisher mounting bracket, and then slips in between the seat and the
floor, secured by the seat bolts. Neat and tidy, and easily removed if
necessary...

As per your groaning problem. If it happens when you lighten up on the brakes,

If it happens when you let off completely, then it is more likely a sticky

I had a humorous experience just this weekend.  I was in San Francisco at 
about midnight on Van Ness - which is a three lane each way road.  I pulled up 
to a light with an SFPD officer in a big white car in the far right lane.  A 
big new Cadillac pulled up between us.  The man in the Caddy looked over at me 
and started reving his engine.  I just looked back at him waiting for him to 
notice the officer to his immediate right.  Well... the light turned green and 
the silly wanker floored his Caddy laying some serious rubber.  I looked over 
at the officer with that "I didn't do anything! My clutch is still depressed!" 
look.  The officer looked at me in disbelief, smiled and shook his head, hit 
the light switch and pulled the guy over.  Oh well, I would like to have heard 
that conversation.

According to the Owners Manual, for the '84 Automatic, 80mph is the
red line for second gear (6000 rpm). And the s4 must have a higher
red line...  So it probably has some left at 80 in 2nd. Scary. Too

Something ain't right with the car, and my wallet's getting 
frightened:

I have a '75 911S which runs kinda hot.  It's been running about 200
F on the freeway, 190 F around town (on a 65 F day) since I bought it,
but lately things have gotten worse.  At the last autocross, I was
quite unhappy to see temps of about 240 F coming off a two minute run
(great course, lots of full throttle fun).  It's now running about
190-200 F around town, and will go up to 215 with about 20 seconds of
full throttle acceleration.  The temperature seems to have a fairly 
direct relationship to RPMs--200 F while driving, back to 185 at a 
long light, back up after a block, etc.

This is not what I want to be seeing.  What's the collective 
net.wisdom on this?

The engine has the 11 blade fan, '73 exhuast (no thermal rctrs), SC
cams, and is otherwise pretty stock.  I can feel no lack of power;
the engine runs well and revs nicely (other than getting hot).  I
just changed the oil (Kendal 20W/50 GT Turbo, OEM filter), and it
had a tuneup a few months (1500 miles) ago.

Subject: Las Vegas International Raceway Driving School

Better late than never...

At our April San Diego BMW CCA chapter meeting, we were discussing ways to fill 
the rest of the slots at our upcoming 2-day driving school. After thinking a 
bit, I thought I would extend an invitation to all my favorite people at 
Porschephiles, so...

 - When and Where:

Saturday and Sunday, April 29th and 30th, at the Las Vegas International 
Speedway.  The track is 1.6 miles long, and is used for SCCA and vintage racing.
BTW, this is the NEW track... :)

 - What:

This is a high-performance driving school, held under close supervision by 
trained instructors (we have Porsche trained instructors, not just 
BMW/Mercedes).  We use a race track to provide a safe, controlled environment, 
but this is NOT a racing school; the emphasis will be on safe, smooth, 
controlled driving.

A first-class weekend includes more than just driving.  We have reserved a block
of rooms at the Imperial Palace Hotel, right on the Strip and home of the famous
automobile museum!  An open house on Friday evening in the museum itself (!) and
a gala buffet dinner are included in your registration.  The entry fee is $225 
per driver.

 - Who can attend:

The school is open to members of the BMW CCA and ACA.  Not a member? No problem 
 - we charge you an additional $35 and you BECOME a CCA member. Non-BMW entries 
will be accepted at the discretion of the committee. (No Formula I cars!)

If you'd like more information, email brian.foster@ast.com with your fax number,
and I'll fax you more information, and a registration form.

See you there! Oops... not me, since my wife is due anyday now with our 
firstborn!

Hi,

I was on my way home from South Miami Beach a couple of months ago and was
stopped at a light. This Bronco pulls up next to me and I notice the
passenger looking at my old Targa. Light turns green, we both go and have to
stop at the next light.  The passenger continues staring at my car and as the
light turns green yells "What's the deal with your Porsche?" Having just
washed and waxed my car the day before I innocently answer " it's clean,"
 and I turn onto the causeway. 

A couple of minutes later, my girlfriend says " You know, I don't think they
realized that you car was so old."  Then it dawned on me, that I probably
sounded like an arrogant a**hole. The guy in the Bronco had no idea that 911
were produced 22+ years ago and except for the bumpers and the stainless
steel Targa bar, the car looks like a newer 911.  Next time I'll say " It's a
'73."

Isn't great when people ask you about your car. I'm always willing to answer
any questions they have. An even greater thrill for me is to encounter other
pre-74 911 owners as well as 356 and 914 owners.

Subject: Re: Trail Braking OhmyGod

Larry Herman, in a very well written piece on trailbraking, neglected to
throw in one caveat that I feel is very important.
DON'T try Larry's techniques until you are well along in you high speed
driver education training. Trail Braking is an advanced technique that should
not be used in your initial drivers education events. It is very easy to lose
a car when trail braking. It is a delicate balance between steering input,
braking, and throttle transition. If you don't do it exactly right chances
are you are going for a wild ride.
Larry is an excellent driver and instructor and I am sure he is not teaching
his beginners how to trail brake. I am right about that aren't I Larry? 
At your initial drivers ed events you will be taught the basics of car
control and that will normally be limited to straight line braking. After you
have proven your competence in basic and safe high speed maneuvers then you
will be taught more advanced techniques such as trail braking, throttle
steer, and transitioning. 
Please do not expect to go to your first track event and expect to be be
taught the subtleties of high sped line correction techniques. At least not
if I am your instructor!!!
Larry please support me on this! How about all the other instructors?

Absolutely.  I don't know specifically about the 4 speed auto,
but my 3 speed is about 10mph per 1000rpm in 1st gear.  With
the nasty engine I installed (500+ hp), I adjusted it to shift
at about 8500rpm (85mph in 1st gear) when floored.  A stock
engine should be good for 64mph in 1st (redline).  Even the
late 70's, early 80's engines can squeeze the breath out of
you when down-shifting, although they are a little weak off
the line.  Although I love the 911 series, I don't know of
many cars that are better than the 928 for daily commute
comfort, luxury, and fun factor combined.

Wotta co-incidence... I just fixed this very problem on my '83SC last
weekend (I think!  You can't see me knocking wood as I type this...)
In my case it was a faint groan at low speed with brakes hot, e.g. after a
long hill.  Overhauling my brakes before an upcoming Laguna Seca
Educational Experience, I found *one* piston in *one* front caliper
rotated away from the specified 20 degree position of the cutout.  In
consequence the pad on that piston was worn *slightly* cupped.  I
cleaned the piston, renewed the rubber seal, re-installed in the correct
position, and put in new pads.  I'm waiting for the new pads to bed on
the new discs before I seriously stomp the brakes, but so far the
"groan" is gone, on hills where I used to have it before.  Knock wood.

Anyway check your pads for flatness with a straightedge and check that
your piston cutout is oriented per the manual (I used Haynes).  I
suppose it's possible the piston seal is a contributor if it's old and
hard, and it's easy to change while you're in there.  (An always-welcome
benefit in my case was a higher, harder pedal after the whole thing was
back together.)  Let me know if it works for you...

p.s.: While on the subject I could use some advice from any of the
gurus who've read this far: I bled the brakes using my "Mityvac" hand
vacuum pump.  As always, it sucked more air around the bleed screw than
it did fluid out of the pipe.  I tried the Vaseline-around-the-threads
bit suggested here without avail (and gosh, I sure hate using Vaseline
near brake rubber!).  I wound up using one of the cone-shaped adapters
supplied with the Mityvac, but I had to remove the bleed screw to make
it work.  All's well that ends well (did I mention my rigid, tumescent
brake pedal yet?), but I'm still mystified by how you pros use the
vacuum bleeders...

Subject: My $.02 on Driving War Stories


Some years ago I owned a 914/6 that I autocrossed. I would install the
autocross wheels and tires at home, to save my lady friend the
discomfort of sitting on one of the dirty race wheels/tires.

The 914/6 in this configuration sat very low on the road, in many
instances I could read the casting on truck transfer cases to see if 
it was a Spicer or Eaton. One Sunday morning we were heading from
Danville to Sacramento on I-80 when we happened upon a caravan of
Low-rider Chevies. The 914/6 was so low that all of them had to look
down at us, I doubt if the roof of the 914/6 was higher than the lower
window sill of a '64 Chevy.

Low-riders are a phenom of California, especially the Latino
community. Most are elaborately painted and detailed, the rest aspire
to this. Usually, the seats have been lowered in the car body to let
the occupant to just be able to peer out over the lower window sill. 
All of these cars were so appointed.

Anyway, this guy in one of the '64 Chevies decided he can get lower,
so he raises the car with his hydraulic ride-height adjuster to the
top of the stops, then he slams the thing all the way to the
ground. This is serious, serious enough that he CONTACTS the ground,
making sparks fly out all over. This is at 60 MPH, mind you. The guy
repeats this 4 times, spraying sparks each time. He stops, either
running out of floorboards to spark or battery to run the hydraulics.

Finally, he pulls up along side and gives us a thumbs up for having
such a cool low-rider. We won at the autocross, wondering how a
slammed Chebbie would have done.

Subject: RE:Hot Running 911



Dirk,

Here is a list of things you might want to check (some may be obvious):

     1. Check the oil level (not enough to cool the engine?)
     2. Check the oil cooler(s) for leaves or other debris
     3. Check the spark advance (too far advanced produces more heat)
     4. Check for a lean condition (pull a plug and look for white
electrode)
     5. Check your fan belt (a loose fan belt can slip and loose cooling
effect)
     6. Check Your Oil Pressure (low oil pressure = less
cooling/lub.=BIGproblem!)
     7. Perhaps you have a kinked oil line (not likely but worth a look)
     8. Check the oil sump for metal particles (maybe you have a bigger
problem)

Given what you said about high rpm's being related (maybe) you might first
suspect the spark advance (higher rpm's means more  spark advance to a
point).
These are only my suggestions don't let them scare you, there may be others.
If I can offer any added assistance please let me know.

GOOD LUCK!

Reply #2 - Yes, I concur with the advice above. Mount extinguisher on floor
just ahead of driver's seat. Put seat all the way forward to find the
correct spot. The extinguisher is easy to get, and I never had a problem
with it getting in my way because it is out of the way where you step into
the car (911). About 7 years ago, I took my street car (924S) on the track,
and mounted the extinguisher on the back floor, but this is not good. Gets
in the way of anybody that may ride there.

I haven't tried it but according to the owners manual, automatic transmission
curves, the 928 hits 80 at about 5600 RPM in second gear.  My 928 redlines 
from 6000 - 7000 RPM so I guess the answer to your question would be "yes."

Hi all,

If P-cars are supposed to be driven by "bad boys and girls" why is it I am
almost always allowed to merge, even cut-off other drivers with nary a
complaint from them?  Has this ever happened to anyone?  I think that
unlike BMW, which is a damn good car though it must be the most "hated" car
on the road, the Porsche enjoys, dare I say it, respect among the motoring
public.  This brings me to the question: where does porsche as a marque and
its individual models rank in the great automobile heirarchy?

The grass is always greener... :-)

Let's put it this way. When they brought photo-radar in, my average speed
(keeping up with the faster traffic) thru Toronto dropped from 140 km/hr (er,
um, 87.5 mph) right down to 100 km/hr (62.5 mph). *Everyone* was going the
same speed. It was like driving on the Ohio turnpike. Last time I was
there, the speed seemed to have creeped back up to 130 (just over 80 mph),
but with wild drops in speed, if someone thought they saw a Chevy Astrovan
(that's what the photo-radar units are in).

There are certain OPP detachments that are well-known for their rigid
enforcement, but I suspect your route may miss these (Milton, just west of
Toronto, for example). The OPP at Dutton (just west of London) were also
known for their annoying enforcement a few years ago, but I don't know
about now.

Don't forget that drivers don't get points on their licence unless their
ticket is for 15km over the limit here (i.e., 115 km/hr - 72 mph). Thus
one has to work *very* hard to get a ticket at those speeds.

Also, with your Florida plates, I suspect many cops just won't bother with
you... <shrug>

I had a 78, GTS, red, black from 78-81. Also had a moustache and am a white

injection which the 77's didn't have so it was better than the carb version.   
 
It used a quart of oil every 200 miles so at 9,000 or so Ferrari put a new 
motor in it.  I broke it in carefully and after 3-4000 miles it used a quart 
every 2-300 miles.  The dealer was only able to mumble something about Ferrari

Subject: Re: Fire Extinguishers

Dear Jim:

The "metal to metal fastening" of fire extinguishers requires that a metal
bracket be screwed into a metal part of the car, as opposed to fiberboard or
other materials (the rear seat backs are many times fiberboard).  There may
be carpet between the extinguisher bracket and the anchoring metal as long as
the screws are long enough to provide a secure anchor.  The metal inspection
plate on the 911 is not only acceptable, but the location is also desirable.
 The extinguisher is accessible to the driver belted in the seat.  Some of
the other locations, while acceptable, may not be as desirable, because the
driver may not be able to reach the extinguisher while belted in the seat.
 Seat belt latches have been known to  jam.  That is why all SCCA and
Professional Flaggers carry a large knife.

This location on a 911 is acceptable to NNJR (I am a tech inspector and run te
ch at many events).  It is also acceptable, to the best of my knowlege,  to
CVR, Metro and Zone 1 ( I have done tech for all these).
 
Stable Energies of Garfield, NJ and I have been working on "no drill"
mounting brackets that attach to the passenger seat.  These brackets have
just gone into production and will be available soon.  We do have them
available currently for non-power seats.

If you have any other questions, or I may be of further service, please give
me a shout.

Subject: Blaupunkt radio wiring, help

Help, I purchased a 85 911 Carerra a few months ago.  Before I purchased it,
the seller told me he would replace the radio with the original Blaupunkt,
Monterey series (SRQ23).  Which at the time was no problem.  The radio works
fine, but when they installed the other radio & then reinstalled the
Blaupunkt they disconnected the fader switch that is in the center console
by the shifter.  This was done because the other radio had the fader built
into the radio.  I pulled apart the console & found that the female portion
of the connector jack is gone.  Does anyone out in Porschefile land know how
the wiring is suposed to go.  There is 6 wires coming out of the male jack
from the fader switch, red, brown, blue, green, white, and black.  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail if possible, thanks in advance

Thanks for the clarification on the "metal-to-metal" issue.

I'm interested in the no-drill bracket.  Will it fit our 944S2 power
seat?  I currently use three hose clamps to attach it to our harness bar
(from Stable, of course :-) )  This might even be something that Shannon

This reminds me of some advice I once heard about how to arrive at
work in a good mood: yield the right of way to someone on your way in.
This does 2 things: 1) lets you do something nice and feel like a good
guy/gal; and 2) puts you in control of the situation... the other person
is virtually compelled to accept your "offer".  Even the baaadest Oakley
Factory Pilot!  It works, and gives Porsche a little good publicity
into the bargain.

And if it doesn't, you can always drop down two gears and listen to that

Speaking of letting other cars in front of you, I go to school in New York and 
make the trip to home (MA) regularly.  This past weekend traffic was heavy for 
the Easter holidays and an 18 wheeler was trying to get into the left hand lane
which was not movingfast enough for him.  Of course no one in the left hand 
lane was letting him in.  Who wants to travel behind a truck in bad traffic?  
It was twilight and I had my headlights on so I flashed him my brights to 
signal that I was letting him cross over.  He didn't move for a while because I
think he was in semi-disbelief.  Finally, he saw that I was serious and moved 
ahead of me.
    To make a long story short, as soon as he
cleared a few slow moving vehicles on the right lane, he moved back into it and
gave me a long horn blast -- I think it was a thank you . . .

I'm no instructor, but having done 100 fast kilomiles in my 911, I'll speak up
to *strongly agree*.  My reaction on reading Larry's piece was identical to
Jerry's: nice job, good points, but Don't Try This At Home, at least in a  
911.  It doesn't have a friction CIRCLE, it has a friction EGG!

I only trailbrake in SLOW auto-x corners myself.  Never on 
the track.  I've felt OK about this ever since I heard 
an interview with some famous 911 racer (forget
who) and he said "in ze 911 ve must make all za braking before za

My kudos to Larry's trailbraking article. Kids, don't try this at home!
Generally speaking as an insrtuctor, if the student is demonstrating
proficiency at smoothness, balance, learning where to be on the track,
braking, cornering, and accelerating ,etc. the instructor will initiate
discussion of trail braking and pick a corner where it can relatively safely be applied, and at a lowered speed.

I will allow the student's ability to learn and develop to set the
pace of teaching various skills. I have had a *few* students (I can count
them on one hand) who were able to discuss trail braking by a late
session on the second day. Typically these students had a related skill
set (motorcycle racers, sprint car drivers, go kart racers, etc) and
were progressing very quickly. 

Then I've also had some students for many schools who were not ready
to learn to trail brake.

There is one skill I advocate learning on the street first, which can
help tremendously on the track: proper heel & toe technique.

Keep the car on the black stuff, the grass is actually faster!

I have noticed this as well, although I'm not big on cutting people off.
I like to drive fast, and my car looks aggressive, but I don't weave
through traffic or drive too close to anyone.  I drive faster than most
others out there.  Then again, this is CA!!  In LA, I was a rolling
chicane until I drove 75mph+.  People don't get offended by pure
speed (within limits), and really seem amazed if you yield right
of way sometimes ;^)

I also own a BMW although it's a plain stock 528e which seems to
attract no abuse.  (except from my "friends" who thought I really sold
out when I bought that car ;^)  My answer is:  I'd rather have an old
BMW as a family car than a new Taurus)

I have driven both cars *with CA plates* up to Seattle and
expected to be run off the road, but simple driving courtesy
seems to go a long way???

OTOH, when I was in NYC once, working in the Mariott Marquis all
day, I stepped out onto Times Square in the evening and the moment
my foot touched the pavement, a street guy was inches from my face
shouting: "You!!  Motherf***er!!  Get your Golden Boy Ass back to Florida!!"
I thanked him and was on my way  (not back to Florida, thank you, I've

Jerry,
  You are 1000000% right (which we all know is a strange position to find
yourself in). As usual, Larry's article was excellent but trail braking at
your first - or second - or ... event is one of the best ways to a) find out
for sure just how your insurance company feels about track events and b)
just how nice the fellow at the body shop is, especially in a 911.  My novice
students get to practice getting their braking done before the wheel turns.
For your first events you will have far more to learn then that.  We all
like to think we are wonderfull drivers but driving at higher then normal
speeds for a sustained period is a whole different world.  As my first
instructor, Jerry Nelson (who was racing IMSA at the time) said, "Learn to
be smooth, speed will follow".  Spinning off the track is not graceful.  Or
in the words of the famous Silver Streak (aka Mz Jerry), "Don't color
outside the lines children".

When I last looked at a position in the Bay.Area (the one that made my
wife's first question about any new prospective job "this had better
NOT be in California", btw), we were out for a week or so house
hunting, etc. Texas has a *LARGE* state funded initiative that's run
for close to 25 years around the theme "Drive Friendly". Many of us
who have only been ever driven in this period take it as gospel, including
my wife.  (Other of us believe in the unofficial non-funded traffic
initiative "Why Do You THINK I Have A Gun Rack, Dumbshit", but that's
another story...)

So Day One in NorCal, she's tooling up 880 from San Jose towards Fremont
to see a real estate agent, and this guy wants in her lane. She slows 
down to let him over, and it just about precipitates a multi-car
pileup. Tires squealing, people driving all over the road narrowly missing
each other, etc. He later ran up along side her at her exit, and told her
"I'm sorry about that -- I thought it was some sort of trick."

Sigh.

Well, I could not bring myself to buying another CD unit

checked out OK on the local PCA tech. chairman's  '73 911
my spirits were magically lifted.

I later discovered a short on my spade connector to the

Thanks to Reid Zeigler who diagnosed this particular gremlin for me
to check.  So there you have it folks, with the factory manuals ($$),
Haynes, and assorted other references, this list alone saved me
$100+ bucks.  My check will be in the mail to Unka Bart.

Jim, 

Under no circumstances should you use "hose clamps" to mount a
fire extinguisher.  Hose clamps are for hoses.

Just imagine what kind of havoc would happen when you take 3 or 4 pounds of
mass and hurl it at your body at 60 mph.  That's just what will happen 
when you come to a sudden (uncontrolled) stop and those hose clamps 
fail to restrain the extinguisher.

In our region, and at the Zone 1 Track event, your mounting procedure is a
cause for failing tech inspection and eventual disqualification from the 
event.

Mount it properly, so that it contributes to your safety, not detracts from
it.

Good luck,

If you're getting a good enough price, then go for it.  Unfortunately, a
good enough price for this car is about $12000.

And, plan on having $5000 or so in a war chest to fix anything that might go
wrong.

That having been said, the block of the motor is good for 200K miles,
without any problem.

Subject: Re: Trail Braking in a 944

As a PCA Driver Ed instructor, I have to agree that trail braking is an
advanced technique, to be approached gingerly after all the basic skills of
driving have been deeply learned.

The basic driving skills, as I see them, are:

1) Braking in a straight line, at the limit, consistently, and smoothly.

2) Turning properly, at the proper turnin, using the entire track, tracking
   out properly, balancing the car using the throttle, and smoothly.

3) Accelerating properly, at the appropriate moment in the turn, and
   smoothly.

4) Shifting smoothly, choosing the proper gear for the upcoming situation,
   and engaging the clutch, all done smoothly.

5) Proper hand, foot, eye and brain usage, all done smoothly.

Please note that I stress smoothness, that's the key.

Trailbraking can be done with more confidence in a 944 than a 911 by a less
experienced driver, but a well driven 911 will often be able to beat a less
well driven 944 at the track.

It is also my considered opinion that most 944 cars go off the course nose
first, while most 911 cars go off the course tail first. You do the math!

Subject: Strange people

Hmmm....

Strange reactions.  

My '84 944 used to have custom plates that read IBEQUIK (previous owner's idea, 
and in California the plates went with the car).  I used to get asked regular 
"How quick are you?"  Usually just grinned.

Or like the time I pulled up in front of a friend's house, and a kid at the curb 
(about 7 or 8 years old) DROPPED his bike and started yelling "WHOA!  WHOA!  WHOA!" 
as if Michael Jordan had just pulled up.  Just a kid, but it felt godd nonetheless.

Or the hotel bellhop, who as he was helping me get my bags out of the back, 
couldn't resist telling me that I had "Excellent taste in cars, sir!"  VBG!

Then there's the people at work who think I must be making lots more than they 
are, since I have a Porsche.  I try to tell them that their Honda is worth three
times what my Porsche is, but they just stare at me like I was an idiot.  "How
can a Honda be worth more than a Porsche?"

Of course, my '84 doesn't look like it's 11 years old.  Sometimes, if I'm feeling
real mean, I'll even tell someone what year it is, just to watch their reaction.

Somebody mentioned minivans.  My daily driver is a minivan, and if you want to
see aggressive driving sometime, try driving one of these.  People come around 
me on the right and try to cut in front of "that slow idiot in the van"  all
the time, only to be surprised that I'm just one in a long line of slow cars 
following some guy in a Ford.  Here's a clue folks - if my van is in the left 
lane going slow, there ain't no open road in front of me or I'd be eatin' it up.

One thing I have noticed though - I have a habit of making eye contact with and
smiling at the ladies (just a smile - I'm happily living in sin with the love of
my life).  In the van, or even my old Datsun (yes - it's that old) beater, I'll
often get a smile back.  In the Porsche, it's strictly the cold shoulder.  Guess
women see a Porsche and automatically assume the guy driving it has gold chains.

I already added to it! I have a pretty neat 2 liter that I 
THOUGHT I bought to resell so I can put some $ in my 911S.

But the car is so much fun to drive that I'm trying to find
a way to keep it. Let's see, sell my wife's Sable, and she
can drive my Jeep GC. But when I need the Jeep to trailer my
911, I can let my sister take the 914 (which she loves too)
and my wife can drive my sisters' Grand Cherokee...
Then I need a salt car for the winter...

I will offer it for sale now, and if nobody is interested I will
keep it.

It is pretty clean, needs several small things though.
I don't think it ever had rust repaired- it is 
much cleaner than the '73 that I had in '80 ! It even has a nice 
Momo steering wheel, Bursch muffler, Yoko 008R tires
on the Fuchs forged wheels (5), so its almost ready for 
autocross or track! 

The car has all the good options : sway bars, console, 
appearance group, etc. Interior is brownish, exterior yellow.

Needs some work and a good tune-up (sat for a while in a garage).
Has only about 103,000 miles. It's a late '73 model (June). 
Camshaft was replaced a few years ago, and engine re-assembled.
The car came from Atlanta 5 years ago so is very rust-free, 
no winters while it was in Connecticut.

Needs : Some paint work (previous owner sprayed primer
inside rear trunk and on some paint nicks and scratches).
Radio was removed (stolen?).
Needs a piece of metal welded in the front trunk where the removed
A/C condenser was (easy job, not structural).
Needs a tune up, car has been sitting in a garage for many months.
But engine feels pretty strong, idles fine.
Seems to leak oil a bit.
Needs one rear trunk hinge re-welded (very common).
Needs pedal bushings replaced (I've had to do this on all older Porsches).

I could sell it as it is for $3000 (firm). I also have a complete set of
factory manuals in mint condition that cost $300. This could be
worked into the deal somehow. I also have a nice set of 
styled-steel 5 1/2 x 15 wheels which could be thrown in, and 
maybe with some bald autocross tires.

Yes, I can see it now.  The pseudo news shows (60 Minutes, 20/20, etc)
would show cars clips from Road Warrior while the voiceover says
how many children are killed by cars every year.  When the SCCA
becomes politically involved to save the sports cars they will be branded as
the "killer car nuts" and shills for the "car lobby".  
"These guys want to keep legal the very cars that are killing our kids!."  
"Nobody needs a car that will do double the speed limit."  
"If only one child is saved..."
"Who will stop the massacre ?"
Politicians who ride public transportation will sponsor bills to outlaw the 
"killer cars".  They will be portrayed as the prefered vehicle for
criminals to use as "getaway" cars.  After a while, people will
expect the safer cars to protect them from harm and sue the
auto manufacture when this doesn't happen [I guess that's old news].
Bills will be introduced to levy a %1000 tax on the premium gasoline used
by the "killer cars" to pay for the "carnage they cause".  
The actual definition of "killer car" would be broad enough when
written into law to cover most anything.  Things like overhead cams,
more than two valves per cylinder, tire aspects of less than 50, etc.
would classify the car as a "killer car".

Yes it sounds nuts, but some of us have heard it all before.

Unfortuneately; as we all remember from Driver's Ed, "Driving is a Privilege"

and not protected by that pesky Constitution.

 vrooom,

P.S. I prefer the traffic engineer's definition of a good driver: "One
that does not impede the flow of traffic." :-)

Rich,
The engine scares me a lot.  175HP is way too much power for a 914 engine
to put out and still be reliable.  How many miles are on this engine?  When Stan
talks of 914 race engines with this kind of power, he talks about *HOURS* of
operation.  I don't think it would last a whole lot longer with street use.  Am I right, Stan?

From your description, the rest of the car does sound good though.  Sounds like
the mechanic/owner took pride in this car.  You might want to make sure that the
paint job isn't hiding any bondo repairs, just to make sure.

Subject: 911: Help with humming noise from rear

Well after some help from the list on my question about rear
wheel bearings yesterday, and some hints that the clicking emanating
from my left rear wheel might also be a CV joint, I took the car
to the dealer this morning.

It turns out that the clicking is barely audible and the dealer says
both the bearings and the CV joints are fine.

BUT.....

The reason I thought I had a problem is that at any speed over about 45mph
I get a humming from the rear (on the left side).   We took the car for a
drive and the mechanic heard the noise.  He then spent half an hour trying
to figure out what it was.   The noise is kind of a low/quiet hum that sounds
as if something is resonating.  The mechanic tells me that he thinks it is
transmission noise and even if he tears down the transmission he may not be
able to find the problem.  His suggestion is to just monitor the noise
and bring the car back to him if it gets any worse.

With almost a thousand porschephiles out there I was thinking maybe someone
else might have encountered this problem and might be able to give me some
clues.

I am particularly worried as I want to do some auto-xing and track days
this year.  Obviously I don't want to do this if the problem with the
car might be a danger to myself or others.

Anyone got any ideas what this might be.

Considering the thread about speed limits and legislation and the

currently there are two bills in the house of representative that

Subject: Re: Fire Extinguisher Mounting

Dear George:

What is wrong with using three (3) stainless steel Zebra style hose clamps to
mount a fire extinguisher bracket to a roll cage/bar?  These hose clamps,
when tightened,  are stronger than the quick release straps that hold the
extinguisher to the bracket.  If you don't like that setup, how do you
recommend attaching an extinguisher to the roll bar?

Inquiring minds want to know.  I just realized that the heading sounds a littl
e kinky.

      Dirk, these temps are no problem and are pretty normal. 180-220
   is the correct temp to run at, only worry if you are sustaining over
   230 or 240.

      Two things that will help;
    1. Use straight 40 or 50 weight oil in the summers. I have no idea
       why this works, but temps will slightly drop.
    2. Get a fender mounted oil cooler. I'd personally only bother with
       the factory loop cooler (you won't need any more from what
       you are reporting). Don't even consider rubber lines and cheap
       aftermarket coolers, the "SC" factory setup is good. The lines and
       fittings will depend on whether you have a single inlet or dual
       inlet muffler and heat exchangers, but all this stuff is available.

Subject: Re: Blaupunkt radio wiring, Help

Howard,
	Your problem is not to do with the Blaupunkt, since the fader switch is 
probably not made by them.  It is not easy to find out what each wire is without 
a fully intact example.
	However, *IF* you can get access to an oscilloscope and/or a voltmeter, 
or even an old speaker you can get the answer you need.
	There wil be three or four wires going from the radio to the fader, 
depending on whether or not the speakers share ground.  Usually the gound is 
common even if there are four wires out of the radio...  I am assuming that you 
have identified the input to the fader.  Hook the radio up to the fader, and 
MAKE SURE NONE OF THE OUTPUT WIRES TOUCH TOGETHER.  (IF THEY DO YOU **WILL** 
BLOW YOUR RADIO UP)  Take the oscilloscope and measure the signal coming out of 
each wire, while you change the balance fully from left to right and fader from 
front to back.  This will get you all the signal wires. (using a bit of 
deduction)  
	You can also find the signal wires by connecting the old speaker to the 
speaker ground (Note: speaker ground, not general ground) on the *input* side of 
the fader, and connecting the other connection of the speaker to each of your 
output wires after setting fader fully one way and the balance over one way, say 
fader full back and balance full left.  As soon as you hear sound from the 
speaker, you have identified the signal wire for the left back speaker. And so 
on.  The ground identification may be more difficult depending on what type of 
crossover the fader has built in, but normally there is a system to the way the 
wires come out of the unit.  If not, measure the resistance between all the non-
signal wires coming out of the fader unit, the two front grounds should have no 
resistance between them, and it doesn't matter which of the two gounds you then 
use with each of the two front signal wires. Same for the rears and extra's (you 
did say 6 in total.)  The extras are normally run from the front speakers, so 
there's a good chance there will be two signal wires for the front settings on 
the fader for each channel, the extras usually fit in there.
	Let me know how you get on, or if it's not clear.  Conversely you can 
send me the fader, I will re-solder DIN plugs back on for your speaker plugs, 
and label the outputs for you.  Have done a few...
	Happy hunting,   Jan

No, but I was blown off by a Citroen 2000GS on the Autobahn, once. The 2000GS
was the big coupe with the Maseratti V-6 in it. Don't know what the top speed

The story that William mentioned is what Rush based this great song on.
It was published in Road and Track (?) in the late 70's or so. The story is 
much better than the song lyrics. I think it was titled "A nice morning

Rush acknowledged this story on their album. Maybe Pete A. would remember

A civilian teacher I knew at Ramstein AB had one of those things. he boasted that
he could make it to Heidelberg, a distance of about 45 miles in less than a half

Memories.... I remember when I was in high school going to RUSH's Moving
Pictures tour.  When they played "Red Barchetta", they also showed a little
movie that was kind of cool.  It started out as a time vs frequency plot that
went with the music, the plot then flashed and became a red convertible, which
proceeded to rotate and drive on a road.  Lots of driving at high speed
follows, then as the song comes to an end, the view moves from the cockpit of
the car up to the rear view mirror, where a set of flashing  red lights can be
seen....
don't recall all of the lyrics, but some of it includes, i think.:
Wind...in my hair
Shifting and drifting....
Adrenalin surge....

Correct.  "Red Barchetta" is based on "A Nice Morning Drive" by
Richard S. Foster, Road & Track, November 1973, pp.148-150.

Bill,

Fact 1: Approximately 400 accidents were caused last year in California by
vehicles moving too slow.

Fact 2: 47 accidents were caused last year by vehicles moving to fast.

Conclusion:  Speed, in and of itself, does not increase the likely hood of an
accident.  Speed actually decreases your likely hood of an accident.  (for a
variety of reasons) Speed only determines the severity of an accident if one
occurred.

Yours, is the same logic used by gun control lobbyists to ban assault rifles
when more people are killed by knives and bare hands.

Hypothesis 1:  The perceived danger to the public of *anything* has nothing to
do with the actual threat to public life and property, but with the outrage
associated with that threat.  (Hundreds of examples available on request)

Conclusion 2:  People attempt to ban and/or restrict what outrages them,
regardless of the actual threat to the public.

people didn't exactly gawk.  At the time I also had a 58 Vette, red, white

of the corner of their eyes, not really wanting to acknowledge the car but 
wondering who was driving.  Also, got flipped off and cut off just about 
everytime out in the Fcar.  Best policy seemed to be to stick my nose up int 
air and ignore 'em.  As if they weren't even there or at least weren't worthy 
of acknowledgement.  that seemed to deliver the appropriate message. 
 
Cops weren't a problem.  My 930 drove the cops wild but they didn't seem to 
care about the Fcar.  That really says something for the Porsche, eh?  
Interestingly enough I soldthe Ferrari and got a 930. It's a lot more

Bill:  You asked about my experience with the Ferrari 308 as you've been "half 
dreaming about getting one".  Couldn't find your email address in the post so 
I'll do it to the list in case any one else has similar fantasies.

I had a 78, GTS, red, black from 78-81. Also had a moustache and am a white 
guy so people used to shout "Hey Magnum " at me all the time.  The car was fun 
to drive, very neutral, had good power, expensive to tune and service.  It had 
injection which the 77's didn't have so it was better than the carb version.

It used a quart of oil every 200 miles so at 9,000 or so Ferrari put a new 
motor in it.  I broke it in carefully and after 3-4000 miles it used a quart 
every 2-300 miles.  The dealer was only able to mumble something about Ferrari 
owners usually having another car for everyday use like a Mercedes, implying 
that they weren't driven every day and what the hell did I expect for 34K 
anyway.  Message was that it was supposed to be a rich guys weekender car and 
who the hell was I to dare drive it a lot.  So, I started buying Castrol by the 
case.

Put about 30K on the car with no major problems.  Weird electronics at times, 
but it did have a nice exhaust tone.

I did enjoy the car. The best part was that you could take the top off and 
drive 100 mph and not mess up your hair.  It had great aerodynamics.  I think 
the fact is that most people did use them as a weekend car so there are a lot 
of low mileage ones around.  Also they are relatively cheap. I can't think of 
another car that has the same impact as a red 308 for under 30K.

My bet would be that it's a good car for $ appreciation.  Don't let the 
Ferrari puristas discourage you from 308 with the idea that it's a cheap 
Ferrari and therefore not collectable.  Remember the Dino246GT's that everyone 
said were really Fiats.  Try finding a nice one for under 50K today.    So, if 
you're only gonna go around once, do the gusto, go for it, just do it and go 
find one you like.

On 4/18 Sean asked:

WHAT?!?!!  Why haven't you mentioned this before on the list?  What

 - Sean  '80 9

On 4/18 Matt asked:

>What year is your car?  What engine did you install?  How / How
>easy was the transmission mod?


My 928 started as a US '80 with 3 speed automatic.  The original
engine had a "melt down" (overheated in seconds, burst the
coolant tank, siezed a pulley on the front--it was ugly!).  I
replaced that engine with a professionally built racing engine
based upon an '82 Euro 928.  It retains the big valve heads and
the Euro block, but all other components were replaced with high
performance parts.  It was very well balanced, and should be
good for between 9,000 and 10,000 rpm (although wear would be
tremendous).  It has very radical, long duration cams, and
will not idle for more than about 10 seconds in drive (I shift
to neutral at stop lights).  It gets 9 mpg on the highway, and
7 mpg in city driving (tradeoffs).

I had the original transmission rebuilt to help it live peacefully
with the engine, but my mechanic says it probably won't last.
The adjustment I was refering to is simply the shift linkage
tension adjustment on the side of the transmission.  Tighten
the cable for higher shifts and longer duration in low gears.
To get it to shift harder (less slip, to protect the trans.),
turn the set screw on the side of the transmission (I don't
remember which way).

Subject: Cooling a 2.7 911S

I have 77 911S and have completely rebuilt the engine, so I know it's in
reasonable shape. It's timed correctly and meets emissions.Has an 11 blade fan
(air conditioning but no drive belt). The ambient temp. makes a big, big
difference to its operating temp. This is particularly noticable in as in
Phoenix, mornings can be 35 degF in Winter and 90 degF in Summer. The car had a
fsctory loop cooler but this was not suficeient to keep it cool in the Summer
and certainly not if you work the engine. The best solution is to use a high
efficiency cooler in the fender or front valance. Not wanting to spend $500
just for the cooler I made a cooler from two VW aftermarket coolers in parallel
and mounted it in place of the loop. This arrangement keeps the engine at a
reasonable temp. in Summer but I still would not want to race.

My tame independent Porsche shop tells me this pretty normal for the 2.7
engine.

At one point I did try misting water into the cooling shroud and it works but
don't try it with anything but distilled water.

Any other ideas?

It's pretty easy to argue against.

First, an example:

Around 1973 there was a "well intentioned" law (regulation/decision?)
that all cars should have the seat belt fastened before they could
be started.  How could anyone argue against such a good idea?

The stupidity was appearant to more people after a woman 
was raped because she could not start her car and get away.

Second, why do you feel that this decision should be made for us?
Personally, I'm a big boy and can make my own decisions and be 
responsible for the consequences of these decisions.

Now let's examine your points:

Dangerous to self.  Okay, driving fast is more dangerous.  So what?  
Do we also ban *all* dangerous activities?  Gee, now we're all 
the same...

Dangerous to others.  So is driving a large car.  Passengers in a 
large car are safer partly because of the increased danger to the 
other car in a collision.  Do the momentum calculation before 
replying.  We can all drive Yugos and, yup, all be the same...

More gas.  Yes, it uses more gas.  So what?  Do we ban all 
activities that use unnecessary gas *or* other hydrocarbon 
products?  Gee, now we're all the same... (and bored)

Wasted police.  I always feel good knowing the police have nothing 
better to do with their time than write speeding tickets [he says 
with tounge firmly in cheek].  Besides, they only get wasted if 
they step in front of the fast car.  Most of them know better.  ;-)

More $$.  Get real.  Their *my* dollars.  I buy the car.  I buy 
the gas.  I buy the insurance.  I pay for the roads.  Maybe all my  
money should all be taken away from me because I obviously am not 
capable of using it "correctly."  Then, yup, you guessed it, we 
can all be the same...

Bill, you obviously have pushed some of my buttons.  I realize your 
intentions are good.  However, please remember what road is paved 
with good intentions.

Crutchfield Electronics (Ohio) should be able to sell you an adapter
that will connect your new radio to your old harness.

Aftermarket radios don't have the connectors in them for a couple of
reasons:  They cost money, they take up space inside the radio, and
they're different for every car.

Hi Rodger and Porschephiles,

I know what you mean about the BMW image. Here in New York, the streets 
are crawling with the Bimmer 3-series, most of which are decked out in 
full "drug dealer" trim as yours (no offense). It is a shame because the 
car is really nice, my friend has an uncustomized '84 318i which runs well.

Definately, (sp?) not a good image car.

I'm not sure my exhaust is original. I don't have thermal reactors under the
heads. I do have a longitudinal cylinder between the two three branches and the
single input silencer. I belive the two reactor set up was CA only and CA had
an EGR. My 77 only has an air pump, which is disconnected except for emmision
tests.

'round here (North CA) the thing to do is get rims with an ungodly offset so

Well one day i am tooling around in my old neighberhood Brooklyn NY
and i smell gas, well i say i will just wait till i get home and take
a good look around see where that gas is leaking from.
At this point i am less then a mile from home..
I turn a corner step on the gas and the car starts to stall.!?
I floor it and suddenly people are all yelling:
YOUR CARS ON FIRE, YOUR CARS ON FIRE, 
I look in the rearview mirror and sure enough flames are shooting up
I look for a place to pull over and i see a big pile of sand from a 
constuction job, i pull over there jump out pull out my small fire
extinguisher (heard this happens) and slap the engine cover to open it.
if finally opens i dump the extinguisher and the fire continues!
Next i grab handfulls of sand and begin dumping it in the engine compartment,
(fuel injected)  eventually the fire goes out.
For my stupidity at not pulling over sooner I pushed her home.
Four hours of vacuuming and rewiring and she was back on the road.
I now keep a big fire extinguisher in any 914 i am driving...

removed the exhaust and then replaced it, and PERHAPS I didn't get it on 
perfectly tightly at the exhaust manifold, which was difficult for me to 
see with my primitive lift equipment.  Anyway, I've noticed the car is 
now backfiring loudly when coming off the throttle and appears also to be 
running rich.  I have tried to lean the engine out by adjusting the 
pressure manifold adjusting screw but have exhausted its maximum with no 
effect.  Is the backfiring an exhaust gap or an effect of the rich 
running engine?  HELP!!!!   Thanks!     Rick   quartz@minerva.cis.yale.edu

Would be interesting to also include the year, make and model of the car, if
car is stock, modified and to what extent,  where the high speed run was made,
and how verified, speedo, timing gates or radar gun.  Comments about the

You miss the point completely.  The answer is NOT to regulate speed, but 
rather to provide a place for the public to drive there automobiles at 
the speeds they were designed to be SAFELY driven.  Furthermore, even 
without such a place, I can SAFELY (15 yrs of driving with NO accidents, 
scrapes, etc.  not even a close call) drive my car at speeds far in 
excess of 70MPH (traffic, road, and weather conditions permitting).  And as

Hi All,

Okay, its time to buy a battery and start my '66 912 up after
many years of storage (thanks for the suggestions on an earlier
request for a check out process).  So, I measured the battery area
and plan on going to Sears and getting a 12v battery that fits the area.

Seems rather simple, is there anything else I should consider?

Subject: Brake Fluid Overflow

Does anyone else have a problem pushing brake fluid out the vent pipe at
track events?  The car is an 86 911 w/ 930 brake calipers & master cylinder
and evidence of the overflow can be seen under the car (wet on left front
suspension pieces and drops by right front wheel at rest). 

I'm not boiling fluid and the fluid/pedal level drops enough in one run
group to trip the brake light. The beginning fluid level has no effect on
the problem and I have tried routing the overflow up above the level of the
resivoir.

Any ideas?

TDC mark, it moves OUT about (guess) 1/8"!!!  And at 180 around from
TDC, it moves back in to where it was.
        It was doing this before I took the flywheel off--but I had

Subject: 944T Cooling System Question

I have a question concerning the cooling system of my 1988 944T
with 64K miles. When driven above 40 MPH or so the temperature
gauge stays fast on the lower tic mark (which I assume to be at
the bottom of the operating range). However, when in traffic or
even just stopped at a light for any time at all (like at an
interstate exit) the gauge rises to the upper tic mark. I can
hear the fan relay(s) operate and bring the temperature down to
maybe the middle of the gauge. When the fan(s) stop running the
gauge rises to the upper tic mark. I have never seen it above the
upper tic mark. The water pump and thermostat were replaced about
14 months ago. Like some 928-related posts here, I have noticed
that the temperature gauge will tend to read slightly higher when
there is more drain on the battery. Is the general behaviour of
the temperature gauge typical for this car?

Subject: Now a word from the Author

To preface, I started my postings on driving when I got caught up in the
thread on 944s vs. 911s and how 911s are such evil handling beasts.  My
response was to illustrate how I can brake and turn-in with my Carrera, a
maneuver that the general public thinks is impossible.  Then I was asked to
explain the technique of trailbraking.  After reading the admonishments from
Jerry, Larry, Jim, and Ed concerning the potential "misuse" of my explanations
 on trailbraking, I have to agree...they are absolutely right.  The
techniques of trailbraking are strictly for expert drivers, people with at
least 30 or 40 track events under their belts.  And even then, most will not
be able to do it well.  It requires consummate car control, and is definitely
a delicate balancing act.  In case there's any ambiguity, I'll state it
again:

==> TRAILBRAKING IS FOR EXPERTS!  <==

If you are a novice...Don't even think about it.  In the future, I will
preface any driving information with the group that it is directed to:

       Novice (drivers with less than 10 events)
       General (drivers with between 10 & 30 events)
       Advanced (drivers with over 30 events)

Like any other sport, driving a car on the track has a long learning curve.
 Just because you can drive on the street, that doesn't make you a race car
driver.  Just like throwing a baseball doesn't make you a major league
pitcher.  As a novice, you have to start with the basics, but the basics will
get you 90% of your speed.  Tricks like trailbraking are for those looking
for that last 10%.  Matter of fact, if you start playing with the last 10%
too soon in your "career", it could mess up your learning curve, and you
might not learn the basic 90% properly.  I have always been amazed by the
number of people with 15 or 20 track events, generally white group drivers,
who have developed major flaws in their styles, and have to be "retrained".
 Because of their flawed style, they cannot continue to improve.  It can be
quite frustrating.

So here's a MAJOR TIP for you novices; learn how to come out of the corner
properly.  Forget everything else for now; brake easily, turn-in gently, find
the apex, and come off the corner like a bat out of hell.  That skill will
get you 90% of your speed, and if mastered, will make you faster than 90% of
the other drivers.  It's that simple.  A renowned tennis player and coach,
Vic Braden, was asked by a novice player how one should structure their game.
Should you scatter your volleys, should you attack the net, should you play
the sideline shots?  His response was a model of simplicity.  He said "hit it
deep". If you can hit the ball deep to the end line on EVERY VOLLEY, you will
be better than 90% of the other players.  When you can do that consistently,
you are ready for the finer points of the game.  When you can turn in to the
corner at a reasonable speed, floor the gas and accelerate PAST the apex and
down the straight consistently, on every turn, then you are ready for the
next step. Remember, know the line, brake at a comfortable rate, turn-in at a
controllable speed, slowly floor it and drive past the apex.  I'll explain
more on how and why to do this with my next post.

Hi Roger,

Yes, I've had the same problem with my 86 Carrera. In fact I think it's a 911
thing.  
The fix is easy and cheap.

Get a hose about 1' long and run it inbetween the fluid fill container and
the overflow tube.  Clamp it tight at the resivoir. This keeps the fluid from
pushing out all under the car. Filling it to the top will not help.  Believe
it or not, this does work. If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

It was made in July of '73 so he calls it a " '73 and a half".  He says 
they added the funky rubber bumperettes in the '73.5 and thats about the 
only difference.  Is there anything else different or special?

Ummm. Yes.

The '73 T had MFI. The '73.5 had CIS. There are *LOTS* of one-year only
CIS parts on the '73.5 (the good news is that with some luck and a little
tuning, you can get more power by using the more common 2.7  parts).

115k on that engine doesn't worry me *too* much -- it may need a valve
job and probably does need guides at that milage, but otherwise should
be relatively OK.

> 	Some sources say the 911T is the cheap model and isn't worth 

I like the early Ts. They are much better cars for "normal" foolin' around
driving in traffic stuff. Sure, you'll get *SMOKED* by an S or an E 
or most hybrids, but you'll have a lot of fun. Good "starter car" for
a prospective Porschephile.

Now, the caveats: get the 911 FAQ. You'll need to have a full check-out
done, including compression and leak-down. It would be smart to have
the  CIS checked out pretty hard too. And if it doesn't have CIS, but
has been Weberized, make *DAMN* sure that this is something the emission
guys are happy with... Trying to find the stuff to go BACK to a '73.5 CIS
will be impossible.

Hi,
Did anyone see the offset crash test on Dateline NBC last night? It was 
conducted by an insurance-company sponsored organization.

The test was a 50% offset frontal collision at 38 mph. This sounds 
awfully like the German TUV tests. Are they similar?

Can anyone on the list get access to the TUV tests, which presumably 
cover more cars? I would like to get info on which cars sold in the US 
have good TUV crash tests. 

How did Porsche do in offset collisions?

Also, can a rollcage improve crash results? I assume that a real racing 
seat with a 5-point harness and a full rollcage mounted to the frame of 
the car should make some difference. Personally, I could live with racing 
seats, 5-point harness and full rollcage in a sports car. I just wouldn't 
drive it to work every day. :-)

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	Well, my brother and I took a couple days off and completed the 
Corvair/ 914, took some time and effort but it's worth it!  It still 
needs the flares and 916 bumpers (it had these already) installed, not to 
mention paint, but that can come later.  I plan to make it look like an 
awesome yellow "Sunoco" race 914 I saw in Pano a few years back. 
	Anyway it still runs great and is even more fun it its 
reincarnated '75 shell.  It doesn't flex like the rustbucket did and rust 
doesn't fly off :^)  This car GOES!  And handles great too, especially 
with the new tires I got.  I really need to rebuild the carbs though, 
they kick in and out at times, but when they all work-POWER!  My targa 
top need work though, it leaks bad.  The '70 has silicone everywhere on 
the top to "seal" it, so that one's useless.  How much do new seals and 
vinyl run? I hate to ask...
	We decided to christen it "The Bastard" referring to its illegit 
heritage.  :^)  I think I finally talked my brother into a P-car, read 
the other message.  Seyalatr,

I know this isn't THE top speed, but its pretty good for a fairly stock 
'77 924.  I got 122 on a SLIGHT downhill (OK I cheated, but its the only 
place around for miles where I can look for blue light specials :^) at 
around 6000 RPM.  Only mods to my car are Weber Wide throttle body, 
Bursch headers and straight exhaust (I love Tennesee, no inspections). 
Can't wait for the high speed list...

I just happened to ask Doug at German Parts and Restoration yesterday what
the front (windshield?) seal for a 914 targa top would run.  He said $120.
This sounds like a reasonable price to my untrained ear.  Anybody know of a
better or cheaper source for targa top seals?

Thanks for putting your position so nicely and backing it up with real

ignored and/or suppressed by the popular press. I doubt I could have said
it better.

Amen.  BTW, should we start adding "politically incorrect firearms owned"

Speaking of bandwidth, there's much to be said about cars, guns, freedoms,

 My budget is about $10,000.  Since I'll finance thru my credit union, the

I see what you're saying. However, couldn't one argue that the ones going too 
slow were the ones actually doing the speed limit and not 75-80mph ? Meaning in 
reality they were caused by everyone else going to fast. The ones going to slow 
were hit by the ones going faster, yes?  Again, if the government has determined
the speed limit to be 65, shouldn't it back that by limiting vehicles to it ? 
Then people doing the speed limit won't cause accedents.

If you EVER plan to take your car on the track forget the 944S R&P.  It is
MUCH weaker than the stock Turbo unit and has completely ruined at least two
transaxles that I am aware of when it blew up. For the street only, it is
probably ok, but a chip for the Motronic is safer if you want to go faster.

 I guess I agree *you* can drive safely. I'm working from the assumption that's 
 already been made that people *can't* drive safely above 60-65 (by virtue of 
 existing laws). Given this assumption, its seems natural MAKE SURE they do it 
 not by throwing cops/courts at em, but by making it so their cars simply can't 
 do it.

Not calling myself a pro, but I made a vacuum bleeder out of an old 30 lb.
freon can.  I use my refrigeration vacuum pump to pull the can down to 25"
vacuum.  Then I attach the hose to the brake nipple.  It really works great,
and only takes a few minutes.  It does suck a little air around the nipple,
but it pulls really hard, and if you look at the design of the nipple, you
will see that the air does not get into the caliper.  It ALWAYS gives a rock
hard pedal.  BTW you could use an old 120v refrigerator compressor to get a
vacuum.  It should pull down to about 20" vacuum.

Nope. '72 was the magic year. The T kept carbs for Europe, but everything
else had MFI. Transition came in 73.5 for the T moving to CIS, and all other
production modles had CIS in '74. Of course, there are racing engines with
Kuegelfisher MFI, and even the odd unit or so with carbs. But from '72 
on in the US and '73 on in the RoW, if you bought a 911, it had injection.

Well, I *DO* make mistakes on this stuff. I've had to promise myself not

1985 and1/2 or later, because they have the better aluminum A-arms. 1987 or
later, as they have ABS. You should be able to get an 86-88 8 valve 944 in
very good condition for less than $10,000. I'm not sure on pricing on the 16
valve 944's, but they have about 40 more HP.

ross said:


I've read how to do this and have tried once or twice on the 
street, but I can't reach the throttle while my foot is on 
the brake.  Is there some adjustment that can be made to 
pedal height or am I just doing it wrong?  

Ross Stites


Ross: Try using the ball of your foot on the brake. Slip the ball of
your right foot (the part under your big toe) to the point where it
is placed slightly right of center of the brake pedal. At this point
you should be able to roll your foot over to the right so that the
side of your foot (ideally the part of you foot under your little toe)
can be in a position where you can "blip" the throttle. This allows
you to raise the engine rpms up to the point where they will be matchly
with the rpms of the lower gear, hence a smooooooth downshift. 

also can be used as an alternative approach to left foot braking.

THis is what works for me. Some people actually position their heel
at the base of the accelerator with the ball on the brake. Others
will put their heel on the brake pedal and use the toe on the gas.

Really fancy footwork guys do the braking with the left foot and
leave the right foot on the gas (I can't do this on my car- not
enough room for my legs under the steering wheel.

Give it a shot- practice in areas where if you screw up and your
foot slips off the gas you won't end up running a red light or
anything dangerous. DO NOT TRY TO LEARN THIS AT A RACETRACK!!

Hope it helps.

 -jim

ps. if the above suggestions still don't allow you the ability

Subject: Rules for A/C in Porsches

notes  from  the  edge  of  the  world  !

These are observations and rules to live by if you drive a PORSCHE car with an

AIR CONDITIONER  attached to it.   By Roger  Eaton   Roger@ix.netcom.com

1. An a/c system can't be too clean  nor too dry !  Never allow dirt or moisture 
to
get any where near an open a/c line or fitting.  Remember, all the freon in your
a/c must pass thru an opening the size of a pin point each trip around on it's
circuit.  So a single drop of water can freeze and stop everything up, same thing
with dirt.

2. If you have a 911 or 912 or even a 356 with a condenser mounted on the lid
over the engine, you must always be cognizant of the fact that the AIR that is
drawn thru that condenser by the engine fan, keeps that condenser COOL.
So....When ever you are running the AIR COND> you MUST have the LID CLOSED.
Preferably completely.  The pressure inside the a/c system can and will escalate
up to 500 lbs. in about a minute, and if there is a weak fitting or hose you 
could
get a face full of R-12.  Trust me, you wouldn't like it !  Baring a weak hose 
there
is a pressure relief valve located on the rec/drier that is designed to melt and 
let
this pressure out. I can't begin to count all the calls we've gotten from dealers 
over
the years asking what this was when it happened to them, and always they
admit that ,yes the hood was open when they were charging the a/c.  This would
be like taking the fan off a real car and running the engine.

3.The SEAL on the compressor located behind the Clutch NEEDS to be lubricated
regularly that is preferably on a weekly basis. This seal is made of carbon and
when the oil dries out of it, it wants to score the steel plate it rubs against
causing grooves and subsequent leaks.  Leaking seals are easy to spot, just look 
on
the parts on body panels around the comp.,you will see a trail of oil right 
behind
the a/c belt.  It is almost impossible to have a completely dry seal but the best
prevention is once a week use of the a/c, just 5 min. a week that's all we ask !

4.The hoses used on all a/c systems up until the past couple of years, has always
been of the type that was made to leak slowly by putting small pin prick holes
along the length preventing pressure build up in any one spot. Well, now we have
a new kind of hose, mandated by the fed. It is called BARRIER HOSE. It has an
inner liner that prevents this leak thereby extending the life of your FREON.
Why this is important to owners of Porsches is that Porsches are unique in that
they use a LOT of hose because of the way the car is laid out. So making a
change to BARRIER HOSE could be one smart investment !

5. The A/C systems on the Porsche cars have evolved slowly over the past 30 or
33 years. Gosh , I can remember some mighty crude units in the early days, even
tried to make my  own once or twice, but I'm happy now just to make
Improvements to whats out there. Most any 911 or 912 can benifit from more
CONDENSER area , the problem being , there just isn't room for conventional cond.
to be mounted. What I have found is that there is room under the  car for a
single pass heavy duty cond. laid flat to the floor. It adds only ONE inch to the
bottom of the car and is rugged enough to take a lot of abuse. To date (13 years)
we has yet to have one damaged beyond simple repair.  An added benifit of this
cond. is that since this becomes the Primary cond. the cond. over the engine does
less work, thus adding less HEAT to the air coming in to cool the Engine !

6. The Reciever- Drier is a small tank located in the liquid side of most all a/c
systems and it's job is : to store a supply of liquid for the expansion valve to 
use,
to FILTER out any impurities that may have gotten in before they get to the x-
valve  and to act as a drier to remove any moisture in the system.  But the r/d 
is
only built to absorb a minute amount of moisture, measured in drops !  It has a
bag of dessicant much like you would see in a package sent from abroad to
protect electronics from moisture.   If the window on the r/d is cloudy it means
that it is saturated and must be replaced.   If the r/d is cool to the touch when
the system is fully charged it is plugged and must be replaced.  If you get a 
plugged
x-valve the materiel came from the r/d and it must be replaced.  If you have had
your car apart for two years restoring it and the r/d has been open to the
elements... REPLACE IT !  It can absorb enough moisture overnight to ruin it.  If 
you
do take your car apart, seal up the r/d tight and store in a DRY place.  NEVER
use a used r/d it just isn't worth the damage it WILL cause.

7. A FACTORY installed a/c in a 911 with two cond. (one over the eng. & one
under the chin )  will hold three (3) lbs of R-12 when recharged from empty.  All
other (aftermarket and single cond. fact. a/c ) should be satisfied with two (2)
lbs.  Late in 1976 Porsche tried a little scam and left off the FRONT cond on 
their
Factory units.  So all thru '77 and into '78  these cars had the worst a/c's  
that
Porsche ever offered.  Laate in '78 they reverted back to a two row cond. over 
the
eng. and the front cond. with it's fan in front of the spare tire. IF you have 
one of
these bastard units  this explains why you can't get cold. It's time to up date.

Enough for now , more as I think it up.  Questions ???    Roger

The MFI left heat exchanger has a spigot on the upright portion to which the
heavy rubber hose for thermostat heat is attached.  The carb and CIS heat
exchanger does not have this.  This is the only difference.  You can use a
MFI heat exchanger on a CIS car, but you cannot use a CIS/carb heat exchanger
on a MFI car if you are using the thermostat on the injection pump.

Subject: DP 935's


     I recently had the pleasure of getting a ride in, and a good
     look at Don Flanaghan's DP 935.  Featured on the cover of
     European Car Magazine a short time ago.  I have a few questions
     to anyone on the list that might have some experience with
     any of the DP's.

     First is a DP just a company that made demo turbo models and 935
     just meaning an aftermarket car?

     What is so special about the DP cars?  - Besides the fact that
          Don Flanaghan's is running somewhere around 900 bhp.

          Don Flanaghan is now selling one of his DP935 track cars
          that he had custom twin turbo'd and I was wondering if ther
          is really any difference in value between this one and
          a 930 say?  Do the DP 935's have any value other than the
          car itself?  Rarity or otherwise?

          Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

You idiot! You got it all wrong. The *Porsche* is worth 3 times the

Subject: Re: DP 935's

>      What is so special about the DP cars?  

Well, they're tuned by DP. That means they get some special bodywork,
some special engine stuff, some special suspension stuff, and a
very extra special surprise when you go to pay for it. DP is to Porsche
sort of what AMG is to Mercedes (or TuneupMasters is to Buick, but I
digress)

Which gets us to:

My rule of thumb here is simple: if a car is bone stock, I can *KNOW* 
what the value is likely to be today, and probably for some time to
come. I also know exactly what it will cost to run and maintain, as
there is a wealth of such info available.

If a car is "tuned" or "modified", it's a JUMBO crap shoot. Is it *worth*
more? That's up to you. Did it *COST* someone more? You bet. Probably
a lot more. Do they want to get all of their money back when they sell
it? Invariably. "The guy who sold it to me swore that as an investment
it would outperform the S&P 500 index" is something I've heard a lot. *A 
LOT*. Particularly in the sort of Gold Chain Crowd that owns the real
high-dollar "specially tuned" cars whether from DP, Werke I, Kremer,
ANDIAL, or whoever. (As opposed to the kind of guys that own multi-color
BUTT-UGLY '72 911s with enough significant modifications to just about pay
for a new car... Scott? You *are* listening aren't you? 8{) )
Stock street cars you can value accurately, race cars you can at least
establish the market price and price to reproduce, stuff like DPs...

However, a car is more than a collection of parts. It has value to you
based on what it "does for you." If you love it, then it can be a  monumentally
shitty investment and still be a "good deal". 

Simple assessment: the questions you're asking indicate that you are
not totally committed with that "shit I GOTTA have this car" sensation
(that I for instance get everytime I'm within about 20 miles of a
'64-5 Carrera 2 cab...). So it's just about a dead certainty that you
WILL NOT BE HAPPY with this car, particularly when the bills come in.
If you gotta look at it like an investment, you picked the wrong car.

The changes were actually more significant than just better control arms. 
Halfway into 1985 (April), Porsche upgraded the following components:
 
 - fuel tank (now plastic) increased to 80 litres!
 - updated oval dash
 - 30 mm lower seat position
 - 18 mm higher steering wheel
 - interior ventilation improved 35%
 - heating system improved
 - battery moves to well behind left rear wheel (not on my '86?!)
 - new crank and balance shaft
 - larger oil pump giving 10% increase in flow
 - front A arms and rear semi-trailing arms all cast in aluminum
 - improved mounting of drivetrain to reduce noise
 - flush bonded windshield
 - others?

  Well, Wade, fortunately I DO have Bruce's book here at work :^)  You 
were close.  Porsche needed FI to meet US emissions.  In '72 and early 
'73, they used MFI on US 911T's.  They used carbs on ROW (because carbs
were cheaper than MFI).  Starting in Jan., 1973, they switched to 
CIS for US, because it was cheap and clean.  Bruce's book is ambiguous
as to whether '73.5 ROW T's had carbs or CIS, but I *think* it was carbs.

Bill, you're absolutely right - you would think that would be a perfectly 
natural, logical thing for the government to do...

Except you're not taking into consideration the amount of money local and 
state governments make from speeding tickets. I don't have any numbers to 
back this up, but I feel safe in supposing it's a substantial amount of
money (at least, my personal contribution has seemed pretty substantial!).

They're not as interested in public safety so much as getting more money 
and spending more money... after all, the local/state governments take in 
money from tickets and at the same time hit up the feds for more money to 
put more police on the streets. The number of traffic violations helps 
demonstrate a need for more police protection, and of course any dollar 
brought home from Washington just enhances a politician's personal 
prestige... and if they don't get money from the feds, hell, they can 
just fall back on local/state money; either way it's a classic plank for 
any campaign platform. Nice system - works for all involved, except us 
poor schmucks who pay the bills. But then, they don't really care about 
us much, do they?

I'd like to think they don't put speed limiters on cars out of fear of a 
public uproar, but I'm afraid I haven't been taking my Pollyanna pills 
(you know, those l'il red, white & blue numbers) like I've been told. I'm 
saving room instead for some of those yellow jobs Unka Bart keeps 
mentioning...

More of my own gas, which I paid for. Not a lot more, the car burns
just about the same unless I'm on the race track. There is no more
danger from driving at 100mph safely than there is from driving 20mph
safely. The police are going to waste their time no matter what you
do - have you ever been to a donut shop? The way for the police to
stop wasting their time is for them to actually stop wasting their
time: like, maybe, fire most of them - they have nothing better to do than
hang around at rest stops and highway cutovers. The more $$ thing is of 
personal concern only - I pay my road taxes, I pay for my car maintenance, and
I pay for my gasoline. What's it to you if I want to get somewhere for
it? I drive about 2-1/2 hours a day. If I could drive at a safe faster
speed, I would have 1/2 to 3/4 hours a day that I could do productive labor
in, and make more money as a result. It's a question of being able to
efficiently make use of my own resources as I see fit towards the ends
I am interested in - that includes some fast driving from time to time
(daily would be preferred).

	When I spoke to Peter Morgan about my favourite bug in the book
(the photo of the "944 Turbo" dash, identified by the boost gauge which is
*actually* an MPG gauge from an early 85/2 normally aspirated 944!!), he

was one he hadn't already spotted). He also said that he had no current plans

You idiot! You got it all wrong. The *Porsche* is worth 3 times the

Roger,

Great post on the A/C rules.  I have beaten on my A/C enough to appreciated
what you have written.  In refrigeration, a Filter/Dryer will last
indefinately, unless something happens to the system.  It would seem that the
desicant area in the Porsche unit is so small that it should be replaced
after a period of time, even if the system has stayed operational.  What is
your experience with this?  Also, my car is quite low, and I really don't

I'm sure Chrysler appreciated some bad press for their brand new Cirrus.
I was a little surprised about the Passat.  I thought it might fair pretty 
well.  Of course, they didn't crash a Mercedes (thank goodness).  It just 
about tore me up to see the Passat meet a tragic death.

I know F1 and Indy cars are desinged to basically disintegrate in a

First of all, when you do a leakdown test you are supposed to listen to hear
where the leakdown is on any poor cylinder. Listen in the intake for intake
valve,
muffler for exhaust valve, or crankcase for rings. You really can hear it.
So where was it leaking?

Secondly, these compression numbers are too high for a 2.4 S with 8.5 to 1
compression. You should not crank it a dozen times until the pressure
builds real high. If they did this, it may explain why the #2 compression
was OK but leakdown bad. On the Porsche factory compression testers,
it graphs EACH stroke of compression, so you can see the results of even
the first stroke. I think about 3-5 strokes is enough if you just have a
guage.
My first 2.4 engine had about 110 PSI compression, but ran very strong
(strong enough to win the '85 SCCA championship and several pro solos).

So do the tests again, and let us know what you found.

Subject: Re: Want a 944, what year?

Hello

I would recommend that you stay away from the 944 Turbo unless you HAVE to
have the extra performance. The Turbo does have a LOT more HP (220 vs. 150)
and better suspension and brakes, but also costs a LOT more for service. A
nice compromise would be to find an S model. These have 16 valve engines with
190HP, and the updated brakes of the Turbo. Service prices for the S models
is not that much higher than for the 8 valve 944 models. Keep in mind that
the regular 944 is not a slow car, it just doesn't accellerate all that fast.


For $10K, you should be able to find a perfect condition 85.5 - 88 944. You
might also be able to find an S model in very good condition. Some other
notes: I would stay away from the regular 89 944. That car has as 2.7L motor,
that was only used that year. Cars before 89 all used 2.5L motors. In 89 the
S2 model came out that used a 3.0L 16 valve engine. Those cars will be out of
your price range. Dual airbags and ABS were an option in 87, and became standa
rd in 88. If you look hard, and get lucky, you might find an 88 944 for 10K.
This might be the best car for someone who wants a very nice, good looking,
reliable, sweet handling, easy to drive, high performance car.

Real expensive items are common to replace are the water pump, and clutch.
Make sure that you have the car checked by a mechanic before you buy it. This
should cost about $100, and can save you bug $$$ later.

All the 944 models are excellent cars that will last a long time if taken
care of. Don't listen to any one who says that water cooled cars can't be
real Porsches!

Let me know it you need any more information.

To MHO it is not possible to measure too long the compression.
After several stokes the compression tester is filled with compressed air and each additional stroke will not add more air into the tester, because the maximal reached pressure in the cilinder is equal to the pressure in the tester after some strokes.
I assume the compression tester is a pressure gauge with a valve which lets air flow in but not out.

Now with a totally rebuilt motor and a supposedly rebuilt tranny, I`m ready for
some `next to new` performance.  NO  WAY.  The motor is runs great but the
transmission is EXACTLY the same.  The clutch is new and a new short shifter.
AND, to make a bad situation worse, now I can`t find this guy.

Mi, Mike,

Hmm, did you see the old parts from the tranny, before you paid the bill.

What state was this in...by your domain name, I assume New York... did this
fellow have a DMV license to do auto repair work?  If so, you can contact
the department of consumer affairs and work to find him.

Of course, not everyone in the PCA has a perfect track record.  There are a
lot of people who hold membership cards, advertise that they are "PCA
members since 1977" and we never see them. All it takes to be a PCA'er is 36
bucks per year, with no other obligations...

Did you stop payment on the check yet?

I'd be in for a Valentine.

But also, let me take this chance to describe my dream detector:

The detector would consist of TWO units, one to be mounted on each side of the
car - one far left on the driver's visor, one far right on the passenger's
visor.  Each unit would have 4 or 8 horn antennas to receive signals from
any direction.  The units would be connected by a small wire.

The master unit on the driver's side would not have the arrow display, but
a small 1 inch square gas plasma grid for pinpointing the relative location
of any radar sources! 

Using two receiving units and building the the necessary logic, my dream
detector would triangulate on radar sources to tell me position and strength!

Mike, how feasible would this be?

Subject: 022 or 031, for '69 912?

Folks,

Having heard the talk recently on this list regarding the superior advance
curves of the 022's and 031's over the 009, I've recently dusted off my
022 and 031 distributors (I have an 061, too, and may have it gold-plated).

My 022 and 031 units are both in good shape.  Which should I use?  Is one
better than the other, advance-curve-wise?

My 022 is cast iron; my 031 is aluminum - are they all like that?

Timing question: my specs state 3 degrees AFTER TDC.  But, that's for the
stock 061 distributor (no smog pump - never had it, never will).  Do I
use that timing for an 022/031, or do I go with the earlier 3dBTDC ??

Thanks again,

Peter Gregory

even though it is a victim of entropy
the aroma of warm leather, hot oil
the rolling thunder of a lopey idle trumpeted through the exhaust
the entimacy of the cockpit
the feeling of control as I grasp the wheel
and the tires bite the asphalt
the animal howl as the tach winds up
the visceral tug as I ease down on the throttle
the surge of power as I accerate from the apex (I somtimes hit it !)

sometimes when I park it I have to look over my shoulder as I
walk away, just to confirm that the dream is a reality.

It makes me look forward to going to work in the morning.

Subject: lap timer

Hey to all electronic tinkerers out there.

I'm 0.5 heartedly thinking of designing and building an in car lap
timer.  Why build rather than buy......for grins why else ?

I'm thinking of a display which shows two lap times, the just completed
lap and the previous lap, the latter display above the former.  two
push button control - button one resets both displays to zero and
starts the lap timer, the second moves the lower display into the upper
display, displays the just completed lap time in the lower display,
and re-starts the timer from zero.  the timer itself wouldn't
be displayed as it counts up, only after time has been stopped - that way
one can see last lap and previous lap and compare - wouldn't be looking
at a counting timer anyway.

thinking of mounting the two buttons on or near the heater levers.  the
timer either as a seperate box on the dash in the middle or actually
replacing the clock and mounting the timer in a can in the clock hole
(in which case I'd put a clock in it too).

any PCA/SCCA rules I need to know about mounting this kind of gadget ?
anybody out there done this and have advice for me (ie what's a good
chip to use for timer - intersil has a stopwatch chip that some of 
the kitchen timers use, but it has lcd display outputs and I want to
use red 7-segment led displays) ?

Taka Mizutani wanted to know where one can get crash test results. 

The German car magazine Auto, motor und Sport regularly has    crash test
results. In the Spetember 9, 1994 issue they had a large report on crash
testing, comparing the differences in US and European crast tests- head on
vs. offset, and air bag differences- US vs. Euro. There was a summary of all
the test results and there was no Porsche included. They were definitely
tested, but Auto, motor und Sport  was obviously not  invited to cover it.

I'm in agreement with Mike Piera on this one.  Your compression numbers are 
way too high for a 2.4S engine.  The compression on my '73S after full rebuild
was 140-145 psi in each cylinder.  Definitely have a mechanic you trust check
the engine over thoroughly before you make the purchase.

Don't know whats up with #2. Again a very good reason to have the car 
thoroughly checked.  

Just curious what the price is on this car and overall condition.  What options
does it have?

BTW, I just located a '72 911S w/ sunroof here in the Bay Area for $6800.00.
I think its already been sold though.  Boy what a deal!!

Well, a few years back when I purchased the adapter for the use MOMO 
I now have on my 914 track car, I was told that the Porsche crest horn
buttons were nolonger being made, and that I probably wouldn't get
one.  However, I did get one, and the previous owner of the wheel gave
me one.  (Now I've got a spare 8-) )

What my problem is: I need to have the MOMO recovered.  The leather
has warn out and split.  Any suggestions?  Cost estimates?

Graham,

I recently (December) bought a 1988 944 Turbo S in Montreal from a dealer
with 129 K. It was not winter driven but my now sold '86 944 was for 4
winters. It did not suffer except for a little more frequent brake work as
a result of salt. (I live in Halifax, NS). 

Buying from a dealer (ie. 1 yr warranty) really helps, particularly buying
out of town. My local dealer has replaced the Turbo, head gasket, and O2
sensor all at no cost. The dealer had a good look at the engine during the
head gasket job and said that it was in very good shape so 200K miles +
seems reasonable. My '86 944 had 130K miles and was still in good shape and
used next to no oil.

I would not be scared off by the Kms as long as the car is in good shape.
If things do go wrong or turn up to be wrong you have one year of warranty
to help out. Check for little things because they may not be covered by the
warranty. Most major things except the clutch are.

Any more questions, let me know,

I think we all agree that having the car taken from you is potentially the most
dangerous position to be in. So how to protect yourself and get the bad guy.

I noticed a behavior on my car alarm which might be useul.

The other day I reset my alarm and was slow getting the vehicle just as I
inserted the key it beeped indicating it armed itsself. I took no notice turned
on the ignition an drove off. Low and behold 3 minutes later in the middle of
traffic off went the alarm. The alarms in question are those sold by AutoZone
and Checkers ranging from around $50 to $150. Can't think of the make but the
model is TSP500 or AA9447.

If you place an interuption switch in the power sensing line and trip it before
being forced out of the vehicle the alarm will show the above behaviour, don't
have the valet switch and light accessible or the remote on your car keys.

I have a now-old-fashioned BEL Vector 3, and get frequent falsing with
Ka band, which isn't in use in my community either, as far as I know.
I'm sure it's the usual kind of thing that sets off a detector--banks,
mini-storages, whatever.  If location and intensity are constant, I'd
be pretty sure that's what it is.  Meanwhile, it's comforting that I

Greetings,

If you have a 944S you may want to check the clearance
between the ignition wires, comming from the distributor
and the hood.  The wires can wear through the insulation
on the hood and short out.  I noticed the Tech Tip in the
Euroselect Catalog and when I looked my wires had worn
through the insulation and I had a couple of nice shinny
bare metal spots on the hood from the wires.  

I changed the wire routing and replaced the insulation.

Subject: 911 Oil Return Tubes



	I just recently replaced the oil return tubes on my '87 911
	Carrera, and thought I'd pass along a tip or two.

	The new Porsche factory supplied two piece return tubes have
	"improved" rubber O-rings of higher durometer and are very stiff.
	So stiff that I was unable to extend the tubes without some 
	additional mechanical advantage!

	I cut a pair of 1 inch copper solder sleeves in half, lengthwise.
	Cut the length of one of them down so that they would just fit
	end to end between the retaining ring and the flared end of the 
	inner tube when collapsed to a length that will just allow insertion 
	of one end in the case tube bore.
	Install a hose clamp on each to keep the two split halves together.

	Assemble the two split tubes onto the inner tube, then the snap ring,
	then the two inner O-ring seals, lubricate with motor oil.
	Slip the outer tube over the O-rings until it bottoms out against
	the split tube/retaining ring stackup. Install the two outer O-ring
	seals and lubricate with motor oil. The split tubes must slide freely
	over the inner tube and butt against the retaining ring around it's 
	full circumference.

	Install the large tube end into the Case bore and pivot the tube up
	to align with the bore in the cyl. head, then use your Large External
	Snap Ring Pliers to expand the tube assy until you hear the retaining
	ring snap home. Viola! Undo the hose clamps and remove the split tubes,
	repeat for the balance of tubes.

	Further hints, this job is done with the heat exchangers removed!
	The Left side front tube can be done without removing the Oil line
	from the case, its just a puzzle!

	911s don't have to have wet bottoms! They just take a little 
	maintenance.

Summit Racing P/N SUM-G3126 ($16.95) is a small (<1.5" face) ,
made-in-Germany (they don't advertise this fact) 0-60psi fp gauge.  You'll
also need a fitting - they have one (SUM G1710, $8.99, currently
backordered, a little big but will fit German fuel line). 216-630-0200.

The trouble with most of these gauges is that they're not damped - as a
result, when your car is running, the needle is bouncing over a 10psi or so
range as the injectors (On L-Jetronic, at least) open and close.  I used to
use a big, fluid-damped guage, but it was really too big for the
application, and so I switched to the abovementioned one. Now the only
accurate way to measure the fp is to have the engine off but the fuel pump
running.

Subject: A/C, not low on freon, intermittently blows hot

I have an '88 944s. The A/C will blow nice and cold, and then suddenly begin
blowing hot, as if I had turned the temperature control to full heat. Its
really obnoxiously hot, and even on the coolest day, and the fan turned to
'0', I'll have to open on the windows. Sometimes it will spontaneously
return to blowing cold air, while driving. It seems that it always starts
blowing cold, though. Fiddling with the temperature dial has no effect. Nor
does the A/C switch. I think the temperature dial does work, because when
the A/C is blowing normally cold, the temperature can be adjusted to heat.
Also, when things are running normally, the A/C can be engaged and
disengaged with the dash A/C switch. I haven't been paying much attention to
the problem (been this way for about 6 months) since it hasn't been very
hot, but would like to get it repaired now. 

If you have any ideas as to what might be the problem, I'd appreciate
hearing from you. I'd like to have it serviced, but I'd like to keep the
costs under control. While a completely new A/C condenser, wiring, and dash
controller might fix the problem, I'd rather just replace a failed component. :)

    My mom's VW Golf had similar symptoms... I think it was eventually
diagnosed as a bad expansion valve.  I would also check and make sure
that you heater valve/various flaps in your heater ducting/whatever are
not hanging up/loose from broken cables.

Since the antenna wire is in the glass, it seems quite possible they   
didn't connect it to the amplifier correctly, especially if the radio was   
working ok before the glass was put in. The amplifier is under the dash   
in front of the driver, I think. I live in a fairly strong signal area   
and the reception was pretty bad when I first put my stereo in because I   
forgot to attach the amplifier.

Hope this helps.

Subject: What's a 73.5 (11T

You ask if this the 73.5 T is special. Well, yes it is . Fairly few were made
(834). The 911s from '74 through '77 (2.7 L engines) are generally considered
not to be one of Porsche's best efforts at engine design. So the 73.5 cars
were the last of the early 911s. But a 73.5 T certainly is not rare (i.e.
investment quality). 


This 73.5 911s are considered the most refined early 911s by some. See your
local newstand for the newest "Excellence" magazine for a discussion of the
73 911S. Not to imply  the T is an S (it's not by at least 50 HP - just to
mention one reason). However more than one contemporary writer  considered
the T to a the most desireable 911 for a daily driver.  There is nothing
wrong with a T and they are great cars to own and drive.

Whether or not an early 911 is an appropriate daily driver in 1995.  I'll
leave to others. However if the car is driven daily there will eventually be
many other examples that are much more desireable (unless your brother is
into high maintenance sporst cars). I think a 73.5 911T would be a great
Porsche to own and enjoy as a recreational vehicle. I'm sure there are
excellent early 911s driven on a daily basis but their owners are would not
be in the ranks of the average car owner either.

Of course your brother must get ths car appraised by a knowledgeable Porsche
mechanic. These guys are not cheap until you think how much it can cost to
rebuild major components. Any rust or evidence of recent body/chassis repair
is a tip to insist on impeccible documentation of the repair/restoration or
run away as fast as your feet can carry you.

	I'm new to the list and this is my first post so hello everyone. 
I am a college student with little $$$ and had a locked ac/compressor. I 
decided to save some money by installing a Nippondenso/Sanden changover 
kit. I installed the kit a couple of months ago and probably didn't save 
any money (After about a month of searching I found a rebuilt unit for 
about $500 and the changover was about $400 for the kit and 
reciever/drier). All worked well for a while and then I began 
experiencing similar problems of intermittent cooling (the comp. clutch 
was engaging only occasionaly). However, the system was cooling quite 
well while it was working which led me to believe there was still freon 
in the system. I reassured my belief when I found the pressure switch 
near the receiver/drier, shorted the leads and the clutch still wouldn't 
engage. I can also hear what I think is the relay for the compressor 
clicking on and off intermittently when the ac button is depressed. I 
don't know much about the electronics in the climate control but it 
works fine for the heater. 
	I may be missing something obvious here so any suggestions would 
be greatly appreciated.

Peter,

Technical bulletins were issued by PCNA as a way to keep mechanics
informed of changes for a certain model car. At a later time changes
were made to the shop manuals, through supplements. These tech bulletins
are still available, compilied in a softcover book format. Each book contains 
all  the bulletins for a given year. I have found information that you may
be looking for. Techanical Bulletins Jan-Dec '88 # PNA 000 076 Book "E".
These books are available from any Porsche dealer. I used Stoddard's,
because they have most of them in stock(800 342-1414). Prices for these
publications vary ($16.95-$24.95 dealer list)

Subject: The "right" 944

I can't recall who queried, "Is there a BAD 944?  What should I get?"  My own
experience is limited but I can't resist a comment.  Some have said to get a
post '85.5 944.  I bought a 1983 944 (the puny one!) a couple of years ago
for $10K.  It had 17,000 authenticated miles on it, virgin paint, and an
engine bay that clearly had never known dirt or wet.  The upholstery under
the sheepskins looked "as new."  Now, this car can be outdragged by many a
Japanese sedan these days (witness: Maxima SE), and an S2 almost doubles its
horsepower.  But as a balanced, fun machine, I am getting my money's worth.
 As one advisor told me prepurchase, "Hey, it's cheaper than a used Ford
Escort.  If you don't buy it, I will."

My message is that *all* these Porsches are special, pleasant cars to own and
drive.  I have taken mine to pulse-pounding speeds on twisty, isolated Utah
roads, and find it hard to imagine more fun per dollar spent.

My advice is: driver as many Porsches as you can, study up on them, and shop,
shop, shop, until you find one that makes you say, "I *want* it!"  I enjoyed
a full year of shopping before getting mine, and that was a big part of the
fun.

Hunter Heath

P.S.  I'm shopping again, and still having fun.

P.P.S.  My '83 has been very reliable tho not a daily driver; I can't stand
to get salt on it.  Or even water except from my yard hose.  My wife says,
"get a life."  Me, I think I have one.  And a Porsche for cheap!

Mr, Lommatzsch, 

In this case we are talking about characteristic impedance, not
necessarily resistive impedance.  At any rate, connecting the 10 Ohm
speakers to your 4 Ohm outputs will not break anything.  The load that the
amp outputs will see (the load placed by the speakers) will be higher than
the 4 Ohm matching impedance of the stereo, which will mean that power
output will be less, your speakers will not play as loud.  No harm will be
done though.  On the other hand, connecting a 10 Ohm amp output to 4 Ohm
speakers will most probably cause damage as the load will be less than the
matching impedance.  Most car amps (except for the good ones ie Carver,
Nakamichi, et al) are not all that stable and do not handle such load 
mismatches well, ie it may blow the amp's final output stages. 

On the other hand, it sounds like you will not be using the factory 
stereo so you do not have to worry about that.  Your wiring may say 10 
Ohms but that only refers to the characteristics of the factory stereo, 
there is no magic impedance in the wires.

And to retard all flame ignitions, I have assumed that Mr. Lommatzsch will
be using average stereo equipment, average wires and average speakers, ie
he is not connecting modified Apogees to a modified Krell in his car via
garden hose-thick Audioquest cables. 

I hope I have helped some...

This is always one of those "kids, don't try this at home" kind of deals...

You really have 4 choices:

1) full stock DME setup with some, oh, "tuning". This looks bone stock
   and should pass visual inspection and emissions.

2) Haltech. EFI only, no "engine management" function. Their CPU is about 
   $2k, but you gotta supply the rest of what you need. The new revision 
   system is pretty decent for racing, but doesn't have quite enough range 
   for a daily driven street car. That notwithstanding, I have put a bunch
   of these on the street.

3) Electromotive. Fully integrated engine management, with distributorless
   crankfire, etc. You *CAN NOT* use this setup with high butterflies or
   slide valves, you *GOTTA* use a common plenum. Like the stock DME.
   So one possibility is a semi-stock DME where you make it look like
   factory, but use this stuff as the brains.

4) Motec. OK, I said I don't use it. There's a reason: they like you to be
   a "certified Motec distributor" and I'm not. The feeling is that they
   don't sell it in kit form, that they won't have unhappy customers. They're
   probably right. Current setup is ISO-9000 certified, and has the best
   environmental package of any aftermarket EFI I've seen. They also provide
   all the source code, and to the best of my knowledge, no one else does.

> Any guess on overall systems price?

Figure on about $2k for the brain. You'll have to build or buy everything
else. Good 911 throttle bodies start at about $3k and go from there.
Then you need the fuel rails, the injectors, the rest of the plumbing and
the wiring. And a bunch of dyno and programming hours.

I usually send people to Sam Shalala at ProTechnik in Houston for Motec.
His whole system, installed and tuned, is about $10k. The last one he did
was for Alex Jobbe (which he used to take the win at Sebring, in fact).

> Are there any out there that are self tuning (via emissions sensing)?

No. Not that I'm aware of. There are several that use O2 and EGT sensors
but you have to integrate that stuff...

Sounds like a nice engine. What are your inspection requirements? That
could well dictate your choice...

I think the best option is to replace the pump. There is an updated unit
that is much more durable. Part # 951.606.130.01. You could try and rebuild
the old one, but I do not think it is worth the time. The old design is

Subject: RE:Speaker Ohms

Mike,
	DO NOT MIX & MATCH Speakers, as you will cause an impedance mismatch and 
you risk damaging your amplifier in you radio.  Essentially, if you put two 8 ohm 
speakers in series, the resulting impedance is NOT 16 ohm, but 4.  Putting an 8 
ohm speaker on a 4 ohm amp will essentially reduce the efficiency of the amp, but 
should not blow the system, however it will not be as loud.  If you put a 4 ohm 
speaker on an 8 ohm amp, the sound will be louder, you will be over-exerting your 
amplifier and you risk blowing something.  If you want to put in extra speakers, 
you have to add a cross-over system specially made for this purpose.  That's why 
the little tune-up speakers for the dash are always high impedance, since they go 
in series with the front speakers.
	Speak to your local in-car entertainment buff about adding speakers.

Mike,

The impedance rating of a speaker in ohms will effect how the output of the
amplifier is loaded. What does this mean? Typically, a 4 ohm speaker will
put out twice the volume (3dB) than an 8 ohm speaker at the same volume
setting. A two ohm speaker will be twice as loud as the 4 ohm, and so on.
The output of an amplifier basically tells you what impedance the amp wants
to see from the speakers. If you connect 8 ohm speakers to an amp that is
rated for 4 ohms, the amp will have to work harder to achieve the same
given volume it would with the ideal (4 ohm) speakers. On the other hand,
if you connected a bunch of speakers to the amp (which is rated at 4 ohms),
and the total impedance of the chain of speakers is, say, less than 1 ohm,
the amp will become unstable and probably blow up (don't forget, less than
2 ohms is getting mighty close to a short circuit, and typically amplifiers
don't like to see shorts across their outputs). In any case, you want to
try to stay as close to the rated impedance on the output of the amp as
possible. ON the other hand, if you hook everthing up and it sounds ok to
you, then I wouldn't worry. Amplifiers generally don't mind seeing more
than their rated impedance at their outputs, just less.

I would suggest getting a new pair of front speakers (even cheap ones) that
are rated at 4 ohms. You don't have to spend very much on aftermarket
speakers to surpass the quality of oem speakers (except in some cases) ...

Hope this helps ...

Subject: Stereo Problems--(was: speaker ohms)

Maybe I can help eliminate some of the recent stereo confusion.

First of all, for those who don't know, stock stereo systems very often 
differ greatly in their design and layout as compared to the more usual and 
"standard" aftermarket systems.  The most commonly used aftermarket auto 
speakers are of the 4-ohm variety (with some 8-ohm also), but OEM units 
don't necessarily conform to the same "rules".  Thus, it is not usually a 
good idea to mix various stock stereos/speakers with other aftermarket 
stereos/speakers unless you are sure of proper load matching.

Speakers do not act as resistors (they are reactive loads), but it is 
possible to think of them as such for use in determining the overall nominal 
load.  Simply stated, when speakers are wired in SERIES, the total impedence 
will be the sum of the parts (i.e. two 4-ohm speakers in SERIES will have a 
total load of 8-ohms).  In a case where TWO speakers of the SAME impedence 
rating are wired in PARALLEL, the total impedence will be HALF of the rating 
of ONE OF THE SPEAKERS (i.e. if two 4-ohm speakers are wired in PARALLEL the 
total load will equal 2-ohms).  

The lower the load, the less resistance there is to the flow of power, and 
the harder the amp must work.  Only specially designed amps ($$$) are 
capable of driving a load as low as 2-ohms or less while maintaining 
stability.  With the average head-unit powering two or four speakers it is 
best to use speakers of the proper impedence load stated on the head-unit by 
the (aftermarket) manufacturer.  It is important to avoid dropping the load 
below that rating on the head because damage will most likely result.  Using 
a load greater than that recommended will not cause damage, but will only 
result in a decrease in efficiency, and less overall sound output.

This is an oversimplified explanation, but I hope it helped.

Now, in reference to Dan Starkey's question...
For all of you out there with the stiffly sprung 911's, there is little you 
can do (cheaply) to eliminate skipping.  The skip-resistance of any 
particular CD player is quite simply a function of the design of its built 
in "suspension" system.  Some of the better (read: more $$$) brands have 
better shock resistance than the cheaper models, but every in-dash CD player 
has a limit to its internal suspension.  The easiest cure is probably to opt 
for or add a CD changer.  Due to their larger size the changers are able to 
incorporate much beefier shock absorbers, but even they are not 
"shock-proof".  Rest assurred, however, that many more models will become 
available in the (sometime) near future (I only know of one now) that 
incorporate a large "buffer-memory" of a few megs (like the Sony MD) to 
store data as it is read from the transport.  This CD players will be nearly 
shock-proof.

I hope all this stuff helped someone!

I'm sorry Jan, but you are **very** wrong on this. If you connect two 8 ohm
speakers in series, you do in fact get 16 ohms. If you connect two 8 ohm
speakers in parallel, you get 4 ohms.

Series = amp. positive to speaker #1 positive
              speaker #1 negative to speaker #2 positive
              speaker #2 negative to amp negative

Parallel = amp. positive to speaker #1&2 positive.
                amp. negative to speaker #1&2 negative.

In any case, this effect is known as ohm's law. You are correct in that if
an 8 ohm amplifier sees less than 8 ohms that can lead to damage, but only
if the load were to go below 4 ohms (please, do not flame me on this
because after doing live sound and studio recording for 8 years i know what
amplifiers do in the real world). If the amp were to see, say, less than 2
ohms then you would run into problems.

On the same token, if an amp see a lot more than it's rated impedance (say
an amp rated at a 4 ohm output has four eight ohm speakers hooked up to it
in series and therefore is seeing 32 ohms) the amp would sound badly
distorted and it could cause damage. So, deviation from the specified
impedance of the amp in either direction too far can be bad.

As a side note, it should be known that speaker impedance is a general
spec. and a speaker's actual impedance varies across the frequency spectrum
(ie. - a speaker rated at 8 ohms might only have a 3 ohm impedance at
300Hz). Most impedance measurements are rated at 1kHz (a somewhat standard
freq. to measure things at). In any case, my point is that a speaker's
impedance is not an exact measurement, only a general one. One reason why
the expensive amps sound so good is that they can deal with varying
impedance loads that a speaker will present to the outputs of the
amplifier. (ie - a "good" amp will be stable to a lower impedance than a
crappy one).

In any case, I just wanted to clarify this little situation. I think as a
general note, if you don't really know what you're doing, then just connect
together what you're supposed to connect together (ie - 8 ohm speakers to
the outputs of an amp rated for 8 ohms).

trev.

Actually, two 8-ohm drivers wired in series  * WILL *  result in a total
load impedance of 16 ohms.  However, if the two 8 ohm drivers are wired in
parallel then the total load inpedance would then be 4 ohms.  Mixing
components with different impedances does no harm to the amplifier.  This
is done quite often within many professional sound cabinets and
reinforcement systems.  The problem arises when the impedance begins to
become less than 2 ohms or so.  As the load impedance drops towards zero
(and remember that a speaker's impedance rating is a nominal rating- the
actual value changes significantly with the load and frequency of the
speaker's output *IMPORTANT*) the amp ATTEMPTS to increase its output
exponentially.  This is what destroys the amplifier.  As long as you wire
the speakers so the total load impedance is greater than 2 ohms per amp
channel (preferably 4 or 8 ohms- it would be safer) mix and match away.
Just remember for speakers wired in SERIES you just add the rated
impedances together. [per above: 8+8 = 16 ohm load]   For speakers wired in
PARALLEL, you add the inverse of each load together and then take the
inverse of that sum. [ 1/(1/8+1/8) = 4 ohm load ]  There are pros and cons
with each method of wiring, but parallel wiring is generaly preferred.  If
you would like to discuss this in more depth, we should probably move it to
private email.
Hope this helps.

	I have a 85.5 944 with the similar *intermittent* problem. I spent several

solving the problem but knowing more about my car.  Maybe we can work this
one with the help of the list.
	I found that when this unexpected rush of hot air occurs, the vacuum switch
controlling the heater valve is not doing its job. I tried to swap the two
identical vacum switch located besides the heater unit without success ....
therefore confirming that the switches were operating properly. 
	My next guess is that the heater control is not sending the proper signal to
the vacuum switch for an unknown reason. 
	I forgot to mentionned that I checked the outdoor and indoor temp sensor and
they are within specs (based on the workshop manual data) but I wasn't able
to checked the mixing chamber temp sensor because I have to remove a piece of
the dash that I have great *fear* to break ( the portion covering the middle
section where the heater control is located) in order to have access to the
connector.
	I also realized that the problem seems to be somehow related to the outside
temp since the problems occured frequently just before hibernation last fall
(but it occurred only once this spring... so i'm a little bit confused). Most
of the time I can retrigger the normal operation by switching a couple of
times the defrost button (which is turning the blower full blast, turning on
the A/C and turning the heat full... all done automatically)...... but
somethimes I had to open the window and looked like an idiot running on the
highway at freezing temp with the window open.
I bought the car in LA area and when I was there I had lots of problems .....
but the outside temp wasn't cold... so maybe there is a couple of temp ranges
that are screwed up on mine (at 90deg I was running like an idiot on freeway
with the heater full blast). Now I'm in Montreal, Canada but cold weather
seems to be more a problem??????? 
	The best thing would be to changed the heater control but it is *really
expensive* (George said once around $230 ...... George? Could you confirm?)
and see 
if it solve the problem.

Subject: 914 rust repair & free stuff


Hi folks.  Can't leave anything alone and the rust in the trunk of my
new purchase is mighty annoying.

The rust is not through the metal.  The largest spot is about 5 inches 
wide and pretty flakey.  Most of the spots are in the under 1" range, 
and either not flaking, or just barely starting to flake.  I've done body 
work and painting before, but not rust repair.

So, what's the procedure to fix this?  Preferably in a manner that will
last more than a year or two.  The whole rear trunk area looks like
it needs to be cleaned up and painted.  What would a body shop charge
me? (I may have the ability to fix it myself, but I'm also lazy :)

Also, what's the best way to seal up the tail light assemblies?
Apparently this is where the water is getting into the trunk.  Don't want
to repair it if I'm going to have a puddle in there again.  Seems like
a very common problem on 914's.

The Free Stuff:
1 914 bra, ugly.
a pair of seat covers, they seem ok.  nothing special about 'em, they're
foam with black velour on top.
If you're in the northern california bay area, you can pick 'em up.
Otherwise you pay shipping (probably $5 or so per item).

Subject: 944 good deal?

I am considering buying a 944 heres what I found out about it:


1984 944. Burgundy in color with tan interior.
 Power everything
including a power moonroof. Cruise control and working air
conditioning.  It has the black 5-spoke wheels with pirelli tires and
a descent sounding stereo. Price? $4500.  

Second owner car, has owned it since it had 40,000 miles and drove 
summers only as a highway commuter in wisconsin.  

Bad news, the commute added up to 1000 miles a
week, for 18 weeks(Three summers roughly) adds up to a grand total of
118,000 miles on the car.  It has the original exhaust which shows no intention
of rusting nor falling off.  It was scraped above the passenger side
rear wheel which is not pretty but not bad.  There is a dent to the
inside of the drivers side headlight, but covered by a bra.  I believe
it's a seperate panel and probably not difficult to fix.  The clear
coat is peeling in two spots, one on the sunroof, and one on the hood,
both the size of your computer screen or less.  Good news is that these can
come off easy and be repainted. Every thing I have mention is a easy
fix and it looks fine now, but adds up.  There seems to be a leak in
the power steering unit, and some fluid around the rear differential
cover, could be a gasket, it didn't make any whurring noises or clunks
out back, so I am inclined to think that the rearend is fine.  It rode
very smoothly.  

Any recommendations and/or good(cheap) mechanics?  The oil pressure
was very strong and it supposedly does not burn any oil.  

Drivers side headlight where the dent is doesn't go up or down, some
spring is broken I guess but the motor for it works. The owner is an
old guy whose wife drove it alot and he is easy on the car, he
practically killed it every time he started in first. 

What does everyeone think?

We list more than 100 944's each issue of PML and 83/84 cars seem to always
be between $3500 and $5500 unless they are very low mileage or have some
other notable positive factors involved (like new engine/trans/water

price on the car - I assume you'll try to negotiate the price down a be as

1. The brake pad warning light was on during my test drive, and sure enough,

Subject: Coming out of the Corner

Coming out of the Corner (Rated N for novice)

In my last posting, I made the statement that learning to come out of the
corner would provide you with 90% of your speed.  I'd like to prove the
validity of that statement, and explain the driving techniques require to do
this proficiently.  I am assuming that everyone knows what the terms turn-in
point, apex, and trackout mean.

The goal in driving on a race track is to get around the track as quickly as
possible.  Other factors, such as safety, car control, consistency, and
smoothness are all necessary ingredients, but the main goal is speed.  If you
consider the average race track, you will find that most of the time you are
accelerating.  On most tracks that I have run, about 60% of my time is spent
accelerating, 30% of my time is spent cornering AND accelerating, and 10% is
spent braking.  For ANY driver, I teach that the logical starting point would
be to work on the 90%, and forget about the 10% (for now).  Matter of fact,
as an "expert", when I learn a new track, the way I find out the line is to
figure out how to come out of the corners.  Only after I am satisfied with
that will I start to work on carrying more speed into the corner.

Those of you reading more carefully will notice that I mentioned the "L"
word; that right, the LINE.  I know, I know...it's the fastest way around the
track, it's the safest way, it's the only way, etc.  Like that (great?) rock
group Chicago once sang "Does anybody really know what line it is?" 8{).
ANYWAY, I feel that the line is comprised of two elements, the path that 
you drive into the corner, and the path that you drive out of the corner.
And as stated above, the path that you drive out of the corner is 9 times 
(90% vs. 10%) more important.  Simply stated, the line coming out of the
corner is the path that will let you accelerate as soon as possible, at full
throttle, around as much of the corner as possible, and down the following
straight.

The technique that I teach to do this is as follows:

1) Know where you want to turn-in at and apex the corner.

2) Brake moderately up to the corner.  Remember, it's only 10% of your speed,
so if you are slow here it's no big deal.  Besides, if you are too fast it
will screw up your entry to the corner.

3) Turn-in under full control, in an arc that will take you past the apex.

4) Pick up the throttle and SLOWLY floor it.  It should take about 3 seconds
from the time you touch the gas until it's floored.  Don't jam it down (not
yet anyway).

5) Drive past the apex, and slowly unwind the wheel as your speed increases.
You should get to the trackout point under control and be headed down the
straight.

If you have done this right, you will fly past the apex, and the car will
automatically drive out to the edge of the track, and down the straight.  If
you find that you have to tighten the steering (wrong thing to do) to avoid
running off of the track, your apex point is too early in the turn.  Go a
little deeper into the turn, turn-in a little harder, and apex a little
later.  Work up to this slowly.  Once you have found that you can drive past
the apex floored, try getting on the gas sooner after your turn-in.  The path
that you can take through the corner under full throttle, *that is the line
coming out of the corner*.

The point at which you pick up the gas and accelerate is called the
transition point.  Remember that for future discussions; I will refer to it
often.  This transition point is the part of the turn, in the beginning,
where you get off the brakes and get onto the gas.  The car will gain
stability, the rear will be "hooked up" and you can accelerate  through the
turn.  Knowing this point, and being able to find it consistently every lap,
is the key to the next step.

Is there any sort of an adjustment that can be made so that the motor

Yep, pretty good starting point.

What to do:

1) Have a reliable Porsche mechanic check out the car. You should spend
about $100 for his time to give you a reasoned evaluation of the car. You
can locate a pretty good mechanic through the officers of your local PCA
region. 

2) The items on a 1984 944 that will cost you big money to fix are:

Power steering leaks (rack, pump, hoses)
Timing belt failures
Water pump failures
Clutch disk 

The rest of the stuff is relatively cheap.

Assuming that the car passes a mechanic's scrutiny, and that you really want
it, you should offer something less than the asking price...Then work your
way up, if necessary.

With proper maintenance, the car will give another 100K miles of reasonably
reliable service.

Without proper maintenance, that car will give you about 20K miles of
headaches.

Also, if you do buy this car, join the PCA, and learn as much as you can
about your car from local, regional and national gurus on the subject...

Subject: Ted*osterone


Well folks, here's a sheepish story. This maneuver taught me that my 928 is 
capable of doing ungraceful things...

Been raining here in north Texas, and I had been out early in the day to visit the 
bank, Home Depot, typical Saturday stuff. Came home, did a couple of 
honey-do's, noted that my wife was still at work (the joy of a two-career 
household).

It got to be around 6pm and I decided to "make a run for the border" to grab 
some tacos for dinner. Got in the 928, backed out the long drive, pulled up to 
the corner which allows access to our development. This is a documented and 
signed "Dangerous Intersection" as it is at the top of a hill and almost blind from 
both sides. I looked left, looked right, and then the Tedosterone(tm) kicked in.

Glanced at my temp gauge, thought "It's warm, what the hell". No one coming 
either way. Started my left turn, then kicked it - hard. 288hp came screaming to 
life. Tires break loose. Rear end fishtails nicely. Let off the gas. Tires continue 
spinning. Totally off the gas now. Car is still fishtailing. Adrenaline rush kicks in. 
Car now out of my control. Car continues around in a wide 360 with me 
countersteering against the skid.

Car ends up on the same side of the road it started on, facing the way I didn't 
want to go. Five feet from the ditch and in light grass. Embarassed and shocked 
driver drives off in the wrong direction, hoping no one from the homeowner's 
association saw this little display.

** BE CAREFUL ** THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU ** 
** TEDOSTERONE IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE IGNORED! **

I can see my driving a little slower, a little more careful, a little more 
conservatively, and a little less in a juvenile manner. Had there been a curb on 
this road or the ditch a little closer, my little macho maneuver might have caused 
serious damage to me, or god forbid, my car :-).

Hanging my head in shame, and asking humbly for the T*d of the Month 
award...

The brake wear sensor is a continuous loop wire that is seated in a recess in
one of the brake pads of each wheel.  When the pad has worn sufficiently, the
brake disc will wear thru the wire.  When the wire is completely severed, the
connection is broken, and the brake pad sensor light will be illuminated. 
So...either your mechanic did not replace the wear sensor wires, or the front
pads need replacing also.  If you don't care about having the sensor light
operational, you can simply cut the sensor wires at each wheel and solder the
ends together, permanently shorting the circuits.

Trevor,
	Thanks for the note, you are absolutely right.  I should have sat down and 
written that reply after a little more thought; as it was I had to go to a meeting 
which is why I hurried it.  Not many people connect speakers in series, I think, 
so hopefully the gist of the message will be as you stated.  Get your local radio 
buff to do it.  As it stands Mike's stereo is a replacement so will therefore 
probably be a 4 watt.  So if he uses the factory connections, even though the 
cables are marked 10 Ohms; he should use 4 Ohm speakers.
	Thanks for the correction...

Larry,

I enjoyed your thoughts on learning to drive fast! The way you analyze a
track is about the same as I do. One thought I would add to the 10% that you
assign to braking.... since you do this (braking) at the time you are going
the fastest (at least on longer straights) it may, in fact, end up with
greater than a 10% effect on your lap times. However, I still agree that,
when you are learning a track, braking early and arriving at the corner
slower than you will later on, is the best way to start.

$13K for that car is a lot. I think that as a sports car, 944's go down in
value with a automatic, unlike other types of cars. You would eliminate a
substantial number of potential customers up front. That said, most
customers want to know if you are the first owner, reasons for bodywork or
paint, any new or upgraded parts, and want to see all service records. Get
the car detailed, make sure any dents are knocked out, that the hood shocks
work, and those types of little things. $13K should mean that the car is
indistinguishable from new. Take them on a test drive and tell them about
Porsche's racing heritage. Then hit them with how much a new clutch costs:)

 
You probably would get more for the 5-spd. Also, it may not cost that much
to trailer your car to the new job. For instance, it would cost about $350
to trailer my car 120 miles from Bridgehampton to NYC, but only about $850
to trailer 2000 miles to Florida. Could be very realistic, if the car
doesn't move at your price.

It's a simple system, really... You can change fuel pressure and/or
the injectors to get more gas, change the manifold sensor and temperature
sensors to modify when the brain seeks to enrich the mix, etc. Try
to understand what it's really doing first, then the modifications make
more sense.

The vacuum brake bleeder that I made was out of a 30 lb freon can, but a
large steel can, the size of a 20 lb propane bottle will work just as well.
 I have a vacuum gauge, 1/4" tube, and a shutoff valve attached to the tank.
 I use a refrigeration vacuum pump to pull a 25" vacuum, but any small pump
that can pull to 25" will work.  They are available for less than $130.  I
use a 1/4" schrader flare fitting to attach my vacuum pump, and I remove it
once I have pulled a vacuum.  If I were to use a dedicated pump, I would
probably attach it permanently, and valve it off, or use a check valve.  I
hook the tube to the brake nipple, and pull about a reservoir full of fluid
through each caliper.  You will also pull some air around the nipple threads,
but the air will not get into the caliper.  Remember that by decreasing the
pressure on the fluid, any entrapped air bubbles will expand, and become
easier to suck out.  It works very well.  After my tank gets alot of fluid in
it, I pressurize it slightly, and blow the old fluid out.  Let me know how
you make out.

have been replaced recently and all four wheels have been balanced. Does 
anybody have an idea to what could be causing this ?  Suggestions are 
appreciated.

Subject:       Salvaged 1991 911 Turbo

Thanks for the responses to my earlier inquiry about the valus of a 
1991 turbo,
The reason I had asked is that I am looking at possibly purchasing a 
stripped car that still has the engine and trandmission. They say 
that the car is in excellent condition except for the part which are 
missing. Another words, the strippers were for some reason very 
careful in removing the parts so as to not damage the car??? The car 
has 8000 miles on it.
What is missing is:
Both doors, engine deck lid and tail, hood, front and rear bumper, 
side rockers, all exterior lighting.
Both seats, rear seat backs, removable carpet, all gagues (guess they 
knew the mileage from previous owner) stereo, and some other "stuff" 
from under the dash.
Intercooler, turbo, muffler.
Wheels and tires.
It sounds like the car was recovered before the "salvagers" had a 
chance to finish their job.
My intention is to put the car back together for the street for 
myself  and possible for resale in the future. Now that we have 
determined the street prices, does anyone have a value that they 
think that this car would be worth?

Over the last several weeks I have been replacing 21+ year old oil lines, 
stainless steel brake lines, and the like on my 1974 911.  I'm now 
looking at the fuel lines which also appear to be in need of replacement.
It appears that the lines that go through the tunnel are (or were) a
"clear plastic" material that connect to typical braided cover lines 
outside  of the tunnel.  Have any of you replaced these "clear plastic"
lines?  What type of replacement lines did you use?  Did you encounter  
any problems in the replacement procedure?  Any suggestions would be

I have a '69 911S with the optional 100 liter fuel tank. Recently the fuel

My chices I've decided on so far are:

1) Find someone that happens to have one of these units (part# 901 741 801 0)

2) Put in a unit from a 62 liter tank and live with it reading empty sooner

Just having read the story about gene doing a 360 in his 928.  I was driving my 
928S in the UK near Liverpool, where there is a huge roundabout -uh- (traffic

own business when an XR2 Fiesta (yes these things are called "hot hatches" and 
very popular with the kiddies in the UK, although not so popular with the 
insurance companies) overtakes me on the inside on a left turn (yes on a 
roundabout)  I cannot believe this audacity, and start to ease the power on as 
we are exiting the bend.  Then I noticed the wet patch...  A full spin later and 
still going into the same direction only two lanes over, I manage to catch the 
wheels spinning in the way they were intended to, so I slow down and park the 
expensive toy in a conveniently located (i.e. close) lay-by for a quick change 
of undergarments.
	Yes Gene, these puppies will really spin, and looking at it it's 
understandable; the wheelbase is nearly square, and you sit nearly on the back 
wheels.  I treated this car with mucho respect in the wet after this.  The 944 
is much more driveable, although I haven't done any serious wet work yet.

Hey Peter and other Porschephiles,
	Wow, an '85 924.  I read in a Porsche book of mine that they 
continued to make a 924 from '82 to '86 for Europe only, with the 
'86.5-'88 924S following, but I've never had a chance to hear of an 
example.  About your shaking nose (might want to see a doctor :^), this 
is a common problem for early 944s and is probably the case with an '85 
924.  It has to do with the steering/suspension assembly, but this is the 
extent of my knowledge.  Write George B. at george@mhv.net and ask him 
how to fix an early 944 shimmy, it should apply to your car too.
	About the '85 924, Your address seems to come from Europe, where 
are you?  Also, is there much difference in your 924 from earlier models?
Does it have a rear spoiler and four wheel disk brakes?  Did they 
continue the 924 Turbo as well for Europe from '83-'86?  Please reply, 
I'm *dying* to know more about the Euro models! 

Thanks

Subject: 951 Cooling Problems

I recently posted here about the apparent large swings in
the coolant temperature (as indicated by the temperature
gauge) of my '88 951 (64K miles). I decided to bleed air
from the cooling system by opening the bleed bolt and adding
coolant until coolant began to run out of the bleed fitting.
Closed the bleed bolt and noted that the coolant level in
the tank was about 3/4" above the "maximum" rectangle on
the tank. Several test drives, extended traffic stops, etc.
later the temperature gauge now indicates much smaller swings
in coolant temperature. I think the thing to be learned from
this is that opening the bleed and filling to the "maximum"
point is probably not going to force air out of the system -
you have to see coolant at the bleed point before you can be
reasonably sure that you have done the job. Others may know
this but from the number of posts in the archives it appears
that many don't.

I don't want to start a war , but I would ike some advice on purchasing 
a 911 vs a 928.  I have read the FAQ's and didn't really find out 
anything about a 928.  I read some porsce books but nothing really 
turned up on the 928.  I love the shape of the 911, and am intersted in 
a 1975 911S and a 1980 SC.  Both seem in my price range though the SC is 
a little more than I really wanted to spend and does have 130,000 miles 
on it.  The 911S has 70K original miles. 

After talking to a few owners of 911's most of them say the cars are 
hard to drive and noisy and would better recommend a 944 or 928.
I know the 928 is more luxurious, especially for everyday driving.  What 
is the reliablity and performance like vs a 911?  I have in mind a 1984 
928 that is being sold by a dealer.  

BTW are the 911 0-60 figures in the FAQ accurate.  Most of the books 
seem to claim 0-60 times in the 5-6 sec range while the FAQ claims 6-8 
sec.

Finally, do all 911's leak oil?

Re recent bra and CD questions...
The Colgan bra for my 84 cab constantly trapped debris in the hood
pocket, leaving sand and dried leaves to vibrate around.  Had to remove
the bra every few days to prevent abrasions.  The bra also has to be
removed after any rain and before washing.  Just isn't worth it, IMO,
unless you want to hide damage.

A nice stereo solution for those 84-89 Carrera owners who want to
keep the car stock but are interested in playing CD's is the Pioneer
10 disk changer with wireless remote (about $490). Run it off any
FM radio.  Sound quality was great with my Blaupunkt Reno and some
decent replacement speakers and a 4 channel amp.  The LED receiving
unit fits *perfectly* over the cubby hole below the A/C controls and
matches the interior look.  No wires show.  Velcro the remote to the
seatback rake handle for a good aim and to keep it out of the way.
This unit almost never skipped in my stock 88 turbo look targa (i.e.,
firm ride).  Don't know if it fits other Porsches as well.  Maybe the
SC?  Is the console the same?

Palmer,
  You know what they say about what something is worth, "it's worth exactly 
what a non-distressed seller that has a willing purchasers commitment (and 
check!)". FYI a 1988 944 has a NADA book of $10900 (Retail) and a loan value
of $7800. Add 1200 for the miles, all the other options are a wash (not 
considered inthe book). The reason I mention this is that many sales are
directly controled by the bank. This is what the bank uses to establish
value on the vehicle. Not that it's correct all the time, but that is how 
they do it. I usualy tell prospective buyers that I am asking X and I am
negotiable, motivated but not distressed seller. I usualy keeps the jerkoffs
out of the game. As far as negotiations are concerned, I only negotiate with
a qualified, commited buyer. IE "Mr. Buyer, if the terms and price are to 
your satisfication, will you pay and own NOW?" Then I get into negotiations.
No reason to drop your drawers for a "shopper". And to the shoppers I let 
them know there are realy 2 things to shop for. #1 is the vehicle, #2 is the
price on the qualifing vehicle. This breaks it down to a simple task. IE when
you are done "shopping for vehicles" and have decided that you would would 
own this one, that part of the sale is compleat (the vehicle sale) the 2nd 
part of the sale is to show better value in the product than one has in 
their $$$. See Sales 101 :-}  That's how I do it, it keeps people from being 
offended by pricing and makes it easy to consumate a transaction when
booth parties are satisfied.

Hi Asad,

Well, here's the easy one.  No, not all 911s leak oil.  My '86 doesn't (yet).

As to the other stuff, there's only one way to determine which model is
right for you.  Drive a few examples of each.  High performance has both

Subject: MIG welder maladies.


Greetings all you hands-on types!

  <kyle sez:>
  I'm one of those guilty of using an el-cheapo MIG welder and
now that mine has 3+ years of heavy use, it is showing its age.
  It starts with poor wire feed, like intermittent.  I surmise the cause
is the pinch roller and/or feed hoze wearout.  Another problem
is the size of the roll of wire you use.  I really like the 9 pound
spool, but these are so heavy and the darn machine is poorly
setup for this type of load -it too can cause poor wire feed.
  This can really screwup your welds, so beware.

  Another cause of crummy welds is slag buildup in the nozzle.
    -particularly when doing inverted position welding. . .
Sometimes causing a short to the schnoz, causing the thing to
become 'hot'.  If you weld anything like I do, you occasionally
dip the nozzle into the work, causing a temporary short circuit.
  All this robs your weld of heating current or at least disrupts the
gas envelope, and can screwup your welds. . .beware.

  So the moral of the story is:  keep your schoz clean; use a nozzle
protectant such as spatter-pruf (avoid silicone gunks and sprays).
  Do prepare weld site and vicinity as bare metal clean as possible.
  Do keep on hand spare parts such as nozzles, tips, rollers, and
maybe a hoze.
  Do add to your machine a ball bearing setup such as a 'lazy susan'
to aid the spool in moving freely (in horizontal orientation), (cook up
your own solution for vertical) as the plastic arrangment will wear out,
causing delays in your work.    (AAaarrgghhh!!)

  For those doing inverted position welding:
  Do use your leathers, gloves, skull cap and chaps, or at least cotton
jeans and . . .socks.  Even then droplets may 'tan' your hide.
  Do use a protective shield over your hood's viewscreen.
  Do keep a fire extinguisher within reach.
  Do avoid inhaling welding fumes, thus 'fume fever'.
  Do avoid welding in drafty locations (gas mig).
  <do penetrate deeply>  =:)

  Do *NOT* use a 'weld thru' zinc coating in vicinity of welds. -it wont 
work.

Subject: Re: Chips for Porsches

The day I went on vacation Stan wrote some fairly discouraging things about
chips, and even though it was 2 weeks ago, I would like to put the other
side of the story. 

Firstly, I get the impression that Stan is a Porsche man! By that I mean
that if it is not approved by Porsche, it's usually  not worth bothering
with. This impression has been made over several weeks of reading his very
knowledgeable replies to all sorts of questions.

I am happy (very happy in fact) to accept that the Autothority mass flow
system does not get his approval :)

Let me address the question of chips alone for Porsche cars, and start off
by stating that the last 25 944 normally aspirated cars sold in England were
sold with a Superchip fitted to get another claimed 25 HP. This was a
marketing ploy designed to move the cars along while everyone was waiting
for the much acclaimed 968s. That is only a small part of our pedigree in
association with the importers (not Porsche)

The Bosch systems are comparatively easy to reprogram and we can get more
power out of the engines by doing it. We get 25 HP from the 993 engines and
it has been done without putting a car on the dyno. Yes we do have a dyno
here, a very expensive one in fact, but the problem with reprogramming the
993 was not in getting more power out of it but in defeating the built in
protection system. 

Once that had been done, the reprogramming follows simple guidelines. After
all when you have reprogrammed over 300 different types of  Bosch computers,
you tend to find the common denominators which control the way power can be
increased. So yes, given a chip, I can whip up an improved program for it.
It won't be the very best program because I would need to put that car on
the dyno and make a chip for only that car, but it will be better than stock
and nearly perfect for any car with that engine in it. The 25 HP figure came
later when a customer brought his car in and we finally got it on the dyno.
The changes we made to the chip we had been selling  were
very small and concerned only the fuelling at one point on WOT which was 1%
richer than we prefer.

When Stan said he spent 65 hours on the dynbo programming a chip, I can
sympathise with him. It's hard work. However, that is because the  whole
character of the engine is being changed for racing. With a road car, it,s
not being changed just honed to perfection, and that is a lot easier because
Bosch got it most of the way there in the first place, just leaving us with
a little more fine tuning. Always the same amount in the  same places!

The second part of Stans posting was about reverse engineering the chip.
Well, it simply doesn't happen! Unless I need to change how the software
works, I don't need to reverse engineer it. All I want to do is advance the
ignition and tune the fuelling and to do this you need to know which are
timing maps and which are fuelling maps and when you have done 300 of them,
you can do it while scrolling through a hex dump of the code. As it happens,
Bosch engineers are so predictable that we have written a program to
identify which is map and which is code. 

I dont know why Porsche leave this power increase for us to find. I am
grateful that they do and when I sell a chip for a Porsche I rarely get it
back as not doing what I claimed it would do. So ease off Stan, and accept
that even a Porsche can be improved, and it can be done in America too.

I won't attempt to compare the 911 to the 928.  They are very
different.  My recommendation is to drive them both.  I will
say some things from my experience as someone who is owned by
a 928.

I am very happy with my choice (928).  I think it is the best
all around choice for me, since I do a so much driving, from
stop and go to wide open highway.  The feel of luxury, stability,
and power is a plus that is hard to quantify--test drive one.
An acqaintance of mine has repeatedly made trade offers to me--
his 911 plus cash for my 928.  His wife wishes for a 928, also.

However, I am a power freak.  Enough is never enough.  The 928
is probably much more expensive to build for power.  Parts are
more expensive, and most of what you do will need to do for
that power involves custom engine building and fabrication of
one-of-a-kind parts.

Aside from that, repairs can be more expensive.  New parts are
astronomical in price, if purchased from Porsche.  Take for
example, $2000 to $3000 for a radiator, or several thousand
dollars for one body panel, or $600 for a glove box door.
Luckily, used parts can be had for a lot less.  However,
expect to have to set aside two or three hundred a month to
cover unexpected repair costs (less, if you buy a well kept
late model, or drive it less).

You just need to drive one, and decide if what it feels like
outweighs the costs.

One more thing:  Buy as new a 928 as you can afford.  '89 or
'90 is a good candidate.  The reason is that, if you consider
purchase price AND the first few years of repairs and
refurbishing, you will probably spend more on the '84.

I have a 16 ft hobie cat that I race, and I no longer have a tow vehicle.  I

the exchange rate was almost 2 USD = 1 GBP.  Needless to say I didn't do the

will be here in the US.

BTW, tongue weight on my boat trailer is about 55 to 65 lbs.  Boat trailer and

will always be dicey, ut you can sure go in style, and I could still put the

Subject: 66 912 Fuel Smell


I would start looking for the source of the fuel "smell" by:

1.  Remove the metal plate which covers the access to the M.Cyl
	and gas tank underneath the car.   Carefull, these may
	be rusty and you may need some penetrant to get these
	loose without breaking the bolts/nuts off!

	Inspect the connection of a short (maybe 8") length of rubber
	fuel line which connects the gas tank to the one-piece gas line
	which runs the length of the shift tunnel and exits near the
	transmission.  The fitting on the gas tank may be loose or
	the rubber fuel line may need to be changed.

	There is another gas tank fitting/plug if you need to
	drain the gas tank right next to it.

2.  Open the rear inspection plate on the tunnel by the rear seats
	and stick your nose in there and check for fumes.

	If its there, then the metal line has been rusted and is leaking
	in the tunnel.  That could be tricky to replace (I replaced
	mine while replacing the floor pan(s)).


3.  Jack up the rear and check where the one-piece metal gas line
	exits the "tunnel" and connects to another rubber line.
	This is also a short rubber line and connects up to another
	metal gas line that goes over the wheel well and up into
	the engine compartment.

4.  Look in the engine compartment:

	- Inspect where the metal gas line enters the engine compartment
	and connects to another rubber line that goes to the fuel
	pump on the engine.

	- Inspect the rubber fuel lines that feed the carbs (note,
	you'll need to check the rubber/metal lines that run between
	carbs behind the engine fan shroud.
	

Good Luck!  I think I remembered all the metal/rubber places to look.
if I missed any - let me know and I'll look at my '66 912 or
someone else on the net can lend his/her expertise.

Subject: Repairing Gas Gauge (Spelled Right!) Sender


Tim-

I just replaced the wire in my sending unit with some 'standard' 
resistance wire and it seems to work OK.  No need to silver solder. I 
don't think it's as strong as Manginine, and probably won't last as 
long, but the wire in the sender is pretty well protected so who 
knows?

Reid Zeigler gave me a five foot piece of wire and has graciously
agreed to provide pieces to those who really need it.  I repeat his 
message to me here:

"Go ahead and post your repair procedure and you can list me as
a source for the wire. The wire will be free, although I'd like
to reserve it for those who really need it. They can send a stamped,
self addressed envelope to:

     Reid Zeigler
     19 Ravine Drive
     Matawan, NJ 07747"

For those who are interested, here are the details.  The wire is thin, so 
be careful. The original sender wire is very light, about 0.004" in 
diameter.  Reid's wire is a bit less than this once the insulation is 
removed, maybe 0.003".  It's not easy working with stuff that fine.

First, you have to strip off the lacquer insulation from the wire.  I 
stretched the wire between two nails in a long board, and put a few 
drops of paint remover on a small piece of fine sandpaper (600 or so) 
folded, and sort of carefully rubbed up and down the wire a few 
times to get the lacquer off.  You can see when it's off; the wire looks 
silver instead of black.  I also slid an ohmeter along it to make sure 
there were no missed spots.

Someone (I can't remember who) recently provided an excellent, 
detailed account of what the sender looks like.  In brief, the sender is 
wired with a single strand, about 24" long, although you need more 
like 36" to work with.  The strand forms a long U, about 10" on each 
leg, and about 1" across the bottom.It's soldered at the top of each end 
of the U to a bracket at the top of the tank that consitutes the top of 
the sender, and loops over a 1" plastic (hence insulated) bracket at the 
bottom of the sender, which is near the bottom of the tank.  A float 
rides up and down the U, making contact with the wires on each leg, 
and shorting them.  Thus,  when full, with the float at the top, 
resistance across the U is zero.  At the bottom, when empty, the 
resistance is about 60-70 ohms (for a standard tank, a bit more for the 
oversized tank).  The original wire is about 36 ohms/foot.  

The thinner wire might not be as sturdy as the original, but the 
sender is very well protected and there really are no forces acting on 
the wire other than the float slowly going up or down.  The thing is
constructed so the entire U is housed in an aluminum cylinder with a
small hole in it to allow gas to flow in or out.  This damps out 
sloshing in the gas  tank.

Subject: 75 911 S: repair or sell?

Yesterday my '75 911 S Targa started making a terrible rattling noise.
Could be a big end bearing failure or pulled studs (the idle RPM went up
too: is this a sign of pulled studs?). Anyway, I think this could mean a
total rebuild.

Now the question is: repair or sell?
I am on temporary assignment in the US (San Diego) and may return to Europe
in the fall.
Since I arrived (about 1.5 years ago) the car served me very well: it drove
well and has a nice body (Southern California car).
However given that I cannot keep the car and that I don't have too much
time, I don't want to go for a total rebuild (I do not intend to take it
over to Europe since I have another P-car there).

Does it make sense to look for a replacement engine (not necessarily fresh
rebuild) and are any decent ones around for not too much $?
Or is there any chance I could sell the car as it is?  If yes, what would
be a sensible asking price?
Given the constraints, I think I would prefer to sell it if I could get
somewhere around 3500 $.

Any reactions would be highly appreciated.

Subject: Re: 75 911 S: repair or sell?

To repair or to sell, IMHO, would depend on the condition of the body.
If it were my own car, which I've owned since new and still has
original paint, I'd repair it.  But you could learn from my own
experience.  My engine self-destructed at about 66K, but I have had no
trouble since, other than an oil leak which it has had since new.  I
have 50K on the rebuild, with a new case and pistons.

BUT, if I had it to do over again (and I hope I don't), I'd put in an
SC or later engine, which would have a greater life expectancy than
the ill-fated 2.7.

Good luck.

If you hooked up the ignition kill to your fuel gauge as well, this *should*
help.  Then the situation would be very similar to having a near-empty
tank at the time of the heist.  Don't forget to hook up the low fuel idiot
light as well.  No form of "fuel level" deception would be involved, which
may get you sued.  If the thief actually looked at the fuel gauge, he'd see
an empty tank which is what he'd experience after a minute of driving.

Subject: missing air pump - what, me worry?


I've been prepping my recently purchased '84 928S (62k mi) for the 
driving season.  I believe the car has had some accident damage, but
I'm not sure how much.  Anyways, I have discovered that there's an 
empty pully where my air pump should be!  Should I worry?

I checked the emissions equipment diagram in the owner's manual and
it shows the output of the air pump to go to three places:
1. Catalytic converter
2. throttle assembly
3. air cleaner (behind the filter)

Before I bought the car, the catalytic converter had been replaced.
It is most likely not a Porsche part.  The dealer had this installed 
and paid $175 for the part - Stoddard wants $3000 (yes, $3k) for the 
Porsche part.  After inspecting it, I found no port for an air hose to 
attach -but- the Euroselect catalog doesn't see the connection for the 
air pump.  What's happening here?

Sometimes when the car is running I'll get white smoke - usually
after starting, which has been once a week, and sometimes during
extended idle.  I don't *think* there's a coolant leak.

I know the air pump is there for a reason, but what's the impact of
not having one?  Surely, I need to cap the air pump's port on the air
cleaner assembly, but why is air fed into the throttle assembly?
Why the cat conv, and air cleaner for that matter?

Can I run without the air pump?

Finally, if this is something I need to install, since this is emissions
emissions equipment is there any legal recourse against the dealer even 
though the car was bought as used ('as-is')?

Gee, other than that, the car performs well and looks even better!

Any comments greatly appreciated!

Subject: 914 F.I. Question??

Perhaps this has been covered before, if so please direct me to 
archives if appropriate.  

I recently purchased a '72 914 1.7 which still has the injection and 
upon changing the oil as part of the "major service" I noticed the
distinct smell of gasoline in the oil.  It was quite thinned and not
real slippery.  Most of my past experience has been troubleshooting
carburetors, so I'm not sure where to start.  Apparently an injector
is leaking, but I seem to remember that there is a cold start injector
that acts like a choke.  It must be a slow leak because it runs ok
and would have probably filled up the crankcase by now if it wasnt. 

If anyone with experience could give some advice as to what would 
be the best sequence to isolate the leak, it would be greatly 
appreciated.

Theory has it that the nice folks at Shasta Design have a set
of custom 3.0 pistons for about a kilobuck a set. You can get

Dear Jay,
(In reply to your message dated Monday 24, April 1995)
I am a new reader of the Porschephiles pages and was interested to read your piece about 944 'shimmy'. Now I didn't see the original mention of 944 shimmy
but thought you might like to hear a story which is true - I know it happened.  I was there!
I live in England (precisely where I'll not tell you in case my local dealer reads these pages!)
In 1984 a friend of mine took his new 944 back to the main dealer for it's first sevice and was greeted enthusiastically by the salesman. Presumbaly because
he had just spent a lot of money!
 The salesman asked if he was happy with his 944 and if he had encountered any problems. My friend replied that he was 95% 
happy with the car but was a little concerned that the car was pulling to the left quite noticeably. (We drive on the left here remember!) The salesman
replied with sickening sincerity that this was part of the car's design. The 944 had, he wanted us to accept, been built to pull to the left to avoid drifting
into oncoming traffic in the event of the driver losing concentration or falling asleep! 
It was, he pointed out, true therefore that left hand drive cars (U.S. and mainland Europe etc.) were designed to pull to the right for the same reason.
I know it sounds an unlikely story but I swear it's true. As a footnote, my friend traded his 944 shortly afterwards for a Jaguar - which didn't have the same
features!

Hi Jay,

I'm afraid i'll have to disappoint you :-( They didn't change the 
basic design of the 924 after '82. So I don't have four disk brakes 
and the supension is the same as the 82 model. The good news is that  
a turbo style rear spoiler became standard in '83 and all the 944 
luxury goodies, like the electric sunroof etc,  were also an option 
for  the 924. Furthermore, we have the advantage of the 125 hp 
engine, but this is true for all european models.  In Europe , the 924
turbo also didn't make it past '82. It was succeeded by the 944, the
177 hp model being the last one.

I bought my car in Germany (I live in the Netherlands which is next 
to it) because the cars seem to be quite a lot cheaper than here and they 
always seem to be equiped with all possible options. And last but not 
least, driving on German autobahns is great !

Hope this satisfied your information need a bit :-) ,

From a safety standpoint, 2 or 3 layer nomex is the best bet.

As for a roll bar: Put in a cage. From a safety standpoint, the cage is the
best possible bet. make sure that it does not mount to the floor pan, but tp
the frame rail wherever possible.

Mount your net to the cage. Mounting it to the door is useless. in a hard
rollover situation, the door could pop open, and now your net is outside of
the car.

You get maximum power transfer when the resistance/impedance is "matched" 
to the driver circuit.

The fact that the speakers are mis- matched means that power gets 
disippated in the power amp and wiring rather than the speakers the 
amount of power that gets delivered to the speakers is 4X4/10X10 of the 
available power ie you can only get about 1/6 of the max power ie around 
8dB down - this equates to winding the vol knob back from full to 3/4

Most well designed amps have built in self limiting to stop you blowing 
up the output stage - distortion is an audible sign that the 
self limiting is working.

If you are a member of the human race ( rather than an 18 year old mutant 
), then you probably drive round with the vol at < 1/2 max and will not 
notice any difference. 

If you do find the noise is bad - use the following steps
	make the partner(PC auto insertion) walk home
	turn of the radio and listen to that fantastic exhaust roar

	The light is activated by a "sensor" which clips onto the brake pad. This
is just a plastic covered piece of wire (the 944 uses a similar 
system), and when
the pad wears down the plastic wears through, earthing the wire against 
the disk
("grounding the wire against the rotor" in US-speak) and turning on the light.

	The sensors are quite expensive (of the same order of cost as a pad, I
think) and the answer is usually to change your pads *before* the light 
goes on.

	I've found the gear change on my '89 911 Carrera 3.2 (with the G50
gearbox / hydraulic clutch) to be a bit difficult, specifically when 
going into a
gear (*any* gear!) ... there seems to be a slight resistance when going from
neutral *into* the gear. Double declutching overcomes this, but I don't always
want to do this, especially in a heavy traffic commute. Some people have told
me that all 911s do this, others that I'm try to change gear too quickly, and
others that I may have a problem with my gear linkage.

> 3. The original clock does not work.  Anyone have any simple suggestions on

	One of the advantages of the 911 is that the gauges are all separate and
and quite easy to remove. On the RHD car the clock s on the right hand side and
I can get to the back of it through the luggage compartment without popping
anything. Put a voltmeter across the terminals and see if there is 12V 
there. Also
check the fuse.

I was faced with the same decision in 1986, and I made it wrong (for me, that

or a daily driver? Is comfort important?  Certainly the answer is different
for everyone, but if you are going to commute to downtown Baltimore in the
car every day, you should try to spend some time in stop and go traffic with
each car, especially the 911.  After a year, I gave the 928 to my wife, and
got a 911 - then we traded both on a Carrera 2.  I'd recommend a 1987 or

I know I agree with Stan.  My admittedly naive understanding is that the only

Put the engine on a dyno, modify these variables for max torque at a given
load and you've maximized engine output. 

I think it is smoke and mirrors.
These guys start raising the redline and changing timing for better fuel.
Try playing the same game, i.e., same redline and required octane rating
and I think you will not do better than Porsche.  Sure, you may add a little,
but at what expense.  Being an engineer, I am cognizant of the compromises
that must be made to generate the best *OVERALL* design in response to a 
given set of requirements.  All you guys are doing is changing the 
requirements, i.e., tuning the engine for more expensive gas. 

I have installed an Autothority chip in my "87" 944.  In 3rd gear from 1000
rpm to 6000 rpm the performance improved by 0.25 seconds over a 16 second
period, about what you would expect in going from 87 to 94 octane.  But you
have now increased the operating costs by $0.25/gal and decreased engine
life by some undeterminable amount.  You have not increased the *OVERALL*
performance with this kind of modification.  I have since sent the chip
back and reinstalled the original.

Why do you think my "87" 944 didn't 
come with a rear roll bar?  Porsche came up with a very good ride handling 
compromise.  As soon as I added the rear bar, the ride changed dramatically.
On uneven pavement, I get tossed around in the car where before I didn't even
notice the uneven pavement.  This may not make sense to the individual who 
autocrosses and to whom ride quality means nothing, but as a daily driver
I consider it a challenge to get the most out of the car as is and am con-
sidering removing the rear bar.  It also understeers just a tad now, but 
that can be controlled with tire pressure and throttle.  The car is a tad
more confident feeling through a corner now - but at what expense?  The same 
arguement applies to the chip.

the car based on a different set of requirements."

I've thought of doing exactly this.  My 911 has the blank locations for the
headlight washer switch, and the sunroof switch, but these rocker switches are
the momentary kind.  I would need to use them to switch on a relay, or modify
them to be toggles.  I would prefer the latter.  Does anyone know of a small
Porsche rocker type switch that is a toggle mechanism, or has anyone modified
one of the existing switches to be a toggle?

Boy, I wish I did. I need some too. You should look into the new 
replacement pistons produced by Shasta Design. They fit your existing

Yeah, it sounds nice, but sounds unrealistic to me (IMHO). 240 hp 
sounds obtainable without turning the car into snarling beast. 
Snarling beasts are good, if that is what you seek, but there are 
probably better recipes for  275 hp street engines than one based on 
normal aspiration and CIS injection.  Let me know if you are

>that acts like a choke.

        The Cold Start injector is on the intake air distributor (the
plenum that the four intake runners come out of and the throttle goes
into).  On the 2.0 it is in the left-rear corner--not sure about the
1.7's.  It is most likely held on by two screws or bolts.  If you take
it out, get a new gasket for it.
        The "regular" injectors are held in by one 10mm nut each.  No
gaskets required, just a pair of rubber "donuts" each.  The nut goes
on a metal bit shaped something like:
                   _
                  /o\           o   = where the stud from the intake goes
                 / _ \          _
                ( (_) )        (_)  = where the injector goes
                 `---'

        To check them out, pressurize the system (e.g., start the car,
then shut it down) and take out one injector at a time.  If one or more
is leaking *at all* it should be thoroughly cleaned or replaced.  It is
safest to just replace it.  Oh, and watch out for dripping gasoline on
hot engine parts...  Engine fires really, really suck.
        Hmm--you should also check the Thermo-Time switch which controls
the Cold Start Valve.  It should have a specific resistance (I think)
when cold and one when hot.  I beleive that the correct procedure is in
Haynes.  (Don't have my manuals with me at work today  8)

While I don't really have an opinion on the issue being debated,
I do have to observe that this is specious reasoning. As it happened, your
set of requirements turned out to be closer to Porsche's than to those
of the aftermarket chip and roll bar makers. That does not imply that
the car is not improved for someone whose requirements ARE better 
served by the changes provided by those components. 

As you say, part of engineering is determining the tradeoffs that best meet
the requirements. However, as engineers I think we can also say that we place
those requirements in the middle of our target audience bell curve. There are
always users whose requirements we have not matched completely, and their
equally legitimate requirements can be served by third parties.

In response to text from thak chaloemtiarana:

>I am looking for steel flares for my 914 (cover wider tires for Solo II).

Speaking of flares, I've heard various opinions on the merits and headaches
of a 5-lug conversion on a 914.  Some say that not only do the hubs need to
be drilled at the rear, but also the entire front suspension needs to be 
replaced(upgraded).  I had thought that only all four hubs needed to be
modified.

When you put flares on a 914 one naturally wants to go with 8-inch rear wheels
and 7-inch front wheels to fill out the flared fenders.  Personally, I like
the look of "stuffed" wheel wells.  

Without the modifications, one could get 6-inch front, 7-inch rear, 4-lug 
wheels.  I'd like to hear what others who may have experience with flaring
914s have to say about the decisions they made.

In response to text from Andrew Kalman:

>My notes indicate that the '017 is the correct head temp resistor.  But I
>don't know about the in-line resistor - I hope someone can answer that ...

I received some advice regarding head temp sensors and idle mixture that I'll
pass on:

A head temperature sensor varies resistance with temperature which in turn
causes the "brain" to alter the mixture appropriately.  People speak of the
270-ohm resistor trick, but with a little time and effort you can get much
better results when it comes to calibrating the head temp sensor.

Needed:		a) variable resister ("pot") from radio shack
		b) means of measuring for stoich(lamba, Gastester, etc.)
		c) multimeter

Throw the potentiometer in series with your head temperature sensor and 
start the engine cold.  Vary the resistance with the pot until the best
cold idle mixture is obtained.  Remove pot and measure resistance across 
it, run out to radio shack get the appropriate resistor and install it
where the pot was.

This technique is handy when major engine modifications have been done(like
my little '70 1.7, 96mm NPR, FAT FI cam, 2.0 injector, beast).

        Reply to:   RE>Porschephiles #1350 Ingnition Kill

I, too, inquired about delayed ignition kill switches, and was told that they
were unavailable because of the liability questions if the car were to, say,
die in the middle of an intersection, or during a lane change on the freeway. 
I think that problem is solvable by programing the system to kill the ignition
after three minutes, but then only when the car comes to a stop.  This could
safely happen at the next red light, in heavy traffic, school crossings  etc. 
This would be OK I think for general security, plus I like the idea of really
inconveniencing the thief.
  
I was also interested in an anti-car-jacking measure.  The real problem I see
with this system or any other is in how to design it so that you can easily
and discretely trigger the sequence without being noticed by the car-jacker,
and at the same time make it difficult for the owner to accidentally trigger
the sequence.  Certainly a car is not worth dying over, but if there were a
safe way of triggering a system it might be worth having.  Maybe a pressure
(or lack of pressure) sensor in the seat AND a discrete switch, both of which
must be triggered within 30 seconds of each other with the engine idling to
activate the system?  More importantly, could I retire on the royalty income
from this?

It seems we agree almost perfectly.  But my point is also that the chips
do not do what they claim to do which is increase torque by as much as
10 - 15%.  Most of the claims lead one to believe that the factory has
somehow not extracted everything that can be extracted from an engine
which they designed and built; and that they know some secret place
to get 10% that the factory does not know is there.

What about the anti theft devices available today... the "Lojack system"?

        As far as I know, the Lojack system is localize and is available 
currently only in LA, San Diego and New York.  The use proprietary/private 
tracking systems installed only in the aforemention cities.

        There is another system call "Satrac" (I think that's the name) that is 
a combo GPS/cellular and has national coverage (As long as it's in cellular 
coverage, it'll work).  When your car is stolen/jacked, you call your car to 
have it transmit it's GPS location via cellular to a monitoring station, the 
monitor station then tramits the car's location to local authorties.

        On a side note, anyone know why GPS and Cell phone development kits are 
so damm expensive (complete GPS units are < $400, cell phones are < $100, kits 
range from $4600 !! to $500 !!)

I always hesitate at the thought of drilling more holes in the hubs in
order to change the bolt pattern.  It doesn't seem terribly safe to me.
Perhaps I'm paranoid....I just think of all the extreme cornering forces
exerted on the wheels and suspension and don't like the thought
of "swiss-cheese" hubs holding on my wheels.

I have 911 'S' front struts on my 914.  They just bolted right in place.
Along with the 5-bolt upgrade, I now have EXCELLENT brakes on
my car.  The difference is amazing.  I also had the extra expense
of 8x15 wheels and tires too, though.  Don't forget this when pricing
out your new flaring/wheel package.

The rear of my car was done by bolting in 911 hubs and stub axles.
VW Bus CV joints were used since they have 914 style splines
(well....close enough!) and the 6-bolt 911-style mounting method.
I am using 914-6 rear rotors and my 914-4 calipers required a
slight "trim" on the inside with a die grinder since the 914-6 rotors
are slightly larger in diameter than the 914-4 ones.

If all you want is to "fill the fenders", I believe a few weeks ago Stan
mentioned a company that makes wide 914-4 wheels.  This might
be the cheapest option.  If you want a decent brake upgrade, you
might consider what I did, or use the wide 914-4 wheels combined
with aftermarket Brembos or Bremteks, etc which are made for
the 914-4 strut to improve your brakes.  I have no idea what those
cost, but that is another option and would keep you from drilling
out your hubs.

Good luck!

Regarding chips and mass flow sensors, I'd like to post my original
question: Has anyone had a positive experience with an aftermarket chip
and/or mass flow sensor? After sending my Authority chip and sensor back to
the factory twice, I gave up and got my money back.

I made a dozen or so timed runs from 50 mph to 100 mph in third gear (same
road) and found my "before and after" times to be identical. Worse still,
the chip would occasionally cause the engine to run full rich and stall
out. After two or three of these episodes, I had the car towed back to the
shop and the original chip and sensor reinstalled.

Stan's comment regarding my experience was something to the effect that
there are no "magic bullets" out there. As much as I'd like to believe in
(chip) magic, I have to conclude that Stan's right.

        *Supposedly* this was what the factory did on 70-71 cars.  I have
heard that the early hubs have reinforced areas that can be drilled for
either the four- or the five-bolt pattern.  I have no experience with
this, though--and I agree, it doesn't sound too safe somehow.

Subject: 914 5 lug conversion

Just to add to the thread on 5 lug conversions.  I am in the middle
of doing the suspension/brake/wheel conversion for my 73 914-6
project. The reason for using a 911 strut and hub in the front is
I believe that the front hubs for 914s were not designed (ie
reinforced to be drilled for 5 lugs). The rears however were made
this way ( at least in 1970). Here's what I'm doing to my non-flared
car -
Front: Swapping to 1973 T front suspension - Rebuilt with all new parts
including new factory torsion bars, Bilstein shocks. Adding 19mm
adjustable sway bar.
Rear: Using proper 1970 drilled hubs and the stock 914 drive shafts
(my engine will be a 73 T motor w/ 150 ft-lbs), 911 vented rotors
and 911 "M" calipers with and adjustable "Tilton" style proportioning
valve.
Wheels - 6*16 911 Fuchs with 205/55 - 16 street tires, possibly
Comp TAs.
Brake pads - Ferodo AF
Misc: New OEM rubber brake lines, 19mm master cylinder
This should provide a nice balance package for my needs (one of 
which is to keep down costs).

Hi all -

I agree, but for model years 70-71 the factory did make hubs with 
"beefed" up areas for either a four or five bolt pattern as Dave Darling 
has suggested below.

I did this when we constructed our 914 race car and found some earlier 
hubs with the four/five bolt pattern and re-drilled them for five bolts. 
The hubs are getting hard to find and demand a premium when you do find 
them.  We have now used them for over five years and have yet to have a 
problem (knock on wood now that I have made this statement :-).).  We run 
wide race tires on the rear and the only problem with anything coming 
loose is the cv joints at the tranny.  Seems that no matter how tight you 
tighten the cv joints the gaskets continue to slip out with all the 
centrifical force.  Have recently gone without gaskets after "stoning" 
the surfaces of the cv joints and the problem seems to have gone away 
including the mess of leaking grease.  Without the gaskets seems 
definitely better.

My point here is that it is not any better than from the factory.  This is not

Your response is based on the chip living up to its claims.  My point here
is that you have increased your operating costs by 25% for an almost

They found it neccesary to satisfy a select few buyers by offering it as an
option at the expense of ride quality.  Different - not better.  Better would
be to keep ride quality the same and improve handling.

If it's chipped, you'll be replacing a head gasket guaranteed; and you'll also
experience premature wear of all drive train components such as, clutch, CV
joints, transaxel, main bearings etc., which were sized for a given design
life based on 247hp.
 
By the way I've driven a chipped 89 Turbo and man does 
that thing get the adrenaline going.  I understand why you guys
chip the Turbos.  There are tremendous performance gains that are
a hell of a lot of fun if you're willing to live with the reliability

Don't know your model 911 but on my SC the electric mirror left/right
select switch fits the hdlt. washer switch cutout and has the sustained
action (ie not momentary).  Go to your dealer parts counter and explain
what you're after.  Only problem is it's a power switch and as such not
suitable for logic level switching, but it should work OK for the fuel

	One says the carbs are not delivering enough fuel, hense the
backfire. (trying to have it smogged, high hc's, smog shop, says running

	If it matters, I am running a Bursch Turbo muffler.  Other
than the backfires the engine runs very strong, best from 3000 to ~4200.

Subject: Re: Ignition Kill etc..

Hi all,

	With all this talk of sophisticated kill systems and time delay cut
 -off switches, I'd just like to relate my little tale of inconvinience and
how it could be used as a kill switch.

	This last winter was the big engine refit for my 914 2.0. All new
fuel system, temp sensors, hoses etc... and one of those frustrating little
black double-spade connectors had broken internally and I didn't catch it.
This connector was for the head-temp sensor. So as a result, the car was
fine when cold, but as the engine heated up, the mixture stayed rich.
Making for really bad running at low RPM. The warmer the engine got, the
worse it would idle. And when the engine got to normal temp it -would-
stall unless the rpms were kept high. The engine would then be flooded at
that point and wouldn't re-start unless the fuel pump was turned off, the engine
restarted, run untill it starves, reconect the pump, start and go. I always
thought this would be quite a handy little device for anti car-jacking.
However, I'm not sure that a 914 really is high on the list of a car-jacker
. And I doubt this would work for a more modern car that uses O2 sensors
and the like. And naturally, carbed cars are different creature too. So,
for all of you out there with older bosch FI, this might be an interesting
alternative to time delay switches etc...

        For Porsche Club info, see the information you got in your Porsche-

the largest and most active regions in the PCA.

        The PCA folks will (probably) insist on you racing your Porsche.
That's OK, because it's a *really* fun autoX car.  Not the most competi-
tive car when stock, but lots of fun.  For your Scirocco, you can talk
to the SCCA (probably some info in that first big message you got).  There
are also other clubs around, but I'm not sure which ones operate in that
area.  Marque clubs (like BMWCCA, the Alfa club, the 510/Datsun club, etc)
are often willing to let "ousiders" run.  Check around at specialty repair
shops and/or racing shops in your area.
        Good luck--the 914 is a very rewarding car when driven properly,
and isn't as unforgiving as some when driven improperly.

Subject: Some (advanced?) Brake Caliper Questions

Hi All:

I just finished rebuilding yet another set of Ate brake calipers, and my
curiosity has led to a few questions - perhaps someone knows the answer.

1) What type of rubber are caliper O-ring seals (the ones between the
caliper halves) made of? Butyl? Buna-N?

2) If the rubber is special / not commonly available, does anyone know of a
good source?  The only place I've ever seen them made available is through
BMP design, a BMW parts house in Texas. And they're quite expensive.

3) Some Ate two-piston calipers (e.g. 911T non-vented) have a sort of guide
pin that goes into a hole (that is free to move laterally a bit) in the
piston. Others (e.g. BMW and Alfa rears, BMW 320i front (?)) do not have
this guide pin arrangement, and neither do the 4-piston (BMW 2002tii,
530i/528i) Ate units I've done.  Why is this arrangement used on some
calipers and not others? Is a guide pin required above a certain piston
diameter?

4) The pistons on calipers that don't use the guide pin arrangement
mentioned above often have their "bottom" (as in the bottom of a cup) as
far from the pad as possible (leaving a big hollow space that rusts between
the pad and the back wall of the piston), whereas those with the guide pin
arrangement have their "bottom" up close near the pad. This affects the
volume of fluid that's in each caliper cylinder -- those with no guide pin
contain much less fluid. Isn't less fluid behind the piston always better?

5) I've noticed that high-performance calipers (e.g. Brembo and Wilwood)
have "differential piston sizes for reduced pad taper." Am I right in
assuming that the smaller piston is the on at the leading edge of the pad
for the same reason(s) that one rotates Ate single-piston-caliper pistons
with their cutout at 20degrees?

I have HPBooks' Brake Handbook but it doesn't cover brake caliper design
very well.

Thanks for your input,

Subject: MOMO Steering Wheel Horn Buttons - Closure

I'd like to thank everyone for responding to my query about the current
availability of marque-specific horn buttons for MOMO steering wheels.

The Net Wisdom is that Porsche and BMW, in an ongoing effort to protect
their copyrighted material, sued MOMO and forced them to stop making said
buttons. 

This happened a couple of years ago, and in the meantime many people
(including me) have found existing or leftover buttons at a variety of
suppliers.  

I confirmed via telephone with MOMO in Miami that marque-specific buttons
are NLA.

The supply of these buttons is now dwindling or gone completely, so don't
throw away your MOMO horn button - it's probably worth something!

Again, thanks for responding.

Back in the misspent days of my youth when I work-on and drag-raced flathead
Fords, I wired up a '48 with five double-pole double-throw toggle switches as
a lark.  All the toggle switches had to be in the right position for the car
to start.  Of course there were no marks on the switches and they were
randomized as to position.  I would randomly changes the setting of three
switch when I left the car.  Its a hard problem to solve if you are in a hurry
(as a thief would be).  
The down side was ocassionly I forgot the right position, and had to
experiment a bit.  But it worked - I never used a key, and my '48 rag top was
never taken for a joy ride (favorite past time of some).

I followed with interest the 912/356 distributor debate and although much of

enquiry re: a 914. 

I am putting together an engine with 104mm Wiseco pistons, stroker Skat 
crank & Skat rods and massively reworked heads (total displ. 2.65 l). The 
engine is intended for autocross and some PCA track stuff but street driving 
as well.

My concern lies with distributor choice. I would like to use a distributor 
that has some vacuum advance to keep the car streetable (I think that I can 
gang together enough vacuum inputs from the manifolds to keep the pulsation 
effect to a dull roar), but not necessarily the stock unit with the FI 
points in it.

Has anybody had any experience with the 050 distributor in this sort of 
application (ie. can it still be run well on the street w/ centrifugal 
advance) or perhaps the MSD distributor made for Type I engines? Any 
comments would be appreciated. I also have an MSD 6 unit w/ the crankfire

        What I meant was that a stock 914 was no TToD threat.  Few stock

pretty much guaranteed TToD.  8)   One is a 3.2L six-cylinder monster, and
the others are 2.4L (?  2.7???) four-banger OUTRAGEOUS monsters!
        As to rules, PCA does not have one unified rule-set.  The closest
thing seems to be the PCRs, which almost everyone agrees is kinda screwed
up.  914s can be competitive in their classes, depending on the ruleset--
in the PCA Zone 7 rules, 2.0L 914s are in their own classes, so of course
they're competitive...  ;)

A friend of mine very nearly had his 911SC stolen last weekend.
The #$%@#& got in and stole a briefcase and a few other items

because of people around. This happened mid afternoon on a busy

Somehow the perp broke the lock to get in, although there is no
physical damage on the outside - the key turns from side to side
but doesn't do anything. I'll probably help him take the door
apart and check it out, but has anyone seen this before?

As a designer of whole EFI systems, a programmer of other people's systems,
and a consumer of high-end racing stuff, I've spent a *PILE* of time
thrashing this stuff out on the dyno.

* chips in and of themselves are not magic. They got the "awesome" rep
  from Motronic turbo cars where you can control the wastegate by
  software, which really lets you get a lot more power even though it
  may come a some expense (see also "951 head gasket, blown" and "heat
  of combustion")

* programmable EFI lets you adjust the fuel characteristics to the specifics
  of *YOUR* engine and operating environment. For instance, it's a lot
  easier to compensate for being at 5000 ft. above sea level or having
  to run on 102 octane instead of 110 or whatever.

* better programming -- these days -- very, very seldom makes more power.
  Where you make more power is in CHANGING OTHER STUFF and then changing
  the programming to match.

BTW, anyone want to buy a couple of cases of 64KB and 128KB EPROMs? No
car-related stuff on them, sorry....

This is correct. There are extra reinforced lands on the '70 hubs to
accommodate drilling for five-lug. Unfortunately, once you drill for
four-lug, you've already weakened the structure a bunch....

Drilling is not a good idea, except for "show only" cars. If you've going

  OFFICE MEMO         Auto A/C Leak & Repair                Date:  4/25/95

A recent thread on auto a/c indicated that there are
some P-philers out there who understand a lot more about
air conditioners that I do and I'm hoping that your
collective wisdom can help me out of a jam.

My '84 928S sprang a leak in the a/c recently and the Porsche
dealer (after an hour and a half of diagnostics) found 
a pinhole leak in an alloy pipe running from the compressor
hose to the firewall area.  My first thought was that it 
would be an easy fix ... well, they want a fairly hefty 
price when you add up labor, parts (pipe, gaskets, freon,
etc) and sales tax.  Being a cheapskate (squeezing the 
nickel until the buffalo farts), I've been thinking about
doing the pipe replacement myself.

Here are my questions.  First, the pipe is on the high 
pressure side of the compressor.  Can I either solder the
pinhole or have a shop weld it closed such that it will
hold up under pressure?  Would a radiator shop do that
kind of work or would I take the pipe to an a/c shop?  A
machine shop?   Do I need a pipe, or could I just
make a custom hose using the same type of a/c hose and 
fittings that are coming from the compressor?

Second, would it be worth risking buying a salvaged pipe
if I can find one?  How would I test it before installing?  How
many PSI should it be able to take?

Third, if I do the removal and replacement work myself, what
do I need to do to avoid damaging my system?  For example, 
I seem to recall a statement in one of the threads that if
the system is exposed to outside air, the drier (?) will be
contaminated/ruined.  When I take the pipe out, of course
the system will be exposed to the air, so should I just plug
the compressor hose and the expansion valve opening?  With
what should I plug them (a baggie wrapped around the hose 
and secured with electrical tape?)??

Fourth, have any of you had this type of problem?  The 
mechanic said he had never seen one of these pipes leak before.

Any and all suggestions would help me greatly as all I know
about a/c is where the button is to turn it on!  FWIW, I do
most of my own maintenance and am somewhat mechanically 
inclined.

TIA for all your help!

Hmmm, so the rule "you must have clean hands to come into equity" only
applies if the crime deterent methodologies cannot be construed as
neglegent? (gee, that sounded good! maybe I should go to law school! :-)
Thus, if a thief falls and breaks a leg inside your dark house, he cannot
sue because of the clean hands rule, but if you had a trap door that
caused the thief to fall and be hurt, then he could sue? It appears that
the burglary victim does not have the same rights as the burglar, but
in fact he/she does. The victim could certainly sue the burglar for a
variety of things, but the burglar probably doesn't have any assets.
The victim does have assets, so the burglar's suit has a good chance
of resulting in collecting an award. It just boils down to the old deep
pockets chase: the legal eagles go after those who have the assets
to pay damages.

Getting back to the p-car related content::

So, instead of a kill switch, how about a time delay tripping of the alarm;
the alarm horn sounds and the lights start flashing but the car doesn't
die (perhaps until the car comes to a stop)? In fact, my alarm system
(a Code alarm) remote control has a "panic" button that sets the alarm
off immediately. Someone recommended carrying the alarm remote
separately from your keys. If you had the remote in your pocket when
the carjacker forced you out of the car, you could set the alarm off as
he drove off. A delay might be in order if you didn't want to be too
close when the alarm goes off.

Are carjackings really all that common an occurance? Has anyone
on the list been carjacked? If so, what city and what kind of area did
it occur?

The cellular phone in my '87 Carrera keeps switching on and off erratically.
After testing the entire system, the installers concluded that I had a
problem with my battery: voltage reading was only 10-11 V with the car shut
off and 16 V when running. They explained that I had an "open cel" in the

doesn't provide enough "load" for the alternator. To me it sounded more like
a voltage regulator going bad and possibly the battery with it. The '84-'89

Terry asked about what a stipped 1991 911 might be worth missing most all the

Terry,

Given all the stuff your salvaged 1991 turbo is missing: perhaps a good way
to see how good a deal the left-overs are (i.e., body shell, engine and
tranny), would be to call a salvage dealer and give them a list of what you
need to make the car whole again.  Then add a whole bunch of hours for
reconnecting things such as wiring harnesses for the doors, "stuff from under
the dash", etc., at what ever price you value your time, add about 50% to
that for time you didn't anticpate, for things you didn't anticpate doing,
subtract all this from the *wholesale* price of the car, and you might get
close to what you should expect to pay for the car.

If you use the retail price of the car to subtract everything from, I think
you will only be kidding yourself about what the car will bring when your
buyer finds out the car was pieced back together from a bunch of other cars,
even if you do a creditable job of putting all the requred pieces back
together.

I hate to sound pessimistic, but in my view you should do somthing like this
in order not to sink in more $ than you could ever hope to get out.
 .....Just a suggestion, FWIW.

Stiffer torsion bars. Possibly stiffer sway bar. Possibly new bearings, or
A-arm bushings, or balljoints.

Or there is a very remote chance that you really have overexceeded the

Subject: Security: Anti-Carjack Protection


Hi Porschephiles,

With all the recent talk of Porsche security I couldn't resist being a 
electronics and security buff!

As for the "kill switches," they are a great idea but if the fuel cuts 
off while the thief is on the highway, your Porsche is liable to be 
totalled! Now, as it has been suggested if there was a way to rig the 
system so that it would only activate while the car was stopped, that 
would be great. However, there is an easier alternative...

Crimestopper Alarms offer a "Carjack feature" that once the door is 
opened for a pre-determined length of time while the engine is running it 
will go into Carjack mode. Two minutes after it is triggered, your alarm 
siren goes off and parking lights flash (at this point the thief should 
be a safe distance away). Eight seconds later the starter disable circuit 
engages which will prevent the thief from re-starting the car. Doesn't 
sound too impressive yet... here is where it can get interesting...        

You can add to this system a "Interior Pain Generator Siren" which is a 
125db (I think) siren. This way, when Carjack mode has been activated the 
thief will be treated to the sweet sounds of 125db going through the 
interior of the car.. needless to say, he (she) is sure to get the heck 
out of there. To make things more interesting you could possibly add more 
than one "Pain Generator" <bg>

This way you don't run the risk of your car getting injured in the incident
by having the gas cut-off. Nor do you run the risk of being sued by the 
thief. Unless, of course, for deafness <vbg>

Obviously the system is more complex than this, I've outlined the features 
for you. The "Carjack" Feature is currently available on the Crimestopper 
CS-9605Pi and CS-9206CR3 priced at $159 and $199 respectively. You can 
get more info by calling Crutchfield at 1-800-955-3000. They are a great 
source of Home and Auto audio equipment.

If you have any questions run it by them or Email and I'll try to answer 
you as best as I can.

'85 and '86 not likely Carjack targets!

 -Pre-law and still no Porsche! (still looking for a 944)


BTW, I have no link with Crimestopper or Crutchfield (satisfied customer) 
and have provided this information as a service to fellow Porschephiles

Hi

I have the bear tracker II and it works as adv. the warning sound only 
works when they use their radio. No talking then you won't know where 
they are. The thing works great for finding the airplane type speed 
traps. You can hear the pilot talking with the patrol cars miles away.

You can't totally rely on this as mentioned before. I have had crusiers 
on the back bumper and not a sound from the beartracker. Thats where 
the rear view mirrow comes in. Also watch the traffice around and in 
front of you if all of a sudden you find yourself in a pack there is 
usually a reason for it. IE patrol car leading or in the middle of the 
pack.

Don't know about any jammers they are avail.

There are hidden radar detectors and there are even some which are 
stealth as won't be picked up by a dectector detector.

In response to a message from Matt, which said:

...
>I have an '84 928S.  With the 16 valve engine, 234HP is definitely
>not enough.  What year is your 928 and have you made any mods
>to increase performance?
...

I posted a message to the list last week in response to some
inquiries about my engine, but I think there was a problem
with delivery to part of the list.  Part of the following is
that message.

My 928 started as a US '80 with 3 speed automatic.  The original
engine had a "melt down" (overheated in seconds, burst the
coolant tank, siezed a pulley on the front--it was ugly!).  I
replaced that engine with a professionally built racing engine
based upon an '82 Euro 928.  It retains the big valve heads and
the Euro block, but all other components were replaced with high
performance parts.  It was very well balanced, and should be
good for between 9,000 and 10,000 rpm (although wear would be
tremendous).  It has very radical, long duration cams, and
will not idle for more than about 10 seconds in drive (I shift
to neutral at stop lights).  It gets 9 mpg on the highway, and
7 mpg in city driving (tradeoffs).

I had the original transmission rebuilt to help it live
peacefully with the engine, but my mechanic says it probably
won't last.  The adjustment I was refering to is simply the shift
linkage tension adjustment on the side of the transmission.
Tighten the cable for higher shifts and longer duration in low
gears.  To get it to shift harder (less slip, to protect the
trans.), turn the set screw on the side of the transmission (I
don't remember which way).

I can't list all that was done to my engine, because I bought
it from a racer who had it made by a professional racing engine
builder.  However, the key points to emphasize are:

  Hone and polish the intake system (all of it, including a bigger
  throttle and less restrictive air flow meter).

  Use big valve heads (or make/modify your own, if none are
  available).

  Increase the compression ratio (different pistons or mill heads).

  Port/polish the heads.

  Use VERY radical long duration cams.

  Use racing headers with low restriction exhaust (Borla is good).

  Use a late model crank shaft (has bigger/better oil porting).

  Have the engine meticulously balanced (because the horse power
  will be at very high revs--I typically shift at 8500rpm, and
  it pulls harder at even higher).

  Replace the computer with one that can be "tuned."

  Have the car dyno tuned.

I am currently installing a supercharger to give moderate low
RPM boost to improve low RPM torque, and to compensate for high
altitude mountain driving (this should work without decreasing
the compression ratio because the long duration cams result in
low effective compression at low RPMs).  A new fuel computer is
in the works;  I designed it based upon a Microchip PIC 16C74
CPU.  600 HP is my goal.  I'll let everyone know how it goes.

Subject: EFI/Electromotive TEC

First, I would like to let people know that I am now employed at 
Electromotive, and can be reached there at 703-378-2444 or by e-mail. 

Last week Stan made the comment that the Electromotive TEC engine 
management system "*CAN NOT*" be used with anything but a common plenum 
intake. That is no longer true. At long last, the issue of running a TEC 
on an engine without a super stable manifold pressure signal has been 
addressed.

We now offer a new software package, Super*Blend, which provides a 
sixteen position map that allows the use of some or all of the throttle 
position sensor voltage to control fuel at low throttle openings. This 
signal is "blended" with the manifold pressure signal in zero to sixteen 
steps to provide the benefits of throttle/RPM mapping at low throttle 
openings and speed density (manifold pressure/temperature/RPM) tuning at 
higher load settings.

ECU with crank triggered twin-plug ignition system and calibration 
software (includes data logging and graphics package) is $2050. Single 
plug systems are much ($400) cheaper.

To offer some idea of the true capability of the TEC system, consider 
that it is the only aftermarket EFI system to pass California Air 
Resources Board testing for an aftermarket bolt-on kit. This was for a 
Jeep, admittedly, but one look at that 1940's era intake manifold should 
give you some idea of what we were up against.

I have worked with Electromotive products since 1988, when the TEC was 
introduced. I feel they offer the best value in aftermarket EFI's, and 
this new software is exactly what has been needed for years. I will also 
say that they have never been known for great information and product 
support, and that is a big part of what I hope to improve.

Call write or e-mail if you would like more information.

I kinda like the idea in Naked Gun 33 1/3 (if you don't know what I'm 
talking about, rent it, watch it)... VERY unnoticeable, VERY painful... 
oh, but if you do design a system, how about something like a keychain 
(that you don't put in the car, but simply carry on you, like a beeper, 
for instance) so that after being a safe distance, but still within 
viewing range of the car, you could kill it yourself? A safer idea, 
though requiring more engineering skills (and electroncs skills in todays 
world) would be a transmission disengager... Simply set the thing to, in 
say 3 minutes, go only in neutral (so as to not piss them off and break 
your park pins)... Or even better, sense when the car has come to a 
grinding halt, then let at it... They'd be sitting there revving the 
engine and not getting anywhere... of course, an officer will come over 
and "problem son?" and then you could reclaim your car...

Gary,

I had a 1985.5 (tear drop dash) that ran strong until I sold it with 
186,000 miles on the odometer.  I think it should go another 75k given 
the same care I gave it.

I bought the car with 50k miles on it in 1988 and sold it in 1995.  The 
key to it doing so well?  Maybe I just got a good one - but here is what 
I did to maintain it:
  - Used Mobil One since I bought it.
  - Changed oil/filter every 3k-4k miles.
  - Replaced timing belts every 15k miles.
  - Bought shop manuals, educated myself, and if something didn't seem
    right about the car - I fixed it - immediately.
Replacing the timing belts isn't cheap - but I think it added a lot 
to the life of my engine. Besides replacing clutch, brake pads, wiper 
blades, etc .- I fixed major items as needed.  In fact - I have a detailed 
list of what I replaced and when that I will post.  It may give some 
idea of what may be next to go on your car.  (The list is at work).

The only major engine problem I had was right when I bought the car.  The 
water pump went out and I didn't stop the car quick enough.  The head 
warped and required resurfacing.  Other than that, the other major 
component replacements were: oil cooler, timing belts & clutch.

Good luck with your car!

Hi all,

I wanted to thank Auto Atlanta in public for some help and money savings 
this week.

Our 914 with Bursch Muffler got very loud at the track, and when it was
home I discovered that a vertical bracket on the muffler (for stiffness)
between muffler parts one on top of the other had lost its weld and there
was a nice square 1 inch hole in the muffler. The hole had the vertical
piece sitting on top of it, but lots of air was seeping through.Given that
my usual muffler experience in life was that once you start to get holes
you change mufflers, I called A.A. for advice on getting a new muffler.

They told me that Bursch's last a long time. I told them that mine had 
this problem. They refused to sell me a new one: "Get it welded locally; 
if you cannot find someone to weld it for cheap, mail it to us, we'll do 
it free.Do not buy a new one" is what they said.

I had it welded at my local friendly auto place..$25. Guy there told me 
that the muffler itself was in fine shape. No air is now leaking. Car is 
as quiet (or more) than since we've owned it.

thanks Auto Atlanta! My next purchase is from you!

    The earlier statement that the car is going to still work for 2-3 minutes
  after the fuel pump is cutoff is silly; the car will die immediately if the
  fuel pump is cut off (okay, for fuel injected cars only...or any Porsche
  since '73...).  As far as any other liability issue when a thief
  takes your car....neither Juries nor Judges have a lot of patience with 
  thieves. But everyone has sympathy with a true victim.

     As far as getting sued if your car stalls and you impede traffic...I'd be
  in debtors prison if that was ever worthy of a suit...

     As far as kill switches that prevent the car from being started...someone
  a few months ago nixed the idea of wiring the fuel pump, etc, in favor of
  interrupting the wire to the solenoid. Sure, someone might push start the
  car if they were guessing well but the advantage is that you don't have
  sustained amounts of current to maintain. Also, it can't break down in the  
  middle of a corner or as you are driving; the worst that can happen is you
  can't start the car.

      I think imagining hidden switches that we'd somehow have the presence
  of mind to trigger when a gun is popped in our face is stretching the
  coolness of our nerve....if someone tries to hijack my car, my "plan" is to
  let them in, buckle them up, give them gas money and push the car off....

improvement, what manufacturer is the best, and what about
combinations of headers, cams and chips, has anyone tried that?

The std 944 has a very flat torque curve, to me it looks like it should be 
possible to rise mid/hi-end torque quite easily by changing the cam, and 
that would be better use of money than chip-only tuning.

The moderate 163hp from 2,5 ltr (Swedish specs) indicates a few 
sleeping stallions. In fact it's exactly the same hp/vol ratio as my Audi
80 GTE (U.S 4000 series) with 112hp K-jetronic engine, which is easily
tuned to 130-150 hp.

Subject: Swap Meet and 914 5-bolt conversions


1st Item:

For those of you in the San francisco area, Automotion is having their
annual Swap-Meet on Sunday, April 30. 

Event opens at about 6:30 am for those wishing to have a stall. Lots
of goodies and Automotion will have quite a few items on sale, both 
regular and close-outs.

This is the first Porsche-only swap-meet of the year.

2nd item:

Five bolt conversions are safe and reliable. The rear flanges are of 
very high quality steel, forged. Even the later flanges can be drilled
and are reliable. BUT, only have a machinst with the proper equipment
do the job. The 914/4 rotors can also be re-drilled and used, to save
other hassles.

The fronts. I recommend going to the 914/6-911 setup. The biggest reason
isn't brakes, as the 914 2.0 and 914/6 have the same size pads. The
biggest reason is the increase of static front track, over 1 inch. This 
improves turn-in and improves front-end geometry. The all-alloy front
brace and complete suspension off an '89 and earlier 911 bolts right in.

Subject: Re[2]: Antitheft Switches



Getting back to the p-car related content::

So, instead of a kill switch, how about a time delay tripping of the alarm; 
the alarm horn sounds and the lights start flashing but the car doesn't
    die (perhaps until the car comes to a stop)? In fact, my alarm system (a 
    Code alarm) remote control has a "panic" button that sets the alarm off 
    immediately. 
    
This is exactly what my alarm does, I have a Clifford 800 with Blackjax, the 
anti car jacking system is activated everytime you start the car and works as 
follows; 

1) Everytime you start the car, you have to enter a secret code using the "Plain
view" alarm switch.  Otherwise the alarm trips in about 30 secs and as soon as 
your car is going slower then 5 mph, the alarm kills the car.

2) If you open either door while the car is running, the alarm is resets and you
have enter your code again, otherwise the alarm trips as describe above.

Great system, since it's always on, you won't have to think about flicking any 
hidden switches while there's a gun pointed at your head....also, finding the 
code switch (hence plain view) won't do anything since they need your secret 
code.

Took me about a week to get used to entering the code when I start the car, 
twice I forgot and had the stero turned up loud so I didn't hear the warning 
beeps from the alarm and my car died, pretty embarassing in the middle of the 
street, now it's second nature.

Another cool thing with this system is that even if someone were to steal my car
keys with the alarm remote, they couldn't drive away with my car (at least not 
very far).

Subject: 89 951 Oil change story

Hi John,

Thanks for your response (on 4/5), sorry its taken me so long to get back to
you. Your were dead on with the water pump - 8 hours, and I did change the
belts. 

I just finished changing the oil (Mobil 1 Synthetic) on the car, and boy, did
I make a mess! After putting the car on jackstands, I saw that there is a
shield that covers almost the entire bottom of the car. I saw that I could
use a wrench, and take out the drain plug without removing the shield. Then I
realized that oil would pour onto the shield, and leak out without ending up
in my drain pan. I was going to remove the shield, when one of my friends
decided that he could make a little plastic piece that would make the oil
drain down, into the pan, instead of gushing over the cover. While he was maki
ng the guard (out of an orange juice bottle) I loosened the drain plug, and
then got out from under the car to get my filter wrench. When  I came back,
he was under the car, yelling for help. He had touched the drain plug, and it
fell out, and went some where. Oil is not pouring everywhere, and his
plactive guard is not working. Oil is going on top of the shield, gushing
onto my driveway, and making a very big mess. I go running into the garage
and grab as many pieces of cardboard that I can find. By this time almost all
of the oil is out of the car, and there is not too much else to do but watch
the oil run down my driveway. After removing the filter, finding and
installing the drain plug, adding the oil, and moving the car (being very
careful not to get oil onto the rear wheels, I get to spend the next hour
putting kitty litter on the oil spots, grinding it into the oil spots, and
then sweeping it up. The driveway still looks like sh*t. Does anyone know
what I can use to remove oil spots (slicks) from the driveway?

The moral of the story is to remove the shield next time (or have Jiffy Lube
do it) the next time I change the oil.

They have specialized cleaners for removing oil stains from concrete 
available at the local auto parts store.  Fine saw-dust left on the spot 
will absorb much of the stain, but I doubt it will do much more than the 
kitty-litter you used.  I have also used heavy DAWN dish soap with lots of 
scrubbing and high pressure water to lighten small spots.  It doesn't get it 
all, but a few passes should get most of it.  Good Luck.

This is somewhat less than a "remote" possibility.  My 914 has a largish,
rather ugly, hole torn in the left front inner fender where the sway bar
used to be mounted.  Apparently, some previous owner had installed a very
stiff sway bar and then took the car racing.  Our guess is that under severe
cornering stress or perhaps a hard bump, the sheet metal around the sway bar
just gave way.  It's tough to say actually happened and the PO is long since
lost to us.  Suffice it to say that cornering forces have to be absorbed
somewhere in the rolling chassis or the chassis will fail.  Which leads to
an interesting question.  What are the rules of thumb that suspension
designers use when considering modifications to an existing design?

You don't have to remove the entire shield.  The shield is two 
pieces and you only have to remove the rear piece.  This only 
takes 6 bolts.  Btw, the mechanic at our local dealership told
me to just leave off the back part of the shield.  I'd love to

Anyway, I don't pretend to have enough cool to flick a switch during a

the old fashioned parking lot thefts. ...  My original purpose was using a

That's way too high for that car.  Assuming the car is in excellent 
shape, I'd think $10-11K would be a more reasonable price.  Heck,
for $12.5K I'd seriously consider selling my '87 944 Turbo with

        So, does anyone want to buy a reeeealy expensive piece of
scrap metal?
        The flywheel endplay was a tad excessive.  In fact, it moved
enough that I thought there weren't any shims in.  Well, there were.
All three.  And it still had 0.065" of endplay (we *like* the dial
indicator!!!).  So Mr. Ellsworth (aka Mr. Machinist) popped off the
seal, took the shims out, and looked at the thrust bearing.  There
more or less wasn't one.  That is, there *was* one, but the shoulder
part of it was just about worn away.  He tells me (and I believe him)
that 1) it won't run for very long in this condition--as Stan says,
"see 'Welding, Friction'".  2) It requires taking the crankcase apart,
and 3) something has to be done with/to the bearing.
        Several questions arise :
        Does anyone make "oversize" bearings (Mr. Machinist's words)
so that we can get one that will fit?
        Does anyone have a 2.0L 914 motor (I have the "externals",
like induction, shrouding, etc.) that they'll loan me through Parade?
I still want to drive up to Portland and drive *IN* Portland.
        Does anyone know if Parade will give me my money back if my
car ist Ja Todt?
        Does anyone have a 2.0L long/short block for sale?
        Or, alternately, does anyone wanna buy a 914 collection and
then shoot me?     8P

        Well, I guess it's time for a loan from the Bank of Mom and

Subject: 944S Cam Chain Tensioner Failure:  Discussion

Hi,
   As some of you may know the Cam Chain Tensioner on my '87 944S failed. 
This is not a normal maintenance part, in fact it isn't even on Porsche's
checklist.  The cost of this failure is approximately $3000 (donations
welcome <grin>).  John Dwyer at Balcones European Motors (did I do good on
the credit there) is basically going to start checking the tensioner for
cracking every 30,000 miles (when he recommends that the timing belt be
changed).  To check it you have to basically pop open the valve cover...its
basically the part that is tensioning the chain that drives the two cams. 
His advice is basically check the plastic (yes plastic) part of it for
cracking.  What happens is that the plastic part breaks off...jams the
chain...strips the timing belt...bends lotsa valves.  The tensioner costs
$300 to replace...heck of a lot cheaper to replace than all the valves. 
Anyway, if anyone else has any experience with this (George @ 944 Ecology
says he's seen this happening more and more....so..)  drop me a note.  

Also, got kinda ticked at some sloppy repair work done by a previous shop. 
When they took the water pump off...there was one stud missing...someone had
broken off a hardened drill bit in there..and not bothered to get it out
(cost me damn near $150 to get it out).  John said if you are going to work
on the silly thing yourself (as I usually do), be extremely careful removing
the bolts/studs on the bottom half of the water pump since they get corroded
because any coolant that leaks ends up pooling @ the bottom bolts.  Obvious
little hint but it might save someone some $$$.  BTW this might not be
politically correct but the last shop that touched the water pump was DC
Racing in Irving, TX....the name on the invoice was Donnie....not saying it
was there fault....but......Guess I better get back to work and sell some

I was watching the international news the night before last and saw a motorcade

killer was the 93ish 911 cabriolet that followed the motorcade!  It was white
and had the top down and the spoiler up!  Along the top of the windsheild were
a bunch of blue strobe lights, with more on the back of the car.  It also had

My 71T (with Zeniths) tended to backfire when decelerating last year.
The fix did not involve the carbs.  It was ignition related and I
believe it to have been valve adjustment related.  The Zeniths were
rebuilt by the previous owner and were/are in good shape.

After a complete tune and valve adjustment my problem went away.

Incidently, FWIW, now that it's been awhile and I'm not so steamed
about it, my valves were WAY too tight on at least 3 cylinders.
The last place the valves had been touched was the first place I took
it after I bought it, namely HIGH PERFORMANCE HOUSE in Redwood City.

1 year later I took it to Tony Heyer who told me how seriously out
of adjustment it was and there was a strong possibility of burned valves.
(erratic compression, etc.)  Over the last year I had Tony do repeated
valve adjustments to allow carbon to burn off.  1 year later, the compression
has stablized and all is well.  Whew!!

I would have been significantly out of luck if the valves had
burned.  HP HOUSE told me at the time they worked on it that the valves
had been very loose.  I joked and said, "Better than too tight, eh?"
and forgot about it until the next year.

Needless to say I have not been back to HP HOUSE and had grown weary of
them for other reasons before this happened.

This is not a Public Service Announcement or specific FLAME against those
guys as I know a lot of people like them (especially the 914 community).
It's just an experience I had that has made me ever-so-cautious.  YMMV.

This is extremely vague territory. I decided to go the way I went after 
looking at 1) Stock rebuild 2) Stock rebuild w/euro p&c 3) big bore rebuild 
w/carbs 4) big bore rebuild w/programmable fuel injection.

Each version has it pros and cons, and only you know what you're willing to 
sacrifice (and you *will* sacrifice things) and what you want to gain.

I decided that I was willing to sacrifice money, gas mileage, durability and 
some streetability in exchange for power. That said, my engine has extra 
head studs, tons of oil cooling, dowels in the flywheel and the best parts I 
could find in an effort to have the thing stay together long enough for me 
to have some fun with it. I am also building a back-up 2.0 injected engine 
to have when the 2.7 blows up.

So, if you're still thinking about it, send me some more specifics (ie, what 
are you considering) and I tell you what I found out. I am doing most of the 
work myself, though, at this stage that consists mainly of exercising my 
credit card and driving parts to various machine shops.

As far as performance goes, you never really know till you do it, so I'll 
tell you when mine's done. I gather that you should get a respectable 160 hp 
or so from a reasonably well done 2.6. That, incidentally, puts you in the 
same weight/hp range as a 951. Intriuging, yes?

Talk to you later.

Subject: 914 Suspension bushings and other assorted questions...

Hi All,

	Well, now that I have -almost- fully replaced the suspension on my
914, the more subtle problems are making themselves more noticable. I'm
getting a very distinct -click- from my left rear quater during load
transitions. I have traced this to a toasted inner trailing arm bushing.
So, I have a question to all those who have attempted such a replacement.
Seeing as how the Haynes manual recomends replacing the entire trailing arm
, I plan on replacing only the bushings. What are the best ways to go about
extracting the old bushings and installing the poly bushings. I thought I'd
try soaking the bushings in something like gasoline for a day or so to
loosen up the rubber, and then use whatever tools I have at my disposal to
extract it. Installing the new ones are what I'm most curious about. Any
suggestions? I've been told that there's alot of shaving and shaping to get
them to fit right. Is it usefull to have the engine out of the way to do
the whole job? I plan on getting a new high volume oil pump at the
automotion swap meet this weekend along with a list of other oil system
related goodies to go with my new suspension bushings. And as long as the
engine is coming out at some point, I might as well do it all at the same
time. Heh! That's what I said last winter and the engine stayed on my
garage floor for a month and a half!

	Second question, I plan on buying a 2.0L in the future and
gradually rebuild it over the course of many months. Are there any special
tools that I need? And having never done a rebuild before, what kind of
parts list am I looking at for the bottom end (the heads'll be given to
someone else). And what can a competent shade tree mechanic accomplish, and
 -not- accomplish. I know this is vague. Assume this is for a stock motor.
Actually, it's for an SCCA CSP autoxer. So any goody ideas would be welcome
too, not that I can use them, but I'd like know what -could- be done if I
were building this for a different class.

Many Thanks,
	Josh

        I talked to a gentleman at the last (and first!) LPR autocross who
had at one point put a 2.4 in his car.  It didn't last very long (10k mi?
20k?) he told me because the case flexed (!) enough for the distributor
drive shaft to bind, which ate the distributor drive gears, which spewed
metal shavings into the case, which...  He thought that it probably would
have been OK if he'd had it "shuffle pinned".
        I have also heard that fans are a weak point in high-power high-
RPM engines.  If you're building one of these, you might talk to people
about somehow beefing up the way the fan (fan hub) is held onto the crank.
        Just things to think about when you build the high-$$$, high-dis-
placement, high-power engine.

Yet another possibility......

The hole that was cut for the radiator (bottom of front trunk) was cut
too big, or wrong.

I learned a long time ago that the Germans never put any *extra* metal
in their cars, so any modification that involves cutting or removing
chassis panels is a "bad idea".

They were still using them up to 1986.  I was tooling into Rotterdam and
getting lost in the cloverleaves.  There was a layby on the cloverleaf (!)
with 3 911 Targas.  I was the slowest at 140kmph (limit at 100), back 
then, nobody observed the limits.  The cops only ticketed you for dangeorus
driving (eg DUI, weaving etc).  And no, I never got ticketed.  My 1.3Audi 80 
wasn't capable of more than 170kmph.  

BTW, in Nederland, its not Autobahn but Autoweg.

'86 944T w/ 100k miles for $12.5k 
 
Too much-Most similar cars in typical condition (worn seats, incomplete
history, not all power accessories working, lots of stone chips, bent phone
dial wheels, scraped chin spoiler) sell for less than $10K at the dealer.
$12.5K could buy a low mile (under 20k), or an accident-free concours
winner, or a car with very, very desirable options or upgrades (sport
seats, ltd slip, magnesium wheels, sunroof and pwr window delete, etc.) A
friend was offered $6.5k and $8.5k from dealers for his like-new 62k mile
'86 944T. It is stock, has a history since 20k miles, new clutch, water
pump, motor mounts, all 16 water hoses, belts and a rebuilt tranny in the
last 6 months. The tranny was done due to a slow 1-2 synchro. The rest was
preventative maintenance based on turning 60k miles or having the tranny
out.. All work done at the dealer or at Porsche-only independants. Phone
dials and tires are perfect. No dings. Manifold doesn't leak. Air filter
and cassette box aren't cracked. Sunroof works. Engine strong. Drivers seat
looks like it has 5k miles of wear. Garaged and covered. On the downside,
it has no sport options and a trained eye can spot minor bodywork (new
paint, but the panel wasn't replaced). The nose has been sprayed twice for
stone chips. Never broken down, never towed. Muffler not scratched or
rusted. Fog lights not cracked. He accepted the $8.5k. Figured he might get
$10k from a private buyer, but didn't want the hassle. 
 
Hot 928's-Anyone remember the RST ads in Excellence which promised a 1000hp
928. I think that they sold a video. Always wondered if the car existed.
Any Porschephiles buy it? It looks like the one in the new ad for 928

The fans on my '86 944 wouldn't turn off yesterday so I checked the

stuck closed even when cool, indicating the switch is faulty.
 
The switch installed has stamped on, 92 deg (terminal 1) & 102 deg (term. 2)
The switch I picked up from my parts guy says, 85 deg (term 1), 93 deg (t 2)

Which one should I be using? The parts guy says that the 92/102 deg one is 
for the Turbo. My '86 944 is not a Turbo, so should I be using the cooler 
one instead? The dealer (as always) is ignorant and seems only to carry 
the 92/102 version.
 
I'd prefer the cooler one, but I don't want to mess with the wrong one if 
that's not what the Porsche engineers had intended.

During the 30,000 mile service at Paramount Motors, Hickory, NC in November a
"crankshaft seal leak' was found.  Paramount performed the $700 repair of the

extended warranty by Quaker.....but the oil smell remained.   

During the last service, 4 months and 1200 miles later, Hendricks Porsche,
Charlotte, NC states the crankshaft seal is still leaking PLUS two cylinder
seals.    Gasket and seals  are covered by  Quaker.  They are balking at the
estimated $7,800 repair cost..(Not a surprise).   The proposed solution is to
remove the manifold, send to Porsche, (Nevada)  to be retooled, crosshatched
for better sealing, install new pistons etc.

The cranshaft seal is dripping, the cylinders are just "weeping" and weeping
is not covered per Quaker, and if it were, the cost of the upgraded parts
would not be covered, only the original parts (which are not available from
Porsche since they have been upgraded.)

Power (+12 volts) is on the light switch at all times on one side of the
bulb.  The other end picks up a ground (earth) to turn the light on.  In one
position it never picks up ground (off all the time), in the second it picks
up a ground from the door switch when the door is open, and in the third , it
picks up a ground from the frame of the switch (on all the time).  Most
likely if the light doesn't come on when the door is opened, the fault lies
with the switch in the door jamb having some corrosion on the contacts.  I
believe the switch unscrews and can be easily removed to clean the contacts.

Hope this helps. (How are you Dave? Are you the same Dave from last
September's 911 engine rebuild class at Jerry Wood's shop?)

Peter,

Since your 924 has the early steel front a-arms one thing you might  
check is the condition of the bushing.  I had the rear rubber
bushing on the right side fail due to heat problems caused by it's  
proximity to the exhaust system.  Mine actually detached from the
a-arm and was gone by the time I noticed it (it didn't take long :-)  
).  These need to be pressed on so they should be replaced by a
mechanic.

Also, you should check for the following:  a-arm ball-joint play,
wheel balance and trueness and front wheel bearing play.  A quick
check would be to jack up both sides of the front of your car and
try to shake the wheel in all directions, then spin the wheel to see  
if it is dented.

Veel geluk toegewenst met uw porsche en met de snelheidslimiet in
holland.  ok tot ziens.

Tom

If the engine is stock and carb jetting is stock, try the original muffler
and you will probably eliminate the backfire.  The Bursch may be scavenging
the exhaust before it can all be burned.  The engine needs the backpressure
the stock muffler provides.  Also, if you have a flat spot in the
acceleration, that may be cured as well.  This worked for me years ago with a
67 911s that had the same symptoms.

Good luck

The one experience I had with the failure of a fan switch was not
gradual.  One day it worked, the next day it closed forever, draining
my battery.

I think (or very much hope) that the dash gauge indicates cylinder
head water temperature.  Since the fan switch is mounted in the
radiator, it is measuring the coolant temperature there.  It is
therefore easy to imagine scenarios in which the gauge readings and
fan operation might not be well correlated.  I would check the
thermostat (the one in the water pump, not the *switch* that runs the
fans) and bleed the system well before buying any new parts.

Subject: question on lug nuts

I'm having the Fuchs wheels on my 911SC refinished to the
stock black center paint scheme.  The original owner had
them polished out, but the look is just too pimped out
for my tastes.  I need to replace the wheel nuts with black
ones to complete the job.  My mechanic recommends sticking
with the factory nuts at $5.80 a pop.  I called Robert
Woods in LA (the folks with the showy full page ads about
wheels in Pano and Excellence).  They recommend an aftermarket
wheel nut that they sell for $3.50, claiming that it is better
finished than the factory nuts and fits just as well.

My mechanic showed me some used sample wheel nuts that he
had lying around and it was quite clear from inspecting them
that the particular aftermarket samples he had did not fit
as well as the factory ones.  You could clearly see from the
pattern of wear in the anodization that the aftermarket nuts
were making contact with the wheel in only a narrow band.
The used factory samples showed wear in a much wider area
all over the rounded end of the nut.  Given the comments
in the article in Pano this month about wheels, this argues
strongly in favor of sticking with the factory stuff.

But the question is whether all aftermarket wheel nuts
are necessarily ill fitting.  One would think that reproducing
the exact shape of the factory nut should be a relatively
straightforward engineering question.

So I guess it comes down to a question of whether I am
to trust the word of Robert Woods, Inc that there wheel
nuts are high quality and fit as well as the OEM versions.

Have any of you had experience with Robert Woods in general
or their aftermarket wheel nuts in particular and care to
share your comments?

Please reply directly to me rather than the list as a whole.
If anyone else is interested in the answer, drop me a line and
I'll send you the digest of the responses I get.

Subject: Re: 914 with worn thrust bearing

Re: Worn Thrust Bearing in 914
    Yes, you WILL have to take the engine apart! The usual reason for a badly
worn thrust surface on the #1 Flywheel Main Bearing is a worn case, causing
 the bearing to lose its "crush".  Like virginity, once lost, the crush will
not return unless you Align Bore the case. If you're very lucky and have led
a good life, only the bearing  will be damaged. If you have sinned too much,
the thrust surface of the CASE will be worn too, in which situation you have
a more serious problem. Then, you must find a 914 Flywheel Main Bearing with
an "oversize" thrust, cut the case to clean it, and cut the oversize thrust
bearing to fit. OR you can custom-machine a piece of aluminum to fit the case
to take up the slop so that a new bearing (without an oversize thrust) will
work.
     We';ve done both of these fixes. The better  solution is the oversize
thrust Main Bearing, if available.
    You'd better check the other bearing webs of the case to see if the
 unrestrained crank had hit them too! (Though usually an align bore takes
care of those problems  too.) In a 356/912 when this happens, the "tangs" of
the Middle Main Bearings of the S-90/356C/SC/912 55mm crank will break out
part of the case.

Good Luck.

Attempting to become my own car expert, I'm reading Probst's
book on Bosch fuel injection systems.  I was surprised to learn that
my former 1985 Tempo with Ford's EEC-IV was more sophisticated than 
my 1984 928S (L-Jetronic).

The book asserts that as an advantage over carbeurators, fuel 
injection allows the use of tuned intake runners.  I don't understand 
why they can't be used on carbeurated engines.  Any thoughts?

Also, just how are tuned intake and exhaust manifolds designed?  I
understand that the operation of the pistons and valves creates
pressure waves, but what is the design goal when engineering manifolds?

Since I have an 87 944S, and I don't want to spend $3000, I am quite
interested in this. Is the message to inspect the plastic part of the
"between the cams" tensioner regularly (how regularly? is that what he
recommends every 30K miles?), or to simply replace the whole tensioner
regularly? If I want to go in and browse, do I need to use a new cam cover
gasket each time (I assume)?  What does that mean it costs for each look?
I'm a bit concerned that looking every 30,000 miles might be too infrequent
to catch a developing crack before it breaks off. BTW, will the crack that
represents impending doom be obvious, or where do I look? Depending on how
complicated the plastic part is, it might be interesting to see if making
a metal replacement is possible. Has Porsche fixed this on the 968 series,
with a part which might be backward retrofittable?

Hi Jay,

Nice to hear from follow 924 drivers.

Ths brake swaps really is not too hard.  I did it myself part time  
in just a few days.  The parts are available from most of the auto  
dismantlers for about $500-$750.  But then you need to buy 5 bolt  
wheels.  The nice thing is that any 6 inch wide early 911 wheel will  
fit.  I used 6 & 7 x 16s's from a '85 Carrera and only had to make  
minor mods. in the rear. I'm at work now so I don't have my notes  
with me, but if your really interested I can give you all the part  
numbers you will need.  You should replace your master and booster  
to be complete.

As for other mods. I've put on MSDS tubular headers, a euro.  
primary muffler (though I still use the factory secondary), 210 lbs.  
springs in front, 25mm torsion bars in back, sport Koni's all  
around, 22mm/19mm sway bars, 6 point harness, harness bar and  
Performance Friction pads.

I've not put in a roll bar so I'm not Club Racing (yet) but I do

Subject: 951 hard to shift when warm

Looking for list experience on this one,

the car; 1986 951 with about 84k mi clutch update at about 45k.

The simptoms;  Trans wont go into first and hard to get in the other
gears.  This first happened yesterday and when I got the car home I
jacked it up and checked the travel of the slave cylinder.  As near as I
could tell it had about .59" travel (I couldn't measure accuratly so it
may be off a bit).  This morning with the car cold I can shift with no
problem into any gear.  After about 3 mi (with a 10 min stop at daycare
engine off) I get gas and the simptom reappears.  After my 55mi commute
its clearly there lots of resistance to first gear (I never forced it
in) and significant bur managable resistance to second gear.

No sighns of external leakage anywhere (master cylinder or slave
cylinder) no signs of any leakage at the transmission, and after 55 mi
of highway driving the trans case is not hot.  Original slave and master
cylinders.

My guess is internal leakage in the slave cylinder when warm.  Anybody
confirm or deny this?  All help greatly appreciated.

TIA

Once you've done something to incrase the airflow, you *may* need to
do something to incrase the gasflow. Of course, you'll need some
chassis dyno time to see how this looks under load *FIRST*. Then
once you start making mods, you'll need more chassis dyno time...

There are two simple tricks: 1) larger injectors/higher base fuel
pressure, 2) rising rate regulator.

Larger injectors have an obvious advantage: they're larger, so flow more
gas. There may be special application injectors (I'd guess off-hand
the 931s, maybe the 924 Euro version, certainly the factory racing 
version) that you can use, or you can get them "adjusted" by Kinsler
or Marren Motorsport. Higher base fuel pressure accomplishes the same
thing without changing hardware. These modifications, while increasing
richness when you want it, also run richer *ALL* the time, which is
a huge problem on the street. 

Rising rate regulators are simply put the most effective modification 
you can make to L-jet or CIS motors to get more gas in cheapest. They
change the fuel presssure when you "get on it", which increases gas
flow through the injector. This also makes a better spray pattern
which may also improve combustion. I don't have the manufacturer info
of the top of my head for where you can get these, but they've been
discussed at length many times. See the archives.

Finally, you can use a secondary injection system, with a simgle pulsed
injector blowing gas into the main intake plenum under control of a
secondary controller that's looking at things like RPM, manifold pressure,
etc. This is also a fine solution but takes a bit of fabrication to make
it work.

Anyway, at some point you get into the problem of how stock does
it have to LOOK Like it is, but that's another set of engineering....

It's not that it can't be done (look at any early Ferrari, or the
higher performance versions of the 356 family, or early 911s), it's
that it can't be done *CHEAPLY*. Mass production requirements mean that
things have to be simple and cheap. One carb on a big cast iron manifold
is both. One EFI control setup on a nice tuned aluminium intake is not
much more complex, and "cheap" is relative when you consider the impact
of EPA and CAFE requirements. However, multithroat carbs with tuned 
air horns are *NOT* cheap under any possible interpretation.

Colin Campbell, "The Scientific Design of Intake and Exhaust Systems"

Sean,

The PCA Club Racing stickers are available from Ruth Harte at the PCA
National office.  She can be reached at 703-922-9300 .  I believe they are
$1.00 apiece and come with either black or white lettering.

to warn the list.  "87" 944S brake warning light was coming on to
warn of low fluid 
level.  Addition of fluid turned t he light off but only to light again in 
a couple of days.  No signs of leakage, but the clutch pedal height was 
erratic. 

The master cylinder was leaking inside the car and ruined the carpeting

Sounds like your clutch disk migh be coming apart.  Eventually, it will fail

Jim,

Why should Quaker be responsible for this problem? Was the oil tested by
Porsche to determine if it did not meet specification? Please repost the
history of this problem so that we can all understand what the oil did
to cause these engine problems. I know I do not want this to happen to
my car so I would like to know what to lookout for when chossing oil.

Yes this is a problem. I also have a freind who owns an 88 944 turbo who 
experirenced the same "messy carpet syndrom".  The odd twist to the story was 
that he was able to repair the clutch cylinder from inside the car.  There was 
litteraly no room to get at it from the engine bay without extensive

Help philers!

I went to pick up my 944 from storage Saturday. Pushed in the clutch and it
went to the floor.  Master cylinder or slave cylinder right. Called our local
Motorstadt guru who is probably reading this suggested slave cylinder and had
an old one that might work, Rebuilt it(kit $36) put it in, bled it( pumped pedal
at least 15 times) still no pressure. Lots of air came out, but very little
fluid. Am I missing something or do I need a master cylinder? This thing is
awful to get out and the car is 43 miles from my house and even more from my
mechanic. A minimum of $125 flatbed costs. I would at least like to get it
home. The old slave cylinder looks and feels ok, but the fluid was very black.
Mechanic thinks it still has air. Sitting my help release some of that air or
it may need to be pressure bled.

I've had pretty fair success using Gunk engine cleaner to clean
driveway oil spills.  My theory is that the stuff is made to
dissolve oil and grease on engines, so why not on driveways?

They actually make driveway cleaner version.  Comes in a
non-aerosol can.  

Spray or pour it on.  Scrub with a brush.  Let stand for
5 minutes. Hose off.  Repeat about 50 times, or until
you can live with what's left.  (It'll still look bad,
but not like sh*t.)

Then wait a year for rain and sun to finish the job.  Since
rain is the controlling element, here in Seattle you only have
to wait 6 months.

P.S. Great story.  All of us have more than one just like it.  My last was removing the front cover from a 911 engine

Subject:      Double Vac Distributor

Fellow P-car aficionados, I am looking for some general information.
Last evening, I was looking at the vacuum hoses on my 1972 914-4 1.7 and
was surprised to discover that one of the vacuum ports on my distributor
was connected to the back of the air intake at the same location as the
oil breather hose.  The other vacuum port was attached to the front of the
air intake near the throttle body.  There is a second vacuum port on the
side of the air intake at the throttle body that had a hose attached
running to the distributor but not connected at the distributor.

The car ran fairly well with this configuration but I had a problem with
the idle.  Sometimes too high, 1200-1400 rpm, frequently 800-900rpm, and
when the car is at normal operating temperature, 250-300rpm.  The 250-300
rpm occurred when at normal operating temperature and driving in city
traffic.  That is, when going from traffic light to traffic light, the
rpm would drop very low or when starting the car when the engine is hot.

Questions:  1.  What effect would the vacuum conections to the distrubutor
  have with one to the throttle body intake per the manual and the other to
  the air intake with the oil breather hose?
            2.  Would the vacuum hoses so connected affect the rpm as in
  very low idle rpm at normal operating temperature?
            3.  What is the normal rpm when the engine is cold?
Many thanks.

        After careful consideration, and attempting to use this
particular item, I would have to recommend against it.
        The problem was that the shank was not large enough to
allow me to pull the flywheel all the way out.  With the adjust-
ment screw on the "business" end backed all the way out, my fly-
wheel would hit the tool when I pulled on it.  The tool also
measured on the teeth of the flywheel, which does not sound like
the best way to go to me--since the teeth can be machined and
(if I remember the bit from the manual) are supposed to be
slightly beveled.
        Live and learn.

I have had 2 924's - a 1982 and 1987S- both developed the same vibration.
And, I thin 944s do also?. The 1987 car did not develop it until about
50,000 miles. I also had wheels balanced and alined with new tires. Seems
like something inherent in the car after some milage. So, I gave up and
learn to live with it. Anybody else have an answer?? Let me know

I recently had the following symptoms in a 1986 928:

******** BEGIN IMPORTANT PART *********
 - water accumulation on floors (front and back) of left (driver's) side
  of car.  NOTE: In the front, the water was not as noticeable,
  because the foam padding beneath the carpet has an impermeable
  rubber backing that prevents any water below it from wetting the
  carpet.
******** END IMPORTANT PART *********

 - moisture on floor of passenger side and in rear compartment.  This
  may have been a result of condensation of water already in the car.

 - condensation on INSIDE of windows.  This is what really tipped
  me off to the leak.

 - water in the vent duct (yes, really!) of the driver's side door.


Finding the problem:

 - Using a garden hose with low water pressure, and parking the
  car at different slopes, I proceeded to find the leak.
  I first started low on the car, eliminating leaks from those places
  first.

 - With the car parked front-end lower than back, water flowing onto
  the CLOSED sunroof leaked to the floor via the left windshield
  pillar.  I saw the leak by opening the driver's side door and
  observing water drops from the juncture of the pillar molding and
  the dash pad.

******** BEGIN IMPORTANT PART *********
 - Repeating the test with the sunroof opened revealed that the left
  front sunroof drain hose was clogged.
******** END IMPORTANT PART *********


Fixing the problem:

 - Blowing compressed air through the hose did not free the blockage.

 - Stuffing various wires down the hose could not dislodge whatever
  was blocking it.

******** BEGIN IMPORTANT PART *********
 - Removing the left front wheel and plastic inner wheel well allowed me
  to see the hose where it came down from the inside of the windshield
  pillar.  The hose is white, about three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
  I followed it with my hand and found that the end was pinched against
  the inner fender by the vacuum (weird-looking) canister for the cruise
  control.
******** END IMPORTANT PART *********

 - I loosened the bolt holding the canister to the inner fender, freeing
  the drain hose.

 - As the hose is hard plastic, I could not reshape the pinched end, so
  I cut off about 1.5 inches.  I tested the hose for proper operation,
  then tightened the canister bolt, making sure that the drain hose was
  not pinched.


Final thoughts/Lessons learned:

 - This problem could have been caused by a careless mechanic, but I'll
  bet it existed since the car's date of production.

 - Given that the car was delivered some eight years before with this
  problem, it's amazing that this was not corrected earlier.

 - Although the gasket around the sunroof appears to fit snuggly, I
  realize now that it is not intended to prevent ALL water from
  leaking through. (Anyone disagree?) Some water WILL leak through, and
  should then be drained by the drain hoses at each corner of the
  sunroof opening.

 - In hindsight, the water path can be traced from the front left area
  of the sunroof opening, overflowing into the interior, flowing
  behind the windshield pillar molding, continuing to both the floor
  and the vent duct of the door.  From the floor at the driver's feet,
  the water flowed to the floor of the passenger behind the driver.
  Once inside the car, the water evaporated and condensed on other
  interior parts throughout the car.

 - Drying the wet interior was a problem in itself.  I just aired
  everything out for several weeks.  Anybody have experience with
  using desiccants for this?

Subject:       85.5 928s

Hi all,

Well I had my first drive of a 928s yesterday. It was a 1985.5 928s with 
32 valves. 84K original miles, gun metal grey, no accidents, black 
leather interior, automatic transmisson.  Asking price was $14,500, but 
owner was willing to come down to $13,000.  Car seemed to run very well, 
I had it running at 60mph and it was tight and rock solid.  It seemed 
very torquey.  

The guy bought it two years ago and has only put 2k on it since he 
bought it.  Apparently he is buying a summer house in florida and needs 
the cash.  He also has an audi and mustang.  

The paint is original and there seems to be no rust or accident repairs.  
There are some some small areas where the clear coat is peeling though.

Here is what the guy said had been done on the car before he got it, but 
he has none of those receipts:

New belts and brake pads.

He has since had the tie rods replaced and has had the front end 
aligned, new battery.  There are receipts for these.  

Everything seems to work. I have an appointment with a local mechanic on 
Monday.  What specific things should I ask the mechaninc to check out 
apart from the obvious compression check, rust, collision damage, oil 
leaks etc.  The FAQ has lots of info on the 944 and 911, none on the 
928.

I was really impressed by this car.  It looks good, drives well, has a 
nice deep rumble from the exhaust and has lotsa power.  Also there is a 
PCA sticker on the side window.  What does this mean?

Many of you have reservations on the reliability of the 
electrical/electronic systems.  What can I expect to go wrong in the 
future both electrical and engine wise?

My 87 944 did not have the rear shield when I bought it.  Apparently 
a previous mechanic agreed with your dealership.

I don't think it would be a real problem to leave it off, as it
only covers the oil pan area.  The front shield, however, appears to

I beg your pardon!  Did I say "street" engine?  I think not.
Check again.  I think I said "professionally built racing
engine"... with a supercharger added to that.

I suppose you would deny that a turbo charged 3.6 liter 6
cylinder could reach 800 hp (DP 911's have surpassed that!).
What is so unbelievable about a supercharged V8 reaching 600 hp?
I know a guy who has a supercharged Oldsmobile that tops 1000 hp.
I watched his car do a wheely in the parking lot of a local

Try elevating the rear of the car.  The problem is the position of the feed
line to the master cylinder.  It is at the front and top of the brake fluid 
resevoir and is easily uncovered to allow more air in the system.  If it is not
convenient to raise the rear of the car, try running some clear plastic 
tubing from the slave cylinder bleed petcock back up into the brake fluid
resevoir to make a loop and maintain a contstant fluid level.  I've done the
latter and it worked well.

Subject: 951 hard to shift when warm

I had a similar problem with my '88 951 last summer.
Occasionally at stop lights the car would not
go into 1st gear. The only way I could get it to 
move was to put it in 3rd or 5th, let the clutch out
slightly with a bit of gas to get the car
to move, then put it in 1st.

My mechanic diagnosed it as a bad clutch
slave cylinder and hydraulic hose.  He
replaced them and since then I haven't
had the problem.  (Hopefully it won't
recur). 

At least check the clutch hydraulics
(especially the hose) before ripping
into the clutch.  I'm assuming you
know how big of a job the clutch is.

        The two vaccuum lines are for the vaccuum advance and retard (for
the timing).  One of the ports expects to see pre-throttle vaccuum, the
other expects post-throttle vaccuum.  I am not sure that it matters a
*whole* lot which pre-throttle vacc you get, but I could be wrong.
        The proper setup for these lines (if the 72 1.7 follows the 74
2.0, which it sounds like it does) is for the two vacc lines coming from
the throttle body to go to the two ports on the distributor.  If you get
them on there swapped, you'll probably know when you try to drive it  ;)
The small line from the 'T' (actally kind of an 'L' + on mine) goes to the
deceleration valve which is down by the manifold pressure sensor below and
behind the battery on the RHS of the engine compartment.
        Vaccuum leaks can cause odd things to happen to your idle--but the
"typical" symptom for D-jet cars is a high idle.  Warm idle should be
somewhere around 1000 RPM (800-1000), with cold idle higher due to the aux
air regulator.
        If your car idles too low when warm (250 RPM?  Does it stall?) it
could be anything from just not being adjusted correctly (the idle screw
is on the throttle body) to a more serious problem, like funky old injec-
tors, to fuel starvation due to vapor-lock (or near-lock).  Also check the
head-temp sensor resistance.  It should vary from about 3 Kohms cold to
about 0-50 ohms hot.  ("Hot" being about 210 F or 100 C.)  The head temp
sensor is on the RHS in between the spark plugs in the head.
        Good luck!

I don't think that the aluminum block engine will have a problem, but I've
noticed that the air intake points down inside the drivers side front
fender.  It sits rather low and would probably suck up a ton of water
if water should get up that high.

      Part of the distinction is between "wet" and "dry" manifolds.
You can get away with more on a fuel-injected (port injected, not
throttle body injected) motor since you don't care about the dynamics
of how the fuel goes thru the runner. Tuned-port runners can bend and
twist, an air-fuel mixture cannot; given a bend, the air will turn
left and the fuel go straight, ending up sticking on the wall. This causes
"sheeting" effects where blobs of fuel come off, not exactly an even,
 atomized mixture.

      Port fuel injection (like CIS) just squirts over the top of the hot
 intake valve, neatly creating a cloud that gets sucked in but doesn't have 
 to travel down an intake. That let designers "tune"  for the air only and
 don't have the same tradeoffs a carbureted manifold has...(i.e., conceivably
 you could stick a Holley 2bbl in place of the throttle body on a 911 CIS 
 intake, but it would run -baaaaddddlllyy-...kinda like those 914 Weber 
 conversions...)

      Probst also wrote a book for Ford fuel injections (same publisher)
  that is very good.  Pretty fascinating stuff...

Almost this exact same question was asked on the BMW list yesterday, my reply
was based on info gleened from various articles, but I will surely get the
book suggested by Stan. My original reply follows:

First a little primer: 
An engine is basically an air pump. The more air through it, the more power.
Air has mass. Air (like anything else) when in motion tends to stay in motion.
 

OK...When an intake valve opens it is true that the downstroke of the piston
draws the air into the cylinder, also, once the air begins moving into the
cylinder the air still in the intake runner pushes even more air into the
cylinder, because of the air's mass etc. This creates a kind of supercharging
effect and increases the efficiency of an engine. The ZR-1 Corvette and many
other highly efficient autos actually change the length of the intake runners
to maximize this effect.
Well, the opposite occurs at the exhaust.  The air traveling down the exhaust
actually has a suction effect on the cylinder and creates a kind of vacuum in
the cylinder.  This is the kind of technology referred to when a manufacturer
calls something "tuned intake runners" or "tuned exhaust". Thus there is a
fine line between too much restriction and not enough of this sucking effect.

Of course timing plays a large part in this discussion, which is why we have
VANOS and VTEC and VARIOCAM and all the other "V" stuff. It also explains why
what works good at one rpm is not so good at another. (i.e. a muffler)

You have to have it on the turbos since the nose under-piece (what's

I bought my car in Iowa two summers ago during all the flooding.
The shop that did my prepurchase for me had just finished work
on a 951 that had run through several inches of water and sucked
it into the engine.  They warned me not to drive through more
than 3-4 inches of water.  Apparently water in the combustion

It's a push-pull vaccuum advance. One uses the manifold pressure difference
to artificially retard the advance by 5 degrees, the other is used to 
automaticly advance the timing by 5 degrees under accelleration. That, plus
the static advance and mechanical advance, means that yoy can have both
a decent idle and good acceleration. If everything is working right, you 
should show 27 degrees advance at the crank at 3500 RPM.

Yes. See above. It probably means the one that is holding back the advance
is broken.

By the book, it's 800-900 RPM.

From this posting, it appears the Porsche hardware people design in
performance only to have the Porsche firmware developers consistently
write code that utilizes the hardware suboptimally.

I'd guess this would cause some hard feelings at the Porsche factory, since
the engine hardware people design the engine to be high performance, only to 
have the Porsche firmware developers squander some of the performance with poor
firmware.

This could lead to some "heated discussions" in the factory parking lot.

Furthermore, to judge from some magazine "Chip" advertisements, suboptimal 
ECU code is present in cars from different manufacturers.   

After all, with improved firmware, the factories might meet the same 
performance goals at a lower cost.  Possibly a less expensive intake 
manifold could be substituted, possibly the exhaust system could be made 
less expensive.  Maybe a less expensive head assembly could be substituted.  
Possibly the cam lobe grind tolerances could be relaxed to make the cams less
costly to make.  The car could even tolerate more weight if it would 
lower costs.

So suboptimal ECU firmware could be costing Porsche and other manufacturers
real MONEY, year after year.

And Porsche has been struggling to lower costs/increase profits.

One might think the factory would difference the aftermarket EPROM vs the 
factory EPROM to determine where the factory firmware developers overlooked
something, and then incorporate the differences. 

Maybe the Porsche factory does do this, but is always one step behind, even 
though they have a large R&D facility, a large R&D expenditure and considerable
performance tuning experience from racing.

I know I can't explain this surprising phenomenon.

Hi all-

I am currently restoring a 73 911, and the front aluminum calipers have some 
dark spots showing through the coating.  What is this coating?  Were these 
calipers anodized (or cadmium plated)?  The coating has a light golden 
appearance and a fairly dull shine. 

If I sand the coating off, what can I do to duplicate the appearance?  I would 
prefer to avoid disassembling the calipers to have them re-anodized or plated 
(if they were originally).

Thanks for your suggestions.

Try, production tolerancing!

When anyone makes  mechanical components, no two of them are going to be
exactly the same. So, Bosch (they write the software I believe) creates
software which will run the optimal engine perfectly, and run a suboptimal
engine equally as well. This is why chips work well in some cars, less well
in more, and not too well in a few. Simply a question of how close is the
engine to the tolerance limits and in which way.

For example, a high compression engine will be closer to activating the
knock sensor than a low compression engine. Consequently adding 3 degrees
ignition to the high compression engine will probably result in the knock
sensor coming on and retarding the engine. Result - less power than before.
Conversely, a low compression engine will not activate the knock sensor and
the extra advance will pay off in performance terms. A simplistic but
illustrative answer I hope, and not even Porsche can make every engine the same.

 It is also a way of meeting German Law demanding all engines come within a
tolerance of the claimed power output. Detune them all to the same easy to
achieve level, but I have no idea whether it figures in their programming,
certainly, the ability to get more from most engines has been around for a
lot longer than that law.

It's not that it can't be done (look at any early Ferrari, or the
higher performance versions of the 356 family, or early 911s), it's
that it can't be done *CHEAPLY*. Mass production requirements mean that
things have to be simple and cheap. One carb on a big cast iron manifold
is both. One EFI control setup on a nice tuned aluminium intake is not
much more complex, and "cheap" is relative when you consider the impact
of EPA and CAFE requirements. However, multithroat carbs with tuned 
air horns are *NOT* cheap under any possible interpretation.

Once you've done something to incrase the airflow, you *may* need to
do something to incrase the gasflow. Of course, you'll need some
chassis dyno time to see how this looks under load *FIRST*. Then
once you start making mods, you'll need more chassis dyno time...

There are two simple tricks: 1) larger injectors/higher base fuel
pressure, 2) rising rate regulator.

Larger injectors have an obvious advantage: they're larger, so flow more
gas. There may be special application injectors (I'd guess off-hand
the 931s, maybe the 924 Euro version, certainly the factory racing 
version) that you can use, or you can get them "adjusted" by Kinsler
or Marren Motorsport. Higher base fuel pressure accomplishes the same
thing without changing hardware. These modifications, while increasing
richness when you want it, also run richer *ALL* the time, which is
a huge problem on the street. 

Rising rate regulators are simply put the most effective modification 
you can make to L-jet or CIS motors to get more gas in cheapest. They
change the fuel presssure when you "get on it", which increases gas
flow through the injector. This also makes a better spray pattern
which may also improve combustion. I don't have the manufacturer info
of the top of my head for where you can get these, but they've been
discussed at length many times. See the archives.

Finally, you can use a secondary injection system, with a simgle pulsed
injector blowing gas into the main intake plenum under control of a
secondary controller that's looking at things like RPM, manifold pressure,
etc. This is also a fine solution but takes a bit of fabrication to make
it work.

Anyway, at some point you get into the problem of how stock does
it have to LOOK Like it is, but that's another set of engineering....

the Targa's frame is identical to the Coupe's, and it does NOT have reinforced

Would a Targa or Cabriolet be OK for hard driving, say, maybe a driver's

I have been to several machinists up here in the Great White North and none

it). I assume that shuffle pinning refers to installing dowels above and 
below the bearing saddles. Is this correct? Do you do all three of the 
saddles or is just the central one necessary? Do they in fact help? It seems 
to me that all the shuffle pins in the world won't help if your engine is 
gonna twist enough to toast the *distributor shaft*. My impression is that 
they just prevent the bearing saddles from twisting, and thus, the bearings 
from melting.

Chuck,

        I am currently a attempting a Carrera GT conversion to an '80 924 
turbo. Finally tracked down and received the parts fiche for car (GT), but 
have not had a chance to look at it yet in detail. Yes the GT had 930 
brakes, but not 917 brakes, those was reserved for the GTS/GTR cars. I will 
look those part #'s up for you if you wish. Personal opinion is instead of 
putting on 930 brakes, is to take '86 951 brakes and bolt them on. You will 
need the front struts and the complete rear suspension, but it is a somewhat 
straight forward bolt on process and not "all" that expensive. (Thank you to 
Jim Pasha for that bit of wisdom) Used parts places, *when available* are 
asking about $750 for the stuff.

        I will email you the part # on the brakes/suspension if you still 
wish them, let me know.

        As for the CIS modification, I can not be of much help there at the 
moment. I am currently trying to track down a company to do the recurving of 
the 924 fuel distributor to match the GT. Price on the GT distributor (when 
found) is absolutely unreal. Will keep you posted on this if you wish.

        I was told that in a mag called "Turbo" or some such name, some 
companies are marketing an additional injection port for added mass flow 
under higher rpm/boast conditions. But as stan already pointed out, how much 
flow, how and where do you curve it to your specific engine?

Hey,

The last few days I have a noticed a faint "squeaking" coming from

more of a rythmic scaping (kinda like when brake pads get really thin).
Thinking it was my brakes I pulled the pads out but the noise didn't
go away (the pads/rotor were fine).  I did find some small pebbles stuck 
down in a little cavity between the caliper and the rotor.  Spinning the 
axle with the pads out produced a faint sound real similar to the sound 
of brake pads dragging on a rotor.

I put everything back together and went out for a test drive.  No discernable
noises.  Should I be concerned about the faint sound coming from the 
CV joint bearing-in-the-hub area?  FWIW, both sides made the same noise.

There are other, less flattering words which might be equally applicable.
Since we live in a litigous society, I won't say them. I will stand behind
my basic position that almost all aftermarket chips are either snake
oil or give performance increases at some great expense to engine longevity.

I think John hit on the core issue. In a bottom-line oriented market
where Porsche is routinely taking it in the shorts, the idea that they
are not optimizing the firmware within an angstrom of the last bit
is laughable. I know that I insist on my people getting the architecture
absolutely right, the hardware implementations correct but flexible and
then spend *ALL* of the time tuning software from then on.

Subject: '91 911 C2 oil leak clarified

After personally seeing the leaks today, the CAMSHAFT SEAL,  not the
crankshaft seal is dripping.   This had been previously repaired by Paramount
11/15/94 at 30,085 miles.  Two cylinders HAVE leaked as evidenced by small
stains on the pan under the chassis, but the surface is dry (today).  

Heritage Warranty, a Quaker State Company, paid for the Paramount repair,
$873.48, less $50 deductible .  They will not pay Hendricks for redoing the
job.  Also, they are balking at paying for correcting cylinder "weeps."  They
want to see LIQUID oil dripping.  

Porsche has authorized Hendricks to  re-repair of the troublesome camshaft
seal and save me the time of returning to Paramount.  The other old leak,
"weep" remains unresolved.  If the leak resumes the warranty company agrees
to cover the repair, BUT apparrently will not follow the Porsche tech
bulletin and carry out the repair properly.

Other than that no problems.  Except this is springtime in the south and my
CAB is in the shop while adjustors, service managers and others argue back
and forth.

Any facts, suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks much.

They're for idiots who think they're saving money on their utility
bills.  In California it's illegal to drive with them on by
themselves, but I see people doing it all the time, and have yet to
see anyone being cited.  I can see their usefulness, literally, while
the car is parked, for a limited period of time.  VW, Porsche and Audi
(maybe others) always had the feature that headlights left on would
revert to parking lights when the engine was turned off.

Just my two cents.

I my opinion yes.  Porsche, from my understanding, engineers their cars first
as a carboilets and targas.  This allows them to produce covertibles and
targas that have almost the same rigidity as the hardtop.  The reason they
may be price high is because the hardtops then are in higher demand.

Minor correction here you do want the leakdown to be more than 10-15% 
in any cylinder. leakdonw is cyl by cyl not compared between cylinders.

Subject: Re: Chips

I think that I must agree with the Superchips guy. Of course there is more
performance in the car, although the additional cost of maintenance
intervals and warranty claims negate the benefit. In the case of the Escort
944 Turbos, didn't Porsche come up with the infamous first "head gasket"
chip which optimized the car for racing gas with the idea that each engine
only had to last one race. Blew up head gaskets fast with street gas. If I
am wrong, please be kind...... 
 
On another vein, I sort of recall a Compuserve thread in which a fellow
decided to modify a Superchip EPROM for his car (Eagle Talon Turbo?) He
dumped the Superchip-labelled EPROM, compared it to the stock EPROM, and
ha-ha-ha, found them identical. Superchips response was that they sold a
kit for the car which included a chip and a wastegate spring. This kit
improved hp. So what if it was only the spring that was important. As long
as you got the hp, you had nothing to complain about. Guess they thought
that someone might try to engineer the spring for less than the $200-300
that the kit went for, if they left out the chip. This is by no means an
attack on Superchips. I think that it's a neat way to make money and wish
that I could do something equally clever actually. I'd be very interested
in comments, Peter.

You do much more than the three saddles. You do two pins on each saddle,

Well, it depends. If you do it right -- meaning start with a new case --
*AND* you're talking about racing only, then yes, it helps. But you'll
still only get a fairly short life from a full race engine. For street

Well, it's *REALLY* supposed to keep the case edges from fretting. Once

Sorry, this is Snake Oil and is not a Good Thing. There is no evidence

No. This is a seriously weird view of solving the known oil leak problem
in early 3.6 boxers. If I had a leaker I would go berserk if I took it
in to have it fixed by Porsche and they put Slick 50 in it. The very idea
is utterly absurd.

| It is really good stuff

No. It is worthless at best.

No. Don't ask at your local parts store for anything to do
with your Porsche. Bubba might have a clue about prehistoric
cast-iron V8 truck engines, but he has no idea about ass-engine
nazi slot cars, trust me on this one. Ask a Porsche expert, Stan or 
any of the other People-Who-Know will confirm the facts and evidence
of the crap nature of Slick and similar products.

I would never pollute the engine in my 911 with this stuff, neither 
would 99.99% of the 911 people on the list. Neither would Dr Porsche,
if it was any good the damn things would roll out of the 
factory with Slick 50 in the sump.

Thanks to all of you who have responded to my question on 924

Is the 924 suspension the same as the early 944 type (except for the 
brakes) and does it have the same "shimmy" problem as described by

If you're having large vibrations during braking, very likely you have
warped brake rotors, or less likely, bent wheels or out of round tires.

The 924 suspension in the 197x-1982 US model 924 cars did have the steel
control arms, and probably does in your 1985 model. They probably had less
of a shimmy problem due to smaller wheels and tires.

My guess is that the larger tires reached the design limits of the
suspension and made the adjustments more critical.

Of course all bets are off if the car has ever been in the slightest
accident...

You are entitled to your opinion on whether chips are snake oil or not but......

I am afraid I find the concept of any motor manufacturer tuning his product
to "the last angstrom" somewhat ludicrous. If he did, one engine would be
perfectly in tune and so would every other engine *exactly* the same. Not
even a die hard Porscheophile like Stan could possibly believe that Porsche
can produce a few thousand engines all *exactly* the same. Therefore, all of
the others would be off tune.

Unless of course, Stan thinks that each one is programmed on the dyno
individually. Join the real world on this one Stan.

Subject: 911L Production (LONG)

To all:

I just thought that I would post this to the list for discussion, as a owner
of a 911L I'm curious to hear peoples opinions.

LETTER TO EUROPEAN CAR SEPTEMBER 1993

911L Production

	I really enjoyed the 911 anniversary issue, I thought, however, that you
might like some
additional information concerning the production figures that you have
provided on page 61. My
comments focus specifically on the 1968 model year, since I have just
finished a complete mechanical
restoration of a 1968 911L Coupe.The priminary research for this project
uncovered some fascinating
facts about this vehicle. First, production run of this model was very low.
According to sources at PCNA,
720 of the L were built. This was because the S would not pass Federal
emission standards for 1968. As
a result, Porsche took the light S European bodyshell with the Koni racing
suspension, vented brake
discs, etc. and installed the standard 911 "plain" 2000 series engine in it.
A trim package unique to the
L was then offered. Almost all these cars were special ordered, and few were
equipped the same.
Although only a "fill" model for 1968 (the S returned for 1969), many were
taken direct from delivery to
the shop where they were stripped and more powerful engines installed,
taking advantages of the high-
performance chassis.
	My research shows that many experts feel that there are less than 100
unaltered L models left. I
tend to agree, as I have been approached by two different customers in the
last three months claiming
that they would like to restore their 911Ls. Neither car was an L. The owner
of the car I had just finished
had been told over a dozen times during our search for parts that there is
no such animal as a 911L.
Needless to say, this model of 911 is going to appreciate rapidly as the
last remaining examples are
located and restored. The attraction of this model is not performance but
rather very low production
numbers and a unique options packages. Thanks again for the outstanding issue.

 911 used to be quite popular police cars for high speed pursuits and motorway
(freeway) duties in Europe although now that the 911 has become more expensive
police forces are tending to use 968 club sports with the nessecary extras.

 In fact the original Targa 911 was devolped for the Dutch police force!!!!!
The theroy being you where able to sit on the role bar with a speed gun and thendrop straight into the seat when you needed to!!!!

Growing up in Belgium the white 911 with orange stripe running over the 
hood and trunk was a somewhat regular image. Why these "pursuit 
vehicles" were invariably Targas, I don't know. I seem to remember that the
police light was attached on the driver's side of the Targa bar and the siren 
mounted on the wing-less trunk. Cool job indeed. I am not sure what the 
Belgian State Patrol members in those cars wore, but it could have been 
either the regular blue military uniforms (B.S.P. is a division of the 
Belgian Military), or the motorcycle version: black leather 
outfits with high black leather boots...very Mad Max like! At any 
rate, I am pretty sure they didn't have to wear any helmets in Belgium.
Today the B.S.P. (Rijkswacht) is equiped with Volkswagen GTI's, the VW 
little busses (to pull you in/check papers/question you/and haul you 
off with). The fast car in the lineup to date is the BMW 325i. Yep, 
another poignant illustration of a global recession!

Subject: 911: Motronic advice needed

Phellow Philers,

The car: 
 '86 Carrera, totally stock

The symptoms:
 - At idle, revs bounce between 800 and 1000 RPM immediately after 
   coming down from normal engine speed abruptly. It does this irregularly
   but most often when the engine is fully warm and the outside temp is
   cool (say 40 degrees). Sounds like: "Rump Rump Rump Rump..."
 - When engine is warm, taking off smoothly from a stop is difficult. It
   seems to lose a little power right after I engage the clutch. Basically,
   I get one jerk as I take off.  
 - When the engine is cold  this doesn't happen i.e. takeoffs are smooth.
 - It didn't do this before I removed the engine and put it back.

The question:
 - Is this something I can expect to fix or diagnose if I buy the Bosch
  fuel injection book or do I need specialized tools (like an oscilloscope
  or exhaust gas analyzer) ?

 thanks in advance,
   Chris

Hello All, and in particular to Dave Darling.  Dave,  I just happen to have
som 2.0 litre parts laying around.  I don't know if they will work for you,
but I have a 2 litre short block (block, crank, rods, lifters) and a set of
2 litre heads, all from a 78 VW bus.  I'm reasonably sure they are
identical, save maybe the camshaft.  I also have a box full of 2 litre
sheet metal and injection stuff, all sitting at my ex-wifes house (she
didn't like my car habit, I didn't like her lover) <g>.  They are currently
located in Easton, PA, and I would take just about anything for them.  I
once had this bizzare fantasy about stuffing the thing in a 70 VW Conv.  I
also have a parts transmission for a 74 914 2.0.  The ears are broken off
the case, but the internal stuff looks good, it came from a car that rear
ended a semi at about 60 (ouch!).  All the stuff is kinda grimy, but may
suit your needs.

Subject: '95 911 Carrera 993

Hi,

I posted this on the autocross list (team.net) today and thought
some of you would like to see it. The 993 is now in SCCA 
A-Stock with all the old 911's, and is considering moving 
it to Super Stock with the RX-7 twin turbo and late
model Corvettes (where it seems to fit better).

"Burns, James B." <BurnsJB1@central.ssd.jhuapl.edu> asked :

>I'm not familiar with the new 993.  What engine does it have?  Is it AWD? 
>How does it compare to the Carrera 2 or Carrera 4, and what's its price?

The new 993s are the newest and only 911s now available (the 400HP twin
turbo all wheel drive version will be out soon). The 993 is the first
911 to have a modified body shape - the front end is sleeker and the
rear modified. The engine is an improved version of the Carrera-2 3.6
liter twin-plug engine, tuned to 270 HP and 243 ft/lbs of torque.

The 993 Carrera is standard with 2 wheel drive. The main advantage over
the old C2 (along with the power) is the totally redesigned rear suspension.
Rather than the antique trailing arms used since '65 (and in my '72S)
they have a rear subframe with a multi-link rear suspension. This allowed
Porsche to tune the suspension MUCH more neutrally than any 911 since
the early '70s. Recent 911s have plowed at the limit (!) so that Porsche
could avoid lawsuits from poor drivers going off the road backwards.
The new 993 allows lifting in the turns (some!) without biting you.
The 993 comes with 7 and 9 by 17" rims, which are perfect for the BFG
autocross tires now available (235/45 and 255/40). This larger-than-stock
front tire (stock is only 205) will allow tuning a 993 to be totally
neutral in slow autocross-speed turns.

The price is actually a bit lower (I think) than the C2 that it
replaces. I believe it is a real value at about $60,000. (I drove Tony
Platano's new '95 Camaro 1LE yesterday and can't believe I just said that.
Tony's car is pretty awesome for a GM product - lots of torque and feels
smaller than it looks! And not a flimsy rattle trap like his '86 Vette.) 

The 993 Carrera-4 with the same specs but all-wheel-drive is 
also available now. It uses an improved, simplified AWD 
system that is more effective and cheaper than the one 
it replaced. It is light weight and makes the new Carrera-4 cheaper 
than ANY previous C4 (even less than the '89 model!).
The new 993 C4 does not plow as bad as the original, but I think the
2WD 993 would be better for autocrossing unless there is rain.

Here is the info from my spreadsheet, mostly taken from Autoweek.
The '72 911 price is from the '95 Porsche 968 (the 944 replacement, 
which is the current model A-Stock Porsche. Or is it the amount I 
have spent on my car since 1984?) :-( 

Some of these numbers may be slightly out of date, but they
are quite close. You can see that the 993 is a real rocket ship.
Autoweek recorded the fastest ever slalom speed in it (beating the
RX-7) and said only the ZR-1 was faster in acceleration of any
cars they have tested. If you plot the 0-60, 1/4 mile, Lbs/HP,
or Lbs/Torque, you will see two distinct groups, with the 993
right in the middle of the Super Stock group.

    Car Type      0-60 1/4 m HP   Torque Weight Lbs/HP Lbs/Tor Price
1  92 MR-2 T      6.3  14.9  200    200   2760  13.80  13.80  30000

Subject: Re: General car question (Why parking lights ?)

Mercedes Benz has the feature of leaving one side of parking lights on.  
If you park on the right side of the steet...you can leave the left front 
and rear parking light on.  These are very low energy lights and could be 
left on for 3-5 days w/o discharging the battery.

Considering the small European streets....not a terribly bad Idea.

Now, running lights are a totaly different idea.  In the US we use 
"parking" lights as "running" lights.  I agree that the US version is 
totaly useless, but here in the US....where we have a million laws to ensure 
user safety.....things are done to "look cool" rather than for logical 
resons.

I personally think that daytime running lights are a good safety 
measure....and, I think that they do "look cool."  I think that it GEO 
that is adverting in the US that they are first to have daytime lights as 
standard equipment....yeah, right....and the internal cumbustion engine 
was invented by Edison.

Hello Phello Porschephiliacs,
	My brother and I are still looking for a good P-car in the 5-6K 
range, He decided that the '73.5 911T was too expensive since he couldn't 
get a home equity loan (we seem to have BAD luck with finances :^)  We're 
still looking at 914s but haven't found any good 2.0s.  He's beginning to 
get interested in early 944s, and I'm not going to stop him!
	Anyway, we've found two 944s, an '83 and early '85.  The '83 is a 
one owner w/135K on it that runs good but has a few minor electric 
problems (wipers always on, headlight switch) and needs paint-$3100.  For 
that price we could do many updates or...
	We spotted an '85 (early, unfortunately) w/83K, which is not 
remarkable, other than it has Fuchs forged wheels and a FULL leather 
interior, not the half vinyl like another '85 I saw.  It was in a 
mechanics lot and he said the owner wanted to fix some electrical 
problems (oh boy :^) and sell it, but he doesn't know how much $.  Do the 
Fuchs alloys (and perhaps the uplevel interior) indicate a special 
package, assuming it came from the factory?  What about the "M030" 
package, did this usually come with Fuchs along with the upgraded 
suspension?  What about limited slip?  This car is in decent shape and 
I would'nt ask about it except I feel its a unique model.  Maybe I've got 
my hopes up for what amounts to be an "appearance package".  Let me know 
any and all ideas...
Thanx!

Subject: All Targas Leak! Cabrios?


I've heard many times that all Targas leak.  I believe this is mostly true. 
It seems that new seals last about 5 years then the drips start coming in.

But do Cabrios leak also?  The Targas tend to leak in the front corners above
the triangular deflector windows.  However, I thought the windshield and Targa
top side seals were the same part numbers for both Targas and Cabrios.  This
would imply very similar sealing weaknesses.

So, do Cabrios leak the same as Targas?  Or, doesn't anyone drive his/her
Cabrio in the rain.  Or, is the mention of a Cabrio flaw taboo?

car designed, fabricated and raced by our own 10 hands of a team of 5.  It
was powered by a Yamaha FZ 600 motor that we turbo charged, haltech fuel
injected and ran M85(85% methanol) in.  It produced 100 hp and 95ft-lbf
of torque with a 28mm restrictor upwind of the turbo.  The car weighed
550 lbs and "ran like a scalded dog" to quote the engineer from West
Virginia.  Enough introduction.
Carrol Smiths book on supension design talks a lot about containing the 
roll center and suspension geometry etc., but I've never really gotten a good
feel for how to design roll bars.  My question is not a design question but
an experience question.  I once read a quote from a suspension designer
that read "There are three important things to consider when designing 
a suspension:  One is front and rear roll stiffness and I forget what the
other two are".  I would like to improve my "87" 944 handling but don't want
to live with a real stiff suspension.  Is thicker sway bars the way to go
or do I have to go to stiffer springs and torsion bars.  What are the trade-
offs?

My mech. just gave me the bad news that my '76 914 has a pitted cam lob.  He

don't do it.  Perf. Products recommended doing it. Automotion says OK if its

Porsche and BMW have the same feature (left or right side lights).  GM
is advertising running lights for its new cars, which are already
required in Canada.  Arguably they add safety, but they also
constitute just one more little decision that is taken out of your
hands.  A disadvantage I can see is that if your alternator goes out
they inhibit your ability to drive on the battery to a repair site.  I
would like to see a manual override available for such contingencies
(although I guess you could pull a fuse--if indeed *that* decision is

Subject: Opinion's Please: '72 911T


I'm looking for another project, after having just restored a '72 911E 
Targa.  My preference is another early '70s, but a coupe.  I saw one 
today and am curious to have another opinion or two.  It's not my 
ideal car, but...

1) 1972 911T, 2.4, very little if any rust, numbers match, no signs of 
accident damage.

2) It has a front air dam which looks like the 'S' dam for that year, but 
there is no rubber bumper guard, so I suspect it's an aftermarket unit.  
Wheels are aftermarket BBS's with 205/60's, that look OK, but not 
like a rel Porsche.   Everything else looks stock.

3) Being a T, there are no front or rear sway bars, and minimal 
gauges--like only fuel level, but no oil level; oil temp, but not oil 
pressure. 

4) Transmission seems to be jammed in 2nd gear.  Cannot get it
to shift.  

5) It turned over nicely but wouldn't start when I looked at it.  Owner 
said he's had trouble starting it, but did manage to get it running last 
week.  This doesn't bother me.  I'd rebuild the engine anyway.

Owner said he'd be ecstatic to get $1500.  I'm pretty sure he'll take 
less, say $1000.  Since it is a project, I don't mind redoing the 
transmission, rebuilding the engine, etc.  That's the fun of it.

My concern is:

Even for $1000, is it worth it for a T.  I've heard people say the T's are 
great for around town, but is that really true or are they just saying 
that because they have a T and not an S?

Please e-mail me direct.  I get the digest, which comes late in the day, 
and have to get back to the owner this afternoon.

Many thanks.

I agree that the 928 is an AWESOME car, but I'm realistic.
I'm sure that the engine can put out this kind of power.
But at 9000 RPM and 600HP, how many hours will
it run? Drag cars with huge HP are considered successful
if they can run for a few MINUTES!

If Porsche and big $ race teams can't figure it out, I doubt 
these tuner$ can do it. (I hope I'm wrong, I hate seeing
people lose big $$ making their cars 'faster'.)

But at 300-400 HP, these should last forever and be one of the

last.

I assume these are the same as daytime running lights, like in Canada and

I've heard of this being the case in some European countries (ie.

        Actually, a better solution is cyanoacrylate, also known as "Crazy
Glue".  Get a 1-qt bottle at an industrial supply place, and pour it in
your oil.  Oh--you 911 guys need the 1-gallon size, since you have so
much more oil than "normal" cars.
        If the oil leak doesn't clear up in short order (say, 100 miles)
then put 4-5 grams of iron filings into the oil.  This will bind with the
crazy glue and keep oil from seeping through the little gaps between the
cylinders and the heads.
        If the leak still hasn't cleared up 1K miles after this second
treatment, stronger medicine is in order.  Sprinkle aluminum and iron
filings all around the car's interior and (especially!) engine compart-
ment.  Douse thoroughly with gasoline, then sit in the drivers' seat and
light a road flare.  This should solve the oil leak completely, for all
time.  If you do this in your garage at home, it will also kill any pests
(rats, roaches, unwanted house guests) that are in your house at the time.
        As you can see, all of these approaches do what Slick-50 does,
but do it much better!

In response to the message from AnalogMike@aol.com regarding

My apologies for the flame, but it was my first time flaming.
I thoroughly enjoyed doing it, though.

I agree, running high RPM's and high HP is risky.  The higher
you go with either or both, the more stress the engine is
subjected to.  A friend of mine races 928's, with engines in
the 400 to 500 HP range (naturally aspirated).  He revs to
10,000 RPM as a matter of course, and he usually rebuilds
every 3rd to 4th race for safety.

High RPM horse power can be great fun, when used in moderation.
To this end, I take the hot rodder's oath:

   "I swear that I will use the power sparingly.
   I promise to slow down at cross walks, and to keep at

   I will use the power only for good, never for evil.

Are you sure your not seeing acid rain damage.  Can you wash away these
water spots or do they seem permanent?  Try washing the car early in the
morning when the air is moist and the water isn't evaporating so 
quickly.  Wash the car in the shade otherwise and keep the whole car
wet when you are washing it ,e.g., don't let the roof dry when you are
scrubbing the tires.  If this doesn't work then I suspect you have acid 
rain damage in which case they have to be wet sanded out and buffed -
lotsa work!

I've not played with chips for 'P' cars but the ones I have played with 
are basically a lookup table. Based upon measured parameters the ignition
and injector timeing is adjusted. 

If the parameters in the factory chip are a compromise between performance
and other goals, i.e. emissions, economy/mileage then I would expect 
there to be some room for optimization. 

There may not be much room with the 'P' cars though :-)

Your car is almost 30 years old.. It's from the dinosaur age of automotive 
development.  Porsche recommended adjusting valves every 4-5000 miles. Normal 
maintenance on these buggies dictated that your 3-4Kmile service consisted of 
change oil and filter, adjust valves, reset points, and adjust carbs.  Cars of 
this vintage often had to have brakes adjusted as well(drum brakes).  Big 
changes have taken place over the last 30 years in metallurgy, materials, 
electronics, oils, etc. that have minimized maintenance.   Also, the racing 
set is much tougher on engine parts so valve stem, seat and adjuster wear and 
movement is greater. As a rule, the newer the car the less often one needs 
adjust.

Greetings P-philers,

It seems like I've read a recent thread of people adjusting the valves
to rid themselves of various problems.  So, a naive question from
a '66 912 owner is "why all this adjusting?"  Why do they keep
getting out of adjustment - is it age/wear?

It seems like distributers and valve adjustment are much
more common problems than I originally thought.

In my very biased opinion the safest car I have ever driven is my 911.
However, what is the net wisdom on anti lock brakes, crumple zones,
seat belts etc?

Anti lock: I can control much better the regular brakes on my 87 911 
and 87 Jetta, have very little feel with the anti lock brakes on 
our 94 GMC van. I was able to lock the wheels and brake in a straight line 
with the Jetta when a pedestrian stepped in front of me, and due to 
the extra scrub I stopped in time. With anti lock they would have played
the on-off brake game, and I would have hit him. 

Crumple zones. I know very little, but someone stated some tests 
on a German magazine (Mercedes versus Opel, and others). Could you 
please FAX me a copy of the test results (Prof. Korakianitis
at FAx 314-935-4014).

Seat belts. All I know is that mine are tightened up every time I drive,
and that if ever I'm in an accident I have to replace them.
What's the hoopla with Honda seat belts, anyway?

Any other topics?

Please reply direct to ---> tk@zeus.wustl.edu

I am always amazed by the lack of understanding people seem to have about
manufacturing. As a matter of interest, is statistics taught in High School
in the US? (I'm English and we get a smattering of it in school). I keep on
bumping into people who have the impression that the world is a perfect
place and while I can understand a lack of experience I am amazed at people
who think that you can make something which works on one car  and then they
think it will work on every other car. Perhaps I'm just getting old.

If you manufacture a quantity of anything, then the results will conform to
the well known bell shaped curve. Whether the criteria is power, weight or
even sensitivity to tuning, there will always be this curve indicating that
some are more and some are less, and the further away you get from the
standard, the fewer deviants there will be. If you set the ignition timing
at the top of the curve, 50% of the engines will ping! So it is set back so
that 90% or 95% or even 99.999% won't ping with that timing figure.( I don't
know what percentage Bosch uses) This means that 40% or 45% or 49.999%,as
the case may be, of these engines won't ping if the ignition is advanced.

We move the baseline up a little so that we optimise say 80% of the engines.
The more performance you go for, the fewer respond and yes, the best way is
to tune each one on the dyno individually. As manufacturers we have to
tolerance the chips we make, to balance the performance gains with the
number of returns we get from customers who, at one end of the scale say the
increase is not enough because the timing was not aggressive enough, and at
the other end, from customers who say the car pings because the timing was
too aggressive.

This is why we offer a custom programmming service, so that we can get
closer to the optimum by getting performance feedback from the customers and
altering the settings accordingly. It also explains why we get variable
results from reprogramming chips. Some work, some don't and of those that do
work, the results can vary tremendously.

I am quite happy that there are sceptics amongst you, and there are people
who have tried a chip in their car and it was less than they hoped and so
they sent it back. There are also a lot of very happy customers out there
who have tried a chip in their car and enjoyed the results. I have worldwide
sales (and I mean worldwide) of about $10,000,000 each year and I am not
nearly the biggest player in the US so we must be doing something right.

Now, you guys aren't going to like this bit, but, the latest GM system
presents a bigger challenge than Bosch because it is more advanced. They
have an excellent knock detection system and the engine rides on it nearly
all of the time, running just below detonation. Hence, when we advance the
ignition to get more power, we get zilch. The best I have seen on an LT1 is
13HP and on my Impala SS I got 3HP! The Bosch system is not as nasty as
this....yet. That is an example of the electronics reducing the deviation
from standard which works really well.

Finally, in case you think I am trying use the list as a sales media, I have
been on the net for about 1 year, and in all that time, I have given away
about 10 chips and sold 2 or 3, so I'm not about to waste too much time
trying hard to get a marketing spiel across, just don't discount the product
(mine or anyone elses) because one or two people have found that it was not
succesful in their case. They are the ones at the left hand end of the bell
shaped curve:)

Ahh... Well, Ron, you've just either told us how old you are, or that
you never worked on cars Back When.

It's an "age" problem, all right, but not the way you're thinking. It
is that these parts come from an Age when things were done differently.
Great pains were taken to design things to close tolerances, and for high
performance applications, you had to adjust all sorts of things to keep them 
in their optimal range. Everything was mechanical, there were few power
assist items and the dash board clock was as close to "sophisticated
electronics" as most cars came.

Look at the Driver's Manual for your car sometime -- every 3,000 miles 
you had to adjust valves, change oil, lube and adjust the front end
(well, if you have a 356 - 912s went a bit longer and there was no 
"adjust"), check ignition timing, and check the points.  What happened?
Well, people decided that doing all that was a load of shit and devised
ways around it. Hydraulic valve followers. Breakerless ignition. Capacitive
discharge. Sealed ball joints. Fuel injection. That sort of thing.

It's called Progress, and means that if you think that how any car built
in the last 5-10 years is "normal", then you'll be *REALLY* surprised when
you start driving a high precision sports car from the 50s through mid-70s.

I haven't seen Superchips' marketing literature, but the general perception
is that these chips are being sold as easy, instant performance - FOR EVERY
CAR.  I've not seen an ad (nor would I expect to) that says "this *MAY* 
work".

This makes sense.

>This is why we offer a custom programmming service, so that we can get

This makes sense.  Now it is occurring to me that the holy grail of engine
management would be to calculate engine variables based on closed-loop
operation.  It seems that a highly optimized engine map is only a snapshot
of optimal performance based on engine condition at that time.  The
latest ECUs can adapt, but can they adapt enough?  Or, would it be better
to have another "snapshot" taken?

What's the price of a custom tune?

>Now, you guys aren't going to like this bit, but, the latest GM system

I already found out earlier this week that my '84 928S (L-Jetronic) and
'88 Saab 9000t (LH2-Jetronic) is less sophisticated than my former '85 
Ford Tempo (EEC-IV).

>Finally, in case you think I am trying use the list as a sales media, I have

Not at all.  Personally, I'm happy to be able to actually converse with
someone who knows what they're talking about.  Unless you do this for a
living, it's not often you can get past the marketing hype and understand
the engineering / design principles that can allow you to decide for yourself
whether this would work and if the tradeoffs are acceptable.

Again, I've never seen a chip ad say "engine longevity and drivability may
be negatively impacted."  Again, I haven't read Superchips' brochures.

Subject: 924 CIS


I've been following the thread about the cold start injector and some of the less expensive cures for the problem. The cold start injector can 
stay on for extended periods without damage to the injector. You will 
experience a significant DECREASE in mileage. 

Other than the warmup regulator failing, the other cause of failure is 
broken wires right at the injector, under the rubber boot. Easiest way 
to check is when the engine is cold. Unplug the connector, then test 
to see if 12 volts is present on one of the pins. If it isn't, and the 
warm up regulator is switching correctly, the wire is broken. To test 
the solenoid, just measure across the two pins on its connector, there 
should be less than 10 ohms present.

If you are seeking to enrich a 1980 - 82 924 Turbo or 80.5 - 82 924, 
there is a device called a frequency valve located just under the 
throttle plate on the manifold. It works in the same manner as a DME 
injector, only it bleeds off excess pressure to the return line to the 
gas tank.  This may be altered to increase the enrichment on a 924 Turbo
(all models that use this system) to avoid changing of the fuel 
distributor. The 924 Carrera does have a different fuel distributor, 
which is a recalibrated 928 unit. The GTS also uses this system. The 
GTR uses a long stack mechanical system. The GTS uses a completely 
different intake and intercooler than the Carrera 924.

If you are driving a normally asirated 924 on the street, the best thing
is to use a bypass for the catalyst and a good header with the stock 
rear exhaust section. There is a 11 HP gain this way with no fooling 
with the CIS. I did some serious dyno tests for a well-known aftermarket
supplier. This was the best. We also found that the 80.5 - 82 924 
delivers 14 more real HP at the rear wheels than the earlier cars. They
have the best CIS, exhaust and head of all the 2.0 924s.

Let me apologize in advance ....
Our e-mail system went toes-up for several days just after I submitted the
following question and I've missed about 6 digests, so I've probably missed
any/all replies.

Would anyone who replied to this message (or someone who would like to) give
it a try, once again?  I sure could use some expert advice!

- ------------  Original message with latest info follows  ---------

A recent thread on auto a/c indicated that there are
some P-philers out there who understand more about
air conditioners that I do and I'm hoping that your
collective wisdom can help me out of a jam.

My '84 928S sprang a leak in the a/c recently and the 
dealer (after an hour and a half of diagnostics) found 
a pinhole leak in an alloy pipe running from the
compressor hose to the firewall area. (I think it goes to a
fuel cooler, then to a short pipe which in turn goes 
through the firewall to the expansion valve.   My first
 thought was that it would be an easy fix ... well, they
 want a fairly hefty price when you add up labor, parts 
(pipe, gaskets, freon, etc) and sales tax.  Being a 
cheapskate (squeezing the nickel until the buffalo farts), 
I've been thinking about doing the pipe replacement 
myself.

Here are my questions.  First, I've been told that  the pipe is on the high
pressure side of the compressor.  Can I 
either solder the pinhole or have a shop weld it closed 
such that it will hold up under pressure?  Would a radiator 
shop do that kind of work or would I take the pipe to
an a/c shop?  A machine shop?   Do I need a pipe, or 
could I just make a custom hose using the same type 
of a/c hose and fittings that are coming from the 
compressor?

Second, would it be worth risking buying a salvaged pipe
if I can find one?  How would I test it before installing? 
How many PSI should it be able to take?

Third, if I do the removal and replacement work myself, 
what do I need to do to avoid damaging my system?  For
 example, I seem to recall a statement in one of the 
threads that if the system is exposed to outside air, 
the drier (?) will be contaminated/ruined.  When I take 
the pipe out, of course the system will be exposed to the
air, so should I just plug the compressor hose and the 
fuel cooler opening?  With what should I plug them (a 
baggie wrapped around the hose and secured with 
electrical tape?)??

Fourth, have any of you had this type of problem?  The 
mechanic said he had never seen one of these pipes leak before.

Any and all suggestions would help me greatly as all I
know about a/c is where the button is to turn it on! 
FWIW, I do most of my own maintenance and am
somewhat mechanically inclined.

TIA for all your help!

I have an Ansa on my '83 with SSI headers and the sound is nicely

Subject: Several 911 questions

I have a couple of questions as a new Porsche owner.

First, and this crossed my mind because of the stuck cold start injector
thread, what kind of mileage should I expect from my 1979 911SC? I've only
gone through one tank of gas and drove moderately aggressively over a mix of
highway and city miles. I think I got about 14 mpg. Is this reasonable?
What's the best I can expect if I drive a little more sedately?

Second, when I turn the ignition to the On position, something electrical
begins humming fairly loudly. I believe it persists after the engine has
started, but it's a little hard to tell because of the engine noise. What is
this sound?

Third, the driver side window sticks at about the midpoint on its way down.
Sometimes it will go all the way down, sometimes it won't. What can I do to
remedy this?

Finally, I posted this last week and received a reply suggesting that the guy
who might be able to answer it was on vacation at the time, so I'll try
again: The color code of the car is 453-9-3 and the shops I've called can't
identify it by name. I would call it copper; it was suggested that it might
be "cognac brown". Clues?

Thanks much from a quite ecstatic new 911 fanatic! Wahoo!

They are just for safety. GM is advertising that all there cars now have 
"daytime running lamps" which is the same thing. My 911 H4's have sockets in 
them for these, I think they all do. I think they are a good idea even when

When I attended a Derek Bell driving school some years ago I had my first
look at Porsches with ABS. We used our own cars, mine was an '85 cpe. Part
of the school was practicing stopping without lock-up. Hitting the breaks
hard up front, then letting up a bit allowing the rear to work as well. (a
great way to demonstrate the value of refreshing the break fluid now and
then) Well, there were a couple of early C2s in attendance. The
instructions to these drivers was to more or less just stand to the breaks
(this was all straight line stopping from around 60 or so). Damn
impressive. None of the non-ABS cars pulled up as short as the ABS cars.
Not once. I now have a C2 and while I liked the feel (mechanical) of the
breaks on my '85 much better, I think the C2 will stop quicker for me on
wet or dry pavement. Not so sure on sandy/gravel surfaces.

Here is what I did, it may be of help to you :
I tried to remove the bolts on my 84 911 exhaust system but they were
welded on from age and rust, so I took the easy route and spent $25 and
saved my fingers and a lot of bad language!
I went to my local muffler guy who I trusted from previos work, and had him
burn off/melt off the nuts and bolts on my exh system. I asked him to do
ALL the bolts from the headers back to the banana muffler. I then replaced
all the nuts and bolts with fresh ones and used anti seize stuff. I then
went home and installed a test pipe and a Bursche muffler(new gaskets
installed of course) I used a metal brush to clean the pipe surfaces. I
felt a little increase in the performance of the car, but it may have been
psychalogical (spelled right?). The sound of the Bursche is music to my
ears and it is not loud at all IMHO. When the windows are closed, I can
still hear the Boxer singing as usual.
Now I can change mufflers in about an hour. (used anti seize on the O2
sensor too).


        Hope this helps.

        You are right Jeff, it is illegal to run w/o a Cat in most of the

 I run with a stock muffler and a cat or a Bursche muffler and a cat. My
car passed California smog with both mufflers no problems (had to lean out

Subject: 928 Clutch Job: DIY?


Hi all,

I'm gearing up to research the possiblity of doing the 928 clutch 
replacement by myself. I've gone through the Workshop manual 
couple times already. I seems not impossible to do it myself.
Questions to all are:

(1) Do I need to drop the transmission to replace the clutch? 

    The manual says no. My boss, who is driving a 944 Turbo Cup Sport
    says maybe. If yes, I guess I'll need the transmission stand
    and some alignment tools, which would be discourage enough for
    me to take it to the $hop.
	
(2) What special tools do I need? 

    From the manual, it seems to me that a couple complete sets of
    socket and wrenches may do. However, do I need any alignment 
    tool? The manual does not mention much about alignment except
    to mark the relative position of the flywhell, intermediate
    plate, and the pressure plate. 

(3) If do it myself, how long should I expect it to take?

    The reason for asking is, I will probably rent a garage over
    one weekend. I need to plan ahead the time it takes so as to
    schedule any other works to do while the car is up in the air.

I've gone through the 94 archive and found out someone was planning
to do the 928 clutch  job around May 94. Could any experienced
P'piles give me some hints?

As usual, thanks in advance.

What do you currently have as far as sway bars? The factory front and rear
are pretty god, but don't give you any adjustability. I'm not a expert, but
for street and occasion "spirited" driving I would go up to a heavier
spring, mabye 220 lbs, slightly larger tortion bars, mabye 26mm, and some
adjustable swaybars. Weltmeister sells both, and they work well. If you have
factory bars, try the spring and tortion bar increase first. You can do it
all yourself, but the T-bars are tough. It's worth your cost to have a shop
put them in for you. Remember, this will make your ride harder, but it
shoulden't rattle your kidneys. I liked the feel when I had this setup in
mine. A lot of the local fast 944 drivers-education types(some of who are
very fast) have the same basic setup in their street cars.

Hope this helps.

It varies. Remember this is a 3 liter engine, and high performance
at that. I used to get about 420 km to a fillup, which is what? About
21 km/gallon, times .62 is... 13 mpg. So I guess you're about right

Fuel pump. If it's making a lot of noise, then it's getting old and tired
and you need to get ready to replace it.

Something is wonky in the regulator. Or it could be the motor on the window
on that side. In any event, a competent body shop can fix it for you.

if my alternator is working erratically (the light doesn't always come on 
when I turn the key on... only about 50% of the time) will I damage 
anything by driving the car?  I can tell it's not working (in addition to 
the light being spastic) by the windows being slow, and the lights are

The "on-off brake game" usually occurs at over 10Hz (10x per second).

The primary advantage of anti-lock brakes is that you
can steer while under heavy braking, even on slick surfaces.  
Straight-line braking performance in most car mag. tests does 
not seem to improve much with ABS, as you suggest, but that's with
a skilled driver on a dry surface.  Try stopping in a straight
line by locking your wheels on a wet road covered with fallen 
leaves.

It's interesting to note a recent concern that ABS has not
made cars safer, but may have actually contributed to some
accidents.  This is allegedly because people think they will stop 
faster, and they forget to steer around the obstacle/person/etc.

Subject: Re: alternator woes...

Buzz,

The fact that your alternator light doesn't always come on when you turn on
the key indicates worn brushes in the voltage regulator.  If one of the
brushes isn't making contact with the commutator you lose the continuity
required to light the light.  This is not an unusual problem on 911s with
internal voltage regulators.  It can possibly be cured by replacing the
voltage regulator but the big question will be, "how much wear is there on
the commutator itself.  If it's minimal,  you can probably replace the
regulator without any further alternator work.  If the grooves where the
brushes make contact are deep I would have an electrical specialist take a
look at it and see if it can be turned.  If they are really deep, (2-3mm)
 you will probably have to replace the alternator as the brushes in the new
regulator will wear out very quickly.

Hope this helps

It is safe to say that this will take more tools than you have and
more time than you thought.  It is just one of the laws of nature.  I
have the luxury of letting something sit in the garage for a couple of
weeks while I order more parts or go get more tools.  I would not look
forward to undertaking such a task as a 928 clutch replacement in a
garage I rented for the weekend.

If the noise is high-pitched and coming from the engine compartment, it's
the Bosch capacitor-discharge (CD) ignition unit, and electronic thingy
that generates high voltage spark. It's supposed to whine like that.

Dear Porschephiles, 

I am in the process of buying my first Porsche and have run across what 
I thought to be an excellent 87 944S for 9950.00.  It has low miles (76K), 
nice paint, and nice uncracked interior.  However, after a prepurchase 
inspection was done the following items were found:
  
1.  Cam belt shows signs of edge shaving.  They speculate that the 
    pulley was incorrectly installed.  Front seals leaking also.
    To Fix:  Replace front seal and fix pulley (p&l)........    507
    To Replace cam and roller belt (parts)..................     77
    To Replace ALL rollers at same time.(p&l)...............    350

2.  Starter needs to be replaced.  Current starter (non-bosch unit)
    has cracked housing, cracked solenoid, and cracked mountings.
    To Fix:  Replace with rebuilt Bosch unit.(p&l)..........    412

3.  Alternator cooling hose missing.
    To Fix:  Replace hose..(p&l)............................     50

7.  Sway Bar bushing swollen from oil spillage.
    To Fix:  Replace bushing. .(p&l)..........................   40

8.  Some body damage to front headlight area.  Inspection shows
    that body work was done correctly. .....................    n/a
    All fixes recommended: 1 - 7          2326.00
    Less 350 for all rollers being good   1976.00

The seller is very reluctant to lower the price of the car any to 
compensate for any of these repairs.  His attitude is that this is just
the way it is with Porsches (he has a 928 too).  I don't expect a 
full 2k off the price, but at least halfway would be fair in my opinion.
Am I way off base?  Should I just walk away and find another?  That's
what my wife thinks.  I'm a little fuzzy right now.  It could be Porsche
pheremones.  ;-)

My Targa top has the typical crack in the vinyl at the fold areas.  Only 
once in a driving rainstorm (when the car was parked) did I find any 
leakage (and at the typical sopt just above the top of the little 
triangular window).  Drove in heavy rain last week for 6 to 8 hours 
(twice) and no probs.  Kinda quirky.  I too wonder if replacing seals 
will make any difference.  Of course, I prefer driving without the top on 
(i.e. only in the sun) but it would be nice to be secure in the elements 
as well. 

BTW, how much to have the vinyl replaced?  Any good references for this?

Or if the price is low blue book based on condition extras and so on.

What you need to decide will be p-car be worth 11,000-12,000 when you

I believe the feature you're referring to on Porsches,BMWs, and on M-Bs 
is a parking light, which is either the left or the right one. This is 
useful mainly in Europe, where the roads are narrow, and when a little 
light on a dark may go a long way to prevent an accident. These aren't 
running lamps, but parking lamps. 

As an aside, if you've ever seen a Saab or Volvo (in Euro-spec), there'll

Subject: #8 Custodian's Report

My thanks for the patience and *Generosity* of those of you who sent your
checks, and have been waiting for me to get off my duff and get them in
the bank.

With two deposits since the last report (total $565 for both) we now have 
$7,190 in the Bank (we're getting 5% interest, so we actually have a few more 
pennies than that).

It gives me great pleasure to join you all in offering our special thanks
to our new Patrons: Drew Spencer who, besides sending a very generous
check, sent great pictures of his pristine white RS America at home and
with him, at the track - Thanks Drew), Canadian Perci Hala (Perci, I
guess that my bank will cash this check as USD, not CN) and Alex
Noordergraff!

Did I mention that it's easy for anyone to take advantage of our easy
upgrade policy, to join the exhaulted rank of Patron, merely by sending
another check to bring your total up to $100 (or *more*, if the spirit
moves...)

Our *hearty* and heartfelt thanks to you all!

It gives me no less pleasure to extend our thanks to new members: David
Brown, Mike Tietel (who sent a Pic of his handsome and no doubt
Porshcephillic Dog, Kai), Scott Kelly, Stephen Chivers and Scott Ellis.

Subject: 914 left (!) suspension problems!

Well, I almost feel like crying - just got the official word on my 
rubbing left rear tire. A little background:

Last weekend, was taking a right-hand turn off an expressway, hit a 
bump, and the 914 oversteered. Not badly, but I didn't think it would 
at all - I wasn't going that fast. The car stunk of rubber smoke for a 
couple minutes. I glanced, looked like all was in order, and forgot 
about it.

Later in the week, noticed funny noises from the left rear - felt like 
a flat front left tire, or no spring in the left rear. Noticed a rub 
line on the inside of the left tire - it had rubbed the inner fender by 
the top of the tire. (195/50 tires probably didn't help. :) It hadn't 
rubbed bad, but it had definetely hit. Do a little observation, notice 
the car sitting a little lower on that side. I knew the springs were 
really worn out, so I thought perhaps I broke a spring - though it was 
quiet, and I couldn't see how that'd make the tire rub. So I've got my 
Eiback 100lb (110lb?) springs on their way from California (to New 
York.)

So today I'm out with my restoration friend who does the work on the 
car, and the whole thing sounds a little fishy. We jack up the corner, 
and notice a bolt ALMOST all the way out of the CV joint by the tranny. 
OK, we replace that - the others seemed OK. Sounds a little strange, 
but not like something that'd make the wheel move. (Did I mention the 
entire wheel could be moved around a little when it was jacked up?) 
While moving it, I notice... The suspension was broken off from the 
body ahead of the tire. Damn rust! So anyways, it looks like I need to 
find a nice bit patch piece to repair it, however, everyone has the 
right one (from the usual battery-tray rust), and noone has the left 
one! Plus, it looks like we'll have to cut away the quarter panel to 
get access to weld in the new piece... And since it's stronger metal 
(probably 16 guage?), it's not something that he can fabricate.

Anyone else had this experience, or have any advice? (OK, so I don't 
feel like crying, but it is a bit of a bummer. *Sigh* Especially when 
it's my daily driver - gonna have to borrow a car to get me to work 
while it gets repaired.) Am I the only one with a 914 that's relatively 
solid on the passenger side, and all rotted on the driver's side?

Subject: 914 rear trunk height adjustment?


The rust repair is coming along fine.  I (and the current rain storm :)
did a little experimenting to attempt to find out where the water
is getting in.

The main culprit appears to be the passenger side height adjustment.
The weather stripping just isn't making contact with the lid.  The
water runs down the edge of the trunk, onto the interior bottom portion,
and then drips inside.

The height is incorrect (about 1/8") right above the hinge and
progresses all the way down the entire side.  If it was just the
far edge, I'd bend the lid a bit.  But since it's off by the hinge,
it seems like there should be some other sort of adjustment.

Sooo, how is this adjustment made?  The trunk hinge has 3 or 4
bolts to fiddle with.  The Haynes manual is totally useless (suprise).

To me, it looks like I will need to disconnect the torsion spring.  To
remove that, Haynes says I have to take off the trunk lid.  This
would make it rather difficult to adjust the height of the lid. :)

Anyone done this before?

OK Guys,
	Please stop doing this to me; I've just finished reading Vol's article 
about the "turdburger of the month award" when Dave Darling comes along with some 
*TRULY EXCELLENT* ideas for all of dear old Mr ZeeMax's vehicles (and probably his 
house- 'cos you know he'll try it).  I've only just managed to get back on my seat 
after falling off it from laughin' too much, and my missus is getting suspicious 
about me having too much fun here...

	On a more applicable note, my dear old red 944 is about to turn 139,000 
which will be a momentous occasion in its life since about two months ago it was 
in the junkyard. Engine rebuild tags for $3000 will do that to a car.  Anyway, I 
still want to connect a couple of LED's into the alarm system, and I was wondering 
if anyone has an idea about which wire to the alarm goes live upon switching it

from upsetting the neighbours when the alarm starts going off if I'm under there 
poking around with my voltmeter.

You can have it welded, but since I don't know what kind of material the 
pipe is made out of it may be tough to weld.  The high side of the 
compressor usually sees pressures of around 275-300 PSI but during a very 
hot day it may see pressures around 350PSI.  Making a custom out of a 
rubber type material will only leak more.  Freon has a way of finding its 
way out of any porous material.

A used one would be fine if it hold pressure.  To test is going to be 
tough with out special fittings and a high pressure compressor.

Anything to plug the hole is fine.  Just don't let it sit around with air 
getting into it along with the water vapor that's in the air.  Next, you 
should try and get the system evacuated after fixing the hose.  That is 
removing all air and moisture that has gotten in with a vacuum pump.

> Fourth, have any of you had this type of problem?  The 
> mechanic said he had never seen one of these pipes leak before.

Usually the pipes don't have a problem unless there has been a lot of 
vibration that has caused a flare joint to fail at a fitting from being 
stressed back and forth at a small distance; tough to imagine but I just 
had it happen on a two month old power steering high pressure line at the 
fitting.  Nice stress fracture at the flare joint.

If you can't get access to the freon to refill, the shop you take it to 
should be able to evacuate the system for you.

Ummm. I'll guess "yes". Just about all the 914s that have broken
suspension consoles that I've ever seen had bad units on the
passenger side, *NOT* the driver's side. In fact, I know that you can
trivally get replacement weld-in units for the passenger side (BTDT)
but I'm not even sure that part is listed for the driver side!

Your absolute best bet is to find a good body shop with a good fabricator
and see if he can make enough parts to fix it. You'll need a factory
shop manual for the dimensions and offset for the pickups, etc.

Good luck!! Let us know how it comes out.

That's what I was afraid of... *Sigh!* The most I can find is a listing in 
Automobile Atlanta for the entire console and engine tray for the left side 
for $550... Ouch! I'll hafta pull out the shiny new 914 microfiche that 
Porsche just sent us at work and see what the factory says... (Not bloody 
likely though - if they have it, it'll be ungodly expensive, I bet.)

Yeah, we were talking about that (especially since there's a good part of my 
floorpan that was fabricated), but for a part as critical as the suspension 
console, it'd be better to have the piece specifically made for it - 
especially with the low-guage metal, harder to fab, donchaknow... :(

>Good luck!! Let us know how it comes out.

Will do. Something's gonna happen soon, one way or the other - like I said, 
it's my daily driver, and something's gotta be done ASAP. Boy, does it stink 
living in the salty north! :)

Subject: Re:914 Suspension.......

Jeff,

Since the suspension console problem on the left side is relatively unusual,
perhaps finding a dismantler who would be willing to cut that area out of a
previously discarded chassis would be a possibility.

When I was building my SCCA IT car I acquired miscellaneous body and chassis
parts from Tom Conway at Carquip in Boulder Colorado.
His phone # is 303-443-1343.  Colorado is not salt country so chassis parts
are generally in good condition plus Tom is knowledgeable in the body/chassis
repair techniques required to fix this problem.  If you describe to him how
much of this area you need I'm sure he can help you out.  (You might discuss
this with your body man first to make sure you get what he feels he needs to
make the repair).

We see this problem more on cars with stiff suspension and sticky tires which
are used in track events.  This is why the use of chassis reinforcing in this
area is a good idea as most 914's will start coming apart under these
conditions.  So far my 914-6 has escaped any chassis problems, but since it
is used exclusively for Club Racing and Drivers Ed, I check it thoroughly
after every event. 

Since this will probably be a fairly expensive repair, and it sounds like you
have other rust problems, you might have to evaluate your commitment to this
particular car and weigh the cost of repair against the cost of replacement.

Good Luck

Good rule to always follow:  Never say always.

The rear trunk in my 914 fills up with water when it rains.  So I
followed the sage advice and hermetically sealed the tail lights.
(New gaskets/lenses, RTV, enough gunk to keep a diaper pail from
smelling on a hot day!)  Trunk still filled with water.  After
a really good rain, the pockets for the top latches would have
water in them.

I have found the path of the water.  It's some weird capillary action
around the inside of the trunk lid.  So the weatherstripping around
the trunk is important.

Gary.

I'm looking for a good quality floor jack that will slide under a car with

Can anyone tell me where I might find a jack that will fit under my car?!

A cheaper solution would be to get the jack pad sold by Automotion,
maybe others.  It fits into the jack port and should give you the
extra clearance you need.  It does in mine (whereas my mechanic needs
me to lift the car up a bit so he can get *his* jack underneath!).

PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Champlain Region

When You Wish Upon A Star - Part V


We soon left the mall to the mallians, and proceeded to an appointment
with destiny.  John, who was more attuned to mystic forces than Frank
or I was since donning the Madam Zelda hat, clearly felt it first. 

"Chris, this is the car you will buy," he said as we arrived.

I didn't believe him at all, but the accuracy of his prediction is
still further proof that we were merely following a predetermined
course. 

We had developed during our feast at the mall a new strategy for
impressing the owners of cars we visited.  This strategy employed a
tool we had yet to use in our mind games with those we dealt with -
Karl was actually German.  We decided to pose as a team of German
Porsche specialists, John and Karl would perform their usual
inspection of the car,  except that when they found anything they
would say something in German.   The plan called for me to stand with
a clipboard, like some obergruppenfuhrer, pretending to understand
them and jotting down notes.  Karl fed John some German phrases about
torsion bars and rust, and after several failed rehersals I settled on
some canned responses such as, "Ja," "Ja?" and of course, "Gut." 

We assaulted the car in Blitzkreig-like fashion, while I, employing a
heavy German accent, explained to the owner what they were doing.
Karl spewed forth a steady stream of observations, which he later told
us was the words to a song he learned in elementary school.   The car
was a metallic blue 1971 911T.  The original color had been burgundy,
but it had been repainted as the result of an accident suffered in
1973.  The paint actually looked very good for fifteen years old, and
luckily all the rubber had been well preserved since it was under the
paint. 

It was difficult to tell how much of an effect our act had on this
guy, because we soon revealed what turned out to be our most
impressive tool.  There are only a few things that I can whip out of
my "tool belt" the sight of which will fill people with awe - jaws
drop open, and the faint-hearted swoon.  I am talking, of course,
about the stethescope.  It is a simple device, really, and none of the
three of use could ever have predicted its universal and undeniably
profound effect.  Bringing forth the stethescope was like injecting a
truth serum into the sellers we met.  Suddenly, "perfect" cars became
cars that "dropped a valve a few years ago," or "ran for a few minutes
without oil."  I'm not counting in this assessment the time I tried to
listen to the spark plug wires (the resulting jolt of electricity
perhaps explains a lot about these articles), other than that one time
we had people so impressed we were considering wearing it whenever any
of the aforementioned scantily clad women came into view.  

In this case the stethescope immediately brought forth the confession,
"My mechanic says the carbs need to be rebuilt."  Actually one of the
milder revelations we heard.   Karl noted a few oil leaks, but found
the car to be basically solid.  John, in his examinations of the front
end, did find something disturbing. 

"Karl, kommen hier, bitte," he said.  Karl crawled out from inside one
of the cylinders and joined John in the trunk.  After conferring a
moment, Karl spewed forth some more gibberish in German and motioned
for the owner and me to take a look. 

"Zis car has been hit," said John.  "Look at zis."  He pointed at a
region of the trunk behind the passenger side fender.  "Look at all
zis velding."   

Of course the standard response to such an accusation is, "That
happened before I got the car."    One day I'm going to meet the guy
who gets into all these accidents...  

The repair seemed good enough, however, and the rest of the car and
interior was immaculate, so the next step was to test drive the car.
This was actually my first test drive of the trip, so I tried to keep
calm.  I attempted to explain away my nervous shaking as the result of
a wound suffered when my family was fleeing the Nazis.  In response to
the owners voiced skepticism that I was old enough to have lived in
Nazi Germany, I said,  "Ahhhh, yes, vell, I grew up in Illinois, you
see."  This seemed enough for him and we took off.  I was pretty
impressed, actually, that the guy had even heard of Illinois, most of
the mall children we'd met seemed to think the United States was made
up of California, Mexico, and the "East." 

The car started easily and drove well.  I was still pretty tentative,
and was only foiled twice by the 901 gearbox; luckily there was no one
behind us either time I inadvertanly shifted into reverse.  It was a
little embarrassing, though, since one of those times we were sitting
at a red light revving engines with a Camaro.  When the light changed
to green, the chevy spun its tires in place for about five minutes
while I backed up to the previous intersection.  By the time I made it
back to the intersection, he had worn through to the belts and I
sailed right by.  The really funny part is that as I passed him, I
noted the expression on his face and it was clear he felt he'd "won."
After all, I hadn't spun my tires at all. 

While driving, I noticed something didn't seem quite right: the car
seemed a little "loose" in the front steering, but after Karl test
drove it he seemed to believe that it was just my lack of experience
with driving cars that don't have an engine over the front wheels.
Although in the end it turned out I was right, and there had been
something wrong, Karl's explanation quieted my fears.  After a short
conference with my collaborators, I approached our host. 

"Vell, as ve have pointed out, zere are several prRRr...excuse me, let
me just vipe zat off your face...ahh, zere ve go.  As I vas saying,
zere are several prrRRrroblems vis ze car, and I sink zat ze prRRrice
of seben sousand is too high.  I am villing to offer you six." 

The guy considered for a moment and shook his head.  "No, I'd like to
get a little more than that," he said. 

I nodded.  "Vell, I have your telephone number.  Ve vill look at some
more cars and perhaps I vill call you back.  Sank you."   

Back in our car, I was barely able to contain my excitement as I said
to John, "Did you see his expression? I think he will take 6500.  I
think the car is worth 6500, don't you?"  John and Karl both seemd to
agree.  I made a little note of that in my list.  Things were starting
to look up. 

We visited several more locations that afternoon, and most were
promising, though by and large we were hoping for much better deals. 

Our final appointment took us way off the beaten track.   It was
getting late, around 8PM, which for us was 11, so we were starting to
tire and hunger a bit.  While it was still fairly bright out, the lack
of direct sunlight seemed to cast the world in vague shadows.  We
weren't exactly lost, but Karl had already stopped at four or five
payphones to call for directions.   Somehow our mood had begun to
shift imperceptably, and these factors served to exaggerate our
response when we finally arrived at our destination. 

To begin with, the problem had been that Karl was not a native speaker
of English, the person giving directions likewise, and the breakdown
in communications occured in the one trying to convey to the other
that he was located in the back of a large construction site.  We did
finally figure this out, and as our car bounced slowly along the
truck-compressed gravel road, John and I began to feel a little
nervous.   

I should be clear that John and I had both grown up in New York City,
and were naturally extremely suspicious people.  We were not normally
prone to over-react, however, nor were we ever particularly impressed
or frightened by much.  Still, growing up in such an environment does
breed a certain wariness, a certain ability to detect and avoid
situations that are not quite as they should be.  Driving to the back
of a deserted construction site always sets off all the alarms. 

We approached one of the few completed buildings in sight, and I made
a visual reconnaisance of the area, planning an escape route.   Karl
parked next to what was clearly the car we had come to see, and we
extracted ourselves from our own vehicle.  John and I exchanged
nervous glances.  My ninja-type sixth sense was now fully activated.

One of the doors in the completed building opened, and I swung my gaze
slowly around to regard the person coming out.  My reaction was quick,
despite the fear which consumed my entire being instantly.  Supressing
the urge to panic, I screamed and dived headlong into our car,
reaching for the Uzi I kept stashed under the seat.  

Now you, reading this from the quiet comfort of your home, or office,
or walking down the driveway to throw this magazine in the garbage,
may think that I not only failed to supress the urge to panic, but
that my reaction was a little drastic.  Let me assure you, however,
that first of all if I had panicked I would not have had the presence
of mind to actually open the car door before executing the dive
maneuver, and second of all it is likely you have never come face to
face with Carlos, "the Jackal," famed international assassin and
terrorist.  Carlos is believed to be responsible for the death of
several hundred people, and as my hand groped desperately for the
soothing metal of the machine gun, I realized we were going to be
next.   

Was this, in fact, the destiny I had been so relentlessly driven to
for the past few days?

I think you may find the vertical adjustment at that point is profoundly
influenced by the location of that hinge-bolt pivot, and that yours may
have been replaced at some time in the past.  I had one go on mine (the
shouldered bolt siezes, and rips the attachment point off the body), but
I was lucky & found someone who fixed it well.

Be careful if you have to take that torsion spring off - that thing is
under unbelievable tension (at least, I didn't believe it until i took
one off :) ).  The factory books, and maybe the Haynes manuals show a
locally-fabricated tool to get it off.  I remember it was a real bear.

Good luck with it,

I'm applying Blue Coral's "Pure Carnuba Wax" to my 911.  The instructions

When I try this - the "wiping dry" part is difficult.  First pass with

Is this the normal method?  Am I taking off too soon or not soon enough? 
Or just feeling lazy?

Carbons will work for these needs, but not the "Green" as they need to be

Any suggestions/recommendations welcome.  Also, if anyone has shopped the

        Griot's Garage sells an oil-eating microbe that I've been meaning
to try if it
ever warms up around here (I live in Denver, and had the top off my Targa
through half of February.  When it hasn't snowed in the last two weeks, it's
rained.  Unka Bart, I might need some of them little blue ones).

        Another thing that you might try is muratic acid, which is
evidently used
to clean stains from swimming pools.

        Please note that I have yet to try either method.  No warranties
are expressed
or implied.  YMMV.  Etc, etc.  Let me know what works <g>.

Subject: 911 Squeakin' & Leakin'

Hey,

After years of quiet service, my brakes have suddenly decided
to start squeaking.  It is usually under light braking (e.g. stopping
at stoplights, etc).  I pulled all my pads, found nothing amiss (plenty
of pad material left, rotors within spec, everything *looks* OK).
Any ideas what might have caused the squeaking to start all of
the sudden?  I have successfully used some of that spray-on disc
brake quieting stuff in the past - is this band-aid kind of fix
verboten on a pcar?

In the process of pulling my front pads, I noticed that my 19 year
old Boges are leaking.  Alot.  Coincidentally, I ordered a set of Konis
last week (big excitement around the Dayton house).  Can I assume
that the leakage is a function of the worn Boges?  Or is this some
generic problem I need to address?

I am also going to re-pack my wheel bearings in the front and re-build 
my rear calipers (the dust boots on the pistons look pretty rough).
Not that this is relevant, come to think of it...

Any comments or concerns would be appreciated!

Subject: RE: Motronic problem

Written 4/27/95......................

Subject: Motronic advice needed
The symptoms:
 - At idle, revs bounce between 800 and 1000 RPM immediately after 
   coming down from normal engine speed abruptly. It does this          
   irregularly
   but most often when the engine is fully warm and the outside temp is
   cool (say 40 degrees). Sounds like: "Rump Rump Rump Rump..."
 - When engine is warm, taking off smoothly from a stop is difficult.   
   It seems to lose a little power right after I engage the clutch.     
   Basically, I get one jerk as I take off.  
 - When the engine is cold  this doesn't happen i.e. takeoffs are       
smooth.
 - It didn't do this before I removed the engine and put it back.
The question:
 - Is this something I can expect to fix or diagnose if I buy the Bosch
   fuel injection book or do I need specialized tools (like an
   oscilloscope  or exhaust gas analyzer) ?
thanks in advance,
   Chris
.......................................

Chris,

Buy the Bosch book, by Probst, it's well worth the $30 (Bently
published). Finished reading the motronics section today.  You don't 
need an exhaust analyzer etc. it just makes things easier.  The must 
haves are a multimeter and potentially a fuel pressure gauge.

Your symptom sounds like a vacuum leak.  I eliminated the same sysmptom 
on a motronic by properly torqueing an intake gasket (+-15 lbs).  The 
cause for occilation at idle is likely the system trying to overcome
an imbalance in the mixture (ie air/fuel).  Recommended to me was 
dropping water in all likely areas and listening for retarded engine 
operation.  Probst recomends propane gas at the hoses/fittings.  
That'll increase RPM if a leak is found.  Hope this helps.

Can I follow with a question for myself?

I recently tormented the list with a "944S idle problem".  The 
suggestions were great, thanks.  The problem is still there, however.

Symptom:
	-occasional stumble while warm.  Goes 950RPM-450RPM-1200RPM and 
	 back to 950 over .5 to 1.0 seconds.  Sometimes 950-stallout.
	 symptom seems to occur out of nowhere.
	-guilty of going 27000mi on one fuel filter.
Done:	-new fuel filter (four tanks ago), clean/test idle stabilizer, 
	 two bottles cheap injector cleanor(techron on the way           
        from NAPA), fuel delivery @1150cc per 30sec, injector wires     
        pulled while running, test was successful, fuel gauge on way.
Anyone seen this one?  Other likely areas ahead of fuel filter where 
crud could have gotten?  Neat injector tests/mode of servicing?  Other 
suggestions appreciated.

Thanks

Careful with this one. This works by physically eating away the concrete 
(or masonry or marble, or whetever). The oil would probably end up 
protectiong the concrete so you would just end up etching away the 
non-stained part. Then you would have contoured as well as colored oil 
marks. This stuff (muriatic acid = hydrochloric acid) will also eat the hell 
out of aluminum, FWIW.

I didn't get to follow this thread in detail because I was out of town
delivering my recently sold (finally) vintage race car. But, I recently heard
an interesting story about 'stripped' stolen/salvaged cars that might shed
light on why the car was so carefully stripped and the engine and trans left
intact by the thiefs... It seems that cars are stolen (not necessarily Pcars)
and stripped of ALL non-serial numbered parts (ie. engine/trans etc are left
in the car).  When the car is recovered, the owners insurance company figures
out that age old fact, the parts cost more than the car... so, they pay off
the owner and sell the car at a salvage auction. The enterprising thiefs then
buy it back at the auction and, having saved ALL the parts, put it back
together and sell it. As usual, all I can think off is, if people would put
this kind of effort and ingenuity into productive/legal activities the
results would be amazing... and, our insurance would cost a lot less!
 Apologies if I'm repeating something that was already posted to Pfiles.
 And, Terry... I hope you get the car and have some fun with it!

| Subject: Several 911 questions

| I have a couple of questions as a new Porsche owner.
| 
| First, and this crossed my mind because of the stuck cold start injector
| thread, what kind of mileage should I expect from my 1979 911SC? I've only
| gone through one tank of gas and drove moderately aggressively over a mix of
| highway and city miles. I think I got about 14 mpg. Is this reasonable?
| What's the best I can expect if I drive a little more sedately?

Hi, Steve.  I've got an 80 SC that I've had for about a year.  When I
first got the car, I had problems with cold starting.  The engine would
cough and spit and have a hard time catching when cold.  The mechanic
"fixed" this by what I later learned was what we'd call a "cheap hack"
in computer lingo:  he just richened up the mixture a bunch.  This caused
the car to start with no trouble, but caused me to get 15 MPG in pretty
much all driving conditions.  I subsequently got myself a new mechanic
who was able to readjust the fuel injection system so that the car starts
easily and I now get better than 20 MPG in highway driving with no
detectable decrease in performance.  I guess my throttle foot's a bit
lighter than Stan's ;^).

| 
| Second, when I turn the ignition to the On position, something electrical
| begins humming fairly loudly. I believe it persists after the engine has
| started, but it's a little hard to tell because of the engine noise. What is
| this sound?

Other folks have covered the sophisticated stuff.  Another possibility
is your electic antenna motor.  When I first got my car, the antenna was stuck.
You could hear the motor whirring for 30 seconds or so when you first turned
on the radio.  This sound is easy to distinguish:  it comes from the
direction of the antenna and it stops after a fixed period of time, even
if the antenna doesn't actually extend.

From: CarcareSp@aol.com
Subject: Re: Applying Carnuba Wax

Scott Kelly asked the proper way to apply carnauba wax.

One of the keys to applying carnauba waxes is to apply it sparingly.
 Assuming that the finish has just been washed and dried and is free of grit
and does not need glazing,  then apply the wax with a small piece of 100%
cotton terry cloth or a terry cloth covered sponge applicator pad.  An even
better method of application is to use your fingers.  Hold your fingers
together to form an "applicator".  Rub the wax thoroughly into the surface.
 Your fingers will give you the tactile feedback to let you know when the wax
has been worked into the surface.  This is NOT a situation where a little is
good, so a lot must be better.  Your paint will only accept X amount of wax.
 If you apply 100 times X then you will have to remove 99X in the form of
dried powder.  It will make waxing more difficult, require more buffing and
create clouds of white dust.  

Make sure the paint surface is cool.  Rule of thumb, if you can hold your
hand comfortably on the paint, then it is cool enough to wax.  Work in the
shade, preferably in a garage.  To apply the wax, choose an area about 12" x
12".  Open your can of wax, get a small amount on your fingers (or cloth/pad)
and recover the can (this keeps dirt out of the can).  Apply to the paint
surface, rubbing in a linear motion.  Work into the paint in a front-to-back,
back-to-front motion (the way the air flows over the car).  Don't go around in
 circles the way dear old dad taught you.  If you are using a pad and
airborne grit gets under the pad, you have made sandpaper. If you are working
in a circle, you have made a 360 degree scratch (or swirl mark).  Since a scra
tch or swirl mark is most visible from a 90 degree viewing angle, a circular
scratch is visible anywhere.  If you work in a linear motion, and scratch the
surface, the line scratch is only visible from a small viewing angle.  Using
only your fingers to apply wax will give you the tactile feedback to know
when surface grit is about to scratch your paint.  

Work the small amount of wax into the surface until all that remains is
slight haze.  Use of your fingers will also tell you when the wax has been
thoroughly worked into the paint and will help prevent you from using too
much wax.  Most waxes work best when this slight haze is allowed to dry.
 There are some waxes that require you to buff immediately after applying.
 Zymol is a classic example of this type of wax.  If you allow Zymol to dry
before buffing, you will need a belt sander to remove it.   Read the
directions on the can to determine the proper method.  Buff out the slight
haze with a soft 100% cotton towel.  Buff this small section, shake out the
towel to remove any grit and rebuff with a new section of towel.  Keep using
new sections of towel and change towels frequently.   I use my wife's old
flannel sheets.  They are super soft and produce a brilliant shine.  Move
onto another 12" x 12" section of the car.  Repeat the application and
buffing procedures.  When the car had been completed, return to the first
section completed and rebuff with
another clean towel, continue to rebuff the entire car.  The wax has had time
to harden off and this extra buffing will bring out a deep shine.  If there
are areas that are hazy or cloudy, and you are using a carnuaba based wax,
the wax has become hydroscopic and has absorbed a little water.  Mist the
cloudy areas with a small amount of water (a plant mister works well) and
rebuff.  This should remove the clouding. 

If you are using a polymer based wax on a German paint and have hazy or
clouding of the wax, about the only thing that will work is to strip  the
polymer wax and rewax with a carnauba based wax.  German paints hate polymer
based waxes.  I have spoken to paint chemists, the Glazurit people, Porsche,
BMW and M/B people and to date have not gotten a viable reason for this.  I
have gotten a lot of mumbling and shuffling of feet, but no hard and fast
answers.  The Amercian and Japanese paints LOVE polymer waxes.  The German
paints just don't react well with most of these products.

Another trick to buff out any cloudy areas is to mist the area with Meguiar
#34 Final Inspection and buff out.  This will usually remove all traces of
trapped water.

All towels you use on your Porsche should be 100% cotton and should be washed
in the washing machine using only detergent.  Do not add any fabric softner
to the water.  Dry them in the dryer and DO NOT use a dryer anti-static towel
(I think that's what they are called). These dryer towels contain coatings tha
t are transferred to your car towels and may cause streaks.  If you have ever
had your wax streak and you could not figure out why, your dryer towel was
probably the culprit.  You will remove a giant ball of towel and static
electricity from your dryer, but will not have mysterious streaks.

Some people use a power buffer on their paint.  I personally think that your
Porsche deserves to be caressed by hand.  Save the machine for your SO or Yugo
.   Use of a machine is a learned art and not a science.  It is very easy to
"burn" an edge or create swirl marks.  There is nothing that a person with
the proper chemicals and elbow grease can not do better than a machine.  The
only advantage of a machine is speed and the risks in my humble opinion far
outweigh any time advantage.     

If anyone has any further questions on types of waxes, glazes, polishes or
application, please feel free to contact me.
